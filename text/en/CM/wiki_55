<text>or () is the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European name of the dawn goddess in the Proto-Indo-European mythology.

&quot;&quot; is believed to have been one of the most important deities worshipped by Proto-Indo-European speakers due to the consistency of her characterization in subsequent traditions as well as the importance of the goddess Uṣas in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;.

Her attributes have not only been mixed with those of solar goddesses in some later traditions, most notably the Baltic sun-deity Saulė, but have subsequently expanded and influenced female deities in other mythologies.

== Name ==
=== Etymology ===
The reconstructed Proto-Indo-European name of the dawn, &#x27;, derives the verbal root &#x27; (&#x27;to shine&#x27;, &#x27;glow red&#x27;, &#x27;a flame&#x27;) extended by the suffix . The same root also underlies the word for &#x27;gold&#x27;, &quot;&quot; , inherited in Latin , Old Prussian , and Lithuanian .

The word for the dawn as a meteorological event has also been preserved in Balto-Slavic &quot;*auṣ(t)ro&quot; ( Lithuanian &#x27;dawn&#x27;, &#x27;morning light&#x27;, Proto-Slavic &quot;*ȕtro&quot; &#x27;morning&#x27;, &#x27;dawn&#x27;, Old Church Slavonic &#x27;in the morning&#x27;), in Sanskrit (&#x27;dawn&#x27;), or in Ancient Greek (&#x27;tomorrow&#x27;).

A derivative adverb, &#x27;, meaning &quot;east&quot; (), is reflected in Latvian (&#x27;east&#x27;), Avestan &quot;ušatara&quot; (&#x27;east&#x27;), Italic &#x27; (compare Latin &#x27;south wind, south&#x27;), Old Church Slavonic &quot;ustrŭ&quot; (&#x27;summer&#x27;), and Germanic &quot;*austeraz&quot; ( Old Norse , English &quot;east&quot;, Middle High German ). The same root seems to be preserved in the Baltic names for the northeast wind: Lith. &quot;aūštrinis&quot; and Latvian , , . Also related are the Old Norse &quot;Austri&quot;, described in the as one of four dwarves that guard the four cardinal points (with him representing the east), and (&#x27;The eastern way&#x27;), attested in medieval Germanic literature.

=== Epithets ===
A common epithet associated with the Dawn is &#x27;, the ″Daughter of &#x27;″, the sky god. Cognates stemming from the formulaic expression appear in the following traditions: &#x27;Daughter of Heaven&#x27; in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (as an epithet of Ushas), &#x27;Daughter of Zeus&#x27; (probably associated with Eos in pre-Homeric Greek), &#x27;Daughter of Dievas&#x27; (an epithet transferred to a Sun-goddess in the Lithuanian folklore). Also in northern Albanian folk beliefs Prende, a dawn goddess, is regarded as the daughter of the sky god Zojz.

== Depiction ==
=== Eternal rebirth ===
The Dawn-goddess is sometimes portrayed as un-ageing and her coming as an eternal rebirth. She is (&#x27;early-born&#x27;, &#x27;born in the morning&#x27;) as an epithet of Eos in the Ancient Greek &quot;Iliad&quot;, and the Ancient Indian &quot;Rigveda&quot; describes Ushas, the daughter of Dyáuṣ, as being born from the harnessing of the Aśvins, the divine horse twins driving the chariot of the sun.

=== Colours ===
A widespread characteristic given to the Dawn is her &#x27;brilliance&#x27;; she is generally described as a &quot;bringer of light&quot;. Various cognates associated with the dawn-goddess indeed derive from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;to glow&#x27;, &#x27;shine&#x27;. The Vedic Ushas is described as (&#x27;the Dawn&#x27;s shine&#x27;), the Avestan as (&#x27;shining dawn&#x27;) and the Greek Eos as (&#x27;light-bringing&#x27;), (&#x27;shining on mortals&#x27;), or (&#x27;bright-shining&#x27;), attested in the &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; to the Dawn.

&quot;&quot; is usually associated with the natural colours of the dawn: gold, saffron, red, or crimson. The Dawn is &#x27;gold-coloured&#x27; () in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, &#x27;the golden-yellow one&#x27; () in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Amores&quot;, and &#x27;gold-throned&#x27; () in a Homeric formula. In Latvian folk songs, Saulė and her daughter(s) are dressed of shawls woven with gold thread, and Saulė wears shoes of gold, which parallels Sappho describing Eos as &#x27;golden-sandalled&#x27; ().

Eos is also &#x27;saffron-robed&#x27; () in Homeric poems, while Ushas wears crimson (rose-red) garments and a &quot;gleaming gold&quot; veil. The Hindu goddess is also described as a red dawn shining from afar; &quot;red, like a mare&quot;, she shoots &quot;ruddy beams of light&quot;, &quot;yokes red steeds to her car&quot; or &quot;harnesses the red cows&quot; in the &quot;Samaveda&quot;. Saffron, red and purple are colours also associated with the dawn by the Latin poet Ovid.

The Baltic sun goddess Saulė has preserved some of the imagery of, and she is sometimes portrayed as waking up &#x27;red&#x27; () or &#x27;in a red tree&#x27; during the morning. Saulé is also described as being dressed in clothes woven with &quot;threads of red, gold, silver and white&quot;. In the Lithuanian tradition, the sun is portrayed as a &quot;golden wheel&quot; or a &quot;golden circle&quot; that rolls down the mountain at sunset. Also in Latvian riddles and songs, Saule is associated with the color red, as if to indicate the &quot;fiery aspect&quot; of the sun: the setting and the rising sun are equated with a rose wreath and a rose in bloom, due to their circular shapes.

According to Russian folklorist Alexander Afanasyev, the figure of the Dawn in Slavic tradition is varied: she is described in a Serbian folksong as a maiden sitting on a silver throne in the water, her legs of a yellow color and her arms of gold; in a Russian saying, the goddess Zorya is invoked as a ( &#x27;red maiden&#x27;); in another story, the &quot;red maiden&quot; Zorya sits on a golden chair and holds a silver disk or mirror (identified as the sun); in another, a maiden sits on a white-hot stone (Alatyr) in Buyan, weaving red silk in one version, or the &quot;rose-fingered&quot; Zorya, with her golden needle, weaves over the sky a veil in rosy and &quot;blood-red&quot; colours using a thread of &quot;yellow ore&quot;. She is also depicted as a beautiful golden-haired queen who lives in a golden kingdom &quot;at the edge of the White World&quot;, and rows through the seas with her golden oar and silver boat.

=== Movements ===
&quot;&quot; is frequently described as dancing: Uṣas throws on embroidered garments &#x27;like a dancer&#x27; (), Eos has &#x27;dancing-places&#x27; () around her house in the east, Saulė is portrayed as dancing in her gilded shoes on a silver hill, and her fellow Baltic goddess Aušrinė is said to dance on a stone for the people on the first day of summer. According to a Bulgarian tradition, on St. John&#x27;s Day, the sun dances and &quot;whirls swords about&quot; (sends rays of light), whereas in Lithuania the Sun (identified as female) rides a car towards her husband, the Moon, &quot;dancing and emitting fiery sparks&quot; on the way.

The spread hand as the image of the sun&#x27;s rays in the morning may also be of Proto-Indo-European origin. The Homeric expressions &#x27;rose-armed&#x27; () and &#x27;rosy-fingered Dawn&#x27; (), as well as Bacchylides&#x27; formula &#x27;gold-armed&#x27; (), can be semantically compared with the Vedic formulas &#x27;golden-handed&#x27; () and &#x27;broad-handed&#x27; (). They are also similar with Latvian poetic songs where the Sun-god&#x27;s fingers are said to be &#x27;covered with golden rings&#x27;. According to Martin L. West, &quot;the &#x27;rose&#x27; part is probably a Greek refinement.&quot;

Another trait ascribed to the Dawn is that she is &quot;wide-shining&quot; or &quot;far-shining&quot; - an attribute possibly attested in Greek theonym &quot;Euryphaessa&quot; (&quot;wide-shining&quot;) and Sanskrit poetic expression (&#x27;[Ushas] shines forth/shines out widely&#x27;).

=== Dwelling ===
Another common trait of the Dawn goddess is her dwelling, generally situated on an island in the Ocean, or sometimes in an Eastern house.

In Greek mythology, Eos is described as living &#x27;beyond the streams of Okeanos at the ends of the earth&#x27;. A more precise location is given in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, by poet Homer: in his narration, Odysseus tells his audience that the Aeaean isle is &quot;where is the dwelling of early Dawn and her dancing-lawns, and the risings of the sun&quot;.

In Slavic folklore, the home of the Zoryas was sometimes said to be on Bouyan (or &quot;Buyan&quot;), an oceanic island paradise where the Sun dwelt along with his attendants, the North, West and East winds.

The &quot;Avesta&quot; refers to a mythical eastern mountain called (&#x27;Dawn-house&#x27;). The &quot;Yasnas&quot; also mention a mountain named , possibly meaning &quot;crack of dawn&quot; (as a noun) or &quot;having reddish cracks&quot; (as an adjective).

In a myth from Lithuania, a man named Joseph becomes fascinated with Aušrinė appearing in the sky and goes on a quest to find the &#x27;second sun&#x27;, who is actually a maiden that lives on an island in the sea and has the same hair as the Sun. In the Baltic folklore, Saulė is said to live in a silver-gated castle at the end of the sea, located somewhere in the east, or to go to an island in the middle of the sea for her nocturnal rest. In folksongs, Saule sinks into the bottom of a lake to sleep at night, in a silver cradle &quot;in the white seafoam&quot;.

=== Vehicle ===

==== Carrier ====
The Dawn is often described as driving some sort of vehicle, probably originally a wagon or a similar carrier, certainly not a chariot as the technology appeared later within the Sintashta culture (2100–1800 BC), generally associated with the Indo-Iranian peoples. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Eos appears once as a charioteer, and the Vedic Ushas yokes red oxen or cows, probably pictorial metaphors for the red clouds or rays seen at morning light. The vehicle is portrayed as a &quot;biga&quot; or a rosy-red &quot;quadriga&quot; in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and in classical references from Greek epic poetry and vase painting, or as a shining chariot drawn by golden-red horses. According to Albanian folk beliefs the dawn goddess Prende is pulled across the sky in her chariot by swallows, called &#x27;the Lady&#x27;s Birds&#x27;, which are connected to the chariot by the rainbow () that the people also call or &#x27;the Lady&#x27;s Belt&#x27;.

Saulė, a sun-goddess syncrethized with the Dawn, also drives a carriage with copper-wheels, a &quot;gleaming copper chariot&quot; or a golden chariot pulled by untiring horses, or a &#x27;pretty little sleigh&#x27; (&quot;kamaņiņa&quot;) made of fish-bones. Saulė is also described as driving her shining car on the way to her husband, the Moon. In other accounts, she is said to sail the seas on a silver or a golden boat, which, according to legend, is what her chariot transforms into for her night travels. In a Latvian folksong, Saule hangs her sparkling crown on a tree in the evening and enters a golden boat to sail away.

In old Slavic fairy tales, the Dawn-Maiden () &quot;sails the sea in the early morning in her boat of gold with a silver paddle&quot; (alternatively, a silver boat with golden oars) and sails back to Buyan, the mysterious island where she dwells.

==== Horses ====
The Dawn&#x27;s horses are also mentioned in several Indo-European poetical traditions. Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; describes the horses of Eos as a pair of swift steeds named Lampos and Phaethon, and Bacchylides calls her &#x27;white-horsed Dawn&#x27; (). The vehicle is sometimes portrayed as being drawn by golden-red horses. The colours of Dawn&#x27;s horses are said to be &quot;pale red, ruddy, yellowish, reddish-yellow&quot; in the Vedic tradition.

Baltic sun-goddess Saulė&#x27;s horses are said to be of a white color; in other accounts they amount to three steeds of golden, silver and diamond colors. In Latvian &quot;dainas&quot; (folk songs), her horses are described as yellow, of a golden or a fiery color. The sun&#x27;s steeds are also portrayed as having hooves and bridles of gold in the &quot;dainas&quot;, and as golden beings themselves or of a bay colour, &quot;reflect[ing] the hues of the bright or the twilight sky&quot;. When she begins her nocturnal journey through the World Sea, her chariot changes into a boat and &quot;the Sun swims her horses&quot;, which signifies that &quot;she stops to wash her horses in the sea&quot;. Scholarship points that the expressions &quot;geltoni žirgeliai&quot; or &quot;dzelteni kumeliņi&quot; (&#x27;golden&#x27; or &#x27;yellow horses&#x27;), which appear in Latvian &quot;dainas&quot;, seem to be a recurrent poetic motif.

Although Zorya of Slavic mythology does not appear to feature in stories with a chariot or wagon pulled by horses, she is still described in a tale as preparing the &quot;fiery horses&quot; of her brother, the Sun, at the beginning and at the end of the day.

== Role ==
=== Opener of the doors of heaven ===
&#x27; is often depicted as the opener of the doors or gates of her father the heaven (&#x27;): the Baltic verse &quot;pie Dieviņa namdurēm&quot; (&#x27;by the doors of the house of God&#x27;), which Saulė is urged to open to the horses of the son(s) of God, is lexically comparable with the Vedic expression (&#x27;doors of Heaven&#x27;), which Ushas opens with her light. Another parallel could be made with the &#x27;shining doors&#x27; () of the home of Eos, behind which she locks up her lover Tithonus as he grows old and withers in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;.

A similar poetic imagery is present among Classical poets, although some earlier Greek source may lie behind these. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Aurora opens the red doors (&quot;purpureas fores&quot;) to fill her rosy halls, and in Nonnus&#x27; &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; the Dawn-goddess shakes off her sleep and leaves Kephalos&#x27; repose in order to &#x27;open the gates of sunrise&#x27; (ἀντολίης ὤιξε θύρας πολεμητόκος Ἠώς).

Other reflexes may also be present in other Indo-European traditions. In Slavic folklore, the goddess of the dawn &quot;Zorya Utrennyaya&quot; open the palace&#x27;s gates for the journey of her father Dažbog, a Slavic Sun god, during the day. Her sister &quot;Zorya Vechernyaya,&quot; the goddess of dusk, closes them at the end of the day. In a passage of the &quot;Eddas&quot; about Dellingr, a Norse deity of light, a dwarf utters a charm or incantation in front of &#x27;Delling&#x27;s doors&#x27; (), which apparently means &quot;at dawn&quot;.

According to scholarship, Lithuanian folklore attests a similar dual role for luminous deities Vakarine and Ausrine, akin to Slavic Zoryas (although it lacks the door imagery): Vakarine, the Evening Star, made the bed for solar goddess Saulė, and Aušrinė, the Morning Star, lit the fire for her as she prepared for another day&#x27;s journey. In another account, they are Saulé&#x27;s daughters and tend their mother&#x27;s palace and horses.

=== Reluctant bringer of light ===
In Indo-European myths, &quot;&quot; is frequently depicted as a reluctant bringer of light for which she is punished. This theme is widespread in the attested traditions: Eos and Aurora are sometimes unwilling to leave her bed, Uṣas is punished by Indra for attempting to forestall the day, and Auseklis did not always rise in the morning, as she was said to be locked up in a golden chamber or in Germany sewing velvet skirts.

The Divine Twins are often said to rescue the Dawn from a watery peril, a theme that emerged from their role as the solar steeds.

=== Epithets ===
The formulaic expression &quot;Daughter of Dyēus&quot; is attested as an epithet attached to a dawn-goddess in several poetic traditions:
* PIE: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Daughter of Dyēus&quot;,
**Vedic: &quot;duhitā́r-diváh&quot;, &quot;Daughter of Heaven&quot;, epithet of Uṣas
** Greek: &quot;thugátēr Diós&quot;, &quot;Daughter of Zeus&quot;, probably a pre-Homeric Greek epithet of Eos
** Lithuanian: &quot;dievo dukra&quot;, &quot;Daughter of Dievas&quot;, epithet of the Sun-goddess which likely took the attributes of h₂éwsōs.

=== Poetic and liturgic formula ===
An expression of formulaic poetry can be found in the Proto-Indo-European expression &quot;&quot; (&#x27;it dawns&#x27;), attested in Lithuanian and , Latvian , Avestan , or Sanskrit . The poetic formula &#x27;the lighting dawn&#x27; is also attested in the Indo-Iranian tradition: Sanskrit , and Young Avestan . A hapax legomenon &quot;uşád-bhiḥ&quot; (instr. pl.) is also attested.

Other remnants of the root &quot;&quot; are present in the Zoroastrian prayer to the dawn &quot;Hoshbām&quot;, and in &quot;Ušahin gāh&quot; (the dawn watch), sung between midnight and dawn. In Persian historical and sacred literature, namely, the &quot;Bundahishn&quot;, in the chapter about the genealogy of the Kayanid dynasty, princess Frānag, in exile with &quot;Frēdōn&#x27;s Glory&quot; after escaping her father&#x27;s murderous intentions, promises to give her firstborn son, Kay Apiweh, to &quot;Ōšebām&quot;. Ōšebām, in return, saves Franag. In the &quot;Yasht&quot; about Zam, the Angel of the Munificent Earth, a passage reads &quot;upaoṣ̌ā̊ŋhə&quot; (&#x27;situated in the rosy dawn&#x27;), &quot;a hypostatic derivation from unattested &quot;*upa uṣ̌āhu&quot; &#x27;up in the morning light(s)&#x27;&quot;.

A special carol, &quot;zorile&quot; (&quot;dawn&quot;), was sung by the &quot;colindători&quot; (traditional Romanian singers) during funerals, imploring the Dawns not be in a hurry to break, or begging them to prevent the dead from departing this world. The word is of Slavic origin, with the term for &#x27;dawn&#x27; attached to the Romanian article &quot;-le&quot;.

Stefan Zimmer suggests that Welsh literary expression &quot;ym bronn y dyd&quot; (&quot;at the breast/bosom of the day&quot;) is an archaic formula possibly referring to the Dawn goddess, who bared her breast.

== Legacy ==
Scholars have argued that the Roman name Aurēlius (originally &quot;Ausēlius&quot;, from Sabine &#x27; &#x27;sun&#x27;) and the Etruscan sun god Usil (probably of Osco-Umbrian origin) may be related to the Indo-European word for the dawn. A figure in Belarusian tradition named Аўсень (Ausenis) and related to the coming of spring is speculated to be cognate to &#x27;.

Remnants of the root &quot;&quot; and its derivations survive in onomastics of the Middle Ages. A medieval French obituary from the 12th century, from Moissac, in Occitania, registers compound names of Germanic origin that contain root &quot;Aur-&quot; (e.g., Auraldus) and &quot;Austr-&quot; (e.g., Austremonius, Austrinus, Austris). Names of Frankish origin are attested in a &quot;polyptyque&quot; of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, containing &quot;aust-&quot; (sometimes &quot;host-&quot; or &quot;ost-&quot;) and &quot;austr-&quot; (or &quot;ostr-&quot; &gt; French &quot;out-&quot;). Germanic personal names in Galicia and Iberian toponyms with prefix &quot;aus-&quot;, &quot;astr-&quot; and &quot;aust-&quot; (&gt; &quot;ost-&quot;) also attest the survival of the root well into medieval times.

A character named &quot;Gwawrdur&quot; is mentioned in the Mabinogion tale of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;. Stefan Zimmer suggests either a remnant of the Dawn goddess or a name meaning &quot;(with) the color of steel&quot;, since &quot;gwawr&quot; may also mean &#x27;color, hue, shade&#x27;. The name also appears in the &quot;Canu Aneirin&quot; under the variants &quot;Gwardur&quot;, &quot;Guaurud&quot;, &quot;Guaurdur&quot;, &quot;(G)waredur&quot;, or &quot;(G)waledur&quot;. All of these stem from the Middle Welsh (&#x27;dawn&#x27;; also &#x27;hero, prince&#x27;). According to linguist Ranko Matasović, the latter derives from Proto-Celtic &quot;*warī-&quot; (&#x27;sunrise, east&#x27;, Middle Irish ), itself from the PIE root &quot;&quot; (&#x27;spring&#x27;).

In Albanian folk beliefs, &quot;Prende&quot;, who had been worshiped in northern Albania until recent times, is the dawn goddess, whose name traces back to PIE &#x27; &#x27;she who brings the light through&#x27;, from which also the Ancient Greek , a variant of (Persephone), is considered to have regularly descended. In Albanian folklore is also called – an Albanian phrase meaning &#x27;near day&#x27;, &#x27;the day is near&#x27;, or &#x27;dawn&#x27; – which is used as a native term for the planet Venus: &#x27;the star of light Afërdita&#x27; (i.e. Venus, the morning star) and (i.e. Venus, the evening star). The Albanian imperative form &#x27;come forth the dawn&#x27; traces back to Proto-Albanian &#x27; &#x27;come forth brightness of the day/dawn&#x27;, from PIE &#x27;. According to linguist Václav Blažek, the Albanian word (&#x27;star&#x27;) finds a probable ultimate etymology in the root &#x27; (&#x27;dawn&#x27;), specifically through &quot;&quot; (&#x27;morning-star&#x27;), which implies the quite natural semantic evolution &#x27;dawn&#x27; &gt; &#x27;morning star&#x27; &gt; &#x27;star&#x27;.

=== Influences ===
According to Michael Witzel, the Japanese goddess of the dawn Uzume, revered in Shinto, was influenced by Vedic religion. It has been suggested by anthropologist Kevin Tuite that Georgian goddess Dali also shows several parallels with Indo-European dawn goddesses.

A possible mythological descendant of the Indo-European dawn goddess may be Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and lust. Scholars posit similarities based on her connection with a sky deity as her father (Zeus or Uranus) and her association with red and gold colours. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Aphrodite is hurt by a mortal and seeks solace in her mother&#x27;s (Dione) bosom. Dione is seen as a female counterpart to Zeus and is thought to etymologically derive from Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Credit River is a river in southern Ontario, which flows from headwaters above the Niagara Escarpment near Orangeville and Caledon East to empty into Lake Ontario at Port Credit, Mississauga. It drains an area of approximately . The total length of the river and its tributary streams is over .

Despite urbanization and associated problems with water quality on the lower section of this river, it provides spawning areas for Chinook salmon and rainbow trout. There is a fish ladder on the river at Streetsville. Much of the river can still be travelled by canoe or kayak. The headwaters of the Credit River is home to a native self-sustaining brook trout population and an introduced brown trout population.

Credit Valley Conservation, the local watershed management conservation authority, operates several Conservation Areas including Belfountain, Island Lake, and Terra Cotta.


Forks of the Credit Provincial Park is located on the upper part of the river between Brampton and Orangeville, and is near the Bruce Trail.

Communities in the river&#x27;s watershed include the following:

*City of Brampton
*City of Mississauga
*Township of Amaranth
*Town of Caledon
*Township of East Garafraxa
*Town of Halton Hills
*Town of Mono
*Town of Orangeville
==Naming==
The river became known as &quot;Missinnihe&quot; (Eastern Ojibwa: &quot;trusting creek&quot;) to the Mississaugas First Nation who met annually with white traders there. To the First Nations, the river was &quot;held in reverential estimation as the favourite resort of their ancestors&quot; and the band, which ranged from Long Point on Lake Erie to the Rouge River on Lake Ontario, became known as the Credit River Indians. Their descendants are today the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.

The origins of the English name come from the time when French fur traders supplied goods to the native people in advance (on credit) against furs which would be delivered the following spring. It was known as the Rivière au Crédit. The trading post was set up at the mouth of the river, in Port Credit, in the early 18th century.

==Watershed population and land use==
As of the 2006 census, 750,000 people live in the watershed. Of those, 87 percent live in the lower third of the watershed. Population growth is approximately 3 percent per year. In 1999, 21 percent of the watershed was developed. By 2020, 40 percent of the watershed will be developed (based on approved development and the official plans of the municipalities).

<text>A. H. Stephens State Park is a Georgia state park located in Crawfordville. The park is named for Alexander H. Stephens, the Vice President of the Confederate States of America, and a former Georgia governor. The park contains Stephens&#x27; home, [[Liberty Hall (Crawfordville, Georgia)|Liberty Hall]], which has been fully restored to its original 1875 style. The park&#x27;s museum houses one of Georgia&#x27;s largest collections of American Civil War artifacts. The park also offers several mill ponds for fishing and nature trails.

The park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as A. H. Stephens State Park. It includes four contributing sites, twelve contributing structures, and one other contributing object. It includes Colonial Revival and Rustic Style architecture.

==History==
Alexander Hamilton Stephens once owned the land of A. H. Stephens State Park. After he died, the property came under the control of the Stephens Monument Commission, a group chartered to protect Liberty Hall and its surroundings. The state received the land in 1933 to establish Georgia&#x27;s third-oldest state park. The U.S. Government later acquired several hundred acres of land adjacent to the property. The current boundary of the park was completed by transferring ownership of this area to the state.

The museum was established in the 1950s after work by Horace Holden, Stephens&#x27; niece and a United Daughters of the Confederacy member, who assisted in creating it.

The park&#x27;s civil engineering was built during the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration. The state acquired 15 acres of Taliaferro County Board of Education-owned property in 2001, which increased the park&#x27;s current acreage.

==Liberty Hall==

The Liberty Hall, also known as &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Hall&quot;, built in 1834, is one of the structures on the site and is separately listed on the NRHP. It is a National Historic Landmark maintained by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. A. H. Stephens bought the estate in 1845 and lived in this house until 1875 when he tore down the main structure to construct Liberty Hall. The two-story &quot;big house&quot; is a traditional 4 × 4 with four rooms on each level.

Many of Stephens&#x27; books are housed in a smaller structure behind the facility, where he spent much of his time after the war. After Stephens died in 1883, Liberty Hall, owned by his surviving relatives, served as a boardinghouse until 1932, when it was donated to Georgia. Stephens&#x27; grave is on the front lawn, beneath a marble statue.

<doc id="1211776" wikidata="Q2569407" url="?curid=1211776" title="Half a Loaf of Kung Fu">
<text>Half a Loaf of Kung Fu () is a 1978 Hong Kong martial arts film directed by Chen Chi-hwa, and starring Jackie Chan, who also wrote the screenplay with Tang Ming-chi. The film co-stars Dean Shek, James Tien, Doris Lung, and Wu Ma. The film was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 1 July 1978. Chan plays a bumbling kung fu student who becomes involved in a series of adventures in one of his first forays into the kung fu acrobatic slapstick comedy style that would become his signature.

In the film, the martial arts student is caught spying on an evil witch. He is later attacked by the witch, but is rescued by his next kung fu teacher. The film is a parody of the stoic depictions of martial artists in &quot;serious&quot; martial arts films. 

== Plot ==
A bumbling long-haired acrobat named Jiang desires to practice kung fu. He finds an advertisement for work at the Mansion as a body guard. Jiang does not get the body guard position, but cons his way into a job using his kung fu skills, and gets himself into the middle of some shady business. 

Jiang is told not to go near the &quot;guest room&quot; where the special guest is staying. A fellow employee tells Jiang that there is an evil witch who lives in the guest room and is not to be disturbed. Jiang of course is caught spying on her and is run off the land. 

He then encounters two kung fu masters fighting in the woods. He watches one kill the other, and when he leaves Jiang takes the body into town to collect the reward. Using the money from the reward, Jiang tries to fulfill his kung fu dreams and find a master. He is suddenly attacked by the crazy witch and is about to lose until a mystery master shows up and beats her. The master turns out to be a bum, and teaches Jiang kung fu. He then goes on a journey with a princess to find a special jade plant.

<text>Runar Berg (born 7 October 1970) is a Norwegian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He played for Bodø/Glimt, Rosenborg, Tromsø, Lyn, and Venezia. Berg is brother of former Bodø/Glimt and Rosenborg player Ørjan Berg, and son of former Bodø/Glimt midfielder and playmaker Harald Berg.

==Personal life==
Berg was born in The Hague, Netherlands, when his father Harald Berg played for ADO Den Haag. He is the brother of footballers Ørjan Berg and Arild Berg, as well as musician Terje Berg. Berg is also the nephew of Norwegian folk-singer Terje Nilsen.

==Club career==
At the start of his adult football life, Runar Berg played – as his father – at Bodø/Glimt, then playing in the 1st division. The 1988 season Bodø/Glimt got relegated to the 2nd division. Runar Berg was bought by Nils Arne Eggen to Rosenborg to play with his brother Ørjan in the 1989 season.

In 1992, Berg returned to his mother club Bodø/Glimt then again playing in the 1st division. Bodø/Glimt won the first division and gained promotion for the Norwegian top division. In 1997, Berg returned to Rosenborg. In 1999, Berg made a move to Venezia, playing in the Serie A. The club had financial problems, however, and was relegated. Berg moved back to Norway on loan to Lyn, before returning &quot;home&quot; to Bodø/Glimt in 2001. He announced his retirement in September 2010.

Berg is considered a club legend at Bodø/Glimt. In the 2009 season, when the club had financial problems, Berg played for free. Being the best paid player at the club, Berg did not only give up his ~100,000 euro/year salary, but also started a fund-raiser among local businesses to help save the club. Berg has also earlier donated money to the club, as well as other sport clubs in the area.

In 2012, Berg made a comeback for local amateur side Junkeren.

==International career==
Berg made his debut for Norway in a January 1994 friendly match against the United States, coming on as a late substitute for Kjetil Rekdal and earned 5 caps, scoring no goals.

<text>Felipe Fernández-Armesto (born 1950) is a British professor of history and author of several popular works, notably on cultural and environmental history.

==Life and career==
He was born in London; his father was the Spanish journalist Felipe Fernández Armesto (who wrote using the pseudonym ) and his mother was Betty Millan, a British-born journalist and co-founder (with Remy Hefter, in 1947) and editor of &quot;The Diplomatist&quot; (whose current title is &quot;Diplomat&quot;), the in-house journal of the diplomatic corps in London.

Felipe Fernandez-Armesto joined the history department at the University of Notre Dame in 2009, after occupying chairs at Tufts University and at Queen Mary College, University of London. He had spent most of his career teaching at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate and doctoral student. He has had visiting appointments at many universities and research institutes in Europe and the Americas and has honorary doctorates from La Trobe University and the University of the Andes, Colombia. He began his teaching career at Charterhouse School in Godalming, Surrey.

In 1982 he published &quot;The Canary Islands after the Conquest: The Making of a Colonial Society in the Early Sixteenth Century&quot;, an archival study of the Canary Islands during the period of their original settlement. In 1987 he published &quot;Before Columbus: Exploration and Colonization from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic 1229–1492&quot;, a study of the earliest phase of European imperialism when Europeans left the Mediterranean and colonized the islands along the northwest coast of Africa.

Fernández-Armesto gained media attention in 2007 for allegedly being a victim of police brutality at the hands of the Atlanta Police Department, following an incident of jaywalking.

==Awards and honours==

<text>Ron Della Chiesa is a Boston area radio personality. Born in 1938 in Quincy, Massachusetts, he was taken by his father to jazz and Boston Symphony Orchestra concerts in the early 1950s, and developed an ear for both genres. His commentaries, originally on WGBH radio and now WCRB for the Boston Symphony are broadcast on Saturday evenings. These broadcasts as well as his commentary at the Sunday Tanglewood Festival in the summertime are informed by his lifelong attendance of the orchestra, dating back to conductors Charles Münch and Erich Leinsdorf.

His mother, an educator in the South Shore, gave him a love of learning, a curiosity for many cultures, and until her recent passing, a tie to the last Golden Age of Opera. Della Chiesa enlisted in the Army, and became a trumpeter in the Army band. He was an announcer for WBCN in the 1960s and WGBH radio in the mid-1970s.

His first job after graduating from the Boston University College of Communication in 1959 was at WBOS.

From the mid-1970s into the early 1980s Della Chiesa was host of &quot;Music America&quot;, an afternoon program on WGBH which featured the broad range of American jazz and musical theater. He has presented many visiting Broadway and jazz performers, with a special Friday afternoon program of opera. He was also host for the Boston Symphony Friday performances. In 1986, Ron married a chef by the name of Joyce. Ron was 48 and Joyce was 41. He and his wife, Joyce Della Chiesa, now live in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in a 10-room Victorian style house. In 1995 he was awarded the Courage of Conscience award for being a steward of intergenerational music that binds society and elevates cultural integrity.

With the death of Robert J. Lurtsema in 2000, he became the host of &quot;Classical Morning&quot;, but retained his Friday afternoon Boston Symphony spot. He continues to announce a Friday evening jazz program, where his close friends will drop in when they are performing in Boston. He is also heard on WPLM-FM on a Sunday night program highlighting Frank Sinatra.

Della Chiesa has been the host of &quot;Cooking Around Town&quot; on WGBH-TV. In that capacity, he has visited many of the famous and esoteric eateries and bistros in the Boston area, watching the owner/chefs turn their recipes into delicious dishes. Della Chiesa also is in demand as a narrator for New England orchestras and social functions. He occasionally hosts learning tours and lectures for opera, both on land, and on cruise ships; most notably, the &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;.

<text>Amicalola Falls State Park &amp; Lodge is an Georgia state park located between Ellijay and Dahlonega in Dawsonville, Georgia. The park&#x27;s name is derived from a Cherokee language word meaning &quot;tumbling waters&quot;. The park is home to Amicalola Falls, a waterfall that is the highest in Georgia. However, an analysis conducted by the World Waterfall Data base suggests that the main part of the falls is in height, followed by a prolonged gently sloping run in which the flow drops another . It is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia. An trail that winds past Amicalola Falls and leads to Springer Mountain, famous as the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, begins in the park. Amicalola Falls State Park also offers many hiking trails, a guest lodge, restaurant, cabins, a shelter for long-distance Appalachian Trail hikers, a campground, and access to the eco-friendly Len Foote Hike Inn.

==History==

Little was known by European Americans about the falls before the 19th century. Until 1832, the Cherokee, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe believed to have migrated in ancient times from the Great Lakes region, controlled a large territory that included this area of the state park. That year they signed the Treaty of New Echota with the United States, which forced the Cherokee to remove into the Ozarks in Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. They called their mass removal and overland journey the Trail of Tears, during which many people died of the thousands traveling. Nearby settlers knew a Cherokee woman who lived in the area until the 1850s; she refused to leave when her tribe was removed.

The first written account of the falls was by William Williamson, who was exploring the area seeking land to claim in the Sixth Georgia Land Lottery. Williamson wrote: 
An unknown settler was given this land after the lottery. He decided not to live on it because the terrain proved to be too rugged. The state purchased the falls in 1911. Amicalola Falls State Park was not developed at all until the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club decided in 1958 that they would move the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail from Mount Oglethorpe to the nearby Springer Mountain. An trail was blazed from the base of Amicalola Falls to the top of Springer Mountain, so that Appalachian Trail hikers would be able to access the trail from a major highway.

==Today==

Amicalola Falls State Park &amp; Lodge has four groups of trails within it, including the trail leading up to the top of the waterfall. The park has a lodge that serves as a starting point for Appalachian Trail hikers. The park also checks in guests for a nearby facility called the Len Foote Hike Inn, a backcountry eco-friendly inn that is 5 miles from the park, one mile from the Appalachian Approach trail and 4.4 miles from Springer Mountain.

In 2012, Amicalola Falls State Park was privatized and its operations transferred to Coral Hospitality, a Florida-based hotel and resort management company.

<text>Esperanza Base (, &#x27;Hope Base&#x27;) is a permanent, all-year-round Argentine research station in Hope Bay, Trinity Peninsula (in Graham Land on the Antarctic Peninsula). It is the only civilian settlement in Antarctica (the Chilean Villa Las Estrellas is on the  South Shetland Islands). The base&#x27;s motto is &quot;Permanencia, un acto de sacrificio&quot; (&#x27;Permanence, an act of sacrifice&#x27;).

==Description==

Built in 1953, the base houses 56 inhabitants in winter, including 10 families and 2 school teachers. Provincial school #38 &quot;Presidente Raúl Ricardo Alfonsín&quot; (formerly named &quot;Julio Argentino Roca&quot;) was founded in 1978 and acquired independent status in 1997. It maintains the furthest South Scout troop. The base has an Argentine civil register office where births and weddings are recorded. The base has tourist facilities that are visited by about 1,100 tourists each year.

The LRA 36 &quot;Radio Nacional Arcángel San Gabriel&quot; radio station started transmitting in 1979 and currently broadcasts on 15476 kHz shortwave and 96.7 MHz FM. It is one of the southernmost radio stations in the world and its range signal includes audio identification in multiple languages. The host of &quot;Panorama Nacional&quot; Marcelo Ayala told at the beginning of 2024 about his life experience and broadcast by LRA36 Radio Nacional Arcángel San Gabriel.

A wind generator was installed in 2008, mounted by INVAP.

The 43 buildings of the station have a combined space of covered; of fuel are used annually by the four generators to produce electricity for the station. Research projects include: glaciology, seismology, oceanography, coastal ecology, biology, geology, and limnology.

In the Hope Bay incident in 1952, this area was also the scene of the only shots fired in anger in Antarctica, when an Argentine shore party fired a machine gun over the heads of a Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey team unloading supplies from the &quot;John Biscoe&quot; to rebuild its damaged base. Following the Argentine show of force, the British team returned to the Falkland Islands. Shortly afterwards, Argentina issued a diplomatic apology, saying there had been a misunderstanding and the military commander on the ground had exceeded his authority. Despite this initial outward show of deference, the party was later welcomed back to Argentina with a hero&#x27;s welcome. In the meantime, the &quot;John Biscoe&quot; had returned from the Falklands with a military escort and completed rebuilding the British base. The Antarctic Treaty of 1959 now treats the continent as a laboratory open to all, and provides that &quot;no acts or activities ... shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty.&quot;

==People==

The base was the birthplace of Emilio Palma, the first person to be born in Antarctica. There have been at least ten other children born at the base.

==Climate==
Like the rest of the Antarctic Peninsula, the base has a polar climate characterized by strong winds that descend downwards from the Antarctic ice sheet. These winds can exceed , leading to blowing snow and reduced visibility. The climate is classified as a polar tundra (ET) climate in the Köppen system.

Mean monthly temperatures range from in July, the coldest month, to in January, the warmest month. During summer (December–February), the average high is between while the average low is between . In winter, mean temperatures are around . A temperature of was recorded on 24 March 2015. This reading was the highest temperature ever recorded on mainland Antarctica and its surrounding islands, until on 6 February 2020, a new high of was recorded at the base, being the current record and considered by the World Meteorological Organization to be the highest temperature ever recorded for mainland Antarctica and its surrounding islands. The lowest temperature ever recorded is on 18 July 1994.

The temperature trend since 1948 is +0.0315 °C/yr (+0.0567 °F/yr) (annual), +0.0413 °C/yr (+0.0743 °F/yr) (winter) and +0.0300 °C/yr (+0.0540 °F/yr) (summer).

==Historic site==

A group of items or structures of historic significance at, or close to, the base have been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 40), following a proposal by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. These comprise a bust of General San Martin, a grotto with a statue of the Virgin of Lujan, a flagpole erected in 1955, and a cemetery with a stele commemorating Argentine expedition members who died in the area.

== General Martín Güemes Refuge ==
Refuge General Martín Güemes is the name given to two shelters in Antarctica. The first one is covered by ice, the second one is active. The refuge is Administered by the Argentine Army and depends on Esperanza Base, which is responsible for maintenance and care. The two refuges are located on the Tabarin Peninsula on the eastern tip of the Trinity Peninsula on the Antarctic Peninsula south of Esperanza. The refuges pay homage to Martín Miguel de Güemes, a military man who served an outstanding role in the Argentine war of independence.

=== General Martín Güemes I Refuge ===
The first refuge was located on the north east coast of the Duse Bay of the Trinity Peninsula and opened on October 23, 1953. , at that time head of the newly created Esperanza Base, participated in its construction, being one of the first refuges installed by the Army and the second in the continental Antarctica. The refuge was destroyed by the ice in 1960.

=== General Martín Güemes II Refuge ===
The second refuge is active and is located in the Tabarin Peninsula and was inaugurated on September 15, 1959. It has capacity for six people, food for a month, fuel, gas and a first aid kit.

<text>Louis Jacquinot (16 September 1898 – 14 June 1993) was a French lawyer and politician, and chief of Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré&#x27;s office.

== Biography ==
Jacquinot was born in Gondrecourt-le-Château (Meuse) in 1898. Entering parliament in 1932, he later served for a short time as under-secretary of state for home affairs in Paul Reynaud&#x27;s cabinet (1940). He served in the army World War II and followed General de Gaulle to London. He served as High Commissioner for the Navy in the provisional governments at Algiers and Paris, Minister of State for Muslim Affairs (1945), Minister of Marine (Navy) (1947), Minister of Veterans and War Victims (1949), Minister of Overseas France (1951–52 and 1953–54).

After de Gaulle&#x27;s return to power in 1958, he was appointed Minister of State in charge of scientific research and afterwards for the Sahara. As Minister of State, he was part of a &quot;study group&quot; formed by de Gaulle with the purpose of devising a constitution for the Fifth Republic. Later he again held the position of Minister for Overseas France (1961–66). He also chaired the General Council of the Meuse department in the Lorraine Province. A moderate right-wing politician during the Third and Fourth Republics, during the de Gaulle era, he voted with Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s independent republicans and later as a member of the Gaullist Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic. He left parliament in 1973. Jacquinot married the wife of former Finance Minister Maurice Petsche in order to be elected president that year, but he was homosexual.

He died in Paris in 1993.

<doc id="1211820" wikidata="Q7312235" url="?curid=1211820" title="Remuera">
<text>Remuera is an affluent suburb in Auckland, New Zealand. It is located four kilometres southeast of the city centre. Remuera is characterised by many large houses, often Edwardian or mid 20th century. A prime example of a &quot;leafy&quot; suburb, Remuera is noted for its quiet tree-lined streets. The suburb has numerous green spaces, most obvious of which is Ōhinerau / Mount Hobson – a volcanic cone with views from the top overlooking Waitematā Harbour and Rangitoto.

The suburb extends from Hobson Bay and the Ōrākei Basin on the Waitematā Harbour to the north and east, to the main thoroughfare of State Highway 1 in the southwest. It is surrounded by the suburbs of Ōrākei, Meadowbank, Saint Johns, Mount Wellington, Ellerslie, Greenlane, Epsom, Newmarket and Parnell. Remuera has been home to many well-known New Zealanders, including the late Sir Edmund Hillary and the race car driver Bruce McLaren.

==History==
The area was attractive to Tāmaki Māori as much of the Auckland isthmus was devoid of trees and covered only in native flax, bracken and scrub. Remuera was different, having patches of woodland which were the habitat of many birds suitable for trapping while the adjacent harbour and basins were good fishing areas. Remuera Road was firstly a walking track, connecting the eastern and northern sections of the Auckland isthmus.

John Logan Campbell describes early 19th century Remuera in his book &quot;Poenamo&quot;:

The suburb is named after a (fortification) named , on Ōhinerau / Mount Hobson. Remu-wera literally translates to &quot;burnt edge of kilt&quot;, commemorating the occasion where a chieftainess of Hauraki was allegedly captured and consumed. Although the most common definition in reference literature, the accuracy of this definition has been described as &quot;highly doubtful&quot;.

Around 1741, Te Wai-o-Hua iwi was driven away by the Ngāti Whātua and Te Taoū iwi. Later, these iwi merged with Te Roroa and Te Uri-o-Hau into Ngāti Whātua-o-Ōrākei, which is the main iwi on the Tāmaki isthmus. In May 1844 one of the largest Māori feasts ever held in New Zealand took place in Remuera. It was organised by the Waikato iwi and about 4000 Māori and many Pākehā (Europeans) were present. The festivities lasted for a week and large amounts of food and drinks were served: 11,000 baskets of potatoes, 9,000 sharks, 100 pigs, and large amounts of tea, tobacco and sugar. Governor Robert FitzRoy visited the festivities on 11 May 1844 when a haka was performed by 1,600 Māori, armed with guns and tomahawks.

When the European settlers wanted to buy the land on the Tāmaki isthmus from the Māori, they first declined. But in 1851, Henry Tacy Kemp, an interpreter to the Land Claims Commissioners, bought 700 acres for £5000. Subsequently, more plots of land were sold and put up for public auction. The land was suitable for pasture land and as the town of Auckland was some distance away people did not really start to build houses (as opposed to farmhouses) until the 1860s. One of the early farmer-settlers who bought land at Remuera was Archibald Clark, who became Auckland&#x27;s first mayor in 1851. Remuera was known as the garden suburb. Remuera was popular with the bourgeoisie as it provided much larger sections than other parts of Auckland. Many grand homes were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By the 1960s smaller sections started being developed.

Smaller suburban houses began appearing in the area nearest Newmarket and began to spread along Remuera Road. The first shops opened in 1890 at the intersection with Victoria Avenue. Railway stations at Newmarket and Market Road encouraged residents to commute to town. Likewise one of the most important routes for the electric tram system created in 1902 was to the Remuera shops, with an extension to the bottom of Victoria Avenue. One of the first businesses was L.J. Keys&#x27; grocery store on the Clonbern Road corner, which currently houses a café.

Remuera Road initially began as an unsealed cart track leading from Newmarket to Tāmaki. By the 1860s, the Remuera Road Board was formed to help administer the area surrounding the road, by organising roads, drainage, water and power, and the Remuera District School was established in 1873. In the early 1900s the Auckland electric tramway service began servicing Remuera Road, which led to the district doubling in population between 1901 and 1911 to over 5,000 residents. By the 1910s, ratepayers in the area opposed the Remuera area being administered separately to Auckland. The Remuera Ratepayers Association organised a petition in 1912, which included 791 ratepayers (over 50%) signing to join with the adjacent Auckland City, against the Remuera Road Board&#x27;s wishes. A commission of inquiry was appointed, which recommended amalgamation. Again the Road Board declined and it was only after the Department of Internal Affairs intervened that the Road Board gave in. The union was ratified in February 1915 and the 2,520 acres of Remuera became part of Auckland. J. Dempsey said that Auckland had received &quot;the brightest jewel in her crown today&quot;, although a subsequent report by the city engineer pointed out that Remuera had not been surveyed, it had 60 miles of primitive roading, and lacked proper stormwater drainage, sewerage and other services.

The 1920s and 1930s saw increased development of Remuera, with commercial precincts such as the Avenue Buildings, Coles Building, Hellaby Building and the Skeltons Building allowing the area to act as a commercial hub. The first mile of Remuera Road was concreted in 1921, and the existing tram line was doubled in 1924, followed by an extension of the service to Meadowbank. Auckland City Council embarked on a series of improvements for the new area. One of its first acts was to provide a free public library for the area in 1915, later replaced by the current building in 1926. In 1919 however local residents were incensed by the council&#x27;s building of public toilets at the Remuera shops that they demanded be torn down.

In 1927 the Remuera rugby league club reformed after initially forming in 1914 when former All Black and Kiwi, George A. Gillett coached the club. A year later in 1928, the Tudor Theatre cinema and dance hall opened, becoming a central part of Remuera social life for decades. The theatre closed in 1973, and after demolition the location became the Tudor Mall in 1980. In 1930, the electric tramway was extended from Remuera to Meadowbank.

In more recent history, the infamous Bassett Road machine gun murders took place in Remuera on 7 December 1963. Two men were shot with a .45 calibre Reising submachine gun at 115 Bassett Road and word quickly spread about a &quot;Chicago-style&quot; gang murder. Two suspects were sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Landmarks and features==

===Notable buildings and sites===
Remuera has several places of historic interest, some of which have been incorporated into the Remuera Heritage Walk.

* St Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church. This is a Selwyn church (wooden Gothic church) built in the 1860s by Philip Herapath replacing an earlier structure from 1848 by Frederick Thatcher. Consecrated by Bishop Selwyn. John Kinder was minister here at a time when this was a rural parish. Scoriarock foundations.
*St Mark&#x27;s Graveyard. The first burial was in 1849, and the last in 1963. The names of many well-known early Aucklanders appear here, including James Dilworth.
* Former Remuera Freemasons Hall, Remuera Road. Probably designed by the architect Henry G. Wade, the Hall was consecrated on 9 November 1880, at a ceremony presided over by the Deputy Grand Master of the Auckland Grand Lodge District (E.C.), William Lodder. The Remuera Masonic Hall survives as the oldest purpose-built lodge premises in the former Auckland Grand Lodge District (E.C.). Sold by the Freemasons in 1993.
* Saint Michael&#x27;s Catholic Church, 6 Beatrice Road. A large Italian Romanesque style church designed by the noted architects Tole and Massey. Opened on 1 October 1933. 
* St Luke&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, Remuera Road. Masonry Gothic church from 1932 replacing an 1874 wooden building. Designed by Francis Drummond Stewart who also designed the Chateau Tongariro (1928). The present church was modeled on the parish kirk in the Scottish mining village of Twechar, built in 1902. Reinforced concrete and brick construction, with an external cladding of Putāruru stone. The foundation stone was laid in 1931 by Miss Sarah Dingwall.
* King&#x27;s School, 258 Remuera Road. King&#x27;s College started in 1896 occupying the house called &quot;The Tower&quot;, built for David Graham, brother of the founder of Ellerslie, Robert Graham.

* The Remuera Library. Designed by the Auckland architects Gummer and Ford, the library was built in 1928 in a neo-Georgian style reminiscent of American colonial architecture. Faced with red brick, this building has very fine details, especially around the windows.

Other special buildings in Remuera are the Remuera Railway Station and Signal Box. These were built in 1907–1908 and the station is the best preserved in Auckland. Whilst the other stations were regularly modernised, Remuera&#x27;s has been kept almost in its original state and is still used for suburban passenger trains.
===Arney Road===
Arney Road has always been a coveted location due to its location being both near the city and sea shore and providing views of the Hauraki Gulf. In 1906 it was described as:
The road itself is wide with large trees lining the berm. The buildings on Arney Road are from the 19th, 20th, and 21st century with seven of these having registration with Heritage New Zealand. Notable buildings along Arney Road include: 9 Arney Road, a large Edwardian home; 11 Arney Road, a category 1 building designed in the Arts and Crafts style; 27 Arney Road, a category 2 building designed in the Arts and Crafts style; 43 Arney Road, St Ann&#x27;s is a category 2 English country cottage; 51 Arney Road, a neo-Georgian home; 91 Arney Road, Vernon Brown House, a category 1 building and former home of Vernon Brown; 30 Arney Road, Stansfield House, category 2 Arts and Crafts home; 34 Arney Road, Court House, a category 2 neo-Georgian residence; 85 Arney Road, Cox House, category 2 Arts and Crafts house.
===Nature areas===

Remuera includes some interesting nature areas and parks. Unlike the rest of the isthmus of Auckland, which was largely void of large trees and covered with native grass, flax and manuka, Remuera retained patches of native bush and woodland.

The Ōrākei Basin, a tidal lagoon popular for water sport activities, is the submerged crater of a volcano. There is a 3 km public walkway around the basin whereby the flora and fauna of the area can be observed at close hand.

Mount Hobson Domain includes the volcanic cone, previously used as a pā (a defended settlement) by the Māori and in later times as a quarry and pasture land. Ōhinerau / Mount Hobson (143m high) is one of Auckland&#x27;s better preserved and least modified volcanic cones. Formed some 25,000 years ago, the volcanic hill has a horse-shoe shaped crater opening to the southwest. Terraces and pits are still evident from the Maori occupation. Like the other volcanic hills of the Auckland isthmus, in the 20th century, water reservoirs were built on the summit and the lower southwest side a water reservoir was incorporated into Ōhinerau / Mount Hobson to supply water to the surrounding area. Still evident on the south-east side of the mountain is the concrete base remnant of a WWII medical store for the US Navy Mobile Hospital in nearby Market Rd – a site now occupied by the Dilworth Junior School. As you walk up the path from the entrance, you will soon come to a stone seat – a memorial to Remuera boys who died in WWII. This overlooks a field of jonquils and daffodils which bloom in winter or early spring.

Waiatarua Reserve. To the south of Remuera Road lies Waiatarua Reserve. This is a natural basin, prone to seasonal flooding. On several 19th century maps this was shown as a lake and referred to as &#x27;Lake Remuera&#x27;, &#x27;Lake St John&#x27; or &#x27;Lake Waiatarua&#x27; although in reality it was largely an area of swampy ground in which a sheet of shallow water would appear sporadically in the wet season. In 1918, of this land was given to the City Council to create Waiatarua Reserve. As the surrounding farm land was transformed into suburban housing this area became problematic – although in theory the &quot;lake&quot; afforded a picturesque view for the new houses, it was also a breeding ground for mosquitos. Moreover, the basin was composed of a peat-like substance subject to smouldering fires which were difficult to put out. In 1929 a drain was bored through the hill to the south west enabling the water to be drained into the adjacent natural stream which feeds into the nearby Ōrākei Basin; this drainage system is still in place. In 1934, of the park were leased to the Remuera Golf Club and a course was laid out. The clubhouse was completed in 1935. In 1938 a new course was built around the original layout in response to members’ complaints about the course conditions. In 1968 the Course was redesigned by golf course specialist Harold Babbage and a new Club House built.

==Politics==
Remuera is a part of the Epsom electorate for the Parliamentary representation. Local government of Remuera is the responsibility of the Ōrākei Local Board, which also includes the suburbs of Ōrākei, Mission Bay, Kohimarama, St Heliers, Glendowie, St Johns, Meadowbank, and Ellerslie. Remuera is also a part of the Ōrākei ward. Prior to it falling under Epsom, Remuera itself was an electorate from 1938 to 1996.

==Remuera Golf Club==
The Remuera Golf Club started to develop in 1934 and the club house was finished in 1935. It was not an ideal location for a golf club, as it was established in a natural basin prone to seasonal flooding. In fact on several 19th century maps this was actually shown as a lake and referred to as &#x27;Lake Remuera&#x27; or &#x27;Lake St John&#x27; although in reality it was largely an area of swampy ground in which a sheet of shallow water would appear sporadically in the wet season. of land in the gully was given to the City Council in 1918 as Waiatarua Reserve. As the surrounding farm land was transformed into suburban housing this area became problematic – although the &quot;lake&quot; afforded a picturesque view for the new houses it was also a breeding ground for mosquitos. Moreover, the basin was composed of a peat-like substance subject to smouldering fires which were difficult to put out. In 1929 a drain was bored through the hill to the south west enabling the water to be drained into the adjacent natural stream which feeds into the nearby Oraki Basin; this drainage system is still in place.

Fifty acres of the park were leased to the Golf Club in 1934 and a course was laid out. In 1938 a new course was built around the original layout in response to members’ complaints about the course conditions. In 1968 the Course was redesigned by golf course specialist Harold Babbage and a new Club House has been built.

== Connections==
Remuera&#x27;s reputation as a desirable residential area around the turn of the 20th century was reflected in the use of its name for a luxury liner. SS &quot;Remuera&quot; was a steamship launched in 1911. She was the last delivered of three 11000 tonners built by the William Denny Organization between 1909 and 1911 for the New Zealand Shipping Company (sister ships &quot;Ruahine&quot; and &quot;Rotorua&quot;). Her inaugural voyage in 1911 was from London to Wellington. In September 1914 she was the first British ship to pass through the newly complete Panama Canal.

During the First War she was commandeered by the British Government. After the war she returned to the UK to New Zealand route, as a sign of the changing times she was now refitted to accommodate two classes of passengers as opposed to her initial layout of First, Second and Steerage. Again commandeered at the outbreak of war in 1939 she was torpedoed in the North Sea in September 1940.

<text>Fort McAllister State Park is a Georgia state park located near Keller and Richmond Hill in south Bryan County, Georgia and on the south bank of the Ogeechee River (some parts of the park border the Atlantic Ocean). It is roughly ten miles south of Savannah. The park is home to Fort McAllister, the best-preserved earthwork fortification of the Confederacy. Though the earthworks were attacked unsuccessfully seven times by Union soldiers, it did not fall until it was taken by General Sherman in 1864 during his March to the Sea. The park, located on the coast, is nestled among giant live oaks and a large salt marsh. In addition, the park contains a museum specializing in Civil War artifacts. The fort was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

<doc id="1211825" wikidata="Q558764" url="?curid=1211825" title="Eugene Stoner">
<text>Eugene Morrison Stoner (November 22, 1922 – April 24, 1997) was an American machinist and firearms designer who is most associated with the development of the ArmaLite AR-15 rifle that was redesigned and modified by Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearm Company for the United States military as the M16 rifle.

==Early life==
Stoner was born in Gosport, Indiana, on November 22, 1922. He moved to Long Beach, California where he graduated from Long Beach Polytechnical High School. In 1939, after the Depression, there was not enough money for him to attend college, so he went to work as a machinist for Vega Aircraft Company, the forerunner of what became Lockheed Airplane Company (now the Lockheed Martin Corporation).

During World War II, he enlisted for Aviation Ordnance in the U.S. Marine Corps and served in the South Pacific and northern China. In the Corps, he had his first experience of working with heavy-caliber automatic weapons as an armourer. The work experience and combat training served him throughout his weapons designing career.

==Engineer==
In late 1945 Stoner began working in the machine shop for Whittaker, an aircraft equipment company, and ultimately became a Design Engineer.

In 1954 he came to work as chief engineer for ArmaLite, a division of Fairchild Engine &amp; Airplane Corporation. While at ArmaLite, he designed a series of prototype small arms, including the AR-3, AR-9, AR-11, and AR-12, none of which saw significant production. Their only real success during this period was the AR-5 survival rifle, which was adopted by the United States Air Force.

The Stoner bolt and carrier piston system is a widely known gas system designed by Eugene Stoner. The patent for the gas operated bolt and carrier system was filed in 1956 by ArmaLite for use in the AR-10, which was later developed into the ArmaLite AR-15, M16 rifle and M4 carbine. It is commonly called a direct impingement system, but it does not utilize a conventional direct impingement system. In , the designer states: ″This invention is a true expanding gas system instead of the conventional impinging gas system.″ Gas is routed from a port in the barrel through a gas tube, directly to a chamber inside the bolt carrier. The bolt within the bolt carrier is fitted with piston rings to contain the gas. In effect, the bolt and carrier act as a gas piston and cylinder. The subtleties involved in ArmaLite&#x27;s patent on the gas system significantly diverge from classical direct impingement; upon firing, the pressurized propellant gasses exit the barrel via the gas port and travel the length of the gas tube, but instead of simply applying the inertia necessary to cycle the weapon directly to the bolt carrier, the gas is funneled inside the bolt carrier wherein the increase in pressure results in the bolt itself acting as a piston, forcing the bolt carrier away from the barrel face.

The Stoner bolt and carrier piston system is ammunition specific, since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the weapon to various propellant and projectile or barrel length specific pressure behavior. It provides a very symmetric design that allows straight line movement of the operating components. This allows recoil forces to drive straight to the rear. Instead of connecting or other mechanical parts driving the system, high pressure gas performs this function, reducing the weight of moving parts and the rifle as a whole. The straight-line recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action, and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer.

In 1955, Stoner completed initial design work on the revolutionary ArmaLite AR-10, a lightweight (3.29 kg (7.25 lb)) select-fire infantry rifle in 7.62×51mm NATO caliber. Besides featuring the Stoner bolt and carrier piston system, the AR-10 stock was in line with the bore to reduce muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire. Because recoil does not significantly shift the point of aim, faster follow-up shots are possible, and user fatigue is reduced. The AR-10 was submitted for rifle evaluation trials to the US Army&#x27;s Aberdeen Proving Ground late in 1956. In comparison with competing rifle designs previously submitted for evaluation, the AR-10 was smaller, easier to fire in automatic, and much lighter. However, it arrived very late in the testing cycle, and the army rejected the AR-10 in favor of the more conventional T44, which became the M14. The AR-10&#x27;s design was later licensed to the Dutch firm of Artillerie Inrichtingen, which produced the AR-10 until 1960 for sale to various military forces.

At the request of the U.S. military, Stoner&#x27;s chief assistant, Robert Fremont along with Jim Sullivan designed the Armalite AR-15 from the basic AR-10 model, scaling it down to fire the small-caliber .223 Remington cartridge. The AR-15 was later adopted by United States military forces as the M16 rifle.

After ArmaLite sold the rights to the AR-15 to the Colt Firearms Company, Stoner turned his attention to the AR-16 design. This was another advanced 7.62 mm rifle but used a more conventional short-stroke piston and a number of stamped parts to reduce cost. This weapon saw only prototype development, but adaptation to .223 Remington resulted in the somewhat successful and often imitated Armalite AR-18.

Stoner left ArmaLite in 1961 to serve as a consultant for Colt. He eventually accepted a position with Cadillac Gage where he designed the Stoner 63 Weapons System.

This was a modular weapons system which could be reconfigured to be a standard automatic rifle, a light machine gun, a medium machine gun, or a solenoid-fired fixed machine gun.

The Stoner Weapons System used a piston-operated gas impingement system patented as and granted in September 1960. Once again, Robert Fremont and Jim Sullivan took a Stoner rifle and redesigned it for the .223 Remington cartridge, to create the Stoner 63 Weapons System.
Stoner then worked with TRW by designing the TRW 6425 25 mm &quot;Bushmaster&quot; auto cannon, which was later manufactured by Oerlikon-Bührle as the Oerlikon KBA 25mm.

He co-founded ARES Incorporated of Port Clinton, Ohio, in 1972, but left the company in 1989, after designing the Ares Light Machine Gun, sometimes known as the Stoner 86. It was an evolved version of the Stoner 63. At Ares, he also designed the Future Assault Rifle Concept (FARC).

In 1990, he joined Knight&#x27;s Armament Company (KAC) to create the Stoner Rifle-25 (SR-25), which currently sees military service as the United States Navy Mark 11 Mod 0 Sniper Weapon System. While at KAC, he also worked on yet another version of the Stoner Weapons System, called the Stoner 96. Among his last designs were the SR-50 rifle and the Colt 2000.

==Meeting with Kalashnikov==
On May 16, 1990, Stoner and Mikhail Kalashnikov, inventor of the AK-47 and its derivatives, met for the first time. They spent the next few days talking, sharing stories, shopping, going out to dinner and touring Washington D.C. They visited the Smithsonian Institution, the NRA&#x27;s National Firearms Museum, and a hunting lodge owned by the gun club at Star Tannery, where they went shooting. They also visited the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, where they watched new weapons being tested. During this short visit, both men, intimately familiar with the other&#x27;s work, shared a common bond and became friends, &quot;not needing an interpreter to get their thoughts across.&quot;

==Death==

Eugene Stoner died of cancer at the age of 74 on April 24, 1997, and was interred in the Quantico National Cemetery, Quantico, Virginia.
He was survived by his wife, Barbara Hitt Stoner, whom he married in 1965; his first wife, Jean Stoner Mahony of Newport Beach, California, from whom he was divorced in 1962; four children from his first marriage, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Barbara Hitt Stoner died at her home in Plymouth, Michigan on February 17, 2022, and was interred with her husband.

<text>hping is an open-source packet generator and analyzer for the TCP/IP protocol created by Salvatore Sanfilippo (also known as Antirez).
It is one of the common tools used for security auditing and testing of firewalls and networks, and was used to exploit the idle scan scanning technique (also invented by the hping author), and now implemented in the Nmap Security Scanner. The new version of hping, hping3, is scriptable using the Tcl language and implements an engine for string based, human-readable description of TCP/IP packets so that the programmer can write scripts related to low level TCP/IP packet manipulation and analysis in a short time.

<text>The Honda CR-V (also sold as the Honda Breeze in China since 2019) is a compact crossover SUV manufactured by Japanese automaker Honda since 1995. Initial models of the CR-V were built using the same platform as the Civic.

Honda began producing the CR-V in Sayama, Japan, and Swindon, United Kingdom, for worldwide markets, adding North American manufacturing sites in East Liberty, Ohio, United States, in 2007; El Salto, Jalisco, Mexico, in late 2007 (ended in early 2017); Alliston, Ontario, Canada, in 2012; and Greensburg, Indiana, United States, in February 2017. The CR-V is also produced in Wuhan for the Chinese market by Dongfeng Honda, and also marketed as the Breeze in China for the version produced at Guangzhou by Guangqi Honda.

Honda states that &quot;CR-V&quot; stands for &quot;Comfortable Runabout Vehicle,&quot; while the term &quot;Compact Recreational Vehicle&quot; is used in a British car review article that was republished by Honda, associating the model name with the Sports Utility Vehicle abbreviation of SU-V.

, the CR-V is positioned between the smaller ZR-V (marketed as HR-V in North America) — with which the CR-V shares a platform — and the larger North American market Passport/Pilot or the Chinese market Avancier/UR-V. It is currently Honda&#x27;s best-selling vehicle in the world, and the second best-selling SUV globally in 2020.


== First generation (1995) ==
The first generation CR-V or RD1 was Honda&#x27;s first in-house designed sport utility vehicle by Hiroyuki Kawase. When the CR-V was introduced in Japan in October 1995 it was sold only at Honda Verno and Honda Primo dealerships and exceeded Japanese government&#x27;s compact car regulations regarding exterior dimensions (maximum width of , therefore incurred a more expensive annual road tax obligation. For the North American market, it was displayed at the 1996 Chicago Auto Show and went on sale in February 1997.

Upon introduction, the model had only one trim level, which would later be known as the LX model trim; it was powered by the 2.0-litre straight-four B20B producing at 5400rpm and of torque at 4800rpm. Outer dimensions for this engine would be identical to the Integra&#x27;s 1.8L engine, but internally the engine had a larger bore vs for the Integra, to add the extra displacement needed to produce more torque. The engine used a one-piece cylinder sleeve construction unique from any other B-series engine. The chassis and suspension was largely similar to the 4th-Gen Honda Civic Shuttle (Wagon) with a unibody design with fully independent suspension. The vehicle&#x27;s suspension was double-wishbone, while the rear used a trailing arm-based multilink system. Inside, the rear seats were able to fold down, and a picnic table was stowed in the rear floor area. All models featured plastic cladding covering the front bumper, rear bumper, and fender wells. In most countries, CR-Vs had a chrome grille; however, in the United States, the grille was made out of the same black plastic as the bumpers. The EX included anti-lock brakes and 15-inch alloy wheels over the LX trim. Drivetrain options were front-wheel drive or Honda&#x27;s Real Time AWD.

Indonesian market CR-V was released in 1999 as a locally assembled model. Honda customized the model for sale to include a face-to-face third-row seating, making it a seven-seater vehicle to take advantage of the tax regulations in the country. The rear foglamp was also reconfigured as a fourth and fifth brake light.

===Facelift===
In 1999, for the 2000 model year, the European, Australian and Asian CR-V models featured more drastic changes. Exterior alterations included a new front bumper, smoothed off rear bumper, and a smaller plastic radio antenna on the rear of the roof. &quot;Nighthawk Black&quot; was added to the list of paint choices, while &quot;Passion Orange&quot; disappeared. New dark blue pearl and red pearl shades replaced the former solid red and metallic blue hues. European models received an enlarged Honda emblem on the front grille, and a new metallic yellow paint in certain markets.

The engine was changed to the 2.0L B20Z engine, producing at 6,200rpm and of torque at 4,500rpm. This improved performance for the vehicle. Fuel economy of city/ highway (US) and price were not affected by the increase in power, which was the result of a higher compression ratio (9.6:1 compared to the B20B&#x27;s 8.8:1), a new intake manifold, and slightly higher lift on the intake valves. This 16 percent increase in power resulted to a faster 0-60 mph of 8.6 seconds on the 5-speed manual 4wd.

In 2000, an SE (Special Edition) model was introduced in North America. The SE featured body-coloured bumpers and side moldings, a body-coloured hard spare tire cover, leather upholstery, CD/cassette audio deck, rear privacy glass, and chrome grille accent. Until 2001, the CR-V sold more than any other vehicle in its class. The North American models also received new exterior colours including Naples Gold Metallic and Taffeta White. Electron Blue was introduced in 2000 to replace Submarine Blue Pearl, while Satin Silver Metallic replaced Sebring Silver Metallic in 2001. However, that year, sales of the Ford Escape and its clone, the Mazda Tribute, surpassed those of the CR-V.

The Australian higher specification model was called the &quot;Sport&quot;. It was added at the time of the first facelift and included body-coloured bumpers, mirrors, door handles, and hard rear spare wheel cover. It also included alloy wheels, roof rails, and a large glass sunroof. The CR-V became the country&#x27;s best-selling SUV in 2000, outselling the Toyota Land Cruiser for the first time.

===Safety===
The 1997–2001 model tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) was the LX model with standard driver and passenger airbags. The car&#x27;s structure received an acceptable rating, and the overall car received a marginal rating — as the dummy&#x27;s left leg would have been broken. In addition to this lower body injury, the dummy&#x27;s head went through the airbag which may have caused a minor concussion. The chest was well protected.

Models equipped with an automatic transmission now had an overdrive cancel button that allowed the driver to lock the transmission in the first three gears to provide power for passing and climbing grades along with providing hill assist when stationary, known as &quot;Grade Logic.&quot; The pattern of the cloth on the seats was also redesigned, and the head restraints earned an acceptable rating from the IIHS for whiplash protection.

=== Engines ===

== Second generation (2001) ==

The second generation CR-V, which went on sale on November 12, 2001 was a full redesign, based on the seventh generation Civic, and powered by the K24A1 engine, or the K20A4 engine in South East Asia. Southeast Asian models produced of power and while the North American versions of the new engine produced and of torque. Per new SAE regulations, the same North American K24A1 engine is now rated at and . The new CR-V retained the fuel economy of the previous model because of the i-VTEC system. The new chassis had increased torsional and bending rigidity, the suspension included front toe control link MacPherson struts and a rear reactive-link double wishbone; the compact rear suspension increased cargo space to . The second generation CR-V was &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Best Small SUV for 2002 and 2003.

Second generation CR-Vs in countries outside of North America were again offered in both &quot;low specification&quot; and &quot;high specification&quot; variants, with the latter featuring body-coloured bumpers and fittings. It also now did not require the glass hatch to be opened before the swinging door. Changes between model years 2002, 2003, and 2004 were minor, involving an enlargement of the centre compartment bin and the addition of a front passenger door power lock in the latter two years respectively. The Honda FR-V was based upon the second generation CR-V.

In China, a clone from Shuanghuan Auto, called the Laibao S-RV, became a centre of a design rights controversy, because the latter appeared to be a blatant copy of Honda&#x27;s design.

===Facelift===
In 2004, for the 2005 model year, the CR-V received a mid-cycle refresh. New 16-inch wheels replaced the previous 15-inch versions. Changes included new taillights and headlights with clear indicators and two separate H1 bulbs for low beams and high beams, the previous setup used H4 single bulb for both low and high beams. The taillights now used clear lenses instead of amber for the turning indicators. The grille was also changed; it had two horizontal bars instead of one. The front bumper design was slightly changed, it now has round fog lights compared to the previous trapezium fog lights and in addition the lower grill had two horizontal bars instead of one. The rear bumper reflectors were longer and narrower.

On the inside of the car, the EX trim received standard upgrades which included steering wheel-mounted audio controls, an outside temperature monitor and also an electric sunroof. The stereo system was also XM Satellite Radio ready in US-market vehicles. All CR-V models also received redesigned rear seat headrests, intended to improve rear visibility.

Mechanically, the 2005 model was also changed. A drive-by-wire throttle was implemented for all CR-Vs. The all-wheel drive system&#x27;s engagement threshold was altered for improved response. US market models were equipped with a five-speed automatic, as opposed to the previous four-speed automatic.

In the United States and Canada, all 2005 MY and later CR-Vs have anti-lock brakes, electronic brake force distribution, traction control and Vehicle Stability Assist, front seat-mounted side airbags, and side-curtain airbags with rollover sensors for all occupants.

In Australia, the MY05 facelift went on sale in late 2004. Base models made do with only dual airbags and ABS as standard equipment, while the Sport came equipped with side airbags for the first time. Curtain airbags were unavailable on any model, until the next generation.

Following the tradition of adding a trim level above the EX during the refresh like the first generation CR-V, Honda added the SE trim level for the 2005 CR-V. The CR-V SE featured painted bumpers, body side molding, and hard, body-coloured spare tire cover. Honda introduced leather seats for the first time to the CR-V with this trim, as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated side mirrors, and front seats.

===Australia===
This iteration of CR-V arrived in Australia in January 2002, and initially came in separate guises, consisting that of the &quot;Base&quot; &amp; &quot;Sport&quot;. The &quot;CR-V&quot; (or &quot;Base&quot;), consisted of, but not limited to, dual front airbags, air conditioning, power windows and mirrors, as well as a CD player. Building upon &quot;CR-V&quot; specification, The Sport added ABS, Cruise Control, a sunroof, 15 inch alloy wheels, front foglights, as well as body coloured bumpers and mirrors. Consistently selling very well within the Medium SUV segment within the previous generation, amassing over 40,000 units between 1997 and 2001, the second generation continued its success, with it becoming the best selling SUV in 2002, selling over 12,000 units.

Several &quot;Special Edition&quot; models were released, beginning in 2003. The &quot;Winter Classic&quot; &amp; &quot;Sport Winter Classic&quot; were sold in Winter/Spring 2003. Building upon the &quot;Base&quot;, Winter Classic added alloy wheels, side steps, as well as a tow bar, while the Sport Winter Classic gained roof racks, nudge bar and foglights, however, did without the towbar. Later within this iteration, in 2005, an SE model was launched, featuring rear parking sensors, nudge bar and 16&#x27; alloy wheels. It was sold between October and November 2005. Running throughout 2006, the CR-V &quot;Extra&quot; brought with it 16 inch alloy wheels and side airbags.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, the second-generation CR-V was released in 2002. The vehicle was reconfigured to seat 10 people, with 3 in front, 4 in the second row, and 3 in the third row to take advantage of the tax regulations in the country at the time which allows a 10-seater vehicle to be classified as a &quot;mass transport van&quot;, therefore exempt from excise tax. The 10-seater configuration also allowed the vehicle to compete with Asian utility vehicles (AUV), while 5-seater and 8-seater variants are also available. It was produced locally at the factory in Santa Rosa, Laguna with 63 percent of local content. In its 4-year production run, Honda sold 20,886 units of the second-generation CR-V in the Philippines.

=== Engines === 
== Third generation (2006) ==


The third generation CR-V went on sale in the U.S. in late September 2006 for the 2007 model year. Portions of the body structure, drivetrain, and suspension were carried over from the previous model, while both interior and exterior styling elements were changed significantly. The CR-V now featured a rear liftgate and bottom-side spare tire mount rather than a side-opening rear door and door-mounted spare.

The third generation CR-V is powered by Honda&#x27;s standard K-series 2.4L inline-four engine. In North American markets, this engine&#x27;s power is rated at at 5,800rpm and at 4,200rpm. A 2.2L i-CTDI diesel engine was offered in the European and Asian markets. The European market CR-V had the R20A 2.0L gasoline engine, based on the Honda R-series i-VTEC SOHC engine found in the Honda Civic, as opposed to the previous CR-V offering the K20A.

===Facelift===

In 2009 for the 2010 model year in North America, the CR-V received design, powertrain and equipment changes. Changes included a redesigned front fascia with a new horizontal-slat chrome grille and honeycomb-designed lower front grille, new front bumper, and revised tail lights. The rear bumper was redesigned, as well as new alloy wheels. The interior received minor changes, including seat fabrics, as well as wider driver and front-passenger armrests. The audio head unit controls were altered and the information display backlighting in the gauges was changed to blue, instead of the previous black.

=== Engine ===

== Fourth generation (2011) ==
The CR-V Concept debuted at the Orange County International Auto Show in September 2011, the production 2012 CR-V debuted at the 2011 Los Angeles Auto Show. The CR-V went on sale in the U.S. on 15 December 2011.

It is powered by a 2.4-litre i-VTEC inline-four engine that puts out 185hp and 163 pound-feet (220 Nm) of torque at 4,400 rpm along with an all-new Real-Time all-wheel-drive (AWD) with intelligent control system. All North American CR-Vs come equipped with a 5-speed automatic transmission.

===Facelift===

The facelifted 2015 model year CR-V went on sale during October 2014. The CR-V uses the direct injected Earth Dreams engine and continuously variable transmission (CVT) combination first introduced on the ninth generation Accord, EPA estimated fuel economy is improved +4/+3/+3 mpg (city/highway/combined). The structure has been modified to improve crash performance, particularly in the IIHS&#x27;s small offset crash test. The suspension shock absorbers, springs, anti-roll bars and lower control arms are also revised to improve ride performance, while a reduced 15.6:1 steering gear ratio and larger brake booster gives it a sportier feel.

=== Engines ===

== Fifth generation (2016) ==
The fifth generation CR-V was unveiled on 13 October 2016 in Detroit. Sales began in the U.S. on 21 December 2016 as a 2017 model year. It uses the same Honda compact global platform introduced on the tenth generation Civic. Honda began producing the CR-V at East Liberty, Ohio (ELP) in November 2016 and at Greensburg, Indiana (HMIN) during February 2017. It is available with an optional 7-seater variant in markets other than North America.

In October 2019, Guangqi Honda in China began marketed the model with a different styling as the Honda Breeze () which was sold alongside the international facelift version CR-V produced by Dongfeng Honda.

=== Facelift ===

Honda unveiled a refreshed CR-V in September 2019 for the 2020 model year, initially for the North American market. For the first time in North America, the refreshed model introduced a hybrid powertrain as an option. Additionally, the CR-V&#x27;s suite of advanced safety features are standard on every trim level, meaning even the most affordable CR-V provides adaptive cruise control and the latest crash prevention technology.

== Sixth generation (2022) ==
The sixth-generation CR-V was unveiled on 12 July 2022 in Los Angeles, California, with sales commenced in U.S in September 2022 as a 2023 model year. It is based on the Honda Architecture platform which underpins the eleventh-generation Civic. The CR-V is available with 5 and 7-seater configurations which varies by market.
GAC Honda in China marketed the model as the Honda Breeze in December 2022, which features different front and rear fascias. The plant that produces the sixth-generation CR-V for Dongfeng Honda, is responsible for the exports of the CR-V models sold in Europe which commenced in June 2023.

<text>Swattenden is a small settlement in the parish of Cranbrook and Sissinghurst in England. 

It is situated on the B2086 (Swattenden Lane) about from Hartley, where the A229 crosses the settlement. It has an agricultural/country shop, a fruit farm and a fishing centre.
==Swattenden House==
Swattenden House is a mansion built in 1860. It was the site of Swattenden Secondary School for Boys which moved to Angley School in 1972. It then became the &quot;Swattenden Centre&quot;, a Kent County Council residential education centre, in 1976. It was used to house asylum seekers for a number of years.

==Toponymy==
The suffix &quot;-enden&quot; is found in many place names in the Kentish Weald, meaning the pasture or clearing in the forest belonging to the people of a named person. Here the person was called &quot;Swaeðel&quot;. In 1240, the Old English &quot;Swaeðeling denn&quot;, was written as &quot;Swetlingdenn&quot;, in 1260 it was spelled &quot;Swetlyngdenne&quot; and in 1305 &quot;Swethyngden&quot;.

<doc id="1211847" wikidata="Q2044607" url="?curid=1211847" title="Pennsylvania Railroad class T1">
<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) class T1 duplex-drive 4-4-4-4 steam locomotives, introduced in 1942 with two prototypes and later in 1945-1946 with 50 production examples, were the last steam locomotives built for the PRR and arguably its most controversial. They were ambitious, technologically sophisticated, powerful, fast and distinctively streamlined by Raymond Loewy. However, they were also prone to wheelslip both when starting and at speed, in addition to being complicated to maintain and expensive to run. The PRR decided in 1948 to place diesel locomotives on all express passenger trains, leaving unanswered questions as to whether the T1&#x27;s flaws were solvable, especially taking into account that the two prototypes did not have the problems inherent to the production units. 

An article appearing in a 2008 issue of the Pennsylvania Railroad Technical and Historical Society Magazine showed that inadequate training for engineers transitioning to the T1 may have led to excessive throttle applications, resulting in driver slippage. Another root cause of wheelslip was faulty &quot;spring equalization&quot;: The stiffnesses of the springs supporting the locomotive over the axles were not adjusted to properly equalize the wheel-to-track forces. The drivers were equalized together but not equalized with the engine truck. In the production fleet the PRR equalized the engine truck with the front engine and the trailing truck with the rear engine, which helped to solve the wheelslip problem.

==Development==
Before the T1, the last production express passenger engine the PRR had produced was the K4s of 1914, produced until 1928. Two experimental enlarged K5 locomotives were produced in 1929, but they weren&#x27;t considered enough of an improvement to be worthwhile. After that, the PRR&#x27;s attention switched to electrification and the production of electric locomotives; apparently, the railroad decided that it did not need more steam locomotives.

However, the deficiencies of the K4s became more evident during the 1930s. The locomotives performed well, but as train lengths increased they proved to be underpowered; double-headed K4s locomotives became the norm on many trains. The railroad had many locomotives available, but paying two crews on two locomotives per train was expensive. Meanwhile, other railroads were leaping ahead, developing increasingly powerful passenger train locomotives. Rival New York Central built 4-6-4 Hudsons, while other roads developed passenger 4-8-2 &quot;Mountain&quot; type and then 4-8-4 &quot;Northern&quot; type designs. The PRR&#x27;s steam power began to look outdated.

The PRR began to develop steam locomotives again in the mid-to-late 1930s, but with a difference. Where previous PRR locomotive policy had been conservative, new radical designs took hold. Designers from the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the PRR&#x27;s longtime development partner, were eager to prove the viability of steam in the face of new competition from diesel-electric locomotives. They persuaded the railroad to adopt Baldwin&#x27;s latest idea: the duplex locomotive. This split the locomotive&#x27;s driving wheels into two sets, each with its own pair of cylinders and rods. Until then, the only locomotives with two sets of drivers were articulated locomotives, but the duplex used one rigid frame. In a duplex design cylinders could be smaller, and the weight of side and main rods could be drastically reduced. Given that the movement of the main rod could not be fully balanced, the duplex design would reduce the &quot;hammer blow&quot; on the track. The lower reciprocating mass meant that higher speeds could be achieved. Spreading the power across four smaller cylinders, rather than two large cylinders, could also yield greater sustained power at higher speeds. Use of poppet valves also gave longer duration for admission and exhaustion of steam compared with piston valves. The arrangement of the Franklin System of Steam Distribution also yielded finer cutoff control. One set of valves admits steam during a cylinder stroke, while a different set exhaust steam, the respective valves being shut during the other&#x27;s part of the cycle. The system further accommodates the expansive properties of steam by having the exhaust ports and valves larger (6 in.) than the intake ports (5 in.). However, there was a drawback of the metallurgy used; the poppet valve could not withstand the stress of sustained high-speed operation (meaning over on production T1s).

The first PRR duplex was the single experimental S1 No. 6100 of 1939. It managed to reach 100.97 miles per hour (162.50 km/h) on level track while pulling a 1,350-ton passenger train. Its performance encouraged the PRR to continue to develop duplex steam locomotives. The S1 was built unnecessarily large for her exhibition at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair until October 1940; therefore, its turning radius prohibited it from operating over most of the PRR network. The 6-4-4-6 design reduced driving set traction to the point that it was especially prone to wheel slip; thus only one Class S1 was built. The PRR returned to Baldwin to develop a duplex design fit for series production. The desire to create a locomotive with comparable power to that of the GG1 remained, though the anticipated range changed. The next duplexes would have a far greater capacity of coal in comparison to water.

The PRR ordered two Baldwin prototypes (Nos.  6110 and 6111) at a cost of $600,000 on June 26, 1940. Both prototypes had numerous teething problems and were prone to wheelslip if not handled carefully by the engineer, but favorable test reports resulted in a production order for 50 T1s, split between the PRR&#x27;s own Altoona Works and Baldwin. On December 20, 1944, the PRR Board authorized the purchase of 50 Class T1 locomotives for $14,125,000 ($282,500 per unit, equal to $ each today). Baldwin&#x27;s chief designer, Ralph P. Johnson, was responsible for the mechanical aspects of the new T1 class. Designer Raymond Loewy obtained US Patent D 136,260 for an early T1 conceptual design with a high-mounted cab located over the forward driving set. While that suited Baldwin&#x27;s objective of making the most distinctive steam locomotive possible, practical considerations led the T1 design to be revised to the conventional cab position with a slight modification of the unique nose design included in Loewy&#x27;s patent. Raymonds distinctive design of the T1 heavily influenced other engines, most notably the South Australian Railways 520 class. In late 1942 Islington Railway Workshops&#x27;s chief engineer Frank Hugh Harrison saw the T1 in an american magazine whilst designing the 520 class. Frank was impressed, and the streamlining of the T1 became the basis of the design. The 520 class construction pace was then increased to come out before the T1 to avoid patent claims. 

The last production T1 (no. 5549) entered service on August 27, 1946. Engine no. 5539 developed , as tested between September 11, 1946, and September 14, 1946, by Chesapeake and Ohio Railway dynamometer car DM-1 while on loan to C&amp;O. In 1944 no. 6110, tested on the stationary test plant in Altoona, developed in the cylinders at . No in-house tests were made with a dynomometer, but estimates from the Altoona test rated 6110&#x27;s drawbar pull at 4,100 horsepower at 100
mph. No prior class of steam locomotives in numbers could develop over 4,000 drawbar horsepower at this speed, while the only class which could match this figure was the later New York Central Niagaras. 

==Nos. 6110 &amp; 6111==
Following Delivery, the prototypes were placed in limited service between Harrisburg and Chicago. Both engines held 100 mph with upwards of 13 cars, while their tenders allowed travel over the entire 713 miles route with only one stop for coal in Millbrook, Ohio. Water stops were unnecessary due to the PRR&#x27;s use of track pans. The futuristic streamlining lead to the new engines earning the nicknames Flash Gordon (6110), and Buck Rogers (6111). The &#x27;Sharknose&#x27; monicker applied to the later production engines and subsequent Baldwin diesel units wasn&#x27;t widely used, though a December 1942 article of the Times Leader refers to the T1&#x27;s as Land Dreadnaughts. The aggressive angles of the smokebox prow and accompanying portholes on the lower sides give the impression of an ocean vessel.

The internals of the locomotive&#x27;s front end could be likened to an automobile, outside of the Sharknose styling. The shrouding over the pilot was higher than on the S1. Along with fixtures such as the air compressor and main reservoir, this &quot;hood&quot; also contained a gearbox housing the main reciprocating motion of the valve gear. The arrangement was essentially a miniaturized version of conventional valve gear, with each cylinder&#x27;s motion actuated by the opposite crosshead, similar to Young valve gear. Also placed under the hood was an air horn, positioned similarly to that of the S1, for added auditory warning at high speeds. The Pennsylvania passenger-standard 3-chime steam whistle was also used. A Trains Magazine article from 1942 details a run of 6111 with the eastbound &quot;Juniata&quot; with the Pittsburgh Division engineer using the horn, and the Middle Division engineer using the whistle.

Problems were encountered with poor steaming, placement of sanders, spring equalization, and insufficient lateral motion leading to repeated low-speed derailments on some switches approaching Pittsburgh from the west. Starting in 1943, the T1&#x27;s were confined to the Ft. Wayne Division, limiting their range to that of the preceding S1. The turntable at Crestline was recently enlarged to a diameter of 110 ft, making it capable of turning the T1s. It could also accommodate every following class of steam engine the PRR would roster; the S1 would continue to use the wye. 
This transfer revealed flaws in the T1&#x27;s performance and servicing needs. Due to their complexity relative to other steam locomotive designs, the T1s were difficult to maintain. The Franklin gearbox housing was hidden by the shrouded pilot on the front engine, and squeezed between the cylinders on the rear engine. Skirting over the driving wheels also obstructed the camboxes above the cylinders. These were eventually removed, as per the S1 and Q1, but small cutouts to access the camboxes were made prior to this. Designed to run reliably at speeds of up to , the T1s were so powerful that they could easily exceed their designed load and speed limitations, which in turn caused increased wear and tear, particularly to the poppet valves and associated equipment. They were described as &quot;free steaming,&quot; meaning they could generally maintain boiler pressure regardless of throttle setting. They were so powerful that violent wheel slip could occur over a wide speed range if the engineer did not handle the throttle carefully; loss of driver traction at high speeds, especially when the T1 was under heavy load while ascending grades, caused damage to the poppet valves. The Franklin Type A valve gear applied to the T1s was designed for continuous speeds at 100 mph, and sprints up to 125 mph. In interviews with historian William L. Withuhn in the 1970s, Franklin engineers Julius Kirchhof and Ray Delano both claimed a Franklin technician charged with determining the cause of frequent poppet valve failures on the T1s saw them operated at speeds of up to 100-110mph to make up time with short trains of six or seven cars, determining the speed by timing when the train passed mileposts. 

Topography on the Ft. Wayne Division meant it was common for engine crews to push their locomotives to make up time. This was no difference to the T1&#x27;s, but presented new issues for the shop personnel. On top of the challenges of maintaining the valve gear, making repairs was even more troublesome. The one other locomotive with Franklin Type A (also allocated to the Ft. Wayne Division) wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to challenge the speed threshold of its poppet valves, let alone exceed it. By contrast, the reported speed exploits of the S1 could have been easily remedied due to its use of familiar Walschaerts motion. Thus the multiple unexpected failures lead to the T1&#x27;s taking longer to return to service. No. 6110 accumulated 120,000 miles by April 1944, implying a lower monthly average than the S1 or the K4&#x27;s.

Late 1944 saw a Norfolk &amp; Western J class trialed on the Ft. Wayne Division, at the suggestion of Vice President Symes due to dissatisfaction with the T1&#x27;s performance. J class No. 610 ran several trains reliably at speeds up to 110 mph. Numerous benefits were displayed over the duplexes, with the J having better acceleration, better steaming on poor coal, and ride quality only outmatched by the S1. The PRR was impressed, but were not sold on the 4-8-4. The J&#x27;s overall acceleration to 100 mph was lacking compared to the T1, and reports of wheelslip occurred. The biggest concern was the machinery speeds created by the 70 inch wheel diameter, and the failure risks. One run with 610 saw a set of valve gear seize up at 110 mph just east of Ft. Wayne, though this was primarily from improper lubrication. While prone to slippage and valve failures, the T1&#x27;s never experienced such high-speed failures of their reciprocating motion. The 610 was returned to the N&amp;W in early January 1945.

Months later, the prototype T1&#x27;s had their restriction lifted and resumed running east to Harrisburg. Multiple tests were made with the T1&#x27;s on increasingly heavy trains. An inspector recorded of 6110 manage a 21 car train at 100 mph on the Middle Division (Harrisburg to Altoona) in adverse weather and still making up time. This same inspector examined 6110 days later slipping violently to a standstill, resulting from a sharp throttle application. While far from perfect designs, the performance of the T1 could vary greatly by the engineer at the controls.

==Nos. 5500 - 5549== 

Beginning in November 1945, the first production T1&#x27;s appeared. 5525 to 5549 would be outshopped by Baldwin like the prototypes, while 5500 to 5524 - as well as all 50 tenders, were constructed in Altoona. No. 5524 would be the last steam locomotive built at the Juniata Shops, while the whole class was numbered to follow on from the last batch of K4&#x27;s. Lessons learned from the prototypes lead to numerous design changes, included revised spring equalization and flatter prows to the smokebox casing. The former was to combat issues of weight distribution, while the latter was done to reduce drifting smoke at high speed with lower cutoff. Shrouding from the pilot to the front cylinders had minor changes. The side portholes were retained, with skirting over the driving wheels omitted. The 5500&#x27;s were all equipped with Boxpok driving wheels, rather than the Baldwin Discs used on the prototypes. With features like duplex drive and poppet valves, the T1&#x27;s were the largest class of experimental steam locomotive ever built in the United States, as well as being the largest streamlined class of locomotive in size and quantity. Several T1&#x27;s would be serviced and stationed at Crestline. Unlike the turntable, roundhouse stalls could not accommodate the T1&#x27;s initially. 15 stalls received a 20 foot extension in 1946, extending toward the turntable rather than outwards as per the previous stall extension. They were immediately assigned to the &quot;Fleet of Modernism,&quot; hauling trains of new lightweight equipment, as well as standard and refurbished heavyweight cars. 

Almost as immediately, more problems arose with the T1&#x27;s. Despite their various improvements, the 50 production T1&#x27;s were often reported to be worse than the prototypes. This is likely due to the limited service of the prototypes, with much of that time spent on only one division. Not only were the production T1&#x27;s placed into the same Harrisburg to Chicago service on a more frequent basis, they were also assigned trains to St. Louis and occasionally Detroit. Several divisions worth of crews had insufficient experience with handling the T1&#x27;s before the first production engines entered service, while others had practically none at all. Some engineers became accustomed to the T1&#x27;s characteristics, while many others had little time to improve. The influx of T1&#x27;s also created problems on the maintenance side. Many shops crews similarly lacked the experience to maintain the Franklin gear, let alone repair it. Such difficulties meant double-heading of K4&#x27;s was not completely eliminated, though their use on higher priority trains did decrease. The T1&#x27;s regularly racked up over 8,000 miles a month. 

The Pennsylvania Railroad continued to promote the T1&#x27;s as the newest development in steam power. In addition to the Chicago Railroad Fair, T1&#x27;s made display appearances in Sunbury, Reading, and Atlantic City. Promotional print material, as well as the film &quot;Clear Track Ahead&quot; shows the T1&#x27;s being the new face of the railroad, alongside the GG1 electrics and recently acquired diesels.

As per the prototypes, two of the production T1&#x27;s were involved in comparative tests with foreign motive power, though this time the duplexes were visiting. First were trials on the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, a possible second home for the T1&#x27;s being more loyal to coal and coal-burning locomotives. 5511 and 5539 were chosen for tests, though the former was quickly recalled back to the Pennsylvania. Despite testing the locomotives, the C&amp;O placed them on normal service trains and found them quite favorable. Rather than slipping, the two instances of failure in the T1&#x27;s performance was in stalling. One instance saw a recovery of 30 seconds, while the other found the T1 unable to start its train which was overloaded. Most of these were down to the T1&#x27;s tractive effort lacking compared to the C&amp;O&#x27;s existing J-3 4-8-4&#x27;s, which were equipped with boosters to further enhance their starting capabilities.

5511 was involved in further trials on the Norfolk &amp; Western in June 1948. Design changes made to the T1&#x27;s from the prototypes were balanced out by the J class, no. 604, having an increased boiler pressure of 300 psi (no. 610&#x27;s previous comparisons were made using the original pressure of 275 psi). From June 6 to 14, 5511 was run over the Radford Division (Roanoake to Christiansburg), with its performance compared to 604&#x27;s previous runs shortly after its increase in boiler pressure. Tonnage was adjusted due to the T1&#x27;s lower tractive effort, though its higher drivers hindered its climbing ability. Further tests from June 17 to 28 had 5511 tested alongside 604, running on the Norfolk Division (Poe to Suffolk) with 21 car trains. Runs were made up to 65 mph, 75 mph, and a minimum of 85 mph, the latter condition being the only case in which the T1 outperformed the J. In addition to better fuel economy, the T1 spent approximately 30% of the 65 mile stretch at speeds above 85 mph, compared to the J&#x27;s 12%. While these results echo the PRR&#x27;s reports on the J&#x27;s acceleration, the T1 was simply unsuitable for most terrain and tonnage on the N&amp;W.

==Modifications==

Before the last engines had even been delivered, the T1&#x27;s began receiving modified pilots to further improve maintenance. The streamlined shroud and portholes were replaced with a more conventional pilot with footsteps, akin to the Q2 and S2 classes. The numberplate was moved to the smokebox, later augmented by an additional headlight on the pilot air compressor covering. The marker lights were also repositioned to the tapered sides of the smokebox.

Some divisions also cut down the shrouding on the tender to the tops of the tender deck. The chronology for these changes is unclear, with some engines recorded with their original pilots in the 1950&#x27;s. Both prototypes did receive their changes to the front end by 1948, though the shape of their smokeboxes continued to set them apart. A further internal change was made to the cylinders of a select few engines. To reduce their propensity to slip, 6111 was experimentally fitted with 1/2 in steel lining of all four of its cylinders, reducing each bore (diameter) by a full inch. This reduced the tractive effort, from nearly 65,000 lbs to just over 58,000 lbs. 6110 was similarly treated, as were 7 of the production T1&#x27;s. 

Two T1&#x27;s received different alternative forms of valve gear. 5500 was rebuilt following an accident in 1948 with Franklin Type B-2 valve gear, replacing the original oscillating cams with rotary cams. This removed the complex arrangement of gearboxes between and ahead of the cylinders, thus simplifying maintenance and improving performance. Franklin Type B had been applied to K4 3478 that same year, though 5500&#x27;s arrangement differed slightly. The original valves and cams remained in situ, while the rotary shafts were modified with bridges to drive the two pairs of ports at each end of the cylinder and associated cams. This lead to the &quot;B-2&quot; designation, making 5500 the only US steam locomotive to receive two different forms of poppet valve gear. The following year in 1949 had 5547 lose its poppet valves entirely, receiving 12-inch piston valves and Walschaerts valve gear. Cutoff was not reduced, as per the prior S1 and K5 classes, though 1/2 inch cylinder lining was applied. As the only T1 without poppet valves, 5547 was reclassified as a T1a. The change of valve gear improved maintenance, though no substantial changes in performance were noted.

==Fate==
The T1&#x27;s development was paralleled on two fronts. On one side was the development of a steam turbine locomotive, eventually designated as Class V1 resembling the later Chesepeake &amp; Ohio M-1, albeit with a 4-8-0+4-8-0 wheel arrangement. This locomotive spent years in development, but never materialized, though did culminate in the construction of the S2 of 1944. One the other side, the Pennsylvania Railroad attempted multiple times to order diesel-electrics from the Electro Motive Division. This finally culminated in the arrival of two E7A&#x27;s in 1945, just months after the T1 production order was placed. Subsequent orders to EMD, as well as for equivalent ALCo and Baldwin products, made the brand new T1&#x27;s redundant for their intended roles. This was exacerbated by 1946 being the first year the Pennsylvania recorded a loss, beginning the postwar decline in passenger traffic.

When the PRR Board decided to dieselize all first-class prime trains in 1948, most T1s were downgraded to other duties. These were mail and express trains, as well as secondary passenger trains outside of the Blue Ribbon Fleet. Among the last named trains regularly assigned to the T1&#x27;s was the Admiral. Their design characteristics, as well as the abundance of remaining K4&#x27;s, made them unsuitable for slower passenger trains with frequent stops, moreso than other passenger locomotives. Inquiries were made about converting them to dual-service, using them on freight trains as well as passenger trains like numerous 4-8-4&#x27;s. This too was a dead-end; freight on the PRR was either too heavy or too slow for the T1 capabilities. By 1950, T1&#x27;s were no longer running through services to Chicago, St. Louis, or Cincinnati, though some remained as standby or protection power in the event of a diesel set failing. Some of them were withdrawn from passenger service in 1949 and placed in storage. 1952 saw all of them out of service, being officially stricken from the roster by the end of 1953. They were scrapped between 1951 and 1956.

==No. 5550==
In 2014, a non-profit group known as &quot;The T1 Trust&quot; began restoring a T1 using the original plans with subtle performance improvements where necessary. The T1 Trust&#x27;s goal is to provide mainline excursion service. The T1 Trust&#x27;s cost estimate to build T1 number 5550 is $10 million, with an expected completion date of 2030 (This total has since been reduced to a bit more than $7 million, as a used PRR long haul tender has been acquired in lieu of new construction).

The construction of 5550 is also following construction and financing methods pioneered by the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado project. The first piece of the locomotive, the keystone-shaped number plate, was cast in April 2014, followed by the first minor component, a driving spring link pin, in October 2014. Major components completed include two Boxpok drivers, the prow, cab, third-course boiler and fire door. Front tube sheet construction was under way by a fabricator in St. Louis, Missouri.

<doc id="1211852" wikidata="Q858775" url="?curid=1211852" title="Dartford">
<text>Dartford is the principal town in the Borough of Dartford, Kent, England. It is located south-east of Central London and
is situated adjacent to the London Borough of Bexley to its west. To its north, across the Thames estuary, is Thurrock in Essex, which can be reached via the Dartford Crossing. To its east lies the Borough of Gravesham and to the south the district of Sevenoaks. It had a population of 51,240.

The town centre lies in a valley through which the River Darent flows and where the old road from London to Dover crossed: hence the name, which derives from &quot;Darent + ford&quot;. Dartford became a market town in medieval times and, although today it is principally a commuter town for Greater London, it has a long history of religious, industrial and cultural importance. It is an important rail hub; the main through-road now by-passes the town itself.

==Geography==
Dartford lies within the area known as the London Basin. The low-lying marsh to the north of the town consists of London Clay and the alluvium brought down by the two rivers—the Darent and the Cray—whose confluence is in this area. The higher land on which the town stands and through which the narrow Darent valley runs, consists of chalk surmounted by the Blackheath Beds of sand and gravel.

As a human settlement, Dartford became established as a river crossing-point with the coming of the Romans; and as a focal point between two routes: that from west to east being part of the main route connecting London with the Continent; and the southerly route following the Darent valley. As a result, the town&#x27;s main road pattern makes the shape of letter &#x27;T&#x27;. The Dartford Marshes to the north and the proximity of Crayford in the London Borough of Bexley to the west, mean that the town&#x27;s growth is to the south and east. Wilmington is contiguous with the town to the south; whilst the almost continuous Thames Gateway development means that there is little to show the town boundary in an easterly direction.

Within the town boundaries there are several distinct areas: the town centre around the parish church and along the High Street; the Joyce Green area; Temple Hill estate constructed in 1947; the Brent; Fleet Downs; as well as two important areas of open space and several industrial estates. The open spaces are Central Park, alongside the river; and Dartford Heath.

===Climate===
Like most of the United Kingdom, Dartford has an oceanic climate.
==History==
In prehistoric times, the first people appeared in the Dartford area around 250,000 years ago: a tribe of prehistoric hunter-gatherers whose exemplar is called Swanscombe Man. Many other archaeological investigations have revealed a good picture of occupation of the district with important finds from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age.
When the Romans engineered the Dover to London road (afterwards named Watling Street), it was necessary to cross the River Darent by ford, giving the settlement its name. Roman villas were built along the Darent Valley, and at Noviomagus (Crayford), close by. The Saxons may have established the first settlement where Dartford now stands. Dartford manor is mentioned in the Domesday Book, compiled in 1086, after the Norman conquest. It was then owned by the king.
During the medieval period Dartford was an important waypoint for pilgrims and travellers &quot;en route&quot; to Canterbury and the Continent, and various religious orders established themselves in the area. In the 12th century the Knights Templar had possession of the manor of Dartford; the National Trust property at Sutton-at-Hone, to the south of the town, is a remaining piece of that history. In the 14th century, a priory was established here, and two groups of friars—the Dominicans and the Franciscans—built hospitals here for the care of the sick. At this time the town became a small but important market town.

Wat Tyler, of Peasants&#x27; Revolt fame, might well have been a local hero, although three other towns in Kent all claim likewise, and there are reasons to doubt the strength of Tyler&#x27;s connection to Dartford, though the existence of a town centre public house named after him could give credence to Dartford&#x27;s claim. Dartford, however, cannot claim a monopoly on public houses named after Tyler.

It is probable that Dartford was a key meeting point early in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt with a detachment of Essex rebels marching south to join Kentish rebels at Dartford before accompanying them to Rochester and Canterbury in the first week of June 1381. Although lacking a leader, Kentishmen had assembled at Dartford around 5 June through a sense of county solidarity at the mistreatment of Robert Belling, a man claimed as a serf by Sir Simon Burley. Burley had abused his royal court connections to invoke the arrest of Belling and, despite a compromise being proposed by bailiffs in Gravesend, continued to demand the impossible £300 of silver for Belling&#x27;s release. Having left for Rochester and Canterbury on 5 June, the rebels passed back through Dartford, swollen in number, a week later on 12 June en route for London.
In the 15th century, two kings of England became part of the town&#x27;s history. Henry V marched through Dartford in November 1415 with his troops after fighting the French at the Battle of Agincourt; in 1422 Henry&#x27;s body was taken to Holy Trinity Church by Edmund Lacey, Bishop of Exeter, who conducted a funeral. In March 1452, Richard, Duke of York, camped at the Brent allegedly with ten thousand men, waiting for a confrontation with King Henry VI. The Duke surrendered to the king in Dartford. The place of the camp is marked today by York Road, Dartford.

The 16th century saw significant changes to the hitherto agrarian basis of the market in Dartford, as new industries began to take shape (&quot;see below&quot;). The priory was destroyed in 1538 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and a new manor house was subsequently constructed by King Henry VIII. In 1545, Henry held a series of meetings of his Privy Council in the town, and from 21 to 25 June 1545 Dartford was the seat of the national government. Henry&#x27;s fourth wife Anne of Cleves lived at the new priory for four years before her death in 1557.

Many Protestants were executed during the reigns of Queen Mary (1553–1554) and Philip and Mary (1554–1558), including Christopher Wade, a Dartford linen-weaver who was burnt at the stake on the Brent in 1555. The Martyrs&#x27; Memorial on East Hill commemorates Wade and other Kentish Martyrs. In 1576 Dartford Grammar School was founded, part of the Tudor emphasis on education for ordinary people.

===Industrial history===

The earliest industries were those connected with agriculture, such as the brewing of traditional beers and ales. Lime-burning and chalk-mining also had their place. Fulling was another: the cleansing of wool needed a great deal of water, which the river could provide. This led to other water-based industries, using hydropower to operate machinery.

Upon his return in 1578 from Frobisher Bay in the Canadian Arctic with a reputed cargo of gold-bearing ore, Sir Martin Frobisher had the refining done on Powder Mill Lane in Dartford. Assiduous efforts to extract gold were made over five years, but the ore proved to be a valueless rock containing hornblende and was eventually salvaged for road metalling and wall construction. Sir John Spielman set up the first paper mill in England at Dartford in 1588 on a site near Powder Mill Lane, and soon some 600 employees worked there, providing an invaluable source of local employment. Iron-making on the Weald was in full operation at this time, and iron ingots were sent to Dartford, to England&#x27;s first iron-slitting mill, set up by the Darent at Dartford Creek in 1595 by Godfrey Box, an immigrant from the Low Countries. In 1785, John Hall, a millwright set up a workshop in Lowfield Street and began to make engines, boilers and machinery (some of it for the local gunpowder factory run by Miles Peter Andrews and the Pigou family), marking the foundation of J &amp; E Hall, an engineering firm specialising in heavy engineering, and later refrigerating equipment, and, for 20 years from 1906, vehicle production, plus lifts and escalators.

From those humble beginnings in the 18th century was to come the industrial base on which the growth and prosperity of Dartford were founded. In 1840 the mustard factory of Saunders &amp; Harrison was described as being &quot;perhaps the largest in the kingdom&quot;. Dartford Paper Mills were built in 1862, when excise duty on paper was abolished. Between 1844 and 1939 the fabric printing works of &quot;Augustus Applegath&quot; were in being in Bullace Lane: again a firm using the waters of the river. RAF Joyce Green, at Long Reach, near Dartford was one of the first Royal Flying Corps airfields, It was established in 1911 by Vickers Limited (the aircraft and weapons manufacturer, who used it as an airfield and testing ground. It was superseded by Biggin Hill, and closed in 1919. The demand created by World War I meant that output at the local Vickers factory multiplied, with a positive effect on the local economy. Burroughs-Wellcome chemical works (later incorporated into GlaxoSmithKline) made Dartford a centre for the pharmaceutical industry. There had been a large power station at Littlebrook on the Thames, to the north of the town, from 1939 until its closure in 2015. The station, including one of the tallest chimneys in the UK, was completely demolished in 2019.
===Post-industrial economic plans===
The Mazda motor manufacturer has its UK head office at the large Thames-side Crossways Business Park. Thomas Walter Jennings created the Vox musical brand, with products such as the AC15 and AC30 amplifiers originating in Dartford. In early 2006, the since-closed South East England Development Agency (SEEDA) purchased the former Unwins depot on the edge of the town. The warehouse was demolished and a business centre, The Base, built in its place, funded by the Homes and Communities Agency.

By 2018, the former GlaxoSmithKline manufacturing site in Mill Pond Road had been redeveloped with residential apartments and is known as Langley Square. Further regeneration is taking place at Market Street, to be known as Brewery Square.

==Economy==
Some of Dartford&#x27;s key industries, including brewing, paper-making, flour milling and the manufacture of cement, suffered extreme decline in the 20th century, causing redundancies and unemployment. Swanscombe Cement Works (now redeveloped into Bluewater shopping centre) was closed by Blue Circle in 1990. This industry had been an economic boon to the area, but left behind a lot of derelict land and pollution. In 1990 Dartford contained around of spoiled land resulting from extractive industries, and cement-dust pollution from local cement works was a regular subject of complaint in the local press throughout the 20th century.

The closure of Dartford&#x27;s major employers (including Seagers&#x27; Engineering Works, J &amp; E Hall International, and Vickers), the reduction and subsequent closure of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline), the redevelopment of nearby Bexleyheath as a shopping town in the 1970s, and the opening of Bluewater Shopping Centre in 1999, all had a negative effect on the economy of Dartford, but the town is still home to major brands such as Sainsbury&#x27;s, W.H. Smiths, and Boots. With the opening of the major Bluewater regional shopping centre just outside the town, the high street has seen a growth in cheaper brands such as Primark and Wilko taking over empty premises. Wilko announced in 2023 that it was going into receivership. In the 1990s, the local economy was boosted by the establishment of a number of business parks in the area, the biggest being Crossways Business Park at the foot of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. The former offices of Hall-Thermotank have been converted for use as Dartford Civic Centre.
In 2007 Dartford saw an increase in the number of chain stores located in the town as B&amp;Q, M&amp;S Simply Food, TK Maxx and Asda Living opened new outlet stores in the town centre. Before this Safeway had taken part in the development of Dartford&#x27;s second shopping centre, The Orchards, located next to the Orchard Theatre. The Safeway&#x27;s site was eventually taken over by Waitrose but this closed in March 2014 and a new Aldi store opened in June 2015. The historical and once bustling main High Street and adjacent shopping centre, The Priory, continued to decline, and went into receivership in 2013, and the large department store previously occupied by the Co-operative has now been demolished, having been bought by Dartford Borough Council. The oldest independent business still trading in Dartford, the butchers Richardson &amp; Sons in Lowfield Street, established in 1908, closed down in 2014 to make way for the proposed Lowfield centre superstore development. The problems with obtaining planning permission for this development and associated residential units were compounded by the recession. This created persistent delay in regeneration of the Lowfield Street site, and on 8 January 2015 it was finally announced that the Tesco plans were to be abandoned.

==Culture and community==

The Orchard Theatre is a professional theatre in the town centre, with a schedule including drama, dance, music and entertainment. The Mick Jagger Centre, within the grounds of Dartford Grammar School on Shepherds Lane, was completed in 2000 and provides facilities for community arts. library and Museum are located on Market Street.

Central Park, in the town centre, is used for various community events. It comprises of land.

===Sport===
Dartford F.C. play at Princes Park Stadium and compete in the National League South. There are also three other senior clubs based in Dartford, two of them in the Kent County Football League: Fleetdown United, who play at Heath Lane Lower, and Kent United, who play at Glentworth Sports Club, the former home of Kent Football United (now defunct). Southern Counties East Football League side Halls AFC play at the Community Stadium at Princes Park.

Dartford Harriers Athletic Club was formed in 1922 and is currently based at Central Park. Originally founded as Dartford Rugby Football Club, the rugby players began taking part in cross-country runs in an effort to keep fit. Running soon became more popular with the players, and the club eventually dropped rugby around the end of the 1927–28 season, becoming Dartford Harriers AC. The club&#x27;s running colours of blue and blue &quot;hoops&quot; are a legacy from the club&#x27;s rugby origins, when the rugby players simply removed the sleeves from their old rugby shirts to create running vests.

Dartfordians Rugby Football Club have five adult teams and a large youth section, and play their home matches at War Memorial Club House on Bourne Road. Their first team currently plays in London 1 South, following promotion from London 2 South-East in the 2017–18 season.

Dartford is also home to Dartford and White Oak Triathlon Club; formed in 1988, it is one of the oldest British Triathlon Federation clubs in the UK. The club trains at The Bridge Estate, Dartford.

Sports centres in Dartford include the Becket Sports Centre, within the grounds of Dartford Grammar School on Shepherds Lane, which is the home of several sports groups.

===Media===
Since the town is close to London, television signals are received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter, placing Dartford in the BBC London and ITV London areas. Some areas of the town can also pick up a signal from the Bluebell Hill TV transmitter that broadcasts BBC South East and ITV Meridian.

Local radio stations are: BBC Radio Kent (96.7 FM), Heart South (103.1 FM), Gold (603 AM) and KMFM West Kent, which broadcasts from its studios in Strood on 96.2 FM.

The town is served by two local newspapers: the Dartford &amp; Swanley News Shopper and the Dartford Messenger.

===Health===

Between 1877 and 1903 the number of hospitals in Dartford rose to 11, together providing 10,000 hospital beds, at a time when the town&#x27;s population was a little over 20,000. The majority of these have been closed, especially since the opening of Darent Valley Hospital. One of the best-known, Stone House Hospital, in Cotton Lane to the east of the town, was opened on 16 April 1866 as the &quot;City of London Lunatic Asylum&quot;. It was, and still is, a large castellated structure built in spacious grounds. It remained under the direct administration of the City of London until 1948, when it was transferred to the National Health Service (NHS). It remains one of the largest and most visible structures in Dartford, and was until recently operated by the NHS to manage regional health care delivery, and was also home to a nursing school, &quot;Livingstone Hospital&quot;, on East Hill. The main buildings of this facility are now closed, and have been turned into luxury flats.

==Transport==

===Roads===
The route of an ancient Celtic trackway which the Romans later paved and identified as Iter III on the Antonine Itinerary, later to be called &quot;Watling Street&quot;, and which the current A2 roughly follows, passed close to the town. After the Romans left Britain, it fell out of use, as the town developed and traffic went into the town itself; the name Watling Street transferring to the new route. The introduction of stagecoach services increased the amount of traffic through the town, so that by the 18th century it had become necessary to control the upkeep of such a heavily used road. Turnpike Trusts were set up by Act of Parliament; Dartford was served by two: that for Watling Street and the road south to Sevenoaks, both brought into being between 1750 and 1780.

From 1925, the A2 main road took traffic away from Dartford town centre via the &quot;Princes Road&quot; bypass. Today, the original main road through the town is the A226 and the former turnpike road south to Sevenoaks is now the A225. A newer by-pass is the A206, which skirts the town to the north. Its prime purpose is to carry traffic from the riverside industrial developments on to the Dartford Crossing from both west and east. Dartford is perhaps most well known for the latter, the main mode of crossing the River Thames to the east of London, where the southbound A282 (part of the London Orbital) crosses the river via the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge toll bridge, opened in 1991. The northbound carriageway crosses via the twin bore Dartford Tunnel; the first tunnel was opened in 1963 and the second in 1980.

===Railway===
Dartford railway station is located in the town centre and is connected to London by three National Rail routes. The first London to Dartford connection by rail was the North Kent Line via Woolwich Arsenal in 1849, connecting at Gravesend with the line to the Medway Towns. Later, two more lines were built: the Dartford Loop Line through Sidcup, which opened in 1866, and the Bexleyheath Line, which opened in 1895. All the lines were electrified by 6 June 1926.

The station is served by two train operating companies:
* Southeastern, which provides services from to , and .
* Thameslink operates a route between and .

===Buses===
Dartford is served by many bus services provided by Transport for London, Arriva Kent Thameside and Go Coach Buses.

These routes connect Dartford with areas including Bluewater, Bexleyheath, Crayford, Erith, Gravesend, Greenhithe, Orpington, Sidcup, Swanley, Welling and Woolwich.

==Education==
==Places of worship==
The parish church, Holy Trinity, is situated on the western bank of the River Darent, from where a hermit would conduct travellers across the ford. The church was originally a 9th-century Saxon structure, but gained later Norman additions. In the 13th century a royal wedding was celebrated there; thus today the choristers are entitled to wear scarlet cassocks. Also on display within the church is a brass plaque commemorating the work of Richard Trevithick, the pioneer of steam propulsion, who, at the end of his career, lived, worked (at J &amp; E Hall) and died in the town.

Other places of worship in Dartford include: Brent Methodist Church, Brethren&#x27;s Meeting Room, Dartford Methodist Church, Highfield Road Baptist Church, Net Church, St Alban&#x27;s Church, St Andrew&#x27;s United Reformed Church, Christ Church Dartford, Grace Outreach Church, and Zion Strict Baptist Chapel.

The graveyard is situated in St Edmund&#x27;s Pleasance on the summit of East Hill (the place where Richard Trevithick is buried), which gave rise to a traditional and derogatory rhyme of Dartford&#x27;s people: &quot;Dirty Dartford, filthy people, bury their dead above the steeple.&quot; The church actually has no steeple; it has a tower featuring a ring of eight bells.

<text>The A229 is a major road running north–south through Kent from Rochester to Hawkhurst via Maidstone. It is a former Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings. 

The road is well known for Blue Bell Hill, which connects Rochester to Maidstone through the North Downs, and links the M2 and M20 motorways. A popular ghost story documents a driver picking up a phantom female hitch-hiker on the A229 outside the Lower Bell pub, who subsequently disappears inside the driver&#x27;s car.

==Route==
The A229 is about long. The road passes through little in the way of built-up areas aside from the Medway Towns and Maidstone. It is principally a link between these two areas and the south coast around Hastings.

The road begins in the Medway town of Rochester at the top of Star Hill forming a junction with the A2. It then climbs up through the built-up area of Rochester and Chatham, passing Troy Town and Rochester Airport and the M2 motorway before descending the scarp slope of the North Downs at Blue Bell Hill. Below the road as it descends is the tunnel carrying High Speed 1. Once into the Medway Valley, there is a junction with the M20 motorway, and it follows the River Medway into Maidstone town centre. There are junctions with several main roads here, including the A26, A20 and A249.

Beyond Maidstone, the road climbs up Greensand Ridge to Loose, built on the ridge&#x27;s southern slope, before running through the valley of the River Beult to Staplehurst. Beyond this, it follows the Weald through Cranbrook and climbs another hill to Hawkhurst. The road ends on the A21 London – Hastings Road near Hurst Green.

===Traffic===
The A229 through Maidstone is a major bottleneck on the route, with long daily morning and evening queues entering both sides of the town. The two bridges gyratory was upgraded in 2016 to allow two-way traffic alongside Fremlin Walk.

===Checkpoints===
In 2006, the road was set up with the then largest vehicle checkpoint campaign in Kent, in order to catch drug dealers and benefit fraudsters. Twenty-seven vehicles were apprehended, but there were no arrests.

==History==
The road largely follows the route of Roman Road No. 13, as described by Ivan Margary, which ran from Rochester to Hastings. It was turnpiked between Rochester and Maidstone in 1728, then to Cranbrook in 1760.

The A229 number was assigned in 1923, following the turnpike road. The original route through Maidstone ran along Sandling Road and Week Street; the diversion along the riverside opened in 1978. It runs partially on the site of Fremlin&#x27;s Brewery, whose production site in Maidstone had then recently closed.

==Ghost stories==

On 19 November 1965, three women were severely injured in a road accident at Blue Bell Hill on the A229 when their Ford Cortina collided with a Jaguar. One of the women, 22-year-old Susan Browne from Gillingham, who was due to wed RAF technician Brian Wetton, died five days later at West Kent Hospital in Maidstone; the two other females, Judith Lingham and Patricia Ferguson, died soon after the accident.

Since then, there have been several reports of ghosts relating to the accident. The basic story is that a driver passing the Lower Bell pub on the A229 spots a lone female dressed in white at the side of the road. He offers her a lift, and she gives him an address. Some time later, the driver looks in the rear view mirror to discover she has disappeared. Other variations of the story report a small purse or handbag left behind, or that when the driver reaches the intended address, he is informed by a family member there that his passenger died several years previously.

The legend has now become one of the best-known ghost stories involving phantom hitch-hiking in the United Kingdom, and the Blue Bell Hill Road is reported to be one of the most haunted roads in the country. On 13 July 1974, local bricklayer Maurice Goodenough ran into Rochester Police Station and reported he had run over a girl aged around 10 on Blue Bell Hill, who suffered several cuts, and had left her at the roadside wrapped in a blanket. When the police returned to the scene, the girl had disappeared, and despite an extensive radius search of the area, the girl was never found. A further incident of the lone female variant of the story was reported in 1992. Other variations are drivers reporting to have driven straight through a girl in the middle of the road, without any apparent injury.

In 2014, a local group wrote and directed the short film, The Ghost of Blue Bell Hill, which covers the numerous ghost stories relating to the road.

<text>Yaakov Dori (; October 8, 1899 – January 22, 1973), born Yaakov Dostrovsky, was the first Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). He was also the President of the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology.

==Biography==

Yaakov Dostrovsky (later Dori) was born in Odessa in present-day Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire) to Tzvi and Myriam Dostrovsky. The family immigrated to Ottoman Palestine following the anti-Jewish pogrom in Odessa in 1905. Upon completing high school at the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa, he enlisted in the Jewish Legion of the British Army during World War I. Following the war he studied engineering at the University of Ghent.

His son, Yerachmiel Dori, served as commander of the IDF&#x27;s Engineering Corps. His daughter, Etana Padan, is a biochemist and a professor of microbial ecology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His youngest son, Zvi Dori, was a Chemistry Professor at the Technion and the founder of the first Israeli Science Museum (Technoda). Israel Dostrovsky, physical chemistry and former President of the Weizmann Institute of Science, was his first cousin.

==Military career==

When he returned to Palestine in 1926, he joined the Haganah and adopted the underground name of &quot;Dan&quot;. In the Haganah, he was the commander of the Haganah Forces of Haifa.

In 1939, Dori was appointed Chief of Staff of the Haganah, a position he held until 1946. As CoS Haganah it was Yaakov Dori&#x27;s duty to take the Haganah from a diffuse self-defense organisation to a model army. From 1946-47 he also headed the Palestinian Jewish delegation sent to purchase arms in the United States.

When the IDF was formed, Dori took over as its first Chief of Staff. Yet, despite his good command and organizational skills, he was already suffering from failing health and had difficulty commanding his troops during the 1948 Palestine War, so he was forced to rely heavily on his deputy, Yigael Yadin. He completed his term as Chief of Staff on November 9, 1949, and retired from the military. He was succeeded by his deputy, Yadin. After his release from the army, however, he continued to wear the officer&#x27;s pin he was awarded when he first became a second lieutenant.

==Academic career==
Upon leaving the IDF, Dori was appointed chairman of the nation&#x27;s Science Council, attached to the Prime Minister&#x27;s office. He was later appointed president of the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa in 1951, a position he held until 1965. He followed Shlomo Kaplansky, and was followed by Alexander Goldberg.

==Legacy and commemoration==
The Israel Defense Forces base at Tel HaShomer, one of the largest in Israel, is named after Ya&#x27;akov Dori. A prominent road in Haifa and a street in Beersheba are both named after him.

<doc id="1211856" wikidata="Q2368744" url="?curid=1211856" title="Golaniad">
<text>The Golaniad ( , from the word &quot;golan&quot; meaning &quot;hoodlum&quot;) was a protest in Romania in the University Square, Bucharest. It was initiated by students and professors at the University of Bucharest.

The Golaniad started in April 1990, before the election of 20 May 1990, which was the first election after the Romanian Revolution of December 1989. Their main demand was that former leading members of the Communist Party should be banned from standing in elections.

==Background==

Ion Iliescu and the National Salvation Front (FSN) seized power during the 1989 revolution. The FSN organization was meant to act as a temporary government until free elections were to be held. However, on 23 January 1990, despite its earlier claims, it decided to become a party and to run in the elections it would organize. Some of the dissenters and anti-communists who joined the FSN during the revolution (including Doina Cornea) left following this decision.

Many of the FSN personalities, including its president, Iliescu, were ex-communists and as such the revolution was seen as being hijacked by the FSN. The FSN, which was widely known from the revolution and associated with it, won 66.3% of the votes, while the next party – the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania – obtained only 7.2% of the votes, followed by the National Liberal Party at 6.4%, with the Ecological Movement of Romania (MER) and the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ-CD) trailing at around 2.6% (see &quot;1990 Romanian general election&quot;). 

==The protests==

On 22 April 1990, the Independent Group for Democracy (&quot;Grupul Independent pentru Democrație&quot;) organised a demonstration in Aviators&#x27; Square. After the peaceful demonstration, groups of people marched towards the Romanian Television (TVR) station, calling for its political independence. The following day, the PNȚ-CD organized an even larger protest (around 2,500–3,000 people), occupying the road in the University Square, and some protesters decided to sit-in overnight.

The protests drew the ire of the authorities, who, during the night of 23–24 April, began a repression of the protesters. The law enforcement agents beat up the protesters and arrested some of them. The authorities&#x27; violence had the exact opposite effect than the one expected, as more people came. Two days later, they were still there, their numbers growing; on the evening of 25 April, their number reached 30,000. The sympathetic press reported even higher numbers, up to 50,000 each evening. A number of protesters began a hunger strike.

President Ion Iliescu refused to negotiate with the protesters and called them &quot;golani&quot; (&quot;golan&quot; meaning a hooligan, a scamp, a ruffian, or a good-for-nothing – which later gave the protest its name) or legionnaires.

The leadership of the National Salvation Front realized that the protests grew too big to be able to repress them with impunity, so it focused on demonizing them in the state-controlled media. This part of the media called the protesters &quot;delinquents&quot;, &quot;hooligans&quot;, &quot;parasites&quot;, &quot;thieves&quot;, &quot;extremists&quot;, &quot;fascists&quot;, &quot;traitors&quot;, etc. This campaign was successful particularly outside Bucharest, where the government-owned media was the only source of information. Public television showed reports of the protests in which they interviewed people marginal to both the protests and the Romanian society, such as Roma people, hawksters, and prowlers.

==Name and anthem==
The ending &quot;-ad&quot; (&quot;-ada&quot; in Romanian) was used ironically, since many of Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s Communist manifestations had endings like this, for instance the annual national sporting event &quot;Daciad&quot; (in order to compare them either with an epic, like the Iliad or, rather, with the international Olympiad). The protesters also composed their own hymn, &quot;Imnul Golanilor&quot;:

:Mai bine haimana, decât trădător
:Mai bine huligan, decât dictator
:Mai bine golan, decât activist
:Mai bine mort decât comunist&quot;
:: lyrics by Laura Botolan; music by Cristian Pațurcă

The song may be translated into English as:

:Better to be a tramp than a traitor,
:Better to be a hooligan than a dictator,
:Better to be a hoodlum than an activist,
:Better to be dead than communist&quot;

==Support==
Many intellectuals supported the protests, including writers such as Octavian Paler, Ana Blandiana, Gabriel Liiceanu, Stelian Tănase, and film director Lucian Pintilie. Renowned playwright Eugène Ionesco supported them by sending a telegram from France in which he wrote he was a &quot;Golan Academician&quot; (&quot;Hooligan Academician&quot;).

==Demands==
The three main demands of the protesters were as follows.
# The eighth point of the Proclamation of Timișoara: leading members of the Romanian Communist Party and the Securitate not to be allowed to be candidates in the elections.
# Access to the state-owned mass media for all candidates, not only FSN candidates. A 1975 law of Ceaușescu (which was not yet repealed) allowed the President of Romania to directly control Romanian Television and Radio.
# Postponing of the elections, since the only party that had the resources for the campaign was FSN.

The protesters also disagreed with the official doctrine of the FSN that the Revolution was only &quot;anti-Ceaușescu&quot; and not &quot;anti-Communist&quot; (as Silviu Brucan declared in an interview given to the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;). They also supported faster reforms, shock-therapy to usher in an unregulated free market, and a liberal-style democracy (Ion Iliescu argued for a &quot;Swedish-style&quot; socialism and an &quot;original democracy&quot;, considering multi-party system as being antiquated).

After the elections the protests continued, the main goal being the removal of the government.

==Violent ending==
After 52 days of protests, on 13–15 June, a violent confrontation with government supporters and miners from the Jiu Valley ended the protests, with many of the protesters and bystanders being beaten and wounded. Sources differ on the number of the casualties, the government confirming seven deaths related to the events.

<text>Edward David Taussig (November 20, 1847 January 29, 1921) was a decorated rear admiral in the United States Navy. He is best remembered for being the officer to claim Wake Island after the Spanish–American War, as well as accepting the physical relinquishment of Guam by its Spanish governor following the Treaty of Paris in which Spain ceded Guam to the United States following nearly 300 years of colonial rule. Taussig briefly served as Governor of Guam. He was the first of a four-generational family of United States Naval Academy graduates including his son, Vice Admiral Joseph K. Taussig (1877–1947), grandson Captain Joseph K. Taussig Jr. (1920–1999), and great-grandson, Captain Joseph K. Taussig III USMC (1945–).

==Early sea service==
Taussig was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of a wool broker, Charles and his wife, Anna (Abeles), who had emigrated from Austria in 1840. His family was Jewish, but he was brought up in the Unitarian Church. He was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy during the Civil War and entered on July 23, 1863. His education over the next four years included service on the . Graduating in June 1867 he served on the steam frigate from July to December 1867 and thereafter variously on the , , and from January 1868 to April 1870. He was commissioned an ensign on December 18, 1868. His early sea service was perhaps most remarkable for his time as a passed midshipman on the gunboat when a tsunami washed her far inland at Arica (then part of Peru), on August 13, 1868. He was decorated for his actions during this event.

==1870s–1890s service==
Promoted to master on March 21, 1870, and to lieutenant on January 1, 1872, during the 1870s and 1880s, Taussig was stationed at a number of shore stations and ships: , Pacific Squadron (October 1870 September 1873); Newport Torpedo Station, (June–October 1874); Hydrographic Office, Washington, D.C. (October December 1874); Panama Survey Expedition (January- April 1875); special duty, Bureau of Navigation, Washington, D.C. (May–October 1875); commander, receiving ship , Washington, D.C. (September 1875); Temporary duty assignment Washington Navy Yard (October 1875 April 1876); , Baltimore and Norfolk Navy Yard (April September 1876); training ship (September 1876 February 1877); , flagship of the European Squadron, and , special service European Station (February 1877 January 1880); U.S. Naval Academy (June 1880 April 1883); United States Coast and Geodetic Survey duty, commanding the survey steamers &quot;McArthur&quot; and &quot;Hassler&quot; (May 1883 August 1886); training ship (September 1886 December 1887); and Bureau of Navigation, Washington, D.C. (December 1887 December 1890).

During special duty, Navy Department, Washington, D.C. (December 1890 April 1894) Taussig was involved in managing the navy&#x27;s exhibit at the Columbian Exposition, including the full-size mock-up battleship &quot;Illinois&quot;, where he was executive officer, following his promotion to lieutenant commander on June 19, 1892. Thereafter, his assignments were executive officer, , North Atlantic Squadron (April 1894 September 1895); executive officer, receiving ship , Philadelphia Navy Yard (October 1895 February 1896); executive officer, , Pacific Squadron (February September 1896); Hydrographic Office, Washington, D.C. (September December 1896); hydrographic inspector, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D.C. (December 1896 August 1897); coast survey steamer &quot;Blake&quot; (August 1897 May 1898); and Norfolk Navy Yard (June July 1898).

==Wake Island, Guam and the Philippine–American War==
Promoted to the rank of commander on August 10, 1898, his first command was the gunboat , which departed San Francisco on September 18 bound for Hawaii, Guam and duty with the Asiatic Squadron, in the aftermath of August 12, 1898 Spanish–American War armistice. arrived in Hawaii on September 27, 1898, and spent the next three months operating in local waters and conducting surveys, including Pearl Harbor. In December of that year, Taussig was given orders to proceed to Wake Island and claim it for the United States. After ten days passage from Honolulu, he arrived to formally claim the island on January 17, 1899. At one p.m. a flagstaff was placed, and with sailors in dress whites forming two ranks, Taussig called all to witness that the island was not in the possession of any other nation and declared it in possession of the United States. Taussig ordered the American flag raised by Ensign Wettengell and gave a 21-gun salute when the flag reached the truck. At the time President William McKinley ordering that Wake Island be claimed as a U.S. possession was seen as questionable; however, no other nation had claimed the island and there was no native population. Wake Island was primarily taken for its strategic value as a cable station, midway between Hawaii and the Philippines.

Departing from Wake Island at 5:35 p.m. on January 17, 1899, arrived at Guam on January 23, 1899. The island previously had been captured on June 21, 1898, by Captain Henry Glass of the who had left Francisco Portusach Martínez, an American civilian, in charge of the territory. Captain Glass is reported to have told Martínez, the only American on Guam, to &quot;take care of the island until some other officers or man-of-war might reach Guam.&quot; Although this has never been confirmed by the U.S. Navy, it was widely believed to be true. Martínez had been deposed in favor of non-American leadership under José Sisto, the highest ranking Spanish civil official in the island, and then Venancio Roberto, each laying competing claims to governance. Venancio Roberto&#x27;s claim was rebuked in favor of Sisto by Lieutenant Commander Vincendon L. Cottman, commander of the U.S. Navy collier that had arrived at Guam on New Year&#x27;s Day 1899 en route back to the U.S. from the Spanish–American War. However Sisto&#x27;s authority was short-lived.

On February 1, Sisto officially relinquished control of the governmental and administrative affairs of Guam to Taussig and Cottman. The American flag was raised over the Governor&#x27;s Palace in a ceremony that ended with a 21-gun salute from the , formally ending nearly 300 years of Guam being part of the Spanish colonial empire. In his short time on Guam, Commander Taussig set up a local council system of temporary government which lasted until the arrival of Lieutenant Louis A. Kaiser in July 1899 under orders to conduct navy surveillance of affairs of Guam. Taussig also supervised the establishment of signal stations and a port survey. On April 15, 1899, Admiral George Dewey cabled the Navy Department in Washington, &quot; arrived six days from Guam. Quiet and order there. Most friendly to Americans. Native Government established by Taussig working well. Native soldiers fine body of men. (United States Naval Transport) in Guam.&quot;

Departing Guam in mid-February 1899, Commander Taussig and continued on to Manila, where the ship arrived on February 22, 1899, with the mission of supporting the Army&#x27;s campaigns during the Philippine–American War primarily with patrol and escort duty. In August 1899, Taussig was summarily relieved of command of the and ordered home by Rear Admiral John C. Watson, commander of the Asiatic Station, following Taussig&#x27;s dissent from the latter&#x27;s views concerning campaign plans that were voiced at a staff conference in Manila. According to press reports, Watson resented Taussig&#x27;s verbal opposition, and a heated argument between the two ensued. Following his return to San Francisco on the hospital ship, , Commander Taussig requested an investigation.

He was assigned to duty with the United States Lighthouse Board as 13th District Inspector in Portland, Oregon, from October 1899 to April 1900. However, Commander Taussig did not have to wait long for vindication, when in March 1900, public accounts surfaced of Watson&#x27;s friction with officers under his command and with the Bureau of Navigation over Watson&#x27;s choice of Commander C. C. Cornwall as his executive officer, which the bureau disapproved. Due to health reasons, Watson was himself privately relieved of command months before the public announcement in March 1900 that he was to be relieved by Rear Admiral George C. Remey. Watson returned home on his flagship in April 1900, the same month that Commander Taussig&#x27;s duty as lighthouse inspector ended.

==The China Relief Expedition (Boxer Rebellion)==
In the spring of 1900, Chinese xenophobia, including disdain for the presence of Christian missionaries, fueled by decades of Western economic exploitation, culminated in the Boxer Rebellion. The Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists, whose members were referred to in the West as &quot;Boxers&quot;, besieged the foreign legations at Peking and at Tientsin. An international relief force was hastily assembled and sent to relieve the siege. As part of the United States Navy&#x27;s force assigned to the campaign, the gunboat , sister-ship of the , was withdrawn from her patrol duties in the northern Philippines to provide assistance to operations off the North China coast. departed Manila on April 3, 1900, upon reaching the mainland, her landing force served ashore at Taku Forts. In June, Taussig assumed command of and assisted to back off a reef near Taku. In August, with stationed off Chefoo, China, Taussig cabled dispatches of the decisive Battle of Beicang from which the Chinese military never recovered. The gunboat departed Shanghai on September 10, reaching Cavite on the 17th. In the Philippines, resumed her prior cooperation with Army forces, engaged in pacification efforts for the next two years. Commander Taussig was detached from in June 1901 and was ordered home to await orders (June October 1901).

==Later years==
Thereafter, Taussig&#x27;s assignments were to the Washington Navy Yard (November 1901 January 1902); ordnance office, Boston Navy Yard (January May 1902); and commander, training ship, (May–October 1902). Promoted to captain on November 7, 1902, he served as yard captain, Pensacola Navy Yard (January October 1903); commander, receiving ship , Mare Island, California (October 1903 October 1904); and commander, , North Atlantic Squadron (November 1904 January 1906).

On July 24, 1905, along with Rear admirals Charles D. Sigsbee, James H. Sands, Charles H. Davis Jr., Captains Benjamin F. Tilley, William H. Reeder, and Gervais of the French naval cruiser, &quot;Jurien de la Graviere&quot;, Taussig had the honor of being an honorary pall bearer when Admiral John Paul Jones body was returned from France on the to be interred at the U.S. Naval Academy.

Following his command of &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, he was commander, of the training ship (January December 1906); yard captain, New York Navy Yard (March May 1907); general court martial duty, League Island Navy Yard (Pennsylvania) (May December 1907); commandant, Norfolk Navy Yard and Fifth Naval District (December 1907 November 1909).

While at Norfolk he was promoted to rear admiral on May 15, 1908. Rear Admiral Taussig was placed on the U.S. Navy retired list on November 20, 1909.

In 1909 he became a companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States—a military society consisting of officers who had served in the Union armed forces during the American Civil War.

==World War I==
During World War I, Taussig was recalled to active duty as commandant of the Naval Unit at Columbia University (September December 1918).

==Dates of rank==
: United States Naval Academy Midshipman Class of 1867

==Service Medals==

===United States awards===

The original service criteria for the Spanish Campaign Medal promulgated in Navy Department Special Order No. 81 June 27, 1908, required service on specific vessels and time periods for which Taussig&#x27;s service during the Spanish–American War did not qualify. However, in the early 1920s, the award criteria were relaxed to provide for award of the medal to all those who served in the U.S. Navy or Marine Corps during the Spanish–American War. The first government contract to supply campaign medals to the expanded recipient base with the Bastian Brothers Company was not until 1922. Rear Admiral Taussig died in January 1921 prior to the expanded eligibility period for the Spanish Campaign and so never received the Spanish Campaign Medal.

==Personal life==
Edward D. Taussig married Ellen Knefler on November 9, 1873. She was the daughter of Frederick Knefler. They had five sons, including Vice admiral Joseph K. Taussig and Charles, who was a prominent New York attorney. A third son, Paul, died of appendicitis in July 1894, while a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy. Edward D. Taussig died at Newport, Rhode Island, on January 29, 1921, and is buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery along with his wife and son, Paul.

<doc id="1211866" wikidata="Q3087358" url="?curid=1211866" title="Freemans Bay">
<text>Freemans Bay is the name of a former bay and now inner city suburb of Auckland, in the North Island of New Zealand. The bay has been filled in to a considerable extent, with the reclamation area now totally concealing the ancient shoreline. Historically a poor and often disreputable quarter, it is now a comparatively wealthy and desirable neighbourhood known for its mix of heritage homes and more recent single-dwelling houses, as well as for its two large parks.

== Geography ==

Since the turn of the 20th century, extensive land reclamation (partly using stone quarried from nearby headlands) has seen Freemans Bay itself disappear. The reclamation of the old bay began in 1873 and was finished in 1901. Victoria Park was created on most of the resulting flat area. It is still public land used mostly for sports purposes.

The coastline shifted more than one kilometre to the northwest of the city centre and is now composed of the concrete wharves of Viaduct Basin and the Tank Farm or as it is now renamed, the Wynyard Quarter.

== History ==
===Māori history===

Waiatarau (or &#x27;Reflecting Waters&#x27;) was the Māori name for the bay that is now Victoria Park, although other names were used to refer to the area; such as Wai Kōtota (&#x27;The place where the cockles are harvested&#x27;) and Te Koranga (&#x27;The scaffolds&#x27;, referring to the racks upon which fish would be hung to dry in the sun). A stream called Waikuta (&#x27;Waters of the reed&#x27;) discharged into the south eastern corner of the bay (bottom of College Hill Road) while the Tunamau (&#x27;To catch eels&#x27;) stream came down from what is now Western Park and met the bay at the bottom of what is now Franklin Road. The headland at the western side of the bay was called Te Tō, and was a seasonal fishing pā used by Tāmaki Māori. Te Tō was occupied by 18th century Waiohua paramount chief Kiwi Tāmaki during the shark hunting season on the Waitematā Harbour.

===European settlement===

Freemans Bay is one of the earliest settled areas in Auckland, and was earmarked for development and land reclamation in the 1840s by Colonial Surveyor Felton Matthew who laid out the streets along the shores of the local bays. During the early colonial era, the bay was known by Māori as Waipiro Bay, due to the large amounts of rum consumed there.

Freemans Bay is probably named after Captain William Hobson&#x27;s secretary, James Stuart Freeman who apparently lived in the area.

While settled as one of the earliest parts of the country by Europeans, the area was never seen as a desirable place to live. The rich favoured the other side of Queen Street, clustering around the governor&#x27;s mansion (where the university is now located) and enjoying views of the harbour and Rangitoto, this was even referred to as the &#x27;right side&#x27; of Queen Street.

On the &quot;wrong side of Queen Street&quot; were located most of the smelly and noisy industries including the abattoir and the gasworks of the Auckland Gas Company. As well as brickworks, by 1883 the area was the location of nine shipyards, three sawmills, a brass and iron foundry, a glassworks, an asphalt works, as well as several coal and lime traders. Also found here were several public facilities like the city morgue, a night soil dump and from 1905 the city rubbish incinerator (known as the &#x27;Destructor&#x27;, which became Victoria Park Market and was rebranded as Victoria Park Village in 2017).

Around these occupations were gathered some of the more modest houses in 19th century Auckland. Two land auctions in 1864 in this area were the &quot;Brookville&quot; estate (121 sites) and &quot;Alma Place&quot; (152 sites). The large number of building sites are probably an indication of the very small size of the building sections. These workers cottages were built very close together and often poorly constructed, sometimes being little better than hovels with dirt floors. Not all the housing in the area was so modest, however; on Franklin Road, which rises up the hill towards the Ponsonby ridge, were built larger houses, including several two storied houses, and in 1873 the street was beautified by the City Council by planting it with plane trees. Many of these larger houses subsequently became boarding establishments for male workers from the adjacent industries.

In 1910 the average house for sale on Franklin Road was advertised for £736, while the average house in Victoria Road, Remuera, was considered worth £1279 at the time. 
In 1905 Victoria Park was created which included sports grounds, a sports pavilion and a children&#x27;s playground. The playground equipment was donated by Mr John Court of the John Court Department Store. In 1909 a kindergarten for the local children was opened. It soon ran into financial problems, however, from which it was rescued by Dr John Logan Campbell. The brick building stood for many years unused, recently restored by Auckland Council and NZTA as part of the works around the Victoria Park Tunnel. During the 1918 flu epidemic, the sports pavilion was used as a depot for corpses awaiting transportation by rail to the city cemeteries.

As a working class area, Freemans Bay was greatly affected by the Great Depression. By 1930, the percentage of unskilled workers amongst the male population of Freemans Bay had risen to 39%, whereas in affluent Remuera it was only 2%. Conversely, only 11% of all males of Freemans Bay worked in &quot;white-collar&quot; or &quot;business and professional&quot; roles, whereas in Remuera the same percentage had grown to 86% by that time, a sign of the increasing homogenisation of Auckland suburbs.

Freemans Bay was seen as a centre of crime, prostitution, sedition and Union Activity. There were also concerns about it being a source of infectious diseases, including plague and tuberculosis. In the 1930s, the Auckland City Council set up a committee called &quot;The Decadent Areas Committee&quot; (later renamed as the &quot;Housing Committee&quot;) largely to deal with the area. In the 1930s and 1940s, many Māori who moved into the city looking for work came to live in the cheap housing of the area. This pattern was repeated in the 1950s and 1960s when Pacific Islanders arrived in New Zealand seeking employment as well.

During the Second World War, Victoria Park was commandeered and covered with a military camp for the American Armed Forces. The adjacent areas St Mary&#x27;s Bay and Freemans Bay became notorious as the location of many brothels along with illicit drinking and gambling establishments. Many of the women in the area were keen to have fun with the American troops who were known to be generous with money, cigarettes and nylon stockings. The distinction made by the authorities and most respectable people between a female being a &#x27;loose woman&#x27; and being a prostitute was pretty vague. St Mary&#x27;s Bay was known for being more expensive and tended to cater for the officers, while Freeman&#x27;s Bay was for the lower end of the market. This reputation clung to the area after the war.

In 1951, the Auckland City Council declared a 96 hectare area of Freemans Bay as an area for urban development, and planned to replace the entire housing stock with medium-density housing, destroying the homes of over 7,000 people in the process. While this did not come to pass, several developments of flats and townhouses were built in the 1960s and 1970s, such as along Whitson Terrace. LDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the remaining Victorian houses began to be gentrified along with the neighbouring suburbs of Ponsonby and St Marys Bay and they are now some of Auckland&#x27;s most fashionable and desirable residences.

On Victoria Street opposite Victoria Park stands a group of brick Edwardian industrial buildings. Built between 1905 &amp; 1915 and known as &quot;the Destructor&quot;, this facility generated electricity by burning the city&#x27;s rubbish. Opened by the Mayor Arthur Myers, this facility was closed in 1972, and in 1983 it was converted into a market called Victoria Park Market, latterly rebranded as Victoria Park Village.

Behind Victoria Park Village is the Drake hotel which sits at a slightly higher level than the Village, Victoria Street and the park. This shows the outline of the ancient sea cliff. From 1905 onwards, Freemans Bay was filled in to create the park. After 1919 the reclamations continued and the area north of the park was created to provide more wharf area for the expanding Ports of Auckland. This included the Lighter Basin to the east and Wynyard Wharf to the west.

From 2000 to 2003, the Lighter Basin was redeveloped as the Viaduct Basin, which served as a headquarters for the various yachting syndicates involved in the America&#x27;s Cup campaigns of 2000 and 2003. The area is now an upper-class (multi-story) residential area. On the adjacent Fanshawe Street, previously dilapidated warehouses have been replaced by new prestigious office blocks, including Vodafone New Zealand. The Wynyard Quarter is also undergoing a great deal of redevelopment, which includes the new Silo Park.

The suburb is now home to a much more affluent populace, with the 2006 median income at $41,400, much higher than the $26,800 average Auckland-wide. Around 32% of all residents live in single-person households, some in the many former Council and State Housing flats still existing in the area, though the housing stock is varied.

==Notable buildings==

Gloucester Court is an art deco apartment building constructed in 1935. It was one of the first apartment buildings in Freemans Bay.

Allendale was constructed in the 1890s for George Allen. It has served many different purposes over the years including a Maori girls hostel, a boarding home, doctors surgery, and a restaurant.

Te Kāinga Aroha (Former), on Hepburn Street, is a category 1 historic place that was built in 1898. It was home to Andrew Entrican, a manse for St James&#x27; Presbyterian Church on Wellington Street, and as a hostel for young Māori women for seventy years.

The Auckland Savings Bank Newton branch was designed by Edward Bartley and constructed in 1884. In 1886 it had another storey added.

<text>In finance, value date is the date when the value of an asset that fluctuates in price is determined. The value date is used when there is a possibility for discrepancies due to differences in the timing of asset valuation. It usually applies to forward currency contracts, options and other derivatives, interest payable or receivable.

The value date can also mean:

*the date when the entry to an account is considered effective in accounting.
*the delivery date of funds traded in banking. For spot transactions it is the future date on which the trade is settled. In the case of a spot foreign exchange trade it is normally two days after a transaction is agreed upon. 
*the date the tax payment would coincide with the payment date in online banking, and retail payment gateways online.

<doc id="1211869" wikidata="Q5104198" url="?curid=1211869" title="Choke (sports)">
<text>In sports, choking is the failure of a person, or persons, to act or behave as anticipated or expected. This can occur in a game or tournament that they are strongly favoured to win, or in an instance where they have a large lead that they squander in the late stages of the event. It can also refer to repeated failures in the same event, or simply imply an unexpected failure when the event is more important than usual.

Most athletes experience physical and mental changes during stages of increased tension in competition. They may change their strategy as a coping mechanism, and play more cautiously as a result. In instances where this strategy fails, a player or team many lose confidence to the point of panic, where they are incapable of completing the most rudimentary of tasks. Choking in sport can be considered a form of analysis paralysis.

The term itself is often an over-used, or even derisive term in the sports world, where &quot;choke&quot; status might be assigned to a team or player that was simply unlucky. A double standard also exists where the choke status is not assigned to players or teams that perform poorly under pressure but are somehow still able to win, but the choke could be assigned to players or teams that perform well under pressure but still lose. The term &quot;clutch&quot; is used to describe the opposite of choking.

==Choking==
Choking under pressure decreases the standard level of athletic performance, of an athlete when they may be at their peak performance. 
Symptoms of choking may include tightening up of the muscles, an increased level of anxiety and a decrease in self-confidence. Choking can leave an athlete feeling embarrassed or frustrated.

==Causes==
Choking is sometimes caused when an athlete becomes distracted, their thoughts become negative or unproductive and when they worry about things they cannot control. Anxiety is built up from negative self-talk and doubt which leads to choking. The source of the pressure can vary, which leads to the choking itself manifesting in different ways. In some instances a player or team&#x27;s first game, or a big occasion can lead to anxiety similar to stage fright, which may result in a poor start, or being on the receiving end of a rout. In other instances, the closeness of victory leads to increased anxiety, which may in turn lead to a dramatic loss.

In the chaotic arena of a sporting contest, it is sometimes hard to identify if a player or team has panicked, or was simply victim to a strong finish by their opponents. Many athletes will play down publicly any notion of a loss of nerve, to prevent this being seen as a weakness.

===Explicit monitoring theory===
The explicit monitoring theory provides an explanation for athlete&#x27;s under-performance at the precise moment they need to be at their best. Sian Beilock and Tom Carr suggest that “pressure raises self-consciousness and anxiety about performing correctly, which increases the attention paid to skill processes and their step-by-step control. Attention to execution at this step-by-step level is thought to disrupt well-learned or proceduralized performances.”

===Distraction theory===
Distraction theory was first suggested by Wine to explain under-performance in performance pressure situations. Distraction theorists argue that pressure creates a dual task situation which draws attention away from the task at hand. Attention is then focused towards irrelevant stimuli such as worries, social expectations, and anxiety. Wine first tested his hypothesis with academic tests but it has since been applied to athletics.

Research has found that distraction theory is supported in situations where working memory is used to analyze and make decisions quickly. Short term memory is used to maintain relevant stimuli and block irrelevant information as it relates to the task at hand.

A study at Arizona University looked at how athletes of different levels of experiences responded to distraction and self-analysis, and found that novice baseball players were more likely to see a drop in performance from a distracting noise. However, it also found that more experienced players were more susceptible to underperformance when they were asked to focus on their technique.

===Self-focus theory===
This theory predicts a decrease in performance is due to attention being shifted to movement execution. Any combination of factors that increase the importance of performing is considered performance pressure. Baumeister&#x27;s self-focus theory suggests responding to performance pressure can lead to an increase in self-consciousness which then results in choking. 
There is more focus on the motor components of performance, consciously controlling movements with step-by-step control.

===Processing efficiency theory (PET)===
Anxiety causes a shift in an athlete&#x27;s attention towards thought of performance consequences and failure. An increase in worry decreases attention resources. According to PET, athletes put extra effort into their performance when under pressure, to eliminate negative performance. Eysenck and Calvo found processing efficiency is affected by negative anxiety more than performance effectiveness. Efficiency being the relationship between the quality of task performance and the effort spent in task performance.

===Attentional control theory (ACT)===
Eysenck and Calvo developed ACT an extension to PET, hypothesizing an individual shifts attention to irrelevant stimuli. Stress and pressure cause an increase in the stimulus-driven system and a decrease in the goal-directed system. Disruption of balance between these two systems causes the individual to respond to salient stimuli rather than focusing on current goals. ACT identifies the basic central executive functions inhibition and shifting, which are affected by anxiety. Inhibition is the ability to minimize distractions caused from irrelevant stimuli. Shifting requires adapting to changes in attentional control. Shifting back and forth between mental sets due to task demands.

===Attentional threshold model===
According to the attentional threshold model, a performance decrement is caused by exceeded threshold of attentional capacity. This model combines both the self-focus models and the distraction models. The combination of worry and self-focus together causes a decrease in performance. Attentional Threshold Model suggests that choking is a complex process involving cognitive, emotional and attentional factors.

==Contributing factors==
Factors of choking may include, individual responsibility, expectations, poor preparation, self-confidence, physical/mental errors, important games/moments and opponent&#x27;s actions.

===Fear of negative evaluation===
FNE is a psychological characteristic that increases anxiety under high pressure. Creates apprehension about others&#x27; evaluations or expectations of oneself. FNE is similar to &quot;motive to avoid failure (MaF)&quot;. The need to avoid negative evaluation from others, avoid mistakes and avoid negative comparison to other players.

===Presence of an audience===
The presence of parents, coaches, media or scouts can increase pressure leading to choking. An athlete wants to perform their best while being observed and trying not to make any mistakes increases the amount of pressure they are under.

===Self-confidence===
Being over-confident can cause negativity to take over quickly. Not expecting something negative to happen can cause a choke. Having low self-confidence leads to more mistakes, because you do not think you can do anything.

A study done by Wang, Marchant, Morris and Gibbs (2004) found poor performance associated with high self-conscious individuals. An individual with high self-consciousness focuses their attention to thoughts relating to the task (i.e., “did I step right?”) and to outside concerns (i.e., “will people laugh if I mess up?”). Individuals with low self-consciousness can direct their attention outward or inward because self-concerns do not dominate their thinking.

===Experience and skill===
A study done by Klein Teeselink, Potter van Loon, Van den Assem and Van Dolder (2018) found that professional darts players are substantially less susceptible of choking than amateurs and youngsters.

==Choking and individual zone of optimal functioning==
According to the Individual Zones of Optimal Functioning theory (IZOF), proposed by Russian social and sport psychologist Yuri Hanin as an instance of the earlier-discovered Yerkes–Dodson law, an individual&#x27;s best performance is when their anxiety level is in a certain zone of optimal state of anxiety or affect. Too much or too little anxiety can lead to performance decrement. Determining athletes’ optimal prestart state anxiety level leads to achieving and maintaining that level throughout the performance.

Choking can occur if the athlete is outside their anxiety zone. Programs such as IZOF help identify an athlete&#x27;s anxiety zone creating a balance between arousal and somatic anxiety. Low arousal can lead to broad attention taking in irrelevant and relevant cues. High arousal can create low attention causing important cues being missed.
:For example a lacrosse goalie with low arousal may focus more on whether or not a college scout is watching them, rather than focusing on the opponent who is about to score on them. A lacrosse goalie with high arousal may focus more on the opponents stick position instead of the opponent&#x27;s body position, causing them to step in the wrong direction.

==Choking and performance anxiety in male and female athletes==
There have been a number of studies that investigate performance anxiety in male and female athletes. In a study that investigated performance anxiety with an emphasis on gender and sport played, 601 Portuguese athletes (172 female and 429 male) ranging from ages 12 to 47 competed in a variety of individual and team sports. The athletes competed the Portuguese version of the Sport Anxiety Scale-SAS-2, which had questions that were designed to reflect what young athletes might have felt before or during sports competition. The scale is a measure of sports related anxiety that considers both cognitive and somatic trait anxiety. Some examples of these items that were on the assessment include &quot;My body feels tense&quot; or &quot;I lose focus on the game&quot;. A number of statistical analyses were performed to understand the implications of the data and significant differences were noted between male and female athletes. Female athletes presented notably higher levels of general sports anxiety in comparison to the males in the study. The results of this research provided evidence that sport-related anxiety appears in survey results in different magnitudes based on gender, with female athletes being more anxious about their performance.

Another paper focused on achievement goals of athletes coupled with gender and their on anxiety in national elite sports. In this study, the roles of achievement orientation, perception of the motivational climate, and perceived ability on performance trait anxiety in a sample of national level elite athletes were analyzed in an effort to understand the gender differences in these traits. The method included results from 189 Norwegian athletes. This included 101 male and 89 female athletes, all of which participated in individual player sports and completed measures of the roles listed above. This study results allowed the researchers to discover that female and male athletes had similar achievement orientations and perceptions of the motivation climate. However, even though the results of perceived ability had initially predicted that females would have less performance anxiety, females still reported higher levels of performance and somatic anxiety and were less concentrated overall.

A study was also completed with high school and college track and field athletes that analyzed cognitive and somatic anxiety and confidence and their impact on gender and competitive characteristics. The 216 athletes completed a survey called the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) within 20 minutes after each event they competed in at a high-level relay meet. The study revealed that male athletes had lower somatic anxiety and higher self-confidence than their female counterparts. The results of this American-based study support the previously discussed findings in both Portugal and Norway that female athletes report more performance and sport related anxiety than male athletes, showing that research from several populations worldwide seem to line up in terms of the results of each study. This allows similar conclusions about anxiety in athletes based on gender, since in each study, female athletes show more performance anxiety than their male counterparts and this correlation appears in every sport that has been analyzed.

==Examples of choking in sports==

===American football===
In a Wild Card playoff matchup between the Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers on January 3, 1993, the Oilers choked a 32-point lead to lose in overtime. This is the largest blown lead in a playoff game in NFL history and the second largest overall, after the Indianapolis Colts blew a 33-point lead to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15 of the 2022 season. This game is known to this day as The Comeback, or locally in Houston as &quot;The Choke&quot;.

In Super Bowl LI, the Atlanta Falcons choked away a 25-point lead to the New England Patriots, after holding a 28–3 lead late in the 3rd quarter. Tied 28–28, the game went to sudden death overtime, where the Patriots would score a game winning touchdown. This was the first Super Bowl to be decided in overtime, with Super Bowl LVIII being the only other instance this has occurred. Due to the Falcons’ offense never having the chance to receive the ball during the overtime, the NFL would further amend playoff overtime rules following Super Bowl LI to allow both teams one possession before the sudden death effect occurs. 

===Association football===
The England national football team has been noted in the last 30 years, especially for their under-performance in major tournaments, and for their lack of success in penalty shootouts.

In the first knockout round of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain F.C. lost a 4-goal aggregate lead to FC Barcelona. PSG had won the first leg at home by 4–0 and had scored an away goal at the Camp Nou to lead 5–3 on aggregate after 88 minutes. However, two late goals from Neymar and a stoppage-time winner from Sergi Roberto gave Barcelona a 6–1 win on the night and a 6–5 triumph on aggregate. Some commentators have called this one of the biggest chokes in footballing history.

On matchday 3 during Bundesliga season 2022/23, Borussia Dortmund choked against Werder Bremen, who just promoted from 2. Bundesliga. Dortmund was leading 2–0 for 88 minutes but still managed to lose the match.

===Australian Rules Football===
Although Collingwood Football Club are one of the most successful teams in the AFL, between their titles in 1958 and 1990, they lost 8 successive Grand Finals. Most notably they lost a 44 point lead in the 1970 Grand Final to Carlton, the then second largest lead lost in the history of the AFL. They also previously lost to St Kilda in 1966 by a single point, and later lost the 1977 Grand Final in a replay to North Melbourne, having tied the first match. Their unlucky run was dubbed &#x27;The Collywobbles&#x27;. 

===Baseball===
In 2004, the New York Yankees won the first three games of the American League Championship Series over the Boston Red Sox and held a 4–3 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning in Game 4, needing three outs to advance to the World Series. Closer Mariano Rivera gave up a walk and a single that allowed the tying run, and the Red Sox won on a 12th-inning walk-off home run by David Ortiz. The Yankees went on to lose the next three games to become the first team in baseball history to lose a best-of-seven series after leading three games to none.

===Cricket===
South Africa suffered upset losses against the West Indies in 1996 and New Zealand in 2011 and 2015. South Africa&#x27;s win in the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy remains their only international tournament victory to date.

In the 2013 Champions Trophy final against India, England batted second and got into a position of needing just 20 runs off the last 16 balls, with six wickets in hand, but lost four wickets in the space of eight balls and lost the match by five runs.

===Darts===
Peter Wright missed six match darts in the 2017 Premier League Darts final against world champion Michael van Gerwen, eventually losing the match and forgoing the accompanying £250,000 of prize money. An analysis of tens of thousands of darts matches by Klein Teeselink, Potter van Loon, Van den Assem and Van Dolder (2018) showed that this is a general phenomenon: amateur and youth darts players display a sizable decrease in performance at decisive moments. Professional players, however, were found to be less susceptible to choking under pressure.

===Golf===
Greg Norman was leading the 1996 Masters Tournament by six strokes after three rounds, but scored a 6 over par 78 to allow Nick Faldo to win by five strokes, with a 5 under par 67.

Jean van de Velde only needed a double-bogey 6 to win the 1999 British Open. Instead he scored a triple-bogey 7 on the 18th hole and entered a play-off which he lost.

Rory McIlroy led the 2011 Masters Tournament from the start of the tournament, and led by 4 strokes before the final round, but ended up falling out of the top ten at the tournament, after dropping six shots in three holes in the closing stages. Rory similarly led the 2024 U.S. Open but bogeyed three of the final four holes of the tournament, including two missed putts from within four feet of the cup.

Scott Hoch&#x27;s miss at the US Masters in 1989 resulted in him sometimes being known as &quot;Hoch the Choke&quot;.

===Ice hockey===
Four NHL teams have taken a 3–0 series lead in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, only to lose 4–3 in the best-of-seven series: the 1942 Detroit Red Wings, the 1975 Pittsburgh Penguins, the 2010 Boston Bruins and the 2014 San Jose Sharks.

In Game 3 of the first round of the 1982 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the heavily favored Edmonton Oilers, led by NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, lost a 5–0 lead to the Los Angeles Kings. The Kings won 6–5 in overtime and pulled off the stunning upset knocking off the Oilers 3–2. The Kings ended up losing in the second round against the Vancouver Canucks, who advanced to the championship round.

The Toronto Maple Leafs have been known for losing leads in the playoffs despite winning 13 championships, with their last championship being in 1967 and facing a 19-year playoff series win drought between 2004 and 2022. The Maple Leafs’ rivalry with fellow Original Six team Boston Bruins has also resulted in multiple losses attributed to choking. As of 2024, Toronto have not beaten Boston in a playoff series since 1959, losing six postseason series, 4 of which have gone to 7 games. In Game 7 against the Bruins in the first round of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Maple Leafs lost 5–4 in overtime, despite leading 4–1 throughout most of the game. Toronto would go on to be eliminated in the first round of both the 2018 and 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, falling both times to Boston in 7 games. In the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Maple Leafs blew a 3–1 lead against the Montreal Canadiens, suffering their eighth straight loss in potential series-clinching games. The &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; ran pages with the title &quot;Running Choke&quot;, and Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner received criticism following the loss.

===Snooker===
Snooker, where a player&#x27;s nerves are an important aspect of the game, produces many instances where a player fails to close out a match, or are unable to produce on the big stage. Mike Hallett was leading 7–0 and 8–2 in the Masters final, a first to nine frames match against Stephen Hendry, before Hendry came back to win 9-8.

Jimmy White reached the final of the World Snooker Championship six times, and lost each time, against Steve Davis, John Parrott and Stephen Hendry. Notably he lost a 14–8 lead to Hendry in 1992, losing 18–14. Two years later he missed a black off its spot in the final and deciding frame to gift Hendry another title. To add insult to injury, it was his 32nd birthday on the day.

===Tennis===
In the 1993 Wimbledon final, Steffi Graf played Jana Novotná. After Novotná lost the first set, she won 10 of the last 12 games, leading 4–1, serving at 40–30. She then hit the worst 2 serves of her career, and went on to eventually lose 7–6, 1–6, 6–4.

===Basketball===

In the 2015–16 NBA season (with a win-loss record of 73-9) Golden State Warriors surrender a 3–1 NBA Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers led by LeBron James. Golden State seen as a far superior team lose three straight games including Draymond Green&#x27;s suspension in game 6.

<text>Jules Salvador Moch (15 March 1893 – 1 August 1985) was a French politician.

==Biography==
Moch was born into a renowned French Jewish military family, the son of Captain Gaston Moch and Rébecca Alice Pontremoli. His grandfather was Colonel Jules Moch. His upbringing occurred during a growing socialist movement in France. He was in Polytechnique along with Alfred Dreyfus. As an engineer (&quot;polytechnicien&quot;) who took part in the X-Crise Group, he was a socialist member of Parliament for Drôme and then Hérault from 1928 to 1936 and from 1937 to 1940. He was Under-secretary of State in prime minister Léon Blum&#x27;s office (1937) and became Minister of Public Works in 1938.

During World War II Moch was critical of the Vichy French government and was jailed but later was released. He joined and helped organise the Paris underground. He also helped other French Resistance activities in France. When the Free French Naval Forces was organized, he rallied to de Gaulle in 1942 and participated in the Invasion of Normandy toward the Free French Liberation of France with the Allies.

After World War II, Moch was a member of the Consultative Assembly (1944) and of the two Constituent National Assemblies (1945–1946) and then of the National Assembly (1946–1958 and 1962–1967). He was a Cabinet Minister eight times during the Fourth Republic, heading the Ministries of Public works and Transportation (1945–1947), Interior (1947–1950), and Defence (1950–1951). As Transport Minister, he contributed to the rebuilding of railways, ports, roads, aviation, and the Navy. As Interior Minister, he had to deal with the communist-inspired great strikes in November 1947 and showed great firmness. In the Defence Ministry, he contributed to the modernisation of the army, organised French participation in the Korean War and the implementation of NATO. He also suggested and participated in the forming of the Baghdad Pact for the Middle East. He fought the Gaullist and Communist Parties during the Fourth Republic and was one of the leaders of the &quot;Troisième Force&quot;. 
Moch was deputy prime minister from 1949 to 1950, and France&#x27;s delegate at the UN Disarmament Commission from 1951 to 1960. As rapporteur of the Foreign Affairs Committee, he opposed the European Community of Defence, which was defeated by the National Assembly in 1954. His last ministerial post was in Pierre Pflimlin&#x27;s government in May 1958 where he played an important role in the May 1958 crisis of French Algeria, as Interior Minister. He left the Socialist Party in 1975.

He was married to Germaine Picard, one of the first woman lawyers of France. She was also an active advocate of the women&#x27;s rights movement in France and Europe.

Though other noted individuals lay claim, it is alleged that the name Cold War was officially &quot;coined&quot; after a speech he made in 1948 over his concern on the growing rift that developed between the Allies of Western Europe and the Warsaw Pact Forces of Eastern Europe.

<text>Bunessan (), meaning &quot;bottom of the waterfall&quot;, is a small village on the Ross of Mull, a peninsula in the south-west of the Isle of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland. The settlement is at OS grid reference NM382218, within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon, and is situated on the A849, at the head of a cove at the southern end of Loch na Làthaich.

==Community==
In 1961 it had a population of 107. A village hall is used for dances throughout the year. The primary school for the Ross of Mull is found in Bunessan.

==Economy==
Business has included crofting, a mill (now home to the Ross of Mull Historical Centre), weaving and a small fishing fleet, up to the end of the 20th century. The village still has a lobster fishery.

Bunessan village has one hotel, The Bunessan Inn (previously named Argyll Arms) (the only pub in the area), one grocery shop and a craft shop.

== Bunessan Inn ==
The Bunessan Inn, previously the Argyll Arms, is the only pub and hotel in the village of Bunessan in Argyll and Bute.

It was established over three centuries ago (the exact date is unknown). The earliest record of the inn was in 1773 when Dr Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, on their way to the isle of Iona, stopped at the inn in search of whisky from Lachlan McLean; but upon asking the innkeeper they found that the whisky supplies were empty due to a funeral a few days before.

The Inn was reopened in June 2023 under new ownership following a cellar refurbishment and installation of new toilet and baby change facilities. the guest rooms are set to reopen from Easter of 2024.

==Hymn tune==
Mary Macdonald (Màiri Dhòmhnallach) from the nearby crofting community of Ardtun used a traditional local melody for her Scottish Gaelic Christmas carol titled Leanabh an Àigh. In the 1880s Lachlan Macbean translated the text as &quot;Child in the Manger&quot; and called the air &quot;Bunessan&quot;. The tune was reused in the 1930s for the hymn &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;.

==Lighthouse==
Bunessan lighthouse is located on a skerry of Gray Island in the entrance to Loch na Làthaich and the harbour of Bunessan. The present lighthouse is a metal skeletal tower covered by white aluminium panel as a daymark and the light on the top. The light emits a white or red flash, depending on the direction every six seconds.

<text>Wilhelm Storost, artistic name Vilius Storostas-Vydūnas (22 March 1868 – 20 February 1953), mostly known as Vydūnas, was a Prussian-Lithuanian teacher, poet, humanist, philosopher and Lithuanian
writer, a leader of the Prussian Lithuanian national movement in Lithuania Minor, and one of leaders of the theosophical movement in East Prussia.

==Biography==
The Storost family was a long-established family in East Prussia and Wilhelm was born in the village of Jonaten (), near Heydekrug, in the Kingdom of Prussia. Wilhelm Storost was the name on his German passport, while Vilimas or Vilius Storostas was the literature Lithuanian form used by himself, his family, and other Lithuanians. &quot;Vydūnas&quot; was added to his surname as a pseudonym when he was about 40 years old. Storost was married to Klara Füllhase.

Storost was educated as teacher at the Präparandenanstalt in Pillkallen (lit. Pilkalnis) (1883–85) and at teacher seminar in Ragnit (lit. Ragainė) (1885–88). From 1888 to 1892 he was a teacher in Kinten (lit. Kintai), when he went to teach at a boys school in Tilsit (lit. Tilžė) until 1912 and taught German, French, English, Lithuanian and sports. In 1912 he left his teaching position in order to take up philosophical studies, which he took at the universities of Greifswald, Halle, Leipzig and Berlin. 1918/19 he taught Lithuanian at the Seminar for Oriental Languages in Berlin under the director Eduard Sachau. Back in Tilsit he dedicated himself to reestablishment of Lithuanian Culture, especially folks songs and rural traditions. He directed a choir and wrote songs as well as theater plays. From 1933 on he worked in Memel at the music school.

1932 he published the book &quot;Sieben Hundert Jahren Deutsch-Litauischer Beziehung&quot; (Seven Hundred Years of German-Lithuanian relations) focusing on German trade, military and religious colonization and genocide of Old Prussians. The book did not please the Nazis and in 1933 was outlawed. 1938 he was shortly incarcerated, but because of protests released after two months.

Together with nearly all of the people of East Prussia he was expelled during the Soviet take-over and lived in a refugee camp for some time. He died in Detmold, West Germany. His grand nephew Jürgen Storost recently explained that Wilhelm Storost&#x27;s answered his friend Viktor Falkenhahn, that &quot;his use of the pen name Vydūnas was his chosen anthroposophic mission; that he did not want to be a &quot;pavydūnas&quot;, but a &quot;vydūnas&quot; (one who wishes everyone everything good).
Vydūnas was active in the old Lithuanian religion (see Romuva). However, he did not declare the revival of the pagan religion as either his personal goal or a goal of Lithuanians, remaining a national leader but not a religious one. His moral influence transcended the confines of being a typical political leader or a writer at his time. He was compared by later biographers with national leaders in India of his time, such as Rabindranath Tagore or Mahatma Gandhi. Pantheistic universalism, not predefined with participating in any obligatory religious practice, was one of the leading ideas of his philosophy, and gained him later fame as a pioneer of both pagan revival and theosophy in Lithuania.

Vydūnas was an ethical vegetarian and wrote several essays about his ethical choices.

Vydūnas was nominated for the Nobel Prize by the Lithuanian Writers Association.

<text>Knockan () is a township of six crofts in the community of Ardtun, in the south of the Isle of Mull off the west coast of Scotland.

&quot;Cnocan&quot; in Gaelic means &quot;little hill&quot;. The cottage called &quot;Knockan&quot; is distinguished by its bright red roof and white walls, set by a small hill. It is around 200 years old and was originally built by a weaver of the local crofting community. It is now owned by his descendants, the family of Donald Black. The other crofting cottages in the &quot;township&quot; of Knockan include &quot;Knockan House&quot; and &quot;Rhudda na Cruban&quot;

Knockan is situated on an unclassified road, north of its junction with the A849. The A849 is the main route across southern Mull, travelling from Salen to Fionnphort, via Craignure.

<text>Royal Air Force Bruntingthorpe or more simply RAF Bruntingthorpe is a former Royal Air Force station located north east of Lutterworth, Leicestershire and south of Leicester, Leicestershire, England.

It was operational between 1942 and 1962 and it is currently known as Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome.

==History==

===Royal Air Force use===
The station was opened in November 1942 as the home of No. 29 Operational Training Unit RAF operating the Vickers Wellington.

After the Second World War ended, the airfield was used to test Gloster Meteor jet fighters by the Power Jets Unit. It was placed into RAF care and maintenance status and remained unused until January 1957.

The following units were also here at some point:
* No. 11 Air Crew Holding Unit RAF
* No. 44 Gliding School RAF (December 1945 - May 1946 &amp; June - December 1949)
* No. 1683 Bomber (Defence) Training Flight RAF (June 1943 - February 1944)
* Bombing Analysis School RAF (July - December 1944)
===United States Air Force use===
On 13 November 1953, control of Bruntingthorpe was allocated to the United States Air Force, however the airfield remained unused for most of the decade.

In 1955, a massive reconstruction plan was approved to transform the airfield and station into a Strategic Air Command (SAC) bomber base. The USAF planned to use Bruntingthorpe as an advanced &quot;Reflex&quot; base for forward deployment of the new Boeing B-47 Stratojet medium range nuclear bomber. SAC wanted to disperse its nuclear bomber force and have about half of its B-47s stationed at forward bases in Western Europe and North Africa. Because the borders of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact controlled areas were within the range of the B-47, the &quot;Reflex&quot; deployments would base the bombers for 90-day rotations of crews and aircraft.
The wartime airfield&#x27;s northeast/southwest runway was widened to 200 feet and increased in length from 6,000 to 10,800 feet in addition to a new parallel taxiway. To accommodate this, thirty-four farmlands were acquired to expand the size of the runway. In addition, a large dispersal area for aircraft parking, an underground refueling pipeline network and also the removal of the wartime crosswind runways. The station area required a large number of administrative and service buildings, a new main hangar, a new control tower and other airfield support buildings. Personnel barracks and other buildings, such as officer housing and, recreation facilities.

On 1 March 1957, RAF Bruntingthorpe was activated by Strategic Air Command. The base was placed under the command of the 3912th Air Base Squadron, 7th Air Division. The first operational use of the base began in March 1958 when 43 B-47s of the 100th Bombardment Wing deployed from Pease AFB, New Hampshire arrived over a three-day period. The squadron participated in operational training missions until returning to the United States in November. The 96th Bombardment Wing from Dyess AFB, Texas, deployed its B-47s during the summer of 1959.

Following French President General de Gaulle&#x27;s requirement for all foreign nuclear forces to leave France, there was a major readjustment of USAF deployments in Western Europe, and the B-47 deployments ended. On 1 September 1959, jurisdiction of Bruntingthorpe was transferred from SAC to the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and control of the facility was assigned to the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at RAF Alconbury, which had been moved from West Germany to England. The 10th TRW could not accommodate all four squadrons of the wing at Alconbury, so one was based at Bruntingthorpe, which became its satellite. The mission was changed to support Douglas RB-66B Destroyer Reconnaissance aircraft of the 19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. The first B-66s arrived at the base on 26 August and by mid-September 18 were present. The squadron&#x27;s activities consisted of taking high-resolution aerial photographs of Soviet and Warsaw Pact military forces and activities.

The 19th TRS remained at Bruntingthorpe for almost three years until the summer of 1962. At that time, it was decided to forward deploy the squadron to the then-unused Toul-Rosières Air Base, France. The first aircraft departed for France on 22 July, with the final aircraft departing by the end of August. With the departure of the B-66s, the USAF turned over control of Bruntingthorpe to the British Ministry of Defence on 28 September, and this ended military use of the facility.

==Present day==
With the departure of the USAF, the MoD decided to sell off parts of the facility and to demolish buildings that it judged were no longer of use, or those World War II buildings that remained but were determined to be in a poor condition. Nearly all of the barracks, recreational and social buildings were torn down, along with a World War II hangar. In addition the USAF control tower, the crash and rescue building along with some of the buildings used during Whittle&#x27;s testing of the Meteor jet during the postwar era were removed. In 1965 a public auction of land formerly used for the USAF support area was conducted.

Today, much of the former RAF airfield remains, including the 10,000&#x27; runway built in the 1950s. Many dispersal pads for jet bombers remain, the large USAF hangar is still in use, along with the aircraft parking ramp on the south side. The airfield is now known as Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, and was, for a time the home of the only airworthy Avro Vulcan XH558, until the aircraft left at the start of the 2009 display season and is now based at Doncaster Sheffield Airport.
It is also home to the several aircraft preservation groups including Classic British Jets Collection Buccaneer Aviation Group, Lightning Preservation Group who come together with other groups to present the Cold War Jets Collection Open days.

<doc id="1211904" wikidata="Q1541225" url="?curid=1211904" title="HMS Agamemnon (1781)">
<text>HMS &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was a 64-gun third-rate ship of the line of the British Royal Navy. She saw service in the American Revolutionary War, French Revolutionary, and Napoleonic Wars and fought in many major naval battles. She is remembered as Horatio Nelson&#x27;s favourite ship, and she was named after the mythical ancient Greek king Agamemnon, the first ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name.

The future Lord Nelson served as &quot;Agamemnon&quot;&#x27;s captain from January 1793 for three years and three months, during which time she saw considerable service in the Mediterranean. After Nelson&#x27;s departure, she was involved in the infamous 1797 mutinies at Spithead and the Nore, and in 1801, she was present at the first Battle of Copenhagen, but she ran aground before being able to enter the action.

Despite Nelson&#x27;s fondness for the ship, she frequently needed repair and refitting and would likely have been hulked or scrapped in 1802 had the war with France not recommenced. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805 as part of Nelson&#x27;s weather column, where she forced the surrender of the Spanish four-decker &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;. &quot;Agamemnon&quot;&#x27;s later career was served in South American waters off Brazil.

Her worn-out and poor condition contributed to her being wrecked when, in June 1809, she grounded on an uncharted shoal in the mouth of the River Plate whilst seeking shelter with the rest of her squadron from a storm. All hands and most of the ship&#x27;s stores were saved, but the condition of the ship&#x27;s timbers made it impossible to free the ship; her captain was cleared of responsibility for the ship&#x27;s loss thanks to documents detailing her defects. In 1993, the wreck of &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was located, and several artefacts have since been recovered, including one of her cannons.

==Construction==

&quot;Agamemnon&quot; was ordered from the commercial shipbuilder Henry Adams at his Bucklers Hard shipyard on the Beaulieu River on 5 February 1777 to be built to the lines of the , as designed by Sir Thomas Slade. Her keel was laid down in May. She was constructed using timber sourced from the surrounding New Forest. The total cost of her construction was £38,303 15s 4d. She was commissioned on 28 March 1781 under Captain Benjamin Caldwell—a full 13 days before her launch on 10 April.

A painting of the launch of &quot;Agamemnon&quot; by Harold Wyllie depicts blue skies and scores of spectators despite the &quot;Hampshire Chronicle&quot; describing the day as windy with heavy rain and with few spectators in attendance.

She was named after King Agamemnon, a prominent figure in ancient Greek mythology who participated in the siege of Troy and was the first Royal Navy vessel to bear the name. Lord Nelson regarded her as his favourite ship and to her crew, she was known by the affectionate nickname &#x27;Eggs–and–Bacon&#x27;. According to an article in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, her crew renamed her as they did not like the classical names that were in vogue at the Admiralty during this period (the crews of and also &#x27;renamed&#x27; their ships to &#x27;Billy Ruffian&#x27; and &#x27;Polly Infamous&#x27; respectively, for the same reason).

==American Revolutionary War==
In November 1781, the Admiralty had received intelligence that a large convoy was preparing to sail from Brest under Admiral de Guichen. The convoy was composed of transports carrying naval supplies for the West Indies and the French fleet in the East Indies. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was part of Admiral Richard Kempenfelt&#x27;s squadron of 18 ships (11 of which mounted 64 or more guns), which he commanded from . Kempenfelt was ordered to intercept the convoy, which he did in the afternoon of 12 December in the Bay of Biscay, approximately south-west of Ushant. With the French naval escort to leeward of the convoy, Kempenfelt attacked immediately, capturing 15 of the transports before nightfall. The rest of the convoy scattered, most returning to Brest; only five transports reached the West Indies.

Early in 1782, she sailed to the West Indies as part of Admiral Sir George Rodney&#x27;s squadron, with Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood as his second in command. On 9 April, the Battle of the Saintes began with an indecisive skirmish, in which the ships of the vanguard division, under Hood&#x27;s command, were severely damaged and forced to withdraw to make repairs. On 12 April, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; took part in the second action, which proved much more decisive. During the battle, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; had two lieutenants and 14 crewmen killed, and 22 others were wounded.

After the signing of the Treaties of Versailles brought an end to the Anglo-French War, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; returned from the West Indies to Chatham, where she was paid off and docked on 29 October 1783 for repairs and to have her copper sheathing replaced. She came out of dock on 4 June 1784 and was subsequently laid up in ordinary.

==French Revolutionary War==

===Under Nelson===
In anticipation of the start of Britain&#x27;s involvement in the French Revolutionary War after the execution of King Louis XVI, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was recommissioned on 31 January 1793. She was placed under the command of Captain Horatio Nelson and, after provisioning, joined the fleet lying at anchor at the Nore. She subsequently sailed to join the Mediterranean fleet under Vice-Admiral Hood, which was blockading the French port of Toulon. On 27 August, the town of Toulon declared its allegiance to the Royalist Bourbon cause, and Hood&#x27;s fleet moved in to take control of the naval dockyard and the 30 French ships of the line in the harbour. After capturing 19 ships, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was sent to Naples to ask King Ferdinand IV for reinforcements to secure the town; he agreed to provide 4,000 men. When the revolutionary army, commanded by Napoleon Buonaparte, launched its assault against Toulon, the troops proved insufficient to hold it, and they were forced to abandon the town. Later in the autumn, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; fought the inconclusive Action of 22 October 1793 against a French frigate squadron off Sardinia.

In April and May 1794, seamen from &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, led by Nelson, helped capture the Corsican town of Bastia. The French surrendered on 21 May after a 40-day siege. After this action, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was forced to sail to Gibraltar to undergo urgent repairs. The ship became worn out after just 16 months at sea despite having undergone a fairly extensive refit before being recommissioned. Upon completion of her repairs, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; returned to Corsica, anchoring south of Calvi on 18 June. After Hood arrived with additional ships, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; contributed guns and men to the 51-day siege of Calvi, during which time Nelson lost sight in his right eye when a French shot kicked sand and grit into his face. The town surrendered on 10 August, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; having lost six men in the engagement. Shortly after that, the inhabitants of Corsica declared themselves to be subjects of His Majesty King George III.
&quot;Agamemnon&quot;, still with the Mediterranean fleet—now under Vice-Admiral William Hotham, who had superseded Hood in December 1794—participated in the Battle of Genoa when a French fleet, comprising 15 ships of the line, was sighted on 10 March 1795. Three days later, the French having shown no signs that they were willing to give battle, Admiral Hotham ordered a general chase. The French ship &quot;Ça Ira&quot; lost her fore and main topmasts when she ran into one of the other ships of the French fleet, &quot;Victoire&quot;, allowing to catch up with and engage her. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and came up to assist soon after, and continued firing into the 80-gun French ship until the arrival of more French ships led to Admiral Hotham signalling for the British ships to retreat. &quot;Ça Ira&quot; was captured the following day, along with &quot;Censeur&quot;, which was towing her, by &quot;Captain&quot; and .

On 7 July 1795, whilst in company with a small squadron of frigates, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was chased by a French fleet of 22 ships of the line and 6 frigates. Due to adverse winds, Admiral Hotham was unable to come to her aid until the following day, and the French fleet was sighted again on 13 July, off the Hyères Islands. Hotham signalled for his 23 ships of the line to give chase, and in the ensuing Battle of the Hyères Islands, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was one of the few Royal Navy ships to engage the enemy fleet. The French ship &quot;Alcide&quot; struck her colours during the battle, only to catch fire and sink. Many of the other French ships were in a similar condition; &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and were manoeuvring to attack a French 80-gun ship when Admiral Hotham signalled his fleet to retreat, allowing the French to escape into the Gulf of Fréjus. Admiral Hotham was later greatly criticised for calling off the battle, and was relieved as Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean by Admiral Sir John Jervis at the end of the year.

Nelson was promoted to Commodore on 11 March. Shortly thereafter, in the action of 31 May 1796, boats from &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and Nelson&#x27;s squadron captured a small convoy of French vessels off the Franco-Italian coast, while suffering minimal casualties.

On 10 June 1796 Nelson transferred his pennant to , Captain John Samuel Smith replacing him as &quot;Agamemnon&quot;″s commander. Having been deemed in great need of repair, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; then returned to England.

===Mutiny and the Baltic===
In May 1797, whilst under the command of Captain Robert Fancourt, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was involved in the Nore mutiny. On 29 May, the North Sea squadron lying in the Yarmouth Roads was ordered to sea. Only three ships, , &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and , obeyed the signal, but &quot;Agamemnon&quot;″s crew later mutinied, and sailed the ship back to Yarmouth Roads. The ship was then taken to join the main mutiny at the Nore anchorage, along with , and , arriving on 7 June. After a blockade of London was formed by the mutineers, several ships began to desert the wider mutiny, in many cases being fired upon by the remaining ships. Order was eventually restored aboard &quot;Agamemnon&quot; when the loyal seamen and marines forcibly ejected the hard-line mutineers from the ship. Captain Fancourt was able to secure a pardon for the remaining ship&#x27;s company.

On 18 March 1800, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was damaged when she ran onto the Penmarks Rocks. She came into Falmouth on 25 March 1800. On her way to port she had encountered , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With the assistance of the crews from two sloops, the guardship , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the pumps, the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain on the men at the pumps once more, and when she was off Penlee Point, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.

In response to developments in the Baltic in 1801 that threatened to deprive Britain of much-needed naval supplies, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was sent as part of a fleet under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker and Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson to attack the Danish at Copenhagen. On 2 April, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was part of Nelson&#x27;s division that fought the Battle of Copenhagen. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was positioned second in the line after , and after passing down the Outer Channel, she grounded whilst attempting to round the southern tip of the Middle Ground shoal. While the battle raged around her &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, along with and , both of which had also run aground, flew signals of distress. The three stranded ships were eventually pulled off the Middle Ground in the night of 3 April.

After the Treaty of Amiens concluded the Revolutionary War, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was laid up at Chatham in 1802.

==Napoleonic Wars==
&quot;Agamemnon&quot;″s general condition in 1802 was so poor that, had hostilities with France not recommenced, she would likely have been hulked or broken up. Instead, after Britain&#x27;s entry into the Napoleonic Wars, she was brought out of ordinary in 1804, recommissioned under Captain John Harvey on 31 July, and went to join the Channel fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis.

&quot;Agamemnon&quot; was part of Vice-Admiral Robert Calder&#x27;s fleet cruising off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, when the combined Franco-Spanish fleet from the West Indies was sighted to windward. The British ships formed into line of battle, with &quot;Agamemnon&quot; fifth in the line, and engaged Admiral Villeneuve&#x27;s fleet in hazy conditions with light winds. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; had three men wounded in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, and lost her mizzen topmast and the foresail yard. By nightfall, Calder&#x27;s fleet had become scattered, and he signalled for the action to be discontinued.

===Battle of Trafalgar===
On 17 September 1805, after completing a small refit of his ship in Portsmouth, Captain Harvey was superseded in command of &quot;Agamemnon&quot; by Captain Sir Edward Berry, who had previously commanded Nelson&#x27;s flagship, , at the Battle of the Nile. On 3 October she departed Spithead to join Vice-Admiral Nelson&#x27;s fleet blockading Villeneuve&#x27;s combined fleet in Cádiz. En route, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; fell in with a French squadron, consisting of six ships of the line and several smaller vessels, which gave chase. Succeeding in evading the French, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; joined the blockading squadron on 13 October, and when Nelson laid eyes on the approaching ship he reportedly exclaimed: &quot;Here comes that damned fool Berry! Now we shall have a battle!&quot; In misty conditions on 20 October, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; captured a large American merchant brig, which she then took in tow. Not long after, signalled to &quot;Agamemnon&quot; that she was sailing straight towards an enemy fleet of 30 ships—Villeneuve&#x27;s fleet had left port.

On 21 October 1805 &quot;Agamemnon&quot; fought in the Battle of Trafalgar. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was positioned eighth in Nelson&#x27;s weather column, with ahead and astern. Once engaged, she was firing both batteries, eventually pounding the great Spanish four-decker &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; until that ship was dismasted and, with 216 of her complement dead, struck her colours. Before Berry could take possession of the prize, the enemy van division began bearing down on the British line, having previously been cut off from the battle by Nelson&#x27;s line-breaking tactics. With Nelson already dying below decks on &quot;Victory&quot;, Captain of the Fleet Thomas Hardy ordered &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and several other ships to intercept them. Three of the enemy ships broke off and ran for Cádiz; after briefly engaging &quot;Intrépide&quot; the British ships moved to try to cut off the fleeing ships. Over the course of the battle, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; suffered just two fatalities, and eight men were wounded.

Following the battle, &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, despite taking on three feet of water in her hold each hour, took under tow to Gibraltar. After carrying out repairs, the ship rejoined Vice-Admiral Collingwood&#x27;s squadron, which had resumed the blockade of Cádiz.

===Later career===
At the beginning of 1806, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was with Vice-Admiral Duckworth&#x27;s squadron in the West Indies, pursuing a French fleet carrying troops to Santo Domingo. On 6 February 1806, the two squadrons clashed in the Battle of San Domingo; &quot;Agamemnon&quot; assisted Duckworth&#x27;s flagship in driving the French Vice-Admiral Leissègues&#x27; flagship &quot;Impérial&quot; onto the shore where she was wrecked. In October, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; escorted a convoy on her return to Britain.

In 1807 &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was part of Admiral James Gambier&#x27;s fleet sent to take control of the Danish fleet before it could fall into French hands. She participated in the second Battle of Copenhagen, and as in the first in 1801, ran aground. After she had come free, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; landed guns and shot in Kjörge Bay to form part of a battery being established there to command the city. Firing commenced on 2 September, and lasted until the Danes surrendered on 7 September. In November, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; joined the blockading squadron off Lisbon.

==Loss==
In February 1808, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; sailed with Rear-Admiral Sir Sidney Smith&#x27;s flagship to Brazil, where they joined another squadron. At Rio de Janeiro it was discovered that &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was again quite worn out, with seams in her planking opening and some of her framing bolts broken. In October, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and anchored in Maldonado Bay, in the mouth of the River Plate. They had been escorting the merchant vessel &quot;Maria&quot;, which had carried the surgeon Dr. James Paroissien to Montevideo where he was tasked with exposing a plot against King John VI of Portugal, who was in exile in Brazil. Whilst there, &quot;Monarch&quot; ran aground, requiring &quot;Agamemnon&quot;″s assistance to get her off. After learning that Paroissien had been imprisoned, the two ships put to sea, but were forced to return to Maldonado Bay when they encountered bad weather. After the ships returned to Rio in January 1809, the ship was fully surveyed by the carpenter, who drew up an extensive list of her defects.
On 16 June 1809. &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, along with the rest of the squadron (which was now under the command of Rear-Admiral Michael de Courcy), put into Maldonado Bay for the third and final time, to shelter from a storm. While working her way between Gorriti Island and the shore, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; struck an uncharted shoal. Captain Jonas Rose attempted to use the ship&#x27;s boats, together with the stream and kedge anchors, to pull the ship off, but to no avail. The ship had dropped anchor on the shoal just previously, and it was discovered that she had run onto it when she grounded, the anchor having pierced the hull. On 17 June, with the ship listing heavily to starboard, &quot;Agamemnon&quot;″s stores and all her crew were taken off by boats from other vessels in the squadron, and the following day Captain Rose and his officers left the ship.

The court-martial for the loss of &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was held at Rio de Janeiro on 22 July 1809, aboard . It was found that the ship might have been saved if she had not been in such poor general condition, and Captain Rose was honourably acquitted.

 arrived on 4 August, and stayed with the transports &quot;Kingston&quot; and &quot;Neptune&quot; as they salvaged what could be salvaged from &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. &quot;Neptune&quot; left on 22 September, but &quot;Kingston&quot; and &quot;Nancy&quot; stayed as &quot;Kingston&quot; continued salvage efforts. On 16 November a gale came up and late the next day boats sent to the wreck reported that she was strewn in pieces all over the beach. On 28 November &quot;Nancy&quot; and &quot;Kingston&quot; departed together, but soon separated with &quot;Nancy&quot; sailing for Rio de Janeiro, which she reached on 15 December.

==Legacy==
In March 1993, the wreck was located north of Gorriti Island in Maldonado, Uruguay Bay Punta del Este by sonar operator Crayton Fenn. Sonar used was a Klien 595 system. Later in 1997, with the help of Mensun Bound documented the remains and recovered several artefacts, including a seal bearing the name &#x27;Nelson,&#x27; and one of &quot;Agamemnon&quot;″s 24-pounder guns from her main gundeck.

The historical novelist Patrick O&#x27;Brian selected &quot;Agamemnon&quot; as one of the ships on which Jack Aubrey served as lieutenant before the events of &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, the first novel in his Aubrey–Maturin series.&quot;Agamemnon&quot; has also been the subject of at least two paintings by the British artist Geoff Hunt, a former president of the Royal Society of Marine Artists.

To mark the bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar, in 2005, the Woodland Trust planted 33 woods named after Royal Navy ships that fought in the battle: one each for the 27 ships of the line and six others for the frigates and smaller support craft. Agamemnon wood was planted in November 2005 on the Beaulieu Estate in Hampshire, near &quot;Agamemnon&quot;″s birthplace, Buckler&#x27;s Hard.

After the wreck of &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in 1809, the name was reused by the Royal Navy for three other ships: the 91-gun second-rate steamship of the line of 1852, the in 1879, and the of 1906.

The Royal Navy will again adopt the name &#x27;Agamemnon&#x27; for one of their &quot;Astute&quot;-class nuclear submarines, currently under construction in the UK.

Agamemnon Channel in the Sunshine Coast region of British Columbia, at the mouth of Jervis Inlet between Nelson Island and the Sechelt Peninsula, was named for &quot;Agamemnon&quot; by Captain George Henry Richards of HMS &quot;Plumper&quot; in 1860.

Herman Melville chooses the Agamemnon for the origin of the old Dansker in his novella Billy Budd.

Historical fantasy novelist Natasha Pulley uses the Agamemnon as a significant setting in her alternate history novel &quot;The Kingdoms&quot;.

<text>HD 74156 is a yellow dwarf star (spectral type G0V) in the constellation of Hydra, 187 light years from the Solar System. It is known to be orbited by two giant planets.

==Star==
This star is 24% more massive and 64% larger than the Sun. The total luminosity is 2.96 times that of the Sun and its temperature 5960 K. The age of the star is estimated at 3.7 billion years, with metallicity 1.35 times that of the Sun based on its abundance of iron.

==Planetary system==
In April 2001, two giant planets were announced orbiting the star. The first planet HD 74156 b orbits the star at a distance closer than Mercury is to the Sun, in an extremely eccentric orbit. The second planet HD 74156 c is a long-period, massive planet (at least 8 times the mass of Jupiter), which orbits the star in an elliptical orbit with a semimajor axis of 3.90 astronomical units. In 2022, the inclination and true mass of HD 74156 c were measured via astrometry.


===Claims of a third planet===
Given the two-planet configuration of the system under the assumption that the orbits are coplanar and have masses equal to their minimum masses, an additional Saturn-mass planet would be stable in a region between 0.9 and 1.4 AU between the orbits of the two known planets. Under the &quot;packed planetary systems&quot; hypothesis, which predicts that planetary systems form in such a way that the system could not support additional planets between the orbits of the existing ones, the gap would be expected to host a planet.

In September 2007, a third planet with a mass at least 0.396 Jupiter masses was announced to be orbiting between planets b and c with an eccentric orbit. The planet, orbiting in a region of the planetary system previously known to be stable for additional planets, was seen as a confirmation of the &quot;packed planetary systems&quot; hypothesis. However, Roman V. Baluev has cast doubt on this discovery, suggesting that the observed variations may be due to annual errors in the data. A subsequent search using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope also failed to confirm the planet, and further data obtained using HIRES instrument strongly contradicts its existence.

<doc id="1211913" wikidata="Q6134913" url="?curid=1211913" title="Least fixed point">
<text>In order theory, a branch of mathematics, the least fixed point (lfp or LFP, sometimes also smallest fixed point) of a function from a partially ordered set (&quot;poset&quot; for short) to itself is the fixed point which is less than each other fixed point, according to the order of the poset. A function need not have a least fixed point, but if it does then the least fixed point is unique.

==Examples==
With the usual order on the real numbers, the least fixed point of the real function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;2 is &quot;x&quot; = 0 (since the only other fixed point is 1 and 0 &lt; 1). In contrast, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + 1 has no fixed points at all, so has no least one, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; has infinitely many fixed points, but has no least one.

Let formula_1 be a directed graph and formula_2 be a vertex. The set of vertices accessible from formula_2 can be defined as the least fixed-point of the function formula_4, defined as formula_5
The set of vertices which are co-accessible from formula_2 is defined by a similar least fix-point. The strongly connected component of formula_2 is the intersection of those two least fixed-points.

Let formula_8 be a context-free grammar. The set formula_9 of symbols which produces the empty string formula_10 can be obtained as the least fixed-point of the function formula_4, defined as formula_12, where formula_13 denotes the power set of formula_14.

==Applications==
Many fixed-point theorems yield algorithms for locating the least fixed point. Least fixed points often have desirable properties that arbitrary fixed points do not.

===Denotational semantics===
In computer science, the &quot;denotational semantics&quot; approach uses least fixed points to obtain from a given program text a corresponding mathematical function, called its semantics. To this end, an artificial mathematical object, formula_15, is introduced, denoting the exceptional value &quot;undefined&quot;.
Given e.g. the program datatype codice_1, its mathematical counterpart is defined as formula_16
it is made a partially ordered set by defining formula_17 for each formula_18 and letting any two different members formula_19 be uncomparable w.r.t. formula_20, see picture. 

The semantics of a program definition codice_2 is some mathematical function formula_21 If the program definition codice_3 does not terminate for some input codice_4, this can be expressed mathematically as formula_22 The set of all mathematical functions is made partially ordered by defining formula_23 if, for each formula_24 the relation formula_25 holds, that is, if formula_26 is less defined or equal to formula_27 For example, the semantics of the expression codice_5 is less defined than that of codice_6, since the former, but not the latter, maps formula_28 to formula_29 and they agree otherwise.

Given some program text codice_3, its mathematical counterpart is obtained as least fixed point of some mapping from functions to functions that can be obtained by &quot;translating&quot; codice_3.
For example, the C definition 
int fact(int n) { if (n == 0) return 1; else return n * fact(n-1); }
is translated to a mapping 
:formula_30 defined as formula_31 
The mapping formula_32 is defined in a non-recursive way, although codice_9 was defined recursively.
Under certain restrictions (see Kleene fixed-point theorem), which are met in the example, formula_32 necessarily has a least fixed point, formula_34, that is formula_35 for all formula_36. 
It is possible to show that 
:formula_37 

A larger fixed point of formula_32 is e.g. the function formula_39 defined by 
:formula_40 
however, this function does not correctly reflect the behavior of the above program text for negative formula_41 e.g. the call codice_10 will not terminate at all, let alone return codice_11.
Only the &quot;least&quot; fixed point, formula_42 can reasonably be used as a mathematical program semantic.

===Descriptive complexity===
Immerman
and Vardi
independently showed the descriptive complexity result that the polynomial-time computable properties of linearly ordered structures are definable in FO(LFP), i.e. in first-order logic with a least fixed point operator. However, FO(LFP) is too weak to express all polynomial-time properties of unordered structures (for instance that a structure has even size).

==Greatest fixed points==
The greatest fixed point of a function can be defined analogously to the least fixed point, as the fixed point which is greater than any other fixed point, according to the order of the poset. In computer science, greatest fixed points are much less commonly used than least fixed points. Specifically, the posets found in domain theory usually do not have a greatest element, hence for a given function, there may be multiple, mutually incomparable maximal fixed points, and the greatest fixed point of that function may not exist. To address this issue, the &quot;optimal fixed point&quot; has been defined as the most-defined fixed point compatible with all other fixed points. The optimal fixed point always exists, and is the greatest fixed point if the greatest fixed point exists. The optimal fixed point allows formal study of recursive and corecursive functions that do not converge with the least fixed point. Unfortunately, whereas Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorem shows that the least fixed point is effectively computable, the optimal fixed point of a computable function may be a non-computable function.

<text>HD 82943 (164 G. Hydrae) is a star with a pair of orbiting exoplanets in the equatorial constellation of Hydra. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 6.54, which is near the lower limit of visibility to the naked eye. Based on parallax measurements, the distance to this system is 90.3 light years. It is drifting further away with a heliocentric radial velocity of 8.1 km/s. The star shows a high proper motion, traversing the celestial sphere at an angular rate of .

The spectrum of HD 82943 presents as an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of . The suffix notation indicates a mild strengthening of iron lines relative to a typical star of its type. Nonetheless, it is considered a metal-rich star, having a higher abundance of many elements with masses greater than helium as compared to the Sun. This star is around 3 billion years old and is spinning with a rotation period of 18 days. It is 14% more massive and has a 17% larger radius than the Sun. The star is radiating 154% of the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,944 K.

== Planetary system ==

The first exoplanet discovered (designated HD 82943 b) was announced in 2000 by a team of French astronomers led by Michel Mayor. The exoplanet orbits its parent star at a mean distance of 1.19 astronomical units (AU) and taking approximately 441 days to complete the orbit. Nearly a year later, a second exoplanet (designated HD 82943 c) was announced by the same discoverers of the previous planet. This exoplanet orbits closer than the other, at a mean distance of 0.746 AU and taking 219 days to complete its orbit. The two known exoplanet appear to have a 2:1 resonance with one another. Further radial velocity analysis hinted at either long-period stellar activity or presence of a third Jovian exoplanet with an orbital period of 1075 days.

Announced in 2001, HD 82943 was found to contain an unusually high abundance of lithium-6. Upon reaching a sufficient core temperature, young stars quickly burn through their initial allotment of lithium-6, whereas planets should retain their lithium-6. Thus the simplest and most convincing answer to explain this observation is that one or more planets, or at least planetary material, have fallen into the star sometime after it passed through its early evolutionary stage.

A circumstellar debris disk was discovered in 2003, based on an infrared excess detected in the system. The inner edge of this disk orbits at a distance of from the host star. The distance to the outer edge is poorly constrained.

<text>David Courtney Boyle (born 1958) is a British author and journalist who writes mainly about history and new ideas in economics, money, business, and culture. He lives in Steyning in West Sussex. He conducted an independent review for the Treasury and the Cabinet Office on public demand for choice in public services which reported in 2013. He is co-founder and policy director of Radix, which he characterized in 2017 as a radical centrist think tank. He is also co-director of the mutual think tank New Weather Institute.

==Writing==
His book &quot;Authenticity&quot; put the phenomenon on the business and political agenda. His previous books &quot;The Tyranny of Numbers&quot; and &quot;The Sum of Our Discontent&quot; predicted and fermented the backlash against target culture. &quot;Funny Money&quot; helped launched the time banks movement in the UK.
More recently, his writing has suggested why organisations and public services can be ineffective. He worked with the New Economics Foundation and NESTA on a series of publications about coproduction. His solutions are also published in &quot;The Human Element&quot;. This argues that organisations have abandoned human skills in favour of numerical targets or IT systems, which frustrate the business of building relationships and making things happen. He helped to launch the popular campaign against the failures of the Southern Rail franchise with his book &quot;Cancelled!&quot;, and his experimental &#x27;passenger strike&#x27; in 2017.

His history books usually have a business or economic dimension, including &quot;Blondel&#x27;s Song&quot; (UK) and &quot;The Troubadour&#x27;s Song&quot; (USA) about the imprisonment and ransom of Richard the Lionheart. His 2008 book &quot;Toward the Setting Sun&quot; tells the intertwined story of Christopher Columbus, John Cabot and Amerigo Vespucci and their race for America in the 1490s. His 2010 book, &quot;Eminent Corporations&quot; (with Andrew Simms) has introduced a new genre, the mini-corporate biography, launching the idea of corporate history as tragedy. His 2013 book &quot;Broke&quot; argued that the middle classes were also being squeezed by the political and economic elite.

He has been the editor of several non-peer-reviewed journals including &quot;New Economics&quot; and &quot;Town &amp; Country Planning&quot;. He is a fellow of the New Economics Foundation.

He was editor of the weekly &quot;Liberal Democrat News&quot; from 1992 to 1998. He edited the Foundation&#x27;s publications &quot;New Economics&quot;, &quot;News from the New Economy&quot;, and then &quot;Radical Economics&quot; from 1987 to 2010.

==Other work==
He has been involved with developing coproduction and introducing time banks to Britain as part of public service reform, developing the idea of coproduction with the innovation agency Nesta. He has been involved in the Clone Town Britain campaign and writes about the future of volunteering, cities and business.

Boyle helped found the London Time Bank, and was co-founder of Time Banking UK. He has been a candidate for Parliament of the United Kingdom, and sat on the federal policy committee of the Liberal Democrats from 1998 to 2012. He was Lib Dem Blogger of the Year 2013.

<doc id="1211917" wikidata="Q848622" url="?curid=1211917" title="Shinnōke">
<text>was the collective name for the four cadet branches of the Imperial family of Japan, which were until 1947 entitled to provide a successor to the Chrysanthemum throne if the main line failed to produce an heir. The heads of these royal houses held the title of , regardless of their genealogical distance from the reigning Emperor, as the term &quot;seshū&quot; in their designation meant that they were eligible for succession.

==History==
The Imperial family of Japan considers itself a single dynasty in unbroken succession; however, the succession has often not been directly from father to son, but has been in the male line within a closely related group of people. In the Muromachi period, Prince Yoshihito, the son of the Northern Emperor Sukō was permitted to establish a parallel lineage to the main imperial line, and took the name Fushimi-no-miya from the location of his palace. Without this permission, the line would be considered commoners, and therefore excluded from the succession. This served politically to cement the reunification of the Northern and Southern Court, but provided insurance in the extreme event that the main imperial line should fail to produce a direct heir and become extinct.

This proved to be a fortunate decision, as in 1428, the son of the 2nd Prince Fushimi-no-miya ascended the throne as Emperor Go-Hanazono.

In the Edo period, three additional &quot;seshū shinnōke&quot; households were created by the Tokugawa shogunate, in conscious imitation of the Tokugawa Gosanke.

However, aside from Emperor Go-Hanazono, the only time a member of the &quot;seshū shinnōke&quot; ascended to the throne was in 1779, when the son of Prince Kan&#x27;in-no-miya Sukehito became Emperor Kōkaku. 

Within the &quot;seshū shinnōke&quot; households, younger non-heir sons (who were titled ), had two career options. They could &quot;descend&quot; to subject status with a surname such as Minamoto or Taira, and serve as a government official, or they could enter the Buddhist priesthood, generally as the head of one of the &quot;monzeki&quot; temples in and around Kyoto. During the Edo period, the latter practice became almost universal. Non-heir sons who entered the priesthood were styled , and were automatically excluded from the succession, but could be recalled to &quot;secular&quot; status (and thus reinstated as potential successors) if the need arose. Unwed daughters, once they crossed a certain age, often became Buddhist nuns. However, marriage was the norm for them, and they could hope to enter the highest houses of the land. The great &quot;seshū shinnōke&quot; houses gave their daughters in marriage only to families of high rank, such as the &quot;kuge,&quot; &quot;daimyō&quot; or Tokugawa houses, if not to the imperial family. During and after the Meiji Restoration, members of the &quot;seshū shinnōke,&quot; whether they were elder sons or younger sons, often served in the Imperial Japanese Army or Imperial Japanese Navy.

==The four &quot;seshū shinnōke&quot; lineages==
The four &quot;seshū shinnōke&quot; were, in order of creation:
# Fushimi-no-miya, founded 1409, still extant
# Katsura-no-miya, founded 1589, extinct 1881
# Arisugawa-no-miya, founded 1625, extinct 1913; revived as Takamatsu-no-miya, extinct 1987 
# Kan&#x27;in-no-miya, founded 1704, extinct 1842; revived 1872, extinct 1988

The sixteenth son of Prince Kuniie, the twentieth head of the Fushimi-no-miya, succeeded to the Kan&#x27;in-no-miya house in 1872, but the house died out in 1988 on the death of his son. 

The Fushimi-no-miya house was the progenitor of ten other cadet branches of the imperial family, the&quot; ōke,&quot; during the reign of Emperor Meiji. After the 25th Fushimi-no-miya, the &quot;seshu shinnōke&quot; ceased to exist. The current head of Fushimi-no-miya, Fushimi Hiroaki, has three daughters and no male heirs to carry on the family name and title. When he dies, the last remaining &quot;seshū shinnōke&quot; lineage will become extinct. Five of the original ten &quot;ōke&quot; lineages still have male descendants.

==Dissolution==
The &quot;shinnōke&quot; and ōke households, along with the &quot;kazoku&quot; (Japanese peerage) and the &quot;shizoku&quot; (Warrior families) were reduced to Japanese nationals (Nihon kokumin) status during the American occupation of Japan, in October 1947.

<text>Alex Band (born June 8, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as the vocalist for the Los Angeles-based rock band the Calling. He performed their hit song &quot;Wherever You Will Go,&quot; which topped the Adult Top 40 for 23 weeks, making it the second-longest-running number one single in the chart&#x27;s history. Furthermore, it was later named the number one song of the 2000s decade on the Adult Pop Charts by &quot;Billboard&quot;.

Along with the band&#x27;s lead guitarist and fellow songwriter Aaron Kamin, they achieved success with the release of their first two studio albums; &quot;Camino Palmero&quot; (2001), which sold over 5 million copies worldwide and was certified Gold by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), as well as their second album &quot;Two&quot; (2004), which sold over 1.5 million copies. The former spawned a successful follow-up single, &quot;Adrienne&quot; while the latter spawned the singles &quot;Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Things Will Go My Way.&quot;

As a solo artist, Band is known for his guest performance on Santana&#x27;s 2003 hit single &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You &amp; I.&quot; In 2008, he formed his own record label AMB Records and released a five-song eponymous extended play (EP). Band later released his debut full-length album, &quot;We&#x27;ve All Been There&quot;, in June 2010 with &quot;Tonight&quot; as its lead single—which was used as the theme song for the 2010 World Cup. He released his second EP, &quot;After the Storm&quot; in 2012.

==Early life==
Alex Band was born in Los Angeles, California, into an entertainment family. His mother is Meda Band (née Robertson), and his father, Charles Band, is a horror film director. His grandfather Albert Band was also another well-known director. Band&#x27;s father is Jewish and his mother is Christian. Both his parents were raised in Italy and they owned a castle in Giove, Umbria. Band explores spiritual themes in several of his songs, though he claims to be of no particular faith himself. Of the song &quot;Please&quot;, Band said; &quot;...I grew up with a Jewish father who didn&#x27;t practice and a Christian mother whose only tie to Jesus was celebrating Christmas. Needless to say I had to find my own religion. And in this song I&#x27;m asking God what that should be...what should I believe? In a world so full of different religions and so many people fighting over whose belief is the correct one, it frustrates me to think that they all really boil down to the same thing.&quot;

At a young age, Band&#x27;s parents divorced and his father remarried. He grew up with two of his half-brothers, Harlan and Zalman, and his sister, Taryn. In 2020, his younger half-brother Harlan died after battling with addiction for over a decade. After his parents&#x27; divorce, his mother moved to Germany where she remarried and still resides. Band was about 8 at the time. She had three sons after her move, who Band eventually met when he toured Germany. The single &quot;Could It Be Any Harder&quot; explains some of his feelings towards his mother&#x27;s move.

Growing up, Band made small appearances in his father&#x27;s films. He grew up on Camino Palmero street, which would later inspire his first album of the same name. He began playing guitar and songwriting at the age of 8. Musically, Band was influenced by Pearl Jam, Bon Jovi, Live, Train and U2. At the age of 14, he had a kokopelli tattooed on his wrist. This would later become a symbol for the Calling.

==The Calling==
===1996–1999: Early formation===
He soon formed his first band with friend and filmmaker, Jethro Rothe-Kushel, called &quot;Maybe Solitude&quot;. Rothe-Kushel also directed his first music video for a song called &quot;Dormant Prayer&quot;. After the band disbanded, Band met Aaron Kamin when Kamin was dating Band&#x27;s sister. They both began writing songs and jamming as far back as 1996 and soon formed the band Generation Gap that consisted of him and Kamin, and a few much older musicians. At this stage, the band also had saxophonist, Benny Golbin, giving the songs a more jazzy sound reminiscent of Dave Matthews Band.

Eventually, Band and Kamin ditched the &quot;Gap&quot; lineup, and briefly switched their name to &quot;Next Door&quot;, which itself was a nod to Ron Fair, a veteran music business executive and Band&#x27;s neighbor.

Kamin and Band began focusing on songwriting more, and as Band&#x27;s signature baritone voice began to mature, the duo began leaving demo tapes of new songs and ideas for Fair in his mailbox. They quickly found a similar sound amongst such ready-for-radio rock acts of the early 21st century as Matchbox Twenty, Third Eye Blind, Train, and Fastball.

By 1999, Fair was impressed enough by the demos to sign them to a record deal with RCA. They changed their name to the Calling, which reflected the band&#x27;s renewed sense of purpose.

===1999–2005: &quot;Camino Palmero&quot; and &quot;Two&quot;===
At the age of 15, Band signed with RCA Records with the band he had created with Kamin, now named the Calling. At this time, he dropped out of school, though he later received a diploma through home schooling. The Calling released their first single &quot;Wherever You Will Go&quot; to much acclaim. The song soon reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot AC charts for 23 weeks and peaked at number 5 on the Hot 100 charts as well as becoming an international hit. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Camino Palmero&quot;, soon followed, peaking at number 36 on the Billboard Sales charts and eventually went Platinum. The band&#x27;s next singles, &quot;Adrienne&quot; and &quot;Could It Be Any Harder&quot; soon followed, charting in the AC top 40.

However, by 2004, the second album, titled &quot;Two&quot;, failed to live up to expectations, charting at number 54 on Billboard Top 200. The album suffered from a lack of label support, though the singles fared slightly better. The first single, &quot;Our Lives,&quot; was featured in the 2004 Olympics ceremony and charted at number 34 in the Billboard top 40. A final single, &quot;Anything,&quot; performed decently with little promotion, charting at number 23 in the Adult Top 40.

After the lack of label support with &quot;Two&quot;, the band announced a hiatus. On June 4, 2005, they performed their last concert to date in Temecula, CA.

===2013–present: Reunion and upcoming album===
On August 15, 2013, Alex Band reformed the Calling with new members. The group performed their comeback gig at Bally&#x27;s Atlantic City on August 17. On August 18, Band was reportedly abducted by two men who robbed him, beat him severely, and dumped him on train tracks in Lapeer, Michigan. He was taken to an emergency room at a nearby hospital, where he was treated and released. After only a few shows, the group broke up again.

In October 2016, the Calling reformed with a new lineup and performed in Manila, Philippines, the following month. The Australian company Unbreakable Touring announced that the band were to perform in cities that included Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Fremantle, along with the rock band Juke Kartel and newcomer Mike Waters, but this was later postponed due to visa issues. In July 2017, it was announced that the Calling would be joining Lifehouse as support acts for Live&#x27;s Australian leg of their world reunion tour.

Band said in an interview with the Australian music website May the Rock Be with You in November 2017 that the Calling would be releasing new music soon.

In February 2020, in a YouTube video interview with Gareth Burrough of the Welsh podcast &quot;Steegcast&quot;, Band spoke of the future, including a plan to release new music as well as eventually releasing orchestral reworkings of some of the group&#x27;s back catalogue.

The Calling released a brand new track, &quot;Fallin&#x27; Apart&quot;, on August 7, 2023. The song was written and produced for a campaign in association with Singapore-based company Income Insurance and was made available on streaming platforms.

==Solo career==
===2005–2008: &quot;Alex Band EP&quot;===

In November 2005 it was announced Band had signed as a solo artist with Ron Fair as part of Geffen Records. A new album had been recorded and was said to be released in late 2007, but was delayed several times. Band left the Geffen label in 2008. Band also contributed the song &quot;The Truth&quot; to the soundtrack of the 2005 movie &quot;Doll Graveyard&quot; which was directed by his father.

During this time Band had a few releases. One of his songs titled, &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Get Better Than This&quot; for &quot;&quot; soundtrack. Band performed and co-wrote the song, &quot;Coming Home&quot; which was featured in the film, &quot;The Final Season&quot; in late 2007.

In October 2007 Band performed at the first Alex Band&#x27;s Donate Life Rocks charity concert for &quot;Donate Life America&quot; in Los Angeles, CA. The concert was taped and will air on DISH Network. Band also taped an appearance on &quot;The Real World: Hollywood&quot; which filmed at the concert. The second Alex Band Donate Life concert was held in Richmond, VA on August 21, 2008. The first music video in his solo career was again directed by lifelong friend and director / producer, Jethro Rothe-Kushel, for a song called &quot;Only One&quot;. On April 25, 2008, Band released a 5-song EP titled, &quot;Alex Band EP&quot;. The EP contained four new songs in addition to the song &quot;Coming Home&quot;. The EP is sold via his official fan site. A new version of the EP was created for his tour in Brazil. On May 13 it was announced that the track, &quot;Only One&quot; would be the official single, for Brazil only, with both single and video available through Band&#x27;s official fan site.

===2008–2011: &quot;We&#x27;ve All Been There&quot;===
Band expressed displeasure with the continued delayed release of his debut album. On April 16, 2008, Band announced via his official fan site that he had left Geffen and created his own label called AMB Records under which the album in the US will be released, after buying back the rights to the master tapes after Geffen had gone through major restructuring. Band states: I&#x27;ve been working on leaving my label for a while now, and moving to somewhere else to put this record out finally and give it the push it deserves... and I&#x27;m happy to announce that I will be putting the record out on my own! With help from good friends in the business and an amazing team, I&#x27;m putting together my own label. This gives me the freedom to make my own decisions, to invest in myself, and to do what I want, when I want. This is the way to go these days in the music business and I am so lucky to be able to do it. There are no firm details as to when exactly the record will be released, but I am doing everything in my power to make the process as speedy as possible. I will let you all know of course as soon as I find out more.

The first single &quot;Tonight&quot; was released on February 15, 2010, and entered the US Adult Pop charts at thirty one, also charting in countries including Austria, Germany, and Japan.

His debut solo album &quot;We&#x27;ve All Been There&quot; was released on June 29, 2010, in a distribution deal with EMI Records. The album entered the US Heatseekers charts at forty-two. The album achieved success in Germany, charting at number twelve.

Band released three more singles; &quot;Without You&quot;, the second single from the album, was released digitally. The European exclusive third single &quot;Only One&quot; (a track originally released on his self titled EP) entered the German charts at sixty-six and was featured in American TV shows &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;. The music video was directed by long time friend Jethro Rothe-Kushel. The fourth and final single &quot;Euphoria&quot; was released in Germany only. The music video featured home footage of Band and his former partner Kristin Blanford.

===2012: &quot;After the Storm&quot;===
Band released his second EP titled &quot;After the Storm&quot; through the Killer Tracks label. The track &quot;Shape of Your Heart&quot; was featured in a Korean commercial for the Kia Sorento, and the track &quot;Take Me Back&quot; was featured in an episode of the Spanish Netflix show &quot;Cable Girls&quot;.

==Other projects==

===Songwriting===
During and after his time in the Calling, Band and Kamin co-wrote all of the band&#x27;s songs. They also wrote songs for several other artists as well as for several movie soundtracks, most of which Band would perform on. One of the first such tracks was the single, &quot;For You&quot; which appeared on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack. The OST peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Top 200.

A cover of &quot;Keep Your Hands to Yourself&quot; was recorded for the movie &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;. Band recorded a song &quot;Take Hold of Me&quot; for use in his wife&#x27;s movie &quot;Fish Without a Bicycle&quot; in which he has a small part. He also Appeared on the &quot;&quot;.

Band wrote the track &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; with American singer songwriter Jon McLaughlin for his second studio album &quot;OK Now&quot;, where Band also provided backing vocals.

===Collaborations===
He was personally chosen by Chad Kroeger to perform on the Carlos Santana single &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You &amp; I&quot; in 2003. Originally, Kroeger wrote and sang on &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You &amp; I&quot; for Santana&#x27;s &quot;Shaman&quot;. However, when Arista Records decided to release the song as a single, Kroeger&#x27;s record label refused permission, citing concerns that Kroeger appearing on a &quot;high-profile single&quot; that could conflict with his own newly released comeback album.

Band&#x27;s version became extremely successful charting at number 3 on the Billboard Top 40, and number 8 on the Billboard Top 100. It was also recently named the number 5 song of the decade on the Adult Pop charts by Billboard. It reached number 1 on the AC charts and continues to be played on AC stations to this day. Band&#x27;s version appears on Santana&#x27;s special release album, &quot;Ceremony: remixes &amp; rarities&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Santana&quot;.

In 2009, Band collaborated with Brazilian singer-songwriter Yasmin Lucas on the song &quot;In Your Heart, I&#x27;m Home&quot;. The song entered the Brazilian charts at forty-seven and was featured on the Brazilian telenova &quot;Bela, a Feia&quot;, based on the American series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;.

In 2010, the song &quot;Cruel One&quot; featured Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk and American actress Emmy Rossum, which features as a bonus track to Band&#x27;s solo album &quot;We&#x27;ve All Been There&quot;.

Band collaborated with Joanna Pacitti on the track &quot;A Part of Me&quot;.

In October 2016, Band was featured as a guest artist for the song &quot;Donde Quiera Que Vayas Yo Iré&quot; (a Spanish version to the hit song &quot;Wherever You Will Go&quot;) by Venezuelan actress Gabriela Spanic. The song was released digitally on October 28, 2016.

Band also appeared on the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Help&quot;, which aired January 14, 2009. Band played a drugged-out musician who is the suspect in a murder case. The songs he performed were his own (as did fellow guest star Bonnie McKee). He has said there will be more acting in the future.

===Charity work===
Band has worked with several charities. After an illness his ex-wife dealt with, Band became a supporter of organ donation, working closely with the charity Donate Life America. Annually, he performs at &quot;Alex Band&#x27;s Donate Life Rocks Concert&quot; to raise money and awareness for the cause.

Each year Debbie Hagerman, who ran his official fan site, organized a birthday charity project in Band&#x27;s name, asking that, in lieu of gifts, fans donate to a charity instead. In addition, a calendar was produced each year showcasing Band in concert. All proceeds went to the Alex Band Education Fund for Donate Life America. The projects have raised over $30,000 in honor of Band.

Band is also active in promoting awareness and involvement in The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#x27;s Disease. He was diagnosed in 2012 with young onset Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which he announced during a benefit show performed on Stageit from Ryan Cabrera&#x27;s home on March 23, 2013.

==Early life and education==
Audra McDonald was born in West Berlin, West Germany, the daughter of American parents, Anna Kathryn (Jones), a university administrator, and Stanley James McDonald Jr., a high school principal. At the time of her birth, her father was stationed with the United States Army. McDonald was raised in her father&#x27;s native Fresno, California, the elder of two daughters; her sister, Alison, writes and directs for television and film. McDonald graduated from the Roosevelt School of the Arts program within Theodore Roosevelt High School in Fresno.

She got her start in acting with Dan Pessano and Roger Rocka&#x27;s Good Company Players, beginning in their junior company. In a feature article about her written when she was a child, she said that she knew she wanted to be involved in theater &quot;when I had my first chance to perform with the Good Company Players Junior Company.&quot; She also said that the people who have had the most impact on her life are &quot;Good Company director Dan Pessano and my mother.&quot; She studied classical voice as an undergraduate under Ellen Faull at the Juilliard School, graduating in 1993.

==Career==
=== 1992–1999: Early work and breakthrough ===

McDonald made her Broadway debut as a replacement portraying Ayah in the musical &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; in from 1992 to 1993. For her role as Carrie Pipperidge in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;Carousel&quot; (1994), she won her first Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. The following year she played Sharon Graham in the Terrence McNally play &quot;Master Class&quot; (1995) earning her second Tony Award, this time for Best Featured Actress in a Play. From 1997 to 1999 she played Sarah in the musical &quot;Ragtime&quot; at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, which had a book written by McNally. She won her third Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. In 1999 she played Marie Christine L&#x27;Adrese in the musical &quot;Marie Christine&quot; on Broadway and The Beggar Woman in &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; at Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center.

McDonald has also made many television and film appearances, both musical and dramatic. In 1996 she made her film acting debut in &quot;Seven Servants&quot; by Daryush Shokof. After being cast in &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; and &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot;, in 1999, she appeared on the television series &quot;&quot;; in television remake of &quot;Annie&quot; as Daddy Warbucks&#x27;s secretary &amp; soon-to-be wife, Miss Farrell; and in the television film &quot;Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters&#x27; First 100 Years.&quot; In 2000, McDonald acted in two episodes of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and in the television film &quot;The Last Debate.&quot;

===2000–2010: Broadway stardom and acclaim===
McDonald was a three-time Tony Award winner by age 28 for her performances in &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Master Class&quot;, and &quot;Ragtime&quot;, placing her alongside Shirley Booth, Gwen Verdon and Zero Mostel by accomplishing this feat within five years. She was nominated for another Tony Award for her performance in &quot;Marie Christine&quot; before she won her fourth in 2004 for her role in &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;, placing her in the company of then four-time winning actress Angela Lansbury. She reprised her &quot;Raisin&quot; role for a 2008 television adaptation, earning her a second Emmy Award nomination. McDonald would later score her fifth Tony Award win for her portrayal of Bess in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;The Gershwins&#x27; Porgy and Bess&quot;, thus tying Angela Lansbury and Julie Harris, and her 2014 performance as Billie Holiday in &quot;Lady Day at Emerson&#x27;s Bar and Grill&quot; would earn McDonald her sixth Tony award and make her the first person to win all four acting categories.

In 2001, she received her first Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for the HBO film &quot;Wit&quot;, which starred Emma Thompson and was directed by Mike Nichols. In 2003, McDonald starred as Sarah Langley in &quot;It Runs in the Family,&quot; and as Jackie Brock in nine episodes of short-lived &quot;Mister Sterling.&quot; From 2005 to 2006, she acted in several television series and films, such as &quot;The Bedford Diaries&quot; and &quot;Kidnapped,&quot; while from 2007 to 2013 she played Dr. Naomi Bennett in &quot;Private Practice&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy,&quot; replacing Merrin Dungey, who played the role in the series pilot. She sang with the New York Philharmonic in the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve gala concert on December 31, 2006, featuring music from the films; it was televised on &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; by PBS.

She has a close working relationship with composer Michael John LaChiusa who has written several works for her, including the Broadway musical &quot;Marie Christine&quot;, the opera &quot;Send (who are you? i love you)&quot;, and &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins: A Song Cycle&quot;. With her full lyric soprano voice, McDonald appeared as Lizzie in the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s 2007 revival of &quot;110 in the Shade&quot;, directed by Lonny Price at Studio 54, for which she shared the Drama Desk Award for Best Actress in a Musical with Donna Murphy. On April 29, 2007, while she was in previews for the show, her father was killed when an experimental aircraft he was flying crashed north of Sacramento, California.

McDonald is known for defying racial typecasting in her various Tony Award-winning and -nominated roles. Her performances as Carrie Pipperidge in Nicholas Hytner&#x27;s 1994 revival of &quot;Carousel&quot;, Lizzie Curry in Lonny Price&#x27;s 2007 revival of &quot;110 in the Shade&quot;, and Rose in George C. Wolfe&#x27;s revival of &quot;Gypsy&quot; have made her the first Black woman to portray those traditionally white roles in a major Broadway production. Of her groundbreaking work in encouraging diversity in musical theatre casting, she said in an interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I refuse to be stereotyped. If I think I am right for a role I will go for it in whatever way I can. I refuse to say no to myself. I can&#x27;t control what a producer will do or say but I can at least put myself out there.&quot; In a &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; interview on NPR, Asian-American actor Thom Sesma said McDonald&#x27;s performance in &quot;Carousel&quot; &quot;transcended any kind of type at all&quot;, proving her to be &quot;more actress than African-American.&quot;

McDonald has also performed in opera. In 2006 she made her opera debut at the Houston Grand Opera performing Francis Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;La voix humaine&quot; and the world premiere of Michael John LaChiusa&#x27;s one-woman opera &quot;Send (who are you? I love you)&quot;. She had previously performed in the world premiere of John Adams&#x27; &quot;I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky&quot; which was given in concert, and can be heard on the 1997 recording of the opera. In 2007 she performed the role of Jenny Smith in Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; at the Los Angeles Opera. Her performance was recorded and won the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording in 2009. In 2008, McDonald starred as Ruth Younger in the critically acclaimed television film &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;, and was nominated at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, and at the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie.

=== 2011–2019: Career expansion ===
McDonald appeared in a revised version of George Gershwin&#x27;s opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, at the American Repertory Theatre (in Cambridge, Massachusetts) from August through September 2011, and recreated the role on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, which opened on January 12, 2012, and closed on September 23, 2012. For this role, McDonald won her fifth Tony Award and her first in a Leading Actress category. This American Repertory Theater production was &quot;re-imagined by Suzan-Lori Parks and Diedre Murray as a musical for contemporary audiences.&quot;
Since 2012, McDonald has served as host for the PBS series &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot;, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Program with the show&#x27;s producers for &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, airing in 2015. In 2013, McDonald appeared in the HBO documentary &quot;Six by Sondheim,&quot; and she played Mother Abbess in the 2013 NBC live television production of &quot;The Sound of Music Live!&quot;. In 2014, she was featured in Lynn Nottage&#x27;s short play &quot;Poof!&quot;, alongside Tonya Pinkins. It was produced for radio and podcast by Playing On Air. 

McDonald played Billie Holiday on Broadway in the play &quot;Lady Day at Emerson&#x27;s Bar and Grill&quot; in a limited engagement that ended on August 10, 2014. After previews that began on March 25, 2014, the play opened at the Circle in the Square Theatre on April 13, 2014. Of the play, McDonald said in an interview, &quot;It&#x27;s about a woman trying to get through a concert performance, which I know something about, and she&#x27;s doing it at a time when her liver was pickled and she was still doing heroin regularly...I might have been a little judgmental about Billie Holiday early on in my life, but what I&#x27;ve come to admire most about her – and what is fascinating in this show – is that there is never any self-pity. She&#x27;s almost laughing at how horrible her life has been. I don&#x27;t think she sees herself as a victim. And she feels an incredible connection to her music – she can&#x27;t sing a song if she doesn&#x27;t have some emotional connection to it, which I really understand&quot;.

McDonald won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for this role, making her the first person to earn six Tony Award wins for acting (not counting honorary awards) and the first person to win a Tony Award in all four acting categories. In her acceptance speech, &quot;she thanked her parents for encouraging her to pursue her interests as a child.&quot; She also thanked the &quot;strong and brave and courageous&quot; African-American women who came before her, saying in part, &quot;I am standing on Lena Horne&#x27;s shoulders. I am standing on Maya Angelou&#x27;s shoulders. I am standing on Diahann Carroll and Ruby Dee, and most of all, Billie Holiday. You deserved so much more than you were given when you were on this planet. This is for you, Billie.&quot; This performance was filmed at Cafe Brasil in New Orleans and broadcast on HBO on March 12, 2016. McDonald received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for her role in the broadcast. She lost to Sarah Paulson playing Marcia Clark in &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;. She was also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series. 

She appeared at the Williamstown Theatre Festival, Williamstown, Massachusetts, in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot; in August 2015, co-starring with her husband Will Swenson. In 2016, McDonald starred on Broadway as the vaudeville performer Lottie Gee in a new musical titled &quot;Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed&quot; about the making of the 1921 musical &quot;Shuffle Along.&quot; &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; closed on July 24, 2016, and McDonald began a maternity hiatus at that time. 

McDonald had planned to make her West End debut as Holiday in &quot;Lady Day&quot; in June through September 2016, but after becoming pregnant she postponed these plans. She performed in &quot;Lady Day&quot; in June 2017 through September 9, 2017, at the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in the West End. In 2017, McDonald starred in Disney&#x27;s live action remake film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (based on the 1991 animated film of the same name) as Madame de Garderobe, directed by Bill Condon, and co-starring with Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, earning a nomination at the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture. On August 1, 2017, it was announced that she had been added to the main cast for the second season of &quot;The Good Fight&quot;, reprising her role as Liz Lawrence from &quot;The Good Wife&quot; season 4.

== Recordings and concerts ==

McDonald has maintained ties to her classical training and repertoire. She frequently performs in concert throughout the U.S. and has performed with musical organizations such as the New York Philharmonic and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Carnegie Hall commissioned the song cycle &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins: A Song Cycle&quot; for McDonald, and she performed it at Carnegie&#x27;s Zankel Hall on June 2, 2004. She sang two solo one-act operas at the Houston Grand Opera in March 2006: Francis Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;La voix humaine&quot; and the world premiere of Michael John LaChiusa&#x27;s &quot;Send (who are you? I love you)&quot;. On February 10, 2007, McDonald starred with Patti LuPone in the Los Angeles Opera production of Kurt Weill&#x27;s opera &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; directed by John Doyle. The recording of this production of &quot;Mahagonny&quot; won two Grammy Awards, for Best Opera Recording and Best Classical Album in February 2009.

In September 2008, American composer Michael John LaChiusa was quoted in &quot;Opera News Online&quot;, as working on an adaptation of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; with McDonald in mind.

McDonald has recorded five solo albums for Nonesuch Records. Her first, the 1998 &quot;Way Back to Paradise&quot;, featured songs written by a new generation of musical theatre composers who had achieved varying degrees of prominence in the 1990s, particularly LaChiusa, Adam Guettel and Jason Robert Brown.

Her next album, &quot;How Glory Goes&quot; (2000), combined both old and new works, and included composers Harold Arlen, Leonard Bernstein and Jerome Kern. Her third album, &quot;Happy Songs&quot; (2002), was big band music from the 1920s through the 1940s. Her fourth album, &quot;Build a Bridge&quot; (2006), features songs from jazz and pop.

In May 2013, Audra McDonald released her first solo album in seven years, &quot;Go Back Home&quot;, with a title track from the Kander and Ebb musical &quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot;. To coincide with the album&#x27;s release, McDonald performed a concert at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City that aired on the PBS series &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; titled &quot;Audra McDonald In Concert: Go Back Home&quot;.

She reprised the role in some performances of the March 2014 Lincoln Center concert production, again directed by Price, this time opposite Bryn Terfel and Emma Thompson. She performed three concerts, titled &quot;Audra McDonald Sings Broadway&quot;, in the Sydney Opera House in November 2015, which also included &quot;The Facebook Song&quot; by Kate Miller-Heidke. In late December 2023, McDonald was a guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World.

They have one daughter, Zoe Madeline Donovan, named after McDonald&#x27;s close friend and &quot;Master Class&quot; co-star Zoe Caldwell and the late Madeline Kahn. McDonald became close friends with Kahn after they filmed a TV pilot together, and she found out she was carrying a girl the same day she sang at Kahn&#x27;s memorial. McDonald and Donovan divorced in 2009.

She married Will Swenson on October 6, 2012. On October 19, 2016, she gave birth to their daughter, Sally James McDonald-Swenson. She is the stepmother to Swenson&#x27;s two sons from his previous marriage.

Emphasizing four goalsawareness, accountability, advocacy, and actionBTU works at the community and national levels to elevate anti-racist causes and support the Black community through various resources and initiatives.

==Concerts==
Audra McDonald in Concert (2013–14)

23 concerts total; the gap between May and October 2013 is due to McDonald&#x27;s work with television and her album coming out, causing the three and a half month gap. The tour ended due to McDonald&#x27;s show, &quot;Lady Day at Emerson&#x27;s Bar and Grill&quot; opening on Broadway, but she picked up again with a new tour once the show closed.

An Evening with Audra McDonald (2014–15)

37 concerts; this tour marked her Australian debut. The lack of August shows was due to her run in &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot;.

<doc id="1211932" wikidata="Q899201" url="?curid=1211932" title="Stanley Park Stadium">
<text>Stanley Park was a proposed football stadium in Stanley Park, Liverpool. If built, it would have become home to the Liverpool Football Club. It would have replaced their current stadium at Anfield. The stadium had a planned capacity of 60,000 all-seated. It was also potentially expandable to 73,000 or more.

There were two designs that were given planning permission. One was designed by architects AFL with a capacity of 60,000, the second was a more expensive futuristic design by Dallas-based architects HKS, which would originally seat 60,000 with a capacity for further expansion to 73,000.

As of January 2012, only small site preparation work had been completed. A change in owners resulted in the plans for Stanley Park Stadium being reexamined. In October 2012, new owners Fenway Sports Group announced their decision to redevelop and expand the current club stadium Anfield (in a similar way that they redeveloped Fenway Park for the Boston Red Sox) rather than proceed with the planned new stadium.

==Stadium==
The stadium was initially scheduled to open in 2006 with a capacity of approximately 55,000 seats. This was designed by Manchester-based architects AFL. A subsequent redesign of this stadium brought the capacity to 60,000, and planning permission was granted for this in 2003. Construction on this never progressed past the ground works due to a lack of funds.

Under the ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillette, Dallas-based architects HKS were asked to present a plan for a 60,000 seater stadium that could be easily expandable to over 73,000 in the future. They came up with a futuristic design with an 18,500 seater single tier kop. The design was estimated to cost £400m, and the club was granted planning permission for this stadium. Work never started on this as the owners Hicks and Gillette couldn&#x27;t raise the funds.

In January 2008, AFL presented Liverpool FC with another redesign of their 60,000 capacity stadium. This was dubbed &quot;New Generation Anfield&quot; and would seat 73,000 with 18,500 in a single tiered kop, similar to the HKS capacity. The stadium would also include two Wembley-style arches. It would cost £290m to build. Planning permission has not been sought for this project however.

In January 2012, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; reported that the new club owners Fenway Sports Group had decided to ditch the HKS design on the basis of cost and practicality and focus on working with AFL&#x27;s &quot;First Generation Anfield&quot; plans. They would modernise the now decade-old design, and include a single tiered kop. It was thought that at least £150m in sponsorship money would have had to have been raised before construction could begin. The current owners announced the expansion of Liverpool&#x27;s current stadium. Work began on the project in 2015.

==History==
Liverpool F.C. were approached by Liverpool City Council to become a tenant on the flagship King&#x27;s Dock project. The club however rejected the offer because the site would only be suitable for a 50,000 capacity stadium. At the same time, Merseyside rivals Everton F.C. informally inquired about building on North West section of Stanley Park, Liverpool but were deterred when told that a Victorian covenant was in place. Liverpool&#x27;s then CEO, Rick Parry threatened to move Liverpool into a neighbouring borough on Merseyside because the only other site he considered viable was to become a residential estate in Garston. The City Council then offered Everton F.C. the opportunity to become tenants of King&#x27;s Dock. Everton agreed to this as they would only need to raise £30million for a 55,000 capacity stadium and the rest would be paid for with public money by the council.

Sensing an opportunity, former chief executive Rick Parry told Liverpool City Council that Liverpool F.C. wanted to build on the South East area of Stanley Park and that they were considering leaving the city boundaries and taking millions of pounds of income that would usually be paid to the council with them. The City Council reluctantly agreed to Parry&#x27;s demands and Parry told the press that the solution was &quot;under our noses all along&quot;. At the time, Everton chairman, Bill Kenwright chose not to contest the reasoning because they were being given financial support from the public sector. Plans to build on Stanley Park were resisted by local residents and Friends of Stanley Park who did not want to lose parkland for a football stadium.

The stadium designed by AFL was given planning permission in February 2003. Construction was expected to be finished in 2006.

===Hicks &amp; Gillett Era===

In February 2007 the club was bought by American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr. The new owners stated that a new stadium was a priority and that work would begin soon. However the pair failed to secure funding for the stadium, and the AFL plans were replaced by newer and more expensive HKS ones. The HKS stadium was given final planning permission on 19 June 2008 and minor site preparation began on 24 June 2008.

On 15 May, Carlsberg stated their interest in a sponsorship deal of the stadium name, proposing Carlsberg Anfield. No official deal was signed however, and thus no major financial backing was secured.

Former Liverpool Chief Executive Rick Parry announced on 5 October 2008 that although the stadium would still be built, work would be delayed until economic conditions improve.

===Fenway Sports Group Era===

By mid-2010 the club were in serious financial trouble with huge debts. This prompted the takeover of the club by a consortium led by John W Henry in October 2010. The group known as New England Sports Ventures (now Fenway Sports Group) announced that the club wanted to expand stadium capacity, and that they would reexamine all options, including redeveloping Anfield. FSG permanently ditched the more expensive HKS stadium designs in favour of a revised AFL design that would conform with the original planning permission.

In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that the owners of Liverpool FC had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost in the region of £150m.

==Groundshare with Everton FC==
It was reported that, should funding prove sufficiently difficult to acquire, there was a possibility that the stadium would be co-financed by Everton FC, who were also looking into the possibility of a new stadium in Kirkby, although this had been strenuously denied by Liverpool&#x27;s former co-owner Tom Hicks. Due to the government&#x27;s rejection of Everton FC&#x27;s stadium project and financial problems at Everton FC, there had been speculation in the media as to a joint stadium project. Such a project received support from the leader of Liverpool city council and the chief of Liverpool&#x27;s bid to host matches as part of the failed English 2018 World Cup bid. Despite media rumours, Liverpool FC always maintained that a ground sharing situation was never on the agenda. This idea was quashed once Liverpool F.C. completed their new Main Stand, removing the need for a potential new stadium.

==Access==

===Anfield Railway Station===
In February 2008, it was revealed that Liverpool FC were looking to build a new rail station. Three locations have been looked at; Utting Avenue, Stanley Park Avenue and Pinehurst Avenue.

<text>Jacques Soustelle (; 3 February 1912 – 6 August 1990) was an important and early figure of the Free French Forces, a politician who served in the French National Assembly and at one time served as Governor General of Algeria, an anthropologist specializing in Pre-Columbian civilizations, and vice-director of the Musée de l&#x27;Homme in Paris in 1939. Soustelle and his followers opposed any compromise with anticolonial activists in Algeria in the Algerian War.

As Governor-General of Algeria, he helped the rise of Charles de Gaulle to the presidency of the Fifth Republic, but broke with De Gaulle over Algerian independence, joined the OAS in their efforts to overthrow De Gaulle and lived in exile between 1961 and 1968. On returning to France he resumed political and academic activity and was elected to the Académie française in 1983.

== Biography ==
Jacques Soustelle was born in Montpellier, into a Protestant working-class family. A brilliant high school student, he was admitted to the École Normale Supérieure de la rue d&#x27;Ulm. At the age of 20, he was admitted at the first place at the competitive exam of &quot;agrégation de philosophie&quot; (high-level grade for teaching). An anti-fascist, he was general-secretary in 1935 of the French Union of Intellectuals against Fascism.

Soustelle developed an interest in Ethnology while working at the Musée de l&#x27;Homme under Paul Rivet. Rivet sent him to Mexico, after Soustelle became an Agrégé, to study the Otomi people. Soustelle wrote his first major book &quot;Mexique, Terre Indienne&quot; (Mexico is Indian) about his time with the Otomi.

=== &quot;France Libre&quot; ===

After the Armistice of 22 June 1940, he left Mexico to join the Free French Forces (FFL) in London. Charles de Gaulle charged him with a diplomatic mission in Latin America (1941), to set up support committees for Free France, to cut short the diplomatic efforts of Petainists throughout the continent.
He headed the intelligence service &quot;Bureau Central de Renseignements et d&#x27;Action&quot; (BCRA).
He joined the &quot;Comité national français&quot;, (Government of the Free France, fighting Vichy France, and the Axis powers ) in London, then ran the &quot;commissariat national à l’Information&quot; (1942).

Appointed to head the Special Services Branch (DGHS) in Algiers in (1943–1944) by the French Committee of National Liberation), He was Commissioner of the Republic (prefect) in Bordeaux then in the Liberation deputy of Mayenne.

=== Reconstruction of France ===
In 1945, he served first as Minister of Information, then as Minister of the Colonies. From 1947 to 1951, he served as Secretary General of the Gaullist party &quot;Rassemblement du Peuple Français&quot; (RPF) and was one De Gaulle&#x27;s closest counsellors. Soustelle was a strong supporter of Israel. He was a chairman of the Franco-Israel Alliance, which campaigned for a closer military relationship between France and Israel.

=== Algeria ===
He was nominated Governor General of Algeria by Pierre Mendès France in 1955–56, favouring the integration of the Muslim community in the French Departments along the Mediterranean coast. Thanks to Soustelle&#x27;s support during the May 1958 Algiers revolt, De Gaulle returned to power.

Though he believed he would become Algeria Secretary, Soustelle was only named Information Minister in June 1958. In 1959, he was appointed Minister of State in charge of Overseas Departments by De Gaulle. He was unharmed after three &quot;Front de Libération Nationale&quot; (FLN) members attempted to assassinate him by shooting his car on the Place de l&#x27;Étoile in Paris. He asked De Gaulle for a presidential pardon for the only attacker who had been arrested and sentenced to death. Soustelle disagreed with De Gaulle&#x27;s sudden turn for Algerian independence. He analyzed this turnaround in his book &quot;L&#x27;Espérance trahie&quot; (Broken Hope). Soustelle was dismissed from the cabinet and the Gaullist party &quot;Union pour la nouvelle République&quot; (UNR) in 1960 and joined the terrorist &quot;Organisation armée secrète&quot; (OAS) in the fight against the independence of Algeria. When the OAS was replaced by the &quot;Conseil National de la Résistance&quot; (CNR), he joined this new organization with Georges Bidault, former President of the World War II National Council of the Resistance. His activities led his being sued for attempting to undermine the authority of the French state. He lived in exile between 1961 and his 1968 amnesty.

===National Assembly===
Soustelle was elected to France&#x27;s National Assembly (France&#x27;s lower House) three times, first representing Mayenne in 1945–46, then the Rhône (1951–58) as a Gaullist, and from 1973 to 1978 as a member of the centrist Mouvement Réformateur. In 1974, he supported the bill legalizing abortion presented by Simone Veil. 

He died, aged 78, in Neuilly-sur-Seine.

<text>Water police, also called bay constables, coastal police, harbor patrols, marine/maritime police/patrol, nautical patrols, port police, or river police are a specialty law enforcement portion of a larger police organization, who patrol in water craft. Their patrol areas may include coastal tidal waters, rivers, estuaries, harbors, lakes, canals or a combination of these.

== Duties and functions ==
Water police are usually responsible for ensuring the safety of water users, enforcing laws relating to water traffic, preventing crime on vessels, banks and shores, providing search and rescue services (either as the main provider or as an initial response unit before more specialized units arrive), and allowing land-based police to reach locations not easily accessible. They may also be responsible for coastal security, environmental law enforcement, immigration and smuggling interdiction, and diving operations (although many police organizations have separate units to handle this). Their operations may coordinate with other agencies with similar assets such as in the United States the various Federal, State or Local authorities may work together to promote or achieve similar enforcement or rescue outcomes. In the United States, some states have combined the duties of water police with those of conservation officers or state police.
Equipment used ranges from personal water craft and inflatable boats to large seagoing craft, but most police vessels are small to medium, fast motorboats. In some areas these vessels incorporate a firefighting capability through a fixed deck nozzle. The operators of these vessels are generally trained in many rescue disciplines including first aid, vessel dewatering, and firefighting. They may also be trained as divers for rescue and recovery and as boat operators who may engage in towing operations.

<text>A wildcat cartridge, often shortened to wildcat, is a custom-made cartridge for which ammunition and/or firearms are not mass-produced. These cartridges are often created as experimental variants to optimize a certain ballistic performance characteristic (such as the power, size, or efficiency) of an existing commercial cartridge, or may merely be intended as novelty items.

Developing and using wildcat cartridges does not generally serve a purpose in military or law enforcement; it is more a hobby for serious sport shooting, hunting, gunsmithing and handloading enthusiasts, particularly in the United States. There are potentially endless varieties of wildcat cartridge: one source of gunsmithing equipment has a library of over 6,000 different wildcat cartridges for which they produce equipment such as chamber reamers.

==Development of a wildcat==
Often, wildcats are commercially sold rounds that have been modified in some way to alter the cartridge&#x27;s performance. Barrels for the caliber are originally manufactured by gunsmiths specializing in barrel making. Generally, the same makers also offer reloading dies, tools to custom-load bullets into cases. Because changing the barrel of a gun to accommodate custom cartridges requires precision equipment, most wildcats are developed by or in association with custom barrel makers. Ammunition is handloaded, using modified parent cases and the gunsmith-provided wildcat dies. Generally, the supplier of the barrel or dies will also provide the buyer with basic reloading data, giving a variety of powders, charge weights, and bullet weights that can be used for developing loads. Handloaders use the data to develop a load by starting with minimum loads and carefully working up.

Wildcat cases and cartridges can be found for sale, but only from small makers. Larger manufacturers usually do not produce wildcats because there is such a limited market for them and because there are no established CIP (Commission Internationale Permanente Pour L&#x27;Epreuve Des Armes A Feu Portatives - Permanent International Commission for the Proof of Small Arms) or SAAMI standards, which causes liability concerns.

==Wildcat goals and methods==

Wildcat cartridges are developed for many reasons. Generally, the goal is to optimize some characteristics of a commercial cartridge in a given context. Higher velocities, greater energy, better efficiency, greater consistency (which yields greater precision), and complying with a minimal permitted caliber or bullet weight for the legal hunting of certain species of game in a particular jurisdiction are the top reasons. The sport of metallic silhouette shooting, has given rise to a great number of wildcats, as several rifle rounds are adapted to fire from a handgun. In using autopistols for hunting or competitive shooting, improved feeding of softnose or hollowpoint bullets is also an issue; the bottlenecked .45/38, for instance, was created because the straight-cased .45 ACP had trouble feeding hollow points.

Wildcat cartridges are generally developed because:
* Higher velocities can be obtained by increasing the case capacity or reducing the caliber.
* Greater energy can be attained by increasing the caliber or the case capacity.
* Better efficiency can be achieved by increasing the shoulder angle, shortening the case, and reducing the case taper (see internal ballistics).
* Greater consistency can be achieved by tuning the case capacity to a certain bullet diameter, weight, and velocity that give consistent results.
* Feeding problems can be fixed.

Some methods used to develop a wildcat are:
* Cold forming. The parent case is well lubricated and forced carefully into the reloading die for the wildcat caliber. This will swage the case into a new shape. This type of operation is used for reducing case dimensions, such as changing the neck diameter or pushing the shoulder back.
*Fire forming. This consists of taking the parent case, or a partially cold formed case, loading it with a light bullet and light load of powder, and firing it in the firearm it will be used in. Another technique uses a charge of fast-burning powder topped with a case full of Cream of Wheat and a wad, to form a special blank cartridge that will expand the case. This technique is used for increasing case dimensions, such as pushing the neck forward, increasing the neck angle, or straightening the case walls.
* Trimming to length. Generally, after either a cold forming or a fire forming operation, the mouth of the case will be longer than ideal, and the case will be trimmed back to the &quot;trim to&quot; length. Trimming is a normal reloading operation, as high-pressure cartridges will flow each time they are fired, and periodically need trimming to remove the brass that flows to the mouth.
* Changing the diameter of the case (to suit a new caliber). Called &quot;necking up&quot; or &quot;necking down&quot;, this is the most common way of making a wildcat. The new caliber allows a different range of bullet weights, and can greatly increase the velocity or the power or the resistance to wind drift as compared to the parent cartridge.
* Necking back. This is a cold forming operation in which the neck is pushed back to reduce case capacity. This is often done when developing rounds for shorter barrels, such as turning a rifle cartridge into a handgun cartridge.
* Blowing out. This is a fire-forming operation that moves the shoulder forward to increase case capacity.
* Changing the shoulder angle. By making the shoulder closer to square, the resulting space is closer to the ideal spherical shape, resulting in a more efficient burn. If the shoulder is also to be moved back, this is a cold forming operation; if the shoulder is to stay or be moved forward, it is a hot forming operation.
* Reducing the case taper. This hot forming operation makes the cartridge more cylindrical, giving similar results to a shoulder angle change.
* Changing the rim. While this is a wildcatting operation, it is generally only done by commercial operations, due to the precision turning needed. Generally, this is a conversion from rimmed to a rimless cartridge, or from rimless to rebated, and is done to allow a larger parent case than the firearm action was designed for. The opposite operation, adding a rim to a case, is also generally only done by major manufacturers; examples are the .45 Auto Rim, a rimmed .45 ACP allowing ejection in .45 revolvers without the use of moon clips, and the .307 Winchester, a rimmed .308 Winchester, developed for use in lever-action rifles. A handloader can add a rim, by swaging a ring of metal onto a rimless case, then turning it down, but this is a very labor-intensive process and requires a special swaging die and precision metalworking lathe. It is far easier for most handloaders to simply start with a rimmed case, either of the desired diameter or reamed out as desired.
*Increasing the case length. This process (which allows the cartridge to contain more propellant and thus increases the potential energy of the bullet) was used to make the powerful .357 Magnum cartridge from the much weaker .38 Special: A .357 magnum bullet has more than 3 times more energy than a .38 special bullet of the same weight. Increasing the length of a bullet&#x27;s case usually involves getting rid of the old case and making a completely new one from scratch, which all but limits the feasibility of this kind of modification for commercial manufacturers. It is possible to draw an existing case into a slightly longer form, thinning and stretching the existing case, but this is an operation requiring special equipment and expertise. It is far easier and more common to reduce, not extend the length of a case.

==Example wildcat cartridges==

In terms of sheer numbers of varieties, there are more wildcat cartridges than there are production cartridges. Most wildcats are custom made, therefore are not generally well-known. Some wildcat cartridges, however, are produced commercially in small quantities by small manufacturers. This is a list of some representative wildcats.
* .30 Herrett. Based on the .30-30 Winchester, necked back and with a sharper shoulder angle. Developed for use in pistols with barrels as short as 10 inches (25 cm), it develops the same power as a .30-30 with greater efficiency and less muzzle blast.
* .357 Herrett. Like the earlier .30 Herrett, this cartridge is based on the .30-30 Winchester, shortened and necked up to .357 (9 mm). Designed for use in short barrels, the resulting cartridge is more efficient and more powerful than the .30-30. Often considered one of the best medium game hunting calibers available in the 10&quot; (25 cm) barrelled Thompson Center Arms Contender pistol.
* .10 Eichelberger Long Rifle. This is one of a smaller number of wildcats based on rimfire cartridges. It is made by disassembling a .22 Long Rifle cartridge, and re-using the case. The .10 caliber (2.5 mm) is the smallest rifled barrel made. The tiny .10 caliber bullets produce almost no recoil and travel at very high velocities. While it can be used on small game at short ranges, this cartridge is more of a curiosity than practical hunting or target round.
* 5.7 MMJ, or 5.7mm Spitfire. A .30 Carbine case necked down to .223 caliber (5.56 mm), this cartridge was developed to convert military surplus M1 Carbines into short range varmint guns.
*6mm PPC. Based on the .220 Russian, which is in turn based on the 7.62×39mm intermediate-power cartridge. The 6mm PPC was developed in 1975 specifically for benchrest shooting. While it is anything but common anywhere else, the 6mm PPC unseated the .222 Remington from its 20-year spot as the best benchrest cartridge available. Chambered only in single-shot rifles due to its short, fat case and sharp shoulder angle, the 6mm PPC is still going strong in benchrest after 30 years.
* .22 Eargesplitten Loudenboomer. This humorously named cartridge was developed by P. O. Ackley specifically to exceed muzzle velocity. Based on a .378 Weatherby Magnum case, the case is impractically overpowered for the bore diameter, and so the cartridge remains a curiosity.
* 7 mm TCU (also known as 7TCU). Based on the .223 Remington case, the 7 mm TCU is popular in single-shot handguns such as the Thompson Center Arms&#x27; Contender and G2 Contender. It is but one of a family of wildcat TCU cartridges.

===Wildcat cartridges in Australia===
In Australia, wildcat cartridges were relatively common. Most are made primarily for hunting species such as deer, kangaroo, and are generally based on the .303 British because of the post-war popularity of that round and of the cheap surplus Australian Lee–Enfield MkIII military rifles available. Many of these surplus rifles were re-barreled to .257 caliber, known as the 303-25. One of the unique features is that these cartridges relied less on handloading - and instead, factory ammunition was produced by the Super Cartridge Company, Riverbrand, IMI, and Sportco.

Since having an existing barrel rebored and rechambered was (at that time) less expensive than fitting a new barrel, a 303-25 rifle with a worn-out barrel could be economically converted to .277 caliber, known as the 303-270.

The .222 Remington - a .222 Rimmed in a Martini was also commonly found. As too were the &quot;Tini-Mite&quot; and &quot;Mini-Mite&quot; cartridges, .17 caliber rimfire cartridges based on the .22 Long Rifle case.

===Commercially accepted wildcats===
Some cartridges started out as custom-made (non-commercially developed) wildcats and gained wide enough acceptance or popularity to become commercial cartridges. Generally, cartridges become popular commercially after a commercial firearms maker begins offering a weapon chambered in the cartridge. Once popular enough, funding is generated for SAAMI standards development. After SAAMI standards are in place, any firearms or ammunition maker can be sure that any products manufactured to the SAAMI standards can be safely used.

Some examples of custom cartridges that became commercially accepted are:
*.22-250. Based on a .250 Savage case, the .22-250 is still one of the fastest shooting .22 caliber (5.56 mm) cartridges available. First offered in a factory firearm by Browning in 1963 (the first factory gun chambered for a wildcat), the .22-250 was later adopted by Remington as the .22-250 Remington.
*.22 CHeetah. A .308 BR (Bench Rest) case necked down to .22 caliber, the .22 CHeetah provides a flat trajectory with a .22 caliber bullet that has a relatively high speed of 4,000 ft/s. Hard on barrels, it provides a very effective 300-yard varmint round.
*.303/25. A .303 British cartridge necked down to fire a .25 caliber projectile, developed in Australia during the 1940s as a Kangaroo culling and pest control round. Popularised in the late 1940s and 1950s in New South Wales, owing to restrictions in that state on ownership of .303 British caliber firearm and the difficulties of obtaining commercial hunting arms and ammunition from overseas. Now largely obsolete, but there are still large numbers of converted Lee–Enfield rifles chambered for this round in Australia.
*6.8 mm SPC. This cartridge was developed by American military special operations soldiers in search of a more lethal round than the 5.56×45mm NATO. It is based on the .30 Remington cartridge necked down to .270 caliber, and sized to fit in the M16 rifle.
*7 mm-08. A .308 Winchester necked down to 7 mm (.284 caliber), the 7 mm-08 provides a flatter trajectory with lighter, more aerodynamic 7 mm bullets.
*7-30 Waters. Designed to improve the performance of lever-action rifle designs dating back to the 1890s, the 7-30 Waters is a .30-30 Winchester necked down to 7 mm (.284 caliber). Even with the lower chamber pressures allowed by the lever-action rifle and the flat-tipped bullets necessitated by the tubular magazines, the 7-30 Waters offers a significant gain in velocity and sectional density with little loss in bullet weight. This cartridge has also developed a following among handgun hunters using single-shots such as the T/C Contender or G2, which can take advantage of spitzer (pointed) bullets that are unsafe in tubular magazines. It is very efficient on small to medium-sized game including whitetails and mule deer.
*.454 Casull. This magnum revolver cartridge, a lengthened .45 Colt, was developed by Dick Casull and Jack Fulmer in 1957 as a high-powered big game hunting round. For many years, the small Wyoming manufacturer Freedom Arms was the only substantial maker of guns for the cartridge. In the mid-1990s, two major manufacturers, Ruger and Taurus, started selling guns chambered in .454 Casull because it was popular due to its extreme power. It was finally commercialized in 1997 when SAAMI published its first standards for the cartridge.

===Commercially developed wildcats===
Though a cartridge technically has to not be developed commercially to be considered a wildcat, some commercial cartridges were developed by ammunition and firearm manufacturers by modifying existing cartridges – using essentially the same process used to make wildcats. Cartridges that are modified by being made longer (usually to make them more powerful) are for the most part only created commercially because of the difficulty of the process. One example of such a cartridge is the .357 Magnum, which was developed from the .38 Special in 1934 by firearms manufacturer Smith &amp; Wesson.

* .38-40. One of the oldest wildcats, the .38-40, introduced by Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1874, was made by necking down a .44-40. Actually a .401 in (10.2 mm) cartridge, the .38-40 had faded into obsolescence before being revived with the growing popularity of Cowboy action shooting. The ballistics of the .38-40 are close to those of the .40 S&amp;W.
* .221 Fireball. This cartridge was developed by Remington Arms for the XP-100 pistol, which was a single shot bolt action pistol. The .221 Fireball was a necked back .222 Remington, designed for greater efficiency in the 10 in (25 cm) barrel of the XP-100. Even loaded with a smaller load of faster powder for the short barrel, the .221 Fireball lived up to its name, with a massive muzzle flash; the performance, however, was unheard of for its day: over 2700 feet per second (885 m/s) out of the short XP-100 barrel. It remains the fastest SAAMI-approved handgun cartridge, and the cartridge is so efficient and accurate that it has been chambered in rifles as well.
* .22 Remington Jet. This cartridge was developed by Remington for a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 53 revolver and a Marlin Model 62 lever-action rifle, but the rifle was never produced in this caliber. The .22 Remington Jet was a necked-down .357 Magnum case. The .22 Jet is no longer manufactured by Remington or other commercial manufacturers.
* .357 SIG. This now-popular pistol cartridge was developed by Swiss weapons company SIG Sauer in an attempt to produce ballistics matching the powerful .357 Magnum revolver load, but in a semi-automatic pistol cartridge. The cartridge was made by necking down and slightly stretching the .40 S&amp;W case, which itself derived from the 10mm Auto.
* .400 Corbon. This cartridge was designed to produce 10mm Auto ballistics in a cartridge that could be chambered in a .45 ACP pistol with a simple barrel swap. It was made by necking a .45 ACP down to .40 (10 mm). Initially, no firearms were available in .400 Cor-Bon, but barrels in the new caliber were produced for the M1911 pistol.
* .41 Action Express. Developed in 1986 by Action Arms for the Jericho 941 pistol. It, like the .357 SIG, attempted to make a magnum-power cartridge for a semi-automatic pistol. It started with a .41 Magnum case and cut it down to fit in a semi-automatic pistol chambered for 9×19mm. The rim was then turned down to the same dimensions as the 9×19mm, making it a rebated rim cartridge. This allowed a unique switch up to a larger caliber. The .41 AE never saw huge commercial success because of the creation of the similarly powerful .40 S&amp;W in 1990.
* .204 Ruger. Introduced in 2004 by Ruger, in its time it held the title of fastest production cartridge with a velocity of 4225 ft/s (1290 m/s) with a , .204 bullet from a barrel. Intended as a varmint rifle cartridge, the .204 was based on the .222 Remington Magnum, which is slightly longer than the .223 Remington and offers about 5% more case capacity. Designed to have a very long point blank range, the factory loading offers impressive ballistics, placing a 32gr Hornady V-Max bullet 1.96 inches high at , and low at .

===Second (and later) generation wildcats===
Some wildcats are based not on commercial rounds, but on other successful wildcats. The .308 × 1.5&quot; Barnes, a wildcat from noted cartridge author Frank Barnes made by simply necking a .308 Winchester back to in length (38.1 mm) is probably the best example of a wildcat that has spawned many other successful wildcats. The .308 x 1.5&quot; case is available from a number of case manufacturers and differs from a homemade .308 x 1.5&quot; in that it has a small primer pocket, whereas the original .308 Winchester case has a larger primer pocket (the smaller primer is more suited to the smaller case capacity of the short round). There are at least 8 wildcats that are made from the small primer .308 x 1.5&quot; brass, including some very successful benchrest rounds, including the Benchrest Remington family of cartridges, .22 BR, 6mm BR, 6.5mm BR, 7mm BR, .30 BR.

Another example is the .220 Russian, based on the 7.62×39mm. Since nearly all 7.62×39mm ammunition made in the 1970s used the complex-to-reload Berdan priming, and often steel cases, it made a poor choice for wildcatting. The .220 Russian, however, was and still is readily available in Boxer-primed, brass cases of high quality. The .220 Russian is still the parent cartridge of choice for the PPC line of cartridges, such as the .22 PPC and 6mm PPC, even though there are far more PPC-chambered firearms available than .220 Russian chamberings. Likewise, the PPC line of cartridges were the parent case of the 6.5 Grendel, a long-range, high-energy cartridge for the AR-15.

<text>Aécio Neves da Cunha (; born 10 March 1960) is a Brazilian economist, politician and former president of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB). He was the 17th Governor of Minas Gerais from 1 January 2003 to 31 March 2010, and is currently a member of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. He lost in the runoff presidential election against Dilma Rousseff in 2014.

== Biography ==
Born in Belo Horizonte in the state of Minas Gerais, Neves was the youngest governor in the state&#x27;s history. He began his political career as a personal secretary of his grandfather, Tancredo Neves, who was elected President of Brazil in 1985, but died before taking office. Aécio Neves served the World Federation of Democratic Youth in 1985 and four terms as an elected deputy for the Brazilian Social Democracy Party in the Federal Chamber of Deputies from 1 February 1987 to 14 December 2002, representing Minas Gerais. He was also President of the Chamber of Deputies in 2001/02.

As governor, Aécio Neves introduced the &quot;Management Shock&quot;, a set of sweeping reforms designed to bring the state budget under control by reducing government expenditure and promoting investment. Having been tipped as a potential candidate for the Brazilian Presidential elections in 2010, Neves announced his intention to stand aside from the race at the end of 2009. He ran for the Brazilian Federal Senate instead, and was elected a Senator representing the State of Minas Gerais. He took office as a Senator of the Republic on 1 February 2011.

Aécio was a columnist at Brazilian newspaper &quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot; until June 2014. On 5 October 2014, he received the second largest number of votes (at 34%) in the Brazilian presidential election, placing him in the runoff election to be held on 26 October 2014, against the first place candidate and former Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, who received 42% of the votes.

===Early years===


Aécio Neves is son of politician Aécio Ferreira da Cunha and Inês Maria. Neves hails from a family of traditional politicians in Minas Gerais. His maternal grandfather, Tancredo Neves, was a key figure in the re-democratization of Brazil, served as governor of Minas Gerais and elected via electoral college. Neves’ paternal grandfather, Tristão Ferreira da Cunha, and his father Aécio Cunha were congressmen representing the state of Minas Gerais. His paternal grandfather, Tristão Ferreira da Cunha, a native of Teófilo Otoni, a northern city in Minas Gerais, was also a politician as well as a lawyer and a professor. He was Secretary of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce in the state government of Juscelino Kubitschek (1951–1955). Aécio Cunha, son of Tristão and father of Aécio, was state deputy between 1955 and 1963 and federal representative between 1963 and 1987.

Neves moved to Rio de Janeiro with his parents when his was 10 years old. He had his first job at the Administrative Council for Economic Defense of the Ministry of Justice in Rio de Janeiro. In 1981 his maternal grandfather convinced Neves to return to Belo Horizonte. He moved into an apartment that he shared with his maternal grandfather and father and transferred to Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, where he studied economics.

In 1982 Aécio began working in his grandfather&#x27;s campaign for the state government, attending meetings and rallies in more than 300 towns. Tancredo Neves was elected governor of Minas Gerais, and in 1983, Aécio served as his private secretary. In the following years, Aécio participated in the movement &quot;Diretas Já&quot; and in Tancredo Neves’ presidential campaign. Tancredo Neves won the Brazilian presidency via electoral college in 1985. After the elections Aécio Neves accompanied the president-elect on visits to democratic countries, a political strategy used to enhance the retransition to democracy in Brazil. They visited the United States and US President Ronald Reagan, France with President François Mitterrand, Italy and Sandro Pertini, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, King Juan Carlos of Spain and Pope John Paul II. Aécio Neves was appointed Secretary of Special Affairs of the Presidency by President-elect Tancredo Neves, but due to his early death, and José Sarney assuming office the job was cancelled.

=== Congressman ===

In 1986 he ran for the National Constituent Assembly as a member of Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). He received 236,019 votes, which at the time was the largest vote for a congressman elected from Minas Gerais. In the Constituent Assembly he became vice the chairman of the Sovereignty and Rights and Guarantees of Men and Women and was also one of the authors of the amendment that turned Brazil&#x27;s voting age to 16 years.

In his second term (1991-1995) he voted for the impeachment of President Fernando Collor de Mello. In 1992 Aécio ran for mayor of Belo Horizonte, but was defeated. It was his only electoral defeat until his unsuccessful bid for the Presidency in 2014. Neves was reelected to Congress for a third term in 1994. The term lasted from 1995 to 1998, during which he was elected president of PSDB Minas Gerais. In 1997, he became PSDB&#x27;s leader in Congress.

=== President of the Chamber of Deputies ===

In 2001 Neves was elected president of the Chamber of Deputies. He had run against Aloízio Mercadante (PT-SP), Inocêncio Oliveira (PFL-PE), Valdemar Costa Neto (PL-SP) and Nelson Marquezelli (PTB-SP) and received more votes than all his competitors combined. He serves as president of Congress from 14 February 2001 until 17 December 2002. As president of Congress he assumed, temporarily, the presidency of Brazil starting on 26 June 2001.

Under his leadership he promoted the so-called Ethical Package, a set of measures aimed at moralizing parliamentary action. Neves led the vote of the end of congressional immunity for common crimes, the establishment of a code of ethics and propriety and the Ethics Committee. He also provided the processing and votes of bills on the Internet so that the public could monitor the processing of the legislative process. He also cut congressional spending and sent saved money back to the federal government.

===Senator===
Neves, along with former President Itamar Franco, was elected senator on 3 October 2010 with 7,565,377 votes. Neves is a member of the Senate committees on political reform, constitutional affairs, justice and citizenship. He participated in the Economic Affairs Committee. As a parliamentarian Neves has advocated the development of a new federal pact, the strengthening of parliamentary action with the restriction on the use of provisional measures, the reduction of taxes and the change in the calculation used for payment of mining royalties.

On 18 May 2017, Neves was suspended from the position of Senator by Minister of the Supreme Court Edson Fachin, at the request of the Attorney General&#x27;s office that also requested his arrest after the information that he requested R$2 million from the owners of meat processing company JBS. On 30 June 2017, Justice Marco Aurélio Mello authorized the return of Aécio to the Senate. On 26 September 2017, Judges Luís Roberto Barroso, Rosa Weber, and Luiz Fux suspended the Senator again. Vice-president of the Federal Senate, Senator Cássio Cunha Lima stated that he &quot;believe[s] that the Senate will take down the decision of the Supreme Court&quot;, justifying that the decision of the Court turned the suspension of Aécio into a house arrest, which needs authorization of the Senate.

On 17 October 2017, Federal Senate voted 44 to 26 for the return of Senator Neves to his seat.

On 17 April 2018, the Supreme Court accepted a judicial complaint to investigate Neves for corruption and obstruction of justice after he was recorded requesting R$2 million from JBS and after his family members got the money.

==Main achievements==

=== Governor ===

On 6 October 2002 Neves was elected governor of Minas Gerais. On 28 March 2006, Aécio announced his candidacy and soon after was reelected, Neves became the second longest-serving governor in state history. The Government of Minas Gerais expropriated a piece of land owned by Neves&#x27;s great-uncle, estimated at R$1 million. His great-uncle requested R$20 million for the indemnification. The State appealed the value in the Justice and the indemnification was annulled.

As governor he hired 98,000 public employees without any public selection and with allegedly illegal procedures. During his administration, the salaries of school teachers in Minas Gerais reached the lowest level of the whole country. The basic salary of medical doctors was R$1,050, the second lowest of the country.

Neves attempted to censor Google, Yahoo!, and Bing search results related to rumors about drug abuse and misappropriation of public health funds.

=== Social development ===

Among the social programs implemented by Aécio are the Project to Combat Rural Poverty (PCRP), developed with total funding of US$70 million, divided into two payments of US$35 million, from the World Bank. The project covers 188 municipalities in Northern Minas Gerais and some districts. The communities are responsible for organizing and defining its priorities. The projects range from the construction of kindergartens to the establishment of handicraft associations or fish farms.

Neves launched the Youth Savings Program in March 2007 with the goal to support 50,000 high school students from the state system who live in areas of high social risk by 2010. Every student received a sum of R$3,000 at the end of the third year of high school, which can be used in their professional career. To receive the money, the high school graduates must take a series of commitments on school performance, such as attendance, good grades, and personal behavior. They cannot, for example, engage in criminal activity and should perform community service. Over 30,000 students have participated in the program and have received English classes, computer skills and professional training.

=== Transportation ===

The Neves government created the Paving Program Links and Access Road program in 2004 with own resources and funding from the Interamerican Development Bank. The program included the paving of accesses to 225 municipalities that had previously been connected only by dirt roads.

=== Administrative City Tancredo Neves ===
Administrative City Tancredo Neves, built to be the new headquarters of State Government, was inaugurated by Neves on 4 March 2010, on what would have been Tancredo Neves’ 100th birthday. The set of five buildings was designed by Oscar Niemeyer and is located on the grounds of the former Hipódromo Serra Verde on the border of the municipalities of Belo Horizonte, Vespasiano and Santa Luzia.

=== Management Shock ===
One of the main points of Aécio&#x27;s government is the so-called &quot;Management Shock&quot;, a set of measures to make the government spend less on itself and invest more in people. In the long term, Management Shock seeks to reduce corruption and to improve the quality and productivity of state government bodies. The program also provides investment in the training of civil servants of the state.

In 2003, Neves created &quot;Stay Alive&quot;, a program to reduce homicides in the state. Per year, 13,000 high-risk students and young adults from areas with the highest homicides throughout the state participate in the program. In the areas the program covers, homicide rates have dropped more than 50%. The program focuses on workshops on sport, culture, productive inclusion and communication to divert young people from crime.

On 21 January 2009, the state government inaugurated the &quot;Reference Center for Pregnant Women in Jail&quot;, built in Vespasiano - MG. This is the first prison in the country to house pregnant inmates and their babies until they complete one year. Aécio launched the first prison in the country built and administered through a public-private partnership.

==Candidacy for Presidency in 2014==

In December 2012, former Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso appointed Aécio Neves as candidate of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party for the 2014 presidential elections. In the October 2014 election, Neves received the second greatest number of votes in the first round, defeating former Environment Minister Marina Silva. He narrowly lost in the second round, a run-off against incumbent Dilma Rousseff on 26 October 2014, 48.4% to Rousseff&#x27;s 51.6%.

==Controversies==
===Operation Car Wash===
Neves was investigated in several corruption cases related to the &quot;Car Wash&quot; probe into kickbacks to politicians. 
Aécio Neves was quoted by four whistleblowers during investigations into Operation Car Wash. Alberto Youssef said he heard the former deputy José Janene tell Aécio&#x27;s sister that he would give him the collection of funds from Furnas, a mixed economy company linked to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The collection and distribution of bribes would have occurred between 1996 and 2000, during the government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. On 25 August 2015, the CPI of Petrobras, Youssef reiterated that Aécio received money diverted from Furnas. A Supreme Court Judge, by the end of 2015, closed the case for insufficient information.

In July 2015, another witness, Carlos Alexandre de Souza Rocha, also known as Ceará, said he took to a director of UTC in Rio de Janeiro and the money would go to the senator. The director said that Aecio was &quot;the most annoying&quot; of his bribe collectord. In February 2016, the same Supreme Court Judge closed the case, again for insufficient information. However, due to lack of evidence, the prosecution decided not to proceed with the accusations.

On 3 February 2016, Fernando Moura, in a statement, said he heard reports of an alleged kickback from Furnas to Aécio Neves. Per Moura, who made a whistle-blowing agreement with the police, Dimas Toledo&#x27;s appointment to the position of director of Furnas was made by Aécio in 2002. Moura was appointed by the &quot;Speedy Wash&quot; as a lobbyist. Dimas Toledo told him that &quot;in Furnas was the same&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;ll be a third [of the bribery] to the government of São Paulo, one third of the national government and a third Aécio&quot;.

In March 2016, under a whistle-blowing agreement, Senator Delcídio Amaral made reference to supposed illegal activities of Aécio in the investigation conducted by the Legislature Branch (CPI) of Congress. Delcídio has information on deals made between him and Aécio during investigation of the Brazilian post office in 2006. In June 2016, the Supreme Federal Court authorised investigations related to alleged kickbacks from Furnas to proceed against Aécio Neves.

===JBS case===
In 2017 Aécio appeared again in other whistle-blowing agreements. Executives said JBS had paid Neves 80 million reais in illegal funding for that campaign as well as 2 million more recently to support a new &quot;abuse of authority&quot; law that seeks to make it easier for suspects and defendants to sue investigators, prosecutors and judges. Neves was recorded soliciting the 2 million reais ($638,000) from Joesley Batista, chairman of meatpacking company JBS SA. Batista told the authorities that Neves implied that the money would be used to pay for his defence in the Lava Jato (Carwash) investigations but the money never went to his lawyers. Instead, part of the money, received by the senator&#x27;s cousin, ended up in a company owned by Zezé Perrella a cousin of Aécio who was also implicated in the biggest drug traffic scandal in Brazilian History.

In 2018, five justices of the Supreme Court unanimously decided to put Neves on trial for allegedly receiving from JBS 2 million reais ($590,000) in kickbacks.

===Expired wallet and refused to take the breathalyzer test===

In 2011, Neves was stopped by the police for having an expired driver&#x27;s license and refused to take a breathalyzer test.
===Drug addiction===
Whenever he is asked, Neves replies that he &quot;never used cocaine&quot;. His denial; however, is universally disputed in Brasil. For example, in 2008, fans shouted in the game Brazil against Argentina in the Mineirão stadium packed, comparing Neves to Diego Maradona, whose career was marked by dependence on cocaine: &quot;Hey Maradona go f... yourself, Aécio Neves sniffs more than you do!&quot;

Neves, for several years, tried to disassociate his persona from the rumor of drug use and overcome a past reputation as a party-loving playboy with a penchant for luxury. Neves proposed a review of relations with supposed &quot;narco state&quot; Bolivia, as well as tighter control of the Brazil-Bolivia border. In 2009, requested by one of the most important political member of his party, Mr. Serra, an article was published on page 3 of the newspaper, O Estado de S. Paulo. The title of the article was: &quot;“Pó, pará, governador?”&quot; () a play on words that was understood by many in the world of politics and among journalists as a clear allusion to the alleged use of the drug by the Senator.

During the 2014 campaign for president, had to face several news and situations opposing the remake &quot;Drug-free-image&quot;; for example, one of his key ally had 450 kilos of cocaine in his helicopter landing and arrested close to Neves&#x27; private family airport. The pilot was an employee of the house of deputies in the State of Minas Gerais, as a personal assistant to Gustavo Perrella, Neves&#x27; cousin. Despite the helicopter being the property of a private company, Perrella used his petrol allowances to fill the tanks of it. Despite it being the second biggest seizure of drugs in 2013, the mainstream media didn’t show much interest in the story. Independent journalists in Brazil covered the incident on their newspapers and TV channels. Mr. Perrella was again involved in crime in 2017, when Joesely Batista said to have recorded senator Aecio Neves requesting two million reais in bribes. According to Globo, federal police filmed the payment to the senator’s cousin. The money was then tracked to a bank account of a company that belongs to the Senator Zeze Perrella who&#x27;s also related to the biggest drug traffic apprehension of Brazilian history.

Neves drug-image situation worsened when Lindsay Lohan got involved in Brazilian politics. She tweeted to 8.5 million followers: &quot;&#x27;Brasil needs change and I support Aecio Neves!&quot;, which has since been deleted, as has the Facebook post. Due to her addiction problems, Lohan supporting her candidate was not that great of a marketing move to help Neves image.

In March 2016, the senator&#x27;s drug-use-fame was revived when the body of Lucas Arcanjo was found dead à lá Herzog. Mr. Arcanjo was famously known by accusations of various crimes against the Senator, crimes such as drug trafficking, purchase of habeas corpus and murder.

==Personal life==
Neves was born into a political family in the city of Belo Horizonte, capital of southeast Minas Gerais state, in 1960.

Neves married model Letícia Weber, from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in 2013. They had twins, Bernardo and Julia, in September 2014. He has another daughter, Gabriela Falcão Neves, born in 1991 from his first marriage (1991-1998) with lawyer Andrea Falcão.

Andrea Neves, Aecio&#x27;s sister, was arrested by the Federal Police in Brumadinho, in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte. Andrea Neves was arrested on suspicion that she had asked for money from businessman, Joesley Batista, on behalf of her brother. Frederico Pacheco de Medeiros, cousin of Senator Aécio Neves, was also arrested in Nova Lima, being that he was responsible for receiving the requested money from Joesley Batista.

<text>Multi Theft Auto (MTA) is a multiplayer modification for the Microsoft Windows version of Rockstar North games &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; that adds online multiplayer functionality. For &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, the mod also serves as a derivative engine to Rockstar&#x27;s interpretation of RenderWare.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The release of &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, a critically acclaimed sandbox-style action-adventure computer and video game developed by DMA Design (now Rockstar North) represented the first 3D title in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; (&quot;GTA&quot;) series. Despite its success, it was the first &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; game to ship without the network multiplayer gameplay features that were present in earlier titles, which allowed players to connect through a computer network and play the game with others.

The first version of &quot;Multi Theft Auto&quot;, dubbed &quot;Grand Theft Auto III: Alternative Multiplayer&quot;, attempted to fill in this gap by extending an already existing cheating tool with functionality that allowed the game to be played with a very crude form of two-player racing over a computer network purely as a proof of concept, similar to how the now-defunct XBAND service worked by manipulating game memory in order to add online multiplayer functionality. Newer versions of &quot;Multi Theft Auto&quot; with increasingly better gameplay and other improvements were released based on the same concept of game manipulation, by a small team of developers.

With the introduction of successor &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, it became clear that this computer game title also lacked any form of network gameplay. The &quot;Multi Theft Auto&quot; software was subsequently extended to include support for this title, and eventually shifted its entire focus towards this title and the concept of a new software framework dubbed &quot;Blue&quot;. As the original concept (of game manipulation by memory) was prone to various problems with performance and stability that often resulted in application crashes, this new framework was created as a successor and laid the foundation of all future &quot;Multi Theft Auto&quot; software.

=== Development ===

The latest &quot;Multi Theft Auto&quot; version is based on code injection and hooking techniques whereby the game is manipulated without altering any original files supplied with the game. The software functions as a game engine that installs itself as an extension of the original game, adding core functionality such as networking and GUI rendering while exposing the original game&#x27;s engine functionality through a scripting language.

The Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas project was revised and relaunched as an open-source project, leaving all prior versions behind. The source code was licensed under the GPLv3 license and made available on GitHub.

== &quot;Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; ==
Multi Theft Auto&#x27;s latest release is for the game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; and is built upon a now open source game engine that has been in development for several years and is the only project that is still actively maintained. The engine provides users with all the necessary tools they need to create their own game modes and maps by exposing a large part of the original game functionality through a Lua scripting machine.

The initial version of the software was dubbed &quot;Race&quot; and unveiled on Sunday 22 January 2006, when the first playable content was released. This version featured a networked vehicle racing game mode and a map editor that allowed users to create custom environments and races. The advanced nature of the engine&#x27;s early incarnation allowed the developers to develop a sophisticated integrated WYSIWYG editor for adding gameplay elements such as checkpoints, spawn points, power-ups and various objects ranging from ramps to exploding barrels.

The successor release, dubbed &quot;Deathmatch&quot;, was designed to improve upon &quot;Race&quot; by providing minimal sandbox style gameplay that could be extended by users and developers. The production on this release started shortly after the initial release, but stagnated due to what is seen as a lack of focus by the development team. As many new features were being introduced, the continuous introduction of these features delayed a stable and final version of the modification. Instead, several on-line facilities were introduced during the development phase to allow visitors to track the development process of the software as changes were made to the code repository, illustrating any notable updates to the progress of the modification.

The first &quot;Deathmatch&quot; successor was introduced as a fully playable version on 2 January 2008 and tagged as &quot;Developer Preview&quot; to promote the third-party development of custom gameplay content and utilities. This version was followed by a second &quot;Developer Preview&quot; that introduced several new features and fixes and was subsequently followed by a period of major code restructuring that led to the open-source relaunch on Friday, 21 November 2008 under the GPLv3 License.

On Saturday, 22 August, &quot;Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas v1.0&quot; was officially distributed as the first open source release. This release abandoned the now obsolete &quot;Deathmatch&quot; tag in the product name to emphasize on the versatility of the software. Gameplay functionality is solely provided by the scripting language, so users can choose or develop their own combination of scripts and other contents to customize and host their own type of game.

=== Content delivery and development ===

The initial &quot;Deathmatch&quot; version and its underlying engine presented a series of relevant changes to the functionality of the modification as well as the introduction of an online community content delivery system. Through the use of this website, registered users (such as players, server administrators or developers) can accumulate in-game statistics whilst playing on servers or share custom created content with other users.

Third party content is made possible through the addition of the Lua scripting language in both the server hosting the game (e.g. providing functionality for a specific game mode), as well as the client playing the game (e.g. providing a graphical front end or user-specific local content to the game mode). Different scripts can then be run in parallel on either of these, communicating to each other through the use of events.

The custom created content is grouped into &quot;resources&quot; that are hosted server-side. This is a package-based system that packs all script files, custom content (e.g. images, 3D models, textures and collision files) and metadata files inside a single archive or directory. Specific content can then be marked to be uploaded to every connected player, to enable client-side execution of Lua code. This system allows for package dependency and inheritance of functions between different packages, easy management and distribution.

=== Feature summary ===

* Multi Theft Auto uses a modular platform to separate several facilities such as the GUI, network, game and scripting code and loads these into the game instead of injecting code into its memory process. This improves stability, speed and allows a better file management.
* Uses the freeware CEGUI system, replacing the original Grand Theft Auto GUI, allowing Multi Theft Auto to draw its own widgets for any in-game user interaction such as the server-browser and allows scripting from any third-party resource.
* A versatile set of scripting functions. By building upon Grand Theft Auto&#x27;s own class-based design, implementing this into the client and server and synchronizing between these two, a third-party developer can control almost any aspect of every player&#x27;s game by means of the Lua scripting language: native elements such as animations, explosions, particles, skins, weapons, vehicles, objects and players, as well as new elements such as custom 3D models are controllable.

== Gameplay ==
Deathmatch, roleplay and race gameplay options are available. Some gameplay elements include checkpoints, spawn points, power-ups, weapons and various objects ranging from ramps to exploding barrels. Many online servers contain custom game modes which use the scripting engine supplied with &quot;Multi Theft Auto&quot;. As example a few game modes in MTA:SA like Freeroam, where players can roam free in San Andreas all across the map, or competitive game-modes like Race, Destruction/Demolition Derby, Team Deathmatch, and Fallout, where players spawn their characters in the air, on a platform of glass plates, which will suddenly fall down after indicating it, where the players have to jump from a falling piece to an intact one, and the last surviving player wins. The principle of Fallout is similar to Hay, where players have to climb and be on top of a haystack first. The last modes also indicates how many game modes and scripts are possible to create on the MTA scripting engine, with endless possibilities and variation.

There are many genres of specific game servers and communities, like real-life role-playing, classic RPGs, and gaming communities that serve a wide variation of different gamemodes, sometimes all together in one server.
Today the average amount of game servers the San Andreas version of &quot;Multi Theft Auto&quot; (MTA:SA) contains, is 3000 to 4000 servers, with over 600,000 players monthly, spread over the servers. The most popular game servers have a constant average of 200 to 1000 online players in-game.

== Reception ==
The &quot;Multi Theft Auto&quot; project has also been the subject in multiple articles in different media. The most prominent being a coverage on G4 TV, an exclusive release for Fileplanet with coverage on its frontpage, and features in published magazines such as PC Gamer and Total PC Gaming.

<text>Company Sergeant Major Edward Brooks VC (11 April 1883 – 26 June 1944) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Edward Brooks was born in Oakley, Buckinghamshire, on 11 April 1883 and baptised in Oakley Church on 20 January 1884. He was one of twelve children of Thomas (born in Oakley in 1855) and Selina Brooks (born in Halesowen, Worcestershire in 1857).

He was 34 years old, and a Company Sergeant Major in the 2/4th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 April 1917 at Fayet, near Saint-Quentin, France, Company Sergeant-Major Brooks, while taking part in a raid on the enemy&#x27;s trenches, saw that the front wave was being checked by an enemy machine gun. On his own initiative he rushed forward from the second wave, killed one of the gunners with his revolver and bayoneted another. The remainder of the gun crew then made off, leaving the gun, whereupon the company sergeant-major turned it on the retreating enemy, after which he carried it back to Allied lines. His courageous action undoubtedly prevented many casualties and greatly added to the success of the operation.

Brooks received his Victoria Cross from the King on 18 July 1917, and on his return to Oxford was met at the railway station by the Mayor and Corporation and driven in a carriage preceded by the Headington Silver Band to Headington. After a presentation at Headington Manor House he returned to his home at 16 Windsor Street.

An Oxfordshire blue plaque was unveiled on his Headington home on 29 July 2017. He is also named prominently on the front panel of the plinth unveiled at the new student accommodation in James Wolfe Road, Oxford on 16 August 2019 at the site of Cowley Barracks.

==Medal==
His VC is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum, Winchester, England.

<doc id="1211968" wikidata="Q1058899" url="?curid=1211968" title="Prospect Park Zoo">
<text>The Prospect Park Zoo is a zoo located off Flatbush Avenue on the eastern side of Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York City. , the zoo houses 864 animals representing about 176 species, and , it averaged 300,000 visitors annually. The Prospect Park Zoo is operated by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). In conjunction with the Prospect Park Zoo&#x27;s operations, the WCS offers children&#x27;s educational programs, is engaged in restoration of endangered species populations, runs a wildlife theater, and reaches out to the local community through volunteer programs.

Its precursor, the Menagerie, opened in 1890. The present facility first opened as a city zoo on July 3, 1935, and was part of a larger revitalization program of city parks, playgrounds and zoos initiated in 1934 by Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. It was built, in large part, through Civil Works Administration and Works Progress Administration (WPA) labor and funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;prospectpark/zoo/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After 53 years of operation as a city zoo run by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Prospect Park Zoo, also colloquially known as &quot;Brooklyn Zoo&quot;, closed in June 1988 for reconstruction. The closure signaled the start of a five-year, $37 million renovation program that, save for the exteriors of the 1930s-era buildings, completely replaced the zoo. It was rededicated on October 5, 1993, as the Prospect Park Wildlife Conservation Center, as part of a system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the WCS, all of which are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

== Features ==

The Prospect Park Zoo is part of the Wildlife Conservation Society, an integrated network of four zoos and an aquarium spread throughout New York City. Located at 450 Flatbush Avenue, across from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the zoo is situated on a plot somewhat lower than street level in Prospect Park. Visitors may enter through the Flatbush Avenue entrance or from within Prospect Park, near Leffert&#x27;s Homestead and the Carousel.

In 2007, 234,000 people visited the Prospect Park Zoo, about the same as the 2006 level of 235,000. , Prospect Park Zoo had 864 animals representing 176 species.

===Exhibits===
The zoo presents three themed exhibition venues, each housed in a dedicated building.

====World of Animals====
The World of Animals in the southern quadrant of the zoo, features the Discovery Trail. The trail begins in the World of Animals building, but visitors quickly pass to an outdoor path that winds through the southern third of the zoo. Animals from diverse corners of the globe are shown in settings not unlike their natural habitats. Visitors may find along the trail black-tailed prairie dogs, porcupines, red pandas, emus, dingos, North American river otters, and other animals. Signs often ask challenging questions, reinforcing presentations made in the zoo&#x27;s Discovery Center, or alert viewers to look for signs of animal habitation. Along one part of the Discovery Trail, young visitors may crawl through &quot;underground burrows&quot; to observation posts roofed with clear, hemispherical observation ports. They may observe prairie dogs in the ground, right in the midst of the animals themselves.

====Animal Lifestyles====
Animal Lifestyles, in the western quadrant of the zoo, features indoor habitat exhibits. Visitors in the foyer of the building are shown Life in the Water, Life in Air, and Life on Land dioramas. Each diorama holds a carefully controlled environment that features select animals. These central displays broadly relate animals to their surrounds. Exhibits featuring more specific biota branch off from the central foyer. Side exhibits center on black-footed cats, pallas cats, sand cats, cotton-top tamarins, meerkats, emerald tree boas, dwarf mongooses, desert monitors, among others. Some of these exhibits feature critically endangered animals. The Prospect Park Zoo is engaged in breeding species in captivity, a part of the larger wild life recovery program of the Wildlife Conservation Society.

The main Animal Lifestyles exhibit consists of a troop of hamadryas baboons. Zoo visitors may observe the troop in a large glassed-in gallery which looks out into a rocky outcrop. Small caves in the outcrop lead to interior burrows where the animals may avoid inclement weather. The rear wall of the gallery illustrates common forms of baboon signalling and behavior, along with other social aspects of the animals. Ample seating allows visitors to observe the troop.

====Animals in Our Lives====
Animals in Our Lives in the northern quadrant of the zoo has both indoor and outdoor exhibits illustrating relationships between animals and people and animal adaptations. The Animals in Art themed area occupies one side of the Animals in Our Lives building. The other side of the building showcases animals and their adaptations for a variety of survival needs.

A small working barn further north of the building contains the Animals in Our Lives exhibit. It is organized around a working barn with sheep, cows, goats, ducks, geese and other animals.

=== Educational programs ===

The zoo hosts educational venues as well as exhibits. These revolve around the Discovery Center, a building with classrooms and laboratories designed to introduce school-age children to investigative practices of environmental and wildlife scientists. The Discovery Center introduces children to laboratory practices; they learn about and use professional laboratory equipment and learn how to integrate what they observe into zoological theory. These programs are based on educational concepts developed through WIZE (Wildlife Inquiry through Zoo Education), a program developed by Bronx Zoo educators.

The volunteer program at the Prospect Park Zoo engages members of the community; it is a combination outreach and educational program for adults. Volunteer guides conduct tours for visitors, while volunteer augment the educational program. Docents enroll in a four-month training program.

=== Facilities ===
The zoo grounds and building exteriors were designed by Aymar Embury II. The facility consists of six red brick and lime-stoned trimmed buildings grouped in a semi-circular arrangement around a central courtyard with the sea lion pool occupying the center of the court. The building exteriors date to the 1930s while the interiors were built during the 1989–1993 reconstruction. There is a freestanding wooden barn just north of the circular group of buildings. A set of stairs from the main entrance leads visitors down to zoo level. A small restaurant and the administrative center is immediately to the left, occupying the southeastern quadrant of the zoo. The Discovery Center is immediately to the right, occupying the northeastern quadrant of the zoo. Arrayed in front of the visitor are the three exhibit buildings, The World of Animals to the south, the Animal Lifestyles building, behind the sea lion pool directly in front of the visitor, Animals in our Lives is to the right.

== History ==

=== First menagerie ===
The original 1866 proposal of Prospect Park featured a &quot;Zoological Garden&quot; on the western flank of the park, near the present Litchfield Villa, but the garden had not been started by the time Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux separated from the park in 1874. This notwithstanding, a few features of the original park design did serve zoological purposes. A Wild Fowl Pond, once occupying the northern quadrant of the zoo grounds, served as a haven for water birds. A Deer Paddock, once occupying the southern quadrants of the zoo grounds, was a penned-in area for deer. In addition, a flock of sheep regularly maintained the grass in the park meadows and were kept in a paddock on the eastern flank of Sullivan Hill, near the now-demolished .

Interest in zoological gardens flowered in the last decade of the 19th century. An informal Menagerie began to take shape within Prospect Park in May 1890 when the newly appointed president of the City of Brooklyn Parks Commission, George V. Brower, donated &quot;three young cinnamon bears.&quot; State Treasurer Harry Adams followed with a donation of three white deer, establishing a pattern. It was mainly through donations of animals by rich or prominent individuals that the Menagerie grew. By 1893, one observer noted that “seven seals arrived, one buffalo, from the estate of Samuel B. Duryea, three red foxes, three bears, one sacred cow, two white deer, five red deer, seven seals, and twelve to fifteen peacocks.&quot;

The animals were kept in pens on Sullivan Hill, situated across the East Drive from the zoo&#x27;s present location, near the sheep paddock and northeast of the Dairy Farmhouse. Of the original zoological facilities in the park, the Deer Paddock, located near the present Carousel, was converted into a meadow and the deer were moved to the new Menagerie, The Wild Fowl Pond remained, located on the east side of the park in a low area now forming the northern part of the zoo. The Menagerie continued to accrue animals in the first decades of the 20th century. These were generally donated by prominent individuals and institutions and formed a varied collection of specimens both native to North America and other regions of the world. A two-story brick building was opened in the Menagerie in 1916, housing monkeys, some small mammals, and several birds. An elephant house in the zoo was announced in 1930, and a heating system was proposed for the elephant house in 1932.

=== Modern zoo creation ===
After assuming office in January 1934, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia hired Robert Moses to head a newly unified Parks Department. Moses soon prepared extensive plans to reconstruct the city&#x27;s parks, renovate existing facilities and create new swimming pools, zoos, playgrounds and parks. Moses acquired substantial Civil Works Administration, and later, Works Progress Administration funding and soon embarked upon an eight-year citywide construction program, relieving some of the high unemployment in New York City in this Depression year. Aymar Embury II prepared plans for the new zoo, which were announced in March 1934. The new zoo was to be located between the Wild Fowl Pond and former Deer Paddock on the east side of the park, across the East Drive from the Menagerie and slightly north of Willink Plaza and the Lefferts Historic House. Work on preliminary excavations had already started when Embury&#x27;s plans were officially announced. 

Embury designed a half circle of six brick buildings centered on a seal pool. Built of red brick with limestone trim, the buildings featured bas-relief scenes from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. Five sculptors executed a total of thirteen such scenes, not only on the front and back walls of zoo buildings, but also on all four sides of both brick entrance shelters at Flatbush Avenue. However, the positioning of some of the bas-reliefs makes them less accessible than others. The buildings constituted an integrated facility and were seen as a great improvement over the somewhat haphazardly developed Menagerie. The zoo featured an extensive bear pit, a seal pool, a lion&#x27;s house (the current Animals in our Lives building) an elephant&#x27;s house (the current Animal Lifestyles building), and a house for monkeys, birds, and horned animals (now the World of Animals building). These structures were to be accessed by a grand stair on Flatbush Avenue. In late 1934, the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; reported that the zoo was to be completed the next March. 

New York governor Al Smith was tasked with finding animals for the new exhibits in May 1935, and zoo officials began raising $50,000 that month to acquire animals. Samuel Klein of department store S. Klein provided $5,000 to buy animals for 25 cages, and Smith requested animals from states such as Vermont, Connecticut, and Virginia. Animals began arriving at the zoo at the end of June 1935. The new Prospect Park Zoo was dedicated on July 3, 1935, and received 150,000 visitors on its first day. Only three of the five planned structures were completed at that time. Moses and La Guardia, who had missed the zoo&#x27;s official opening, toured the facility later that month. Tens of thousands of local children suggested names for the zoo&#x27;s animals, who were formally given monikers at a ceremony in September 1935. Upon the new zoo&#x27;s completion, the Dairy Farmhouse, sheep paddock, and Menagerie were demolished, and the sheep flock in Prospect Park were supplanted by mechanical mowers.
=== Mid- and late 20th century ===
From the 1930s to the 1980s, the zoo showcased large animals from faraway places. An estimated one million people visited the Prospect Park Zoo annually prior to World War II, but attendance gradually declined, reaching about a half million by the early 1980s.

==== Early years ====
In its first few months of operation, the zoo recorded an average of 100,000 daily visitors. The zoo initially had 131 animals and 56 birds and recorded two million visitors in its first ten months. Within two years of the zoo&#x27;s opening, numerous animals joined the collection, such as elephants, a buck and doe, a boa constrictor, anteaters, and lizards. In addition, some animals were bred in the zoo, such as a brown bear, leopards, and several litters of lions. The zoo had 125,000 weekly visitors by mid-1937, some of whom went too close to the animals&#x27; cages or exhibits, prompting police to patrol the zoo. Zoo officials announced in 1939 that they would build a ramp around the elephant enclosure, following separate incidents in which one elephant was killed and another was injured. Officials also announced plans to reinforce the walls of the kangaroo enclosure after a kangaroo escaped into the streets of Brooklyn. Ronald Cheyne-Stout, who had been appointed as the zoo&#x27;s director when it reopened, was removed from his position in 1939.

The number of animals in the zoo increased through the 1940s, and officials held competitions where children named the new animals. In addition, Works Progress Administration laborers built a hay barn in the zoo in 1940. Visitors frequently tossed items into the zoo&#x27;s enclosures, which killed many of the animals by 1943, including one elephant, 45 monkeys, and all of the zoo&#x27;s seals. As a result, the police began strictly enforcing a rule banning patrons from feeding animals. In 1948, the city government provided $10,000 to purchase additional animals for the Central Park and Prospect Park zoos. Several animals were also born at the zoo in the late 1940s and the 1950s, such as a zebra, bear cubs, a llama, and a hippo. Zoo officials also expanded the collection by buying animals such as elephants. The U.S. government gave $615,000 for the restoration of the Prospect Park Zoo and other parts of the park in 1966. Many of the zoo&#x27;s cages were widened in the late 1960s.

==== Decline ====
As early as 1967, zoo superintendent Ronald Ellis said the animals were so frequently abused that all of the animals had to be moved indoors at night. At the time, anyone could walk into the zoo from the street. In response to a 1967 report in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, the city doubled the number of security guards at the zoo at night. Writing in &quot;New York&quot; magazine in late 1970, writer Erik Sanberg-Diment termed the zoo the &#x27;rattiest&#x27; in New York – &quot;in the literal sense of the word. (I&#x27;ve never been there without seeing several rodents romping in the bear lair).&quot; He reported that one of the zoo&#x27;s earliest residents, a Southern United States black vulture, &quot;…is still there, looking down his beak at visitors littering the walks, and celebrating his 35th anniversary in the same old cage.&quot; 

During the 1970s, there were multiple incidents involving animal injuries or deaths. This included the scalding death of a monkey in 1975, allegedly by a zoo employee, as well as an acting zoo director who was accused of shooting at pigeons and killing zoo animals. A zoo employee also locked himself in a monkey enclosure for several hours in 1974 to protest conditions at the zoo. These incidents, as well as several others at the Central Park Zoo, prompted protests by animal-rights groups who wanted to close the two zoos and move the animals to the larger Bronx Zoo. The administration of mayor Ed Koch and the New York Zoological Society (renamed the Wildlife Conservation Society, or WCS, in 1993) signed a fifty-year agreement in April 1980, wherein the Central Park, Prospect Park, and Queens Zoos would be administered by the Society.

By the 1980s, a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter quoted a zoo supervisor as saying: &quot;Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.&quot; According to the supervisor, one of the zoo&#x27;s bears frequently had bloodied feet because of all the litter in the zoo. Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the &quot;10 worst&quot; zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. The May 1987 mauling death of Juan Perez, an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit, underscored the difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility. By late summer 1987, an $18-million, 2.5-year renovation plan was put forth to renovate Prospect Park Zoo and coordinate its venue with other facilities to avoid redundant programming. Prospect Park Zoo was slated to specialize in children programs and house smaller, non-aggressive animal species.

==== Renovation and repurposing ====
The Prospect Park Zoo closed to the public in June 1988. Over the next six months, new homes were found for the displaced animals in other zoos throughout the US. Demolition was managed by the Parks Department and began in June 1989. The renovation was originally estimated to cost $18 million and take two and a half years. The exteriors of the Aymar Embury buildings were preserved, but badly deteriorated interiors were gutted, pits and cages were demolished, and new structures were built. The facilities were turned over to the NY Zoological Society in April 1993. The Society aimed to designate each of its three small zoos with a specific purpose. The Central Park Zoo would be focused toward conservation; the Prospect Park Zoo would be primarily a children&#x27;s zoo; and the Queens Zoo would become a zoo with North American animals.

The project was not complete until 1993; it had cost $36 million in total. Though the work was substantially complete in April, a further six months were needed to repopulate the zoo, prepare exhibits, and ready the facility for the public. The repurposed zoo opened on October 5, 1993, and renamed the &quot;Prospect Park Wildlife Conservation Center&quot;. The Zoological Society hoped that the new name would suggest that the &quot;Wildlife Conservation Center&quot; was far more than a mere &quot;zoo&quot;; it was indeed a facility designed to preserve animal species. This name change coincided with the renaming of the zoological society to the &quot;Wildlife Conservation Society&quot;.

The programs of the new center were geared toward educating children. Classrooms for the Discovery Center were housed in a dedicated building on the north wing of the zoo. Exhibits housed smaller species, eschewing elephants, tigers, and lions, and augmented displays with interactive exhibits.

===21st century===
In 2003, Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed eliminating funding for the Prospect Park and Queens zoos to fill a citywide budget gap, effectively forcing the WCS to close the zoos. The changes would have resulted in a total savings of around $5.6 million or $5.8 million. City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo that June, estimating that the city would save $6 million but that the WCS would have to spend $8 million to decommission the zoos and find homes for 160 displaced animals. In response to the announcement, local residents signed petitions opposing the budget cuts; one such petition garnered more than 100,000 signatures. There were discussions about restoring the funds in exchange for raising admission fees and introducing private sponsorships at the zoos, and the WCS also contemplated renting out the zoos for private events. That June, the city government ultimately agreed to restore $4.8 million for the Prospect Park and Queens zoos, though the WCS had to fire staff, discontinue programs, and double admission fees.

Funding levels for the Wildlife Conservation Society were restored in the 2007 city budget, though vulnerability to shortfalls remained. In the opening months of 2009, the WCS itself faced the prospect of losing its fiscal year 2010 New York State funding. The Prospect Park Zoo&#x27;s Discovery Center reopened in December 2012 following a renovation. The discovery center included a children&#x27;s play area, puzzle area, stage, activity boxes, and reading areas. The Prospect Park Zoo began displaying three Juliana pigs in 2015.

In March 2020, the Prospect Park Zoo and the WCS&#x27;s other facilities were shuttered indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. The zoo reopened that July. The zoo again closed indefinitely following the September 2023 New York floods, during which basements were flooded with up to of water, and WCS workers worked on restoring power to the zoo over the following months. The WCS announced in May 2024 that the zoo would reopen to the general public on May 26, following repairs to the enclosures and mechanical systems.

<doc id="1211971" wikidata="Q1984419" url="?curid=1211971" title="Gumshoe (film)">
<text>Gumshoe is a 1971 British black comedy film directed (in his debut) by Stephen Frears and starring Albert Finney, Billie Whitelaw and Frank Finlay. It was written by Neville Smith. The film follows a bingo-caller who dreams of being a private eye.

==Plot==
Eddie Ginley works at a bingo hall in Liverpool, England, but dreams of becoming a stylish private investigator like those he has read about and seen in films. After finally placing an advertisement in a local newspaper announcing his detective services, he receives a mysterious offer. Although Ginley is inexperienced and clueless in certain aspects of investigating, he soon realises that he is entangled in a serious case involving drugs, murder, and even his own family.

==Cast==

==Production==
The film contains shots of Liverpool buildings that have long since been demolished, including the employment exchange on Leece Street. Several scenes in the London part of the narrative take place in and around the occult Atlantis Bookshop.

&quot;Gumshoe&quot; was the first of two films with original music scores by Andrew Lloyd Webber (the other was &quot;The Odessa File&quot;, in 1974). Some of the music used was originally written for Lloyd Webber&#x27;s then-abandoned musical version of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;; the music was restored to its original place when work on the musical was resumed years later. Roy Young recorded the song &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re Good For Me&quot;, written by Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.

A scene was significantly shortened before release because of its detailed depiction of a heroin user preparing and taking his &quot;fix&quot;. After years of unavailability, &quot;Gumshoe&quot; was released on DVD in 2009.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;The easiest and most obvious thing to say about Gumshoe is that it is quietly and delightfully funny every inch of the way, all the more so because it never indulges in obvious pastiche, instead filtering its many echoes of the Forties thrillers through the pop-tinted glasses of the Presley Fifties as well as the sober horn-rims of reality.  ... Gumshoe [is] an extraordinarily difficult film to review, mainly because its various levels are so closely dovetailed that any attempt to take them apart leaves one with limp, meaningless strands in one&#x27;s hands. ...Everything in the film – Stephen Frears&#x27; first feature – is exactly right, from the throbbing Forties score down to the end of the cast list (with Fulton Mackay stealing any honours Finney leaves behind) and the brilliantly self-effacing direction; but its most remarkable achievement is perhaps that behind all the jokes and flurries, another Eddie peeps through, vulnerable, lonely and despairing. At the end, sitting with his hat tipped rakishly over his eyes listening to a rock-and-roll record, he is Sam Spade again; but nothing can quite efface the memory of the hurt, lost child whose brother melted down his toy soldiers to sell the lead and who was betrayed by the girl he loved.&quot;

<doc id="1211977" wikidata="Q7318963" url="?curid=1211977" title="Revolving fund">
<text>A revolving fund is a fund or account that remains available to finance an organization&#x27;s continuing operations without any fiscal year limitation, because the organization replenishes the fund by repaying money used from the account. Revolving funds have been used to support both government and non-profit operations.

In the case of revolving funds for a government project whose budget goes through annual parliamentary or other legislative appropriations that relate to a fiscal year then the unutilized balance may lapse after the close of the financial year. However it is restored the next year provided the agency concerned includes the amount in next year&#x27;s appropriation.

Within federal and state governments, law establishes revolving funds. Revolving funds, established for the purpose of carrying out specific activities, institute a basis under which financing for the cost of goods or services furnished to or by a government agency originate. Revolving funds are to be replenished through charges made for such goods or services.

Revolving funds can be especially valuable for non-profit organizations because they afford both the donor and the non-profit significant advantages. Often a non-profit must announce a program, engage personnel, extend invitations or sign contracts well ahead of raising the donations or receiving the program revenue that will cover the costs. In such cases a revolving fund allows the non-profit to commit to programs early so that it can ensure professional execution and the program&#x27;s success. The non-profit then can work to generate the revenue, donations, or other support that will repay the money spent.

There are several situations in which such funds would be particularly helpful, one example would be funding sources for historic preservation projects. A non-profit preservation organization would establish a fund to receive donations and other capital which is used by the organization to purchase endangered property which is then resold with easements. Some organizations also make loans for building renovations, which then replenish the revolving funds as those loans are repaid. The Providence Revolving Fund is one of the largest local revolving funds in the US.

Another example would be a revolving fund established to provide support for programs that require a long-term commitment for planning well ahead of the non-profit&#x27;s fund-raising cycle. By accessing money in the revolving fund, the non-profit can commit to the project, including signing contracts or issuing invitations, knowing that funding is available from the revolving fund. As the project is funded through donations or through revenue the project may generate, the funds can be repaid to the revolving fund. This ensures the fund is available for future programming.

Such a revolving fund offers several advantages to the donor. The donor&#x27;s commitment is limited and the gift can be restricted for the sole purpose of supporting the program(s) for which it is intended. At the same time the funds committed to a revolving fund may be multiplied several fold as the non-profit repays money it may have taken from the fund. The non-profit will have a great incentive to repay the money to the revolving fund, in order to continue to enjoy the advantages of the revolving fund for future years.

==United States government==

According to &quot;A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process&quot;, a revolving fund is established by Congress to finance a cycle of businesslike operations through amounts received by the fund. A revolving fund charges for the sale of products or services and uses the proceeds to finance its spending, usually on a self-sustaining basis.

<doc id="1211982" wikidata="Q1391515" url="?curid=1211982" title="Mordechai Maklef">
<text>Mordechai (Motke) Maklef (or Makleff) (; 19 January 1920 – 22 February 1978) was the third Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and later, director-general of many important public companies in the Israeli economy.

==Early life==
Makleff was born in the village of Motza, near Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine in 1920. His parents were among the founders of this first modern village outside Jerusalem, located along the road to Jaffa. During the 1929 Palestine riots, inhabitants of the neighbouring Arab village of Qalunya attacked the Makleff home, which was located along the perimeter of Motza, and killed the entire family, except the young Mordechai, who managed to escape the massacre by jumping from a second story window. The murderers included a shepherd employed by the family and the local policeman, who was the only person in the area to own a gun. The murder shocked the Jewish population of Palestine, and was one of the most remembered rioting events. With his immediate family now dead, Mordechai Makleff was raised by relatives in Jerusalem and Haifa.

==Military career==
As a teen, Makleff was active in the Haganah and in Orde Wingate&#x27;s Night Raiders unit. With the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Palestine Regiment of the British Army and fought in the North African and Italian campaigns. He was commissioned from the rank of sergeant in July 1942. Upon his release from the army with the rank of major in August 1946, he remained in Europe, engaged in illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine and acquiring arms for the emerging Jewish state. He later returned to Palestine and rejoined the Haganah.

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Makleff fought in the Carmeli Brigade, as its senior operation officer and later as brigade commander, leading Jewish forces in the battle of Haifa and in operations near Acre. He also took part in Operation Hiram, in which Jewish forces captured the entire Galilee region for Israel. After the war, he headed the Israeli delegation to talks with Lebanon and Syria. In November 1949, he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff to Yigael Yadin and senior operations officer of the IDF. Following Yadin&#x27;s resignation in 1952, Makleff, then just 32 years old, was appointed to replace him as Chief of Staff. He agreed to accept the position for a period of one year only. His tenure as Chief of Staff was marked by his battles with the Ministry of Defence, and in particular with Shimon Peres. David Ben-Gurion commented in his diary &quot;I had the clear impression that M. suffered from an inferiority complex and suspected that his authority was being undermined&quot;. Makleff resigned on 11 October 1953, after repeated demands that relations between the army and the Ministry of Defence be reformed.

During that time, Israel was faced with increasing attacks from &quot;fedayeen&quot;, Palestinian raiders from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who attacked Israeli border settlements. In response to this, Makleff appointed Major Ariel Sharon to form a commando unit to attack the &quot;fedayeen&quot; bases across the border and put an end to the attacks on Israeli civilians. Sharon, in turn, created Unit 101, which conducted a lengthy series of retaliatory raids throughout 1953, when it was merged into the Paratroopers Brigade.

He was also responsible for the establishing of Unit 131 which set up clandestine cells in Arab states to be activated in the event of war. A year later, the cell in Egypt was exposed in events that led to the Lavon Affair.

==Civilian career==
On 7 December 1953, exactly one year after he assumed the position, Maklef resigned as Chief of Staff. He went on to serve in a number of key positions in the Israeli public sector. From 1955 to 1968, he was Director General of the Dead Sea Works, developing the local phosphate industry in that region. He also served as Director General of the Citrus Marketing Board and Israel Chemicals.

Maklef died from a heart attack in Germany in 1978, and was buried in the military cemetery in Kiryat Shaul, Israel.

<text>Donald Forrester Brown (23 February 1890 – 1 October 1916) was a New Zealand soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Dunedin, Brown was a farmer when the First World War began in 1914. In late 1915, he volunteered for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and was posted to the 2nd Battalion, the Otago Infantry Regiment. He saw action on the Western Front, and was awarded the VC for his actions during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette in September 1916. As he was killed several days later during the Battle of Le Transloy, the award was made posthumously. His VC was the second to be awarded to a soldier serving with the NZEF during the war and was the first earned in an action on the Western Front.

==Early life==
Donald Forrester Brown was born on 23 February 1890 in Dunedin, New Zealand. He was one of 10 children of Robert Brown, a draper living in Oamaru, and his wife Jessie (). His parents were migrants from Scotland who had married in New Zealand. The youngest boy in his family, Brown was educated at South School and, later, Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School in Oamaru. After completing his schooling he took up farming, and by 1913 had purchased a farm at Totara, south of Oamaru.

==First World War==
When the First World War broke out, Brown continued to work on his farm for a year but then sold it and volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) on 19 October 1915. He received his training at Trentham Military Camp and embarked for the Middle East in January 1916 with the Ninth Reinforcements. By this time he had been promoted to corporal. The newly formed New Zealand Division was training in Egypt and when Brown arrived, he was posted to the 2nd Battalion, Otago Infantry Regiment. Within a few months he was on the Western Front in France with the rest of the division.

On arrival in France, the New Zealanders were assigned to the Armentières sector of the Western Front. This area was considered to be a &quot;nursery&quot; sector, for introducing inexperienced troops to the Western Front. Brown&#x27;s battalion was initially positioned to the east of Armentières. Despite being a quiet part of the front, it was still exposed to artillery and sniper fire. The battalion rotated regularly in and out of the front line, as it gained experience in trench warfare. In August 1916, the division began transferring to the Somme sector.

The next month, Brown, by then a sergeant, was involved in the Battle of Flers–Courcelette, part of the Somme Offensive. On the opening day of the battle, 15 September, the 2nd Otago Battalion, alongside the 2nd Auckland Battalion, was ordered to capture a series of German-held trenches from their position south-east of High Wood. The advance commenced at 6:20 am. While the first trench was easily captured with the assistance of effective artillery support, his company came under heavy flanking machine gun fire while advancing to the next trench, which caused many casualties in the company. Brown, together with another soldier, Corporal Jesse Rodgers, attacked one machine gun post, killing the crew and capturing the gun. The remaining soldiers regrouped and prepared for an attack on the next trench. During a covering artillery barrage they once again came under fire from a machine gun post. Brown was among those who attacked this second machine gun post, swiftly dealing with the threat.

Once the covering barrage lifted, the New Zealanders advanced and captured their next objective, a position known as Switch Trench, by 7:00 am. Some tanks were supposed to have been assisting the infantry but these never appeared. Brown was key in immediately improving the existing defences in preparation against a possible counterattack, by digging new trenches for shelter should Switch Trench be targeted by German artillery. The following day, his battalion was relieved and withdrew from the front line. Brown&#x27;s company lost 123 men from its initial complement of 180 during the opening day of the battle.

After a period of rest, Brown&#x27;s battalion moved back into the front line on the evening of 28 September. It was to be one of the assaulting battalions involved in an attack to clear out a German trench system near Eaucourt L&#x27;Abbaye as part of the Battle of Le Transloy that commenced on 1 October. On the opening day of the battle, Brown was again involved in the seizing of a German machine gun post at a strongpoint that was holding up the advance. Moving forward on his own, armed only with a pistol, Brown attacked the post. He managed to kill its crew and capture the gun which allowed his fellow troops to attack and capture the strongpoint. While firing at German soldiers as they fled, Brown was shot in the head by a sniper and killed instantly.

==Victoria Cross==
Brown&#x27;s company commander had recommended him for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions on 15 September. In a letter to Brown&#x27;s father, his battalion commander hoped that the recommendation would be upgraded to a Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The senior leadership of the NZEF were slow to recognise Brown&#x27;s gallantry and it was not until the officers of his battalion lobbied for a VC nomination that any progress was made. The award of the VC to Brown appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 15 June 1917. The citation read:

Brown&#x27;s VC was only the second to be awarded to a soldier of the NZEF and the first as a result of an action on the Western Front. Arthur Foljambe, the 2nd Earl of Liverpool and New Zealand&#x27;s Governor General, presented the VC to Brown&#x27;s father in a ceremony at Oamaru on 30 August 1917. The medal remains in the possession of his family but it has been loaned for display at Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School, the QEII Army Memorial Museum in Waiouru and the North Otago Museum.

Brown is buried at Warlencourt British Cemetery, France. A memorial tablet in his honour was unveiled in the Oamaru Municipal Chambers on 27 October 1917. In 1919, as part of an effort to recognise men from North Otago who had been killed in the war, an oak tree was planted in his memory in Oamaru. There is also a plaque honouring him in Queens Gardens, Dunedin.

<text>In mechanics, virtual work arises in the application of the &quot;principle of least action&quot; to the study of forces and movement of a mechanical system. The work of a force acting on a particle as it moves along a displacement is different for different displacements. Among all the possible displacements that a particle may follow, called virtual displacements, one will minimize the action. This displacement is therefore the displacement followed by the particle according to the principle of least action. The work of a force on a particle along a virtual displacement is known as the virtual work.

Historically, virtual work and the associated calculus of variations were formulated to analyze systems of rigid bodies, but they have also been developed for the study of the mechanics of deformable bodies.

== History ==
The principle of virtual work had always been used in some form since antiquity in the study of statics. It was used by the Greeks, medieval Arabs and Latins, and Renaissance Italians as &quot;the law of lever&quot;. The idea of virtual work was invoked by many notable physicists of the 17th century, such as Galileo, Descartes, Torricelli, Wallis, and Huygens, in varying degrees of generality, when solving problems in statics. Working with Leibnizian concepts, Johann Bernoulli systematized the virtual work principle and made explicit the concept of infinitesimal displacement. He was able to solve problems for both rigid bodies as well as fluids. Bernoulli&#x27;s version of virtual work law appeared in his letter to Pierre Varignon in 1715, which was later published in Varignon&#x27;s second volume of &quot;Nouvelle mécanique ou Statique&quot; in 1725. This formulation of the principle is today known as the principle of virtual velocities and is commonly considered as the prototype of the contemporary virtual work principles. In 1743 D&#x27;Alembert published his &quot;Traité de Dynamique&quot; where he applied the principle of virtual work, based on Bernoulli&#x27;s work, to solve various problems in dynamics. His idea was to convert a dynamical problem into static problem by introducing &quot;inertial force&quot;. In 1768, Lagrange presented the virtual work principle in a more efficient form by introducing generalized coordinates and presented it as an alternative principle of mechanics by which all problems of equilibrium could be solved. A systematic exposition of Lagrange&#x27;s program of applying this approach to all of mechanics, both static and dynamic, essentially D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle, was given in his &quot;Mécanique Analytique&quot; of 1788. Although Lagrange had presented his version of least action principle prior to this work, he recognized the virtual work principle to be more fundamental mainly because it could be assumed alone as the foundation for all mechanics, unlike the modern understanding that least action does not account for non-conservative forces.

==Overview==
If a force acts on a particle as it moves from point formula_1 to point formula_2, then, for each possible trajectory that the particle may take, it is possible to compute the total work done by the force along the path. The &quot;principle of virtual work&quot;, which is the form of the principle of least action applied to these systems, states that the path actually followed by the particle is the one for which the difference between the work along this path and other nearby paths is zero (to the first order). The formal procedure for computing the difference of functions evaluated on nearby paths is a generalization of the derivative known from differential calculus, and is termed &quot;the calculus of variations&quot;.

Consider a point particle that moves along a path which is described by a function formula_3 from point formula_1, where formula_5, to point formula_2, where formula_7. It is possible that the particle moves from formula_1 to formula_2 along a nearby path described by formula_10, where formula_11 is called the variation of formula_3. The variation formula_11 satisfies the requirement formula_14. The scalar components of the variation formula_15, formula_16 and formula_17 are called virtual displacements. This can be generalized to an arbitrary mechanical system defined by the generalized coordinates formula_18, formula_19. In which case, the variation of the trajectory formula_20 is defined by the virtual displacements formula_21, formula_19.

Virtual work is the total work done by the applied forces and the inertial forces of a mechanical system as it moves through a set of virtual displacements. When considering forces applied to a body in static equilibrium, the principle of least action requires the virtual work of these forces to be zero.

== Mathematical treatment ==
Consider a particle &quot;P&quot; that moves from a point &quot;A&quot; to a point &quot;B&quot; along a trajectory , while a force is applied to it. The work done by the force is given by the integral
formula_23
where is the differential element along the curve that is the trajectory of &quot;P&quot;, and is its velocity. It is important to notice that the value of the work depends on the trajectory .

Now consider particle &quot;P&quot; that moves from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot; again, but this time it moves along the nearby trajectory that differs from by the variation , where is a scaling constant that can be made as small as desired and is an arbitrary function that satisfies . Suppose the force is the same as . The work done by the force is given by the integral
formula_24
The variation of the work associated with this nearby path, known as the &quot;virtual work&quot;, can be computed to be
formula_25

If there are no constraints on the motion of &quot;P&quot;, then 3 parameters are needed to completely describe &quot;P&quot;″s position at any time . If there are () constraint forces, then parameters are needed. Hence, we can define generalized coordinates (), and express and in terms of the generalized coordinates. That is,
formula_26
formula_27
Then, the derivative of the variation is given by
formula_28
then we have 
formula_29
The requirement that the virtual work be zero for an arbitrary variation is equivalent to the set of requirements
formula_30
The terms are called the &quot;generalized forces&quot; associated with the virtual displacement .

== Static equilibrium ==
Static equilibrium is a state in which the net force and net torque acted upon the system is zero. In other words, both linear momentum and angular momentum of the system are conserved. The principle of virtual work states that &quot;the virtual work of the applied forces is zero for all virtual movements of the system from static equilibrium&quot;. This principle can be generalized such that three dimensional rotations are included: the virtual work of the applied forces and applied moments is zero for all virtual movements of the system from static equilibrium. That is
formula_31
where Fi&quot; , &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;m&quot; and Mj&quot; , &quot;j&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot; are the applied forces and applied moments, respectively, and &quot;δri&quot; , &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;m&quot; and &quot;δφj&quot;, &quot;j&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot; are the virtual displacements and virtual rotations, respectively.

Suppose the system consists of &quot;N&quot; particles, and it has &quot;f&quot; (&quot;f&quot; ≤ 6&quot;N&quot;) degrees of freedom. It is sufficient to use only &quot;f&quot; coordinates to give a complete description of the motion of the system, so &quot;f&quot; generalized coordinates &quot;qk&quot; , &quot;k&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;f&quot; are defined such that the virtual movements can be expressed in terms of these generalized coordinates. That is,
formula_32
formula_33

The virtual work can then be reparametrized by the generalized coordinates:
formula_34
where the generalized forces &quot;Qk&quot; are defined as
formula_35
Kane shows that these generalized forces can also be formulated in terms of the ratio of time derivatives. That is,
formula_36

The principle of virtual work requires that the virtual work done on a system by the forces F&quot;i&quot; and moments M&quot;j&quot; vanishes if it is in equilibrium. Therefore, the generalized forces &quot;Q&quot;&quot;k&quot; are zero, that is
formula_37

=== Constraint forces ===
An important benefit of the principle of virtual work is that only forces that do work as the system moves through a virtual displacement are needed to determine the mechanics of the system. There are many forces in a mechanical system that do no work during a virtual displacement, which means that they need not be considered in this analysis. The two important examples are (i) the internal forces in a rigid body, and (ii) the constraint forces at an ideal joint.

Lanczos presents this as the postulate: &quot;The virtual work of the forces of reaction is always zero for any virtual displacement which is in harmony with the given kinematic constraints.&quot; The argument is as follows. The principle of virtual work states that in equilibrium the virtual work of the forces applied to a system is zero. Newton&#x27;s laws state that at equilibrium the applied forces are equal and opposite to the reaction, or constraint forces. This means the virtual work of the constraint forces must be zero as well.
== Law of the lever ==
A lever is modeled as a rigid bar connected to a ground frame by a hinged joint called a fulcrum. The lever is operated by applying an input force F&quot;A&quot; at a point &quot;A&quot; located by the coordinate vector r&quot;A&quot; on the bar. The lever then exerts an output force F&quot;B&quot; at the point &quot;B&quot; located by r&quot;B&quot;. The rotation of the lever about the fulcrum &quot;P&quot; is defined by the rotation angle &quot;θ&quot;.
Let the coordinate vector of the point &quot;P&quot; that defines the fulcrum be r&quot;P&quot;, and introduce the lengths 
formula_38
which are the distances from the fulcrum to the input point &quot;A&quot; and to the output point &quot;B&quot;, respectively.

Now introduce the unit vectors e&quot;A&quot; and e&quot;B&quot; from the fulcrum to the point &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, so
formula_39
This notation allows us to define the velocity of the points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; as
formula_40
where e&quot;A&quot;⊥ and e&quot;B&quot;⊥ are unit vectors perpendicular to e&quot;A&quot; and e&quot;B&quot;, respectively.

The angle &quot;θ&quot; is the generalized coordinate that defines the configuration of the lever, therefore using the formula above for forces applied to a one degree-of-freedom mechanism, the generalized force is given by
formula_41

Now, denote as &quot;F&quot;&quot;A&quot; and &quot;F&quot;&quot;B&quot; the components of the forces that are perpendicular to the radial segments &quot;PA&quot; and &quot;PB&quot;. These forces are given by
formula_42
This notation and the principle of virtual work yield the formula for the generalized force as
formula_43

The ratio of the output force &quot;F&quot;&quot;B&quot; to the input force &quot;F&quot;&quot;A&quot; is the mechanical advantage of the lever, and is obtained from the principle of virtual work as
formula_44

This equation shows that if the distance &quot;a&quot; from the fulcrum to the point &quot;A&quot; where the input force is applied is greater than the distance &quot;b&quot; from fulcrum to the point &quot;B&quot; where the output force is applied, then the lever amplifies the input force. If the opposite is true that the distance from the fulcrum to the input point &quot;A&quot; is less than from the fulcrum to the output point &quot;B&quot;, then the lever reduces the magnitude of the input force.

This is the &quot;law of the lever&quot;, which was proven by Archimedes using geometric reasoning.

== Gear train ==
A gear train is formed by mounting gears on a frame so that the teeth of the gears engage. Gear teeth are designed to ensure the pitch circles of engaging gears roll on each other without slipping, this provides a smooth transmission of rotation from one gear to the next. For this analysis, we consider a gear train that has one degree-of-freedom, which means the angular rotation of all the gears in the gear train are defined by the angle of the input gear. 
The size of the gears and the sequence in which they engage define the ratio of the angular velocity &quot;ωA&quot; of the input gear to the angular velocity &quot;ωB&quot; of the output gear, known as the speed ratio, or gear ratio, of the gear train. Let &quot;R&quot; be the speed ratio, then
formula_45

The input torque &quot;T&quot;&quot;A&quot; acting on the input gear &quot;G&quot;&quot;A&quot; is transformed by the gear train into the output torque &quot;T&quot;&quot;B&quot; exerted by the output gear &quot;G&quot;&quot;B&quot;. If we assume, that the gears are rigid and that there are no losses in the engagement of the gear teeth, then the principle of virtual work can be used to analyze the static equilibrium of the gear train.

Let the angle &quot;θ&quot; of the input gear be the generalized coordinate of the gear train, then the speed ratio &quot;R&quot; of the gear train defines the angular velocity of the output gear in terms of the input gear, that is
formula_46

The formula above for the principle of virtual work with applied torques yields the generalized force
formula_47

The mechanical advantage of the gear train is the ratio of the output torque &quot;T&quot;&quot;B&quot; to the input torque &quot;T&quot;&quot;A&quot;, and the above equation yields
formula_48

Thus, the speed ratio of a gear train also defines its mechanical advantage. This shows that if the input gear rotates faster than the output gear, then the gear train amplifies the input torque. And, if the input gear rotates slower than the output gear, then the gear train reduces the input torque.

== Dynamic equilibrium for rigid bodies ==
If the principle of virtual work for applied forces is used on individual particles of a rigid body, the principle can be generalized for a rigid body: &quot;When a rigid body that is in equilibrium is subject to virtual compatible displacements, the total virtual work of all external forces is zero; and conversely, if the total virtual work of all external forces acting on a rigid body is zero then the body is in equilibrium&quot;.

If a system is not in static equilibrium, D&#x27;Alembert showed that by introducing the acceleration terms of Newton&#x27;s laws as inertia forces, this approach is generalized to define dynamic equilibrium. The result is D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s form of the principle of virtual work, which is used to derive the equations of motion for a mechanical system of rigid bodies.

The expression &quot;compatible displacements&quot; means that the particles remain in contact and displace together so that the work done by pairs of action/reaction inter-particle forces cancel out. Various forms of this principle have been credited to Johann (Jean) Bernoulli (1667–1748) and Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782).
===Generalized inertia forces===
Let a mechanical system be constructed from n rigid bodies, Bi, i=1...,n, and let the resultant of the applied forces on each body be the force-torque pairs, Fi and Ti, &quot;i&quot; = 1...,&quot;n&quot;. Notice that these applied forces do not include the reaction forces where the bodies are connected. Finally, assume that the velocity Vi and angular velocities ωi, &quot;i&quot;=1...,&quot;n&quot;, for each rigid body, are defined by a single generalized coordinate q. Such a system of rigid bodies is said to have one degree of freedom.

Consider a single rigid body which moves under the action of a resultant force F and torque T, with one degree of freedom defined by the generalized coordinate q. Assume the reference point for the resultant force and torque is the center of mass of the body, then the generalized inertia force Q* associated with the generalized coordinate q is given by
formula_49
This inertia force can be computed from the kinetic energy of the rigid body,
formula_50
by using the formula
formula_51

A system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates has the kinetic energy
formula_52
which can be used to calculate the m generalized inertia forces
formula_53

===D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s form of the principle of virtual work===
D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s form of the principle of virtual work states that a system of rigid bodies is in dynamic equilibrium when the virtual work of the sum of the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero for any virtual displacement of the system. Thus, dynamic equilibrium of a system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates requires that
formula_54
for any set of virtual displacements &quot;δqj&quot;. This condition yields &quot;m&quot; equations,
formula_55
which can also be written as
formula_56
The result is a set of m equations of motion that define the dynamics of the rigid body system, known as Lagrange&#x27;s equations or the generalized equations of motion.

If the generalized forces Qj are derivable from a potential energy &quot;V&quot;(&quot;q&quot;1...,&quot;q&quot;&quot;m&quot;), then these equations of motion take the form
formula_57

In this case, introduce the Lagrangian, , so these equations of motion become
formula_58
These are known as the Euler-Lagrange equations for a system with m degrees of freedom, or Lagrange&#x27;s equations of the second kind.

==Virtual work principle for a deformable body==

Consider now the free body diagram of a deformable body, which is composed of an infinite number of differential cubes. Let&#x27;s define two unrelated states for the body:
* The formula_59-State : This shows external surface forces T, body forces f, and internal stresses formula_59 in equilibrium.
* The formula_61-State : This shows continuous displacements formula_62 and consistent strains formula_63.
The superscript * emphasizes that the two states are unrelated. Other than the above stated conditions, there is no need to specify if any of the states are real or virtual.

Imagine now that the forces and stresses in the formula_59-State undergo the displacements and deformations in the formula_61-State: We can compute the total virtual (imaginary) work done by all forces acting on the faces of all cubes in two different ways:

* First, by summing the work done by forces such as formula_66 which act on individual common faces (Fig.c): Since the material experiences compatible displacements, such work cancels out, leaving only the virtual work done by the surface forces T (which are equal to stresses on the cubes&#x27; faces, by equilibrium).
* Second, by computing the net work done by stresses or forces such as formula_66, formula_68 which act on an individual cube, e.g. for the one-dimensional case in Fig.(c): formula_69 where the equilibrium relation formula_70 has been used and the second order term has been neglected. Integrating over the whole body gives: formula_71 – Work done by the body forces f.

Equating the two results leads to the principle of virtual work for a deformable body:

where the total external virtual work is done by T and f. Thus,
The right-hand-side of (,) is often called the internal virtual work. The principle of virtual work then states: &quot;External virtual work is equal to internal virtual work when equilibrated forces and stresses undergo unrelated but consistent displacements and strains&quot;. It includes the principle of virtual work for rigid bodies as a special case where the internal virtual work is zero.

===Proof of equivalence between the principle of virtual work and the equilibrium equation===

We start by looking at the total work done by surface traction on the body going through the specified deformation:
formula_72

Applying divergence theorem to the right hand side yields:
formula_73

Now switch to indicial notation for the ease of derivation.
formula_74

To continue our derivation, we substitute in the equilibrium equation formula_75. Then
formula_76

The first term on the right hand side needs to be broken into a symmetric part and a skew part as follows:
formula_77
where formula_78 is the strain that is consistent with the specified displacement field. The 2nd to last equality comes from the fact that the stress matrix is symmetric and that the product of a skew matrix and a symmetric matrix is zero.

Now recap. We have shown through the above derivation that
formula_79

Move the 2nd term on the right hand side of the equation to the left:
formula_80

The physical interpretation of the above equation is, &quot;the External virtual work is equal to internal virtual work when equilibrated forces and stresses undergo unrelated but consistent displacements and strains&quot;.

For practical applications:

* In order to impose equilibrium on real stresses and forces, we use consistent virtual displacements and strains in the virtual work equation.
* In order to impose consistent displacements and strains, we use equilibriated virtual stresses and forces in the virtual work equation.

These two general scenarios give rise to two often stated variational principles. They are valid irrespective of material behaviour.

===Principle of virtual displacements===
Depending on the purpose, we may specialize the virtual work equation. For example, to derive the principle of virtual displacements in variational notations for supported bodies, we specify:

* Virtual displacements and strains as variations of the real displacements and strains using variational notation such as formula_81 and formula_82
* Virtual displacements be zero on the part of the surface that has prescribed displacements, and thus the work done by the reactions is zero. There remains only external surface forces on the part formula_83 that do work.

The virtual work equation then becomes the principle of virtual displacements:
This relation is equivalent to the set of equilibrium equations written for a differential element in the deformable body as well as of the stress boundary conditions on the part formula_83 of the surface. Conversely, () can be reached, albeit in a non-trivial manner, by starting with the differential equilibrium equations and the stress boundary conditions on formula_83, and proceeding in the manner similar to () and ().

Since virtual displacements are automatically compatible when they are expressed in terms of continuous, single-valued functions, we often mention only the need for consistency between strains and displacements. The virtual work principle is also valid for large real displacements; however, Eq.() would then be written using more complex measures of stresses and strains.

===Principle of virtual forces===
Here, we specify:

* Virtual forces and stresses as variations of the real forces and stresses.
* Virtual forces be zero on the part formula_83 of the surface that has prescribed forces, and thus only surface (reaction) forces on formula_87 (where displacements are prescribed) would do work.

The virtual work equation becomes the principle of virtual forces:
This relation is equivalent to the set of strain-compatibility equations as well as of the displacement boundary conditions on the part formula_87. It has another name: the principle of complementary virtual work.

==Alternative forms==
A specialization of the principle of virtual forces is the unit dummy force method, which is very useful for computing displacements in structural systems. According to D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle, inclusion of inertial forces as additional body forces will give the virtual work equation applicable to dynamical systems. More generalized principles can be derived by:

* allowing variations of all quantities.
* using Lagrange multipliers to impose boundary conditions and/or to relax the conditions specified in the two states.

These are described in some of the references.

Among the many energy principles in structural mechanics, the virtual work principle deserves a special place due to its generality that leads to powerful applications in structural analysis, solid mechanics, and finite element method in structural mechanics.

<text>Mungyeong Saejae () is a mountain pass in central South Korea. It lies on Joryeong Mountain between the main peak (1017 m) and Sinseon Peak (967 m). The pass itself rises to above sea level. Mungyeong Saejae connects Mungyeong City, North Gyeongsang province with Goesan County in North Chungcheong province. Water flowing down from the Mungyeong side of the pass eventually flows into the Nakdong River and meets the Sea of Japan at Busan. Runoff from the Goesan side eventually flows into the Han River, which passes through Seoul to meet the Yellow Sea at Incheon.

The pass is also known by the name Joryeong (). Both names literally mean &quot;bird pass,&quot; and probably signify &quot;a pass so high that even birds find the crossing difficult.&quot;

The pass is renowned as the only place where the old road between Seoul and Busan, the Great Yeongnam Road, still looks like it did in the Joseon Dynasty. On June 4, 1981, the area around the Mungyeong side of the pass was declared Mungyeong Saejae Provincial Park, which is now a significant tourist attraction. In addition to the pass and the surrounding scenery, the park boasts a museum and tourist hotel, along with a small village of businesses catering to the tourist trade.

During the Joseon period, Mungyeong Saejae played an important role as the gateway in and out of the Gyeongsang province. Scholars, traders and government officials from Gyeongsang had to go through the pass when going to or from Seoul. Three great gates which maintained control over the pass during that time still stand, although the only people who go through them now are tourists.

Mungyeong Saejae is the subject of at least one traditional Korean folksong in the &quot;arirang&quot; style.

<text>Widley is an area of the Greater Portsmouth conurbation in Hampshire, near Waterlooville and Purbrook. It is on the dip slope of the South Downs just north of the ridge called Portsdown Hill.

Widley is served by the A3(T), trunk road which runs from Portsmouth to London. The main A3 to London (at this point the A3(M) motorway) is very close by, making it commutable by road. Widley is served by Cosham or Havant rail stations.

==History==
The Norman manor of Widley was held by the De Port and St John families of Cosham, and later passed to the Earls of Albemarle. In 1293, Isabel countess of Albemarle died without heirs and the manor passed back to the St John family. Later it was in the ownership of the Clynton and Uvedale families although the latter lost the manor temporarily in 1605, when accused of recusancy. It stayed in their family until 1766, when it was sold, and then passed by sale rather than inheritance.

The original village of Widley stood approx 1 mile to the west of the current centre, around the site of the present Widley Farm. The settlement moved to be sited on the then newly built Cosham to Horndean turnpike road at the time of the building of the Portsdown forts and Christ Church, which was built as a place of worship for soldiers based in the forts.

The new church of St Mary Magdalen was built in 1849. Remains of the village&#x27;s former chapel can be found close to Widley Farm; members of Charles Dickens&#x27; family, including his younger brother Alfred, are buried in the graveyard.

==Governance==
Politically, the majority of Widley is part of Purbrook Ward of Havant Borough Council. However, a small strip to the south is part of the City of Portsmouth unitary authority and the most western parts (including Widley Farm) are in the Southwick and Widley civil parish of Winchester City Council.

In 1894 the civil parish was abolished to form Cosham. On 13 October 1921 Cosham parish was renamed &quot;Widley&quot;, on 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished and merged with Havant, part also went to form &quot;Southwick and Widley&quot;. In 1931 the parish had a population of 961. It is now in the unparished area of Havant and Waterloo.

Fresh water supply in Widley is supplied by Portsmouth Water. Waste water is serviced by Southern Water. The nearest post office is within the Crookhorn Precinct Co-op shop at 8 Purbrook Way, Crookhorn Ln. Others include Purbrook, situated within the Co-op shop at 31 London Road, Purbrook or Cosham Post Office at 13 High Street, Cosham. The nearest fire stations are Cosham (full-time station) and Waterlooville (part-time station).

<doc id="1212009" wikidata="Q1200755" url="?curid=1212009" title="Descriptive complexity theory">
<text>Descriptive complexity is a branch of computational complexity theory and of finite model theory that characterizes complexity classes by the type of logic needed to express the languages in them. For example, PH, the union of all complexity classes in the polynomial hierarchy, is precisely the class of languages expressible by statements of second-order logic. This connection between complexity and the logic of finite structures allows results to be transferred easily from one area to the other, facilitating new proof methods and providing additional evidence that the main complexity classes are somehow &quot;natural&quot; and not tied to the specific abstract machines used to define them.

Specifically, each logical system produces a set of queries expressible in it. The queries – when restricted to finite structures – correspond to the computational problems of traditional complexity theory.

The first main result of descriptive complexity was Fagin&#x27;s theorem, shown by Ronald Fagin in 1974. It established that NP is precisely the set of languages expressible by sentences of existential second-order logic; that is, second-order logic excluding universal quantification over relations, functions, and subsets. Many other classes were later characterized in such a manner.

==The setting==

When we use the logic formalism to describe a computational problem, the input is a finite structure, and the elements of that structure are the domain of discourse. Usually the input is either a string (of bits or over an alphabet) and the elements of the logical structure represent positions of the string, or the input is a graph and the elements of the logical structure represent its vertices. The length of the input will be measured by the size of the respective structure.
Whatever the structure is, we can assume that there are relations that can be tested, for example &quot;formula_1 is true if and only if there is an edge from to &quot; (in case of the structure being a graph), or &quot;formula_2 is true if and only if the th letter of the string is 1.&quot; These relations are the predicates for the first-order logic system. We also have constants, which are special elements of the respective structure, for example if we want to check reachability in a graph, we will have to choose two constants &quot;s&quot; (start) and &quot;t&quot; (terminal).

In descriptive complexity theory we often assume that there is a total order over the elements and that we can check equality between elements. This lets us consider elements as numbers: the element represents the number if and only if there are formula_3 elements with formula_4. Thanks to this we also may have the primitive predicate &quot;bit&quot;, where formula_5 is true if only the th bit of the binary expansion of is 1. (We can replace addition and multiplication by ternary relations such that formula_6 is true if and only if formula_7 and formula_8 is true if and only if formula_9).

==Overview of characterisations of complexity classes==
If we restrict ourselves to ordered structures with a successor relation and basic arithmetical predicates, then we get the following characterisations:
* First-order logic defines the class AC0, the languages recognized by polynomial-size circuits of bounded depth, which equals the languages recognized by a concurrent random access machine in constant time.
* First-order logic augmented with symmetric or deterministic transitive closure operators yield L, problems solvable in logarithmic space.
* First-order logic with a transitive closure operator yields NL, the problems solvable in nondeterministic logarithmic space.
* First-order logic with a least fixed point operator gives P, the problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time.
* Existential second-order logic yields NP.
* Universal second-order logic (excluding existential second-order quantification) yields co-NP.
* Second-order logic corresponds to the polynomial hierarchy PH.
* Second-order logic with a transitive closure (commutative or not) yields PSPACE, the problems solvable in polynomial space.
* Second-order logic with a least fixed point operator gives EXPTIME, the problems solvable in exponential time. 
* HO, the complexity class defined by higher-order logic, is equal to ELEMENTARY

== Sub-polynomial time ==

=== FO without any operators ===

In circuit complexity, first-order logic with arbitrary predicates can be shown to be equal to AC0, the first class in the AC hierarchy. Indeed, there is a natural translation from FO&#x27;s symbols to nodes of circuits, with formula_10 being formula_11 and formula_12 of size . First-order logic in a signature with arithmetical predicates characterises the restriction of the AC0 family of circuits to those constructible in alternating logarithmic time. First-order logic in a signature with only the order relation corresponds to the set of star-free languages.

=== Transitive closure logic ===
First-order logic gains substantially in expressive power when it is augmented with an operator that computes the transitive closure of a binary relation. The resulting transitive closure logic is known to characterise non-deterministic logarithmic space (NL) on ordered structures. This was used by Immerman to show that NL is closed under complement (i. e. that NL = co-NL).

When restricting the transitive closure operator to deterministic transitive closure, the resulting logic exactly characterises logarithmic space on ordered structures.

=== Second-order Krom formulae ===
On structures that have a successor function, NL can also be characterised by second-order Krom formulae.

SO-Krom is the set of Boolean queries definable with second-order formulae in conjunctive normal form such that the first-order quantifiers are universal and the quantifier-free part of the formula is in Krom form, which means that the first-order formula is a conjunction of disjunctions, and in each &quot;disjunction&quot; there are at most two variables. Every second-order Krom formula is equivalent to an existential second-order Krom formula.

SO-Krom characterises NL on structures with a successor function.

== Polynomial time ==
On ordered structures, first-order least fixed-point logic captures PTIME:

=== First-order least fixed-point logic ===
FO[LFP] is the extension of first-order logic by a least fixed-point operator, which expresses the fixed-point of a monotone expression. This augments first-order logic with the ability to express recursion. The Immerman–Vardi theorem, shown independently by Immerman and Vardi, shows that FO[LFP] characterises PTIME on ordered structures.

As of 2022, it is still open whether there is a natural logic characterising PTIME on unordered structures.

The Abiteboul–Vianu theorem states that FO[LFP]=FO[PFP] on all structures if and only if FO[LFP]=FO[PFP]; hence if and only if P=PSPACE. This result has been extended to other fixpoints.

=== Second-order Horn formulae ===
In the presence of a successor function, PTIME can also be characterised by second-order Horn formulae.

SO-Horn is the set of Boolean queries definable with SO formulae in disjunctive normal form such that the first-order quantifiers are all universal and the quantifier-free part of the formula is in Horn form, which means that it is a big AND of OR, and in each &quot;OR&quot; every variable except possibly one are negated.

This class is equal to P on structures with a successor function.

Those formulae can be transformed to prenex formulas in existential second-order Horn logic.

== Non-deterministic polynomial time ==

=== Fagin&#x27;s theorem ===
Ronald Fagin&#x27;s 1974 proof that the complexity class NP was characterised exactly by those classes of structures axiomatizable in existential second-order logic was the starting point of descriptive complexity theory.

Since the complement of an existential formula is a universal formula, it follows immediately that co-NP is characterized by universal second-order logic.

SO, unrestricted second-order logic, is equal to the Polynomial hierarchy PH. More precisely, we have the following generalisation of Fagin&#x27;s theorem: The set of formulae in prenex normal form where existential and universal quantifiers of second order alternate &quot;k&quot; times characterise the &quot;k&quot;th level of the polynomial hierarchy.

Unlike most other characterisations of complexity classes, Fagin&#x27;s theorem and its generalisation do not presuppose a total ordering on the structures. This is because existential second-order logic is itself sufficiently expressive to refer to the possible total orders on a structure using second-order variables.

== Beyond NP ==

=== Partial fixed point is PSPACE ===
The class of all problems computable in polynomial space, PSPACE, can be characterised by augmenting first-order logic with a more expressive partial fixed-point operator.

Partial fixed-point logic, FO[PFP], is the extension of first-order logic with a partial fixed-point operator, which expresses the fixed-point of a formula if there is one and returns &#x27;false&#x27; otherwise.

Partial fixed-point logic characterises PSPACE on ordered structures.

=== Transitive closure is PSPACE ===
Second-order logic can be extended by a transitive closure operator in the same way as first-order logic, resulting in SO[TC]. The TC operator can now also take second-order variables as argument. SO[TC] characterises PSPACE. Since ordering can be referenced in second-order logic, this characterisation does not presuppose ordered structures.

==Elementary functions==
The time complexity class ELEMENTARY of elementary functions can be characterised by HO, the complexity class of structures that can be recognized by formulas of higher-order logic. Higher-order logic is an extension of first-order logic and second-order logic with higher-order quantifiers. There is a relation between the formula_13th order and non-deterministic algorithms the time of which is bounded by formula_14 levels of exponentials.

=== Definition ===
We define higher-order variables. A variable of order formula_15 has an arity formula_16 and represents any set of formula_16-tuples of elements of order formula_14. They are usually written in upper-case and with a natural number as exponent to indicate the order. Higher-order logic is the set of first-order formulae where we add quantification over higher-order variables; hence we will use the terms defined in the FO article without defining them again.

HOformula_19 is the set of formulae with variables of order at most formula_13. HOformula_21 is the subset of formulae of the form formula_22, where formula_23 is a quantifier and formula_24 means that formula_25 is a tuple of variable of order formula_13 with the same quantification. So HOformula_21 is the set of formulae with formula_28 alternations of quantifiers of order formula_13, beginning with formula_30, followed by a formula of order formula_14.

Using the standard notation of the tetration, formula_32 and formula_33. formula_34 with formula_13 times formula_36

=== Normal form ===
Every formula of order formula_13th is equivalent to a formula in prenex normal form, where we first write quantification over variable of formula_13th order and then a formula of order formula_14 in normal form.

=== Relation to complexity classes ===
HO is equal to the class ELEMENTARY of elementary functions. To be more precise, formula_40, meaning a tower of formula_41 2s, ending with formula_42, where formula_43 is a constant. A special case of this is that formula_44, which is exactly Fagin&#x27;s theorem. Using oracle machines in the polynomial hierarchy, formula_45

<text>R. Merfyn Jones CBE (born January 1948) is a Welsh historian and broadcaster, was vice-chancellor of Bangor University (2004 to 2010) and a governor of the BBC (2003 to 2006).

He grew up and still lives in Gwynedd, Wales.

== Academic career ==

Jones has specialized as an historian in modern and contemporary Welsh history, and has made several TV documentaries in this area. He has a particular interest is the history of the process of devolution (the establishing and development of the National Assembly for Wales) in Wales.

His books and articles include &quot;The North Wales Quarrymen 1874-1922&quot; (University of Wales Press, 1981), which was awarded the Welsh Arts Council prize for literature. This book provides an analysis of the economic importance of slate extraction to North Wales and also of the rise of trades unionism in the area (and covers the industrial dispute at Penrhyn Quarry of 1900–03).

He graduated at the University of Sussex and the University of Warwick. He lectured at the University of Wales, Swansea and was a lecturer, head of department and dean at the University of Liverpool.

=== Vice Chancellor of Bangor University ===

Jones joined the University of Wales, Bangor in 1990 as a senior lecturer in history. He became head of the School of Welsh History there in 1993 and was appointed to the chair in Welsh history in 1994. He then served as Dean of Arts and Social Sciences for two years before being appointed Pro-Vice Chancellor in 1998. He was acting vice-chancellor in 2003.

Jones was appointed as the sixth vice-chancellor of the University of Wales, Bangor in 2004. In September 2007 he oversaw the change in Bangor&#x27;s status, from a College of the University of Wales to a university in its own right, renamed as Bangor University. In his capacity as Vice-Chancellor, Jones was the Welsh Supernumerary Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford in the academic year 2004–05. Jones retired as Vice Chancellor in 2010.

=== First Chairman of Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol ===

Jones was appointed as the first Chair of Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (the National Welsh Language College). The Coleg, which launched on 1 April 2011, works with the Welsh universities to increase opportunities for students to study through the Welsh language; and is a major component of the Welsh Assembly Government&#x27;s strategy for higher education, &#x27;For our Future&#x27;.

== Broadcasting ==

Jones regularly broadcasts on the BBC and S4C. His broadcasts include broadcasts in the Welsh language.

In 2000, Jones presented a 13-part television series for S4C, entitled &quot;Cymru 2000.&quot; This was a history of 20th century Wales, which featured over 200 interviews with notable figures from Wales&#x27; recent history. He was also responsible for writing the book of the same name that accompanied the series. &quot;Cymru 2000&quot; received a BAFTA Cymru award in 2000 for &quot;outstanding contribution to history on television&quot;.

This was followed by several other television series, including &#x27;Y Streic Fawr&#x27;, &#x27;Llafur Gwlad&#x27; and &#x27;I&#x27;r Gad!&#x27;.

=== BBC Governor ===

On 1 January 2003, Jones was appointed to the Board of Governors of the BBC as BBC National Governor for Wales. He held that position until the end of 2006 when the BBC&#x27;s Board of Governors was dissolved and replaced by the BBC Trust.

Jones was a member of the nominations committee established to appoint the new Director General of the BBC. According to Greg Dyke (BBC director-general), Jones was one of the governors responsible for his departure after the Hutton report &#x27;exonerated&#x27; Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell from &#x27;sexing up&#x27;, exaggerating, the threat of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction [ref: Greg Dyke, Inside Story, p. 318]

== Chair of the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board ==

Jones was chair of the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, a local Health Board responsible for health services for around 694,000 people across north Wales. He took up his appointment on 1 April 2013. A report in 2013 by the Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and the Wales Audit Office found that leadership at the board was &quot;fundamentally compromised&quot; because the relationship between the chairman and chief executive had broken down. Following this report, Jones stood down as Chair of the Health Board; the Chief Executive, Mary Burrows, also resigned.

== Honours ==

Jones was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to higher education in Wales.

Jones is an Honorary Fellow of Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol in recognition of his contribution to Welsh medium higher education. In addition to his contribution as one of the most prominent historians of modern Wales, the Coleg also cites his achievements as Chairman of the Coleg: he &quot;played an integral part in establishing the Coleg as a national body. He emphasized particularly the principle that every academic discipline can be taught and debated through the medium of Welsh, a principle that is now central to the Coleg’s academic strategy.&quot;

In July 2016, Jones was made an Honorary Fellow of Bangor University for services to the university.

<doc id="1212015" wikidata="Q1088780" url="?curid=1212015" title="Final Doom">
<text>Final Doom is a 1996 first-person shooter video game developed by TeamTNT and published by id Software for MS-DOS. Macintosh computers, as well as for the PlayStation, although the latter featured a selection of levels from the game and from &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot;.

The third entry in id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot; franchise and the first to not be developed by id, &quot;Final Doom&quot; consists of two 32-level episodes (or megawads), &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot; and &quot;The Plutonia Experiment&quot;. Both megawads were created by members of the hobbyist group TeamTNT, with id Software purchasing the rights to &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot; just before its planned free release and &quot;The Plutonia Experiment&quot; being made specifically at the request of id Software by Dario and Milo Casali.

The story in both episodes take place after the events of &quot;Doom II&quot;.&quot;&quot; &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot; features a mostly new soundtrack interspersed with some tracks from &quot;Doom II&quot;, while the soundtrack for &quot;The Plutonia Experiment&quot; entirely consists of tracks from &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot;.

During August 2022, &quot;Final Doom&quot; was delisted from the Steam store, in an effort from id Software to consolidate their games&#x27; multiple releases and editions. Therefore, &quot;Final Doom&quot; was bundled into &quot;Doom II&quot; as a single listing, along with &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot; and &quot;No Rest for the Living&quot; expansion pack.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Final Doom&quot; plays identically to &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;, and even features the same weapons, items, and monsters. It is widely considered to be significantly more difficult than its predecessors &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II,&quot; with The Plutonia Experiment generally being considered more difficult than TNT Evilution.

The gameplay in the PlayStation version of &quot;Final Doom&quot; is nearly identical to that found in the PlayStation version of &quot;Doom&quot;, and, in addition, it was compatible with the PlayStation Mouse. Compared to the MS-DOS original, the PlayStation version&#x27;s overall difficulty was significantly reduced. Many of the harder levels were removed and those that remained often had enemies taken out (most noticeably the Cyberdemon being removed from the level &#x27;Baron&#x27;s Lair&#x27;). As in the original PlayStation version of &quot;Doom&quot;, many of the larger levels from the original MS-DOS versions of &quot;Final Doom&quot; and &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot; were removed, and both the Arch-vile and Spider Mastermind monsters were removed, due to technical constraints. This limited the PlayStation version to 30 levels in total. The more traditional rock tracks featured in &quot;Final Doom&quot; were replaced by a creepier ambient soundtrack by Aubrey Hodges, who later composed the music for &quot;Doom 64&quot; in 1997.

There are several noticeable alterations to the presentation of &quot;Final Doom&quot; in the PlayStation version compared to the computer versions. The simplistic title screens featured in the computer versions have been replaced by a more elaborate title screen that features the animated flame-filled sky texture from the original PlayStation version of &quot;Doom&quot;. Many of the levels&#x27; sky textures have been replaced by different ones; some levels&#x27; skies are replaced by sky textures seen in previous &quot;Doom&quot; games, whereas others now feature a new starry sky texture. Finally, most of the level layouts are simplified, similar to previous &quot;Doom&quot; console ports, and the frame rate of the game is often lower than it was in the first PlayStation &quot;Doom&quot; game.

==Plot==
===&quot;TNT: Evilution&quot;===
In &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot;, the UAC are once again intent on developing and experimenting with dimensional gateway technology. They set up a base on one of the moons of Jupiter, with a solid detachment of space marines for protection. The marines do their job well; when the first experimental gateway is opened, they annihilate the forces of Hell. Research continues with more confidence and all security measures turned at the gateway.

A few months later, the yearly supply ship comes ahead of schedule, and looks strange and unusually big on the radar. The lax radar operators decide that there is nothing to worry about. The personnel of the base go out to behold the terrible truth: it is a spaceship from Hell, built out of steel, stone, flesh, bone and corruption. The ship&#x27;s enormous gates open to unleash a rain of demons on the base. Quickly, the entire facility is overrun, and everyone is slain or zombified.

The main character, the nameless space marine (who was revealed to be the marine commander on the moon) has been away on a walk at that time and thus escapes death or zombification. After being attacked by an imp, he rushes back to the base where he sees the demonic spaceship still hovering above it and realizes what has happened. He then swears that he will avenge his slain troops and sets out to kill as many demons as possible.

In the end, the marine defeats the Icon of Sin and the game describes &quot;something rumbles in the distance. A blue light glows within the ruined skull of the demon-spitter.&quot;

===&quot;The Plutonia Experiment&quot;===
In &quot;The Plutonia Experiment&quot;, after Hell&#x27;s catastrophic invasion of Earth, the global governments decide to take measures against any possible future invasion, knowing that the powers of Hell still remained strong. The UAC is refounded under completely new management (the old trustees and stockholders were all dead anyway) and aims at developing tools that would prevent demonic invasions.

The scientists start working on a device known as the &quot;Quantum Accelerator&quot; that is intended to close invasion Gates and stop possible invasions. The experiments are carried out in a secret research complex, with a stationed detachment of marines. The work seems to be going well but the creatures from Outside have their attention drawn towards the new research. A Gate opens in the heart of the complex and unnatural horrors pour out. The Quantum Accelerator performs superbly: the Gate is quickly closed and the invasion is stopped. Research continues more boldly.

On the next day, a ring of 7 Gates opens and an even greater invasion begins. For one hour the Quantum Accelerators manage to close 6 of the Gates, but the Hellish army has become too numerous and too strong. The complex is overrun. Everyone is slain, or zombified. The last Gate of Hell remains open, guarded by a Gatekeeper: a powerful, enormous and ancient demon that has the power to open Dimensional Gates and control or protect them.

The government, frantic that the Quantum Accelerator will be destroyed or used against humanity, orders all marines to the site at once. The player, the nameless space marine, was on leave at the beach. He was also closest to the site and gets there first. There he discovers that there is much demonic activity (howling, chanting, machine sounds) within the complex; the Gatekeeper is obviously working on something, and his work would soon reach some awful climax. He also realizes that when the marines arrive, they would not be able to penetrate the heavily infested complex, despite the firepower and support they will have. The marine decides to enter the complex and stop the Gatekeeper alone.

==Development==
The original &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot; megawad was created by TeamTNT, a group of WAD-making hobbyists who were active on the &#x27;advanced &quot;Doom&quot; editing&#x27; mailing list. It was scheduled to be released online as a free download on October 25, 1995. However, just 5 hours before its release John Romero contacted the leader of TeamTNT, Ty Halderman, with an offer to acquire and sell the project as an official product.&quot; The 2-3 dozen core members of TeamTNT formed a legal entity and completed the sale to id Software a couple weeks later. GT Interactive secured worldwide rights to distribute the game in February 1996.

Brothers Dario and Milo Casali, who had contributed eight levels to &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot;, were assigned the task of creating what became &quot;The Plutonia Experiment&quot; after having sent an eight-level WAD they had created to American McGee and managing to impress him along with the rest of the id Software crew. They created 16 levels each for &quot;The Plutonia Experiment&quot; in four months time, and submitted them in January 1996. Unlike their contributions to &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot;, which were edited by id Software before the final release, no revisions were made to or requested for these 32 levels.

When asked post-release about reports that many players found the &quot;Plutonia&quot; levels too hard for them, Dario Casali stated that &quot;&quot;Plutonia&quot; was always meant for people who had finished &quot;Doom 2&quot; on hard and were looking for a new challenge. I always played through the level I had made on hard, and if I could beat it too easily, I made it harder, so it was a challenge for me.&quot;

==Reception==
Reviewing the PC version in &quot;GameSpot&quot;, Jim Varner argued that &quot;Final Doom&quot; is a waste of money, since it is essentially just a new set of level maps for &quot;Doom&quot;, and there were already thousands of such maps available to download for free on the internet.

While &quot;GamePro&quot; criticized that &quot;Final Doom&quot; has no new enemies or weapons, and that the PlayStation version includes only 30 levels as compared to the PC version&#x27;s 64, they were pleased with the &quot;huge, perplexing, and sometimes sadistic levels&quot; and the new scenery, and considered &quot;Doom&quot; still a compelling enough game that simply more of the same was enough to satisfy. &quot;&quot; gave it a score of 9/10, calling it &quot;essential&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; was less impressed, remarking that a side-by-side comparison with the PlayStation version of the original &quot;Doom&quot; reveals that &quot;Final Doom&quot; has a much lower frame rate, less precise control, and more visible seams in the textures. Three of the four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said they were tired of seeing ports of &quot;Doom&quot;, and that &quot;Final Doom&quot; was simply another such port with new level maps. They also said that the game engine had become severely outdated in the years since &quot;Doom&quot; was first released. Crispin Boyer was the one dissenting voice, expressing enthusiasm for the new level designs.

<text>Rear Admiral William Herman Brockman Jr. (November 18, 1904 – February 1, 1979) served in the United States Navy during World War II.

==Biography==
Brockman was born at Baltimore, Maryland. Enlisting in the Naval Reserve in 1922, he was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy a year later and graduated in 1927. Creed Burlingame, Eugene Lindsey, and John Thatch were some of his classmates. He specialized in submarines from 1929 onward and commanded the submarine rescue ship in 1938-39. 

Lieutenant Commander Brockman was commanding officer of during the June 1942 Battle of Midway and in subsequent operations, earning the Navy Cross with two gold stars for himself and the Presidential Unit Citation for his ship during this period.

After a year with the Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet, Brockman was a submarine division commander from September 1944 to December 1945, receiving promotion to the rank of captain in March 1945. He commanded until February 1946, then served in Seventh Fleet and Navy headquarters staff positions until retiring in November 1947. 

Promoted to rear admiral upon retirement, Brockman was active in business for many years thereafter.

Brockman died at Boca Raton, Florida, aged 74.

Admiral Brockman was a recipient of the Navy Cross with two gold stars, Silver Star, Navy Presidential Unit Citation, Second Nicaraguan Campaign Medal, American Defense Service Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and World War II Victory Medal.

== Navy Cross Citation ==
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Lieutenant Commander William Herman Brockman, Jr. (NSN: 0-61342), United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. NAUTILUS (SS-168), in the Battle of Midway. On 4 June 1942, Lieutenant Commander Brockman aggressively developed a contact with major enemy forces and doggedly pushed home a torpedo attack on a screened aircraft carrier against determined and repeated enemy counter measures by gunfire barrage, depth charging and bombing from the air. The attack culminated successfully and Lieutenant Commander Brockman is credited with closing and sinking of a 10,000 ton enemy aircraft carrier. His skill, determination, courage and fortitude were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Naval Service.

==In Popular Culture==

Brockman, credited as the commander of the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, appeared in Camel cigarette advertising in 1955.

Brockman was portrayed by James Carpinello in the 2019 film &quot;Midway&quot;.

<text>Lilian Pauline Neville-Jones, Baroness Neville-Jones (born 2 November 1939) is a British politician and former civil servant who served as Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) from 1993 to 1994. A member of the Conservative Party, she served on the National Security Council and was Minister of State for Security and Counter Terrorism at the Home Office from 2010 to 2011.

On 12 May 2010, Prime Minister David Cameron appointed her as Minister of State for Security and Counter Terrorism in the Home Office with a permanent position on the newly created National Security Council.

On 9 May 2011, the BBC reported that Neville-Jones had left her role as Security Minister at &quot;her own request&quot;; her security brief was taken over by James Brokenshire. She was then immediately appointed as &quot;Special Representative to Business on Cyber Security&quot;.

==Education==
Lady Neville-Jones was educated at Leeds Girls&#x27; High School and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford (Modern History).

==Career==

===Civil Service===
Neville-Jones was a career member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Diplomatic Service from 1963 to 1996, during which time she served in British Missions in Rhodesia, Singapore, Washington, DC and Bonn. Between 1977 and 1982 she was seconded to the European Commission where she worked as Deputy and then Chef de Cabinet to Commissioner Christopher Tugendhat.

From 1991 to 1994 she was Head of the Defence and Overseas Secretariat in the Cabinet Office and Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet. During 1993 and 1994 she was Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. From 1994, until her retirement, she was Political Director in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, in which capacity she led the British delegation to the Dayton negotiations on the Bosnia peace settlement. In 2003 the Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegović commented that during these negotiations she &quot;never tried to conceal her dislike for us&quot;.

Before she left the civil service, Neville-Jones was openly critical of the Foreign Office for passing her over for the post of ambassador to France.

=== Business dealings with Milosevic ===
In 1996, shortly after resigning from the Foreign Office, Neville-Jones and her former boss Douglas Hurd were hired by NatWest Markets, a British bank, to travel to Belgrade and negotiate a privatisation deal with Slobodan Milosevic for Serbia&#x27;s state telecoms industry.

The money from the deal revitalised Milosevic&#x27;s dictatorship and may have helped fund his later war in Kosovo. Neville-Jones and Hurd were extensively criticised for their decision to take part in the deal.

===BBC===
She was appointed a BBC governor in January 1998. Her final post was as chairman of the Governors&#x27; World Service Consultative Group. Neville-Jones was chairman of the Audit Committee from 1998 until standing down from that position in September 2004 and left the BBC on 31 December 2004.

===Defence===
From 2002 to 2005, Neville-Jones was non-executive chairman of the part Government-owned defence technology company QinetiQ, which was privatised for £1.3 billion in February 2006. She was chairman of the Information Assurance Advisory Council until 2007.

===Politics===

In January 2006 she joined one of the Conservative Party&#x27;s new &#x27;policy groups&#x27; on national security.

On 2 July 2007 her appointment as a working peer and Shadow Security Minister was announced. Her title was gazetted as &quot;Baroness Neville-Jones, of Hutton Roof in the County of Cumbria&quot; on 15 October 2007.

On 9 January 2009, Lady Neville-Jones warned that Israel&#x27;s ongoing war in the Gaza Strip would encourage revolutionary Islamism in Arab countries and Islamic terrorism beyond, and called for a revival of the Middle East peace process.

On 13 May 2010, she was appointed Minister of State for Security and Counter Terrorism in David Cameron&#x27;s Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government, and was also sworn of the Privy Council.

On 31 March 2011 she told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that Britain&#x27;s Muslim population needs to be persuaded by the Government that Britain is a single nation, and that they can&#x27;t just &quot;rub along together&quot; but must be persuaded that their long-term future lies in Britain. Neville-Jones later spoke out against &quot;internet hate preaching and jihadist rhetoric&quot;, arguing that the murder of Lee Rigby was likely to have been inspired by such material.

On 9 May 2011, Neville-Jones left her post as Minister of State for Security and Counter-Terrorism in the Home Office at her own request.

In November 2014, Neville-Jones presented a speech at the Halifax International Security Forum, which she prefaced with an op-ed in a Toronto newspaper. She wrote about the quantum technology revolution and related that the &quot;policy failure&quot; of the 2003 Iraq War was due to &quot;outdated intelligence, lack of ability to test agent information against other sources and misinterpretation of apparent battlefield evidence&quot;.

==Positions==
Neville-Jones is an honorary fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, and an honorary doctor of the University of London and the Open University. In August 2013, the Council on CyberSecurity announced that she had joined the organization&#x27;s Advisory Board. She is also an Advisory Board member at the Council on Geostrategy.
==Honours==
Appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1987 Birthday Honours, she was raised to Dame Commander (DCMG) in the 1995 New Year&#x27;s Honours. Neville-Jones also received the Légion d&#x27;honneur (Chevalier) in 2009. She was recognized as one of the BBC&#x27;s 100 women of 2013.

<doc id="1212024" wikidata="Q79895178" url="?curid=1212024" title="Clare in the Community">
<text>Clare in the Community is a British radio comedy series, broadcast on BBC Radio 4, starring Sally Phillips as Clare. It was adapted from the comic strip of the same name which appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, written by Harry Venning. The title is a play on words relating to care in the community.

Clare is a social worker who likes to sort out other people&#x27;s problems while ignoring her own. She is white, middle class and heterosexual, but does not like to be reminded of it. She is a control freak but both her personal and professional lives are out of control.

==TV pilot==

In 2002 ITV commissioned a sitcom based on Harry Venning&#x27;s comic strip. Two episodes were commissioned and a pilot episode, written by Venning and David Ramsden and starring Julia Sawalha in the title role, was produced by Tiger Aspect. The pilot was not picked up for a full series and has never been broadcast.

== Radio series ==

In 2004 a radio sitcom, co-written by David Ramsden and produced by Katie Tyrrell, was made for BBC Radio 4, starring Sally Phillips as Clare and Alex Lowe as her husband Brian. Repeats have also been broadcast on BBC7 (now Radio 4 Extra). Series 1 to 5 have been released on CD by BBC Audio. Series 6 was broadcast in 2010. Series 7 was broadcast in 2011. The first series won the Bronze Comedy Award at the 2005 Sony Radio Awards.

The series occasionally breaks the fourth wall, with references to (for instance) a comic strip in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s social-work supplement which (the somewhat humourless) Clare does not understand, an old schoolmate of Brian&#x27;s named Richard Lumsden who wanted to be an actor but was never heard of again, and Nina Conti (as Nali) being given the line &quot;It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m a ventriloquist.&quot; The final series in particular breaks the fourth wall in nearly every episode, with Clare and Brian trying to remember how old their son is now in the first episode (reflecting how his age fluctuates slightly in different series), Joanie believing (or realising) that she is trapped in a pre-scripted comedy series, &quot;comedienne and ventriloquist Nina Conti&quot; being a member on the panel of a (fictional) episode of &quot;Any Questions?&quot; that Clare and Mrs. Singh attend, and in the final episode, where Nali (played by Conti) is seemingly a terrorist holding Clare hostage, she comments, in each relevant voice, that she could just as easily be Maggie or various other characters that Conti has voiced over the course of the series.

Clare often brings home her work problems which is just one of the main reasons why her relationship with Brian struggles. They often attend couples-counselling classes. Clare not only wears the trousers in their relationship but her self-centred neglect of Brian stresses him out. He often talks to his libertine friend and fellow schoolteacher Simon about her.

Clare&#x27;s fellow social workers are often involved in her storylines. These include the rich yet unhygienic gay man Ray; Megan, Clare&#x27;s Scottish single mother-of-one former student. Helen, the laziest of the workers, is played by three actresses over the series; in series 6 team leader, Irene, a black woman, is replaced by Libby, &quot;an Aussie and a lesbo—and proud of both&quot;.

Although she has a son Clare leaves her child duties primarily to her husband Brian and Nali. Despite their child, both continue to argue and have problems in their relationship. In series 9 Clare leaves Brian only to return to him in the series finale after her love interest has shown little knowledge of who she is.

Simon Elmes called it &quot;an instant hit, capturing the PC tone of our times&quot;. &quot;The Stage&quot; reviewed series 8 positively, praising the first episode as &quot;a brilliant opener&quot;, and after the series finale calling it &quot;the best comedy on radio&quot; and Phillips &quot;the mistress of comic timing&quot;.

The twelfth series was trailed as the final series.
