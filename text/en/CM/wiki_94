<text>George Albert &quot;Georgie&quot; Jessel (April 3, 1898 – May 23, 1981) was an American actor, singer, songwriter, and film producer. He was famous in his lifetime as a multitalented comedic entertainer, achieving a level of recognition that transcended his limited roles in movies. He was widely known by his nickname, the &quot;Toastmaster General of the United States,&quot; for his frequent role as the master of ceremonies at political and entertainment gatherings. Jessel originated the title role in the stage production of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.

== Early years ==
Jessel was born to Jewish parents, Joseph and Charlotte &quot;Lottie&quot; (née Schwarz) Jessel, on 118th Street in Harlem, New York City. By age 10, he was appearing in vaudeville and on Broadway to support his family after the death of his father, who was a playwright.

His mother, who worked as a ticket seller at the Imperial Theater, helped him form The Imperial Trio, a harmony group of ushers to entertain patrons of the theater, with Walter Winchell and Jack Wiener, using the stage names Leonard, Lawrence and McKinley, in their early teens (such usher-singer groups were common). At age 11, he was a partner of Eddie Cantor in a kid sketch and performed with him on stage until he outgrew the role at age 16. He later partnered with Lou Edwards and then became a solo performer.

== Career ==

=== Vaudeville ===
His most famous comedy skit was called &quot;Hello Mama&quot; or &quot;Phone Call from Mama,&quot; which portrayed a one-sided telephone conversation. In 1919 he produced his own solo show, &quot;George Jessel&#x27;s Troubles&quot;.

Jessel co-wrote the lyrics for a hit tune, &quot;Oh How I Laugh When I Think How I Cried About You,&quot; and he performed in several successful comedy stage shows in the early 1920s. In 1921 he recorded a hit single, &quot;The Toastmaster.&quot; He sometimes appeared in blackface in his vaudeville shows.

=== Film and broadcasting ===
Jessel appeared in his first motion picture, the silent movie &quot;The Other Man&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1919). In 1924, he appeared in a brief comedy sketch in a short film made in the DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process.

In 1925, he emerged as one of the most popular leading men on Broadway with the starring role in the stage production of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. The success of the show prompted Warner Bros.—after their success with &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1926) with music and sound effects only—to adapt &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; as the first &quot;talkie&quot; with dialogue and to cast Jessel in the lead role. However, the studio refused his salary demands, so Jessel turned down the movie role, which was eventually played by Al Jolson. According to Jessel during an interview around 1980, Warner Bros. still owed Jessel money for earlier roles and lacked enough funds to produce this movie with a leading star. Jolson, the biographical inspiration for the movie, became the movie&#x27;s main financial backer.
Jessel&#x27;s next movie role was in &quot;Private Izzy Murphy&quot; (1926). Whereas Jolson&#x27;s film career skyrocketed after the 1927 release of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, Jessel remained in smaller movie roles, often intended for audiences fond of Jewish and other &quot;ethnic&quot; humor. He was elected to The Lambs Theatre Club in 1942.

In the mid-1940s, he began producing musicals for 20th Century Fox, producing 24 films in all in a career that lasted through the 1950s and 1960s. At the same time he became known as a host on the banquet circuit, famous for his good-natured wit aimed at his fellow celebrities. In 1946, he was one of the founding members of the California branch of the Friars Club. (A recording exists of an example of his &quot;blue&quot; work in front of a stag audience, although it was actually recorded at a roast hosted by the Friars&#x27; rival, the Masquers Club.) He also traveled widely overseas with the USO entertaining troops. As he grew older, he wrote eulogies for many of his contemporaries in Hollywood. He wrote three volumes of memoirs, &quot;So Help Me&quot; (1943), &quot;This Way, Miss&quot; (1955), and &quot;The World I Lived In&quot; (1975).

Jessel produced a number of Hollywood films, including &quot;The Dolly Sisters&quot; (1945), &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; (1947), &quot;Golden Girl&quot; (1951) and &quot;The I Don&#x27;t Care Girl&quot; (1953).

In the early 1950s, he performed on the radio in &quot;The George Jessel Show&quot;, which became a television series of the same name from 1953 to 1954.

He guest-starred on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Jimmy Durante Show&quot;. In 1968, he starred in &quot;Here Come the Stars&quot;, a syndicated variety show. However, his attempt to extend his career was undermined by a perception that his style of comedy was outdated, as well as by his outspoken support of the American entry into the Vietnam War and of conservative political causes. He often crossed the era&#x27;s stereotypical political lines with its support for the civil rights movement and criticism of racism and anti-Semitism. His outspoken political opinions were, at times, the source of scandal. 

In 1971, while being interviewed by Edwin Newman on &quot;The Today Show&quot; on NBC, he repeatedly referred to &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;Pravda&quot; (the house organ of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union), and the interview was cut short.

Later film roles included a cameo as himself in &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967), &quot;The Busy Body&quot; (1967) opposite Sid Caesar, and the controversial musical &quot;Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?&quot; (1969) directed by and starring Anthony Newley. He made additional cameos in other all-star films such as &quot;The Phynx&quot; (1970) and &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976).

== Personal life ==

In the 1930s, his personal life kept him in the public eye as much as his movies. On May 2, 1930, Jessel married Florence Courtney in Chicago. She divorced him on October 24, 1932, on the grounds of cruelty. On April 23, 1934, Jessel married silent movie star Norma Talmadge, causing a scandal because Talmadge was married at the time that they started their affair, and she obtained a Mexican divorce only ten days earlier. After their divorce on August 11, 1939, he caused another scandal by breaking into her house with a pistol and firing shots at her current lover. In 1940, he married a 16-year old showgirl, Lois Andrews, when he was 42. They had a daughter, Jerrilyn, before divorcing in 1942. In his 1975 autobiography, &quot;The World I Lived In&quot;, Jessel claimed he had affairs with actresses Pola Negri, Helen Morgan and Lupe Vélez.

In 1961, actress Joan Tyler filed a paternity suit against Jessel claiming he was the father of her daughter Christine. Jessel later admitted he was Christine&#x27;s father and settled the suit out of court. As part of the terms of the settlement, Jessel agreed to pay Tyler $500 a month in child support ().

In 1964, Jessel reportedly sexually groped an adult Shirley Temple. According to Temple, he invited her to his office under the guise of discussing a recent role. During their meeting, Jessel put an arm around Temple while taking off his pants. He then grabbed the 35 year-old Temple&#x27;s breasts. She fought off his attempts by kicking him in the groin.

== Death ==
On May 23, 1981, Jessel died of a heart attack at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center at the age of 83. He was interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

== Honors and awards ==
In 1969, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored him for his charity work by awarding him the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, a Special Academy Award. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, George Jessel has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1777 Vine Street in Los Angeles.

<doc id="1225112" wikidata="Q351216" url="?curid=1225112" title="Gear oil">
<text>Gear oil is a lubricant made specifically for transmissions, transfer cases, and differentials in automobiles, trucks, and other machinery. It has high viscosity and usually contains organosulfur compounds. Some modern automatic transaxles (integrated transmission and differential) do not use a heavy oil at all but lubricate with the lower-viscosity hydraulic fluid, which is available at pressure within the automatic transmission. Gear oils account for about 20% of the lubricant market.

Most lubricants for manual gearboxes and differentials contain extreme pressure (EP) additives and antiwear additives to cope with the sliding action of hypoid bevel gears. Typical additives include dithiocarbamate derivatives and sulfur-treated organic compounds (&quot;sulfurized hydrocarbons&quot;).
EP additives which contain phosphorus/sulfur compounds are corrosive to yellow metals such as the copper and/or brass used in bushings and synchronizers, unless properly buffered; the GL-1 class of gear oils does not contain any EP additives and thus used to be the choice in applications which contain parts made of yellow metals.

GL-5 is not necessarily backward-compatible in synchro-mesh transmissions which are designed for a GL-4 oil: GL-5 has a lower coefficient of friction due to the higher concentration of EP additives over GL-4, and thus such transmissions running on it cannot engage as effectively, unless a specialized friction modifier has been included within the oil&#x27;s additive package; synchro-mesh compatibility is usually explicitly stated and such oils are often known in the trade as TDL (Total Drive Line) oils.

==API ratings==
Gearbox oils are classified by the American Petroleum Institute using GL ratings. The higher an oil&#x27;s GL-rating, the more pressure can be sustained without any metal-to-metal contact taking place between transmission components. Separate differentials usually have higher pressure between metal parts than gearboxes and therefore need higher GL-rating. For example, most modern gearboxes require a GL-4 oil, and separate differentials (where fitted) require a GL-5 oil. 

While they take the same form, the viscosity grades for gear oils are on a different scale than the viscosity grades for an engine oil. The viscometrics for gear oils are standardized in SAE J306. Multigrade gear oils are becoming more common; while gear oil does not reach the temperatures of motor oil, it does warm up appreciably as the car is driven, due mostly to shear friction (with a small amount of heat conduction through the bellhousing from the engine block).

Fully synthetic gear oils are also used in many vehicles, and have a greater resistance to shear breakdown than mineral oils.

API Category GL-1 (inactive) designates the type of service characteristic of manual transmissions operating under such mild conditions of low unit pressures and minimum sliding velocities, that untreated oil may be used satisfactorily. Oxidation and rust inhibitors, defoamers and pour depressants may be used to improve the characteristics of lubricants intended for this service. Friction modifiers and extreme pressure additives shall not be used.

API Category GL-2 (inactive) designates the type of service characteristic of automotive type worm-gear axles operating under such conditions of load, temperature and sliding velocities, that lubricants satisfactory for API GL-1 service will not suffice.

API Category GL-3 (inactive) designates the type of service characteristic of manual transmissions and spiral-bevel axles operating under mild to moderate to severe conditions of speed and load. These service conditions require a lubricant having load-carrying capacities greater than those that will satisfy APL GL-1 service, but below the requirements of lubricants satisfying the API GL-4 service, with wide operation ranges and temperature differences in the vicinity of viscosity.

API Category GL-4 designates the type of service characteristic of spiral-bevel and hypoid gears in automotive axles operated under moderate speeds and loads. These oils may be used in selected manual transmission and transaxle applications.

API Category GL-5 designates the type of service characteristic of gears, particularly hypoids in automotive axles under high-speed and/or low-speed, high-torque conditions. Lubricants qualified under U.S. Military specification MIL-L-2105D (formerly MIL-L-2015C), MIL-PRF-2105E and SAE J2360 satisfy the requirements of the API GL-5 service designation.

API Category GL-6 (inactive) designates the type of service characteristic of gears designed with a very high pinion offset. Such designs typically require (gear) score protection in excess of that provided by API GL-5 gear oils. The original API GL-6 test equipment is obsolete.

API Category MT-1 designates lubricants intended for non-synchronized manual transmissions used in buses and heavy-duty trucks. Lubricants meeting API MT-1 provide protection against the combination of thermal degradation, component wear, and oil seal deterioration which is not provided by lubricants meeting only the requirements of API GL-4 and API GL-5.

MIL-PRF-2105E this specification released in 1995 combines the performance requirements of its predecessor (MIL-L-2105D) and API MT-1. MIL-PRF-2105E maintains all existing chemical/physical requirements, stationary axle test requirements, field test requirements and data review by the Lubricants Review Institute that were required under MIL-L-2105D. It also adds the stringent oil seal compatibility and thermal durability test requirements under API MT-1. MIL-PRF-2105E has been re-written as SAE Standard J2360.
SAE J2360 standard is a new global quality standard that defines a level of performance equivalent to that defined by MIL-PRF-2105E, a U.S. military standard for approval that was not available to oil blenders in all parts of the world. It includes all of the most recent axle and transmission testing requirements identified in API GL-5, API MT-1, and MIL-PRF-2105E including the need to demonstrate proof-of-performance through rigorous field testing.

<text>Daniel &quot;Chappie&quot; James Jr. (February 11, 1920 – February 25, 1978) was a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force who, in 1975, became the first African American to reach the rank of four-star general in the United States Armed Forces. Three years later, James was forced to retire prematurely due to heart issues, just weeks before he died of a heart attack.

James attended the famous Tuskegee Institute and instructed African American pilots during World War II. He flew combat missions during the Korean War and Vietnam War, and received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, two Air Force Distinguished Service Medals, two Legions of Merit, three Distinguished Flying Crosses, a Meritorious Service Medal, and fourteen Air Medals.

== Biography ==

===Early life and education===
Daniel James Jr. was born on February 11, 1920, to Daniel and Lillie Anna (Brown) James. Daniel James Sr. worked for the Pensacola city gas company, while his mother, Lillie Anna James, was a high school teacher who established a private school for her own and other Black children in Pensacola, Florida. His mother would continue to run the &quot;Lillie A James School&quot; until her death at the age of 82. James graduated from the Tuskegee Institute, a precursor to Tuskegee University, in 1942, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.

===Military career===
====World War II====
James continued civilian pilot training under the government-sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. He then enlisted in the Aviation Cadet Program of the United States Army Air Forces on January 18, 1943, receiving his commission as a second lieutenant and pilot wings at Tuskegee Army Airfield, Alabama, on July 28, 1943. He remained at Tuskegee as a civilian instructor pilot in the Army Air Corps later that July. Throughout the remainder of the war, James trained pilots for the all-Black 99th Pursuit Squadron.

After completing P-40 Warhawk training and then B-25 Mitchell training, James served as a B-25 pilot with the 617th Bomb Squadron of the 477th Bomb Group at Godman Army Airfield and then at Lockbourne Army Airfield from January 1944 until the end of the war.

While arrested for participating in the Freeman Field mutiny, James smuggled out press releases written by Coleman Young. James did not see combat himself until the Korean War.

While serving in Lockbourne, James next served as a P-47 Thunderbolt pilot with the 301st Fighter Squadron from July 1947 to October 1948, and then served as on the staff of the 332nd Air Base Group at Lockbourne from November 1948 to September 1949.

====Korean War====

In September 1949, James went to the Philippines as flight leader for the 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 18th Fighter Wing at Clark Field. In July 1950 he left for Korea, where he flew 101 combat missions in F-51 Mustang and F-80 aircraft. His combat missions were with the 67th Fighter Bomber Squadron, 12th Fighter Bomber Squadron, and 44th Fighter Bomber Squadron.

====After Korea====
James returned to the United States, and in July 1951 went to Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, as an all-weather jet fighter pilot with the 58th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, later becoming operations officer. In April 1953, he became commander of the 437th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, and assumed command of the 60th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in August 1955. While stationed at Otis, he received the Massachusetts Junior Chamber of Commerce 1954 award of &quot;Young Man of the Year&quot; for his outstanding community relations efforts. On August 15, 1954, he appeared as a contestant on the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; He graduated from the Air Command and Staff College in June 1957.

James next was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force as a staff officer in the Air Defense Division of the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. In July 1960 he was transferred to RAF Bentwaters in England, where he served successively as assistant director of operations and then director of operations, 81st Tactical Fighter Wing; commander, 92nd Tactical Fighter Squadron; and deputy commander for operations for the 81st Wing. In September 1964, James was transferred to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, where he was director of operations training and later deputy commander for operations for the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing.

====Vietnam War====
James went to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, in December 1966, as deputy commander for operations, 8th TFW. In June 1967, under Colonel Robin Olds, he was named wing vice commander when Col. Vermont Garrison completed his tour. Both in their mid-40s, they formed a legendary team nicknamed &quot;Blackman and Robin&quot;. James flew 78 combat missions into North Vietnam, many in the Hanoi/Haiphong area, and led a flight in the &quot;Operation Bolo&quot; MiG sweep in which seven Communist MiG-21s were destroyed, the highest total kill of any mission during the Vietnam War.

====After Vietnam====
He was named vice commander of the 33rd TFW at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in December 1967. While stationed at Eglin, the Florida State Jaycees named James as Florida&#x27;s &quot;Outstanding American of the Year&quot; for 1969, and he received the Jaycee Distinguished Service Award. He was transferred to Wheelus Air Base in the Libyan Arab Republic in August 1969 as Commander of the 7272nd Fighter Training Wing.

Following the coup engineered by radical Libyan officers, including Mohammar Qaddafi, James had a tense standoff with the militants in the late stages of turning Wheelus over to the Libyans. James was determined not to be pushed off the base early, but Qaddafi and his followers began pushing the Americans to see how far they could go and at one point &quot;ran a column of half-tracks through the base housing area at full speed&quot;. Following this escalation, James closed the gates of the base. Qaddafi arrived at the gate and while talking to James, moved his hand over to his pistol holster to which James replied: &quot;I told him to move his hand away. If he had pulled that gun, his hand would have never cleared the holster.&quot;

In March 1970 James was promoted to brigadier general and became Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs). James played a key role in rejecting the accuracy of a list of prisoners of war supplied by North Vietnam, despite widespread agreement within the U.S. government that it was in close accord with intelligence estimates. That rejection, in turn, bolstered the politically explosive myth that the communists deliberately were holding prisoners as hostages for some future leverage.

He was designated principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) in April 1973. On September 1, 1974, he assumed duty as vice commander of the Military Airlift Command (MAC), headquartered at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, as a Lieutenant General.

On September 1, 1975, James was promoted to the four-star rank of general (O-10), becoming the highest ranking African-American in the history of the United States military to that date. He was assigned as commander in chief of NORAD/ADCOM at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. In these dual capacities, he had operational command of all United States and Canadian strategic aerospace defense forces. On December 6, 1977, he assumed duty as special assistant to the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force.

James retired from the Air Force on February 1, 1978.

===Death===

James died of a heart attack on February 25, 1978, just two weeks after his 58th birthday and three weeks following his retirement from the Air Force. An earlier heart attack had forced his retirement.

He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, following a Funeral Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington DC.

He was survived by his wife, Dorothy Watkins James, their daughter, Danice Berry, and two sons, Daniel James III and Claude James. His wife Dorothy died in 2000 and is buried with him in Arlington.

==Personal life==
James met his wife Dorothy while he was at Tuskegee, and they were married on the campus on November 3, 1942. They had two sons and one daughter. General James&#x27;s son, Lieutenant General Daniel James III, also served in the United States Air Force as a fighter pilot and in the Texas Air National Guard. He served from 1995 to 2002 as the Adjutant General of the Texas National Guard (the first Black general to hold the post), and as Director of the Air National Guard from 2002 to 2006. In the summer of 2006, he retired from the Air Force at the rank of Lieutenant General after 38 years of total commissioned service, on active duty and as an Air Guardsman.

James appeared as a guest on the August 15, 1954 episode of the panel game show What&#x27;s My Line?

==Political positions==
James was widely known for his speeches on Americanism and patriotism, for which he was editorialized in numerous national and international publications.

Excerpts critical of the growing civil rights movement were read into the Congressional Record.

The statements by James in which he repudiated the most militant point of view endeared him to concerned whites, including President Johnson, who invited him to a White House reception. Immediately after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and as riots erupted in several areas across the country, James addressed a gathering of Air Force Association officers at which he declared that in spite of events and the resistance to progress, &quot;I&#x27;m not disgusted-I&#x27;m a citizen of the United States of America and I&#x27;m no second-class citizen either and no man here is, unless he thinks like one and reasons like one and performs like one. This is my country and I believe in her, and I will serve her, and I&#x27;ll contribute to her welfare whenever and however I can. If she has any ills, I&#x27;ll stand by her until in God&#x27;s given time, through her wisdom and her consideration for the welfare of the entire nation, she will put them right.&quot;

He was awarded the George Washington Freedom Foundation Medal in both 1967 and 1968. He received the Arnold Air Society Eugene M. Zuckert Award in 1970 for outstanding contributions to Air Force professionalism. His citation read &quot;... fighter pilot with a magnificent record, public speaker, and eloquent spokesman for the American Dream we so rarely achieve.&quot;

==Honors and awards==
General James&#x27; military awards include the following:

He was awarded honorary doctor of laws degrees from the University of West Florida in 1971; the University of Akron in 1973; Virginia State College in 1974; Delaware State College in 1975; and St. Louis University in 1976. He was named honorary national commander of the Arnold Air Society in 1971.

In 1993, James Jr. was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

In 2019, he was chosen as the Class Exemplar for the U.S. Air Force Academy Class of 2022.

In 2020, the Pensacola Bay Bridge was renamed the General Daniel &quot;Chappie&quot; James Jr. Bridge, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signing the bill designating the bridge&#x27;s name on June 2, 2020. Representative Alex Andrade and Senator Doug Broxson sponsored the successful initiatives in the Florida Legislature. The bridge connects larger Pensacola with Gulf Breeze and the beachfront community of Pensacola Beach.

<text>Toastmaster is a general term, prevalent in the United States in the mid-20th century, referring to a person in charge of the proceedings of a public speaking event. The toastmaster is typically charged with organization of the event, arranging the order of speakers, introducing one or more of the speakers, and keeping the event on schedule. Such meetings typically include civic events, service organization meetings, and banquets for various purposes.

==Description==
In meetings, a toastmaster typically addresses the audience from behind a dais or from a podium. At stage entertainment events, especially ones broadcast on live television, the toastmaster often takes the form of a master of ceremonies, introducing the entertainment acts. 

==History==
James Toole, father of actor John Lawrence Toole was possibly the first professional toastmaster during the 1840s in London. There are allusions to him in the press of the day. His obituary noted his &quot;stentorian voice, and the ability with which he kept very large companies in order&quot;.

William Kingsmith was the first to wear the red coat now associated with the London Society of Toastmasters, as he wanted to be distinguished from waitstaff and footmen. He was the public announcer at the 1908 London Olympic games, and presided over court functions at St. James&#x27;s Palace, ceremonies at the House of Commons and Royal Albert Hall.

A widely known person associated with this role was George Jessel, known in his lifetime as &quot;Toastmaster General of the United States&quot; (parodying the title Postmaster General of the United States).

==Role==
In service organizations and businesses, the role of toastmaster was a permanently assigned role, but often rotating among members. Toastmasters were largely expected to keep the event from becoming boring, and a cottage industry arose in the middle century to cater to the desire of businessmen and other leaders to overcome the fear of public speaking. Would-be toastmasters were typically counseled to use light humor, and to have anecdotes and epigrams handily memorized. Toastmasters International is an organization dedicated to helping people in public speaking and in fulfilling the role of toastmaster and leader.

Such was the importance of a toastmaster remaining sober in order to conduct events, he may have had a special cup, called the toastmaster&#x27;s glass, which, although of the same size and shape as others at the event, in fact was of much lower capacity due to an almost solid interior. Several such glasses are now displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

<text>Jay &quot;Bluejay&quot; Greenberg (born December 13, 1991) is an American composer and former child prodigy who entered the Juilliard School in 2002 at age 10.

==Life and work==
Greenberg was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He caught the attention of the American media through the sponsorship of Juilliard instructor Samuel Zyman during a CBS News &quot;60 Minutes&quot; broadcast on November 28, 2004, when Greenberg was 12, and again in November 2006. Zyman told &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;We are talking about a prodigy of the level of the greatest prodigies in history, when it comes to composition. I am talking about the likes of Mozart, and Mendelssohn, and Saint-Saëns.&quot;

Greenberg&#x27;s primary composition instructor was Samuel Adler.

He composes primarily on his computer using a music notation program and is mostly known for his work &quot;Overture to 9-11&quot; about the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, which was featured on PRI&#x27;s &quot;From the Top&quot;. On 9/11, he was living in Republic of Macedonia but has since returned to the United States. Neither his father, Robert Greenberg, a professor of Slavic languages at Yale University nor his Israeli-born mother have musical backgrounds, but Greenberg found himself attracted to music from an early age, having begun playing the cello when he was two years old.

Greenberg has said he hears the music performed inside his head, like many composers, and often several musical pieces simultaneously, and he is then able to simply notate what he has listened to, and rarely needs to make corrections to what he has notated.

The Sony Classical label released his first CD on August 15, 2006; it includes his Symphony No. 5 and String Quintet as performed by the London Symphony Orchestra under the direction of José Serebrier and by the Juilliard String Quartet with cellist Darrett Adkins respectively.

On October 28, 2007, Joshua Bell gave the premiere of Greenberg&#x27;s Violin Concerto at Carnegie Hall, performing with the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s.

The 2011 contemporary classical album Troika includes Jay Greenberg&#x27;s song &quot;I still keep mute&quot;, setting a poem by Vladimir Nabokov.

Greenberg&#x27;s works are published by G. Schirmer.

As of 2012 Greenberg was majoring in music at Peterhouse, Cambridge.

As of 2016 he was pursuing a DMus degree at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, under the supervision of Eve de Castro-Robinson.

==Compositions==
Greenberg&#x27;s compositions include the following:

===Orchestral===
*Symphony No. 5 (2005)
*&quot;Intelligent Life&quot; (2006)
*&quot;Skyline Dances - A Terpsichorean Couplet&quot; (2009) (commissioned by a consortium of youth orchestras)

<text>A limited war is one in which the belligerents do not expend all of the resources at their disposal, whether human, industrial, agricultural, military, natural, technological, or otherwise in a specific conflict. This may be to preserve those resources for other purposes, or because it might be more difficult for the participants to use all of an area&#x27;s resources rather than part of them. Limited war is the opposite concept to total war.

==Examples==

===American Indians===
Many American Indians practiced limited warfare or similar behaviors. Eastern groups at the time of contact with Europeans often would not kill all enemies but would capture many for adoption to replenish their own populations. That is related to mourning wars. The Aztec did flower wars to keep subordinate nations symbolically defeated and capture sacrificial victims, who were symbolically adopted. The wars left noncombatants and materials without risk of physical harm.

=== Crimean War ===
For the Crimean War, British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston decided to fight a limited war against Russia since waging a total war would have required massive reform of the armed forces.

=== Korean War ===
At the beginning of the Korean War, US President Harry S. Truman and General Douglas MacArthur strongly disagreed with each other. Truman believed in the containment of North Korea north of the 38th parallel. MacArthur pressed for the destroying and routing (rollback) of North Korea. The disagreement escalated to the end of MacArthur&#x27;s command and career after he had exasperated and frustrated Truman&#x27;s limited war policy. Truman gave the following reasons for the policy:
&quot;The Kremlin [Soviet Union] is trying, and has been trying for a long time, to drive a wedge between us and the other nations. It wants to see us isolated. It wants to see us distrusted. It wants to see us feared and hated by our allies. Our allies agree with us in the course we are following. They do not believe that we should take the initiative to widen the conflict in the Far East. If the United States were to widen the conflict, we might well have to go it alone... If we go it alone in Asia, we may destroy the unity of the free nations against aggression. Our European allies are nearer Russia than we are. They are in far greater danger... Going it alone brought the world to the disaster of World War II... I do not propose to strip this country of its allies in the face of Soviet danger. The path of collected security is our only sure defense against the dangers that threaten us.&quot;

=== Vietnam War ===
The concept of limited war was also used in the Vietnam War by the United States under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson as part of a strategy to contain the spread of communism without provoking a wider confrontation with the Soviet Union. Richard Barnet, who quit the State Department in 1963 after because he disagreed with Kennedy&#x27;s incremental Vietnam escalation, described his misgivings in 1968: &quot;The President had rejected major military intervention as a conscious policy, but he had set in force the bureaucratic momentum that would make it a certainty.&quot;

===War of Attrition===
The War of Attrition, fought between Israel and Egypt from 1967 to 1970, mostly consisted of artillery shelling, aerial warfare, and small-scale raids.

===Falklands War===
Often seen as a &quot;textbook example of a limited war - limited in time, in location, in objectives and in means,&quot; the Falklands War was fought over the course of 10 weeks and ended with just over 1000 casualties on both sides.

===NATO bombing of Yugoslavia===
The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, part of the Kosovo War, was a limited war for NATO, which predominantly used a large-scale air campaign to destroy Yugoslav military infrastructure from high altitudes.

===Second Sino Indian War===
The Second Sino-Indian War was fought in 1967 between China and India in the Sikkim sector of the Line of Actual Control. It is also known as the 1967 Nathu La and Cho La clashes.

<text>Teymur Bakhtiar (; 1914 – 12 August 1970) was an Iranian general and the founder and head of SAVAK from 1956 to 1961 when he was dismissed by the Shah. In 1970, SAVAK agents assassinated him in Iraq.

He was an asset in the British military network in Iran.

==Early life==
Bakhtiar was born in 1914 to Sardar Moazzam Bakhtiari, a chieftain of the eminent Bakhtiari tribe. He studied at a French school in Beirut (many Iranians were Francophiles at the time: e. g. Amir Abbas Hoveyda and General Hassan Pakravan) from 1928 to 1933, whereupon he was accepted to the renowned Saint-Cyr military academy. After returning to Iran, he graduated from Tehran&#x27;s Military Academy. His cousin, Shapour Bakhtiar, and he went together to both Beirut and Paris for higher education.

Then he was made a first lieutenant and dispatched to Zahedan. Bakhtiar&#x27;s first wife was Iran Khanom, the daughter of the Bakhtiari chieftain Sardar-e Zafar. Their daughter, Golnar, married Kambiz Yazdanpanah, the son of Morteza Yazdanpanah, in Tehran in 1960. At that time, the Bakhtiaris were extremely influential; Muhammad Reza Shah&#x27;s second wife, Soraya Esfandiary Bakhtiari, and the Shah&#x27;s last prime minister, Shapour Bakhtiar, were both related to Teymour Bakhtiar.

==Military career==
After World War II when the USSR refused to withdraw its troops from Iran, the separatist movement intensified in a number of regions of the country. In 1946, having received the relevant order of the Shah&#x27;s government, Teymur took part in pacifying the Khamseh region. He organized a kind of guerrilla struggle against soldiers of the Red Army and the separatist movement, as a result of which many separatist fighters were killed in clashes with pro-Shah forces. Suppressing the armed resistance of the nomadic Khamseh tribes, the government sent him as governor to Zahedan.

Bakhtiar rose rapidly in Iran&#x27;s military after the fall of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq in 1953. A close associate of Prime Minister Fazlollah Zahedi, he was promoted to military governor of Tehran. One of his first major successes was the capture and trial of Mossadeq&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs, Hossein Fatemi, who had actively fought the military government that succeeded Mossadegh&#x27;s period in office.

Bakhtiar waged an extensive campaign against the communist Tudeh party; he arrested and had 24 Tudeh leaders summarily tried and executed, including Khalil Tahmasebi, the assassin of former Prime Minister Ali Razmara. For these accomplishments, he was appointed modern Iran&#x27;s youngest three-star general in 1954.

From August 1953 to Autumn 1954, about 660 of the most ardent supporters of the ousted prime minister were arrested. Of these, 130 were former employees of the oil enterprises in Abadan. A significant part of the arrested officers were members of the Tudeh party. All those who escaped execution were sentenced to various years in prison. On 19 October 1954, the death sentence of the first group of officers from Tudeh was carried out. On 30 October, the second group of Tudeh officers consisting of 6 people were shot. On 8 November, the third group of 5 people were shot, and on 10 November, by the verdict of a military tribunal, Hossein Fatemi was executed. Before being executed, he was brutally tortured.

With the full support of the Shah&#x27;s court and the West, the new government brought down brutal repressions against members of the pro-Mossadegh and leftist organizations, figures known for their anti-monarchist views. The government managed to break almost all the military and political resistance of the opposition. Throughout 1953, minor scattered armed protests by opposition representatives against the military government continued. In the spring of 1954, ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani, publicist Seyyed Hossein Makki, and other opposition leaders made an attempt to organize mass protests against the Zahedi government. However, the demonstrations that began at their call did not lead to a change in the existing situation. By that time, the court and the government had become masters of the situation, having established full control over the army, police and gendarmerie, strengthening the Shah&#x27;s imperial guard.

==Head of SAVAK==
Bakhtiar was made head of the newly formed intelligence and security service SAVAK in February 1956. He ruthlessly crushed any opposition to the regime, including communists, socialists, and Islamists.

Under the General Bakhtiar, SAVAK turned into an effective secret agency of internal security to combat the enemies of the monarchical regime of the Pahlavi dynasty.

After Prime Minister Jafar Sharif-Emami was forced to resign in May 1961 due to ongoing demonstrations against large-scale rigging in the parliamentary elections, Teymur Bakhtiar hoped to become the new Prime Minister. Shah made a bet on Ali Amini. General Bakhtiar then contacted the US Embassy in order to enlist their support for a &quot;coup&quot; against Amini. A surprised American ambassador informed the Shah about Bakhtiar&#x27;s plans. Soon Bakhtiar was removed from his post as head of SAVAK and was sent abroad.

==Fall==
With the appointment of Ali Amini as prime minister in 1961, the Shah began to distrust Bakhtiar. Amini warned the Shah of Bakhtiar&#x27;s contacts with John F. Kennedy, and Bakhtiar was dismissed in 1961. Amini was a Kennedy supporter and was dismissed in 1962 partly because of the Shah&#x27;s growing distrust of Kennedy.

Initially from his self chosen exile in Geneva, Bakhtiar retaliated by establishing contacts with Iranian dissidents in Europe, Iraq, and Lebanon, using the contacts he had built during his time at SAVAK.

Bakhtiar arrived in Lebanon on 12 April 1968, and was arrested in May for &quot;arms smuggling&quot;. Lebanese officials then informed the Iranian embassy in Beirut. As Iranian courts harassed Bakhtiar on charges of high treason, the Iranian government asked the Lebanese government on 13 May to transfer Bakhtiar to Iranian judicial authorities. The Iranian request was based on the principle of cooperation between the judiciary and the Lebanese criminal code regarding extradition of criminals. But Bakhtiar managed to get out of prison and emigrate to Iraq. In 1969, the Iranian parliament passed a law under which Teymur Bakhtiar was deprived of all military ranks, and all his movable and immovable property were confiscated.

He met not only Ayatollah Khomeini but also Reza Radmanesh, the General Secretary of the Tudeh Party, and Mahmud Panahian, the &quot;War Minister&quot; of autonomy-seeking state Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government, that had emerged briefly after the Soviet forces withdrew from Iran, following World War II. The Shah issued a warrant for Bakhtiar&#x27;s arrest, but the general sought refuge in Iraq.

On 12 August 1970, during a hunting party, he was shot and killed by an Iranian Savak agent, feigning to be a sympathizer. As a cover for the plot, the assassin and a colleague had hijacked an Iranian passenger plane, forcing it to land in Baghdad. Disguised as dissidents of the Iranian government, the two assassins duped the Iraqi regime and gained access to Teymur Bakhtiar and his entourage. The truth behind these circumstances emerged only years later. Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi himself has been quoted as claiming the assassination a personal success. In an Interview with the French author and biographer, Gérard de Villiers, the Shah publicly made a statement to this effect.

Bahktiar&#x27;s would be assassin was a trusted person, living on the premises of Bakhtiar mansion in Baghdad and could have had the General assassinated at a much earlier time. However, the chances for escape were slim, as Teymur Bakhtiar was a VIP guest of the Iraqi government and was both watched and protected by Iraqi bodyguards.

Bakhtiar&#x27;s murder was investigated at the highest level. There was only one assassin. Once out hunting in the field, the assassin fired a shot at him with a pistol, hitting him in the shoulder, thus making Bakhtiar drop his rifle. Immediately, Bakhtiar&#x27;s Iraqi bodyguard attempted to shoot the assassin with an AK-47, but was shot in the forehead first. The general reached for his revolver with his left hand, but was shot 5 times in the torso and left hand by the assassin. Bakhtiar was taken to hospital and underwent surgery, but died shortly thereafter from massive internal bleeding.

The assassin quickly left the scene, heading towards the Iranian border. He fell unconscious several kilometers before reaching the border crossing, due to the heat. He was captured by an Iraqi border patrol and taken to Baghdad alive. His fate remains unknown. It is also not known where he obtained his small-arms training as well as the pistol used.

<text>CSS Drewry was a gunboat of the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War. This wooden gunboat had a foredeck protected by an iron V-shaped shield. Classed as a tender, she was attached to Flag Officer French Forrest&#x27;s James River Squadron sometime in 1863 with Master Lewis Parrish, CSN, in command.

In addition to transporting troops and other routine service, she took part in several engagements along the river prior to January 24, 1865, when, in Trent&#x27;s Reach, she was destroyed by two shots from a 100-pounder rifle in a battery of the 1st Connecticut Artillery. The second hit exploded her magazine as she assisted CSS &quot;Richmond&quot; to get afloat; all but two of her crew had reached safety before the explosion. The wreck of the CSS Drewry was found by Clive Cussler in 1985, buried under the silt in upper reach of the old channel tidal flat about two hundred yards from south shore.

== Commanders ==
The commanders of the CSS &quot;Drewry&quot; were:

* William Harwar Parker (May-fall 1862)
* Master Lewis Parrish (around October 1863-May 1864)
* Lieutenant William B. Hall (May 19-May 21, 1864)
* Lieutenant William H. Wall (June 1864-January 23, 1865)

<text>Bellesrad (Беллесрад) is a short name for the State Institution for Radiation Monitoring and Radiation Safety (Государственное учреждение радиационного контроля и радиационной безопасности «Беллесрад») of the Republic of Belarus. It is subordinated to the State Forestry Committee of the Council of Ministers of Republic of Belarus. It was created to address the impact of the Chernobyl disaster on Belarus.

The institution monitors and investigates radioactive contamination, usage and rehabilitation of vegetation resources. It also controls radioactive contamination of food products.

In particular, Bellesrad posts warning signs and gives safety recommendations about wild plants and animals, e.g., about mushroom picking. It also oversees the breeding and monitoring of cattle and other agricultural practices in the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve.

<text>or , roughly translated as &quot;angel&#x27;s double chin&quot;, is a traditional Portuguese dessert made chiefly from whipped egg yolks, baked and then boiled in sugar syrup.

Like &quot;fios de ovos&quot; and several other classical Portuguese sweets based on egg yolks, &quot;papo de anjo&quot; is believed to have been created by Portuguese nuns around the 14th or 15th centuries. Laundry was a common service performed by convents and monasteries, and their use of egg whites for &quot;starching&quot; clothes created a large surplus of yolks.

According to most recipes, the yolks must be whipped until they swell to double their original volume. Some recipes also call for egg whites (1--2 whites for each 10 yolks), beaten separately to stiff peaks consistency and gently mixed into the yolks. The mixture is then poured into greased muffin forms (about 1/2 tablespoon each) and baked until they are firm but still without crust. The pieces are then boiled lightly in the syrup, which may be flavored with rum, vanilla, or orange peel.

<doc id="1225171" wikidata="Q418744" url="?curid=1225171" title="Catenane">
<text>In macromolecular chemistry, a catenane () is a mechanically interlocked molecular architecture consisting of two or more interlocked macrocycles, i.e. a molecule containing two or more intertwined rings. The interlocked rings cannot be separated without breaking the covalent bonds of the macrocycles. They are conceptually related to other mechanically interlocked molecular architectures, such as rotaxanes, molecular knots or molecular Borromean rings. Recently the terminology &quot;mechanical bond&quot; has been coined that describes the connection between the macrocycles of a catenane. Catenanes have been synthesised in two different ways: statistical synthesis and template-directed synthesis.

== Synthesis ==
There are two primary approaches to the organic synthesis of catenanes. The first is to simply perform a ring-closing reaction with the hope that some of the rings will form around other rings giving the desired catenane product. This so-called &quot;statistical approach&quot; led to the first synthesis of a catenane; however, the method is highly inefficient, requiring high dilution of the &quot;closing&quot; ring and a large excess of the pre-formed ring, and is rarely used.

The second approach relies on supramolecular preorganization of the macrocyclic precursors utilizing hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic effect, or coulombic interactions. These non-covalent interactions offset some of the entropic cost of association and help position the components to form the desired catenane upon the final ring-closing. This &quot;template-directed&quot; approach, together with the use of high-pressure conditions, can provide yields of over 90%, thus improving the potential of catenanes for applications. An example of this approach used bis-bipyridinium salts which form strong complexes threaded through crown ether bis(&quot;para&quot;-phenylene)-34-crown-10.

Template directed syntheses are mostly performed under kinetic control, when the macrocyclization (catenation) reaction is irreversible. More recently, the groups of Sanders and Otto have shown that dynamic combinatorial approaches using reversible chemistry can be particularly successful in preparing new catenanes of unpredictable structure. The thermodynamically controlled synthesis provides an error correction mechanism; even if a macrocycle closes without forming a catenane it can re-open and yield the desired interlocked structure later. The approach also provides information on the affinity constants between different macrocycles thanks to the equilibrium between the individual components and the catenanes, allowing a titration-like experiment.

== Properties ==
The interlocked rings rotate with respect to one another. This motion can often be evaluated by NMR spectroscopy, among other methods. When molecular recognition motifs exist in the finished catenane (usually those that were used to synthesize the catenane), the catenane can have one or more thermodynamically preferred positions of the rings with respect to each other (recognition sites). In the case where one recognition site is a switchable moiety, a mechanical molecular switch results. When a catenane is synthesized by coordination of the macrocycles around a metal ion, then removal and re-insertion of the metal ion can switch the free motion of the rings on and off.

If there are more than one recognition sites, it is possible to observe distinct colors depending on the recognition site the ring occupies and thus it is possible to change the color of the catenane solution by changing the preferred recognition site. Switching between the two sites may be achieved by the use of chemical, electrochemical or even visible light based methods.

Catenanes have been synthesized with many functional units, including redox-active groups (e.g. viologen, TTF=tetrathiafulvalene), photoisomerizable groups (e.g. azobenzene), fluorescent groups and chiral groups. Some such units have been used to create molecular switches as described above, as well as for the fabrication of molecular electronic devices and molecular sensors.

==Families==

There are a number of distinct methods of holding the precursors together prior to the ultimate ring-closing reaction in a template-directed catenane synthesis. Each noncovalent approach to catenane formation results in what can be considered different families of catenanes.

Another family of catenanes are called pretzelanes or bridged [2]catenanes after their likeness to pretzels with a spacer linking the two macrocycles. In one such system one macrocycle is an electron deficient oligo Bis-bipyridinium ring and the other cycle is crown ether cyclophane based on para phenylene or naphthalene. X-ray diffraction shows that due to pi-pi interactions the aromatic group of the cyclophane is held firmly inside the pyridinium ring. A limited number of (rapidly interchanging) conformers exist for this type of compound.

In handcuff-shaped catenanes, two connected rings are threaded through the same ring. The bis-macrocycle (red) contains two phenanthroline units in a crown ether chain. The interlocking ring is self-assembled when two more phenanthroline units with alkene arms coordinate through a copper(I) complex followed by a metathesis ring closing step.

== Nomenclature ==
In catenane nomenclature, a number in square brackets precedes the word &quot;catenane&quot; in order to indicate how many rings are involved. Discrete catenanes up to a [7]catenane have been synthesised.

<text>The ABIT BP6 is an ATX motherboard released by ABIT in 1999. It was the first motherboard to allow the use of two unmodified Intel Celeron processors in dual symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) configuration. This combined with its overclocking capabilities made it a popular option among computer enthusiasts. The BP6 has been credited as the product that made multi-processor systems affordable for mainstream users, because prior to its release the expense of any multi-processor configuration made it a feature only to be considered for workstation-class systems.

The BP6 was based on the Intel Seattle 440BX chipset, consisting of the 82443BX Northbridge and the 82371AB Southbridge.

Processors that are supported by the BP6 in SMP configuration are the PPGA Socket 370 Celeron processors (300–533 MHz). Later Pentium III and Celeron Coppermine models can also operate on the BP6, albeit only in single processor configuration with the use of aftermarket socket adaptors. Intel never intended the Celeron to be able to operate in SMP, and later-generation Celeron processors had their SMP interface disabled, restricting the feature to the higher-end Pentium III and Xeon product lines.

The motherboard also features two extra HDD ports, one with the HPT366 Ultra DMA/66 adapter fitted on the mainboard itself. This allows up to eight IDE compatible drives to operate at the interface&#x27;s maximum speed.

The motherboard features &quot;ABIT SoftMenu&quot; BIOS extension which allow for jumper-less adjustment of system parameters such as system bus speed, CPU &amp; AGP bridge multipliers, voltages from inside the BIOS and PC-99 coloring.

The BP6, and many other of ABIT&#x27;s motherboards produced between 1999 and 2005, were victims of the capacitor plague.

<text>Performance art in China has grown since the 1970s as a response to the very traditional nature of Chinese state-run art schools. It has become more popular in spite of the fact that it is currently outlawed. In 1999, the importance of contemporary Chinese art was recognized by the inclusion of 19 contemporary Chinese artists in the Venice Biennale. In recent years, many of these artists have made performances specifically for photography or film. 

==Examples==
Some of the more extreme examples of Chinese performance art have become notorious in the West. In 2000, Zhu Yu, a painter and performance artist from Cheng Du, created a scandal by taking a number of photographs of himself, supposedly eating a fetus as a protest against state abortions as a means of population control. Peng Yu and Sun Yuan have also worked with human body parts as well as with live animals and are equally notorious. Some younger performance artists who have exhibited widely in the west in 2005-6 are Shu Yang, the organiser of the Dadao Live Art Festival in Beijing, Yang Zhichao, famous for having his identity card number branded on his back and Wang Chuyu who went on hunger strike as part of an exhibition called Fuck Off that took place in Shanghai in 2000 in opposition to the Shanghai Biennale. They acknowledge a debt to older performance artist and curator Ai Weiwei. Other well-known artists are Ma Liuming, Zhu Ming, and He Yunchang.

The 1996 film &quot;Frozen&quot; (Chinese title: Jidu Hanleng; 极度寒冷) by Chinese director Wang Xiaoshuai, made under the pseudonym Wu Ming, has as its protagonists a group of Chinese performance artists, who are shown engaging in several street performances in the film.

Examples of molecules for which there exist topoisomers include DNA, which can form knots, and catenanes. Each topoisomer of a given DNA molecule possesses a different linking number associated with it. DNA topoisomers can be interchanged by enzymes called topoisomerases. Using a topoisomerase along with an intercalator, topoisomers with different linking number may be separated on an agarose gel via gel electrophoresis.

<text>Gemma Frisius is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. It was named after Dutch physician Gemma Frisius. It lies to the north of the walled plain Maurolycus, and southeast of the smaller crater Poisson. The crater Goodacre is attached to the northeast rim.

The outer wall of this crater has been heavily damaged by impacts, particularly along the north and west sides. The smaller satellite craters D, G, and H are attached to this damaged crater. As some observers have noted, this crater formation bears a certain resemblance to a paw print with these craters forming three of the toes and the crater Goodacre the fourth.

The southeastern rim of the crater is also worn, and the inner wall has slumped nearly a third of the distance across the interior floor. The remainder of the floor is relatively level and deep, with a central peak that is offset to the northwest of the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gemma Frisius.

<text>Henry DeWolf &quot;Harry&quot; Smyth (; May 1, 1898September 11, 1986) was an American physicist, diplomat, and bureaucrat. He played a number of key roles in the early development of nuclear energy, as a participant in the Manhattan Project, a member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Educated at Princeton University and the University of Cambridge, he was a faculty member in Princeton&#x27;s Department of Physics from 1924 to 1966. He chaired the department from 1935 to 1949. His early research was on the ionization of gases, but his interests shifted toward nuclear physics beginning in the mid-1930s.

During World War II he was a member of the National Defense Research Committee&#x27;s Uranium Committee and a consultant on the Manhattan Project. He wrote the Manhattan Project&#x27;s first public official history, which came to be known as the Smyth Report.

On the AEC from 1949 to 1954, Smyth initially argued unsuccessfully against a crash course to develop the hydrogen bomb and in favor of international control of nuclear weapons, before switching to support of the weapon. Following the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing, Smyth was the sole member of the commission to vote against stripping J. Robert Oppenheimer&#x27;s security clearance. As IAEA ambassador from 1961 to 1970 he played an important role in the realization of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

He received the Atoms for Peace Award in 1968 and the U.S. State Department&#x27;s Distinguished Honor Award in 1970. The American Nuclear Society&#x27;s award for &quot;nuclear statesmanship&quot;, of which he was the first recipient, is named in his honor.

== Personal life ==
Smyth was born May 1, 1898, in Clinton, New York, to Ruth Anne Phelps and Charles Henry Smyth, Jr., a professor of geology at Hamilton College. Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, convinced Smyth &quot;père&quot; to join the faculty at Princeton, and in 1905 the family moved to Princeton, New Jersey.

Henry DeWolf Smyth&#x27;s elder brother, Charles Phelps Smyth, attended the same primary and secondary schools as Henry. The elder brother also received undergraduate and master&#x27;s degrees from Princeton, but in chemistry. He earned his PhD at Harvard University but like Henry and their father became a faculty member at Princeton. Both brothers served in the Chemical Warfare Service in World War I and on the Manhattan Project.

Henry DeWolf Smyth married Mary de Coningh on June 30, 1936. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

== Education ==

In Princeton, Smyth attended Miss Fine&#x27;s School, which later became the Princeton Day School, and the Lawrenceville School. After graduating from Lawrenceville in 1914, he entered Princeton University, where he received a classical education and graduated first in his class in 1918. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi.

Smyth remained at Princeton to do graduate work; he and Allen Shenstone were the only graduate students in the Department of Physics. Smyth earned a master&#x27;s degree and PhD in physics from Princeton in 1920 and 1921, respectively, studying under Karl Taylor Compton. The U.S. National Research Council awarded Smyth a fellowship, and he joined the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. There he studied under Ernest Rutherford and earned a second PhD in 1923. At Cambridge he was affiliated with Caius College and formed a friendship with Pyotr Kapitsa, a Soviet physicist who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics and work briefly on the Soviet atomic bomb project.

== Early career ==
During World War I, Smyth worked in the Chemical Warfare Service, and at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. After earning his second PhD, he returned to Princeton for the last year of his NRC fellowship. During his early years on the Princeton faculty he lived in the Graduate College west of the main campus. He was appointed an instructor in 1924, an assistant professor in 1925, an associate professor in 1929, and a full professor in 1936. In 1935 he became chairman of the Department of Physics, a position he held until 1949. During 1931–32 he was a Guggenheim Fellow at the University of Göttingen, where he studied the spectra of triatomic molecules, particularly carbon dioxide, with James Franck.

Smyth&#x27;s early research was in spectroscopy, focusing on ionization of gases by impact with electrons as a means to study the gases&#x27; critical energy levels. He published his first research article, on the radiating potentials of nitrogen gas, in 1919; this became the basis of his first dissertation. In a 1922 article, he described a method for determining the ionization energy of a molecule using anode rays and demonstrated the method on mercury vapor. In the following year he used this same method to study nitrogen. He also published on the ionization of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, water vapor, sulfur dioxide, and carbon disulfide. As Robert H. Dicke, Val Logsdon Fitch, and Rubby Sherr wrote in 1989, &quot;By 1935 his 30 published papers established him as a leading experimentalist&quot; in the field. In 1929 Kenneth Bainbridge completed his PhD dissertation at Princeton working under Smyth, using anode rays to search for element 87.

In the mid-1930s, Smyth began to shift his interest to nuclear physics, inspired by James Chadwick&#x27;s discovery of the neutron, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton splitting the atom, and Ernest Lawrence&#x27;s invention of the cyclotron. Three of his last research articles concerned detection of triatomic hydrogen and helium-3. His appointment as department chair forced him to devote more time to administrative work, at the expense of research. Richard Feynman had achieved an unprecedented perfect score on the Princeton University entrance exams, and applied for admission. While department chair, Smyth questioned his admission, writing to Philip M. Morse to ask: &quot;Is Feynman Jewish? We have no definite rule against Jews but like to keep their proportion in our department reasonably small&quot;. Morse conceded that Feynman was indeed Jewish, but reassured Smyth that Feynman&#x27;s &quot;physiognomy and manner, however, show no trace of this characteristic&quot;. As department chair, he had two cyclotrons built at Princeton, one in 1935 and the other in 1946.

He was a member of the subcommittee on physics of the National Research Council from 1928 to 1935. In 1936 Smyth responded to media criticism of basic science research as &quot;useless&quot; by suggesting that seemingly useless research could turn out to be very useful later.

== World War II ==

During World War II, Smyth was involved in helping the United States build the atomic bomb. From 1941 to 1943 he was a member of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)&#x27;s Uranium Committee charged with producing fissile material for the bomb. Smyth proposed the electromagnetic methods that were used to enrich the first large U-235 samples for the project. He also oversaw a nuclear fission-related project for the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). During 1943–45 he was a consultant to the Manhattan Project, which built and tested the weapon, and associate director of the University of Chicago&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory, which contributed to the Manhattan Project. At the Metallurgical Laboratory he headed research on heavy water. He remained chairman of Princeton&#x27;s physics department throughout the war, and the attendant obligations forced him to participate less actively in the project&#x27;s later stages.

In August 1944 General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, appointed Smyth to the Postwar Policy Committee, which was charged with proposing government policy for research and development of atomic energy after the war was over. The committee recommended that a national commission modeled on the OSRD fund and oversee continued production and fundamental research in government laboratories, universities, and the private sector.

=== Smyth Report ===

Smyth advocated within the NDRC for a comprehensive report to be released to the public following the weapon&#x27;s first use. Vannevar Bush, who as civilian director of the OSRD oversaw the NDRC, agreed, and selected Smyth to write the report following the recommendation of NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant. Groves granted Smyth unlimited access, waiving his usual security-minded insistence on compartmentalization. Smyth wrote what became known as the Smyth Report in his office in Princeton&#x27;s Palmer Laboratory, which later became the Frist Campus Center.

The report was first released to the press on August 12, 1945, days after the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Government Printing Office could not print enough copies to meet demand, so Smyth persuaded the director of the Princeton University Press to print more. By the end of the Press&#x27;s 1946 fiscal year it had printed 103,000 copies. Smyth held the copyright to the work to prevent others from claiming it, but he permitted widespread reproduction, essentially releasing it into the public domain. He later reported that &quot;my financial balance from the Smyth Report is minus two dollars, the copyright fee.&quot;

In the report, Smyth called it &quot;a semi-technical report which it is hoped men of science in this country can use to help their fellow citizens in reaching wise decisions&quot; in the new Atomic Age. At the urging of his superiors, he removed several discussions of the bomb&#x27;s moral implications and its creators&#x27; unease. Rebecca Schwartz argued that Smyth&#x27;s academic background and his report&#x27;s security-driven focus on physics at the expense of engineering caused the Smyth Report to promote a public perception of the Manhattan Project as primarily an achievement of physicists.

== Postwar ==

Following the war, Smyth returned full-time to his duties at Princeton. He continued to chair the Physics Department and was named the Joseph Henry Professor of Physics in 1946. During this time he spoke and wrote regularly about nuclear energy and science policy and worked to expand the physics department.

In early 1949, physicist Robert Bacher stepped down from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth to resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post.) Smyth was the commission&#x27;s only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress&#x27;s Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the hearings inquired into a small amount of uranium that was alleged to be unaccounted for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned the hearings as grounded in misconceptions about the work of nuclear scientists.

Following the Soviet Union&#x27;s successful atomic bomb test in August 1949, the United States was considering a crash course to develop a hydrogen bomb. The AEC&#x27;s nine-member General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended unanimously in October 1949 against such a course. Although Smyth did not think that committee&#x27;s report was well-constructed, he also initially opposed an H-bomb program. In early November he became one of three of the five AEC commissioners to take a stance in opposition. After looking at how the proposed weapon might be used and at what the domestic and international reaction would be to any use, Smyth felt that the H-bomb would be of little utility, and instead favored reopening discussions towards the international control of nuclear weapons.

But by late January 1950, Smyth&#x27;s position on the question was wavering towards being in favor of moving forward with development. In any case, on January 31, 1950, Truman decided to authorize a hydrogen bomb program. Smyth became a supporter of the weapon, and in February 1950, endorsed a specific program for the future production of H-bombs. In his autobiography, Smyth&#x27;s Princeton colleague John Archibald Wheeler recalled that Smyth recruited him to the hydrogen bomb project and expressed support for the project in response to the Soviet test. Indeed, by the time of that test Smyth was looking for ways to use a successful thermonuclear explosion&#x27;s psychological impact to benefit American foreign policy aims. Urged by a journal editor to publish his recollections of the H-bomb decision, Smyth drafted several attempts at an article but eventually abandoned it. Nonetheless, in subsequent years Smyth became defensive about his shift in position on the hydrogen bomb, saying that he had maintained a consistent thought process regarding it and that once his questions about the utility of the weapon had been resolved, his conclusion about the question changed accordingly.

In 1953 Smyth and John A. Hall served as principal advisors to President Dwight Eisenhower in preparing his Atoms for Peace speech to the United Nations. The IAEA traces its origins to this speech.

The 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing consisted of a panel considering whether to rescind Oppenheimer&#x27;s security clearance on suspicion that he was disloyal or a security risk, with the result that the panel decided to do so. Smyth was still the only scientist on the commission. Despite his personal dislike of Oppenheimer and pressure from the commission&#x27;s new chairman, Lewis Strauss, in confirmation of the panel&#x27;s decision Smyth was the sole commissioner to vote against stripping Oppenheimer&#x27;s clearance on June 29, 1954. Smyth&#x27;s rationale for what McGeorge Bundy has called his &quot;lonely but powerful dissent&quot; was that the evidence against Oppenheimer was weak and even contrived and was easily outweighed by Oppenheimer&#x27;s contributions to U.S. nuclear weapons efforts. Smyth resigned from the AEC on September 30 of that year out of frustration with Strauss. Eulogizing Oppenheimer in 1967, Smyth said of Oppenheimer&#x27;s treatment, &quot;Such a wrong can never be righted; such a blot on our history never erased... We regret that his great work for his country was repaid so shabbily&quot;.

Smyth returned to Princeton and served on several high-level administrative committees. This work included advising on the construction of a particle accelerator built jointly with the University of Pennsylvania and overseeing Project Matterhorn, which became the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. He chaired the committee that chose Robert F. Goheen to succeed Harold W. Dodds as President of Princeton. He also served as a consultant on nuclear power to Congress, the AEC, and private industry. He retired from Princeton in 1966.

Smyth was a fellow of the American Physical Society and served as its vice president in 1956 and its president in 1957. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1947 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1956. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

== IAEA representative ==
President John F. Kennedy appointed Smyth as the representative of the United States to the IAEA, a position with the rank of Ambassador. Smyth assumed the position on June 13, 1961, following confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Smyth shared the organization&#x27;s stated goal of developing nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. He helped develop what Glenn Seaborg later called &quot;an unprecedented atmosphere of rapport&quot; at the IAEA and played a crucial role in the adoption of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1970. He retired from the IAEA on August 31, 1970.

In September 1961, Harlan Cleveland, then Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, appointed Smyth to chair a committee to review U.S. policy toward the IAEA. The committee&#x27;s report affirmed the importance of civilian uses of nuclear energy. In 1962 Cleveland again tapped Smyth, this time as an adviser to the State Department on the IAEA. In this position Smyth advocated for a transfer of national nuclear safeguards to the IAEA.

In December 1965, Smyth was elected Chairman of the Board of the Universities Research Association. During Smyth&#x27;s tenure, the URA signed a contract with the U.S. government to construct and operate the National Accelerator Laboratory, which later became known as Fermilab. Construction began, and research programs were planned. Smyth stepped down as chairman in 1970 but remained on the board. He also served on the board of Associated Universities, Inc., which operated the Brookhaven National Laboratory and National Radio Astronomy Observatory.

Smyth received the Atoms for Peace Award in 1968 (with Sigvard Eklund and Abdus Salam) and the State Department&#x27;s Distinguished Honor Award in 1970. In 1972 he became the first recipient of an award for nuclear statesmanship given jointly by the American Nuclear Society and the Nuclear Energy Institute. By 1974, when the award was next given, it had been named the Henry DeWolf Smyth Nuclear Statesman Award.

== Later life and legacy ==
After retiring from the IAEA, Smyth remained active. On the 40th anniversary of the Trinity test in 1985, he denounced President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative and called for joint arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet Union.

He died September 11, 1986, in Princeton. The immediate cause was cardiac arrest, though he had long battled cancer.

Smyth endowed a chair in the Physics Department in his will. The sitting Henry DeWolf Smyth Professor of Physics is Suzanne Staggs.

The Smyth Report has remained the most significant release of technical details regarding atomic weapons ever made. Smyth was known for having a careful, judicious manner, and viewed less favorably people who he said became too &quot;emotional&quot; during a decision-making process. At Smyth&#x27;s memorial service, physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi spoke in praise of Smyth&#x27;s dissent in the Oppenheimer security hearings, saying that &quot;one thinks of a supreme moment in a person&#x27;s life when he stood against odds and did the right thing. That was Harry Smyth&#x27;s fortune and Harry Smyth&#x27;s greatness&quot;.

<text>Jacobi is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern highlands on the near side of the Moon. It lies southeast of the crater Lilius, with Cuvier to the north-northwest and Baco to the northeast. The crater is 68 kilometers in diameter and 3.3 kilometers in depth. It is from the Pre-Nectarian period, 4.55 to 3.92 billion years ago.

This crater has a worn rim that is overlain by several craters along the southern face, including Jacobi J, and a pair on the northern rim. The result is an outer rim that appears flattened along the northern and southern faces. The larger of the craters on the north rim, Jacobi O, forms a member of a chain of craters that form a rough line across the interior floor from northeast to southwest. The central part of this chain in particular forms a merger of several tiny craters at the midpoint of the floor. The remainder of the floor is level, perhaps as a result of erosion or deposited material.

The overlapping crater triplets of Jacobi F, Jacobi E, and Jacobi G form a line to the south of Jacobi crater. The crater was named after the 19th-century Prussian-Jewish mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi by the International Astronomical Union in 1935.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Jacobi.

<doc id="1225205" wikidata="Q1639897" url="?curid=1225205" title="Menards">
<text>Menard, Inc., doing business as Menards, ( ) is an American big-box home improvement retail chain headquartered in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. It is the third-largest home improvement retailer in the United States (behind Lowe&#x27;s and Home Depot), with 341 stores in 15 U.S. states, primarily in the Midwest. The chain is privately owned by founder John Menard Jr.

==Company history==

In 1958, John Menard Jr. began building post-frame buildings to finance his college education. By the end of 1959, he found it necessary to hire extra crews, and to purchase more pieces of equipment to keep up with demand. After graduating from the Wisconsin State College at Eau Claire (now University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire) in 1962, Menard purchased land in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and built an office and shop. The company was founded in 1960 and incorporated in 1962. The first Menards hardware store opened in 1964. By opening a truss plant in the late 1960s, Menards grew to produce more substantial building materials on-site. The truss plant evolved into the Menard Building Division, which produced steel siding and roofing, interior and exterior doors, decking and treated lumber, and other materials. Between the 1970s and 1980s Menards began opening locations in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. The company expanded into Nebraska in 1990, Illinois in 1991 and Indiana and Michigan in 1992. Menards sold the Menard Building Division in 1994, racking up 36 years in the pole building industry.

Menards was founded as Menard Cashway Lumber. In the mid-1980s, the &quot;Cashway Lumber&quot; name was dropped and the business became simply known to this day as Menards. In 2000, the company opened its 150th store. During the early and mid 2000s, Menards expanded into Ohio.

In 2007, Menards opened its third and fourth distribution centers in Holiday City, Ohio, and Shelby, Iowa, which are and , respectively. In 2008, the company expanded into Missouri. In 2009, Menards opened its first Wyoming location in Casper. Then it was followed by another location in Gillette and one more in Cheyenne. In 2011, the company expanded into Kansas. In 2012, Menards opened its first Kentucky location in Owensboro. Six more locations opened in Kentucky; one in Louisville, another in Paducah, another in Elizabethtown, another in Florence, another in Bowling Green, and the last one in Richmond.

In 2020, Menards expanded into West Virginia, opening four locations in that state: one in Wheeling, another in Morgantown, another in Huntington and the last one in Bridgeport. There will be a fifth Menards in West Virginia in Parkersburg, followed by a sixth location in Charleston.

A fifth manufacturing and distribution center in Ravenna, Ohio began construction in Spring 2022 after a two-year-long delay. The distribution center in Ravenna will supplement the chain&#x27;s expansion into Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. Menards announced in 2022 that it would open its first Pennsylvania location in Washington. A second Menards in Uniontown has been delayed.

==Groceries==

In 2007, the and larger Menards stores began selling groceries. At such locations, shoppers are able to purchase items such as frozen pizza, milk, eggs, common snacks, and a variety of canned items. In addition, these Menards locations carry items such as office supplies, pet supplies, and mattresses.

==Advertising==

Menards publishes weekly print ads and broadcasts TV and radio ads. Radio and TV ads are usually accompanied by banjo music (resembling that of bluegrass music) played by Gary Shaw of Wisconsin. Ray Szmanda was the &quot;Menards Guy&quot; who used the slogan &quot;Save big money at Menards&quot; regularly on television advertisements from 1976 to 1998, and occasionally from 1999 until his death in 2018. Before his return in 1999, Kim Larsen took over his position in his absence. During the Christmas and holiday season, radio and television ads typically feature an alternative jingle &quot;Warm season&#x27;s greetings to you all from Menards!&quot; sung by a female chorus beginning in 1986. The same year, the &quot;Helping You Build America’s Heartland&quot; jingle was made. Warren Lada, WLXR radio in LaCrosse, wrote the lyrics to the &quot;Save Big Money&quot; jingle in the early 1970s.

Spanish language commercials (whose music contains a mixture of mariachi and banjo sounds) end with &quot;¡Ahora mucho dinero en Menards!&quot;

===Auto racing===

John Menard got involved in Indycar racing in the early 1980s working with his neighbor, driver Herm Johnson. Menard eventually owned cars, primarily focusing on the Indianapolis 500 often using stock block Buick V6 engines. When Buick left the sport, Menard bought the engine tooling from Buick and began producing the engines under the Menard V6 name. Driver Scott Brayton won two consecutive Indy 500 poles for Menard, but was killed in a practice crash before the 1996 500. Tony Stewart got his first Indy 500 starts for Menard, and in 1992 Al Unser Sr. scored the highest Indy 500 finish for the team (3rd) and the highest ever 500 finish for the Buick/Menard V6 engine.
Menards has supported several racing drivers, including Paul Menard (John Menard&#x27;s son) who won his only NASCAR Cup race in the 2011 Brickyard 400 in a Menards sponsored Richard Childress Chevrolet; Robby Gordon; P. J. Jones; Brandon Jones; Matt Crafton; Simon Pagenaud, Ryan Blaney and Matt DiBenedetto. Menards began sponsoring Team Penske in 2016. Menards has also become the title sponsor of races in the Xfinity Series and as the entitlement sponsor for the ARCA Racing Series.

In 2023, the Menards and Matt Crafton sponsorship partnership surpassed STP and Richard Petty as NASCAR&#x27;s longest-tenured driver/sponsorship relationship.

== Industry rankings ==

In 2021, Menards ranked 26th on &quot;Forbes&quot;’ list of &quot;America&#x27;s Largest Private Companies&quot;, with an estimated revenue of US$11.8 billion. In 2022, Menards ranked 34th on the National Retail Federation&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Top Retailers&quot;.

In 2022, Menards ranked second in a J.D. Power survey in customer satisfaction among home improvement retail stores. Subsequently in J.D. Power&#x27;s 2024 survey, Menards ranked first, with the highest customer satisfaction of national home improvement retail stores.

In 2022, Menards ranked 28th on Forbes&#x27; list of &quot;America&#x27;s Largest Private Companies&quot; with an estimated revenue of US$13 billion.

== Controversies ==

According to &quot; Milwaukee Magazine&quot; in 2007, Menards was cited with more regulatory violations involving air/water pollution and hazardous waste disposal than any other company in Wisconsin. It also alleges that the company is strongly anti-union, to the point that it will not hire anyone who has ever worked in a union shop, even if they did so while in their teen years.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Michigan&#x27;s Attorney General Dana Nessel sent Menards a cease and desist letter citing 18 complaints from consumers in regards to price gouging on products such as face masks and bleach. &quot;Big box stores are not immune to the Michigan Consumer Protection Act or the Governor&#x27;s Executive Order&quot;, Nessel said. &quot;Large corporations must also play by the rules, and my office will work diligently to ensure this state&#x27;s consumers are treated fairly and not abused by businesses seeking to unlawfully jack prices up to line their pockets with profits at the expense of the public during this time of great need.&quot; Nessel said that Menards would have 10 days to respond to the letter, or she would potentially take legal action.

During the early stages of the pandemic, Menards instituted a policy that prohibited children under age 16 and non-service animals in stores, to the frustration of single parents who do not have other childcare options. The policy for children was later relaxed.

<doc id="1225206" wikidata="Q905005" url="?curid=1225206" title="Government of Free Vietnam">
<text>The Government of Free Vietnam (GFVN; ) was an anti-communist political organization that was established 30 April 1995 by Nguyen Hoang Dan. It was dissolved in 2013. It claimed to be an unrecognized government in exile of the Republic of Vietnam headquartered in the U.S. cities of Garden Grove, California, and Missouri City, Texas.

==Organization==

===Political goals===
The Government of Free Vietnam had stated a list of the political goals of its organization:

# The stated goal of the Provisional National Government of Vietnam is to achieve free and democratic elections in Vietnam. The government seeks to create an atmosphere of non-violent pressure on the Communist&#x27;s regime to allow for an election process whereby the people can choose whether or not to retain communism as the preferred system of governance.
# Provisional National Government of Vietnam has extolled before that achieving a fair and evenhanded oil policy for the benefit of the citizens of Vietnam and other businesses of the world can be achieved without violence and undeterred by the corrupt communist government practices.
# Free market ideas we wish to incorporate into the culture of Vietnam that helps all processes.
# A fair opportunity to use Vietnam&#x27;s national maritime oil resource and free waterways.
# A prevention of possible clashes of Vietnam&#x27;s neighboring countries due to illegal controls and restrictions. 
# The aggravated communist criminals must be brought to justice and that they must be ordered to pay for the consequences of their crimes, for the world to know and set examples for those tyrannical regimes against humanities.
# Prohibit all forms of provocation, and re-establish South Vietnam countrywide.
=== Economy ===
The GFVN had an approximate budget of US$1 million a year, donated by overseas Vietnamese anti-communists around the world..

==Base in Cambodia==
KC-702 was a military base that was operated by the Provisional Government of Free Vietnam, probably located in Cambodia, near the Vietnamese border. It is believed that this was once used to help plan the failed Vietnamese Embassy bombing in Laos. The current status of the camp is not known. However, in 1999 several members of the group were captured in Cambodia with weapons, deported to Vietnam and charged.

<doc id="1225209" wikidata="Q6052162" url="?curid=1225209" title="International Network of Crackers">
<text>International Network of Crackers (INC) was one of the premier cracking/releasing warez groups for the IBM PC during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The formation of INC was the result of the merger of several cracking groups, including &quot;Union&quot;, based out of Texas, and the &quot;Miami Cracking Machine&quot; (&quot;MCM&quot;), based out of Florida. The founder of MCM, who went under the pseudonym Line Noise, continued to manage INC until 1992. Following his departure from the group, Cool Hand and The Cracksmith took over. There were a few years in which the group seemed dominant over the &quot;warez&quot; scene. It was not until internal conflicts and lack of interest by upper management entered the picture that things began to decline. When Cool Hand and The Cracksmith disappeared, the remaining members were unable to hold things together.

The real identities of the key members have never been fully uncovered, but it has been reported that the founding members, Line Noise (Neil), The Cracksmith (Drew), and Cool Hand (Joe) have left the scene. Releases from INC aggressively declined and people within the scene generally had felt that INC lost its edge. During a one-year period, they went from being the top gaming software release group to barely memorable. Some of the best games of the 80s and 90s were released by INC during a period of stiff competition with groups like FLT, THG, and Razor 1911. By early 1994, INC had completely disappeared from the warez scene.

Among their biggest rivals and competitors during the group&#x27;s existence were The Humble Guys. During a period in which most groups were using any and all means possible (including credit card fraud, lies, and anything else) to beat them, INC always maintained its moral high ground. The worst INC ever did was to &quot;leak&quot; a new game to The Humble Guys so they could steal the credit. While unknown to THG - the game was infected with a trojan that searched for a modem then dialed 9-1-1. Several of The Humble Guys members were visited by the police before they discovered they had been fooled.

<text>WFIU (103.7 FM) is a public radio station broadcasting from Indiana University Bloomington (IUB) in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. The station is a member station of NPR, Public Radio International and American Public Media. Together with IUB-owned television station WTIU (channel 30), it is known as Indiana Public Media. Studios are located in the Radio-Television Building on the IUB campus, and the transmitter is located at a site on South Sare Road in Bloomington. Seven translators broadcast WFIU and its second HD Radio subchannel, primarily in areas outside of the main transmitter&#x27;s coverage area, including Terre Haute and Kokomo.

WFIU was established in 1950 and initially served as a training ground for IUB students. It moved to its present frequency in 1951 and was one of NPR&#x27;s charter members.

==History==

Indiana University had been producing radio programming since 1937, but it was not until 1942 that the university filed to established a radio station in the then-new FM service. The original application specified 42.9 MHz; after the FM band was changed to 88–108 MHz in 1945, IU amended its proposal to specify 91.9 MHz, in the noncommercial reserved portion of the new band, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the application on March 27, 1947.

WFIU began broadcasting on September 30, 1950. While its launch was a landmark for the university, it heralded problems for some television viewers. Local station WFBM-TV broadcast on channel 6, and its audio was at 87.75 MHz, close to WFIU&#x27;s frequency. Many early sets were not sensitive enough to prevent interference, resulting in viewers hearing WFIU while they watched WFBM-TV and a deluge of complaints to the university.

This problem would be solved by moving the station out of the reserved band. As it happened, there was an unused FM frequency in Bloomington. In June 1949, radio station WSUA had put WSUA-FM 103.7 on the air. However, its owners, three men from Louisville, Kentucky, were run out of business by the saturation of small Bloomington with three AM and one FM stations and a new newspaper all entering the market within the span of several years. They sold the physical plant and advertising contracts to Sarkes Tarzian, owner of station WTTS, and shut it down on January 5, 1950. In 1951, WFIU applied to move to 103.7 MHz; this was accepted.

The first studios of WFIU were a Quonset hut with a single hallway &quot;that went through it like a bowling alley&quot;, according to Dick Bishop, a student announcer from 1959 to 1961 who later served as the development director for WFIU and WTIU, the IUB television station started in 1968. It functioned as a &quot;laboratory station&quot;; students produced and announced many of the programs, which were of a &quot;local nature&quot;. One notable early WFIU product was sportscaster Dick Enberg. The Radio-Television Building on the IUB campus was completed in 1963, and the station began to take its modern direction with the launch of NPR in 1971; it was one of the initial 90 stations to carry &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. From 1960 until 1972, WFIU transmitted with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 75,000 watts from the center of the IU campus. At that time, it moved to the taller tower used by WTIU on the south side of Bloomington. The move increased WFIU&#x27;s range, even though the power was reduced to 29,000 watts.

The combined WFIU-WTIU news team has won numerous journalism awards including Emmy and Edward R. Murrow Awards for its local television, radio and web reporting in Indiana.

In 2008, WFIU began HD Radio broadcasts and started a secondary service, &quot;WFIU 2&quot;, which provides alternate public radio programs to complement WFIU&#x27;s output.

<doc id="1225214" wikidata="Q13635889" url="?curid=1225214" title="Herbs (band)">
<text>Herbs are a New Zealand reggae group founded in 1979 and led by singer-guitarist Dilworth Karaka, the only constant member. Since its foundation Herbs has been multi-ethnic in membership and featured Samoans, Tongans, Cook Islanders, New Zealand Europeans and Maori members. The 11th inductees into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame, were once described as &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s most soulful, heartfelt and consistent contemporary musical voice&quot;. It has been said their debut EP &quot;What&#x27;s Be Happen?&quot; &quot;set a standard for Pacific reggae which has arguably never been surpassed&quot;.

==Politics==
The band has always been political, with links to the Polynesian Panthers and the cover of &quot;Whats&#x27; Be Happen&quot; (released during the 1981 Springbok tour) being an aerial photo of police action at Bastion Point in 1978. As well as race relations, the band took a strong stance on nuclear weapons in the Pacific with &quot;French Letter&quot;.

==History==
Herbs produced a stream of reggae hits with some of the country&#x27;s top talent. In the 1980s and the first half of the &#x27;90s, Herbs had 10 top 20 singles hits. Herbs also worked alongside UB40, Taj Mahal, Billy Preston, Neil Sedaka, Tina Turner, Neil Young, George Benson, Joe Walsh, and Stevie Wonder.

Herbs&#x27; music is upbeat and clear in its messages. Their 1982 New Zealand hit &quot;French Letter&quot;, which spent 11 weeks on the charts, expressed New Zealand&#x27;s anti-nuclear stance. Fourteen years later, it was re-recorded to garner support for the prevention of nuclear testing at Mururoa. Similarly, &quot;No Nukes (The Second Letter)&quot;, &quot;Nuclear Waste&quot; and &quot;Light of the Pacific&quot; expressed much the same sentiment.

Herbs&#x27; third release and first full album &quot;Long Ago&quot;, which featured the 1984 single of the same name, was produced by well-known New Zealand bass player Billy Kristian. In 1986, former Be-Bop Deluxe bassist/vocalist Charlie Tumahai joined the group, having been a session musician for various international acts.

In 1986, &quot;Slice of Heaven&quot; with Dave Dobbyn reached number one on both the New Zealand and Australian charts. In 1989 they played on Tim Finn&#x27;s hit &quot;Parihaka&quot; and in 1992 Annie Crummer fronted the hit single &quot;See What Love Can Do&quot;.

Around this time the band forged into producing, providing instrumentation for Samoan singing sensation John Parker. The album titled &quot;Another Girl&quot; produced a local hit, a reggae-funk inspired cover of the Maori folk song &quot;E Papa&quot;.

In 1989, the band was assisted by Eagles member Joe Walsh, who produced, played slide guitar and sang on the band&#x27;s &quot;Homegrown&quot; album, which featured a cover of &quot;Walk Away Renee&quot;, originally recorded by The Left Banke. Walsh announced he had joined Herbs, but the union lasted less than a year. Walsh gives credit to the members taking him to &#x27;the ruins at Hawke&#x27;s Bay&#x27;, where he had &#x27;a moment of clarity&#x27; – for inspiring him to pursue sobriety.

They also provided two songs to the 1990 film, &quot;The Shrimp on the Barbie&quot;: A cover of the Peggy Lee song &quot;Mañana (Is Good Enough for Me)&quot; and &quot;Listen&quot;.

Herbs are considered pioneers of the Pacific reggae sound, having paved the way for contemporary New Zealand reggae groups such as Fat Freddy&#x27;s Drop, Katchafire, The Black Seeds, and Trinity Roots.

Although their last album of new material was released in 1990, Herbs still perform in New Zealand and Australia, with guitarist Dilworth Karaka the last remaining member of the original line-up that released &quot;Whats&#x27; Be Happen?&quot; in 1981. Of the 2013 line-up, Karaka, keyboardist Tama Lundon (joined 1983) and percussionist Thom Nepia (joined 1985) remain from the band&#x27;s late 1980s commercial peak.

&quot;Homegrown&quot; is featured on the soundtrack of &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;.

Tama Renata died in November 2018.

<text>Playfair is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southern highlands on the near side of the Moon. It was named after the Scottish geologist and mathematician John Playfair. It lies along the eastern rim of the eroded satellite crater Playfair G, a formation that is almost twice the diameter of Playfair itself. Playfair is nearly due north of the crater Apianus, and to the southwest of the Abenezra–Azophi crater pair.

This crater is oval in shape, being slightly wider along the east–west axis. The rim is somewhat eroded, and tiny craterlets lie along the south and west rims. The interior floor is level and nearly featureless, with the only feature of the minor interest being a pair of tiny craterlets lying just to the east of the midpoint.

Playfair is a crater of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Playfair.

<doc id="1225218" wikidata="Q4635013" url="?curid=1225218" title="32 Demands">
<text>The 32 Demands () were a list of proposals for governmental reform issued by the Committee to Settle the Monopoly Bureau Incident (also known as Settlement Committee, 228事件處理委員會 or People&#x27;s Purge Committee) during the February 28 Incident which occurred in Taiwan in 1947.

== Events surrounding the demands ==
During the first week or so following the general uprising against Republic of China government authorities under Chief Executive Chen Yi, most of Taiwan was under the control of native Taiwanese under the guidance of the Settlement Committee and ROC. Governmental authority was limited to a few government compounds and garrisons. The Settlement Committee was composed of legislators, high school and college students, lawyers, doctors, labor unions, as well as members of the general public. Moderates in the committee hoped to bring about reform in the corrupt provincial administration as opposed to general rebellion against the ROC Central Government in Nanjing. Others talked of Taiwan independence or becoming a U.S. protectorate. In Pingtung, a band of them sang The Star-Spangled Banner as they took over the town.

Following several days of deliberations, Taiwanese representatives from across the island delivered a list of 32 demands to the Office of the Chief Executive on the evening of March 7, 1947. Through the proposed reforms, they hoped to eliminate the rampant corruption in the existing administration and bring about democratic reforms. There was a sense of urgency during the deliberations as the representatives feared that if reinforcement troops from mainland China arrived before the demands were delivered and announced, Chief Executive Chen would be highly unlikely to accept them in what would be for him a loss of face.

These fears were well founded as shortly afterwards ROC troops arrived from the mainland on the morning of March 9. Chief Executive Chen then began what became a massive crackdown against the native Taiwanese. The representatives of the Settlement Committee, as well as intellectuals and students were especially targeted for liquidation in the ensuing slaughter.

== Brief summary and explanation of the 32 Demands ==

===Reforms for equality in government===
* Enactment of a Provincial Autonomy Law which will serve as the highest law on the provincial level.
* All government commissioners (ministers) must be confirmed by a democratically elected Council.
* Elections for Council seats must be held before June 1947.
* At least 2/3 of the commissioners must be from people who have resided in Taiwan for more than ten years.
* Protection for civil liberties as well as the right of workers to strike. Abolishes requirements for the registration of newspapers.
* Removal of laws requiring that all candidates for public office be members of the Kuomintang.
* Provides reform on laws governing the eligibility to run for public office.
* Abolishment of the Office of the Chief Executive, to be replaced by a Provincial Government.

One of the major problems following the handover had been the production of many conflicting and often contradictory laws, many of which were created at the whim of corrupt government officials in order to extort bribes. The enactment of a Provincial Autonomy Law was designed to get rid of this tangle of corruption. The Chief Executive&#x27;s Office especially was viewed to be extremely corrupt and undemocratic, as well as being subject to undue influence from the military.

Three of the 32 Demands were intended to prevent the installation of alleged carpetbaggers from the mainland to important government positions, as had been occurring since ROC administration of Taiwan began; as well as to prevent discrimination against residents of Taiwan prior to 1945

Critics charge that such a scheme would create two classes of people, in effect creating second-class citizens and result in something resembling apartheid.

Reforms on eligibility laws were intended to create a more egalitarian process. In previous elections, all candidates had to deal with numerous regulations designed to discourage persons undesirable to the KMT from running for office, such as hefty registration fees, civil service exams, and &quot;background checks&quot;.

===Reforms to insure civil and property rights===
* Popular election for all local government positions (i.e. mayors and magistrates), to be held before June 1947.
* Native Taiwanese were to be appointed as heads of police agencies, judges, and other members of the judicial system whenever possible.
* The civilian police are to be the only government agency with the power to arrest criminals.

All local officials up to this point were appointed by the Chief Executive, and as a result, were mostly mainlanders, sometimes accused of being &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;. Most of the criminal justice system had been packed by mainland appointees, most of whom allegedly were neither familiar with nor cared much for Taiwanese interests.

These reforms would also prevent the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.

===Economic reforms===
* Only income taxes, luxury taxes, and inheritance taxes shall be levied.
* Public enterprises will be headed by Taiwanese.
* Provide for a system of inspection of public enterprises and disposal of former Japanese properties.
* Abolition of the Monopoly Bureau and state run monopolies.

Prior to these reforms, many government officials charged high taxes on most services, allegedly amounting to little more than organized graft. Certain items such as salt, tobacco, liquor, and camphor were restricted to production and sale by the government, leading to inflated prices. It was a conflict between the Monopoly Bureau agents and a cigarette vendor which sparked the outbreak of the February 28 Incident.

===Military reforms===
* Military Police are restricted to arresting only military personnel.
* As many Taiwanese as possible shall be assigned to fill military posts on Taiwan.
* Abolition of the Taiwan Garrison Command to prevent abuse of military privilege.

The Taiwanese had allegedly little interest in participating in the ongoing Chinese Civil War, especially since Taiwan&#x27;s status at the time was still disputed by some. Troops from the mainland also had a reputation for being undisciplined and contemptuous towards Taiwanese.

===Social welfare reforms===
* Guarantee of the rights and privileges of the Taiwanese aborigines.
* Provides for workers&#x27; rights.
* Persons detained on charges of &quot;war crimes&quot; and &quot;treason&quot; are to be immediately released.

Many Taiwanese who were the targets of official extortion or had offended a corrupt government official were detained on vague charges of &quot;aiding the Japanese&quot; or treason.

===Secondary demands subject to compromise===
* Abolition of &quot;Vocational Guidance Camps&quot;.
* The Central Government must pay for the sugar exported to the mainland by the Executive Yuan.
* The Central Government must pay for 150,000 tons of food exported to the mainland.

Taiwanese employees of companies or the government were often ordered to participate in lengthy &quot;Vocational Guidance Camps&quot; which were allegedly designed to get them away from work long enough so that their jobs could be replaced by mainland Chinese.

The last demand was due to an incident where the Central Government had gratuitously confiscated a large shipment of Taiwanese sugar without, then sold it on the mainland for significant profit. Similar situations also occurred with Taiwanese rice leading to major shortages and artificial price inflation.

<text>The Humble Guys (THG) were a cracking group for the IBM PC during the late 1980s founded by two friends known by the pseudonyms Candyman and Fabulous Furlough. The group was also noticed in the demoscene for some of their cracktros.

THG was the first group to make use of the NFO file as a means for documenting their releases before packaging and distribution. The first release to contain an .NFO file was Nova Logic&#x27;s remake of the arcade classic Bubble Bobble in 1989. This has since spawned an entire generation of ASCII artists devoted solely to creating artwork for the purpose of decorating NFO files for warez groups. To put things into perspective, there are now entire websites explicitly devoted to the collection and archival of NFO files, such as The iSONEWS.

==Software contributions==

THG also was one of the first groups to release an &quot;intro tool&quot; for the IBM PC demoscene, released by their coding subsidiary, &quot;THG F/X&quot;, called the THG IntroMaker. The THG IntroMaker would allow one to create a self-contained executable program which played music and displayed graphics on screen without the need for any knowledge of computer programming. A much more advanced and highly sophisticated extension of this today would be Farbrausch&#x27;s &quot;.werkkzeug&quot;.

Prior to THG&#x27;s arrival on the warez scene the IBM world did not have anything other than text based intros usually quoting song lyrics. THG members brought the experience from the C64 and AMIGA warez scene bringing the first animated and graphical intros to the IBM scene.

In December 1991, the &quot;F/X division&quot; of The Humble Guys released a first and only copy of an electronic magazine called &quot;The Humble Review&quot; featuring game reviews and articles. Writer and weblogger Justin Hall would have his first article published in the Humble Review; a film review of Akira by &quot;Fusty&quot;.

Members of THG also had their own custom BBS software, originally a &quot;forum hack&quot;, called L.S.D. BBS (Lush Software Designs) which was first introduced on June 1, 1990, written by The Slavelord, Niteman and others. The original source code for this was Emulex/2, which was acquired by a THG member whose alias was Tripin Face. The source code was referred to as &#x27;Jani&#x27; in some communities at the time.

==In the news==
On the evening of October 27, 1992, NBC aired an episode about computer hackers on Dateline titled &quot;Are Your Secrets Safe?&quot;. This show prominently displayed ads for several warez BBSes, including one for The Slave Den BBS which was operated by a senior member and spokesperson of THG. As a result of this undesired exposure, The Slavelord voluntarily retired from his activities within the group.

On September 5, 2006, David J. Francis, known by his username &quot;Candyman&quot; died in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, of heart failure.

On October 4, 2015, Pierre Barkett, known by his username &quot;The PieMaN&quot; died in Florida of heart failure.

==Competition==

THG redefined the manner in which the PC warez scene worked when they entered the scene in 1989. Prior to THG, warez releases were haphazard, with multiple groups releasing the same title, usually after the title had been available in retail stores for weeks. Often games were released to BBSes without being cracked. THG changed this by releasing titles days before the software made it to retail chains such as Babbage&#x27;s. They did this by establishing relationships with the major wholesale software distributors, and ordering games with overnight shipping. For those cases where overnight shipping wasn&#x27;t enough, THG found people who lived near the software companies, who could go to the company, and buy the game the day it was released. This beat the overnight shipping method by 2 days in most cases. Also, an advantage that they possessed was that most other warez groups were run by teens, who attended school during the day. THG was run by professional men, who were available each day &quot;by 10:30&quot; when FedEx, or UPS delivered. The other groups had to &quot;wait until they got home&quot; in the afternoons. A decided advantage considering most &quot;cracks&quot; were done in less than an hour, and releases complete shortly thereafter.

THG had members who worked for morning TV shows. Software companies, ever eager for free advertising, would send a box of new, or in some cases &quot;about to be released&quot; software to a TV show, for just a simple phone call. They also understood the &quot;progression&quot; of software. Once a title was completed, the box, manual, and final version of the game were shipped to a &quot;duplication house&quot; to copy the software for sale in stores. THG had contacts in these duplication houses, where they could get the games weeks before they would show up at the store. Activision&#x27;s F-14 Tomcat was one such title, along with all titles from MicroProse.

At the height of their power, THG had game suppliers in the US (country wide), UK (Leeds), France, Germany, and many parts of Asia.

THG introduced the concept of couriers in an effort to plaster their releases on their competitors&#x27; BBSes. The couriers were often told to make sure that the various groups received the latest crack on their HQ&#x27;s BBS before other THG BBSes. The combination of using software wholesalers and couriers turned the PC Warez Scene upside down in 1990, but these are considered normal practice now. The fierce competition within the current warez and video scenes are directly descended from THG.

As a result, the majority of older, well established, warez groups disappeared from the scene. Of the four or five groups that were around prior to THG&#x27;s arrival in December 1989, the only group that remained was the International Network of Crackers (INC), which was one of THG&#x27;s greatest competitors in the IBM PC cracking scene. The file header of the executable THG cracktro, codice_1 (displayed above), contains text which reads: &quot;Cool Hand but fucks his dog and Phantom from INC&quot; (sic), an insulting reference towards the vice-president and courier coordinator of their rival organization, INC.

After Candyman shut down his BBS (Candyland, originally run on CNET BBS), setup, development, maintenance and unique customization were continued by The Maker who was on hand from day one. After Candyman left the United States, Fabulous Furlough took over the reins of the group. After political infighting among the remaining members of the group led to problems within the organization, several of the newer members of THG splintered off and formed a new group called USA (United Software Association) which included several noteworthy members such as, Niteman, Genesis and The Humble Babe (who changed her name to The Not So Humble Babe upon her departure from THG). USA released a few games, most of them coming from one of THG&#x27;s suppliers in Illinois, whom USA had managed to &quot;turn&quot;. After the bust of The Not So Humble Babe on credit card fraud charges in Michigan, USA teamed up with the European PC warez division of Fairlight and were cooperatively known as &quot;USA/FLT&quot;. This inevitably lead to the two groups USA and THG warring with each other

A year after the USA/FLT fiasco, several of the original members of The Humble Guys left the group in an effort to once again capture lightning in a bottle. However, by the fall of 1992 several other groups, such as Razor 1911, had joined the scene and this new group, while having some brief success, was never as successful as THG. The new group fell apart shortly after The Slavelord shut down his BBS after the Dateline story.

During 1992 though early 1994, many THG releases were cracked by the UK branch which consisted of Hi. T. Moonweed, Bryn Rogers and Hydro, who struggled to keep the group together due to US burnout. The UK BBSes, The Flying Teapot (known as active from 1991-1992) and The Demons Forge (ran by Hi.T and Bryn respectively) became the UK&#x27;s major landmarks.

By 1994, most of the founding members of The Humble Guys were no longer involved with the warez scene. After the Pits BBS in New York was shut down by Novell in 1995, the group moved to IRC and had a presence on many different servers with the name #THG. They focused on distribution rather than cracking. The Humble Guys disbanded in the early 2000s when the last founding member left.

<text>Poisson is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern highlands of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson. It lies to the east of the crater Aliacensis and northwest of Gemma Frisius. To the northwest of Poisson is Apianus.

This heavily eroded crater shares a common floor with the satellite crater Poisson T to the west-southwest, and the two craters have more or less merged into a single formation with a narrower neck in between. The rim of Poisson is heavily eroded, and is overlain by several craters. Poisson U is intruding into the southern rim at the junction of Poisson and Poisson T. A low-walled formation is joined to the northern rim at the opposite side of the neck from Poisson U.

The interior floor of Poisson and Poisson T has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, leaving a level surface within the inner walls. A pair of old, worn craters lies along the inner wall in the southeast part of the crater.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Poisson.

<doc id="1225230" wikidata="Q167126" url="?curid=1225230" title="Kobza">
<text>The kobza (), also called bandura () is a Ukrainian folk music instrument of the lute family (Hornbostel-Sachs classification number 321.321-5+6), a relative of the Central European mandora. The term &quot;kobza&quot; however, has also been applied to a number of other Eastern European instruments distinct from the Ukrainian kobza.

==Construction==
The Ukrainian kobza was a traditionally gut-strung, lute-like stringed musical instrument with a body hewn from a single block of wood. Instruments with a staved assembly also exist. The kobza has a medium-length neck which may or may not have tied-on frets, which were usually made of gut. It was single-strung (sometimes also double-strung) and the strings were played with fingertips or occasionally with a plectrum threaded through a ring placed on the middle finger.

==History==

The term kobza is of Turkic origin and is related to the terms kobyz and komuz, thought to have been introduced into the Ukrainian language in the 13th century with the migration of a sizable group of Turkic people from Abkhazia settling in the Poltava region. It was usually played by a bard or minstrel known as a &quot;kobzar&quot; (occasionally in earlier times a &quot;kobeznik&quot;), who accompanies his recitation of epic poetry called &quot;duma&quot; in Ukrainian.

The Kobza acquired widespread popularity in the 16th century, with the advent of the Hetmanate (Cossack state). From the 17th century, the term bandura was often used as a synonym for the kobza. The term bandura has a Latin pedigree and reflects the growing contacts the Ukrainian people had with Western Europe, particularly in the courts of the Polish gentry. Ukrainian musicians that found employment at various German courts in the 18th century were called &quot;pandoristen&quot;. One of these musicians, Timofiy Bilohradsky, was a lute student of Sylvius Leopold Weiss and later became a noted lute virtuoso, a court lutenist, active in Königsberg and St.Petersburg.

In the 18th century, the kobza&#x27;s upper range was extended with an addition of several unstopped treble strings, known as &quot;prystrunky&quot;, meaning: strings on the side, in a psaltery-like set-up. In the early 20th century the kobza went into disuse. Currently there is a revival of authentic folk kobza playing in Ukraine, due to the efforts of the &quot;Kobzar Guild&quot; in Kyiv and Kharkiv. The kobza revival however, is impeded by the absence of museum specimens: with the exceptions of a unique surviving 17th-century kobza at the Muzeum Narodowe in Kraków and a 19th-century kobza, which has been refurbished as a bandura, at the Museum of Theater and Cinematography, in Kyiv; almost all evidence is entirely iconographic and some photos from the 19th century.

==Etymology==

The term kobza first appeared in Polish chronicles dating back to 1331 AD. In popular parlance the term &quot;Kobza&quot; was applied to any regional lute-like instrument used by court musicians in Central-Eastern Europe. The term was occasionally used for other musical instruments of several unrelated types. The term &quot;kobza&quot; was also used in historical sources and folk songs as a synonym of bandura in the 19th and early 20th century in Ukraine. The term was occasionally used for the bagpipes and occasionally for the hurdy-gurdy in Eastern Poland, Belarus and the Volyn region in Ukraine.

The unfretted &quot;starosvitska&quot; bandura (a variant of gusli, developed ca. 1700 appropriated the bandura name, but was commonly referred to as a kobza, because of the name&#x27;s historical cachet while the Romanian kobza or cobza is a different type of plucked lute.

=== Other instruments known as kobza ===
The term &quot;kobza&quot; was also used as a synonym in historical sources for bandura in the 19th and early 20th century in Ukraine and was even used for bagpipes and occasionally for the hurdy-gurdy in Eastern Poland, Belarus and the Volyn region in Ukraine. Eventually, the unfretted &quot;starosvitska&quot; bandura (a variant of gusli, developed ca. 1800) appropriated the bandura name, but was commonly referred to as a kobza, because of the name&#x27;s historical cachet. The Romanian kobza or cobza is a different type of plucked lute.

== The modern Ukrainian kobza ==
There are currently two different approaches to kobza construction: authentic fretless reconstructions, produced by adherents for the recreation of authentic folk traditions, and modern stylised fretted instruments based on a modified domra design. To date, there have been no attempts to reconstruct earlier fretted kobza of the 18th century.

=== The fretless kobza ===
The term kobza was often used as a synonym for bandura and the terms were used interchangeably until the mid-20th century. The use of the term kobza pre-dates the first known use of the term bandura.

Similarly, a &quot;Kobzar&quot; is a Ukrainian Folk singer and musician who may play the kobza, but who might also play other instruments instead, including the bandura. The internationally known kobzar Ostap Veresay (1803–1890), is today considered the foremost kobza player of the 19th century despite the fact that he referred to his instrument as a bandura.

He was a representative of the playing tradition stopping the strings along the neck but without frets. Veresay&#x27;s instrument had six single unstopped strings mounted along the treble side of the instrument and six stoppable strings strung along the neck. The strings strung along the neck and side are plucked by the right hand with the left hand stopping the strings on the fingerboard.

After O. Veresay&#x27;s death in 1890 the instrument fell into disuse until its revival in the 1980s by Mykola Budnyk and exemplified by such players as Volodymyr Kushpet, Taras Kompanichenko, Eduard Drach, and Jurij Fedynskyj.

=== The modern fretted kobza ===

A fretted version of the kobza was used by Paul Konoplenko-Zaporozhetz, who recorded a disc of kobza music for Folkways. Konoplenko first picked up the fretted kobza before the Revolution in 1917 in Kyiv from Vasyl&#x27; Potapenko and played on this instrument after emigrating to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Konoplenko&#x27;s instrument had eight strings strung along the neck and four treble strings strung on the soundboard. The tuning used was reminiscent of the seven-string Russian guitar tuning (open G tuning).

Fretted kobzas were also developed by Mykola Prokopenko, who wrote a Ph.D. dissertation in 1976 on his efforts to reconstruct and resurrect the fretted Kobza. Prokopenko suggested that the four-stringed domra, an instrument widely taught in music schools in Ukraine but considered a Russian folk instrument but actually not used in Russia, be replaced by the fretted kobza. Although Prokopenko&#x27;s suggestion was not supported in 1976, it is currently being resurrected by musicians in Ukraine in the Academic folk instrument movement, particularly at the Kyiv Conservatory.

* Orchestral kobza, with four strings tuned in fifths using tunings that parallel those used by the instruments of the violin family. The instruments are made in &quot;prima&quot; (soprano), alto and tenor and contrabass sizes.
* Accompaniment kobza, usually having six or seven strings and a fretted neck. The six-string version uses standard guitar tuning. The seven-string version uses a Russian guitar (open G chord) tuning.

<text>The Grand River Event Center is a convention center located in Dubuque, Iowa. It is on the riverfront of the Mississippi River, and is part of the America&#x27;s River Campus at the Port of Dubuque. The center is located at 500 Bell Street.

Designed by Populous, the center has about 86,000 square feet (8,000 m2) of space for meetings, conferences, and other social functions. It is designed to accommodate groups ranging in size from 10 to 3,000. There are 12 flexible spaces that can be used for meetings and other functions. The most striking feature of the building is the &quot;River Room,&quot; a special glass-walled room that overlooks the Mississippi river. The building is connected by a skywalk to the Grand Harbor Resort &amp; Waterpark, which is adjacent to the events center. The center offers a number of services - such as high speed internet, catering, and underground parking.

During the 2004 Presidential campaign, President George W. Bush appeared in two campaign events that were held at the center.

<doc id="1225235" wikidata="Q1333078" url="?curid=1225235" title="Scoresby (crater)">
<text>Scoresby is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It is nearly attached to the crater Challis along the north-northwestern rim, and is located just to the north of the walled plain Meton. Due to its location, this crater appears highly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth, appearing elliptical in shape. It is, however, very nearly circular when seen from above.

This formation has a sharp-edged outer wall that has not been significantly worn and is not marked by impacts. It has an outer that extends outwards to nearly half a crater diameter, except where intersected by Challis in the north. The wide inner walls display an appearance of having been d, but these have been degraded by a multitude of lesser impacts over time.

Most of the inner floor of Scoresby is level and flat, except in the northeast where it is furrowed by some rough terrain. At the midpoint of the interior is a prominent central peak formation consisting of three mountainous ridges. There is a tiny craterlet just to the west of the central peaks, and a slightly larger craterlet along the northern interior wall.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Scoresby.

<doc id="1225237" wikidata="Q607621" url="?curid=1225237" title="Tokyo Marui">
<text> is a Japanese toy company located in Adachi, Tokyo, famous for manufacturing toy cars and pioneering the design of battery-powered airsoft guns. Their products are principally sold in Japan, but are also exported worldwide.

The company had its own center for airsoft sport called &quot;Tokyo Marui BB Sports Field&quot; which was operated during 2009 and 2010. Their guns have appeared in numerous movies and it has merchandising arrangements with many games. .

In the UK, Onlyairsoft is one of the largest airsoft importer of Tokyo Marui airsoft weapons. 

== Automatic electric guns ==
Tokyo Marui was the first company to introduce airsoft guns powered solely by electric motor gearbox-driven spring-piston assembly in 1992, which they called &quot;automatic electric gun&quot; (AEG). This compact air pump system was implemented in their first battery-powered automatic firing replica, the FAMAS F1. Other airsoft guns were then introduced. The 3-gear AEG design developed by Tokyo Marui is still in use today, and has been copied numerous times through the years by many other airsoft manufacturers.

Tokyo Marui&#x27;s airsoft replicas were made primarily from ABS plastic bodies, but also used metal parts where needed. Their more recent models, such as the Type 89 and AK-74M rifles have had full metal externals. The internal gearboxes of these guns are primarily powered by rechargeable batteries. A standard, unmodified Tokyo Marui gearbox will fire 0.20 g airsoft pellets at — around of muzzle energy – depending on the model. These gearboxes may be modified for higher performance with aftermarket parts, but Japanese law limits their power output to .

== Automatic electric pistols ==
Automatic electric pistols (AEP) run on 7.2V rechargeable batteries. These pistols and compact submachine guns are often more reliable than gas-powered replicas in cold weather. However, due to their lower voltage supplies and miniature gearboxes, they usually generate lower muzzle speeds (about 0.25 - .5J per BB, 25–50 m/s for 0.2g BB) and slightly slower rates of fire than replicas using a full-sized gearbox system.

Tokyo Marui makes the following automatic electric pistols:

* H&amp;K USP
* M93R
* Glock 18C
* MP7A1
* Škorpion vz. 61
* Beretta M9a1 
* Steyr Mannlicher TMP (cancelled)
* MAC-10
* H&amp;K P30
* Škorpion vz. 61

== AEG Boys series==
Tokyo Marui makes LPAEG replicas scaled down for use by children from the age of 10. They are powered by 6 AA batteries and have lower power than their 1:1 scale counterparts.
*H&amp;K MP5A5
*Colt M4A1 carbine
*H&amp;K G36C
*Colt M4 SOPMOD
*AK-47

==Electric blowback pistols==
Tokyo Marui&#x27;s electric blowback pistols (commonly referred to as EBBs) are powered by four AAA batteries and typically fire at with a 0.12 gram BB. Some models may be select fire, and most models have an additional grip safety that must be held in order for the pistol to fire, with the exception of the Combat Delta models that use the gun&#x27;s usual grip safety. The pistols feature a very weak blowback, and the slide usually only moves a third of the distance that it would on a typical GBB or real firearm.

==Gas blowback pistols==
Tokyo Marui Gas blowback pistols are designed to use HFC134A refrigerant to fire BBs and also to blow back the slide, mimicking the recoil of automatic hand guns. Refrigerant is sold in canisters similar to small propane canisters used in portable gas range. Propane based &quot;Green&quot; gas can be used, but could damage the replica due to higher pressure it exerts to mostly plastic parts used in gas blowback replicas, but many replicas have proven safe to use with propane or green gas.

==Gas Blowback Machine Guns==
Recently, Tokyo Marui has delved into the world of Gas Blowback Machine Guns. These replicas work very similarly to Tokyo Marui&#x27;s Gas Blowback Pistols, in that they use HFC134A refrigerant to blowback the bolt assembly to mimic the recoil of an automatic rifle or sub-machine gun when shooting the BBs.

Tokyo Marui has made gas powered replicas of these machine guns:

*Heckler &amp; Koch MP7|MP7A1
*Colt M4A1 MWS (Released in 2015)
*MTR16
*Howa Type 89 (released in 2017)
*Walther MPL (Discontinued shell-ejecting gas blowback sub-machine gun.)
*Heckler &amp; Koch MP5A3 (Discontinued shell-ejecting gas blowback sub-machine gun.)

==Bolt action air rifle==
These are bolt-action &quot;sniper&quot; rifles. Before each shot is fired, the shooter has to pull the bolt, cock the piston and load a BB into the chamber. All three versions of the VSR-10 share the same stock, same internals and same air chamber. The Pro-sniper version has a black stock, 430 mm long inner barrel and is the most accurate of the three versions. The Real Shock version has a metal weight in the piston to simulate recoil. Real Shock has a simulated wooden stock and the same 430 mm long inner barrel. However, due to the vibration caused by the heavier piston&#x27;s impact, Real Shock is the least accurate of the three, albeit only by less than an inch difference at 20 m distance. G-spec is shortened version with a silencer attached. Inner barrel is 303 mm long, but has a slightly tighter bore. Due to short inner barrel its accuracy is close to Real Shock, but a couple mm more accurate. A needle-like contraption called air brake protrudes from the piston. The air brake plugs the cylinder before piston impacts, trapping a small amount of air between the piston and cylinder. This reduces impact vibration and adds to VSR series&#x27; unique accuracy.

==Gindan Pistols==
Tokyo Marui makes a small series of semi-automatic guns that fire by compressing the spring and releasing it as the trigger is pulled. These are mostly marketed at children in various colors, but Tokyo Marui has released black and silver editions which come in more professional looking boxes. The barrels create a short range hop-up effect. Tokyo Marui only recommends that a special .12 g silver projectile of theirs be used, and that it be loaded with a proprietary speedloader which holds 90 projectiles.
*Glock 26
*Walther PPK

==Radio controlled models==

Tokyo Marui was also at the forefront of the developing radio control hobby in the mid-1980s with a line of high-quality 1/10-scale electric buggies, monster trucks and even an unusual NASCAR Winston Cup stocker, all in kit form. This kit of Bill Elliott&#x27;s Coors Melling Ford Thunderbird was built on a four-wheel drive buggy chassis; despite that full-scale NASCAR racers are rear-wheel drive. The body could be raised or lowered for either onroad or offroad use and two full sets of wheels and tires were included, pre-mounted sponge slick tires for onroad and knobby spiked rubber tires for offroad. The Big Bear Datsun, a 1/12-scale monster truck topped with a Datsun pickup truck body, powered by a Mabuchi RS-380 motor and initially sold via mail order, was one of the best-selling radio controlled models of the period and contributed greatly to the hobby&#x27;s growth.

Scale variations on the simple and strong Big Bear chassis included both regular and &quot;Super Wheelie&quot; versions of the Jeep CJ-7 Golden Eagle and Toyota FJ40 Land Cruiser, each lacking the oversized wheels and tires of the Big Bear and equipped instead with more scale-looking Goodyear offroad tires. A proposed third version which would have been Marui&#x27;s ninth release was that of a Mitsubishi Pajero, shelved due to licensing problems. Twelve models were released in all, numbered 1 through 13 since the aforementioned ninth model never made it to market.

Strong competition by the end of the decade, especially from Tamiya and Kyosho, caused Marui to pull out of the hobby-grade R/C market. They returned to the R/C market in 2000 with a still-popular line of ready-to-run, 1/24-scale military tanks (see below).

The company released and sold the following models:

*Hunter 2WD entry-level sport buggy
*Galaxy 2WD sport/mild competition buggy
*Galaxy RS 2WD sport buggy
*Shogun 4WD sport/mild competition buggy
*Samurai 4WD competition buggy
*Ninja 4WD competition buggy
*Coors Melling Ford Thunderbird 4WD NASCAR stock car
*Big Bear Datsun 2WD sport monster truck
*CJ-7 Golden Eagle 2WD sport offroad, available in regular and &quot;Super Wheelie&quot;
*Toyota Land Cruiser 2WD sport offroad, available in regular and &quot;Super Wheelie&quot;

== Radio controlled battle tanks ==
Tokyo Marui has combined remote control and airsoft by making a series of 1/24 scale remote controlled tanks that fire BBs. By remote control, a user may move the tank forwards and backwards, turn in place, rotate the turret, elevate the barrel, and fire. The range is only 25 m for 0.2g BBs. The tanks run on eight AA batteries.
*Leopard 2 A6
*Tiger I
*Tiger I Camouflage
*M1A2 Abrams
*Type 90 Tank JGSDF 71st Regiment

==Others==
Tokyo Marui has also in an attempt to compete with Tamiya manufactured 1:24 scale model cars, Mini 4WD of their own RC cars as well as licensed by other companies including Kyosho and educational models. The early nineties recession would force the company to scale back production to airsoft guns. Tokyo Marui has since returned to the RC car market, albeit the lucrative mini RC market with its 1:24 cars and also since 1994, builds remote driven Godzilla models. In 2007, Tokyo Marui released Z- scale model trains under the Pro-Z title including fully developed rail dioramas with several different trainsets. Recently, Tokyo Marui has entered the electric scooter market.

<text>CSS &quot;Columbia&quot; was an ironclad steamer ram in the Confederate States Navy and later in the United States Navy.

==As CSS &quot;Columbia&quot;==

&quot;Columbia&quot; was built at Charleston, South Carolina in 1864 to a design by John L. Porter. She was launched in March 1864 and entered service later in that year. When the Union forces took possession of Charleston on 18 February 1865, they found &quot;Columbia&quot; near Fort Moultrie; she had run on a sunken wreck and been damaged on 12 January 1865. The ironclad already had her cannon and some armor plating removed; ship-worms were already at work boring into her wooden hull.

==As USS &quot;Columbia&quot;==
She was raised on 26 April and was towed by to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she arrived on 25 May 1865. &quot;Columbia&quot; was drydocked on 5 June and repairs were begun, but on 15 June, she was decommissioned and placed in ordinary. Her hulk was later sold for scrapping on 10 October 1867.

<text>Zhiritskiy is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the south of the large walled plain Fermi, and northwest of the crater Schaeberle.

This crater lies across the western rim of the much larger satellite crater Zhiritskiy F, a circular, eroded formation. Zhiritskiy is slightly elongated, having a minor protrusion in its outer rim toward the east. A pair of tiny craterlets lies along the southern rim, and a small but notable crater lies near the midpoint. There is also a smaller crater along the base of the northern inner wall. The interior floor is somewhat irregular in form, especially in the eastern half where the crater overlies the rim of Zhiritskiy F.

The crater was named after Soviet rocketry scientist Georgiy S. Zhiritskiy by the IAU in 1970.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zhiritskiy.

<doc id="1225246" wikidata="Q1068878" url="?curid=1225246" title="Cheers (Obie Trice album)">
<text>Cheers is the debut studio album by American rapper Obie Trice. It was released on September 23, 2003 by Shady Records and Interscope Records. Eminem served as the executive producer for this album. This album serves as his first release from Shady Records since being signed in 2000. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA.

==Recording and production==
The album was recorded between 2002 and 2003, since being signed to Shady Records in 2000. The standard edition of the album consisted of seventeen tracks; Eminem served as executive producer and handled most of the audio production by himself. Additional audio production was provided by Denaun Porter, Dr. Dre, Emile, Fredwreck, Jeff Bass, Luis Resto, Mike Elizondo and Timbaland. The bonus tracks &quot;8 Miles&quot; and &quot;Synopsis&quot; had their audio production handled by DJ Green Lantern and DJ Muggs, respectively.
Featured artists on Cheers include Eminem, Nate Dogg, Timbaland, Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, D12 and Busta Rhymes.

==Content==
The title track celebrates Obie&#x27;s successful debut into the rap game after being in the Detroit underground for many years. Topics Obie has touched on this album include his life on the streets of Detroit, problems with his mother, relationships with women and the soulful reminder that, despite having made it into the mainstream, he has not forgotten his friends.

===Diss songs===
;&quot;Shit Hits the Fan&quot;
The track &quot;Shit Hits the Fan&quot; is a track which insults Ja Rule. Examples of disses from Dr. Dre in the track are: &quot;This little nigga, Ja Rule, Talking bout he&#x27;s gonna slap me, Nigga please, you gotta jump and swing up to hit me at the knees.&quot; At the end of the song, Obie spoke over the beat telling Ja Rule to, &quot;Go behind all the gangsta&#x27;s you want. Matter of fact get every gangsta from every hood in the United States of America to back you. Ain&#x27;t nobody reppin&#x27; with you, you can&#x27;t see that?&quot; This was intended to mock Ja Rule&#x27;s street credibility, declaring that no one was backing him again and that he &quot;fell off.&quot;

;&quot;We All Die One Day&quot;
The track &quot;We All Die One Day&quot; is a diss to Benzino and The Source. Examples from Lloyd Banks include a subliminal shot at Ja Rule and Irv Gotti like, &#x27;Your boss and your captain soft&#x27;. Eminem dissed The Source with lines like, &#x27;We burn Source covers like fuckin&#x27; Cypress Hill&#x27;.

;&quot;Outro&quot;
The track &quot;Outro&quot;, which features D12 in the song, was a diss to Murder Inc. Records and Benzino.

==Artwork and packaging==
The album&#x27;s title is a homage to the long running NBC sitcom of the same name, and the album cover features a logo similar to that used on the show.

==Reception==

===Commercial===
The album debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number three on the &quot;Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums&quot; with 226,000 copies sold in its first week. It went on to be certified Gold in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and has been certified platinum in the United States for selling over 1.5 million copies, and worldwide sales of 2 million copies.

===Critical===

&quot;Cheers&quot; garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 12 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier said, &quot;&quot;Cheers&quot; boasts 74 straight minutes of inventive production, original ideas, thought-out lyrics, and straight-up MCing -- even if it lacks outright hits like &quot;In da Club&quot; or &quot;Lose Yourself.&quot; So cheers, indeed -- to Trice, that is -- because his debut is quite an accomplishment and deserves accolade, even if it&#x27;s not a commercial juggernaut like its fellow Shady releases.&quot; J-23 of &quot;HipHopDX&quot; praised the production from Dr. Dre, Timbaland and Eminem, Obie&#x27;s &quot;raw and abrasive&quot; delivery having &quot;flawless execution&quot; and working well alongside the guest artists that help elevate the record despite being unnecessary at points, concluding that: &quot;Nevertheless, &quot;Cheers&quot; needs to be saluted. [It is] an excellent debut for Obie and he finds a great balance of radio friendly raps and hardcore hip-hop. While he isn&#x27;t going to move 50 numbers, &quot;Cheers&quot; is the superior album. I&#x27;ll drink to that.&quot; Melisa Tang of The Situation also gave praise to the beats for giving support to Obie&#x27;s &quot;skillful and witty flow&quot; throughout the track listing but felt they only work half the time, concluding that: &quot;Overall, Obie Trice has not failed to deliver. There is no doubt that he has the talent to succeed in the rap game, but the real test will be in winning over the haters, who constantly accuse him of riding on Eminem&#x27;s phenomenal worldwide success.&quot; Jon Caramanica, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, commended Obie for utilizing his &quot;workmanlike emphasis of craft over style&quot; when delivering humorous tracks like &quot;Hoodrats&quot; and &quot;Got Some Teeth&quot; but was more interested in his vitriol side on &quot;Shit Hits the Fan&quot; and &quot;We All Die One Day&quot;, saying they &quot;distract from his otherwise almost demure display of skill.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Cynthia Fuchs felt the record was overlong and repetitive with its &quot;misogynistic malice&quot; and &quot;hood life&quot; indulgence but gave credit to tracks like &quot;Oh!&quot; and &quot;The Set Up&quot; for telling significant street tales and &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Down&quot; and &quot;Follow My Life&quot; for being &quot;compelling&quot; tributes dedicated to Obie&#x27;s mother.

<text>Montes Alpes is a mountain range in the northern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after the Alps in Europe; the name was confirmed by the International Astronomical Union in 1935. It lies between the selenographic coordinates latitudes 52.81°N and 42.04°N, and longitudes 5.6°W and 3.22°E. The range thus crosses the lunar prime meridian, and is partially illuminated and partially in shadow during first and last quarters. The center of the range is at 48.36°N, 0.58°W, and has a diameter of 334 km.

==Description==

This range forms the northeastern border of the Mare Imbrium lunar mare. To the west of the range is the level and nearly featureless mare, while on the eastern face is a more rugged continental area with a higher albedo. The range begins about one crater diameter northwest of the crater Cassini, at the Promontorium Agassiz, then stretches about 280 kilometres to the northwest and continues in intermittent fashion and the mountains proper end shy of one crater length from the eastern rim of the dark-floored crater Plato. The system of rilles named Rimae Plato may be found in between the eastern edge of Plato and the western edge of the Alpes mountains. The peaks of the Alpes range in height from 1,800m to 2,400m.

The Alpes range was part of the middle ring of the multi-ringed Imbrium Basin. The other mountain ranges around the Imbrium Basin (Montes Caucasus, Montes Apenninus, and Montes Carpatus) were part of the outer ring. The Alpes, being part of the middle ring, thus have a shorter radius to the center of Imbrium than the other ranges of the basin.

The northwestern third of the range is separated from the remainder of the mountains by the Vallis Alpes, a wide rift valley that extends from a narrow cleft in the Montes Alpes to the northeast, reaching the edge of the Mare Frigoris. The total length of this formation is about 166 km, and it reaches a maximum width of 10 km. Running down the center of this valley is a narrow cleft which is not observable through smaller telescopes. Sunrise and sunset in this area occur before the respective lunar quarters.

About one-third the length of the range from the southeast is Mons Blanc, a peak rising to a height of 3.6 km. This compares to a typical height of peaks in this range of 1.8 to 2.4 km. Midway between Mons Blanc and Promontorium Agassiz is Promontorium Deville. To the southwest of Promontorium Agassiz is the isolated Mons Piton, a peak rising to a height of 2.3 km. Blanc, Piton, and the Montes Teneriffe make up part of the inner ring of the Imbrium Basin.

<text>IMT Nord Europe or &quot;École nationale supérieure Mines-Télécom Lille Douai&quot; is a French graduate school of engineering (grande école d&#x27;ingénieurs). It is located in the Hauts-de-France region, shared between 2 campuses: the science campus (&quot;cité scientifique&quot;) of the University of Lille (Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq, European Metropolis of Lille); and the city of Douai. It is accredited by the Commission des Titres d&#x27;Ingénieur (CTI) to deliver the French Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur.

The school trains high-level engineers and scientists (Master and PhD level) in various technological fields. A small number of students are accepted each year, after a very selective exam. It is a crucial part of the infrastructure of French industry.

It is affiliated to University of Lille and Institut Mines-Télécom (Mines-Télécom Institut of Technology - IMT).

The &quot;École des Mines de Douai&quot; merged with TELECOM Lille in 2017 to become the largest engineering school in France north of Paris under the name IMT Lille Douai, then IMT Nord Europe.

==History==

The École des Maîtres-ouvriers mineurs de Douai was founded on 27 March 1878 on the same model as the École des mines d&#x27;Alès, founded forty years earlier.
It was originally a vocational school providing for the training needs of skilled workers &quot;Maîtres-mineurs&quot; for the coal mining industry. 
Chief Engineers Lebleu and Peslin were its first directors. 
The number of admissions was 24 in 1878 and 20 in 1879, enough to meet demand, but fell to 15 in 1880 and averaged only 13 in the following decade.
An Alumni Societe (&quot;Société amicale des anciens élèves&quot;) was founded in 1886.

On 10 February 1892 Henry Küss was entrusted with the Douai mineralogical district, including mining school, a post he held until 1906.
Under Kuss the number of admissions averaged 27.5.
Only candidates who had working experience as minors were admitted.
To reassure critics who denounced training of civil servants and thought over-rapid improvement in the social status of workers would be dangerous, In 1905 Henry Küss stated that the pupils did &quot;not need a very extensive scientific background, which they would anyway with very few exceptions be unable to assimilate.
By 1906, out of 393 alumni whose occupations were known, 151 were supervisors and 110 were surveyors or verifiers.
From 18 January 1906 graduates of the school could be appointed &quot;contrôleurs des Mines&quot; in the colonies.
By 1913 more than 80 of Küss&#x27;s former pupils were working in the colonies or foreign countries.

In the 1960s the school made basic changes to adapt to the recession in the coal industry.
In 1965 it became a school for general engineers with two streams, Buildings/Public Works, and Mechanical/Metallurgy.
Studies took four years, interspersed with five mandatory internships in companies.
The school was authorized to issue an Engineering diploma in 1966.
Research activity developed from the mid-1970s, and a technology incubator was founded in 1985 to support creation of innovative new businesses.
In 1980 the school became the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines.

The &quot;École des Mines de Douai&quot; merged with TELECOM Lille in 2017 to become the largest engineering school in France north of Paris under the name IMT Lille Douai.

== Education of &quot;IMT Nord Europe&quot; ==

All Institut Mines-Telecom (IMT) schools are &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

Although the IMT schools are more expensive than public universities in France, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies, and many of their programs are taught in English. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;. Many of the top ranked schools in Europe are members of the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; &quot;(CGE)&quot;, as are the IMT schools. Degrees from the Institut Mines-Telecom are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) ().

=== First year ===

The selected students have various profiles. At the beginning the school offers a training with general courses:
* Mechanical engineering, materials science, computer-aided design
* Chemical engineering, environmental stakes
* Automation engineering, signal processing
* Programming, algorithms, information technology, mathematics, analysis, probabilities, statistics, 
* Sports
* Project management, team management, law, economics
* Foreign languages: English as a first mandatory language, second mandatory language (German, Spanish, Russian or Mandarin Chinese), third optional language (German, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Italian, Portuguese)

During the second semester, several elective courses are offered and give students the opportunity to learn a particular subject related to engineering topics. These courses are divided into 4 sections:
* Materials, mechanics, design: Chemical properties - Steel - Glass and refractory materials - Mechanical applications - Advanced computer-aided design - Structural materials
* Chemistry, environment, energy: Organic chemistry - Petroleum engineering - Nuclear engineering - Nuclear chemistry - System optimization
* Electrical engineering, electronics, automation: Electricity &amp; environment - Automation - Numerical signal processing - Matlab/Simulink - Programming of sequential functions
* Computer engineering and mathematics: Cryptography and secret codes - Complex analysis - Advanced Excel - Numerical analysis - Data analysis - Web programming - Introduction to ActionScript - Embedded software development

The first year is equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree in general engineering: students have general knowledge about several engineering topics.

=== Second year ===

The second year is the first master year. Students are required to select a minor and a major. This couple of courses gives them a very personalized educational path. There are 13 minors and 8 majors. Some minors cannot be selected with some majors.

The 8 majors offered are:
* Environment and industry
* Civil Engineering
* Energy Engineering
* Mechanical Engineering
* Quality Engineering
* Computer Engineering

<text>Fullerton College (FC) is a public community college in Fullerton, California. The college is part of the California Community Colleges System and the North Orange County Community College District. Established in 1913, it is the oldest community college in continuous operation in California.

==History==

In April 1913, the governing board of Fullerton Union High School approved a motion to establish a two-year postgraduate course of study at the high school. At this time, Fullerton was primarily an agricultural community, which specialized in the production of citrus produce. Delbert Brunton, who was the Fullerton High principal, established the new Fullerton Junior College to provide such postgraduate study.

Twenty-six freshman students enrolled in the first year, and the school had a curriculum of 10 courses. &quot;In 1922 the college was reorganized as an independent junior college district. After holding classes on the Fullerton Union High School campus for its first 23 years, the college began moving to its own fourteen-acre campus next door in 1936.&quot;

In 2002, North Orange County voters passed a $239 million facilities bond measure, of which nearly $135 million was allotted to Fullerton College. It was used for renovation of current campus facilities and also to construct new facilities. On June 13, 2005, the new library was opened, and a formal dedication occurred on October 28, 2005. A bond measure that passed in 2014 will award the North Orange County Community College District (NOCCCD) $574 million to fund construction and renovation projects for the next 25 years.

In 2021, the college introduced an American Indian and Indigenous Studies degree program. This was announced with the school&#x27;s celebration of Indigenous People&#x27;s Day.

== Campus ==
The college is located in the city of Fullerton, California, in northern Orange County. The campus is within walking distance of the downtown section.

The Fullerton College library first opened in 1913, in a small section of the Fullerton High School Library. It moved into the high school gymnasium in 1929 and to a small space in the new science building in 1938. A specialized facility was constructed in 1957 and named the William T. Boyce Library in 1962 in honor of William T. Boyce, who served as dean and president from 1918 to 1951. A new library was constructed and opened on June 13, 2005, and formally dedicated on October 28, 2005.

==Artist-in-residence program==
The Fullerton College Art Department hosts a yearly artist-in-residence (AIR) program which was started in 1972 with a visit from painter Wayne Thiebaud. August 2013 marked the 100th fall semester of the AIR program. It was celebrated with the first exhibit of the entire AIR art collection at the Fullerton College Art Gallery.

== Student life ==
The students of Fullerton College have established a student body association named Associated Students of Fullerton College. The association is required by law to &quot;encourage students to participate in the governance of the college&quot;.

Associated Students of Fullerton College is a voting member of a statewide community college student organization named Student Senate for California Community Colleges. The statewide Student Senate is authorized by law &quot;to advocate before the Legislature and other state and local governmental entities&quot;.

<text>The Mexican Navy () is one of the component of the Mexican Armed Forces. The Secretariat of the Navy is in charge of administration of the navy. The commander of the navy is the Secretary of the Navy, who is both a cabinet minister and a career naval officer.

The Mexican Navy&#x27;s stated mission is &quot;to use the naval force of the federation for external defense, and to help with internal order&quot;. As of 2020, the Navy consisted of about 68,200 men and women plus reserves, over 189 ships, and about 130 aircraft. The Navy attempts to maintain a constant modernization program to upgrade its response capability.

Given Mexico&#x27;s large area of water () and extensive coastline (), the Navy&#x27;s duties are of great importance. Perhaps its most important on-going missions are fighting the Mexican drug war, which includes protecting Pemex&#x27;s oil wells in Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico. Another important task of the Mexican Navy is to help people in hurricane relief operations and other natural disasters.

The Mexican navy is the second largest navy in Latin America and North America, and the third largest in the Americas after the United States and Brazil.

==History==


The Mexican Navy has its origins in the creation of the Ministry of War in 1821. From that year until 1939 it existed jointly with the Mexican Army in the organic ministry. Since its declaration of independence from Spain in September 1810, through the mid decades of the 19th century, Mexico found itself in a constant state of war, mostly against Spain which had not recognized its independence. Therefore, its priority was to purchase its first fleet from the U.S. to displace the last remaining Spanish forces from its coasts.

The Mexican Navy has participated in many naval battles to protect and defend Mexico&#x27;s interests. Some of the most important battles were:

;Attempts by Spain to reconquer Mexico:
* Takeover of the San Juan de Ulúa fort (1821–1825)
* The invasion of Cabo Rojo (1829)
* Battle of Mariel (February, 1828)

* Texas Navy
;Yucatán Independence (1841–1848)
* Naval Battle of Campeche
;The Mexican–American War (1846–1848)
;The Second French Intervention (1862–1867)
;The Mexican Revolution (1910–1919)
* First Battle of Topolobampo
* Second Battle of Topolobampo
* Third Battle of Topolobampo

==Organization==
The President of Mexico is commander in chief of all military forces. Day-to-day control of the Navy lies with the Navy Secretary, José Rafael Ojeda Durán. In Mexico there is no joint force command structure with the army, so the Secretary reports directly to the President. The Navy has a General Headquarters and three naval forces. There are furthermore eight regions (four on the Pacific coast, three on the Mexican Gulf coast and the Región Naval Central, grouping the naval forces, based in and around the capital Mexico City, such as the 7th Naval Infantry Brigade, the Central Special Operations Group and the Air Transport Squadron), thirteen zones, and fourteen naval sectors.

The Navy is divided into three main services designated as &quot;forces&quot;:
* Gulf and Caribbean Sea Naval Force
* Pacific Naval Force
* Naval Infantry Force

Other notable services include:
* Naval Aviation
* Search and Rescue

Officers are trained at the Mexican Naval Academy, called the &quot;Heroica Escuela Naval Militar&quot; (&quot;Heroic Military Naval School&quot;), located in Antón Lizardo, Veracruz.


===Naval Infantry===
The Mexican Naval Infantry Corps was reorganized in 2007–2009 into 30 Naval Infantry Battalions (Batallones de Infantería de Marina – BIM), a paratroop battalion, a battalion attached to the Presidential Guard Brigade, two Fast Reaction Forces with six battalions each, and three Special Forces groups. The Naval Infantry are responsible for port security, protection of the ten-kilometer coastal fringe, and patrolling major waterways.

The Naval Infantry also is responsible for 23 National Service Training Units under the responsibility of the Navy Secretary, enforcing the National Service obligation for Mexicans of teenage and young adult age.

===Naval Aviation===
===Search and rescue units===

In 2008, the Mexican Navy created its new search and rescue system, allocated in strategic ports at Pacific and Gulf of Mexico ports,
to provide assistance to any ships which are in jeopardy or at risk due to mechanical failure, weather conditions or life risk to the crew. To provide such support, the Navy has ordered Coast Guard Defender class ships (two per station, and one 47-Foot Motor Lifeboat coast guard vessel). Other stations will be provided only with s.

===Maritime role===
On April 1, 2014, SEMAR officially announced the creation of Port Protection Naval Units (&quot;Unidades Navales de Protección Portuaria: UNAPROP&quot;) which will include a marine section. The main task of UNAPROPs is to ensure maritime surveillance and inspection.

==Training and education==

The Navy offers several options for graduate studies in their educational institutions:

;Heroica Escuela Naval Militar
It is the school where future officers are trained for the General Corps of the Navy. Candidates can enter upon completing high school. Upon completion of studies, graduates obtain the degree of Sub-Lieutenant and the title of Naval Science Engineer.

;Naval Medical School

==Rank insignia==
===Commissioned officer ranks===
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
===Other ranks===
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
==Modernization and budget==
The annual Navy&#x27;s budget is in a one to three proportion of the national budget relative to the Mexican Army and Mexican Air Force. The Navy has a reputation for being well-run and well-organized. This reputation allows for a close relationship with the United States Navy (USN), as evidenced by the procurement of numerous former USN ships.

===Ships===
The Secretary of the Navy, Admiral Mariano Francisco Saynez Mendoza, announced on October 1, 2007, detailed plans to upgrade and modernize the country&#x27;s naval capabilities. On the following day, &quot;La Jornada&quot; newspaper from Mexico City, disclosed the Mexican Navy plans, which are among others, to build six offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) with a length of , 1,680 tons and each housing a Eurocopter Panther helicopter as well as small high-speed interception boats. The budget for this project is above US$200 million.

Another project is to build 12 CB 90 HMN high speed () interception boats under license from a Swedish boat company Dockstavarvet to the Mexican Navy. Also, a number of fully equipped planes for surveillance and maritime patrol are being considered. Combinations of options and development are being defined.

====Shipbuilding====

The Mexican Navy depends upon their naval shipyards for construction and repairs of their ships. There are five shipyards located in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean:
* Gulf of Mexico
** Naval shipyard 1 (ASTIMAR 1) – Tampico, Tamaulipas
** Naval shipyard 3 (ASTIMAR 3) – Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz
* Pacific Ocean
** Naval shipyard 6 (ASTIMAR 6) – Guaymas, Sonora
** Naval shipyard 18 (ASTIMAR 18) – Acapulco, Guerrero
** Naval shipyard 20 (ASTIMAR 20) – Salina Cruz, Oaxaca

===Missiles===
The Mexican Navy initiated studies to develop and construct its first missile, according to a May 2005 interview with the undersecretary of the Navy, Armando Sanchez, the missile was to have an average range of and be able to target enemy ships and aircraft. The undersecretary added that they already had the solid propellant, and the basic design of the missile. All aspects relative to their fuselage were solved as well as the launch platforms. The Mexican Navy was developing the software to direct the missile to its target. In July 2008, the project was reported to be 80% complete. Despite this effort, the missile development was canceled in 2009 due to &quot;problems with the propulsion system&quot;.

===Radar modernization===
In 2009, the Mexican Navy began operating a batch of new MPQ-64 Sentinel radars in the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico. The radar network was installed in 2007 for a trial phase while military personnel were trained to get familiar with the system. The new installations will work together with combat surface vessels that patrol the area.


==Present fleet==

The Mexican Navy includes 60 smaller patrol boats and 32 auxiliary ships. It acquired 40 fast military assault crafts, designated CB 90 HMN, between 1999 and 2001 and obtained a production license in 2002, enabling further units to be manufactured in Mexico.

==Modern equipment==
==Individual weapons and equipment==
==Artillery==

==Aircraft inventory==
==Future==

For the year 2008 budget, the Mexican Congress approved a US$15 million fund to build only 17 out of the 60 combat boats requested. These ships, designated CB 90 HMN, are to increase the Mexican Navy&#x27;s fast boat fleet. Additional budgets will be awarded each passing year. In total, the Mexican Navy has over 189 operational ships.

In January 2013, the 112th Session of US Congress authorized the transfer of the s and to the Mexican Navy, but due to the cost of overhauling the vessels and the removal of all the weapons systems and most of the electronics and radar gear by the USN prior to transfer, this is still undecided by Mexico. The offer expired on January 1, 2016.

===2014===

On March 25, 2014 Beechcraft Corporation received an order of 2 T-6C+ military trainers from the Mexican Navy.

On June 24, 2014, the Mexican Government requested the purchase of 5 UH-60Ms in USG configuration from the U.S.; its estimated cost is $225 million. Also on June 24, BAE Systems announced it was awarded a contract by the Mexican Government to supply the navy with 4 Mk 3 57mm naval guns, for the ships of the Reformador class.

<text>Central High School is a public high school in the Logan section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1836, it is a four-year university preparatory magnet school.

About 2,400 students attend grades 9 through 12. Central High School is the only high school in the United States with authority, granted by an 1849 Act of Assembly of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, to confer academic degrees upon its graduates. This authority to grant academic degrees led Central to refer to the principal of the school as the “President” of Central High School. The current and fifteenth president of Central High School is Katharine S. Davis.

Central, rather than using a general class year to identify its classes (as in &quot;class of 2021&quot;), uses the class graduating number system (as in &quot;280th graduating class&quot; or &quot;280&quot;). This tradition started shortly after the school&#x27;s founding when it was common to have two graduating classes per year – one in January and one in June. In June 1965, semiannual graduations were replaced by annual graduations. As of the 2024–2025 school year, the current senior class is 284.

==History==
===19th century===


Central High School of Philadelphia was founded in 1836 as &quot;the crowning glory&quot; of Philadelphia&#x27;s public school system, &quot;the worthy apex to a noble pyramid,&quot; and the first &quot;high&quot; school in the state. Because city voters only reluctantly had been convinced of the need for a high school, the curriculum was carefully and publicly geared to the needs of taxpayers. Central&#x27;s founders made an especially concerted effort to avoid educating students in the manner of private academies of the day, where classical languages and literature were of paramount importance.

The school was chartered by an Act of Assembly and approved on June 13, 1836. A site was purchased on the east side of Juniper Street below Market Street, and the cornerstone was laid on September 19, 1837. The school opened on October 21, 1838, with four professors and sixty-three students.

In November 1839, Alexander Dallas Bache, great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin, and Professor of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, was elected the first President of Central High School. President Bache resigned in 1842 to return to his professorship at the University of Pennsylvania, and was succeeded by John Seely Hart, who had been a professor of languages at Princeton University.

An Act of Assembly approved on April 9, 1849, provided that:

&quot;The Controllers of the Public Schools of the First School District of Pennsylvania shall have and possess power to confer academic degrees in the arts upon graduates of the Central High School, in the City of Philadelphia, and the same and like power to confer degrees, honorary and otherwise, which is now possessed by the University of Pennsylvania.&quot; In accordance with this Act, the Board of Controllers on September 11, 1849, authorized the conferring of appropriate degrees upon graduates of Central High.

In September 1854, the school transferred to a new building, located at the southeast corner of Broad and Green Streets. In 1858, President Hart resigned and was succeeded by Nicholas Harper Maguire.

In October 1891 a Graduate Course in Pedagogy, later called the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy, was added to Central as a teacher training program for men. The School of Pedagogy was disbanded in 1918 due to numbers of enrollees dwindling as a result of World War I.

===20th century===
In September 1900, the school moved to its third location in a newer and larger building located at Broad, Green, Fifteenth, and Brandywine Streets. During the formal dedication on November 22, 1902, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, addressed the students. In 1937, it would move to its fourth location, the present Central High School, on Olney Avenue.

After 139 years of existence as an all-male public high school, Central&#x27;s all-male policy was challenged by Susan Vorchheimer, who wished to be admitted to Central. On August 7, 1975, U.S. District Court Judge Clarence C. Newcomer ruled that Central must admit academically qualified girls starting in the fall term of 1975. The decision was appealed, and the Third Circuit Court ruled that Central had the right to retain its present status. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court that, on April 19, 1977, upheld the Third Circuit Court&#x27;s verdict by a 4 to 4 vote with one abstention. That Supreme Court case was called &quot;Vorchheimer v. School Dist. of Philadelphia&quot;.

In August 1983, Judge William M. Marutani of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, ruled that the single-sex admission policy was unconstitutional. The Board of Education voted not to appeal the legal decision, thereby admitting girls to Central High School. In September 1983, the first six girls, all seniors, were admitted.

In October 1987, and again in September 2011, Central High School was officially named a Secondary school of National Excellence by the United States Department of Education and named a Blue Ribbon School. In March 1992, Redbook magazine named Central one of the best schools in Pennsylvania. Central was named &quot;Best Secondary School in Pennsylvania&quot; by the magazine each year since they began rating the nation&#x27;s best schools.

==Guide to class numbers==
Since graduates are usually identified by class number, the year they graduated is not immediately apparent. This section explains the relation between class number and graduation date.

The first class graduated in June 1842. Through much of the school&#x27;s history, there were two graduating classes per year, in January and June. However, there was only one graduating class in June in some years, including all years after 1965. The following list details the correspondence between class number and graduation date.

Thus, for classes graduating after 1965, if one knows the class number, one can determine the year of graduation by adding 1741. Conversely, if one knows the graduation year, one can determine the class number by subtracting 1741.

<doc id="1225291" wikidata="Q844221" url="?curid=1225291" title="Imperium Galactica">
<text>Imperium Galactica is a 4X video game, developed by Digital Reality. The same company would later make its sequel, &quot;Imperium Galactica II&quot;, in 1999. &quot;Imperium Galactica&quot; was published and distributed by GT Interactive in 1997. The soundtrack is the work of Tamás Kreiner. &quot;&quot;, developed by the Hungarian-based Mithis Entertainment, was originally planned and designed as &quot;Imperium Galactica 3&quot; but in development renamed and refocussed to a real-time tactics game. The game was re-released in 2016 on GOG.com with support for Windows.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Imperium Galactica&quot; has both the combat and resource management elements of a real-time strategy game and the vast research tree and colony-building aspects of traditional turn-based &#x27;space-empire-building&#x27; 4X games such as the &quot;Master of Orion&quot; series.

The player, in the role of a young Lieutenant named Dante, begins the game with command of a small capital ship - a &quot;Guardian&quot;-class Destroyer - and three &quot;Raptor&quot;-class Fighters (later in the game the player would command up to 28 capital ships and 180 fighters in one fleet), and three colonies, named Achilles, Naxos and San Sterling, unable to move beyond the boundaries of the small sector assigned for him to defend and expand. The story, concerning the Galactic Empire&#x27;s current status in the 4th millennium, during the 3200&#x27;s, serves as an entry point, gradually introducing the player to new concepts (planet management, space battles, ground battles, research, component &amp; ship production, diplomatic functions) as he rises through the ranks from Lieutenant to Captain, Commander, Admiral and eventually Grand Admiral (where all functions are unlocked and the player has full control), all the while revealing through flashbacks, the character&#x27;s shrouded past, that Johnson is the Galactic Empire&#x27;s secret weapon that was created in desperation, an android.

Regardless of the player&#x27;s actions, the galaxy outside his or her view continues to take shape even as they are completing the &quot;training&quot; ranks prior to being promoted to Admiral. In this way, a player who quickly defeats his initial enemies at early ranks might enter the larger galaxy before the other races have been too badly hurt by the antagonist species, the Dargslan Kingdom. A player might also take an excessive amount of time in these &quot;training&quot; missions and get promoted to find that the entire galaxy has been conquered, making the situation almost hopeless except by exploiting game bugs.

There are five research centers for five categories (Computer, Construction, A.I., Military, Machinery), but on each planet the player is only allowed one of these five categories, marked by a colored symbol on the system card. Each technology requires a certain amount of research centers in each of these five categories before it can be researched for trade goods or command counters (which require time and money). The player is forced to either demolish and rebuild research centers repeatedly, or gain new planets by either conquest or colonization (the latter becomes available relatively late into the game). A.I. players aren&#x27;t bound to this limitation, because every A.I. has a fixed technology pool, which does not develop any further during the game. As a special exception, players may find in the beginning a single planet in Garthog space which has two research centers.

==Reception==
&quot;Next Generation&quot; rated the game four stars out of five, and wrote that &quot;&quot;Imperium Galactica&quot; is an excellent choice for strategy-game fans because it goes beyond a simple strategy game. The progression of the character, the additional responsibilities, and the total immersion of the player combined to form a truly enjoyable title that will keep players entertained for a long time&quot;.

==Legacy==
The game spawned a sequel, &quot;Imperium Galactica II: Alliances&quot;. After GT Interactive&#x27;s bankruptcy, the Imperium Galactica trademark was lost by Digital Reality and another Hungarian development studio called Philos Laboratories began work on &quot;Imperium Galactica 3: Genesis&quot;. Philos Laboratories lost the title when the lease expired and renamed the game &quot;Galaxy Andromeda&quot;. When the studio went bankrupt its successor, Mithis Entertainment, continued development and renamed the project &quot;&quot;. It has little to do with the &quot;Imperium Galactica&quot; franchise, and is a completely different type of game as well - what Mithis calls it a &quot;Tactical Fleet Simulator&quot;. The game tells the backstory for the original &quot;Imperium Galactica&quot; title.

A Galactic Empire Mod project was produced for the open-source &quot;Spring&quot; RTS engine. This effort, like several prior attempts, remains mired in &quot;development hell&quot;, due to few skilled developers having both the time and interest to work on the project. Another group of fans works on &quot;open-ig&quot; and received permission from Digital Reality to reuse the original artwork to create a remake.

<text>Yan Yinling ( or in Japanese, ; born February 15, 1976) is a Taiwanese-born, Japan-based swimsuit model, race queen, singer, and former professional wrestler. She is called also Yinling of Joytoy (インリン・オブ・ジョイトイ), when she appears on television.

==Biography==
===Career===
She began modelling at 16 and started working with photographer Hiraokanovsky Kuratachenko at 19, forming the duo JOYTOY. Kuratachenko is suspected to be in fact Japanese, but he is often labeled a Russian photographer. Much of their work is politically themed, often infused with symbols and references to communism and the Soviet Union. JOYTOY&#x27;s campaign has been noteworthy for being overly sexual and provocative in nature. A notable example was an exhibit that was hosted in the National Museum of History in 2004. The exhibit took the form of an anti-war and anti-prejudice art display of mildly erotic photography. 

In 2008, Yinling published an autobiography by the title &quot;LOVE ERO-Terrorism/Yinling of JOYTOY&quot;. In that same year, she provided the voice for Libido Waterfall, a tertiary character in video game Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan! who was modeled after Yinling.

===Professional wrestling===
Yinling also appeared for the professional wrestling promotion Hustle, a venture led by Nobuhiko Takada. She originally appeared under the heel alias &quot;Yinling the Erotic Terrorist&quot;, but then appeared as a face, under the name Newling-sama (Mistress Newling), who was in storyline the Erotic Terrorist&#x27;s daughter.

===Personal life===
In 2007, a scandal resulted in Yinling being accused of having ties to the yakuza. Her management has denied the accusations.

Yinling is a supporter of the Social Democratic Party of Japan which advocates for social welfare reform and alternatives to nuclear energy. In 2010, she attended a conference held Mizuho Fukushima and spoke of the party&#x27;s policies.

In 2008, she announced her marriage to an anonymous employee of the ZERO1-MAX wrestling agency. In 2010, she revealed that she had given birth to her first child, a son. She currently lives in Taiwan.

<text>New Hamburg is a community of approximately 11,953 (2011 stats) in the township of Wilmot, Ontario, Canada. It is in the far western part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, near the regional border with Perth County. It is adjacent to the community of Baden, which sits to its east and is also a part of the township of Wilmot. The nearest cities are Kitchener, Waterloo, and Stratford.

The Nith River winds throughout the town and flows through the downtown core, which is home to a 50-foot waterwheel made of wood, being built in 1990. This wooden wheel was torn down on March 15th, 2023, and replaced with a metal recreation of the wheel.

The weekly newspapers serving the community are the &quot;Wilmot-Tavistock Gazette&quot; and the &quot;New Hamburg Independent&quot;. The downtown has been designated a Heritage Conservation District.

==History==
Located on the Nith River just over from Berlin (now Kitchener) this settlement was in an area with rich soil. The settlement was laid out in 1832 and was settled primarily by Germans, both Mennonites and others, direct from Germany. A historical plaque honours Josiah Cushman, an Amish Mennonite from Germany. Likely to have been the first settler, Cushman arrived in the early 1830s. He dammed Smith&#x27;s Creek and built a sawmill that helped attract others. The first name of the community was Cassel and then Hamburgh; by 1840, the name was changed to New Hamburg.

William Scott, (known as Lord Campfield in Scotland), arrived in 1838, after Cushman&#x27;s death. He renamed Smith&#x27;s Creek the Nith River, built a new dam, and constructed a new lumber sawmill. The mill continued to plane lumber until 1902 when it burned down; the replacement building was a feed mill, later known as B-W Feed and Seed. That entity still exists, now as a sales outlet for feed. Now considered to be the founder of New Hamburg, William Scott&#x27;s career included work as a Justice of the Peace, Community School Commissioner, New Hamburg&#x27;s first Postmaster, Wilmot Town Councillor, Reeve and the Lt. Colonel of the 5th Battalion of the Waterloo Infantry.

The New Hamburg post office was established by William Scott in 1851. At that time, the population was 500 and there was a pottery, a carriage works, and a foundry. The Grand Trunk Railway reached the area in 1856 and helped the village to establish milling and farm machinery manufacturing. By 1858, the population was 1,000; the settlement included many mills and factories, several general stores, and eight taverns.

New Hamburg was incorporated as a Village in 1857, with a population of about 1100. The river was an excellent source of power for two wool factories and two flour mills in 1864. There was also a foundry that manufactured agricultural implements. Several large companies made carriages, buggies and wagons. By that time there were three churches and a school with 100 students. In 1869 the population was 1,400.

New Hamburg became a town in 1966.

<text>The Honduran Navy is one of the Armed Forces of Honduras&#x27;s three branches.

The Honduran Navy was created through a presidential decree in the 14th of August 1976, with the stated goal of defending Honduran territorial waters, both in the Caribbean and the Pacific coasts.

== History ==
=== Background ===
During Brigadier José Santos Guardiola&#x27;s presidency, there was an attempt to organize a navy, but due to the lack of funds it didn&#x27;t come to be. The government acquired some ships, but no warships. In 1860, the government had 200 men from the army mustered into a schooner in order to aid the British screw sloop &quot;HMS Icarus&quot;, which had been stationed in British Honduras, in combating an invasion by the filibuster William Walker. Walker was ambushed near the Sico Tinto Negro River, captured, and, nine days later, found guilty and executed.

In September 1865, during Captain General José María Medina&#x27;s presidency the Honduran Military Marine was instituted, with the president boarding the schooner &quot;Colibrí&quot;.

Afterwards, in the 1890s, a contract was signed with a German firm for the construction of two steamers, named &quot;Tatumbla&quot; and &quot;22 de Febrero&quot;, with gross tonnages of 108 and 22 tons, capable of steaming at 10 and 7 knots, respectively, both built in Kiel. The Tatumbla had two guns. In the early 1900s, another steamer was commissioned, the &quot;Hornet&quot;; only in 1934 would the next acquisitions come, with the &quot;Bufalo&quot; and the &quot;Zambrano&quot;. During the 1940s, the &quot;Tiger&quot;, the &quot;General Carias&quot; and the &quot;General Cabañas&quot; were acquired.

=== World War II ===

Honduras maintained good diplomatic relations with Germany between the end of the 19th Century and the 1930s. During this period, many businesses were opened by German immigrants in Honduras, and when World War II started in Europe, some citizens of German descent left the country to fight for Germany. The country&#x27;s ports were on occasion used by German submarines for resupply.
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, due to diplomatic pressure from the United States, relations with the Axis powers were broken. On December 8, 1941, Honduras declared war on Japan, and, four days later, on Italy and Germany, with Honduras thus joining the Allies. Some ships carrying Honduran goods had already been sunk by this point, and the situation worsened over the following months, with many Honduran ships sunk; around 200 Honduran citizens were killed. In the following years, Honduran pilots and sailors were involved in World War II.

=== Professional Naval Force ===
In November 1950, a regulation for the Navy&#x27;s insignia and uniforms was issued by the government, and in April 1964, the first two officers and 14 enlisted men (who belonged to the Army&#x27;s Third Infantry Battalion) were assigned to it. One of the officers, Ensign O&#x27;Connor Bain, was sent to the US Coast Guard Reserve Officer Training Center in Yorktown, Virginia, and the other, Ensign Regalado Hernández, together with the enlisted men, to the Naval Base Panama Canal Zone, where they were trained by Panamaian and North American officers. Afterwards, they formed the &quot;First Boats Detachment&quot;, equipped with US donated patrol boats, which would be used as the core for the Navy when it was formally created in 1976, with Lieutenant Colonel Bain as its first commander.

In 1977, the Navy acquired three ships, the &quot;Guaymuras&quot;, 105 feet long, and the &quot;Patuca&quot; and the &quot;Ulua&quot;, both 65 feet long. In 1982, it was also given the 40+ year old tender USCGC Walnut, renamed to &quot;Yojoa&quot;; it served until 1998, when it was lost during Hurricane Mitch. These were the Navy&#x27;s only proper ships until 1988, when it received the Landing Craft Utility &quot;Punta Caxinas&quot;, capable of transporting 100 tons of cargo and still in service as of 2021. A few years later, a new Peterson Mk3 patrol boat was acquired, and in 2013 a further two Damen Stan Patrol 4207 also were.

<text>The Ovation Guitar Company is a manufacturer of string instruments. Ovation primarily manufactures steel-string acoustic guitars (both 6 and 12-string versions) and nylon-string guitars, often with pickups for electric amplification. In 2015, it became a subsidiary of Drum Workshop after being acquired from KMCMusicorp, and in 2020 was sold to GEWA Music.

The company&#x27;s Ovation and Adamas guitars are known for their round backs, which gives them a recognizable shape. The latter are also well known for the use of carbon fiber tops (instead of the typically wood tops for acoustic guitars). Apart from guitars, the company currently produces acoustic basses, mandolins and ukuleles.

==History==

Founder Charles Kaman (1919–2011) developed the first prototypes of the Ovation guitar in 1965–1966. Kaman, an amateur guitarist from an early age, worked on helicopter design as an aerodynamicist at United. Eventually, he founded a helicopter design company, Kaman Aircraft, in 1945.

The Kaman Corporation soon diversified, branching into nuclear weapons testing, commercial helicopter flight, development and testing of chemicals, and helicopter bearings production. In the early 1960s, however, financial problems from the failure of its commercial flight division forced it to expand into new markets, such as entertainment and leisure. Charles Kaman, still an avid guitar player, became interested in making guitars.

From 1966 to 2007, Ovation guitars, and later on Adamas guitars, were a brand of KMCMusicorp, which itself was a subsidiary of Kaman Aircraft.

In 2008, KMCMusicorp (and with that the Ovation brand) was sold to the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. In 2014, Fender announced that they were closing the Ovation guitar factory in New Hartford, Connecticut, leaving all production of Ovation guitars overseas. Before that announcement, Fender established a U.S. production of various acoustic guitars in the New Hartford factory. Alongside Ovation and Adamas guitars, which were produced there for decades, Fender started a U.S. production of other Fender-owned brands in that factory, as is known, Guild (Guild Guitar Company) and Fender Acoustic Custom Shop.

Shortly after closing the New Hartford factory on April 30, 2014, it was announced that the Ovation brand had been sold to the company Drum Workshop, alongside a few other previously Fender-owned brands. The announcement was made on January 7, 2015. In addition to the Ovation brand, Drum Workshop also opened a smaller New Hartford factory near the old facility and reinstated the previously ceased U.S. production of Ovation and Adamas guitars.

In 2020, the German-based GEWA company acquired the brand and assets of Ovation and Adamas from Drum Workshop and moved production to a smaller shop in New Hartford, Connecticut. In January 2024, Ovation and Adamas guitars were displayed at the NAMM Show in Anaheim, California, as part of the larger GEWA family of brands.

==Research and development of first models==

Charles Kaman put a team of employees to work to invent a new guitar in 1964. For the project, Kaman chose a small team of aerospace engineers and technicians, several of whom were woodworking hobbyists as well. One of these was Charles McDonough, who created the Ovation Adamas model. Kaman founded Ovation Instruments, and in 1965 its engineers and luthiers (guitar makers) worked to improve acoustic guitars by changing their conventional materials. The R&amp;D team spent months building and testing prototype instruments. Their first prototype had a conventional &quot;dreadnought&quot; body, with parallel front and back perpendicular to the sides. The innovation was the use of a thinner, synthetic back, because of its foreseen acoustic properties. Unfortunately, the seam joining the sides to the thin back was prone to breakage. To avoid the problem of a structurally unstable seam, the engineers proposed a synthetic back with a parabolic shape. By mid-1966, according to Ovation, they realized that the parabolic shape produced a desirable tone with greater volume than the conventional dreadnought.

Once the engineers had settled on a parabolic shape, they turned their attention to developing a substance that could be molded into this bowl-like shape. Using their knowledge of high-tech aerospace composites, they developed Lyrachord, a patented material comprising interwoven layers of glass filament and bonding resin.

The first successful design, built by luthier Gerry Gardner, went into production soon after the company was established.

The first Ovation guitar made its debut in November 1966. Its Lyrachord body gave the instrument, according to the company, unprecedented projection and ringing sustain. Compared to modern Ovation Guitars, the initial instruments had a shiny bowl that was used again, for example, in the Balladeer 40th anniversary re-issue.

==Initial marketing==
The introduction and promotion of the first Ovation was closely associated with two performing artists, the blues-performer Josh White and the country-music singer Glen Campbell.

===Josh White===
In 1966–1967, the Ovation Guitar Company produced a signature guitar for Josh White, which was the first signature guitar made for an African American. White was the first official Ovation endorser.

Upon completion, the first Ovation guitar was called the &quot;Josh White Model,&quot; which White played at the Hotel America (Hartford, Connecticut), November 14, 1966; at the same show, the Balladeers played Balladeer models. The show was witnessed by &quot;300 representatives of the press and the music industry&quot;

=== Glen Campbell, 1968 ===
The Ovation Roundback Balladeer first caught national attention in 1968 when Glen Campbell hosted a variety show called &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot; on CBS, and in the following year, 1969, he became one of Ovation&#x27;s first endorsers.

=== The Partridge Family, 1970 ===
Ovation guitars and amplifiers, together with musical instruments distributed by another Kaman company, Coast Wholesale Musical Co., were featured on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; musical sitcom TV series.

==Design innovations==


Ovation guitar design reflects its founder&#x27;s engineering training and development of Kaman helicopters. Ovation guitars replace the instrument&#x27;s conventional back and sides with composite synthetic bowls. Kaman felt there were structural weaknesses in the orthogonal joining of the sides, and that a composite material could provide a smooth body. Ovation claims the parabolic bowls dramatically reduce feedback, allowing greater amplification. Improved synthetics techniques from helicopter engineering control vibrations in the bowl. Ovation developed a thin neck, striving for the feel of an electric guitar&#x27;s neck, but with additional strength from layers of mahogany and maple reinforced by a steel rod in an aluminum channel. The composite materials and thin necks reduced weight.


For its soundboards, Ovation uses Sitka spruce, a wood that Kaman engineers used in helicopter blades. In the 1970s, Ovation developed thinner soundboards with carbon-based composites laminating a thin layer of birch in its Adamas model. The Adamas model dispersed the sound-hole of the traditional soundboard among 22 small sound holes in the upper chamber of the guitar, which Ovation says yields greater volume and further reduces feedback during amplification (pioneered in the Adamas model in 1977). Although the area of the multiple sound holes is equal to the area of a single-soundhole, the altered position allows a new style of guitar bracing (e.g. Adamas Bracing). The design strengthens the soundboard, reducing the traditional design&#x27;s bracing and hence weight. In the 1980s, Ovation introduced shallow-bowl guitars to appeal to electric guitarists.

In 1977–1978, Gypsy, an Ovation performing and recording artist, designed the first stereo pre-amplifier for the Adamas 12 string and used it on his album &quot;Ladies Love Outlaws.&quot; At the same time, Ovation provided small doors that blocked the sound holes from the inside in order to dampen feedback in the presence of loud stage monitors. Gypsy had also requested the addition of a round hatch in the back of the body of pre-Adamas guitars to facilitate changing the on-board battery, a feature that was then adopted for all the &quot;round holes.&quot; Before this time, the strings on the round-hole guitars had to be removed to do this. On-board electronics let guitarists move about the stage rather than stay in front of a microphone. On-board electronic tuning, availability, uniformity, and frugal costs facilitated performances by guitar ensembles like Robert Fripp&#x27;s Guitar Craft students. Ovation has also produced solid-body electric guitars and active basses.

Ovations reached the height of their popularity in the 1980s, where they were often seen during live performances by touring artists, such as Rush&#x27;s Alex Lifeson or Paul Simon in &quot;The Concert in Central Park&quot;. Ovation guitars&#x27; synthetic bowl-shaped back and early use (1971) of pre-amplifiers, onboard equalization and piezo pickups were particularly attractive to live acoustic musicians who constantly battled feedback problems from the high volumes needed in live venues.

===Ergonomics===
When he became one of Ovation Guitars&#x27; first endorsers, Glen Campbell suggested reducing the weight of the guitar, which he had discovered caused back strain. After that, Ovation reduced the weight of several models and pioneered &quot;super-shallow&quot; guitar bodies.

While it was produced, Ovation&#x27;s super-shallow 1867 Legend was the recommended guitar in Robert Fripp&#x27;s Guitar Craft. wrote that the acoustic 1867 Legend has &quot;a gently rounded super-shallow body design that may be about as close to the shape and depth of an electric guitar as is possible without an intolerable loss of tone quality. Fripp liked the way the Ovation 1867 fitted against his body, which made it possible for him to assume the right-arm picking position he had developed using electric guitars over the years; on deeper-bodied guitars, the Frippian arm position is impossible without uncomfortable contortions.&quot;

==Model overview==

The Ovation Guitar Company produces guitars under the names Ovation and Adamas.

Ovation guitars have been also produced in China, South Korea and Indonesia. Import models generally have a wooden top. Recently, Ovation significantly reduced U.S. production. From 2010 on, better models—Legend, Elite, Custom Legend, Custom Elite—were made both in the U.S. and in Korea. Before that, these models were U.S. made. In recent years, many U.S. made are identifiable by &quot;LX&quot; in the product name (e.g., Legend 2077LX), whereas Korean versions have &quot;AX&quot; in the model name (e.g., Legend 2077AX). Ovation does not use this convention on all models (e.g., Ovation 1617ALE). Currently, Ovation produces only a few U.S. made models, mostly signature and limited edition models (e.g., Custom Legend 1769-ADII Al DiMeola). Production of the standard model range of Ovation guitars in the U.S. had been ceased under the ownership of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, but is planned to be reinstated by the new owner Drum Workshop.


The Adamas name mainly stands for guitars with a carbon fiber top, although there are exceptions (one is the Adamas 2081WT - WT stands for woodtop). Until the closure of the New Hartford, Connecticut factory in June 2014, all Adamas models were produced in the U.S. LX does not only stand for U.S. made. Originally LX indicated an Ovation guitar that included new features not available on previous models.

Back in 2007 Ovation explained on its website that new features included the new OP-Preamp, an advanced neck system (lightweight dual-action truss rod, carbon fiber stabilizers), a patented pickup (made of 6 elements), inlaid epaulets, scalloped bracing, and a new hard composite Lyrachord GS body. Back then, there was no AX model line. The first AX models appeared on the Ovation-website in 2010. Based on the website&#x27;s history, the LX features were introduced in 2004.

===Upper-level guitars: Balladeer, Legend and Elite===
There are mainly two lines:
* Legend and Standard Balladeer models have one large sound hole as on most acoustic guitars (Standard Balladeer, Legend, Custom Legend - produced in Korea).
* Elites have several smaller sound holes (Standard Elite, Elite, Custom Elite - produced in Korea).

The first Ovation guitar model was a Balladeer (later known as Standard Balladeer)
=== Entry-level guitars: Applause and Celebrity ===
Ovation has two lines of entry-level guitars.
Applause, the lowest cost line, with mainly laminated tops, is imported from China. Celebrity models are imported from China or Korea, and range from entry- to medium-level laminated-top models, to high-end, solid-top models with much ornamentation.

=== Electric guitars: Semi-hollow and solid bodies ===
In 1967–1968, Ovation introduced its Electric Storm Series of semi-hollow archtop guitars and basses. The pickups for these instruments were manufactured by Schaller based in Germany. Production stopped in 1969.

In 1972, Ovation introduced one of the first production solid-body electric-guitars with active electronics, the Ovation Breadwinner. The model did not become popular, however, and production of the Breadwinner and the Ovation Deacon ceased in 1980. Ovation made several other solid-body models up until the mid-1980s. Since that time, the company has focused mainly on acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars.

=== Other instruments: acoustic bass guitars, ukuleles, mandolins ===
Apart from guitars, Ovation has manufactured other string instruments such as acoustic bass guitars, ukuleles, and mandolins.

<text>Robert William Corddry (born February 4, 1971) is an American actor and comedian. He is known for his work as a correspondent on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; (2002–2006) and for his starring role in the film &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot;. He is the creator and star of Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot; and has been awarded four Primetime Emmy Awards. He previously starred in the HBO series &quot;Ballers&quot; and the CBS comedy &quot;The Unicorn&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Corddry was born and raised in Weymouth, Massachusetts. He is the son of Robin (née Sullivan) and Steven Corddry, who was a Massachusetts Port Authority official. He is the older brother of actor Nate Corddry. Corddry and his brother are both Eagle Scouts from Troop 19, located in Weymouth.

After graduating from Weymouth North High School (1989), Corddry went to the University of Massachusetts Amherst (1989–93). According to an interview in the UMass Amherst alumni magazine, Corddry initially planned to major in journalism but changed his major to English. By his second year, he focused much of his attention on Drama classes and plays including &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and &quot;Reckless&quot;. While at UMass, Corddry pledged the Theta chapter of Theta Chi fraternity.

In January 1994, Corddry moved to New York City. His early paying jobs included working as a security guard at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and handing out menus for a Mexican restaurant. He eventually landed acting jobs, including a year-long tour with the National Shakespeare Company. He trained in improv at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City, performing regularly as a member of the sketch comedy group &quot;The Naked Babies&quot; (with John Ross Bowie, Brian Huskey, and Seth Morris); and he spent two years with the sketch comedy group &quot;Third Rail Comedy&quot;. Corddry&#x27;s first notable television appearances were on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Upright Citizens Brigade&quot; (1998–2000).

==Career==
===&quot;The Daily Show&quot;===
In spring 2002, he accepted an audition for &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. His pieces for &quot;The Daily Show&quot; frequently included references to Boston, Massachusetts, which he considers to be his hometown. On October 4, 2005, his younger brother Nate Corddry made his first appearance as a &quot;Daily Show&quot; correspondent. On January 12, 2006, Corddry&#x27;s wife Sandra appeared with him on a &quot;Daily Show&quot; segment; they welcomed their first child, daughter Sloane Sullivan Corddry, on July 3, 2006. On February 9, 2006 Corddry hosted an episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; due to the absence of Jon Stewart (jokingly because the show&#x27;s regular host was &quot;in the shop&quot;, but in fact because of the birth of Stewart&#x27;s second child).

On August 15, 2006, Corddry said &quot;I&#x27;ve got like a week and a half left, all bets are off&quot;, and then on August 21, 2006, Stewart remarked that Corddry&#x27;s last day on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; would be August 24, 2006. Corddry appeared throughout the week, once filing a report from inside a toilet bowl supposedly on board an aircraft transporting John Mark Karr, and another dressed up in a 1970s fashion; Stewart remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s his last week, and really, we&#x27;re trying to come up with terrible things for him to have to do.&quot;

During that last show on August 24, Corddry aired a self-produced tribute to his four years on the show, going out, as Stewart said, with a &quot;poop joke&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;Stewart: That was a very fitting tribute, Rob. We&#x27;re gonna miss you on the show.
Corddry: Why thank you, Jon. But wherever I go and whatever I do, there&#x27;ll always be a part of me here.
Stewart: Wow...that&#x27;s a really sweet thing to say.
Corddry: No no no, I&#x27;m not kidding. It&#x27;s in the second floor men&#x27;s room, actually. That&#x27;s what you get for not giving me a proper send off.
Stewart: You&#x27;re really gonna go out on a poop joke?
Corddry: I have to stay true to myself, Jon.&lt;/poem&gt;

Corddry cites Stewart as a profound influence on his comedy, crediting Stewart for teaching him how to focus on an idea in order to find the humor in it, and says that his &quot;The Daily Show&quot; pedigree earned him the clout to make &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot;.

Among the projects Corddry worked on after leaving &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was &quot;The Winner&quot;, a 2007 TV series.

Corddry has since made appearances on the show, both as a guest and as a correspondent.

===Film roles===
Corddry played the title character in &quot;&quot; (2004) and Mac, Ben Stiller&#x27;s character&#x27;s best friend in &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;. He has also made appearances in &quot;Old School&quot; (2003, credited as Robert Corddry), &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;, &quot;Semi-Pro&quot;, &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot;, &quot;Failure to Launch&quot; and &quot;The Ten&quot;.

He also appeared in &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot; as Ron Fox, a neurotic and racist agent with the United States Department of Homeland Security, in &quot;W.&quot; as Ari Fleischer, and also in &quot;What Happens in Vegas&quot;. In 2010, he co-starred in the John Cusack film &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot; and in 2013 he co-starred in Jonathan Levine&#x27;s &quot;Warm Bodies&quot; as the zombie M.

===Other work===
Corddry hosted the 10th annual Webby Awards ceremony on June 12, 2006. He starred as the main character in the Fox mid-season comedy &quot;The Winner&quot; from March 4, 2007 until the series&#x27; cancellation. He described the show to Stuff Magazine as &quot;sort of like a fucked-up &quot;Wonder Years&quot;.&quot;

Corddry has appeared in a &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; episode entitled &quot;The Seder&quot; as a sex offender who moves into Larry David&#x27;s neighborhood. He also appeared in two episodes of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Arrested Development&quot; as Moses Taylor, an actor who plays &quot;Frank Wrench&quot;, an obsessively by-the-books detective on a fictional television series &quot;Wrench&quot;. Corddry has also done some voice work as Gordon the animated Devil on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Weighty Decisions&quot; (alongside fellow &quot;Daily Show&quot; correspondent Ed Helms). He also appeared in a commercial for Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; series and a 2001 promotional ad as an anger management therapist to the Townsville Villains of the cartoon series &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;.

Corddry&#x27;s voice appears in the History Channel production World War II in HD. He is the voice of World War II soldier and jazz musician Roscoe &quot;Rockie&quot; Blunt.

Corddry wrote, directed, and starred in the web series &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot; for The WB on its online network at TheWB.com. After talks fell through with Comedy Central, Turner&#x27;s Adult Swim picked up the series and began airing new episodes August 22, 2010.

On March 29, 2010, he was a co-guest host of WWE Raw with fellow cast member Clark Duke from &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot;.

Corddry played an important role in proliferating Justin Halpern&#x27;s Twitter account &quot;Shit My Dad Says&quot;. An early enthusiast of the quotes made by Halpern&#x27;s father, Rob tweeted a link to Shit My Dad Says which &quot;jump-started&quot; the phenomenon, helping expose Halpern&#x27;s Twitter feed to a larger audience.

Corddry also has starred in three commercials for the Holiday Inn in both 2010 and 2011. He appeared in three episodes of &quot;Community&quot; playing a lawyer, Alan Connor, an old acquaintance of Jeff Winger, who was also a lawyer.

In August 2011, Corddry appeared on episode 29 of the podcast &quot;Back to Work&quot;, distributed by the 5by5 podcast network, where he was interviewed by Merlin Mann about his writing and acting career.

In 2012, Corddry began a recurring role on the third season of &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, playing &quot;The Car Czar&quot;, Jane&#x27;s new boss at the car dealership. He also had a recurring role on the short-lived FOX series &quot;Ben and Kate&quot;, as Buddy, the boorish owner of the bar where Kate and BJ work, also BJ&#x27;s on-and-off boyfriend.

As recently as October 2013, Rob appeared again as a recurring guest on &quot;The Jason Ellis Show&quot;. A talk show featured exclusively on SiriusXm Satellite Radio, Corddry accepted an invitation to host his own show airing on the soon to be launched &quot;Jason Ellis Channel&quot;.

From 2015 to 2019, he starred in the HBO comedy-drama series &quot;Ballers&quot;.

He was the subject the episode #16, titled &quot;Rob,&quot; of &quot;Heavyweight (podcast)&quot; by Jonathan Goldstein.

On December 3, 2019, it was revealed that Corddry would be a host of the revived &quot;Top Gear America&quot;, which debuted on Motor Trend in January 2021.

<text>The Nicaraguan Navy, officially the Naval Force of the Nicaraguan Army, () is the naval service branch of the Nicaraguan Armed Forces. The navy&#x27;s mission is to ensure the defense and security of the islands, territorial waters and exclusive economic zone of Nicaragua in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

==History==
Founded on August 13, 1980, as the Sandinista Navy, it consisted of a few old patrol boats in the early 1980s. The Sandinistas acquired eight Soviet Yevgenya class minesweepers, of which seven remained in 1993. Three Soviet Zhuk-class patrol boats were believed to be seaworthy, out of seven that remained at the end of 1990. Also believed to be operational are three North Korean fast patrol boats as well as two Vedette-type boats built in France and armed with Soviet 14.5mm machine guns.

The primary mission was to discourage seaborne Contra attacks and to deter CIA-run operations such as the destruction of diesel storage facilities at Corinto in 1983 and the mining of Nicaraguan harbors in 1984. The Sandinista navy (—MGS), which had reached a peak strength of 3,000 personnel in 1990, suffered a sweeping reduction to 800 by 1993.

Nicaragua ordered two additional patrol vessels based on the Damen Stan 4207 design in 2017. The vessels were commissioned as &quot;Soberanía&quot; I (409) and &quot;Soberanía&quot; II (411) in August 2019. Unlike many other nations&#x27; vessels, which are designed solely for coast guard or environmental monitoring, these two have added a military sensor suite and a deck gun. Militarizing the vessels boosted their cost from US$20 million to US$65 million. The vessels used had previously been employed by Jamaica - HMJS &quot;Cornwall&quot; and HMJS &quot;Surrey&quot;.

==Organization==
The commander of the navy was a Sandinista Popular Army (—EPS) officer with the rank of major. The principal bases of the MGS are at the ports of Corinto on the Pacific and Puerto Cabezas on the Caribbean. Other installations are at El Bluff near Bluefields and San Juan del Sur on the Pacific.

<doc id="1225329" wikidata="Q1166726" url="?curid=1225329" title="Grime music">
<text>Grime is a genre of electronic dance music (EDM) that emerged in London in the early 2000s. It developed out of the earlier UK dance style UK garage, and draws influences from jungle, dancehall, and hip hop. The style is typified by rapid, syncopated breakbeats, generally around 140 beats per minute, and often features an aggressive or jagged electronic sound. Emceeing is a significant element of the style, and lyrics often revolve around gritty depictions of urban life.

The style initially spread among pirate radio stations and underground scenes before achieving some mainstream recognition in the UK during the mid-2000s through artists such as Dizzee Rascal, Kano, Lethal Bizzle, and Wiley. In the mid-2010s, grime began to receive popular attention in Canada. The genre has been described as the &quot;most significant musical development within the UK for decades.&quot;

Though they are often compared, grime is generally considered distinct from hip hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle. 

==History==
===Origins===
Grime emerged in the early 2000s in London. It has origins tied with UK pirate radio stations such as Rinse FM, Deja Vu, Major FM, Delight FM, Freeze 92.7 and Mission. and it was through pirate radio that artists could first present themselves and build an audience. In the late 1990s, UK garage grew in popularity and also found crossover commercial success with shows on Kiss 100 and BBC Radio 1. Whilst much of the popular UK garage sound fused soul and R&amp;B influences, a &#x27;darker garage&#x27; sound was also appearing which was more instrumental and less vocal, which allowed MCs to lay down lyrics over them. The role of MCs became more prominent on radio shows, and collectives such as So Solid Crew (on Delight FM), Heartless Crew (on Mission), and Pay As U Go (on Rinse FM) would begin to pave the way for what would eventually be called &quot;grime&quot;. Members of these crews would begin to experiment with accessible music creation software such as Fruityloops to write their own instrumentals which were cut to dubplate for shows.

The first grime track is often debated. Some will credit Pay As U Go&#x27;s &quot;Know We&quot; or So Solid Crew&#x27;s &quot;Dilemma&quot; (both were released in 2000), however, &quot;Eskimo&quot; by Wiley (produced in Christmas 1999 or early 2000, but released in 2002) and &quot;Pulse X&quot; by Youngstar (released in 2002), a member of Musical Mobb, are also often considered to be contenders. Dizzee Rascal personally claimed his song &quot;Crime&quot;, released in 2000, was the first grime song. DJ Slimzee and DJ Karnage have also suggested &quot;Year 2000&quot; (released 2000) by Wiley as a contender. Other tracks that were among the first to be labelled as &quot;grime&quot; include &quot;Ice Rink&quot; and &quot;Igloo&quot; by Wiley, &quot;Creeper&quot; by Danny Weed, and &quot;Dollar Sign&quot; by Sticky featuring Stush. Also of note is the OST for the video game , composed by British producer Dylan Beale, which features &quot;all the hallmarks of early grime instrumentals: staccato strings, eski bleeps and square wave bass&quot;. This would mean it predates the first recognised grime tracks by as much as 8 years. 

Wiley at the timed dubbed the sound &#x27;eskibeat&#x27; rather than &quot;grime&quot;, which had yet to gain popular usage. His song &quot;Eskimo&quot; was characterised by its sparse and cold production, and &quot;awkward, off-kilter rhythms&quot;. Wiley explained this colder, darker sound, reflected his mental state at the time, stating &quot;The music reflects what&#x27;s going on in society. Everyone&#x27;s so angry at the world and each other. And they don&#x27;t know why&quot; to &quot;Spin&quot; magazine in 2005. The name &quot;grime&quot; was coined by journalists who initially termed the music&#x27;s sub-bass heavy sound as &quot;grimy&quot;, which subsequently became &quot;grime&quot;. It has also been suggested by artists themselves that the term fits as the music frequently talks about &quot;grimy goings-on&quot; in deprived areas. Initially, some referred to the genre as &#x27;grimey garage&#x27;.

At this point, the style was known by a number of names, including 8-bar (meaning eight-bar verse patterns), nu shape (which encouraged more complex 16-bar and 32-bar verse patterns), sublow (a music style and movement created by Jon E Cash with Dread D (T Williams) and crew &quot;The Black Ops&quot;, the name sublow being a reference to the very low bassline frequencies, often around 40 Hz) and eskibeat, a term applied specifically to a style initially developed by Wiley and his collaborators, incorporating dance and electro elements. This indicated the movement of UK garage away from its house influences towards darker themes and sounds. Wiley&#x27;s song &quot;Wot Do U Call It&quot; was released in 2004 and was made to address the identity problems grime was experiencing at the time, and to establish its separation from garage. It became Wiley&#x27;s first grime hit song.

Grime is not an offshoot of early electronic music, but rather a subgenre that draws from a wide variety of influences. Early innovative artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Wiley were able to take the strong thumping drums of drum and bass, lyricism and vocal styles of UK garage and alter some of the rhythms of dancehall to capture all three genre&#x27;s essences and add a new half-time, down-tempo dimension to the mix. The genre&#x27;s popularity grew exponentially in the United Kingdom, as people across the scene&#x27;s musical spectrum appreciated grime&#x27;s eclectic mix of instrumentation and subcultures. This hybridisation united many different music scenes, allowing for it to spread in the same word-of-mouth and mixtape-based style as hip-hop, yet still appeal to fans of electronic music. It also paved the way for more electronic music artists to incorporate stronger Jamaican influence in the future. Grime never received the same attention worldwide that it did in the UK. Much like many other less mainstream forms of British electronic music, its main scene and fan base remain in the United Kingdom.

Although grime is recognised as a creative and innovative musical style, there are other contributing factors to its rapid and widespread growth in popularity. The MCs producing current grime music are overwhelmingly young as a group, the most well known names in the industry, Dizzee Rascal and Kano, both getting their first hits at the age of 16 with &quot;I Luv U&quot; and &quot;Boys Love Girls&quot; respectively, and the resultant package of &quot;youth making music for youth&quot; is seen as a crucial factor for grime&#x27;s success.

Grime producers often battle in so-called &quot;war dubs&quot;. Clashing between MC&#x27;s is generally considered to be an important part of grime culture.

=== Development ===

Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Kano and Lethal Bizzle were among the first to bring the genre to mainstream media attention in 2003–2004, with their albums &quot;Boy in da Corner&quot;, &quot;Treddin&#x27; on Thin Ice&quot;, &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; and &quot;Against All Oddz&quot; respectively. Dizzee Rascal garnered widespread critical acclaim and commercial success with &quot;Boy in da Corner&quot; winning the 2003 Mercury Music Prize. From 2001 to 2006 The RWD magazine forum was cited as a key development in the genre&#x27;s culture. Moderators included Logan Sama, and artists such as Wiley, Skepta and Jme would often come on the forum to engage with the community. This was the birthplace of Wiley&#x27;s famous rants, where he would often target forum users and resort to either trolling or humorous insults.

The genre was predominantly non-visual in its early stages, meaning you would primarily only hear artists on pirate radio or through their music as opposed to actually seeing what they looked like. This changed with the rise of various DVD series&#x27; such as &quot;Lord of the Mics&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Decks&quot;, &quot;Risky Roadz&quot;, &quot;Run the Roads&quot; and &quot;Practise Hours&quot;, filmed by amateur videographers such as Roony &#x27;Rsky&#x27; Keefe and Troy &#x27;A Plus&#x27; Miller. The DVDs often featured artists giving interviews and performing freestyles. These videos often featured record store Rhythm Division on Roman Road in East London, which served as a key community hub for both developing and established Grime MCs during this time. The store was frequented by artists like Wiley, Skepta and Dizzee Rascal before its eventual closure in 2010. Jammer created &quot;Lords of the Mics&quot; in 2004. The DVD primarily showcased underground artists clashing (or &quot;battle rapping&quot;) each other. &quot;Lord of the Mics&quot; was originally sold by Jammer, Jammer secured an exclusive deal with ukrecordshop.com which helped catapult sales worldwide. The DVD eventually helped smaller grime artists find a platform through selling the DVDs to independent record stores throughout the UK and eventually helping grime form an internet following from uploads to YouTube. This series built a unique platform for artists, because the majority of prior exposure for these artists was through pirate radio. This video series allowed artists to be more visible, and spread their sound.

In 2003, TV channel Channel U was formed (later became Channel AKA, now Now 70s). It would become one of the most important places for people to discover new grime music.

In 2004, grime received its first UK Top 20 single with Lethal Bizzle&#x27;s song &quot;Pow! (Forward)&quot;. The song would prove controversial for the alleged fights it caused in clubs, leading to many venues banning the song from being played. This made it difficult for Lethal Bizzle to find a platform to perform his music. Lethal stated in 2012 to The Guardian that he was unable to play in urban clubs for over a year due to the bans placed on him. Many other grime artists also experienced difficulties performing in clubs due to Form 696, a police risk assessment form that many clubs were asked to fill in by the Metropolitan police. The form was created in 2005 after a spate of gun violence in clubs. The form was criticised in 2009 by John Whittingdale, a Conservative Party MP, for being &quot;draconian&quot;. The form was also criticised for allegedly targeting black music nights due to it asking specifically what ethnic groups may be attending the event. Many grime raves were shut down by police using the form. Lethal Bizzle stated in 2012 this led to a shift from making grime music for the clubs, to making grime music for &quot;in-your-house listening&quot;. Form 696 has been blamed for contributing to the decline in popularity grime experienced during the late 2000s.

Logan Sama&#x27;s show on radio station Kiss FM was one of the only daytime radio shows that would regularly play grime during the 2000s.

=== Decline ===
By the late 2000s, grime had begun to enter into a decline. Record labels, radio, and the media struggled with knowing what to do with grime, and as a result limited its impact and exposure. The rise of dubstep and UK funky also made it harder for grime to gain a limelight. Many grime MCs also began to move towards commercial electro house-influenced rap and away from grime music. Artists such as Tinchy Stryder, Chip, and Wiley began to shift away from grime music and instead began releasing music with pop elements to much success. Wiley&#x27;s track &quot;Wearing My Rolex&quot;, produced by Bless Beats, has been credited for kickstarting this wave of commercialisation, but while it managed to gain a number 2 spot in the official singles chart, many of the initial attempts to replicate this success failed. Tinchy Stryder&#x27;s &quot;Stryderman&quot; only managed to peak of No. 73, while Roll Deep&#x27;s &quot;Do Me Wrong&quot; failed to chart at all. Skepta&#x27;s &quot;Rolex Sweep&quot; only peaked at number 86, although it did briefly start a dance craze after it was released, received a remix by the band Coldplay, and featured on the comedy show &quot;Misfits&quot;. Dizzee Rascal found more success than most, with his songs such as &quot;Dance wiv Me&quot; finding itself on the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. The wave of commercialised music received some criticism from fellow grime artists for being inauthentic to the original sound.

Another commercialisation that happened during this period was grindie, which fused grime with indie rock.

Grime did still have some success during this period, such as the popular Tempa T song &quot;Next Hype&quot; released in 2009. &quot;Pow&quot; by Lethal Bizzle was dubbed the &#x27;unofficial song&#x27; of the 2010 student protests. The grime scene outside of London was also flourishing in the midlands, particularly in Birmingham. In 2008, GrimeForum was created by Hijj. The forum was a major platform for grime music at the time, providing a space for artists to promote themselves and a space for fans to discuss grime as a whole, something that was important to people outside of London due to the lack of information they had access to. Canadian artist Tre Mission credited the forums importance in his early growth.

The lack of media attention towards grime, or any mainstream platforms that would reliably showcase grime, gave rise to internet platforms such as SB.TV (formed in 2006), Link Up TV (formed in 2008), and Grime Daily (formed in 2009, now known as GRM Daily). With their initial focus only on grime music (though this has since changed), these platforms provided an easy outlet for artists to funnel their music through and gain fame from, collectively creating an ecosystem that allows artists to easily record, produce, and release music to the masses without the need of support from traditional media or the music industry.

In 2012, Charlie Sloth created &quot;Fire in the Booth&quot; on BBC 1Xtra (later moved to Apple Music). The show became a popular segment and granted grime MCs and UK hip-hop artists a large platform to showcase themselves.

=== Revival ===
In 2011, a new edition of Lord of the Mics was released, the first since 2006. Lord of the Mics is a series of grime clashes hosted by Jammer. Both the LOTM III DVD and CD charted. Wiley, inspired by the return of LOTM, also brought back Eskimo Dance the following year, a grime rave from the 2000s that had been discontinued. Jammer suggested that the success of Eskimo Dance encouraged more grime raves to be held than had been previously.

By 2013, a revival of instrumental grime was occurring in the underground, with a new wave of producers experimenting with grime music. Logos, who was credited by FactMag for initiating the revival, credited the fall of dubstep as inspiration for going back to grime and reimagining it. In 2013, just a year prior to grime&#x27;s resurgence in the mainstream, a large &#x27;war dub&#x27; occurred amongst dozens of grime producers. It started off with grime producer Bless Beats releasing &quot;Wardub&quot; on Twitter, followed by a response from Shizznit which also included disses towards various producers within the scene, who in-turn followed up with their own diss instrumentals.

In the following year, grime experienced a commercial MC-led revival, initiated by the success of Meridian Dan&#x27;s &quot;German Whip&quot; featuring Big H and Jme. The song reached number 13 in the UK Singles Charts. Two months after that, Skepta reached number 21 in the UK Singles Chart with his single &quot;That&#x27;s Not Me&quot; featuring his brother Jme. Two months later, Lethal Bizzle released the single &quot;Rari WorkOut&quot; featuring Jme and Tempa T, which also charted, peaking at number 11 in the UK Singles Charts. A wave of new successful young grime MC&#x27;s also began to emerge, such as Stormzy, AJ Tracey, Novelist, Jammz, and Lady Leshurr.

In 2015, Kanye West invited various grime artists to join him on stage at the Brit Awards. Following criticism of the performance, Stormzy released &quot;Shut Up&quot;, using the 2004 instrumental &quot;Functions on the Low&quot; produced by XTC, a member of Ruff Sqwad. The song was a massive hit for Stormzy and helped further popularise grime music. Stormzy&#x27;s performance of the song during the ring walk to Anthony Joshua&#x27;s Heavyweight boxing match with Dillian Whyte further pushed the song higher up the charts, eventually peaking at number eight on the UK Singles Chart. In February 2016, Ministry of Sound and DJ Maximum released a grime compilation entitled &quot;Grime Time&quot;, which topped the UK compilations chart.

In May 2016, Skepta&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Konnichiwa&quot;, entered the UK Albums Chart at number two. The album was awarded the 2016 Mercury Prize, and was later credited for introducing grime to a new generation of fans. In January 2017, Wiley released his eleventh studio album &quot;Godfather&quot;, debuting at number 9 in the charts.

In February 2017, Stormzy&#x27;s &quot;Gang Signs &amp; Prayer&quot; was the first grime album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. In June, the British Phonographic Industry reported that grime sales had risen over 100% with physical sales growing over 109%, digital sales 51% and streaming up 138%. This led to the Official Charts saying grime had &quot;smashed&quot; its way into the mainstream.

By 2018, grime&#x27;s momentum had begun to slow down. Grime&#x27;s rise has been credited for &#x27;opening the door&#x27; for competing genres, such as afroswing and UK drill, that had begun to take the limelight.

In 2019, Stormzy became the first grime artist to headline Glastonbury Festival.

==National growth==
As grime became more popular in the UK throughout the mid-2000s, it spread out of London to other major British cities. Birmingham, Manchester, Nottingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Blackpool, and Bristol now have grime MCs who are currently gaining major exposure in the scene and have featured on &quot;Lord of the Mics&quot;, an annual DVD released by Boy Better Know&#x27;s Jammer.

The national growth of the grime scene has also been evident with many grime artists playing on the urban music stages of the big summer festivals such as Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds, T in the Park and O2 Wireless Festival in Hyde Park. Dizzee Rascal played at all these events in the summer of 2008.

In 2015, Manchester grime artist Bugzy Malone was involved in a heavily publicised grime feud with London-based MC Chip who had created controversy with comments during a &quot;Fire in the Booth&quot; session. The feud catapulted Bugzy Malone to national fame and he has so far released three commercial projects, all debuting in the top 10 in the UK with his latest album charting at number four.

The largest scene outside London is based in Birmingham and the wider Birmingham area.

So Solid Crew influenced many grime artists, their raw dark track &quot;Dilemma&quot; considered by some to be one of the first grime songs ever.

Mike Skinner released an EP entitled &quot;All Got Our Runnins&quot;, which featured a number of grime MCs on the remixes of some of his tracks. Skinner also produced and featured on Kano&#x27;s 2005 hit single &quot;Nite Nite&quot;, from the critically acclaimed &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; album.

In 2006, the second in the series of &quot;Lord of the Mics&quot; DVDs was released. It featured Devilman from Birmingham, clashing Skepta. Devilman&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Lord of the Mics&quot; is one of the earliest examples of a Midlands MC at the forefront of the scene and is credited by Jammer with helping to break down the stigma of accents from outside London over grime music. The clash is considered to be one of the greatest in the &quot;LOTM&quot; series with artists such as Drake praising it. Devilman would later link up with Mike Skinner to appear on the remix of &quot;Prangin&#x27; Out&quot;.

In 2007, Trilla released the single &quot;G Star&quot;, produced by the Dwellaz. A fusion of grime and bassline, it became an underground hit. Several other tracks were released during this time which were also well received by fans, such as Slash&#x27;s &quot;Birmingham&quot; and C4&#x27;s &quot;Oorite&quot;.

In 2009, Wolverhampton producer S-X released the Woooo Riddim, which was widely regarded as one of the most successful instrumentals that year, with many MCs recording their own vocals over the beat.

By the early 2010s, the grime scene in Birmingham was well established and the city hosted several highly successful events called &#x27;Goonies&#x27; at the Rainbow Warehouse in Digbeth. These events attracted some of the biggest names in grime, most notably P-Money, who referenced the events on his single &quot;Slang Like This&quot;.

Other prominent artists include Deadly, who formed the grime group N.O.D.B, the first group from Birmingham to feature on BBC Radio 1Xtra; Mayhem, who is also a founding member of N.O.D.B, known for his bombastic sound and his 2012 feud with Wiley, C4, Sox, JayKae and SafOne. Many Birmingham artists have now had success outside the Birmingham region in recent years. The fourth edition of Lady Leshurr&#x27;s &quot;Queen&#x27;s Speech&quot; freestyle has gained over 28 million views on YouTube as of May 2016. In 2016, Lady Leshurr won a MOBO award for the best Female Act.

As well as hosting large events, the pirate radio scene includes stations such as Silk City Radio, where Birmingham DJ Big Mikee hosts a regular slot between 10-12pm every Sunday.

Birmingham producers such as Preditah and Swifta Beater have become established figures in the grime scene, with leading artists such as Wiley giving recognition to their contribution to grime. In 2011, Preditah released his &quot;Solitaire&quot; EP; a collection of four grime instrumentals. This EP reached number 1 on the iTunes album charts.

=== Comedy in grime ===

Channel U commissioned the first grime comedy series in 2002: &quot;The Booo Krooo&quot;, made by &quot;RWD&quot; magazine&#x27;s founding team members Matt Mason and Lex Johnson. Comedy, satire, and playing on stereotypes would become a common theme in grime music, with artists such as Mr Wong, Bearman, and Big Narstie, Junior Spesh, and Tempa T employing humour in their music. In 2006, Afrikan Boy&#x27;s &quot;One Day I Went to Lidl&quot; song went viral gaining over a million views on YouTube by 2007.

2014 saw the release of &quot;People Just Do Nothing&quot;, a mockumentary series that parodied UK garage, pirate radio culture, and the early stages of grime. In 2017, the show won &#x27;Best Scripted Comedy&#x27; at the BAFTA Awards. In June 2018, grime MC Big Narstie and comedian Mo Gilligan launched &quot;The Big Narstie Show&quot; on Channel 4.

In November 2019, IKEA UK used grime MC D Double E as the voice of their Christmas advert &#x27;Silence the Critics&#x27;. D Double E wrote a song talking about how dirty the house was and the lyrics were placed over animated household items.

==International growth==
The 2005 release of 679 Recordings&#x27; &quot;Run the Road&quot; compilation showcased some of the most popular grime releases to that point, increasing the popularity and fame of grime and grime artists internationally. A particularly notable grime artist who has had success overseas is Lady Sovereign, who appeared on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, signed to Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc-A-Fella Records, and whose &quot;Love Me or Hate Me&quot; became the first video by a British artist to reach number one on MTV&#x27;s Total Request Live.

It was not until the release of his third album, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Maths + English&quot;, that Dizzee Rascal experienced international acclaim. He was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize again, and despite the fact that the album was not released in the United States in 2007, it received high praise from international music critics, magazines, websites and blogs, including &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Rock Sound&quot;. By 2010, he had achieved three number one singles in a row.

In Canada, British Man Dem (B.M.D.), a grime collective originally from the UK, popularised grime with their radio show &quot;Brits in the 6ix&quot; in 2008 in which they brought grime artists to the spotlight in Canada. Grime became increasingly popular in Canada during early 2010, most notably by Canadian grime artist Tre Mission, one of the first North American artists to be associated with the predominantly United Kingdom-based grime genre. Drake also proved helpful in bringing grime to the spotlight in Canada; Skepta&#x27;s single &quot;Shutdown&quot; sampled a video by Drake, and Skepta later worked on Drake&#x27;s &quot;More Life&quot; project.

Various UK MC&#x27;s have had successful tours in New Zealand, such as Wiley, Stormzy and Eyez. Stormzy&#x27;s album &quot;Gang Signs &amp; Prayer&quot; reached No.14 in the New Zealand charts. A grime tour known as Eskimo Dance was intended to occur in Australia and New Zealand in late 2018, featuring MC&#x27;s Wiley, Lethal Bizzle, Devlin, P Money &amp; Little Dee, President T and producers DJ Target and Rude Kid. It was anticipated to be the &#x27;biggest ever&#x27; grime tour in New Zealand. The event was cancelled in late 2018 by Wiley himself for unclear reasons. New Zealand grime MC Stanza Switch Blade and NZ grime crew Spreading The Sickness (STS Crew) have both featured on Risky Roadz, a long-running influential grime video series wherein MC&#x27;s are made to freestyle over handpicked beats.

The late 2010s and early 2020s a number of collaborations and genre-blending projects between South African and UK gqom musical artists and grime MCs such as Lady Lykez, Scratcha DVA and Novelist.

=== Australian grime ===
Some DJ&#x27;s, such as Lady Erica, were playing British grime by the mid-2000s in Australia but it was not common place. UK-born Fraksha is widely regarded as a pioneer of the scene in Australia. Fraksha originally started MC&#x27;ing in UK Hip-Hop crew Nine High alongside Scotty Hinds and Byron during the early 2000s. Nine High released two successful UK Hip-Hop mixtapes and performed alongside fellow UK Hip-Hop pioneers including Skinnyman and Klashnekoff. At the time, both Fraksha and Scotty Hinds were involved with the local London rave scenes and were exposed to grime, Jungle and Dubstep. In 2006, both Fraksha and Scotty Hinds would move to Australia and get involved with the local scene there. Fraksha and Scotty Hinds, alongside local MC&#x27;s Diem and Murky, formed the first Australian based grime collective, Smash Brothers, in 2008. By 2010, the collective was booking grime shows and doing radio sets around Australia. Smash Brothers pioneered what would become Australian grime music, and were known for their high energy performances.

In 2010, Fraksha released the first official Australian grime release called &quot;It&#x27;s Just Bars&quot;. The mixtape was a success, and was awarded &#x27;Mix-tape of the year&#x27; by Ozhiphop Awards.

For the most part, few members of Smash Brothers initially released a lot of music other than Fraksha, but all were active in the raving scene where they would go on to expose many to grime music. They also worked with UK based artists such as Skepta, Foreign Beggars and Dexplicit. Another first for Fraksha was the launch of Melbourne radio show The Sunday Roast on KissFM with Affiks, dedicated to grime and Dubstep music. In 2011 he started the first Australian grime night alongside Affiks and Arctic called 50/50. Fraksha in 2011 would go on to perform in New Zealand alongside UK grime pioneer Dizzee Rascal.

The resurgence grime was experiencing in the UK during the mid-2010s would also reach Australia. Many British MC&#x27;s, including Footsie, D Double E, Stormzy, Skepta and Wiley would have successful tours in Australia. In late 2018, a UK MC tour Eskimo Dance was scheduled to occur in Australia featuring MCs Wiley (who created Eskimo Dance), Lethal Bizzle, Devlin, P Money &amp; Little Dee, President T and producers DJ Target and Rude Kid. The event was anticipated to the &#x27;biggest grime event&#x27; to ever occur in Australia. It was cancelled just prior to schedule by Wiley himself for unclear reasons.

The sound&#x27;s resurgence also affected the popularity of grime in Australia, with various other Australian MC&#x27;s picking up the sound with success, such as Diem, Alex Jones, Shadow, Talakai, Nerve, Wombat and Seru.

Grime continues to gain traction in Australia with new artists showing face on a regular basis. Promotions such as Melbourne&#x27;s 50/50 Grime Melbourne and Invasion Crew Perth heavily incorporate the UK&#x27;s &quot;Rave&quot; style setup for live performances.

Sonically speaking, Aussie grime is similar to its UK counterpart aside from the local accents and slang. The Australian hip hop scene also has a significant influence on the sound.

=== Brazilian grime ===
During the early- to mid-2000s, British electronic music was crossing over into Brazil in the form of Dubstep, UK garage, and grime, leading to local DJ&#x27;s to mix the various sounds into their sets, and set-up events and parties dedicated to the genres. This in-turn led to a small interest in grime music, culminating in early releases such as &quot;Cidadão Comum Refém&quot;, released by MV Bill (influenced by a Dizzee Rascal CD) in 2002, and &quot;Vou Keimah!&quot;, produced by Bruno Belluomini featuring MC Jimmy Luv. &quot;Vou Keimah!&quot; was premiered in 2005 at a São Paulo called Tranquera and later premiered by British DJ Kode9 on Rinse FM. Brazilian MC Vandal is also an early Brazilian grime pioneer from the 2000s period.

Grime in Brazil would fade by the late 2000s, however it would be picked up again during grime&#x27;s resurgence around 2014 in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo. Influenced by artists such as Skepta and Dizzee Rascal, a new crop of DJ&#x27;s and MC&#x27;s emerged, such as Fleezus, Febem, Diniboy, SD9, Kbrum, Turistas de Guerra, 03 Noxio, and others. Antonio Constantino and Diniboy came up with the idea for a Brasil Grime Show, a radio show modelled after British grime radio sets, such as the Grime Show on London radio station Rinse FM, wherein a DJ will play instrumentals and invite an MC to perform over them for an extended period. The show is recorded at Casa do Meio Studio in Bangu, Rio de Janeiro. Similar to early British grime music, the group has a lack of financial support in making music. New Brazilian MC&#x27;s, such as Leall, have experienced growth after appearing on the show. Leall&#x27;s episode in particular has over 80 thousand views. Antonio Constantino and Diniboy grouped up with local DJ&#x27;s and producers Lucas Sá, Diego Padilha, Yvie Oliveira, and Rennan Guerra in order to create the show, regularly inviting local MC&#x27;s to perform over grime instrumentals. Brasil Grime Show has also held grime events in Botafogo, Duque de Caxias, and Copacabana. The Brasil Grime Show has been credited with helping the growth of grime music in Brazil.

In October 2019, Febem and Fleezus visited the UK and performed on GrimeReportTV and Pyro Radio. This visit was also accompanied by a documentary filmed in London about Brazilian grime, first premiered on October 18 in São Paulo. They also performed a cypher alongside British MC&#x27;s Eyez, Yizzy, and Jevon for Red Bull.

In March 2020, Febem, Fleezus, and producer Cersv released an EP titled &quot;BRIME&quot; (&quot;brime&quot; itself being a nickname for the Brazilian grime scene). It featured collaborations with British MC&#x27;s Jevon and Teeboi. In 2021, it was re-released in vinyl in collaboration with Butterz.

Brazilian grime has incorporated elements of the local genre baile funk to their sound. Puterrier described his sound as &quot;70% funk, 30% grime&quot;.

=== Chinese grime ===
A relatively small grime scene exists in Shanghai and Beijing, China, started by two British expats Naaah and Alta. Around 2015, Alta&#x27;s and Naaah&#x27;s label Push &amp; Pull and promoter Puzzy Stack began promoting grime parties. In Shanghai, these were primarily hosted in a club called The Shelter. Many local producers would go to the club to showcase their music. The club was shut down in late 2016 due to licensing problems and they would later move to All Club.

A style of grime known as &#x27;sinogrime&#x27; which incorporates elements of East Asian motifs first began being noticed in China by 2009, and would influence local producers. Shanghai based producer Swimful remixed Wiley&#x27;s sinogrime instrumental &quot;Shanghai&quot; in 2016. Beijing based producer Howie Lee also produced an album with Sinogrime elements, called &quot;&quot;Mù Chè Shān Chū&quot;.&quot;

Unlike grime elsewhere, Chinese grime is mostly instrumental due to the lack of local MCs. According to Puzzy Stack, a grime promoter based in Beijing, the fast intensity of grime makes it difficult for Chinese MCs to rap over. Clubs play a large role in the scene, holding grime nights wherein local DJs and producers can come and showcase their music. Producers sometimes include samples and references from local pop-culture like Kung-Fu movies or Mandopop.

In 2016, UK grime MC Novelist and AJ Tracey visited Shanghai and played alongside local grime producers. Killa P, P Money and Japanese MCs Pakin and Dekishi have also visited.

In 2018, Chinese rapper After Journey ( &quot;Àifújiéní&quot;) visited the UK to film a documentary about grime alongside UK MC Cadell. As well as the documentary, Cadell and After Journey made the first ever grime song featuring a UK &amp; Chinese MC called &quot;2 Much&quot;, which was later featured by DJ Target on BBC Radio 1xtra.

=== Japanese grime ===
In 2004, Japanese DJ&#x27;s had already begun to play grime music from the UK. In 2008, a group of MC&#x27;s from Osaka emerged who were inspired by Roll Deep&#x27;s &quot;Rules And Regulations&quot; mixtape, led by pioneers MC Dekishi, MC Duff and MC Tacquilacci. MC Dekishi released the first ever Japanese grime mixtape in 2009, titled &quot;Grime City Volume 1&quot;. Osaka MCs are known for rapping extremely fast. Another scene sprung up in the Tokyo region of Shibuya led by Carpainter, Double Clapperz, MC ONJUICY, PAKIN and Sakana Lavenda. PAKIN visited the UK in 2013 where he was invited by Devilman to join the Dark Elements crew. However, Japanese Grime has stayed an underground genre in Japan with little local media attention.

In 2013, over a hundred Japanese grime producers participated in a producer clash called War Dub Japan Cup which garnered a massive response in the UK. In 2014, Elijah and Skilliam held a set with Japanese MC&#x27;s and Producers that went viral via media outlets like SB.TV and GRM Daily receiving significant attention in the UK.

In November 2018, record label Butterz celebrated its eighth anniversary at Tokyo based club Unit. Butterz are notable for having an early investment into the Japanese grime scene; this goes back as far as 2009, when Japanese producers would send the label beats via MSN Messenger.

Japanese grime has more DJs than it does MCs; as a result, the former takes more importance. Lyrical content differs to UK grime, with a lack of crime related lyrics and more of a focus on societal and political issues, with rebellious counterculture elements. Japanese Grime uses samples and references from local pop-culture like Anime, Japanese Idols and J-pop.

== Musical style ==
Grime is typified by complex 2-step, 4/4 breakbeats, generally around 140 beats per minute, or sometimes structured around a double-time rhythm, and constructed from different synth, string and electronic sounds. Self-proclaimed &#x27;godfather&#x27; of grime Wiley claims in his 2017 autobiography &quot;Eskiboy&quot; that he personally created most of his early tracks at 140 BPM as it is the default tempo in FL Studio. Stylistically, grime draws on many genres including UK garage, drum and bass, hip hop and dancehall. The lyrics and music combine futuristic electronic elements and dark, guttural basslines.

Grime predominantly evolved from the UK speed garage scene and genre towards the latter stages, although it takes influences from other genres. According to Sasha Frere-Jones of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, grime has developed a fierce sound by &quot;distilling&quot; rhythms to a minimal style resulting in a choppy, off-centre sound. Whereas hip hop is inherently dance music, the writer argues that &quot;grime sounds as if it had been made for a boxing gym, one where the fighters have a lot of punching to do but not much room to move.&quot; Frere-Jones also states that grime has maintained a style different to hip hop. Hattie Collins supports Frere-Jones&#x27; analysis, asserting that grime is &quot;an amalgamation of UK garage with a bit of drum &amp; bass, a splash of punk&quot;.

According to Alex de Jong and Marc Schuilenburg, grime music also samples sawtooth wave sounds (chiptunes) from video game music and ringtones which had become part of everyday life in London and other parts of the country; &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, for example, is frequently sampled and referenced, as grime is &quot;built around lyrical clashes&quot; which are &quot;equated with Street Fighter&#x27;s 1 on 1 battles&quot;. British grime lyrics often reference communication technologies popular with artists and listeners such as smartphones and social media. Sirpixalot recently brought attention to the game &quot;&quot; from 1994 which bears some of the hallmarks sounds of grime.

== Subgenres and styles ==
Many of the various subgenres and styles of grime, such as 8-bar, nu shape, eskibeat and sublow, were initially names applied to the genre as a whole. In the early 2000s, &quot;grime&quot; had negative connotations for being a &quot;dirty word&quot; and received resistance from within the scene. Over time the various names would encapsulate different niches, while &quot;grime&quot; eventually won out to become the overarching name.

=== 8-bar ===

According to cultural sociologist Monique Charles, grime is typically characterised by four beats to a bar, in 8 or 16 bar cycles. It is one of the reasons why grime was unofficially called 8 bar or 16 bar in its formative years. 8-bar is a subgenre or style of grime, first seen in Youngstar&#x27;s &quot;Pulse X&quot; instrumental. 8-bar instrumentals switch beats every eight bars, meaning that each 8 bars the MC would be rapping over a different rhythm. This was in contrast to &quot;nu shape&quot;, another style of grime which encouraged 16–32 bar patterns.

===Darkside===
Darkside was a subgenre pioneered by Terminator. Darkside is defined by its dark, sluggish, and violent content, similar to road rap but over grime instrumentals. Only a few other MCs have tried making the subgenre, such as Shxdow.

===Eskibeat===
Eskibeat was initially a name given to music by Wiley before grime was the agreed upon title. The term &quot;eskibeat&quot; is derived from &quot;Eskimo&quot;, a name for indigenous people who live in the extremely cold northern circumpolar region. This reflected Wiley&#x27;s mindset at the time, which was both &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;cold-hearted&quot;. Eskibeat would later develop into a subgenre of grime, defined by the &quot;futuristic, icy cold synths, devastating basslines and awkward, off-kilter rhythms&quot; pioneered by Wiley in tracks like &quot;Igloo&quot; and &quot;&quot;Eskimo&quot;&quot;, one of the first examples of grime music and eskibeat. Eskibeat production has had a massive impact on grime music, and has had an influence on UK drill.

Notable producers of Eskibeat are Wiley, Zomby, Danny Weed, and Lewi B.

=== Rhythm &amp; grime ===

Rhythm &amp; grime, also known as R&amp;G or R&#x27;n&#x27;G, is a subgenre pioneered in 2004-2005 by producers Terror Danjah, DaVinChe and Scratcha DVA, along with the support of BBC 1Xtra&#x27;s DJ Cameo. The subgenre mixed grime with R&amp;B, showcasing a softer side of grime, often with accompanying R&amp;B vocals, while keeping the 140bpm rugged sound of grime. Many UK R&amp;B singers, such as Sadie Ama, Lady Ny, Katie Pearl, and Gemma Fox, would perform over R&amp;G instrumentals, usually without an MC rapping alongside them. Many grime artists also made various R&amp;G tracks, such as Ruff Sqwad, Wiley, Kano, Skepta and Dizzee Rascal. Producers such as Blackjack, Iron Soul, Low Deep and Kid D also incorporated R&amp;G elements into their instrumentals. Lady Ny has stated she was the first woman to sing on grime, and the first woman to bring out a grime mixtape.

There was some push back against R&amp;G from people who felt it was too Americanised, such as DJ Logan Sama who referred to R&amp;G as having &quot;gimmicks&quot;. According to Terror Danjah, after making the track &quot;So Sure&quot; with Kano and Sadie Ama, grime MC Crazy Titch initially told him to stop making &quot;girl tunes&quot;, although he would later request Terror produce one for himself.

In 2006, Scratcha DVA released the album &quot;The Voice of Grime&quot; featuring 22 different singers. It was unique at the time due to being the first project to have so many different women singing over grime instrumentals; however, the sound would mostly disappear after the album was released. Many of the R&amp;B singers that were singing over R&amp;G were inconsistent and would regularly disappear.

The subgenre made a comeback in the 2010s after American singer Kelela released a mixtape in 2013, &quot;Cut 4 Me&quot;, featuring a heavy R&amp;G influence. In 2014, she collaborated with British artist Bok Bok to make &quot;Melba&#x27;s Call&quot;, another modern take on R&amp;G. Terror Danjah formed R&amp;G Records, a record label dedicated to R&amp;G. In 2017, Terror Danjah and Olivia Louise released &quot;I&#x27;ll Follow U&quot; on the label.

In 2018, Gemma Fox released &quot;Grime Vocals Archive&quot;, a collection of previously unreleased or unheard rhythm &amp; grime songs.

=== Sinogrime ===
Sinogrime is a term coined by Kode9 in 2005 to describe a style of grime that incorporated East Asian motifs, such as traditional East Asian instruments and samples from vintage Kung Fu films. The style was present before this, however. Earlier examples include Jammer&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Chinaman&quot; which was released in 2003 and included a sample from the 1993 martial arts film &quot;Twin Warriors&quot;. The sound was initially pioneered by many people, such as DJ Target, Wiley, Terror Danjah, Ruff Sqwad, Jammer, Geenus, DJ Wonder and Wookie. In a 2003 interview, Wiley stated he &quot;used to watch a lot of Kung Fu films&quot; and used to go to a store called Sterns to find world music to sample. Dizzee Rascal stated his song &quot;Brand New Day&quot;, released in 2003, was also inspired by Kung Fu films.

The term does not necessarily apply to grime made in Japan or China, unless the instrumental includes East Asian motifs. Sinogrime first began being noticed in China in 2009 and would influence local producers, particularly in Shanghai and Beijing. Shanghai-based producer Swimful remixed Wiley&#x27;s sinogrime instrumental &quot;Shanghai&quot; in 2016. Beijing-based producer Howie Lee also produced an album with Sinogrime elements, called &quot;Mù Chè Shān Chū&quot;. Howie Lee described sinogrime as &quot;propaganda&quot;, a sound that represents an image in people&#x27;s heads, but one that is not necessarily accurate.

Sinogrime was described by music critic Dan Hancox as a genre that &quot;barely existed&quot;. Dan Hancox suggested that sinogrime reflected a shift away from looking towards America for influence, and instead looking East. This was possibly the result of the rising popularity of Japanese video games and Chinese movies which featured music from their respective countries. Both Wiley and Dizzee Rascal have stated they were inspired by Kung-Fu movies.

Sinogrime would see a resurgence in the 2010s via producers like Fatima Al Qadiri, Slackk, Walton and JT The Goon. In 2014, Kuwaiti producer Fatima Al Qadiri released &quot;Asiatisch&quot;, which had a heavy sinogrime influence and was highly acclaimed, although Fatima was actually unaware of the term &quot;sinogrime&quot; whilst she was making the album. In 2015, Kid D released the &quot;Shaolin Struggle&quot; EP.

=== Sublow ===
Sublow was an early subgenre of grime, and one of the early names that was used to refer to the entire genre.

The subgenre is defined by its heavy synths, edgy rhythms and deep low bass. The sound was initially pushed by Jon E Cash, Dread D (T Williams) and other members of the Black Ops collective.

=== Weightless ===
Weightless is a sound that appeared during the mid 2010s, pioneered by Logos and Mumdance. Weightless is defined by its atmospheric, minimal and ambient sound, giving it a &quot;weightless&quot; feel. Logos compared it to &quot;Devil Mixes&quot;, which is a grime instrumental where the drums have been stripped, primarily popularised by Wiley, which he had wanted to expand upon. However weightless goes much further than that, stripping away the typical aggressiveness of a grime track. Mumdance was encouraged to make the sound after being annoyed with the drum infested tracks that DJ&#x27;s were playing at clubs, without any contrast in-between. Weightless is also influenced by the noise genre.

Mumdance and Logos&#x27; label, Different Circles, have released two &quot;Weightless&quot; mixtapes showcasing the sound, featuring producers like Rabit, Inkke, Dark0, Murlo, Logos and Strict Face. Mr. Mitch was another notable producer of the subgenre.

== Criticism ==
As with many similar scenes around the world, grime has encountered some criticism, especially from government officials such as Kim Howells, who made comments that some grime supporters claimed to find &quot;deeply racist&quot;, referring to popular artists and crews as &quot;boasting macho idiot rappers&quot;. In 2006, David Cameron criticised grime music for &quot;encouraging people to carry guns and knives&quot;. A counter argument is given by Jeff Chang in an article in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, where he said Dizzee Rascal&#x27;s often violent and sexual lyrics are heralded as &quot;capturing, encapsulating, and preserving&quot; the life that he and his peers live on the streets every day.

<text>In mathematics, the principal part has several independent meanings but usually refers to the negative-power portion of the Laurent series of a function.

==Laurent series definition==
The principal part at formula_1 of a function
: formula_2
is the portion of the Laurent series consisting of terms with negative degree. That is,
: formula_3
is the principal part of formula_4 at formula_5.
If the Laurent series has an inner radius of convergence of formula_6, then formula_7 has an essential singularity at formula_8 if and only if the principal part is an infinite sum. If the inner radius of convergence is not formula_6, then formula_7 may be regular at formula_8 despite the Laurent series having an infinite principal part.

==Other definitions==

===Calculus===
Consider the difference between the function differential and the actual increment:
:formula_12
:formula_13
The differential &quot;dy&quot; is sometimes called the principal (linear) part of the function increment &quot;Δy&quot;.

===Distribution theory===
The term principal part is also used for certain kinds of distributions having a singular support at a single point.

<doc id="1225355" wikidata="Q172087" url="?curid=1225355" title="String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)">
<text>Ludwig van Beethoven completed his String Quartet No. 12 in E major, Op. 127, in 1825. It is the first of his late quartets. Commissioned by Nicolas Galitzin over a year earlier, the work was not ready when it was scheduled to premiere. When it was finally premiered by the Schuppanzigh Quartet, it was not well received. Only with subsequent performances by the Bohm Quartet and the Mayseder Quartet did it begin to gain public appreciation.

== Background ==
String Quartet No. 12, Op. 127, is the first of Beethoven&#x27;s late quartets and was commissioned by the wealthy Russian prince Nicolas Galitzin, an enthusiast of Beethoven&#x27;s music. A cellist himself, Galitzin strove to play Beethoven&#x27;s music, waiting impatiently for him to compose at whatever price he saw fit. Galitzin&#x27;s commission brought Beethoven back to composing in the string quartet genre after a 10-year absence, and suspended his financial woes. Beethoven replied to Galitzin on January 25, 1823, requesting 50 ducats for three quartets: Opp. 127, 132, and 130. He committed to completing the first quartet by the end of February or mid-March. At the time, his Symphony No. 9 was taking the majority of Beethoven&#x27;s time. Therefore he pushed work on Op. 127 back well over a year, completing Symphony No. 9 in February 1824.

== Analysis ==
Op. 127 has four movements and a typical performance takes 36–38 minutes. Beethoven initially planned two additional movements: one between the first and second, and another between the third and fourth.

In the first edition of 1826, published by Schott, the finale had no initial tempo marking other than &quot;Finale&quot;, and the third movement&#x27;s opening indication was &quot;Scherzo: Vivace&quot;, not &quot;Scherzando vivace&quot;.

=== 1st movement: Maestoso ===
The first movement is in sonata form and opens with a six-bar chorale-like &quot;Maestoso&quot;. The &quot;Allegro&quot; ensues with the start of the exposition at bar 7 with a more committed tone. The &quot;Maestoso&quot; has an unusual rhythmic structure. Rhythms of two-bar groups fall in a 5+3 pattern in eighth notes. The metric pulse is in quarter notes. Each of its bars stresses a rising step until ultimately C is reached in the first violin with an elaborate trill leading to the &quot;Allegro&quot;. Episodic explosions or virtuosic passages occur toward the middle of the development. Contrapuntal texture ensues in the first half of the development. Canons come in with thematic material, leading to thematic material from the C major &quot;Maestoso&quot;.

=== 2nd movement: Theme and variations ===

The immense second movement, marked &quot;Adagio, ma no troppo e molto cantabile&quot;, is in the subdominant key of A major. It consists of a set of six variations and a coda. The last two variations have qualities of recapitulations in unrelated keys. The 3rd variation is in the flat submediant F major, enharmonically notated in E. The 4th variation returns to the tonic and the original theme. It is altered rhythmically, using 16th-notes in place of eighth notes in the melody.

# The first variation is in meter with darker harmonies and quick changes in dynamics.
# The second variation increases the tempo to &quot;andante con moto&quot; and adjusts the meter to . The violins engage in a dialogue over staccato accompaniment.
# The third variation shifts to E major, enharmonically the flat submediant, and the tempo shifts to a hymnlike &quot;adagio molto espressivo&quot;.
# The fourth variation returns to and A major by dropping a half-step from E to the dominant, E. This variation has a codetta that transitions to D major in preparation for the next variation.
# The fifth variation is &quot;sotto voce&quot; and has been called a &quot;mysterious episode&quot;. It begins in D major and transitions to the parallel C minor.
# The recapitulatory sixth variation returns to , presents only half of the theme and connects directly to the coda.

The penultimate variation recapitulates the theme after a contrasting section in the submediant, while the final variation restores the tonic and basic thematic material after an episode in the subdominant. Beethoven based this tonal progression on the finale of the Ninth Symphony, where the orchestral double fugue episode in B is followed by the &quot;grand&quot; variation for full orchestra and choir in D major, followed by the &quot;&quot; episode in G major, which moves into the choral double fugue in the tonic D major.

* Op. 127: A → E (lowered submediant) – penultimate variation → D (subdominant) → final variation
* Op. 125: D → B (lowered submediant) – penultimate variation → G (subdominant) → final variation

=== 3rd movement: Scherzo ===

The dancelike scherzo features a dotted-rhythm figure. This is the quartet&#x27;s most contrapuntal movement. The scherzo&#x27;s trio is a &quot;Presto&quot; of a kind Beethoven did not use very often, though it is similar in sound and phrasing to some of his bagatelles from the contemporary Op. 126 set.

=== 4th movement: Finale ===

The fourth movement is in sonata form. Its four-bar opening is expanded to an 11-bar harmonic recall. The coda, marked &quot;Allegro con moto&quot;, is in 6/8 meter. The key changes from E minor to C major.

== Reception ==
The Schuppanzigh Quartet premiered Op. 127 on March 6, 1825. Few people were moved as the performance was regarded as a failure. Its first listeners described it as incomprehensible. Joseph Bohm, first violinist of the Bohm Quartet, reported: &quot;When Beethoven learned of this—for he was not present at the performance—he became furious and let both performers and the public in for some harsh words.&quot; Op. 127&#x27;s premiere was scheduled for a concert on January 23, 1825, but the quartet was still unfinished at this time. Op. 95 was substituted for it instead. Op. 127&#x27;s next scheduled performance was on March 6, 1825. On February 8, Schuppanzigh asked Beethoven how the quartet was going as the quartet hadn&#x27;t had any rehearsals yet. The quartet ended up with only two weeks for rehearsal. After the premiere, Schuppanzigh wrote to Beethoven saying he didn&#x27;t want to present it until it was perfect.

<text>Cichlasoma is a genus of freshwater fish in the cichlid family. The genus was previously very large (a wastebasket taxon), including cichlids from North America, including Central America, and South America.

Reclassification and subsequent splitting of the genus by Sven O. Kullander and other ichthyologists has resulted in removing many of the former species from &quot;Cichlasoma&quot; to genera such as &quot;Amphilophus&quot;, &quot;Archocentrus&quot;, &quot;Herichthys&quot;, &quot;Heros&quot;, &quot;Nandopsis&quot;, &quot;Parachromis&quot;, &quot;Thorichthys&quot;, &quot;Vieja&quot; and others in the tribe Heroini.

==Species==
According to FishBase, there are currently sixteen recognized species in this genus, but three very different Middle American taxa (&quot;C.&quot; geddesi&quot; a synonym of &quot;Herichthys deppii&quot;, and &quot;C.&quot;&quot; istlanum&quot; and &quot;C.&quot;&quot;&quot; trimaculatum&quot; placed in &quot;Amphilophus&quot;) are not included by Catalog of Fishes, effectively limiting &quot;Cichlasoma&quot; to a group of rather similar, medium-small cichlids of South America.

<doc id="1225381" wikidata="Q729462" url="?curid=1225381" title="Tony Gonzalez">
<text>Anthony David Gonzalez (born February 27, 1976) is an American former professional football tight end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons. Regarded as one of the greatest tight ends of all time, he is the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in receiving yards and receptions by a tight end, along with ranking third in overall receptions. Gonzalez spent his first 12 seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs, who selected him in the first round of the 1997 NFL draft. During his last five seasons, he was a member of the Atlanta Falcons. Since retiring in 2013, Gonzalez has served as a football analyst for NFL on Prime Video and was previously at CBS Sports and Fox Sports.

Gonzalez finished his career with 14 Pro Bowl selections, the most for a tight end and second-most in league history, in addition to receiving six first-team All-Pros. Known for his durability and rarely fumbling, Gonzalez appeared in 270 of 272 regular season games and lost only two fumbles on 1,327 touches. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Early life==
Gonzalez was born in Torrance, California. He was raised by his mother, who worked two jobs to support the family. His paternal grandfather, whose surname was &quot;Gonçalves,&quot; had moved from Cape Verde to Argentina; he was of part Portuguese ancestry. His paternal grandmother was Jamaican, with part Scottish ancestry; and his mother&#x27;s family is African-American, with mixed European roots. Gonzalez attended Huntington Beach High School in Huntington Beach, California, where he lettered in football and basketball.

As a senior, he caught 62 passes for 945 yards and 13 touchdowns and was a first-team All America selection at both tight end and linebacker. Playing basketball, he was named Orange County and Sunset League MVP as he averaged 26 points per game.

After his senior year, Gonzalez was named the Orange County High School Athlete of the Year, beating out athletes such as golfer Tiger Woods.

==College career==
Gonzalez chose to attend the University of California, Berkeley, where he majored in communications and played both football and basketball. As a member of the California Golden Bears football team, he played tight end under future NFL coach Steve Mariucci. Gonzalez was also an All-Pac-10 and All-America selection.

Gonzalez also continued his basketball career at Cal. In his junior year, he played in 28 games, averaging 6.8 points and 5.4 rebounds per game as California made it to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA basketball tournament.

Eventually, Gonzalez had to choose a career between basketball or football. On the difficulty of the transition between the two, Tony said &quot;you get done playing football and then you transition to basketball[, which] had already been going for a month&quot;, but ultimately &quot;the decision was pretty much made for me...&quot;

Gonzalez decided to forgo his final year of eligibility to declare for the NFL draft.

===Kansas City Chiefs===

Gonzalez was ranked as one of the top tight ends in the 1997 NFL draft and was considered a top 15 selection. The Chiefs traded up from the 18th to the 13th selection with the Tennessee Oilers to draft Gonzalez.

Gonzalez began his career in the 1997 season. He finished his rookie season with 33 receptions, two touchdowns, and a blocked punt on special teams, helping the Chiefs to finish with the best record in the American Football Conference (AFC). He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team for the 1997 season. In the 1998 season, Gonzalez saw dramatic improvements with 59 receptions for 621 yards, and he also caught two touchdown passes for the second (consecutive) year.

The 1999 season saw Gonzalez again improving when he caught 76 passes for 849 yards and a career-high 11 touchdown receptions, earning his first Pro Bowl selection. In addition, he was named as a First Team All-Pro. In Week 14 of the 2000 season, he had 11 receptions for 147 yards and a touchdown in a loss to the New England Patriots. In the 2000 season, he had 93 receptions for 1,203 receiving yards and nine receiving touchdowns. He was named to the Pro Bowl and as a First Team All-Pro for the 2000 season. In the 2001 season, he had 73 receptions for 917 receiving yards and six receiving touchdowns while earning his third career First Team All-Pro honor and Pro Bowl nomination. On November 4, against the San Diego Chargers, he threw his first professional pass, which went for 40 yards.

During the 2002 offseason, Gonzalez briefly resumed his basketball career, playing for the Miami Heat in the NBA Summer League. He appeared in two games, with his best outing being an 11 rebound performance in a 72–71 win against the Indiana Pacers. Despite never considering bringing Gonzalez to training camp due to his ongoing football career, then coach Pat Riley later stated that &quot;If he ever would have pursued it, I think he would have been a 10-year pro&quot;.

In Week 4 of the 2002 season, Gonzalez had seven receptions for 140 yards and three touchdowns in a win over the Miami Dolphins. In the 2002 season, he had 63 receptions for 773 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns to go along with yet another Pro Bowl nod. Among the highlights from that season was a 48–30 victory over the Miami Dolphins, where he had seven receptions for 140 receiving yards and a career-high three touchdowns. From 2003 to 2006, Gonzalez was the most productive tight end in the NFL. In the 2003 season, he had 71 receptions for 916 receiving yards and ten receiving touchdowns. For the fourth time in his career, he was named as a First Team All-Pro. He was named to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl for the 2003 season. His best season statistically came in 2004, when he caught an NFL-record (for a tight end) 102 passes for 1,258 yards and seven touchdowns. In Week 17, he had a career-high 14 receptions for 144 yards against the San Diego Chargers. He earned a spot in the Pro Bowl for his historic season. Gonzalez&#x27;s single-season record of 102 receptions by a tight end stood for 8 years, until it was broken by Jason Witten during the 2012 season. In the 2005 season, he had 78 receptions for 905 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in another Pro Bowl season.

Starting late in 2006, Gonzalez began to close in on numerous team and league receiving records. He finished with 73 receptions for 900 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns and earned his eighth consecutive Pro Bowl nomination. In 2006, Gonzalez broke wide receiver Otis Taylor&#x27;s Chiefs team receiving yards and touchdowns mark, and also passed running back Priest Holmes for the team yards from scrimmage record.

In 2007, Gonzalez continued his productivity in spite of the generally poor play of the Chiefs&#x27; offense. Though the Chiefs finished at or near the bottom in most major offensive categories, Gonzalez led the Chiefs and all NFL tight ends in receptions (99) and receiving yards (1,172) while being named to his ninth straight Pro Bowl.

On October 14, 2007, Gonzalez broke the career touchdown reception record for tight ends previously held by Shannon Sharpe, as well as passing Ozzie Newsome for second in career receiving yards for a tight end. On December 23, 2007, Gonzalez recorded his third season with 1,000 receiving yards, tying him with Kellen Winslow, Todd Christensen, and Shannon Sharpe for most ever by a tight end, and on December 30, 2007, Gonzalez passed Shannon Sharpe for most receptions all time by a tight end.

In week 4 of the 2008 season, Gonzalez became NFL all-time leader in receiving yards for a tight end with 10,064, surpassing Shannon Sharpe. He recorded 96 receptions for 1,058 yards and was also elected to his tenth career Pro Bowl. For the fifth time in his career, he earned First Team All-Pro honors. Running up to the NFL trade deadline, the Packers and the Eagles were in last minute talks with the Chiefs to trade a third-round draft pick for him. But Chiefs&#x27; GM Carl Peterson said he wanted a second-round draft pick instead and the deal fell through.

During the 2009 offseason, Gonzalez again approached Chiefs management about a possible trade. Unlike the previous Chiefs management, new Chiefs&#x27; GM Scott Pioli told Gonzalez he would see what he could do.

===Atlanta Falcons===

Gonzalez was traded to the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second round pick in the 2010 NFL draft on April 23, 2009. In his first regular season game with Atlanta against the Miami Dolphins, Gonzalez caught a touchdown pass from Matt Ryan and became the 21st player, and the first tight end, in NFL history with 11,000 receiving yards. He finished the game leading the Falcons in receiving with five receptions for 73 yards and one touchdown, his 20-yard touchdown reception marking only the third time he scored in the opening game of the season. Although Gonzalez recorded 83 receptions for 867 yards and 6 touchdowns, his total statistics went down from the previous years in Kansas City, and Gonzalez was not invited to the Pro Bowl for the first time in 10 years. He was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame All-Decade Team for the years 2000–2009.

In the 2010 regular season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Gonzalez made his 1,000th career reception, making him the seventh player in NFL history to do so and the first tight end. Gonzalez had his best performance as a Falcon two weeks later against the defending Super Bowl champions New Orleans Saints, as caught eight catches for 110 yards and a touchdown to help lead Atlanta to an overtime victory. His play in 2010, helped him return to the Pro Bowl that year. The Falcons also finished 13–3 that season to earn the first-seed in the playoffs. In Gonzalez&#x27;s first playoff game in five years, the Falcons were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl champions Green Bay Packers.

During the NFL lockout in 2011, Gonzalez contemplated retiring rather than sitting out an entire season and waiting to play in 2012. After the lockout was eventually lifted by the league, Gonzalez was adamant he had at least three seasons left in him and was excited at the prospects of returning to the Falcons who were widely considered to be Super Bowl contenders. On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011, he was ranked 46th by his fellow players.

In the 2011 season, Gonzalez finished with 80 receptions for 875 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns. He was named to the Pro Bowl and was ranked 53rd among his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.

With Gonzalez&#x27;s contract set to expire following the conclusion of the 2011 season, he signed a 1-year $7 million contract extension with the Falcons on January 1, 2012, indicating his intent to return for at least one season. In the 2012 season opener, Gonzalez played in Arrowhead Stadium against the Chiefs for the first time in his career, which ended with a Falcons&#x27; victory. Gonzalez caught his 100th career touchdown on November 11, 2012, in a week 10 game against the New Orleans Saints, becoming the only tight end in NFL history to catch 100 touchdown passes. Overall, he finished the 2012 season with 93 receptions for 930 receiving yards and eight receiving touchdowns to earn another First Team All-Pro honor and Pro Bowl nomination. On January 13, 2013, Gonzalez won the only playoff game of his career when the Falcons defeated the Seattle Seahawks 30–28. His fellow players ranked him 47th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.

Throughout the 2012 season, he insisted on retiring. However, on March 12, 2013, on his Twitter page, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m happy to say that after speaking with my family, I&#x27;m coming back.&quot; Then, later that day, he posted,&quot;The lure of being on such a great team and organization, along with unbelievable fan support was too good to pass up.&quot;

On March 15, 2013, Gonzalez agreed to re-sign with the Falcons to a two-year, $14 million contract, despite his claim that he would be retiring after the 2013 season. With the retirement of Randy Moss, 37-year-old Gonzalez spent his last season as the NFL&#x27;s active leader in receiving yards. On September 29, against the New England Patriots, he had 12 receptions for a career-high 149 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Gonzalez played his final NFL game against the Carolina Panthers on December 29. He finished his final season with 83 receptions for 859 receiving yards and eight receiving touchdowns. He would later be named a second alternate for the Pro Bowl that season, and was added to the roster when San Francisco 49ers tight end Vernon Davis declined the invitation. It was his 14th and final Pro Bowl appearance, which at the time tied him with Bruce Matthews and Merlin Olsen for the most selections for the game.

===Legacy===
Gonzalez is frequently considered the greatest tight end of all time. During his career, he broke numerous NFL records for tight ends. Only two of his major records have been broken, most career touchdowns and most 1,000 yard seasons by a tight end. Additionally, he also owns several Chiefs team records and at the time of his retirement, he finished in the top 10 in many receiving categories for any position. He finished 5th in yards, 2nd in receptions, and 6th in touchdowns. He ended his career with an active consecutive games with a reception streak of 265 which ran from a game played on November 26, 2000, to his final game on December 29, 2013. He only failed to record a reception in 5 of his 270 games he played, the majority of which occurred his rookie season. In addition to consistently recording catches, Gonzalez also was extremely durable during his career playing 270 of a possible 272 games in his career. On January 26, 2018, the Chiefs announced they would induct Gonzalez into the Chiefs Hall of Fame. He was inducted during halftime of a game during the 2018 season. In his first year of eligibility in 2019, Gonzalez was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was named to the NFL 2000s All-Decade team as well as the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

==Personal life==

In early 2007, Gonzalez suffered a bout of facial paralysis known as Bell&#x27;s palsy. He subsequently experimented with a vegan diet after reading &quot;The China Study&quot;, but he and his nutritionist, Mitzi Dulan, ultimately decided that eating meat occasionally would be best for his performance. Gonzalez only eats organic fruits and vegetables, free-range chicken, grass-fed beef (no more than 18 ounces a month), and fish.

Gonzalez had a commitment ceremony in July 2007 with his girlfriend, October, though the couple considers themselves married despite not being legally married. They have three children together, two daughters and a son. He has another son who was born in 2001 from a relationship with entertainment reporter Lauren Sánchez. He lives in Huntington Beach, California.

On July 3, 2008, while dining with his family at a restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, Gonzalez noticed a fellow diner choking on a piece of meat at a nearby table, unable to breathe. Gonzalez successfully administered the Heimlich maneuver, saving the diner&#x27;s life.

Gonzalez campaigned for then-Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, saying &quot;this is the first time in my life that I&#x27;ve ever been political about anything.&quot;

He was the grand marshal of the 2014 Huntington Beach Fourth of July Parade.

On a season 9 episode of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Gonzalez learned that his great-great-great-grandfather, George, was sold away from his wife Polly and children to a nearby slave owner. In 1866, a year after the end of the Civil War, George and Polly were found listed on a cohabitation record, meaning they had gotten married, as soon as it became legal for them to do so. Gonzalez also learned he is a very distant relative of William Shakespeare and comedian Whoopi Goldberg.

===Other endeavors===
Along with playing in the NFL, Gonzalez has been involved in a number of business ventures. While playing for the Chiefs, he co-founded Extreme Clean 88, a commercial cleaning service in Kansas City. While in Kansas City, Gonzalez also contributed to Shadow Buddies, a charity that works with hospitalized children. Gonzalez, is also an Ambassador for the non-profit, Scholars&#x27; Hope Foundation in Huntington Beach. It is an after-school academic enrichment program that helps students be the best version of themselves and to encourage them into higher education.

In 2009, Gonzalez co-authored the book &quot;The All-Pro Diet&quot;. The book, co-written with Mitzi Dulan, the former nutritionist for the Chiefs, details his diet and workout routine and provides practical suggestions for others to follow the same path.

Later in 2009, Gonzalez co-founded All-Pro Science, a sports nutrition company that manufactured a complete line of protein shakes, vitamins and other supplements. The products in the APS line follow a similar philosophy to the one set forth in Gonzalez&#x27;s book, focusing on a balance of foods from all-natural sources. However, the company&#x27;s website is inactive and its products are unavailable.

From 2013 to 2017, Gonzalez worked with FitStar, a company that makes mobile fitness apps, helping people get in shape with customized workouts delivered via the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. He appears in the FitStar Personal Trainer, leading users through personalized Sessions.

In December 2022, Tony Gonzalez joined the Advisory Council of GoodLeap, a sustainable home improvement fintech company, to support its mission of financing renewable energy solutions and promoting environmental sustainability.

<text>The Hunua Ranges is a mountain range and regional park to the southeast of Auckland city, in the Auckland and Waikato regions of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The ranges cover some and rise to 688 metres (2255 ft) at Kohukohunui.

Auckland Council owns and manages of the ranges, including part located in the Waikato region, as a regional park open to the public.

==Geography==

The ranges are located approximately 50 kilometres (30 mi) southeast of the main Auckland urban area, above the western shore of the Firth of Thames. They are sparsely populated, and mostly lie within the boundaries of the Waharau and Hunua Ranges Regional Parks. The settlement of Hunua lies at the foot of the Hunua Ranges.

The ranges are covered by the largest area of native bush in Auckland, with streams, waterfalls, and hills overlooking the Auckland Region and Hauraki Gulf.

Auckland gets much of its water from reservoirs sources from rivers and streams, including the Hunua Falls on the Wairoa River.

The Mangatawhiri Ridge is one of the last remaining breeding grounds of the North Island kōkako.

=== Kohukohunui ===

Kohukohunui () is the highest point in the Hunua Ranges. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;great mist&quot; for &quot;Kohukohunui&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-European settlement===

Tāmaki Māori have traditionally used the ranges for a wide range of resources. The traditional name is (&quot;The Expansive Forest of Kohukohunui&quot;), named after Kohukohunui, the highest peak of the ranges. was a name used to describe the wider country between the Wairoa River valley and Papakura. Māori made some use of the ranges and early European visitors found areas of clearing that had been used as gardens. Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki are tangata whenua for the ranges, and many archaeological sites are known within the ranges.

In November 1769, Captain Cook visited the Hauraki Gulf area. Cook gifted pigs and potatoes to senior members of Te Uri ō Pou from Ōrere, who then planted these along the Wairoa River, as one of the first crops of potatoes grown in New Zealand. The pigs were released into the Hunua Ranges, where they were hunted by Ngāi Tai.

The main part of the ranges was subject to confiscation after the New Zealand Wars. Early European use of the ranges was for timber extraction and for farming but low soil fertility limited success. There has been some mining of Manganese in the past. Gold prospecting for quartz reefs has never found payable reefs.

===20th century===

From the 1920s onwards the land was progressively bought by Auckland City Council utilising funds from its water supply operation. Development of the water supplies commenced in 1946, with the first of the four dams, Cossey&#x27;s, completed with a capacity of 11.3 million cubic meters in 1956. Three embankment dams were constructed in the area: Upper Mangatawhiri (1965), Wairoa (1975) and Mangatangi (1977). Combined, the dams have a capacity of 77.1 million cubic meters, and supply approximately 68% of Auckland&#x27;s potable water, through the Ardmore Water Treatment Plant.

A decision was made to reforest the ranges in the early 1960s, after the area had gradually reverted into farmland. The bulk water supply operation and the land passed to the newly formed Auckland Regional Authority in 1964. The Authority completed the water supply development and continued the exotic afforestation on some of the north and western catchment land, started by the City Council, and its Water Department administered the land. The ranges were planted with a mix of exotic forest and native species, predominantly rimu. The forestry service nursery was one of the first organisations in New Zealand to propagate native trees through grafting techniques, and were the first to successfully graft kauri trees. The forestry service was shut down in the late 1980s, as the Auckland Regional Authority was replaced with the Auckland Regional Council.

The water operation was corporatised as Watercare Services in 1992, but the land itself remained with the Auckland Regional Council. Watercare took ownership of the water related assets and took a long term lease from the Auckland Regional Council of the reservoir areas and the operational areas. The exotic forestry land was also leased to another party. The catchment land became regional park land.

===21st century===

In November 2010, the southernmost part of the Hunua Ranges were transferred to Waikato region. This determines the local government administrative boundaries, but the ownership of the former Auckland Regional Council park land went to the Auckland Council and that of the water assets is unchanged with Watercare Services.

Extensive flooding in the Hunua Ranges in March 2017 cut off roads. People staying on the ranges had to be evacuated.

In May 2018, parts of the park were closed to stop the spread of Kauri dieback. Some of the tracks reopened in late 2020.

In September and October 2018, the entire park was closed during a 1080 pest control programme. The programme was subject to an unsuccessful legal challenge.

==Recreation==

Activities in the regional park include walking, mountain-biking, bird-watching and drone-flying (by permission).

<text>Geneva Lake (Potawatomi: Kishwauketoe &#x27;Clear Water&#x27;) is a body of freshwater in Walworth County in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Wisconsin. On its shores are the city of Lake Geneva and the villages of Fontana-on-Geneva-Lake and Williams Bay. The lake covers an area of approximately , with a maximum length of , a mean depth of , and a maximum depth of . Geologists believe that it is a filled-in kettle formed from a receding glacier.
==History==
Geneva Lake was home to a band of Prairie Potawatomi prior to colonial settlement. During the first three decades of the nineteenth century, the band was led by Big Foot. This led the settlers on Geneva Lake to refer to it as Big Foot Lake.

In the 1830s, a government surveyor named John Brink renamed the lake and the town on it for Geneva, New York, another lakeside town which he thought they resembled. To avoid confusion with the nearby town of Geneva, Illinois, the city was renamed &quot;Lake Geneva&quot;; later, the lake was renamed &quot;Geneva Lake&quot;.

The lake is known as the only place in the world where mail jumping is practiced, an unusual mail delivery system maintained as a local tradition. 

== Attractions and public access ==
Lakeshore attractions include Big Foot Beach State Park, Lake Geneva Yacht Club, the George Williams College campus of Aurora University, and Yerkes Observatory. The observatory is no longer owned by the University of Chicago, which transferred ownership of it to the non-profit Yerkes Future Foundation in May 2020.

Public access to the lake is allowed as the result of a decision by early European settlers that &quot;20 feet [6 meters] of land leading up to the shoreline should be public domain.&quot;

A shorepath, which is open to the public, completely surrounds the lake. Between long, it follows the route taken by Potawatomi Indians. The path crosses the estates of the Schwinns, Swifts, Wackers, and Wrigleys.

<text>Ana Marie Cox (born September 23, 1972) is a liberal American author, blogger, political columnist, and critic. The founding editor of the political blog &quot;Wonkette&quot;, she was also the Senior Political Correspondent for MTV News, and conducted the &quot;Talk&quot; interviews featured in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; from 2015 to 2017.

In 2010, Cox held the position of Washington correspondent for &quot;GQ&quot;. Cox has been a contributor for The Daily Beast since 2009. She previously worked at Air America Media. She was a lead blogger on U.S. politics for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, until August 2014, and an editor at &quot;Mother Jones&quot;.

==Early life==
Cox was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her family is from Texas and is of Scots-Irish descent. She attended Lincoln Southeast High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, where she wrote for the school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Clarion&quot;. She graduated from the University of Chicago with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1994. She began graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, where she was studying American history, but left school, and instead became an editorial assistant at the publishing company Alfred A. Knopf.

==Career==
Cox was an editor of the progressive online magazine &quot;Bad Subjects&quot;. Later, she was an executive editor of Suck.com, where she wrote under the pen name Ann O&#x27;Tate, a wordplay on &quot;&quot;.

In 2004, Cox became the founding editor of the political blog &quot;Wonkette&quot;. Under her tenure, Wonkette was a sportive commentary on Capitol Hill Washington politics, as well as more serious matters of politics and policy. Cox and Wonkette gained notoriety in the political world for publicizing the story of Jessica Cutler, also known as &quot;Washingtonienne,&quot; a staff assistant to Senator Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) who accepted money from a George W. Bush administration official and others in exchange for sexual favors. On January 5, 2006, Cox officially announced her retirement as the blog&#x27;s editor and her imminent transition to &quot;Wonkette Emerita.&quot;

Cox&#x27;s novel &quot;Dog Days&quot;, a satire of Washington, D.C. life for which she was reportedly paid $250,000, was published on January 6, 2006. The book received generally negative reviews. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Christopher Buckley described it as a &quot;brisk, smart, smutty, knowing and very well-written first novel.&quot; In the &quot;Times&quot; as well, Janet Maslin wrote that despite Cox&#x27;s &quot;satirical expertise,&quot; the novel is replete with &quot;stock characters&quot; and &quot;manages to be doubly conventional: it follows both an old-fashioned love-betrayal-redemption arc and the newer, bitchier nanny-Prada chick-lit motif.&quot; Writing in Slate.com, Toby Young found the novel &quot;shallow.&quot; He continued,

The problem is, once the plot is set in motion, it never really takes flight. &quot;Dog Days&quot; has the makings of an entertaining comic novel, but Cox hasn&#x27;t bothered to master the rudiments of the genre. I kept waiting for the different elements to come to a boil, but if anything, Cox turns down the heat as the story continues.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; adjudged that Cox offers &quot;results that make &quot;Primary Colors&quot; read like Proust&quot; and concluded, &quot;[R]eaders hoping for some real-life dirt (or at least a salacious facsimile) will be dealt nothing more than lightweight fluff and throwaway farce.&quot; In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Diana Wagman wrote, &quot;&quot;Dog Days&quot; is predictable and, worst of all, mean-spirited. ... [It] is chick lit at its most hackneyed.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a novel torn from the day before yesterday&#x27;s headlines,&quot; wrote P.J. O&#x27;Rourke in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

I won&#x27;t spoil the plot. There isn&#x27;t one. ... &quot;Dog Days&quot; is devoid of ideas or even references to ideas ... The people in &quot;Dog Days&quot; spend so much energy on instant-messaging, text-messaging, message-forwarding and such that it&#x27;s no wonder they are too exhausted to have anything to say.

According to&quot; Human Events&quot;, more than a year after its publication the book had sold &quot;a dismal 5,000 copies.&quot;

On July 27, 2006, Cox was named the Washington editor of Time.com, where she also wrote &quot;The Ana Log&quot;.

On April 12, 2007, Cox claimed on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s website that she agreed to appear on the Don Imus radio show despite its history of racially and sexually charged content because she wanted to be considered part of the media elite. Cox wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit that it took Imus&#x27; saying something so devastatingly crass to make me realize that there just was no reason beyond ego to play along. I did the show almost solely to earn my media-elite merit badge.&quot; Cox announced on December 5, 2008, that she would no longer be contributing to &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Swampland blog.

On January 19, 2009, Cox debuted on Air America Media as their first Washington-based national correspondent. She was a frequent guest on &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;, and guest-hosted the show in Maddow&#x27;s absence on September 4, 2009. In 2009, Cox also became a contributing editor for &quot;Playboy&quot;.

The February 17, 2010 episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Top Line&quot; webcast announced that Cox had become the Washington correspondent for &quot;GQ&quot; magazine. Since September 26, 2011, she has worked as a blogger for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

On September 26, 2012, book publisher Penguin Group sued Cox for the return of an $81,250 advance and $50,000 in interest, payment for a humorous book she agreed in 2006 to produce and never provided to the publisher. Penguin canceled the book in 2007 when Cox did not forward a manuscript.

Cox has been a contributor to The Daily Beast since 2009.

In February 2017, Cox launched the podcast &quot;With Friends Like These&quot; as part of the Crooked Media brand. She was also a guest of John Moe on his podcast &quot;The Hilarious World of Depression&quot; at American Public Media, where she talked about depression and being a survivor of “a couple” suicide attempts. In 2019, Cox took over as host of the podcast &quot;The Churn,&quot; SyFy&#x27;s recap and commentary show on &quot;The Expanse.&quot; In 2020, she and co-host Daniel W. Drezner relaunched the podcast independently as &quot;Space the Nation.&quot;

==Personal life==
Cox was married to Chris Lehmann, formerly of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, and &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot;. They divorced in 2011.

On October 11, 2014, Cox announced on Twitter that she was engaged to Minneapolis risk manager John Ramonas. She married Ramonas on New Year&#x27;s Day 2015 in Vermont.

On February 28, 2015, Cox announced in an article in the Daily Beast that she is a Christian.

On December 27, 2016, in honor of Carrie Fisher&#x27;s death, Cox confirmed via Twitter that she has bipolar disorder.

In a 2017 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article, Cox revealed she has been sober since 2011.

Cox has written that she is a “survivor of sexual assault”.

She has said that she is a survivor of “a couple” suicide attempts.

<text>Mary Feik ( ; March 9, 1924June 10, 2016) was an American aviation engineer, mechanic, pilot, instructor and aircraft restorer. She received many awards and honors in her storied career and was a colonel in the Civil Air Patrol.

== Early years ==
She first became interested in aviation at the age of seven when a barnstormer came through her hometown area in a Curtiss JN-4 biplane. She rode in the aircraft and was enthralled.

Feik learned welding by age 11, and overhauled her first automobile engine in her father&#x27;s repair shop when she was 13, then turned to aircraft engines and military aircraft at the age of 18. However, when she tried to enroll in engineering in college, the registrar told her, &quot;We don&#x27;t take women.&quot; She then took a job teaching aircraft maintenance at Seymour Field in Goldsboro, North Carolina. The base was not ready to operate, so she wrote to Wright Field for a position, which was accepted.

== Aviation engineer ==
During World War II, Feik became an expert on many military aircraft, and taught aircraft maintenance for the United States Army Air Corps in 1942. She is credited with becoming the first woman engineer in research and development in the Air Technical Service Command&#x27;s Engineering Division at Wright Field, Ohio.

At a time when men dominated the cockpits of military aircraft, Feik logged more than 6,000 hours as a B-29 flight engineer, engineering observer, and pilot of P-51, P-47, P-63 aircraft. She rapidly transitioned from primary trainers to the P-51 in two and a half weeks. When the Lockheed P-80 entered service, she was issued a brand-new model nicknamed &quot;Mary&#x27;s Little Lamb&quot; in her honor.

While flying a P-59 jet fighter during gunnery training, she witnessed tracer rounds coming within feet of the aircraft&#x27;s nose. &quot;I was the only person to fly open cockpit in a jet airplane ... the airflow over this little windscreen was so great that I think I was off the seat no matter how tightly I was strapped down,&quot; she said. The job of a test engineer was a dangerous one.

Feik also used her expertise to design high-performance and jet fighter pilot transition trainers and aircraft maintenance trainers. The pilot training manuals and technical engineering reports she authored were distributed throughout the Armed Forces. Her deployable rigs allowed aircraft procedures and limits to be tested with running engines on the ground.

== Restorations ==

Mary Feik retired from the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s (NASM) Paul E. Garber Restoration Facility as a Restoration Specialist. She restored antique and classic aircraft and has participated in the construction of reproduction World War I aircraft, helping restore the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s 1910 Wiseman-Cooke aircraft, a WWI Spad XIII fighter, Betty Skelton&#x27;s Little Stinker and a 1930 Northrop &quot;Alpha&quot; mail plane. Feik&#x27;s personal Short Winged Piper is undergoing restoration for donation to an air museum.

==Civil Air Patrol==
Feik was the recipient of a distinguished service award from the CAP for her involvement between 1982 and 2004. Weeks prior to her death, Feik&#x27;s home CAP squadron was officially chartered as the &quot;Colonel Mary S. Feik Composite Squadron&quot;. Members of her squadron presented the official charter and new squadron patch design to Feik at her bedside in Annapolis. She said her &quot;ultimate Honor&quot; was the ribbon named after her.
The achievement that was given her name is the Senior Airman cadet grade. It is the third of the cadet grades.

== Honors ==

A recipient of many aerospace honors, in 1994 Feik was inducted into the Women in Aviation International Pioneer Hall of Fame. On February 24, 1996, she received the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award in recognition of her many outstanding contributions to aviation safety. The award requires the recipient to have actively worked as an aircraft mechanic for at least 50 years. Feik was the first woman to ever receive the award, named for the Wright brothers&#x27; mechanic and engineer.

Mary Feik&#x27;s proudest professional honor was bestowed in 2003. &quot;My ultimate honor is the Civil Air Patrol cadet achievement created in my name.&quot;

== Personal ==
She married Robert Feik June 17, 1950; they remained married for 54 years, until his death in 2004 at the age of 85. She had a daughter named Robin
Feik resided in Annapolis, Maryland. Every year, she gave a speech to cadets from throughout Civil Air Patrol at the National Honor Guard Academy and also to a gathered assembly of basic cadets and staff at the Civil Air Patrol&#x27;s Tri-Wing Encampment, held by Maryland Wing.

Mary Feik died from cancer on June 10, 2016, at her home in Annapolis.

The PA-20 Piper Pacer she once owned is being lovingly restored through the Build a Plane foundation. It is being rebuilt in a high school program in the Metropolitan Washington DC area.

<doc id="1225415" wikidata="Q1960896" url="?curid=1225415" title="Hyper Police">
<text>is a Japanese manga series and written and illustrated by Minoru Tachikawa. It is set in a period in the far future, in which humanity is almost extinct and most of the population are monsters. The series mostly follows the offices of a private police company and focuses on the life of Natsuki Sasahara, a young catgirl, and her co-workers: foxgirl Sakura Bokuseiinmonzeninari, werewolf Batanen Fujioka and his cousin Tomy Fujioka.

The manga was adapted into a 25-episode anime television series animated by Pierrot and directed by Takahiro Omori in 1997.

For many years, the only western language to have official translations of the &quot;Hyper Police&quot; manga was Spanish. English translations have been completed by US company Tokyopop.

== Setting ==
The anime takes place in the year 22 HC (Holy Century), in the Tokyo ward of Shinjuku. Although theoretically about the competition of rival private police corporations (licensed bounty hunting firms) in an Earth where humanity is in danger of extinction, in actuality it focuses more on the lives of the main characters, such as; Natsuki Sasahara, Sakura Bokuseiinmonzeninari, and Batanen Fujioka. The monsters are usually taken from Japanese mythology, updated for the modern era. In the anime, repeat criminal offenders in Tokyo have their memories wiped. However, in the manga version, they are castrated. Mithril exists in this world/setting; it is a sort of specially enchanted silver that is especially effective against supernatural characters.

== Characters ==
Some of the characters in &quot;Hyper Police&quot; are hybrids of human and &quot;monsters&quot;; which occurred during the Holy war when the doorway between the human world and the Monster World opened up, thus allowing humans and monsters to co-exist and interbreed.

; Natsuki Sasahara
:Natsuki is a 17-year-old half-human/half-nekomata. She is the daughter of a human father and a nekomata mother. Natsuki is very sweet and kind to everyone and always eager to help protect the weak and uphold the law. Her personality is very feline; she will eat cat food, grooms herself like a cat, and will play with string and other moving objects (including Sakura&#x27;s tails). Her favorite drink is catnip-milk, which has an alcoholic effect on her. Batanen hired her to join Police Company when he saw her ability to create electrical shocks being put to good use, while she was inadvertently taken hostage by a criminal he was chasing, then proceeded to fry him to a crisp. However, this is also her major problem, since Natsuki is so young, she still has trouble controlling her powers and has been known to spark at random when frightened, frying everything within several meters of her. She is also a dangerously bad shot with a gun and has shot her allies at least twice by accident, thus she only uses a short dagger as her melee weapon of choice. When angry or scared, her tail temporarily splits in two. She prides herself on owning an orihalcon blade, and is in control of two &quot;parasites&quot;, which is unusual for the setting; even having one is considered to be powerful. As of volume nine, it has been revealed that she is the daughter of the Ancient Egyptian goddess Bast.

:Note that she has 2 sets of ears, human normal position and feline on the top sides of her head.

; Parasites
: These magical familiars are able to focus their owner&#x27;s magical energy and turn it into electricity. The names of Natsuki&#x27;s parasites are Fujin and Raijin (named after the Japanese gods of wind and thunder). Sakura has one too, but it is rarely seen. In the manga, it was revealed in volume seven, that Fujin and Raijin were engagement &quot;rings&quot; from a prince in china, but due to misunderstandings through Natsuki&#x27;s father&#x27;s translator, Natsuki was unaware she was engaged.

; Bob
: Bob is Natsuki&#x27;s super intelligent pet bobtail cat. He is older than she is, and thus is her legal guardian when her human father is away on his archaeological digs.

; Sakura Bokuseiinmonzeninari
: Sakura is a kitsune (fox spirit) and Natsuki&#x27;s partner for a time. Though she is 191 years old, she claims that she looks to be only 19. She has human ancestors, thus she was born with only 8 and 1/5 tails and was teased as a child, because of it. Kitsune must have a full nine tails in order to have full use of their power, thus Sakura has spent many years hunting for a powerful being to consume, in order to attain that full power. Sakura joins the Police Company after seeing Natsuki in action, in hopes of consuming her, in order to gain her full ninth tail. She can fly, has some minor electrical power and is an excellent shot with a gun. Sakura is from Osaka, thus has a knack for bartering and handling money. Later on she gives birth to three mischievous kids from her mating with the time-displaced samurai Sakunoshin, by episode 17. Justifying the age-old lore of a kitsune being a mother and housewife. It is not completely clarified if the two are officially married or not though, Sakura&#x27;s mother is seen to ask her at one point &quot;when are you two coming to Osaka to get married?&quot;

; Sakunoshin Chikura
: Sakunoshin is a displaced samurai from Japan&#x27;s Tenshō era, who ended up in the Holy Era due to Natsuki&#x27;s power surges that unbeknownst to her have been opening up temporary time portals in various parts of the city. When he first arrives, he mistakes Sakura for his love, ninja Kasumi. Later, when he realizes that Sakura is not Kasumi, he falls in love with her. It is revealed in the anime that Kasumi may be Sakura&#x27;s direct ancestor. Sakunoshin is very calm and even tempered, though in battle he becomes extremely fierce and deadly, and is able to best even experienced monster fighters. He has an entire kit of samurai armor, along with his katana, equipment, and a set of Japanese smoking pipes (only seen in the manga). In the manga, Sakunoshin is often apprehensive of his wife&#x27;s romantic advances, as they humorously leave him extremely exhausted. Still, he loves her very much and sets out on an epic journey in search of a cure, when Sakura is affected by magic weapons in later issues. Being human, he and his family are awarded food, clothing and housing from the government.

:Sakunoshin is a very skilled swordsman and to her horror, has even sliced through Natsuki&#x27;s orihalcon Blade.

; Batanen Fujioka
: Batanen is a 35-year-old werewolf, and a senior officer at Police Company, as well as the top earner. He is very protective of Natsuki and often acts as a big brother figure to her. He is secretly in love with her and despite being somewhat of a lecher, Batanen is very shy and unsure of himself when it comes to making a move on Natsuki, thus she is totally unaware of his feelings for her. However, he also seems hesitant to make a move even when (for various reasons) Natsuki is trying to be flirty with him. His abilities are quick regeneration (when injured, he becomes fully healed by the next full moon) and near-immortality, as well as being a competent detective and an excellent shot. In the manga, he is always called by his first name, but in the Japanese version of the anime, most everyone refers to him as &quot;senpai&quot; (senior). At the end of the manga he and Natsuki are married.

:Batanen has a large collection of guns in his apartment and is usually portrayed as carrying what looks like a Magnum Research Desert Eagle (only much larger).

; Tommy Fujioka (Tomy in the manga)
: Tommy is Batanen&#x27;s cousin and partner only a year older than Natsuki. Unlike his cousin Batanen, Tommy has the appearance of an anthropomorphic wolf. Although somewhat naive, he is honest and quite skilled, with his specialty being information gathering. He is very adept at problem solving and is skilled in computer systems and possesses a large knowledge of varying subjects (he has demonstrated he can tell when a katana was made just by looking at it). He later falls in love with the human spirit-summoner Peau and being inexperienced in love, comes on a bit too strong. He apparently has a kink for being servile and tries to get Peau to pander to this. He bought her a pair of scarlet slippers and said &quot;Please take these as a gesture of my feelings and step all over me!&quot; By the end of the series, he marries Peau and they have nineteen offspring.

: Tommy carries a rather nondescript gun in the manga, but carries a German Walther P38 in the anime. He is also deeply and madly in love with Peau and is probably the most stable person of the cast.

; Samansa Grey (Samantha)
: Samansa is an oni with huge Coke-bottle-lens glasses who works as a secretary for Chief Mudagami, even after the company goes bankrupt. She is a computer and information gathering expert, with a talent of predicting the future with her tarot cards. In the manga, she is virtually non-existent until the company goes under, at which point, she reveals herself as a shrewd businesswoman. She is somewhat manipulative and loves money above all else. She founds the Grey Company—a sort of spiritual successor to the Police Company.

; Naoko Kondo
: Naoko is one of the few humans in Police Company, she initially hates all non-humans due to the fact that a monster killed her parents when she was a child. Natsuki helps her overcome this hatred when she saved her life, by killing the same monster that killed her parents. She still feels vulnerable when fighting monsters, yet compensates for her lack of supernatural powers by being a crack shot and weapons expert, most likely brought on by her deep desire to avenge the death of her parents. She is much more relevant in the manga then in the anime.

; Mudagami
: Mudagami is a minor god (immortal, able to teleport, and able to notice changes in the nature of reality). He is the chief of Police Company until it goes bankrupt. He is a small man with long kinky black hair and a thin mustache. He often complains about not being taken seriously and remarks that his wife runs his life.

; Nupu
: Nupu is an anthropomorphic lion working for Police Company. He is a senior officer at Police Company and Batanen&#x27;s best friend. He speaks with a British accent in the English version.

; Peau D&#x27;Roquefort (Poe D&#x27;Roquefort in the manga)
: Peau is a water mage working for the state police. She is 24 years old and has a very aloof and impersonal businesslike attitude. The common police robots are under her control and she has the ability to conjure various ice and water spirits (such as waterspouts and trapping suspects in blocks of ice). She too is human, born of European parents. At first Peau is easily disturbed by Tommy&#x27;s methods of wooing her, yet with time and patience, sometime at the end of volume six. She warms up to the young werewolf and they become friends (the manga has them taking their relationship much further, as Poe has feared being pregnant with Tommy&#x27;s child by the end of volume eight. In the final volume, they finally get married and have 19 children).

: In an important moment towards the end of the manga, Peau comments that without Tommy her heart &quot;would turn to ice.&quot; Tommy is responsible for &#x27;melting&#x27; her icy exterior.

; Makoto and Ayami Tachibana
: Makoto and Ayami are the husband-and-wife team that run the Lamp (Ranpo) Café. They act as confidants to Natsuki, with Makoto playing the kind, yet concerned businessman and Ayami the sweet generous sister. In the manga, Ayami becomes pregnant around the same time as Sakura, though she doesn&#x27;t give birth until later on.
:

; Fonne Walkure
: Fonne is very different in the manga and anime. She is of European descent and is an officer from the MAD Police Corporation owned by her rich father. In the anime, she is extremely prejudiced against all monsters and is largely an unsympathetic character. She especially goes out of her way to irritate and humiliate the easily provoked Sakura. She comes across as being very cold and cruel in the anime. However, in the manga, she is much more complex. In the anime, at one point Tommy saves her life and as a result, she develops a crush on him, thus, for a short time, competing for his love, with Peau. In the manga, she has a boyfriend named Yoshikawa. And while she is somewhat cold, she is later shown doing charity work at an orphanage for monster children.

: She has so far kept her actions within the bounds of the law and carefully watches for one of her &quot;fellow&quot; non-human bounty hunters to cross the line. She pilots an F-Elf class VTOL aircraft. In the anime, she carries, what looks like some sort of truncated lever-action rifle, like a handgun.

; Chief Tendo
: He is an oni creature with a massive red head that comprises most of his body. He yells, rather than speaks and his whole head bobs up and down when he does so. He works for the Police Company and later the Gray Company in the manga. He likes to cook and knows a lot about preparing fish.

; Rai Rai
: A character that is only seen in the manga. She appears after the formal formation of the Police company. Initially, she appears to be a catgirl, but she has a short fluffy tail and ears that are larger and droopier then Natsuki&#x27;s- leading to her possibly being some sort of canine creature. She has platinum blond hair that is very fluffy and sticks out. She has no major skills, but later becomes fast friends with Natsuki- the two of them get their own storyline in volume nine of the manga. She also may be one of the only people who seriously thinks of Natsuki as a superior officer. It is worth noting that an unnamed character who bears a striking resemblance to Rai Rai does make an appearance in episode 23. She has a similar hairstyle, the same ears and even salutes Natsuki as superior officer, as she passes by.

; Mao
: A cat girl and member of the feline patrol, in episode 19.

<doc id="1225417" wikidata="Q5203325" url="?curid=1225417" title="D-loop replication">
<text>D-loop replication is a proposed process by which circular DNA like chloroplasts and mitochondria replicate their genetic material. An important component of understanding D-loop replication is that many chloroplasts and mitochondria have a single circular chromosome like bacteria instead of the linear chromosomes found in eukaryotes. However, many chloroplasts and mitochondria have a linear chromosome, and D-loop replication is not important in these organelles. Also, not all circular genomes use D-loop replication as the process of replicating its genome.

In many organisms, one strand of DNA in the plasmid comprises heavier nucleotides (relatively more purines: adenine and guanine). This strand is called the H (heavy) strand. The L (light) strand comprises lighter nucleotides (pyrimidines: thymine and cytosine). Replication begins with replication of the heavy strand starting at the D-loop (also known as the control region). A D-loop is a short portion in circular DNA that has three strands instead of two. The middle strand, which is complementary to the light strand, displaces the heavy strand and forms a displacement loop (D-loop). Circular DNA is stable with this small D-loop and can remain in this formation, but the middle strand, or the displacing strand, is replaced frequently due to its short half-life, and is very energetically expensive to the cell. When diagramed, the resulting structure looks like the letter D. The D-loop was first discovered in 1971 when researchers noticed that many DNA in the mitochondria they were examining under microscope contained a short segment that was tripled stranded.

==Replication process==
Each D-loop contains an origin of replication for the heavy strand. Full circular DNA replication is initiated at that origin and replicates in only one direction. The middle strand in the D-loop can be removed and a new one will be synthesized that is not terminated until the heavy strand is fully replicated, or the middle strand can serve as a primer for the heavy strand replication. As the heavy strand replication reaches the origin of replication for the light strand, a new light strand will be synthesized in the opposite direction as the heavy strand. There is more than one proposed process through which D-loop replication occurs, but in all of the models, these steps are agreed upon. The portions not agreed upon are what is the importance of maintaining a D-loop when replication is not in progress, because it is energetically expensive to the cell, and what mechanisms, during replication, preserve the detached strand of DNA that is waiting to be replicated.

==Importance==
The D-loop region is important for phylogeographic studies. Because the region does not code for any genes, it is not imperative for this region to remain conserved over time, therefore, it is free to mutate with only a few selective limitations on size and heavy/light strand factors. The mutation rate is among the fastest of anywhere in either the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes in animals. Using these mutations in the D-loop, recent and rapid evolutionary changes can effectively be tracked such as within species and among very closely related species. Due to the high mutation rate, it is not effective in tracking evolutionary changes that are not recent. This is a very common use of the D-loop in genomics.

One example of the use of D-loop mutations in phylogeographic studies was the phylogeny assembled using the highly unstudied red deer on the Iberian peninsula. Scientist tracked the D-loop polymorphisms within these red deer and determined the genetic relationship that these deer had among each other. They were also able to determine the relationships, based on D-loop similarities and differences, between these red deer and other deer throughout Europe. In another example, scientist used the variations in the D-loop, along with microsatellite markers, to study and map out the genetic diversity among goats in Sri Lanka.

<text>Settlement of the city of Rochester in western New York State began in the late 18th century, and the city flourished with the opening of the Erie Canal. It became a major manufacturing center, and attracted many Italians, Germans, Irish and other immigrants, as well as a dominant group of Yankees of New England origin. The Yankees made Rochester the center of multiple reform movements, such as abolitionism and women&#x27;s rights. It was famous as the center of the American photography industry and the headquarters of Eastman Kodak. In the 1970s it became fashionable to use the term &quot;Rust Belt&quot; for the industrial cities along the Great Lakes following the move away from steel, chemical and other hard goods manufacturing. Rochester, with the presence of Ritter-Pfaudler, Bausch and Lomb, Eastman Kodak, Xerox, Gannett and other major industries, defied the trend for many decades following World War II.

Of the 19 places in the United States named &quot;Rochester&quot;, at least 8 were named directly after the city, having been founded or settled by former residents. These include: Rochester, Indiana; Rochester, Texas; Rochester, Iowa; Rochester, Kentucky; Rochester, Michigan; Rochester, Minnesota; Rochester, Nevada; and Rochester, Ohio.

==Early settlement==
Following the American Revolution, western New York was opened up for development as soon as New York and Massachusetts compromised and settled their competing claims for the area in December 1786 by the Treaty of Hartford. The compromise was that, while New York would have political sovereignty over the land, Massachusetts would have pre-emptive rights to obtain title from the Native Americans and own (and profit from selling) the land.

=== Phelps and Gorham purchase ===

On April 1, 1788, after extensive machinations by various speculators, Massachusetts&#x27; pre-emptive right over all western New York Lands — comprising some 6,000,000 acres (24,000 km2) — was sold to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham, both of Massachusetts. The sales price was $1,000,000, payable in three equal annual installments of certain Massachusetts securities then worth about 20 cents on the dollar. The right sold applied to all land west of a line running from the mouth of Sodus Bay on Lake Ontario, due south through Seneca Lake, to the 82nd milestone on the Pennsylvania border near Big Flats (the &quot;Pre-emption Line&quot;), and all the way to the Niagara River and Lake Erie (the &quot;Phelps and Gorham Purchase&quot;). In order to obtain title to such land, Phelps and Gorham would have to extinguish all Native American titles.

When the land did not sell as well as they had hoped, Phelps and Gorham were unable to come up with the funds to extinguish the Native American titles. They defaulted on their second payment in 1790. They lost the right to buy the pre-emptive rights to remaining lands of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase west of the Genesee River. This land, about 3,750,000 acres (15,000 km2), reverted to Massachusetts. The state immediately re-sold the pre-emptive rights to Robert Morris in 1791 for $333,333.33 (about $ today). In 1792 and 1793, Morris sold most of the lands west of the Genesee to the Holland Land Company, but he did not extinguish Native American title to the land until the Treaty of Big Tree in September, 1797. Morris reserved for himself a 500,000 acre (2,000 km2) strip approximately wide and extending from Lake Ontario to the Pennsylvania border along the eastern edge of the Holland Purchase, known as the Morris Reserve. At the north end of the Reserve, Morris sold an 87,000 acre (350 km2) triangular shaped tract (&quot;The Triangle Tract&quot;) to Herman Leroy, William Bayard and John McEvers, and he also sold a 100,000 tract due west of the Triangle Tract to the state of Connecticut. Additional Phelps and Gorham lands east of the Genesee River which had not previously been sold, were acquired by Robert Morris in 1791, who re-sold them to The Pulteney Association, a syndicate of British investors.

=== Mill Yard Tract ===

Before defaulting on the rest of the land purchase agreement, Phelps and Gorham gave a 100-acre (0.4 km2) lot within the Mill Yard Tract at the Upper Falls of the Genesee to Ebenezer &quot;Indian&quot; Allen, on condition he build a grist mill and sawmill there by summer 1789 (the &quot;100 Acre Tract&quot;). In exchange for the Tract, Allen built the agreed-upon mills at the west end of the Upper Falls of the Genesee. But the location was so deep in the wilderness that there were only 14 men in the area to assist in the mill&#x27;s construction. The area was a dense forest and swamp, and infested with rattlesnakes and mosquitoes that spread &#x27;Swamp Fever&#x27; or what we now call malaria.

In March 1792, with no settlers and no demand for mills, Indian Allen sold the Tract to Benjamin Barton Sr. of New Jersey for $1,250. Barton almost immediately resold the property to Samuel Ogden, an agent for Robert Morris. Ogden, in turn, sold the property in 1794 to Charles Williamson, agent for The Pulteney Association. On November 8, 1803, The Pulteney Association sold the Tract for $1,750, on a five-year land contract, to Col. Nathaniel Rochester (1752–1831), Maj. Charles Carroll, and Col. William Fitzhugh, all of Hagerstown, Maryland.

==Rochesterville and The Flour City==

Rochester was dominated by ethnocultural politics. Two rival groups fought for power, the Presbyterian Yankees from New England, and the Episcopalian New Yorkers from New York and Pennsylvania. When Irish Catholics started to arrive in large numbers in the 1840s and supported the Democrats, the two Protestant groups stopped feuding and presented a common front.Col. Rochester and his two partners allowed the millsite to lie undeveloped until 1811, when they finally completed paying for their purchase and received the deed. The population of the area was 15. They then had the tract surveyed and laid out with streets and lots. The first lot was sold to a Henry Skinner, at what is now the northwest corner of State and Main. In 1817, other land owners, mainly the Brown Brothers (of Brown&#x27;s Race and Brown&#x27;s Square), joined their lands north to the Tract, to form the Village of Rochesterville, with a population of 700.

In 1821, Monroe County was formed out of parts of Ontario and Genesee counties, and Rochesterville was named the county seat. A two-story brick courthouse in the Greek Revival style was built at a cost of $7,600. In 1823, property of Elisha Johnson on the east side of the Genesee across from the Tract was annexed, bringing Rochesterville to 1,012 acres (4.1 km2) and the population to about 2,500. That year, &quot;-ville&quot; was dropped from the city&#x27;s name. This was also the year that the first 800-foot (244 m) Erie Canal Aqueduct was finished over the Genesee, just south of the Main Street Bridge. It was built over 16 months by 30 convicts from Auburn State Prison. In 1822, the Rochester Female Charitable Society was founded. Members paid twenty-five cents per year to belong to the Society and also contributed provisions, clothing, and bedding which they collected from the community. Visitors distributed the goods and money to the poor of each district. By 1872, seventy-three districts had been established, each with a woman visitor. That organization was instrumental in founding the Rochester Orphan Asylum (now Hillside Children&#x27;s Center), the Rochester City Hospital (now Rochester General Hospital), the first school, the workhouse, the Home for the Friendless (now The Friendly Home), the Industrial School, and The Visiting Nurse Service.
Soon after the Erie Canal east to the Hudson River was opened in 1825, the economy and population grew quickly. By 1830, the population reached 9,200, and the city became the original boomtown first known as &quot;The Young Lion of the West.&quot; It quickly, however, became known as the Flour City, based on the numerous flour mills which were located along waterfalls on the Genesee in what is now the Brown&#x27;s Race area of downtown Rochester. The first ten days the canal was open east to the Hudson, 40,000 barrels (3,600 tons) of Rochester flour were shipped to Albany and New York City. Local millers soon were grinding 25,000 bushels of wheat daily. In 1829, the Rochester Athenaeum was founded as a reading society. The Athenaeum charged members a five-dollar annual fee to hear lectures by some of America&#x27;s best-known orators including Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Horace Greeley and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The Athenaeum was one of the forerunners of the Rochester Institute of Technology.

In 1830 and 1831, Rochester experienced one of the largest Protestant revivals of the Second Great Awakening, led by Charles Grandison Finney. A leading pastor in New York, who was converted in the Rochester meetings, gave this account of Finney&#x27;s meetings there: The whole community was stirred. Religion was the topic of conversation in the house, in the shop, in the office, and on the street. The only theater in the city was converted into a livery stable; the only circus into a soap and candle factory. Grog shops were closed; the Sabbath was honored; the sanctuaries were thronged with happy worshippers; a new impulse was given to every philanthropic enterprise; the fountains of benevolence were opened, and men lived to good.

By 1834, some 20 flour mills were producing 500,000 barrels (44,000 t) annually, the population reached 13,500 and the city area expanded to 4,000 acres (16 km2). Rochester was then re-chartered as a city, and Jonathan Child, son-in-law of Col. Rochester, was elected its first mayor.

In 1837, the Rochester Orphan Asylum was founded by the Rochester Female Charitable Society. The Asylum was located on South Sophia Street (now South Plymouth Avenue) and later moved to Hubbell Park. After a tragic fire on January 8, 1901, the Asylum was moved to Pinnacle Hill, reconstructed as a series of cottages called the Hillside Home (now Hillside Children&#x27;s Center, part of Hillside Family of Agencies). The Charitable Society also founded Rochester City Hospital on Buffalo Street (now West Main Street), where the old Buffalo Street Cemetery was located. Construction on the hospital began in 1845 but it was not occupied until 1863. By 1838 Rochester was the largest flour-producing city in the world.

==The Flower City==

In 1830, William A. Reynolds started his first seed business at the corner of Sophia and Buffalo Streets (now South Plymouth Avenue and West Main Street). This was the start of what would become the Ellwanger &amp; Barry Nursery Co., which eventually was relocated to Mt. Hope Avenue, across from Mount Hope Cemetery. James Vick and Joseph Harris also start their own nursery businesses. Vick used innovative mass marketing and regular customer correspondence to build one of the most respected seed companies in the United States. His extensive flower garden on East Avenue was a showplace and weekend destination for local residents. The location of the garden is now bounded by Vick Park A and Vick Park B. The population in 1830 was only 9,207, but it still ranked as the 25th largest city in the United States. In 1840, the population and rank were 20,191 and 19th, respectively. In 1842, the original aqueduct over the Genesee River was replaced with a better one slightly south of the first one. This latter aqueduct now supports Broad Street.

By 1850, the population reached 36,000, making it the 21st largest city in the United States. Westward expansion had moved the focus of farming to the Great Plains and Rochester&#x27;s importance as the center for flour milling had declined. Several seed companies in Rochester had grown to become the largest in the world, with Ellwanger &amp; Barry Nursery Co. the largest. Rochester&#x27;s nickname was changed from the Flour City to the Flower City. In 1850, the University of Rochester was founded in the U. S. Hotel on Buffalo St, and affiliated with the Baptist Church. Two four-year courses were offered. In 1851, due to Rochester and Monroe County&#x27;s tremendous growth, a new three-story county courthouse in the Greek Revival style was constructed. It was built from brick manufactured at Cobb&#x27;s Hill by Gideon Cobb, and cost $76,000.

==Abolition movement==
Rochester was the home for many years of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, a formerly enslaved African American, who in 1847 commenced publishing an abolitionist newspaper, &quot;The North Star&quot;, in Rochester. Other prominent abolitionists in Rochester included Amy and Isaac Post and Abigail Bush.

Douglass stated &quot;I know of no place in the Union where I could have located at the time with less resistance, or received a larger measure of sympathy and cooperation.&quot; However, on his arrival, he found &quot;barriers erected against colored people in most places of instruction and amusement in the city, and until I went there they were imposed without any apparent sense of injustice and wrong.&quot; His daughter could not take classes with white girls. &quot;The city felt no love for the negro, and although there were few of the race in Rochester, they were carefully segregated.&quot; Rochester&#x27;s public schools were desegregated in 1856, following a boycott campaign by local African-American families.

Douglass delivered his fiery speech &quot;The Meaning of July Fourth to the Negro&quot; at a meeting organized by the Rochester Ladies Antislavery Association at Corinthian Hall, Rochester, on July 5, 1852. In 1857, Susan B. Anthony and William Lloyd Garrison spoke at an abolition meeting. In October, 1858, William H. Seward, a leading opponent of slavery, delivered a speech to an overflowing Republican crowd in Corinthian Hall. He argued that the political and economic systems of North and South were incompatible, famously saying that the &quot;irrepressible conflict&quot; between the two systems would eventually result in the nation becoming &quot;either entirely a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation.&quot;

===The Underground Railroad===
In the years leading up to the Civil War, numerous locations in the Rochester area were used as safe houses to shelter fugitive slaves before they were placed on board boats (often on the Genesee River) for transport to Canada. The route was part of the famous Underground Railroad. Other &quot;stations&quot; were located in the areas surrounding Rochester, including Brighton, Pittsford, Mendon, and Webster. A station in North Chili, just west of Rochester, run by abolitionist Methodists was an important site in the formation of the Free Methodist Church, which was formed in 1860. The denomination&#x27;s first college, Roberts Wesleyan College, was built on the site.

One contemporary described the Frederick Douglass homes as &quot;a labyrinth of secret panels and closets, where he secreted the poor human wretches from the man hunters and the blood-hounds, who were usually not far behind.&quot;

==Women&#x27;s rights movement==
Rochester was involved with women&#x27;s rights from an early date. The Rochester Women&#x27;s Rights Convention, which met on August 2, 1848, was the second such convention in the nation. (The first was the Seneca Falls Convention, which met two weeks earlier in Seneca Falls, a town not far away.) The Rochester convention elected a woman as its presiding officer, a highly controversial step at the time that was opposed even by some of the meeting&#x27;s leading participants. This convention was the first public meeting composed of both men and women in the U.S. to take that step.

Susan B. Anthony, a national leader of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, was from Rochester. In a case that generated a national controversy, she was arrested for illegally voting in Rochester in 1872 along with fourteen other local women. Her trial, United States v. Susan B. Anthony, was held in a federal circuit court presided over by a Supreme Court justice. When the judge directed the jury to deliver a guilty verdict and ordered Anthony to pay a fine of $100, Anthony responded, &quot;I shall never pay a dollar of your unjust penalty&quot;, and she never did. As a young woman, she was widely ridiculed for her views on women&#x27;s rights, but she was increasingly respected as the nation began to take her ideas seriously. She celebrated her eightieth birthday at the White House at the invitation of President William McKinley. The Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guaranteed the right of women to vote in 1920, was popularly known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment because of her decades of work toward its passage, which she did not live to see. Anthony&#x27;s home is now a National Historic Landmark known as the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House.

Despite the activism of Anthony and others, women&#x27;s suffrage remained a contentious issue in Rochester, and the city voted against an amendment to the state constitution which gave women the franchise in 1917.

==Post-war industrial boom==

The period 1860 to 1900 saw Rochester grow from a city of 48,000 to a city of 162,800, with a 1900 rank of 24th largest in population, down from 18th in 1860. During this period the city expanded dramatically in area on both sides of the Genesee River, as well as annexing parts of the towns of Brighton, Gates, Greece and Irondequoit. Also founded during this period were Bausch &amp; Lomb by John Jacob Bausch and Henry Lomb, Eastman Kodak by George Eastman, Western Union Telegraph by Hiram Sibley and Don Alonzo Watson, Gleason Works by William Gleason, and R.T. French Company by Robert French. Other important industries that developed during this period were clothing manufacturing, shoe manufacturing, brewing and machine tools. In 1875, Rochester&#x27;s first city hall opened at Fitzhugh and the Erie Canal (now Broad Street). It was built at a cost of over $335,000 on the site of the First Presbyterian Church, which had burned to the ground in 1869. The church sold the lot to the city for $25,000. This city hall housed city government until 1978.

In 1882, the tolls on the Erie Canal ended, with New York State enjoying a profit of $51,000,000 over the 57 years. In September 1885, a group of Rochester businessmen founded the Mechanics Institute to establish &quot;free evening schools in the city for instruction in drawing and such other branches of studies as are most important for industrial pursuits of great advantage to our people.&quot; Henry Lomb of Bausch &amp; Lomb was the Mechanics Institute&#x27;s first president.
During this period many of Rochester&#x27;s great public parks were laid out, with Ellwanger &amp; Barry and others donating land in 1871 for Maplewood Park and in 1889 for Highland Park. In 1895, George Eastman and James P. B. Duffy donated an additional 120 acres (0.5 km2) for Highland Park. On Independence Day, 1894, community leaders, responding to the continued tremendous growth in Rochester and Monroe County, laid the cornerstone for the third County Courthouse (now the County Office Building). Two years and $881,000 later, the four-story granite and marble courthouse in the Italian Renaissance style was complete. In 1897, the first master&#x27;s degrees were awarded by the University of Rochester and in 1900, due largely to the efforts of Susan B. Anthony, women were admitted.

In 1891, the Mechanics Institute merged with the Rochester Athenaeum to form the Rochester Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute (RAMI). Comprehensive instruction in mechanical subjects was RAMI&#x27;s hallmark. The institute&#x27;s builders responded to both industrial and societal trends in Rochester, and each year the Institute graduated increasing numbers of expertly trained professionals who found work in industry both in Rochester and elsewhere.

By the middle of the 1890s no less than five freight and passenger railroads were servicing the city and each had a separate station. This provided Rochester with ample transportation but services continued to expand with the arrival of inter-urban electric railroads such as the Rochester, Lockport and Buffalo Railroad and the Rochester, Syracuse and Eastern Rapid Railroad which began to service Rochester during the early 20th century. The Lehigh Valley Railroad&#x27;s station and the former Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway terminal are the only surviving stations built by these railroads.

In addition, Rochester was home of the Cunningham automobile, a pioneering vehicle produced by carriage maker James Cunningham, Son and Company. Like many early companies, production was small, only about 400 units a year, including hearses, all designed by Volney Lacey.

==The 20th century==
The turn of the century found Rochester a thriving and comfortable city. Although the nursery business was waning, some of that land had been converted into desirable residential districts along East Avenue, Park Avenue, and off Mount Hope Avenue near Highland Park. In 1901, a devastating fire killed 31 at the Rochester Orphan Asylum, and it moved across town from Hubbell Park to Pinnacle.

Because of the highly skilled labor force Rochester enjoyed, the city became a significant industrial contributor to the World War II effort, while the farms and fields surrounding Rochester provided food for the troops as well as the home front. To recognize specialized professional nature of its programs, in 1944, the Rochester Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute changed its name to The Rochester Institute of Technology.

In 1904, R. T. French sent prepared mustard to the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair, where it was paired with another innovation — the hot dog — and became a hit.

In the early 1900s, both George Eastman and Andrew Carnegie gave substantial sums to the University of Rochester. Eastman also donated the funds to establish the Eastman Dental Dispensary. In 1908, Francis Baker donated 120 acres (0.5 km2) for Genesee Valley Park, and Durand-Eastman Park opens, a gift of Henry Durand and George Eastman.

In 1913, the Memorial Art Gallery on the University of Rochester&#x27;s Prince Street Campus was founded. It was the gift of Emily Sibley Watson as a memorial to her son, architect James Averell. In 1918, the Erie Canal through Rochester was closed and abandoned after the Barge Canal opened, transiting Rochester through Genesee Valley Park. The Court Street Dam was also built in 1918 to raise the level of the river to that of the Barge Canal so no aqueduct or locks are necessary, but in so doing the Upper Falls and the Castelton Rapids were obliterated.

By 1920, Rochester&#x27;s population had reached 290,720, and it ranked 23rd largest in the United States. That year, the city purchased the abandoned Erie Canal lands inside city limits for use as a heavy rail mass transit and freight system. In 1921, the first Lilac Week occurred, celebrating Rochester&#x27;s floral legacy in Highland Park. In 1922, Rochester&#x27;s first radio station began broadcasting, and the Eastman Theatre opened, an adjunct to the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester. In 1925, George Eastman arranged a land swap with Oak Hill Country Club. The Oak Hill property, just west of Mt. Hope Cemetery on the east side of the Genesee River was given to the University of Rochester for its River Campus, and the country club moved to its present site in Pittsford. In 1925, the university opened its Medical School and Strong Memorial Hospital on Crittenden Road, and by 1927, general construction had begun on the River Campus. It was also in 1925 that the university awarded its first Ph.D., and by 1930, several departments were training candidates for the doctorate. In 1928, Red Wing Stadium opened. That year, the Rochester &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot;, the morning newspaper, was purchased by Frank Gannett.

By the 1920s and 1930s, Rochester&#x27;s population was roughly half Protestant and half Catholic, although a significant Jewish population was also present. In 1938, the city had 214 religious congregations, two-thirds of which had been founded after 1880. At that time, the city added, on average, 2.6 new congregations per year, many founded by immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. During peak immigration from 1900 to 1920, dozens of churches were established, including four Roman Catholic churches with Italian clergy, three Roman Catholic churches with Slavic clergy, a Greek Orthodox Church, a Polish Baptist church, 15 Jewish synagogues, and four small Italian Protestant mission churches (Baptist, Evangelical, Methodist, and Presbyterian).

By 1930, the population had swelled to 328,132, making Rochester the 22nd largest city in the United States. The University of Rochester opened its River Campus for men, and the Prince Street Campus became the Women&#x27;s Campus. The Rochester Municipal Airport opened on Scottsville Road. It was in the 1930s that Eastman Kodak introduced Kodachrome® film. By now the subway was constructed in the old canal bed, and the street railways were diverted to the subway or morphed into buses. From 1927 until 1956, Rochester was the smallest city in America with a subway. Rochester celebrated its centennial as a city in 1934. In 1936, the Rundel Memorial Building opened as the headquarters of the Rochester Public Library above the bed of the old Erie Canal, adjacent to South Avenue, between Broad Street and Court Street.

By 1940, the population had decreased to 324,975, the first drop since Rochester was founded. It was still the 23rd largest city in the United States. With the advent of World War II, some 29,000 Rochester-area men were drafted into military service.

During the war, Cobbs Hill Park was used as a Prisoner of War camp. The first POWs arrived September 28, 1943. Sixty Italian prisoners worked on area farms and food processing plants 10 hours a day, six days a week, at $0.80 per day. After Italy capitulated to the Allies October 12, 1943, and joined the war against Germany the Italian POW&#x27;s became unguarded internees. The Italians were replaced at Cobbs Hill with German POWS June 26, 1944. The city was hit in February 1945 with seven successive snowstorms that paralyzed the city, forcing the city to ask that POWs be brought from the Hamlin Camp to the city. Cobbs Hill Park housed 100 Germans, while 175 more were at Edgerton Park. Snow removal by prisoners was done at unannounced locations, with city police guarding the POWs.

Following the war, the &quot;Rochester Plan&quot; called for the development of quality, low rent housing for veterans returning from World War II and their families. Three garden apartment complexes were built as part of the Rochester Plan: Fernwood Park, Norton Village, and Ramona Park.

===1945-1999===

By 1950, the population of the city had grown slightly to 332,488, but Rochester was now only the 32nd largest city in the United States. During the 1950s, Xerox Corporation (originally Haloid Corporation) expanded as it exploited Chester Carlson&#x27;s xerography patents. Xerox went on to become the world leader in xerographic imaging, designing and manufacturing many of its famous products in the Rochester area. Eastman Kodak continued to dominate the film and camera industry and was Rochester&#x27;s leading industrial employer, but other Rochester companies also employed many technical and manufacturing personnel. These included Gleason Works, Stromberg-Carlson, Taylor Instrument, Ritter Dental Equipment, Rochester Products Division of General Motors, and Pfaudler-Permutit.

In 1955, the Colleges for Men and Women of the University of Rochester were merged. In 1958, three new schools were created in engineering, business administration, and education. &quot;Smugtown USA&quot; by G. Curtis Gerling (Plaza Publishers 1957, reprinted 1993) is a scathing critique of the city&#x27;s 1940s and 1950s culture.

By the 1960s, as with the rest of the United States, the population was shifting from city to suburb, with substantial growth in the towns immediately adjacent to the city, including Greece, Gates, Chili, Henrietta, Brighton and Irondequoit.

The 1960 census showed a population drop to 318,611 and a drop in rank to 38th. The Rochester 1964 race riot took place in July of that year and marked the beginning of riots throughout the United States during the civil rights period. The disturbance broke out in Rochester&#x27;s predominantly African American districts on 24 July 1964. Peace was restored after 3 days, but only after the National Guard was called out. Although the riot was blamed on &quot;outside agitators&quot;, all the rioters arrested were from the Rochester area. This led to a reappraisal of old-time policies and practices which had not changed in face of a tripling of the African American population in 10 years, who were still mostly assigned to low-pay and low-skill jobs and lived in sub-standard housing. Because of the riots the city soon saw its first African-American Public safety director, several African-American police officers were hired. City leaders convinced local radio stations to seek African American announcers. WHAM hired Vic Mason and later Lou Paris, but the real change in black relations came when FM WCMF brought in Herb Hamlett who aired a morning R&amp;B show six days a week. Hamlett became the voice of Rochester&#x27;s black community, and was the most powerful voice in the city.

It was also in the 1960s that the city began a process of urban renewal, with the construction of Midtown Plaza, the first indoor shopping mall in a traditional downtown area in the United States. In the middle of that decade, when the New York State Department of Public Works decided it would build the Inner Loop expressway through the downtown Rochester Institute of Technology campus, the decision was made to build a new campus in the suburbs. The move to a more spacious location was critical to RIT&#x27;s 1966 selection as the site for the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and the 1,300 acre (5.3 km2) campus in suburban Henrietta opened in 1968. Decisions on urban renewal in Rochester had both positive and negative effects. As part of urban renewal several theaters were demolished for new buildings as was the famous New York Central Bragdon Station in 1966.

In the 60s and 70s, Rochester became known as the leading jazz town in upstate New York. Famous jazz musicians would come to Clarissa Street and play all night long moving from club to club. The Pythodd Room had been around for some time but reached its zenith in the late 1960s and 1970s under the ownership of Delores Thomas and her son Stanley Thomas Jr. The Pythodd was one example of a top Clarissa Street &quot;joint&quot; that hosted jam session including everyone from Little Stevie Wonder to Jimmy Smith and the Mangione brothers (Chuck and Gap). The Mangiones grew up in Rochester, and Chuck went on to become one of the biggest &quot;cross-over&quot; trumpeters in jazz history, with his records regularly being played on jazz, smooth jazz, and easy listening stations.

In 1970, the Rochester crime family bombed nine buildings, including three Jewish synagogues and two black churches, as part of the Rochester bombings designed to focus the attention of local authorities away from organized crime. Only one person was injured.
As part of continuing urban renewal, in 1969 Xerox Corporation opened a thirty-story office tower (Xerox Tower) at Broad Street East and Clinton Avenue South, although Xerox also moved its corporate headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut at about the same time. Lincoln Rochester Trust Company (now Chase Bank) opened a 28-story office tower, the Chase Tower at Clinton Avenue South and East Main Street. Later in the &#x27;70s, new offices and hotels were constructed along State Street, just north of Main Street. Most of Front Street and part of Corinthian Street were obliterated in the process. At Main Street and the Genesee River, a new hotel was opened, as was one at South Avenue and Main Street in a process that involved the almost complete reconstruction of the main street bridge by removing buildings that lined both sides of it. In 1978, city hall moved to the old Federal Building at State and Church. In the mid 1980s, work began on a high-rise hotel in downtown next to the new Rochester Riverside Convention Center. The project was stalled in 1987, and the Hyatt Regency Rochester didn&#x27;t open until 1992 after being rescued by several local business people in a public-private partnership.

In the 1990s, a new baseball stadium, Frontier Field, was built for the Rochester Red Wings near the Kodak office building. Bausch and Lomb constructed a new world headquarters just south of Main Street straddling Stone Street. A new Central Library, expanding the capacity of the Rochester Public Library complex, was erected across from the Rundel Library Building on South Avenue.

== The new millennium ==

The population of the City of Rochester at the 2000 census was 219,773, down 33.9% from its peak in 1950. In 2003 Rochester built a ferry terminal to house the &quot;Spirit of Ontario I&quot;. Product of the William A. Johnson Jr. administration, the &quot;Fast Ferry&quot; was short lived and after troubles with the start-up and operations, newly elected Mayor of Rochester Robert Duffy announced that the city government would be cutting off funds for the ferry. The City sold the &quot;Spirit of Ontario I&quot; at a financial loss in 2007 to the German company Förde Reederei Seetouristik Gmbh &amp; Co (FRS) for $29.8 million (US).

In 2006, a new stadium funded by private and public sources, PAETEC Park, was opened, not far from Frontier Field, and became the home of the Rhinos professional soccer team. Its naming sponsor has changed and it was later known as Capelli Sport Stadium, and then as Marina Auto Stadium.

In 2007, PAETEC Holding Corp. announced that they would be building a new tower downtown in place of Midtown Plaza. The PAETEC Tower was said to be built slightly higher than the Xerox Tower. Since then, however, the company was sold, plans for the tower were scaled down, and a much more modest headquarters building for PaeTec&#x27;s successor firm, Windstream, was completed in 2013.

Mayor Duffy was both criticized and praised for his efforts to take &quot;mayoral control&quot; of the failing city school district, in a manner similar to school governance re-organizations in New York and Chicago. The issue effectively stalled at the end of 2010 when Duffy was elected New York State Lieutenant Governor, as part of Governor Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s administration. His successor, Thomas Richards, was elected in a 2011 special election and announced that the issue had been &quot;placed on the back burner&quot;.

In 2013, Lovely Warren was elected Rochester&#x27;s first female mayor. Under Warren, a project to fill in the Inner loop and convert it to a boulevard was undertaken and a plan to build a performing arts center on a parcel of the former Midtown Plaza is underway.

City council member Malik Evans defeated Warren in a Democratic Party election in June 2021 and won the general election in November becoming the city&#x27;s 71st mayor in January 2022.

<doc id="1225431" wikidata="Q4164807" url="?curid=1225431" title="Isaac Fanous">
<text>Isaac Fanous (; December 19, 1919 – January 15, 2007) was an Egyptian Copt iconographer, scholar and theologian, who single-handedly founded the most popular style of contemporary Coptic art today, commonly referred to as &quot;Neo-Coptic&quot;.

==Early life and studies==
Fanous was born in Al-Minya and moved to Cairo to gain his degree from The Faculty of Applied arts now part of Helwan University in Egypt in 1941 and got a diploma in teaching in 1943.
Fanous was one of the first students of the Institute of Coptic Studies founded in 1954 and he obtained his doctorate in 1958 . His two-year study grant in the Louvre in the mid- 1960s was a turning point in his career. He took the opportunity, while in France, to study icon painting under Léonid Ouspensky, under whose patronage he developed a passion both as artist and theologian. This would lead, eventually, to him developing a style that was to become the new face of Coptic iconography in the mid-20th century.

Fanous chaired the Coptic Art department at the Institute of Coptic Studies in Cairo, and he has trained a number of other Coptic artists from outside Egypt.

==Political influences==
As wealthy patrons of the arts disappeared from Egypt&#x27;s cosmopolitan art world following the 1952 revolution, they were gradually replaced by select state-funding, causing the art world became more competitive: the highly innovative career of Fanous took off from the struggles and experiences of his time. During this period, he was known to have become more keenly aware of his Egyptian heritage and was proud of everything that came from Al-Minya since the time of Akhnaten, who founded his city.

==Modern Coptic iconography==
For centuries before painters like Isaac Fanous the Coptic Orthodox church had its own style which is recognised as the traditional Coptic style. Under the influence of the European art, which spread to Egypt in the nineteenth Century, a lot of the Churches in Egypt appeared, with Icons that were stylistically similar and often identical to a lot of Western Christian art, especially that of Protestants.

Fanous&#x27;s contemporary school of iconography came about as part of a general renaissance of Coptic culture, which began during the patriarchate of Pope Cyril VI (1959–1971).

He drew on the already established old Coptic style, like that of Yuhanna al-Armani, as well having taken the influences from popular Western Protestant art, gradually developing in his own style, his style became widely recognized for its amplified symmetry, added minimalism and exaggerated Idiosyncrasy of previous Coptic art; his style is widely referred to as &quot;Modern Coptic Style&quot; or simply &quot;Neo-Coptic&quot;. 

He is not just considered a pioneer in this field, but Fanous is held to be the father of modern Coptic iconography and the initiator of the modern renaissance in Coptic art.

Fanous painted all the illustrations and icons in St. Takla Haymanot&#x27;s Church in Alexandria, which was consecrated in 1969. Between 1977 and 1978, he spent six months in the UK to paint icons in St Mark&#x27;s Coptic Orthodox church in Allen Street, Kensington, London.

<text>Mario Superstar Baseball is a 2005 sports video game developed by Namco and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. The game was created in the vein of other &quot;Mario&quot; sports games such as &quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour&quot; and &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Mario Super Sluggers&quot;, was released for the Wii in 2008.

Gameplay mainly focuses on the player assuming the role of many &quot;Mario&quot; series characters to challenge any opposing teams compatible in the Challenge Mode, the final being Bowser, having baseball matches to see who will win the Cup of the mode. Other playable modes include Exhibition Mode, in which players choose the leader and the other rosters in the team and challenge another team to a single baseball game, and Minigames where the player must complete a certain mission. A common power-up in the game is a charged swing, a hit by a baseball bat performed by a character that will give the ball a strong hit, causing the length of a normal hit baseball to be twice as powerful. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics.

==Game modes==
===Exhibition Game===
A single game of baseball, players choose the team captain and a roster of players, and play one game. Players can choose which team bats first. Players can also choose how many innings the game will last, and pick their choice out of six unique stadiums. Bowser&#x27;s Castle can be unlocked after beating Challenge Mode.

===Challenge===
The heart of &quot;Mario Superstar Baseball&quot; is the Challenge Mode. It is a single-player mode where the player selects a pre-built team and must defeat all the other teams; at first Bowser&#x27;s team is the last team to beat for the cup, and must be unlocked before the player can use him. There are six teams, each led by one of the Captains (Mario, Peach, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario, and Bowser), features a secondary captain (Luigi, Daisy, Birdo, Diddy Kong, Waluigi, and Bowser Jr.), and is filled with a mix of sub characters, some of which are duplicated within a team, but do not appear on any other team. For example, aside from the aforementioned captains and sub-captains, Mario&#x27;s team consists of Monty Mole, 3 Piantas, and 3 Nokis, Princess Peach&#x27;s team consists of Toadette, Toadsworth, and 5 Toads, Wario&#x27;s team consists of Boo, King Boo, Petey Piranha, and 4 Magikoopas, Yoshi&#x27;s team consists of Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and 5 Shy Guys, Donkey Kong&#x27;s team consists of Dixie Kong, Goomba, Paragoomba, 2 Paratroopas, and 2 Koopa Troopas, and Bowser&#x27;s team consists of 4 Dry Bones, Hammer Bro, Fire Bro, and Boomerang Bro (although Hammer Bro, Fire Bro and Boomerang Bro are separate characters (enemies) in the Mario series, in this game, it is actually just a color variation of the same character.).
Players challenge the other teams, beating the other four opens the path to Bowser&#x27;s castle. The secondary purpose of defeating other teams is to recruit other characters to improve ones team. On opposing teams, each character has a set of scouting flags. During the game players will have mission objectives like &quot;Strike &#x27;em out&quot;, or &quot;Score a run&quot;, that earn flags; if one gets all the flags of a particular character and wins the game, that character will be recruited. If the player fails to complete a mission, they must wait for a while to complete another mission. Flags are cumulative, so if the player doesn&#x27;t get all the flags in a game, or loses the game after getting all the flags, the flags earned will remain when the team is challenged again; a team can be challenged as long as the captain of the team is not recruited. Players of a different color can&#x27;t be recruited and can only be played in minigames and playing with the teams they start on.

If the team captain is recruited, his or her team will disband; any characters from that team that were not recruited will join a team led by Bowser Jr. Another way to recruit characters is by a mercy win; if either team is leading by at least 10 runs at the end of an inning, the game is called out of mercy to the losing team. If the player wins a game in this fashion, all characters on the opposing team will be so impressed that they will immediately join.

After every game or minigame, Bowser Jr. will wander around the map; if the player runs into him, they will be forced to play a game in the bottom of the 9th inning, with the player randomly chosen as visitor or home. If the player&#x27;s team is the visiting team, then they will have the lead and must stop Bowser Jr. from mounting a comeback; otherwise, it is the player&#x27;s job to mount a comeback. Beating Bowser Jr. earns the player 100 coins to use in the shop, while losing costs the player half of their coins. In the event of having an odd coin count when losing to Bowser Jr., the coins will be rounded up. Bowser Jr.&#x27;s team also has players from disbanded teams that the player can recruit; in which case the only mission objective is &quot;Win the game.&quot;

There is a shop located on the map for purchasing power-ups, each worth a certain number of coins that the player earns from the minigames or Bowser Jr. In order for a Captain to use their special abilities, they must be purchased from the shop; these power-ups are permanent, and can be carried over into other Challenge Mode games by continuing from a previously cleared game. Other power-ups offer a temporary boost to a stat for all characters on their team, but they only last for one game, win or lose. A Toad runs the shop.

Another goal during Challenge Mode is the Superstar quest; each character has a set of requirement that earn stars. If a character meets all of his or her requirements, then the character upgrades to a Superstar, and gets a boost in all their abilities. Also, once a character becomes a Superstar, the Superstar version of the character can be used in other game modes. There&#x27;s a simple way to figure out the number of superstar missions per player. The captain of the team has 10 missions. The 2nd captain has eight. Minor characters have six. And characters of race (excluding Monty Mole who has six) have four. Note that players like Red Koopa and Black Shy Guy can be unlocked by completing the main changing color player like Blue Pianta &amp; Blue Noki.

The game rules that cannot be changed are as follows: Your team bats first, and the Star Skills and mercy are turned on. There are four difficulty settings for challenge mode that are similar to those of &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot; - Mushroom (easy), Flower (medium), Star (hard), and Special (very hard). On Mushroom, Flower, and Star difficulty setting, four other teams are challenged for three innings. After each team has been beaten at least once, Bowser is played for five innings. On Special difficulty setting, the innings change so that each team is played with two additional innings from before. Once the player clears Special difficulty, then Bowser is selectable as a team captain. When using him as a team captain, the rules slightly change: The other teams invade Bowser&#x27;s castle, and Bowser must beat them in a game of baseball to win his castle back. Bowser has to beat the initial five teams, then they come together to form a team of captains led by Mario that Bowser must defeat; Bowser can still recruit other characters, except the captains and sub-captains; and because Bowser Jr. is on his team, he does not wander the map to challenge a player, so you must play minigames to earn coins.

==Reception==

The game was met with positive reception, as GameRankings gave it a score of 76.70%, while Metacritic gave it 76 out of 100.

Robert Workman of &quot;GameDaily&quot; praised the game, writing, &quot;...I found [&quot;Mario Superstar Baseball&quot;] to grow on me.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; praised the game, while noting its inconsistent production values &quot;GameSpot&quot; awarded the game an 8 out of 10.

===Awards===
* G-Phoria&#x27;s Best Alternative Sports Game for 2006

<text>James Reubin Tabor (November 5, 1916 – August 22, 1953), nicknamed &quot;Rawhide&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball player, a third baseman for the Boston Red Sox (1938–44) and Philadelphia Phillies (1946–47). Born in New Hope, Alabama, he batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed .

==Productive Major League hitter==
Tabor attended the University of Alabama. He came to the Red Sox late in after two stellar minor league seasons and hit .316 (18-for-57) in 19 games. The next year he was the Bosox&#x27; regular third baseman. He appeared in 149 games and had a .280 batting average, highest of his MLB career, with 14 home runs and 95 runs batted in.

In 1940 Tabor collected a career-high 21 home runs with 81 RBI, with 16 homers and a career-high 101 RBI in 1941. He remained with Boston until the end of the 1944 campaign, when he was inducted into the United States Army. After missing the 1945 campaign, he was discharged from military service and then sold to the Phillies on January 22, 1946. After two years in Philadelphia, Tabor was sent to the minor leagues. His Major League career was marked by numerous suspensions for &quot;breaking training rules,&quot; and one teammate, Doc Cramer, alleged that Tabor would come to the ballpark still &quot;half drunk&quot; from his nights on the town; the Red Sox even hired private detectives to unsuccessfully try to control Tabor&#x27;s behavior.

Tabor was a career .270 hitter with 1,021 hits, 104 home runs and 598 RBI in 1,005 games. He led American League third basemen in assists (1939) and putouts (1942), and in errors for five consecutive seasons (1939–43).

His last active seasons were spent with Los Angeles, Sacramento and Portland in the Pacific Coast League until his retirement in 1952. Tabor died of a heart attack in Sacramento, California, at the age of 36.

==Highlights==
* Hit four home runs in a double-header against the Philadelphia Athletics, collecting 19 bases and 11 RBI. Three of his homers came in the second game, including a record-tying two grand slams in consecutive innings (July 4, 1939). His 11 RBI is the AL single day record.

<doc id="1225461" wikidata="Q378683" url="?curid=1225461" title="Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Vatia">
<text>Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Vatia (also called Lentulus Batiatus by Plutarch) was the Roman owner of a gladiatorial school in ancient Capua. It was from this school that, in 73 BC, the Thracian slave Spartacus and about 70 to 78 followers escaped. The breakout led to the slave rebellion known as the Third Servile War (73–71 BC).

==Identity and origins==
Shackleton Bailey noted that the name (&quot;Batiatus&quot;), as recorded by the ancient historians, could be a corrupted form of the cognomen &quot;Vatia&quot; and this &quot;Cornelius Lentulus Vatia&quot; would then have been either a Servilius Vatia by birth adopted into the Cornelii Lentuli or else a Cornelius Lentulus by birth adopted into the Servilii Vatiae. Ronald Syme also agreed that the name &quot;Batiatus&quot; was surely a corruption of &quot;Vatia&quot;.

It is often assumed following Shackleton Bailey&#x27;s arguments that he was the same man as the Gnaeus Lentulus Vatia who was quaestor in 75 BC and tribune in 72 BC. This Lentulus was also prosecution witness against Publius Sestius in 56 BC. If he was born a Lentulus then his biological father may have been Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus the consul of 97 BC. Gaius Servilius Vatia the praetor in 102 BC may have been his adoptive father. His status as a possible plebeian Lentuli (due to an adoption by a Servilius Vatia) makes him a plausible candidate as the adoptive father of Publius Cornelius Dolabella (the consul of 44 BC).

==Portrayal in media==
&quot;Batiatus&quot; was played by Peter Ustinov in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1960 film, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, for which Ustinov won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Ian McNeice played &quot;Batiatus&quot; in the 2004 television adaptation &quot;Spartacus&quot;.

John Hannah played &quot;Batiatus&quot; (here given the praenomen Quintus) in the 2010 Starz television series &quot;&quot; and the 2011 &quot;&quot;.

<text>Sinus Medii (Latin &quot;sinus mediī&quot; &quot;Middle Bay&quot;) is a small lunar mare. It takes its name from its location at the intersection of the Moon&#x27;s equator and prime meridian; as seen from the Earth, this feature is located in the central part of the Moon&#x27;s near side, and it is the point closest to the Earth. From this spot, the Earth would always appear directly overhead, although the planet&#x27;s position would vary slightly due to libration.

During the Apollo program, Sinus Medii was designated Apollo Landing Site 3 (ALS3). Flight operations planners were concerned about having the optimum lighting conditions at the landing site. Hence, alternative landing sites moved progressively westward, following the terminator. A delay of two days for weather or equipment reasons would have sent Apollo 11 to Sinus Medii instead of ALS2, Mare Tranquillitatis (where it actually landed); another two-day delay would have resulted in ALS5, a site in Oceanus Procellarum, being targeted.

==Geology==

The selenographic coordinates of Sinus Medii are , and its diameter is 287 km. It joins Mare Insularum in the west with Mare Vaporum to the north.

The eastern part of this area is notable for a series of rille systems. In the far northeast is the Rima Hyginus, which is bisected by the crater Hyginus. At the far eastern end is the 220-km long Rima Ariadaeus rille which continues eastward to the edge of the Mare Tranquillitatis. At longitudes 4-6° E is the Rimae Triesnecker rille system, named after the crater Triesnecker just to the west.

The northern edge of the Sinus Medii is formed by a highland region, with the impact craters Murchison and Pallas along the border. Near the northern border on this mare is the cup-shaped Chladni.

Another highland region lies to the south and southeastern edge of the Sinus Medii. Several flooded craters lie along this border, with Flammarion near the western edge, then Oppolzer, Réaumur, and Seeliger further east. The Rima Flammarion and Rima Oppolzer rilles lie along the edge of the mare near their corresponding craters. Also along the southeast border and bisecting the prime meridian is the crater Rhaeticus.

In the western half of the interior are the small craters Bruce and Blagg. Near the western end of the mare are the flooded craters Schröter and Sömmering.

==Names==

The English astronomer William Gilbert was the first to give a name to this mare, calling it Insula Medilunaria (&quot;Middlemoon Island&quot;). The idea for its present name originates with Michael van Langren, who labelled it Sinus Medius in his 1645 map. Johannes Hevelius called the feature Mare Adriaticum (&quot;The Adriatic Sea&quot;) in his 1647 map. Giovanni Riccioli called it Sinus Aestuum (&quot;Bay of Hot Days&quot;) in his 1651 map.

==Exploration==

The Surveyor 6 mission landed to the west-southwest of Bruce crater inside Sinus Medii in November 1967. Prior to that in July 1967, the Surveyor 4 had crashed nearby.

<doc id="1225466" wikidata="Q5132011" url="?curid=1225466" title="Clevedon, New Zealand">
<text>Clevedon (), previously known as Wairoa South, is a rural town to the south-east of Auckland, New Zealand, in the local government area of Franklin. The area is part of the rohe of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, who settled around the Wairoa River. The original township was founded in the 1850s, and was named Clevedon in 1866. Over time, it has developed into a centre for the dairy industry south-east of Auckland.

Several popular beaches are close to Clevedon, including Umupuia Beach and Kawakawa Bay. The Duder Regional Park is between these two beaches.

==Geography==
Clevedon is located along the Wairoa River, a stream which grows into an estuarial arm of the Hauraki Gulf, at the navigable headland of the river. It is south-east of the Auckland City Centre. It is south-east of the Auckland City Centre, and from the Manukau Central. To the south-east of Clevedon rise the rugged hills of the Hunua Ranges. 

Prior to human settlement, the area was swampland, and Bush moa, Mantell&#x27;s moa and North Island giant moa bones have been found in the vicinity.

==History==
===Māori settlement===

The area was visited by the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory waka around the year 1300. Tainui followers of Manawatere, who identified as Ngā Oho, decided to settle the Pōhutukawa Coast and the Wairoa River. Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki traditional stories talk about the land already being occupied by the supernatural Tūrehu people, and many place names in the area reference Tūrehu figures, such as Hinerangi and Manawatere. The Wairoa River&#x27;s traditional name, Te Wairoa (&quot;The Great River&quot;) was named by early Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki ancestors of the Tainui waka, referencing Te Vairoa in Rarotonga, which in turn took its name from a similarly named river in Tahiti. Te Wairoa was a name applying to the river mouth and surrounding area, while Ōtau referred to the areas further upstream, including around Clevedon.

The early Tāmaki Māori hapū of the Wairoa river valley between the 14th and 16th centuries included Te Ngungukauri, Te Uri Kupai, Ngāti Ruangaingai and Ngāti Parahanga, who identified as both Ngāti Tai Manawaiti, and Ngā Iwi (Waiohua). The related hapū were united under the rangatira Te Wana in the early 18th century, under the name Ngāti Tai (now more widely known as Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki). The river mouth formed the traditional heartland of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki. Ngāi Tai peoples traditionally lived in seasonal cycles, focusing on fishing and shellfish collecting, cultivations and collecting berries and snaring birds in the river&#x27;s upper reaches, depending on the season. The river-mouth was used as a summer pioke (Shortspine spurdog shark) fishing ground, which were dried for the winter months. Ngāi Tai settled at many pā and kāinga along the river, especially at the river&#x27;s mouth.

Ngā Tai settlements in the area include Ōtau and Tuawa near modern-day Clevedon, Tararua near the mouth of the Rautawhiti Stream, and at Takatekauere, Te Totara, Te Ruato and Pehuwai on the western side of Te Wairoa River. Between the 1830s and 1863, the Te Hingawaka hapū of Ngāti Pāoa lived at the base of Te Oue pā, north-west of the Wairoa River mouth.

When William Thomas Fairburn visited the area in 1833, it was mostly unoccupied due to the events of the Musket Wars, as most members of Ngāi Tai had fled to temporary refuge in the Waikato. In 1836, Fairburn purchased 40,000 acres between Ōtāhuhu and Umupuia (Duders Beach), including much of the catchment of the Wairoa River. Fairburn&#x27;s Purchase was investigated by the New Zealand Land Commission in 1841 and 1842 and found to be excessive and reduced in size. The disallowed parts of his purchase were not returned to Ngāi Tai, however in 1854 a reserve was created for Ngāi Tai around Umupuia.

===European settlement===
The first settlers in the area were D. McNicol and Mr G. Hoye, who purchased 1,100 acres on the eastern banks of the Wairoa River, and settled with their families circa 1852. They were joined by other early settlers within the next few years, and a community called Wairoa was established around the navigable headland of the Wairoa River. Early settlers cleared native bush for farming, worked flax mills in swampy areas, and harvested kauri logs, which were transported to Auckland to be processed. Ngāi Tai held a defended settlement on the eastern banks of the Wairoa River opposite the new settlement, known as Ōtau. During the first decade post European settlement, Ngāi Tai and the European settlers had cordial relations, trading goods and assisting each other. In September 1863 during the Invasion of the Waikato, Ōtau was attacked by the British army, and the village was evacuated. After which, the residents moved to live in communities at the river&#x27;s mouth. For the remainder of the war, Ngāi Tai were designated as a &quot;friendly&quot; people by the Crown, and remained neutral in the fighting. During the war, military blockades were placed on either side of the Wairoa River, including the Galloway Redoubt. After the Native Lands Act of 1865, the Native Land Court individuated the collective Ngāi Tai lands, and in the process the majority of land near the Wairoa River was alienated and sold to European farmers. During European settlement, most of the Wairoa River catchment was deforested.

The first bridge across the Wairoa River was constructed by the early 1860s from timber. In 1865, 150 new immigrants from Scotland on board the &quot;Viola&quot; arrived at Wairoa, settling around the former Ōtau kāinga. The allotments were not sufficient to sustain a village, and the immigrants gradually moved away or closer to the settlement near the Wairoa Bridge. In 1866, the settlement changed its name to Clevedon. The name was chosen by local residents C.W. Stephens and Le Gally, named after the town of Clevedon in Somerset, England, where Le Gally . Many of the early settlers were Scottish, and had difficulties adopting the name. All Souls Church, built in the Selwyn style and located in Clevedon, is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category II structure, with registration number 682. Dairy farming became the major industry in Clevedon until the 1900s.

<doc id="1225495" wikidata="Q7820443" url="?curid=1225495" title="Tomás Blanco (writer)">
<text>Tomás Blanco (December 9, 1896 – April 12, 1975) was a Puerto Rican writer, poet, narrator, historian, author and physician. Blanco was a writer during the 1930s who was known for his critical essays that analyzed the Puerto Rican culture. Similar to other authors of his generation that lived through the Great Depression, his work focused on political and social issues. He also wrote novels, short stories and poetry.

==Early years==
Blanco (birth name: Tomás Blanco Geigel) was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he received his primary and secondary education in Catholic schools. After graduating from high school, he went to the United States and enrolled in the Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., to study medicine. Tomás Blanco first pursued the path of pharmaceutical work but progressively began to focus his attention on literature.
Blanco traveled throughout Europe and in Spain where he developed his love for writing. Blanco wrote about literature, plus he was also a music critic.

==Written works==
Blanco returned to Puerto Rico where he dedicated himself to write about Puerto Rican topics. His works are considered very important in the analysis of the &quot;state&quot; of the Puerto Rican culture in both the 19th century and 20th century. Among Blanco&#x27;s most recognized works are &quot;Prontuario Histórico de Puerto Rico&quot; and &quot;El Prejuicio Racial en Puerto Rico&quot; (Racial Prejudice in Puerto Rico). He also wrote many novels and stories such as &quot;Los Aguinaldos del Infante&quot; (Christmas Stories for Children) and &quot;Cuentos Sin Ton Ni Son&quot;. He was also the songwriter of the lyrics &quot;Tres estrofas de amor: Canción para soprano&quot; composed in 1925 by Pablo Casals. 
Tomás Blanco died on April 12, 1975, in the city of San Juan.

===Essays===
In 1935, he published his first literary piece &quot;Prontuario Histórico de Puerto Rico&quot; which showcases the cultural aspects of the Puerto Rican people and racial dynamics within the country. In the essay he recounts significant events of the history of Puerto Rico, in hope of finding the country&#x27;s national idiosyncrasy and cultural identity.

The mixing of races and religions created a unique combination of ideas and culture, which sometimes sparked conflict. Tomas Blanco&#x27;s thoughts on these racial relationships and controversies are presented in, &quot;The Racial Prejudice in Puerto Rico.&quot; The essay discusses the influence of the slave trade and the discrimination of people of African descent in Puerto Rico. Tomas Blanco speaks of the connection between Spanish Conquistadors influence, Catholicism, and the interconnection of different races. Tomas Blanco argues that the African influences in Puerto Rico are beneficial to the uniqueness and richness of the country.

Other essays include &quot;Sobre Palés Matos&quot; (1950), which analyzes Palés Matos&#x27; poetry influenced by African and Antillean culture and &quot;Miserere: en la muerte de Georges Rouault y luz perpetua luzca en él&quot; (1959), a review on various paintings by Rouault.
He also wrote essays for many newspapers and magazines, such as the Ateneo Puertorriqueño, Isla Asomante, Presente, Revista de la Asociación de Mujeres Graduadas and Revista del Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña. He wrote the essay &quot;Elogio de la plena&quot; en the magazine, Ateneo Puertorriqueño, which discussed the diversity of Puerto Rico and how it positively impacts the island.

===Poetry===
Blanco&#x27;s interest in race relations led him to study African-American poetry. Racial mixing was considered immoral and was looked down upon in the 19th and early 20th century in Puerto Rico. Tomas Blanco challenges these ideas by bringing up these topics in his literary work in a positive manner. In the book &quot;Literatura PuertorriquenÌa Del Siglo Veinte Antologia,&quot; the poem &quot;La Unicornia de la Isla&quot; highlights these controversial ideas and different viewpoints. The poem investigates the cultural identity of the people of Puerto Rico through the mention of topics like miscegenation and incorporating traditional Antillean myths. Much of Tomas Blanco&#x27;s work highlights the various cultures and belief systems of Puerto Rico and explains how it both positively and negatively affects the environment of the country. In &quot;Los cinco sentidos: inventario de cosas nuestras&quot; (1955), he presents Antillean myths in poetic form. Much of Tomas Blanco&#x27;s work highlights the various cultures and belief systems of Puerto Rico and explains how it both positively and negatively affects the environment of the country. He also wrote the poem Letras para música in 1964.

===Short stories===
Blanco wrote a number of short stories, such as &quot;Los aguinaldos del Infante: glosa de Epifanía&quot; (1954) about Christmas, &quot;La dragoneta: cuento de Semana Santa&quot; (1956) and &quot;Cuentos sin ton ni son&quot; (1970).

<text>Nguyễn Hữu Chánh (; born October 1, 1952) is the Vietnamese-American founder of anti-communist organization Government of Free Vietnam (GFVN), in which he served as its prime minister.

==Early life==

===Rebel years in Vietnam===
In 1975, said to be a member of the &quot;Bao Long Liberators&quot;, a democratic organization in Nha Trang, under the leadership of Nguyen Hoang Dan.

In 1982 he secretly fled Vietnam while being pursued by the Vietnamese government for his engagement in the weapon-smuggling activities. He later immigrated to the United States.

==Exile in the United States==
In 1995, was selected by a members of the Government of Free Vietnam as Prime Minister, General Linh Quang Viên as Vice Prime Minister, Admiral Lâm Nguơn Tánh as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nguyen Khac Chinh as the Minister of Information, Mr. Nguyễn Huy Đẩu as Minister of Justice, Nguyen Son Ha as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Edgar Foshee as Chairman of the International Committee, and Mr. Ngô Trọng Anh as President of the advisory council.

In June 1999, the government of Vietnam police issued an international order to pursue Nguyen Huu Chanh for his role behind the terrorist attacks against Vietnamese embassies overseas as well as in Vietnam since 1995.

On January 2, 2005, he stepped down as Prime Minister of the Government of Free Vietnam when former head of state of South Vietnam Nguyễn Khánh was elected by delegates of the GFVN. Nguyen then took the helm as the chairmanship of the Walk Against Terror International, a new organisation tasked with combatting terrorism around the world.

==Detention in South Korea==
On April 5, 2006, Nguyen Huu Chanh was detained by KNP police officers in Seoul, South Korea, because the Vietnamese government had made a request to the Korean authorities to detain Nguyen Huu Chanh for possible &quot;charges of arms weapon trafficking and acts of terrorism&quot;. 

Protests in support of Nguyen in Vietnamese and South Korean communities grew throughout the United States and in South Korea for his release. There was a petition presented to the South Korean court that had over 70,000 signatures in support of Nguyen&#x27;s release.

Nguyen was released from custody at Uiwang, south of Seoul, on Thursday, July 27, 2006. The Seoul High Court rejected the Vietnamese request to hand over Chanh, whom the Vietnamese government accused of involvement in failed attempts to bomb its embassy in Thailand and state facilities in Vietnam, including a statue of founding leader Ho Chi Minh, between 1999 and 2001. 

==Quotes==

*&quot;As we stand on these foreign shores, we shall never forget those suffering beyond the horizon.&quot;
*&quot;Tyranny and Totalitarianism in any form must be terminated.&quot;
*&quot;We are blessed by God to have the opportunity to live in freedom, to breathe freely. So it is our obligation, by the bond of our common humanity, that we give others who are less fortunate, to have the same opportunity as we do.&quot;

<doc id="1225518" wikidata="Q296592" url="?curid=1225518" title="Age-Related Eye Disease Study">
<text>The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) was a clinical trial sponsored by the National Eye Institute that ran from 1992 to 2001. The study was designed to:
* investigate the natural history and risk factors of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts, and 
* evaluate the effects of high doses of antioxidants and zinc on the progression of the two conditions in those with AMD.

The results were reported in the October 2001 issue of &quot;Archives of Ophthalmology&quot;. The study followed 3640 individuals for an average of 6.3 years between 1992 and 2001. The researchers concluded that high levels of antioxidants and zinc can reduce some people&#x27;s risk of developing advanced AMD by about 25 percent. Advanced AMD is defined as either choroidal neovascularization (wet macular degeneration) or atrophic age-related macular degeneration (geographic atrophy). The anti-oxidants and zinc supplements only reduced the risk of progression to wet macular degeneration. Those that benefited from the dietary supplements included those with intermediate-stage AMD and those with advanced AMD in one eye only. The supplements had no significant effect on the development or progression of cataracts. &quot;High levels&quot; in this case were defined to be:
*500 milligrams of vitamin C; 
*400 international units of vitamin E; 
*15 milligrams of beta-carotene (or 25,000 international units of vitamin A); 
*80 milligrams of the dietary mineral zinc, in the form of zinc oxide; and 
*two milligrams of copper as cupric oxide, added to prevent copper deficiency anemia, a condition associated with high levels of zinc intake.

Bausch &amp; Lomb was a collaborator in the study. They and other suppliers provide supplements pre-packaged with formulations based on this study.

Studies in 2016 and 2018 later showed that this average 25 percent reduction in risk from the combination of anti-oxidants and zinc varies by genotype.

==AREDS2==

The original AREDS study was followed by AREDS2, a five-year study that started in 2006 to test whether the original AREDS formulation would be improved by adding omega-3 fatty acids; adding lutein and zeaxanthin; removing beta-carotene; or reducing zinc. In AREDS2, participants took one of four AREDS formulations: the original AREDS formulation, AREDS formulation with no beta-carotene, AREDS with low zinc, AREDS with no beta-carotene and low zinc. In addition, they took one of four additional supplement or combinations including lutein and zeaxanthin (10 mg and 2 mg), omega-3 fatty acids (1,000 mg), lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids, or placebo.

The study reported that there was no overall additional benefit from adding omega-3 fatty acids or lutein and zeaxanthin to the formulation. However, the study did find benefits in two subgroups of participants: those not given beta-carotene, and those who had very little lutein and zeaxanthin in their diets. Removing beta-carotene did not curb the formulation&#x27;s protective effect against developing advanced AMD, which is important given that high doses of beta-carotene have been linked to higher risk of lung cancers in smokers. According to Dr. Emily Chew, &quot;Because carotenoids can compete with each other for absorption in the body, beta-carotene may have masked the effect of the lutein and zeaxanthin in the overall analysis.&quot;

The AREDS2 trial did not find a difference in the effects of 80mg versus 25mg zinc. The UK National Health Service suggests that people may take the lower dose if the higher dose upsets their stomach. The 25mg zinc level has not been compared to a placebo, , and 80mg remains the standard.

== Packaging ==
The AREDS2 formulation is often sold with all the ingredients packaged together in one pill, for convenience. These formulations may be labelled as &quot;AREDS2&quot;, the pharmaceutical generic name, or they may be labelled with trademarked brand names, or they may be labelled with both. Some preparations not explicitly labelled as AREDS2 may not contain the correct ingredients in the correct quantities, and may contain additional, non-AREDS2 ingredients, which have no proven benefit.

The AREDS2 formulation can also be taken as a set of pills which contain the individual components in the correct quantities.

<doc id="1225542" wikidata="Q1431797" url="?curid=1225542" title="Guy Warren">
<text>Guy Warren of Ghana, also known as Kofi Ghanaba (4 May 1923 – 22 December 2008), was a Ghanaian musician, most notable as the inventor of Afro-jazz — &quot;the reuniting of African-American jazz with its African roots&quot; — and as a member of The Tempos, alongside E. T. Mensah. He also inspired musicians such as Fela Kuti. Warren&#x27;s virtuosity on the African drums earned him the appellation &quot;The Divine Drummer&quot;. At different stages of his life, he additionally worked as a journalist, DJ and broadcaster.

== Biography ==
He was born Warren Gamaliel Kpakpo Akwei in Accra in the then Gold Coast on 4 May 1923, to Richard Mabuo Akwei, founder of the Ghana National School, and Susana Awula Abla Moore. Named by his parents after Warren Gamaliel Harding, the 29th president of the United States, he changed his name in 1943 to Guy Warren. When he was in the U.S. he became &quot;Guy Warren of Ghana&quot;. He changed his name to &quot;Ghanaba&quot; on 1 July 1974, Ghana&#x27;s Republic Day.

He was educated at the Government Boys&#x27; School, Accra, from 1928 to 1939. During this time, he developed his interest in music by playing for the school band. After passing with distinction, he enrolled at Odorgonno Secondary School in 1940. During the same year, he joined the Accra Rhythmic Orchestra under Yeboah Mensah as a drummer. He won a government teacher training scholarship to Achimota College, Accra, in 1941 with the intention of becoming a teacher at his father&#x27;s school. While at Achimota, he participated in sports. He dropped out of the college in 1942 because, as he later said, &quot;I was bored stiff with my studies and the stern discipline of the college, which attempted to change me into an Englishman.&quot;

In 1943, Warren Akwei enlisted in the Office of Strategic Services, a branch of the United States Army that dealt with overt and covert operations in World War II. He returned to Accra in the same year and joined the &quot;Spectator Daily&quot; as a reporter under the editor Robert Wuta-Ofei. He was editor of the &quot;Daily Echo&quot;, &quot;Gold Coast Independent&quot;, and &quot;Star of West Africa&quot; between 1950 and 1952. In 1944, he began broadcasting jazz programmes while working at the Gold Coast Broadcasting Service under the name Guy Warren, which he continued using for the next three decades. In 1951, he did a series of jazz programmes for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), becoming the first African to host programmes with the service. He also acted in the 1951 film &quot;The Boy Kumasenu&quot;, playing the role of Yeboah. He worked at Station ELBC, the National Broadcasting Service of Liberia, as assistant director and disc jockey between 1953 and 1955.

He joined E. T. Mensah and others to form the jazz band The Tempos but left the band in 1951. In 1955 Warren left for Chicago and joined the Gene Esposito Band as co-leader, percussionist, and arranger. With them he recorded his first album, &quot;Africa Speaks, America Answers&quot; (Decca, 1956). African music was popular, but it had not been integrated with world music until Warren. Fela Anikulapo Kuti and Osibisa popularized Ghanaba&#x27;s music. During his stay in America, he worked with Duke Ellington, Max Roach, Charlie Parker, and Louis Armstrong.

By 1974 he had returned to Ghana, where on 1 July 1974, Republic Day, he changed his name to &quot;Ghanaba&quot;. He later said: &quot;After the United States disillusioned me, I wanted to resurrect the African component of jazz. African interpretations of jazz were different than African American version I heard in the U.S. I discovered Africanness in the U.S. ... I wanted to do African music.&quot;

In the 1990s, he played a role in the film &quot;Sankofa&quot; (1993), written and directed by Haile Gerima, who was working in the United States. It was filmed also in Ghana and Burkina Faso. Ghanaba continued to make music until his death aged 85 on 22 December 2008 at the 37 Military Hospital in Accra. He was buried in a coffin designed as a drum by Eric Adjetey Anang of Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop.

== Family ==
Ghanaba&#x27;s parents were Susana Awula Abla Moor and Richard Mabuo Akwei, founder and first headmaster of Ghana National School in Accra. As a child Ghanaba was a boisterous free spirit who found little peace and comfort with the strictness of his father. Richard Akwei, a disciplinarian, was an educationist and founder of the Akwei Memorial School in central Accra; also a sports administrator, he is credited with being the first Ghanaian Chief Executive of the Central Organization of Sports (COS), later known as the Sports Council.

Ghanaba was married twice and had six children. His first son, Guy Warren Jr., also known as &quot;Odinga Oginga&quot;, is an artist specialising in sculpting, painting and carving. His second child, Glenn Gillespie Warren, also called &quot;Ghanababa&quot; (the son of Ghanaba), is a jazz drummer who played on the album &quot;That Happy Feeling&quot; (Safari, 1979). He recorded &quot;Bomdigi&quot; (Safari, 2008), the last album featuring Ghanaba. Glenn was chosen by Ghanaba to carry on his work, which was formally marked when Ghanaba handed Glenn his drumsticks. Ghanaba&#x27;s third son, Gamal Abdel Nasser Warren, also known as &quot;The President&quot;, was named after president Nasser of Egypt. Ghanaba&#x27;s fourth son, Gamaliel Joseph Warren, inherited his father&#x27;s musical talent as a jazz drummer.

In 1976, Ghanaba met and married Mrs Felicia Ghanaba, a Togolese living in Ghana. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Medie (&quot;mine&quot;); she is known as Medie Ghanaba Lemay. In 1982, the couple had a second daughter, named Gye Nyame Hosanna Ghanaba.

== Music career ==

=== 1940–80 ===
He began his career under the name Guy Warren as a disc jockey in 1944 with several jazz programmes on the Gold Coast Broadcasting Service (later Ghana Broadcasting Corporation) and Z.O.Y. Accra. He described his performance on the drums as love-making, seeing the African drums as a woman who could not be satisfied. While the punch and power of his playing easily tore the vinyl covering on Western-made drums, the animal skin covering the African drums remained intact. Nii Anum Telfer describes climbing on stage with Ghanaba as a feeling he would always remember. A firecracker would announce their entrance.

As Seth Paris notes, &quot;With fellow musicians, like saxophonist Joe Kelly and bassist Oscarmore Ofori, Guy was part of the generation to bring the influences of African-American musical styles into mainstream Ghanaian culture. During 1948, Guy Warren worked with Kenny Graham&#x27;s Afro-Cubists in the UK, and when he returned to Ghana, helped introduce Afro-Cuban rhythms to the country.&quot;

Travelling to the U.S. in 1954, Ghanaba spent some years working there, although he found little commercial success. Once, before a U.S. show, Warren appeared backstage in authentic African wear. However, the owner of the club (African Room) was trying to force him to wear what he considered an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; outfit with a tattered straw hat, which was the norm for Calypso and African musicians at the time. Ghanaba adamantly refused to change, beginning a trend that was copied both on and off stage.

Ghanaba said in a 1973 interview with John Collins, &quot;I had to make a choice between being a poor imitation of Buddy Rich or playing something they couldn&#x27;t. I could play jazz well, but I possessed something nobody else had, so I started to play African music with a little bit of jazz thrown in, not jazz with a little African thrown in.&quot;

In 1956, Ghanaba&#x27;s first album, &quot;Africa Speaks, America Answers&quot;, was recorded for Decca. It confirmed his reputation as a credible musician. It cross-fertilized African and Western rhythms and introduced authentic instrumentation into the music. In 1964, Decca and German musician Bert Kaempfert released an orchestral version of &quot;That Happy Feeling&quot;, the most popular song on &quot;Africa Speaks, America Answers&quot;, under its original title &quot;Eyi Wala Dong (An African&#x27;s Prayer)&quot; on Kaempfert&#x27;s 1962 album &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Safari&quot;.

A year later, Ghanaba worked on the release of &quot;Themes for African Drums&quot; (RCA Victor, 1958), on which he wanted to use voices, drums, and trombone, with an African influence. He collaborated on this album with trombonist Lawrence Brown, who said what Ghanaba was doing was uncommon in jazz. Cover versions of &quot;Love, the Mystery of&quot; were recorded by Art Blakey and Randy Weston, and Weston used it as his theme song for 40 years.

In December 1959 readers of &quot;Drum&quot; magazine voted Ghanaba the number one drummer. His album &quot;African Rhythms&quot; (Decca, 1962), was supposed to be released a year earlier by Columbia but the deal collapsed. He then joined Martin Salkin and Milt Gabler of Decca. Ghanaba is listed in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Jazz&quot; as a trailblazer who injected African rhythms and instrumentation into mainstream jazz. On one occasion in the early 1970s, when he performed a concert at the Ohene Djan Stadium in Accra, the crowd walked out. He had given up on live performances and stopped playing drums. He only released two albums in the 1970s: &quot;The African Soundz&quot; (RCA Victor, 1972) and &quot;The Divine Drummer&quot; (1978).

He asked Nii Anum Telfer to trace a letter from Africa Obonu, later to be known as Ghanababii, a drums and percussion ensemble based at La in Accra that had written to Ghanaba. It was after Ghanababii were contacted that he began to perform again. He played many gigs, including the monthly Free South Africa shows that he and Nii Anum Telfer organized at the Accra Community Centre in solidarity with Nelson Mandela, who was at the time in prison, and the people of South Africa who were fighting against apartheid. By March 1979, he had brought together Zagba Oyortey, Ofei Nkansah, Wendy Addae, Dorothy Gordon (aiti-KACE), Akuoko, Akwasi Adu Amankwa, Anthony Akoto Ampaw (Che-Che), Tsatsu Tsikata, Fui Tsikata, Prof. Akilagpa Sawyerr, Nii Kwate Owoo, George Quaynor-Mettle, Takyiwa Manu, Kwaku Opoku, F. Ato Austin and James Quarshie. Their intent was to collect, preserve, document, and promote African arts and culture. During the &quot;Soul to Soul&quot; concert in Accra on 8 March 1971, Ghanaba performed with an ensemble of gourd players from Benin.

=== 1980–2008 ===
By the early 1980s Ghanaba had moved to Achimota and had his second daughter, Gye Nyame Hosanna Ghanaba. In 1983, in search of more peace and quiet, he moved to Korleman village. Although he released no major albums during this period, he remained active in the music industry in Ghana. He was instrumental in setting up the Musicians Union of Ghana and led the union as its National President from 1989 to 1992, advocating the need for Ghanaian musicians to use indigenous musical instruments. Ghanaba considered his greatest work to be the African talking drums interpretation of the &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; by Handel. In 1981, he was enstooled as Odomankoma Kyrema (The Divine Drummer) by Aklowa, the African Heritage Village, based at Takeley, near London, England. Three historical concerts in dedication of Africa&#x27;s Contribution to the World took place at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in March 1986. From this period, he performed at the National Theatre, the Goethe-Institut, the Du Bois Centre, and other venues in Ghana.

In 2001, he participated as The Divine Drummer in the stage show &quot;Yaa Asantewaa: Warrior Queen&quot; written by Margaret Busby. It was produced by Adzido Pan-African Dance Ensemble, the African and Caribbean Music Circuit, Black Voices, the Pan-African Orchestra and West Yorkshire Playhouse, which toured the UK and performed in Accra and Kumasi.

Ghanaba liked to share ideas with musicians. Introduced to Robyn Schulkowsky, a female drummer from the U.S. living in Germany, by Sabine Hentzch of the Goethe-Institut in Accra, he said: &quot;My whole life I thought I was the only one on earth who is crazy enough to deal with music the way I do. And now I have to recognize that there is another one; a woman, a white one.&quot; In 1992 he also set up and edited &quot;Hwe&quot; (Observe), a weekly newspaper.

In February 2005, during Black History Month celebrations, Ghanaba was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the W. E. B. Du Bois Centre in Accra. On 18 January 2008, he handed his drumsticks to his son Glenn &quot;Ghanababa&quot; Warren at a ceremony at the National Theatre in Accra.

Ghanaba died on 22 December 2008. On 21 June 2009, a tribute was held at the Jazz Gallery in New York with Randy Weston, Obo Addy, and Kwaku Martin Obeng.

== Africa first ==
On 1 July 1974, the anniversary of Ghana&#x27;s Republic Day, he adopted the name Ghanaba. From a young age he wanted to remain true to his African roots. His pride in his African heritage was revealed in his music and the clothes he wore. His goal was to make the African presence felt in world music.

Max Roach said in 1974 that Ghanaba wanted to strengthen &quot;Afro-American music&quot; by turning to African music for inspiration.

He was disturbed by the desire of many Ghanaians for material goods manufactured outside the country. Ghanaba was among three people picked by Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah to give advice on political, spiritual, and personal matters. He repeated the same service to Jerry John Rawlings when he became head of state.

In the 1970s, Ghanaba joined African Obonu (later known as the Ghanababii) and others to perform the monthly Free South Africa Shows. These were organized at the Accra Community Centre in solidarity with Nelson Mandela and the people of South Africa in the fight against apartheid. Other shows were organized to commemorate important dates in African history, such as Namibia&#x27;s Independence Day, and also to honor Africans such as boxers Azumah Nelson and Ike Quartey. He was an avid reader who had a sign in his house that read &quot;I would rather read&quot;. He collected books, newspapers, and other material that he hoped could be catalogued. New York University expressed interest in his collections. A professor of African Studies at the school established the African Heritage Library in Accra with most of the material coming from Ghanaba&#x27;s collections. Decades earlier, he had wanted to donate it to the government of Nigeria because of its commitment to the second edition of the World Festival of Black Arts in 1977.

A Pan-Africanist, he opined that if political and economic developments did not go hand in hand with cultural developments no progress would be made.

The Ghanaba Afro-Jazz Gallery is an independent art project &quot;dedicated to honouring, and preserving, the legacy of the legendary Kofi Ghanaba&quot; and to promoting Afro-Jazz music and culture.

The title of Robin D. G. Kelley&#x27;s book &quot;Africa Speaks, America Answers&quot; (2012) is taken from Ghanaba&#x27;s 1956 album of the same name.

&quot;Hallelujah!&quot;, a film by Steven Feld about Ghanaba, was screened at the 6th Annual New Mexico Jazz Festival, Albuquerque, followed by a post-screening discussion with Randy Weston and Steven Feld.

<text>(doing business as Camelot Software Planning) is a Japanese video game developer established in 1994 and headquartered in Shinjuku, Tokyo. It is known for developing sports games, particularly in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. 

== History ==

Camelot was founded on April 4, 1994 by Shugo Takahashi, the brother of producer Hiroyuki Takahashi, with the intention of developing games for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation. They developed their first game, &quot;Beyond the Beyond&quot;, while providing assistance to Sonic! Software Planning on &quot;Shining Wisdom&quot;. They would then provide assistance on Sonic&#x27;s next game, &quot;Shining the Holy Ark&quot;.

In April 1998, after Sega merged its investment in Sonic into its subsidiary Nextech, Hiroyuki Takahashi joined Camelot as its president. Camelot then finished development of &quot;Shining Force III&quot; in Sonic&#x27;s place and moved on to develop titles for Nintendo consoles.

The studio has developed many &quot;Mario&quot; sports games, including &quot;Mario Golf&quot;, and &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, as well as the &quot;Golden Sun&quot; series of role-playing games.
The creation of the &quot;Mario&quot; character Waluigi can be attributed to Camelot, after &quot;Mario&quot; creator Shigeru Miyamoto consulted with them to create a &quot;Wario-like&quot; counterpart for Luigi during the development of &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;.

<doc id="1225570" wikidata="Q7712760" url="?curid=1225570" title="The Affairs of Annabel">
<text>The Affairs of Annabel is a 1938 American comedy film directed by Benjamin Stoloff and starring Lucille Ball, Jack Oakie and Ruth Donnelly. It was produced and distributed by RKO Pictures. The film was followed by the sequel &quot;Annabel Takes a Tour&quot; the same year, also starring Oakie, Ball and Donnelly.

==Plot==
Wonder Pictures studio publicity man Lanny Morgan has actress Annabel Allison taken to prison in order to generate publicity before the release of her new film. However, when Annabel is released one month later, she finds that nobody has noticed, and she has Lanny fired. But when he pays a struggling actress to pretend to be his sick mother, Annabel has Lanny rehired, and he immediately begins plotting his next stunt.

The head of Wonder Pictures informs Annabel that her film has been canceled, and that she is to star in a new film, &quot;The Maid and the Man&quot;. Lanny arranges to have her work as Mary, a maid for the Fletchers, their teenage son Robert and inventor Major. While Robert becomes infatuated with Annabel, she is expected to cook and clean for the family, so she calls on Lanny to help. Meanwhile, the investors interested in one of Major&#x27;s inventions, a rubber ring placed around a plate so that it will bounce rather than break when dropped, appear in the morning newspaper as robbers. They are in fact waiting for their own publicity to dissipate so that they can make a getaway.

Back at Wonder Pictures, &quot;The Maid and the Man&quot; has been scrapped, but when Lanny calls Annabel to tell her, she answers that she cannot leave. Though at first confused, he finds Annabel&#x27;s police mug shot in the paper along with the robbers, and forms a plan to outfit 50 extras as policemen. As they march toward the house firing blanks, the robbers return fire with real bullets, and the extras scatter. Lanny sneaks into the house alone but is captured.

When the real policemen arrive, the robbers try to escape, using Lanny and Allison as shields. Instead, Annabel uses her martial arts training to throw one of the robbers to the ground, while Lanny bites the other.

Annabel returns to Wonder Pictures and is disappointed to find that &quot;The Maid and the Man&quot; has been replaced by &quot;The Diamond Smuggler&quot;, in which she is to play the lead. On her way out, Annabel collects a gift that Lanny had arranged for her to receive, and is apprehended when the police open it to discover the precious jewels inside. Lanny watches from the front of the new billboard for &quot;The Diamond Smuggler&quot; as Annabel is driven away screaming.

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Frank S. Nugent speculated that &quot;The Affairs of Annabel&quot; would be the first in a series: &quot;A promising first, we might add; in a light farce vein, with some flip players in it. ... Between them, and with the help of a smartly written script, they have created an amusing trifle about a movie actress and a press agent with a Svengali complex. ... Miss Ball, who is rapidly becoming one of our brightest comediennes, plays it broadly and without a disruptive trace of whimsy.&quot;

<text>Ernesto Djédjé (1948–1983) was an Ivorian musician from Daloa. His parents were Wolof and Bété. Djédjé began playing music at fifteen when he became a guitarist with Ivoiro Star, a leading dopé band, in 1962. He moved to Paris in 1968 and became a student. He continued to perform and made his first recording with Anoma Brou Felix in 1970 with the help of Manu Dibango.

In 1972, he returned to his homeland to lead the San Pedro Orchestra. He later formed a band called Les Ziglibithiens and pioneered a musical style called Ziglibithy based on a kind of Bété roots music combined with Congolese rumba rhythms. Djedje&#x27;s Ziglibithy is highly syncopated dance music, in which the sinuous guitar lines are punctuated with fat horns.

Djedje recorded his first solo album in 1977, calling it &quot;Ziboté&quot; with producer Gbadamassi Raïmi. Another album, &quot;Le Roi du Ziglibithy&quot;, was released on Badmos Records in 1977. He also released albums entitled &quot;Aguisse&quot; (also on Badmos Records), &quot;Tizere&quot; and &quot;Zouzoup Ale&quot;. All of these vinyl LP&#x27;s are rare today, although &quot;Le Roi du Ziglibithy&quot;, which is arguably Djedje&#x27;s best record, has been reissued on CD by Popular African Music, headquartered in Germany.

Ivoirian president Félix Houphouët-Boigny honored him for his contributions to national culture in 1982. Djédjé died suddenly of an untreated ulcer in 1983 at 35, although many claim that he was poisoned.

<doc id="1225584" wikidata="Q4780361" url="?curid=1225584" title="Apollo Theatre">
<text>The Apollo Theatre is a Grade II listed West End theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue in the City of Westminster, in central London. Designed by the architect Lewin Sharp for owner Henry Lowenfeld, it became the fourth legitimate theatre to be constructed on the street when it opened its doors on 21 February 1901, with the American musical comedy &quot;The Belle of Bohemia&quot;.

==History==

===Construction===
Henry Lowenfeld had bought land on the newly created Shaftesbury Avenue at the turn of the 20th century—next door to the Lyric Theatre, which opened in 1888—and as a consequence the Apollo is one of the few theatres in London to be freehold.

The only complete theatre design of architect Lewin Sharp, the Apollo was specifically designed for musical theatre and named after the Greek god of the arts and leader of the muses. It was constructed by builder Walter Wallis of plain London brick in keeping with the neighbouring streets; the front piece is in the Renaissance style with a sculpted stone fascia by T. Simpson. The structure encloses a four-level auditorium, with three cantilevered balconies and a first-floor central loggia, decorated in the Louis XIV Style by Hubert van Hooydonk. In keeping with then European style, each level has its own foyer and promenade.

Owing to the death of Queen Victoria the previous month, it became the first London theatre to be completed in the Edwardian period. The capacity on the opening night, 21 February 1901, was 893, with a proscenium of wide and deep.

The capacity today is 757 seats, with the balcony on the 3rd tier considered the steepest in London.

===Operations===
Owing to a relatively unsuccessful opening, impresario Tom B. Davis took a lease on the building, and hence management of operations, from 1902. The theatre was renovated by Ernest Schaufelberg in 1932, with a private foyer and anteroom installed to the Royal Box. Prince Littler took control of the theatre in 1944.

Stoll Moss Group purchased the theatre in 1975, selling it to Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Group and Bridgepoint Capital in 2000. Nica Burns and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased the theatre and several others in 2005, creating Nimax Theatres, which still owns the theatre.

=== 2013 ceiling collapse ===
On 19 December 2013, at about 20:15 GMT, of the auditorium&#x27;s ornate plasterwork ceiling collapsed around 40 minutes into a performance of &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot;. It brought down a lighting rig and a section of balcony, thereby trapping two people and injuring around 88, including seven seriously. There were 720 people in the audience at the time. The incident was preceded by heavy rain.

The emergency services responded with 25 ambulance crews, an air ambulance rapid response team, 8 fire engines with more than 50 firefighters, and the Metropolitan Police. Casualties were taken to the foyers of the adjacent Gielgud and Queen&#x27;s theatres, where the emergency services could triage. The London Ambulance Service later stated that they had treated 76 injured people, with 58 taken to four London hospitals, some on commandeered buses. Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; NHS Foundation Trust said 34 adults and 5 children were subsequently treated in accident and emergency at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital.

The venue reopened on 26 March 2014, with an adaptation of &quot;Let the Right One In&quot; produced by the National Theatre of Scotland. The owners were able to reopen the theatre by sealing the fourth level and balcony with a temporary floor, which allowed investigators to continue their work in determining the cause of the collapse. That month Westminster City Council issued a notice to other historic theatres saying that the ceiling collapse appeared to have been caused by the gradual deterioration of Hessian wadding mixed into plaster of Paris to form the ties lashing timbers together, which had probably been in place since the theatre was built.

==Production history==

The opening caused a public uproar, with a selected audience for the first performance, on Thursday 21 February 1901, and the first public performance scheduled for 22 February. &quot;The Times&quot; refused to review the private opening, instead waiting until the first public production on the following day. The opening production was the American musical comedy &quot;The Belle of Bohemia&quot;, which survived for 72 performances—17 more than it had accomplished when produced on Broadway. The production was followed by John Martin-Harvey&#x27;s season, including &quot;A Cigarette Maker&#x27;s Romance&quot; and &quot;The Only Way&quot;, an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;.

George Edwardes produced a series of successful Edwardian musical comedies, including &quot;Kitty Grey&quot; (1901), &quot;Three Little Maids&quot; and &quot;The Girl from Kays&quot; (1902). An English version of André Messager&#x27;s light opera &quot;Véronique&quot; became a hit in 1904, starring with Ruth Vincent, who also starred in Edward German&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot; in 1907 in which Cicely Courtneidge made her London debut. Between 1908 and 1912 the theatre hosted H. G. Pelissier&#x27;s &quot;The Follies&quot;. After this it staged a variety of works, including seasons of plays by Charles Hawtrey in 1913, 1914 and 1924, and Harold Brighouse&#x27;s &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; in 1916. &quot;Inside the Lines&quot; by Earl Derr Biggers ran for 421 performances in 1917. Gilbert Dayle&#x27;s &quot;What Would a Gentleman Do?&quot; played in 1918 and &quot;Tilly of Bloomsbury&quot; by Ian Hay was the success in 1919.

George Grossmith, Jr. and Edward Laurillard managed the theatre from 1920 to 1923, presenting a series of plays and revivals, including &quot;Such a Nice Young Man&quot; by H.F. Maltby (1920) and &quot;Trilby&quot; (1922), the latter based on the 1894 George du Maurier novel of the same name. They had produced &quot;The Only Girl&quot; here in 1916 and &quot;Tilly of Bloomsbury&quot; in 1919. &quot;The Fake&quot; was produced in 1924, starring Godfrey Tearle. 1927 saw &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot; and &quot;Whispering Wires&quot;, with Henry Daniel. The next year, Laurence Olivier starred in R. C. Sherriff&#x27;s &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot; and Ivor Novello&#x27;s &quot;A Symphony in Two Flats&quot; both played in 1929. Diana Wynyard starred as Charlotte Brontë in Clemence Dane&#x27;s &quot;Wild Decembers&quot; in 1932. Marion Lorne was the star of a number of plays by her husband Walter Hackett from 1934 to 1937. Ian Hay&#x27;s &quot;Housemaster&quot; had the most successful run in this period with 662 performances from 1936. Raymond Massey starred in Robert Sherwood&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot; in 1938. Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s play &quot;Gaslight&quot; held the stage in 1939, and Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;Flare Path&quot; played in 1942.

Control of the theatre transferred to Prince Littler in 1944. John Clements and Kay Hammond starred that year in a revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot;, and Margaret Rutherford starred in &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; in 1948, followed by Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson in &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot;, directed by John Gielgud in 1949. After this, &quot;Seagulls Over Sorrento&quot; ran for over three years beginning in 1950. The theatre&#x27;s longest run was the comedy &quot;Boeing-Boeing&quot;, starring Patrick Cargill and David Tomlinson, which opened in 1962 and transferred to the Duchess Theatre in 1965. In 1968 Gielgud starred in Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Forty Years On&quot;, and in 1970 he returned in David Storey&#x27;s &quot;Home&quot;, with Ralph Richardson. He returned to the theatre in 1988, at the age of 83, in &quot;The Best of Friends&quot; by Hugh Whitemore.

A number of hit comedies transferred to or from the theatre in the 1970s and 1980s, and other important plays here during the period included Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;Separate Tables&quot;, with John Mills in 1977, &quot;Romantic Comedy&quot; with Tom Conti and Pauline Collins in 1983, Lyle Kessler&#x27;s &quot;Orphans&quot; in 1986 with Albert Finney, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rappaport&quot; the same year, with Paul Scofield, and Dorothy Tutin, Eileen Atkins and Siân Phillips in &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Ladies&quot; in 1987. &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; played in 1988, starring Wendy Hiller, and 1989 saw Zoë Wanamaker in &quot;Mrs Klein&quot;, Vanessa Redgrave in &quot;A Madhouse in Goa&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds FAB&quot; starring Andrew Dawson and Gavin Robertson, and Peter O&#x27;Toole in &quot;Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell&quot;. Penelope Wilton starred in Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; in 1993, and &quot;In Praise of Love&quot; played in 1995 with Peter Bowles. Mark Little starred in the Laurence Olivier Award-winning one-man show, &quot;Defending the Caveman&quot; in 1999.

<text>John Vartan (February 8, 1945 – December 15, 2004) was an American entrepreneur and educational philanthropist in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area where he lived.

==Business career==

Vartan grew up in the Armenian village of Anjar in Lebanon, also known as Haoush Mousa. After obtaining an engineering degree from Michigan Technological University, and a master&#x27;s degree from Pennsylvania State University, he started working for Gannett Fleming, Inc. in the early 1970s. He subsequently started his own firms which include:
* Vartan Group, Inc. (real estate development)
* Vartan Construction Company (building construction)
* Vartan National Bank (later sold and renamed Centric Bank in early 2007)
* Parev (restaurant business)

Vartan became an expert in developing relatively inexpensive office buildings that helped spur development in the greater Harrisburg area. Vartan capitalized on its low land prices. Often allied with Harrisburg Mayor Stephen R. Reed, Vartan helped change downtown Harrisburg by acquiring substandard residences and businesses, and constructing new office buildings in their stead. 

Yet as Harrisburg developed, intense competition emerged. Faced with what he considered as unfair public subsidization and favoritism to competitors, Vartan was never hesitant in filing lawsuits against both competitors and local governments. At one point, his ambitious development plans aroused so much community opposition that he threatened to leave Harrisburg. A &quot;Committee to Keep John Vartan in Harrisburg&quot; was formed, and persuadedhim to stay put.

Vartan&#x27;s crowning achievement was perhaps his re-establishment of Harrisburg&#x27;s &quot;Tuesday Club&quot;, founded by state Senator Harvey Taylor, in the 1950s. To help subsidize the building, he constructed the first permanent headquarters for the &quot;Tuesday Club&quot; at his own expense. He also established a restaurant, Parev, decorated with distinctive Armenian art, to provide another high quality restaurant for Harrisburg. 

In early 1989, Vartan was diagnosed with throat cancer. Even though his cancer made it difficult for him to talk and to be understood at times, he continued with his business expansion and civic leadership. On November 22, 2004, the Management announced that the Vartan family would be taking over the operations of the &quot;Vartan Group&quot;. Vartan died on December 15, 2004, after his 15-year battle with throat cancer. He was survived by his wife, his four children, his three brothers, and his sister.

==Philanthropy==
Vartan&#x27;s faith in the American legal process made him responsive to suggestions that Harrisburg needed a new law school. Approached by Widener University for help in 1986 because of his dual role as a developer and the then-largest individual contributor to Penn State University, he donated land, including his own home, and cash of nearly $2 million, and offered financial loans.

After the Harrisburg campus of Widener University School of Law opened in 1989, Vartan donated the surrounding land to the campus, including a home that he had built to replace his first home. After the establishment of the law school, Widener University added nursing and social work programs to the campus.

He was named to the PoliticsPA list of politically influential Pennsylvanians.

Vartan&#x27;s generosity to Widener University led to renewed requests from Penn State. He then made donations for two Harrisburg buildings, one across from the state capitol, and the other one, a few blocks away. Vartan&#x27;s educational philanthropy also included the funding of a Harrisburg public school program of after-school tutoring.

<doc id="1225608" wikidata="Q488129" url="?curid=1225608" title="Red River (manga)">
<text>, also known as Anatolia Story, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Chie Shinohara. It was published by Shōgakukan in their &quot;Sho-Comi&quot; magazine from January 1995 to June 2002. It was collected in 28 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. It is published in English in North America by Viz Media.

As of March 2019, the manga had over 20 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series. In 2001, &quot;Red River&quot; won the Shogakukan Manga Award for the &quot;shōjo&quot; category.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
The story takes place during the reign of King Suppiluliuma I, at a time when the Hittite Empire was near its peak in power, rivaled only by Egypt, which was then ruled by the young Pharaoh Tutankhamen. Many of the people and events in the story are drawn from actual history, from Princes Kail Mursili, Sari Arnuwanda, and Zannanza, to battles with the neighboring Mitanni kingdom around the town of Kizzuwatna.

===Plot===
&quot;Red River&quot; is about a fifteen-year-old Japanese girl named Yuri Suzuki, who time travels to Hattusa, the capital of the Hittite Empire in Anatolia. She was summoned by Queen Nakia who means to use Yuri as a human sacrifice. Yuri&#x27;s blood is the key element needed in placing a curse upon the princes of the land so that they will perish, leaving Nakia&#x27;s son as the sole heir to the throne. As the story progresses, however, Yuri not only repeatedly manages to escape Nakia&#x27;s scheming, she also becomes revered as an incarnation of the goddess Ishtar and falls in love with prince Kail.

==Characters==
===Main===
:She is the main character of the story. Only fifteen at the start of the series, Yuri is willing to take up any charitable cause. As she possesses knowledge far greater than any woman of the time (such as recognition of iron, knowledge of 20th century hygiene and famous war strategies), and often seems to find herself in situations that &quot;prove&quot; she is Ishtar, she is considered to have divine powers and is thought by most to be the living incarnation of the goddess of love and war, Ishtar. As such, she is frequently referred to as . Despite this, Yuri is insecure and a tomboy; she generally prefers to dress in men&#x27;s clothing for the sake of practicality, much to the consternation and dismay of her handmaids. The general opinion holds that she is &quot;not strikingly beautiful&quot; and &quot;possesses little womanly charm&quot; (although through the perseverance of her handmaids, she has sometimes been shown to be transformed into a stunning beauty). However, her natural charm, goodness, and selflessness win her the undying affection and loyalty of many people, both Hittites and their enemies. She is an accomplished gymnast who learns the arts of sword fighting and archery in order to protect herself and help Kail survive his stepmother&#x27;s machinations.
:Yuri falls in love with Kail early on in the story. Torn between her desire to return to her original time and her love for Kail, which he reciprocates, Yuri ultimately decides to remain in Anatolia forever. In a desperate attempt to overthrow Queen Nakia, she raises a private army and unites other factions loyal to her and Kail, and eventually succeeds in deposing Queen Nakia once and for all. She marries Kail and ascends to the title of Tawananna, the Hittite Queen. 

:Historically speaking, Yuri is most likely based on Puduhepa, the priestess of Ishtar who married King Hattusili III. She has been referred to as &quot;one of the most influential women known from the Ancient Near East.&quot; She played an important role in diplomacy with Egypt and was a co-signatory in the Ulmi-Teshub treaty.
:He is the third prince of the Hittite empire, son of King Suppililiuma and the second Tawananna, Queen Hinti. He is described as attractive and beautiful. At the beginning of the series, he finds Yuri attempting to escape from Nakia&#x27;s guards, and gives her the gift of understanding and speaking their language by way of a kiss. He rescues Yuri from being used as a sacrifice for the god Teshub by claiming to have taken her virginity, and takes her as a concubine to keep up appearances. He finds Yuri to be quite unlike any woman he has ever met, and promises to help her find a way home to Japan. However, he soon begins to struggle with his own growing love and desire for her. He initially calls Yuri his concubine and the incarnation of Ishtar in order to protect her from Queen Nakia, but eventually begins to believe his own tale as the legend of Yuri as Ishtar and his feelings towards her evolve beyond his control.

:Kail is loyal to those he cares for, but is constantly at odds with his stepmother, the third Tawananna, Queen Nakia. Her desire to make her son, Prince Juda, the heir to the throne is the prime motivation behind Kail&#x27;s search for a woman whom he can love unconditionally and who has the qualities of a true queen. A powerful priest and sorcerer in his own right, he has the ability to control wind and air, and is one of the few who can counter Nakia&#x27;s spells. Halfway through the series (Volume 12), he ascends to the throne as King Mursili II. His utmost devotion to his country and his people is the reason behind their loyalty to him. He is a strong, charismatic tactician, and as King, he endeavors to put an end to any wars and establish a peaceful age for his nation. 

===Enemies===
:The third and current Tawananna (queen) of the Hittite Empire. A former princess of Babylonia, Nakia was sent to Suppililiuma at the age of 15 in exchange for monetary aid. Desperately lonely and jealous of the emperor&#x27;s second wife Queen Hinti, Nakia offered all of her jewelry to Urhi and begged him to escape with her to start a new life. When he claimed he could not give her the life and children she deserved, she reluctantly &quot;fulfilled her duty&quot; and gave birth to Prince Juda. Because Juda bore little to no resemblance to Suppililiuma, Nakia dedicated her life to ensuring that he assumed the Hittite throne by any means necessary.

:It was Nakia&#x27;s spell that took Yuri from her original time frame, and she intended to use Yuri&#x27;s blood as part of a curse to kill the five princes ahead of her son in line for the throne. Foiled by Prince Kail in her initial attempts to secure Yuri, Nakia constantly and shamelessly manipulates people and situations to her benefit. Her schemings come to an end, however, when her son Juda publicly attacks her for her evil deeds, screaming that he renounces the royal throne; she is subsequently deposed and placed under his supervision.

:Nakia is a high priestess, and she has control over water, using certain kinds of enchanted water as a form of mind control. The character is loosely based on the historical Tawananna Mal-Nikal of Babylon.

:Nakia&#x27;s personal servant, an assassin who usually takes the guise of a royal priest. He takes advantage of his position and his uncommonly feminine appearance to gain the trust of people to be used in Nakia&#x27;s plots against Yuri and Prince Kail. His surname is not well known, and is used when he chooses to go incognito. Under his robes, he hides a number of whipping scars. In Volume 11, he loses an eye to Rusafa and wears an ornate eyepatch for most of the rest of the series.

:A former member of a royal family, Urhi&#x27;s nation was invaded and destroyed when he was a young boy. Taken captive by the invading nation&#x27;s commander, he was savagely beaten (leaving the scars on his back), raped and later castrated to ensure that his family&#x27;s bloodline would not continue. He arrived in Hattusa after being purchased to serve as a priest in the seraglio temple.

:Urhi is initially rumored to be the true father of Prince Juda; this is proven false when his castration is revealed. However, he and Nakia did share a strong romantic interest in each other.

:The crown prince of the Mitanni kingdom, son of King Tushratta, and younger brother of Nefertiti. Called the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; for his ruthless demeanor and behavior at war, he launches a campaign against the Hittites and kidnaps Yuri in an attempt to demoralize them. This strategy fails, as the Mitanni people rally around Yuri when she tends to the injured and sick in the capital, and even Mattiwaza himself is eventually won over by Yuri&#x27;s charm. When the Mitanni kingdom is completely overrun and the king murdered by his own soldiers, Mattiwaza releases Yuri, abdicates the throne, and departs with his head concubine Nadia. In volume 23, having received a pardon from Kail, Mattiwaza returns as an ally of the Hitties against the Egyptians and is now the new ruler of the Mitanni kingdom.

:During her captivity, Mattizawa reveals to Yuri that his sister Tatukia was sold to the Egyptians to be a queen, and is now known as Nefertiti. Though Mattiwaza and Tatukia were siblings, they had an affair when younger. Her change from a caring sister and lover to a cold and calculating schemer had a severe effect on Mattizawa; while he ruled his people with intelligence and consideration, he had no compassion for the lives and feelings of others - until he met Yuri. The jewel Mattiwaza wears of his forehead is a memento of his love for his sister, and this memento is passed on to Yuri, who wears it around her neck for much of the rest of the series.

:The character is loosely based on the historical Shattiwaza of Mitanni, who was actually the brother of Tushratta and uncle of Tadukhipa, who is sometimes erroneously identified with Nefertiti.

Nefertiti (Tatukia or Tadukhipa)
:A famous queen of Egypt, once a princess of Mitanni, and the blood sister of Mattiwaza, with whom she had an affair when they were younger. She was sold to Egypt to solidify the legitimacy of the Mitanni kingdom, and was married to Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten). In many ways she is the Egyptian counterpart of Queen Nakia: a powerful and influential schemer working for her own desires, not for the welfare of the people or the nation. It is suggested that she has her hand in Tutankhamen&#x27;s death, and she also conspires with Nakia for the downfall of the Hittite empire.

:A fictionalized conflation of the historical Tadukhipa and Nefertiti. Modern Egyptologists are of the opinion that these women were two different wives of Akhenaten.

:In the English version, instead of the more conforming version of her name listed above, the spelling &#x27;Tatukia&#x27; is used.

Zuwa
:The leader of the fierce Kashuga (Kaska) tribe, who works for Queen Nakia. Larger than the average man, he is also very bloodthirsty and sadistic, collecting the skins of his human victims, much like a hunter would collect the skins of animals, and crafting his attire from them. After killing Tito, he meets his end, outmaneuvered and outsmarted, by Yuri&#x27;s hands, who shatters his outsized copper sword and the mud bricks beneath his feet with an iron blade, causing him to fall to his death from the palace walls.

===Royalty===
King Suppililiuma 
: The ruler of the Hittites, by the beginning of the story he is already advanced in years. He has fought several wars with the Mitanni and the Egyptians, and his reign is considered to be a high point in the history of the people. He later falls victim to the Seven Day Fever.

Queen Hinti
:The late second wife of King Suppiluliuma and Kail&#x27;s mother. From the flashbacks and mentionings scattered throughout the story, she is depicted as a gentle, caring queen and mother. She was murdered by Nakia so that she could usurp the position of Tawananna.

Sari Arnuwanda 
:The Crown Prince, oldest son of King Suppiluliuma and the King&#x27;s first wife. Largely invalid, he relies heavily on his brothers, specifically Zannanza and Kail, in order to fulfill his duties. After he ascends to the throne, he in turn picks Kail to be his heir, as he has no sons. Shortly afterwards, he is assassinated by Urhi, and Yuri gets blamed for his murder.

Zannanza Hattusili 
:The fourth son of King Suppiluliuma (with a palace maid), he is very skilled with swords and military tactics, and is the mayor of the Hittite city of Kadesh. Prince Zannanza is very fond of Kail, whom he regards as a full brother, and he was also raised by Kail&#x27;s mother after his own mother died. He also falls in love with Yuri, which unfortunately is exploited by Queen Nakia. Zannanza is very loyal to Kail, and despite his feelings, does not try to get in the way of the relationship between Kail and Yuri. He is betrothed to Ankhesenamen, the widow of Tutankhamen, in an attempt to make peace between the Hittites and Egypt, but never arrives at his destination, getting assassinated en route. Only Yuri, who accompanied him, escapes to bring news of his death.

Juda Haspasrupi 
:The sixth son of King Suppiluliuma and the current Tawananna, Queen Nakia. Despite his mother&#x27;s constant and blatantly evil scheming, Prince Juda is a kind boy who does not understand his mother&#x27;s enmity towards his beloved brothers, particularly his favorite, Kail. He has a strong interest in astronomy, and despite his (for modern times comparatively) young age (14 when he is first introduced) he is mentioned to have at least one wife and two concubines. His dream is to serve as a domestic advisor to Kail, whom he wishes to become king, and he thinks of Yuri as an older sister.

:Juda falls victim to his mother&#x27;s schemes quite often, but he is an unwilling pawn who must be controlled by magic to cooperate. When he eventually discovers the truth behind his mother&#x27;s schemes, he attempts suicide. He later tries to slay his mother for attempted murder upon Yuri in a fit of rage, permanently renouncing his right of succession to the throne as his protest against Nakia and his support for Yuri and Kail, before Yuri and Kail intervene.

Rois Telipinu
:The second son of King Suppililiuma (with a concubine), he is not considered to be one of the serious claimants to the throne and is largely relegated to royal ceremonies. He is the mayor of the Hittite city of Haleb.

Mali Piyasili
:The fifth son of King Suppililiuma and mayor of Karkemish. He is stabbed by Ramses in battle and later dies from his wounds.

Nepis Ilra
:Kail&#x27;s older half-sister and a priestess. She is blind from birth.

===Servants===
Tito 
:Yuri&#x27;s first true friend after her arrival in Anatolia. Tito is a servant in the palace, but also the only son of Talos, the head of the Hatti clan, and the inheritor of the secret of iron-making. While helping Yuri escape from Queen Nakia, he is murdered by Nakia&#x27;s servant, Zuwa. Ultimately, it is her desire to avenge Tito&#x27;s death that causes Yuri to stay even when given the chance of returning home. Yuri is framed for the death, and his sisters attempt to kill her in retaliation. Tito is finally avenged when Yuri defeats Zuwa and reveals him as the true killer. In gratitude, Talos granted Tito&#x27;s inheritance to Yuri, and Tito&#x27;s sisters take his place in the royal household.

Hadi 
:The eldest sister of Tito, she is an intelligent and skilled fighter. Urged on by Urhi, she and her sisters tried to kill Yuri in order to avenge Tito&#x27;s death, but after finding out the truth, they pledge their lives as Yuri&#x27;s handmaids. Though Hadi admires Yuri for her bravery and kindness, her attempts to get Yuri to be more traditionally feminine have very mixed results.

Ryui and Shala 
:Twin sisters of Hadi and Tito, both loyal and capable fighters in their own right. Along with Hadi, they pledge their lives as Yuri&#x27;s loyal handmaids. Both of them often conspire with Hadi and Kikkuri to draw Kail and Yuri closer together, and eventually, both Ryui and Shala become romantically involved with Kikkuri, due to similar tastes and personalities.

Kikkuri 
:Prince Kail&#x27;s servant, who goes everywhere with him. Though quite cautious and timid by nature, he is not above conspiring with Yuri&#x27;s handmaids and working behind Kail&#x27;s back in order to encourage him to &quot;settle down&quot; with Yuri. In an omake chapter at the end of the story, he writes a horse care manual that is in modern day times discovered in the ruins of the old Hittite empire. The character is loosely based on historical Kikkuli, the master horse trainer of the land Mitanni.

Ilbani 
:Prince Kail&#x27;s strategic adviser, foster brother, palace steward, and childhood friend. Though very serious and formal, Ilvani has a dry wit and an insatiable urge to find a wife for Prince Kail. (He can also appear from behind curtains at will.) At first unsure of Yuri&#x27;s intentions and suitability, he quickly decides that Yuri is the perfect wife for Kail and the best possible candidate to unseat Nakia as Tawananna. He is one of the few to consistently see through Queen Nakia&#x27;s plots and has been known to manipulate Urhi to benefit his counter schemes. He is also very resourceful; at one time, Yuri says that the reason why Ilbani is so trusted is because he can &quot;find advantages in the most outrageous situations.&quot; His loyalty to Kail and Yuri often seems rooted in a greater loyalty to the Hittite nation on the whole.

Ursula 
:Initially used as a pawn by Queen Nakia, she is introduced as a false Ishtar in a town ravaged by the Seven Day Fever. When unveiled by Prince Kail and subsequently forgiven, she joins Yuri&#x27;s retinue as a handmaid. She falls in love with Kash, and they become betrothed, but she ultimately sacrifices her life for Yuri when Yuri is falsely accused of the assassination of King Arnuwanda. Before her execution, she gives her hair to Kash, who wears her braid as his headband until the day Urhi is revealed as the true assassin.

===Hittite generals and military leaders===
Rusafa 
:The leader of the Hittite archers, he is highly loyal to Yuri and Kail. Free-spirited and easygoing, he nevertheless falls under Nakia&#x27;s control at one point. His name is often translated as &quot;Lucifer&quot; due to the ambiguity of the katakana used in the original Japanese.

:Rusafa&#x27;s unrequited love for Yuri makes him go out of his way to protect her, even if it means disobeying orders from his superiors. When he finds that Kail and Yuri are already in love (at which point he too loves her), he is somewhat dismayed when Kail announces marriage. Just as Kash keeps Ursula&#x27;s hair as a keepsake, Rusafa wears the obsidian sliver Yuri had passed to him to save his life in volume 17 around his neck as a sign of his devotion for her. After meeting him, Hathor Nefert (Ramses&#x27; sister) falls in love with him even though she is aware that he is in love with Yuri. However, before he dies, he seems to have been developing feelings of respect and admiration for Nefert. Rusafa is killed by Nakia at her final attempt at the lives of Yuri and Kail, thereby stopping Nakia for good.

Kash 
:The leader of the Hittite chariots, and a guard of Prince Kail. He falls in love with Ursula not long after she comes to live in the palace. Following her execution, he wears a braided band made from her hair around his head.

Mittannamuwa 
:The leader of the Hittite infantry, he does not play much of a role in palace politics, as he is considerably older and spends most of his time out in the field.

Shubas 
:The second commander of the Hittite archers, he is first introduced in book thirteen of the series, having gone to war with Egypt along with Mursili II, as Shubas&#x27; superior officer is serving the second army in Arzawa with Yuri. Like his fellow officer Zora, he seems to be largely inexperienced at first, a fact remarked upon by Kikkuri.

Zora 
:The second commander of the Hittite infantry, he is first introduced in book thirteen of the series, having gone to war with Egypt along with Mursili II, as Zora&#x27;s superior officer is serving the second army in Arzawa with Yuri. Like his fellow officer Shubas, he seems to be largely inexperienced at first, a fact remarked upon by Kikkuri.

:In Volume 20, it is discovered that critical information is being leaked from behind the Hittite lines to Egyptian forces. Zora is discovered to be the informant; however, it is to Queen Nakia that he is submitting the information, who in turn has been forwarding it to the Egyptians. When confronted, Zora said that in exchange for this deed, he had been promised a promotion, citing jealousy against Shubas, who had been promoted while Zora had not, despite the two of them being close friends and having entered the Hittite armies at roughly the same time.

===Egyptians===
User Ramses 
:A military officer from a noble family. In the manga, he is easily distinguished by his heterochromatic eyes (the left one is sepia, the right one is golden) and blond hair. He has a lot of sisters, most chiefly among them Nefert. His name is sometimes romanized as Usr Ramses.

:Ramses initially encounters Yuri while on patrol near the Egyptian-Hittite border awaiting Zannanza&#x27;s caravan. He is intrigued by Yuri&#x27;s ingenuity and bravery in preventing a war between Egypt and the Hittites following Zannanza&#x27;s assassination, and requests to be assigned to Hattusa as a military liaison. His true motive is revealed when he later kidnaps Yuri. He tells her he has ambitions of becoming the next Egyptian pharaoh by ousting the current, corrupt leaders of the Egyptian 18th Dynasty. To do this, he needs a woman of his own caliber, like Yuri, to be his future queen.

:His first and second attempts to kidnap her are foiled by Kail. A third attempt is successful when a desperate Rusafa seeks his help when Yuri is weakened and in danger of dying after a shipwreck which also causes Yuri to have a miscarriage. After Rusafa escapes Egypt and informs Kail that Yuri did not die in the shipwreck, Kail sends Ilbani, Hadi, Ryui, and Shala to Egypt. By this time, Ramses, who had initially only wanted Yuri because of his ambitions, has truly fallen in love with her. But soon after Kail&#x27;s servants arrive, Egyptian soldiers come to arrest Yuri for interfering with an official&#x27;s attempt to cut off the hand of a child. Ramses goes in her stead to Queen Nefertiti&#x27;s palace. After Yuri rescues him from death at her hands, he gives her a document found in Queen Nefertiti&#x27;s palace which concerns Queen Nakia&#x27;s betrayal before she goes back to Kail.

:Later, Ramses and Kail fight to a draw at the Battle of Kadesh at the Orontes River, and Ramses accepts defeat and asks Yuri to bear a daughter to marry his son (a wish which does not actually come to pass, but is finally consummated by their grandchildren). He later becomes Ramses I, first Pharaoh of the Egyptian 19th Dynasty. (In actual history, Ramses was known as Paramesse prior to succeeding Horemheb, the historical pharaoh of this period. The actual User Ramses would be Ramses II, a contemporary of Mursilli II&#x27;s son, Muwatalli, and during whose reign the actual Battle of Kadesh occurred, which eventually resulted in the oldest known peace treaty, the Ramses–Hattusili Treaty.)

Hathor Nefert 
:The oldest of Ramses younger sisters is a free-spirited and flirtatious personality. During the time when Yuri is in captivity in Egypt, Nefert comes to view her as a little sister, and also takes a romantic interest in Rusafa even though she is aware that he is in love with Yuri. After, Rusafa dies, she is shown grieving for him. Like Ramses, she has blonde hair, though she wears a black wig to look more native.

Ankhesenamen
:The daughter of Nefertiti and the wife of Tutankhamen. When Tutankhamen dies, her hand in marriage is offered to a son of the Hittite king, but this deal is never completed due to treachery, and she is married off to a high-level government official, Ay.

Horemheb
:The pharaoh who rules Egypt by the time Yuri arrives there (volume 20 of the series). In the series he is actually a weak puppet king under Nefertiti&#x27;s control.

Ay 
:A formerly a high-level (though largely incompetent) government official, he ascends to the position of Pharaoh after the failure of Ankhesenamen&#x27;s arranged marriage to the Hittite Empire. Ramses sees him as a personification of the corruption of the Egyptian 18th Dynasty, having married a girl &quot;young enough to be his granddaughter&quot;.

===Animals===
Aslan 
:Yuri&#x27;s black war horse, whom only Yuri can ride or control. (In volume 13, Aslan is referred to as a &quot;she,&quot; which may - or may not - be different from the original translation.) In the mythology surrounding her, Ishtar as a goddess is said to have ridden a lion into battle, and Yuri is often depicted as such, since in the Turkish language Aslan means &quot;lion&quot;.

Shimshek 
:Yuri&#x27;s hawk, raised by her from a chick. He is usually kept in a wicker basket when not out.

===Characters from Yuri’s time===
Yuri&#x27;s family 
:In modern-day Japan, Yuri has a mother, father, and two sisters, (younger) and (older). Very little is shown of them beyond the initial pages of the manga, but it is assumed they are a normal Japanese family. In volume 28 it is revealed that several of Yuri&#x27;s daughters and granddaughters were named after her sisters.

Satoshi Himuro 
: is a classmate and long-time friend of Yuri. Towards the beginning of the story, Satoshi and Yuri had just officially become a couple: the story opens with their first kiss. While they were out on a date, Yuri was grabbed by the queen by way of a snow puddle. Yuri misses Satoshi for the first few months in Anatolia, but his memory fades gradually with time.

:In a short comic included in the fan-book, it is revealed Himuro has become a professor of Hittite history, and is married to Yuri&#x27;s younger sister, Eimi. While excavating the tomb of Ishtar at Hattusa, his grad students uncover tablets recording the exploits of Mursili II and his Tawananna Ishtar, written by Illvani&#x27;s son. This short comic unofficially closes the storyline.

===Others===
Talos 
:The headman of the Hatti people, keeper of the secret of iron making, and father to Hadi, Ryui, Shala, and Tito. He is one of the first to see the true potential in Yuri (&quot;proving&quot; her claim as Ishtar by asking her to pick a blade from his armory), and quietly supports her from behind the scenes throughout the course of the series.

Nadia 
:The head concubine of Prince Mattiwaza, and younger sister of Queen Nakia. She initially plans to trick Mattiwaza into killing Yuri, but only because she was afraid of being replaced. Though long suspected of being a spy for Queen Nakia or her birth kingdom of Babylonia, she has no intention of being a pawn of Nakia or Urhi, as she is genuinely in love with Mattiwaza, and even defends him with her life (which ultimately saves Mattiwaza and Yuri themselves as well). Her selfless act redeems Mattiwaza, and they flee to Babylonia to seek out for a new life together. Following Mattiwaza&#x27;s reinstatement as Mittani&#x27;s king by Kail, she has likely since become his queen.

Guzel 
:The daughter of the chairman of the Hittite senate, who claims her son is Prince Kail&#x27;s while under the control of Queen Nakia. A gentle and understanding person, and previously one of the leading candidates to become Kail&#x27;s queen, she still a close friend to Kail and has also come to appreciate Yuri as the only one Kail would ever take for his wife. Her son, whose father was really a traveling minstrel, was named after Kail.

Alexandra 
:The first princess of Arzawa (a country to the west of the Hittites on the shores of the Aegean Sea), Alexandra is sent by her mother to surrender herself to Ishtar as a concubine, not realizing that Ishtar is female. After Arzawa becomes an ally of the Hittites, Alexandra, who has come to adore Yuri, spends a great deal of time in the Hittite kingdom and later becomes the love interest for Prince Juda.
: Alexandra is about 13 years old when she is first seen in book 13 of the series. In a slight difference to the Japanese edition, probably changed to appeal more to an American audience, the manga translation only mentions that Alexandra has been sent to &quot;serve&quot; Ishtar, not that she has been sent as a concubine.

<text>Swartz Bay, located on the north end of the Saanich Peninsula on Vancouver Island, is primarily known for being the location of one of BC Ferries&#x27; main terminals, the Swartz Bay Ferry Terminal. Swartz Bay was named after John Aaron Swart, purchaser in 1876 - i.e. it was meant to be Swart&#x27;s Bay, but was incorrectly spelled when it was adopted by the Government.

<doc id="1225632" wikidata="Q362007" url="?curid=1225632" title="Anchor text">
<text>The anchor text, link label, or link text is the visible, clickable text in an HTML hyperlink. The term &quot;anchor&quot; was used in older versions of the HTML specification for what is currently referred to as the &quot;a element&quot;, or . The HTML specification does not have a specific term for anchor text, but refers to it as &quot;text that the a element wraps around&quot;. In XML terms (since HTML is XML), the anchor text is the content of the element, provided that the content is text.

Usually, web search engines analyze anchor text from hyperlinks on web pages. The words contained in the anchor text can determine the ranking that the page will receive from search engines. Other services apply the basic principles of anchor text analysis as well. For instance, academic search engines may use citation context to classify academic articles, and anchor text from documents linked in mind maps may be used too.

==Overview==
Anchor text usually gives the user relevant descriptive or contextual information about the content of the link&#x27;s destination. The anchor text may or may not be related to the actual text of the URL of the link. For example, a hyperlink to the English-language Wikipedia&#x27;s homepage might take this form:
:codice_1

&quot;Wikipedia&quot; is the anchor text in this example. The URL it points to is codice_2. The entire hyperlink appears on a web page as .

==Search engine algorithms==
Anchor text is weighted (ranked) highly in search engine algorithms, because the linked text is usually relevant to the landing page. The objective of search engines is to provide highly relevant search results; this is where anchor text helps, as the tendency was, more often than not, to hyperlink words relevant to the landing page. Anchor text can also serve the purpose of directing the user to internal pages on the site, which can also help to rank the website higher in the search rankings.

Webmasters may use anchor text to procure high results in search engine results pages. Google&#x27;s Webmaster Tools facilitate this optimization by letting website owners view the most common words in anchor text linking to their site.
In the past, Google bombing was possible through anchor text manipulation; however, in January 2007, Google announced it had updated its algorithm to minimize the impact of Google bombs, which refers to a prank where people attempt to cause someone else&#x27;s site to rank for an obscure or meaningless query.

In April 2012, Google announced in its March &quot;Penguin&quot; update that it would be changing the way it handled anchor text, implying that anchor text would no longer be as important an element for their ranking metrics. Moving forward, Google would be paying more attention to a diversified link profile which has a mix of anchor text and other types of links.

However a 2016 study of anchor text influence across 16,000 keywords found that presence of exact and partial match anchor links continues to have a strong correlation with Google rankings.

August 2016 study conducted by Moz, found that Exact and partial match domains can be affected by over optimization penalty since Google considers domain Brand and naked URL links as Exact match.

===Terminology===
There are different classifications of anchor text that are used within the search engine optimization community such as the following:

;Exact match: An anchor that is used with a keyword that mirrors the page that is being linked to. Example: &quot;search engine optimization&quot; is an exact match anchor because it&#x27;s linking to a page about &quot;search engine optimization&quot;.
;Partial match: An anchor that is used with a keyword and a variation that mirrors the page that is being linked to. Example: &quot;different search engine optimization techniques&quot; is a partial match, anchor text as it links to a broader concept (i.e. to the article about search engine optimization).
;Branded: A brand that is used as the anchor. &quot;Wikipedia&quot; is a branded anchor text.
;Naked link: A URL that is used as an anchor. &quot;www.wikipedia.com&quot; is a naked link anchor.
;Generic: A generic word or phrase that is used as the anchor. &quot;Click here&quot; is a generic anchor recommended against on grounds of usability and accessibility. Other variations may include &quot;go here&quot;, &quot;visit this website&quot;, etc..
;Images: Whenever an image is linked, Google will use the &quot;alt&quot; attribute as the anchor text.
;Empty: Whenever an image is linked, and the &quot;alt&quot; attribute is empty.
;Latent semantic indexing: Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a method used by Google to determine similar keywords.

<text>Amazing-Man is the name used by four fictional characters published by DC Comics. The first three are African-American superheroes and are members of the same family. The first Amazing-Man debuted in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #23 (July 1983), and was created by Roy Thomas and Jerry Ordway. The second Amazing-Man debuted in &quot;Justice League America&quot; #86 (March 1994), and was created by Dan Vado and Marc Campos. The third Amazing-Man debuted in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; vol. 3 #12 (March 2008), and was created by Geoff Johns and Dale Eaglesham. The fourth Amazing Man debuted in &quot;OMAC&quot; vol. 3 #2 (December 2011), and was created by Dan DiDio and Keith Giffen.

==Publication history==
Although a 1980s creation of writer Roy Thomas, the Amazing-Man published by DC Comics was placed in the 1940s and made a contemporary of various Golden Age superheroes. The character was created by Roy Thomas as a tribute to Bill Everett&#x27;s Amazing-Man, a character he created for Centaur Publications during the so-called Golden Age of Comic Books.

==Fictional character biography==
===Will Everett===
Will Everett is a promising young African-American Olympian who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Following this, he becomes a janitor at a laboratory owned by Terry Curtis. After an accident where his equipment explodes, Everett develops the ability to mimic whatever properties he touched.

The Ultra-Humanite initially employs Everett as a henchman along with Curtis (as Cyclotron) and Deathbolt. He later reforms and joins the All-Star Squadron.

During &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Amazing-Man is among the heroes chosen by the Monitor to stop the Anti-Monitor. He loses his original abilities and gains the ability to manipulate magnetism.

In the 1950s, J. Edgar Hoover reveals Everett&#x27;s secret identity to the public, which endangers his family. He becomes involved in the Civil Rights Movement after his nephew is murdered before dying from cancer.

===Will Everett III===

Will Everett III is Will Everett&#x27;s grandson and his successor. As a member of the Justice League, he is instrumental in defeating the Overmaster alongside the other members of the League and reformed members of the Cadre. Soon after this, Will joins a splinter group of the JLA nicknamed Extreme Justice.

Later, Will joins the Crimson Fox&#x27;s unofficial re-grouping of Justice League Europe, during which he is killed by Mist.

===Markus Clay===
The third Amazing-Man is Markus Clay, Will Everett III&#x27;s cousin and a member of the Justice Society of America.

===Rocker Bonn===
A fourth incarnation of Amazing-Man, Rocker Bonn, is introduced following &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot. He is a former Checkmate agent who was given metahuman abilities by Project Cadmus.

==Powers and abilities==
All versions of Amazing-Man can mimic other materials via touch. The Will Everett Sr. incarnation later developed the ability to manipulate magnetism.

== In other media ==
The Will Everett incarnation of Amazing-Man appears in &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, voiced by Ike Amadi.

<text>Manurewa is a suburb in South Auckland, New Zealand, located south of Manukau Central, and southeast of the Auckland City Centre. It is home to the Auckland Botanic Gardens, which receives over a million visitors a year. Manurewa has a high proportion of non-European ethnicities, making it one of the most multi-cultural suburbs in New Zealand. Employment for many is at the many companies of nearby Wiri, Papakura, and at the steel mill at Glenbrook.

The area has been inhabited since at least the 13th century, and has cultural significance for Ngāti Te Ata Waiohua. Manurewa developed as a rural community after the Manurewa railway station opened in 1875, becoming a borough in 1937. The area saw suburban growth in the 1950s and 1960s, and became a shopping hub when Southmall Manurewa opened in 1967.

== Etymology ==

The name Manurewa is a variant of the Māori word for &quot;kite&quot;, &quot;manu aute&quot;, used by in local Waiohua dialect. The translation &quot;soaring bird&quot; gained popularity in the 1920s among English speakers. The name is a shortened form of Te Manurewa o Tamapahore (&quot;The Drifted-away Kite of Tamapahore&quot;), a name which recalls a story involving Waiohua ancestor Tamapahore. One day the men who lived at Matukutūruru and Matukutūreia decided to fly kites, and Tamapahore&#x27;s was the kite that flew the highest. His brother Tamapahure caused the chord of Tamapahore&#x27;s kite to break. Tamapahore left the area in search of his valuable kite, eventually finding it at Whenuakite on the Coromandel Peninsula.

==Geography==
Manurewa is located in South Auckland, inland from the south-eastern Manukau Harbour, north of the Pahurehure Inlet. Manurewa is south of the Puhinui Creek, and north of the Papakura Stream. Manurewa is at the southern border of the Auckland volcanic field. Two volcanoes are located to the north in Wiri: Matukutūreia (also known as McLaughlins Mountain), which erupted an estimated 48,000 years ago, and Matukutūruru (Wiri Mountain), which erupted an estimated 30,000 years ago. Matukutūruru was quarried, primarily by the New Zealand Railways Corporation.

==History==
===Māori history===
Manurewa has been inhabited since at least the 13th century. Matukutūreia and Matukutūruru were home to two hilltop pā, collectively known as Matukurua. The names of the mountains commemorate a story of two chiefs. The chief of Matukutūruru (&quot;the bittern standing at ease&quot;) was captured while eel fishing. The chief of Matukutūreia (&quot;the vigilant bittern&quot;) saved the pā and the people of Matukutūruru. Over 8,000 hectares of stonefield gardens were tended by Tāmaki Māori peoples on the lower slopes of the volcanoes, where crops such as kūmara and bracken fern root were grown.

The Manurewa area was settled by Ngā Riki, who were one of the three Tāmaki Māori groups who joined together to form the Waiohua in the 17th and 18th-centuries. During this time, the two pā were home to the Ngāi Huatau hapū of Waiohua, settled by Huatau, daughter of Huakaiwaka. The chief Huarangi was based at Matukutūruru with his wife Takawai of Ngāi Tahuhu. After her death, he married Kohe, a high ranking woman from Ngāti Pāoa, a union that was widely disapproved by the hapū. This dissent eventually led to a division in the family, with the children of Takawai settling at Matukutūruru, and Huarangi moving with Kohe to Matukutūreia.

Around the year 1740, a conflict between Ngāti Whātua and Waiohua led to the death of paramount chief Kiwi Tāmaki, who became the main occupants of the Tāmaki isthmus and Māngere to the north. Ngāti Whātua was significantly smaller than the Waiohua confederation and chose to focus life at Onehunga, Māngere and Ōrākei, meaning that Waiohua were able to re-establish a presence in South Auckland.

The Manurewa area has significance for Waiohua iwi, especially Ngāti Te Ata Waiohua, who descent from Te Ata i Rehia, the daughter of Huatau who was born on Matukutūreia, and Te Ākitai Waiohua.

===Colonial era===

In January 1836 missionary William Thomas Fairburn brokered a land sale between Tāmaki Māori chiefs, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero and Turia of Ngāti Te Rau, covering the majority of modern-day South Auckland between Ōtāhuhu and Papakura. The sale was envisioned as a way to end hostilities in the area, but it is unclear what the chiefs understood or consented to. Māori continued to live in South Auckland, unchanged by this sale. Fairburn was criticised for the sheer size of the purchase, and in 1842 the Crown significantly reduced the size of his land holdings, and the Crown partitioned much of the land for European settlers. 10,000 acres of the Fairburn purchase was given to James Reddy Clendon in return for land at Russell where the new capital of New Zealand was established. Clendon never lived or visited the area, but sold 2,000 acres to the Martin brothers, who subdivided the land in the mid-1900s. Much of the Martin brothers&#x27; land became modern-day Manurewa.

Work on the Great South Road began in 1843, reaching as far south as Drury in 1855. In the early 1860s, Great South Road was used as a military supply route between Auckland and the frontier of the Invasion of the Waikato. Manurewa was only sparsely populated in the 1860s and 1870s. The main stop on the Great South Road for coach services was the Raglan Hotel at Woodside (modern-day Wiri). The Manurewa Highway District was formed in 1867, and in 1875 the first Manurewa railway station opened. The station led to growth in the area; 81 people lived in Manurewa by 1879, and a post office opened in 1884. By the 1900s, much of Woodside village had moved to Manurewa, including the school that moved by 1906, and joined by the Methodist Church in 1909. Manurewa became a centre for the dairy industry in the early 20th century, with the first creamery opening in 1905.

===Suburban development===
By 1915, Manurewa had grown large enough to become a town district, created from parts of the former Manurewa and Papakura road districts. The area was promoted as a commuter suburb for Auckland in the early 1920s. Local farmer Charles Henry Lupton was instrumental in developing the Manurewa community, serving on the town board, school and church committees, and became known as &quot;The Father of Manurewa&quot;. By 1937, the population of Manurewa had increased to over 1,500 people, allowing Manurewa to become a borough. In 1939, a fire destroyed the Manurewa Picture Theatre, and the adjoining shops and boarding house. During World War II, parts of Manurewa were used as military camps for United States Army soldiers bound for the Pacific.

Manurewa experienced rapid growth in the 1950s and early 1960s after the development of the Auckland Southern Motorway, developing from a semi-rural locality into a suburb of Auckland. Southmall Manurewa, the third American-style mall in Auckland, was opened in 1967. The mall was initially very successful, but struggled from October 1976 onwards after the opening of the Manukau Shopping Centre.

By the 1970s, Manurewa East and Weymouth had developed as suburban areas, and after the construction of Manukau Central in the 1980s, Manurewa became connected to the urban sprawl of Auckland. In 1982, the Auckland Botanic Gardens opened in Manurewa.

By the 2010s, Manurewa had developed a significant Pasifika population, and had the highest proportion of Māori residents in the city.

<text>A dry-sump system is a method to manage the lubricating motor oil in four-stroke and large two-stroke piston driven internal combustion engines. The dry-sump system uses two or more oil pumps and a separate oil reservoir, as opposed to a conventional wet-sump system, which uses only the main sump (U.S.: oil pan) below the engine and a single pump. A dry-sump engine requires a pressure relief valve to regulate negative pressure inside the engine, so internal seals are not inverted.

Dry-sumps are common on larger diesel engines such as those used in ships, as well as gasoline engines used in racing cars, aerobatic aircraft, high-performance personal watercraft and motorcycles. Dry sump lubrication may be chosen for these applications due to increased reliability, oil capacity, reduction of oil starvation under high g-loads and/or other technical or performance reasons. Dry sump systems may not be suitable for all applications due to increased cost, complexity, and/or bulk, among other factors.

== Design ==
Engines are both lubricated and cooled by oil that circulates throughout the engine, feeding various bearings and other moving parts and then draining, via gravity, into the sump at the base of the engine. In the wet-sump system of nearly all production automobile engines, the oil that&#x27;s not actively circulating is stored in the sump, which is large enough for this purpose. A pump collects oil from the sump and directly circulates it back through the engine. In a dry-sump system, the oil still falls to the base of the engine, but into a much shallower sump, where one or more scavenge pumps draw it away and transfer it to a (usually external) reservoir, where it is both cooled and de-aerated before being recirculated through the engine by a pressure pump. The sump in a dry-sump system is not actually dry; it is still wet from oil draining from the engine. The reservoir is usually tall and narrow and specially designed with internal baffles, and an oil outlet (supply) at the very bottom for uninhibited oil supply even during sloshing.

The dry pump operation consists of a pressure stage and a scavenging stage. Although the term &quot;stages&quot; is commonly used to describe the work of the multiple pumps, they typically run in parallel rather than in series as might be implied by the term. The pressure stage draws oil from the bottom of the reservoir and passes it through the filter and into the engine itself. An adjustable pressure regulator ensures that the oil pressure is kept stable at different engine speeds. The dry-sump system requires at least two pumps - one pressure and one scavenge - and sometimes as many as four or five scavenge pumps are used to minimize the amount of oil in the engine. The pressure pump and scavenge pumps are frequently mounted on a common crankshaft, so that a single pulley at the front of the system can run as many pumps as the engine design requires. It is common practice to have one scavenge pump per crankcase section; however, in the case of inverted engines (typically aircraft engines) it is necessary to employ separate scavenge pumps for each cylinder bank. Therefore, an inverted V engine would have a minimum of two scavenge pumps and a pressure pump in the pump &quot;stack&quot;.

Dry sump systems may optionally be designed to keep the engine&#x27;s crankcase at lower than atmospheric pressure (vacuum), by sealing the crankcase and allowing the scavenge pumps to draw out both oil and gases. An equilibrium pressure will be reached when the rate of gases entering the crankcase (blow-by gases past the piston rings, but also air leaks and oil vapor) equals the rate of gas removal from the scavenge pump capacity beyond what&#x27;s required to remove just the oil. Alternatively, the crankcase may be kept near atmospheric pressure by venting it to the oil reservoir, which in turn is vented into the engine&#x27;s air intake, or to outside air.

==Advantages==
A dry-sump system offers many advantages over a wet-sump. The primary advantages include: 
* Prevention of the engine experiencing oil starvation during high g-loads when oil sloshes, which improves engine reliability. Most engines can be damaged by even brief periods of oil starvation. This is the reason why dry-sumps were invented, and is particularly valuable in racing cars, high performance sports cars, and aerobatic aircraft that regularly experience high accelerations. Oil slosh occurs in dry-sump systems too, but it is much easier to design a remote reservoir to tolerate high amounts of slosh, by being tall and narrow, and having large baffles.
* Increased oil capacity by using a large external reservoir, which would be impractical in a wet-sump system. 
* Improvements to vehicle handling and stability. The vehicle&#x27;s center of gravity can be lowered by mounting the (typically very heavy) engine lower in the chassis due to a shallow sump profile. A vehicle&#x27;s overall weight distribution can be modified by locating the external oil reservoir away from the engine. 
* Improved oil temperature control. This is due to increased oil volume providing resistance to heat saturation, the positioning of the oil reservoir away from the hot engine, and the ability to include cooling capabilities between the scavenger pumps and oil reservoir and also within the reservoir itself. 
* Improved oil quality. When oil sloshes against the crankshaft and other high-speed spinning parts, it causes a &quot;hurricane that whips the oil in a wet-sump engine into an aerated froth like a milkshake in a blender&quot;. Aerated oil protects engine components far less effectively. A dry-sump system minimizes oil aeration, and also de-aerates oil far more effectively by pumping it first into a remote reservoir.
* Increased engine power. In a wet-sump engine, oil slosh against spinning parts causes substantial viscous drag which creates parasitic power loss. A dry-sump system removes oil from the crankcase, along with the possibility of such viscous drag. More complex dry-sump systems may scavenge oil from other areas where oil may pool, such as in the valvetrain. Power can be further increased if the dry-sump system is designed to create a vacuum inside the crankcase, which reduces air drag (or &#x27;windage&#x27;) on moving parts as well.
* Improved pump efficiency to maintain oil supply to the engine. Since scavenge pumps are typically mounted at the lowest point on the engine, the oil flows into the pump intake by gravity rather than having to be lifted up into the intake of the pump as in a wet-sump. Furthermore, scavenge pumps can be of a design that is more tolerant of entrapped gasses than the typical pressure pump, which can lose suction if too much air mixes into the oil. Since the pressure pump is typically lower than the external oil tank, it always has a positive pressure on its suction regardless of cornering forces.
* Having the pumps external to the engine makes them easier to maintain or replace.

==Disadvantages==
Dry-sump engines have several disadvantages compared to wet-sump engines, including;
* Dry-sump systems add cost, complexity, and weight.
* The extra pumps and lines in dry-sump engines require additional oil and maintenance.
* The large external reservoir and pumps can be tricky to position around the engine and within the engine bay due to their size.
* As wrist pins and pistons rely on the oil being splashed around in the crankcase for lubrication and cooling respectively, these parts might have inadequate oiling if too much oil is pulled away by the pump. Installing piston oilers can circumvent this issue, but adds cost and complexity to the engine.
* Inadequate upper valvetrain lubrication can also become an issue if too much oil vapor is being pulled out from the area, especially with multi-staged pumps.

== Common engine applications ==
Dry-sumps are common on larger diesel engines such as those used for ship propulsion, largely due to increased reliability and serviceability. They are also commonly used in racing cars and aerobatic aircraft, due to problems with g-forces, reliable oil supply, power output and vehicle handling. The Chevrolet Corvette Z06 has a dry sump engine which requires an initial oil change after 500 miles.

=== Motorcycle engines ===
The dry-sump lubrication is particularly applicable to motorcycles, which tend to be operated more vigorously than other road vehicles. Although motorcycles such as the Honda CB750 (1969) feature a dry-sump engine, modern motorcycles tend to use a wet-sump design. This is understandable with across-the-frame inline four-cylinder engines, since these wide engines must be mounted fairly high in the frame (for ground clearance), so the space below may as well be used for a wet-sump. However, narrower engines can be mounted lower and ideally should use dry-sump lubrication.

Several motorcycle models that use dry-sumps include;
* The classic British parallel twin motorcycles, such as BSA, Triumph and Norton, all used dry-sump lubrication. Traditionally, the oil tank was a remote item, but some late-model BSAs, and the Meriden Triumphs, used &quot;oil-in-the-frame&quot; designs. 
* The Triumph Rocket 3, an inline three-cylinder, water-cooled, DOHC engine.
* The Yamaha TRX850 270-degree parallel twin motorcycle has a dry-sump engine. Its oil reservoir is not remote, but integral to the engine, sitting atop the gearbox. This design eliminates external oil lines, allowing simpler engine removal and providing faster oil warm up.
* The Yamaha XT660Z (and R/X models) use a dry-sump design where the bike&#x27;s frame tubing is used as the oil reservoir and cooling system
* The Yamaha SR400/500 uses a dry-sump design where the bike&#x27;s frame tubing doubles as the oil reservoir and cooling system.
* Harley-Davidson has used dry-sump type lubricating oil systems in their engines since the 1930s.
* The Rotax engined Aprilia RSV Mille, and the Aprilia RST1000 Futura both incorporate a dry-sump, along with sister bikes, the SL1000 Falco and ETV1000 Caponord.
* All BMW K-series motorcycles with inline-4 engines.
* The Honda NX650, XR500R, XR600R, XR650R and XR650L four-stroke dirt bikes utilize a dry-sump with the oil in the frame tubing.
* The Suzuki DR-Z400 has a 2L dry-sump with oil in the frame tubing.
* Chennai built Royal Enfield prior to 2007. Royal Enfield dry sump designs were completely phased out by 2012.

<doc id="1225671" wikidata="Q2058886" url="?curid=1225671" title="Tuxedo Gin">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tokihiko Matsuura. It was published in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from 1997 to 2000, with its chapters collected in 15 volumes. In North America, it was licensed for English released by Viz Media. The series is about a teenaged boxer named Ginji Kusanagi who is reincarnated as a penguin in order to be close to the girl he likes. On August 4, 2011, Walt Disney Pictures and Viz Pictures announced they were adapting the &quot;Tuxedo Gin&quot; manga into a feature film under the name, &quot;Tux&quot;.

==Plot==
At the start of the series, , a high school student on the verge of making his professional debut as a boxer, is killed in a suspicious motorcycle accident on his way to his first date with , the girl of his dreams. An angel (who is depicted as a Buddhist monk with cherub wings and halo) tells Ginji that because of a celestial mistake, he can be reunited with Minako, but only if he lives out the natural lifespan of another animal, after which he will return to his human body. Remembering Minako&#x27;s love for penguins, Ginji decides to be reincarnated as an Adelie penguin, and he hatches from an egg in a Tokyo aquarium.

When Ginji reaches adolescence, he escapes from the aquarium with his penguin friends, only to discover he cannot swim. He washes up in the harbor, where he is discovered by Minako. She takes him home and names him Gin-chan (at first thinking this to be an affectionate contraction of his own name, Ginji is crestfallen when Minako reveals that she has selected this name because, in her words, &quot;You&#x27;re such a cute little &quot;.

The series depicts Ginji&#x27;s life with Minako, where he does his best to protect Minako from any man who tries to go out with her or simply &quot;harm&quot; her. Along the way, Mike and the other penguins from the aquarium help him once in a while and he meets fellow reincarnated humans.

In the final arc, Minako is kidnapped by a murderous criminal named Kurosaki and Ginji goes and rescues her, but at the cost of losing his ability to fully reincarnate. Minako loses her memory and believes that Gin-chan headed back to the North Pole to be with his kind. The angel, becoming sympathetic to Ginji&#x27;s ordeal, makes a plea to God to give up his form so that Ginji can be brought back to life. Ginji reunites with a relieved Minako and they become a couple while adopting a penguin named Popo whom Ginji had befriended earlier.

==Publication==
Written and illustrated by Tokihiko Matsuura, &quot;Tuxedo Gin&quot; was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from March 26, 1997, to January 29, 2000. Shogakukan collected its chapters in 15 volumes, released from September 18, 1997, to April 18, 2000.

It was published in North America by Viz Media.

===Volumes===






==Reception==

&quot;Tuxedo Gin&quot; has been reviewed as having the sort of wacky premise and serious plotlines that make a good romantic comedy, unfortunately being weakened by mediocre characters. Tokihiko Matsuura&#x27;s art has been praised for clean lines and clear layouts but criticized for its generic character designs.

<doc id="1225675" wikidata="Q1519885" url="?curid=1225675" title="Marinejegerkommandoen">
<text>Marinejegerkommandoen (MJK) () is the maritime/naval special warfare unit of the Norwegian Armed Forces and was established in 1953.

The MJK is under the command of the Norwegian Special Operations Command (NORSOCOM) together with the &quot;Forsvarets Spesialkommando&quot; (FSK), with the MJK being the older of the two units. The unit is headquartered on the Ramsund naval base in northern Norway, with other MJK operators stationed on the Haakonsvern naval base in southwestern Norway.

== Selection ==
As with any modern special operations forces, the training to become an MJK operator is long and arduous, both physically and mentally taxing. To become a fully qualified MJK operator takes a minimum of two years and is further augmented by specialized courses during the following contract period, such as combat medic training, sniper training and forward air control (FAC) training.

In 2008 a news-team from NRK filmed their selection process, showing recruits being strip searched and doing water exercises in a secret abandoned naval base somewhere along the Norwegian coast.

== History ==
In the autumn of 1940, two Norwegian military units were set up in the United Kingdom. Their mission was to carry out special operations against Nazi forces in occupied Norway. The two units were &quot;Shetlandsgjengen&quot; (Shetland Bus), who used fishing vessels to transport people and materials to and from Norway, and &quot;Kompani Linge&quot; (Norwegian Independent Company 1), initially under the command of Lieutenant Martin Linge. Both units were under the command of the British Special Operations Executive.

In 1953, the Royal Norwegian Navy formed a frogman-unit. This unit was under the command of Ove Lund, and is the origin of the modern &quot;Marinejegerkommandoen&quot; and &quot;Minedykkerkommandoen&quot;. The mission of the frogmen was to conduct recon and sabotage against enemy targets above and below water. The frogmen were also tasked with disarming all water-borne explosive devices.

The missions gradually become more comprehensive and different frogman specialities emerged. This led to members of the unit being divided into a clearance diver team and two combat swimmer teams, in 1968. Of the combat swimmer groups, one was based at Ramsund Naval Station in northern Norway, and one was based at Karljohansvern Naval Station in southern Norway.

The two combat swimmer teams were eventually fused into one and based in Ramsund. They later changed names to the current &quot;Marinejegerkommandoen&quot;. Today the unit has its main base in Bergen, with training facilities in Ramsund.

== Role ==
&quot;Marinejegerkommandoen&quot; plays an integral part in modern warfare operations. The unit carries out missions that require thorough planning, quick reaction, high precision, covert implementation, daring, courage and the ability to work independently. As with all SOF missions, they target objectives of high or critical strategic value.

=== Domestic security ===
&quot;Marinejegerkommandoen&quot; is on national counter-terrorism standby to assist the Norwegian Police if required (alongside &quot;Forsvarets Spesialkommando&quot;), and is also on continuous standby for international operations.

=== International operations ===

The &quot;Marinejegerkommandoen&quot; have participated in a number of international operations. The unit conducted operations in Afghanistan in 2002 (Task Force K-Bar), in 2003 and in 2005–2006, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The unit was also involved in the training of the Afghan National Police Crisis Response Unit around Kabul in 2008–2009, relieving &quot;Forsvarets Spesialkommando&quot; for a short period.

The unit provided operators for Military Observer Teams (MOT&#x27;s), as part of the Norwegian Armed Forces contribution in Faryab Province in northern Afghanistan. It was during a MOT patrol on 27 June 2010 that Lieutenant Commander Trond Andrè Bolle was killed, along with three members of the Norwegian Coastal Ranger Command, when the Iveco LMV they were travelling in was struck by an IED.
Lt Cmdr Bolle was later awarded the Norwegian War Cross with Sword for his actions commanding the Norwegian Special Operations Force Task Group II in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan&#x27;s Helmand province from October 2005 to February 2006.

MJK&#x27;s contribution in Afghanistan has largely been kept secret, but from what little information is available, its missions have included DA (direct action), Forward Air Control (FAC) and SR (Special Surveillance and Reconnaissance), and cooperating with other coalition forces in the fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.

Following Afghanistan, MJK has deployed twice aboard Royal Norwegian Navy frigate HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen (F310) off the coast of Somalia, conducting anti-piracy operations as part of Operation Atalanta (2009) and Operation Ocean Shield (2013).

In January 2013, medical specialists from MJK, amongst other units, were sent on a Norwegian Air Force Super Hercules to Sicily in connection with the In Amenas hostage crisis in Algeria.

=== Recognition ===
&quot;Marinejegerkommandoen&#x27;s&quot; participation in Operation Enduring Freedom earned the unit the Navy Presidential Unit Citation on 8 February 2005. The Presidential Unit Citation is the highest unit award given by the United States to allied units and was awarded to all members of Task Force K-Bar. William H. McRaven, a United States Navy Admiral who previously served as the commander of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), said in an interview with a Norwegian newspaper in 2007 that he regarded the Special Operations Forces of Norway to be among the top special operations forces in the world.

A member of the MJK was in August 2020 awarded the Bronze Star Medal of the United States for extraordinary allied efforts during a mission in Afghanistan.

==Structure==

<doc id="1225696" wikidata="Q13407871" url="?curid=1225696" title="Variable-pitch propeller (marine)">
<text>In marine propulsion, a variable-pitch propeller is a type of propeller with blades that can be rotated around their long axis to change the blade pitch. Reversible propellers—those where the pitch can be set to negative values—can also create reverse thrust for braking or going backwards without the need to change the direction of shaft revolution.

A controllable pitch propeller (CPP) can be efficient for the full range of rotational speeds and load conditions, since its pitch will be varied to absorb the maximum power that the engine is capable of producing. When fully loaded, a vessel will need more propulsion power than when empty. By varying the propeller blades to the optimal pitch, higher efficiency can be obtained, thus saving fuel. A vessel with a VPP can accelerate faster from a standstill and can decelerate much more effectively, making stopping quicker and safer. A CPP can also improve vessel maneuverability by directing a stronger flow of water onto the rudder.

However, a fixed pitch propeller (FPP) is both cheaper and more robust than a CPP. Also, an FPP is typically more efficient than a CPP for a single specific rotational speed and load condition. Accordingly, vessels that normally operate at a standard speed (such as large bulk carriers, tankers and container ships) will have an FPP optimized for that speed. At the other extreme, a canal narrowboat will have a FPP for two reasons: speed is limited to 4 mph (to protect the canal bank), and the propeller needs to be robust (when encountering underwater obstacles).

Vessels with medium or high speed diesel or gasoline engines use a reduction gear to reduce the engine output speed to an optimal propeller speed—although the large low speed diesels, whose cruising RPM is in the 80 to 120 range, are usually direct drive with direct-reversing engines. While an FPP-equipped vessel needs either a reversing gear or a reversible engine to reverse, a CPP vessel may not. On a large ship the CPP requires a hydraulic system to control the position of the blades. Compared to an FPP, a CPP is more efficient in reverse as the blades&#x27; leading edges remain as such in reverse also, so that the hydrodynamic cross-sectional shape is optimal for forward propulsion and satisfactory for reverse operations.

In the mid-1970s, Uljanik Shipyard in Yugoslavia produced four VLCCs with CPPs – a tanker and three ore/oil carriers – each powered by two 20,000 bhp B &amp; W diesel engines directly driving Kamewa variable-pitch propellers. Due to the high construction cost none of these vessels ever returned a profit over their lifetimes. For these vessels, fixed variable-pitch propellers would have been more appropriate.

Controllable-pitch propellers are usually found on harbour or ocean-going tugs, dredgers, cruise ships, ferries, cargo vessels and larger fishing vessels. Prior to the development of CPPs, some vessels would alternate between &quot;speed wheel&quot; and &quot;power wheel&quot; propellers depending on the task. Current VPP designs can tolerate a maximum output of 44000 kW (60,000 hp).

== Sail boats ==
A sailboat or motorsailer when voyaging on sail alone will benefit from reduced drag, and just like an aeronautical propeller, a marine VPP may be &quot;feathered&quot; to give the least water resistance when sailing without using power. A VPP is particularly useful when motorsailing (i.e. voyaging under both power and sail), as the VPP can be coarsened to incorporate the wind component. If the prop remained at the &quot;normal&quot; setting, it would be too fine and the engine would provide little useful contribution; but by coarsening the prop, the engine provides useful thrust, resulting in a higher speed yet reduced fuel consumption because of the sailing component resistance.
