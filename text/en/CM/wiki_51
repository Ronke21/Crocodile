<text>The ruffed lemurs of the genus Varecia are strepsirrhine primates and are the largest extant lemurs within the family Lemuridae. Like all living lemurs, they are found only on the island of Madagascar. Formerly considered to be a monotypic genus, two species are now recognized: the black-and-white ruffed lemur, with its three subspecies, and the red ruffed lemur.

Ruffed lemurs are diurnal and arboreal quadrupeds, often observed leaping through the upper canopy of the seasonal tropical rainforests in eastern Madagascar. They are also the most frugivorous of the Malagasy lemurs, and they are very sensitive to habitat disturbance. Ruffed lemurs live in multi-male/multi-female groups and have a complex and flexible social structure, described as fission-fusion. They are highly vocal and have loud, raucous calls.

Ruffed lemurs are seasonal breeders and highly unusual in their reproductive strategy. They are considered an &quot;evolutionary enigma&quot; in that they are the largest of the extant species in Lemuridae, yet exhibit reproductive traits more common in small, nocturnal lemurs, such as short gestation periods (~102 days) and relatively large average litter sizes (~2–3). Ruffed lemurs also build nests for their newborns (the only primates that do so), carry them by mouth, and exhibit an absentee parental system by stashing them while they forage. Infants are altricial, although they develop relatively quickly, traveling independently in the wild after 70 days and attaining full adult size by six months.

Threatened by habitat loss and hunting, ruffed lemurs are facing extinction in the wild. However, they reproduce readily in captivity and have been gradually re-introduced into the wild since 1997. Organizations that are involved in ruffed lemur conservation include the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), the Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG), Monkeyland Primate Sanctuary in South Africa, Wildlife Trust, and the Duke Lemur Center (DLC).

==Evolutionary history==
Lemurs are not known in the fossil record on Madagascar until the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Consequently, little is known about the evolution of ruffed lemurs, let alone the entire lemur clade, which comprises the endemic primate population of the island.

Although there is still much debate about the origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is generally accepted that a single rafting event, similar to the one that brought New World monkeys to South America, occurred around 50–80 million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160 million years ago. The resulting founder effect and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.

===Taxonomic classification===

The ruffed lemur genus, &quot;Varecia&quot;, is a member of the family Lemuridae. The extinct genus, &quot;Pachylemur&quot; most closely resembled the ruffed lemurs but died out after the arrival of humans. The genus &quot;Varecia&quot; contains two species, red ruffed lemurs and black-and-white ruffed lemurs, the latter having three subspecies.

* Family Lemuridae
** Genus &quot;Eulemur&quot;: true lemurs
** Genus &quot;Hapalemur&quot;: lesser bamboo lemurs
** Genus &quot;Lemur&quot;: the ring-tailed lemur
** Genus †&quot;Pachylemur&quot;
** Genus &quot;Varecia&quot;: ruffed lemurs
*** Black-and-white ruffed lemur, &quot;Varecia variegata&quot;
**** Variegated black-and-white ruffed lemur, &quot;Varecia variegata variegata&quot;
**** Southern black-and-white ruffed lemur, &quot;Varecia variegata editorum&quot;
**** Northern black-and-white ruffed lemur, &quot;Varecia variegata subcincta&quot;
*** Red ruffed lemur, &quot;Varecia rubra&quot;

===Changes in taxonomy===
Ruffed lemurs, along with several species of brown lemur were once included in the genus &quot;Lemur&quot;. In 1962, the ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the genus &quot;Varecia&quot; earlier coined after the Malagasy word &quot;variky&quot; first attested in Frederick de Houtman&#x27;s 1605 Dutch-Malagasy dictionary. 

The red ruffed lemur and the black-and-white ruffed lemur were formerly recognized as subspecies, &quot;Varecia variegata rubra&quot; and &quot;Varecia variegata variegata&quot; respectively. In 2001 both were elevated to species status, a decision that was later supported by genetic research. Three subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, which had been published decades earlier, were also recognized as &quot;variegata&quot;, &quot;editorum&quot;, and &quot;subcincta&quot;, although studies have not been entirely conclusive.

Subfossil remains of two extinct lemur species were previously classified under the genus &quot;Varecia&quot;. Found at sites in central and southwestern Madagascar, &quot;Varecia insignis&quot; and &quot;V. jullyi&quot; were very similar to modern ruffed lemurs, but more robust and assumed to be more terrestrial, and thus more prone to predation by early human settlers. More recent studies have shown that these extinct species had a diet similar to that of modern ruffed lemurs and that they were also arboreal in nature. Enough differences were demonstrated to merit a separate genus, &quot;Pachylemur&quot;. These close relatives of ruffed lemurs are now named &quot;Pachylemur insignis&quot; and &quot;P. jullyi&quot;.

==Anatomy and physiology==

Ruffed lemurs are the largest extant members of the family Lemuridae, with an average head-body length between and a total length from , while ranging in weight from . The thick, furry tail is longer than the body, averaging in length and is used primarily for balance while moving through the trees. Ruffed lemurs exhibit neither sexual dimorphism nor sexual dichromatism, and females have three pairs of mammary glands.
Ruffed lemurs are characterized by their long, canine-like muzzle, which includes a significant overbite. The face is mostly black, with furry &quot;ruffs&quot; running from the ears to the neck. Depending on the species, these ruffs are either white (&quot;V. variegata&quot;) or deep reddish (&quot;V. rubra&quot;). Likewise, the coloration of the fluffy fur also varies by species, while the coloration pattern varies by subspecies in the black-and-white ruffed lemur. There are also intermediates in color variation between the two species.

As with all lemurs, the ruffed lemur has special adaptations for grooming, including a toilet-claw on its second toe, and a toothcomb.

===Locomotion===
Ruffed lemurs are considered arboreal quadrupeds, with the most common type of movement being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical clinging, and suspensory behavior, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving from tree to tree, ruffed lemurs will look over the shoulder while clinging, launch themselves into the air, and twist mid-air so that their ventral surface lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior is more common in ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, running with bounding hops and the tail held high.

==Ecology==
Being highly arboreal and the most frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in primary forest with large fruiting trees, where they spend most of their time in the upper canopy. By spending the majority of their time in the crown of tall forest trees, they are relatively safe from predators such as the fossa.

Ruffed lemurs are active primarily during the day (diurnal), during which time they feed primarily on fruits and nectar, often adopting suspensory postures while feeding. The seeds of the fruit they eat pass through their digestive tract and are propagated throughout the rainforests in their feces, helping to ensure new plant growth and a healthy forest ecosystem. These lemurs are also significant pollinators of the traveler&#x27;s tree (&quot;Ravenala madagascariensis&quot;). Without destroying the inflorescence, they lick the nectar from deep inside the flower using their long muzzles and tongues, collecting and transferring pollen on their snouts and fur from plant to plant. This relationship is thought to be a result of co-evolution.

===Geographic range and habitat===

Like all lemurs, this genus is found only on the island of Madagascar off the southeastern coast of Africa. Confined to the island&#x27;s seasonal eastern tropical rainforests, it is uncommon to rare throughout its range, which historically ran from the Masoala Peninsula in the northeast to the Mananara River in the south. Today, the black-and-white ruffed lemur has a much larger range than the red ruffed lemur, although it is very patchy, extending from slightly northwest of Maroantsetra, on Antongil Bay, in the north down the coast to the Mananara River near Vangaindrano in the south. Additionally, a concentrated population of black-and-white ruffed lemurs, of the subspecies &quot;Varecia variegata subcincta&quot;, can also be found on the island reserve of Nosy Mangabe in Antongil Bay. It is suspected that this population was introduced to the island in the 1930s. The red ruffed lemur, on the other hand, has a very restricted range on the Masoala Peninsula.

Historically, the confluence of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers may have been a zone of hybridization between these two species, although no conclusive results have indicated current interbreeding. In general, the Antainambalana River appears to isolate the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, &quot;V. v. subcincta&quot;. The subspecies &quot;V. v. variegata&quot; can be found further south, and &quot;V. v. editorum&quot; is the southernmost subspecies. The ranges of these two southern subspecies overlap and intermediate forms are reported to exist, although this has not been confirmed.

The rainforests in which these animals live are seasonal, with two primary seasons: the hot, wet season (November through April), and the cool, dry season (May through October). The primary habitat for both species, at any season, is in the crowns of trees, where they spend the majority of their time above ground. With the seasonal availability of resources being similar regardless of location, there is little to no difference in tree usage between species. From September through April, more fruit is available, so females prefer the lianas in the crowns of trees. Both sexes prefer the lower, major branches during the hot, rainy season. The tree crowns are predominantly used from May through August when young leaves and flowers are in abundance.

===Sympatric relations===
The following lemur species can be found within the same geographic range as ruffed lemurs:

* Greater dwarf lemur (&quot;Cheirogaleus major&quot;)
* Eastern lesser bamboo lemur (&quot;Hapalemur griseus griseus&quot;)
* Weasel sportive lemur (&quot;Lepilemur mustelinus&quot;)
* Diademed sifaka (&quot;Propithecus diadema&quot;)
* Common brown lemur (&quot;Eulemur fulvus&quot;)
* Red-bellied lemur (&quot;Eulemur rubriventer&quot;)
* Eastern woolly lemur (&quot;Avahi laniger&quot;)
* Indri (&quot;Indri indri&quot;)
* Brown mouse lemur (&quot;Microcebus rufus&quot;)
* Aye-aye (&quot;Daubentonia madagascariensis&quot;)
* White-headed lemur (&quot;Eulemur albifrons&quot;)

Ruffed lemurs either demonstrate feeding dominance or divide resources by using different forest strata. They are dominant over red-bellied lemurs, while eastern lesser bamboo lemurs avoid encountering them altogether. White-headed lemurs, on the other hand, prefer the understory and lower canopy, below , while the ruffed lemurs mainly keep to the upper canopy, above . Play has even been observed between infant ruffed lemurs and white-headed lemurs.

==Behavior==
Ruffed lemurs, on average, spend 28% of the day feeding, 53% resting, and 19% traveling, although differences in resting and feeding durations have been observed between males and females, with females resting less and feeding more. They are diurnal; although peak activity occurs during the early morning and late afternoon or evening, resting usually occurs around midday. When resting, ruffed lemurs often sit hunched or upright. They are also frequently seen lying prone over a branch or sunbathing in a supine position with the limbs outstretched. When feeding, they will often hang upside-down by their hind feet, a type of suspensory behavior, which allows them to reach fruits and flowers.
Being highly arboreal, they spend the majority of their time in the high canopy throughout the day. Ruffed lemurs spend the majority of their time between above the forest floor, followed by up, and are least frequently seen at . During the hot season, they will relocate to the lower canopy to help regulate their body temperature. In the cold season, ruffed lemurs are least active and may dedicate 2% of their resting time to sunbathing in order to warm up.

Long-term field research has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.

===Diet===

Being the most frugivorous members of the family Lemuridae, consuming an average of 74–90% fruit, ruffed lemurs also consume nectar (4–21%), and supplement the rest of their diet with young leaves (3–6%), mature leaves (1%), flowers (3–6%), and some seeds. Ruffed lemurs have also been reported to come to the ground to eat fungi and exhibit geophagy.

The majority of their diet is made up of relatively few common plant species, with a few species providing more than 50% of the diet. Fig species of the genus &quot;Ficus&quot;, for example, account for 78% of the fruit consumed by red ruffed lemurs on the Masoala Peninsula. Although plant species and diets vary by location, the most common food plants reported from the field include the following:

* &quot;Canarium&quot;
* &quot;Cryptocarya&quot;
* &quot;Ocotea&quot;
* &quot;Ravensara&quot; (family Lauraceae)
* &quot;Ficus&quot;
* &quot;Eugenia&quot;/&quot;Syzygium&quot;
* &quot;Grewia&quot;

Fruit trees do not appear to be selected by species but by availability and accessibility of edible fruit. And despite predominance of a few plant species in the ruffed lemur diet, the remainder of their diet consists of between 80 and 132 other species from 36 plant families.

The availability of food reflects the seasonal nature of the forests in which they live. During the hot season, fruit, flowers, and young leaves are more abundant, whereas the cold, wet season offers more young leaves and flowers. Despite this, the diet changes little between seasons, except that females will consume more high-protein, low-fiber items, such as young leaves and flowers, during pregnancy and lactation in order to offset the energy costs of reproduction. Nectar is only available sporadically, yet constitutes a major food source when the flowers bloom. The nectar of the traveler&#x27;s palm (&quot;Ravenala madagascariensis&quot;) is a favorite among ruffed lemurs.

===Social systems===
The social organization of ruffed lemurs is widely variable in both group organization and group composition, although no notable difference can be seen between the two species. Ruffed lemurs are typically described as multi-male groups with a fission-fusion social structure, although this can vary by season and locality.

In a study done at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of organization were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, ranging in size from two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.

In another study done at Nosy Mangabe on black-and-white ruffed lemurs a fourth level or organization was defined: affiliates. Affiliates were individuals with more persistent social bonds and more frequent interactions, usually within a core group, but sometimes also between core groups within a subgroup. Adult females typically had many affiliates, whereas adult males rarely interacted with conspecifics, living a more solitary existence.

Past studies have reported other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This may have been due to the use of short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.

Ranging behavior can also exhibit seasonal variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either alone or in groups of up to six individuals. In the cool, dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when fruit is abundant, subgroups are larger while scarcity is met with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, patchy, and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the social system in order to survive.

In terms of dominance, the ruffed lemur&#x27;s social structure is not as clear-cut as other lemur societies where female dominance is the norm. Although it is historically reported that &quot;males were subordinate to females,&quot; especially with captive and free-ranging ruffed lemur populations demonstrating this, wild populations cannot be definitively labeled as matriarchal due to inter-group variation.

There are also social differences between males and females. Females typically have many affiliates and bond strongly with other females both within and outside their core areas, but do not affiliate with individuals outside the community range, except during mating season. Males, on the other hand, are more solitary, interact with only a couple of conspecifics, have weak social bonds with other males, and rarely associate with others outside their core group. Furthermore, field studies suggest that only females play a role in communal home range defense. Males may scent-mark and remain relatively silent, but otherwise show little involvement during disputes.

Community range or territory size can vary widely, from while group size can range from a single pair to 31 individuals. Population density is also noticeably variable. These wide ranges can be attributed to differing levels of protection and degree of environmental degradation, with better protection and a less degraded environment resulting in higher population density and more moderately sized community ranges. (The duration and seasonality of the studies involved may also have contributed to low group size estimates and community ranges. A study at the Betampona Reserve, for instance, observed monogamous pairs with two to five infants maintaining ranges of .) Core areas at Ambatonikonilahy constituted approximately 10% of the overall community range and showed a close relationship with the location of the largest fruiting trees.

The average daily traveling distance for ruffed lemurs varies between , averaging per day. Activity patterns within the community range vary by gender and season. Males generally stay within a core area all year, whereas females only confine themselves to a core area during the cold wet season, then expand their range throughout the community range during the hot, rainy season. Females expand their traveling range slightly after giving birth, still staying within the core area, but gradually range further in December when they begin stashing their infants with other community members while they look for food. Females range the furthest later during the hot, rainy season. Both activity level and reproductive activity can be summarized in the following table.

Although males demonstrate little involvement in territorial disputes between neighboring communities, and ruffed lemur communities lack cohesiveness, females communally defend the community range against females of other communities. These disputes occur mostly during the hot, rainy season, when resources are more abundant and occur near the boundaries of community ranges. Spacing is maintained by scent marking and vocal communication. Ruffed lemurs are known for their loud, raucous calls that are answered by neighboring communities and subgroups within the same community.

During agonistic encounters between communities, chasing, scent-marking, calling, and occasional physical contact can be seen. Other social behaviors appear to vary between wild and captive ruffed lemurs, as illustrated by the following table.

Some affiliative behaviors are seasonal or gender-specific, such as the male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other&#x27;s backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during the end of the cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.

===Cognitive abilities===
Historically, relatively few studies of learning and cognition have been performed on strepsirrhine primates, including ruffed lemurs. However, a study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve demonstrated that ruffed lemurs, along with several other members of the family Lemuridae, could understand the outcome of simple arithmetic operations.

===Communication===

====Olfactory communication====
As with all strepsirrhine primates, olfactory communication is used extensively by ruffed lemurs – scent marking in territorial defense and disputes, as well as female greeting displays. The scents communicate the sex, location, and identity of their owner.

Females predominantly scent mark with their anogenital scent glands, by squatting to rub their anogenital region along horizontal surfaces, such as tree limbs. Males, on the other hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces and rubbing themselves over them. Both sexes will occasionally scent mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.

In greeting displays, female ruffed lemurs will leap over one another, scent marking the other individual&#x27;s back in the process.

====Auditory communication====

Ruffed lemurs are highly vocal, with an extensive vocal repertoire with calls being used in multiple contexts. Calls can also vary seasonally. During the hot, rainy season, the loud, raucous calls that are a hallmark of ruffed lemurs allow groups to remain in contact and maintain spacing. These loud calls can be heard up to away.

Ruffed lemurs use alarm calls that differentiate between ground and aerial predators. For instance an &quot;abrupt roar&quot; or &quot;huff&quot; alerts the group to an avian predator, and a &quot;pulsed squawk&quot; or &quot;growl-snort&quot; communicates the existence of a mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.

In captivity, ruffed lemur vocalizations have been studied and divided into three general groups: high-, medium-, and low-amplitude calls.

The well-known &quot;roar/shriek chorus&quot; is spontaneous, occurring most often during period of high activity, as well as being contagious, involving communal participation including infants three to four months old. &quot;Abrupt roars&quot; are also more common during high activity and aside from alerting group members to the presence of an avian predator, they probably also help maintain contact with individuals outside of visual range or indicate an aggressive/defensive response to a disturbance. In the wild, both of these calls are emitted more during the hot, rainy season due to heighten activity. All high-amplitude calls are delivered with from a &quot;taut&quot; body posture.

Medium-amplitude calls operate over a shorter range or often involve moderately arousing situations, such as frustration or submission. Low-amplitude calls also generally operate over a short range, yet also cover a wider range of aggravation levels.

Whines are highly variable between individual ruffed lemurs. &quot;Cough&quot;, &quot;grumble&quot;, &quot;squeak&quot;, and &quot;squeal&quot; have only been observed and researched in the wild.

The calls of ruffed lemurs vary only slightly between the two species. In fact, in captivity, it has been documented that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the &quot;pulsed squawk&quot;, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.

In black-and-white ruffed lemurs, &quot;pulsed squawks&quot; sometimes slow down as the group calms down, and integrate with the &quot;wail&quot;, creating &quot;pulsed squawk-wail intermediates&quot; .

===Breeding and reproduction===
Contrary to initial reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs in the wild exhibit seasonal polygamous breeding behavior, with both males and females mating with more than one partner within a single season. Mating is not restricted to just community members, but also involves members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to the mating season, although some matings occurred with roaming males from other communities.

Shortly before mating season begins, females exhibit swelling of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around the middle of their 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season and peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by the female towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting males during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may &quot;roar-shriek&quot; with each other. When a male approaches a female, he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female&#x27;s genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times during the course of a mating bout.

The mating season lasts from May through July, during the cold, rainy season, resulting in birth and peak lactation coinciding with the time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like the mating season, parturition is also seasonal, synchronized to the end of the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, rainy season.

In addition to an abnormally short gestation period, ruffed lemurs share another feature with small, nocturnal lemurs by producing the largest litters of the family Lemuridae. Litters typically include two or three infants, although up to five have been reported. Birth weights in captivity average between and range from . Ruffed lemur infants are altricial, and are born with their eyes open and a full coat of fur.

Ruffed lemurs are the only known primates to build arboreal nests, used exclusively for birth and for the first week or two of life. Starting three weeks prior to birth, females begin constructing the nest from twigs, branches, leaves, and vines, locating it within her core area and above ground. The nests have only one apparent entry point, and are shallow and dish-shaped. During the first couple of weeks, the mother is mostly solitary and does not travel far from the nest, spending as much as 70–90% of her time with the newborns (in captivity). In order to find food, she will leave the infants alone in the nest or, after the first couple of weeks, will carry them in her mouth and stash them in concealed locations in the canopy while she forages. Since this early developmental period corresponds with the end of the cold, dry season, which offers the least amount of fruit, energy is conserved for lactation while travel is limited. As the hot, rainy season begins, fruit availability rises, lactation demands rise as well, and females increase their travel distance in search of food.

Unlike other diurnal primates, which usually carry their infants with them, ruffed lemur mothers will stash their young by concealing them in the canopy foliage, leaving them to rest and sit quietly for several hours while she forages and performs other activities. Mothers continue to transport their offspring by mouth, moving them one at a time by grasping the infant&#x27;s belly crosswise. This form of transport usually stops around 2.5 months of age when the infants become too heavy to carry.

Ruffed lemurs are cooperative breeders, with parental care being shared by all community members. For example, mothers will stash their offspring with other mothers or leave them to be guarded by other community members, including non-breeding individuals of both genders. While the mother is away, community members will not only care for and guard them, but also sound alarm calls if danger is detected or if leaving the infant alone. They will also respond to alarm calls by others. These coordinated vigilance displays further involve communal transmission of the alarm call, with nearby community members repeating the alarm call, potentially summoning the mother back to her offspring. Infant transport by other members of the community has also been recorded. Females have been observed nursing infants of their close relatives, while close kin have adopted rejected infants, acting as foster parents.

Male care for infants has been documented in ruffed lemur societies. During early development, adult males may guard the nests of multiple core group females, as well as help care for the infants that were likely fathered by other males. During the season when females practice infant stashing, males effectively lighten the reproductive burden of up to several mothers by guarding, huddling, grooming, travelling, playing with and feeding the young.

Female ruffed lemurs produce relatively rich milk compared to other lemurs, and consequently, their young develop faster than those of other lemurs. Infants develop rapidly, attaining approximately 70–75% adult weight by the age of four months. They begin climbing and clinging at one month of age, advancing to the point of independently following their mother and group members through the canopy at heights of by two to three months. Full adult mobility is attained at three to four months of age. Socially, they begin exchanging contact calls with their mother at three weeks, and select their mother as their play partner 75–80% of the time during the first three months. Participation in greeting displays and more extensive vocalizations commences around four months, while scent marking does not start until six months of age. Infants begin testing solid food starting around 40 days to two months with weaning occurring between four and six months in the wild, although some individuals have continued to nurse until seven to eight months.

Infant mortality is often high among ruffed lemurs, but can also be highly variable. In some seasons, as many as 65% are unable to reach three months of age, possibly due to falls and related injuries, although in some seasons infant mortality is as low as 0%. For those that do survive to adulthood, sexual maturity is attained at 18 to 20 months in females and 32 to 48 months in males. Sexual maturity may take longer to reach in the wild compared to captivity. For females, the inter-birth interval, or time between successive offspring, is typically one year, and in captivity, females can remain reproductively active until the age of 23. The life expectancy for both species of ruffed lemur is estimated at 36 years in captivity.

==Conservation status==
In a land where approximately 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to only a small fraction of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.

The black-and-white ruffed lemur was elevated by the IUCN to critically endangered (A2cd) status from endangered status in 2008. They cite that &quot;the species is believed to have undergone a decline of 80% over a period of 27 years, due primarily to a decline in area and quality of habitat within the known range of the species and due to levels of exploitation.&quot; The total area of all known localities in which black-and-white ruffed lemurs exist is estimated at less than , while the total wild population is estimated between 1,000 and 10,000.

The red ruffed lemur was downgraded to endangered status from critically endangered status by the IUCN in 2008. The justification given includes its limited range, its restriction to only the Masoala Peninsula, and its risk from ongoing habitat loss and hunting. This species occupies a range of no more than , while the total wild population is estimated between 29,000 and 52,000 individuals. Red ruffed lemurs are only protected within the boundaries of the Masoala National Park. Historically, this species has been considered more threatened due to its highly restricted range, compared to the widely distributed black-and-white ruffed lemur. However, its protection within the island&#x27;s largest national park has slightly improved its chances at survival. Despite this, an assessment done in 2012 and published in 2014 reinstated the critically endangered status for the red ruffed lemur, largely due to the surge in illegal logging in Masoala National Park following the 2009 Malagasy political crisis.

There are several organizations involved in ruffed lemur conservation, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), the Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG), Monkeyland Primate Sanctuary in South Africa, Wildlife Trust, and the Duke Lemur Center (DLC). To conservation organizations, the ruffed lemurs are considered indicator, umbrella, and flagship species.

===Threats in the wild===
As with other primates, one of the principal threats to both ruffed lemur species is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining. Both species appear to be very sensitive to logging, and are thought to be the most vulnerable of rainforest lemurs. The hardwoods that are favored for construction materials and selectively logged are also preferred by ruffed lemurs for their fruits and potentially affect their travel routes through the canopy. Deforestation, on the other hand, is a result of the need to provide firewood and to support subsistence agriculture and cash crops. For red ruffed lemurs, Slash-and-burn agriculture, known locally as &quot;tavy&quot;, is practiced seasonally on the Masoala peninsula between October and December, and its practice is expanding. Additionally, cattle are sometimes allowed to free-range over these former agricultural clearings, preventing forest re-growth.

Another principal threat to the survival of ruffed lemurs is hunting. Local human populations still hunt and trap ruffed lemurs with traditional weapons, using them as a source of subsistence. Studies from villages in the Makira Forest have revealed that ruffed lemur meat is not only the desired food but is being hunted unsustainably. On the Masoala peninsula, the calls of red ruffed lemurs help hunters locate them. On this peninsula, firearms are used in addition to traditional traps, known as &quot;laly&quot;, which involve a strip of cleared forest with snares set on the few remaining branches that allow the lemurs to cross. Although hunting is illegal, the laws are generally not enforced and the local inhabitants show little concern about their hunting practices, which occur mostly from May to September. Hunting is the biggest concern in the Masoala peninsula because it is likely to continue, whereas logging and slash-and-burn agriculture could be curtailed. In other regions, hunters can scare away ruffed lemurs from their favorite food sources, even if they are hunting other prey. Lastly, these animals are taken from their natural habitats to display for tourists or are sold as exotic pets.

Frequent cyclones also pose a threat, particularly to concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including most of their food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility in the face of natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.

Predation in the wild appears to be very rare for ruffed lemurs, probably because living in the high canopy makes them challenging to catch. Evidence of predation by raptors, such as the Henst&#x27;s goshawk (&quot;Accipiter henstii&quot;) suggests it occurs at a low rate. The fossa (&quot;Cryptoprocta ferox&quot;) could present a potential risk if it found an individual lower in the forest canopy, but no confirmation has been presented to indicate that they prey upon ruffed lemurs. Instead, only re-introduced, captive-bred ruffed lemurs have been killed by fossa, likely due to their inexperience with predators. Nesting behavior poses the biggest risk of predation, making them susceptible to carnivorous mammals, such as the ring-tailed mongoose (&quot;Galidia elegans&quot;) and brown-tailed mongoose (&quot;Salanoia concolor&quot;).

===Captive breeding and reintroductions===
Captive populations of both ruffed lemur species exist in American and European zoos, representing a safeguard against extinction. In the United States, captive breeding is managed by the Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Although the populations are very limited in their genetic diversity, these species thrive in captivity, making them an ideal candidate for reintroduction into protected habitat, if it is available. Although reintroduction is seen as a last resort among conservationists, a combination of in situ conservation efforts, such as legal protection, public education, the spread of sustainable livelihoods, and reforestation offer hope for ruffed lemurs. In the meantime, reintroductions offer conservation research opportunities and allow the limited genetic diversity maintained by the SSP to improve the genetic diversity of dwindling Malagasy ruffed lemur populations.

A captive release first occurred in November 1997, when five black-and-white ruffed lemurs (&quot;Varecia variegata variegata&quot;) born in the United States were returned to Madagascar for release in the Betampona Strict Nature Reserve in eastern Madagascar. Popularly known as the &quot;Carolina Five&quot;, these individuals had lived their entire lives in the Natural Habitat Enclosures at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC). Since then, two more groups totaling 13 captive-born ruffed lemurs have been reintroduced into the same reserve, once in November 1998 and again in January 2001. These latter two groups also received &quot;boot camp training&quot; in the DLC forested free-range enclosures prior to release. So far, the results have shown some success, with 10 surviving longer than one year, 3 individuals integrating into wild groups, and 4 offspring have been born to or sired by released lemurs, all of which were parent-raised. Saraph, a male released with the first group, was reported to be doing well seven years post-release, living in a social group with a wild female and their offspring. Research has been ongoing since the initial release, as illustrated in the 1998 BBC documentary &quot;In the Wild: Operation Lemur with John Cleese&quot;. The research has provided useful information about their adaptation to life in the wild.

<text>Jean Baptiste Arthur Brillant (15 March 1890 – 10 August 1918) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
Brillant was born on 15 March 1890 in Assemetquagan, Routhierville, Quebec, the son of Joseph Brillant, a railway maintenance worker, and Rose-de-Lima Raiche.

Brillant studied at the College of Saint Joseph in Memramcook, New Brunswick, and then at the Séminaire de Rimouski in 1904–5. He later worked as a telegraph operator for a railway.

==World War I==
Brillant volunteered for service with the 89th (Temiscouata and Rimouski) Regiment (from 1920 the Fusiliers du St-Laurent) and held the rank of lieutenant. In 1916, eager to join the Canadian Expeditionary Force, he declared 13 years&#x27; service with this unit. On 20 March 1916 Brillant left his job as a telegrapher. After about six months’ training in Valcartier, he embarked for England with the 189th on 27 September 1916; on disembarking at Liverpool on 6 October, he was assigned to the 69th Infantry Battalion. He left for France on 27 October and joined the 22e Battalion (Canadien Francais) at Bully-Grenay.
During the night of 27/28 May 1918, in the vicinity of Boiry-Becquerelle, Brillant was called to lead a group of volunteers to help silence an outpost defended by about 50 men. Troops charged the enemy position, cut through the barbed wire protecting it, and took it. He was injured in the attack, yet captured enemy soldiers who had &quot;valuable information&quot;. Remaining in action that day despite his wounds, Brillant would be awarded the Military Cross on 16 September 1918.

He was awarded the VC for his actions on 8/9 August east of Meharicourt, France the first and second days of the Battle of Amiens. He died the next day on 10 August 1918.

===VC citation===
==Grave==
Brillant is buried at Villers-Bretonneux Military Cemetery, Fouilloy, France located 15 km (9 miles) east of Amiens. (Plot VIa, Row B, Grave 20). His gravestone bears the inscription: 
&lt;poem&gt;FILS DE JOSEPH BRILLANT
ENROLE VOLONTAIREMENT A RIMOUSKI, PROVINCE DE QUEBEC
TOMBE GLORIEUSEMENT SUR LE SOL DE SES AIEUX
BON SANG NE PEUT MENTIR&lt;/poem&gt;
which (roughly) translates to:
&lt;poem&gt;SON OF JOSEPH BRILLANT
VOLUNTARILY ENLISTED IN RIMOUSKI, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC
FELL GLORIOUSLY ON THE SOIL OF HIS FOREFATHERS
GOOD BLOOD DOES NOT LIE (a French expression meaning that he bore the positive traits of his ancestors)&lt;/poem&gt;

His medals are held at the Royal 22e Regiment Museum in Quebec City.

A monument to Jean Brillant was erected in 1970 in Montreal, located in the park which also bears his name.

<doc id="1210400" wikidata="Q197859" url="?curid=1210400" title="Zhonghe District">
<text>Zhonghe District (, Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tiong-hô Khu), also spelled Chūwa and Jhonghe, is an inner city district in New Taipei City in northern Taiwan (ROC). 

Zhonghe was founded in 1946 as an urban township in what then known as Taipei County in Taiwan Province, until it gained county-administered city status in 1979 and again as a district of New Taipei in 2010.

==Geography and climate==
Zhonghe lies just south-west of Taipei City and shares borders with Banqiao, Xindian, Tucheng and Yonghe Districts of New Taipei City, as well as Taipei City. The average annual temperature is and the precipitation averages per year. Most of Zhonghe lies a few tens of meters above sea level and is heavily urbanized, with forested hillier country in the southeast. A mountainous ridge forms most of the eastern border with Xindian, which includes the highest point in Zhonghe, the 302-meter Fenglusai ().

==History==
The present-day area of Zhonghe District was originally settled by aboriginal tribes. During conflict between the colonial forces of the Dutch and the Spanish, the area is recorded by the Dutch as Chiron, from the name of one of the tribes living there. This name is preserved in one of the constituent villages of the city, called &quot;Xiulang Li&quot; (), and the bridge which connects Zhonghe and Xindian.

The area was subsequently settled by Han Chinese migrants from Fujian but remained relatively unimportant until the end of the Second World War.

===Republic of China===
In 1946, the population of the area of present-day Zhonghe and Yonghe was 30,000 and it was classified as a rural township. Due to rapid population growth Yonghe was separated from Zhonghe in 1958. Subsequently, on 1 January 1979, Zhonghe was upgraded to county-administered city status after reaching a population of 170,000. On 25 December 2010, due to the changing from Taipei County to New Taipei City, Zhonghe City was changed to Zhonghe District.

==Administrative divisions==

Zhonghe is divided into 93 villages, which are further subdivided into &quot;lín&quot; (), of which there are 2,972 in total. Some administration is shared with neighbouring Yonghe District; due to both this and their proximity, they are sometimes collectively known as Shuanghe (). This is also reflected in the names of various institutions such as Shuang-Ho Hospital in Zhonghe and Shuanghe Libai Church in Yonghe District.

==Transportation==

===Rail===
Zhonghe is served by the Zhonghe–Xinlu line and the Circular line of the New Taipei Metro. Three metro stations of the Zhonghe–Xinlu line are located in Zhonghe: Yongan Market, Jingan, and the terminal station, Nanshijiao. Six metro stations of the Circular line, , , , , , and are located in Zhonghe as well. Jingan Station is an interchange station between the Circular line and Zhonghe-Xinlu lines. In the future, the Wanda–Zhonghe–Shulin line and the north–south section of the Circular line will eventually bring the number of MRT stations in Zhonghe to fifteen. The closest regular rail and high-speed services are from Banqiao station in neighbouring Banqiao District.

===Road===
Zhonghe has an interchange on one of Taiwan&#x27;s two main north–south road arteries; the National Highway 3. Also providing road links is Provincial Highway 64, an elevated expressway that cuts through the middle of the district, with several on and off-ramps in Zhonghe itself. There are two bridges over the Xindian River; Xiulang Bridge, which connects Zhonghe with Xindian, and Huazhong Bridge, reaching Taipei&#x27;s Wanhua District.

==Parks and attractions==
* Jinhe Sports Park
* Dinosaur Park

==Education==
Zhonghe is home to the National Taiwan Library, which is located in the grounds of the 8-23 Memorial Park. It has one of the best collections in Taiwan of factual books about Taiwan in English.

===Burma Street===
Zhonghe Myanmar Street or Burma Street, near Nanshijiao metro station, is home to a large proportion of Taiwan&#x27;s small Burmese immigrant population. Zhonghe District is home to 40,000 Burmese Chinese (2008), making up 10% of Zhonghe&#x27;s population, and constituting one of the largest communities of Burmese Chinese outside of Burma.

<doc id="1210420" wikidata="Q16980826" url="?curid=1210420" title="Jolly Rancher">
<text>Jolly Rancher is an American brand of sweet hard candy, gummies, jelly beans, lollipops, and sour bites, and a line of soda put out by Elizabeth Beverage Company in 2004. Originally created in Colorado in the 1950s, the Jolly Rancher brand has been owned by The Hershey Company since 1996.

== History ==
Bill and Dorothy Harmsen founded the Jolly Rancher Company in 1949, choosing the name to give the impression of a friendly Western company, and opened their first Jolly Rancher Ice Cream Store in Golden, Colorado on May 28, 1949. Finding that ice cream was hard to sell in the cold winter months, they added a line of bulk and boxed chocolate that was provided by a small candy firm in the Denver area. Jolly Rancher Company opened a number of franchise stores in Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska and provided both chocolate candies and a five cent hot cinnamon taffy stick that proved to be very popular. It was this candy&#x27;s popularity that caused Jolly Rancher Company to expand its hard candy line.

Jolly Rancher filed for a trademark for Jolly Rancher as a word mark on March 31, 1958, and received registration number 0695762 for that trademark on April 5, 1960. The first use in commerce for that Jolly Rancher word mark was noted in the filing as being June 1, 1960.

In 1966, Jolly Rancher Company was sold to Beatrice Foods, although Bill Harmsen continued to operate the business. In 1983, Leaf, Inc. acquired a number of candy brands from Beatrice, Jolly Rancher included. In October 1996, The Hershey Company agreed to purchase the North American confectionery brands of Leaf, Inc. which included Jolly Rancher, Whoppers, Milk Duds, Good &amp; Plenty, PayDay and Heath bar. As part of the transaction, Hershey agreed to sell most of its European candy operations to Huhtamäki Oy, Leaf&#x27;s parent company.

In 2002, Hershey closed the Arvada, Colorado plant and moved the manufacturing of the candy to Mexico to save costs.

In 2014, Hershey acquired Ontario based company The Allan Candy Co. and moved the manufacturing of the candy exclusively to the Granby plant, in Quebec, Canada.

== Flavors ==
Jolly Rancher&#x27;s original flavors were watermelon, apple, and fire stix. They soon introduced cherry, orange tangerine, lemon, grape, peach, and sour apple. Eventually, blue raspberry replaced lemon. Current flavors include cherry, blue raspberry, grape, green apple, and watermelon. There are also sour, cinnamon, and smoothie varieties. In 2013, lemon was reintroduced in an all-lemon bag. In 2015, Jolly Rancher offered a &quot;Fruity Bash&quot; variety bag which includes strawberry, mountain berry, lemon, orange, and pineapple. In 2017, Jolly Rancher offered a &quot;Hotties&quot; variety bag which includes watermelon &amp; cayenne pepper, blue raspberry &amp; sriracha, cherry &amp; habanero, and green apple &amp; ginger. In 2020, Jolly Rancher offered a tropical variety bag featuring fruit punch, golden pineapple, lime, and mango flavors. They also offer a &quot;red&quot; bag, which included cherry, watermelon, strawberry and fruit punch. As of 2012, the passion mix, which included the peach flavor, and the wild berry mix were discontinued by The Hershey Company. The Hotties mix was discontinued in 2019. In 2020, the peach flavor was brought back in an &quot;all-peach&quot; bag, and replaced the mountain berry flavor in the Fruity Bash bag.

==Product variations== 


== Chemistry ==
Jolly Ranchers are amorphous solids, meaning their molecular arrangements have no specific pattern. They are hard, brittle, rigid, translucent and have low molecular mobility. Jolly Ranchers are formed from highly concentrated sugar solutions (greater than 95% sugar) and have extremely high viscosity. Their &quot;glassy&quot; appearance is a result of the way they are processed. During processing, the sugar syrup is cooled so rapidly that no crystals have time to form. Jolly Ranchers hold their solid shape when kept in temperatures less than the glass transition temperature (Tg). If the temperature is greater than the Tg, the hard and glassy-like structure of the Jolly Rancher becomes a soft and rubbery material.

== Manufacturing ==
Jolly Ranchers are manufactured by creating a solution of corn syrup, sucrose, glucose, or fructose syrup that is boiled to a temperature of and cooled to create a supersaturated mixture that is roughly 2.5 percent water. As the mixture is cooled, natural and artificial flavoring and artificial colors are added to individual batches of syrup solution which are later mixed with malic acid to improve shelf life and add further flavor. Once the mixture begins to cool, it is then extruded into long malleable strings that are cut to size and individually wrapped and packaged.

<doc id="1210436" wikidata="Q1393862" url="?curid=1210436" title="Patsy Rowlands">
<text>Patricia Amy Rowlands (19 January 1931 – 22 January 2005) was an English actress who is best remembered for her roles in the &quot;Carry On&quot; films series, as Betty Lewis in the ITV Thames sitcom &quot;Bless This House&quot;, and as Alice Meredith in the Yorkshire Television sitcom &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;.

==Early years==
Rowlands was born in Palmers Green, Middlesex and attended the Sacred Heart convent school at Whetstone. While attending, an elocution teacher spotted her potential and encouraged her to pursue a career in acting. She applied for the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and won a scholarship aged 15.

==Early career==
Rowlands began her career in the chorus of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, followed by a summer season in Torquay. She then spent several years with the Players&#x27; Theatre in London, before making her West End theatre debut in Sandy Wilson&#x27;s musical &quot;Valmouth&quot;.

Her final appearance was as Mrs Pearce in the National Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; which also starred Jonathan Pryce.

From 1971 to 1976, Rowlands played Betty, the feckless neighbour in the ITV sitcom &quot;Bless This House&quot;, which starred fellow &quot;Carry On&quot; star Sid James. Her other television credits at this time included a couple of episodes of &quot;For the Love of Ada&quot;, playing a pregnant woman in the maternity ward also appearances with comedians such as Les Dawson and Dick Emery. In the early 1980s, she appeared with Thora Hird in the sitcom &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;, in which they played an aunt and niece in The Salvation Army. In 1991, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Zorro&quot; filmed in Madrid, Spain.

Rowlands also appeared in screen versions of two of Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s books: the television film &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; (1980), as Mrs. Dibble, and a TV dramatisation of &quot;A Little Princess&quot; (1986) as the baker&#x27;s wife.

==Later years==
Towards the end of her life, Rowlands appeared in several revivals of major musicals such as &quot;Oliver!&quot; at the London Palladium and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

<doc id="1210440" wikidata="Q721032" url="?curid=1210440" title="Stefan Grabiński">
<text>Stefan Grabiński (26 February 1887 – 12 November 1936) was a Polish writer of fantastic literature and horror stories. He is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Polish Poe&quot; or &quot;Polish Lovecraft&quot;, although his works are often surrealistic or explicitly erotic in a way that sets him apart from both. He was an expert in parapsychology, magic and demonology and had an interest in the works of the German Expressionist filmmakers.

A number of his stories have been translated into English by Miroslaw Lipinski and published as &quot;The Dark Domain&quot;. His story &quot;Szamota&#x27;s Mistress&quot; was adapted to film as part of a B Movie trilogy called &quot;Evil Streets&quot;. He is nicknamed the &quot;Polish Poe&quot;.

== Biography ==
Grabiński was born in Kamionka Strumiłowa, then part of Poland (present-day Kamianka-Buzka, Ukraine), situated by the Bug River. His family was well off as his father, Dionizos, was a local judge, but Stefan&#x27;s childhood was marred because of his proneness to various illnesses. He often read while lying in bed, which made him slightly reclusive and nurtured his bias in favor of dark fantasy and mysticism. After his father&#x27;s death, the family moved to Lviv.

He graduated from the local high school in 1905, then studied Polish Literature and philology at the former Jan Kazimierz University, which is presently the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. While a student there, he discovered that he had tuberculosis, which was common in his family. 

As he was an ardent pantheist, fond of Christian mysticism and Eastern religious texts, as well as Theosophy and demonology, this discovery only enhanced his occult worldview and approach to writing. Upon graduating in 1911, he began work as a secondary school teacher in Lviv. During this time, he also traveled extensively, visiting Austria, Italy, and Romania. From 1917 to 1927, he was a teacher in Przemyśl.

He first began to write short fiction in 1906 and his mother was his first reader and critic. A collection of short stories, &quot;Exceptions: In the Dark of Faith&quot; (), written under the pen name Stefan Żalny (&quot;Żalny&quot; means &#x27;doleful&#x27;) became his self-published debut in 1909. These tales have never been judged highly. The general opinion being that his hyperbolical, at times anachronistic literary style couldn&#x27;t be appreciated by the majority of his readers. His second volume of short stories, &quot;On the Hill of Roses&quot; (), was published nine years later, and received modest critical approval.

However, this book impressed Polish decadent writer and literary critic Karol Irzykowski. They became good friends, and Irzykowski supported Grabiński&#x27;s career. In 1920, Grabiński presented a collection of his mystic railway stories called &quot;The Motion Demon&quot; (). Eventually, the following collections of short stories appeared: &quot;Pilgrim’s Madness&quot; (, 1920), &quot;An Incredible Story&quot; () and &quot;The Book of Fire&quot; (, 1922). His longest prose work, &quot;Passion&quot; (), written in 1930, was inspired by his trip to Italy, most notably Venice.

The symbolic imagery of Grabiński&#x27;s works was embodied by eerie creatures, such as incubi, witches, doppelgängers, spirits of various sorts, and mysterious messages from the underworld. His fiction is usually considered bizarre because it is permeated with magic, occult eroticism, parapsychological effects, and Oriental mysticism.

A quote from his short story &quot;&quot;, is said to reflect his usual state of mind: &quot;I cannot free myself from that strong, commanding voice which speaks to me, or from that mysterious power which pushes aside objects, contemptuous of their size; I am still wearied by endless monotonous roads that led nowhere. That is why I am not a perfect spirit, only an &#x27;insane person&#x27;, someone who arouses in normal people pity, contempt or fear. But I do not complain. Even like this, I am better off than those of healthy mind.”

His tuberculosis worsened and he was forced to spend more time seeking treatment. In 1931, he settled in the resort and spa town of Brzuchowice (now Briukhovychi) where, despite some recent financial return for his writings, he increasingly fell into obscurity and was abandoned by most of his friends. In 1936, he died in extreme poverty in Lviv and is buried there at .

His work was largely forgotten until after World War II, when the literary historian wrote a monograph on his work. Later his stories were promoted by the science-fiction critic, and some appeared in the , published by Wydawnictwo Literackie. In an interview, Lem admits the influence of Grabiński&#x27;s horror stories on his early works, including &quot;Terminus&quot;.

In the marketing for an English collection of his short stories, &quot;Masters of the Weird Tale&quot;, Centipede Press called him the &quot;Polish Poe&quot;.

<text>Christopher Lyall Smith (born 15 October 1958) is a former cricketer for Hampshire and England. He also played one match for Glamorgan in 1979, while playing in the South Wales League, and in South Africa he played for Natal B (then a first-class team).

==Life and career==
Born on 15 October 1958 in Durban, South Africa, Smith was unable to play Test cricket for South Africa due to their exclusion from international sport because of the apartheid regime, but played for England through his parents&#x27; nationality. Ironically his opportunity was assisted by the fact that a number of alternative England opening batsmen such as Graham Gooch and Wayne Larkins were banned from international cricket after participating in a rebel tour of South Africa in 1982. However, Smith played only eight Test matches, never establishing himself in the side.

Smith had the misfortune to be dismissed first ball by Richard Hadlee on Test debut at Lord&#x27;s in 1983 (although he made 43 in the second innings as England won the match), but was selected the next winter for the tour to New Zealand and Pakistan. There he made some useful contributions, including a score of 91 in Auckland. Smith also played four one-day internationals in 1984 with a highest score of 70. Smith was also an occasional off-spin bowler who took five cheap international wickets, including figures of 2–8 in a one-day international against Pakistan. After he toured Sri Lanka with an England &#x27;B&#x27; side in 1986,
his last Test came in 1986 at Leeds against India as an injury replacement for David Gower. He was dropped when Gower was fit again.

Smith was much more successful for Hampshire, enjoying a successful career with that county, scoring more than 40 first-class hundreds and helping them to win the 1988 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, and the 1991 NatWest Trophy (though missing the final of the latter). He was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1984.

After he retired from first-class cricket, he settled in Western Australia, and became marketing manager of the Western Australian Cricket Association.

Chris Smith is the older brother of fellow Hampshire and England Test player Robin Smith. His brother made his England debut at Leeds, two years after Smith had played his last Test on the same ground, and went onto a more extensive international career.

<text>Hayes Prison Farm, a former Australian minimum security prison for males, was established on land at Hayes, near New Norfolk, Tasmania. The facility was operated by the Tasmanian Prison Service, an agency of the Department of Justice of the Government of Tasmania. Located on , the facility accepted felons convicted under Tasmanian and/or Commonwealth legislation. The facility was closed in late 2012.

==Facilities==
The original site consisted of an orchard, grazing land and a small forest. The prison was opened in 1937 and consisted of single wooden huts for 20 persons, built by prisoners. Another 50 single huts were built as numbers increased. A 50-cell block was built in 1968 and an extra block of 20 cells was built in 1970. The cell and administration buildings were replaced with concrete block construction in 1964 and are still in use today. At its peak, Hayes had large market vegetable gardens, 1,000 pigs, 1,800 laying hens, 2,000 sheep, an award-winning dairy herd and a clay processing plant that sold clay to Salamanca potters. Three truckloads packed with vegetables left the prison farm each week. Their customers included the Royal Derwent Hospital, Lachlan Park, the Royal Hobart and St John&#x27;s hospitals, several nursing homes in the Hobart region, government departments and the prison itself. More than 300 cows are at Hayes. The farm is also responsible for a much smaller herd, which keeps the grass short at Government House in Hobart. Hayes sells 1.1 million litres of milk to dairy company National Foods each year. It also grows about of glasshouse, vine-ripened tomatoes and 1,700 bales of hay and silage.

The purpose of the farm is to assist inmates to develop skills to prepare them for exiting prison and to address recidivism.

In June 2011, it was announced that the Hayes Prison Farm will be decommissioned because of a 4.5 million repair bill. It is expected that the decommission process will take approximately 18 months. Prisoners would be moved to the recommissioned Ron Barwick facility at Risdon Prison. The decision to close Hayes was condemned by the State Opposition, unions and prisoner advocates. Should the closure proceed, Tasmania will be the only state that does not have a minimum security open facility. Government officials expect to yield up to A$2.5 million from the sale of Hayes.

In July 2011, three prisoners escaped in two separate incidents over three weeks, two of whom were caught within 24 hours.

The Tasmanian Government closed Hayes Prison Farm in August 2012 and moved all inmates to the minimum security Ron Barwick facility at Risdon Prison.

The property was sold to a private owner in January 2015.

<text>HMS &quot;Grafton&quot; (H89) was a G-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the non-intervention measures agreed by Britain and France. After the beginning of World War II she was transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet to Great Britain for escort and contraband inspection duties. &quot;Grafton&quot; was refitting when the Norwegian Campaign began in April 1940, but the ship escorted convoys to Norway once her refit was completed. She evacuated British troops from the Dunkirk bridgehead in May, but was sunk by a German submarine after she stopped to rescue survivors from another British destroyer.

==Description==
&quot;Grafton&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. &quot;Grafton&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and ratings in peacetime, but in increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft defence &quot;Grafton&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

==Service==
&quot;Grafton&quot; was laid down by John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company, at Woolston, Hampshire on 30 August 1934, launched on 18 September 1935 and completed on 20 March 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £248,485. Aside from a brief period when she was assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla after her commissioning, &quot;Grafton&quot; spent the prewar period assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet. Between 10 August and 9 September 1936, together with , she escorted the yacht &quot;Nahlin&quot; as King Edward VIII cruised the eastern Mediterranean. Afterwards &quot;Grafton&quot; patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee. The ship was refitting in Malta when World War II began in September 1939.

&quot;Grafton&quot; and three of her sisters were transferred to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October. The following month, however, the ship was reassigned at the end of the month to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla in Harwich of the Nore Command for patrol and escort duties. On 10 January 1940, she was transferred to the reconstituted 1st Destroyer Flotilla, also based at Harwich, where &quot;Grafton&quot; inspected ships travelling between German and Dutch ports for contraband. Between 26 March and 14 April the ship was given a brief overhaul in Hull in the shipyard of Brigham and Cowan. As the Norwegian Campaign had begun while &quot;Grafton&quot; was refitting, she was reassigned to the Home Fleet where she escorted convoys to Norway until 11 May.

===Operation Dynamo===
During the Siege of Calais, &quot;Grafton&quot; escorted the light cruisers and as they provided naval gunfire support for the 30th Motor Brigade on 26 May. The following day she evacuated over 1,600 troops from the beaches of La Panne and Bray, northeast of Dunkirk. On the morning of 29 May, she stopped to rescue survivors from the destroyer , which had been torpedoed and sunk earlier that morning by the German E-boat &quot;S-30&quot;. While rescuing survivors from &quot;Wakeful&quot; off Nieuwpoort, Belgium, &quot;Grafton&quot; was struck in the stern by a torpedo from the German submarine . This seriously damaged the ship, and also triggered a secondary explosion which damaged the bridge, killing the captain and another officer. Thirteen ratings and the canteen manager were also killed. The ship&#x27;s back was broken, but she remained afloat long enough for all survivors to be rescued by the destroyer and the transport &quot;Malines&quot;. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; sank &quot;Grafton&quot; with naval gunfire, as she was too badly damaged to be towed to safety.

<doc id="1210457" wikidata="Q1232435" url="?curid=1210457" title="Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus">
<text>Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus (also spelled as Messalinus, c. 36 BC – after AD 21) was a Roman senator who was elected consul for 3 BC.

==Early life==
Messallinus was born and raised in Rome. He was the oldest son of the senator, orator and literary patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus (whom he resembled in character) and his wife Calpurnia. Messallinus is known to have had at least one sister, Valeria, who married the senator Titus Statilius Taurus. From his father&#x27;s second marriage, his younger paternal half-brother was the senator Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus. Messallinus was the great-uncle of Lollia Paulina, the third wife of Caligula, and a relation to Statilia Messalina, the third wife of Nero.

==Career==
The poet Albius Tibullus mentions that Messallinus was admitted into the , the in charge of the Sibylline Books. Syme notes that the date of Messallinus&#x27; admission was before the poet&#x27;s death in 19 BC, and argues the admission was in 21 BC. He served as a consul in 3 BC.

In AD 6, Messallinus served as a governor in Illyricum. During his time in Illyricum, he served with Tiberius with distinction in a campaign against the Pannonians and Dalmatians in the uprising of the Great Illyrian Revolt with the half-strength Legio XX Valeria Victrix. Messallinus defeated the Pannonii, led by Bato the Daesitiate, and prevented the spreading of the uprising. For his defeat over Bato, Messallinus was rewarded with a triumphal decoration (ornamenta triumphalia) and a place in the procession during Tiberius’ Pannonian triumph in AD 12, four years after the death of his father.

In the first session of the Senate after Tiberius ascended to the imperial throne in AD 14, Messallinus suggested that an oath of allegiance should be sworn to the emperor yearly. Tiberius declined this offer, then asked if this motion was his own idea. Messallinus replied that it was a spontaneous suggestion, meant to show public spirit, even at the risk of his own safety. He next appears in history six years later, in AD 20, as part of the outcome of the trial and execution of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. Tacitus notes that Messallinus, along with Caecina Severus, proposed a golden statue be placed in the temple of Mars the Avenger, and an altar dedicated to Vengeance, in celebration of the execution of Piso. Emperor Tiberius blocked the motion, pointing out that victories over foreign powers were commemorated with such acts, but domestic conflicts should be shrouded in silent grief. Messallinus was recorded as also proposing that public thanks be given to Tiberius and other individuals for having avenged Germanicus. When Lucius Nonius Asprenas pointedly asked if Messallinus had intentionally omitted all mention of Claudius in his proposal, the future emperor was then added. Messallinus also appears as one of seven witnesses of the &quot;Senatus consultum de Cn. Pisone patre&quot;, the Roman Senate&#x27;s official act concerning the trial and punishment of Piso.

The last time Tacitus mentions Messallinus is in his account of AD 21, when he spoke against a motion before the Senate to forbid senators from bringing their wives with them when leaving to govern a province. Syme hints that Messallinus died not long after, noting that Tacitus provided no obituary notice for the senator, concluding that &quot;the oration did service as a conspicuous exit.&quot;

==Literature==
Tibullus is not the only poet to mention Messallinus. From his exile at Tomis, the poet Ovid addressed as many as three poems to him. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Tristia&quot; comprises poems written during his travel into exile, and his first years at Tomis, none of which mention names. Syme explains this omission &quot;ostensibly to avoid embarrassment&quot;. Despite this, Syme is confident that one of the poems in &quot;Tristia&quot; (IV.4) is addressed to Messalinus. After beginning with a compliment to noble birth, to noble character, and to eloquence inherited from his father, Ovid pleads with Messalinus to intervene with Augustus to recall him from exile.

The next other two poems are part of his three-book collection titled &quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot; (&quot;Letters from the Black Sea&quot;), in elegiacs like &quot;Tristia&quot;, but providing the names of the addressees of the poems unlike &quot;Tristia&quot;. Syme dates the first poem (I.7) to AD 12, and the second (II.2) to the following year. Both repeat Ovid&#x27;s pleas for help to be recalled from Tomis. &quot;The three pieces to his address fail to disclose any close personal relationship, common acquaintances, or liking for poetry,&quot; Syme observes, and contrasts this to Ovid&#x27;s relationship with Messalinus&#x27; brother Cotta Maximus. &quot;Ovid knew him from the cradle (&quot;Ex P.&quot; II.3.72), he mentions in 11 his wife and new-born son (&quot;Tr.&quot; IV.5.27ff).&quot;

==Family==
Messallinus&#x27; daughter Valeria Messallia was born c. 10 BC (her mother might have been Claudia Marcella Minor) and later married the praetor of AD 17, Lucius Vipstanus Gallus. In the next generation two Vipstani are known, with the cognomina &quot;Messalla&quot; and &quot;Poplicola&quot;. This led Ronald Syme to observe that either Lucius or Marcus Vipstanus Gallus married a daughter of Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus and Claudia Marcella Minor, who is named (for convenience) Valeria Messallia. This alliance with the gens Valeria led to the prominence of the family during the first centuries of the Roman Empire. According to the French Historian Christian Settipani, after the death of her husband Paullus Aemilius Lepidus, Marcella married the Roman Senator Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus. Marcella bore Messallinus a daughter called Valeria Messallia, born ca. 10 BC, who later married the praetor of 17, Lucius Vipstanus Gallus. However, Messallinus (son of Corvinus) was younger than Marcella. That fact does not prevent the marriage, but makes it unlikely, given Roman tradition.

<text>Gongliao District (; originally ) is a rural district in the eastern part of New Taipei City, Taiwan. It is the easternmost district on the main island of Taiwan and at its easternmost tip is Cape Santiago.

==History==
During the period of Japanese rule, Gongliao was called , and was administered under Kīrun District, Taihoku Prefecture.

==Geography==

The area of the district is approximately 99.97 square kilometers. There are about 11,177 people living in the district.

== Tourist attractions ==
* Fulong Beach and Hohaiyan Rock Festival
&quot;Fulong Beach&quot;, also known as Fulong Bathing Beach (福隆海水浴場), is located at Fulong Village, Gongliao District, New Taipei City at Northeastern Taiwan. It is the outlet of the Shuang River.

The sands there are golden, which is rare in Taiwan. Nearby is a camping site named Longmen. This beach is a favorite in the summer for people living in northern Taiwan. It is also a popular area for surfing, windsurfing, and fishing. 

The Shuang River divides the beach into inner and outer parts. There is a footbridge named Rainbow Bridge (彩虹橋) linking the two parts. However, the watercourse of the river varies every year to some extent; sometimes the bridge is functional; other times it is not, because the seaside end would be in the river or in the sea.

Since 2000, the Hohaiyan Rock Festival (貢寮國際海洋音樂祭) has been held here for 3 to 5 days in the summer. Normally, it takes place in mid-July, but sometimes it has been delayed due to typhoon interruption or damage to the band shell facilities. Also the watercourse of the Shuang River sometimes changes shape or size, influencing the location of these temporary band shells.

* Aodi
&quot;Aodi&quot;&#x27; (sometimes Audi, Aoti, Auti; ) is a small fishing village in Gongliao. It is a popular tourist destination owing to its scenic setting and many seafood restaurants. It is also close to the controversial Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant, under construction since 1999. A nearby beach, Yenliao (鹽寮), was the site of the first landing for the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in 1895.
* Cape Santiago Lighthouse at the Cape Santiago
* Yanliao Beach Park
* Old Caoling Tunnel

==Infrastructure==
Taiwan&#x27;s fourth nuclear power plant is under construction in Gongliao. Construction of the plant is opposed by most of the community&#x27;s residents. 

==Transportation==

<doc id="1210462" wikidata="Q371183" url="?curid=1210462" title="Gaboon viper">
<text>The Gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica), also called the Gaboon adder, is a large and highly venomous viper species found in the rainforests and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. It is the largest member of the genus &quot;Bitis.&quot; Like all other vipers, it is venomous, but has the longest fangs of any venomous snake – up to in length – and the highest venom yield of any snake. No subspecies are recognized.

==Taxonomy==
The Gaboon viper was described in 1854 as &quot;Echidna gabonica&quot;.

Lenk &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) discovered genetic differences between the two conventionally recognized subspecies of &quot;B. g. gabonica&quot; and &quot;B. g. rhinoceros&quot;. According to their research, these two subspecies are as genetically different from each other as they are from &quot;B. nasicornis&quot;. Consequently, they regard the western form as a separate species, &quot;B. rhinoceros&quot;.

The snake&#x27;s common names include Gaboon viper, butterfly adder, forest puff adder, whisper, swampjack, and Gaboon adder.

Originally a name given by the Portuguese, &quot;Gabon&quot; (&quot;Gabão&quot;) refers to the estuary on which the town of Libreville was built, in Gabon, and to a narrow strip of territory on either bank of this arm of the sea. As of 1909, &quot;Gaboon&quot; referred to the northern portion of French Congo, south of the equator and lying between the Atlantic Ocean and 12°E longitude.

==Description==

Adults are typically in total length (body and tail). The maximum total length of this species is often cited as for a specimen collected in Sierra Leone, but individuals from this locale are now reclassified as &quot;Bitis rhinoceros&quot;. The sexes may be distinguished by the length of the tail in relation to the total length of the body: around 12% for males and 6% for females. Adults, especially females, are very heavy and stout. One female measured at in total length, a head width of , a width or circumference of , and a weight of .

In their description of &quot;B. gabonica&quot;, Spawls &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) give a total length of , with a maximum total length of , saying the species may possibly grow larger still. They acknowledge reports of specimens over , or even over in total length, but claim no evidence supports this. A large specimen of total length, caught in 1973, was found to have weighed with an empty stomach. It is the heaviest venomous snake in Africa and one of the heaviest in the world along with the king cobra and eastern diamondback rattlesnake.

The head is large and triangular, while the neck is greatly narrowed, only about one-third the width of the head. A pair of &quot;horns&quot; is present between the raised nostrils—tiny in &quot;B. gabonica&quot;. The eyes are large and moveable, set well forward, and surrounded by 15–21 circumorbital scales. The species has 12–16 interocular scales across the top of the head. Four or five scale rows separate the suboculars and the supralabials, with 13–18 supralabials and 16–22 sublabials. The fangs may reach a length of , the longest of any venomous snake.

Midbody, the 28–46 dorsal scale rows are strongly keeled except for the outer rows on each side. The lateral scales are slightly oblique. The ventral scales number 124–140, rarely more than 132 in males, rarely less than 132 in females. With 17–33 paired subcaudal scales, males have no fewer than 25, and females no more than 23. The anal scale is single.

The color pattern is striking in the open, but in nature, typically among dead leaves under trees, it provides a high degree of camouflage; in a well-kept cage with a suitable base of dried leaves, overlooking several fully exposed specimens completely is easy. The pattern consists of a series of pale, subrectangular blotches running down the center of the back, interspaced with dark, yellow-edged, hourglass markings. The flanks have a series of fawn or brown rhomboidal shapes, with light vertical central bars. The belly is pale with irregular brown or black blotches. The head is white or cream with a fine, dark central line, black spots on the rear corners, and a dark blue-black triangle behind and below each eye. The iris colour is cream, yellow-white, orange, or silvery. A possible Batesian mimic of the Gaboon viper has been found, which is the Congolese giant toad (&quot;Sclerophrys channingi&quot;); this species of frog seems to resemble the viper&#x27;s head, which contrasts with its darker-colored body.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species can be found in Guinea, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, northern Angola, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, eastern Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, eastern Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and northeast KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa. Mallow &quot;et al.&quot; (2003) also list Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Liberia in West Africa. The type locality is given as &quot;Gabon&quot; (Africa).

The Gaboon viper is usually found in rainforests and nearby woodlands, mainly at low altitudes, but sometimes as high as 1500 m above sea level. Spawls &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) mention a maximum altitude of 2100 m. According to Broadley and Cock (1975), it is generally found in environments that are parallel to those occupied by its close relative, &quot;B. arietans&quot;, which is normally found in more open country.

In Tanzania, this species is found in secondary thickets, cashew plantations, and agricultural land under bushes and in thickets. In Uganda, they are found in forests and nearby grasslands. They also do well in reclaimed forest areas - cacao plantations in West Africa and coffee plantations in East Africa. They have been found in evergreen forests in Zambia. In Zimbabwe, they only occur in areas of high rainfall along the forested escarpment in the east of the country. In general, they may also be found in swamps, as well as in still and moving waters. They are commonly found in agricultural areas near forests and on roads at night.

==Behavior==

Primarily nocturnal, Gaboon vipers have a reputation for being slow-moving and placid. They usually hunt by ambush, often spending long periods motionless, waiting for suitable prey to pass by, though they have been known to hunt actively, mostly during the first six hours of the night. In Kumasi, Ghana, they were regularly killed by ranch hands around some stables in an open field with the forest some 500 meters away—a sign that they were hunting rats in the grassland. They are usually very tolerant snakes, even when handled, and rarely bite or hiss, unlike most vipers. However, bites by bad-tempered individuals do occur.

Locomotion is mostly rectilinear, in a sluggish &quot;walking&quot; motion of the ventral scales. They may writhe from side to side when alarmed, but only for short distances. Ditmars (1933) even described them as being capable of sidewinding.

If threatened, Gaboon vipers may hiss loudly as a warning, doing so in a deep and steady rhythm, slightly flattening the head at the expiration of each breath. Despite this, they are unlikely to strike unless severely provoked; however, they are one of the fastest-striking snakes in the world, so care should be taken in handling them. It is best to avoid handling them in most circumstances.

Numerous descriptions have been given of their generally unaggressive nature. Sweeney (1961) wrote they are so docile that they &quot;can be handled as freely as any nonvenomous species,&quot; although this is absolutely not recommended. In Lane (1963), Ionides explained he would capture specimens by first touching them lightly on the top of the head with a pair of tongs to test their reactions. Hissing and anger were rarely displayed, so the tongs were usually set aside and the snakes firmly grasped by the neck with one hand and the body supported with the other as he picked them up and carried them to a box for containment. He said the snakes hardly ever struggled.

Parry (1975) described how this species has a wider range of eye movement than other snakes. Along a horizontal plane, eye movement can be maintained even if the head is rotated up or down to an angle of up to 45°. If the head is rotated 360°, one eye will tilt up and the other down, depending on the direction of rotation. Also, if one eye looks forward, the other looks back, as if both are connected to a fixed position on an axis between them. In general, the eyes often flick back and forth in a rapid and jerky manner. When asleep, no eye movement occurs and the pupils are strongly contracted. The pupils dilate suddenly and eye movement resumes when the animal awakens.

==Feeding==
Because of their large, heavy body size, the adults have no trouble eating prey as large as fully grown rabbits. When prey happens by, they strike from any angle. They can quickly reposition their fangs if they happen to miss or strike an unsuitable area of their prey. Once they strike their prey, they hang on to it with their large fangs rather than letting it go and waiting for it to die. This behaviour is very different from that of other species of vipers. These snakes feed on a variety of amphibians, mammals, and birds such as doves, guineafowl, and francolins. They also hunt many different species of rodent, including field mice and rats, as well as hares and rabbits. More unlikely prey items, such as tree monkeys, the Gambian pouched rat, the brush-tailed porcupine, and even the small royal antelope have been reported.

==Reproduction==
During peak sexual activity, males engage in combat. This starts with one male rubbing his chin along the back of the other. The second male then raises his head as high as possible. As they both do the same, their necks intertwine. When the heads are level, they turn towards each other and push. Their bodies intertwine as they switch positions. They become oblivious to everything else, continuing even after they fall off a surface or into water. Sometimes, they intertwine and squeeze so tightly that their scales stand out from the pressure. They have also been observed to strike at each other with mouths closed. Occasionally, the combatants tire and break off the fight by &quot;mutual consent&quot;, resting for a while before resuming once more. The event is settled when one of the two succeeds in pushing the other&#x27;s head to the ground and raising his own by 20–30 cm. In captivity, combat may occur four or five times a week until courtship and copulation end. Females can have 50 to 60 babies at a time. The young are born live.

==Venom==
Bites from this species are extremely rare because these snakes are seldom aggressive and their range is mostly confined to rainforest areas. Since they are sluggish and unwilling to move even when approached, the humans they bite are usually those accidentally stepping on them. However, not all of the cases of persons stepping on this species of snake results in the person getting bitten. When a bite does occur, it should always be considered a serious medical emergency. Even an average bite from an average-sized specimen is potentially fatal. Antivenom should be administered as soon as possible to save the affected limb or indeed the victim&#x27;s life.

The snake&#x27;s venom is cytotoxic and cardiotoxic. In mice, the is 0.8–5.0 mg/kg intravenously, 2.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally, and 5.0–6.0 mg/kg subcutaneously. Since their venom glands are enormous, each bite produces the second-largest quantity of venom of any venomous snake; this is partially because, unlike many African vipers, such as the puff adder, the Gaboon viper does not release after a bite, which enables it to inject larger amounts of venom. Yield is probably related to body weight, as opposed to milking interval. Brown (1973) gives a venom yield range of 200–1000 mg (of dried venom). A range of 200–600 mg for specimens 125–155 cm in length has also been reported. Spawls and Branch (1995) state from 5 to 7 mL (450–600 mg) of venom may be injected in a single bite.

A study by Marsh and Whaler (1984) reported a maximum yield of 9.7 mL of wet venom, which translated to 2400 mg of dried venom. They attached &quot;alligator&quot; clip electrodes to the angle of the open jaw of anesthetized specimens (length 133–136 cm, girth 23–25 cm, weight 1.3–3.4 kg), yielding 1.3–7.6 mL (mean 4.4 mL) of venom. Two to three electrical bursts, five seconds apart, were enough to empty the venom glands. The Gaboon vipers used for the study were milked between seven and 11 times over a 12-month period, during which they remained in good health and the potency of their venom remained the same.

From how sensitive monkeys were to the venom, Whaler (1971) estimated 14 mg of venom would be enough to kill a human being, equivalent to 0.06 mL of venom, or 1/50 to 1/1000 of what can be obtained in a single milking. Marsh and Whaler (1984) wrote that 35 mg (1/30 of the average venom yield) would be enough to kill a man of . Branch (1992) suggested that 90–100 mg would be fatal in humans. 

In humans, a bite from a Gaboon viper causes rapid and conspicuous swelling, intense pain, severe shock, and local blistering. Other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements, defecation, urination, swelling of the tongue and eyelids, convulsions, and unconsciousness. Blistering, bruising, and necrosis may be extensive. Sudden hypotension, heart damage, and dyspnoea may occur. The blood may become incoagulable, with internal bleeding that may lead to haematuria and haematemesis. Local tissue damage may require surgical excision and possibly amputation to any affected limb. Healing may be slow and fatalities during the recovery period are not uncommon.

<text>MRV Communications was a telecommunications company based in Chatsworth, California. MRV Communications was acquired by ADVA Optical Networking on August 14, 2017 for a reported $69 million.

==History==
MRV was founded in 1988 by Shlomo Margalit and Zeev Rav-Noy as a maker of Metro and Access optoelectronic components. MRV also established the subsidiary LuminentOIC, who makes fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) components.

=== Product development ===
In the 1990s, MRV produced Ethernet switching and Optical Transport for Metro and campus environments. MRV began building switches and routers used by carriers implementing Metro Ethernet networks that provide Ethernet services to enterprise customers and multi-dwelling residential buildings.

In 1999, MRV was named as the prime vendor to deploy the world’s first Metro Ethernet national network in Swedish Telecom. That same year the company introduced a Linux-based IP router based on network processor technology.

The company introduced the industry&#x27;s first Packet-Optical platform with integrated IP/MPLS/Ethernet and WDM technologies in 2005, and got MEF CE 1.0 certification.

In 2008, they introduced the industry&#x27;s first purpose-built 10GE demarcation device for Carrier Ethernet Access services.

In 2009, MRV Technologies deployed OptiSwitch Ethernet demarcation in the industry’s first 4G LTE commercial Mobile Backhaul network and introduced one of the lowest-latency optical products (Fiber Driver) for High-Frequency Trading.

In 2010, the company introduced industry first Physical layer 10G switch for the lab automation market.

The company was among the first vendors in the industry to pass MEF CE 2.0 certification in 2012.

In 2014, they introduced a new flagship next-generation WDM metro product line, the OptiDriver series and in 2015 introduced the industry’s first 100G purpose-built CE 2.0 NID, OptiPacket.

In 2015, the company introduced the industry&#x27;s first 100G purpose-built CE 2.0 NID, OptiPacket.

=== Acquisitions and investments ===
In 1992, MRV acquired Galcom Networking, a company based in Tel Aviv, Israel.

MRV Communications acquired Fibronics International from Elbit Ltd. in 1996. A year later, the company acquired Interdata, a French-based system integrator specializing in optical networks, architecture, and network security for operators, enterprises, and large jurisdictions. 

In 1998, the company paid $35 million for Xyplex Networks. This acquisition enhanced the development of remote management and IP routing functionality for WAN services and added distribution channels in the United States and Europe.

In 2001, the company acquired Alcadon AB, a Nordic-based system integrator of passive and active optical networking infrastructure. 

In 2010, the company announced the sale of Source Photonics, Inc. to Francisco Partners. MRV Technologies sold Alcadon AB, a Nordic-based system integrator of passive and active optical networking infrastructure, to Deltaco AB in 2012.

<doc id="1210466" wikidata="Q503398" url="?curid=1210466" title="HMS Greyhound (H05)">
<text>HMS &quot;Greyhound&quot; was a G-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the 1930s. &quot;Greyhound&quot; participated in the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940, the Dunkirk evacuation in May and the Battle of Dakar in September before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in November. The ship generally escorted the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they protected convoys against attacks from the Italian Fleet. She sank two Italian submarines while escorting convoys herself in early 1941. &quot;Greyhound&quot; was sunk by German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers north-west of Crete on 22 May 1941 as she escorted the battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet attempting to intercept the German sea-borne invasion forces destined for Crete.

==Description==
&quot;Greyhound&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Greyhound&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime, but increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft defence &quot;Greyhound&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

==Service==
&quot;Greyhound&quot; was laid down by Vickers Armstrong Naval Construction Works at Barrow-in-Furness on 20 September 1934, launched on 15 August 1935 and completed on 31 January 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £248,768. Aside from a brief period when she was assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla after her commissioning, &quot;Greyhound&quot; spent the prewar period assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet. On 17 November 1937, &quot;Greyhound&quot; and sister ships and were ordered from their anchorage at Mudros to search for the British steamship &quot;African Mariner&quot;, which was suspected of smuggling war material to Spain. After &quot;African Mariner&quot; was located by an aircraft launched from the battlecruiser , &quot;Greyhound&quot; intercepted the merchant ship and put a boarding party onboard &quot;African Mariner&quot;, and took the steamship into Malta. After a ten day search, &quot;African Mariner&quot; was allowed to continue her journey from Odessa and Novorossisk to Barcelona. She was refitted at Portsmouth Dockyard between 7 June and 23 July 1938 and escorted the ocean liner SS &quot;Strathnaver&quot; between Malta and Alexandria during the Munich Crisis in September 1938. She then escorted the light cruiser on her voyage to Aden. On 25 January 1939, &quot;Greyhound&quot; evacuated employees of the British Embassy and their families from Republican-held Barcelona, as the city was threatened with imminent capture by Nationalist forces during the closing stages of the Spanish Civil War. The destroyer was narrowly missed by bombs during the evacuation. The city would fall the next day.

&quot;Greyhound&quot; and her entire flotilla were transferred to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October. On 12 November 1939 she collided with her sister ship, en route to Harwich, and her new assignment with the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, but she was only slightly damaged, and her repairs were completed two days later. The ship rescued survivors on 18 November from the ocean liner SS &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot;, which had struck a mine, and from SS &quot;Torchbearer&quot; the following day. &quot;Greyhound&quot; began escorting coastal convoys on 5 December when she was transferred back to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. On 14 January she captured the German blockade runner &quot;Phaedra&quot; in the North Sea. The ship was refitted between 16 February and 18 March 1940 and later reassigned to the Home Fleet.

On 5 April &quot;Greyhound&quot; escorted the battlecruiser as she covered the minelayers preparing to implement Operation Wilfred, an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany. The ship was present during, but played no part in, &quot;Renown&quot;″s brief engagement with the German battleships and on 9 April. &quot;Greyhound&quot; remained in the Vestfjord when the five ships of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla sailed into the Ofotfjord on 10 April to engage the German ships that had transported the invasion force to Narvik. She covered the withdrawal of the three surviving destroyers later that day. The ship was damaged by German bombers at Scapa Flow on 18 April and was repaired at Gravesend, Kent, between 22 April and 19 May.

During the Siege of Calais, &quot;Greyhound&quot; and her sister provided naval gunfire support for the 30th Motor Brigade on 25 and 26 May. On 28 and 29 May she evacuated 1,360 men from Dunkirk before she was damaged by German bombers. The ship was towed out of the harbour by the Polish destroyer . After her repairs were completed at Chatham Dockyard on 17 June, &quot;Greyhound&quot; rejoined her flotilla at Dover. On 30 July the ship, and her sister , escorted the aircraft carrier to Gibraltar and &quot;Greyhound&quot; was assigned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla based there. The ship participated in Operations Hats at the end of August when the British reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet.

During the Battle of Dakar on 23 September, &quot;Greyhound&quot;, the destroyer , and the Australian heavy cruiser engaged the Vichy French destroyer which was set on fire and forced to beach itself. The ship escorted the battleship and the cruisers and during Operation Coat in early November as they joined the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Greyhound&quot; herself was transferred to the 14th Destroyer Flotilla in Alexandria. She participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November during Operation Collar.

&quot;Greyhound&quot; participated in Operation Excess in January 1941 and then sank the on 19 January while escorting a convoy to Piraeus. In late January, the ship, and the destroyers , , and , escorted the badly damaged aircraft carrier from Malta to Alexandria. &quot;Greyhound&quot; sank the on 6 March as she attempted to attack Convoy GA.8 which was carrying British troops to Greece. The ship escorted the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet during the Battle of Cape Matapan on 28/29 March and initiated the night action when her searchlight illuminated an Italian cruiser. &quot;Greyhound&quot; and her sister, , attacked some of the Italian destroyers, but lost them when they passed through their own smokescreen. She sank the Italian sailing ship &quot;Romagna&quot; on 17 April off Apollonia, Cyrenaica as she was conducting an anti-shipping sweep off the North African coast with the Australian destroyer . The ship escorted the heavy units of the Mediterranean Fleet on 6 May as they provided cover for Operation Tiger, a convoy carrying reinforcements to Egypt. During the invasion of Crete, &quot;Greyhound&quot; escorted the battleship west of Crete on 22 May as she covered the cruiser forces attempting to sink the German invasion convoys. The ships were en route to rendezvous with the cruisers in the Kythira Strait when she was struck by three bombs dropped by Stukas of StG 2 and sank a few minutes afterwards. Her survivors were rescued by the destroyers and , but six officers and 74 sailors were killed in the attack. The Germans later rescued four more sailors.

<doc id="1210483" wikidata="Q204381" url="?curid=1210483" title="Goma">
<text>Goma is a city in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is the capital and largest city of the North Kivu Province, and is located on the northern shore of Lake Kivu and shares borders with the Bukumu Chiefdom to the north, Rwanda to the east and the Masisi Territory to the west. The city lies in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift, and is only south of the active volcano Mount Nyiragongo. With an approximate area of , the city has a population of 782,000 people in 2024,
with an additional 500,000 displaced people.

Goma is administratively divided into two urban municipalities: Goma and Karisimbi, which are further subdivided into 18 quarters, colloquially recognized as &quot;neighborhoods&quot; in the English lexicon. The city is home to several notable landmarks, including Goma International Airport, the UNESCO World Heritage Site Virunga National Park, the private Christian co-educational school Adventist University of Goma, the University of Goma, and is also surrounded by the active Virunga volcanic range, which includes volcanoes Nyamulagira, Nyiragongo, Mikeno, Visoke, Gahinga, Karisimbi, and Sabinyo. Goma also hosts the annual Amani Festival, the Free University of the Great Lakes Countries, which supports local development initiatives, as well as the regional cultural center and art school, Foyer Culturel de Goma.

The recent history of Goma has been dominated by the volcano and the Rwandan genocide of 1994, which in turn fueled the First and Second Congo Wars. The aftermath of these events was still having effects on the city and its surroundings in 2010. The city was captured by rebels of the March 23 Movement during the M23 rebellion in late 2012, and then retaken by Congolese government forces. , the city is once again under the control of M23, following a fresh offensive by the group that culminated in the Battle of Goma.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Goma&quot; derived from a modification of , the city&#x27;s former designation, a term of profound cultural and linguistic relevance among Bantu-speaking communities throughout Central, Southern, and East Africa. is translated as &quot;drum&quot;, and is commonly associated with ritual dances and ceremonies in these regions. This etymological link is believed to allude to the resonant, drum-like sounds emitted during a volcanic eruption that altered the area&#x27;s historical topography. The eruption led to the destruction of the original village, prompting its inhabitants to disperse and establish three new villages: &quot;Ngoma&quot;, which evolved into modern Goma; &quot;Matcha&quot;, contemporary Sake; and &quot;Munti&quot;, which is now known as Munigi &quot;groupement&quot; of Bukumu Chiefdom.

Residents of Goma are sometimes referred to as &quot;Gomatraciens&quot;, though this term is seldom used locally. The suffix &quot;-tracien&quot; has scientific connotation classifications, often associated with the taxonomy of animal species, particularly amphibians, which has led to its perception as artificial and unsuitable for describing human inhabitants. Instead, the term &quot;Goméen&quot; is favored for its more humanistic and natural connotation.

== Geography ==

Goma is the largest and capital city of the North Kivu Province in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
To Goma&#x27;s north lies Nyiragongo Territory, the Republic of Rwanda to the east, Lake Kivu to the south, and Masisi Territory to the west. Goma is strategically located on the Goma plain, which is composed of volcanic lavas and gradual slopes gently towards Lake Kivu. The plain is also bordered by the Virunga Mountains to the west, which comprises prominent peaks such as Nyamuragira, Mount Nyiragongo, Mount Mikeno, Mount Bisoke, Mount Gahinga, Mount Karisimbi and Mount Sabyinyo. Elevations in the northern part of the plain range from , with the volcanic fields of Nyamuragira and Nyiragongo exhibiting continuous carbon dioxide degassing. Nyiragongo, in particular, has been active since the early 1900s, featuring an active lava lake and periodic eruptions, including notable events in 1977, 2002, and 2021.

The predominant terrain of Goma is volcanic, with only a small portion consisting of slightly sandy soil. The surface is covered with basalt flows, creating a skeletal soil profile. Hills such as Mount Goma, Mount Ndosho, Mount Mugunga, and Mount Busara punctuate the landscape, although some areas are relatively flat. Mount Goma, an extinct volcano, lies at the public port of Goma. This hill was formed during ancient volcanic eruptions and marks the southeastern limit of the plain.

The vegetation in Goma is predominantly savannah interspersed with bushes. The city&#x27;s aesthetic appeal is further enhanced by artificial greenery, including trees planted by landowners, which mitigates temperature fluctuations. Hydrographically, Goma benefits from its southern proximity to Lake Kivu and smaller lakes such as Green Lake in Mugunga and Black Lake in Buhimba to the west.

=== Climate ===
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Goma&#x27;s climate as a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;). Goma is much milder than most climates of its latitude due to the city&#x27;s high altitude, and sees warm days and pleasant nights year-round.

=== Administrative division ===
Goma spreads over an approximate area of and has an estimated population of nearly 2 million people according to the 2022 census. In 1984, its population was estimated at 80,000. The city is administratively divided into two urban municipalities: Goma and Karisimbi, which are further subdivided into 18 quarters, colloquially recognized as &quot;neighborhoods&quot; in the English lexicon. This division was officially institutionalized through Ordinance Law No. 48-127 on 22 May 1989, which formalized the city&#x27;s communes (municipalities) and &quot;quartiers&quot; (quarters). Each neighborhood is further subdivided into smaller administrative units, including avenues, cells, and a local governance model called Nyumba Kumi (ten houses). Introduced in 1997 by the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), the Nyumba Kumi system is akin to a similar administrative framework in Rwanda. The Nyumba Kumi structure is managed by appointed individuals under the authority of the neighborhood chief, who supervises ten households.

The administrative leadership is centralized under a mayor, who is assisted by a deputy mayor. The deputy mayor is responsible for overseeing the mayors of each commune, who, in turn, manage the neighborhood heads. While the communes and the city are decentralized entities with legal personality and administrative autonomy, the neighborhoods are categorized as administrative units without independent legal status or personality.
In response to concerns related to population density, administrative adjustments were made that resulted in the creation of new &quot;quartiers&quot;. For instance, Katoyi &quot;quartier&quot; was divided into Kasika and Katoyi &quot;quartiers&quot;, while Mabanga &quot;quartier&quot; was divided into Mabanga North and Mabanga South &quot;quartiers&quot;. Parenthetically, the provincial authorities granted permission for the establishment of a new &quot;quartier&quot;, Bujovu, within the commune of Karisimbi, comprising cells from the Majengo and Virunga &quot;quartiers&quot;, namely Byahi and Tyazo cells.

==History==

The village of Ngoma was a port for lake traffic and a crossroads for the overland trade routes between Central Africa and the Indian Ocean. In 1894, the explorer Gustav Adolf von Götzen, following the footsteps of an earlier missionary, was traveling to Rwanda from the eastern coast of Africa and passed through the village, which he recorded as Goma. In 1906, officers of the Congo Free State established Goma post opposite Gisenyi as a military outpost to oversee maritime activities on Lake Kivu, which later transformed into a civil status office. Around 1930, the Goma precinct accommodated camps for laborers of the Eastern Railway (CFE), initially sited along Lake Kivu&#x27;s eastern shores. By the mid-20th century, Goma had become an essential hub, serving as the endpoint of the Vici Congo road network and a port for the transshipment of agricultural commodities and building materials to and from Bukavu. In 1945, Goma burgeoned into a state post under Rutshuru Territory&#x27;s jurisdiction, experiencing a rapid demographic upsurge with approximately 8,600 inhabitants. Goma&#x27;s prominence as a city grew steadily, earning it the status of an extra-customary center that year. Educational infrastructure developed in tandem, with institutions such as the &quot;École Royale&quot; (now the Goma Institute or INSTIGO) and the École Primaire d&#x27;Application de l&#x27;institut de Goma (EPAIGO) catering to European settlers. Meanwhile, the native population relied on the Saint André School, later renamed Keshero Primary School, for primary education. 

The inception of urbanization in Belgian Congo was formalized with the promulgation of a decree on 21 February 1949, which instituted entities responsible for evaluating and issuing building permits, overseeing demolitions, modifying land plots, and making changes to the urban landscape. In 1951, Goma was elevated to the territorial and capital level of North Kivu, reflecting its economic importance and the influx of settlers during the late 1940s and early 1950s. This period also witnessed movements advocating for administrative separation between Goma and Rutshuru, leading to the establishment of deliberative and executive bodies in Kirotshe and later in Sake.

The urban sprawl of Goma adhered to the archetypal colonial planning paradigm with the demarcation of separate neighborhoods for Europeans (&quot;cité Européenne&quot;) and indigenous Congolese (&quot;cité indigène&quot;). The latter was limited to contemporary Birere, a densely populated neighborhood abutting the Rwandan border. Meanwhile, the neighborhoods allocated for European settlers were concentrated within the contemporary city center (&quot;quartier les Volcans&quot;) and an enclave of the Himbi neighborhood, which persists as the most urbanized, affluent, and wealthy parts of the city.

On 25 December 1966, North Kivu regained its district status before becoming a region following the constitutional referendum of June 1967. By 10 July 1988, North Kivu attained its regional autonomy, promulgating its status as a sovereign entity within the tripartite division of the Kivu region into provinces: North Kivu, South Kivu, and Maniema. A decree issued on 14 September 1988, outlined critical urban development guidelines, such as construction alignments, the delineation of housing plans and communication routes, and the segregation of sustainable residential districts from native-dominated huts. This marked the onset of a segregationist urban paradigm, in which Congolese cities became characterized by a dichotomy between modern urban centers and native settlements, resulting in the coexistence of two disparate forms of urban development. As a result of Goma&#x27;s burgeoning urbanization, the city was officially designated as the provincial capital of the newly established North Kivu Province under Ordinance Law No. 88-178, issued on 15 November 1988.

===1994 Hutu refugee crisis===

The 1994 Rwandan genocide was executed by the interim Rwandan government against the Tutsi population and Hutu moderates. In response, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), formed by Tutsi refugees from Uganda, who already held control over significant portions of northern Rwanda after their invasion in 1990 and the ongoing Civil War, overthrew the Hutu government in Kigali, forcing them out. Over two million Hutus fled the country to Zaire and many Tutsis and Hutus were internally displaced within Rwanda. Although Hutu extremists were responsible for the mass killing of Tutsis, scholars like Judi Rever and Filip Reyntjens argue that the main perpetrators of the slaughter were the Tutsi-dominated RPF, led by Paul Kagame. According to Judi Rever, Kagame personally commanded massacres at places like Byumba soccer stadium in northern Rwanda and ordered the pursuit of Hutus in the Zairean forests. They devised ways to dispose of large numbers of bodies by &quot;dissolving them in acid, dumping them in rivers and swamps, or burning them, and established open air crematorium&quot;. Various UN missions attempted to establish safe zones and facilitate the movement of refugees. Between 13 June and 14 July 1994, an overwhelming number of refugees, ranging from 10,000 to 12,000 per day, fled across the border to Goma, resulting in a severe humanitarian crisis, as there was an acute lack of shelter, food and water. However, the Zairean government took it upon itself to garner attention for the situation. Shortly after the arrival of nearly one million refugees, a deadly cholera outbreak swept through the Hutu refugee camps near Goma, claiming thousands of lives. RPF-aligned forces, which had fought in the conflict, crossed the border to Zaire and in acts of revenge also claimed several lives
=== First Congo War ===
As early as mid-1996, infiltrated units from Rwanda began targeting Hutu refugee camps along the Rutshuru road, even before formal hostilities began. On the evening of 27 June 1996, an infiltrated group allegedly carried out an attack on the Kibumba refugee camp, resulting in casualties among Hutu refugees, soldiers from the &quot;Contingent Zaïrois pour la sécurité des camps&quot; (CZSC), and Red Cross personnel.

During the First Congo War, from mid-October 1996, Rwandan infiltrations intensified, accompanied by sporadic attacks on refugee camps along the Goma to Rutshuru road by the newly formed Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), a rebel movement led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, and Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) led by Paul Kagame, who aimed to overthrow Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s regime, accusing him of excluding Tutsis from governance and failing to stop the génocidaires. However, the United Nations Security Council noted that both the RPA and AFDL pillaged Zaire&#x27;s minerals for nearly two and a half decades and conducted massacres throughout the conflict. The Kibumba camp, situated twenty-five kilometers north of Goma, was the first to fall under assault. On the night of 25–26 October 1996, AFDL and RPA soldiers bombarded the Kibumba camp, resulting in casualties among Hutu refugees and the destruction of the camp&#x27;s hospital. Subsequently, approximately 194,000 refugees fled Kibumba towards the Mugunga camp. The Katale camp also faced attacks on the same night, but Forces Armées Zaïroises (FAZ)/CZSC soldiers and ex-FAR/Interahamwe units repelled the assailants initially. However, on 26 October 1996, AFDL and RPA forces attacked the Katale camp, resulting in numerous Hutu refugee casualties and the death of a Zairian soldier. They also allegedly killed several Hutu refugees using bladed weapons. Following confrontations with FAZ soldiers and ex-FAR/Interahamwe units from the Katale camp, who offered reinforcement, AFDL and RPA forces seized control of the FAZ military camp at Rumangabo.

By 30 October, refugees from Katale and Kahindo camps began to depart, with some heading towards Masisi via Tongo &quot;groupement&quot; of Bwito Chiefdom, while others attempted to reach the Mugunga camp through the Virunga National Park. However, AFDL and RPA troops had blocked the road to Goma, complicating the refugees&#x27; escape routes. On 31 October 1996, AFDL and RPA soldiers allegedly massacred hundreds of Hutu refugees who remained in the Kahindo and Katale camps. Roberto Garretón, the Special Rapporteur on the violation of human rights in Zaire, estimated the casualties and highlighted the brutality inflicted on the refugees.

In the aftermath of AFDL/RPA offensives in North Kivu, some refugees opted to return to Rwanda, though their numbers remained small. UNHCR reported approximately 900 Hutu refugees returning to Rwanda between 26 October and 31 October 1996. The reluctance of many refugees to return stemmed from both physical and psychological pressures, including fear of reprisals from AFDL/RPA soldiers. There were reports of AFDL/RPA soldiers killing refugees who expressed a desire to return to Rwanda. Determining the exact number of refugees killed by AFDL/RPA soldiers in attacks along the Goma to Rutshuru road was challenging. However, local NGOs involved in burial operations provided insights into the scale of the atrocities. The United Nations Mapping Report team documented numerous alleged incidents, including mass burials and killings in and around refugee camps between November 1996 and April 1997. The violence extended beyond the dismantling of refugee camps; Hutu survivors faced persecution while attempting to flee. In November 1996, AFDL/RPA soldiers reportedly targeted Hutu survivors from Kahindo and Katale camps, executing adult males. These survivors, along with others who resettled in makeshift camps, were subjected to further attacks in the Virunga National Park, resulting in additional casualties. The atrocities persisted for several months, with killings reported well into 1997. Witness testimonies highlighted the grim reality faced by refugees, with bodies discovered daily in former camp sites. On 11 April 1997, AFDL/RPA soldiers allegedly massacred hundreds of refugees near Kibumba village. These refugees, intercepted while attempting to return to Rwanda, were detained and subsequently killed by AFDL/RPA forces.

By the end of 1997, AFDL rebels advanced to Kinshasa, driving out Mobutu and leading to Laurent-Désiré Kabila proclaiming himself president on 17 May, renaming the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

=== Second Congo War ===

Within a year of assuming power, Laurent-Désiré Kabila found himself in conflict with his former allies, and in 1998, the Rwandan government threw its support behind a Goma-based rebel movement known as the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), occasionally denoted as RCD-Goma. The Goma refugee encampments, where Hutu refugees and Interahamwe militants had forged a militia known as the Democratic Force for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), morphed into battlegrounds as Rwandan government forces and the RCD clashed with them to assert dominion.

On 2 August 1998, General Sylvain Buki announced via &quot;Radio-Télévision Nationale Congolaise&quot; (RTNC) in Goma that a rebellion had erupted within the Congolese Armed Forces (FAC). The 10th Brigade of the FAC mutinied, leading to the swift capture of Goma by the RCD and Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), with minimal resistance. Goma remained beyond the reach of the Kinshasa government&#x27;s forces for nearly three years, save for sporadic barrage. Amidst these conflicts, the RCD&#x27;s bias towards the local Tutsi community, Rwandan interference in provincial affairs, and the brutality of RCD and RPA troops towards civilians in North Kivu prompted many locals to join Mayi–Mayi armed groups to defend their communities. The Mayi–Mayi militias utilized forested areas and national parks as bases for launching attacks against RCD and RPA forces.

With support from Kinshasa, the Mayi–Mayi and ALiR intensified ambushes and pillaging against RCD/RPA soldiers and civilian populations. Consequently, RCD/RPA control was limited to certain urban areas. In response, they increased search operations in various regions. The Second Congo War was unprecedented in Africa for the loss of civilian life in massacres and atrocities. By 2003, the Rwandan Banyamulenge-supported insurgent factions wearied of the conflict, and discord surfaced between them and Rwanda. In 2002 and 2003, a tenuous negotiated peace ensued among the myriad factions embroiled in the conflict.

===Ongoing conflict ===

Since the conclusion of the Second Congo War, Goma has been plagued by conflict despite the peace agreements of 2002. In 2006, it became a focal point for the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s 81st and 83rd Brigades, who remained faithful to Congolese Tutsi military defector Laurent Nkunda, who accused the government of neglecting to assimilate his military faction into the national army and failing to safeguard their interests. Numerous heinous crimes were committed by Nkunda during his reign of terror. In 2002, he sanctioned the massacre of over 150 people in Kisangani. In Bukavu in 2004, his insurgent affiliates, in conjunction with Colonel Jules Mutebutsi, executed widespread atrocities, including sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, predominantly targeting young girls. Human Rights Watch clamored for Nkunda&#x27;s arrest in February 2006, but it wasn&#x27;t until June of that year that his military faction made significant territorial gains, capturing localities like Bunagana, located 80 km from Goma.

Despite intermittent losses and counteroffensives by FARDC&#x27;s 9th Integrated Brigade, Nkunda&#x27;s forces maintained control over certain areas like Bunagana and Runyoni. By November 2006, reports cited three fatalities and 41 injuries, among them civilians, and by December, the violence had displaced over 80,000 people, many of whom sought refuge on the outskirts of Goma. The conflict escalated further in early 2007, with Goma&#x27;s healthcare organization, Groupe d&#x27;Entraide et de Solidarité Médicale (GESOM), treating an average of three rape survivors daily from both urban and rural sectors. On 17 May, FARDC arrested 14 Rwandan nationals, including members of Nkunda&#x27;s brigade, as MONUSCO noted that his militia in North Kivu was wearing distinctive Rwandan military uniforms. Later in May, the French Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bernard Prévost, visited the Mugunga displacement camp near Sake and announced that France would allocate over €2.6 million to the World Food Programme to support displaced persons in the eastern DRC. In June 2007, William Lacy Swing, Director General of the International Organization for Migration, expressed profound concern about the escalating conflict, citing rising insecurity, ethnic discord, the swelling numbers of internally displaced persons, and an increase in human rights abuses in North Kivu. Toward the end of June, Rwandan combatants launched a deadly assault on Lake Kivu, resulting in the deaths of four people, including three fishermen and a Congolese naval officer. The attackers also looted valuable fishing equipment and an outboard motor. Initial negotiations with Rwandan officials regarding cross-border security on Lake Kivu ultimately facilitated the partial recovery of the stolen fishing assets in Rwanda.

On 6 September, MONUSCO brokered a ceasefire between the FARDC and forces loyal to Laurent Nkunda. However, the following day saw renewed clashes, with most of the population from Goma&#x27;s surrounding regions seeking shelter in the Mugunga, Lac-Vert, and Ndosho neighborhoods, as well as Goma Centre, fearing further confrontations between the FARDC and Nkunda&#x27;s forces. Fighting between Nkunda&#x27;s forces and the Mai-Mai community-based militia, Congolese Patriotic Resistance (PARECO), which claimed to protect its community from Nkunda&#x27;s forces, led to the deaths of 5 people in Bitonga in southern Masisi Territory. Nine deceased people were subsequently uncovered in three separate mass graves within Rubare, approximately 12 km from Rutshuru, north of Goma. Two other bodies were discovered in the administrative support post of Kisharo&#x27;s office, around 20 kilometers from Kiwanja, along the route to Nyamilima and Shasha, within Rutshuru Territory. On 27 October 2008, the Battle of Goma broke out in the city between the Congolese army, supported by MONUSCO, and Nkunda&#x27;s CNDP rebels; 200,000 refugees fled the town.

On 3 November 2012 there was a clash between Congolese and Rwandan troops on the border just north of Goma. Goma was later seized by the M23 Movement on 20 November 2012. During the M23&#x27;s brief rule, the city endured ten days of chaos, marked by looting and executions, bringing economic activities to a standstill and forcing residents into seclusion.

On 22 February 2021, the Italian ambassador, Luca Attanasio, was killed in an apparent kidnapping attempt near Virunga National Park. He was part of the U.N.&#x27;s World Food Programme (WFP). Two others were also killed.

As of March 2022, the clashes between the FARDC, the M23, and various armed groups in North Kivu have displaced over one million people. Among them, more than 600,000 have fled to overcrowded and unsanitary camps on the fringes of Goma. Gender-based violence has also soared in the region, resulting in the prevalence of a pervasive culture of impunity. Between 17–30 April 2023, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams treated 674 victims of sexual violence in camps like Bulengo, Lushagala, and Rusayo, with 360 cases reported solely from the latter, a recently established and densely inhabited settlement situated to the west of Goma. The vast majority of these victims were attacked while venturing outside the displaced sites in search of basic necessities like firewood and sustenance.

The M23&#x27;s offensive in early February 2024 around Sake, roughly twenty kilometers from Goma, exposed civilians to heavy fighting and forced more displacement towards Goma and previously settled sites or with host families on the Sake-Bweremana axis towards the province from South Kivu in the Kalehe Territory. This influx of displaced people strains already limited resources and infrastructure, making it increasingly challenging to meet the needs of affected communities. Some regional initiatives have addressed the crisis, with the deployment of Southern African Development Community (SADC) forces and summits between heads of state to relaunch the peace process and secure a ceasefire in the region.

On 12 February, South Africa announced it would send 2,900 troops as part of its contribution to the SADC force deployed to tackle armed groups in the eastern DRC. On 15 February, two South African soldiers were killed and three wounded by a mortar bomb launched by M23 rebels. The road to lasting peace remains fraught with challenges, including the need for direct dialogue between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.

As of January 2025, the city is once again the target of a renewed M23 offensive, which resulted in multiple casualties, injuries, looting, destruction of property, and mass displacement. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the fighting in Goma. On 27 January 2025, more than 4,000 prisoners escaped from Muzenze prison. It was reported that hundreds of female inmates were raped and burned alive during the mass jailbreak from Goma&#x27;s prison.

=== Sexual violence ===
Goma has been heavily affected by sexual violence, which is deeply intertwined with the ongoing regional conflicts, economic instability, and social challenges that have marked the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo for decades. Armed groups, local militias, and, at times, even some members of state forces have been implicated in sexual violence against civilians. Such violations are often weaponized as a deliberate tool of war to terrorize communities, assert control, and break down social cohesion. Survivors often face physical injuries, sexually transmitted infections, psychological trauma, and social stigma. A study from 2007 revealed that around 1.69–1.80 million women aged 15–29 in the DRC reported experiencing sexual assault at some point in their lives, with North Kivu recording 223,262 cases, the highest rate nationally. Further research in 2010 indicated that 39.7% of women in North and South Kivu had experienced sexual violence. In 2023, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported a sharp increase in sexual violence cases in the DRC, mainly concentrated in and around Goma. MSF treated 25,166 survivors nationwide, averaging more than two patients per hour. In the first five months of 2024 alone, MSF treated 17,363 survivors in North Kivu, representing 69% of the total cases treated across five provinces in the previous year.

==== Medical literature, demographics, and medical treatment ====

Despite substantial media coverage, sexual violence within the DRC remains insufficiently addressed in medical literature. A study conducted in Goma from 2013 to 2017 revealed that sexual violence disproportionately affected females below 18 years, with an average age of 16.5 years. Half of the perpetrators were known to the survivors; 12% of survivors tested positive for pregnancy, and 43% received emergency contraception.

In a separate study covering January 2019 to December 2020, Karisimbi municipality in Goma reported 551 cases of sexual violence, while the Goma municipality recorded 149 cases. The Majengo neighborhood in Karisimbi reported the highest frequency, with 129 cases. Among the survivors, women aged 20–29 represented 28.6%, with only 15.7% reporting incidents occurring within their homes, and 60.7% of incidents involved the use of weapons. Vaginal assault occurred in all cases, and other forms of assault, like touching, occurred in 7.2% of cases. Strangers constituted 64.7% of the perpetrators, and 61.4% of assailants were identified as members of military or police forces. Among survivors, 8.1% had a physical disability. Of the 700 survivors, only 16.1% sought medical consultation for genital injuries, and 0.7% presented with mutism. Approximately 60.6% sought medical care within 72 hours, with 8.1% testing positive for HIV. Of the survivors, 76.3% underwent pregnancy tests, 6.4% of which were positive. Additionally, 55.4% of survivors received contraception, and 91.1% were offered post-exposure prophylactic treatment for HIV.

=== Internally displaced populations ===

For over three decades, Goma has served as a major site for internally displaced persons (IDPs), predominantly due to the recurrent waves of violence and humanitarian emergencies besieging the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjacent regions. The displacement crisis commenced in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, during which approximately 1.2 million refugees, predominantly Hutus, entered eastern Congo, with between 500,000 and 850,000 people arriving in Goma over a span of five days in mid-July 1994. This mass migration was one of the largest cross-border movements in recent history, with many refugees establishing makeshift camps around Goma.

The late 1990s witnessed a surge in the IDP crisis amidst the First and Second Congo Wars, with hundreds of thousands fleeing escalating rural violence and relocating to Goma and its environs. By December 2006, estimates suggested at least 80,000 IDPs resided within and around the city, a figure that escalated to roughly 640,000 by September 2007 in camps dispersed across North Kivu. Another spike in displacement transpired between 2012 and 2013, correlating with the emergence of M23. During this period, more than 500,000 people sought refuge in Goma. From 2020 to 2022, intensifying conflicts in North Kivu led to the displacement of approximately 1.5 million people throughout the province, with a significant contingent finding asylum in Goma.

As of 13 February 2024, Goma hosts an estimated 1.7 million IDPs due to renewed conflicts between the Congolese military and various insurgent groups, including M23, with over 700,000 new arrivals recorded in late 2022 and early 2023 alone.

==== Cholera, dysentery outbreaks, and malnutrition ====

The initial influx of refugees in July 1994 saw an immediate health emergency, as overcrowded camps lacked clean water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. The first case of cholera was diagnosed on 20 July 1994, leading to a major outbreak within the camps that saw an estimated 58,000 to 80,000 cases in less than a month. Concurrently, an outbreak of bloody diarrhea caused by &quot;Shigella dysenteriae&quot; type 1 emerged in early August, persisting in the camps until November. These outbreaks contributed to unprecedented mortality rates during the first month of the emergency, with an estimated 50,000 deaths recorded between mid-July and mid-August.

The influx also led to severe food insecurity among IDPs, resulting in widespread malnutrition, particularly affecting children. Goma&#x27;s already fragile health infrastructure struggled to meet these needs, as ongoing conflict limited resources and disrupted supply chains. Many displaced families lacked access to sufficient food, and local health services were ill-equipped to address the scale of malnutrition.

Between January 2000 and December 2007, cholera remained a persistent threat in North and South Kivu, with 73,605 reported cases and 1,612 deaths, resulting in a lethality rate of 2.2%. In North Kivu, the cholera strains identified included &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; O1 El Tor Ogawa and Inaba, with the latter being exclusive to South Kivu. Annual cholera outbreaks peaked at over 700 cases per week, particularly affecting health districts bordering lakes. Despite the severity of these outbreaks, between January and April 2002, only 140 cholera cases were reported across Goma, with no fatalities—a significant deviation from the city&#x27;s typical average of 29 cases weekly for that period.

==== Mental health and nutritional challenges ====

In 2012, nearly 1 million children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were estimated to suffer from acute malnutrition, with North Kivu, where Goma is located, being particularly affected. Food shortages further hindered access to adequate nutrition for IDPs. Continuous exposure to violence and trauma led to pervasive mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with limited mental health support available in the region.

==== Recent health crises ====
From 2016 to 2022, recurring conflicts and subsequent displacements in Goma exacerbated the health crisis, with recurrent outbreaks of communicable diseases such as cholera, measles, and a resurgence of malaria. Overcrowded and unsanitary conditions within IDP camps facilitated the spread of these diseases, resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. The COVID-19 pandemic further intensified health challenges for IDPs, as healthcare systems became severely strained, limiting access to treatment and vaccination. IDPs were particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 outcomes due to overcrowded conditions and insufficient health resources.

=== Ebola epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic ===
==== Kivu Ebola epidemic ====
A pastor infected during the 2018–2020 Kivu Ebola epidemic in the region was found in mid-July 2019 to have travelled to Goma. In August 2019, Rwandan Health Minister Diane Gashumba announced that students in Rwanda would cease attending school in Goma due to the Ebola outbreak, which has claimed the lives of over 1,800 people within the past year.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====

The Democratic Republic of the Congo confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on 10 March 2020. Following this, the virus spread throughout the country, resulting in a cumulative total of over 56,086 cases and 1,068 deaths (1.9% lethality) as of 5 September 2021. Kinshasa reported the highest number of cases, followed by North Kivu, which constituted 10.4% (5,841 cases) of the national aggregate. Within Goma, the virus predominantly disseminated via community-based transmission.

In response, the DRC instituted stringent containment protocols to attenuate the ramifications of COVID-19, in alignment with the directives of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the national Ministry of Public Health. These regulations encompassed the closure of educational institutions, places of worship, markets, and various public venues, coupled with prohibitions on large congregations, resulting in the cancellation of Goma&#x27;s annual Amani Festival in 2021. Despite these measures, Goma&#x27;s economy confronted considerable adversities, with the city encountering a pronounced inflation rate of 16.4% in 2020, juxtaposed with 4.6% in the preceding year. This inflationary pressure undermined household incomes and diminished overall quality of life. However, by July 2024, the DRC achieved a significant milestone, reporting no new COVID-19 cases.

==Volcanic activity ==
Due to the Great Rift Valley being pulled apart, the area experiences frequent earthquakes and the formation of new volcanoes. Over time, volcanic eruptions have directly impacted Goma, with significant lava flows destroying nearby villages, neighborhoods, and roads north of the city. The 1923 and 1997 eruptions caused significant damage and loss of life, with lava flows encroaching upon Lake Kivu&#x27;s shores and destroying sections of the city.

=== 2002 Nyiragongo volcano eruption ===

In January 2002, Nyiragongo erupted, sending a stream of lava to wide and up to two metres (6½ ft) deep through the center of the city as far as the lake shore. Agencies monitoring the volcano were able to give a warning and most of the population of Goma evacuated to Gisenyi. The lava destroyed 40% of the city (more than 4,500 houses and buildings). There were some fatalities caused by the lava and by emissions of carbon dioxide, which causes asphyxiation. The lava also covered over the northern 1 km of the runway of Goma International Airport, isolating the terminal and apron which were at that end. The lava can easily be seen in satellite photographs, and aircraft can be seen using the 2-km (6,500-ft) southern section of the runway which is clear of lava.

In March 2004, emissions from Nyiragongo volcano polluted the surrounding areas of North Kivu, including Rusayo, Bishusha, Birambizo, Tongo, Kitshanga, and Sake with water vapor () laden with fluorine and carbon dioxide ().

=== 2021 Nyiragongo volcano eruption ===
On 22 May 2021, Mount Nyiragongo erupted with lava flows closing a road and reaching the municipal airport. The Buhene neighborhood, located on the edge of Goma, was engulfed in flames, and more than 500 homes were covered in cooling lava. Parts of Virunga Energies&#x27;s electricity facilities, which supplied electricity to nearly 15,000 homes in the city, were destroyed. Thousands of people fled to nearby regions, with some boarding boats on Lake Kivu, which lies on the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. Around 5,000 people crossed the border into Rwanda, while another 25,000 went northwest towards Sake. The lava stopped flowing around 3 a.m. on 30 May 2021, and the Congolese government ordered the city&#x27;s evacuation plan to be set in motion. On the same day, residents returned to Goma to check on their homes. However, the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund reported that more than 170 children were still missing. The official report on the number of deaths is yet to be released, but the Minister of Communication and Media, Patrick Muyaya Katembwe, said at least 15 people died. Nine people died in a traffic collision, four died while trying to escape from the central prison of Munzenze, and two were calcined by lava.

=== 2023 Nyamulagira volcano eruption ===
On 9 May 2023, lava flows were seen inside the central crater of Nyamulagira volcano. By 17 May, a large glow above the volcano was visible, leading to lava flows in Virunga National Park. While the lava flows do not harm the population, the volcano emits large amounts of gas and fine particles. Thermal radiation over the crater increased sharply on 19 May, indicating an increase in the outpouring of lava, but the activity was still confined to the summit. Effusive eruption increased further on 20 May, forming two large lobes — one outside the caldera to the west and another to the south. Although not visible, satellite images on May 19 and 20 showed that the current eruption at the volcano was emitting enormous amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2).

===Threat posed by Lake Kivu===
Lake Kivu is one of three lakes in Africa identified as having huge quantities of dissolved gas held at pressure in its depths. The other two, Cameroon&#x27;s Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, experienced limnic eruptions or &quot;lake overturns&quot;, catastrophic releases of suffocating carbon dioxide probably triggered by landslides. Lake Nyos&#x27;s overturn in 1986 was particularly lethal, killing nearly two thousand people in the area around the lake. Kivu is 2,000 times bigger than Lake Nyos and also contains dissolved methane as an additional hazard – though concentration of carbon dioxide is much lower than in Lake Nyos. Nearly two million people, including the population of Goma, live in the vicinity of Lake Kivu and could be in danger from a limnic eruption triggered by one of the nearby volcanoes and the earthquakes associated with them.

The CO2-rich gas location, known locally as mazuku has recently caused the death of people and animals.

== Demographics ==
Goma has experienced rapid and sustained population growth over the past decades. Historically, the city&#x27;s population was relatively modest, estimated at just 80,000 in 1984. However, significant demographic shifts have occurred due to natural population growth, internal migration, and the influx of refugees from neighboring countries, particularly during periods of regional instability.

The city&#x27;s population dynamics were profoundly impacted by the Rwandan Genocide (1994), the First Congo War (1996–1997), and the Second Congo War (1998–2003), as well as ongoing regional tensions involving the Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group. These events led to large-scale rural-to-urban migration, with individuals and families seeking refuge from interethnic violence, political unrest, and economic instability in rural areas. This influx has contributed to both the expansion of Goma&#x27;s physical boundaries and the transformation of its social and economic structures.

As of 2024, the population of Goma is estimated at approximately 782,000. However, this figure remains a subject of debate, as alternative estimates suggest the city&#x27;s population may exceed two million, driven by unrecorded migration and other factors.

The city&#x27;s demographic composition consists predominantly of Bantu-speaking ethnic groups, including the Nande, Nyanga, Hunde, Hutu, Tembo, Shi, Kano, and Tutsi communities.

== Culture ==

Goma is home of the annual Festival Amani which celebrates peace; in 2020, it attracted an audience of 36,000.
Goma serves as the North Kivu&#x27;s cultural center and boasts a vibrant entertainment and performing arts scene that encompasses various media forms, including television productions, radio broadcasts, theatre, cinematic expressions, multimedia installations, and print publications. Like many cities in DRC, Goma is renowned for its lively music scene with popular genres such as soukous, Congolese rumba, ndombolo, and Jazz. Notable figures in Goma&#x27;s popular culture scene include Innoss&#x27;B, Jonathan Kuminga, Rebecca Kabugho, Anzor Alem, Petna Ndaliko Katondolo, Alicios Theluji, El Weezya Fantastikoh, Christophe Madihano, Patient Ligodi, Voldie Mapenzi, Mista Faba, Belamy Paluku, Willow Miller, and Vicky YM.

=== Entertainment and performing arts ===
During the 1970s, theatrical activities in Goma flourished, with well-organized theater troupes such as AMIKI (&quot;Amis du Kivu&quot;) with Kembo and Mazingi, CLB with Tshiaba, Kainos, and Robert De Souza, and Ngoma with Mpozayo Jean-Paul, among others. The shows were held at the city&#x27;s Ciné Palace hall. Additionally, the Goma Institute organized a school troupe under the leadership of the then-prefect Lumaya Ombwel, featuring talented student actors like Robert De Souza, also known as Kablan or Gilima, and Mwamba, alias Ringo. On 16 March 2013, Goma played host to the inaugural tshukudu race, a wooden bicycle race organized by the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) and Association of Volunteers of Congo (&quot;Association des Volontaires du Congo&quot;; ASVOCO), which aimed to provide opportunities for the region&#x27;s unemployed youth and promote peace, with the proceeds benefiting children in Kitchanga.

Goma is a hub of art and craftsmanship, with skilled artisans creating intricate wood carvings, pottery, textiles, and jewelry. The city is home to Petna Ndaliko Katondolo&#x27;s acclaimed multigenre film productions, which embrace a decolonial &quot;Ejo Lobi&quot; (Afro-futuristic) aesthetic that weaves together historical narratives to confront contemporary sociopolitical and cultural paradigms.

The Foyer Culturel de Goma is the city&#x27;s most significant cultural center, which plays a pivotal role in nurturing emerging talents, including musicians, poets, thespians, and visual artists, as well as fostering the proliferation and commercialization of indigenous culture and artistic expression within the North Kivu Province. The city also hosts the Amani Festival, a transcultural festival drawing participants from the African Great Lakes region along with international artists and representatives of different ethnic groups from the region. Goma also houses Yole! Africa, a youth cultural center promoting peace through art, music, dance, and film. The renowned spectacle &quot;Au Chemin des Urnes&quot;, hosted by the French Institute (IF) of Goma, celebrates the city&#x27;s poetic, musical, and rhythmic tapestry.

=== Infrastructure ===

Urbanization in Goma is in a state of progressive expansion, though the cityscape remains predominantly characterized by horizontal, low-rise structures. Concentrated largely around National Road 2, commercial activity is vigorous, with numerous bars, shops, &quot;Nganda&quot; (local eateries), and hotels lining this central corridor. Major commercial zones such as Supermatch, Nyiragongo Cement, and several key stations like Ihusi, IBB Service, AFRICOM, Ni Yetu, Tout Jeune, and GPI dominate the city&#x27;s urban landscape.

While low-rise architecture remains the prevailing style due to its affordability and practicality, multi-story buildings are beginning to emerge. Goma&#x27;s traditional wood board construction, popular due to its speed and cost-efficiency, is increasingly complemented by more durable vertical structures, which require significantly more extended construction periods due to the materials and techniques involved.

One of the most notable developments in Goma is the Birere neighborhood, also known as Mikeno. The area, located within the Goma commune, is recognized as the city&#x27;s oldest residential neighborhood. It is characterized by its multi-ethnic demographic and serves as a focal point for informal cross-border trade, housing numerous stores, warehouses, restaurants, and popular clubs known as &quot;&#x27;ngandas&quot;&#x27;. Birere occupies part of the &quot;zone tampon&quot;, the neutral buffer zone between DRC and Rwanda, and remains a key location for economic activity, despite numerous efforts to shift the city&#x27;s commercial heart to safer areas after the 2002 Nyiragongo volcanic eruption. The presence of the &quot;petite barrière&quot;, a pedestrian border crossing, facilitates the illicit trade of small goods and provides a source of income for many Congolese and Rwandans. 

=== Tourism ===
Goma is a popular tourist destination and offers a variety of attractions. Virunga National Park, located north of Goma, boasts more than 3,000 faunal and floral species. Tchegera Island is located southwest of Goma.

=== Cuisine ===

Cuisine in Goma reflects the region&#x27;s agricultural abundance and diverse influences. Staple foods include cassava, plantains, maize, and rice, often served alongside a variety of meats, fish, and vegetables. Local specialties such as &quot;bugali&quot; (a starchy dough), &quot;sambaza&quot; (small dried fish), and &quot;sombe&quot; (cassava leaves cooked in peanut sauce) are popular among both residents and visitors.

=== Mobile networks and media ===
Goma offers various cellular network services such as SuperCell, Airtel, Vodacom, Orange RDC (formerly &quot;Congo Chine Télécoms&quot;), and Tigo, which facilitate communication exchanges locally and internationally and play an integral role in business transactions, social interactions, and emergency services.

The city boasts a variety of Swahili, Lingala, and French language radio stations, including RTNC Goma, Radio Okapi, RSI (&quot;Radio Sauti&quot; &quot;ya Injili&quot;), Radio La Colombe, RTCT (&quot;Radio Télévision Communautaire Taina&quot;), RTC (&quot;Radio Télévision la Colombe&quot;), Kivu 1, Mishapi Voice TV, Mutaani, RSM (&quot;Radio Sauti&quot; &quot;ya Matumaini&quot;), VBR (Virunga Business Radio), Pool FM, RAO FM (Radio Alpha Omega), COMICO, Emmanuel TV, and Source de Vie, offering various news, entertainment, religious programming, and cultural content.

City&#x27;s radios are:
=== Sports ===
Association football is Goma&#x27;s most popular sport. Prominent football clubs in the city include AS Dauphins Noirs, which competes in Vodacom Ligue 1, the premier division of the Congolese Association Football Federation. Other significant clubs include Daring Club Virunga and Association Sportive Kabasha, both of which participate in Linafoot Ligue 2, an annual competition involving amateur football clubs across the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Matches for these clubs are predominantly held at Stade de l&#x27;Unité, the city&#x27;s primary football venue. Goma also has several other notable sports facilities, including Stade Mugunga, Stade des Volcans, and Stade Afia.

In addition to football, Goma is home to the Stade Paralympique de Goma, a dedicated basketball stadium that hosts national wheelchair basketball championships.

Boxing also plays a significant role in Goma&#x27;s sports culture, with the city hosting a variety of boxing events, including inter-regional boxing tournaments at the Higher Institute of Commerce of Goma (&quot;Institut supérieur de Commerce de Goma&quot;; ISC-Goma). In 2015, Goma served as the host city for an inter-regional boxing tournament organized by the brewing company Brasimba of Beni, which attracted both amateur and professional pugilists from Goma, Bukavu, Beni, Butembo, and Rwanda. On 30 June 2024, Goma hosted a Boxing Gala organized by the North Kivu Boxing League to commemorate the nation&#x27;s independence, featuring participants from North Kivu, South Kivu, and Maniema.

== Places of worship ==
Goma is home to several Christian churches and temples including the churches of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Goma, Kimbanguist Church, Baptist Community of Congo (World Baptist Alliance), the Baptist Community in the Center of Africa (World Baptist Alliance), Assemblies of God, Province of the Anglican Church of Congo (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Community in Congo (World Communion of Reformed Churches). There are also Muslim mosques.

== Economy ==

=== Agriculture ===
Goma&#x27;s economy relies mainly on agriculture, with a significant proportion of its population engaged in the trade of agricultural products. However, due to the instability of the local currency, economic transactions often involve foreign currencies. Primarily centered on the production of raw materials, including plant agriculture, fishing, hunting, and fish farming, these activities typically employ artisanal methods and antiquated production techniques. Agricultural products are primarily sourced from neighboring territories such as Masisi and Rutshuru, supplemented by the resources of Lake Kivu, which hosts thriving fish markets along its shores twice a week. Cultivation primarily focuses on garden crops and selected staples such as legumes, maize, and tubers, leveraging the fertile volcanic soil enriched by basaltic substrata. Nevertheless, the dense population necessitates diversification to ensure food security and foster interdependence with neighboring territories and countries for supplementary yields.

Historically, the colonial administration catalyzed economic development by introducing plantation agriculture in North Kivu&#x27;s fertile highlands, establishing the region as a critical &quot;food basket&quot; for the Belgian Congo. Legislative frameworks, including the Draft Decree and Royal Decree of 12 December 1939, laid the foundation for agricultural oversight. This initiative culminated in the establishment of OPAC (&quot;Office des Produits Agricoles de Costermansville&quot;) on 4 February 1948, subsequently renamed OPAK (&quot;Office des Produits Agricoles du Kivu&quot;; currently known as &quot;Office Nationale du Café&quot;, ONC). These agencies oversaw the production and export of cash crops such as &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; and pyrethrum. During this era, substantial quantities of cereals, tubers, meat, and palm oil were routed through Goma for redistribution to urban epicenters such as Kinshasa and Kisangani. The construction of a port in Keshero, later repositioned nearer to central Goma, augmented trade routes, integrating the city into a north-south economic corridor extending through Bunia, Rutshuru, Bukavu, Uvira, and Kalemie. While the colonial economy also invested in resource extraction, North Kivu&#x27;s mining sector remained underdeveloped relative to mineral-rich regions like Ituri and South Kivu. Consequently, Goma&#x27;s prominence as a mineral trading hub was relatively subdued until the 1980s. However, pre-existing cross-border trade routes connecting Goma to markets in Uganda and Rwanda persisted, providing the foundation for local commerce even after independence.

In the post-independence era, these historical trade networks gained significance as the local population increasingly relied on informal and transborder economic activities to circumvent the exploitative practices of the Zairean state. By the 1980s, a substantial portion of agricultural production, including papaya, tea, cinchona, and coffee, was smuggled or exported through informal channels, with Goma International Airport playing a key role in this clandestine commerce. Estimates from 1985–1986 suggest that up to 60% of local coffee production bypassed formal export systems. In 2001, the &quot;Compagnie pour la Promotion des Activités Café&quot; (COOPAC) was established, headquartered in the Les Volcans neighborhood of the Goma commune. COOPAC has become a leading player in the coffee industry, overseeing coffee-related operations in eastern Congo and an integrated coffee processing chain, including a hulling facility established in 2004 and a washing station situated along the shores of Lake Kivu. The city is also home to Maizeking, an industrial enterprise specializing in the manufacturing of products derived from corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat. 

=== Secondary and tertiary sectors ===
The secondary sector, though relatively underdeveloped, holds potential for growth, given the city&#x27;s dense population, which provides abundant labor force and potentially mitigates production overheads for entrepreneurs. Notable manufacturing enterprises include the MTC (Master Tabac Congo) conglomerate producing premium-grade cigarettes, coffee processing factories like SOTRAKI and ONC as well as food production companies such as Au Bon Pain and Boulangerie Mont Carmel, which manufacture baked goods. Other industrial entities include Nyiragongo Cement, a cement production facility; Mbinza, a mattress manufacturing company; and La Chocolaterie Lowa, a Congolese chocolate producer. Additionally, the city has a growing bottled water industry and photographic processing facilities, such as Fujicolor.

The financial industry is a significant component, with banking and non-banking financial institutions serving the city&#x27;s population. Banking institutions like Central Bank of the Congo, Banque Privée du Congo, Bank of Africa, Banque Commerciale et de Développement, Banque Internationale de Crédit, Banque Internationale pour l&#x27;Afrique Central, Equity Banque Commerciale du Congo, Standard Bank, First International Bank, Trust Merchant Bank, Rawbank, Afriland First Bank, Acces Bank, Eco Bank Democratic Republic of the Congo, and others provide financial services, while non-banking institutions, including 17 microfinance organizations, fortified with credit components cater to various fiscal needs within the city. Notably, microfinance entities like SOMIF/NFT, IMF Hekima, PAIDEK, Sociéte de Microcrédit Congolais, SOMIFI/REJEDE, COOPEC-Imara, COOPEC-Tumanini, and IMF PAIF, as well as NGOs like the Initiative Congolaise pour la Gestion Autonome des Populations (ICGP), the Association of Support for Grassroots Initiatives, Association d&#x27;Appui aux Initiatives de Base (APIBA), Organisation des Femmes pour le Développement (OFED), Solidarité et Fraternité dans l&#x27;Action, and Association de diabétiques du Congo (ADIC), contribute to economic development by supporting small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures. The city is also home to quasi-public non-bank financial institutions exemplified by Société Nationale d&#x27;Assurance (SONAS), Institution Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (INSS), Caisse Générale d&#x27;Épargne et de Crédit (CADECO), and Société Congolaise des Postes et Télécommunications (SCPT).

Goma benefits from support organizations like UNDP, UWEKI, and CAFED, which foster entrepreneurship, provide training, and facilitate access to resources for local businesses.

==Transport==

=== Air ===
Aviation is a significant transport mode linking Goma with domestic and international destinations. Goma International Airport, which serves as the city&#x27;s principal gateway, handles passenger and cargo traffic and facilitates two international routes to Entebbe and Nairobi, serviced by Ethiopian Airlines and Jambojet. However, the aviation industry in Goma has changed over the years with the emergence and departure of various carriers. While enterprises such as Virunga Air, Charter, and Sunair have ceased operations, stalwart aviation entities like société de Transports et Messageries au Kivu SARL (TMK), alongside Wimbi Dira Airways and Hewa Bora Airways persist in operating and rendering their services.

=== Maritime ===
Maritime transport is also an essential mode of transportation, connecting Goma with nearby cities like Bukavu in the South Kivu Province. Boats and ferries operated by companies such as the &quot;Société Nationale des Chemins de fer du Congo&quot; (SNCC) and private operators like Rafiki and Ihusi Hotel facilitate the movement of people and merchandise goods across Lake Kivu. Notably, boats such as Emmanuel 2, assembled locally, provide an alternative mode of transport, significantly reducing travel time compared to road travel.

=== Road ===

Road transport, presided over by private operators, is vital for intra-city and inter-city travel, encompassing a network of paved and unpaved routes. National Road No. 2 bisects the urban landscape, supplemented by smaller road segments, though their cumulative length is at most three kilometers. The city&#x27;s road transport system comprises various vehicles, including car, trucks, buses and motorcycles, with car and motorcycle taxis facilitating the majority of shuttle services. Car taxis, often referred to as city taxis, are predominantly used for passenger transport, while luggage taxis cater to the movement of goods. Motorcycle taxis, commonly employed for both passenger and small package deliveries, play a vital role in local mobility. Goma&#x27;s location on the Rwandan border ensures its connectivity to Gisenyi, with regular bus services facilitating travel between Goma and Kigali in less than four hours. Goma&#x27;s road network connects to Masisi, Walikale, Kisangani, Rutshuru, Butembo, Beni, Kasindi, Bunia, and Bukavu, among other destinations. Within the city, motorcycles operate day and night, with different drivers serving distinct shifts. Although major roads in Goma have improved, some residential avenues remain underdeveloped. Numerous roads are obstructed, either by improperly constructed homes, mountains of discarded waste, or incomplete construction projects, thereby limiting vehicular access in specific neighborhoods.

== Education ==

Goma&#x27;s education system is organized into three main levels: Kindergarten, for children aged 3 to 5; Primary school, designed for students aged 6 to 12; and Secondary school, which accommodates teenagers aged 12 to 18. Beyond basic education, Goma serves as an academic hub for post-secondary education, hosting several prestigious institutions governed by the Ministry of Higher and University Education (&quot;Ministère de l&#x27;Enseignement Supérieur et Universitaire, ESU)&quot;. The city is home to two of the nation&#x27;s best universities: the Free University of the Great Lakes Countries (ULPGL) and the University of Goma. In 2016, ULPGL achieved second place nationally according to International Colleges and Universities and third place in the Webometrics ranking, which positioned it 19,099th globally.

In addition to these flagship institutions, Goma boasts a wide range of operational higher education institutions:
== Crime ==

Since early 2019, violent crimes such as murders, robberies, and kidnappings have plagued outlying neighborhoods, notably Ndosho and Mugunga in Karisimbi commune. Ndosho, known for its bustling markets and brothels, is characterized by high crime rates and ethnic heterogeneity, while Mugunga, predominantly populated by Hutus, formerly hosted extensive refugee camps in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, alongside sizable IDPs settlements during periods of heightened conflict between the CNDP (and subsequently M23) and the FARDC from 2008 to 2010 and 2012 to 2013. Although the camps have been dismantled, the neighborhood is characterized by a high number of former IDPs (Hunde and Hutu) who settled in Mugunga. Both neighborhoods border Virunga National Park to the north and the main road to Sake to the south, dividing the Goma and Karisimbi communes, with diurnal activities centered along this road.

A significant number of Mugunga&#x27;s inhabitants, including brigands and &quot;maibobo&quot; (street children), gravitate towards Ndosho during daylight hours, lured by its superior commercial prospects. Throughout the day, encounters with insecurity primarily revolve around pickpocketing, extortion by &quot;maibobo&quot;, gang-related harassment, and coercive measures employed by security personnel in Ndosho. Brigandage and petty crime have evolved into a viable means of subsistence for many and are part of an urban economy of survival and enrichment. Pilfered merchandise goods are openly sold in the markets, with numerous criminals attaining notoriety within their neighborhoods and certain gang leaders achieving city-wide renown. During the night, security conditions worsen and become more violent. Most residents return to their homes, while mixed patrols of the Police Nationale Congolaise (PNC) and Police Militaire (PM) units, along with gangs, prowl around the streets. Without pedestrian traffic and under the cloak of darkness, it becomes easier for bandits, thieves, and even unscrupulous police and military officers to operate.

=== Coltan conflict-driven crime ===

The regional conflict surrounding coltan and other lucrative resources has compounded Goma&#x27;s challenges with crime. Armed groups, including the Rwandan military, the RCD-Goma, and various opposition factions, have been implicated in the systemic targeting of civilians as they vied for dominion over resource-abundant zones. During 2000 and 2001, RCD-Goma forces reportedly conducted a spate of violent incursions into residences, particularly targeting individuals engaged in the coltan trade. Notably, on 18 November 2000, armed men, including RCD-Goma combatants, attacked the residence of Edouard Kasereka Kahimba, a coltan buyer. The assailants demanded business records and coltan, injuring Kahimba and assaulting his family members. On 29 December 2000, combatants reportedly targeted a coltan trader known as &quot;Safro&quot; Sanvura, ransacking his residence and shooting indiscriminately. Similar incidents persisted into 2001, such as the attack on Pierre Hakizimana on 9 April, in which he was robbed of $3,000 at gunpoint.

On 8 September 2001, unidentified men in uniform conducted an early-morning attack on Sengiyumva, a 41-year-old coltan trader residing in the Katoyi neighborhood of Kasirimbi. He sustained three gunshot wounds to his leg after being beaten with sticks, with both cash and mineral resources being seized. Subsequently, on 14 October 2001, another trader, Papy, aged 26, endured a violent assault in his home, resulting in two gunshot wounds to the abdomen, allegedly inflicted by RCD-Goma forces. Though Papy survived, he required prolonged hospitalization for recovery.

<text>Richard Marcinko (November 21, 1940 – December 25, 2021) was a U.S. Navy SEAL commander and Vietnam War veteran. He was the first commanding officer of SEAL Team Six. After retiring from the United States Navy, he became an author, radio talk show host, military consultant, and motivational speaker.

==Early life and education==
Marcinko was born November 21, 1940, in Lansford, Pennsylvania, and was of Croatian and Slovak descent. His father was a Croat from Herzegovina—the southwestern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina along the border with the Croatia, which is mostly inhabited by Croats—and his mother from Slovakia. At a young age, his family moved to New Brunswick, New Jersey.

After dropping out of high school, Marcinko tried to enlist in the United States Marines, who rejected him due to a lack of a high school diploma. Marcinko successfully enlisted in the United States Navy in September 1958 as a radioman. He was accepted into the Underwater Demolition Team/ Replacement (UDTR) training in June 1961, and graduated in class 26 in October 1961. Marcinko served with UDT-21 until he was selected for an officer commission in 1965. After graduating from Officer Candidate School in December 1965, he was commissioned an ensign. He was later reassigned to SEAL Team TWO in June 1966.

He also received a Bachelor of Arts degree in international relations from the Auburn University at Montgomery and a Master of Arts degree in political science from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.

==Naval career==

===Vietnam War===
In January 1967, Marcinko deployed to Vietnam with 2nd Platoon, SEAL Team Two for a six-month tour of duty. On May 18, 1967, Marcinko led his men in an assault on Ilo Ilo Hon (Ilo Ilo Island), where they killed a large number of Viet Cong and destroyed six of their sampans (wooden boat). This action would come to be called the &quot;most successful SEAL operation in the Mekong Delta&quot; by the U.S. Navy. For leading this mission, Marcinko was awarded the Silver Star, the first of his four Bronze Stars, as well as a Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry.

Marcinko returned to Vietnam with SEAL Team Two after a few months stateside as officer-in-charge of 8th Platoon from December 1967 to June 1968. During the Tet Offensive, Marcinko ordered his platoon to assist U.S. Army Special Forces at Châu Đốc. What began as an urban street battle turned into a rescue mission of American nurses and a schoolteacher trapped in the city&#x27;s church and hospital.

After completing his second tour in Vietnam and a two-year stateside staff assignment, Marcinko was promoted to lieutenant commander and assigned as the naval attaché to Cambodia in 1973. After serving in Cambodia for 18 months, Marcinko returned stateside and assumed command of SEAL Team Two from 1974 to 1976.

===SEAL Team Six===
During the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, Marcinko was one of two Navy representatives for a Joint Chiefs of Staff task force known as the TAT (Terrorist Action Team). The purpose of the TAT was to develop a plan to free the American hostages held in Iran which culminated in Operation Eagle Claw. In the wake of the debacle, the Navy saw the need for a full-time dedicated counter-terrorist team and tasked Marcinko with its design and development.

Marcinko was selected by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Thomas B. Hayward as the first commanding officer of this new unit. At the time, the Navy had only two SEAL teams. Marcinko purportedly named the unit SEAL Team Six in order to confuse other nations, specifically the Soviet Union, into believing that the United States had at least three other SEAL teams that they were unaware of. He personally selected the unit&#x27;s members from across the existing SEAL and Underwater Demolition Teams, including a special counter-terrorist tactics section of SEAL Team Two, codenamed MOB-6. SEAL Team Six would be the Navy&#x27;s premier counter-terrorist and hostage rescue unit, like its Army counterpart Delta Force. While typically a two-year command, Marcinko commanded SEAL Team Six for three years, from August 1980 to July 1983.

===Red Cell===
After relinquishing command of SEAL Team Six to Captain Robert Gormly, Marcinko was tasked by Vice Admiral James &quot;Ace&quot; Lyons, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, with the design of a unit to test the Navy&#x27;s vulnerability to terrorism. This unit was the Naval Security Coordination Team OP-06D, unofficially named Red Cell.

==Personal life==

===Kickback trial and imprisonment===
Marcinko was indicted for conspiracy, conflict of interest and lying to the government on July 13, 1989, in connection with a kickback of $113,000 paid to Ramco International, a company set up by Marcinko and former SEAL John B. Mason, by Accuracy Systems, a Phoenix, Arizona-based arms manufacturer owned by Charles M. Byers. Byers was convicted of conspiracy and conflict of interest on October 20, 1989, but Marcinko was acquitted of conflict of interest.

Marcinko was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the government on January 24, 1990. The jury in that trial also acquitted Marcinko of a separate count of bribery.

On March 9, 1990, Marcinko was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison and fined $10,000 under charges of defrauding the government over the price of contractor acquisitions for hand grenades. Marcinko maintained that he was the subject of a witch-hunt for his work with Red Cell and that the fraud committed revealed the weaknesses of military security. Marcinko detailed his arrest and confinement in the last chapters of his autobiography.

===Civilian life===
Marcinko published a VHS and DVD movie account of his &quot;Red Cell&quot; operations.

His experiences led him to write his autobiography, &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-selling &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot;, and subsequent fictional sequels, most of which are co-written with ghostwriter John Weisman. With Weisman he co-authored a three-book series on leadership, management and team-building for business executives.

In 2005 he wrote an op-ed criticizing what he called &quot;the liberals attack on the activities at GITMO prison, or Abu Ghraib detention centers&quot;, claiming that &quot;manipulation is what has been practiced at our detention centers&quot;.

At the time of his death, he was CEO of Red Cell International and formerly of SOS Temps, Inc., a private security consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. He had a politically conservative talk radio show, &quot;America on Watch with Dick Marcinko&quot;, which was broadcast live. He was a spokesman for the Zodiac boat company&#x27;s Zodiac Maritime Training Academy, and served as a consultant on FOX&#x27;s television series &quot;24&quot;. He briefly collaborated with Strider Knives on a series of knife designs referred to as the &quot;RW&quot; signifying &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot; from 2008 to 2010.

===Death===
Marcinko died from a heart attack at his home in Fauquier County, Virginia, on December 25, 2021, at the age of 81.

==Awards and decorations==




===Silver Star citation===
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Lieutenant, Junior Grade Richard Marcinko, United States Navy, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Platoon Leader of 8th Platoon, SEAL Team Detachment Alfa, on 14 and 15 May 1968. As patrol leader, he led a squad size patrol to a known Viet Cong infiltration route through 2,000 meters of uncontested enemy terrain and established an ambush site. Three groups of Viet Cong soon approached and set up in the area. With no feasible escape route, the squad was surrounded by 85 armed Viet Cong for over four hours. Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Marcinko ordered artillery to stand by and directed air strikes on the Viet Cong within 300 meters of his own position. When the enemy force started to retreat toward the Cambodian border, he led an attack on a group of 43 Viet Cong and through bold and unselfish tactics quelled the enemy&#x27;s efforts to outflank and subdue his squad. Enemy fire from a nearby tree line was countered by Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Marcinko&#x27;s M-60 Machine Gun, his daring companions and the air strikes he directed on the enemy. A reconnaissance, conducted immediately after the enemy broke contact, revealed many heavy blood trails, one Viet Cong killed, and one SKS rifle abandoned and numerous bundles of hot food and clothing within 20 meters of the ambush site. A sweep held at first light brought the total assessment of losses to the enemy force to 24 Viet Cong killed, 41 Viet Cong wounded and six automatic weapons captured. His courage, valor under fire, dedication to duty and accurate prediction of the enemy&#x27;s tactics were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

They discover that the weapons are meant to arm militias across the country for an American Revolution-style war whose kickoff is timed with the anniversary of the Waco siege. 
* &quot;Designation Gold&quot; (1997) – When Marcinko discovers that one of his close friends (whose son Marcinko agreed to be a godfather for) is killed in Russia, he goes off on a mission to find out who did it.

* &quot;Detachment Bravo&quot; (2001) – Several top executives in the US and Britain are killed in high-profile attacks by the Green Defenders, an Irish Republican Army splinter group that wrecks the Good Friday Peace Accords. Now running a joint US-UK group of special operations soldiers with support from the FBI and NSA, Marcinko scrambles to stop the Green Defenders before they carry out another international terrorist attack - with the only problem being a lack of details on when and where the attack will take place and who&#x27;s the target.

Marcinko&#x27;s subtly convinced by the CIA to take up the assignment (after initially resisting the temptation of Kim&#x27;s $64-million reward), but things get muddled when the lover of one of his associates holds the missing child hostage in return for a North Korean nuclear weapon. 
* &quot;Seize the Day&quot; (2009) – When a casual observation of Marcinko leads one to believe that he can pass off for a slightly younger Fidel Castro, the CIA has him as the lead talent in a fake video of Castro&#x27;s last will and testament and send it to Cuba for circulation, with some insights from one of the former dictator&#x27;s barbers. However, a deathbed-ridden Castro his own game to play: using Cuban refugees to the US as viral carriers - and Marcinko&#x27;s own illegitimate son is in the crossfire. 
* &quot;Domino Theory&quot; (2011) – Marcinko&#x27;s security company is hired to oversee security preparations for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in India. An explosion at a nearby Indian Army base gets his attention, as the base was a nuclear-weapon storage site. It is discovered that a Pakistani group aims to hijack India&#x27;s nukes. 
* &quot;Blood Lies&quot; (2012) – Marcinko is contracted to head down to Mexico and rescue a former SEAL&#x27;s daughter kidnapped by Mexican drug cartels.

* &quot;Rogue Warrior: Curse of the Infidel&quot; (2014) – a botched CIA sting operation targeting an al-Qaeda-backed terrorist cell deep in money laundering - with Marcinko&#x27;s Red Cell International somehow included in the mix - leads to SEAL Team Six coming to the rescue. Little does everyone know that cell is connected to a plan to detonate a cruise liner right inside a US harbor. Marcinko&#x27;s private security operatives join forces with SEAL Six to stop the threat - and this time, bring in some of Six&#x27;s original SEALs into the battle.

==Video game==
Marcinko partnered with Bethesda Softworks to publish &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot; for the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. Marcinko himself is the protagonist and is voiced by actor Mickey Rourke. In the game, Marcinko is sent on a classified mission into North Korea to disrupt an anti-ballistic missile program. Released in December 2009, the game was critically panned, with critics citing poor AI, excessive use of expletives, numerous bugs, poor graphics, a short single-player mode and limited multiplayer mode. Since its release, &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot; has been listed as one of the worst video games of all time.

<doc id="1210507" wikidata="Q1238891" url="?curid=1210507" title="Don Arden">
<text>Don Arden (born Harry Levy; 4 January 1926 – 21 July 2007) was an English music manager, agent, and businessman. He managed the careers of rock acts such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Gene Vincent, Air Supply, Small Faces, The Move, Black Sabbath, Electric Light Orchestra, and Trickster.

Arden gained a reputation in Britain for his aggressive, sometimes illegal business tactics, which led to his being called &quot;Mr Big&quot;, the &quot;English Godfather&quot; and the &quot;Al Capone of Pop&quot;. His success story turned sour when his violent &#x27;negotiating&#x27; methods and questionable accounting caught up with him, and he became estranged from members of his own family.

He was married to Hope Shaw, a former ballet dancer/teacher, who died in 1999. He was the father of David Levy and Sharon Osbourne.

== Early life and career ==
Born into a Jewish family in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, Arden began his show-business career when he was 13 years old as a singer and stand-up comic after briefly attending the Royal College of Music. In 1944, he changed his name from Harry Levy to Don Arden. After being demobilized from the British Army at the end of World War II, Arden returned to civilian life to develop his show-business career from 1946 to 1953.

Arden worked as an entertainer on the British variety circuit. He impersonated singers such as Enrico Caruso and film actors known for gangster roles, such as Edward G. Robinson and George Raft. On weekends, Yiddish-speaking Arden impressed Jewish audiences with his Al Jolson routine. One of his record releases was his version of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; on the Embassy label, on which he tried to impersonate Elvis. In 1954, he became a showbiz agent after realising it would be more profitable. He began his career organising Hebrew folk song contests, then started putting together his own shows.

Arden launched his career as a manager when he signed up American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roller Gene Vincent in 1960, taking over from John Schatt. Arden could not control Vincent&#x27;s compulsive alcoholism and the relationship ended when Vincent reportedly pulled a knife on his manager. For a short period of time in the early 1960s, he worked with the British singer Elkie Brooks at the start of her career.

During 1964, Arden moved into beat group pop management with The Nashville Teens, who secured chart hits with &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;, &quot;Google Eye&quot; and &quot;Find My Way Back Home&quot;. According to Johnny Rogan&#x27;s book &quot;Starmakers &amp; Svengalis&quot;, the group&#x27;s earnings from those hits was £3,513. When group member John Hawken confronted Arden about some confusion over monies to be collected, his manager told him: &quot;I have the strength of 10 men in these hands&quot; and threatened to throw him from an office window.

In 1965, Arden met aspiring rock band Small Faces in his office in Carnaby Street. Half an hour later, he had signed them up. Arden was immediately struck by the potential of Small Faces: &quot;I thought at that time, on the first hearing, I thought it was the best band in the world&quot;. Kenney Jones, Small Faces&#x27; drummer, said: &quot;He was kind of a Jewish teddy bear I suppose. You liked him immediately because he was enthusiastic and he talked about what he could do and what he couldn&#x27;t do and whenever he said – &#x27;I&#x27;ll do this, I&#x27;ll do that&#x27; – he did and it came true.&quot; The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do About It&quot;, was ushered into the hit parade by &quot;chart-fixing&quot;, which cost Arden £12,000. Arden denied it was cheating: &quot;I had a saying, you can&#x27;t polish a turd. In other words, if the record&#x27;s no good to begin with it still won&#x27;t be any good after you&#x27;ve wasted your time and money getting it played&quot;.

== Arden&#x27;s business methods ==
In 1966, Arden and a squad of &quot;minders&quot; turned up at impresario Robert Stigwood&#x27;s office to &quot;teach him a lesson&quot; for daring to discuss a change of management with Small Faces, which became one of the most notorious incidents from the 1960s British pop business. Arden reportedly threatened to throw Stigwood out of the window if he ever interfered with his business again.

The band was never entirely convinced that Arden had paid them everything he owed them. Kenney Jones has mixed memories of the band&#x27;s stormy relationship with Arden: 

Arden tried to rekindle his former glories as a family entertainer by releasing a single of his own in 1967: &quot;Sunrise Sunset&quot;, from the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, but it failed to chart. Arden returned to music management in 1968 when he signed The Move. He struck gold when two groups formed by ex-Move members, ELO and Wizzard (1972), started having international hits: Wizzard with &quot;See My Baby Jive&quot; and &quot;Angel Fingers&quot; (1973), and ELO with &quot;10538 Overture&quot; (1972) and &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (1973). With later albums like &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1977) and &quot;Discovery&quot; (1979), ELO became a prominent act.

In 1973, Arden took over management of singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul. In the following year, she provided the first hit on his new Jet label, &quot;No Honestly&quot;, which was also the theme tune to a hit ITV comedy &quot;No, Honestly&quot;. By 1976, Arden was embroiled in a lawsuit with the distraught singer over what she claimed was late payment of money owed to her. De Paul commented: She eventually reached a settlement with Arden in 1978. He brought his son David and daughter Sharon into the business, intending to build an Arden showbiz dynasty.

== Estrangement from Sharon Osbourne and legal problems ==
In 1979, one of Arden&#x27;s successes, Black Sabbath, sacked their vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. Sharon entered a relationship with Osbourne, and took over his management from her father. Arden was livid. Reportedly, the next time Sharon visited Don, his vicious pet dogs savaged her. She was pregnant at the time and lost the child. Sharon eventually married Osbourne and had no contact with her father for 20 years.

In 1979, investigative reporter Roger Cook used the dispute with Lynsey de Paul to probe Arden&#x27;s controversial management style on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Checkpoint&quot; programme. That proved to be a colourful encounter. &quot;When you fight the champion you go 15 rounds, you&#x27;ve got to be prepared to go the whole way&quot;, Arden tells Cook. &quot;I&#x27;ll take you with one hand strapped up my arse. You&#x27;re not a man, you&#x27;re a creep.&quot; Arden threatened to break the neck of anyone who talked to Cook in his on-air interview.

From the late 1970s into the early 1980s, Arden enjoyed the high-rolling lifestyle of a top music mogul. In the mid-1980s, he bought Portland Recording Studios (formerly IBC Studios) from Chas Chandler and installed his son David as manager. The studio&#x27;s equipment was very outdated by that time, and much of the income was being generated by another company known as RadioTracks, which ran half the facility, and by George Peckham (Porky Prime Cuts), a well-known cutting engineer, whose cutting rooms were on the ground floor at the back of the building. Arden had acquired shares in RadioTracks through buying out Chandler without the knowledge of the other directors.

In 1986, Arden was arrested for kidnapping and torturing a Jet records accountant named Harshad Patel, whom Arden believed had been embezzling money. Arden&#x27;s son, known legally as &#x27;David Levy&#x27;, appeared at the Old Bailey in 1986 for his role in the matter. The incident occurred at the offices at 35 Portland Place. Convicted, Levy spent several months in an open prison. Arden, tried separately on related charges, was acquitted.

The drawn-out dispute meant Arden was unable to attend to business, and legal costs proved a fatal strain on Jet Records, which collapsed. Portland Recording Studios were considerably in arrears with rent to the Prudential, which owned the building at Portland Place, close to the BBC&#x27;s Broadcasting House. Eventually, the Prudential evicted Jet Records.

From 1986 to the mid-1990s, Arden shuttled between his homes in Beverly Hills and Parkside in Wimbledon, London.

== Reconciliation with Sharon Osbourne and final years ==
In 2001 Sharon Osborne told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;The best lesson I ever had was watching him fuck his business up. He taught me everything not to do. My father&#x27;s never even seen any of my three kids and, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, he never will.&quot; Later the same year, at Ozzy&#x27;s insistence, Sharon and Arden finally reconciled, with Arden taking a walk-on role in the successful reality TV show &quot;The Osbournes&quot; in 2002. He also met his grandchildren Jack and Kelly for the first time on the show, and he met his granddaughter Aimee off-screen.

In August 2004, Sharon Osbourne stated her father had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. A &quot;tell all&quot; biography about Arden&#x27;s life, entitled &quot;Mr Big&quot;, was published in 2007, shortly before Arden&#x27;s death in Los Angeles on 21 July 2007. Sharon Osbourne paid for her father&#x27;s care in the last years of his life. He was buried in Agecroft Jewish Cemetery, Langley Road, Pendlebury, in Salford on 25 July 2007.

On 29 October 2007, a memorial headstone was unveiled at Agecroft by his sister Eileen (Somers), daughter Sharon Osbourne, grandson Jack Osbourne and nephew and niece Danny Somers and Cathy Cowan. One line on the inscription reads: &quot;His beautiful voice will sing in our hearts forever. Shalom&quot;. Later in the morning a plaque was unveiled at Higher Crumpsall Synagogue, Cheetham Hill, Manchester, with the addition of the words &quot;It all started here&quot; with a line of musical notes. That refers to the time when Arden, then Harry Levy, sang in the synagogue choir as a very young man.

== Carnaby Street plaque ==

On 8 September 2007, a commemorative plaque dedicated to Don Arden and Small Faces was unveiled at 52–55 Carnaby Street, London, Arden&#x27;s former offices. Kenney Jones, ex-drummer of Small Faces, said: &quot;To honour the Small Faces after all these years is a terrific achievement. I only wish that Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane and the late Don Arden were here to enjoy this moment with me&quot;.

<text>Jacqueline McShee (born 25 December 1943) is an English singer. Since 1966, she has performed with Pentangle, a jazz-influenced folk rock band.

== Biography ==
McShee was born in Catford, South London. Her musical career began as a soloist in British folk clubs in the mid 1960s. After working with guitarist John Renbourn, she co-founded Pentangle.

Pentangle established itself as one of the earliest exponents of the British folk rock movement. However, in addition to attracting fans of traditional British folk, they also drew audiences from the rock, pop and psychedelic folk worlds. The original band played a mixture of ballads, blues, and jazz, often blending these genres in the same piece.

In 1994, McShee formed a new band named Jacqui McShee&#x27;s Pentangle which, with a few personnel changes, is still performing today.

In 1995, McShee performed as a session singer, along with her husband, drummer Gerry Conway, on the album &quot;Active in The Parish&quot; by the singer-songwriter David Hughes. It was voted &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27;. In 1998, McShee teamed up with Ulrich Maske to record &quot;The Frog and the Mouse&quot; and &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot;. These two books were designed to help German children to learn to speak English.

In 2020, she and British guitarist Kevin Dempsey released &quot;From There to Here&quot; (MCDEM 001), a recording of self-composed songs and traditional tunes. In November 2020, she was reported to be living in Surrey, England.

McShee has a sister. Both of them joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the early 1960s.

<text>The Battle of Las Guasimas of June 24, 1898 was a Spanish rearguard action by Major General Antero Rubín against advancing columns led by Major General &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Wheeler and the first land engagement of the Spanish–American War. The battle unfolded from Wheeler&#x27;s attempt to storm Spanish positions at Las Guasimas de Sevilla, in the jungles surrounding Santiago de Cuba, with the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry and the 10th Regular Cavalry.

Approaching on June 24, American reports suggested the Spaniards were digging in with a field gun; however, Cuban scouts contradicted these, revealing the Spaniards were preparing to abandon their position. In fact, the Spanish troops had received orders to fall back on Santiago. Wheeler requested the assistance of the attached Cuban forces in an immediate attack, but their commander, Col. Gonzales Clavel, refused. Wheeler decided to attack anyway, rushing his men forward with two field guns in tow.

During the excitement of the battle, Wheeler, a former Confederate officer, supposedly called out &quot;Let&#x27;s go, boys! We&#x27;ve got the damn Yankees on the run again!&quot;. Wheeler&#x27;s forces moved to encircle the Spaniards&#x27; first battle line, assaulting its front and right flank, but were repulsed. During a pause in the fighting, both sides reinforced their positions. The Spaniards sent forward two companies of the San Fernando Battalion, along with artillery. After midday the U.S. attack was renewed, but the Spanish Provisional de Puerto Rico Battalion once again checked the American assault.

After halting the American advance, the Spanish resumed their withdrawal towards Santiago. The battle had cost U.S. forces seventeen dead and fifty-two wounded, while Spanish forces suffered seven dead and fourteen wounded. The American &quot;yellow&quot; press, unaware of the facts of the ground, described the battle as a rout of the Spaniards; later, historians severely faulted Wheeler for wasting the lives of his men in a frontal assault.

==Background==

On June 23, the Spanish garrisons of Sigua, Siboney and Daiquirí, retiring before American landings in their vicinity, clashed with a Cuban advance guard column of 250 men under Colonel Carlos González Clavel near Sevilla, east of Santiago de Cuba. Having lost three dead and 10 wounded in the skirmish and inflicted roughly the same casualties, the Spaniards retired to a lightly entrenched position at Las Guasimas de Sevilla, on the road to Santiago (4 miles northwest of Siboney beach).

Brigadier-General Lawton, commander of the 2nd Infantry Division of the U.S. Volunteers V Corps, had been appointed chief of the landing operation by Major General William Rufus Shafter, Commander-in-Chief of American forces in Cuba. American reports suggested the Spaniards were digging in with a field gun; however, Cuban scouts contradicted these, revealing the Spaniards were preparing to abandon their position.

On the 23rd, Major General Joseph Wheeler, received orders from Shafter to throw pickets to Siboney, but found the enemy in retreat towards Sevilla, with about 100 Cubans engaging their rear. Wheeler decided to attack the new Spanish positions the next day, which were established three miles from Siboney, with the aid of General Castillo. With information supplied by General Castillo, including a map of the Spanish positions, Wheeler and General Young planned an advance along two columns, Col. Wood on the left and the 1st and 10th cavalry on the right.

==Battle==
Brigadier General Antero Rubín commanded nearly 1,500 men and 2 guns, distributed as follows:
* 3 companies of the 1st &quot;&quot;Provisional de Puerto Rico&quot; infantry battalion,
* 5 companies of the 11th &quot;San Fernando&quot; infantry battalion
* 5 companies of the 4th &quot;Talavera Peninsular&quot;&quot; infantry battalion
* 2 companies of &quot;movilizados&quot; (Spanish levied loyalists)
* 2 platoons of engineers and 1 platoon of mountain artillery equipped with two 75 mm Krupp guns
These forces were deployed in three echelons: 3 companies of &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; and 1 company of &quot;movilizados&quot; covering the crossroads of the Siboney trails, with 2 other companies (&quot;San Fernando&quot;) guarding the surrounding heights; 3 companies (&quot;San Fernando&quot;), the engineers, and the artillery holding the Asiento de Sevilla; and 5 companies of &quot;Talavera&quot; and 1 company of &quot;movilizados&quot; at La Redonda under Colonel Bory, covering the trails to Justicí and El Pozo.

The American side included the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, or &quot;Rough Riders&quot;, under Leonard Wood, the 1st U.S. Regular Cavalry, and the 10th U.S. Regular Cavalry (this consisted of Afro-American soldiers, then called Buffalo soldiers). Supported by artillery, the American forces numbered 964 men, supported by 800 men from Castillo.

The first sign the Americans had of the enemy&#x27;s proximity was a Cuban Army soldier lying dead by the road. The engagement began with shots by U.S. artillery. Spanish infantry returned fire, pinning down the advancing American units with rifle volleys. The Spaniards were armed with superior German-made 7mm 1893 model Mauser repetition rifles that fired round after round of smokeless gunpowder, making them exceedingly difficult to target in return. Present during the battle, author Stephen Crane (famous for his novel The Red Badge of Courage) Crane wrote that the German-made guns “sounded as if one string of a most delicate musical instrument had been touched by the wind into a long, faint note, or that overhead someone had swiftly swung a long, thin-lashed whip.”

===1st &amp; 10th Cavalry attack Las Guasimas on the right road===
Wheeler&#x27;s forces moved to encircle the Spaniards&#x27; first echelon, assaulting its front and right flank. Brigade commander SBM Young personally supervised the positioning of a battery of one pounder Hotchkiss field guns 900 yards from the Spanish main position on a dominant ridge pointing Southwest. Wanting to be absolutely sure that the troops on the hill were not Spanish, he fired several rounds at the hill. Immediately, two 75mm Spanish Krupp-designed mountain guns returned fire. Satisfied that he was up against the Spanish. Writing in his serialized set of articles (and later book), &quot;The Rough Riders,&quot; Theodore Roosevelt described the opening phase of the battle that started on the right road and involved the 1st and 10th Regular Cavalry in Chapter III &quot;General Young&#x27;s Fight.&quot; as follows:

The denseness of the jungle and the fact that they used absolutely smokeless powder, made it exceedingly difficult to place exactly where they were, and almost immediately Young, who always liked to get as close as possible to his enemy, began to push his troops forward. They were deployed on both sides of the road in such thick jungle that it was only here and there that they could possibly see ahead, and some confusion, of course, ensued, the support gradually getting mixed with the advance. Captain Beck took A Troop of the Tenth in on the left, next to Captain Galbraith&#x27;s (K) troop of the First; two other troops of the Tenth were on the extreme right. Through the jungle ran wire fences here and there, and as the troops got to the ridge they encountered precipitous heights. They were led most gallantly, as American regular officers always lead their men; and the men followed their leaders with the splendid courage always shown by the American regular soldier. There was not a single straggler among them, and in not one instance was an attempt made by any trooper to fall out in order to assist the wounded or carry back the dead, while so cool were they and so perfect their fire discipline, that in the entire engagement the expenditure of ammunition was not over ten rounds per man. Major Bell, who commanded the squadron, had his leg broken by a shot as he was leading his men. Captain Wainwright succeeded to the command of the squadron. Captain Knox was shot in the abdomen. He continued for some time giving orders to his troops, and refused to allow a man in the firing-line to assist him to the rear. His First Lieutenant, Byram, was himself shot, but continued to lead his men until the wound and the heat overcame him and he fell in a faint. The advance was pushed forward under General Young&#x27;s eye with the utmost energy, until the enemy&#x27;s voices could be heard in the entrenchments. The Spaniards kept up a very heavy firing, but the regulars would not be denied, and as they climbed the ridges (on the right side of the Camino Real road going into the village of Las Guasimas from the southeast) the Spaniards broke and fled.&quot;
Spanish claims that they had twice repulsed the American attack were not born by any battlefield reports of Troop commanders that day.

===1st Volunteer &quot;Rough Riders&quot; attack Las Guasimas on the left trail===
On the left trail, at approximately 7:20am, the four man point patrol 250 yds ahead of L Troop commanded by Captain Alyn Capron came across the dead Spanish soldier killed by a Cuban attack the previous day and which the Cubans had told Wheeler would indicate the proximity of Spanish lines running left and right across the road. When informed of this by Capron, Leonard Wood, who was about 500 yards back on the bridle path and commanding the Rough Riders ordered &quot;Silence in the Ranks&quot; and immediately deployed several troops to the left under Major Brodie and several troops to the right under Lt. Col. Roosevelt. It was while this deployment was occurring that the point man shot a Spaniard and triggered an immediate return fire by volleys on the part of the Spaniards. Rough Riders on both left and right sides of the trail moved forward and eventually forced the Spaniards back to their second line of trenches. Continuing to advance, the Rough Riders eventually forced the Spanish to withdraw completely from their final positions. Rough Riders from A Troop on the far right linked up with their regular counterparts and helped them seize the Spanish positions on the long finger-like hill to the right of the right road, with both Rough Riders and Regulars meeting at the base of the finger-like hill. By this time it was approximately 9:30. Reinforcements from the regular 9th Cavalry arrived, but it was already 30 minutes after the fight.

After halting the American advance, the Spanish inexplicably resumed their ongoing withdrawal towards Santiago&#x27;s outer defenses instead of profiting from the sharp reverse inflicted on the Americans, allowing &quot;American observers [to] unanimously but incorrectly assume their attack had forced the enemy to retreat.&quot;

Spanish forces suffered 7 dead and 7 wounded, as reported by general Rubin, although these figures are sometimes revised upward. (The discrepancy occurs because the Spaniards at Las Guásimas escorted a convoy carrying wounded troopers, as can be read in the order of retreat sent to General Rubin by Lt. General Arsenio Linares on the afternoon of the 24th.)

==Aftermath==
Both sides emerged satisfied with their perceived &quot;little victory.&quot; Rubín had conducted a successful rearguard operation while guaranteeing the safety of his forces, moving away from the menacing, large-caliber guns of the U.S. Navy along the coast and connecting with the Spanish defenders of Santiago. After satisfactorily drawing &quot;first blood&quot; at Las Guasimas, Wheeler concentrated the U.S. Volunteer V Corp with General Calixto García&#x27;s 5,000 Cubans and invested Santiago&#x27;s first lines of defense. American morale and confidence soared.

The position at Sevilla, briefly occupied by American forces, turned out to be of little value for the aimed advance towards Santiago. General Shafter considered installing his headquarters at La Redonda once the landing was completed, moving it afterwards to El Pozo. The Spanish retreat did unbar the way to the strong points that covered Santiago on the east side, mainly Fort Aguadores, San Juan Hill, Canosa, El Caney, and Fort El Viso, where a set of bloody battles would be waged on July 1. Many of the Spanish officers and soldiers that fought at Las Guasimas de Sevilla were to be in the fight again at the bloody encounter of San Juan Hill.

Although Colonel Gonzalez Clavel was criticized by some U.S. officers for not taking part in the attack, he had in fact acted in accordance with military protocol and his directives from General Lawton, the supreme authority during the landing, the Headquarters&#x27; orders being not to advance until the landing was completed. Gonzalez Clavel&#x27;s actions were warmly approved by General Lawton and General Calixto Garcia. Moreover, historical scrutiny of the operation has suggested the Americans erred badly in pursuing a frontal attack against a Spanish position which might have been turned or enveloped with much less difficulty; had the Spaniards elected to hold their ground, Wheeler may have sustained a very severe defeat. An officer with the Rough Riders reflected: &quot;It is a good thing we are not at war with England or Germany or France, for we should not last a week.&quot;

The Spanish deployment around Santiago has likewise been sternly criticized. Observers faulted Linares for failing to challenge the American disembarkation at Siboney altogether and Rubín for yielding the ridges at Las Guasimas—despite orders to this effect—to an American column that had failed to eject him. One historian suggested the Spaniards could not oppose the American advance without exposing themselves to a potentially devastating bombardment from long-range naval guns. The inefficacy of American naval gunfire against shore-based positions throughout the war may cast doubt on this assertion.

==In fiction==

This engagement was featured in the miniseries &quot;Rough Riders&quot; starring Tom Berenger as Theodore Roosevelt. The film depicts it as an American success, albeit a costly one. It was also mentioned in &quot;Benjamin&#x27;s Field: Rescue,&quot; the first book of a fictional trilogy by author J. J. Knights. Knights describes the battle as a costly and wasteful venture that had an enduring negative impact on the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Benjamin Kyner, who fought in the battle as a corporal.

===Inaccuracies===
There are several inaccuracies in the movie. The Colt Rapid Firing guns seen in the movie&#x27;s depiction of the battle were never used in the actual fight as the mules that hauled the disassembled weapons, bolted with the first Spanish fire dumping the guns on the ground and temporarily jamming their firing mechanisms beyond easy field repair. Lieutenant Pershing was not in command of the regular cavalry troops. In the final assault, the commander of the two regular and volunteer regiments were nowhere near each other. The Rough Riders were on the left flank and the regulars were on the right – exactly the opposite to the movie. Roosevelt was not at the far right end of the Rough Riders line, near the regulars. Instead, he was on the far left end of the Rough Riders, having been ordered to take over the wounded Major Alexander Brodie&#x27;s squadron of troops D, E and F. Trooper Harry Hefner was not found dying at the old dystellery house. He was left, wounded, prompted up and continuing to fire. He was found dead after the battle. The man shot along with Hamilton Fish was Trooper Ed Culver. He was not the porter to the officers.

===Accuracies===
The Spanish Mauser rifles were authentic. The map seen at the final assault is an enlargement of a map drawn by Harpers Monthly War correspondent, Caspar Whitney.

<text>WHRB is a commercial FM radio station in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It broadcasts at 95.3 MHz and is operated by students at Harvard College. The station is owned by Harvard Radio Broadcasting Co., Inc., a non-profit corporation independent of Harvard University.

==History==
WHRB was one of America&#x27;s first college radio stations, initially signing on as a carrier current station on December 2, 1940. After acquiring funding from &quot;The Harvard Crimson,&quot; the station&#x27;s first call sign was WHCN (&quot;&quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; Network&quot;). It broke from the &quot;Crimson&quot; in 1943 and adopted the call sign WHRV (&quot;Harvard Radio Voice&quot;). Harvard Radio Broadcasting Co., Inc., the non-profit corporation that owns the station, was formed February 1, 1951, and the current call sign adopted.

In order to reach audiences beyond Harvard&#x27;s campus, the corporation acquired a commercial FM broadcast license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and began regular broadcasting on May 17, 1957, at 107.1 MHz. A few years later, the station changed frequency to 95.3 MHz, where it has remained since. The broadcast area expanded considerably in 1995 when the main transmitter was relocated from atop Holyoke Center (now called the Smith Campus Center) in Harvard Square to its present location atop One Financial Center in downtown Boston. (A facility remains at the Smith site for backup purposes.) Broadcasts went global when internet retransmission of its programs began on November 18, 1999. In 2009, WHRB made available for download the first stand-alone college radio station iPhone app.

==Programming==
WHRB is a confederacy of on-air departments, each with its own staff, training requirements, and allocation of airtime. Departments include Classical Music, The Jazz Spectrum, The Blues Hangover, Sports, News, The Darker Side, and Record Hospital. During the academic year, the station publishes several detailed program guides, describing its regular programming as well as the Orgy periods that end each semester.

Orgies (the term is a registered trademark of the station) are consecutive presentations of the entire musical output of composers, record labels, or genres, sometimes running 24 hours a day for a week or more. Station legend has it that these began when an exuberant undergraduate in 1943 decided to celebrate his passing a difficult exam by broadcasting all nine Beethoven symphonies in order. Orgies continue to take place during exam periods, allowing the station to be run with a reduced on-air staff at these busy times. &quot;Orgies&quot; are broadcast each year throughout most of December, and again from the beginning of May through Harvard&#x27;s commencement ceremony near the end of that month.

Some of WHRB&#x27;s regular programs have long histories of their own. For example, the country music program &quot;Hillbilly at Harvard&quot; dates back to 1948, and &quot;Sunday Night at the Opera&quot; is one of the longest-running programs in its genre in the United States. The station&#x27;s underground rock department, Record Hospital, began in 1984 and hosts an annual music &quot;fest&quot;.

WHRB also broadcasts live play-by-play coverage of all Harvard University football and men&#x27;s hockey games, along with occasional broadcasts of other Harvard sports like men&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s hockey, and is the Boston-area home, in season, for the weekly broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera. WHRB has broadcast the weekly Sunday services at Harvard&#x27;s Memorial Church since the early 1960s.

==Notable alumni==
Prominent broadcasters who began their careers at WHRB include Martin Bookspan (voice of the New York Philharmonic), Steve Curwood (host of &quot;Living on Earth&quot; on NPR), Bruce Morton (CNN), Dan Raviv (CBS), Scott Horsley (NPR), and Chris Wallace (Fox News). Harpsichordist Igor Kipnis, &quot;New York Times&quot; critics John Rockwell and Jon Caramanica, &quot;New Yorker&quot; writers Alex Ross and Kelefa Sanneh, pianist and composer Robert D. Levin, author and critic Douglas Wolk, ZDNet founder Michael Kolowich, Justin Rice and Christian Rudder of Bishop Allen, Karl Rove&#x27;s personal attorney Robert Luskin, visual artist Alex Kahn, record producers Thomas Blanchard Wilson Jr. and Jim Barber, and the members of the chimp rock band Fat Day have been on the station&#x27;s staff. David Mays, the founder of &quot;The Source&quot; magazine, hosted a popular show, &quot;Street Beat&quot;. Raphael Bostic, current president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, broadcast basketball and R&amp;B while at the station. Cara Jones, singer-songwriter and DJ at J-Wave in Tokyo, Japan.

Mentor to these alumni for almost the last 60 years, and to everyone else who worked at the station, was David Elliott, a constant WHRB presence who filled a wide range of roles since his student days, from savvy and precise classical and opera curator-broadcaster to orgy mastermind, from board chair to eminent adviser. Elliott died November 12, 2020, at age 78.

<text>Cheap Seats without Ron Parker, or &quot;Cheap Seats: Without Ron Parker&quot; commonly shortened to Cheap Seats, is a television program broadcast on ESPN Classic and hosted by brothers Randy and Jason Sklar. The brothers appear as fictional ESPN tape librarians who amuse themselves by watching old, campy sports broadcasts and lampooning them. Produced by Mark Shapiro, Showrunner, Todd Pellegrino, James Cohen and Joseph Maar, &quot;Cheap Seats&quot; was originally an hour-long program. There were eight one hour-long episodes in the first season, all of which were edited to fit a 30-minute time slot.

A number of actors and comedians were featured in various pre recorded and in-studio comedy skits on the show, including Jim Gaffigan, H. Jon Benjamin, Paul Rudd, David Cross, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Eugene Mirman, Michael Ian Black, Nick Kroll, Kristen Schaal, Judah Friedlander, Nick Swardson, Mike Birbiglia, Paul Rudd, Doug Benson, Kathy Griffin, Carlos Alazraqui and Patton Oswalt.

==Regular segments==
&quot;Cheap Seats&quot; debuted on February 4, 2004, with the opening of the episode showing &quot;Ron Parker&quot; (played by Michael Showalter), the show&#x27;s browbeating original host, injured by a shelf full of tapes after it collapses on him, thus forcing the Sklars to fill in as hosts as they were #2 and #3 on the depth chart after him (ahead of #4 Ryan Leaf). This skit was part of the show&#x27;s opening theme until the second season, which featured a new introduction while all references to Parker were removed (although in the theme song which opened episodes of Season 4, the lyrics include &quot;going farther than Ron Parker&quot;).

In addition to the Sklars&#x27; regular commentary, &quot;Cheap Seats&quot; contained regular segments such as &quot;Do You Care?&quot; (in which the Sklars informed viewers of obscure facts related to the shows they were watching), and &quot;The Cheapies&quot;, where awards in nonsensical categories were given out to in-episode personalities at the show&#x27;s closing. Other regular segments included &quot;Breakdown&quot;, where then-ESPN analyst Sean Salisbury would comedically break down an athlete&#x27;s performance; and &quot;What Got Cut&quot;, in which other humorous elements of an episode that were edited due to time constraints were glossed over by the Sklars. &quot;Cheap Shot of the Week&quot; showcased an athlete featured earlier in the show or in a prior episode at their worst. Original sketches parodying a topic relevant to a particular program were filmed by various comedians.

The set featured a wall-mounted poster that would appear on camera prior to commercial breaks, which read &quot;Attention ESPN Staff: Do Not Lend Tapes to This Person&quot; and contained a photograph of a then-relevant notorious celebrity or athlete, such as Vince McMahon or Barry Bonds. A photo of the Sklars themselves was seen in the series finale.

===Live-audience era===
&quot;Cheap Seats&quot; briefly included a live studio audience and virtual laugh track during the second season, starting with an episode on the 1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Only six shows were produced with this format, and the audience was gone by the premiere of the third season on September 19, 2005. The episodes with the audience were edited to minimize their presence in future reruns.

===&quot;On the Road&quot;===
Two episodes were taped in locations other than New York or Los Angeles. In October 2005, ESPN Classic aired &quot;&quot;Cheap Seats&quot; on the Road&quot; from the Sklar brothers&#x27; hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, where the second Busch Stadium was being torn down because part of it was on the same land on which Busch Stadium III was being constructed. On the episode, the Sklars try to convince city officials to cancel the stadium&#x27;s demolition by combining the two into a bizarre superstructure.

During Season 3, &quot;Cheap Seats&quot; went to Hillsborough, New Jersey, after a contestant won a contest for the Sklars to film an episode in their home. The episode was titled &quot;Cheap Seats on the Road: A Fan&#x27;s Couch&quot;.

===&quot;Utilityman: The Quest for Cooperstown&quot;===
This particular episode, which is not officially a part of the &quot;Cheap Seats&quot; canon, is a 2004 ESPN special (produced by MLB Productions). It features the Sklars going on a trip to St. Louis and then to Cooperstown. The Sklars went all the way to the National Baseball Hall of Fame on a campaign to get beloved 1980s and 1990s St. Louis Cardinals player José &quot;The Utilityman&quot; Oquendo inducted for his versatility to play almost any position on the baseball field. (In 1988, Oquendo became the first National League player since 1918 to have played all nine positions in one season.) 
==Source material==
Most of the broadcasts are from ESPN&#x27;s archives. Among them:
* &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; broadcasts
* Professional wrestling
* Scripps National Spelling Bee
* World Series of Poker final tables
* Steve Garvey celebrity sporting events

&quot;Cheap Seats&quot; was shot in New York City (with segments filmed in Los Angeles) and had made use of local comedians as guest stars in its sketches. Most of the bit parts were played by stand-up comics whom Jason and Randy met during their years on the road as standup comedians themselves. The &quot;Creative Breaking/K-1 Fighting&quot; episode guest-starred the cast of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, in their theatrical silhouette form, cracking on sketches the Sklars performed.

==Series finale==
A special titled &quot;This is Inside Cheap Seats&quot; that aired on April 17, 2006, though most of the content therein was fictional. The fourth and final season premiered on June 5, 2006.

The series finale aired on November 19, and included racquetball, amateur bowling, curling, model airplane racing, and ping-pong. The episode&#x27;s main focus was on the Sklars (fictitiously) getting a job as anchors on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. However, it turned out they weren&#x27;t hired to be anchors, but as errand boys to do the anchors&#x27; bidding, causing the brothers to consider going back to the show, which was currently being hosted by then New York Yankees outfielder Johnny Damon (a fan of the show) and a recurring character called the &quot;Score Settler.&quot; Before the last episode, ESPN Classic presented 12 previous episodes in a six-hour &quot;finale-a-thon.&quot;

&quot;Cheap Seats&quot; reruns do not currently air on the now-defunct ESPN Classic or any other network. Selected episodes from the first season were at one time, but are no longer, available for purchase through the iTunes Store.

<text>The Nauvoo Temple was the second temple constructed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The church&#x27;s first temple was completed in Kirtland, Ohio, United States, in 1836. In the winter of 1846, when the main body of the church was forced out of Nauvoo, the church attempted to sell the building, finally succeeding in 1848. The building was damaged by arson and a tornado before being demolished.

In 1937, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) reacquired the lot on which the original temple had stood. In 2000, the church began to build a temple on the original site with an exterior that is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern Latter-day Saint temple. On June 27, 2002, a date that coincided with the 158th anniversary of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the temple was dedicated by the LDS Church as the Nauvoo Illinois Temple.

==History==
The Latter Day Saints made preparations to build a temple soon after establishing their headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1839. The 4-acre land for the temple was purchased in late 1840, for $1,100. On April 6, 1841, the temple&#x27;s cornerstone was laid under the direction of Joseph Smith, the church&#x27;s founder and president; Sidney Rigdon gave the principal oration. At its base the building was long and wide with a clock tower and weathervane reaching to a total height of —a 60% increase over the dimensions of the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple had a full basement which housed a baptismal font. Because the Saints had to abandon Nauvoo, the building was not entirely completed. The basement with its font was finished, as were the first floor assembly hall and the attic. When these parts of the building were completed, they were used for performing ordinances (basement and attic) or for worship services (first floor assembly hall).
The Nauvoo Temple was designed in the Greek Revival style by architect William Weeks, under the direction of Joseph Smith. Weeks became disaffected from the church in 1847 and Truman O. Angell later took his place as the primary architect. His design made use of distinctively Latter Day Saint motifs, including sunstones, moonstones, and starstones. It is often mistakenly thought that these stones represent the three degrees of glory in the Latter Day Saint conception of the afterlife, but the stones appear in the wrong order. Instead, Wandle Mace, foreman for the framework of the Nauvoo Temple, has explained that the design of the temple was meant to be &quot;a representation of the Church, the Bride, the Lamb&#x27;s wife&quot;. In this regard, Mace references John&#x27;s statement in Revelation 12:1 concerning the &quot;woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.&quot; This explains why the starstones are at the top of the temple (&quot;crown of twelve stars&quot;), the sunstones in the middle (&quot;clothed with the sun&quot;) and the moonstones at the bottom (&quot;moon under her feet&quot;).
Construction was only half complete at the death of Joseph Smith in 1844. After a succession crisis, Brigham Young was sustained as the church&#x27;s leader by the majority of Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo. As mob violence increased during the summer of 1845, he encouraged the Latter Day Saints to complete the temple even as they prepared to abandon the city, so portions of it could be used for Latter Day Saint ordinance, such as baptisms for the dead in the basement font. During the winter of 1845–46, the temple began to be used for additional ordinances, including the Nauvoo-era endowment, sealings in marriage, and adoptions. The Nauvoo Temple was in use for less than three months.

Most of the Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo, beginning in February 1846, but a small crew remained to finish the temple&#x27;s first floor, so that it could be formally dedicated. Once the first floor was finished with pulpits and benches, the building was finally dedicated in private services on April 30, 1846, and in public services on 1 May. In September 1846 the remaining Latter Day Saints were driven from the city and vigilantes from the neighboring region, including Carthage, Illinois, entered the near-empty city and vandalized the temple.

Initially the church&#x27;s agents tried to lease the structure, first to the Catholic Church, and then to private individuals. When this failed, they attempted to sell the temple, asking up to $200,000, but this effort also met with no success. On March 11, 1848, the LDS Church&#x27;s agents sold the building to David T. LeBaron, for $5,000. Finally, the New York Home Missionary Society expressed interest in leasing the building as a school, but around midnight on October 8–9, 1848, the temple was set on fire by an unknown arsonist. Nauvoo&#x27;s residents attempted to put out the fire, but the temple was gutted. James J. Strang, leader of the Strangite faction of Latter Day Saints, accused Young&#x27;s agents of setting fire to the temple. However, Strang&#x27;s charges were never proven. On April 2, 1849, LeBaron sold the damaged temple to Étienne Cabet for $2,000. Cabet, whose followers were called Icarians, hoped to establish Nauvoo as a communistic utopia.

=== Destruction ===
After the fire of October 9, 1848, only the four exterior walls remained standing. Cabet and his followers began clearing rubble and trying to reconstruct the interior of the temple; however, on May 27, 1850, Nauvoo was struck by a major tornado which toppled one of the walls onto eight stone masons. One source claimed the storm seemed to &quot;single out the Temple&quot;, felling &quot;the walls with a roar that was heard miles away&quot;. Cabet ordered the demolition of two more walls in the interests of public safety, leaving only the façade standing. The Icarians used much of the temple&#x27;s stone to build a new school building on the southwest corner of the temple lot. By 1857, however, most of Cabet&#x27;s followers had left Nauvoo and over time many of the original stones for the temple were used in the construction of other buildings throughout Hancock County. In February 1865, Nauvoo&#x27;s City Council ordered the final demolition of the last standing portion of the temple—one lone corner of the façade. Soon afterwards, all evidence of the temple disappeared, except for a hand pump over a well that supplied water to the baptismal font. Three of the original sunstones are known to have survived and are on display—one is on loan to LDS Church&#x27;s Visitor Center in Nauvoo, one is in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and the third and only one that has not been restored is displayed, along with the only moonstone on display, at the Joseph Smith Historic Center of the Community of Christ.

== Nauvoo Illinois Temple ==

From 1937 to 1962, the LDS Church reacquired and restored the lot on which the temple stood. The church bought the portion that initially housed the temple in an uncontested public auction on February 19, 1937, for $900, after previously being listed and protected by the bank at auction several times because prices were lower than expected. Wilford C. Wood then bought the majority of the remainder of the temple square in 1940, 1941, and 1951 and transferred it to Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The Corporation bought the remainder of the property with purchases in 1959, 1961 and 1962.

In 1999, church president Gordon B. Hinckley announced the rebuilding of the temple on its original footprint. After two years of construction, on June 27, 2002, the church dedicated the Nauvoo Illinois Temple, whose exterior is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern LDS temple.

==Architecture==
At its base the Nauvoo Temple was long and wide with a tower and weather vane reaching to . The second temple of the Latter Day Saint movement was built 60 percent larger in dimensions than its predecessor, the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, it had a full basement which housed a baptismal font.

===Exterior===
The limestone used for the original temple was quarried from a site just west of the temple. Much of that quarry, however, was submerged by rising water behind the Keokuk Dam in 1912. Therefore, Russellville, Alabama, subsidiary of Minnesota&#x27;s Vetter Stone Company, was chosen by the Church to provide stone for the new temple. Church officials say the quarry was selected because it provided stone that is a close match to the limestone originally used.

===Basement===

The basement of the Nauvoo Temple was used as the baptistry, containing a large baptismal font in the center of the main room.

The basement was accessed by spiral staircases at the northwest and southwest corners of the temple. The staircase landing was made of wood and opened to a short hallway heading east, leading to the basement proper. Between the two hallways was an unfinished room sealed off from the rest of the temple, containing an old well that had been dug but never used. The room was discovered by an anti-Mormon mob who broke through the floor of the vestibule above.

The basement proper was one hundred feet long and forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sizes on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With the exception of the two rooms at the western end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down to the center of the room to allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font.

During an archaeological investigation of the temple site, two highly polished limestone blocks were discovered. Approximately twelve feet east of the entrance to the baptistry and ten feet from either the side of the support piers rested the blocks, roughly fourteen inches square, which projected seven inches (178 mm) above the brick floor. These objects are not mentioned in any account of the basement, and their purpose is unknown. They may have held some type of support columns, dividing the font from the entrance to the basement, or they may simply have been a decorative element beneath a vase or something similar. They may have been part of a feature planned, but not used, in the final construction.

====The baptismal font====

Every visitor who wrote about the temple mentioned the baptismal font. It was clearly the most impressive feature of the temple. There were actually two fonts built during the lifetime of the temple, a temporary wooden one, and a permanent limestone one.

The first font was built out of tongue and grooved white pine and painted white. It was sixteen feet long, twelve feet wide and four feet deep. The lip of the font was seven feet from the floor. The font&#x27;s cap and base were carved molding in an &quot;antique style&quot; and the sides were finished with panel work. Two railed stairways led to the font from the north and south sides.

The font was held up by twelve oxen as are almost all temple fonts. They were carved from pine planking that was glued together. They were patterned from the most beautiful five-year-old steer that could be found in the region. The head, shoulders and legs protruded beyond the base of the font, and they appeared to have sunk to their knees into the pavement. The most perfect horn that could be found was used to model the animals&#x27; horns.

A decision was made to replace the wooden font in 1845, apparently because the water caused a mildew odor, and possibly because the wood had begun to rot. The new limestone font followed the pattern of the wooden one. Twelve oxen held up the basin, four on each side and two at each end. The oxen were solid stone and similarly were placed and appeared sunken into the floor. Where the oxen met the basin, the stone was carved to suggest drapery. The ears of the oxen were made of tin. The stairs were moved to an east/west orientation making access to the font easier.

A well on the east side of the font provided the water supply. There may have been some kind of tank at the eastern end of the baptistry to store and heat water.

===The vestibule===

A flight of eight broad steps led to a landing where two more steps entered three archways. These archways led to the vestibule, the formal entrance to the temple.
The archways were approximately nine feet wide and twenty-one feet high.

The vestibule itself was forty-three feet by seventeen feet in dimension. It was composed of limestone on all four of its walls. The floor has been speculated to be made of wood, because when the mob occupied the temple briefly in late 1847, they broke through the floor to reach a sealed off room in the basement. Had the floor been limestone, it seems unlikely that they would have dug it up.

Two large double doors on the east wall opened to the first floor assembly hall of the lower court, known as the &quot;Great Hall&quot;. Two doors, one on the North wall, and another on the South opened to the landing of two spiral staircases, one in the Northwest corner, and the other in the Southwest corner which led all the way to the attic. These were the only access points to the rest of the building.

One report stated that on the east wall of the vestibule was an entablature, similar to the one in the facade, which read in bright gilded letters, &quot;THE HOUSE OF THE LORD - Built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - Commenced April 6th, 1841 - HOLINESS TO THE LORD.&quot;

===The stairwells===
The two stairwells were constructed of dressed limestone walls. One rose from Northwest corner and the other at the Southwest corner of the temple. They were not true circles but were flatted on four sides. Nor were they symmetrical, being sixteen feet in diameter from East to West and seventeen feet in diameter from North to South. This was done to support landings and other support structures.

The staircases, made of wood, provided access to all of the temple from the basement to the attic with a landing at each floor. They had lamps for illumination at night, and had windows for daytime illumination. William Weeks&#x27; elevation of the front facade does not show windows at the basement level of the two stairwells, and photographic evidence is inconclusive. However, Joseph Smith&#x27;s youngest son, David Smith, rendered a painting of the temple&#x27;s damaged facade, clearly shows half-circular windows at the basement level in the north and south corners of the facade.

The staircase in the northwest corner was never completed. It was roughed in with temporary boards resting on the risers. Workmen used this staircase to gain access to the building during its construction, especially during the winter of 1845-1846 when persons were using the other staircase to reach the attic for ordinance work. The southwest staircase was completely finished for use. It included lamps for night illumination, and may have been carpeted near the attic landing.

===The Great Hall===
Entrance to the first floor assembly hall, called the &quot;Great Hall&quot;, was through two large double doors at the east end of the vestibule. The Great Hall occupied the remainder of the floor space East of the vestibule. The room was flanked on either side by seven large, arched windows, with four similar windows along the east wall. An arched ceiling spanned some fifty feet in breadth, in the center. the floor was stained wood and the walls were painted white.

There were two rooms to the north just past the entrance. It has been suggested that these rooms were used initially by William Weeks, because they are referred by Thomas Bullock as the &quot;architect&#x27;s room.&quot; Their eventual intended use is not clear.

====Pulpits====
At the east and west ends of the hall were two sets of similar pulpits. Resembling the pulpits used in the Kirtland Temple, and repeated in later temples, they were arranged with four levels, the top three consisting of a group of three semi-circular stands. The lowest level was a drop-table which was raised for use in the sacrament.

The pulpits to the east, standing between the windows, were reserved for the Melchizedek Priesthood. Accordingly, each pulpit had initials identifying the priesthood office of the occupant. The top most pulpits read &quot;P.H.P.&quot;, which stood for President of the High Priesthood. The next level down had &quot;P.S.Q&quot; for President of the Seventy Quorums. Below that, the labels were &quot;P.H.Q.&quot; which stood for President of the High priests Quorum, and the folding table had the inscription &quot;P.E.Q.&quot; standing for President of the Elders Quorum.

Above the Eastern pulpits, written in gilded letters, along the arch of the ceiling, were the words,&quot;The Lord Has Seen Our Sacrifice - Come After Us.&quot;

The pulpits to the West end were reserved for the Aaronic Priesthood. Each pulpit similarly had initials identifying the priesthood officers who occupied that stand. The highest three pulpits bore the initials &quot;P.A.P.&quot;, which stood for President of the Aaronic Priesthood. The next lower pulpits had &quot;P.P.Q.&quot;, for President of the Priests Quorum. Again, the next had &quot;P.T.Q.&quot;, for President of the Teachers Quorum and on the table at the bottom was written &quot;P.D.Q.&quot;, for President of the Deacons Quorum.

====Pews====
Similar to the Kirtland Temple, the hall was fitted with enclosed pews with two aisles running down its length. There were also pews for a band and choir. The room could accommodate up to 3,500 people. Because there were pulpits on both ends of the room, the pews had movable backs which could be swung to face either direction, depending on who was presiding - the Melchizedek Priesthood or the Aaronic Priesthood.

===First floor mezzanine===

Access to the first floor mezzanine was directly from landings of the two staircases in the west end of the building. A foyer, corresponding in size to the vestibule below, connected the two stairway landings.

Evidence suggests that this mezzanine had fourteen small rooms, seven along each side of the North and South wall. Each room had a small circular window supplying light. These rooms may never have been completed, except perhaps some kind of partition dividing them.

===Second floor assembly hall===
The second floor hall was similar in construction to the Great Hall, except that it included the foyer area where the vestibule would be. This made the room about seventeen feet longer. A stone arch ran north and south between the circular stairwells supporting the massive timbers for the tower above. It had seven large windows along the north and south wide, with four windows along the east wall.

The floor would have a similar configuration as the Great Hall with a set of double pulpits and pews, but the room was never completed. Doors were never hung, the plastering was unfinished, and the floorboards were only rough timber, not the tongue and grove finished hardwoods of the other floors. The room, when used for an occasional meeting, was furnished with wooden benches.

===Second floor mezzanine rooms===

The second mezzanine was similar to the first floor mezzanine. It was accessed via the two staircases at the West end of the building. There was no foyer connecting the two stairwells.

The second floor mezzanine is also presumed to have been divided into fourteen small rooms, seven rooms along each side of the North and South walls of the building, between the arched ceiling of the second floor. Circular windows in the entablature of the building allowed for illumination. Just as with the second floor assembly room, there is no evidence that these rooms were ever completed, except perhaps for the partitions dividing each room. There was a staircase in the second room from the Southeast corner leading to a room above, providing another access method to the attic.

===Attic===

At the top of the two stairways, opening to a foyer, was the attic floor. The attic was not built of limestone but of wood. It was composed of two sections. The West end of the temple was a flat roofed section that supported the tower. The rest of the attic was a pitched-roof section running the length of the temple.

The flat-room section was further divided into two sections, the foyer on the west side, and a suite of rooms to the east. When the attic was used for ordinance work, they were used as a pantry, wardrobe and storage rooms. The area was illuminated by six windows along the foyer&#x27;s west wall. Outside windows also provided light along the north and south sides. The roof had four octagonal skylight windows to provide light to the interior rooms, in addition to a twenty-foot arched window.

The incline of the roof prevented a six-foot-tall man from standing erect along the outside wall. The second room from the south-east corner had a stairway leading to a room in the mezzanine below.

===Tower rooms ===
Rising from the plateau of the attic is an octagonal tower. The tower was divided into three sections, each accessible by a series of stairways leading from the attic to an observation deck at the top. The lowest section was the belfry. The bell was rung for various occasions. Between the observation deck and the belfry was a section containing the four clockwork mechanisms.

<doc id="1210540" wikidata="Q1783875" url="?curid=1210540" title="Kootenay Lake">
<text>Kootenay Lake is a lake located in British Columbia, Canada. It is part of the Kootenay River. The lake has been raised by the Corra Linn Dam and has a dike system at the southern end, which, along with industry in the 1950s–70s, has changed the ecosystem in and around the water. The Kootenay Lake ferry is a year-round toll-free ferry that crosses between Kootenay Bay and Balfour. The lake is a popular summer tourist destination.

== Geography ==

Kootenay Lake is a long, narrow and deep fjord-like lake located between the Selkirk and Purcell mountain ranges in the Kootenay region of British Columbia. It is one of the largest lakes in British Columbia, at 104 km in length and 3–5 km in width. It is, in part, a widening of the Kootenay River, which in turn drains into the Columbia River system at Castlegar, British Columbia.

Although oriented primarily in a north-south configuration, a western arm positioned roughly halfway up the length of the lake stretches 35 km to the City of Nelson. The lake is 532m above sea level, with the adjacent mountains rising up to a maximum of approximately 2700m. The average residence for water in the lake is 1.5 years, although the west arm has a much faster rate of water replacement; about 3–4 days.


Kootenay Lake was formed through river erosion and, later, glaciation. The erosion began during the late Cretaceous until ice filled the resulting valley in the Pleistocene. When the valley was filled with ice, glaciers from the mountains (the Selkirks and Purcells) fed the valley&#x27;s ice mass. The glacier that occupied what is now the west arm of Kootenay Lake flowed into the Kootenay ice mass. As the ice melted from this glacier, drainage flowed over an area near what is now Nelson, causing the west arm of the lake to drain toward the west. A large moraine formed near what is now the large bend in the Kootenay River near Libby, Montana. As ice melted, a lake formed behind the moraine and drained southward over top of it. The southerly drainage over the moraine eventually stopped and the Kootenay River began to follow its present course.

Kootenay Lake is impounded by the Corra Lin Dam, some 30-35 miles downriver. Outflow rates there are (minimum discharge), (average discharge); (maximum discharge).

== History ==

Kootenay Lake is part of the traditional territory of the Sinixt and Ktunaxa peoples. These native populations used the lake and associated river systems as part of their seasonal migration and trading routes.

In 1958 the Kootenay Lake Crossing, an electrical power line, was built, running across the north arm of Kootenay Lake. It was destroyed in 1962 by protestors and rebuilt later that year.

The lake originally seasonally flooded an approximately 80 km long marsh lying to the lake&#x27;s south within the Creston Valley. However, this has now been diked and converted to commercial agriculture. A smaller wetland area has been protected in this area.

In 1931, Corra Linn Dam was built at the outflow from Kootenay Lake, where it once again became a river. The dam provides flood control and winter power generation by raising the normal water level by two meters. Just down river is Bonnington Falls, today the site of several hydroelectric dams. In 2003 the lake discharged 16.9 billion cubic metres of water. High water for that year was a normal 533 metres, the record is 537 metres in 1961. In 1967 as part of the Columbia River Treaty the Duncan Dam was constructed above Kootenay Lake on the Duncan River, creating a 7,145 hectare reservoir for flow control. Also part of the treaty Libby Dam in Montana was completed in 1975.

== Fauna ==

Kootenay Lake is populated with many species of fish, such as Rainbow trout, Bull Trout, Burbot, Mountain Whitefish, White Sturgeon, Brook Trout, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed sunfish and Kokanee Salmon.

There was a large decrease in the numbers of Kokanee in the west arm of the lake in the late 1970s. The salmon fishery was closed in 1980 and remains closed as of 2011. The reason for the decline is not known; possibilities include reduced numbers of Mysis relicta (which had been introduced as a food source for the Kokanee in 1949) into the west arm due to the increased control of water levels, the disruption of rearing habitat due to recurring drawdown of the lake, reduced productivity of benthos due to the reduction of the amount of nutrients into the lake (after the close of the fertilizer plant), overfishing in the 1960s to 1970s or competition between the Mysis relicta and immature fish. In 1990 the lake&#x27;s southern Kokanee stocks neared extinction, and an experimental fertilizing program was started, with some success.

==Human use and impact==

=== Settlements ===
Approximately 19,700 people live within of the Kootenay Lake shore; about 10,250 of those live in the City of Nelson. The remaining are scattered among a number of small towns and villages:

*Kuskonook, British Columbia
*Boswell, British Columbia
*Crawford Bay, British Columbia
*Ainsworth Hot Springs, British Columbia
*Kaslo, British Columbia
*Riondel, British Columbia
*Balfour, British Columbia
*Gray Creek, British Columbia
*Kootenay Bay, British Columbia
*Harrop, British Columbia
*Procter, British Columbia
*Sirdar, British Columbia

===Upstream Influences ===

In 1953 water quality in the lake was negatively affected when the Cominco phosphate fertilizer plant on the Kootenay River at Kimberley opened. Large quantities of phosphorus entered the Kootenay River; the cause of cyanobacterial blooms from the 1950s until the early 1970s. This plant closed in 1973 eliminating these phosphates. The construction of the Libby Dam on the Kootenai River in Montana and the Duncan Dam 1967 on the Duncan River, combined to further reduce natural phosphorus levels in the lake from the recorded highs.

=== Ferry ===
The lake is crossed by the Kootenay Lake ferry, a toll-free vehicular ferry operating between Balfour and Kootenay Bay. The ferry operates two boats in the summer and one during the winter.

<text>Sprewell Bluff Park, formerly Sprewell Bluff State Park, is a 1,372 acre (5.55 km2) Upson County, Georgia, park located between Roland and Crest. The park&#x27;s location on the Flint River makes it a popular place for swimming, fishing, kayaking, canoeing, and whitewater rafting. The park features a that winds along the bank of the river and up rocky bluffs, offering views of the park below.

==History==
The central river bluff was named after Jeptha Sprewell, a pioneer citizen. The park was part of The Heritage Trust Commission established by Governor Jimmy Carter in 1972. The commission was responsible for meeting the needs for recreational areas for the growing population. The park land is owned by Georgia Power Company. The State of Georgia originally leased the land in the 1990s as a State Park. In 2013, Upson County took over management of the property.

<doc id="1210552" wikidata="Q545260" url="?curid=1210552" title="Graeme Obree">
<text>Graeme Obree (born 11 September 1965), nicknamed &quot;the Flying Scotsman&quot;, after the famous steam train, is a Scottish racing cyclist who twice broke the world hour record, in July 1993 and April 1994, and was the individual pursuit world champion in 1993 and 1995. He was known for his unusual riding positions and for the &quot;Old Faithful&quot; bicycle he built which included parts from a washing machine. He joined a professional team in France but was fired before his first race. He also competed in the men&#x27;s individual pursuit at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Obree has created some radical innovations in bicycle design and cycling position but has had problems with the cycling authorities banning the riding positions his designs required. Obree has been very open about living with bipolar disorder and depression, and the fact that he has attempted suicide three times, using his experiences as a means of encouraging other sportspeople to talk about their own mental health.

His life and exploits have been dramatised in the 2006 film &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot; and more recently in the documentary film &quot;Battle Mountain: Graeme Obree&#x27;s Story&quot;, which follows his journey to Battle Mountain, Nevada to compete in the 2013 World Human Powered Speed Championships.

In March 2010, he was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.

==Biography==

===Origins===
Obree was born in Nuneaton, a large town in northern Warwickshire, England, but has lived almost all his life in Scotland and considers himself Scottish.

He attempted suicide in his teens by gassing himself. He was saved by his father, who had returned early from work.

An individual time triallist, his first race was a 10-mile time trial to which he turned up wearing shorts, anorak and Doc Marten boots. He thought the start and finish were at the same place and stopped where he had started, 100 metres short of the end. He had started to change his clothes when officials told him to continue. He still finished in &quot;about 30 minutes.&quot;

The bike shop that he ran failed and he decided the way out of his problems was to attack the world hour velodrome record. It had been held for nine years by Francesco Moser, at 51.151 kilometres. Obree said:

:The record had fascinated me since Moser broke it. It was the ultimate test – no traffic, one man in a velodrome against the clock. I didn&#x27;t tell myself that I will &quot;attempt&quot; the record, I said I would &quot;break&quot; it. When your back is against the wall, you can say it&#x27;s bad or you can say: &#x27;I&#x27;ll go for it.&#x27; I decided, that&#x27;s it, I&#x27;ve as good as broken the record.

===Old Faithful ===
Obree had built frames for his bike shop and made another for his record attempt. Instead of traditional dropped handlebars it had straight bars like those of a mountain bike. He placed them closer to the saddle than usual and rode with the bars under his chest, his elbows bent and tucked into his sides like those of a skier. Watching a washing machine spin at 1,200rpm led him to take the bearings, which he assumed must be of superior quality, and fit them to his bike. Obree later regretted admitting to the bearings experiment, because journalists referred to that before his achievements and other innovations.

Obree called his bike &quot;Old Faithful&quot;. It has a narrow bottom bracket, around which the cranks revolve, to bring his legs closer together (giving a smaller Q factor), as he thought this is the &quot;natural&quot; position. As shown in the film, he thought a tread of &quot;one banana&quot; would be ideal. The bike has no top tube, so that his knees did not hit the frame. The chainstays are not parallel to the ground. Thus the cranks can pass with a narrow bottom bracket. The fork had only one blade, carefully shaped to be as narrow as possible. A French writer who tried it said the narrow handlebars made it hard to accelerate the machine in a straight line but, once it was at speed, he could hold the bars and get into Obree&#x27;s tucked style.

:&quot;At a high enough speed, [I could] tuck in my arms. And, above all, get in a very forward position on the bike, on the peak of the saddle. The Obree position isn&#x27;t advantageous simply aerodynamically, it also allows, by pushing the point of pedalling towards the rear, to benefit from greater pressure while remaining in the saddle. You soon get an impression of speed, all the greater because you&#x27;ve got practically nothing [&quot;deux fois rien&quot;] between your hands. Two other things I noticed after a few hundred metres: I certainly didn&#x27;t have the impression of turning 53 × 13, and the Obree position is no obstruction to breathing. But I wasn&#x27;t pedalling at 55 km/h, 100 turns of the pedals a minute, yet my arms already hurt.&quot;

=== Taking the record ===
Obree attacked Moser&#x27;s record, on 16 July 1993, at the Vikingskipet velodrome in Norway. He failed by nearly a kilometre. He had booked the track for 24 hours and decided to come back the next day. The writer Nicholas Roe said:

:To stop his aching body seizing up, Obree then took the unusual measure of drinking pint upon pint of water so that he had to wake up to go to the lavatory every couple of hours through the night. Each time he got up, he stretched his muscles. On the next weary day, he was up and out within minutes, at the deserted velodrome by 7:55 am and on the track ready to start just five minutes after that. He had barely slept. He had punished his body hugely the previous day. Surely this was a waste of time?

Obree said:

:I was Butch Cassidy in terms of swagger. I didn&#x27;t want any negativity. This was blitzkrieg. I&#x27;m going in there. Let me do it. I&#x27;m not going to be the timorous guy from Scotland. That&#x27;s what the difference was. Purely mental state. The day before, I had been a mouse. Now I was a lion.

On 17 July 1993, Obree set a new record of 51.596 kilometres, beating Moser&#x27;s record of 51.151 kilometres by 445 metres.

===Losing the record===
Obree&#x27;s triumph lasted less than a week. On 23 July 1993, the British Olympic champion, Chris Boardman broke Obree&#x27;s record by 674 metres, riding 52.270 km at Bordeaux. His bike had a carbon monocoque frame, carbon wheels, and a triathlon handlebar. Their rivalry grew: a few months later Obree knocked Boardman out of the world championship pursuit to take the title himself.

===Regaining the record===
Francesco Moser, whose record Obree had beaten, adopted Obree&#x27;s riding position—adding a chest pad—and established not an outright world record but a veterans&#x27; record of 51.84 kilometres. He did it on 15 January 1994, riding in the thin air of Mexico City as he had for his outright record, whereas Obree and Boardman had ridden at close to sea level.

Obree retook the record on 27 April 1994, using the track that Boardman had used at Bordeaux. He had bolted his shoes to his pedals, to avoid what had happened in the final of the national pursuit championship, when he pulled his foot off the pedal during his starting effort.

He rode 52.713 kilometres, a distance beaten on 2 September 1994 by the Spanish Tour de France winner, Miguel Induráin.

===Old Faithful banned===
The world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale, grew concerned that changes to bicycles were making a disproportionate influence to track records. Among other measures, it banned his riding position: he did not find out until one hour before he began the world championship pursuit in Italy. Judges disqualified him when he refused to comply. The magazine &quot;Cycling Weekly&quot; blamed &quot;petty-minded officialdom.&quot;

Obree developed another riding position, the &quot;Superman&quot; style, his arms fully extended in front, and he won the individual pursuit at the world championships with this and Old Faithful in 1995. That position was also banned. However, in May 2014 the UCI relented, acknowledging that fixing the kind of equipment to be used was hindering technical progress. It restored previous banned world records, from 2000, now to be described as &quot;Best hour performance&quot;.

The original &quot;Old Faithful&quot; bike is on display at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, while two near-replicas built for use in the &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; film are displayed in the Riverside Transport Museum in Glasgow.

In March 2018, Obree tested another replica of &quot;Old Faithful&quot; in the Mercedes-Benz F1 team&#x27;s wind tunnel to gauge the aerodynamic efficiency of his various riding positions on the bike, having never previously participated in wind-tunnel testing. It was found that the (drag coefficient) of Obree&#x27;s initial &quot;tuck&quot; or &quot;crouch&quot; position was 0.17, compared to a conventional 1990s bike position of 0.20 and a modern conventional position of 0.188, leading to an estimated gain in speed of about 2-2.5 km/h over his rivals in the 1990s and a gain of 1.5 km/h over contemporary track cyclists: meanwhile the &quot;Superman&quot; position was found only to be marginally more efficient than the 1990s conventional position, and less efficient than the modern conventional position. Obree however noted that the discomfort of the &quot;crouch&quot; position takes a lot of energy out of the rider through holding the hands and shoulders in place, whilst the &quot;Superman&quot; position was much more manageable.

===Other achievements===
Obree was individual pursuit world champion in 1993 and 1995. He broke the British 10-mile individual time trial record in 1993, won the RTTC 50-mile championship the same year (a record 1h 39m 1s), and won the 25-mile championship in 1996. In 1997 he joined forces with coach Joe Beer and clocked 18m 36s in a 10-mile time trial (V718 Hull) and next day won the British Cycling Federation 25-mile championship - this was part of building towards an hour record attempt that was eventually shelved.

The writer Peter Bryan, of &quot;The Times&quot;, said:

&quot;To see Obree in full flight, shoulders hunched and elbows tucked into his ribs, is a memorable sight. His face contorted with pain illustrates the effort he is putting in. And yet, not too many minutes after he has finished a ride the champion is sufficiently relaxed to talk with a queue of pressmen.&quot;

===Professional career===
Obree rode his hour records as an amateur. He took a professional licence after winning his first world championship, telling Bryan: &quot;I reckon I can make more money on the bike than I get from unemployment benefit.&quot;

He joined Le Groupement, a French team but did not attend a meeting in Les Carroz d&#x27;Arâches (fr) and was fired for &quot;lack of professionalism.&quot; Obree had been racing in Florida when the team first met. But he was on holiday there when the team met again for publicity photographs. He got to the next get-together but flew to Paris instead of Lille, where the meeting was held.

The team manager, Patrick Valcke, said:

:&quot;If a rider has that attitude, it&#x27;s best to stop working together as soon as possible. We paid for his tickets [to fly from Glasgow to Geneva] and he didn&#x27;t even turn up, didn&#x27;t even phone to explain why he was not coming. He said that he did not want to leave his family so soon after the death of his brother (&quot;see below&quot;) but he could have phoned to tell us that. I don&#x27;t want any more to do with him.&quot;

Obree said: &quot;I was too ill to attend the get-together and had no success when I attempted to contact team officials on 1 January. My wife, Anne, who is a nurse, insisted I was not well enough to travel to France.&quot;

The Le Groupement team fell apart after a short time, when the sponsoring company was involved in scandal, with accusations that it was nothing but a pyramid selling scheme. Some of the team members claimed that they were owed money, and their wages had not been paid.

===Attitude to doping===
Obree said of his short professional career:

:&quot;I still feel I was robbed of part of my career. I was signed up to ride in the prologue of the Tour back in 1995, but it was made very obvious to me I would have to take drugs. I said no, no way, and I was sacked by my team. So there I was, 11 years later, sitting there waiting for the Tour cyclists to come by, and something welled up in me. I feel I was robbed by a lot of these bastards taking drugs. I also hate the way that people think anyone who has ever achieved anything on a bike must have been taking drugs. I was surprised how resentful I felt when I was in Paris. It had obviously been simmering away in there for years. That&#x27;s something new I&#x27;ll have to talk to my therapist about.&quot;

In 1996, he told the magazine &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;:

:&quot;In my opinion, 99 percent of riders at elite level take EPO or a similar drug, not particularly to dope themselves but to be at the same level as the others. And that&#x27;s rather sad.&quot;

===New Hour record attempt===
In May 2009, Obree announced that he would make an attempt at the &quot;Athlete&#x27;s Hour&quot; record on a bike he had built himself during 2009. Obree said in October 2009 that the attempt had been cancelled as the bike he&#x27;d built himself was not suitable for the conditions. He will not be attempting this again.

In December 2009, he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame while in March 2010, he was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.

===Human-powered vehicle land speed record===

In December 2011, Obree announced that he would make an attempt at the human-powered vehicle (HPV) land speed record, hoping to hit 100 mph. In May 2012, he revealed that the bike he is building for this attempt is a prone bike.
The attempt was originally to take place in Britain, and the record speed was then . However, he competed in the 2013 World Human Powered Speed Championships in Battle Mountain, Nevada, where the record was also set. He achieved a speed of on the morning of Friday, 13 September.

While Obree did not break the HPV land speed record, he did set a new record for a rider in the prone position. The previous day, Obree had set a speed of , which was a record speed in the prone position on a two-wheeled HPV (the overall prone record being held by a trike).

===Personal life ===
Obree&#x27;s achievements on the bike, his personal life and battle with mental health have combined to make him one of cycling&#x27;s most enigmatic and eccentric figures. The Scotsman claimed both the World Individual Pursuit title in 1993 and 1995 however is well known for his attempts at the World hour record.

In the 1990s he took an overdose of aspirin washed down by water from a puddle. He had personality problems, sniffed the gas he used to weld bicycles, and was being chased for £492 owed in college fees. Obree&#x27;s brother, Gordon, died in a car crash in October 1994, and Obree again slid in and out of depression. In 2001 he was found unconscious at Bellsland Farm in Kilmaurs, 12 km from his Ayrshire home. The Obree family horse was stabled there and he was discovered by a woman checking a barn. He had tried to hang himself.

Obree is divorced from his wife, with whom he has two children.

In January 2011, Obree disclosed in an interview with the &quot;Scottish Sun&quot; that he is gay and that his difficulty with coming to terms with his sexual orientation contributed to his earlier suicide attempts. &quot;I was brought up by a war generation; they grew up when gay people were put in jail. Being homosexual was so unthinkable that you just wouldn&#x27;t be gay. I&#x27;d no inkling about anything, I just closed down.&quot; He came out to his family in 2005. Obree suffers from bipolar disorder.

He continues to race occasionally in individual time trials for Ayrshire-based Fullarton Wheelers cycling club. In May 2005, he crashed in the rain in the national 10-mile time trial championship near Nantwich in Cheshire. He was a member of the winning three-man club squad that took the team title in the Scottish 10-mile championship in May 2006. In December 2006, he competed in the track event, Revolution 15, in a four kilometre pursuit challenge.

== Book and films ==
He published his autobiography in 2003 titled &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot;. He said: &quot;It started with the psychologist saying it would do me good and ended up as my life story.&quot; A film based on the book premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2006, starring Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Boyd. In November 2006 Metro-Goldwyn Mayer bought world distribution rights and the film was released in the US on 29 December 2006; it was given a UK release on 29 June 2007. The DVD was released in the UK on 5 November 2007.

&quot;Battle Mountain: Graeme Obree&#x27;s Story&quot;, a documentary film about Obree&#x27;s appearance at the 2013 World Human Powered Speed Championships in Battle Mountain, Nevada, premiered at the 2015 Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film, directed by David Street with music by Alun Woodward of Chemikal Underground, went on public release on 21 March 2016, with a tour of cinemas featuring a question-and-answer session with Obree following screenings. The film was crowdfunded through the Kickstarter website.

<doc id="1210559" wikidata="Q1135111" url="?curid=1210559" title="Professional Squash Association">
<text>The Professional Squash Association, aka PSA&quot;,&quot; is the governing body for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s professional squash circuit. The body operates in a similar fashion to the ATP and the WTA for tennis. The PSA&#x27;s highest professional level, the PSA World Tour involves over 250 tournaments annually around the world. Over 1,200 players from five continents and more than 60 are registered with the PSA. Rankings are updated weekly based on performances.

==Squash Tour==
&quot;PSA Squash Tour&quot; comprises the most important tournaments in prize money for more experienced and higher-ranked players, including the World Championship and Tour Finals, labelled as following:

* Diamond Tier: 48-player draws for $300,000
*Platinum Tier: 48-player draws for $190,000
*Gold Tier: 24-player draws for $100,000
*Silver Tier: 24-player draws for $75,000
*Bronze Tier: 24-player draws for $50,000 
*Copper Tier: 24-player draws for $25,000 

Every year, the top eight performers compete in the PSA Squash Tour Finals. The players are separated into two groups of four, and play a round robin. The top two from each group advance to the semifinals (A1 vs B2; B1 vs A2). The winner of the event is crowned the World Tour champion.

==Challenger Tour==
&quot;PSA Challenger Tour&quot; tournaments are entry point for young and upcoming professionals progressing through to a more international level of competition. It offers $3,000–$30,000 prize money and is the ideal circuit for less-experienced and upcoming players.

*PSA Challenger 30 — $30,000
*PSA Challenger 20 — $20,000
*PSA Challenger 15 — $15,000
*PSA Challenger 12 — $12,000
*PSA Challenger 9 — $9,000
*PSA Challenger 6 — $6,000
*PSA Challenger 3 — $3,000

==Satellite Tour==
&quot;PSA Satellite Tour&quot; comprises closed national championships or tournaments where entry is restricted to members of an association that promotes the tournament.

==Background==
In January 2013, the PSA announced, along with U.S. Squash, the creation of a new tournament series called the US Pro Squash Series. This tournament series is used to support marketing activities for tournaments in the United States.

In November 2014, the WSA and the PSA announced a historic merger between the two associations. A decision was reached to designate the PSA operate as the governing body for both the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s ranks from 1 January 2015.

On 7 December 2020 the PSA reached an agreement with Dunlop that extends Dunlop&#x27;s tenure as the provider of official balls and official racquets for the PSA. The extension is three years.

==World rankings==
PSA publishes weekly rankings of professional players: PSA World Rankings (commonly known as the ‘World rankings’).

<doc id="1210560" wikidata="Q5677604" url="?curid=1210560" title="Harvey Smith (Canadian politician)">
<text>Harvey Smith (November 6, 1936 – March 12, 2017) was a Canadian politician who served on Winnipeg&#x27;s city council and in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly.

He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, grew up in Winnipeg and first became involved in politics at the age of twelve. He joined the British Columbia Social Credit Party when it was still a fringe organization.

Smith obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and history from the University of British Columbia, a Bachelor of Education from Simon Fraser University and worked as a teacher in Birtle, Manitoba. He sought the Progressive Conservative nomination for a February 1969 provincial by-election in the Birtle-Russell electoral division, but lost to Harry Graham. He later became involved with the New Democratic Party (NDP). He was elected to the Winnipeg City Council in 1980 for the division of Sargent Park, retaining his seat until 1986.

In the provincial election of 1986, Smith was elected in the Winnipeg riding of Ellice, defeating Progressive Conservative Seech Gajadharsingh by over 2,000 votes. He was not appointed to the cabinet of Howard Pawley, and lost to Liberal Avis Gray by 724 votes in the 1988 election.

In 1998, Smith came out of political retirement to run for the Winnipeg City Council again, representing the Daniel McIntyre Ward on city council. In 2002, he was re-elected over Maureen Pendergast by almost 3000 votes. Despite being the incumbent candidate, Smith lost the endorsement of the NDP going into the 2010 civic election in favour of Pat Martin&#x27;s constituency assistant Keith Bellamy. Smith decided to contest this decision and ran as an independent in the 2010 Winnipeg civic election. On October 27, 2010, Smith won a narrow victory over four other candidates and retained his seat as councillor for the Daniel McIntyre ward.

In 2004, he filled out the NDP nomination forms for a provincial by-election in the riding of Minto, but soon withdrew from the race. In the city council election of October 22, 2014, he lost to Cindy Gilroy.

Smith died on March 12, 2017, at the age of 80 following a brief illness. He was not married and did not have any children.

<text>Watson Mill Bridge State Park is a Georgia state park located near Comer and Carlton on the South Fork of the Broad River. The park is named for the Watson Mill Bridge the longest original-site covered bridge in Georgia, which spans across the South Fork of the Broad River. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Watson Mill Covered Bridge and Mill Historic District. The bridge, built in 1885, is supported by a Town lattice truss system held together with wooden pegs also known as trunnels. Georgia once had over 200 covered bridges, but only 20 now remain.

<text>John de Monins Johnson (1882–1956) was an English papyrologist, printer of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, and collector.

==Biography==
Johnson was born in Lincolnshire in England, the second son of John Henry Johnson and Anna Braithwaite née Savory. He attended Magdalen College School, Oxford and then earned a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford. He studied the classics and Arabic in preparation for a career in the Egyptian Civil Service. In Egypt, he became a papyrologist, discovering a papyrus of Theocritus that was 900 years older than any such previously discovered manuscript.

Johnson returned to Oxford during World War I, physically unfit for military service. He became Assistant Secretary to the Delegates of Oxford University Press. In 1918, he married Dorothea, the daughter of his supervisor Charles Cannan. They had a son whom they named Charles, and a daughter, Paulla. In 1925, Johnson became Printer at the University of Oxford, and in 1928, he was awarded an Honorary D. Litt for his work on the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

During World War II, in addition to his printing responsibilities, he became responsible for security at Oxford University Press, living on-site until his retirement in 1946. During that time, he became a collector of what he called &quot;printed ephemera&quot;, establishing &quot;The Constance Meade Memorial Collection of Ephemeral Printing&quot; at Oxford University Press. Johnson&#x27;s definition of printed ephemera was &quot;Everything which would ordinarily go into the wastepaper basket after use, everything printed which is not actually a book.&quot; He continued to build up the collection until his death. In 1968 the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library, where it is now known as the &quot;John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera&quot;; the collection has been substantially enlarged since its acquisition by the Bodleian, and continues to grow.

<text>The Minister of Munitions was a British government position created during the First World War to oversee and co-ordinate the production and distribution of munitions for the war effort. The position was created in response to the Shell Crisis of 1915 when there was much newspaper criticism of the shortage of artillery shells and fear of sabotage. The Ministry was created by the Munitions of War Act 1915 passed on 2 July 1915 to safeguard the supply of artillery munitions. Under the very vigorous leadership of Liberal party politician David Lloyd George, the Ministry in its first year set up a system that dealt with labour disputes and fully mobilized Britain&#x27;s capacity for a massive increase in the production of munitions.

The government policy, according to historian J. A. R. Marriott, was that:
: No private interest was to be permitted to obstruct the service, or imperil the safety, of the State. Trade Union regulations must be suspended; employers&#x27; profits must be limited, skilled men must fight, if not in the trenches, in the factories; man-power must be economized by the dilution of labour and the employment of women; private factories must pass under the control of the State, and new national factories be set up. Results justified the new policy: the output was prodigious; the goods were at last delivered.

==Wartime role==
David Lloyd George gained a heroic reputation with his energetic work as Minister of Munitions, from 1915 to 1916, setting the stage for his political rise. When the Shell Crisis of 1915 dismayed public opinion, with the news that the Army was running short of artillery ammunition, demands arose for a strong leader to take charge of munitions production. A new coalition ministry was formed in May 1915 and Lloyd George was made Minister of Munitions, in a new department created to solve the munitions shortage.

In this position David Lloyd George addressed labour disputes on the Clyde, concerning lowering of wages by &#x27;dilution&#x27; of skilled labour, and he called for an enquiry into the conditions of munitions workers that led to labour intelligence services being transferred to his Ministry, under Colonel Arthur Lee, Parliamentary Military Secretary. He received acclaim for a big rise in output of munitions, which greatly contributed to his political ascent to Prime Minister in late 1916 and leadership of the five man War Cabinet. Many historians agree that he boosted national morale and focused attention on the urgent need for greater output but many also say the increase in munitions output from 1915 to 1916 was due largely to reforms already decided, though not yet effective, before he arrived. American historian R. J. Q. Adams provided details that showed that the Ministry broke through the cumbersome bureaucracy of the War Office, resolved labour problems, rationalized the supply system and dramatically increased production. Within a year it became the largest buyer, seller and employer in Britain.

To improve efficiency and public relations the Ministry opened a department focused on workers&#x27; welfare. It improved first aid conditions; promoted factory safety; handled medical conditions induced by the handling of dangerous chemicals and TNT; provided day care for children; limited overtime; and sometimes provided transportation and lodging for workers.

The Ministry was staffed at the top levels by senior army men and businessmen loaned by their companies for the duration of the war. These men were able to coordinate the needs of big business with those of the state and reach a compromise on price and profits. Government agents bought essential supplies from abroad. Once bought, the Ministry would control their distribution in order to prevent speculative price rises and to enable normal marketing to continue. The whole of the Indian jute crop, for example, was bought and distributed in this way. Steel, wool, leather and flax came under similar controls. By 1918 the Ministry had a staff of 65,000 people, employing some 3 million workers in over 20,000 factories with large numbers of women new to engineering work for the duration of the war. The post was abolished in 1921, as part of a cutback of government and as a delayed result of the Armistice in 1918.

<doc id="1210587" wikidata="Q5542845" url="?curid=1210587" title="George Neville, Duke of Bedford">
<text>George Neville, Duke of Bedford (1465 – 4 May 1483) was an English nobleman, a scion of the House of Neville. At birth, he was likely heir to great wealth, but due to the political failure of his father and uncle, he inherited very little.

He was the son of John Neville, Earl of Northumberland (and later Marquess Montagu) and a nephew of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick. George&#x27;s mother was Isobel Ingoldsthorpe, only daughter and heiress of Sir Edmund Ingoldsthorpe and Joan Tiptoft.

At birth, George was the likely or possible heir to considerable property. Most definite were the property of his father&#x27;s earldom, his mother&#x27;s Ingoldsthorpe estates, and the more modest jointure of his parents. The latter two were by themselves sufficient to support a baron. He was also heir presumptive (after his father) to the Neville estates of his uncle Warwick. These were entailed to heirs male and the earl had only daughters. Finally, George was likely to inherit (after his mother and grandmother) a third share of the Tiptoft property held by his childless grand-uncle, John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester, whose sister and heiress Joan was George&#x27;s maternal grandmother. These inheritances altogether would yield around 4,000 pounds a year, comparable to the 4,500 pounds annual income of the Duke of Clarence, the king&#x27;s brother and the greatest magnate of the time.

George Neville was made Duke of Bedford in 1470, as the intended husband of Elizabeth of York. The title had lain unused since John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, died on 14 September 1435. However, his father and his uncle Warwick rebelled against King Edward IV the following year and were slain in battle. An act of attainder was never passed against them, but George received no inheritance from them or from his maternal ancestors. An act of Parliament in 1475 gave the Neville inheritance in the north of England to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, husband of one of Warwick&#x27;s daughters. George had a half-interest in the estates of his maternal grandfather, Sir Edmund Ingoldsthorpe, and his maternal grandmother, Joan Tiptoft.

Shortly before he came of age in 1478 he was denied the title of duke by act of Parliament, ostensibly for lack of money to maintain the style of a duke. The title was subsequently given to the infant George of York, the third son of Edward IV.

<doc id="1210589" wikidata="Q1138796" url="?curid=1210589" title="Sy Oliver">
<text>Melvin James &quot;Sy&quot; Oliver (December 17, 1910 – May 28, 1988) was an American jazz arranger, trumpeter, composer, singer and bandleader.

== Life ==
Sy Oliver was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, United States. His mother was a piano teacher, and his father was a multi-instrumentalist, who demonstrated saxophones at a time when instrument was seldom played other than by marching bands.

Oliver left home at 17 to play with Zack Whyte and his Chocolate Beau Brummels and later with Alphonse Trent. He sang and played trumpet with these bands, becoming known for his &quot;growling&quot; horn playing. He also began arranging with them.

He continued singing for the next 17 years, making many recordings when he was with Jimmie Lunceford and with his own band. With Lunceford, from 1933 to 1939, he recorded more than two dozen vocals. From 1949 to 1951, he recorded more than a dozen with his band. With Tommy Dorsey, he recorded very few vocals. In 1941, he sang with Jo Stafford, on his own compositions &quot;Yes Indeed&quot; and &quot;Swingin&#x27; on Nothin&#x27;&quot;. He also sang with The Sentimentalists on the 1944 recording of his arrangement of &quot;Chicago&quot;.

Oliver arranged and conducted many songs for Ella Fitzgerald from her Decca years. As a composer, one of his most famous songs was &quot;T&#x27;ain&#x27;t What You Do (It&#x27;s the Way That You Do It)&quot;, which he co-wrote with Trummy Young in 1939.

In 1933, Oliver joined Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s band as a trumpet player, arranger and songwriter. He contributed many hit arrangements for the band, including &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot;, as well as his original composition &quot;For Dancers Only&quot;, which eventually became the band&#x27;s theme song. He was co-arranger with pianist Ed Wilcox; Oliver primarily taking the up-tempo numbers, Wilcox the ballads. Oliver&#x27;s arrangements &quot;were a dashing parade of innovation that rivaled Ellington&#x27;s for consistency and originality.&quot;

In 1939, when band leader Tommy Dorsey decided he wanted a swing band, his first step was to hire Oliver as an arranger away from Lunceford for $5,000 more a year. Oliver then became one of the first African Americans with a prominent role in a white band when he joined Tommy Dorsey. (Fletcher Henderson, another African American composer/arranger, had joined the Benny Goodman orchestra as the arranger a few years earlier.) He led the transition of the Dorsey band from Dixieland to modern big band. His joining was instrumental in Dorsey luring several jazz players, including Buddy Rich, to his band.

With Dorsey, Oliver continued sharing arranging duties with other arrangers, primarily Axel Stordahl, Oliver doing up-tempo tunes, Stordahl ballads. As James Kaplan put it, &quot;Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s band got a rocket boost in 1939 when Dorsey stole Lunceford&#x27;s great arranger Sy Oliver.&quot;

His arrangement of &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; was a big hit for Dorsey in 1946, as were his compositions &quot;Yes, Indeed!&quot; (a gospel-jazz tune that was later recorded by Ray Charles), &quot;Opus One&quot; (originally titled as &quot;Opus No. 1&quot;, but changed to suit the lyric that was added later), &quot;The Minor Is Muggin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Well, Git It&quot;.

Oliver left Dorsey after seven years, in 1946, and began working as a freelance arranger and as music director for Decca.

On June 26, 1950, Sy Oliver and his Orchestra recorded the first American version of &quot;C&#x27;est si bon&quot; (Henri Betti, André Hornez, Jerry Seelen) and &quot;La Vie en rose&quot; (Louiguy, Édith Piaf, Mack David) for Louis Armstrong. One of his more successful efforts as an arranger was the 1961 Frank Sinatra album, &quot;I Remember Tommy&quot;, a combined tribute to their former boss.

In 1974, he began a nightly gig with a small band at the Rainbow Room in New York. He continued that gig until 1984, with occasionally time off to make festival or other dates, including at the Roseland Ballroom in New York. He retired in 1984.

Oliver died in New York City at the age of 77.

<text>Come As You Are is the second solo album by Peter Wolf, released in 1987 (see 1987 in music). &quot;Come As You Are&quot; was a major hit for Wolf, peaking at #15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for one week.

The music video for &quot;Come As You Are&quot; is based on Bobby Van&#x27;s memorable &quot;street dance&quot; from &quot;Small Town Girl&quot;. In the video, Peter Wolf hops around a 1950s small town similar to the one in the movie, and he passes a poster for &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; as a direct reference to the inspiration for the video.

<text>Place Jacques-Cartier (, &quot;Jacques Cartier Square&quot;) is a square located in Old Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is an entrance to the Old Port of Montreal.

==Overview==
In 1723, the Château Vaudreuil was built for Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil - its formal gardens occupying the space that is now the square. The Chateau burned down in 1803 and it was suggested by The Hon. Jean-Baptiste Durocher and The Hon. Joseph Périnault that the space be transformed into a public square, known as New Market Place. In 1809, Montreal&#x27;s oldest public monument was raised there, Nelson&#x27;s Column. In 1847, the square was renamed in honour of Jacques Cartier, the explorer who claimed Canada for France in 1535.

The broad, divided street slopes steeply downhill from Montreal City Hall and rue Notre-Dame to the waterfront and rue de la Commune. During the high tourist season, the street hosts many street artists and kiosks. During the Christmas season, the street is lined with lighted trees. At any time of year, one can find restaurants on both sides of the street and many more on the surrounding streets of Vieux Port, notably on Rue Saint-Paul.

It is a car-free zone in the summer. During the summer season, &quot;Jardin Nelson&quot; offers a garden restaurant on Place Jacques-Cartier. Other restaurants similarly offer classical Parisian-style &quot;terraces&quot; for taking a drink or dining in the open air. And on the other side of the place, the famous restaurant Saint-Amable (the oldest restaurant in town) welcomes Montreal celebrities and locals in a crooner jazz atmosphere.

Near Place Jacques-Cartier on rue de la Commune, an original piece of the wall of the old fortified city can still be seen in the basement restaurant of the Auberge du Vieux-Port. At the upper end of the Place stands Nelson&#x27;s Column, built in memory of Admiral Horatio Nelson. The statue was removed in 1997 to preserve it from the weather, and was subsequently replaced with a copy.

<text>Bihwa Gaya, also known as Bijabal in Japanese records of the time, was one of the member states of the Gaya confederacy during the Three Kingdoms period of Korea. It was based near the modern-day city center of Changnyeong County in South Gyeongsang province, South Korea. It was conquered by Silla in the 6th century AD, some time before 555.

Bihwa Gaya is mentioned in the &quot;Goryeo Saryak&quot; and under the name in the Japanese chronicle &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;. It may have arisen from the 3rd century Jinhan state of Bulsaguk (불사국, 不斯國) which was probably also located in modern-day Changnyeong. Archeological evidence suggests a close relationship between Bihwa Gaya and nearby Silla, although as part of the Gaya confederacy, Bihwa would frequently have been at war with Silla.

The royal tombs of Bihwa Gaya are located in Gyo-dong, Changnyeong-eup, in Changnyeong County. Some of these tombs were excavated during the colonial period in 1918, but all records of that excavation have since been lost. In 1973, a team of researchers from Busan&#x27;s Dong-A University excavated several remaining tombs. These tombs appear to have been constructed in the 5th century AD. Some of them show indications of the live burial of members of the royal household. In 1996, a museum focusing on the relics of the Bihwa Gaya period opened adjacent to the tombs.

<text>Mykhailo Yuriyovych Brodsky () (born April 5, 1959 in Kyiv) is a Ukrainian politician, leader of the Party of Free Democrats and businessman.

==Biography==
Brodsky was a self-nominated candidate in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. Chair of the &quot;Yabluko&quot; (&quot;Apple&quot;) Party in 2003–2005. 

He was a national deputy (member of Parliament) of Ukraine from 1998–2002. He was a chair of the publishing house &quot;Kyivskie Vedmosti&quot; in 1998, but lost control of it after being jailed on corruption charges. Main policy is opposition to &quot;oligarchs&quot;, and declared when registering that he was running for president in 2004 to bar (then) Prime Minister of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, from power. 

Brodskyy allied himself with Yulia Tymoshenko before and during the Orange Revolution (in 2006 he was elected as a deputy of the Kyiv City Council representing the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc), but broke with her before the snap parliamentary elections of September 2007.

<text>The Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant, also Guri Dam ( or &quot;Represa de Guri&quot;), previously known as the Raúl Leoni Hydroelectric Plant, is a concrete gravity and embankment dam in Bolívar State, Venezuela, on the Caroni River, built from 1963 to 1969. It is 7,426 metres long and 162 m high. It impounds the large Guri Reservoir (&quot;Embalse de Guri&quot;) with a surface area of .

The Guri Reservoir that supplies the dam is one of the largest on earth. The hydroelectric power station was once the largest worldwide in terms of installed capacity, replacing Grand Coulee HPP, but was surpassed by Brazil and Paraguay&#x27;s Itaipu.

==History and design==

Technical and economic feasibility studies were begun in 1961, conducted by the Harza Engineering Company. An international consortium of six firms was awarded the contract for the construction of the plant, including four United States companies participating under the Alliance for Progress. In 1963, construction began for the hydroelectric power station Guri in the Necuima Canyon, about 100 kilometers upstream from the mouth of the Caroní River in the Orinoco. By 1969, a 106 m high and 690 m long dam with the official name of &quot;Central Hidroeléctrica Simón Bolívar&quot; (previously named &quot;Central Hidroeléctrica Raúl Leoni&quot; from 1978 to 2000) had been built. It created a reservoir which is the largest fresh water body of water in Venezuela and one of the largest man-made blackwater lakes ever created, with its water level at 215 metres above sea level. The power station had a combined installed capacity of 1750 megawatts (MW). By 1978, the capacity had been upgraded to 2065 MW, generated by ten turbines.

Because the electricity demand grew so fast, 1976 saw the beginning of a second building stage: a 1300 m long gravity dam was built, another spillway channel and a second powerhouse containing 10 turbines of 725 MW each. This increased the dam&#x27;s dimensions to 162 m in height and to 7426 m (according to other sources 11,409 m) in crest length. The water level rose to 272 m and the reservoir grew in size and volume to a capacity of 138 billion cubic m for flood storage or floodwater evacuation. 
The structure was inaugurated on 8 November 1986.

Since 2000, there is an ongoing refurbishment project to extend the operation of Guri Power Plant by 30 years. This project is to create 5 new runners and main components on Powerhouse II, and close to the end of 2007 is starting the rehabilitation of four units on Powerhouse I.

==Generating failures and blackouts==
===2010===
Due to government policy in effect from the 1960s to minimize power production from fossil fuels in order to export as much oil as possible, 74% of Venezuela&#x27;s electricity comes from renewable energy like hydroelectric power. the Guri Dam alone supplied more than a third of Venezuela&#x27;s electricity 
Part of the power generated at Guri is exported to Colombia and Brazil. The risks of this strategy became apparent in 2010, when, due to a prolonged drought, water levels were too low to produce enough electricity to meet demand. In January 2010, the Venezuelan government imposed rolling blackouts to combat low water levels behind the dam due to drought.

===2016===
In April 2016, water levels again became low, and the government announced blackouts of 4 hours per day, for 40 days or until water levels stabilized. Government employees were told not to come to work on Fridays, president Maduro urged women not to use hair dryers, and the electricity supplied to fifteen shopping malls was rationed. Three days were added to the 2016 Easter national holiday, allowing for a one-week shutdown of public services and private businesses.

===2019===

On 7 March 2019, shortly before 17:00 local time, the Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant failed, leaving most of Venezuela&#x27;s 32 million citizens in darkness. In the days following the onset of the blackout, at least four attempts were made to restart the key San Gerónimo B substation, which distributes 80% of the country&#x27;s electricity, but all failed, and no date was set for the plant&#x27;s reactivation. Government officials claim the blackout was &quot;an act of sabotage&quot;, while experts attributed the failure to aging infrastructure and insufficient maintenance.

Approximately 17,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Period when sea levels were significantly lower, the area was a part of a vast coastal plain. The area where the Cradock Channel exists was where the Waitematā Harbour (then a river) and the Mahurangi River passed before reaching the Pacific Ocean.

<text>Murrayfield Stadium is a rugby union stadium located in the Murrayfield area of Edinburgh, Scotland. The stadium is owned by the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) who has its headquarters based at the stadium, and is the national stadium of the Scotland national rugby union team. With a seating capacity of 67,144, it is the largest stadium in Scotland, the fifth largest in the United Kingdom, and the twenty–second largest in Europe.

It officially opened on 21 March 1925 with a game between Scotland and England. The game was won by Scotland who came out victorious following a Grand Slam. The stadium hosts most of Scotland&#x27;s home test matches and the &quot;Scottish Hydro Electric Cup&quot; final, as well as URC and European Rugby Champions Cup matches.

Although primarily a rugby union stadium, Murrayfield has in the past hosted American football, rugby league and association football matches, as well as numerous music concerts. Currently, the stadium is known as Scottish Gas Murrayfield Stadium for sponsorship reasons.

==History==
===Purchase of land===
The SRU identified 19 acres of land at Murrayfield, purchasing this from Edinburgh Polo Club at Murrayfield, having raised money through debentures. A stand and three embankments were constructed, which took two years. Previous internationals had been played at Inverleith but it was not large enough to cope with the increasing number of spectators. Arthur Sellers was the stadium&#x27;s first groundsman, having previously prepared the pitches at Inverleith. On 21 March 1925 were the first team to visit Murrayfield, with 70,000 people watching beat them to win their first Five Nations Championship Grand Slam.

===Usage during WWII===
During the Second World War the ground at Murrayfield was offered to the nation and was taken over by the Royal Army Service Corps and used as a supply depot. During the war years the armed forces sports authorities managed to arrange two Scotland v. England services internationals each year, on a home-and-away basis. Scotland&#x27;s home matches were played at Inverleith for the first two years with a return to Murrayfield in 1944 after that ground&#x27;s derequisition.

===Recent history===
Murrayfield&#x27;s record attendance of 104,000 was set on 1 March 1975 when Scotland defeated 12–10 during the 1975 Five Nations Championship. This attendance stood as a world record until 1999, and remains a European record. The East stand was built in 1983.

In October 1991 another debenture scheme was launched, to finance a more comprehensive redevelopment of the West Stand. The new West Stand was designed with a 48-metre cantilever roof. The old West Stand housed a museum, but this was not replaced and plans for a new visitor centre were shelved when the game turned professional. The first phase was completed in January 1993 with the new north and south stands opening. In February 1994 the centre section of the new West Stand opened. The work was carried out by Tilbury Douglas.

In 1994, Murrayfield completed a £50-million renovation where floodlights were installed for the first time.

In October 2012, SRU chief executive Mark Dodson told the BBC that it was actively seeking a name sponsor for Murrayfield:The single biggest piece of our inventory is our national stadium. We would like to see if we can monetise that. It would be crazy for us not to look at using our single biggest piece of inventory to drive revenue. We want to get the right price for it. In addition, Dodson indicated that the SRU was actively seeking a site for a completely new stadium with a capacity of 10,000 to 15,000 as a future home for Edinburgh Rugby. The pitch was damaged by nematodes in the lead up to the 2013 autumn internationals. This led the SRU to replace the grass with a Desso surface from the start of the 2014 season. A naming rights deal with BT was agreed in May 2014, resulting in the stadium being officially named as the BT Murrayfield Stadium.

Scottish Rugby and Scottish Gas agreed a new five-year partnership deal starting in July 2023. This will result in the creation of a Club &amp; Community Net Zero Fund worth £2 million to ensure Scottish clubs can save on energy bills and carbon emissions. Scottish Gas will also invest in the women&#x27;s game through shirt and stadium sponsorship, resulting in an official name change for the stadium to Scottish Gas Murrayfield.

==Location==
Murrayfield is located next to Murrayfield Ice Rink, Murrayfield Curling Rink, and is close to Edinburgh Zoo. It is named after the area of Edinburgh it is located in, Murrayfield. There are two cricket pitches in the immediate vicinity at Roseburn Park used by Murrayfield DAFS CC and four rugby pitches owned by the SRU which were used by teams including the amateur club Murrayfield Wanderers RFC. Wanderers and their predecessors had played there since 1902 but were asked to vacate in 2018 as the governing body had plans to develop the land. Wanderers moved their training base to Roseburn but continued to hire the Murrayfield pitches for some matches.

==Transport==

===Buses===
The stadium is served by Lothian Bus services 12, 22, 26, 31 and the Airlink 100 along Corstorphine Road. Post-match traffic congestion is common along this route.

===Rail===
Despite the line running adjacent to the stadium, the closest railway station to the stadium is , which lies a mile to the East.

Interchange with the Edinburgh Trams is available at Haymarket, and stations. is a short walk from the St Andrew Square tram stop.

===Tram===
Murrayfield Stadium tram stop is located adjacent to the stadium entrance turnstiles on Roseburn Street. Access to the platform is by a flight of stairs or lift. As part of crowd-management measures, ticketing machines are situated at the bottom of the staircase and not the platform.


==Uses==
===Rugby union===
Murrayfield is used for most Scottish international rugby union matches, with all Scotland&#x27;s Six Nations home games being played in the stadium. The stadium also hosted all of Edinburgh&#x27;s matches between 1996 and January 2017. (For Pro14 matches, only the lower tier of the East Stand is typically used.) 
Since February 2018 all Edinburgh matches are once again held at Murrayfield; with work now finished on the construction of a new 7,800 capacity stadium on the back pitches to host Edinburgh Rugby from the start of the 2021/22 season.

From 2007 to 2011, Murrayfield hosted the Edinburgh 7s, then the final event in the annual IRB Sevens World Series in rugby sevens, but that tournament was moved to Glasgow starting in 2012 due to low attendance. Murrayfield hosted select matches from the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The stadium also hosted the Heineken Cup Final in 2005, when Toulouse beat Stade Français 18–12, again in 2009, with Leinster defeating Leicester 19–16 and finally in 2017 with Saracens defeating Clermont 28–17.

====Rugby World Cup====
Murrayfield hosted matches of the 1991, 1999 and 2007 Rugby World Cups.

=====1991=====
=====1999=====
=====2007=====
===Rugby league===
Although primarily a rugby union stadium, Murrayfield hosted the Rugby League Challenge Cup Finals of 2000 and 2002. The stadium hosted rugby league&#x27;s Super League Magic Weekend in 2009. The record for a rugby league attendance at the stadium is 67,247 for the 2000 Challenge Cup Final.

===Association football===
Murrayfield has also hosted association football matches. In December 2003, the SRU board agreed to let local Scottish Premier League side Heart of Midlothian F.C. (Hearts) lease the stadium for match days. Later that month, UEFA confirmed that Hearts&#x27; own ground, Tynecastle did not meet the minimum criteria for European matches from the 2004–05 season.

<text>Leonid Mykhaylovych Chernovetskyi (; born 25 November 1951) is a former Mayor of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, from 2006 until the summer of 2012. He was a successful businessman, founder and controlling stakeholder of the Pravex Group and Pravex Bank, one of the largest banks in Ukraine. Since the appointment by President Viktor Yanukovych of Oleksandr Popov as Head of Kyiv City State Administration on 16 November 2010, replacing Chernovetskyi, Chernovetskyi was deprived of any real decision-making role in Kyiv. He tendered his resignation on 1 June 2012.

After this resignation Chernovetsky and his family moved to the Georgian town Kobuleti and he received Georgian citizenship.

==Early life==
Chernovetskyi quit school when he was 14 and went to work as a fitter at an aviation factory, but soon returned to resume his education, graduating from the Kharkiv public school #4. From 1970 until 1972, Chernovetsky served his military obligations. In 1977, he graduated from the Kharkiv Law School with specialization in jurisprudence. He worked as the senior detective in the prosecutor&#x27;s office of Kyiv Oblast. In 1981, he returned to Kharkiv Law School attending aspirantura and obtained his doctorate in 1984 with a dissertation about &quot;Methods of investigation of plunders conducted by officials&quot;. Until 1989 he was a teacher at Kyiv University.

== Career ==
Soon after perestroika, he went into private business, becoming one of the earliest big businesspeople in Kyiv. He founded the Pravex Group (, an abbreviated from &quot;Law, Economics and Sociology&quot;). Later the banking division of the Pravex Group rose into the Pravex Bank - one of the largest banks in Ukraine, possessing a dense network of offices in Kyiv and other regions. In 2001, Chernovestkyi and his bank founded the &quot;Kyiv Bank Union&quot; banking association. Pravex Bank was sold in 2008 to Banca Intesa São Paulo for 509 million euros. Chernovetskyi has acknowledged giving millions in bribes during his days as a businessman.

In 2012, Leonid Chernovetskiy founded the Chernovetskyi Investment Group, a venture capital group based in Kyiv. In 2015, the Chernovetskyi Investment Group made an investment of $1 million into Busfor, a Moscow-based online tour company.

On 18 August 2008 President Victor Yushchenko granted him the Order of Yaroslav the Wise, though it was harshly opposed by Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko who urged to &quot;stop granting decorations to corruptionists&quot;.

Chernovestkyi is a member of the Embassy of God, an evangelical church founded by Nigerian immigrant Sunday Adelaja. He is also a longtime philanthropist of Kyiv, caring for the city&#x27;s old and poor.

On 2 January 2013 Leonid Chernovetskiy founded Chernovetskyi Investment Group, investment potential of which exceeds 750 million dollars.

He is currently Honorary President of Chernovetskyi Investment Group.

Chernovetskyi was nicknamed &quot;Cosmos&quot; () after he publicly announced that he intends to fly in outer space with his cat. However, that name got stuck with him later due to his non-ordinary administrative and political decisions and announcements that have been viewed as &quot;bizarre&quot;. He has sung at rallies and offered to auction off his kisses. That behavior prompted some officials to call for a medical examination into whether he is mentally healthy to govern the city. In response, Chernovetsky posed, on 18 March 2009, in tight swimming trunks in front of scores of reporters to try to show he was both physically and mentally fit.

Chernovestkyi was the subject of several personal and political attacks when he took office as mayor of Kyiv. Some were critical about his lack of experience and his authoritarianism. Others considered him off-balance or speculated that he has drug or alcohol problems. However, none of these accusations have been proven to date.

==Controversies==

Pravex Bank, one of the largest retail banks of Ukraine formerly controlled by Chernovestkyi and his family, was rumoured to submit its new employees to a polygraph test and to use coercive methods to recover impaired loans. However, the Bank came out to be one of the most profitable financial institutions in Ukraine despite strong competition from foreign-owned banks.

In 2003, Chernovestkyi made headlines for his links to the deaths of two pedestrians who had died on separate occasions after being run over at high speed by cars linked to Chernovetsky on the road leading to his mansion in the elite Koncha Zaspa residential neighborhood. Chernovetsky, who is a collector of expensive souped-up automobiles, was behind the wheel in the second incident; his wife was a passenger in the first. Neither Chernovetsky nor his driver has been found guilty of any wrongdoing in connection with the incidents.

On 16 February 2010 the Kyiv city administration denied reports that Chernovetskyi&#x27;s daughter Khrystyna Chernovetska was robbed in France on 15 February 2010, after foreign media had reported that Chernovetska had €4.5 million worth of jewels stolen in Paris.

In April 2011, Interpol issued an international arrest warrant for Chernovetskyi&#x27;s son-in-law Viacheslav Suprunenko, a member of the Kyiv city council&#x27;s Chernovetskyi Bloc faction. According to &quot;Kyiv Post&quot;, he was arrested in Italy in May 2011.

Chernovetskyi&#x27;s son, Stepan was arrested in Barcelona in July 2016 on charges of money laundering and fraud despite his father&#x27;s denials and threats of legal action against Spanish authorities. Leonid Chernovetskyi released a statement on his Facebook page announcing the release of his son in August 2016.

In 2003, he initiated the adoption of the law &quot;On the protection of public morals&quot;, which govern the basic directions of state regulation of information products circulation which affect negatively on public morality. The law also imposed prohibition on the production and circulation of pornographic nature objects.

;2004 presidential elections
Chernovestkyi was a self-nominated candidate in the 2004 presidential election, believed to be one of the &quot;technical candidates&quot; whose true mission was to assist Viktor Yushchenko&#x27;s struggle for the presidency by placing additional representatives in electoral commissions.

;2006 parliamentary and mayor elections
According to the Kyiv city election commission, Chernovetskyi garnered 32 percent of the vote to win the election for mayor of Kyiv. Vitali Klitschko placed second with 24 percent and incumbent Oleksandr Omelchenko placed third with 21 percent. Opponents say Chernovetskyi won because of a dirty campaign marred by bribing impoverished elderly voters with food; Chernovetsky has denied this. Chernovetskyi was also elected to the Verkhovna Rada in the list of the Our Ukraine Bloc, but had to reject the parliamentary seat.

In first year after the election victory Chernovetskyi increased Kyiv budget in 5 times Leonid Chernovetskyi was developing anti-alcohol and anti-tobacco programs during time when he was mayor.

;2008 snap Kyiv local election and political unrest
Leonid Chernovetskyi won another term as Mayor of Kyiv with 38% of the vote in the 25 May 2008 snap local election, called on by the Verkhovna Rada in March 2008.

Former deputy head of Leonid Chernovetsky&#x27;s Block Alla Shlapak stated opinion, that because of humanitarian programs for pensioners, teachers, medics and other groups of society, Chernoverskiy can be considered the best mayor of Kyiv.

While having a solid amount of money he always paid attention to socially unprotected people and outcasts. In 2010 he founded a charitable service “Social patrol”, which was delivering warm clothes, food, medical assistance and advising to homeless people.

In 12 of April 2012, in Georgia L. Chernovetskiy established charitable fund “Social partnership”. The main projects of Social Partnership fund are:“Home care” (providing medicaments and medical assistance to those who are in need); “Family-type orphanage”; “Large family support”; “Gathering of clothes” (system for receiving and redistribution of clothes for people in need); “Food collecting program” (gathering of food for poor people).

After the resignation from post of mayor he continued engage in charity. According to his own statement ex-mayor spends not less than 1 million dollars to charity per year. In September 2013 he has opened an orphanage in Georgia.

Leonid Chernoverskiy belongs to those politics, who are active users of social networks. His Facebook page is updated regularly.

Chernoverskiy did not participate in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election.

In December 2015 Chernoverskiy made an announcement of his intention to enter the political arena in Georgia in an interview with a Georgian media outlet, stating, “I decided to go into politics because I want to spend the last days of my life here, in Georgia. Georgia is my destiny!”.

==Klychko - Chernovetsky stand-off==
On 6 February 2009 the Vitaliy Klychko Bloc stated it will apply to the Verkhovna Rada, the Cabinet of Ministers, the National Security and Defense Council, and the Kyiv prosecutor&#x27;s office with a request to take into consideration the unlawfulness of Kyiv Mayor Leonid Chernovetskyi actions and to call early mayoral elections in the city. Earlier on 12 December 2008 Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko also hinted that new early mayoral elections should be held again in Kyiv. This was based on Tymoshenko&#x27;s disapprove of the handling of Chernovetskyi of the local energy crises of December 2008 when the Kyivenergo utility company began cutting the supply of hot water to about 5,000 homes in Kyiv because of the Kyiv municipal administration&#x27;s failure to compensate the company for the difference between the tariffs charged by Kyivenerho and the actual cost of its services. Tymoshenko accuses Leonid Chernovetskyi of using money from the municipal budget to finance his election campaign (and so there were insufficient funds to pay Kyivenerho).

In May 2008, preliminary results showed Leonid Chernovetsky as clear leader ahead of Aleksandr Turchinov, a member of Ukraine Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko&#x27;s Bloc and Vitaly Klychko.

Chernovetskyi had become unpopular among the residents of Kyiv. On 13 March 2009 a Verkhovna Rada temporary commission on the issues of investigating violations of legislation by the officials of the Kyiv city state administration and the Kyiv city council came to the conclusion that it was necessary to examine the mental and physical state of Chernovetskyi, however, the procedure could be performed against his will only under a court ruling.

in May 2009, Klychko threatened to sue Chernovetsky for claims he demanded two hectares of land on which to erect a boxing club.

In 2011, the feud continued with Klychko again with allegations that Chernovetsky was responsible for the theft of 70 billion hryvni. Chernovetsy responded with intent to counter sue.

;Yanukovych presidency
Chernovetskyi announced in March 2009 he would participate in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election. But did not do so.

A March 2010 poll indicated that a large majority of Kyiv residents (more than 89%) were unhappy with his work and would like the mayor to resign without delays (80%). On 15 November 2010 President Viktor Yanukovych dismissed Leonid Chernovetskyi from the post of Head of the Kyiv&#x27;s State Administration and appointed Oleksandr Popov to this post. Popov is seen as Chernovetsky&#x27;s replacement since he was not elected but appointed by President Viktor Yanukovich. The appointment was made possible by the Ukraine&#x27;s national parliament which had amended the law on “the capital of Ukraine – hero city of Kyiv” on 7 September 2010, making it possible for the President to appoint the chairman of the city administration at his discretion (before the amendments the elected Kyiv mayor was automatically appointed head of the city administration). Another presidential decree relieved Chernovitsky of the office &quot;head of the Kyiv State Administration&quot;, while still preserving the post of Kyiv mayor.

Popov stated early 2011 &quot;we&#x27;ve definitely limited the activity of the city council and the mayor to some extent&quot;. In November 2010 Prime Minister Mykola Azarov compared Chernovetsky to the Queen of the United Kingdom, saying he had a title but no official decision-making role. The Azarov Government then opened several investigations into the allegedly illegal sale of city land and property by Chernovetsky&#x27;s top officials and then sales of those lands to friends and their companies. By then Chernovetsky was not to be seen in Kyiv and rumors appeared he was in &quot;quasi-retirement&quot; in Switzerland, was seeking political asylum in Israel or that he had secretly tendered his resignation. In a pressconference on 28 January 2011 Prime Minister Azarov asked Popov “to find by all means” Chernovetsky &quot;to bring him back to the work&quot;. According to UNIAN Azarov &quot;could not suppress a laugh&quot; when asked about Chernovetsky. Popov has stated he last met with the mayor toward the end of 2010. Chernovetsky&#x27;s spokeswoman Marta Hrymska told &quot;The Associated Press&quot; on 8 February 2011 in a phone text message that the mayor resumed duties after a vacation in Georgia. Commentators suggested that by failing to fulfill his duties, Chernovetsky was trying to force President Yanukovich to stop the investigations into his close aides and that Yanukovych was reluctant to see Chernovetsky go just yet and share power with a new mayor, because his protégé Popov, was unlikely to get elected. On 24 February 2011 Chernovetskyi did attend a meeting of the Kyiv City Council.

On 3 August 2011 it was reported that Chernovetskyi has secretly left Ukraine and moved to Israel. According to Agence France Press, he was discovered by a crew of Ukrainian television channel 1+1 in an apartment in Tel Aviv. In a brief statement, Chernovetskyi, who was surprised they had found him, called it &quot;an unofficial holiday&quot;. It had been reported earlier, that he has held Israeli citizenship since 1994, having run for president and for Kyiv mayor while holding dual Israeli and Ukrainian citizenships in violation of Ukrainian law, which does not allow its citizens to hold dual citizenship.

In February 2012 Chernovetskyi stated he will not run for re-election.

Chernovetsky tendered his resignation on 1 June 2012. The city council accepted the early termination of office on 12 July 2012. The city council decided the same day that Halyna Hereha would temporarily act as the mayor of the capital city. Kyiv then did not have an elected mayor until mayor Vitali Klitschko was sworn in on 5 June 2014.

After the resignation of mayor Leonid Chernovetskiy continued to engage actively in charity. Ex-mayor is spending at least $1 million a year for charity according to his own statement. In September 2013 he opened children&#x27;s home in Georgia.

==Charity==
After tragic events in Ukraine in February 2014, L. Chernovetskiy donated 10 million UAH to bereaved families. “I clearly understand that money will not compensate a loss of close relatives and loved ones, but I cannot stand aside”, he said. Leonid Chernovetskyi founded charity foundation in Georgia and for today it is the biggest local charity foundation called as Chernovetskyi Charity Fund.
Leonid Chernovetsky has been doing charity work for more than 18 years. Today he runs the same name fund - Chernovetsky Foundation in Georgia, which supplies more than 3,500 extremely needy Georgians daily and also provides free nursing services to 500 elderly bedridden people who can not move independently.
There are 3 orphanages in Georgia under the management and financing of the Chernovetsky Foundation.
Chernovetsky actively participates in the daily life of Georgia. He repeatedly announced rewards for catching various criminals wanted by the Georgian authorities.
Leonid Chernovetskiy donated 25,000 lari to the family of the special forces deceased in the international anti-terrorist operation. He also handed monetary awards to all wounded special forces and employees of the security agency who took part in the anti-terrorist operation.

==Family and private life==
In 2013 grandson of Chernovetskiy Leonid became a champion of Catalonia in freestyle wrestling.

In 2014, Chernoverskiy has christened his son Gabriel. This event attracted a lot of mass media attention.

Stepan, the eldest son of Leonid Chernoverskiy, is known for his passion for boxing. According to several mass media, Stepan Chernoverskiy owns promotion company &quot;Elit boxing&quot; and periodically conducts box tournaments.

<text>Walton and O&#x27;Rourke (Paul E. Walton and Michael O&#x27;Rourke) were a famous team of cabaret puppeteers who founded the Olvera Street Puppet Theatre in Hollywood in 1935.

Within the puppeteering community Walton and O&#x27;Rourke were considered one of the finest teams of puppet showmen the U.S. ever produced. Some of their marionettes used as many as seven strings to control a single marionette arm.

Walton and O&#x27;Rourke appeared on Broadway in the 1941 Olsen and Johnson review Sons o&#x27; Fun.

A brief filmed record of their work can be seen in the 1936 Walter Lantz Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon, &quot;Puppet Show&quot;. The first and last sections present a live-action marionette show, where some very subtle character movements are demonstrated. For the 1953 motion picture Lili, they performed using hand puppets rather than the marionettes for which they were most famous. Walton &amp; O&#x27;Rourke made the puppets; George Latshaw manipulated Carrot Top; Wolo Von Trutzschler manipulated Golo the Giant; and Walton and O&#x27;Rourke manipulated Margurite and Reynardo.

<text>The Church of the Holy Trinity is an Anglican church located at Trinity Square in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

==History==

The modest Gothic Revival structure was built in 1847 by architect Henry Bowyer Lane, who also designed Little Trinity Anglican Church at 425 King Street East, and St. George the Martyr Church at 197 John Street (only the clock tower remains). The funds for its construction were a gift from Mary Lambert Swale of Settle, England. Swale had originally made the donation anonymously, but her name was eventually revealed. She had provided the gift with the stipulation that the church be open to the public, with no reserved pews. Other Torontonians assisted with the completion of this public project including Alexander Dixon who assisted with the project both financially and politically.

The lands for the church were given by the Honourable John Simcoe Macaulay in 1845. Macaulay&#x27;s cottage, &#x27;Teraulay&#x27; was then situated on an estate named Macaulay&#x27;s Fields which extended from present day Yonge to Bay (then known as Teraulay) Streets, and from today&#x27;s Albert Street (then known as Jeremy Street) to just south of Dundas Street. Building lots filled in the edges of the property to the north, south, and west of the Trinity site, and the central portion of the property was donated for the construction of the church. Eventually the east side of the Trinity site was sold to permit retail frontage on Yonge Street, enclosing Trinity Church, although a roadway connected Trinity to Yonge Street. The building was dedicated on October 27, 1847.

Holy Trinity was the fourth Anglican church in Toronto, after St. James&#x27; Cathedral, Little Trinity, and St. George the Martyr Church. The church&#x27;s first rector was Henry Scadding.

==Architecture==
Designed by Henry Bowyer Lane, the Church of the Holy Trinity is approximately five storeys tall. Though the scale of the church is modest, its height is emphasized through details which point upward. In relation to human scale, the church feels big, tall, and strong. Even though it is surrounded by modern buildings, its role as a terminating vista has been preserved for the pedestrian lane from Bay Street to Trinity Square and also for Hagerman Street. It is visible from Toronto City Hall&#x27;s podium green roof.

The church&#x27;s Gothic Revival design is evident in the materials and elements of the building. This style emphasizes verticality and light, which is achieved through the use of tall stained glass windows and twin turrets outlining the main entrance of the church. Like many Gothic churches, the Church of the Holy Trinity uses limestone for its foundation and window tracery, as well as sandstone, brick, and wood. This church follows the Gothic church characteristic of a cruciform in plan. The pointed arch is repeated throughout the whole building, present in the doors, windows, and Gothic vault. The stained glass windows are translucent and allow daylight into the church, each with its own unique design. Together, the variety of window designs speaks about the Bible and the history of the building. A unique element on the exterior of the church is the line of colourful shields under the eaves.

Mary Lambart Swale died at the age of 25 and gave the Toronto diocese a gift of 5,000 sterling to build a church. She requested that the church in the Gothic style, that the name be Holy Trinity, that the reading desk and pulpit not be placed as to obstruct the view of patrons, and that the pews were to be free for everyone forever. Along with the original gift she also gave a font that can still be found in the church today. The Gothic style chosen for the Church of the Holy Trinity was the late medieval Tudor style. The four pointed arch (also known as the Tudor Arch) in combination with the tall and narrow oriel windows are of Tudor style. The decorative chimney caps on most of the eleven chimneys are also in the style of Tudor architecture. The two towers flanking the west entrance of the church became a landmark of Toronto in the mid-nineteenth century and could be seen throughout the city.

There are emblems, symbols, and initials on crests under the eaves of the entire exterior, a unique feature of the church. These crests bear the initials of early rectors, the architect, and the builder. The symbols include an open book, King Soloman&#x27;s head, and several other masonic symbols. A brochure can be picked up at the entrance to the church showing and explaining the crests.

The stained glass windows encompass a range of eras and styles from mid nineteenth-century stenciled glass to late twentieth-century cut glass.

==Community involvement==
Located at 19 Trinity Square with offices and program space at 6 and 10 Trinity Square, the Church of the Holy Trinity is surrounded by the Toronto Eaton Centre on the north, south, and east sides, a Marriott hotel and the Ted Rogers School of Management to the northwest, and the office building known as Bell Trinity Square to the southeast. The original Eaton Centre construction plans called for the church to be demolished as well, but the parishioners successfully resisted and forced the mall&#x27;s design to be changed.

Since its construction, the city of Toronto has expanded so that the church now finds itself in the middle of Toronto&#x27;s urban core. As a result, the church has tailored its ministry to the urban homeless and needy, and maintains the Toronto Homeless Memorial outside the church doors which lists the names of homeless people who have died on the streets of Toronto.

The church also has an active outreach to Toronto&#x27;s LGBT community. Prior to acquiring its first building in 1985, the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto worshipped there, and the church vocally supported Anglican priest James Ferry after he was inhibited by the Anglican Church in 1991 when his sexual relationship with another man was discovered.

Holy Trinity has also become an important venue for artistic events. The church participates as a venue in Toronto&#x27;s annual Nuit Blanche, and presents a weekly series of classical, choral, and jazz concerts throughout the year, as well as a dramatization of the Christmas story every December since 1937.

Due to the church&#x27;s excellent acoustics, Canadian band Cowboy Junkies recorded their 1988 breakthrough album &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; at the church on November 27, 1987. In 2006, they returned to record a 20th anniversary edition of the album, &quot;Trinity Revisited&quot;. The recording engineer for the original album, Peter J. Moore, died November 11, 2023, and his Celebration of Life ceremony was held in the church on November 25th, almost 36 years to the day after the original recording. For the Juno Awards of 2021, which was broadcast from a variety of locations due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, singers William Prince and Serena Ryder performed Prince&#x27;s single &quot;The Spark&quot; in the church.

<text>The 6551 Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter (ACIA) is an integrated circuit made by MOS Technology. It served as a companion UART chip for the widely popular 6502 microprocessor. Intended to implement RS-232, its specifications called for a maximum speed of 19,200 bits per second with its onboard baud-rate generator, or 125 kbit/s using an external 16x clock. The 6551 was used in several computers of the 1970s and 1980s, including the Commodore PET and Plus/4. It was also used by Apple Computer on the Apple II Super Serial Card, and by Radio Shack on the Deluxe RS-232 Program Pak for their TRS-80 Color Computer.

Several companies, including Dr. Evil Labs and Creative Micro Designs, marketed an add-on cartridge containing a 6551 and an industry-standard RS-232 port to allow the C64 and 128 to use high-speed modems from companies such as U.S. Robotics and Hayes Communications. The Dr. Evil and CMD cartridges pushed the 6551 to 38,400 baud and, with a faster-still clock crystal, some end users reported getting 115,200 bit/s from the 6551. The ADTPro file transfer program disables the baud rate generator in the 6551, allowing 115,200 bit/s transfers with an unmodified clock crystal.

== Variants ==
The Rockwell 65C52 combines two CMOS 6551s on a chip.

== Similar chips ==
The Motorola 6850 is a similar chip to the MOS Technology 6551, but without an onboard bit rate generator.  The 6850 is often used for MIDI.

The Western Design Center WDC 65C51 is designed as a drop in replacement for the original MOS 6551, electrically, physically and programming- compatible with most 6551 and 6850 derivatives from most other suppliers.  The WDC 65C51 has errata, in which the transmitter “ready” bit is “stuck” in the ready state.

<text>Gordon Ross (born 8 March 1978) is a Scottish rugby union footballer who played as a fly-half. He earned 25 caps for Scotland.

Ross represented Edinburgh and Scottish Schools at U16 and U18 level before going on to represent Scotland at U19 and at U21 levels. He attended George Heriot&#x27;s School and started his senior career with Heriots before joining Edinburgh when Scotland opted for regional rugby in 2000.

The highlight of his early career was kicking the winning goal for Edinburgh Rugby against Biarritz Olympique in 1997 and beating England as part of the Scotland U19 squad in the same season. He played a pivotal role in Heriot&#x27;s FP&#x27;s second successive league title in 1999-00 and was duly rewarded with a professional contract with the Edinburgh Reivers.

== Club career ==
Ross stayed with the Reivers from 2000 until 2002, when he moved to Leeds and stayed until 2006. He was voted Man of the Match when they won the Powergen Cup in 2005 beating Bath 20–12, a game in which Ross scored two penalties and two conversions.

In 2006 he joined Castres for one season before moving on to Saracens, where he played for two seasons before joining London Welsh in 2009.

In his debut season at Welsh he scored 30 points in 26 appearances, and helped the club reach the Championship semi-finals, where they lost to Bristol.

Ross endured an injury disrupted 2010/11 campaign, picking up a groin injury in the win over Bristol at Old Deer Park in October. He returned in January against the Ulster Ravens and helped Welsh reach a second consecutive Championship semi-final. He made 23 appearances, scoring 212 points, including a late match winning penalty to beat Bedford.

Ross made 31 appearances during the 2011/12 season and racked up 110 points in the Championship, including a 16-point haul as Welsh beat his former club Leeds at Headingley on the opening weekend of the season.

His penalty with the last kick of the game gave Welsh an 18–16 win over London Scottish at Old Deer Park, while he landed a crucial drop goal in the first leg of the Championship final against the Cornish Pirates at Menneye Field.

Ross has played Heineken Cup rugby for Leeds, Castres, Edinburgh and Saracens, making 40 appearances in Europe, scoring 263 points.

==International career==

A prodigious goal-kicker, Ross enjoyed a dream debut for Scotland with a record of 23 points in the 43–20 success against Tonga at Murrayfield in November 2001. Seven years later, during the Barclays Churchill Cup competition in North America, he set another record as the Scotland A team&#x27;s top scorer. He passed Duncan Hodge&#x27;s record of 126 points during a replacement appearance win against Argentina at Richardson Stadium in Kingston, Ontario. By the end of that 2008 tournament his tally in 16 Scotland A games was 140 points. They are the only players to have scored at least 100 points for Scotland A.

Later that year Ross took that record total to 150 points with five conversions in Scotland A&#x27;s victory against Georgia at Firhill, Glasgow, and in February 2009 he extended his Scotland A appearances to 18 when he played as a replacement against Ireland A at the RDS, Dublin. A further A international appearance and seven points were added in the 22-all draw with Italy at McDiarmid Park, Perth, taking his points tally to 157.

Ross&#x27;s first Test try was included in an 18-point haul in the 2003 RWC Countdown victory over Italy, also at Murrayfield, and he scored his first drop goal for Scotland in the 13–10 victory over Italy in the final match of the 2006 RBS 6 Nations. In 2002 his assurance and control were key factors in Scotland&#x27;s Murrayfield win against South Africa. Earlier in the year he emerged as joint top scorer (36 points) on Scotland&#x27;s tour of North America during which he played in all three midweek victories. Ross reached his Scotland A century while captaining the team in victory against Italy A at McDiarmid Park, Perth, in February 2007.

Ross kicked 17 points on his debut for Scotland A as they accounted for their Welsh counterparts 42–20 in February 2001. His goal-kicking was to the fore in the next A victory, too – the 33–13 success against Italy A in which he contributed 13 points. In February 2002 he kicked two goals from two attempts in quagmire conditions to ensure Scotland A opened their shadow Six Nations campaign with a 6–6 draw against their English counterparts. Better followed a fortnight later when his last-gasp conversion 20 metres from the right touchline earned the Scots a 30–29 victory over Italy A to which Ross contributed a total of 20 points, including a try. He had a full house in a haul of 18 points (try, penalty, two conversions and two drop goals) against Wales A at Wrexham in 2002. He played in seven A internationals in 2001 and 2002, and he returned to that level in the Perth match against Australia A in November 2006. He played in two wins in 2007 (against Italy A at McDiarmid Park and against the US at Henley in the Barclays Churchill Cup competition) as well as two more in 2008 (v Italy A in Mogliano and Ireland A) before that year&#x27;s Churchill Cup.

During a time that the national team were lacking in depth at the number 10 position it is still a point of mystery to many Scotland fans as to why he never picked up further caps beyond the 25 he collected. A preference of Dan Parks by coaches Matt Williams and Frank Hadden, and eventual emergence of a more running fly-half in Phil Godman may have curtailed further call-up opportunities.

==Additional achievements==
Ross played golf for Scottish Schools with a handicap of two and also played cricket at district level.

<text>Anatoliy Kyrylovych Kinakh (; born 4 August 1954) is a Ukrainian politician and honorary professor at the Mykolaiv Government Humanitarian University. Kinakh is a former (long serving) People&#x27;s Deputy of Ukraine. Kinakh currently serves as the leader of Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine.

Previously, Kinakh was a Prime Minister from 2001 to 2002 under President Leonid Kuchma, a first vice-Prime Minister and a Minister of Economy of Ukraine. 
Since 1996 Anatoliy Kinakh has been the President of Ukrainian League of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, non-governmental business organization.

==Biography==
Anatoliy Kinakh was born in the village of Brătușeni in the Moldavian SSR (now Moldova) on 4 August 1954. In 1978, he graduated from the Leningrad Shipbuilding Institute as a shipbuilding engineer. After finishing his higher education, Kinakh started his engineering career at the Tallinn shipyard. From 1981 he worked at the Mykolaiv shipyard &quot;Ocean&quot;.

===Political career===
In April 1990, he was elected to the Ukrainian parliament the Verkhovna Rada. There he worked on a committee dealing with economic reforms. In 1992, Kinakh was appointed a representative of the President in the Mykolaiv Oblast (province) of southern Ukraine. In 1995, Anatoliy Kinakh was appointed Vice-Prime Minister of Ukraine in the Cabinet of Yevhen Marchuk concerned with industrial affairs.

In the early 1990s, Mr. Kinakh held several posts in the local government of Mykolayiv Oblast. From 1995 to 1996 Kinakh was the Minister of Industrial Policy.

Anatoliy Kinah was appointed the Prime Minister of Ukraine from 29 May 2001 to 21 November 2002.

In 2002, he was elected to Verkhovna Rada on the list of the electoral bloc of parties For United Ukraine.

In the 2004 presidential election Anatoliy Kinakh was a candidate for the post of President of Ukraine, nominated by the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine, which he has chaired since 2000. A particular feature of his election program is a pro-Ukrainian choice in foreign policy, saying that entry to the European Union should not be a barrier to the development of relationships with all Commonwealth of Independent States countries as well as with Russia.

During the election campaign, Kinakh publicly broke ties with government-backed candidate and then Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych by declaring that no criminal can hold the post of President of Ukraine. He later took an active part in the Orange Revolution on the side of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko (who was elected president). Kinakh was appointed First Vice Prime Minister in the first Tymoshenko Government. Kinakh became Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine on 27 September 2005.

Kinakh was number two on the electoral list of the pro-presidential bloc Our Ukraine during the 2006 parliamentary election.

In March 2007, he became the Minister of Economics in the cabinet of Viktor Yanukovych against the wish of the Our Ukraine bloc. The Our Ukraine faction then decided to expel Anatoliy Kinakh from the faction and President Viktor Yushchenko ordered his removal from the National Security and Defense Council.

At the early parliamentary elections on 30 September 2007, his party participated in the elections together with the Yanukovych-led Party of Regions. Kinakh was elected in parliament. He became a full member of Party of Regions in October 2008. In 2012 he was re-elected into parliament on the party list of Party of Regions.

On 16 January 2014 he voted for the laws that conflict with the Constitution of Ukraine, Convention about the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, obligations and duties of Ukraine as a member of the UNO, CE and OSCE.

On 25 February 2014 Kinakh and 32 other mostly former Party of Regions deputies created the parliamentary faction Economic Development.

In the 2014 parliamentary election Kinakh tried to win a constituency seat in Mykolaiv as an independent candidate, but failed after finishing second in the constituency with approximately 12.77% of votes (winner Borys Kozyr of Petro Poroshenko Bloc won 33.17% of the votes).

Kinakh did not participate in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election.

<doc id="1210670" wikidata="Q1217409" url="?curid=1210670" title="The Roads to Freedom">
<text>The Roads to Freedom () is a series of novels by French author Jean-Paul Sartre. Intended as a tetralogy, it was left incomplete, with only three complete volumes and part one of the fourth volume of the planned four volumes published in his lifetime and the unfinished second part of the fourth volume was edited and published a year after his death.

The three published novels revolve around Mathieu, a socialist teacher of philosophy, and a group of his friends. The trilogy includes: &quot;L&#x27;âge de raison&quot; (&quot;The Age of Reason&quot;), &quot;Le sursis&quot; (which is generally translated as &quot;The Reprieve&quot; but could cover a number of semantic fields from &#x27;deferment&#x27; to &#x27;amnesty&#x27;), and &quot;La mort dans l&#x27;âme&quot; (&quot;Troubled Sleep&quot;, originally translated by Gerard Hopkins as &quot;Iron in the Soul&quot;, Hamish Hamilton, 1950). The trilogy was to be followed by a fourth novel, &quot;La dernière chance&quot; (i.e. &quot;The Last Chance&quot;); however, Sartre would never finish it: two chapters were published in 1949 in Sartre&#x27;s magazine &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot; under the title &quot;Drôle d&#x27;amitié&quot;. The last part of &quot;The Last Chance&quot; was later reconstructed and published in 1981 (see section below).

The novels were written largely in response to the events of World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, and express certain significant shifts in Sartre&#x27;s philosophical position towards &#x27;engagement&#x27; (commitment) in both life and literature, finding their resolution in the extended essay &quot;L&#x27;existentialisme est un humanisme&quot; (&quot;Existentialism is a Form of Humanism&quot;).

==Background==

In April 1938, Sartre&#x27;s first novel &quot;Nausea&quot; was published. Three months later, in July, he wrote to Simone de Beauvoir: &quot;I have all at once found the subject of my [next] novel, its proportions and its title... The subject is freedom.&quot; Originally it was to be titled &quot;Lucifer&quot;, and written in two parts – &quot;La Revolte&quot; and &quot;Le Serment&quot; (The Oath). In the autumn of 1938, Sartre began writing the novel that was to become &quot;The Age of Reason,&quot; and continued working on the novel on and off for the next year. In early September 1939, he was called up into the French Army and was assigned to the meteorological unit. Except for some regular meteorological observations, this war work was not exacting, and he had plenty of time to work on his novel, his war diaries, and numerous letters to friends. At one point he produced seventy-three pages of the novel in thirteen days. He had completed the novel by December 31, 1939, and immediately started a sequel, which he originally wanted to call &quot;September&quot; (referring to the Munich Agreement of September 1938), and which became titled &quot;The Reprieve&quot;. He finished writing &quot;The Reprieve&quot; in November 1943. However, he was constantly editing the manuscripts, and also turned them over to Simone de Beauvoir for critique.

His writing in these novels was semi-autobiographical. His separation from his accustomed life in Paris and the leisure and structure of his war work led him to continued introspection during this period. Mathieu was based upon himself, Ivich was based on Olga Kosakiewicz (a student of Simone de Beauvoir and friend of Sartre), Gomez was based on Fernando Gerassi, Sarah on Stephania Avdykovych (both very close friends of Sartre and de Beauvoir), and Boris was based on Sartre&#x27;s friend Jacques-Laurent Bost. Marcelle, perhaps loosely based on Simone de Beauvoir, was the character most removed from the real-life model.

&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; and &quot;The Reprieve&quot; were published together after the war in September 1945. &quot;Sartre was by now France&#x27;s leading intellectual voice, and the novels, not least because they defined a critical period in French history, were received with great enthusiasm by the French public.&quot; However, some reviews were mixed. Louis Parrot writing for &quot;Les Lettres francaises&quot; said, &quot;Jean-Paul Sartre has definitely taken his place among the greatest French writers of our day... His powerful talent has affirmed itself with rare brilliance.&quot; Gaéton Picon writing for &quot;Confluences&quot; said, &quot;If Sartre&#x27;s ambition was to force the doors of literary history, he has succeeded.. Like all great novelists, he also enjoys the privilege of having a universe of his own.&quot; However, Louis Beirnart, writing for &quot;Etudes&quot;, said, &quot;If books could smell, one would have to hold one&#x27;s nose in front of Sartre&#x27;s latest books... Sartre&#x27;s objective is, very clearly, to show life through its excrement and lower the value of existence to the level of the gutter and the dump.&quot; Orville Prescott in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, disliked the work, writing &quot;as a creative work of fiction &#x27;The Age of Reason&#x27; is a tedious disappointment. Its possible significance as &#x27;existentialist fiction is pitifully meager, too&quot;, as well as criticizing Sartre&#x27;s portrayal of the characters for being both uninteresting and unbelievable.

Extracts of the third novel in the trilogy, &quot;Iron in the Soul&quot; (or &quot;Troubled Sleep&quot;), appeared in the journal &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot; in January and June 1949, and it was published in book form later that year. The reviews were not good. As for the reception, Sartre scholar Michel Contat says: &quot;Troubled Sleep&quot; &quot;failed to provoke the anticipated and promised positive responses, as critics transferred their moral disappointment into an accusation that [&quot;Troubled Sleep&quot;] represented an exhaustion of Sartre&#x27;s literary creativity. Although Sartre always said that he accorded no importance to the judgments of literary reviewers, his partial failure in their eyes intimidated him in the face of the fourth volume...&quot; Consequently, Sartre was unable to complete the series.

==Characters==
* Mathieu Delarue – an unmarried philosophy professor whose principal wish (like Sartre&#x27;s) is to remain free
* Marcelle – Mathieu&#x27;s pregnant mistress
* Daniel – a homosexual friend of both Mathieu and Marcelle
* Boris – a student of Mathieu
* Ivich – Boris&#x27; sister, to whom Mathieu is attracted
* Brunet – Mathieu&#x27;s Communist friend
* Gomez – a painter, who is fighting with the Republicans in Spain
* Sarah – Gomez&#x27;s Jewish wife

==Overview of the series==
&quot;The first novel, &quot;L&#x27;âge de raison&quot; (1945; The Age of Reason), centers on philosophy professor Mathieu Delarue&#x27;s uncertainty over whether to devote himself to his pregnant mistress or to his political party. The second volume, &quot;Le sursis&quot; (1945, &quot;The Reprieve&quot;), explores the ramifications of the appeasement pact that Great Britain and France signed with Nazi Germany in 1938. In the third book, &quot;La mort dans l&#x27;âme&quot; (1949; &quot;Troubled Sleep&quot;, published in Great Britain as &quot;Iron in the Soul&quot;), Delarue ends his indecisiveness by attempting to defend a village under attack from the Germans. Although he is apparently killed, Delarue expresses his ultimate freedom through his bravery.&quot; 

The second part of &quot;Troubled Sleep&quot; focuses on Mathieu&#x27;s communist friend Brunet in the POW camp. &quot;Drôle d&#x27;amitié&quot; (&quot;Strange Friendship&quot;) also focuses on Brunet, and his fellow prisoner Schneider, in the POW camp. In the final part, &quot;La dernière chance&quot; (&quot;The Last Chance&quot;), it is revealed that Mathieu was in fact not previously killed: he reappears in a stalag after two months in the hospital.

==Shifting viewpoints within the novels==
In &quot;L&#x27;âge de raison&quot;, &quot;the perspective changes from chapter to chapter throughout the account of a 48-hour period. In volume 2, &quot;Le Sursis&quot;, the time-span is a week, but the viewpoint shifts more rapidly, moving sometimes within a single phrase from one character&#x27;s perspective to another&#x27;s... The lack of punctuation, the juxtaposition of perspectives, and the intensity created by the single focus of a multiplicity of characters work together to convey the common humanity and intersubjective experience of the French on the verge of war... Volume 3, &quot;La mort dans l&#x27;âme&quot;, reverts to a slower pace of perspectival change.&quot;

As for the experimental style of &quot;The Reprieve&quot;, Sartre wrote in 1945: 
:: &quot;I tried to take advantage of the experiments in technique that certain writers of simultaneity, like Dos Passos and Virginia Woolf, have undertaken. I took up their question at the very point where they had let it lie, and I tried to uncover something new along this path. The reader will say whether or not I&#x27;ve succeeded.&quot;

Of the first two books in the series, Sartre once said: 
::&quot;My intention was to write a novel about freedom. I wanted to retrace the path followed by some people and social groups between 1938 and 1944... I decided to tell &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; in an ordinary way, by simply showing the structured relationships that link a few individuals. But then come the days of September 1938, and all the barriers collapse... In &quot;The Reprieve&quot; we&#x27;ll find again all the characters of &quot;The Age of Reason,&quot; but now they are lost in a crowd.&quot;

==Interpretation==
Overall, &quot;the Roads to Freedom as a trilogy reflects many of Sartre&#x27;s best-known existentialist concepts, including bad faith, or self-deception, the acknowledgment of freedom that comes with both anguish and personal responsibility for one&#x27;s actions, and how those actions embody the personal and social morality that one promotes.&quot;

In his book &quot;Sartre and Fiction,&quot; Gary Cox discusses the implications of the &quot;Roads to Freedom&quot; series:

::&quot;The Age of Reason...&quot; grew alongside &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; for several years and echoes many of its central themes, particularly the themes of freedom, responsibility and being-for-others...

::It was not to the war that Sartre turned for inspiration for the first volume of his trilogy, but to prewar Paris of the summer of 1938... &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; is not nostalgic about the years between the wars. Rather it casts a detached and objective eye on a group of largely pathetic, emotionally immature characters who are too self-absorbed to really notice or care about the gathering clouds of war that will soon change their narrow little lives beyond recognition. With the coming of war Sartre began to change from a thinker preoccupied with the personal into a very political animal...

::&quot;The Reprieve&quot; was written while the Germans occupied Paris ... It covers the eight days from 23 to 30 September leading up to the controversial Munich Agreement... With &quot;The Reprieve&quot; politics and history enter the trilogy with a vengeance, although events are not unfolded in the form of an abstract historical account but via myriad personal perspectives.

::&quot;Iron in the Soul&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Troubled Sleep&quot;) is set in June 1940, 21 months after the events of &quot;The Reprieve.&quot; The central historical theme of the novel is the defeat of France by the Germans, and certainly a major source of inspiration for the novel was Sartre&#x27;s capture and imprisonment by German forces in June 1940... Mathieu makes a brief fifteen-minute stand against the Nazis ... that is all but futile in military terms, but for him it is an uncompromising and decisive act that is the ultimate affirmation of his freedom ... Here Mathieu achieves authenticity...

::The final 120 pages of the novel shift the focus to the communist Brunet in the POW camp. Brunet sees the game of French captives and German captors as another symptom of the evils of capitalism and nationalism, evils that will continue when this particular war is over unless ordinary people of whatever nationality can win the class struggle.

==The unfinished fourth volume, &quot;The Last Chance&quot;==
In 1981 a text of &quot;La dernière chance&quot; was published in French with Sartre&#x27;s complete works of fiction in the Pléiade edition. George H. Bauer and Michel Contat had painstakingly reconstructed the intended novel from Sartre&#x27;s &quot;completely unorganized manuscript pages.&quot; In their &quot;Critical Note on &quot;The Last Chance,&quot;&quot; the authors note: &quot;Let us also add that Sartre had come to be aware of the work we were doing on his drafts, and that he allowed it.&quot;

In 2009, Craig Vasey translated and published this work into English. Vasey&#x27;s edition, titled &quot;The Last Chance: Roads of Freedom IV,&quot; includes two parts: 1) &quot;Strange Friendship&quot; (&quot;Drôle d&#x27;amitié&quot;) – the two chapters which were previously published in 1949 in Sartre&#x27;s magazine &quot;Les Temps modernes;&quot; and 2) &quot;The Last Chance&quot; (&quot;La dernière chance&quot;) – the text reconstructed by Bauer and Contat from Sartre&#x27;s notes. This is the first time that these two parts have been available in English.

==Why Sartre did not finish the series==
Sartre&#x27;s biographer Ronald Hayman theorized that one reason Sartre did not finish the &quot;Roads to Freedom&quot; series was that Sartre &quot;deeply disliked bringing anything to a conclusion.&quot; Hayman pointed out that although Sartre &quot;managed to complete nine original plays, seven short stories, and several screenplays, nearly all his other major projects in literature and philosophy were abandoned.&quot; These included the planned sequels to &quot;Nausea,&quot; &quot;Being and Nothingness,&quot; and &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason,&quot; and &quot;other uncompleted projects including the autobiography, the enormous biography of Flaubert, &quot;La Psyché&quot; (a phenomenological psychology), a book on Mallarmé, one on Tintoretto,&quot; etc. As for the &quot;Roads to Liberty,&quot; Sartre &quot;had relatively little difficulty in completing the first three volumes: nothing needed to be concluded. He wrote 223 pages of the last volume, &quot;La derniere chance,&quot; and he did not give up hope of finishing it until nine years after publishing the third volume in the series.&quot;

According to Hayman, one reason for Sartre&#x27;s unfinished projects was his restlessness: when Sartre &quot;worked at long-term projects, it was tarnished by ambivalence. Other work would be clamoring for his time, and simultaneously he would feel guilty about enjoying words instead of taking action.&quot; Simone de Beauvoir is quoted as saying, &quot;Without having abandoned the idea of a fourth volume, he always found work that needed his attention more.&quot;

For another possible interpretation, Hayman goes on to quote the writer Michael Scriven, who said that Sartre was &quot;shattering the myth of the coherently finished text, the myth that the contradictions that gave rise to the work have been resolved by an apparently cohesive textual narrative.&quot;

Michel Contat, in his &quot;General Introduction for &quot;Roads of Freedom,&quot;&quot; points out that Sartre was no longer in the right frame of mind. His experience had become &quot;extremely restricted and particularized. It became the experience of a man of letters, a celebrity intellectual, who, apart from his old circle of friends, almost only encounters people like himself, even when he goes abroad.&quot; Also, the reviews of the last novel in the series, &quot;Troubled Sleep,&quot; had not been good. Contat further suggests that &quot;it is in developing the idea, near the end of 1953, of an autobiography that Sartre decides – or rather that the decision takes place in him – to leave his novel where it is, for this new project represents a way out of the dead-end in which he finds himself with the novel.&quot;

In an interview in 1973 concerning &quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot;, Sartre revealed at least one of the reasons he discontinued the series:
:What is fundamentally false about a novel in which one constructs a character based on oneself is precisely that he is not &quot;really&quot; you. The differences you put into him, and which seem of no decisive significance at the outset, end up throwing him into falseness. In &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, I gave Mathieu everything of mine—I don&#x27;t mean the facts of life, but his character—except the essential thing, which is that I lived in order to write. There is something radically false in an autobiographical novel, namely that it&#x27;s straddling: it is neither completely a novel, nor completely an autobiography. But that&#x27;s something I did not want to see at the time because I did not want to abandon the novel, and I could not write without making use of my own life.

==Adaptation==
The novel series was adapted into a thirteen-part television serial by David Turner for BBC Television in 1970, with Michael Bryant as Mathieu and directed by James Cellan Jones. The adaptation was nominated for several BAFTA awards for 1970. The entire series was screened by the British Film Institute over the weekend of 12–13 May 2012, attended by the director and several surviving cast members. The series had not been broadcast on television since 1977, and is unavailable on any format. In 2022, it was finally announced it would be repeated on BBC4.

<doc id="1210676" wikidata="Q4234503" url="?curid=1210676" title="Dmytro Korchynsky">
<text>Dmytro Oleksandrovych Korchynsky (; born 22 January 1964) is a Ukrainian writer, poet, militant, and political activist who is the former leader of far-right Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People&#x27;s Self-Defence (UNA-UNSO) organisation. 

Korchynsky was born on 22 January 1964 in Kyiv, Ukraine, USSR. In 1982, he finished a high school and enrolled in the Kyiv Institute of Food Industry&#x27;s Department of Industrial Power Generation. After two years of study, he left the institute without finishing. Later, Korchynsky participated in number of archaeological expeditions in the Southern Ukraine.

From 1985 to 1987, he served in the Soviet army. Korchynsky was in the 24th Mechanized Brigade of the Carpathian Military District as a commander of BMP-2. After demobilization he was dismissed in reserves as an assistant to a platoon leader. In 1987, Korchynsky enrolled in the Kyiv University, but left later that year.

From 1987 to 1988, Korchynsky was a member of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group.

== Leader of UNA-UNSO ==
Under his leadership, UNSO took part in several armed conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union, including Transnistria, Abkhazia and Chechnya. In 1992, as a volunteer, he left for Transnistria. In 1996 Korchynsky participated in the Chechen war. Next year he was completely ousted from the nationalist movement in Ukraine.

In the fall of 1992 he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Verkhovna Rada, placing fourth out of six in the 13th electoral district. Korchynsky ran again in 1994 and was again unsuccessful, this time placing third out of 24 in the 2nd electoral district in Kyiv.

== Post-UNA-UNSO political career ==
After being excluded from UNA-UNSO in 1997, Korchynsky became a media pundit and political analyst. He founded the Bratstvo Organization in 2002, which he claims has several hundred members in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa and Chernihiv. Bratstvo was not officially registered until March 2004. Though the group describes itself as an Orthodox Christian organization, it is not affiliated with any of the three Orthodox churches operating in Ukraine. He has described his group in his self-published newsletter as the &quot;Orthodox Taliban&quot;, and on his website as a &quot;Christian Hezbollah&quot;. Anton Shekhovtsov, a specialist on far-right organizations, spoke of Korchynsky as being “widely considered an agent provocateur, and his &quot;Bratstvo&quot; already took part in several actions that were meant to provoke police suppression of peaceful protests”.

During the 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Korchynsky ran again for the Verkhovna Rada as a member of the All-Ukrainian Party of Workers. He placed eighth out of 23 in the 220th electoral district.

On 29 December 2003, Bratstvo organized a street fight with the Berkut near the Canadian Embassy in Kyiv. A few days earlier on 25 December 2003, Ukrayinska Pravda received some correspondence from other journalists about intentions of the government to discredit opposition by connecting it to the problem with the arrested Ukrainian plane (Antonov An-124 Ruslan) in Canada. On 31 March 2004, members of Bratstvo poured glue and then water onto George Soros during the forum among human rights organizations in Kyiv &quot;Human rights at elections&quot;. In summer of 2004 in Kerch Bratstvo organized a strike at the Zaliv Shipbuilding yard, co-owner of which was David Zhvania, a member of Our Ukraine.

In the fall of 2004, Korchynsky participated in the presidential elections. After losing in the first round, Korchynsky supported pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych. After Viktor Yushchenko was announced a winner, Korchynsky joined the opposition.

In 2005, the Russian Putinist youth organisation Nashi invited Korchynsky to a youth summer camp to teach &quot;how to prevent public disturbances&quot; and how to confront the threat of an Orange Revolution reprisal in Russia. Together with Oleksii Arestovych, Korchynsky traveled to Moscow to attend a conference of the Eurasian Movement of Aleksandr Dugin.

In 2013 during the Euromaidan protests, 300 members of the Bratstvo organization led by Korchynsky attacked the presidential administration building (of then president Viktor Yanukovych). He then became a fugitive on the international wanted list of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for his role in inciting riots during the Euromaidan-related 1 December 2013 Euromaidan riots. On 2 January 2013, during the program &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; on ICTV, Serhiy Sobolev claimed that Korchynsky cooperates with Viktor Medvedchuk.

In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Korchynsky&#x27;s wife Oksana placed 24th on the (nationwide) party list of the Radical Party; she was elected into the Verkhovna Rada.

After the Revolution of Dignity, Korchynsky returned to Ukraine and founded the St. Mary&#x27;s battalion to fight against pro-Russian separatists in the Russo-Ukrainian War. Russia has opened several criminal cases against Korchynsky on &quot;terrorist&quot; charges.

== Connections with Russia ==
Contrary to his image as Ukrainian ultra-nationalist, Korchynsky had participated in number of &quot;dubious&quot; actions. In 2005, the Russian Putinist youth organisation Nashi invited Korchynsky to a youth summer camp to teach &quot;how to prevent public disturbances&quot; and how to confront the threat of an Orange Revolution reprisal in Russia. In the same year, he met with Putin&#x27;s political technologist Vladislav Surkov on a Moscow forum, where Korchynsky spoke against &quot;orange infiltrations&quot;. In 2004 - 2007 Korchynsky was a member of the Supreme Council of the International Eurasian Movement led by Russian right extremist Alexandr Dugin, and has demonstrated his connections with Dugin, regardless of Dugin&#x27;s widely expressed anti-Ukrainian views. After an arrest warrant in Ukraine in winter 2013, according press reports, Korchynsky may have found refuge in either Russia or its separatist enclave Transnistria. During Euromaidan, when Russia launched its disinformation and propaganda campaign &quot;about the allegedly deadly threat of radical Ukrainian nationalism to Russian-speakers in Ukraine&quot;, presenting protesting Ukrainians as fascists, Ukrainian ultra-nationalist Korchynsky may have been &quot;given the chance to evade a Ukrainian arrest warrant in Russia and/or Moscow-controlled Transnistria.&quot; Nationalism researcher Andreas Umland concludes that Korchynsky&#x27;s Bratstvo &quot;have a contradictory, if not paradoxical history of cooperation with anti-Euromaydan actors and the Russian neo-Nazi scene&quot; and &quot;avid anti-Ukrainian Kremlin-related organizations&quot;.

==Personal life==

He is an author of a poem collection &quot;Philosophy of distemper&quot; (2002), an author of the following books: &quot;War in the crowd&quot; (1998), &quot;This and It&quot; (2002) and &quot;Revolution haute couture&quot; (2004). His books are banned in Russia based on its law on extremism.

Eva Phillips (Joan Crawford) dominates her Georgia mansion and her facially scarred husband Avery (Barry Sullivan), nicknamed &quot;Beauty&quot;, an alcoholic mill-owner who hates her. A cousin, Jennifer Stewart (Lucy Marlow), is pressured into moving in with the family, and she watches in horror as Eva maneuvers to prevent the marriage of Avery&#x27;s sister Carol (Betsy Palmer), an equestrian, to Avery&#x27;s business manager Judson Prentiss (John Ireland), who had secretly been involved with Eva in the past. Jennifer learns that Eva stole Avery from house guest Sue McKinnon (Fay Wray), who has been mentally disturbed ever since.

Jennifer briefly dates Sue&#x27;s suave brother Ty (William Leslie), but it doesn&#x27;t last long. Meanwhile, as tension builds among the various denizens of the mansion, Avery shoots Eva&#x27;s terminally ill dog, telling people to lie to Eva and say the dog had died naturally. Jennifer says she doesn&#x27;t like to lie, and Avery says Eva would prefer to be lied to.

Carol tells Jennifer to watch out for Eva, and that she read a book about bees and feels that Eva is like a queen bee who stings all her competitors to death. Jennifer refuses to believe such bad sentiments about Eva, and eventually becomes her putative personal assistant, and a caretaker to the young Phillips children, Tessa and Ted. Ted persistently has intense nightmares about a fatal car crash involving his parents.

That same night, Eva and Jud have a meeting in a darkened room where he tells her that their relationship and anything they had together was over because he is marrying Carol. Eva rejects this and begins to kiss him, but Judson stops kissing her after a few seconds once he realizes that he is falling back into her trap.

Meanwhile, Jennifer witnesses this rendezvous from the top of the staircase and is shocked. Jud turns the light on and tells Eva that he is serious, and she warns him that he will ultimately be sorry for refusing her. When Carol and Jud&#x27;s engagement is announced to Eva, Eva strongly hints at her former affair with Jud, and Carol commits suicide by hanging herself in the horse stable.

Avery catches nanny Miss Breen acting abusively towards the children, and fires her. Meanwhile, Jennifer and Avery are drawn together and share a furtive kiss when he tells her that he is aware of Eva and Jud&#x27;s past. Eva senses the developing relationship and increases her malevolent actions; she insists Miss Breen continue as nanny, and tells Avery to not interact with Jennifer any longer. When he refuses, she threatens a scandalous divorce in the press.

Meanwhile, Jud, still guilty over Carol&#x27;s death, leaves the house for a few weeks, but comes back one day for work. He finds out from Jennifer that it was really Eva who told Carol about his earlier relationship with Eva, not Avery as he had assumed. Now, for different reasons, both men are determined to avenge it.

Avery, after glancing over his gun cabinet, changes his outward attitude completely, and acts as though he is in love with Eva, even giving her an expensive bracelet. She changes her attitude and says that she is done being manipulative because her husband finally loves her. However, Jud sees through the charade and confronts Avery, stating that Avery&#x27;s true motive for being nice to Eva is so that she will trust him enough so that he can kill her.

Jud preempts his plan on the night Avery intends to commit murder-suicide, and drives Eva to the fancy-dress party to which Avery would have driven her. When Eva discerns that he wants her dead, she frantically attacks him, resulting in a crash over a cliff, killing them both. Before learning of his mother&#x27;s death, Ted has another dream about a fatal car crash. Now, Jennifer and Avery are free to love each other.

<doc id="1210689" wikidata="Q1319857" url="?curid=1210689" title="The Trinity Session">
<text>The Trinity Session is the second studio album by Canadian alternative country band Cowboy Junkies, released in early 1988 by Latent Recordings in Canada, and re-released worldwide later in the year on RCA Records. &quot;Working on a Building&quot; and &quot;Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)&quot; did not appear on the Latent Records release. &quot;Blue Moon Revisited&quot; was originally released on &quot;It Came from Canada, Vol. 4&quot; (1988), a compilation of Canadian independent bands.

The music was recorded inside Toronto&#x27;s Church of the Holy Trinity on , with the band circled around a single microphone. The album includes a mixture of original material by the band and covers of classic folk, rock and country songs. Notable among the songs is the band&#x27;s most famous single, a cover of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, based on the version found on &quot;1969: The Velvet Underground Live&quot; (1974) rather than the later studio version from &quot;Loaded&quot; (1970). Also included is &quot;Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)&quot;, which is both a cover and an original, combining a new song by the band with the pop standard &quot;Blue Moon&quot;.

In 2007, the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&#x27; Don&#x27;t Look Back series. Also that year, the band returned to the Church of the Holy Trinity to record a new version of the &quot;Trinity Session&quot; with guest musicians Natalie Merchant, Vic Chesnutt and Ryan Adams. This new set of recordings was released as &quot;Trinity Revisited&quot; to commemorate the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Trinity Session&quot;.

==The recording sessions==
According to the band&#x27;s website, the direction of &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; was influenced by music they had heard while touring the southern United States in support of their debut studio album &quot;Whites Off Earth Now!!&quot; (1986). The album&#x27;s lyrics and instrumentation were lifted from the classic country groups to which the band was exposed, and the song &quot;200 More Miles&quot; was written in reference to the band&#x27;s life on the road.

As they had done on &quot;Whites&quot;, Cowboy Junkies wanted to record live with one stereo microphone direct to tape. Although it is stated on the album cover that the recording was made on two-track R-DAT, according to recording engineer Peter J. Moore, it was actually recorded on a Sony Betamax SL-2000 video cassette deck connected to a Sony PCM-F1 analog/digital converter, using one single Calrec ambisonic microphone.

Moore suggested the Church of the Holy Trinity in Toronto for its natural reverb. To better persuade the officials of the historic church, the band claimed to be the Timmins Family Singers and said they were recording a Christmas special for radio. The session began on the morning of November 27, 1987. The group first recorded the songs with the fewest instruments and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements. In this way, Moore and the band were able to solve acoustic problems one by one. To better balance Margo Timmins&#x27; vocals against the electric guitars and drums, she was recorded through a PA system that had been left behind by a previous group. By making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours, Moore and the band had finally reached the distinctive sound of the album by the time the last of the guest musicians arrived at the church.

The band was unable to rehearse with most of the guest musicians before the day of the session. Considering the method of recording and time constraints, this could have been disastrous for the songs that required seven or more musicians, but after paying a security guard $25 for an extra two hours of recording time, the band was able to finish, recording the final song of the session, &quot;Misguided Angel&quot;, in a single take.

Contrary to popular myth, the album was not entirely recorded in one day. In the hustle of the first recording session, the band did not have time to record Margo Timmins&#x27; a cappella chanting on &quot;Mining for Gold&quot;. She and Moore recorded the song a few days later during the Toronto Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s lunch break.

Sleeve notes state that the recording was not mixed, overdubbed or edited in any way.

The band followed this recording with a three-day session in April 1989 at a Quaker meeting house, but decided against releasing those songs until 2022, when they put out &quot;Sharon – The Lost Album&quot;.

==Accolades==
In 2000, it was ranked number 999 in the third edition of the book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. It was listed as the 42nd best album of the 1980s by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in 2002. In Bob Mersereau&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;, &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; was included at number 62. In 2015, the album was named the winner in the 1980s category of the inaugural Slaight Family Polaris Heritage Prize, an annual Canadian music award for classic albums released prior to the creation of the Polaris Music Prize. It was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2005).

<text>Martin Mathew Dolin (June 15, 1939 – February 14, 2018) was an American-born Canadian politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1985 to 1988, representing the north-end Winnipeg riding of Kildonan as a member of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba.

Dolin was educated at City College of New York, the University of the Americas in Mexico, and Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. In the 1972 Canadian federal election, he ran for the New Democratic Party in Halifax, finishing third against Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield and Liberal Terry McGrath. At the time, Dolin was employed as an executive director for family services.

He also ran for the New Democratic Party of Nova Scotia in the provincial election of 1974, finishing third against Liberal Premier Gerald Regan in the riding of Halifax Needham.

Dolin moved to Manitoba, where his wife Mary Beth Dolin served as a cabinet minister in the government of Howard Pawley in the early 1980s. Following Mary Beth&#x27;s death in 1985, Marty successfully ran to succeed her as the MLA for Kildonan, defeating Tory Bev Rayburn by over 1,000 votes. He was re-elected over Rayburn by a greater margin in the 1986 provincial election, though he was not appointed to Pawley&#x27;s cabinet.

In the 1988 election, Dolin finished third in a close race against Progressive Conservative John Baluta and winning Liberal Gulzar Singh Cheema. He retired from public office and never attempted a political comeback.

In 1994, he published a work entitled &quot;Education in a Multicultural Society&quot;.

After leaving politics, Dolin was a member of the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Interfaith Immigration Council (he himself was Jewish), and the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg. He retired in June 2011 as head of Welcome Place, Manitoba&#x27;s largest refugee-settlement agency. In 2012, he was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal for his public service for refugees.

<doc id="1210696" wikidata="Q2376704" url="?curid=1210696" title="Oleksandr Omelchenko">
<text>Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Omelchenko (; 9 August 1938 – 25 November 2021) was a Ukrainian politician. 

He served as the Mayor of Kyiv from 1999 to 2006. Omelchenko was also a People&#x27;s Deputy of Ukraine from 2007 to 2012.

Omelchenko was the President of both the Association of the Cities of Ukraine and the Ice Hockey Federation of Ukraine (1997–2006). In 2001, he bought FC CSKA Kyiv from the Ministry of Defence and transformed it into FC Arsenal Kyiv.

Omelchenko died on 25 November 2021, aged 83, after being infected with COVID-19 which caused a lesion of the lungs. From 2014 until his death he was a member of the Kyiv City Council.

==Early life==
Oleksandr Omelchenko was born on 9 August 1938, in Vinnytsia Oblast. His highest degree in the Soviet university education system was Candidate of Sciences. After graduation, Omelchenko worked at Kyivmiskbud, where he rose from worker to director of the plant of reinforced concrete structures.

He also became the chief engineer of the construction plant and the first deputy chairman of Kyivmiskbud. Omelchenko worked in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War in 1987–1989.

== Political career ==
After 1989, Omelchenko worked in the system of state construction, he was deputy chairman of the executive committee of the Kyiv City Council, and held the position of general director of Kyivrekonstruktsiya.

In 1994–1996, Omelchenko was the first deputy chairman of the Kyiv City State Administration. In August 1996, he headed this body.

== Mayor of Kyiv ==
During the 1999 Kyiv mayoral election, Omelchenko defeated noted oligarch Hryhoriy Surkis, with 76 percent of the vote to Surkis&#x27;s 16 percent. Omelchenko became the first elected mayor in Ukraine&#x27;s modern history, with a platform highlighting his work in restoring much of Kyiv&#x27;s historic buildings and renovating parts of downtown Kyiv.

On recordings, which were termed the &quot;Second Cassette Scandal&quot; and released in early January 2002, Omelchenko demonstrably urged Viktor Yushchenko to have the Yushchenko-led Our Ukraine bloc and the Omelchenko-led Unity bloc oust Viktor Medvedchuk as first vice speaker of the Rada. On 13 December 2001, Medvedchuk was ousted. The recordings revealed that Omelchenko virulently opposed Medvedchuk and the Medvedchuk led SDPU(o), which supported Leonid Kuchma.

Omelchenko was a candidate in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, nominated by the Unity Party, which he formerly chaired. Omelchenko was the only candidate for President whose son was a deputy in the Verkhovna Rada. His program included the urgent withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Iraq. In the election, he received 0.48% of the vote. 

While he was running for a third term as Mayor of Kyiv in what was expected to be an easy victory in the March 2006 election, he was soundly defeated, with 21% of the votes behind elected mayor Leonid Chernovetskyi and Vitali Klitschko, who would himself later become mayor of Kyiv.

== Later political career ==
During the 2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Omelchenko was elected as an Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc deputy to the Verkhovna Rada. However, he was expelled from the party in September 2011 due to his support of the Azarov Government. Omelchenko proceeded to voluntarily leave the faction the next month. Omelchenko&#x27;s son, also named Oleksandr, was also a member of the Verkhovna Rada on an Our Ukraine ticket from 2002 until 2007.

During the 2008 Kyiv local election, Omelchenko was again a candidate for the post of Mayor of Kyiv, but he only garnered 2.53% of the vote, placing sixth behind incumbent mayor Leonid Chernovetskyi. His Oleksandr Omelchenko Bloc won only 2.26% of the vote, and no seats in the Kyiv City Council.

In the 2012 parliamentary elections, Omelchenko at first intended to attempt to be re-elected into parliament in single-member districts number 220 situated in Kyiv; but he withdrew from the elections.

During the 2014 Kyiv local election, Omelchenko was again a candidate for the post of Mayor of Kyiv, again as a candidate of the Unity Party. He finished 4th in this election with 6.1% of the votes (winner Vitali Klitschko received 56.7%). Unity won 3.3% of the votes and 2 seats in the Kyiv City Council; including a seat for Omelchenko.

Omelchenko did not participate in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election.

In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Omelchenko was a candidate of the Unity Party in single-member district No. 220, located in Kyiv. He took the fifth place in his constituency, gaining 8.28% of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;eldistrict/424/8000000000&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chesno.org/post/42458%&quot;&gt; Transformation of the Unity Party into the Unity of Oleksandr Omelchenko, Civil movement &quot;Chesno&quot; (29 September 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2020 Kyiv local elections, Omelchenko was again candidate for mayor of Kyiv, nominated by Unity of Oleksandr Omelchenko. In this election, the party was the third most popular party of Kyiv, winning 14 seats, and Omelchenko returned to the Kyiv City Council. However, he lost the mayoral election to Vitali Klitschko with 50.52% of the votes. Omelchenko finished in eighth place.

== Death ==
On 18 November 2021, Omelchenko was admitted to hospital after being infected with COVID-19 that had caused a lesion of the lungs. Omelchenko died on 25 November 2021, aged 83.

<text>Sherry Schrull (née Russell; February 8, 1958 – June 15, 2007) was an American professional wrestler and manager, better known by her ring names, Sherri Martel and Sensational Sherri.

Martel began her professional wrestling career in the Mid South after training in Columbia, South Carolina. She joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the mid-1980s and held its AWA World Women&#x27;s Championship three times. In the late 1980s, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where she held the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship. Also in the WWF, Martel continued to act as a manager to wrestlers such as Randy Savage, Ted DiBiase, and Shawn Michaels. She appeared in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the 1990s. In the latter, Martel acted as the manager for the tag team Harlem Heat. After leaving WCW, she made few wrestling related appearances until her death in 2007. She also appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in September 2006 as a manager for Bobby Roode which ended up being her last televised wrestling appearance. Her titular ring name, &quot;Sensational Sherri&quot;, was used as the episode title in the fifth season of Viceland&#x27;s docuseries, &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot;, aired on April 23, 2024.

==Early life==
Sherry Lynn Russell was born on February 8, 1958, in Birmingham, Alabama, and grew up playing basketball and participating in track and field.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1980–1985)===
Martel was first introduced to professional wrestling as a child, when her mother took her and her sister to shows in Mississippi. Their mother initially asked them whether they wanted to attend a wrestling show or go ice skating. In 1974, Martel approached Grizzly Smith for advice on becoming a wrestler, but he questioned her conviction and told her to come back to him in 1980 when she was an adult. She eventually married her second husband and gave birth to a son named Jared, but she soon divorced her husband. During this time, she again became interested in becoming a professional wrestler and sought training from &quot;Mr. Personality&quot; Butch Moore in Memphis, Tennessee. She started wrestling as Sherri Martine, but decided she needed more training. She continued to train at The Fabulous Moolah&#x27;s school, where Moolah changed her name to Sherri Martel and sent her to wrestle in Japan in 1981. Moolah claims that Martel frequented night clubs and liked to party, which resulted in Moolah kicking her out of the school.

After leaving the school, she traveled back to Tennessee. In Memphis, she was managed by Jim Cornette. During a mixed battle royal, Martel suffered an injury that removed her from wrestling temporarily. She then worked as both a wrestler and manager for Pat Rose and Tom Prichard.

===American Wrestling Association (1985–1987)===
After Martel recovered, Larry Zbyszko helped her join the American Wrestling Association (AWA). She eventually debuted in the AWA and, on September 28, 1985, at &quot;SuperClash&quot; in Chicago, she defeated Candi Devine for the AWA World Women&#x27;s Championship. She traded the belt with Devine, and on June 28, 1986, at &quot;Battle by the Bay,&quot; Martel defeated Devine to win the AWA World Women&#x27;s Championship for a third and final time. Martel, however, only held the title briefly before vacating it.

During this time, in addition to wrestling, Martel acted as the manager for the team of &quot;Playboy&quot; Buddy Rose and &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Doug Somers, whom she managed to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Rose and Somers then engaged in a lengthy feud with The Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty), who defeated Rose and Somers for the tag team title on January 27, 1987, in St. Paul, Minnesota.

===World Wrestling Federation (1987–1993)===

====Debut &amp; Women&#x27;s Champion (1987–1988)====
After former AWA wrestler Jesse Ventura referred her to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), she debuted on July 24, 1987, defeating The Fabulous Moolah for the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship. Renaming herself Sensational Sherri, she reigned as WWF Women&#x27;s Champion for fifteen months before losing it to Rockin&#x27; Robin on October 8, 1988, in Paris. At the Survivor Series in 1987, Martel&#x27;s team consisting of Martel, Women&#x27;s World Tag Team Champions The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin), Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello lost to The Fabulous Moolah&#x27;s team consisting of Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin&#x27; Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki). When the WWF phased out its women&#x27;s division in 1990, Martel remained with the company and turned her attention to managing male wrestlers.

Concurrent with her reign as WWF Women&#x27;s Champion, Martel made several appearances in costume as &quot;Peggy Sue,&quot; the girlfriend of The Honky Tonk Man, who was in the midst of a run as Intercontinental Champion. Her primary role was to irritate Honky&#x27;s opponents—namely, Randy &quot;Macho Man&quot; Savage and Brutus &quot;the Barber&quot; Beefcake—and interfere in his matches.

====Managing Randy Savage and Ted DiBiase (1989–1992)====
After WrestleMania V, Martel confronted Miss Elizabeth, manager of newly dethroned former WWF World champion Randy Savage, during an interview, leading to a confrontation between the two in which Savage fired Miss Elizabeth and repeatedly threatened to hit her. Martel then attacked Hulk Hogan from behind as he came to Miss Elizabeth&#x27;s rescue, leaving him open to a chair attack from Savage, Throughout the remainder of 1989, Martel and Savage feuded with Hogan and Miss Elizabeth. At SummerSlam, Hogan and Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake defeated the team of Savage and Zeus. After the match, Miss Elizabeth knocked out Martel with Martel&#x27;s purse, and she, Hogan, and Beefcake cut Martel&#x27;s hair.

At WrestleMania VI in 1990, Martel and Savage lost a mixed tag-team match against Sapphire and Dusty Rhodes after Miss Elizabeth, who was in the corner of Sapphire and Rhodes, interfered and shoved Martel. During that same year, Martel and Savage appeared on &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot; with Robin Leach. During a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden, The Ultimate Warrior pulled off an escaping Martel&#x27;s miniskirt to reveal matching black garter belts and lace underpants. Practically in tears, Martel raced back to the locker room. At WrestleMania VII, Savage lost a &quot;retirement match&quot; against The Ultimate Warrior, in which the loser would be forced (Kayfabe) to retire. After Savage lost the match, an irate Martel attacked Savage but was thrown from the ring by Miss Elizabeth, who had been watching from the audience.

Later on the WrestleMania VII card after she and Savage parted ways following the career match, Martel came to the ring to help &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase in his assault on an injured Rowdy Roddy Piper, following which she managed DiBiase until 1992.

====Pairing and feuding with Shawn Michaels (1992–1993)====
Subsequently, Martel began managing Shawn Michaels after Pat Patterson convinced Michaels to participate in the storyline. In February 1992, during Paul Bearer&#x27;s interview segment The Funeral Parlor, Sherri declared she was now &quot;in love&quot; with Shawn Michaels, who had just turned on his longtime tag team partner Marty Jannetty. She also sang Michaels&#x27; theme song called &quot;Sexy Boy&quot;. As part of his gimmick, Michaels would admire himself in a full-length mirror before his matches. At Summerslam in 1992 Sherri was ringside for a rare heel vs heel match involving Michaels and Rick Martel. The stipulation of the match was that neither man could hit the other in the face which was attributed to the arrogant yet handsome characters of both men. Both Michaels and Martel fought for the affections of Sherri after the double count out result of the match when Sherri feigned fainting requiring both men to come to blows and attempt to carry Sherri backstage. In 1992, before a match, Jannetty grabbed the mirror and attempted to hit Michaels with it, but Michaels pulled Martel in front of him. After being hit with the mirror, she was absent from television until the Royal Rumble in January 1993. At the Rumble, she was in a neutral corner for the match between Michaels and Jannetty but eventually turned on Michaels during the match, cementing a face turn. Backstage, Michaels confronted her and Jannetty came to her rescue. The storyline, however, was cut short as Jannetty was released from the company in the midst of the feud. Martel spent the remainder of the year aligned with Tatanka, who aided her in her feud with Luna Vachon and Bam Bam Bigelow. She was released from the World Wrestling Federation during the summer. Two reasons have been given for Sherri&#x27;s departure: her decision to enroll in cosmetology school and failed drug tests.

===USWA (1993)===
Towards the end of her time in the WWF, Martel participated in a WWF invasion angle in the USWA, reuniting with Savage. Martel would suffer a similar embarrassment to that which she had suffered at the hands of Warrior when she ran in the ring to aid Savage in a steel cage match in Memphis against his old enemy in the area, Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler, but after accidentally knocking Savage from the ring, she had her dress yanked off by Lawler as she climbed the cage to escape.

===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1993)===
After her WWF release, Martel had a brief spell in Smoky Mountain Wrestling, siding with Tracy Smothers in a feud with Tammy Sytch, Brian Lee, as well as several intergender matches with Jim Cornette.

===Eastern Championship Wrestling (1993–1994)===
She began working in Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 1993, managing Shane Douglas. Sherri turned on Douglas in a tag match with Brian Pillman, costing Douglas the match on behalf of Ric Flair. At November to Remember on November 13, Martel faced Malia Hosaka in a match.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1994–1997, 2000) ===
====Managing Ric Flair (1994)====
Martel signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1994. The original plan for her was to manage Kevin and Dave Sullivan against Missy Hyatt and The Nasty Boys, but after Hyatt was fired in February 1994, the proposed rivalry went on with no managers for either team.

Martel made her debut on the April 23 edition of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, under the name Sensuous Sherri, this was because the name Sensational Sherri was trademarked by the WWF. In an interview with Gene Okerlund, she said her goal was to find a man that can bring her the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. She was at ringside during at Slamboree on May 22, during the WCW World Heavyweight Championship match between Ric Flair and Barry Windham. On June 24, a title unification match took place at the &quot;Clash of the Champions XXVII&quot; between WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair and the WCW International World Heavyweight Champion Sting. Although she revealed in the beginning of the match she sided with Sting (including wearing his signature face paint), it turned out to be a double cross, as she sided with Flair, who won the match and unified the titles, double-teaming Sting, until the newly signed Hulk Hogan made the save.

At Bash at the Beach, Martel tried to help Flair to defeat Hogan in a match by giving him brass knuckles, but failed. At the feud&#x27;s climactic battle, a steel cage match at Halloween Havoc, Martel climbed the cage to aid Flair and in the process had her dress pulled off by Jimmy Hart, Hogan&#x27;s manager, leaving her dangling from the cage in black lingerie.

====Managing Harlem Heat (1994–1997)====
Next, Martel began managing Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) using the name Sister Sherri. She managed the team to seven WCW World Tag Team Championship reigns. In late 1994 (while still managing Harlem Heat in WCW), Martel made a return appearance in ECW managing Shane Douglas and Brian Pillman against Ron Simmons and 2 Cold Scorpio.

====Return and final appearances (2000)====
In 2000, she made three wrestling television appearances with WCW. The first was at the Souled Out 2000 pay-per-view event, watching at ringside during the Chris Benoit vs. Sid Vicious matchup for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The second was on the January 19, 2000, edition of &quot;WCW Thunder&quot; where she had a match with Madusa, which she lost. In her third and final appearance in WCW, she had a match with Mona, which she also lost.

===Later career and WWE Hall of Fame (1997–2006)===
After leaving WCW, Martel won the IWA Mid-South Women&#x27;s Title defeating Debbie Combs on August 28, 1997. A few weeks later she dropped the title back to Combs.

Early in 1999, Martel competed in a mixed-tag team match for the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship, a title held predominately by men. Missy Hyatt pinned Martel to win the title. In October 1999, she appeared on the &quot;Heroes of Wrestling&quot; pay-per-view managing Greg Valentine in a match against George Steele. Also in 1999, she was awarded the AWA Superstars Women&#x27;s Championship.

She wrestled her very last match at WrestleReunion on January 29, 2005, teaming with Peggy Lee Leather, Amber O&#x27;Neal and Krissy Vaine losing to Wendi Richter, Malia Hosaka, Bambi and Jenny Taylor.

In 2005, she returned to WWE to take part in a storyline with her former client, Shawn Michaels, and Kurt Angle shortly before their match at WrestleMania 21. She made a return to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, singing Michaels&#x27; theme song (the original recording of Michaels&#x27; theme song featured Martel on vocals) with Angle.

She was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Ted DiBiase in April 2006. Later that year, she worked for TNA Wrestling, taping a backstage vignette trying to offer her managerial services to &quot;free agent&quot; Bobby Roode that aired on the September 21, 2006 &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;; it was her last wrestling television appearance.

==Personal life==
By 2003, she was living in Tennessee with her husband, Robert Schrull, where she helped him renovate houses. She was married and divorced at least twice during her life. She had one son.

==Death==
On June 15, 2007, Martel died at her mother&#x27;s residence in McCalla, Alabama, near Birmingham. She was 49 years old. On September 11, 2007, homicide investigators in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, released the toxicology report stating that she died of an accidental overdose with multiple drugs in her system, including high amounts of oxycodone. She was cremated after her death.

<text>Oleksandr Mykolayovych Rzhavsky (; 30 January 1959 – 27 March 2022) was a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who served as a member of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) from 1998 until 2002.

Rzhavsky was also candidate in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, nominated by the &quot;United Family&quot; Party, of which he was the head. Presidential candidate in 1999, when he won 0.37% of the votes, and finished in 9th place.

He was vice-chair of the board of Montazhspetsbank in 1996–97, and president of Koral Bank in 1997–98. In his program, he promised to establish order in Ukraine, using the methods of Russian President Vladimir Putin. On 13 February 2022 he published on his Facebook profile a comment, where he rhetorically asked &quot;why Russians didn&#x27;t act the same way as fascist occupiers in Crimea&quot;, arguing with the notion of Russia as an occupier.

On 27 March 2022 he was killed by soldiers of the 64th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine at his estate in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast, as part of the Bucha massacre. According to his daughter, he had been abducted twice from his estate by Russian soldiers who had demanded a ransom and, during a drunken binge, had shot him dead. The killing was witnessed by his family who posted an official statement on Rzhavsky&#x27;s Facebook profile. 

Russian media denied killing Rzhavsky on 27 March and on 11 April published an undated recording of Rzhavsky claiming it was recorded on 30 March. On 12 April Investigative Committee of Russia declared it will include the recording in its &quot;investigation on the Bucha fakes&quot; after which Rzhavsky&#x27;s name disappeared from Russian state media coverage, while Russian bloggers continued claiming he was indeed killed, but by &quot;Ukrainian nationalists&quot;.

<text>Jay and the Doctor are the on-air names of Australian radio duo Jason Whalley and Lindsay McDougall, on radio station Triple J.

Best known as members of punk band Frenzal Rhomb, they performed occasional late-night shifts on Triple J until 2004. They temporarily replaced Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel for six weeks in late 2004 while The Chaser Decides covered the federal election.

On 26 November 2004, Jay and the Doctor were announced as the hosts of the Breakfast Show in 2005. The announcement was highly built up by incumbent hosts Adam &amp; Wil. Prior to their employment at the station, their music was banned for a time by Triple J after Frenzal Rhomb criticised the station on air for playing the &quot;same 40 songs&quot;.

Myf Warhurst joined Jay and the Doctor on breakfast in January 2007, to form Myf, Jay and the Doctor. Warhurst announced on 10 October 2007 that she would leave Triple J and co-host a new show with comedian Peter Helliar for Triple M Melbourne.

Jason &quot;Jay&quot; Whalley&#x27;s last broadcast was on Friday, 23 November 2007. The Doctor continued to host the weekday breakfast shift program with Robbie Buck and Marieke Hardy Until the end of 2009. He then hosted the afternoon drive program from 3-5:30pm weekdays replacing Scott Dooley until late 2014.

==Segments==
Some of their on-air antics include the following segments:
* Happy Monday - Jay and The Doctor try to brighten up Monday mornings by playing an infuriating song repeatedly. On 29 August 2005, they initiated &quot;The Happiest Monday Ever&quot; prior to which they encouraged listeners to falsely appear sick in order to take the day off work and spend the morning listening to them broadcast from Jason&#x27;s bed and other parts of his house. Special guests included &quot;The Iron Deficient Chef&quot; Suzy Spoon preparing a vegan breakfast.
* Agony Cox - An agony aunt section featuring Andrew Cox of the popular Melbourne indie band The Fauves, who helps give advice to selected listeners that call in with a personal problem that needs addressing.
* Dreamweaver- Listeners call up and describe recent dreams to Jason and he interprets them. Jason often parodies cold reading. At some point the segment became &quot;speed&quot;weaver, where Jason gives a short one or two sentence response before quickly moving onto the next caller. Then it became &quot;scream&quot;weaver, where Jason screams his response.
* The Friday F***wit- Jay and the doctor nominate a person, feeling, object or incident in the news that week who they think deserves particular recognition. To play up the humour, it is not always obvious and the reasoning may be quite strange. The award can not be received twice by the same person.
* Under the weather sessions- A well-known musician will teach Jay and the Doctor how to play one of their songs. Originally this was to play in the background of one of the weather readings, hence the name. Now the weather is often sung by the guest.

==Skits==
Like several other Triple J programs with comedic content, Jay and the Doctor produce short skits that are played during their program as well as at other times of day.

===Series===
* Battalion 666- An increasingly bizarre radio serial about &quot;HMS Beelzebub&quot;, a fictitious ship of the Royal Navy staffed entirely of satanists. Most of the crew are also well-known celebrities. Their dialogue is made up of either (bad) impersonations from Jay or the Doctor (some examples are New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, Corey Taylor from Slipknot, The Chemical Brothers and even fellow Triple J hosts John Safran and sometimes, Craig Reucassel), or repetitive samples of the celebrity&#x27;s voice (some examples are Russell Crowe/&quot;Maximus&quot; and Billy Corgan and Jacki O stunt bum - reference to a rival broadcaster Jackie &quot;O&quot; (O&#x27;Neil)). The only regular character that is not a famous celebrity is &quot;The Cook&quot;. Jay and the Doctor also appeared as themselves in the episode &quot;Did I Mention We Won A Logie?&quot;. The series originated from the story that the Royal Navy would allow practising satanist crew members on board its ships and first aired during Jay and the Doctor&#x27;s temporary Saturday afternoon program.
* Space Goat- A serial involving a goat in outer space. Parodies early-era sci-fi radio serials, by having a large starting and ending narration, with the &#x27;actual&#x27; episode consisting of a single audio clip of a goat, roughly a second long. The goat sound never changes.
* Time Maniac- A serial involving an adventurer (played by fellow Triple J presenter Robbie Buck) who, due to a scientific mishap, perpetually travels to different time periods every five seconds. Every episode involves Time Maniac arriving at a turning point in history, but being thrown back through time just as he tries to mention future events.
* 7:30 Resort- A send-up of typically biased &quot;on-the-scene&quot; news reporting. This involves head anchor &quot;Jason Jay&quot; Whalley delivering the headlines poolside at a tropical resort, while on-the-scene reporter &quot;Radios&quot; The Doctor becomes involved with the situation in a comic manner.
* Musical Challenge- Claiming that they themselves prove that musicians should not talk, Jay and the Doctor propose an alternative method for interviewing musicians; by having them respond with their instruments.
* Gamblers Anonymous Help Line- A parody of a gamblers help line. Jason bullies the desperate callers into continuing gambling to win their money back.
* Flack- A parody of Triple J&#x27;s current affairs program, Hack.
* Steve Tankerfield&#x27;s Trafficking Report- A parody of traffic reports given from a helicopter, but reporting on drug trafficking.
* Swamp Donkey- A serial spun off from Space Goat that allows listeners to submit their own scripts using a predefined sound.

===One-offs===
* Interview and Interrogation - Following allegations by Mamdouh Habib of mistreatment while he was imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay, certain government ministers and intelligence officials were contradicting each other over whether he was interviewed or interrogated. Jay and the Doctor apply the same level of ambiguity to interviewing musical guests.
* Caring Through Swearing - Jay and the Doctor claim it is better to swear at a child than to hit them.
* Asia vs The rest of the world - Following the &quot;Asia vs The rest of the world&quot; charity cricket match, Jay and the Doctor propose a follow-up; &quot;Asia vs The rest of the world: The War!&quot; In the interest of humanity and charity.
* Tsuna-you Tsuna-me - A song by Jay and the Doctor about donations made to help the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, claiming we do it &quot;so we can feel good about ourselves&quot;. This song caused some controversy, at least on conservative talk-back radio stations .

<text>Nataliya Mykhailivna Vitrenko (; born December 28, 1951) is a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician and scientist.

Since 2014, Nataliya Vitrenko has been living in Moscow. She blames the West and Ukraine for charging of Russo-Ukrainian War.

==Presidential candidacy==

Born in Kyiv, she was a candidate in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, nominated by the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, which she has chaired since 1996. In the 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election, her party won 3.22% of the votes. She was a presidential candidate in 1999, when she won 11% of the votes to finish in 4th place. In the 2004 elections, however, she finished in fifth place and received less than 5% of the vote.

On October 2, 1999, Vitrenko was attacked and wounded following a campaign rally when two unknown assailants threw two hand grenades at a crowd gathered outside one of her campaign events.

Natalia Vitrenko was again nominated by the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine as candidate for the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election but the CECoU (Central Election Commission of Ukraine) refused to register her for failure to pay the required 2.5 million hryvnya nomination deposit. Vitrenko did not agree with the refusal, submitted a complaint to the judge and before his very eyes tore down the Ukrainian constitution as a protest. On November 11, 2009, Vitrenko said: &quot;Ukraine is condemned either to collapse, or to make a revolution. To Ukrainian government, Constitution of Ukraine is nothing but toilet paper.&quot;
Vitrenko&#x27;s 1999 campaign was characterized by &quot;The Ukrainian Weekly&quot; as &quot;fierce populism, nostalgia for the Soviet era, and strong anti-Western sentiments&quot;.

==Involvement with Lyndon LaRouche==
Andrew Madison, writing in &quot;Vremya Novostei&quot;, said that Vitrenko&#x27;s ideological foundations were partially American in origin, because along with the Marxism she was also influenced by the ideas of Lyndon LaRouche. On her political website, Vitrenko says that she has very similar views to LaRouche on the sinister role of the International Monetary Fund and the dollarization of speculative capital, which she says has become a threat to humanity. She attended a conference in 1995 in Germany, organized by Lyndon LaRouche and Helga Zepp-LaRouche, which passed a &quot;Memorandum of humanity&quot; drafted by Vitrenko.

==Political positions==
Vitrenko is a member of the Eurasian Youth Union, a group led by Russian philosopher Alexandr Dugin. 

==Personal life==
She is a mother of three children. Including Yuriy Vitrenko. In 2021, she accused her son Yuriy of Russophobia.

<doc id="1210718" wikidata="Q5135523" url="?curid=1210718" title="Closure (container)">
<text>A closure is a device used to close or seal a container such as a bottle, jug, jar, tube, or can. A closure may be a cap, cover, lid, plug, liner, or the like. The part of the container to which the closure is applied is called the finish.

Other types of containers such as boxes and drums may also have closures but are not discussed in this article. Many containers and packages require a means of closing, which can be a separate device or seal or sometimes an integral latch or lock.

==Purpose of closures==

The closure is often the most critical part of a package, and must fulfill all of the basic functions of packaging in addition to being easy to open and (if applicable) reclose.

Depending on the contents and container, closures have several functions:
* Keep the container closed and the contents contained for the specified shelf life until time of opening
* Provide a barrier to dirt, oxygen, moisture, etc. Control of permeation is critical to many types of products: foods, chemicals, etc.
* Keep the product secure from undesired premature opening
* Provide a means of reclosing or reusing the container
* Assist in dispensing and use of product
* Allow reasonable ease to open the container by the intended user. Difficult to open containers may cause wrap rage. The force or torque required to open a closure is an important consideration for packaging engineers.

Many types of packaging with their closures are regulated for strength, safety, security, communication, recycling, and environmental requirements plus many others.

==Types of closures==

Closures need a means of attaching to the container with sufficient security. Threads, lugs, hinges, locks, adhesives, etc. are used. Many plastic closures are made by injection molding.

Many closures need to have the ability to adjust to slight manufacturing variation in the container and the closure structure. Some closures are made of flexible material such as cork, rubber, or plastic foam. Often an o-ring or a closure liner (gasket made of pulp or foam cap liner) is used. Linerless closures often use a deformable plastic rim or structure to maintain the seal.

Secondary seals are common with sensitive products that may deteriorate or where extra security is needed. Foil or plastic inner seals are used on some bottles, Heat sealed lidding films are used on some tubs. External shrink bands, labels, and tapes are sometimes used outside the primary closure structure. Additionally, many closures feature ventilation to prevent bloating, collapse or explosion due to unequalized pressure during processing or storage. Venting technologies utilize common materials such as PTFE, PP, etc. These elements are preferred due to their ability to withstand temperatures of 260 °C and water intrusion pressure levels of 770 mbar.

===Screw top===

A screw closure is a mechanical device which is screwed on and off of a threaded &quot;finish&quot; on a container. Either continuous threads (C-T) or lugs are used. Metal caps can be either preformed or in some instances, rolled on after application. Plastic caps may use several types of molded polymer.

Some screw tops have multiple pieces. For example, a mason jar often has a lid with a built in rubbery seal and a separate threaded ring or band.

===Crown cap===
Beverage bottles are frequently closed with crown beverage caps. These are shallow metal caps that are crimped into locking position around the head of the bottle.

===Snap on===
Some closures snap on. For opening, the top is designed to pry off or, break off, or have a built in dispenser.

===Friction fit===

Some containers have a loose lid for a closure. Laboratory glassware often has ground glass joints that allow the pieces to be fitted together easily.

An Interference fit or friction fit requires some force to close and open, providing additional security. Paint cans often have a friction fit plug.

===Tamper-evident===


Resistance to tampering is required for some types of products. Container closures can be one of several layers of packaging to deter tampering and to provide evidence of attempts at tampering. *Sometimes tamper resistance is obtained by a tamper-evident band; separate or integral with the closure.
===Dispensing===

A wide variety of convenience dispensing features can be built into closures. Spray bottles and cans with aerosol spray (valves, actuator) have special closure requirements. Pour spouts, triggers, sprayer cap, measuring attachments, sifting devices, etc. are common caps.

===Spray bottle===
A spray bottle is a bottle that can dispense, squirt, spray or mist fluids. A common use for spray bottles is dispensing cool cleaners, cosmetics, and chemical specialties.

===Child-resistant===

Child-resistant packaging or C-R packaging has special closures designed to reduce the risk of children ingesting dangerous items. This is often accomplished by the use of a special safety cap. It is required by regulation for prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, pesticides, and household chemicals.

==Examples==
==History==
Early pottery and ceramic containers often had lids that fit reasonably snug onto the body of the container. The narrow necks of ancient amphora were closed with a plug of cork, wood, or ceramic and sealed with mortar.
Wooden Barrels often had bungholes closed by cork or wood bungs.

Some early tinplate cans were made with threaded necks for screw top closures.

Beverage bottles started using the Hutter Stopper in 1893. This involved a porcelain fitted with a rubber washer, which was then forced down into the lip of the bottle. This technique only works with carbonated beverages. The Hutter Stopper became standard in beer bottling in the late 1890s / early 1900s. Bail closures on bottles were invented by Henry William Putnam in 1859. These involved heavy wire bail attached to a bottle&#x27;s neck that swung over the cork to hold it in.

The world&#x27;s first modern bottle cap, the crown cork, was invented by William Painter in 1890 in Baltimore.
The screw cap using rust resistant aluminum was first used in prescription drug bottling in the 1920s. Molded urea based bottle caps were first introduced in the early 1900s.

A history of accidents involving children opening household packaging and ingesting the contents led the US Congress to pass the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.

==The manufacture of closures==
The International Society of Beverage Technologists (ISBT) is the main trade association for closure manufacturers. It develops voluntary industry standards for its members to use in the manufacture of closures.

==Biography==
Lindsay McDougall was born on 3 March 1978 and grew up in Sydney. His mother owns a health food store and he has younger twin brothers (born c. 1980). At 14 years old, he started playing guitar and his early influences were Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, The Meanies and Cosmic Psychos. He played in high school bands, Time Bandits followed by Negla Delta from year 7 to year 10.

===Frenzal Rhomb===

In August 1996 Lindsay McDougall joined Australian punk rock band Frenzal Rhomb after original guitarist Ben Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist. Frenzal Rhomb had formed in Sydney in 1992 with mainstay Jason Whalley on lead vocals. In November 1996 the group issued a CD EP, &quot;Punch in the Face&quot; and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out. Late that year they toured the United States supporting less than jake with Blink-182 opening. In September 1997, the band released their third album, &quot;Meet the Family&quot;. It was their first to be certified gold by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).

The next Frenzal Rhomb LP, &quot;A Man&#x27;s Not a Camel&quot; was released in March 1999 and was supported by a nationwide tour. It remains their highest placed album to date, reaching No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It spawned their highest-charting single, &quot;You Are Not My Friend&quot;, which reached No. 48. The song was co-written by McDougall with fellow band members Whalley, Lex Feltham and Gordy Forman. In April 2003 the band released &quot;Sans Souci&quot;, followed by &quot;Forever Malcolm Young&quot; in 2006.

During 2003 McDougall organised &quot;Rock Against Howard&quot;, a compilation album, by various Australian musicians as a protest against incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard&#x27;s government. It was released in August 2004, before the October federal election, when Howard&#x27;s coalition was re-elected. Also that year, McDougall and Whalley formed a side-project, Self Righteous Brothers, as an alternative rock group and issued the album, &quot;Love Songs for the Wrong at Heart&quot; on Shock Records. A track, &quot;There&#x27;s No Town Like Snowtown&quot; referenced the Snowtown murders and was labelled &quot;insensitive&quot; by the Adelaide Tourism Commission after being played on radio. For the album, McDougall provided lead vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, banjo, piano, violin, viola, cello, pan flute, glockenspiel, zither, timbales, and cymbals.

In March 2009 Frenzal Rhomb undertook The Boys are Back in Brown Tour, the following year they toured Japan and played a number of festivals in Australia, including Come Together and Rollercoaster. In December 2010, they joined the No Sleep Til Festival Tour with punk and metal bands: Megadeth, Descendents, NOFX, Gwar and Dropkick Murphys. In August 2011 Frenzal Rhomb issued their next album &quot;Smoko at the Pet Food Factory&quot;.

===Triple J===

In January 2005 Lindsay McDougall and Whalley took over as hosts of national youth radio station, Triple J&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Show&quot;, under the name, Jay and the Doctor. New radio skits included Space Goat and Battalion 666, as well as the Under the Weather Sessions and The Friday Fuck Wit. In January 2007, former &quot;Lunch&quot; presenter, Myf Warhurst, joined McDougall and Whalley as a permanent member of the &quot;Breakfast Show&quot; team. Whalley left the show at the end of the year to travel overseas.

The 2008–2009 &quot;Breakfast Show&quot; line up was Robbie Buck, McDougall and Marieke Hardy, and were known as Robbie, Marieke and the Doctor. The show continued The Friday Fuck Wit segment and included the radio serial, Claytron, produced by Australian comedian Sam Simmons. The show also contained the weekly Like a Version segment where recording artists perform a cover version of a song of their choice.

In November 2009, Triple J announced that Tom Ballard and Alex Dyson, hosts of the 2009 &quot;Weekend Breakfast&quot; show, would take over as hosts of the 2010 &quot;Breakfast Show&quot;. The move was seen as a generational change catering to Triple J&#x27;s 18- to 24-year-old core demographic. In December, McDougall was announced as the new host of the 3–5.30 pm afternoon &quot;Drive&quot; program for the following year. The move came after the 2008–2009 &quot;Drive&quot; presenter, Scott Dooley, signed with rival station, Nova 96.9.

At the start of 2010, McDougall asked listeners to take pictures of their &quot;awesome stuff, precious things and treasured items&quot; to help decorate his new blog and Triple J website. In May listeners were asked to use their Twitter accounts to tweet food band puns, which could then be mentioned in the show. The topic trended globally at number 1 and number 2 on Twitter under the hashtags #bandfooodpuns and #foodbandpuns. In March Drive with The Doctor was broadcast from Alice Springs for Triple J&#x27;s One Night Stand. In July and August it was broadcast from Woodford, Queensland for Splendour in the Grass, the program included live sets and interviews with bands from the festival line up. Guests on the 2010 program included Jack White, Lou Reed, Bret Easton Ellis, Chuck Palahniuk, MUSE, Phoenix, Arcade Fire, Damon Albarn, Mumford &amp; Sons and Dizzee Rascal. Since 2010 The Doctor&#x27;s show has been produced by his EP, Hannah Wickes.

During his evening show on Triple J on Thursday 16 October 2014, McDougall announced that he will be leaving the show after 10 years of service to Triple J. He announced it with a song he recorded off air titled &quot;I&#x27;m F***ing Off&quot;. He departed Triple J on 12 December 2014.

==Personal life==
McDougall is a vegan and animal rights activist.

In May 2011 McDougall, told John Safran that he was allergic to wheat, eggplant, cashew and pistachio nuts in a discussion about his diet on Triple J. In August, McDougall asked for donations to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees – he staged a homage to Children Collide&#x27;s music video for &quot;Loveless&quot; while he had his long hair cut off.

McDougall married Jen Owens in October 2015 at Sublime Point.

Despite a strong band culture of drinking, McDougall quit alcohol on New Year&#x27;s Day 2021, after his wife had done so three months previously.

<doc id="1210729" wikidata="Q6211006" url="?curid=1210729" title="Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling">
<text>[[Joe Louis]] vs. [[Max Schmeling]] (or Max Schmeling vs. Joe Louis) refers to either of two separate fights between the two boxers which are among boxing&#x27;s most famous bouts. Schmeling won the first match in 1936 by a knockout in round 12 and Louis won the second bout in 1938 with a knockout in the first round. 

The two fights came to embody the broader political and social conflict of the time. As the most significant African American athlete of his age and the most successful black fighter since Jack Johnson, Louis was a focal point for African American interest in the 1930s. Moreover, as a contest between representatives of the United States and Nazi Germany during the 1930s, the fights came to symbolize the struggle between democracy and fascism.

==Prelude to first fight==
Joe Louis was born in Alabama, but lived much of his early years in Detroit. As a successful African American professional in the northern part of the country, Louis was seen by many other Americans as a symbol of the liberated black man. Since becoming a professional heavyweight, Louis amassed a record of 24–0 and was considered invincible heading into his first bout with Schmeling in 1936. Louis&#x27; celebrity was particularly important for African Americans of the era, who were not only suffering economically along with the rest of the country but also were the targets of significant racially motivated violence, particularly in Southern states by members of the Ku Klux Klan. By the time of the Louis-Schmeling match, Schmeling was thought of as the final stepping stone to Louis&#x27; eventual title bid.

Max Schmeling, on the other hand, was born in Germany, and he had become the first world heavyweight champion to win the title by disqualification in 1930, against American Jack Sharkey. One year later, Schmeling retained his title by a Round 15 knockout against William Stribling. Later Schmeling lost the title in a rematch with Sharkey by a very controversial decision in 1932. As a result, Schmeling was well known to American boxing fans and was still considered the No. 2 contender for James Braddock&#x27;s heavyweight title in 1936. Nevertheless, many boxing fans considered Schmeling, 30 years old by the time of his first match with Louis, to be on the decline and not a serious challenge for the Brown Bomber.

Perhaps, as a result, Louis took training for the Schmeling fight none too seriously. Louis&#x27; training retreat was at Lakewood, New Jersey, where Louis was introduced to the game of golf – later to become a lifelong passion. Louis spent significant time on the golf course rather than training.
Conversely, Schmeling prepared intently for the bout. Schmeling had thoroughly studied Louis&#x27;s style, and believed he had found a weakness: Louis&#x27;s habit of dropping his left hand low after a jab.

Although the political aspect of the first Louis-Schmeling bout would later be dwarfed by the crucible of the later 1938 rematch, brewing political sentiment would inevitably attach itself to the fight. Adolf Hitler had become chancellor of Germany three years previously and, although the United States and Germany were not yet political or military enemies, there was some tension building among the two countries as the Nazi Party began asserting its supremacist ideologies. Schmeling&#x27;s Jewish manager, Joe Jacobs, set up Schmeling&#x27;s training at a Jewish resort in the Catskills.

==First fight==

The first fight between Louis and Schmeling took place on June 19, 1936, at the famous Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York. The referee was the legendary Arthur Donovan, and the stadium&#x27;s seats were sold out. The bout was scheduled for fifteen rounds. 57 million people listened on their radios.

Schmeling&#x27;s study of Louis&#x27; style led him to openly say, in days before the fight, that he had found the key to victory; fans thought that he was just trying to raise interest in the fight. Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion.

Schmeling spent the first three rounds using his jab while sneaking his right cross behind his jab. Louis was stunned by his rival&#x27;s style. In the fourth round, a snapping right landed on Louis&#x27; chin, and Louis was sent to the canvas for the first time in his twenty-eight professional fights. As the fight progressed, stunned fans and critics alike watched Schmeling continue to use this style effectively, and Louis had no idea how to solve the puzzle.

As rounds went by, Louis suffered various injuries, including one to the eye. Louis remained busy, trying to land a punch that would give him a knockout victory, but, with eyesight trouble and Schmeling&#x27;s jab constantly in his face, this proved impossible.

By round twelve, Schmeling was far ahead on the judges&#x27; scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis&#x27; body, followed by another right hand, this one to the jaw. Louis fell near his corner and was counted out by Donovan. This was Louis&#x27; only knockout defeat during his first run: the only other knockout happened when Rocky Marciano knocked Louis out fifteen years later. By then, Louis was considered a faded champion and Marciano a rising star.

Among the attendees at Louis&#x27; defeat was Langston Hughes, a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance and noted literary figure. Hughes described the national reaction to Louis&#x27; defeat in these terms:

I walked down Seventh Avenue and saw grown men weeping like children, and women sitting in the curbs with their heads in their hands. All across the country that night when the news came that Joe was knocked out, people cried.

Conversely, the German reaction to the outcome was jubilant. Hitler contacted Schmeling&#x27;s wife, sending her flowers and a message: &quot;For the wonderful victory of your husband, our greatest German boxer, I must congratulate you with all my heart.&quot; Schmeling dutifully reciprocated with nationalistic comments for the German press, telling a German reporter after the fight:

At this moment I have to tell Germany, I have to report to the Fuehrer in particular, that the thoughts of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Fuehrer and his faithful people were thinking of me. This thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany&#x27;s colors.

==Prelude to second fight==

After his victory over Louis, Schmeling negotiated for a title bout with world heavyweight champion James J. Braddock. But the talks fell through – partially because of the more lucrative potential of a Louis-Braddock matchup, and partially because of the possibility that, in the event of a Schmeling victory, Nazi authorities would not allow subsequent title challenges by American opponents. Instead, Louis fought Braddock on June 22, 1937, knocking him out in eight rounds in Chicago. Louis, however, publicly announced after the fight that he refused to recognize himself as world champion until he fought Schmeling again.

The United States economy had long been suffering from the Great Depression when these two combatants had their two fights. The economic problem affected the United States throughout the 1930s, and many Americans sought inspiration in the world of sports.

Compounding the economic instability was a heated political conflict between Nazi Germany and the United States. By the time of the Louis–Schmeling rematch in 1938, Nazi Germany had taken over Austria in the Anschluss, heightening tensions between Germany and the other Western powers, and generating much anti-German propaganda in the American media. The German regime generated an onslaught of racially charged propaganda of its own; much of it created by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels based on Schmeling&#x27;s success in the boxing world.

Schmeling did not relish being the focus of such propaganda. He was not a member of the Nazi Party and – although proud of his German nationality – denied the Nazi claims of racial superiority: &quot;I am a fighter, not a politician. I am no superman in any way.&quot; Schmeling kept his Jewish manager, Joe Jacobs, despite significant pressure, and, in a dangerous political gamble, refused the &quot;Dagger of Honor&quot; award offered by Adolf Hitler. In fact, Schmeling had been urged by his friend and legendary ex-champion Jack Dempsey to defect and declare American citizenship. Schmeling never did revoke his German citizenship, however. Schmeling was quoted saying, &quot;Once a German, always a German.&quot;

Nevertheless, the Nazi regime exploited Schmeling in its propaganda efforts and took careful steps to at least ensure Schmeling&#x27;s nominal compliance. Schmeling&#x27;s wife and mother were kept from traveling with him to avert any attempt he might make to defect.

Schmeling&#x27;s entourage also included an official Nazi Party publicist. The publicist not only controlled any possible contrarian remarks by Schmeling, but also issued statements that a black man could not defeat Schmeling, and that Schmeling&#x27;s purse from the fight would be used to build more German tanks. Hitler himself lifted the nationwide 3:00 a.m. curfew so that cafés and bars could carry the broadcast for their patrons. As a result, the perception of the American public had turned decidedly against Schmeling between 1936 and 1938. Schmeling was picketed at his hotel room, received a tremendous amount of hate mail, and was assaulted with cigarette butts and other detritus as he approached the ring.

A few weeks before the rematch, Louis visited President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the White House. The &quot;New York Times&quot; quoted Roosevelt as telling the fighter, &quot;Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany.&quot; In his 1976 biography, Louis wrote, &quot;I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending on me.&quot; This time, Louis took training for the bout seriously, giving up golf and women throughout his training. Joe Louis said to a friend before the fight, &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m scared. I&#x27;m scared I might kill Schmeling.&quot;

A few days before the fight, the New York State Athletic Commission had ruled that Joe Jacobs, Schmeling&#x27;s manager, was ineligible to work in the German&#x27;s corner, or be in the locker room, as punishment for a previous public relations infraction involving fighter &quot;Two-Ton&quot; Tony Galento. In addition, Schmeling&#x27;s normal cornerman, Doc Casey, declined to work with Schmeling, fearing bad publicity. As a result, Schmeling sat anxiously in the locker room before the bout; in contrast, Louis took a two-hour nap.

==Second fight==

The Louis-Schmeling rematch came on June 22, 1938 – one year from the day Louis had won the world Heavyweight title. The fighters met once again in a sold-out Yankee Stadium in New York City. Among the more than 70,000 fans in attendance were Clark Gable, Douglas Fairbanks, Gary Cooper, Gregory Peck, and J. Edgar Hoover. The fight drew gate receipts of $1,015,012 (equivalent to $ million in ). 70 million listened on radio in the U.S., and over 100 million around the world.

Schmeling came out of his corner trying to utilize the same style that got him the victory in their first fight, with a straight-standing posture and his left hand prepared to begin jabbing.

Louis&#x27; strategy, however, had been to get the fight over early. Before the fight, he mentioned to his trainer Jack &quot;Chappie&quot; Blackburn that he would devote all his energy to the first three rounds, and even told sportswriter Jimmy Cannon that he predicted a knockout in one. After only a few seconds of feinting, Louis unleashed a tireless barrage on Schmeling. Referee Arthur Donovan stopped the action for the first time just over one minute and a half into the fight after Louis connected on five left hooks and a body blow to Schmeling&#x27;s lower left which had him audibly crying in pain. After sending Louis briefly to his corner, Donovan quickly resumed action, after which Louis went on the attack again, immediately felling the German with a right hook to the face. Schmeling went down this time, arising on the count of three.

Louis then resumed his barrage, this time focusing on Schmeling&#x27;s head. After connecting on three clean shots to Schmeling&#x27;s jaw, the German fell to the canvas again, arising at the count of two. With Schmeling having few defenses left at this point, Louis connected at will, sending Schmeling to the canvas for the third time in short order, this time near the ring&#x27;s center. Schmeling&#x27;s cornerman Max Machon threw a towel in the ring – although, under New York state rules, this did not end the fight. Machon was therefore forced to enter the ring at the count of eight, at which point Donovan had already declared the fight over. Louis was the winner and world Heavyweight champion, by a technical knockout, two minutes and four seconds into the first round. In all, Louis had thrown 41 punches in the fight, 31 of which landed solidly. Schmeling, by contrast, had been able to throw only two punches. Soundly defeated, Schmeling had to be admitted to Polyclinic Hospital for ten days. During his stay, it was discovered that Louis had cracked several vertebrae in Schmeling&#x27;s back.

Schmeling and his handlers complained after the bout that Louis&#x27; initial volley had included an illegal kidney punch, and even refused Louis&#x27; visitation at the hospital. The claim resounded hollowly in the media, however, and they eventually chose not to file a formal complaint.

==Aftermath==
The fight had racial as well as political undertones. Much of black America pinned its hopes on the outcome of this Joe Louis fight and his other matches, seeing Louis&#x27; success as a vehicle for advancing the cause of African Americans everywhere. In his autobiography, Schmeling himself confirmed the public&#x27;s reaction to the outcome, recounting his ambulance ride to the hospital afterward: &quot;As we drove through Harlem, there were noisy, dancing crowds. Bands had left the nightclubs and bars and were playing and dancing on the sidewalks and streets. The whole area was filled with celebration, noise, and saxophones, continuously punctuated by the calling of Joe Louis&#x27; name.&quot;

Reaction in the mainstream American press, while positive toward Louis, reflected the implicit racism in the United States at the time. Lewis F. Atchison of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; began his story: &quot;Joe Louis, the lethargic, chicken-eating young colored boy, reverted to his dreaded role of the &#x27;brown bomber&#x27; tonight&quot;; Henry McLemore of the United Press called Louis &quot;a jungle man, completely primitive as any savage, out to destroy the thing he hates.&quot;

The day after the fight, blues musician Bill Gaither recorded one of his most famous songs, &quot;Champ Joe Louis,&quot; a song praising the champ in his defeat of Max Schmeling. 

Although Schmeling rebounded professionally from the loss to Louis (winning the European Heavyweight Title in 1939 by knocking out Adolf Heuser in the 1st round), the Nazi regime would cease promoting him as a national hero. Schmeling and Nazi authorities grew further in opposition over time. During the Kristallnacht of November 1938, Schmeling provided sanctuary for two young Jewish boys to safeguard them from the Gestapo. Conversely, as a way of punishing Schmeling for his increasingly public resistance, Hitler drafted Schmeling into paratrooper duty in the German Luftwaffe. After brief military service and a comeback attempt in 1947–48, Schmeling retired from professional boxing. He would go on to invest his earnings in various post-War businesses. His resistance to the Nazi party elevated his status once again to that of a hero in post-war Germany.

Louis went on to become a major celebrity in the United States and is considered the first true African American national hero. When other prominent blacks questioned whether African Americans should serve against the Axis nations in the segregated U.S. Armed Forces, Louis disagreed, saying, &quot;There are a lot of things wrong with America, but Hitler ain&#x27;t gonna fix them.&quot; He would go on and serve the United States Army during World War II, but he did not engage in battle while the war was going on. He mostly visited soldiers in Europe to provide them with motivational speeches and with boxing exhibitions. He kept defending the world heavyweight title until 1949, making twenty-five consecutive title defenses – still, a world record among all weight divisions for men&#x27;s boxing (Regina Halmich, a woman boxer, made 29 defenses of her Women&#x27;s International Boxing Federation world Flyweight championship).

Louis&#x27; finances evaporated later in life, and he became involved in the use of illicit drugs.

Louis and Schmeling developed a friendship outside the ring, which endured until Louis&#x27; death on April 12, 1981. Their rivalry and friendship was the focus of the 1978 TV movie &quot;Ring of Passion&quot;. Louis got a job as a greeter at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas, and Schmeling flew to visit him every year. Louis was reportedly so in need of money, but too damaged to box anymore, so the former champion took up professional wrestling to make ends meet. Schmeling reportedly also sent Louis money in Louis&#x27; later years and covered a part of the costs of Louis&#x27; funeral, at which he was a pallbearer. Schmeling died 24 years later on February 2, 2005, at the age of 99. He was ranked 55 on &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time in 2003.

Both Louis and Schmeling are members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Louis–Schmeling paradox==
The rivalry between Louis and Schmeling gave rise to the Louis–Schmeling paradox, a concept in sports economics. It was first identified and named by Walter C. Neale, in his article &quot;The peculiar economics of professional sports&quot;, published in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; in February 1964. The paradox, as identified by Neale, is that the general rule that monopoly is the &quot;ideal market position of a firm&quot; does not hold for professional sports. Where non-sporting firms are &quot;better off the smaller or less important the competition&quot;, sporting firms require competitors to be successful: if Joe Louis had had no competitors, he &quot;would have had no one to fight and therefore no income&quot;. Neale resolved the paradox by drawing a distinction between sporting competition and market competition, holding that &quot;the firm in law, as organized in the sporting world, is not the firm of economic analysis&quot;.

The paradox is sometimes re-stated as &quot;commercial sporting organizations need close competition if they are to be able to maximize their income&quot;, as a result of Neale&#x27;s further conclusion that &quot;demand for competition will decrease if the spectators can predict the outcome of the game&quot;. However, this has been challenged by Roger G. Noll, who noted in the &quot;Oxford Review of Economic Policy&quot; in 2003 that &quot;a team that has dropped out of contentions for a championship will generally draw poorly, but it is likely to sell more tickets if it is playing a team that is at or near that top of the standings than if it is playing another weak team, even though the outcome of the latter game is more uncertain&quot;.

<doc id="1210731" wikidata="Q7898129" url="?curid=1210731" title="Up to No Good">
<text>Up to No Good is the third solo album by the American musician Peter Wolf, released in 1990 on MCA Records.

==Production==
The album was produced by Wolf, Robert White Johnson, and Taylor Rhodes. &quot;Never Let It Go&quot; is about the car crash that killed Wolf&#x27;s high school girlfriend.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; missed &quot;the juvenile appeal that Wolf lucked into just before he and his J. Geils Band buddies went their separate ways.&quot; The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s a charming record, a lively and knowledgeable tome that finds its ground somewhere between the Detroit and Philadelphia schools of soul, while standing firm on a harder rock footing.&quot;

The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; labeled some of the songs &quot;classic primal funk with a conscience.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; dismissed the album as &quot;just one more attempt to capitalize on the appealing, but somewhat limited, rockaboogie sound Geils and company milked throughout the seventies.&quot;

<text>Unitec (Māori: Te Whare Wānanga o Wairaka) is the largest institute of technology in Auckland, New Zealand. 16,844 students study programmes from certificate to postgraduate degree level (levels 1 to 9) across a range of subjects.

The main campus is situated in Mt Albert while a secondary Waitākere campus is situated in Henderson and there are various pop-ups throughout the North Shore. It also offers programs overseas.

==History==
Unitec was founded as Carrington Technical Institute in 1976 on the Mt Albert site on Carrington road, which has 55 hectares of grounds. The area on which Unitec&#x27;s main campus is located was formerly home to the Whau Lunatic Asylum, later known as Carrington Hospital.

The name changed to Carrington Polytechnic in 1987 and then to &quot;Unitec Institute of Technology&quot; in 1994. Unitec applied for University status in 1999, but the Government ruled, somewhat controversially, in 2005 that Unitec did not meet the academic criteria of a university and would remain an Institute of Technology.

In 2006, Unitec opened its Waitakere Campus in the centre of Henderson, West Auckland. The campus is a joint development with the former Waitakere City Council and includes the new Waitākere Central Library. Unitec&#x27;s Waitakere campus offers introductory computing, community development, and nursing courses.

In August 2011, Unitec opened a campus in Albany, on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore, but it was closed in December 2016. On 1 April 2020, Unitec Institute of Technology became a subsidiary of Te Pūkenga (the New Zealand Institute of Skills and Technology) alongside the 15 other institutes of technology and polytechnics (ITPs).

In July 2018 Unitec made the news after revealing deficits totaling nearly $100 million over four years and prompting the Education Minister Chris Hipkins to consider interventions. It was not alone by September 2018 there were four of the country&#x27;s polytechnics at a high financial risk with 10 making deficits and none were expected to make the surplus that the government required. In 2019 a major restructure across the polytechnic sector was announced.
In 2023, Unitec started charging parking fees.(Unitec,2023)

<text>Clarence Baker (July 7, 1928 – October 15, 2006) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1988, representing the riding of Lac Du Bonnet for the New Democratic Party.

The son of Anton and Pauline Baker, Baker was born in the municipality of Cromwell, Manitoba, and worked as a farmer before entering political life. In 1951, he married Ilene Weidman. He was a delegate to the Manitoba Pool Elevators for thirty years, and was named Manitoba Farmer of the Year in 1984. Baker served as Reeve of Brokenhead from 1976 to 1998, was a councillor for two, and served on the Union of Manitoba Municipalities for five years. He also served on the local hospital board for nine years, including three years as chair.

In the provincial election of 1986, Baker was elected to the Manitoba legislature for Lac Du Bonnet, defeating Darren Praznik of the Progressive Conservative Party by 302 votes. He was not appointed to the cabinet of Howard Pawley, and was defeated by Praznik in the 1988 election.

Baker later returned to municipal politics, and was re-elected as reeve of Brokenhead. He died in 2006.

<text>Little Shelford is a village located to the south of Cambridge, in the county of Cambridgeshire, in eastern England. The River Granta lies between it and the larger village of Great Shelford, and both are served by Shelford railway station, which is on the West Anglia Main Line from Cambridge to London Liverpool Street. The village has one pub, The Navigator, on the High Street.

The parish is mostly low-lying. It is bounded on the west by the M11 motorway and by field boundaries, and on the east by the River Cam or Granta. The highest point of the parish is Clunch Pit Hill, 31 m (TL447499).

==Church and notable families==
The Church of All Saints, Little Shelford is the village&#x27;s Church of England parish church. The church is a Grade II* listed building, and dates from the 12th century.

Three tablets commemorate General Sir Charles Wale, who survived many battles to die at Little Shelford in 1848; his son, who fell at the Siege of Lucknow; and his eight grandsons and great-grandsons who died in World War I. Other notable members of the Wale family associated with Little Shelford include Thomas Wale, Gregory Wale and Henry Charles Wale. A monument to Gregory Wale can be seen on St Margaret&#x27;s Mount to the west of the village.

==Locality==
The de Freville manor house survives. One of many hidden ways leads past the manor and the farm where the river slips through a wood and kingfishers streak over an ancient mill pool.

The children&#x27;s writer Philippa Pearce renamed the village &quot;Little Barley&quot;, with Great Shelford becoming &quot;Great Barley&quot;, the River Cam, which flows through the area, becoming the &quot;River Say&quot;, and Cambridge being renamed &quot;Castleford&quot; and deprived of its university. These names are used in a number of her books, most famously &quot;Minnow on the Say&quot; (1955) and &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot; (1958).

<text>Robin Jackson Maynard (&quot;née&quot; Stone; born April 27, 1962) is an American singer-songwriter. She is best known for her 1992 debut single &quot;Show Me Love&quot;, which peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as its follow-up, &quot;Luv 4 Luv&quot;, which peaked at number 52. A house music recording artist, she has scored three number one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart.

== Biography ==
Robin S. released the original version of the single &quot;Show Me Love&quot; in 1990. The track was produced by Fred McFarlane and went on to become a moderate success. In 1993, the track was remixed by the Swedish DJ and producer StoneBridge and re-released under the artist name &quot;Robin S.&quot; with Big Beat Records in 1993. This release climbed the charts the same year, as did her first album, also titled &quot;Show Me Love&quot;. The remixed version of &quot;Show Me Love&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play, No. 1 on the Hot Dance Singles Sales, No. 7 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles and Tracks and No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also peaked at No. 4 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart. The success earned her a spot on the 1994 &quot;American Music Awards&quot; as a performer. The follow-up singles, &quot;Luv 4 Luv&quot; and &quot;What I Do Best&quot;, saw similar success. As of 2004, the album &quot;Show Me Love&quot; had sold 303,000 copies in the US.

After taking time off to work on her songwriting, she began working with producers Eric &quot;E-Smoove&quot; Miller and Todd Terry on her second album. Released in 1997 on Atlantic Records, &quot;From Now On&quot; reflected broader interests for Robin S., encompassing Gospel and R&amp;B ballads in addition to Hi-NRG dance-floor material. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;, became a hit, spending two weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. It was also a moderate crossover hit on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at No. 35, and a minor pop hit, peaking at No. 91 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The follow-up single &quot;Midnight&quot; reached No. 1 on the Hot Dance Club Play, and got better success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100, peaking at No. 35. Robin S. performed the hit on the &quot;Ricki Lake&quot; show during the week the single hit Top 10 on the U.S. dance charts. She also appeared on the RuPaul show to promote &quot;From Now On&quot;; the album sold about 100,000 copies in the U.S. by the end of its album&#x27;s chart run. &quot;Midnight&quot; was written by British singer Alison Moyet and it appears on the first Yazoo album, &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot;. In 1996 she did a song, &quot;Givin You All That I Got&quot;, that was played in the movie &quot;Space Jam&quot; and was featured on the soundtrack.

Robin S. completed a successful European tour in 2004, where her music has historically found a larger audience. She has become a popular performer at 1990s-themed club/dance-pop concerts. As of early 2007, Robin S. was still recording though none of her new material has been released as she is seeking a new record label. Robin S. continued to perform on cruise liners in Europe and Asia.

In 2008, she recorded a new song with the European artist Honest. In October 2008, the radio mix of her 1993 song &quot;Show Me Love&quot; reached the top of the Dutch Top 40. That made it Robin S.&#x27;s most successful song in the Netherlands. In 2009, she recorded new song with Corey Gibbons, the single &quot;At My Best&quot;.

In 2016, Robin S.&#x27;s collaboration with DJ Escape on the track, &quot;Shout It Loud&quot;, went to number one on the US dance chart.

<text>John Kennedy O&#x27;Hara (born c. 1961) is an American lawyer, active in Brooklyn, New York politics. He is also the first person convicted of illegal voting in New York State since Susan B. Anthony was convicted for voting (before women had the right to vote) in 1872. He was exonerated of the crime on Thursday, January 12, 2017. On February 23, 2017, O&#x27;Hara filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit for $25 million against disgraced ex-Brooklyn D. A. Charles &quot;Joe&quot; Hynes.

The son of working-class Irish Americans and the first in his family to go to college, O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s interest in politics was clear even in childhood: at the age of seven he wrote to his congressman complaining that he didn&#x27;t have the right to vote but was still required to pay sales tax on toys. At the age of 11 he worked on George McGovern&#x27;s campaign in the 1972 presidential election. At 16, his investigative reporting for his school newspaper resulted in the school principal being fired for lacking the appropriate license for his job.

As a teenager and young man, he was involved with Brooklyn&#x27;s Reform Democrats against the Meade Esposito machine.
In the 1990s, he ran for office six times in primary election never winning but coming within a few hundred votes in a 1992 election for New York State Assembly.

In 1996, O&#x27;Hara was charged with running for office and voting from a false address. In fact, O&#x27;Hara had voted from his girlfriend&#x27;s apartment, in which approximately half of his time was spent. The discovery of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s voting habits was used by incumbent Brooklyn District Attorney Charles &quot;Joe&quot; Hynes to prosecute O&#x27;Hara for voting in a place other than his &quot;principle and permanent residence&quot;. Refusing any plea deal, after a mistrial and a reversal on appeal, O&#x27;Hara was convicted of a felony in July 1999, sentenced to five years probation, a $20,000 fine and 1,500 hours of community service cleaning a park. The case also resulted in his disbarment on November 10, 1997.

He continued to appeal his case, and continued campaigning on behalf of other anti-machine candidates, especially for judgeships. O&#x27;Hara-backed Peter Sweeney and Eileen Nadelson won judgeships in 2001 and several other insurgent candidates have won Brooklyn judgeships since then. An attempt was made to prosecute Nadelson for election fraud for false petitions; these turned out to be false petitions by &quot;a person or persons unknown to [her] campaign.&quot; Civil rights lawyer Sandra Roper, backed by O&#x27;Hara in a failed 2001 candidacy against District Attorney Hynes, was prosecuted for what Christopher Ketcham says &quot;most observers agree is an unfounded charge of grand larceny&quot;. Roper&#x27;s trial ended in a mistrial on November 8, 2004. A Brooklyn judge dismissed the charges February 28, 2005.

On October 29, 2008, O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s petition for re-admission to the bar was submitted by the Supreme Court of the State of New York Appellate Division: Second Judicial Department to the Committee on Character And Fitness. The Full Committee on Character And Fitness for the Second, Tenth, Eleventh and Thirteenth districts, voted unanimously on June 29, 2009, to approve the subcommittee&#x27;s recommendation that O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s application for reinstatement be granted. On October 6, 2009, O&#x27;Hara was reinstated as an attorney by the Supreme Court of the State of New York Appellate Division: Second Judicial Department. However, his conviction still stood.

In recommending O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s reinstatement, the subcommittee of the Committee on Character And Fitness wrote, &quot;Mr. O&#x27;Hara, accurately it appears, claims that the machine went gunning for him and pounced on his change of residency calling it election fraud. … Although the committee has grave doubts that Mr. O&#x27;Hara did anything that justified his criminal prosecution, even if Mr. O&#x27;Hara was guilty of the offense of which he was convicted, we believe Mr. O&#x27;Hara now has the requisite character and fitness to be reinstated as a member of the bar.&quot; In December 2009, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; urged a gubernatorial pardon to clear O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s name, saying &quot;It is beyond doubt that O&#x27;Hara was the victim of a criminal justice vendetta ginned up by enemies in the Brooklyn Democratic Party… At heart, the case was an example of selective and overzealous prosecution.&quot;

<text>William Larry Brown (July 9, 1951 – November 24, 2004) was an American novelist, non-fiction, and short story writer. He received numerous awards during his lifetime, including the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters award for fiction, the Lila Wallace-Reader&#x27;s Digest Award, and Mississippi&#x27;s Governor&#x27;s Award For Excellence in the Arts. Brown was also the first two-time winner of the Southern Book Award for Fiction.

His notable works include &quot;Dirty Work&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Father and Son&quot;, and &quot;Big Bad Love&quot;. The last of these was adapted for a 2001 film of the same name, starring Debra Winger and Arliss Howard. In 2013 a film adaptation of &quot;Joe&quot; was released, featuring Nicolas Cage.

Independent filmmaker Gary Hawkins, who wrote the screenplay for &quot;Joe&quot;, has directed an award-winning documentary of Brown&#x27;s life and work in &quot;The Rough South of Larry Brown&quot; (2002).

==Life and writing==
Larry Brown was born on July 9, 1951, and grew up near Oxford, Mississippi. He graduated from high school in Oxford, but did not want to go to college, opting instead for a stint in the Marines. Many years later, he took a creative writing class at the University of Mississippi. Brown worked at a small stove company before joining the city fire department in Oxford.

Always an avid reader, Brown began writing in 1980 in his spare time while he worked as a firefighter (at City Station No.1 on North Lamar Blvd.) His memoir &quot;On Fire&quot; describes sleepless nights at the fire station, but staying up to read and write while the other firefighters slept. Other duties included answering to alarms in and around the city of Oxford, which included the University of Mississippi campus. Brown once responded to a fire at Rowan Oak—the home of William Faulkner, but now a museum. Faulkner died in 1962—on Larry Brown&#x27;s 11th birthday.

By his own account, as he was teaching himself to write fiction, Brown wrote five unpublished novels. His first try at a novel was about a man-eating bear loose in Yellowstone Park. According to Brown it was unpublishable: 

Brown also said that he wrote hundreds of short stories before he began to be published. Later, he would point to his own early failures and false starts, and offer encouragement to young writers and students caught in their own struggles with creative expression.

===Published author and acclaim===
His first publication was a short story that appeared in the June 1982 issue of biker magazine &quot;Easyriders&quot;. His first book was a collection of short stories: &quot;Facing the Music&quot; (1988), followed the next year by his first novel &quot;Dirty Work&quot; (1989). After 1990, Brown turned to writing full-time and increasingly turned to the novel as his primary form. Brown&#x27;s novels include &quot;Joe&quot; (1991), &quot;Father and Son&quot; (1996), &quot;Fay&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Rabbit Factory&quot; (2003). 

All of his books were well-received and, beginning with &quot;Dirty Work&quot; in 1989, he steadily gained a reputation for his novels, most receiving good reviews, acclaim, and steady sales. Nearly all his work was marked by gritty realism, sudden and shocking violence, and diachronic narrative. Brown responded to criticism regarding the &quot;brutality&quot; in his work by saying, &quot;Well that&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s ok if you call it brutal, but just admit by God that it&#x27;s honest.&quot;

In March 2007, Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill published Brown&#x27;s unfinished novel, &quot;A Miracle of Catfish&quot;. Although Brown died before finishing the book, the final page of the published version includes his notes about how he wanted the novel to end. The novel includes a lengthy introduction by Brown&#x27;s editor, Shannon Ravenel, discussing her work on the project and her work with Brown over the years.

Except for the novel &quot;The Rabbit Factory,&quot; all of Brown&#x27;s books were published by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, now a division of Workman Publishing. The paperback editions of Brown&#x27;s books were issued by various publishers, including Warner Books, Algonquin, Holt, and Vintage Books, a division of Random House.

Brown&#x27;s nonfiction includes &quot;On Fire&quot; (1995), a memoir of his 17 years (1973–1990) as a firefighter, and &quot;Billy Ray&#x27;s Farm&quot; (2001), a collection of essays.

For one semester, Brown taught as a writer-in-residence in the creative writing program at the University of Mississippi, temporarily taking over the position held by his friend Barry Hannah. He later served as visiting writer at the University of Montana in Missoula. He taught briefly at other colleges throughout the United States.

He has been compared to other Southern writers, including Cormac McCarthy, William Faulkner, and Harry Crews. In interviews and some of his essays, Brown cited these authors, along with Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Raymond Carver, and Charles Bukowski, as influences.

Brown had also cited contemporary music as an influence, and his tastes were broad. He appeared with the Texas alt-rock band fronted by Alejandro Escovedo, a good friend of his. Brown cited the lyrics of Leonard Cohen as an influence. He had friends in the film industry, including Billy Bob Thornton.

==Personal life and death==
Brown died of an apparent heart attack at his home in the Yocona community, near Oxford, in November 2004.

Brown was survived by his wife Mary Annie Coleman Brown, and three children: Billy Ray (son), Shane (son), and LeAnne (daughter). Brown was also survived by his mother (Leona Barlow Brown) and two grandchildren. His father (Knox Brown) died in 1968.

<text>Gerard Lecuyer (born August 2, 1936, in Saint Boniface, Manitoba) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988, and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley from 1983 to 1988.

The son of Albert Lécuyer and Suzanne Delaloye, he grew up in Ste. Agathe and was educated at St. Boniface College and the University of Manitoba, working as an educator-administrator before entering public life. He directed special projects in the Bureau de l&#x27;Éducation française for the Department of Education, and was a teacher in the St. Boniface school division. He also spent five years in Africa as a teacher with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and was a member of the Franco-Manitoban Society.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the election of 1981, scoring a comfortable victory in the east-Winnipeg riding of Radisson. The NDP won a majority government in this election, and Lecuyer was named Government House Leader soon after the party&#x27;s victory. He was a leading supporter of the legal re-entrenchment of French language services within the province.

Lecuyer was named Minister of Environment and Workplace Safety and Health on November 4, 1983. He won a fairly easy re-election in the 1986 election, and retained his cabinet positions until the NDP government was unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in 1988. He lost his seat to Liberal Allan Patterson by almost 2,000 votes in the 1988 provincial election.

After leaving politics, Lecuyer worked as a consultant in Manitoba and the Yukon. From 1990 to 1994, he was executive director of the Francophone Parents Federation in Manitoba. He was also appointed to the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission.

<text>Long Line is the fourth solo album by Peter Wolf, released in 1996. The album marked a shift in Wolf&#x27;s music from pop rock to a bluesier rock with more personal, introspective lyrics. It had been six years since the release of his previous album, the delay largely due to legal problems with his previous record company MCA. In the interim, Wolf performed gigs in the Boston area with his band Houseparty Five, who then served as the backing band on his tour for this album under the name The Street Ensemble.
Rolling Stone gave Long Line four stars. &quot;The arrangements on Long Line, with their crisp guitar licks and neatly vigorous keyboards, feel a bit slick at times. But tunes like the sparkling, hip-hop-laced &quot;Romeo Is Dead&quot; and the wistful &quot;Two Loves&quot; are bound to prove irresistible.&quot;
