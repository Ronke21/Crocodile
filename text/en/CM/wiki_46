<text>The Battle of Brandy Station, also called the Battle of Fleetwood Hill, was the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the American Civil War, as well as the largest ever to take place on American soil. It was fought on June 9, 1863, around Brandy Station, Virginia, at the beginning of the Gettysburg Campaign by the Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton against Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart&#x27;s Confederate cavalry.

Union commander Pleasonton launched a surprise dawn attack on Stuart&#x27;s cavalry at Brandy Station. After an all-day fight in which fortunes changed repeatedly, the Federals retired without discovering Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s infantry camped near Culpeper. This battle marked the end of the Confederate cavalry&#x27;s dominance in the East. From this point in the war, the Federal cavalry gained strength and confidence.

==Background==
The Confederate Army of Northern Virginia streamed into Culpeper County, Virginia, after its victory at Chancellorsville in May 1863. Under the leadership of Gen. Robert E. Lee, the troops massed around Culpeper preparing to carry the war north into Pennsylvania. The Confederate Army was suffering from hunger and their equipment was poor. Lee was determined to strike north to capture horses, equipment, and food for his men. His army could also threaten Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and encourage the growing peace movement in the North. By June 5, two infantry corps under Lt. Gens. James Longstreet and Richard S. Ewell were camped in and around Culpeper. Six miles northeast of Culpeper, holding the line of the Rappahannock River, Stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers, screening the Confederate Army against surprise by the enemy.

Most of the Southern cavalry was camped near Brandy Station. Stuart, befitting his reputation as a &quot;dashing cavalier&quot; or &quot;beau sabreur&quot;, requested a full field review of his troops by Lee. This grand review on June 5 included nearly 9,000 mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery, charging in simulated battle at Inlet Station, about two miles (3 km) southwest of Brandy Station. (The review field currently remains much as it was in 1863, except that a Virginia police station occupies part of it.)

Lee was not able to attend the review, however, so it was repeated in his presence on June 8, although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations. Despite the lower level of activity, some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all Stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses. Lee ordered Stuart to cross the Rappahannock River the next day and raid Union forward positions, screening the Confederate Army from observation or interference as it moved north. Anticipating this imminent offensive action, Stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around Brandy Station.

==Opposing forces and Pleasonton&#x27;s plan==

Around Brandy Station, Stuart&#x27;s force of about 9,500 men consisted of five cavalry brigades, commanded by Brig. Gens. Wade Hampton, W.H.F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee, Beverly H. Robertson, William E. &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones, and Colonel Thomas T. Munford (commanding Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s brigade while Lee was stricken with a bout of rheumatism), plus the six-battery Stuart Horse Artillery, commanded by Major Robert F. Beckham.

Unknown to the Confederates, 11,000 Union men had massed on the other side of the Rappahannock River. Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, commanding the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac, had organized his combined-armed forces into two &quot;wings,&quot; under Brig. Gens. John Buford and David McMurtrie Gregg, augmented by infantry brigades from the V Corps. Buford&#x27;s wing, accompanied by Pleasonton, consisted of his own 1st Cavalry Division, a reserve brigade led by Major Charles J. Whiting, and an infantry brigade of 3,000 men under Brig. Gen. Adelbert Ames. Gregg&#x27;s wing was the 2nd Cavalry Division, led by Col. Alfred N. Duffié, the 3rd Cavalry Division, led by Gregg, and an infantry brigade under Brig. Gen. David A. Russell.

The commander of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, interpreted the enemy&#x27;s cavalry presence around Culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid of his army&#x27;s supply lines. In reaction to this, he ordered Pleasonton&#x27;s force on a &quot;spoiling raid&quot;, to &quot;disperse and destroy&quot; the Confederates. Pleasonton&#x27;s attack plan called for a two-pronged thrust at the enemy. Buford&#x27;s wing would cross the river at Beverly&#x27;s Ford, two miles (3 km) northeast of Brandy Station; at the same time, Gregg&#x27;s would cross at Kelly&#x27;s Ford, six miles (10 km) downstream to the southeast. Pleasonton anticipated that the Southern cavalry would be caught in a double envelopment, surprised, outnumbered, and beaten. He was, however, unaware of the precise disposition of the enemy and he incorrectly assumed that his force was substantially larger than the Confederates he faced.

==Battle==

About 4:30 a.m. on June 9, Buford&#x27;s column crossed the Rappahannock River in a dense fog, pushing aside the Confederate pickets at Beverly&#x27;s Ford. Pleasonton&#x27;s force had achieved its first major surprise of the day. Jones&#x27;s brigade, awakened by the sound of nearby gunfire, rode to the scene partially dressed and often riding bareback. They struck Buford&#x27;s leading brigade, commanded by Col. Benjamin F. Davis, near a bend in the Beverly&#x27;s Ford Road and temporarily checked its progress, and Davis was killed in the ensuing fighting. Davis&#x27;s brigade had been stopped just short of where Stuart&#x27;s Horse Artillery was camped and was vulnerable to capture. Cannoneers swung one or two guns into position and fired down the road at Buford&#x27;s men, enabling the other pieces to escape and establish the foundation for the subsequent Confederate line.

The artillery unlimbered on two knolls that were on either side of the Beverly&#x27;s Ford Road. Most of Jones&#x27;s command rallied to the left of this Confederate artillery line, while Hampton&#x27;s brigade formed to the right. The 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry (led by Major Robert Morris, Jr.) unsuccessfully charged the guns at St. James Church, suffering the greatest casualties of any regiment in the battle. Several Confederates later described the 6th&#x27;s charge as the most &quot;brilliant and glorious&quot; cavalry charge of the war. (In many Civil War battles, cavalrymen typically dismounted once they reached an engagement and fought essentially as infantry. But in this battle, the surprise and chaos led to a mostly mounted fight.)

Buford tried to turn the Confederate left and dislodge the artillery that was blocking the direct route to Brandy Station. However, Rooney Lee&#x27;s brigade stood in his way, with some troops on Yew Ridge and some dismounted troopers positioned along a stone wall in front. After sustaining heavy losses, the Federals displaced the Confederates from the stone wall. Then, to the amazement of Buford&#x27;s men, the Confederates began pulling back. They were reacting to the arrival of Gregg&#x27;s Union cavalry division of about 2,800 men, which was the second major surprise of the day. Gregg had intended to cross at Kelly&#x27;s Ford at dawn, in concert with Buford&#x27;s crossing at Beverly&#x27;s, but assembling the men from dispersed locations and Duffié&#x27;s division getting lost on the way cost them two hours. They had intended to proceed on roads leading directly into Brandy Station, but discovered the way blocked by Robertson&#x27;s brigade. Gregg found a more circuitous route that was completely unguarded and, following these roads, his lead brigade under Col. Percy Wyndham arrived in Brandy Station about 11 a.m.

Between Gregg and the St. James battle was a prominent ridge called Fleetwood Hill, which had been Stuart&#x27;s headquarters the previous night. Stuart and most of his staff had departed for the front by this time and the only force on Fleetwood when Gregg arrived was a howitzer, left in the rear because of inadequate ammunition. Major Henry B. McClellan, Stuart&#x27;s adjutant, called Lt. John W. Carter and his gun crew (of Captain Robert P. Chew&#x27;s battery) to ascend to the crest of the hill and go into action with the few shells available, as he sent an urgent request to Stuart for reinforcements. Carter&#x27;s few shots delayed the Union advance as they sent out skirmishers and returned cannon fire. When Wyndham&#x27;s men charged up the western slope of Fleetwood and neared the crest, the lead elements of Jones&#x27;s brigade, which had just withdrawn from St. James Church, rode over the crown.

Gregg&#x27;s next brigade, led by Col. Judson Kilpatrick, swung around east of Brandy Station and attacked up the southern end and the eastern slope of Fleetwood Hill, only to discover that their appearance coincided with the arrival of Hampton&#x27;s brigade. A series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across the hill. The Confederates cleared the hill for the final time, capturing three guns and inflicting 30 casualties among the 36 men of the 6th New York Light Artillery, which had attempted to give close-range support to the Federal cavalry. Col. Duffié&#x27;s small 1,200-man division was delayed by two Confederate regiments in the vicinity of Stevensburg and arrived on the field too late to affect the action.

While Jones and Hampton withdrew from their initial positions to fight at Fleetwood Hill, Rooney Lee continued to confront Buford, falling back to the northern end of the hill. Reinforced by Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s brigade, Rooney Lee launched a counterattack against Buford at the same time as Pleasonton had called for a general withdrawal near sunset, and the ten-hour battle was over.

==Aftermath==

Union casualties were 907 (69 killed, 352 wounded, and 486 missing, primarily captured); Confederate losses totaled 523. Some 20,500 men were engaged in this, the largest predominantly cavalry battle to take place during the war. Among the casualties was Robert E. Lee&#x27;s son, Rooney, who was seriously wounded in the thigh. He was sent to Hickory Hill, an estate near Hanover Court House, where he was captured on June 26.

Stuart argued that the battle was a Confederate victory since he held the field at the end of the day and had repelled Pleasonton&#x27;s attack. The Southern press was generally negative about the outcome. The &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot; wrote that &quot;Gen. Stuart has suffered no little in public estimation by the late enterprises of the enemy.&quot; The &quot;Richmond Examiner&quot; described Stuart&#x27;s command as &quot;puffed up cavalry,&quot; that suffered the &quot;consequences of negligence and bad management.&quot;

Subordinate officers criticized Pleasonton for not aggressively defeating Stuart at Brandy Station. Maj. Gen. Hooker had ordered Pleasonton to &quot;disperse and destroy&quot; the Confederate cavalry near Culpeper, but Pleasonton claimed that he had only been ordered to make a &quot;reconnaissance in force toward Culpeper,&quot; thus rationalizing his actions.

For the first time in the Civil War, Union cavalry matched the Confederate horsemen in skill and determination. Stuart falling victim to two surprise attacks, which cavalry was supposed to prevent, foreshadowed other embarrassments ahead for him in the Gettysburg campaign.

==Battlefield preservation==

The Brandy Station Foundation (BSF) was formed to protect the Brandy Station Battlefield from development. According to Clark B. Hall, &quot;a small group of citizens came together over coffee in a little home situated just south of the Rappahannock River in eastern Culpeper County, Virginia&quot;. Over time the organization grew to over 400 members and has been the cornerstone of efforts to save the battlefield from attempts to turn it into an office park, and a racetrack, as well as preserving the historic building known as Graffiti House. In 1990, the National Park Service completed mapping of historic resources at Brandy Station and recommended preservation of 1,262 acres (5.1 km2) at four separate engagement areas.

The American Battlefield Trust, formerly known as The Civil War Trust, has been the major preservation organization involved at Brandy Station. The Trust, supplemented by the BSF and other partners, has acquired and preserved of the battlefield in more than 15 separate acquisitions from 1997 through November 2021. In 2003, this led to the opening of Brandy Station Battlefield Park, which interprets the history of the site. This work has prevented a number of commercial enterprises from infringing on the battleground, including a proposed Formula One racetrack in the late 1990s. In 2013, the Trust achieved a major preservation success by purchasing a 61-acre tract at Fleetwood Hill, site of a number of significant cavalry charges during the battle.
In 2022, Virginia agreed to accept 1700 acres from the Trust and purchase up to 800 additional acres to form the Culpeper Battlefields State Park. The park opened in June 2024. 

Nancy C. James, former rector of Christ Church, Brandy Station (the diocese rebuilding St. James Episcopal Church nearby and renaming it) and nearby Emmanuel Church, Rapidan, wrote a book describing some of the parish and civic unrest during the 1990-era development controversy, which included reburying at least one previously unidentified Civil War soldier whose original coffin had been made from pews of the destroyed church.

<doc id="1209000" wikidata="Q501267" url="?curid=1209000" title="Electric flux">
<text>In electromagnetism, electric flux is the total electric field that crosses a given surface. The electric flux through a closed surface is directly proportional to the total charge contained within that surface.

The electric field E can exert a force on an electric charge at any point in space. The electric field is the gradient of the electric potential.

== Overview ==
An electric charge, such as a single electron in space, has an electric field surrounding it. In pictorial form, this electric field is shown as &quot;lines of flux&quot; being radiated from a dot (the charge). These are called Gauss lines. Note that field lines are a graphic illustration of field strength and direction and have no physical meaning as isolated lines. The density of these lines corresponds to the electric field strength, which could also be called the electric flux density: the number of &quot;lines&quot; per unit area. Electric flux is directly proportional to the total number of electric field lines going through a surface. For simplicity in calculations it is often convenient to consider a surface perpendicular to the flux lines. If the electric field is uniform, the electric flux passing through a surface of vector area is
formula_1
where is the electric field (having the unit ), is its magnitude, is the area of the surface, and is the angle between the electric field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to .

For a non-uniform electric field, the electric flux through a small surface area is given by
formula_2
(the electric field, , multiplied by the component of area perpendicular to the field). The electric flux over a surface is therefore given by the surface integral:
formula_3
where is the electric field and is an infinitesimal area on the surface with an outward facing surface normal defining its direction.

For a closed Gaussian surface, electric flux is given by:

where
* is the electric field,
* is an infinitesimal area on the closed surface,
* is the total electric charge inside the surface,
* is the electric constant (a universal constant, also called the &quot;permittivity of free space&quot;) ()
This relation is known as Gauss&#x27;s law for electric fields in its integral form and it is one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

While the electric flux is not affected by charges that are not within the closed surface, the net electric field, can be affected by charges that lie outside the closed surface. While Gauss&#x27;s law holds for all situations, it is most useful for &quot;by hand&quot; calculations when high degrees of symmetry exist in the electric field. Examples include spherical and cylindrical symmetry.

The SI unit of electric flux is the volt-meter (), or, equivalently, newton-meter squared per coulomb (). Thus, the unit of electric flux expressed in terms of SI base units is . Its dimensional formula is .

<text>The Antarctic Plateau, Polar Plateau or King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]] Plateau is a large area of East Antarctica that extends over a diameter of about , and includes the region of the geographic South Pole and the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station. This huge continental plateau is at an average elevation of about .

==Exploration==
This plateau was first sighted in 1903 during the &quot; Discovery&quot; Expedition to the Antarctic, which was led by Robert Falcon Scott. Ernest Shackleton became the first to cross parts of this plateau in 1909 during his &quot; Nimrod&quot; Expedition, which turned back in bad weather when it had reached a point from the South Pole. Shackleton named this plateau the King Edward VII Plateau in honour of the king of the United Kingdom. In December 1911, while returning from the first journey to the South Pole, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen decided to name this plateau the King Haakon VII Plateau in honour of the newly elected king of Norway.

The Antarctic Plateau was first observed and photographed from the air in 1929 by a Ford Trimotor aeroplane carrying four men on the first flight to the South Pole and back to the seacoast. The chief pilot of this flight was Bernt Balchen, a native of Norway, and the navigator and chief organizer of this expedition was Richard E. Byrd of Virginia, an officer in the U.S. Navy. The other two members of its crew were the co-pilot and the photographer.

==Climate==
The high elevations of the Antarctic Plateau, combined with its high latitudes and its extremely long, sunless winters, mean that the temperatures here are the lowest in the world in most years, falling as low as .

==Fauna==
The nearly continuous frigid winds that blow across the Antarctic Plateau, especially in the austral winter, make the environment inhospitable to life.

Microbial abundance is low (&lt;103 cells/ml of snowmelt). The microbial community is mainly composed of members of the Alphaproteobacteria class (e.g. Kiloniellaceae and Rhodobacteraceae), which is one of the most well-represented bacterial groups in marine habitats; Bacteroidota (e.g. Cryomorphaceae and Flavobacteriaceae); and Cyanobacteria. According to research, polar microorganisms should be considered as not only deposited airborne particles, but also as active components of the snowpack ecology of the Antarctic Plateau.

No penguins live on the Antarctic Plateau, and few birds routinely fly over it, except mostly Antarctic petrels, snow petrels and south polar skuas. There are very few land animals anywhere on the plateau, or the Antarctic in general; nematodes, springtails, mites, midges, humans and dogs.

<text>Frank Edward Stubbs (12 March 1888 – 25 April 1915) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Stubbs was 27 years old, and a sergeant in the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War. He was killed in action on 25 April 1915 while landing on W Beach in Cape Helles, Gallipoli, Turkey.

Stubbs was one of the six members of the regiment elected for the award by the survivors. These were hailed in the press as &#x27;six VC&#x27;s before breakfast&#x27;, and the commander of the Allied troops at Gallipoli, General Ian Hamilton ordered that the beach be renamed &#x27;Lancashire Landing&#x27;.

The other five of the &#x27;6 VCs before breakfast&#x27; were awarded to Cuthbert Bromley, John Elisha Grimshaw, William Kenealy, Alfred Joseph Richards and Richard Raymond Willis.

==Citation==
He is commemorated on the Helles Memorial. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Fusilier Museum in Bury, Lancashire.

<text>Open Heart Symphony is a 1996 album by Spirit of the West, in collaboration with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra.

The band recorded two shows with the orchestra on May 12 and May 13, 1995, at the Orpheum Theatre. The shows included several renditions of the band&#x27;s best known songs, and an entire album&#x27;s worth of songs written specifically for the symphony shows. The new songs were compiled on the album &quot;Open Heart Symphony&quot;; several of the hits performed at the shows appear on the band&#x27;s 1999 compilation &quot;Hit Parade&quot;.

The shows were also taped for broadcast on the Canadian arts channel Bravo!.

==Song notes==
A studio version of &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; appeared on the 1997 soundtrack album to the film &quot;The Hanging Garden&quot;, and a previously unreleased demo version was released on the band&#x27;s 2008 compilation album &quot;Spirituality 1983–2008: The Consummate Compendium&quot;.

&quot;Let the Ass Bray&quot; was reportedly written after Mann and Kelly attended a Radiohead concert at which Thom Yorke angrily refused an audience member&#x27;s request to play &quot;Creep&quot; even though it was Radiohead&#x27;s only notable hit single at the time.

==Cover art==
The photo used on the album cover was taken in the &quot;Confederation Lounge&quot; at the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton, Alberta. The large painting hanging above the band members&#x27; heads is a reproduction by Frederick Challener of the famous &quot;Fathers of Confederation&quot; portrait originally painted by Robert Harris. As the original Harris painting was lost in the Parliament fire of 1916, this reproduction is one of only two versions depicting an historic event in Canadian history.

==Reissue==
The album was reissued in 2008 on Rhino Records, concurrently with the release of the band&#x27;s career retrospective &quot;Spirituality 1983-2008: The Consummate Compendium&quot;.

<doc id="1209013" wikidata="Q612693" url="?curid=1209013" title="Xeroderma pigmentosum">
<text>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a genetic disorder in which there is a decreased ability to repair DNA damage such as that caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. Symptoms may include a severe sunburn after only a few minutes in the sun, freckling in sun-exposed areas, dry skin and changes in skin pigmentation. Nervous system problems, such as hearing loss, poor coordination, loss of intellectual function and seizures, may also occur. Complications include a high risk of skin cancer, with about half having skin cancer by age 10 without preventative efforts, and cataracts. There may be a higher risk of other cancers such as brain cancers.
XP is autosomal recessive, with mutations in at least nine specific genes able to result in the condition. Normally, the damage to DNA which occurs in skin cells from exposure to UV light is repaired by nucleotide excision repair. In people with xeroderma pigmentosum, this damage is not repaired. As more abnormalities form in DNA, cells malfunction and eventually become cancerous or die. Diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.
There is no cure for XP. Treatment involves completely avoiding the sun. This includes protective clothing, sunscreen and dark sunglasses when out in the sun. Retinoid creams may help decrease the risk of skin cancer. Vitamin D supplementation is generally required. If skin cancer occurs, it is treated in the usual way. The life expectancy of those with the condition is about 30 years less than normal.
The disease affects about 1 in 100,000 worldwide. By region, it affects about 1 in 370 in India, 1 in 20,000 in Japan, 1 in 250,000 people in the United States and 1 in 430,000 in Europe. It occurs equally commonly in males and females. Xeroderma pigmentosum was first described in the 1870s by Moritz Kaposi. In 1882, Kaposi coined the term &quot;xeroderma pigmentosum&quot; for the condition, referring to its characteristic dry, pigmented skin. Individuals with the disease have been referred to as &quot;children of the night&quot; or &quot;moon children&quot;.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum may include:
* Severe sunburn when exposed to only small amounts of sunlight. These often occur during a child&#x27;s first exposure to sunlight.
* Development of many freckles at an early age
* Rough-surfaced growths (solar keratoses), and skin cancers
* Eyes that are painfully sensitive to the sun and may easily become irritated, bloodshot and clouded
* Blistering or freckling on minimum sun exposure
* Telangiectasia (spider veins)
* Limited growth of hair on chest and legs
* Scaly skin
* Xeroderma (dry skin)
* Irregular dark spots on the skin
* Corneal ulcerations

== Genetics ==
One of the most frequent defects in xeroderma pigmentosum is an autosomal recessive genetic defect in which nucleotide excision repair (NER) enzymes are mutated, leading to a reduction in or elimination of NER. If left unchecked, damage caused by ultraviolet light can cause mutations in individual cell&#x27;s DNA. The causes of the neurological abnormalities are poorly understood and are not connected with exposure to ultraviolet light. The most current theories suggest that oxidative DNA damage is generated during normal metabolism in the central nervous system, and that some types of this damage must be repaired by NER.

Since DNA repair is under genetic control, it can mutate. Many genetic disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP; MIM 278700) are caused by mutations in genes that repair damaged DNA. XP affects the mechanism that repairs UV damage in skin cell DNA. Those affected with the autosomal recessive disorder XP are extremely sensitive to UV light produced by the sun and develop pigmented spots, tumors, and skin cancer with minimal exposure. Individuals with XP are about 1,000 times more likely to develop skin cancer than individuals without the disorder.

The molecular defects in XP cells result in a greatly elevated induction of mutations in sun-exposed skin of affected individuals. This increased mutation frequency probably accounts for the pigmentation changes and the skin cancers. Examination of mutations in the p53 gene in tumors from XP patients reveal p53 mutations characteristic of UV exposure in the majority of tumors As with all genetic disorders, genetic counseling and psychological support is appropriate for the families to discuss probability of occurrence in future pregnancies, feelings of isolation and concern about career prospects. There is no cure for xeroderma pigmentosum. The most common fate for individuals with XP is early death from cancer. 

===XP repair proteins===

The XPA protein acts during NER as a scaffold for assembly of other DNA repair proteins at sites of DNA damage to ensure appropriate excision of the damage.

The XPB (ERCC3) protein is employed in unwinding the DNA double helix after DNA damage is initially recognized. Mutations in the &quot;XPB(ERCC3)&quot; gene can lead to XP or XP combined with Cockayne syndrome.

The XPC protein forms a complex with RAD23B protein to form the initial damage recognition factor in global genomic nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER). This complex recognizes a wide variety of damages that thermodynamically destabilize DNA duplexes.

The XPD (ERCC2) protein, in combination with the XPB helicase-containing transcription/repair complex TFIIH, is employed in unwinding the DNA duplex after damage is initially recognized. Mutations in the &quot;XPD(ERCC2)&quot; gene cause a variety of syndromes; XP, trichothiodystrophy (TTD), or a combination of XP and Cockayne syndrome (XPCS). Both trichothiodystrophy and Cockayne syndrome display features of premature aging, suggesting an association between deficient DNA repair and premature aging .

XPE is a heterodimeric protein composed of two subunits. The larger subunit DDB1 primarily functions as a core component of CUL4A- and CUL4B-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. Substrates that are ubiquitinnated by these complexes include proteins employed in DNA repair.

The XPF (ERCC4) protein together with the ERCC1 protein forms a complex usually designated ERCC1-XPF. This complex separates the DNA helix for a short distance on either side of the site of damage. It then acts as an endonuclease to incise the damaged DNA strand on the 5&#x27; side of the damaged site. Mutant cells with deficient ERCC1-XPF are not only defective in NER, but also in the repair of double-strand breaks and inter-strand crosslinks.

The XPG protein is an endonuclease that incises DNA during NER at the 3&#x27; side of the damaged nucleotide. Mutations in the &quot;XPG (ERCC5)&quot; gene can lead to XP alone, or in combination with Cockayne syndrome (CS), or in combination with infantile lethal cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome.

There are seven complementation groups, plus one variant form:

There is no cure for the disorder; all treatment is symptomatic or preventive. Symptoms can be avoided or controlled by completely avoiding exposure to sunlight, either by staying indoors or wearing protective clothing and using sunscreen when outdoors. Keratosis can also be treated by using cryotherapy or fluorouracil. In more severe cases of XP, even minuscule amounts of UV light, for example, from covered windows or fluorescent bulbs, can be very dangerous and trigger symptoms.

On September 10, 2020, Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals announced that it was investigating the use of its FDA-approved flagship drug Scenesse as a potential treatment to increase pain-free light exposure for patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.

== Prognosis ==
In the United States, the probability for individuals with the disorder to survive until 40 years of age may be as high as 70% if they have never been exposed to sunlight in their life.

If a person is diagnosed early, does not have severe neurological symptoms, and takes precautionary measures to completely avoid any exposure to UV light and sunlight, they may be able to survive until middle age.

==History==
Xeroderma pigmentosum was first described in 1874 by Hebra and Moritz Kaposi. In 1882, Kaposi coined the term xeroderma pigmentosum for the condition, referring to its characteristic dry, pigmented skin.

The 1968 paper about XP by James Cleaver demonstrated the link between UV-induced DNA damage, faulty DNA repair and cancer.

== Culture and society==
Because people with XP need to strictly avoid sunlight, but can go outside at night, they have been called &quot;children of the dark&quot;, &quot;children of the night&quot;, and &quot;vampire children&quot;. These terms can be considered derogatory.

XP has been a plot element in several fictional works. One of the common themes in films about XP is whether teens with XP will risk sun exposure in pursuit of a romantic partner.

Film series like &quot;Children of Darkness&quot;, a German silent-drama film which was released in two parts in the year of 1921 and 1922 respectively, were among some of the initially popular movies that were made about XP.

Other films, like the 1964 American drama film &quot;Della&quot;, starring Joan Crawford, Paul Burke, Charles Bickford and Diane Baker, directed by Robert Gist, which was originally produced by Four Star Television as a television pilot for a proposed NBC series named &quot;Royal Bay&quot;, was also based on this skin disease.

&quot;The Dark Side of the Sun&quot;, a 1988 American-Yugoslavian drama film, was directed by Božidar Nikolić and stars Brad Pitt for his first ever leading role as a young man in search of a cure for his disorder.

&quot;The Others&quot;, a 2001 American psychological horror film starring Nicole Kidman, features two children, Anne and Nicholas, who must avoid all sunlight because of a rare disease characterized by photosensitivity.

A CBS television movie aired in 1994, &quot;Children of the Dark&quot;, was based on the story of the real-life couple Jim and Kim Harrison, whose two daughters have XP.

Lurlene McDaniel&#x27;s young adult book &quot;How I Do Love Thee&quot; features the story &quot;Night Vision&quot;, in which the protagonist, leukemia survivor Brett, falls in love with a girl named Shayla that has XP.

Christopher Snow, the protagonist of novelist Dean Koontz&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Bay Trilogy&quot;, has XP and therefore must live most of his life during the night. The first two entries of the trilogy, &quot;Fear Nothing&quot; and &quot;Seize the Night&quot;, were both published in 1998. The final entry in the trilogy, tentatively titled &quot;Ride the Storm&quot;, has yet to be published as of August 2020.

The 2011 French drama film &quot;The Moon Child&quot; is based on a 13-year-old child with XP, which prevents him from exposing himself to daylight.

The 2012 documentary &quot;Sun Kissed&quot; explores the XP problem on the Navajo Indian Reservation, and links it to the genetic legacy of the Long Walk of the Navajo, when the Navajo people were forced to move to a new location.

The 2016 Vietnamese romance drama &quot;Khúc hát mặt trời&quot;, based on a 2006 Japanese film, &quot;A Song to the Sun&quot;, tells the story of a girl named Yến Phương with XP and the impact of her sickness on her life and relationships, following the story of Phương&#x27;s accidental exposure to sunlight and subsequent neurological degeneration.

&quot;Midnight Sun (2018 film)&quot; is a 2018 American romantic drama film based on the 2006 Japanese film A Song to the Sun. The film was directed by Scott Speer and written by Eric Kirsten, and stars Bella Thorne, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Rob Riggle.

== Research directions ==
Research into XP has had two main results: better understanding the disease itself, and also better understanding the normal biological mechanisms involved in DNA repair. Research into XP has produced insights that have been translated into treatments and prevention for cancer.

<text>Above &amp; Beyond are an electronic music group consisting of English musicians/DJs Jono Grant, Tony McGuinness and Finnish musician/DJ Paavo Siljamäki. Formed in 2000, they are the owners of London-based electronic dance music labels Anjunabeats, Anjunadeep and Anjunachill, and also host a weekly radio show titled &quot;Group Therapy Radio&quot;.

The trio has been consistently ranked among &quot;DJ Magazine&#x27;s&quot; Top 100 DJs Poll; coming at their highest position of No. 4 in 2008, with their most recent position of No. 53 in 2024.

==History==

===Formation (1999–2000)===
Grant and Siljamäki met at the University of Westminster. Having discovered a common mutual interest for electronic music, they decided to collaborate in writing music together. Following Siljamäki&#x27;s suggestion, they set up the Anjunabeats label in the summer of 1999 with the release of their first single, &quot;Volume One&quot;, under the alias Anjunabeats. Initially, the Anjunabeats record label was founded as a medium to release their own music. Since the label acquired the same name as their production alias, however, they started to release music under different names, most notably as Dirt Devils and Free State.

The original mix of &quot;Volume One&quot;, packaged with their Tease Dub Mix, received immediate attention in various dance clubs and quickly gained support from DJs such as Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold, Judge Jules, and Paul van Dyk, after Grant and Paavo Siljamäki personally handed a dub plate of the song to Paul Oakenfold in 2000 at Home, the now-defunct London nightclub.

Following the success of &quot;Volume One&quot; and a string of singles and remixes under their Free State and Dirt Devils alter egos, the marketing director &amp; manager of Warner Music Group, Tony McGuinness, was alerted to the duo by his brother, Liam McGuinness. Liam had purchased a sample library that Grant had created for Yamaha and got in touch with Jono. Having been commissioned to remix Chakra&#x27;s &quot;Home&quot;, Tony McGuinness recruited Grant and Siljamäki to help him complete the remix. When the group was searching for a name to use for their Chakra remix, the inspiration came from a web page belonging to an American motivational trainer coincidentally named Jono Grant. Grant had the poster stuck to his wall. The slogan used by the motivational trainer was &quot;Above &amp; Beyond&quot;, and they decided to use that as their name. Although the group was relatively unknown at the time, their remix of Chakra&#x27;s &quot;Home&quot; was picked over remixes by Rob Searle and Tilt to be the A-side mix, and, after plays by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1, it reached number one in the UK club charts.

In addition to Above &amp; Beyond&#x27;s production work, the trio also established the vocal trance group OceanLab with Justine Suissa. Other collaborators in the band&#x27;s early stages include Andy Moor and vocalists Carrie Skipper, Ashley Tomberlin, Zoë Johnston, and Richard Bedford.

===Early productions and DJ career debut (2001–2005)===

Interest in Above &amp; Beyond soon emerged from established trance labels and new remixes were requested: the trio remixed Aurora&#x27;s &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, Fragma&#x27;s &quot;Everytime You Need Me&quot;, Perpetuous Dreamer&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Goodbye&quot;, and Adamski&#x27;s &quot;In the City&quot;. These tracks served as the foundation for Above &amp; Beyond&#x27;s reputation as one of the UK&#x27;s leading vocal trance remixers.

In 2001, Above &amp; Beyond produced a club mix for Madonna&#x27;s single &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;, and also remixed select tracks by Delerium, Three Drives, and J-pop artist Ayumi Hamasaki.

In 2002, Above &amp; Beyond made their DJ debut in Tokyo performing for 8,000 clubbers alongside Ferry Corsten and Tiësto. As their fan base increased, the trio began to make regular appearances at some of the world&#x27;s largest music festivals and clubs, including Rockness, Glastonbury and Creamfields in the UK and Amnesia in Ibiza, Spain.

In 2003, Above &amp; Beyond remixed DJ Tomcraft&#x27;s &quot;Loneliness&quot;, Motorcycle&#x27;s &quot;As the Rush Comes&quot;, as well as being asked back by Madonna to remix &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;. Other remixes included Britney Spears&#x27; single &quot;Everytime&quot;, Dido&#x27;s &quot;Sand in My Shoes&quot;, and Delerium&#x27;s &quot;Silence&quot;.

Above &amp; Beyond&#x27;s single &quot;No One On Earth&quot;, featuring the vocals of Zoë Johnston, soon followed. The Gabriel &amp; Dresden Remix of this song was voted Tune of the Year for 2004 in Armin van Buuren&#x27;s trance radio show &quot;A State of Trance&quot;.

In 2004, OceanLab&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Satellite&quot;, was released. Known to be one of their break-through tracks in the early days of producing, it reached No. 19 on the UK chart in May 2004.

===&quot;Tri-State&quot; era (2006–2009)===
In 2006, Above &amp; Beyond released their debut artist album, &quot;Tri-State&quot;. UK-based &quot;DJ Magazine&quot; gave the album a five-star review, saying, &quot;A blend of sleek electronic rhythms, lush filmic textures and old-fashioned song writing. &quot;Tri-State&quot; is the fulfillment of any dance act&#x27;s ultimate album aspiration: a padding-free, skilled, diverse long-player. In a word, &#x27;Brilliant.&#x27;&quot;

Singles from the album include &quot;Air for Life&quot;, with Andy Moor, which won Best Underground Dance Track at the 2006 Miami Winter Music Conference and was named Tune of the Year for 2005, as voted by the listeners of Armin van Buuren&#x27;s radio show &quot;A State of Trance&quot;. &quot;Alone Tonight&quot;, featuring Richard Bedford, was nominated for best progressive house/trance track at the 22nd International Dance Music Awards held at the 2007 Miami WMC, reaching No. 4 in the Finland National Singles chart and No. 5 in the UK Dance Chart. Above &amp; Beyond performed &quot;Alone Tonight&quot; at the Global Gathering 2005 broadcast live on Radio One in the UK. Their single &quot;Can&#x27;t Sleep&quot; was included on &quot;A State of Trance&quot;&#x27;s episode 280, which featured at No. 3 on the best 20 tracks of 2006, according to the fans that voted in its polls. The Above &amp; Beyond Club Mix of their track &quot;Good for Me&quot;, featuring Zoë Johnston, was also voted Tune of the Year in 2006 on Van Buuren&#x27;s &quot;A State of Trance&quot;. In 2008, Above &amp; Beyond won Best Underground Dance Track at the IDMA Awards at the Winter Music Conference with their Above &amp; Beyond Club Mix of their single &quot;Home&quot;.

On 31 December 2007, Above &amp; Beyond unofficially hosted their largest show ever on Barra Beach, Rio de Janeiro, where they reportedly played to an estimated one million people.

In 2009, Above &amp; Beyond performed at the official launch of Virgin Galactic&#x27;s SpaceShipTwo. The event took place in the Mojave Desert and was hosted by Sir Richard Branson and attended by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The performance was secured after Above &amp; Beyond&#x27;s Buzz Aldrin-sampling club track &quot;Buzz&quot; was picked by Virgin to soundtrack the unveiling of the spaceship.

===&quot;Group Therapy&quot; era (2010–2014)===

The first single to be heard from Above &amp; Beyond&#x27;s second artist album, &quot;Group Therapy&quot;, was &quot;Thing Called Love&quot;, featuring vocals from Richard Bedford. It is featured in the &quot;Anjunabeats Volume 8&quot; compilation album released on 19 July 2010. After months of writing, refining, and perfecting, the hugely anticipated album &quot;Group Therapy&quot; was released to widespread critical acclaim on 6 June 2011. Hitting No. 1 in the iTunes Dance Album charts, the album was also hugely well received by the dance music press. &quot;DJ Magazine&quot; put the three members of Above &amp; Beyond on the cover of their May issue, describing them as the &quot;biggest DJ/production collective the UK has ever produced.&quot; &quot;Mixmag&quot; hailed the album as &quot;Artist Album of the Year&quot;. The album contains downtempo moments, such as the classical piano-influenced opening track &quot;Filmic&quot; and the reflective &quot;Only a Few Things&quot;, featuring Zoë Johnston, as well as more uptempo club tracks such as &quot;Sun &amp; Moon&quot;, &quot;Thing Called Love&quot;, and &quot;Prelude&quot;. All songs are written and produced by Above &amp; Beyond, with Richard Bedford and Zoë Johnston providing vocals.

The first official radio single from the album, &quot;Sun &amp; Moon&quot;, featuring vocals from Richard Bedford, became a favorite of BBC Radio 1 personality Vernon Kay and ended up on the station&#x27;s B-List, an achievement that was also followed by their second radio single, &quot;Thing Called Love&quot;, which also featured Richard Bedford. &quot;Thing Called Love&quot; was also featured during an episode of the MTV drama Teen Wolf. In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;Sun &amp; Moon&quot; the number-one saddest dance music song of all-time.

<text>Eddie Benton, Jr. (born February 16, 1975) is an American college women&#x27;s basketball coach, currently serving as an assistant coach for the Robert Morris women&#x27;s basketball team. He is best known for his collegiate playing career at the University of Vermont between 1992 and 1996. In his senior season he was named the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award winner, given annually to the best college senior player in the country who is or shorter. Benton then had a short-lived professional career before becoming a college coach.

==Playing career==
===High school===
Benton, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania native, attended Perry Traditional Academy from 1988 to 1992. He was the team&#x27;s sixth man during his sophomore and junior seasons before becoming the starting point guard as a senior in 1991–92. Benton helped the Perry Commodores to their school&#x27;s first state title during his junior year. In his final year, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; &quot;Fabulous Five&quot; team after also being named an all-City League player.

===College===
Benton continued his basketball career at the University of Vermont; he went on to have the most decorated career in Vermont&#x27;s program&#x27;s history during his tenure. He scored a still-standing school record 2,474 points, including a record 54-point game against Drexel on January 29, 1994. His point total was the second-highest in America East Conference history, and for his career he averaged 23.8 points per game. In three of his four seasons, Benton finished in the top 12 nationally. Benton scored his 1,000th career point during his sophomore season and became only the third NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball player ever to record 1,000 points before his 19th birthday (others include LSU&#x27;s Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Duke&#x27;s Mike Gminski). He was named a First Team All-America East Conference performer in all four seasons, becoming just the third player in conference history to achieve that. In 1995–96 Benton won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award as the best senior player under 6-feet tall (he is 5&#x27;11&quot;). At the time of Benton&#x27;s graduation in 1996, he held 15 different offensive category school records, including career field goals, free throws, three-pointers and scoring average. He also recorded 458 assists, the third-highest total in Vermont history as of his graduation.

===Professional===
Benton went undrafted in the 1996 NBA draft. He spent the 1996–97 season playing in the Continental Basketball Association for the Grand Rapids Hoops. Over the following two seasons he played internationally in leagues in Israel, the Netherlands, and Venezuela.

==Coaching career==
After his short-lived professional career, Benton returned to the United States and got into coaching. His first job came in 1999 for the men&#x27;s team at La Roche College, a Division III school in his native Pittsburgh. Staying local, he then spent three seasons with the men&#x27;s program at Robert Morris University. In 2004, La Roche hired Benton as the head women&#x27;s basketball coach, where he would stay for eight years and compile 108 overall wins. He led La Roche to two consecutive Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC) championships, back-to-back Division III Tournament appearances, and in 2012 was named the AMCC Coach of the Year. Benton spent the 2012–13 season as an assistant for the women&#x27;s team at Saint Francis University before landing at Duquesne University in 2013–14. From 2013 to 2017, Benton served as an assistant coach for the women&#x27;s team at Duquesne. After serving the 2017–18 season as an assistant coach of the women&#x27;s basketball team at the University of Cincinnati, Benton accepted an assistant coaching position with Brown. He stayed with them for three seasons before accepting an assistant coach position at Mississippi State to work under head coach Nikki McCray.

In 2022, Benton became the head girls basketball coach at Oakland Catholic High School in his hometown of Pittsburgh.

On April 8, 2024, he was named an assistant coach for the Robert Morris women&#x27;s basketball team, marking his return to the school, having been an assistant coach for the school&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team from 2001–2004.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel John Elisha Grimshaw VC (20 January 1893 – 20 July 1980) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
John Elisha Grimshaw was descended from one of the lines of Grimshaws at Abram, Lancashire, He was born in 1893 and was employed as a carpenter at Cross &amp; Tetley&#x27;s Collieries in the Wigan coalfield before enlisting in the Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army, in August 1912. He served with his battalion in India before the outbreak of the First World War.

==Military service==
Grimshaw was 22 years old, and a lance-corporal signaller in C Company of the 1st Battalion, when he took part in the landing on W Beach on 25 April 1915 west of Cape Helles, Gallipoli, Turkey, at the opening of the Battle of Gallipoli. His job was to maintain communications between the units which had landed and the headquarters for the landing on HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot;. During the landing, the three companies and the Headquarters of the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, were met by a very heavy and effective fire from the company of Ottoman Empire troops defending the beach. This caused 533 casualties out of the 950 men who attempted to land. The survivors, however, rushed up and cut the wire entanglements notwithstanding the terrific fire from the enemy and after overcoming supreme difficulties, the cliffs were gained and the position maintained.

Grimshaw&#x27;s own account said that Grimshaw was awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the landing.

Grimshaw, along with Cuthbert Bromley, William Kenealy, Alfred Joseph Richards, Frank Edward Stubbs and Richard Raymond Willis, had originally been nominated for a Victoria Cross by Major Bishop, the battalion&#x27;s commanding officer, after consulting &quot;the officers who happened to be with him at the time and who did not include either of the officers awarded the Cross&quot;. The recommendation endorsed by Hunter-Weston and Hamilton but was not proceeded with by the War Office.

In August, Hunter-Weston made a second recommendation for three of the men; under the original 1856 warrant establishing the award up to 4 VCs could be awarded as a result of balloting the units involved; and Keneally, Richards and Willis, were awarded the medal having been selected by the surviving privates, NCOs and officers respectively.

However, Brigadier Owen Wolley-Dod, who was a member of Hunter-Weston&#x27;s general staff and a Lancashire Fusilier himself, and who had landed on the beach shortly after noon continued pressing for more awards to be made. Eventually the other three men, including Grimshaw, were finally awarded the medal. The awards were published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 13 March 1917, with an identical citation to the original three men. Grimshaw had his DCM cancelled and replaced with a Victoria Cross. The courage of the six men awarded the medal as a result of the landing was hailed in the Press as &quot;6 VCs before breakfast&quot;.

Meanwhile, Grimshaw had been evacuated from Gallipoli suffering from frostbite and, in 1916, posted to Hull as a rifle instructor. Whilst at Hull, he married Margaret Stout, with whom he later had two children. He was subsequently sent with his battalion to France where, as a sergeant, he was commissioned in 1917. In 1918 he was posted to the First Battalion of the 75th Carnatic Infantry in India, and promoted to lieutenant, before rejoining the Lancashire Fusiliers in 1920 and retiring in 1921. In 1934 he was appointed the Army&#x27;s Chief Recruiting Officer in the Northumbrian Area and promoted to lieutenant-colonel; he later held the same appointment in East Anglia. He died on 20 July 1980 at Isleworth, London, and was cremated at the South West London Crematorium in Hanwell, Middlesex.

<doc id="1209037" wikidata="Q7582363" url="?curid=1209037" title="Squizzy Taylor">
<text>Joseph Theodore Leslie &quot;Squizzy&quot; Taylor (29 June 1888 – 27 October 1927) was an Australian gangster from Melbourne. He appeared repeatedly and sometimes prominently in Melbourne news media because of suspicions, formal accusations and some convictions related to a 1919 gang war, to his absconding from bail and hiding from the police in 1921–22, and to his involvement in a robbery where a bank manager was murdered in 1923.

Taylor enjoyed a fearsome reputation in 1920s Melbourne. A &quot;spiv&quot;, described as the Australian equivalent of the &#x27;American bootleggers&#x27;, his crimes ranged from pickpocketing, assault and shopbreaking to armed robbery and murder. He also derived income from sly-grog selling, two-up schools, illegal bookmaking, extortion, prostitution and, in his later years, is believed by some to have moved into cocaine dealing.

As of 2024, Squizzy Taylor was depicted in the TV Series Vendetta 19 created by best selling author Roy Maloy which was filmed in Victoria, Australia. It stars Tom Levi as a young Squizzy Taylor in the midst of the 1908 Fitzroy Vendetta.

==Early life==
Born in Brighton, Victoria, on 29 June 1888, Taylor was the second youngest child of Benjamin Isaiah Taylor, coachmaker, and Rosina Taylor (née Jones). The family struggled financially and, after the family coachmaking business was sold by creditors in 1893, they moved to the inner-Melbourne working-class suburb of Richmond.

With the death of his father in 1901, the 13-year old Taylor began working in the stables of a horse trainer and then as a jockey in Melbourne&#x27;s inner-city pony circuit.

Taylor soon started to get into trouble with the police and in May 1905 at the age of 16 was arrested for insulting behaviour. He was discharged without conviction by the local magistrates, but this was the first of many court appearances. His first criminal conviction was recorded in March 1906 at the age of 17 when he was sentenced to 21 days imprisonment for the theft of a &quot;fly front grey Melton cloth overcoat&quot;.

===Personal names===
Although given the names &quot;Joseph Leslie Theodore&quot; by his parents, Taylor preferred to use the name &quot;Leslie&quot;. One opinion claims that as a youth, Taylor became known by the nickname &quot;Squizzy&quot; because of an ulcerated, droopy left eyelid. This opinion isn&#x27;t shared in &quot;Squizzy - The Biography&quot;, which claims that family sources interviewed by the author state that Leslie&#x27;s older brother, Claude Taylor, was the original &quot;Squizzy&quot; Taylor. Linking the word &quot;Squizz&quot;, which held a crude connotation to urinating at the time, to Claude being a short person, and a &quot;little shit&quot;, the name was passed down to Leslie after a brief time of them both being referred to as Big Squizz and Little Squizz, before Claude left Victoria around 1912-14, and the name sticking with brother Leslie.

==Career==

===Pickpocketing and Minor Offences (1907–1912)===
His first prison sentence behind him, Taylor became part of a larrikin &#x27;push&#x27; (or gang) that roamed the streets looking for trouble. His early convictions included theft, assault, inciting to resist arrest, offensive language, throwing missiles and vagrancy.

Under the alias &quot;Michael McGee&quot;, he was convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment for pickpocketing the watch and chain of an unsuspecting punter at the Ballarat races in January 1908. After his release from prison Taylor continued to pickpocket, regularly moving from one place to another to avoid detection by the police. He was convicted of pickpocketing in Kapunda, South Australia, in January 1911 and under the alias &quot;David Donoghue&quot; in Christchurch, New Zealand, in November 1912.

Taylor&#x27;s first wife was Dolly Gray, although it is unclear whether they were ever legally married. Dolly was more than just a girlfriend and wife—she is believed to have played an active role in some of Taylor&#x27;s crimes, such as his schemes to decoy and extort money from married men.

===Robbery and murder of Arthur Trotter (1913)===
Arthur Trotter, a commercial traveller from MacRobertson&#x27;s confectioners, was robbed of £200 and murdered in front of his wife and five-year-old son at his home in Fitzroy, Victoria, in January 1913. Harold &quot;Bush&quot; Thompson, a criminal associate of Taylor&#x27;s, was arrested and tried for the murder but found not guilty. The police believed that Taylor was Thompson&#x27;s accomplice in the armed robbery and murder, although no direct evidence could be obtained against him.

Thompson and Taylor were arrested for loitering at the Flemington racecourse with intent to commit a felony in July 1914. Taylor, alias &quot;Leslie Grout&quot;, was sentenced to nine months&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour. While Taylor was in Melbourne Gaol, his wife Dolly supported herself by operating a brothel at her house in Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne. One night in December 1914 she was admitted to hospital with a bullet wound in her head, received under mysterious circumstances. Although her condition was described as serious, she recovered from her injuries.

===Murder of William Haines (1916)===
In 1916 Taylor and John Williamson were tried and acquitted of the murder of William Patrick Haines, a 21-year-old chauffeur employed by the Globe Motor &amp; Taxi Company. On the evening of 28 February 1916, a man calling himself Lestrange had telephoned the taxi company to order a car for the following day to take him to Eltham, Victoria. Haines, who was dispatched to drive the customer, was found late on 29 February 1916, shot dead on the floor of his car at the junction of Bulleen and Templestowe Roads, Heidelberg. The police believed that Taylor and Williamson had intended to rob a bank manager who was taking bank money from one branch to another. The police found that a grave had recently been dug near Clayton, several miles away, in which they believed the body of the bank manager was to be buried. Haines had apparently refused to co-operate so was murdered and the armed robbery was aborted.

While the murder charge failed, Taylor was sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months on a charge of vagrancy and one month for obstructing the police in the execution of their duty.

Taylor figured in the &quot;Fitzroy Vendetta&quot;, a violent feud between rival criminal pushes that lasted for several months in 1919. One push, from Richmond, was headed by Taylor and the &quot;two-up king&quot; Henry Stokes, while the other one was based in Fitzroy and included Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Whiting, Henry &quot;Long Harry&quot; Slater and Frederick Thorpe.

The feud had its origins in a carefully planned robbery of £1,435 worth of diamond rings from Kilpatrick &amp; Co, a Collins Street jewellers, in June 1918. The robbery, which Taylor is credited by some with orchestrating, was carried out by members of the Richmond and Fitzroy pushes.

When three of their members were arrested and faced trial over the robbery, the Fitzroy push became suspicious that someone from Richmond had tipped off the police and suspicions were raised further when Stokes, a member of the Richmond push, gave evidence for the prosecution in exchange for the police withdrawing charges against him. The two men were found not guilty, but that was not the end of the matter. Outside court after the trial, angry words were exchanged by the opposing factions and both Stokes and Taylor were struck by punches.

To add to the tensions, some members of the Fitzroy push were dissatisfied with the division of the proceeds from the Kilpatricks robbery. The final catalyst for the vendetta came some months after the robbery when Taylor&#x27;s common law wife, Dolly, was drugged at an underworld party in Fitzroy, maltreated and robbed of £200 of jewellery that she was wearing. Some of the other guests considered the jewellery was part of the proceeds from the Kilpatrick&#x27;s robbery and thus rightly belonged to them.

The Richmond push, led by Taylor, retaliated against those responsible for taking Dolly&#x27;s jewellery. One of the first men targeted was Whiting, who was shot six times in the head when gunmen invaded his home in Webb Street, Fitzroy, late one night in February 1919. The newspapers reported that the life of Whiting, a former boxer, was only saved by his &quot;exceptionally thick skull&quot;. More attacks and counter-attacks followed. The victims never sought the help of the police and, when they were so seriously injured that the police could interview them, they maintained an obstinate silence about the identity of the perpetrators.

The violence peaked in May 1919. Within a space of days, a Richmond gang member was shot seven times, a man was brutally beaten by members of the Fitzroy push, and shots were again fired at Whiting and into the house of another Fitzroy gang member. A few days later there was a violent confrontation between Stokes and Slater in Little Collins Street, Melbourne, which ended in Slater&#x27;s admission to hospital with five bullet wounds to his body and Stokes under arrest for attempted murder. Stokes claimed he shot Slater in self-defence and when tried was found not guilty.

Taylor was arrested over a shooting incident in Fitzroy in August 1919. The police had seen him jumping into a moving car immediately after shots were fired into a &quot;sly grog&quot; shop in Fleet Street, Fitzroy, injuring a woman and two men. Taylor was initially convicted of loitering with intent to commit a felony and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, however the conviction was overturned on appeal due to a lack of evidence.

By late 1919 the feud had died down. Whiting was in prison serving a nine-month sentence for occupying a house frequented by reputed thieves, while Slater and Thorpe had left for interstate. In September 1919 before leaving Melbourne, Thorpe was seen throwing a home-made bomb at the house of a police detective involved in the investigation of the vendetta shootings and the Kilpatricks robbery. Thorpe was subsequently arrested in Sydney and, after his return to Melbourne, sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment for the bombing and declared a habitual criminal to be detained at the Governor&#x27;s pleasure.

===Marriages===

The Fitzroy Vendetta also marked the end of Taylor&#x27;s relationship with his common-law wife, Dolly. By September 1919, Taylor had begun some form of relationship with a seventeen year old waitress, Irene Lorna Kelly. The couple were married under the rites of the Anglican Church in Fitzroy on 19 May 1920, and soon afterwards Dolly left Melbourne and moved to Adelaide. Shortly after the marriage Kelly gave birth to a daughter, June Loraine Taylor, who was born in Malvern East on 5 June 1920. The infant June died at around seven months of age in Kensington on 9 January 1921.

The couples&#x27; second daughter, Lesley Taylor, was born in St Kilda on 6 October 1922. The birth of another child did not help the couples&#x27; already strained marriage and Taylor ceased cohabitation with Kelly whilst he was in hiding in late 1922. Kelly returned to her parents&#x27; home with the infant Leslie and petitioned her husband for divorce on 31 July 1923 on the grounds of desertion and adultery, citing Taylor&#x27;s extramarital affair with Ida Muriel &quot;Babe&quot; Pender. When asked about his marriage Taylor was quoted as saying, &quot;She [Lorna] is only a fair weather friend, I am going to stick to Ida&quot;. Lorna was granted a &quot;decree nisi&quot; in February 1924 and the order &quot;nisi&quot; was made absolute in April 1924. Kelly was granted full custody of Leslie and she later sued Taylor for alimony to support their child&#x27;s upkeep.

Taylor married Pender in Fitzroy on 23 May 1924. The couple also had a daughter, Gloria Patricia Taylor, born in Prahan on 23 September 1923.

===In hiding (1921–1922)===
Taylor was believed responsible for a series of burglaries throughout 1920 and into 1921. He was unsuccessfully prosecuted over the theft of £323 from the Thornbury branch of the Commercial Bank in February 1921, but otherwise his activities went on unimpeded by the police. His luck finally ran out in June 1921 when one night he was caught seemingly red-handed in a bonded warehouse in King Street, Melbourne. He was committed to stand trial for breaking and entering the warehouse and released on bail of £600. However, when Taylor&#x27;s trial date arrived, he failed to appear at court and the bail money was forfeited. For more than a year the police searched for Taylor without success.

At the time Taylor absconded from bail, tensions were again rising in Fitzroy. Within days of his disappearance, Taylor&#x27;s authority was openly challenged by Fitzroy gunman, Joseph Lennox Cotter, who riddled the door of Taylor&#x27;s Bourke Street gambling club with bullets and shot the barman in the leg in crowded Bourke Street. Some weeks later Cotter fought one of Taylor&#x27;s men at the Ascot races and the violence continued until, in October 1921, Cotter shot and killed John Thomas &#x27;Fivo&#x27; Olson in Regent Street, Fitzroy. Cotter claimed he acted in self-defence in shooting Olson, whom he said was part of mob who had come to Fitzroy a few days before to shoot him. Cotter was found not guilty of Olson&#x27;s murder.

The police came close to catching Taylor in March 1922, when he and two other men were spotted fleeing from a women&#x27;s clothing shop in Elsternwick carrying bundles of stolen goods. The three men sped away in a car in which a driver and Taylor&#x27;s girlfriend, Pender, had been waiting. A series of police raids located Taylor&#x27;s two accomplices, Pender and the driver, but not Taylor. The police did, however, find some of his personal belongings, including clothes, photographs and a scrapbook of newspaper cuttings. Pender gave the police a witness statement and was rushed away to a safe location, however soon she too disappeared. Taylor&#x27;s two accomplices and the driver were charged with housebreaking but, without Pender&#x27;s evidence, the prosecutions failed.

Posters for the arrest of Taylor and Pender were circulated to all police stations across Victoria. Pender was arrested by police in July 1922 after she was spotted window shopping in Flinders Street, Melbourne.

While in hiding, Taylor wrote letters to the &quot;Herald&quot; newspaper saying he would give himself up when he was ready. The police were sceptical about Taylor&#x27;s promises, however in September 1922 he kept his word and surrendered to the police. He told the incredulous police detectives that he spent most of his time in a flat in East Melbourne and that he had often come out of hiding in disguise, sometimes dressed as a woman but more often as a schoolboy, which was convincing due to his small stature.

Taylor was again committed for trial on the charge of breaking into the warehouse and released on bail. On the evening before the trial, three shots were fired at Taylor as he was stepping out of a car in Bourke Street, Melbourne. Taylor was wounded once in the right leg. Cotter was arrested and charged with shooting at Taylor, although the charge failed due to a lack of evidence. He was sentenced to two months&#x27; prison for possessing an unregistered firearm.

On the day of his trial for warehouse breaking, Taylor limped into court on crutches. In his defence, he told a dramatic story about how an enemy of his called Lou &#x27;the Count&#x27; Sterling (aka Louis Henri Stirling) had challenged him to fight. Taylor explained that later in the same evening he had been drinking heavily and, believing that Sterling and his men were pursuing him, he had hidden in the warehouse which was already unlocked. The jury failed to agree, so a second trial was held. At the re-trial Taylor was found not guilty.

===Glenferrie robbery and murder of Thomas Berriman (1923)===

Thomas Berriman, the manager of the Hawthorn branch of the Commercial Bank, was robbed of £1,851 and fatally wounded outside Glenferrie Station, Hawthorn, in October 1923. While en route to Glenferrie Station with a small suitcase of bank money, Berriman was approached by two men, one of whom offered to carry the suitcase. When Berriman refused to hand over the suitcase, one of the men drew a revolver and shot him in the chest. The men grabbed the suitcase and, pursued by bystanders, escaped on foot to a waiting car. Berriman was admitted to hospital in a serious condition and died two weeks later.

From police photographs, witnesses identified the man who shot Berriman as Richard Buckley and his accomplice as Angus Murray, an escapee from Geelong Gaol. The police raided a house in Barkly Street, St Kilda, a few mornings after the robbery and arrested Murray, Taylor and his girlfriend, Ida Pender.

The police believed that Taylor was the organiser of the robbery. He was initially charged with being the occupier of a house frequented by thieves and harbouring the escaped prisoner Murray.

Murray was charged with escaping from Geelong Gaol and with the robbery and wounding of Berriman. Berriman then died, and therefore the charges against Murray were upgraded to murder. Taylor was charged as an accessory.

The police were unable to locate Buckley despite numerous raids, an appeal for public assistance and the offer of a £500 reward. The inquest into the death of Berriman proceeded in Buckley&#x27;s absence and the coroner returned the verdict of wilful murder, with Buckley and Murray as the principals and Taylor as an accessory.

After almost two months of remands in custody, Taylor was granted bail and soon began to intimidate key witnesses and devising a plan to rescue Murray from prison. The rescue plans involved the attempted bribery of a prison warder and Murray climbing over the prison wall with a rope made from towels. After the plans came to the knowledge of prison authorities, Taylor and four others were charged with conspiring to assist Murray to escape from Melbourne Gaol.

Murray was tried and convicted of the murder of Berriman and sentenced to death, even though it was Buckley who fired the fatal shot. He unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and was refused leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia. The Trades Hall Council led a spirited campaign for a commutation of Murray&#x27;s death sentence. Deputations were sent to the Attorney General and Premier, a petition with 70,000 signatories was sent to the Governor and public meetings were held to protest against Murray&#x27;s pending execution. Efforts to obtain a reprieve failed, and Murray was executed on 14 April 1924 at Melbourne Gaol, with 2,000 protesters demonstrating outside.

The charges that Taylor was an accessory to the murder of Berriman were withdrawn; however, he still faced charges of conspiring to rescue Murray from prison, harboring Murray, and of occupying a house frequented by thieves. Taylor was found not guilty of the conspiracy charge. Three trials were held on the charge of harbouring Murray; at the first and second trials, the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict and at the third trial he was acquitted.

Taylor was convicted of the less serious charge of being the occupier of a house frequented by thieves and sentenced to six months&#x27; prison in June 1924. He was also ordered to show cause why he should not be imprisoned indefinitely under the Indeterminate Sentences Act; however, the Supreme Court declined to order an indeterminate sentence, concluding that Taylor&#x27;s criminal record was not sufficiently serious to warrant one. Taylor was released from Pentridge Prison in December 1924.

The police were relentless in their search for Buckley. Almost seven years after the murder of Berriman, the police traced him to a house in Moonee Ponds, Victoria, where he was arrested in October 1930. Rarely venturing outside the house where he lived with his great granddaughter, the ageing Buckley had grown a beard to change his appearance. Finally brought to trial, Buckley was convicted of Berriman&#x27;s murder and sentenced to death, although this was soon commuted to life imprisonment. In 1946, 83-year-old Buckley was released from prison on compassionate grounds—he was dying and his family did not wish him to die in prison.

Taylor was wounded in a gunfight with a rival gangster, John &quot;Snowy&quot; Cutmore, at a house in Barkly Street, Carlton, and died at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Fitzroy, on 27 October 1927. Cutmore, a standover man associated with the Razor Gang of Sydney, was also fatally wounded. Cutmore was an old foe of Taylor&#x27;s. The animosity dated back to the Fitzroy Vendetta in 1919 when Cutmore was a member of the rival Fitzroy gang. Well known to the police as a violent criminal, Cutmore had a string of convictions in Victoria and NSW for assault, stealing and resisting arrest. In 1927 Cutmore was living in Sydney, then the scene of a &#x27;razor gang war&#x27; between opposing factions of the Sydney underworld. Cutmore joined standover man Norman Bruhn, also originally from Melbourne, in a notorious razor gang who stole the illicit gains of their underworld peers, knowing their crimes would never be reported to the police. Bruhn was murdered in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst in June 1927.

Cutmore returned to Melbourne with his wife in October 1927 and began staying at his mother&#x27;s house in Barkly Street, Carlton. Within a few days of his arrival, Cutmore was confined to bed with a severe bout of influenza. Taylor, hearing of Cutmore&#x27;s return from Sydney, set out to find him. On the evening of 27 October 1927, Taylor and two men hailed a taxi to take them to Carlton. They stopped at several Carlton hotels in search of Cutmore and, finally, Taylor told the driver to take them to Barkly Street, Carlton.

In Barkly Street, Taylor and the two men got out of the taxi and headed for Cutmore&#x27;s house. Taylor and one of his companions let themselves into the house and went to the room where Cutmore was lying ill in bed. Words were exchanged by the men, followed by a series of gunshots in quick succession. Cutmore, still lying in bed, was fatally wounded. His mother, who rushed to the room after hearing the shooting, was also wounded in the shoulder. Taylor was shot in his right side below the ribs. He staggered outside towards the waiting taxi, while one of his companions fled out the back door of the house. Taylor was helped into the taxi and taken to St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital. When stuck in traffic on the way to the hospital, Taylor&#x27;s other companion jumped from the taxi and ran off. Taylor was unconscious by the time he arrived at the casualty ward and died soon afterwards.

Taylor was buried with Anglican rites in Brighton Cemetery in a double plot with his eldest daughter, June Loraine Taylor. On the morning of the funeral, the police were needed to control a large crowd of onlookers who gathered at Taylor&#x27;s house, swarming around the waiting hearse in morbid curiosity. Cutmore was buried in Coburg Cemetery.

Taylor&#x27;s first wife, Lorna Kelly, remarried George Andrew Davis in Kensington on 22 December 1927. Kelly died in Frankston in 1980. 

Taylor’s widow, Ida Pender, remarried George Thomas Lewin in Richmond on 29 September 1928. The Australian press incorrectly reported that Pender had remarried a Mick Powell. Pender and Lewin divorced in 1932. She then re-married Francesco Antonio Labattaglia in 1933. Pender died in Fitzroy on 22 April 1971. Taylor’s daughter by Pender, Patsy, married George Charles Forbes in Richmond in 1962. She died in South Australia in 2003.

===Inquest===

Police enquiries into the death of Taylor and Cutmore led to the arrest of four men. On the day after the shooting Roy Travers, an associate of Cutmore, was detained at Albury on a Sydney-bound train. The following day, the police intercepted three other men, Thomas Kelly, his brother Sidney Kelly and Norman Smith, also on their way back to Sydney. The police suspected that two of these men had accompanied Taylor to Cutmore&#x27;s house on the night of the shooting. The Kelly brothers were well known to police for their role in the recent &#x27;razor gang war&#x27; in Sydney. Thomas Kelly had just been acquitted of shooting Frank &#x27;Razor Jack&#x27; Hayes with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Hayes together with Norman Bruhn and Cutmore, were central figures in a notorious razor gang that preyed on their peers in the Sydney underworld.

The police recovered three handguns believed to be connected with the shooting of Taylor and Cutmore. An automatic pistol was found in Taylor&#x27;s pocket after he arrived at hospital and two other pistols were discovered in the vicinity of Cutmore&#x27;s house, one was hidden in the cistern of a toilet in the backyard and the other was found in a right-of-way some distance away. This suggested that a third person was involved in the shooting.

A coronial inquiry was held into the deaths of Taylor and Cutmore. The coroner returned an open verdict due to a lack of evidence. He concluded that &quot;... Cutmore died from bullet wounds in the heart and lungs. There is not sufficient evidence to say who fired the shots ... Taylor died from a bullet wound in the liver. There is not sufficient evidence to determine who fired the shot.&quot; Even though the coroner had heard forensic evidence suggesting the pistol found in Taylor&#x27;s possession was used to shoot Cutmore and the pistol used by Cutmore had fired the fatal shot at Taylor, there remained a number of unanswered questions. There was no evidence of the motive for the shooting, the identity of the third person involved or explaining the discovery of Cutmore&#x27;s pistol in a right-of-way some distance from the scene of the shooting. The four arrested men were discharged without conviction.

===Theories===

Several theories soon emerged about the deaths of Taylor and Cutmore. An early police theory was that the enmity between the two men resulted from jealousy over a woman. Other police enquiries suggested the shooting was a sequel to the murder of Norman Bruhn by an unidentified assailant in Sydney four months earlier.

The &quot;Melbourne Truth&quot; newspaper printed multiple theories on the Taylor-Cutmore shooting. One was that the shooting was an accident and Taylor, who was more bravado than bite, had only intended to &quot;put the wind up&quot; Cutmore not realising that he was armed. Another theory was that an unknown third person had lured Taylor and Cutmore to the Barkly Street house and murdered one or both of them. Yet another theory was that Taylor murdered Cutmore as payback for the death of Norman Bruhn. It reported that the police believed Cutmore had murdered Bruhn because he had robbed a friend of his.

Over the years, more theories have surfaced including:
* Cutmore&#x27;s mother, Bridget Cutmore, murdered Taylor after he fatally wounded her son.
* Taylor&#x27;s former criminal associate Henry Stokes organised the murder of Taylor, clearing the way for him to take control of the Melbourne underworld.
* Prominent Melbourne businessman and Australian Labor Party power-broker John Wren ordered the death of Taylor because he had supposedly threatened to shoot Wren. Perpetuated by Frank Hardy&#x27;s controversial 1950 novel, &quot;Power Without Glory&quot;, this theory was strongly disputed by some, including veteran journalist Hugh Buggy who maintained that Wren was not involved in Taylor&#x27;s death. Buggy wrote that the fatal confrontation between Taylor and Cutmore was the product of Cutmore celebrating his arrival back in Melbourne by smashing up a St Kilda beerhouse and punching its female proprietor.
* Another theory is that Joseph Lennox Cotter (aka &quot;Brownie&quot; Cotter) followed Squizzy to Cutmore&#x27;s house on that fatal day to finally complete the hit, that he had failed to complete previously. Rumours suggest that he may have been paid by Stokes or by corrupt police for the job.

While there is a wealth of often speculative theories, there has never been a decisive explanation of what happened inside the Barkly Street house on 27 October 1927 or the reason for the shootings. The only consensus is that the official version of events is incomplete and that an unidentified third person was present at the fatal gunfight.

==Documentary==
In 1969, a documentary about Taylor was released. &quot;The Rise and Fall of Squizzy Taylor&quot;, directed by Nigel Buesst, was privately funded and screened at the Carlton Cinema in Melbourne and Union Theatre in Sydney. It was later screened on Channel Nine on television.

==Cultural references==
In Frank Hardy&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;Power Without Glory&quot;, Taylor is portrayed as the character Snoopy Tanner. A fictionalised account of the life of Melbourne businessman and Australian Labour Party power-broker John Wren, &quot;Power Without Glory&quot; depicted Taylor as an associate of Wren and suggested that, together with John Jackson, Taylor was involved in the 1915 Melbourne Trades Hall burglary in which a Constable David McGrath was shot and killed. While some people continue to suspect Taylor&#x27;s involvement in the Trades Hall burglary, there is no known evidence of this or an association between Taylor and Wren.

In 1976 Frank Howson and Barry Ferrier wrote an opera based on Taylor&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Squizzy&quot;, which was broadcast by ABC Radio and 3CR and received much media attention. The title role was performed by Men At Work&#x27;s Colin Hay. A major stage production was in the early stages of being mounted, to be directed by Nigel Triffitt of &quot;Tap Dogs&quot; fame, when a film version by a rival producer was announced, causing the stage production to fall over. The film, titled &quot;Squizzy Taylor&quot; and loosely based on Taylor&#x27;s life, was released in 1982 but flopped with critics and public alike.

Taylor is the subject of &quot;Touch The Black: The Life and Death of Squizzy Taylor&quot;, a fictional account of his life and death by Melbourne poet and writer Chris Grierson.

Taylor&#x27;s life was also the subject of the musical play &quot;Squizzy&quot;, featuring songs by Faye Bendrups and a script by acclaimed Australian playwright Barry Dickins. It premiered at La Mama Theatre on 10 June 2010, and ran for 15 shows. It was later revived in 2010 for a production that was staged at the Trades Hall Ballroom in Melbourne, running from 17 to 27 November.

The 2005 book &quot;Runner&quot; by Robert Newton, follows a fictional teenager who is hired as a runner for Taylor.

==&quot;Underbelly&quot; television series==

Taylor was featured in the Australian series &quot;&quot;, a 13-part series covering the Razor war which occurred in Sydney during the twenties and thirties, which was broadcast in 2011. In the fourth season of the Australian true crime series, Taylor was portrayed by actor Justin Rosniak. The sixth season, &quot;&quot;, was based on his life. The eight-part series aired on the Nine Network (as with the previous series of &quot;Underbelly&quot;), with actor Jared Daperis replacing Rosniak in the title role.

<text>Chananel ben Chushiel or Ḥananel ben Ḥushiel (), an 11th-century Kairouanan rabbi and Talmudist, was in close contact with the last Geonim. He is best known for his commentary on the Talmud. Chananel is often referred to as Rabbeinu Chananel – Hebrew for &quot;our teacher, Chananel&quot; (in Hebrew, רבנו חננאל, or abbreviated, ר&quot;ח).

==Biography==
Rabbeinu Chananel (c. 980–1055) was probably born in Southern Italy, likely Bari, an important rabbinic center in the late geonic period. Around the year 1005, his father Chushiel travelled to North Africa with the intention of making his way to Egypt. While waiting for his son to join him, Chushiel settled instead in Kairouan (modern Tunisia), at the time under the rule of Zirid Emirs on behalf of the Fatimids. R. Chananel studied under his father, who became head of the Kairouan yeshiva, and through correspondence with Hai Gaon. He is closely associated with Nissim Ben Jacob in the capacity of rabbi and Rosh yeshiva of Kairouan. His most famous student is Isaac Alfasi. According to R. Abraham Ibn Daud, R. Chananel was also successful in business and was said to be very wealthy and had nine daughters.

==Works==
R. Chananel wrote the first extant systematic commentary on the Talmud, today included in the Vilna edition Talmud page on certain tractates. The commentary, only parts of which survive, addresses sections of the Talmud relevant to legal practice at the time of writing: the orders Moed, Nashim, and Nezikin. Some fragments have been recovered from the Cairo Genizah and are published in B. M. Levin&#x27;s &quot;Otzar ha-Geonim&quot;, though certain fragments may in fact represent geonic material from which R. Chananel copied, in particular the work of Hai Gaon. R. Chananel&#x27;s commentary presents a paraphrased summary and explanation of the main arguments in the gemara, omitting most of the non-legal sections (Aggada) as well as sections that R. Chananel considered too simple to warrant further explanation. A distinctive feature of the commentary is the presentation of the parallel passages from the Jerusalem Talmud. He is one of the most widely quoted commentaries by all the rishonim including Rashi, Tosafot and the Rif. His opinion is highly regarded in halacha and correct versions of the texts which is used as a basis for Maimonides and many other later halachic authorities. In places where we don&#x27;t have his commentary, his opinion is usually known from other sources due to mass quotation from all the &quot;Rishonim&quot;. An edition of the commentary published by Vagshal covers tractate Berachot and order Moed, which also includes the &quot;Sefer ha-Mafteaḥ&quot; of his colleague Nissim Gaon.

R. Chananel also authored a commentary on the Torah, cited by many later Biblical commentators, chiefly Bahya ben Asher. This commentary is to some extent directed against the Karaites. While no full copy of this work survives, we possess many fragments of it; it has recently been published by the &quot;Mosad Ha-Rav Kook&quot; as a separate work, as well as in the &quot;Torat Hayyim&quot; Torah edition with commentaries.

Other works by Rabbeinu Chananel include responsa; a number of Rishonim attribute to him the anonymous &quot;Sefer ha-Miktzo&#x27;ot,&quot; decisions on ritual law.

<text>Lance Sergeant William Stephen Kenealy VC, (26 December 1886 – 29 June 1915) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Born in Wexford, his father John was a colour sergeant in the Royal Irish Regiment. When his father retired from the army, the family moved to the district of Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire where his father worked as a check-weigher at Bryn Hall Colliery. Kenealy became a coal miner at age 13. Ten years later, he enlisted into the army, signing up for 7 years. He joined the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army as a private in during the First World War.

===Citation===
On 25 April 1915 west of Cape Helles, Gallipoli, Ottoman Turkey, Kenealy was 28 years old when he performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.


Kenealy was one of the six members of the regiment elected by their colleagues in the regiment for the award, and described in the press as &quot;six VC&#x27;s before breakfast&quot;. Lieutenant-General Sir Ian Hamilton, the overall Allied army commander at Gallipoli ordered that the beach be renamed Lancashire Landing because of his conviction that &quot;no finer feat of arms has ever been achieved by the British Soldier – or any other soldier – than the storming of these beaches&quot;.

The other five members of the regiment who received the award as a result of the landing were Cuthbert Bromley, John Elisha Grimshaw, Alfred Joseph Richards, Frank Edward Stubbs and Richard Raymond Willis.

Shortly afterwards he was promoted to corporal and then lance-sergeant. He was seriously wounded in the Battle of Gully Ravine on 28 June 1915 and died the next day. Kenealy is buried at Lancashire Landing Cemetery on the Gallipoli Peninsula.

<text>St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is a former church in Seel Street, Liverpool, Merseyside, England which was transformed into a restaurant and bar called Alma de Cuba - &quot;the soul of Cuba&quot;. On 14th November 2024, the building reopened as St Peter&#x27;s Tavern.

St. Peter&#x27;s was built in 1788 by Rev A.B. MacDonald of the Order of St Benedict (O.S.B.); the area was mostly rural at the time. The church survived as a Catholic building until 1976, after which it served the local Polish community for a short time. For this reason it is affectionately known as &#x27;the Polish Church&#x27;.

Until its closure, St. Peter&#x27;s was the oldest Catholic Church in Liverpool. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.

It was acquired by Signature Living for £3.1m in 2017 to become one of its 60 entities that trade as hospitality, hotel and residential property operators and developers.

However, according to newly-published documents from administrators Kroll, the company faced a winding-up petition from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) due to &quot;unpaid historical and current tax liabilities&quot;. That prompted its secured creditor to demand its outstanding debt of more than £2.7m to be repaid.

The business did not challenge the winding-up petition and the secured creditor appointed Kroll as administrator of Alma De Cuba in May 2022.

In September 2024 it was announced that the building had been acquired by The 1936 Pub Company who intended to renovate and reopen under the name &#x27;St Peter’s Tavern&#x27;.

==History==

Some milestones in St Peter&#x27;s history include:

*7 September 1788 - opening of St Peter&#x27;s.
*11 September 1788 - The &#x27;Liverpool Advertiser&#x27; reports that &quot;On Sunday last, a new Roman Catholic Chapel in Seel St. was opened with high Mass: and a sermon by the Rev. Mr. McDonald.&quot;
*28 September 1788 - first baptisms performed, with the first entry: &quot;Was baptised Mary, daughter of John and Mary Goosse; Sponsors, Paul Hewit and Margaret Yates&quot;.
*1 April 1789 - perpetual lease granted by the City Corporation, &quot;to Father McDonald and successors, of the site of St. Peter&#x27;s Chapel, so long as a place of worship.&quot; A separate lease granted for the house and schools, at an annual ground rent of twelve pence.
*29 July 1814 - Death of Fr Archibald Benedict McDonald, O.S.B.. On the Founder&#x27;s Monument was inscribed: &quot;In the vaults of this chapel are deposited the remains of the Rev. Archibald MacDonald, who departed this life on the 29 July 1814, aged 78 years. The founder of this chapel, and for a period of 26 years its liberal, intelligent and revered pastor, to whose memory the Catholics of Liverpool erect this monument. - R.I.P.&quot;
*1817/1818 - The church is enlarged. The enlargement includes the porch and the gallery, and possibly encompassed part of the Presbytery.
*1817 - The opening of St Peter&#x27;s Schools in Seel Street, the &quot;first Catholic School founded&quot;. In fact the school probably transferred from a smaller school founded opposite the church in 1789.
*1840 - Fr Vincent Glover, O.S.B., died of fever on 6 August, contracted whilst attending the sick. Fr Glover had served the Parish for 22 years.
*1845 - A major extension to the church takes place. Next to St. Peter&#x27;s Church stood the house in which the priests had lived for over 60 years. The main part of the floors were removed and the wall between the church and the house was taken down. The result created the Sanctuary (the Altar area of the current church). The front room of the house then became the Sacristy (apparently currently used by the Alma de Cuba restaurant as a storeroom). The extension was carried out under the auspices of Fr James Francis Appleton, O.S.B., the Parish Priest at the time.
*1847 - In 1846 and 1847 hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants landed in Liverpool to escape the famine, and they swarmed to the poorer quarters of the town. An epidemic of typhus began (&quot;the Great Plague&quot;) and at a Vestry Meeting on 8 June 1847 it was reported that 57,701 cases of typhus had been dealt with (compared with 420 cases in the corresponding period of the previous year). Fr Appleton, O.S.B., died of typhus fever contracted whilst administering to the sick on 26 May 1847. The English Benedictine Congregation History records that &quot;[He] was gradually recovering when contrary to Doctor&#x27;s orders he very injudiciously took some Whisky which acted like poison on his constitution and terminated his life.&quot;
*1854 - The last burial takes place in St. Peter&#x27;s vaults.
*1856 - Fr Davey, O.S.B. and &#x27;400 children&#x27; walk in the &quot;Peace Procession&quot; to celebrate the end of the Crimean War.
*1864 - The Lady Chapel was built in memory of Fr Benedict Bonney, O.S.B..
*1872 - Fr Scarisbrook, O.S.B. was consecrated Bishop of Mauritius at St. Peter&#x27;s.
*1898 - The Lady Altar is erected to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Fr Anderson&#x27;s entering the Order of St. Benedict.
*1920 - Electric light installed for the first time in the Church and Church redecorated. Funds for this refurbishment were raised by sources including an &quot;extraordinarily successful&quot; Grand Bazaar held 14–16 October 1920. The cost of this work entailed &quot;an outlay of several hundred pounds&quot;. This work was undertaken during the period when Fr Basil Primavesi, O.S.B., was Parish Priest.
*1934 - Data from the 1934 Parish Census states that there were 622 families in the parish, with a total of 2,823 Catholic &quot;souls&quot; (i.e. people).
*1938 – On 19 June 1938 St Peter&#x27;s celebrated its 150th anniversary. The Jubilee Mass was celebrated by Archbishop Downey, and hundreds of people attended the event. The streets around St Peter&#x27;s were extensively decorated to mark this big event as is illustrated by the photos taken by Fr D’Andria and which are now held in the Liverpool Records Office. The photos show that there were very extensive decorations in Pitt Street, the Lydia Ann Flats, and other streets including Seel Street, Sparling Street and Slater Street.
*1940-1941 - Fr Louis Joseph D&#x27;Andria, O.S.B., writes a series of letters to Fr Kevin Byrne, O.S.B., Abbot of Ampleforth Abbey about life in Liverpool during the Blitz. These letters are subsequently published in the year 2000 by the North West Catholic History Society in a book. Fr D&#x27;Andria left St Peter&#x27;s after the heavy bombing of May 1941. Fr D&#x27;Andria was active in collecting historical and contemporary material from the St Peter&#x27;s and the surrounding districts from his arrival in the Parish in 1930. These materials were deposited at the Liverpool Records Office upon his death. D&#x27;Andria was a keen photographer, and at some stage the photos taken by D&#x27;Andria of the church and the surrounding districts were separated from the main D&#x27;Andria Collection and integrated into the Record Office&#x27;s general collection of photographs of Liverpool. Some more detail is given in the section on The Blitz below.
*1962 - Fr Martin Rocheford, O.S.B., deposits the pre-1837 Parish Registers at the Liverpool Records Office.
*1976 - transferred to the Polish Community and for a short time was known as Our Lady of Czestochowa.
*1978 - The Parish is closed and falls into a period of disuse.
*1978 - The Parish records are deposited in the Liverpool Records office by Fr Everest. The Parish Registers were transferred to St. Vincent de Paul&#x27;s RC Church.
*1993 - The Church is deconsecrated.
*20 November 2003 - A press release is issued stating that funding has been approved to convert the Grade-II listed building of St Peter&#x27;s Church into high-specification offices by Urban Splash. Funding is received from the EU (£260k), the North West Development Agency (£190k) and Urban Splash itself (£450k).
*7 January 2004 - The BBC report that developers have discovered the body of Fr Bede Brewer, O.S.B. in the crypt of St Peter&#x27;s. Dom Bede Brewer was one of the founding members of Ampleforth College in 1802, and President of English Benedictines. The Liverpool Echo also indicate that Ampleforth Abbey was keen to reclaim all of the monastic bodies in St Peter&#x27;s crypt.
*2004 - Fr Brewer was reburied at Ampleforth Abbey in July 2004 along with the remains of 6 other monks. In total there were 22 bodies in the crypt of St Peter&#x27;s (8 monks and 14 lay people). In addition to Dom Bede Brewer, the monks reburied at Ampleforth Abbey according to the Yorkshire Post were monks James Calderbank, Denis Allerton, Benedict Glover, Francis Fairclough, Gregory Robinson and Joseph Glover. However, St Peter&#x27;s founder, Fr McDonald, was the first buried in St Peter&#x27;s crypt and his coffin was not clearly labelled (unlike the seven other monks). Due to this fact and other pressures (such as time) it was not possible to positively identify Fr McDonald&#x27;s remains, and so he was reburied along with the remains of 14 lay people in Ford Cemetery in Litherland, Merseyside.
*2005 - a bar and restaurant, Alma de Cuba, opens in St Peter&#x27;s Church.
*2024 - The former Alma de Cuba reopens as &quot;St Peter&#x27;s Tavern&quot; by The 1936 Pub Company, owned by Rob Gutmann who had founded Alma de Cuba.

==The Blitz==
St Peter&#x27;s was damaged a number of times during the Blitz of 1940–1941. One example of the damage can be found in Fr Louis D’Andria&#x27;s letter of 22 December 1940 to the Abbot of Ampleforth Abbey (Fr Kevin H Byrne, O.S.B.). Referring to the previous night D’Andria wrote: ‘To the Guild Room – doors blown in, big balk of timber across the entrance, stairs covered with sticky chemicals and heaps of rubbish…. To sacristy where sacristans were carrying on as usual despite a hole in the sacristy roof, and other damage. In the church Frs. Bruno and Chad were in the gallery examining a hole in the roof on the street side of the organ. Two more holes in the Lady Chapel, and a big stone in the sanctuary which had come through the skylight’.

In D’Andria&#x27;s letter of 6 May 1941 he recounts events of Sunday 4 May 1941: ‘So it seemed the fire would spread to the church and the house. Bruno said we must clear out so we took the registers etc. into the road….I saw our roof definitely on fire.’

In his letter of 9 May 1941 D’Andria tells Fr Abbot (i.e. Fr Byrne, O.S.B.): ‘Church has notice ‘closed till further notice. Mass on Sunday at [Notre Dame Convent] Mount Pleasant.’ Suggest carrying on at St Peter&#x27;s but Bruno said it was impossible.’ The Church Notice Book recorded that ‘The church was too wrecked a condition for Mass after the first raids of the first week of May.’ D&#x27;Andria went on to quote his Rector, Fr Francis Bruno Dawson, O.S.B. who announced &#x27;No Church, no congregation, no house, no school, no good staying here.&#x27;

Masses were eventually restored, with one weekday Mass from 25 May 1941 at 08:00, rising to two Masses the following week, and by 12 June (The Feast of Corpus Christi), three Masses were said.

Damage to the priests’ house (St Peter&#x27;s Priory, 55 Seel Street) included complete destruction of the 3rd floor of the building and partial damage to the 2nd floor, and the repairs which were finally undertaken reinstated the 2nd floor, and not the 3rd floor. In total 7 bedrooms were destroyed, and only 3 remained, ‘two with rain pouring in, in bad weather’. On 11 September 1944 The [Liverpool] City Architect and Director of Housing reported that the 2nd floor was covered with a temporary lean-to corrugated iron roof which was &quot;leaking badly&quot;, and that &quot;the domestic servants’ sleeping accommodation is deplorable (one sleeps in the Kitchen and one in the Basement Air Raid Shelter).&quot;&lt;ref name =&quot;720KIR/2900&quot;&gt;Liverpool Records Office document 720KIR/2900&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographs which were taken in May 1941 by Dom Louis D’Andria, OSB, show significant damage to the Presbytery and show the Sanctuary (Altar area) covered in debris following an air raid.

St Peter&#x27;s Church Guildhall was located on Park Lane, and was completely destroyed during a bombing raid in 1941.

Documents held by the Liverpool Records Office show the problems that the priests had in getting repairs to St Peter’s Church, school and the Presbytery completed following the war damage. There are correspondence with various builders and the War Damage Commission. These include correspondence showing differences of opinion between the Parish Priest, Fr Dawson, OSB, and some of those undertaking work which led (on one occasion in January 1945) to Fr Dawson throwing some men off site. Whether Fr Dawson was justified in his actions is not clear, but in a letter written to Fr Dawson on 28 January 1945 Fr Dawson is told that &quot;My plaster left on Saturday, and refuses to return to the job. He wants his cards if I send him back.&quot; In the case of the school roof repairs, leaks were evident in the school roof apparently due to faulty repairs. A letter written to Fr Dawson on 4 February 1945 states that &quot;the fault is due not so much to faulty slates as to the fact that the roof timbers were not set and aligned previous to slating…the roll and drip gutter between the schools and church building should definitely have been renewed….the ridge lead still shows shrapnel holes.…to put the roof right by stripping, resetting and reslating would ….be a bigger job than the original one.&quot;

During the 8 nights of the 1941 Liverpool Blitz beginning on 1 May 1941, almost 1,750 people in Liverpool were killed, ~90,000 houses were destroyed, and ~ 75,000 people made homeless. Many areas close to St Peter&#x27;s were destroyed, specifically the area around Paradise Street.

==Background==

The following is an extract from the Press Account on the Centenary of St Peter&#x27;s in 1888, and explains some of the history of Catholic churches in Liverpool leading up to the founding of St Peter&#x27;s:

&quot;In 1701, Father Gillibrand, S. J., Chaplain of the Squire of Crosby, established the first religious services held in the city for Catholics for upwards of a century. In 1707, he came to reside permanently in Liverpool. In 1736, Father Hardisty, S. J., built the first Catholic Chapel, in Edmund Street. It was demolished by a mob in 1746. While a new chapel was being built, under the guise of a warehouse, by a wealthy merchant, named Pippard, the Catholics met stealthily for worship in the house of a Mr. and Mrs. Green in Dale Street, and the only friends of the proscribed ones were two large-hearted and tolerant Presbyterians who lived in adjoining houses, and who helped the Papists to gain, without observation, access to their temporary place of meeting. The Mission was and is still called St. Mary&#x27;s.

In 1783, it passed out of the hands of the Jesuits into those of another learned Order, that of St. Benedict. In 1758, the chapel in Edmund Street had been destroyed during a riot, and a new building took its place in Lumber Street, of which no trace remains, its place now being held in Highfield Street by the fine Church planned by Augustus Welby Pugin, when that great designer&#x27;s influence was beginning to be felt in the revival of Gothic architecture. Father Archibald MacDonald, O.S.B., was the first Benedictine attached to St. Mary&#x27;s, in 1783, and it was he, who in 1788, founded St. Peter&#x27;s. One hundred years ago, the site of St. Peter&#x27;s, now pressed by closely clustered dwellings, factories and warehouses, had a rural environment. The choice of the spot on which to build the new church incurred for the zealous monk the mild displeasure of his superiors, who suggested it was too far out of town. Still, there St. Peter&#x27;s was built, and there it still stands to-day.

Prominent on the venerable church are white marble memorials of departed Priests, who have ministered there.

On the Founder&#x27;s monument we read: &quot; In the vaults of this chapel are deposited the remains of the Rev. Archibald MacDonald, who departed this life on the 29 July 1814, aged 78 years. The founder of this chapel, and for a period of 26 years its liberal, intelligent and revered pastor, to whose memory the Catholicks of Liverpool erect this monument.—R.I.P.&quot;

The other monuments are those of Father William Tarleton, O.S.B., who died in 1816 of typhus fever, caught while consoling the sick; Dr. James Appleton, O.S.B., D.D., who died a martyr of charity, in 1847; Father John Robinson, O.S.B, who died, deeply mourned by his flock, in 1837, and Father Vincent Glover, O.S.B, who died in 1840, aged 49.

==Anecdote==

There is a story retold concerning Fr Basil Primavesi who was Parish Priest at St Peter&#x27;s from 1929 until his death in 1937. One night during his tenure:

&quot;The church was even threatened with destruction by a great fire which seemed likely to cross Back Seel Street. Fr Basil, roused from sleep, went down, placed a medal of St. Benedict on the church wall and returned to bed. A change of wind followed and materially aided the task of the fire-engines which had arrived.&quot;

==Historical note==

Church Street in Liverpool takes its name from the former St Peter&#x27;s Church (now demolished) which was &quot;the first church built in Lancashire after the Reformation&quot;. Students of history should not confuse this church with St Peter&#x27;s R.C. Church in Seel Street.

==21st Century==

St. Peter&#x27;s Church became a restaurant and bar named &quot;Alma de Cuba&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Soul of Cuba&quot;) in September 2005.

In 2024, it reopened as St Peter&#x27;s Tavern.
==Art and artefacts within St Peter&#x27;s Church and the Alma de Cuba==
When St Peter&#x27;s Church was converted into the Alma de Cuba, much of the interior was left as it was because of it being a Grade II Listed Building. Under the rules, if the removal of artefacts threatened damage to the integrity of the building it was forbidden. Thus much of the interior of St Peter&#x27;s Church remains, as do the memorial tablets and (most significantly) the murals which were painted alongside the large picture of St Peter behind the altar.

Behind the altar in St Peter&#x27;s there used to be a large picture of St Peter. This was removed from the church and is now stored at the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King. The area where the picture was located has been replaced by a large mirror in the Alma de Cuba.

The statue of St Peter which was in the church, seated (in marble and bronze) is now displayed in the Crypt Chapel at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King. This statue is a small copy of the much larger original in St Peter&#x27;s in Rome.

The free standing statue of St Benedict (which was in the church) is now located with the Benedictines at St Begh&#x27;s Priory in Whitehaven, Cumbria, whilst the large pieta is now installed at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Chorley.

A photographic record of the interior of St Peter&#x27;s during its conversion was made by Joe McLoughlin on 8 January 2004.

As mentioned above, St Peter&#x27;s was dominated by a large picture of St Peter. Photographic evidence shows that the words on the pediment above the picture have changed at least three times in the last century. In 1920 the booklet produced for the Grand Bazaar shows a photograph of the church with the wording on the pediment as &quot;I am the Good Shepherd&quot;. A newspaper cutting from the Catholic Times from 4 March 1932 shows a sketch of the Sanctuary with the words &quot;CHRIST THE KING&quot; appearing on the pediment, and these words were certainly still in place for the 150th Anniversary in 1938 (as is evidenced by the photos taken by Fr D’Andria at the time). These specific words remain until at least the 1960s, and possibly beyond. Exactly when the wording changed to &quot;TU ES PETRUS&quot; (You are Peter) is not clear. The words &quot;TU ES PETRUS&quot; still appear on the pediment in the Alma de Cuba today. It is not clear if the words have changed more than the three times referenced, and evidence for further changes is being sought.

==The puzzles of the Church Extensions==

There appears to be no clear account of when the main extension to the church (listed as 1845 above) actually took place. This is remarkable as it is such a notable change in the Parish history. The situation is neatly summed in &quot;A Century and a Half - Notes on St. Peter&#x27;s (Seel Street) 1788-1938&quot; by an author who clearly has access to the Parish Records:

&quot;Even the year (of the extension) has been variously stated. Allanson says 1845.&quot; (Fr Allanson wrote volumes on the English Benedictine History, and these were made available to the author by the then Abbot of Ampleforth). &quot;The Centenary Commemoration says 1843. A note made about 1850 in a private account book mentions 1845. The Seel Street Guide (1868) gives 1846. However, the Church Notices book seemed decisive. On the last Sunday of Pentecost, 1845, the following was read: &#x27;After to-day there will be no Mass either on Sundays or week-days in this chapel until the Sunday before Christmas when it will be again reopened for Divine Service...The Vestry will be opened every Sunday afternoon at 3 o&#x27;clock as usual for baptisms.&#x27; The next notices are dated 4th Sunday of Advent, 1845. So between November 23 and December 21 is the time of the building of the new sanctuary.&quot;

The &quot;Official Handbook&quot; of the Grand Bazaar (1920) makes no note of an extension around 1845, though this could just be an omission.

The &quot;Official Handbook&quot; of the Grand Bazaar also mentions an apparently earlier extension: 
&quot;1817 - Opening of New extension of St Peter&#x27;s, previously a part of Presbytery. Sermon preached by Father Baines, O.S.B., of Bath, regarded as principal pulpit orator of his day (Burke, p. 35).&quot; In &quot;A Century and a half...&quot; the author states that Fr Robinson, O.S.B.&#x27;s, tenure (which began in 1816) saw many changes to the parish. &quot;In his second year&quot; therefore 1818 &quot; the church was &#x27;enlarged&#x27; according to several brief notices, but judging by the picture of 1810, this can only mean the addition of the porch and of the gallery. However, the alteration was important enough to cause a solemn reopening on November 27, 1812...&quot;. The date here of 1812 makes no sense, so is likely to be a typo for 1818. The author of &quot;A Century and a half...&quot; is unaware of any part of the Presbytery being used for the 1818 extension, though the authors of the Bazaar Handbook may have simply have made an error. It is also worth noting that the author of &quot;A Century and a half...&quot; again quotes Allanson&#x27;s volumes regarding the extension around 1818 which state that &quot;gallery enlarged and organ built over the altar.&quot;

It would appear then that there are at least two extensions to the church, one ~ 1818, and a later more significant one ~ 1845. However, the lack of clarity in the documents available and those referenced by the authors is a puzzle.

<text>In cellular biology, the Wnt signaling pathways are a group of signal transduction pathways which begin with proteins that pass signals into a cell through cell surface receptors. The name Wnt, pronounced &quot;wint&quot;, is a portmanteau created from the names Wingless and Int-1. Wnt signaling pathways use either nearby cell-cell communication (paracrine) or same-cell communication (autocrine). They are highly evolutionarily conserved in animals, which means they are similar across animal species from fruit flies to humans.

Three Wnt signaling pathways have been characterized: the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway, and the noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway. All three pathways are activated by the binding of a Wnt-protein ligand to a Frizzled family receptor, which passes the biological signal to the Dishevelled protein inside the cell. The canonical Wnt pathway leads to regulation of gene transcription, and is thought to be negatively regulated in part by the SPATS1 gene. The noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway regulates the cytoskeleton that is responsible for the shape of the cell. The noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway regulates calcium inside the cell.

Wnt signaling was first identified for its role in carcinogenesis, then for its function in embryonic development. The embryonic processes it controls include body axis patterning, cell fate specification, cell proliferation and cell migration. These processes are necessary for proper formation of important tissues including bone, heart and muscle. Its role in embryonic development was discovered when genetic mutations in Wnt pathway proteins produced abnormal fruit fly embryos. Later research found that the genes responsible for these abnormalities also influenced breast cancer development in mice. Wnt signaling also controls tissue regeneration in adult bone marrow, skin and intestine.

This pathway&#x27;s clinical importance was demonstrated by mutations that lead to various diseases, including breast and prostate cancer, glioblastoma, type II diabetes and others. In recent years, researchers reported first successful use of Wnt pathway inhibitors in mouse models of disease.

==History and etymology==
The discovery of Wnt signaling was influenced by research on oncogenic (cancer-causing) retroviruses. In 1982, Roel Nusse and Harold Varmus infected mice with mouse mammary tumor virus in order to mutate mouse genes to see which mutated genes could cause breast tumors. They identified a new mouse proto-oncogene that they named int1 (integration 1).

Int1 is highly conserved across multiple species, including humans and &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Its presence in &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; led researchers to discover in 1987 that the int1 gene in &quot;Drosophila&quot; was actually the already known and characterized &quot;Drosophila&quot; gene known as Wingless (Wg). Since previous research by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus (which won them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1995) had already established the function of Wg as a segment polarity gene involved in the formation of the body axis during embryonic development, researchers determined that the mammalian int1 discovered in mice is also involved in embryonic development.

Continued research led to the discovery of further int1-related genes; however, because those genes were not identified in the same manner as int1, the int gene nomenclature was inadequate. Thus, the int/Wingless family became the Wnt family and int1 became Wnt1. The name Wnt is a portmanteau of int and Wg and stands for &quot;Wingless-related integration site&quot;.

==Proteins==
Wnt comprises a diverse family of secreted lipid-modified signaling glycoproteins that are 350–400 amino acids in length. The lipid modification of all Wnts is palmitoleoylation of a single totally conserved cysteine residue. Palmitoleoylation is necessary because it is required for Wnt to bind to its carrier protein Wntless (WLS) so it can be transported to the plasma membrane for secretion and it allows the Wnt protein to bind its receptor Frizzled Wnt proteins also undergo glycosylation, which attaches a carbohydrate in order to ensure proper secretion. In Wnt signaling, these proteins act as ligands to activate the different Wnt pathways via paracrine and autocrine routes.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/0092-8674(92)90630-U&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These proteins are highly conserved across species. They can be found in mice, humans, &quot;Xenopus&quot;, zebrafish, &quot;Drosophila&quot; and many others.
==Mechanism==

===Foundation===
Wnt signaling begins when a Wnt protein binds to the N-terminal extra-cellular cysteine-rich domain of a Frizzled (Fz) family receptor. These receptors span the plasma membrane seven times and constitute a distinct family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, to facilitate Wnt signaling, co-receptors may be required alongside the interaction between the Wnt protein and Fz receptor. Examples include lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-5/6, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), and ROR2. Upon activation of the receptor, a signal is sent to the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (Dsh), which is located in the cytoplasm. This signal is transmitted via a direct interaction between Fz and Dsh. Dsh proteins are present in all organisms and they all share the following highly conserved protein domains: an amino-terminal DIX domain, a central PDZ domain, and a carboxy-terminal DEP domain. These different domains are important because after Dsh, the Wnt signal can branch off into multiple pathways and each pathway interacts with a different combination of the three domains.

===Canonical and noncanonical pathways===
The three best characterized Wnt signaling pathways are the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway, and the noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway. As their names suggest, these pathways belong to one of two categories: canonical or noncanonical. The difference between the categories is that a canonical pathway involves the protein beta-catenin (β-catenin) while a noncanonical pathway operates independently of it.
====Canonical pathway====

The canonical Wnt pathway (or Wnt/β-catenin pathway) is the Wnt pathway that causes an accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its eventual translocation into the nucleus to act as a transcriptional coactivator of transcription factors that belong to the TCF/LEF family. Without Wnt, β-catenin would not accumulate in the cytoplasm since a destruction complex would normally degrade it. This destruction complex includes the following proteins: Axin, adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and casein kinase 1α (CK1α). It degrades β-catenin by targeting it for ubiquitination, which subsequently sends it to the proteasome to be digested. However, as soon as Wnt binds Fz and LRP5/6, the destruction complex function becomes disrupted. This is due to Wnt causing the translocation of the negative Wnt regulator, Axin, and the destruction complex to the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation by other proteins in the destruction complex subsequently binds Axin to the cytoplasmic tail of LRP5/6. Axin becomes de-phosphorylated and its stability and levels decrease. Dsh then becomes activated via phosphorylation and its DIX and PDZ domains inhibit the GSK3 activity of the destruction complex. This allows β-catenin to accumulate and localize to the nucleus and subsequently induce a cellular response via gene transduction alongside the TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor) transcription factors. β-catenin recruits other transcriptional coactivators, such as BCL9, Pygopus and Parafibromin/Hyrax. The complexity of the transcriptional complex assembled by β-catenin is beginning to emerge thanks to new high-throughput proteomics studies. However, a unified theory of how β‐catenin drives target gene expression is still missing, and tissue-specific players might assist β‐catenin to define its target genes. The extensivity of the β-catenin interacting proteins complicates our understanding: β-catenin may be directly phosphorylated at Ser552 by Akt, which causes its disassociation from cell-cell contacts and accumulation in cytosol, thereafter 14-3-3ζ interacts with β-catenin (pSer552) and enhances its nuclear translocation. BCL9 and Pygopus have been reported, in fact, to possess several β-catenin-independent functions (therefore, likely, Wnt signaling-independent).
====Noncanonical pathways====
The noncanonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway does not involve β-catenin. It does not use LRP-5/6 as its co-receptor and is thought to use NRH1, Ryk, PTK7 or ROR2. The PCP pathway is activated via the binding of Wnt to Fz and its co-receptor. The receptor then recruits Dsh, which uses its PDZ and DIX domains to form a complex with Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (DAAM1). Daam1 then activates the small G-protein Rho through a guanine exchange factor. Rho activates Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), which is one of the major regulators of the cytoskeleton. Dsh also forms a complex with rac1 and mediates profilin binding to actin. Rac1 activates JNK and can also lead to actin polymerization. Profilin binding to actin can result in restructuring of the cytoskeleton and gastrulation.
The noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway also does not involve β-catenin. Its role is to help regulate calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in order to control intracellular calcium levels. Like other Wnt pathways, upon ligand binding, the activated Fz receptor directly interacts with Dsh and activates specific Dsh-protein domains. The domains involved in Wnt/calcium signaling are the PDZ and DEP domains. However, unlike other Wnt pathways, the Fz receptor directly interfaces with a trimeric G-protein. This co-stimulation of Dsh and the G-protein can lead to the activation of either PLC or cGMP-specific PDE. If PLC is activated, the plasma membrane component PIP2 is cleaved into DAG and IP3. When IP3 binds its receptor on the ER, calcium is released. Increased concentrations of calcium and DAG can activate Cdc42 through PKC. Cdc42 is an important regulator of ventral patterning. Increased calcium also activates calcineurin and CaMKII. CaMKII induces activation of the transcription factor NFAT, which regulates cell adhesion, migration and tissue separation. Calcineurin activates TAK1 and NLK kinase, which can interfere with TCF/β-Catenin signaling in the canonical Wnt pathway. However, if PDE is activated, calcium release from the ER is inhibited. PDE mediates this through the inhibition of PKG, which subsequently causes the inhibition of calcium release.

===Integrated Wnt Pathway===
The binary distinction of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways has come under scrutiny and an integrated, convergent Wnt pathway has been proposed. Some evidence for this was found for one Wnt ligand (Wnt5A). Evidence for a convergent Wnt signaling pathway that shows integrated activation of Wnt/Ca2+ and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, for multiple Wnt ligands, was described in mammalian cell lines.

===Other pathways===
Wnt signaling also regulates a number of other signaling pathways that have not been as extensively elucidated. One such pathway includes the interaction between Wnt and GSK3. During cell growth, Wnt can inhibit GSK3 in order to activate mTOR in the absence of β-catenin. However, Wnt can also serve as a negative regulator of mTOR via activation of the tumor suppressor TSC2, which is upregulated via Dsh and GSK3 interaction. During myogenesis, Wnt uses PA and CREB to activate MyoD and Myf5 genes. Wnt also acts in conjunction with Ryk and Src to allow for regulation of neuron repulsion during axonal guidance. Wnt regulates gastrulation when CK1 serves as an inhibitor of Rap1-ATPase in order to modulate the cytoskeleton during gastrulation. Further regulation of gastrulation is achieved when Wnt uses ROR2 along with the CDC42 and JNK pathway to regulate the expression of PAPC. Dsh can also interact with aPKC, Pa3, Par6 and LGl in order to control cell polarity and microtubule cytoskeleton development. While these pathways overlap with components associated with PCP and Wnt/Calcium signaling, they are considered distinct pathways because they produce different responses.

===Regulation===
In order to ensure proper functioning, Wnt signaling is constantly regulated at several points along its signaling pathways.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi:10.1016/j.sbi.2014.10.003&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wnt proteins are palmitoylated. The protein &quot;porcupine&quot; mediates this process, which means that it helps regulate when the Wnt ligand is secreted by determining when it is fully formed. Secretion is further controlled with proteins such as GPR177 (wntless) and evenness interrupted and complexes such as the retromer complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/j.devcel.2009.06.016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon secretion, the ligand can be prevented from reaching its receptor through the binding of proteins such as the stabilizers Dally and glypican 3 (GPC3), which inhibit diffusion. In cancer cells, both the heparan sulfate chains and the core protein of GPC3 are involved in regulating Wnt binding and activation for cell proliferation. Wnt recognizes a heparan sulfate structure on GPC3, which contains IdoA2S and GlcNS6S, and the 3-O-sulfation in GlcNS6S3S enhances the binding of Wnt to the heparan sulfate glypican. A cysteine-rich domain at the N-lobe of GPC3 has been identified to form a Wnt-binding hydrophobic groove including phenylalanine-41 that interacts with Wnt. Blocking the Wnt binding domain using a nanobody called HN3 can inhibit Wnt activation.

At the Fz receptor, the binding of proteins other than Wnt can antagonize signaling. Specific antagonists include Dickkopf (Dkk), Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF-1), secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRP), Cerberus, Frzb, Wise, SOST, and Naked cuticle. These constitute inhibitors of Wnt signaling. However, other molecules also act as activators. Norrin and R-Spondin2 activate Wnt signaling in the absence of Wnt ligand.

Interactions between Wnt signaling pathways also regulate Wnt signaling. As previously mentioned, the Wnt/calcium pathway can inhibit TCF/β-catenin, preventing canonical Wnt pathway signaling. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an essential activator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Interaction of PGE2 with its receptors E2/E4 stabilizes β-catenin through cAMP/PKA mediated phosphorylation. The synthesis of PGE2 is necessary for Wnt signaling mediated processes such as tissue regeneration and control of stem cell population in zebrafish and mouse. Intriguingly, the unstructured regions of several oversized intrinsically disordered proteins play crucial roles in regulating Wnt signaling.

== Induced cell responses ==

=== Embryonic development ===

Wnt signaling plays a critical role in embryonic development. It operates in both vertebrates and invertebrates, including humans, frogs, zebrafish, &quot;C. elegans&quot;, &quot;Drosophila&quot; and others. It was first found in the segment polarity of Drosophila, where it helps to establish anterior and posterior polarities. It is implicated in other developmental processes. As its function in &quot;Drosophila&quot; suggests, it plays a key role in body axis formation, particularly the formation of the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. It is involved in the induction of cell differentiation to prompt formation of important organs such as lungs and ovaries. Wnt further ensures the development of these tissues through proper regulation of cell proliferation and migration. Wnt signaling functions can be divided into axis patterning, cell fate specification, cell proliferation and cell migration.

====Axis patterning====

In early embryo development, the formation of the primary body axes is a crucial step in establishing the organism&#x27;s overall body plan. The axes include the anteroposterior axis, dorsoventral axis, and right-left axis. Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the anteroposterior and dorsoventral (DV) axes. Wnt signaling activity in anterior-posterior development can be seen in mammals, fish and frogs. In mammals, the primitive streak and other surrounding tissues produce the morphogenic compounds Wnts, BMPs, FGFs, Nodal and retinoic acid to establish the posterior region during late gastrula. These proteins form concentration gradients. Areas of highest concentration establish the posterior region while areas of lowest concentration indicate the anterior region. In fish and frogs, β-catenin produced by canonical Wnt signaling causes the formation of organizing centers, which, alongside BMPs, elicit posterior formation. Wnt involvement in DV axis formation can be seen in the activity of the formation of the Spemann organizer, which establishes the dorsal region. Canonical Wnt signaling β-catenin production induces the formation of this organizer via the activation of the genes twin and siamois. Similarly, in avian gastrulation, cells of the Koller&#x27;s sickle express different mesodermal marker genes that allow for the differential movement of cells during the formation of the primitive streak. Wnt signaling activated by FGFs is responsible for this movement.

Wnt signaling is also involved in the axis formation of specific body parts and organ systems later in development. In vertebrates, sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt morphogenetic signaling gradients establish the dorsoventral axis of the central nervous system during neural tube axial patterning. High Wnt signaling establishes the dorsal region while high Shh signaling indicates the ventral region. Wnt is involved in the DV formation of the central nervous system through its involvement in axon guidance. Wnt proteins guide the axons of the spinal cord in an anterior-posterior direction. Wnt is also involved in the formation of the limb DV axis. Specifically, Wnt7a helps produce the dorsal patterning of the developing limb.

In the embryonic differentiation waves model of development Wnt plays a critical role as part a signalling complex in competent cells ready to differentiate. Wnt reacts to the activity of the cytoskeleton, stabilizing the initial change created by a passing wave of contraction or expansion and simultaneously signals the nucleus through the use of its different signalling pathways as to which wave the individual cell has participated in. Wnt activity thereby amplifies mechanical signalling that occurs during development.

====Cell fate specification====

Cell fate specification or cell differentiation is a process where undifferentiated cells can become a more specialized cell type. Wnt signaling induces differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into mesoderm and endoderm progenitor cells. These progenitor cells further differentiate into cell types such as endothelial, cardiac and vascular smooth muscle lineages. Wnt signaling induces blood formation from stem cells. Specifically, Wnt3 leads to mesoderm committed cells with hematopoietic potential. Wnt1 antagonizes neural differentiation and is a major factor in self-renewal of neural stem cells. This allows for regeneration of nervous system cells, which is further evidence of a role in promoting neural stem cell proliferation. Wnt signaling is involved in germ cell determination, gut tissue specification, hair follicle development, lung tissue development, trunk neural crest cell differentiation, nephron development, ovary development and sex determination. Wnt signaling also antagonizes heart formation, and Wnt inhibition was shown to be a critical inducer of heart tissue during development, and small molecule Wnt inhibitors are routinely used to produce cardiomyocytes from pluripotent stem cells.

====Cell proliferation====

In order to have the mass differentiation of cells needed to form the specified cell tissues of different organisms, proliferation and growth of embryonic stem cells must take place. This process is mediated through canonical Wnt signaling, which increases nuclear and cytoplasmic β-catenin. Increased β-catenin can initiate transcriptional activation of proteins such as cyclin D1 and &quot;c-myc&quot;, which control the G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle. Entry into the S phase causes DNA replication and ultimately mitosis, which are responsible for cell proliferation. This proliferation increase is directly paired with cell differentiation because as the stem cells proliferate, they also differentiate. This allows for overall growth and development of specific tissue systems during embryonic development. This is apparent in systems such as the circulatory system where Wnt3a leads to proliferation and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells needed for red blood cell formation.

The biochemistry of cancer stem cells is subtly different from that of other tumor cells. These so-called Wnt-addicted cells hijack and depend on constant stimulation of the Wnt pathway to promote their uncontrolled growth, survival and migration. In cancer, Wnt signaling can become independent of regular stimuli, through mutations in downstream oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that become permanently activated even though the normal receptor has not received a signal. β-catenin binds to transcription factors such as the protein &quot;TCF4&quot; and in combination the molecules activate the necessary genes. LF3 strongly inhibits this binding &quot;in vitro,&quot; in cell lines and reduced tumor growth in mouse models. It prevented replication and reduced their ability to migrate, all without affecting healthy cells. No cancer stem cells remained after treatment. The discovery was the product of &quot;rational drug design&quot;, involving AlphaScreens and ELISA technologies.

====Cell migration====
Cell migration during embryonic development allows for the establishment of body axes, tissue formation, limb induction and several other processes. Wnt signaling helps mediate this process, particularly during convergent extension. Signaling from both the Wnt PCP pathway and canonical Wnt pathway is required for proper convergent extension during gastrulation. Convergent extension is further regulated by the Wnt/calcium pathway, which blocks convergent extension when activated. Wnt signaling also induces cell migration in later stages of development through the control of the migration behavior of neuroblasts, neural crest cells, myocytes, and tracheal cells.

Wnt signaling is involved in another key migration process known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This process allows epithelial cells to transform into mesenchymal cells so that they are no longer held in place at the laminin. It involves cadherin down-regulation so that cells can detach from laminin and migrate. Wnt signaling is an inducer of EMT, particularly in mammary development.

===Insulin sensitivity===

Insulin is a peptide hormone involved in glucose homeostasis within certain organisms. Specifically, it leads to upregulation of glucose transporters in the cell membrane in order to increase glucose uptake from the bloodstream. This process is partially mediated by activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which can increase a cell&#x27;s insulin sensitivity. In particular, Wnt10b is a Wnt protein that increases this sensitivity in skeletal muscle cells.

==Clinical implications==

===Cancer===
Since its initial discovery, Wnt signaling has had an association with cancer. When Wnt1 was discovered, it was first identified as a proto-oncogene in a mouse model for breast cancer. The fact that Wnt1 is a homolog of Wg shows that it is involved in embryonic development, which often calls for rapid cell division and migration. Misregulation of these processes can lead to tumor development via excess cell proliferation.

Canonical Wnt pathway activity is involved in the development of benign and malignant breast tumors. The role of Wnt pathway in tumor chemoresistance has been also well documented, as well as its role in the maintenance of a distinct subpopulation of cancer-initiating cells. Its presence is revealed by elevated levels of β-catenin in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm, which can be detected with immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Increased β-catenin expression is correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. This accumulation may be due to factors such as mutations in β-catenin, deficiencies in the β-catenin destruction complex, most frequently by mutations in structurally disordered regions of &quot;APC&quot;, overexpression of Wnt ligands, loss of inhibitors and/or decreased activity of regulatory pathways (such as the Wnt/calcium pathway). Breast tumors can metastasize due to Wnt involvement in EMT. Research looking at metastasis of basal-like breast cancer to the lungs showed that repression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can prevent EMT, which can inhibit metastasis.

Wnt signaling has been implicated in the development of other cancers as well as in desmoid fibromatosis. Changes in &quot;CTNNB1&quot; expression, which is the gene that encodes β-catenin, can be measured in breast, colorectal, melanoma, prostate, lung, and other cancers. Increased expression of Wnt ligand-proteins such as Wnt1, Wnt2 and Wnt7A were observed in the development of glioblastoma, oesophageal cancer and ovarian cancer respectively. Other proteins that cause multiple cancer types in the absence of proper functioning include ROR1, ROR2, SFRP4, Wnt5A, WIF1 and those of the TCF/LEF family. Wnt signaling is further implicated in the pathogenesis of bone metastasis from breast and prostate cancer with studies suggesting discrete on and off states. Wnt is down-regulated during the dormancy stage by autocrine &quot;DKK1&quot; to avoid immune surveillance, as well as during the dissemination stages by intracellular Dact1. Meanwhile Wnt is activated during the early outgrowth phase by E-selectin.

The link between PGE2 and Wnt suggests that a chronic inflammation-related increase of PGE2 may lead to activation of the Wnt pathway in different tissues, resulting in carcinogenesis.

===Type II diabetes===

Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a common disease that causes reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance in the periphery. It results in increased blood glucose levels, or hyperglycemia, which can be fatal if untreated. Since Wnt signaling is involved in insulin sensitivity, malfunctioning of its pathway could be involved. Overexpression of Wnt5b, for instance, may increase susceptibility due to its role in adipogenesis, since obesity and type II diabetes have high comorbidity. Wnt signaling is a strong activator of mitochondrial biogenesis. This leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) known to cause DNA and cellular damage. This ROS-induced damage is significant because it can cause acute hepatic insulin resistance, or injury-induced insulin resistance. Mutations in Wnt signaling-associated transcription factors, such as TCF7L2, are linked to increased susceptibility.

<doc id="1209058" wikidata="Q1898118" url="?curid=1209058" title="Sultana (grape)">
<text>The sultana is a &quot;white&quot; (pale green), oval seedless grape variety also called the sultanina, Thompson Seedless (United States), Lady de Coverly (England), and oval-fruited Kishmish (Iraq, Iran, Israel, Palestine, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India). It is also known as grape of İzmir or Manisa in Turkey since this variety has been extensively grown in the region around those cities. It is assumed to originate from Asia Minor, which later became part of the Ottoman Empire.

In some countries, especially Commonwealth countries, the name &quot;sultana&quot; is used for the raisin made from it or larger seedless grapes; such &quot;sultana raisins&quot; are often called sultanas or sultanis.

==History==
Originating from Asia Minor, now part of modern-day Turkey and Iran, the Sultana grape was cultivated for its seedless nature and sweet flavor. 

The Ottomans took the sultana grape variety to the island of Crete in the 19th century.

==Etymology==
Thompson Seedless refers to William Thompson, a viticulturist who was an early grower in California and is sometimes credited with introducing the variety. According to the US Code of Federal Regulations, the two names are synonymous. Virtually all of California raisin production (about 97% in 2000) and roughly one-third of California&#x27;s total grape area is of this variety, making it the single most widely planted variety.
Before Thompson Seedless became dominant, Muscat of Alexandria was a primary raisin grape in California. 

==Raisins==
In the US, most raisins, including those with the typical dark brown color, are made from the sultana grape, the Thompson Seedless. The term &quot;sultana&quot; refers to golden-colored dried grapes, which may also be called &quot;golden raisins&quot; (such as marketed by Sun-Maid, a California-based raisin grape growers&#x27; co-op and legacy brand). Any grape may be used to produce golden raisins, and any kind of golden raisins from any kind of grape may be marketed as &quot;sultanas&quot;. Moreover, the golden color may come from a treatment with sulfur dioxide rather than traditional drying and preservation methods. Most nonorganic sultana grapes in California and elsewhere are treated with the growth-inducing plant hormone gibberellin. In other grapes, gibberellin is released by the seeds.

==Other uses==
The sultana grape is also used to make white wine, in which use it is known for its &quot;sweet blandness&quot;. It is referred to as a &quot;three-way grape&quot; because it is used as a table grape, to make raisins and to make wine. In the United States, it is the base for wine generically called &quot;chablis&quot;. This wine is named for the Chablis region of France, but it is not a true Chablis wine. In the EU, &quot;Chablis&quot; wine must be made from the Chardonnay grape produced in the region of the Yonne département.

End uses include:
* Manufacturing industries such as bakeries and breakfast cereal producers
* Supermarkets
* Dairy products such as yogurt and ice-creams
* Salads and desserts
Its triple use has made the Thompson Seedless the most planted grape in California.

Sultana grape juice was fraudulently sold as being of Chardonnay grapes in Australia for winemaking, as Sultana grapes cost less. The fraud was discovered in 2003 by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. It was considered the largest case of wine deception in Australian history.

===Sultaniye wines===
Sultaniye wines are dry and semi-dry, light-bodied wines produced in Turkey. Sultaniye grapes used in winemaking are mainly grown at Denizli and Manisa in the Aegean Region of Turkey. Sultaniye grapes are consumed as table grapes and raisins and used in winemaking. The Semillon and Sultaniye wines from the Marmara Region of Turkey attract attention not only in the local market but also in international markets.

=== Sultaniye Rakı ===
Sultaniye is the most common variety for rakı production due to its high volume of cultivation and traditional taste. Also in recent years, due to increasing market demand for product differentiation, companies led to use various varieties and methods to gain competitive advantage in the growing sector of Turkish alcoholic beverages. This trend emerges from the desire to revive old, rare, and local varieties.

<text>Sergeant Alfred Joseph Richards VC (21 June 1879 – 21 May 1953) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Richards was born in Plymouth, Devon, the son of a former colour sergeant in the Lancashire Fusiliers. In 1895 Richards himself joined the Lancashire Fusiliers as a bandboy, rising to sergeant by 1914. After war broke out in 1914, he travelled with his battalion to Gallipoli in Turkey.

Richards was 35 years old, and a sergeant in the 1st Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25 April 1915 west of Cape Helles, Gallipoli, three companies and the Headquarters of the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, when landing on W Beach, were met by deadly fire from hidden machine-guns which caused many casualties. The survivors, however, rushed up and cut the wire entanglements, notwithstanding the terrific fire from the enemy and, after overcoming supreme difficulties, the cliffs were gained and the position maintained.

Sergeant Richards was one of six members of the regiment elected for the award, the others being Cuthbert Bromley, John Elisha Grimshaw, William Kenealy, Frank Edward Stubbs, and Richard Raymond Willis. The courage of the six men was described in the Press as &quot;6 VCs before breakfast&quot;.

As a result of a wound sustained in the action, Richards had to have his leg amputated and was discharged from the army as unfit for further service. Despite this he served in the Home Guard during World War II as a provost sergeant.

Richards is buried in Putney Vale Cemetery.

==The Medal==
His medals were purchased by Lord Ashcroft at auction in 2005 and are held by the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1209062" wikidata="Q2300062" url="?curid=1209062" title="Sultana (title)">
<text>Sultana or sultanah (; &quot;&quot;) is a female royal title, and the feminine form of the word sultan. This term has been officially used for female monarchs in some Islamic states, and historically it was also used for sultan&#x27;s consorts.

==Nomenclature==
The term &quot;sultana&quot; is the feminine form of the word sultan (), an Arabic abstract noun meaning &quot;strength&quot;, &quot;authority&quot;, &quot;rulership&quot;, derived from the verbal noun &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;authority&quot; or &quot;power&quot;. Later, sultan came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms, albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate.

==Usage==

===Ruling sultana===
Some Muslim female monarchs chose to adopt the title of Sultana/Sultanah when they ascended to the throne.

====Africa==== 
In Comoros, there have been several ruling sultanas.

Shajar al-Durr became the ruling sultana of Egypt on May 1250, founding the Mamluk Sultanate.

====South Asia====
Razia Sultana (r. 1236–1240) was a ruler of the Delhi Sultanate in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. She was the first female Muslim ruler of the Indian Subcontinent.

In Maldives, there have been six ruling sultanas:
* Khadijah (1347–1363, 1364–1374, 1376–1380)
* Raadhafathi (1380)
* Dhaain (1383–1388)
* Kuda Kala Kamanafa’anu (1607–1609)
* Amina I (1753–1754)
* Amina II (1757–1759)

====Southeast Asia====
Nur ul-Azam became the female sultan in Sultanate of Sulu.

In Samudera Pasai Sultanate (now part of Indonesia), Sultana Ratu Nahrasyiyah (r. 1406–1428) became the sole ruler.

Of the six female monarchs in Bone state (now part of Indonesia), three used the title sultana.

In Aceh Darussalam (now part of Indonesia), there have been four ruling sultanas:
* Sultana Seri Ratu Ta&#x27;jul Alam Syafiatuddin Syah of Aceh (1641–1675) was the daughter of Sultan Iskandar Muda, and wife of Sultan Iskandar Tani. She spoke 6 languages, Acehnese, Malay, Spanish, Dutch, Arabic, and Persian.
* Sultana Seri Ratu Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah (1675–1678).
* Sultana Seri Ratu Zakiatuddin Inayat Syah (1678–1688).
* Sultana Seri Ratu Kamalat Syah (1688–1699). Replaced by her husband, under pressure from the Mufti of Mecca.

In (now part of Indonesia), there have been two ruling sultanas:
* (reigned 1759–1761)
* (reigned 1791–1795)

On 5 May 2015, Sultan Yogyakarta and governor of the Special Region of Yogyakarta in Indonesia Hamengkubuwono X, who only has daughters, appointed his eldest child, Lady Nurmalitasari, as his heiress presumptive, henceforth titled Princess Mangkubumi. If she does succeed her father, she will become the first Javanese woman to become a Sultana in her own right.

====West Asia====
Sati Beg issued coins using the title &quot;sultan&quot; or &quot;sultana&quot;.

===Sultana consort===
Sultana is also used for sultan&#x27;s wives. Between 1914 and 1922, monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty used the title of Sultan of Egypt, and their wives were legally styled as sultanas. Two women held the title of sultana during the short-lived Sultanate of Egypt: Melek Tourhan, the wife of Sultan Hussein Kamel, and Nazli Sabri, the wife of Sultan Fuad I. Nazli Sabri became queen (&quot;malika&quot;) following the establishment of the Kingdom of Egypt in 1922, and it is with the latter title that she is almost always associated. Melek Tourhan, on the other hand, legally retained the title of sultana even after Egypt became a kingdom, and is often referred to simply as Sultana Melek.

Sultana is also title for consort of ruler in some Malaysian states. Some consorts who hold this title are:
* Sultanah Kalsom, second wife of Ahmad Shah of Pahang. She became Sultanah of Pahang on 30 September 1992 until 15 August 2019.
* Sultanah Nur Zahirah, consort of Mizan Zainal Abidin of Terengganu. She became Sultanah of Terengganu on 5 June 2006.
* Sultanah Haminah, second wife of Abdul Halim of Kedah. She succeeded as Sultanah of Kedah after her predecessor&#x27;s death on 21 November 2003 until 11 September 2017.
* Sultanah Maliha, consort of Sallehuddin of Kedah. She became Sultanah of Kedah on 12 September 2017 after her husband was proclaimed as the Sultan of Kedah.
* Sultanah Nur Diana Petra, consort of Muhammad V of Kelantan. She married with the Sultan of Kelantan on 30 October 2010 and officially proclaimed the title Sultanah of Kelantan by her husband on 2 August 2022.

==Claim==
In the west, the title of sultana is also used to refer to many female Muslim monarchs who don&#x27;t hold this title officially.

In medieval Egypt, Shajar al-Durr, a former slave of Armenian origin, ascended the throne in 1250. Although several sources assert that she took the title of sultana, &quot;The Cambridge History of Islam&quot; disputes the claim, stating that &quot;a feminine form, sultana, does not exist in Arabic: the title &quot;sulṭān&quot; appears on Shajar al-Durr&#x27;s only extant coin.&quot;

Raziya al-Din, usually referred to in history as Razia Sultana, was the Sultan of Delhi in India from 1236 to May 1240. Like some other princesses of the time, she was trained to lead armies and administer kingdoms if necessary. She was the first female ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. She refused to be addressed as Sultana because it meant &quot;wife or consort of a Sultan&quot; and would answer only to the title &quot;Sultan.&quot; Like Shajar al-Durr, Raziya was also often referred as sultana by westerners, very possibly to distinguish her from male sultans.

Sultana was also often used to refer to women relatives of a sultan and other Muslim monarch or female members of Muslim dynasties, especially mothers and chief wives. In fact, many sultanates used other title for sultan&#x27;s chief consort, some of which derived from non-Arabic language.

&quot;Permaisuri&quot;, a title for a chief wife of a sultan in many sultanates and Muslim kingdoms in southeast Asia, is derived from Tamil பரமேஸ்வரி (paramēsvari), from Sanskrit परमेश्वरी (parameśvarī), &#x27;supreme lady&#x27;. This title is still used for the consort of Yang di-Pertuan Agong, monarch and head of state of Malaysia. The formal way of addressing her is Raja Permaisuri Agong.

In Brunei, official title for a chief wife of the sultan is &quot;Seri Baginda Raja Isteri&quot;, derived from Sanskrit &quot;raja&quot; (राजा, equivalent with &quot;king&quot;) and &quot;isteri&quot; (equivalent with &quot;women&quot; or &quot;lady&quot;). The official title for sultan&#x27;s mother is &quot;Seri Suri Begawan Raja Isteri&quot;.

&quot;Shahbanu&quot;, title for the wife of Iran&#x27;s monarch, is derived from Persian &quot;shah&quot; (شاه, equivalent with &quot;king&quot;) and &quot;banu&quot; (بانو, translated as &quot;lady&quot;). Upon assuming the title in 1967, Farah Pahlavi, the third wife of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was the first &quot;shahbanu&quot; to be crowned in Iran since the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century. &quot;Shahbanu&quot; often translated in English as &quot;empress&quot;.

Some Muslim monarchs also used the title &quot;malika&quot; (Arabic: ملكة), a feminine form of the word &quot;malik&quot;, for their wives. This title is still used in many Muslim kingdoms, like Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.

===Ottoman royalty===
Since 16th century, Ottoman used the title &quot;sultan&quot; for imperial princesses after their given names (e.g. Mihrimah Sultan and Hatice Sultan). They were all non-ruling royalty; in the western sense, princesses, not queens or empresses. The monarch&#x27;s mother, who had more power, had the title Valide sultan (e.g. Hafsa Sultan). She was referred to by this title alone, without her given name. Principal consort had the title Haseki Sultan (e.g. Hürrem Sultan). Non-principal consorts had the title &quot;hatun&quot;, equivalent to &quot;lady&quot;. This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative. Nevertheless, westerners often translated their official title, &quot;sultan&quot;, to &quot;sultana&quot;, possibly to distinguish them from the Ottoman ruler.

<text>Two Headed is a 1995 album by Spirit of the West.

It is the band&#x27;s darkest and heaviest album, with many songs directly addressing the subject of death. Ken Marshall, a noted Canadian producer of industrial music, produced the album, giving many songs a densely layered, textured production which results in an almost psychedelic hard rock sound.

The album reached #20 on &quot;RPM&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 albums chart the week of July 31, 1995.

&quot;Tell Me What I Think&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, was a notable hit, peaking at #25 on the &quot;RPM&quot; singles chart the week of August 14. The song was also released on CD single, with several remixes by Marshall. The song&#x27;s video, directed by Morris Panych, was choreographed around a fixed-location camera. However, despite the song&#x27;s chart success, the video became their first in many years &quot;not&quot; to receive significant rotation on MuchMusic.

==Promotion==
In promotion for the album, Spirit of the West was featured on the cover of the June 11, 1995 issue of &quot;RPM&quot; magazine. The cover featured the band dressed in drag.

<doc id="1209067" wikidata="Q1478911" url="?curid=1209067" title="Mount Brandon">
<text>Mount Brandon or Brandon (), at , is one of the ten highest peaks in Ireland, being the 8th–highest peak in Ireland on the Arderin list, and the 9th–highest on the Vandeleur-Lynam list. Brandon is the highest Irish mountain outside the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks range and has the greatest prominence of any Irish peak except Carrauntoohil, Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain.

Mount Brandon is at the centre of a long high ridge called the Brandon Group range of mountains in the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry. The ridge contains seven other major peaks (i.e. above 2,000 ft in height); one is the similarly named Brandon Peak (840 metres). The positioning and dimensions of the Brandon Group ridge have made it the scene of several air accidents over the years. The mountain, and range, is named after Saint Brendan, and is the end of a Christian pilgrimage trail known as &quot;Cosán na Naomh&quot;. It is also well regarded for hill walking with routes such as the 4–5-hour &quot;Faha Route&quot; (also called &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Path&quot;), and the 6–7-hour traverse of the entire range known as &quot;one of the finest ridgewalks in Ireland&quot;.

==Geology==
Brandon is composed of sandstone particles of various sizes collectively known as &quot;Old Red Sandstone&quot;. Old Red Sandstone has a purple–reddish colour, and has virtually no fossils. The colour gave its name to nearby Purple Mountain. The composition of &quot;Old Red Sandstone&quot; is variable and contains quartz stones, mudstones, siltstones, and sandstone particles (conglomerate rock boulders with quartz pebbles are visible). They are described by the Geological Survey of Ireland as the oldest Devonian rocks in Ireland.

==Geography==

Mount Brandon itself is in the middle of a long and high ridge known as the Brandon Group, which runs north–south for across the width of the Dingle peninsula. As well as Mount Brandon, the Brandon Group ridge has seven other major classified peaks (see list below), including the similarly named Brandon Peak , Benagh , Faha Ridge , Gearhane , Masatiompan , Piaras Mór , and An Scraig .

The most distinctive aspect of the Brandon Group is the contrast between the gentle grassy slopes on its western side, and the sharp cliffs and deep corries of its eastern side; an effect that the Brandon Group&#x27;s long north–south ridge exactly separates.
Mount Brandon owes its craggy shape to the work of glaciers during the ice age, which gouged out a series of corries on the eastern flank of the mountain. The summit of Mount Brandon is rounded and smooth as it was likely a nunatuk (like Lugnaquilla in Wicklow), and presents a stark contrast to Brandon Peak, or &quot;Barr an Ghéaráin&quot;, which is alpine in appearance.

On Brandon&#x27;s deep eastern corrie, flanked by Faha Ridge to its north, is a series of rocky plateaus, each of which has a small paternoster lake; over ten lakes grow in size descending the mountain. From highest they are, the Locha Chom an Chnoic (Coumaknock Loughs), Loch na Lice (Lough Nalacken) and Loch Cruite (Lough Cruttia). This corrie&#x27;s natural environment, and positioning on the &quot;Faha Route&quot;, means it is regularly photographed.

Brandon is the 340th–highest mountain, and 10th most prominent mountain, in Britain and Ireland, on the Simms classification. Brandon is regarded by the Scottish Mountaineering Club (&quot;SMC&quot;) as one of 34 Furths, which is a mountain above in elevation, and meets the other SMC criteria for a Munro (e.g. &quot;sufficient separation&quot;), but which is outside of (or &quot;furth&quot;) Scotland; Brandon is referred to as one of the 13 Irish Munros.

Brandon&#x27;s prominence qualifies for the P600 classification. Both Brandon and Brandon Peak, meet the Britain and Ireland Marilyn classification. Brandon is the 3rd highest mountain, and Brandon Peak is the 9th highest mountain, in the MountainViews Online Database, &quot;100 Highest Irish Mountains&quot;.

==Naming==

The mountain is called Brandon Mountain, Mount Brandon and Brandon on various maps.

Brandon takes its name from Saint Brendan the Navigator, or &quot;Bréanainn&quot;, who is said to have been born in what is now County Kerry in 484 AD, and is chiefly known for his legendary voyage in a boat of wood and leather to discover the &quot;Isle of the Blessed&quot;, also called Saint Brendan&#x27;s Island. In the story of Brendan&#x27;s life (titled, the &quot;Beatha Bhréanainn&quot;, or the Latin version, the &quot;Vita Brendani&quot;), he spent three days fasting on the mountain before his voyage, was visited by an angel, and experienced a vision of &quot;a great land to the west&quot;; the mountain is described as being surrounded by the ocean, which fits with the topography of Mount Brandon.

Irish academic Paul Tempan wrote in his 2010 &quot;Irish Hill and Mountain Names&quot;, that it is likely that the mountain was a source of pilgrimage even before both St. Brendan and the arrival of Christianity altogether. Its importance may be due to the fact that, being so far west and so high, it is the place where the sun can be seen the latest as it sinks below the horizon. Tempan notes that the medieval story about Brendan&#x27;s life calls the mountain &quot;Sliabh nDaidche&quot; in the Irish version, or &quot;Mons Aitche&quot; in the Latin version; and that the Irish academic Dr Alan Mac an Bhaird, had translated this as &quot;mountain of Faithche&quot;, as Brandon stands in the Faha townland. However, some believe that the &quot;Mons Aitche&quot; name refers to Slieve Aughty, rather than to Mount Brandon.

Some sources link the name with the voyages of Bran mac Febail, however, this is considered less likely.

==Hill walking==

The quickest and easiest route to the summit of Mount Brandon is from the west via the final stages of the medieval pilgrim path, &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Route&quot; (), which begins away in Ventry. The route starts from the car park of Ballybrack () (), and follows the straight grassy path, marked by large crosses, to the summit of Mount Brandon; then retracing back to Ballybrack. The route takes 3–4 hours. A longer 5-hour variation is to continue north along the summit ridge from Mount Brandon to Piaras Mor, and then descend to Ballyknockane.

A scenic variation is the 4–5-hour &quot;Faha Route&quot;, the &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Path&quot;, which starts from the east via the car park at the &quot;Faha Grotto&quot; () just outside Cloghane. The route to the summit is marked, and offers views of the deep corries and paternoster lakes on Brandon&#x27;s glaciated east face. It follows a trail below the Faha Ridge to the summit; then retracing back to &quot;Faha Grotto&quot;.

The full ridge walk of the entire Mount Brandon range, regarded as &quot;one of the finest ridge walks in Ireland&quot;, crosses the full ridge of the Brandon Group from the Conor Pass to Masatiompan and takes 6–7 hours. The route from the Conor Pass to Mount Brandon and back to the Conor Pass is even longer, at and takes up to 8 hours to complete.

==List of peaks==

The following is a download from the &quot;MountainViews Online Database&quot;, who list 15 Brandon Group peaks over 100 metres.


==Pilgrimage==

Due to its link with Saint Brendan, the mountain is popular with Irish Catholic pilgrims. The mountain&#x27;s relative height and status of being at an extreme westerly point appears to have been of great importance to Saint Brendan. A pilgrimage route called &quot;Cosán na Naomh&quot; (&quot;The Saints Road&quot;) begins at &quot;Cill Mhic an Domhnaigh&quot; (Kilvickadowning) on Ventry Strand at the southern end of the Dingle peninsula, and ends at &quot;Séipéilín Bréanainn&quot; (&quot;Brendan&#x27;s Oratory&quot;) on Brandon&#x27;s summit. &quot;Sáipéilín Bréanainn&quot; is the remains of a stone building believed to have been used by Saint Brendan. The path to the peak is marked by small white crosses and the peak itself is topped by a large metal cross. It is speculated the pilgrimage originated in pre-Christian times as a Lughnasadh ritual.

In 1997, the Irish Heritage Council set up the Pilgrim Paths Project to restore walking routes along Irish medieval pilgrimage paths. One of the routes chosen was &quot;Cosán na Naomh&quot;, and an 18–kilometre way-marked trail was constructed between Ventry Strand and the grotto at Ballybrack at the foot of Mount Brandon. The trail has been developed to the standard required by the Irish Sports Council for National Waymarked Trails in Ireland. For safety reasons, it was decided not to mark the trail to the end of the medieval route at the summit of Brandon, but to finish at Ballybrack. The starting point at Ventry is one of the places pilgrims would have come ashore. The trail passes a number of important ecclesiastical heritage sites including Gallarus Oratory and Kilmalkedar monastic site.

== Aircraft accidents==
Between 1940 and 1943 a number of Allied and Axis aircraft crashed on Brandon and the Faha Ridge.

* 20 August 1940: A Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor crash-landed on Faha Ridge, the crew of six survived and were the first known aircrew from Germany to land in Ireland during the Second World War. A plaque commemorating this event is on display in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Bar and Guest House in Cloghane Village.
* 28 July 1943: A BOAC Civilian &quot;Short Sunderland III&quot; Flying Boat crashed due to a navigation error onto the lower slopes of Mount Brandon while flying from West Africa to Foynes Flying Boat Base. Ten of the twenty-five on board were killed in the wreck. An anchor from the wreck is in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Bar and Guest House.
* 22 August 1943: A RAF &quot;Short Sunderland III Flying Boat&quot; belonging to 201 Squadron crashed while flying a patrol in the Atlantic, out of Castle Archdale. It crashed into the lower slopes of Mount Brandon. Eight of the crew of eleven were killed. A plaque commemorating those killed is in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Bar and Guest House.
* 20 December 1943: A RAF &quot;Vickers Wellington&quot; belonging to 304 Squadron based out of Predannack Airfield crashed directly into Mount Brandon. All of the six Polish crew members were killed. Engines from the wreck are also on display in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Bar.

<text>Willy Albertina Verbrugge (born 3 February 1945), known as Willeke Alberti, is a Dutch singer and actress, the daughter of entertainer and singer Willy Alberti (1926–1985) and Hendrika Geertruida Kuiper (1921–2011).

==Biography==

Alberti started her career at the early age of eleven in the musical &quot;Duel om Barbara&quot; and she recorded her first single in 1958 together with her father. During the 1960s, she was a well-known singer in the Netherlands and had at least one No. 1 hit with &quot;De winter was lang&quot; (&quot;The winter was long&quot;), however there was no official Dutch chart at the time. Willeke and her father had a television show between 1965 and 1969. Her singing career from 1970 onwards is less active, however Alberti still releases singles and albums at an irregular interval and plays minor roles in television programs and movies.
From 1965 to 1974 she was married to musician Joop Oonk and they had a daughter. She married John de Mol in 1976, and they had a son, Johnny de Mol. The couple divorced in 1980, and Alberti married a third time, with football player Søren Lerby. Another son was born from that marriage. Søren Lerby and Alberti separated in 1996.

In 1994 she represented the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Waar is de zon?&quot; (&quot;Where is the sun?&quot;), which claimed a meagre four points from the international juries, all coming from Austria, placing 23rd.

Through the years Alberti has become embraced in the Netherlands as a gay icon, due to a combination of her song repertoire, her durability and her performances in support of many gay causes. She is the mother-in-law of John van &#x27;t Schip.

<doc id="1209074" wikidata="Q2394476" url="?curid=1209074" title="Permeance">
<text>Permeance, in general, is the degree to which a material admits a flow of matter or energy. Permeance is usually represented by a curly capital P: .

==Electromagnetism==
In electromagnetism, permeance is the inverse of reluctance. In a magnetic circuit, permeance is a measure of the quantity of magnetic flux for a number of current-turns. A magnetic circuit almost acts as though the flux is conducted, therefore permeance is larger for large cross-sections of a material and smaller for smaller cross section lengths. This concept is analogous to electrical conductance in the electric circuit.

Magnetic permeance is defined as the reciprocal of magnetic reluctance (in analogy with the reciprocity between electric conductance and resistance):
formula_1

which can also be re-written:
formula_2

using Hopkinson&#x27;s law (magnetic circuit analogue of Ohm&#x27;s law for electric circuits) and the definition of magnetomotive force (magnetic analogue of electromotive force): 
formula_3

where:
* , magnetic flux,
* , current, in amperes,
* , winding number of, or count of turns in the electric coil.

Alternatively in terms of magnetic permeability (analogous to electric conductivity):
formula_4

where:
* , permeability of material,
* , cross-sectional area,
* ℓ, magnetic path length.

The SI unit of magnetic permeance is the henry (H), equivalently, webers per ampere.

==Materials science==
In materials science, permeance is the degree to which a material transmits another substance.

<doc id="1209075" wikidata="Q432473" url="?curid=1209075" title="Melania Trump">
<text>Melania Knauss Trump (born Melanija Knavs, April26, 1970) is a Slovenian and American former model serving as the first lady of the United States since 2025 as the wife of President Donald Trump. She previously held the role from 2017 to 2021. She is the first naturalized citizen to become first lady, the second foreign-born first lady after Louisa Adams (wife of John Quincy Adams), the second Catholic first lady after Jacqueline Kennedy (wife of John F. Kennedy), and the second first lady to serve two non-consecutive terms after Frances Cleveland (wife of Grover Cleveland).

Melanija Knavs was born in SR Slovenia—then part of Yugoslavia—where she began working as a fashion model at the age of 16. She changed the spelling of her name to Melania Knauss, and she traveled to Paris and Milan to seek modeling work before meeting Paolo Zampolli, who hired her and sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1996. She continued working as a model in Manhattan, where Zampolli introduced her to the real estate developer Donald Trump in 1998. Melania and Donald began dating shortly afterward. He worked to get her more modeling jobs, and she supported him during his 2000 presidential campaign. Melania and Donald Trump married in 2005, and they had a son, Barron Trump, the following year. She dedicated most of her time to Barron during his infancy, spending less time working or accompanying her husband at events. She started her own jewelry brand, Melania, in 2009.

After encouraging Donald to run for president in the 2016 presidential election, Melania only made rare campaign appearances, opting to help Donald strategize over the phone. She received major press coverage during the campaign when erotic photos from her modeling years were uncovered and published, and again when a speech she gave at the 2016 Republican National Convention was found to be plagiarized from a similar speech by Michelle Obama. In the month leading up to the election, she defended her husband following the release of the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape that mired his campaign in scandal.

Melania stayed in Manhattan for the first months of her tenure as first lady, allowing Barron to finish school and Melania to renegotiate her prenuptial agreement. Her stepdaughter Ivanka Trump fulfilled some of the first lady&#x27;s traditional duties. She kept to minimal activity after moving into the White House, often staying in the residence instead of her office in the East Wing, and she held fewer events than previous first ladies. Melania faced several challenges in 2018, including allegations of extramarital affairs by her husband, surgery for kidney disease, and a tour of Africa that was overshadowed by scrutiny of her wardrobe and personal conduct. During her tenure as first lady, Melania prioritized children&#x27;s issues, launching the Be Best campaign to promote children&#x27;s welfare and visiting many children&#x27;s hospitals. She was also a close advisor to her husband, influencing his decisions to end the Trump administration&#x27;s family separation policy and ban fruit-flavored electronic cigarette cartridges. In the final months of her tenure, Melania endorsed her husband&#x27;s false claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. After leaving the White House in 2021, she largely stayed out of the public view before assuming the role of first lady again in 2025.

== Early life and education ==
Melanija Knavs was born in Novo Mesto, Yugoslavia, now part of present-day Slovenia, on April 26, 1970. Her father Viktor Knavs first worked as a chauffeur, and he eventually sold car parts for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer as he made connections with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the national communist party. Her mother Amalija worked as a patternmaker at the children&#x27;s clothing manufacturer Jutranjka in Sevnica. In Sevnica, the family lived in the state-run housing complex Naselje Heroja Maroka. She has an older sister, Ines, and an older half-brother from her father&#x27;s previous relationship, Denis Cigelnjak, whom she reportedly has never met. Her father denied paternity of the boy, even after it was confirmed by a paternity test.

Although Melanija&#x27;s father was a member of Yugoslavia&#x27;s communist party, which espoused a policy of state atheism, he had his daughters secretly baptized as Catholic, as was common. The family was well-off relative to most who lived in communist societies. They frequently went on vacations to other parts of Europe. Their apartment was decorated with brightly colored walls, which was a major departure from other apartments in the country.

As a child, Melanija, like other children of workers at the factory, participated in fashion shows that featured children&#x27;s clothing. Textiles were Sevnica&#x27;s primary industry. Students were excused from school to participate in the shows. From a young age, Melanija expressed an interest in fashion, and she began customizing and sewing her own clothes. She developed a skill for it by watching her mother work. Melanija did well in school, where she was appointed school treasurer.

When Melanija was a teenager, she moved to a two-story house in Sevnica with her family. From her youth in Slovenia, Melanija was influenced by the United States: she described the presidency of Ronald Reagan as the beginning of a new era in her own country and the debut of CNN International in 1985 gave her family access to American media. Of particular interest to Melanija was the new exposure to global fashion. At the age of fifteen, she began attending the Secondary School for Design and Photography in Ljubljana, making the long commute from her hometown to the capital and back each day by train. After her first year, she and Ines moved to the capital together in an apartment paid for by their father. After graduating at age nineteen, Melanija enrolled in the Faculty of Architecture and Civil and Geodetic Engineering at the University of Ljubljana to further study design, leaving after a few months without finishing her degree.

== Early modeling career ==

=== European career ===
Melania was discovered by Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko when she was sixteen, after modeling in a school-sponsored show. At the time, she had wanted to be a fashion designer rather than a model. Melania won a modeling contest with the Italian studio Cinecittà that entitled her to a movie role, but she rejected the prize after a producer sexually propositioned her. As her modeling career progressed, Melania took on an alternate spelling of her name, Melania Knauss. She traveled Europe to find modeling work. Except for a few close relatives, she did not maintain contact with anyone she knew in Slovenia. In 1992, Melania was named runner-up in the &quot;Jana Magazine&quot; Look of the Year contest, which promised its top three contestants an international modeling contract. She signed with RVR Reclame in Milan, but she left the organization a few months later.

Melania spent the following years traveling Europe for modeling jobs, including one in which she portrayed the first female president of the United States in 1993. Around age 23 or 24, she made Paris her primary residence, where she lived with her roommate Victoria Silvstedt. Melania modeled for fashion houses in Paris and Milan, where in 1995 she met Metropolitan Models co-owner Paolo Zampolli, who was on a scouting trip in Europe. Zampolli, a friend of her future husband Donald Trump, became one of the few people who was involved in Melania&#x27;s life for a long time.

=== Relocating to New York ===
Zampolli urged Melania to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her. In 1996, Melania moved to Manhattan. By this time, she was already 26 years old, much older than most aspiring models. Zampolli encouraged Melania to live near and socialize with people in the fashion industry, and he arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian in Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square. Her rent was taken from her pay with Zampolli&#x27;s agency. Once she resided in the United States, she returned to her home country only sparingly and only for short periods of time. She lived a healthy lifestyle, managing her diet carefully, and she avoided the drinking and partying that often consumed the lives of the models around her. She did not lead an active social life and only went out on rare occasions. Melania was featured in a sexually explicit photo shoot for a 1997 issue of &quot;Max&quot;, a French men&#x27;s magazine, with another female model. The photos were shot by the photographer Alexandre Ale de Basseville, and the work was unpaid, instead promising Melania exposure in a prominent magazine. The photos were largely forgotten until they were published by the &quot;New York Post&quot; in 2016.

For her first weeks in the United States, her travel visa did not allow her to work in the country. Despite this, she accepted ten modeling jobs that earned her approximately $20,000 (). She then received an H-1B visa that allowed her to work. She received her first major job when she posed for a Camel cigarette ad shot by Ellen von Unwerth, which was displayed as a Times Square billboard and ran in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The opportunity came about from a law that required cigarette ads only feature individuals above the age of 25, which excluded most aspiring models. When her roommate Atanian left New York, Melania moved to an apartment off of Park Avenue.

== Marriage and family ==
=== Meeting Donald Trump ===

In September 1998, Zampolli introduced Melania to the real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party. Donald had a date to the event, Celina Midelfart. When he asked Melania for her phone number, she refused. Instead, she insisted that he give her his own number. He passed her test when he gave her multiple personal numbers instead of an office number. She later said that giving her own number would make her &quot;just one of the women he calls&quot;. The exact details of when and where this took place are unclear, though the Kit Kat Club is often described as where they met.

After a week, Melania called Donald and they went on a date. She intentionally gave him an indifferent attitude to his advances, knowing this would pique his interest. Not only was Donald&#x27;s personality similar to that of Melania&#x27;s father, but they were of similar ages and had similar physical appearances. When they began dating, Melania had access to his book &quot;&quot;, in which he detailed what he wanted from a relationship.

Melania held a press conference on September 8, spending the event recounting her successes and telling reporters that she was &quot;world famous&quot;, &quot;among the top 50&quot; highest paid models in the world, and set to appear in a movie alongside Mickey Rourke. The intention was to build her profile in anticipation of another, ultimately unsuccessful, cigarette ad campaign. This was unusual behavior for a woman who typically kept a quiet and professional presence, and reporters were unable to verify the claims she made. The Trumps have stated that they met at the New York Fashion Week shortly after this conference, but according to biographer Mary Jordan, rumors in the industry suggested that their relationship had already developed by then. Their relationship initially only lasted a few weeks. Melania left Donald after she saw his ex-girlfriend Kara Young leaving Trump Tower, but she reunited with him the following week.

=== Relationship with Donald Trump ===
Donald&#x27;s fame and connections gave her new career opportunities. Shortly after the death of Jacqueline Kennedy, whom Melania and her mother had deeply admired, Melania met the Kennedy family at a gala. She continued to encounter celebrities while attending events with Donald.

Melania continued her modeling career after meeting Donald, though she took fewer jobs as time went on and she dedicated more time to him. In 1999, the couple gained attention after an interview with shock jock Howard Stern on his show, in which he asked them lewd sexual questions. Donald often brought Melania to meetings to show her off, praising her beauty. He did not let her participate in the business, citing the conflict he had with his first wife after giving her an executive role.Donald announced his candidacy for the Reform Party presidential nomination on October 7, 1999. Melania adamantly supported the move. When asked by &quot;The New York Times&quot; what her role would be if Donald were to become president, Melania replied: &quot;I would be very traditional, like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy.&quot; Melania saw extensive media attention as tabloids considered the idea of a model as first lady.

Melania was one of the first models recruited to Donald&#x27;s modeling agency, Trump Model Management, after its creation in February 1999. The following months, she appeared in several magazines and advertisements organized by individuals close to Donald. While Donald was organizing his campaign, Melania appeared in the February edition of &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;. The image featured her in a bikini alongside a large inflatable whale, and the shoot was run by Antoine Verglas, an associate of Zampolli&#x27;s. Shortly after the shoot, Verglas called Melania back for another project where he had her pose nude in a Bond girl aesthetic. Melania later said that she stood &#x27;proudly behind [her] nude modeling work&#x27; in a post on X in September of 2024. Donald had lobbied for her inclusion in a &quot;GQ&quot; spread, and her relationship with Donald allowed the shoot access to his Boeing 727. Images from the shoot were featured in the January 2000 edition of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine. At the time, Donald&#x27;s involvement was not made known. She then appeared in another sexualized photo shoot where she was posted in a mock-up of the Oval Office.

In January 2000, news broke that Melania and Donald had broken up, with conflicting accounts of who ended the relationship. Many photos and publicity pieces the two had done together were quickly edited before publication to accommodate the change. They kept in contact, and they reunited a few months later. Melania received her green card in 2001, granting her permanent residency in the United States. Melania and Donald moved in together at Trump Tower in 2002. She made her first appearance on Donald&#x27;s game show &quot;The Apprentice&quot; in April 2004 when an episode had the contestants visit their penthouse.

=== Engagement and wedding ===
Donald proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, on her birthday as they were leaving to attend the Met Gala. He reasoned that he was more willing to wed as she had not insisted on marriage, and he felt she was an influence in the success he had seen over the previous years. She also signed his prenuptial agreement without issue. A few months before the wedding, Melania traveled to Paris with Anna Wintour and André Leon Talley to find a wedding dress, and Melania decided on a dress by John Galliano. In the days leading up to the wedding, she appeared on the front cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; in her dress.

Donald and Melania married on January 22, 2005, at the Bethesda-by-the-Sea church in Palm Beach, Florida. The ceremony was followed by a reception in the ballroom at Donald&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago estate, which Melania planned with Preston Bailey. Numerous celebrities were present, including musicians, athletes, media executives, and television personalities. She had one bridesmaid, her sister Ines, who had moved to New York so they could be closer together. Melania arranged all of the details of the wedding with her planner. She let Donald make decisions about the event, but she refused his suggestion that the wedding be broadcast on NBC.

=== Marriage and motherhood ===

The Trumps had three residences that they traveled between: Trump Tower in New York, Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, and Mar-a-Lago in Florida. To have her own private abode, Melania had a private spa constructed on the top floor of Trump Tower. As a couple, the two did not spend much direct time together, preferring to live adjacently with one another. According to Donald, their passive relationship suited him because he worked for a living and did not &quot;want to go home and work at a relationship&quot;. Melania accepted a transaction element in their relationship, though she cared about Donald and did not believe that she was a gold digger. When she attended events with her husband at Trump facilities, she often stayed for only a few minutes to make an appearance before returning to the private residence. Donald did not learn to speak Melania&#x27;s native language, which she said she accepted because she is &quot;not a nagging wife&quot;.

Upon marrying Donald, Melania became stepmother to his four children: Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump from his first marriage to Ivana Zelníčková, and Tiffany Trump from his second marriage to Marla Maples. Melania had especially bonded with Tiffany, who was six when Melania began dating Tiffany&#x27;s father, and made sure she felt included among her half-siblings. When Melania herself became pregnant, it was widely covered in the media. This included her second appearance on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;, featuring her pregnant body in a bikini and an open coat. Melania spent the months with her sister and her parents, who visited throughout the pregnancy. She also oversaw the construction of a nursery in Trump Tower. She had a baby shower at the FAO Schwarz toy store, but she insisted that the toys and gifts she received be donated to a children&#x27;s hospital.
On March 20, 2006, Melania and Donald had a son, Barron William Trump. Melania chose her son&#x27;s middle name, while Donald chose his first name. Donald had previously used the name Barron as a pseudonym for when he posed as his own public relations agent. After Barron was born, Melania was active in his life and accordingly spent less time attending events with her husband. Donald had made it clear to her that if they had a child, he would not be actively involved in the child&#x27;s life. Melania later said she approved of this, stating that she &quot;didn&#x27;t want him changing diapers or putting Barron to bed&quot;. She avoided the use of nannies, with a few exceptions in Barron&#x27;s earliest years, insisting on raising him herself. This decreased social activity meant that Donald began courting supermodels again, which made Melania uncomfortable. According to biographer Mary Jordan, Melania did not know about the women who later alleged that they had extramarital affairs with him.

Melania stayed out of the public spotlight after she settled into her life as a Trump, excepting occasional charity work and an appearance in an Aflac commercial. She became a citizen of the United States on July 28, 2006. She then sponsored her parents using the &quot;chain migration&quot; immigration process that her husband later repeatedly criticized. Melania and Barron maintain dual citizenship, both in the United States and Slovenia. Spending most of her time at Trump residences, she rarely kept companions besides her parents and her son.

As her son reached childhood, Melania found herself with more time for other pursuits. She trademarked her name, Melania, in 2009 as a jewelry brand, which she used to sell less expensive jewelry pieces on QVC. She was intentional about not using the Trump name in her branding, correcting reporters who called it Melania Trump. She drew the designs herself, which were based on three places where she had lived: New York, Palm Beach, and Paris. Over the following years, she released additional &quot;Melania&quot; collections, and they sold out each time. Melania then developed a line of caviar-infused skincare products under the brand Melania Marks Skincare in 2011. The brand never launched. It brought about a legal case when the company selling the products, New Sunshine, underwent management changes and voided the contract. The company alleged that one executive had given a sweetheart deal to the Trumps because he was a family friend. The case was decided in Melania&#x27;s favor, and the amount to be paid to her was settled out of court. She had initially sued the company for $50 million in lost revenue.

== Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign ==
=== Personal life during the campaign ===
Melania was the one who finally convinced Donald to campaign for president in the 2016 presidential election, telling him that he either needed to do it or stop talking about it. When the campaign began, Melania made it clear to her husband that she would not be pressured into campaigning or attending events, and that she would only make appearances when she wanted to. She subsequently played a relatively small role in the campaign, which had been atypical of spouses of presidential candidates since the early 20th century. Explaining her absence, she cited the need to stay home with her son Barron. Her daily routine was nonetheless altered by the campaign, as she had to take security arrangements into account when she traveled, and she could not post about her activities online in real time. Once a prolific user of Instagram and Twitter, she became less active on her social media accounts when the campaign began.

While many people doubted Donald&#x27;s chances at the presidency, including his own inner circle, Melania believed he would win. Unlike Donald&#x27;s advisors, Melania encouraged him to follow his instincts and say what he felt he should say, with the exception that she does not like his use of profane language. She analyzed the campaign closely from home, following polling and watching how her husband interacted with his opponents. She spoke to him on the phone regularly throughout the campaign, including a conversation after each rally in which she gave a candid evaluation of how he did.

=== Campaign involvement ===
Melania&#x27;s career as a model was an advantage during the campaign, as she was prepared for photographers and did not need to hire a fashion consultant. As a model, she was required to be deliberate in all of her movement, including how she stood and walked. She resented being called shy during the campaign, saying that this was an impression spread by people who only briefly met her and wanted their &quot;15 minutes of fame&quot;. Melania&#x27;s earliest speaking appearances in November 2015 and February 2016 were prompted by Donald calling on her to speak to the crowd. Both times, she only said a few sentences. Her first scheduled speech during the campaign did not take place until April 2016.

The campaign reportedly wanted to get Melania more active, as she was in a unique position to humanize Donald and to appeal to the American Dream from an immigrant&#x27;s perspective. Hope Hicks was the campaign&#x27;s main liaison with Melania, facilitating any appearances that she wished to make. Melania trusted Hicks&#x27;s judgement and allowed her to weigh the importance of a given appearance. Her rare appearances brought her to swing states where her husband needed extra support, and her speeches celebrated his personal traits instead of policy.

Melania was involved in the vice presidential selection process, meeting with the top contenders, and her approval of Mike Pence contributed to his selection. The deciding factor, in her mind, was that Pence was not as ambitious as the other contenders and would not seek to undermine Donald.

=== Media coverage ===
An attack ad against the Trumps was produced by a super PAC that supported Donald&#x27;s opponent Ted Cruz featuring Melania&#x27;s nude &quot;GQ&quot; photo with the caption &quot;Meet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday&quot;, intensifying the rivalry between the two candidates in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries. More nude images of Melania were published on the front page of the &quot;New York Post&quot; in July 2016 in a story titled &quot;The Ogle Office&quot;. The images did not have a major effect on the campaign, as Melania was seen as the victim, but they were humiliating and she spent the following two months away from the public.

On July 18, 2016, Melania gave a speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention. A controversy emerged after it became apparent that a paragraph of the speech had been plagiarized from Michelle Obama&#x27;s speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. When asked about it, Melania said she wrote the speech herself &quot;with as little help as possible&quot;. Despite political campaigns typically having several people to scrutinize such speeches, no one in the Trump campaign had reviewed the speech. Donald was furious with his staff and felt he had failed Melania, while Melania felt she herself had failed the campaign through the scandal. It was the only major speech she delivered during the campaign. Two days later, Trump staff writer Meredith McIver took responsibility, saying there was a misunderstanding when Melania read passages of Obama&#x27;s speech as examples. The speech also included a rare statement on her past, describing her family in Slovenia and her early modeling career. After giving the speech, Melania stayed out of public view until election day approached.

=== &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape ===
On October 7, a month before the election, the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape was leaked. The tape had been recorded in 2005, shortly after their marriage, and it featured audio of Donald making controversial remarks about his treatment of women. Immediately after its release, the campaign&#x27;s primary concern was Melania&#x27;s reaction. It took Donald two hours before he went to see Melania. Upon their meeting, Melania reportedly told him &quot;Now you could lose, you could have blown this for us&quot;, and then left the room after he apologized. In 2024, her husband&#x27;s former personal counsel Michael Cohen testified during &quot;The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump&quot; trial that Donald had privately credited her as having suggested that the campaign&#x27;s response strategy should best characterize the conversation on the tape as .

Melania kept her distance from him, angry that he may have ended his candidacy with his comments, and she waited a day before making a comment. When asked by the campaign to make a scripted appearance alongside Donald as damage control, she refused, deciding that she was going to respond her own way. She also refused to sit beside him during his recorded apology as politicians&#x27; spouses often did in these situations. Melania released a statement saying that the tape did not show &quot;the man I know&quot; and said those who accused him of sexual misconduct are liars. Melania received significantly more attention from the press following the incident, and she was frustrated by the pity she received. A few days later, she attended a presidential debate wearing a pussy bow, causing widespread speculation about her intention (as her husband&#x27;s comments on the Access Hollywood tape had included, &quot;grab them by the pussy&quot;–with pussy being slang for vagina). After she voted, Melania spent most of election day with her parents in Trump Tower while the rest of the family did last minute campaigning.

== First tenure as First Lady of the United States (2017–2021) ==

=== First lady in Manhattan ===
After Donald&#x27;s inauguration as president on January 20, 2017, Melania announced that she would not move to Washington, D.C. with him, instead staying in Manhattan so Barron could finish the school year there. This also allowed her to introduce her son to the White House gradually so as not to overwhelm him. During this time, Melania negotiated new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald to reflect the changes in their lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron received a suitable inheritance.

Melania was the second foreign-born woman to hold the title of first lady after Louisa Adams, who was born in England, and Melania was the first naturalized citizen to hold the title. She has said that she can speak English, Italian, French, and German in addition to her native Slovene, but in public she has only spoken English and Slovene. She was also the second Catholic first lady of the United States, after Jacqueline Kennedy.

Melania&#x27;s absence from the White House caused speculation that her stepdaughter Ivanka would serve as an acting first lady. As time went by, members of the administration&#x27;s staff like her assistant, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, grew unhappy with Melania&#x27;s absence, as it gave the impression of marital issues and prevented her from exercising a calming influence over the president. She also stoked resentment among many of the people in New York, who predominantly opposed the Trumps, because of the costs and traffic issues caused by the Secret Service presence. The Secret Service itself also faced logistical issues from the repeated travel to New York. Having a Secret Service detail was not a major adjustment for Melania though, as she had spent years around her husband&#x27;s security team. She was given the Secret Service code name &quot;Muse&quot; to go along with the president&#x27;s name &quot;Mogul&quot;. Being first lady came with another drawback for Melania, as she was expected to speak on serious topics such as immigration policy and had little control over how her media appearances were handled, which was a different experience than she had as a model.

When the Trump administration&#x27;s White House website was posted, Melania&#x27;s biographical information caused controversy because it listed her jewelry business. Though it had already ceased operation, critics alleged that it was an attempt to promote her business with government resources. Another allegation of attempting to profit from her role as first lady came up in February, when she sued the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for libel after it alleged in 2016 that she had worked for an escort agency. The suit was initially for lost career opportunities, but this was changed to emotional distress when she received questions about why she expected to have career opportunities as first lady.

On March 8, 2017, Melania hosted her first White House event, a luncheon for International Women&#x27;s Day. She spoke to an audience of women about her life as a female immigrant and about working towards gender equality both domestically and abroad, noting the role of education as a tool against gender inequality. The Trumps visited Vatican City in May 2017. As Melania was visiting as a Catholic, Pope Francis blessed her rosary beads, and she placed flowers at the feet of a statue of the Madonna at the Vatican&#x27;s Bambino Gesù children&#x27;s hospital.

The first major public attention Melania received was after an incident in May 2017 while the Trumps were visiting Israel. Donald had forgotten that Melania was by his side when he was walking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and she fell behind from the group. Humiliated, she slapped away his hand when he reached out behind him to grab hers. This was the first time press coverage of Melania took notice of an independent streak.

=== East Wing staff ===
The lack of staff appointments in the East Wing during the first months of the Trump administration—typically the domain of the first lady—caused a backlog of tour requests to develop. In February several hires were made for the Office of the First Lady: Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd as social secretary, Lindsay Reynolds as the first lady&#x27;s chief of staff, Tham Kannalikham as her decorator, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff as the first lady&#x27;s assistant, and Stephanie Grisham as communications director. Melania retained the head florist appointed by Michelle Obama, Hedieh Ghaffarian. The chief usher appointed under the Obama administration, Angella Reid, was replaced by Trump International Hotel employee Timothy Harleth, breaking the norm of the chief usher serving under multiple presidencies. Reid had been broadly unpopular with the staff, and the firing earned Melania their goodwill.

The first lady&#x27;s staff remained small relative to those of her predecessors. This was in part because she did not want to have any employees speaking on her behalf. Instead, she answered her correspondences herself. Melania had a reputation in the White House for being &quot;drama-free&quot;, and for treating the staff well. According to her husband&#x27;s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, her staff had &quot;100 percent loyalty to her&quot;. Melania had a close, trusting relationship with her staff, and she was protective of them when conflict arose. Before moving in, Melania worked with Kannalikham to redecorate the White House, as first ladies typically do. She had most of the Obama-era decor replaced, and like the Obamas, the Trumps paid for it out of pocket instead of using the allotted funding.

=== Life in the White House ===
Melania and her son, Barron, moved into the White House on June 11, 2017. Like they had throughout their marriage, Melania and Donald chose to sleep in separate bedrooms. In her first year, Melania gave only eight speeches, compared to 74 by Michelle Obama and 42 by Laura Bush. Instead of frequent public appearances, she communicated her activities through video. Most of Melania&#x27;s appearances as first lady in 2017 were in Manhattan and Washington, and she typically spoke about women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s issues.

After moving to the White House, Melania opted to spend most of her time in the private quarters, running the White House staff from there instead of the first lady&#x27;s East Wing offices. She oversaw restorations of several rooms in the building, including the bowling alley in the White House basement and the first lady&#x27;s hairdresser&#x27;s room. She kept one office, called the &quot;swag room&quot; by aides, in which she kept trinkets she collected while she was first lady. To accommodate Barron&#x27;s soccer practice, she had a net installed on the White House grounds and had a coach practice with him. Barron remained Melania&#x27;s top priority when she was first lady, and she worked to keep him free from politics to the point that staffers referred to her as &quot;The Protector&quot;. Even after arriving at the White House, Melania spent extensive time away each year, visiting Mar-a-Lago on major holidays and over many weekends.Melania personally involved herself in decorations and planning within the White House. She was particular about how things were designed and arranged whenever events were planned, but she would take on a calm and relaxed demeanor once the event began. Whenever a foreign dignitary arrived at the White House, Melania had the Blue Room set aside where she ate lunch or drank tea with the dignitary&#x27;s spouse. When choosing which presidential china set to use, Melania often chose the Clinton administration china with its gold embroidery. She held events less frequently than her predecessors, with a typical week featuring three or fewer events, all under one hour long. Among her most ambitious projects was planning the White House Christmas decorations in 2018. Moving away from traditional designs, she filled the East Collonnade with red cranberry-laden trees set atop a green carpet. The design was widely derided, which Melania ascribed to personal taste.
To protect use of her image and maintain an income, Melania licensed photos from her photoshoots through Getty Images. This allowed her to choose how they were used by reporters, and she received royalties for each use. The Office of Government Ethics reported that she made $100,000 to $1,000,000 in royalties in 2017, though other estimates put it at over $10,000,000.

As one of her official duties, Melania was the honorary chair of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Because of political tension with the arts communities, she was not initially active in the role. She made her first appearances at the Kennedy Center in 2019. Trump unveiled the abstract sculpture &quot;Floor Frame&quot; by Isamu Noguchi in the White House Rose Garden in November 2020. She described it as &quot;embodying themes of resilience and renewal&quot; in her eponymous memoir.

=== Tribulations in early 2018 ===
A scandal broke in January 2018 when it was alleged that Donald had had an extramarital affair with the pornographic actress Stormy Daniels. The affair was said to have taken place in July 2006, after the Trumps&#x27; marriage and the birth of their son. Melania&#x27;s public appearances became more infrequent after the news emerged, and she canceled several events that she was to attend with her husband. This included the 2018 State of the Union Address, where Melania made the unprecedented decision to ride separately from him on the way there. Michael Cohen, who had arranged the silencing of the alleged affair, stated that his greatest regret was lying to Melania, saying that she didn&#x27;t deserve it. The next month, the story of a second affair in 2006 with the model Karen McDougal was made public. To Melania, the worst part was that she felt Donald had publicly humiliated her.Melania learned in April 2018 that she was afflicted with kidney disease, but she only told her parents, her husband, and her sister. On May 14, she began treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. While her husband had wished to join her, his presence would have risked the press discovering her condition. The official statement said that she underwent an embolization, a minimally invasive procedure that deliberately blocks a blood vessel. A statement was released after the procedure was finished without complication, and she recovered in the hospital over the following five days. The extended stay led to false rumors and conspiracy theories that she had gotten plastic surgery. After leaving the hospital, she continued to stay out of the public eye until the beginning of June. At this point, the president let slip that the surgery had been more serious than initially suggested.

Those around Melania noticed that she was generally happier by mid-2018. By this time, she had reached a more advantageous marital agreement that ensured Barron would be given a fair inheritance. Her public position, and the corresponding influence she had over her husband&#x27;s political career, had given her the advantage in negotiations. After several months of problems, Melania received positive coverage for a large custom-made white hat that she wore during a visit by French president Emmanuel Macron. On August 9, 2018, Melania&#x27;s parents were granted American citizenship. This revitalized accusations of hypocrisy by the Trumps regarding Melania&#x27;s parents, as Donald had spoken out against the chain migration process that allowed them to enter the United States.

=== 2018 Africa tour ===

In October 2018, Melania took a tour of Africa without Donald, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt. She spent much of her time with children in schools, orphanages, and hospitals. She used the trip to tout relief work being carried out by the United States Agency for International Development, which raised questions about her husband&#x27;s intention to cut its funding. Melania also received criticism for her fashion choices, where a photo opportunity in front of the Great Sphinx of Giza was seen as exploitive and a pith helmet she wore in Kenya was criticized for its association with colonialism in Africa. To these criticisms, she responded that people should pay more attention to her actions instead of her outfits. Perception of the trip grew worse when she responded to criticisms by saying that she was &quot;the most bullied person in the world&quot;.

Throughout Melania&#x27;s tour of Africa, personality conflicts took place between her team and Mira Ricardel, the deputy national security advisor. Ricardel&#x27;s staffer had been bumped from the first lady&#x27;s plane on the flight to Africa to make room for a journalist, and Ricardel subsequently became less cooperative with providing logistical information needed for the tour. Upon returning, Ricardel gave a thoroughly negative report on Melania&#x27;s staff, describing them as embarrassing the White House with their partying. Melania twice complained to the president, but no immediate action was taken. So the following month, the Office of the First Lady issued an official statement calling for Ricardel to be removed from her position. Publicly commenting on such a thing was unprecedented for a first lady. No one in the administration had been told in advance about the statement, including the president. Ricardel was fired the following day. A dispute over the trip arose between Melania and Ivanka a few months later when the latter made her own trip to the continent. Melania felt that in taking such a similar trip, Ivanka was intruding on the first lady&#x27;s role.

=== Political influence ===

Melania was the one person exempt from the criticism and distrust that Donald leveled against those around him in the White House. He held her opinion in high regard, often agreeing with her when she made it known, and he valued her loyalty as she did not seek public attention of her own. Melania believed that it was not her duty as first lady to take policy positions in her own right, but simply to advise Donald regarding his. She was the only person among those around him who could critique him directly without repercussion. Donald frequently asked for her opinion about issues he was considering or people who he interacted with, calling her over the phone when she was not in the same room.

Melania paid close attention to media coverage throughout Donald&#x27;s presidency, providing her input on what would make good optics and maintain his image. She also provided advice on how to pose for pictures and has given him suggestions on how to appear when moving. The nature of their relationship allowed Melania to overlook erratic behavior from Donald, as she had long believed that there was no use in trying to change someone&#x27;s personality, especially her husband&#x27;s.

 Melania had influence over her husband&#x27;s staff, and Donald sometimes fired individuals on her advice. The welfare of children is a subject of interest for her, and she routinely made visits to children&#x27;s hospitals throughout her tenure as first lady. According to her biographer Kate Bennett, interacting with children is one of the rare things that causes Melania to shift away from her usual stoic demeanor. Her advocacy was a major factor in her husband&#x27;s decision to ban fruit-flavored electronic cigarette cartridges. About one year into her tenure, Melania hired Reagan Thompson as a policy advisor, though she had yet to adopt any official initiatives at the time.

==== Family separation policy ====
Melania was openly critical of her husband&#x27;s &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy of denying asylum at the Mexico–United States border in 2018, where children were being separated from their parents. Her official position was that she hated to see families separated and hoped for successful immigration reform. Out of public view, she made her opposition clear to the president and influenced his decision to end it. Leaked tapes in 2020 featured Melania making statements defending some of the practices, expressing grief about family separation but questioning the validity of asylum claims and dismissing concerns that children were kept in substandard conditions.

Melania was upset when her stepdaughter Ivanka began receiving the credit for changing the president&#x27;s mind on the issue. Melania decided to visit the border herself, ignoring her husband&#x27;s worries about keeping media attention on the border and the Secret Service&#x27;s need of advance notice to plan her trip. She arrived at the border on June 21, where she visited the family separation facilities in Texas and attended a roundtable with doctors, medical staff, social workers, and other experts at Upbring New Hope Children&#x27;s Shelter. On the way to the border facility, she caused controversy by wearing a jacket that read, &quot;I really don&#x27;t care, do u?&quot; After much speculation about the jacket&#x27;s message, including criticism that she may have been expressing indifference toward the families separated at the border, Melania stated that the jacket was aimed at people and media who were criticizing her. The jacket dominated media coverage of her visit.

=== Be Best campaign ===
On May 7, 2018, Melania held a press conference in the White House Rose Garden to announce her official public initiative as first lady, the Be Best awareness campaign. The initiative was created to support the welfare of children, advocate against cyberbullying, and prevent opioid abuse. The initiative&#x27;s name drew ridicule in the press for its grammatical structure. Instead of creating new programs like previous first ladies&#x27; projects, Be Best promoted existing initiatives and organizations that worked toward the cause. Public awareness of the initiative remained low, and it was often regarded solely as an anti-cyberbullying campaign.

The Be Best campaign drew criticism for its perceived hypocrisy, challenging cyberbullying when her husband was well known for attacking people online. Even Donald had warned her before the campaign&#x27;s launch that the contrast may provoke criticism. She acknowledged the discrepancy but insisted that she would continue because she felt it was a good cause. This received more attention in 2019 when the president made Twitter posts critical of Greta Thunberg, a teenage environmental activist diagnosed on the autism spectrum. This came days after Melania had criticized Pamela Karlan for invoking Barron in a speech against the president. The first lady&#x27;s office responded that spouses can have different communication styles, and said that Barron was not &quot;an activist who travels the globe giving speeches&quot;.

=== COVID-19 and 2020 presidential campaign ===

Melania carried out a major reorganization of her staff in April 2020 in anticipation of her husband&#x27;s reelection campaign. She appointed Marcia Lee Kelly as her senior advisor and Emma Doyle as her policy advisor. Melania&#x27;s chief of staff, Lindsay Reynolds, was removed; her responsibilities went to Melania&#x27;s communications director, Stephanie Grisham. Melania became an active campaigner for her husband during the 2020 presidential election, which was a strong contrast to her 2016 activity.

When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Melania was criticized for promoting a White House renovation project. She took the topic more seriously after the COVID-19 lockdowns began, using her Twitter account to encourage social distancing during the pandemic and promote official medical advice. Much of what she posted directly contradicted what her husband posted, as he discouraged many of the recommended practices.

 On October 1, 2020, Melania&#x27;s former advisor Stephanie Winston Wolkoff released audiotapes that featured Melania making profane statements about her image and role as first lady. In the tapes, she condemned the media for not giving her positive coverage, questioned why people wanted her to speak out against her husband when she supported his policies, and expressed frustration with her responsibility to oversee Christmas decorations in the White House. She also mentioned her &quot;I really don&#x27;t care, do u&quot; jacket in the tapes, admitting that she wore it to irritate liberals. Winston Wolkoff had released the tapes alongside a tell-all book, &quot;Melania and Me&quot;. The Justice Department filed a civil suit against Winston Wolkoff in October 2019, alleging breach of a nondisclosure agreement, but it was dropped in February 2021 under the Biden administration. In September 2022, Melania said in an interview with &quot;Breitbart News&quot; that the audiotapes had been strategically edited to make people believe that her duties in the White House had been unimportant to her.

Despite Donald&#x27;s loss of the 2020 election, Melania ended her tenure by endorsing his false statement that he had been the legitimate election winner. For her final months in the White House, she stopped visiting her office in the East Wing and remained in the White House residence. Her focus at this time was on compiling photo albums of the decorations and renovations she had overseen through her tenure. Melania was managing photography at the White House when the January 6 United States Capitol attack took place and gave no comment at the time. She later said that she would have commented if she had been &quot;fully informed of all the details&quot;. Her communications director Stephanie Grisham later stated she had sent Melania a text message asking her to make a statement condemning the violence and resigned when that did not happen. On January 18, Melania released a farewell video asking the American people to uphold the principles of her Be Best campaign. She did not contact incoming first lady Jill Biden to make transition arrangements or provide her the traditional tour of the White House. She did, however, follow the tradition of leaving a letter for the incoming first lady.

== Between first lady tenures (2021–2025) ==
After the Trumps left the White House, Melania returned to Mar-a-Lago, where she could live while avoiding public attention. She retained one White House advisor, Marcia Lee Kelly, to help her during the post-presidency. Melania kept in contact with her successor Jill Biden, and the two have exchanged birthday cards. Since her first tenure as first lady ended, Melania made occasional paid speaking appearances, she founded a scholarship program for foster children, and she minted a line of Apollo 11–themed non-fungible tokens that were not in compliance with NASA&#x27;s image use policy. In November 2023, Melania attended the memorial service for former First Lady Rosalynn Carter.

Melania remained out of public view during her husband&#x27;s court appearances and his candidacy in the 2024 presidential election, limiting her campaign events to two fundraisers for the Log Cabin Republicans. She became more visible in July 2024 by putting out a statement following the attempted assassination of her husband and appearing at the 2024 Republican National Convention, though she declined an invitation to speak at the event, making her the first candidate&#x27;s spouse not to speak at the convention since Barbara Bush began the tradition. In the same month, Melania announced her intention to publish a memoir, titled &quot;Melania&quot;. She caused controversy among Republicans in the lead up to the book&#x27;s publication when she announced her support for the right to abortion. Donald won the election on November 5, 2024.

In January 2025, Amazon MGM Studios announced that it had licensed an upcoming documentary film on Melania directed by Brett Ratner for distribution in theatres and on Amazon Prime Video. She will also be an executive producer. Filming started in December 2024. Amazon reportedly paid US$40 million to license the documentary. Less than two weeks before assuming the role of first lady again, Melania attended the funeral for former President Jimmy Carter. On the eve of Donald&#x27;s inauguration as U.S. president, Melania launched her own cryptocurrency, the $Melania coin, following the debut of the $Trump coin.

== Second tenure as First Lady of the United States (2025–present) ==

On January 20, 2025, during the 60th United States presidential inauguration, Melania became the second first lady to hold the position two times non-consecutively, after Frances Cleveland. During the first few days of her second tenure as first lady, Melania traveled with President Trump to parts of North Carolina that were hit by Hurricane Helene in September 2024 and to Southern California to monitor the progress of fire rescue services for the January 2025 Southern California wildfires. In February 2025, Melania announced that public tours of the White House would resume on the 25th day of the month.

== Public image ==
Melania limits her interactions with the public, creating a public image heavily influenced by speculation. She worked to protect her privacy as first lady, and her staff was instructed not to answer any questions about her whereabouts at a given time. With limited information, commentators have portrayed her as being a reluctant companion to her husband or as a woman who has no independence of her own. Several incidents during her husband&#x27;s presidency led to rumors that she had a secret animosity toward her husband, such as her delay in moving to the White House and allegations that he had committed adultery. The rumors led to popular use of the hashtag #FreeMelania by those who believed them. Though she disliked the idea that people saw her as helpless, Melania found the campaign amusing. This became less common by 2020 as she had become more publicly associated with the role of first lady. She is often seen as cold by the public, though people who interact with her describe her as a warm presence.

As with previous first ladies, Melania&#x27;s fashion was heavily scrutinized, and particularly expensive pieces were criticized. More than other first ladies, her fashion was scrutinized in the context of her past as a fashion model and her marriage to a billionaire. She did her own clothes shopping, but she was assisted by designer Hervé Pierre, hair stylist Mordechai Alvow, and make up artist Nicole Byrl. When preparing for speeches, she dedicated more attention to her physical appearance than content or delivery, which her staff felt affected her ability to promote her causes. Despite her experience in fashion, she disliked that it was such a major aspect of news coverage about her as first lady.

Melania has been seen by the American public as the first foreigner first lady. The only other first lady to be born outside of the United States, Louisa Adams, had an American father. Having a Slovenian-born woman as the American first lady became a point of national pride in Slovenia, and it gave the nation a sense of recognition on the world stage. Melania&#x27;s hometown Sevnica has developed a small tourist industry around her, and Melania-themed merchandise was common during her tenure as first lady. These items never used Melania&#x27;s full name, substituting it with &quot;first lady&quot; or &quot;M&quot;, as she is protective of her personality rights.

During the 2016 presidential election, Melania became the only candidate&#x27;s spouse since polling began in 1988 to have a disapproval rating greater than their approval rating. Her approval rating stood at 36 or 37% in the months leading up to becoming first lady in January 2017, but it increased to 57% in a CNN poll in April 2018 after she received public sympathy amid allegations that her husband had committed adultery. Melania finished her tenure in 2021 as the least popular first lady since polling began with a rating of 42%. Multiple polls during her tenure as first lady showed her as the most popular member of the Trump family.

In December 2020, the Siena College Research Institute released a study surveying scholars and historians on their assessments of American first ladies. It was the fifth such first ladies study that the Institute had conducted since 1982, and the first in which Melania appeared. She was ranked as being the worst of 40 assessed American first ladies, receiving the lowest assessments in all of the metrics that were weighed.

<doc id="1209078" wikidata="Q106238533" url="?curid=1209078" title="Ability grouping">
<text>Ability grouping is the educational practice of grouping students by potential or past achievement for a relevant activity. Ability groups are usually small, informal groups formed within a single classroom. It differs from tracking by being less pervasive, involving much smaller groups, and by being more flexible and informal. 

In a mixed-ability classroom, ability groups allow the teacher to target review, direct instruction, and advanced work to the needs of a small group, rather than attempting to meet the divergent needs of the entire class simultaneously.

Assignment to an ability group is often short-term (never lasting longer than one school year), and varies by subject. Assignment to an ability group is made by (and can be changed at any time by) the individual teacher, and is usually not recorded in student records. For example, a teacher may divide a typical mixed-ability classroom into three groups for a mathematics lesson: those who need to review basic facts before proceeding with today&#x27;s lesson, those who are ready to learn new material, and those who need a challenging assignment. For the next lesson, the teacher may revert to whole-class, mixed-ability instruction, or may assign students to different groups. Such grouping may be very fluid and temporary, such as when elementary reading teachers place children into small reading groups whose members may change several times throughout the school year.

== Contrasted with tracking ==
Ability grouping is &quot;not&quot; synonymous with tracking. Tracking differs from ability grouping by scale, permanence, and what students learn. 

While a teacher could easily move an individual student from the &quot;red table&quot; to &quot;blue table&quot; ability group, tracking is a formal designation that often persists throughout a students&#x27; entire school career. In a tracking system, the entire student population is assigned to different classes, or even to different schools, according to their perceived academic potential. Tracked students attend all classes only with students whose overall academic achievement is the same as their own. Among younger students, a tracked school may teach the same underlying subjects, such as reading and mathematics, in different styles, speeds, or depth. Among older students, the students in different tracks are usually given the opportunity to learn only subjects that are deemed appropriate for their track. For example, a student in a &quot;university&quot; track is usually not permitted to study blue-collar vocational skills like welding.

Homogeneous grouping refers to grouping students solely with their academic peers, while heterogeneous grouping means that students are grouped with others of varying ability. Ability grouping can occur in either a heterogeneous or homogeneous classroom.

==Social effects==
Social stigma can be reduced by giving groups neutral names (e.g., colors, rather than &quot;advanced group&quot; or &quot;remedial group&quot;). Flexible group assignment and regular re-assignments reduces stigma.

==Application to high-ability students==
Rogers (2002) identifies the following as the most frequent forms of grouping for high-ability students:
* Whole class strategies:
** Full-time ability classes or tracks. These include special schools for the gifted, full-time gifted programs or classes, and the school-within-a-school approach.
** Untracked whole class instruction, the most common whole-class approach when others on this list are not utilized.
* Small group strategies:
** Gifted pull-outs
** Cluster grouping
** Subject-based ability grouping
** Within-class ability grouping
** Like-ability cooperative grouping
** Cross-grade grouping by achievement level
** Peer-tutoring dyads
** Mixed-ability cooperative grouping, the most small common group approach when others on this list are not utilized

<doc id="1209096" wikidata="Q3048711" url="?curid=1209096" title="Edward Tudor-Pole">
<text>Edward Felix Tudor-Pole (also known as Edward Tenpole; born 6 December 1954) is an English musician, television presenter and actor.

Originally gaining fame in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s as the lead singer of the punk rock band Tenpole Tudor, Tudor-Pole began an acting career following the group&#x27;s split in 1982. Outside of his music career Tudor-Pole is probably best known in the UK as the presenter of the game show &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; from 1993 to 1995 and in the US for his roles as Enaros in the 1997 fantasy film &quot;Kull the Conqueror&quot; and Mr Borgin in the Harry Potter film series.

==Personal life==
Tudor-Pole was born on 6 December 1954 in Lambeth, London, to David W. and Shirley C. (née Brown) Tudor-Pole. The family&#x27;s name derives from that of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk (great-grandson of Geoffrey Chaucer), via Tudor-Pole&#x27;s grandfather, spiritualist Wellesley Tudor Pole. Wellesley&#x27;s mother was a descendant of Welsh courtier Owen Tudor, and added the &#x27;Tudor&#x27; to her son&#x27;s name.

Tudor-Pole was educated at Pennthorpe School, Rudgwick, Sussex and King Edward&#x27;s School in Witley, Surrey. He later attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He lives in London and has one son. He was a keen motorcyclist for many years; his riding skills can be seen in the 1997 film &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, in which he played the lead role of Dodge.

==Musical career==
Tudor-Pole formed the band Tenpole Tudor in 1977, and eventually came to prominence after appearing in the film &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; as a possible replacement for Johnny Rotten in the Sex Pistols. He sang &quot;Who Killed Bambi?&quot;, &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; in the film and on the soundtrack. Tenpole Tudor returned in 1980, signing to Stiff Records and releasing two successful albums, &quot;Eddie, Old Bob, Dick and Gary&quot; and &quot;Let the Four Winds Blow&quot;. They had three hit singles, including UK Top 10 hit &quot;Swords of a Thousand Men&quot; which he performed on Top of the Pops in May 1981.

==Acting career==
Tudor-Pole has appeared in numerous films and plays, and was the presenter on &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;, replacing Richard O&#x27;Brien from 1993 until the show&#x27;s hiatus in 1995. He appeared in &quot;Between the Lines&quot; in 1992, playing a Liverpudlian villain. His film and play credits include &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; (written by his Crystal Maze predecessor), Jim Cartwright&#x27;s play &quot;Road&quot; at the &quot;Royal Court Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; (1980), &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (1986), &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot; (1988), &quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot; (1990) with Clint Eastwood, &quot;Princess Caraboo&quot; (1994), and several films by Alex Cox including &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; (1986), &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; (1987) and &quot;Walker&quot; (1987).

In &quot;Kull the Conqueror&quot; (1997) he played Enaros, the antagonist of the film. The following year he appeared as a slumlord in the film version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and as a blind man in Russell Mulcahy&#x27;s horror film &quot;Tale of the Mummy&quot;. He also was seen in &quot;Quills&quot; (2000), &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; (2004) as Spike Milligan, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Sister&quot; (2005), and in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (2007) as Mr Slipsby. Most recently he had a small part in an episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; entitled &quot;A Pocket Full of Rye&quot;, shown in 2009. His appearance in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002) as Mr Borgin, the owner of Borgin and Burke&#x27;s store, was cut from the theatrical release, but is included in the extended edition DVD. He also appeared as a ranting street preacher in season two of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

<text>Étang Saumâtre (), (English: &quot;brackish pond&quot;) is the largest lake in Haiti It is also known as Lake Azuéi (&quot;Lac Azuéi&quot;); its Taíno name was &quot;Yainagua&quot;.

Unlike its hypersaline neighbor, Étang Saumâtre is a brackish water lake. It lies east of Port-au-Prince on the fertile Plaine du Cul-de-Sac. The lake supports over 100 species of waterfowl, American flamingos (&quot;Phoenicopterus ruber&quot;), American crocodiles (&quot;Crocodylus acutus&quot;), and several other fauna found nowhere else in Haiti. The color of the lake is an intense shade of blue, and it is skirted by brush and cacti.

==Geography==
Étang Saumâtre is located on the arid part of the valley Cul-de-Sac, east of Port-au-Prince in the Ouest department. Its eastern side is part of the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; the Dominican city of Jimaní is less than 1 km from the southeast end of the lake.

The lake itself is part of a chain of nearby saline lakes that lie within the valley known as the Cul-de-Sac Depression in Haiti and the Hoya de Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic. Because the region was a former marine strait, several areas of the valley are below sea level. While the lake created in a depression is long and wide.

Étang Saumâtre is landlocked, as it has no surface outlet. It is fed by springs emanating from calcareous rocks. The western part of the lake has slightly saline water, while the eastern part has fresh water.

The lake has a length, from northwest to southeast, of ; its maximum width is . The total area is . The lake water has an elevation of with maximum water depth being . A sandy shore, shallow lagoons and mudflats form the eastern shore line, while the western shores have small fresh water springs and marshes. The eastern shore is state-owned, but parts of the western side of the lake are privately owned. Salinity of the lake water is now reported as 15‰ (parts per thousand). Lake water fluctuations are minimal, at about , except during the drought period, when the water level could go down by . Conversely, the water level rises about above the average during heavy rainfall years. The present assessment is that the level of the lake has been rising in recent years, forcing Haitians who live in plantation residential areas (&quot;bateyes&quot;) around the edge of the lake to seek higher ground.

Another inference drawn by a comparison between the two lakes – Azuéi and Enriquillo – which are in the same area and have the same origin is that though they are considered &quot;twins,&quot; they are two dissimilar bodies of water. Azuéi has a stable shore line, its waters are azure blue in colour, salinity level is low (11‰) and its surface area is relatively stable. However, Enriquillo&#x27;s water looks white-greyish in colour, its salinity levels are very high (they have risen from 36‰ to 110‰) and current water surface area ( compares to in 1968. The climatic conditions for both lakes are similar (low rainfall in the range of ), within similar geological setting.

Azuéi&#x27;s salinity is about one fifth (1/5) the salinity of sea water. A few small rivers flow into the lake.

==Fauna and flora==
The lake and its surrounding land are habitat for flora and fauna of several endemic species, including invertebrates, fishes and reptiles. This endemism is also common to the twin lakes, due to proximity and common history.

===Fauna===

The lake supports over 100 species of waterfowl (including flamingos), as well as American crocodiles; freshwater species of turtle, including the Hispaniolan slider (&quot;Trachemys decorata&quot;) and other reptiles, such as the rhinoceros iguana (&quot;Cyclura cornuta&quot;). Some fishes, such as tilapia, are also found. Its recognized importance is as a breeding, passage and wintering area for numerous bird species: as many as 300–400 breeding pairs of wading birds in the Ciconiiformes can be found in the eastern zone of the lagoon. Important avian raptor species of the lake include the osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;).

====American crocodiles====
American crocodiles are found in the lake, and have instilled fear among the local community. It is one factor responsible for the poor development of the lake as an ecotourism project. Extensive studies have been reported on this species of crocodile, as opposed to the Central American &quot;Crocodylus moreletii&quot; and the South American &quot;Crocodylus intermedius&quot;.

&quot;C. acutus&quot; is widely distributed in the coastal regions of the Neotropics; however, it is assumed to be surviving on the island of Hispaniola only in the saltwater lakes of Étang Saumâtre and Enriquillo. In 1984, there were estimated to be more than 400 individuals in and around Étang Saumâtre. It is also reported that this population is nearing extirpation, due to excessive hunting and poaching.

American crocodiles generally achieve a length of , though long or long specimens have been reported in Étang Saumâtre. The lake is known for the high concentration of crocodiles at 9.6/km in certain zones, with average density of 6.3/km for all crocodile size classes. The density varies in its habitat zones, over a distance of and length from the shore line. In the rocky shores, the density was reported to be 0.2/km. However, from from the shore line called the conocarpus fringe, the density was recorded as 14.5/km. They grow in size up to the age of 2 years when their size is in the range of . They are found in shallow water zones also and feed on cichlids (&quot;Nandopsis haitiensis&quot;). They remain mostly at the bottom of the lake and during bird nesting season they are found around a heron rookery to catch falling eggs of birds. Their foraging techniques vary from an active to a passive mode, and they forage on non-aquatic invertebrates and also odonate larvae. Birds and fish (Cichilidae) are the common items of their diet. Adults also eat domestic animals such as dogs and goats, and turtles. They nest in a stretch within a range of from the shoreline, of the uninhabited eastern lake shore, near charcoal-making sites and in coralliferous limestone outcrops.

====Aquatic fauna====
Aquatic fauna of the lake consists of small Poeciliidae (such as &quot;Gambusia dominicensis&quot;, Limia melanonotata and &quot;Limia nigrofasciata&quot;) and cichlids (&quot;Nandopsis haitiensis&quot;). In the past, 17,000 mirror carp fingerlings and 50,000 &quot;Tilapia mossambica&quot; fingerlings (a figure of 6,000 is also mentioned) were reportedly introduced to the lake. Fish productivity figures of the lake are not available. However, the actual catches are reported to be small, as fishing is done only on a small scale. Boats do not ply the lagoon; fishing methods are primitive and no nets are used. Ducks are hunted for food as well.

===Flora===
The lake is in the region of dry subtropical forest and hence the vegetation around the lake is sparse, with cacti and scrub-type shrubs. Typical vegetation consists of dry-forest plants endemic to the island of Hispaniola. They include trees, shrubs and cacti: caguey (&quot;Leptocereus paniculatus&quot;), melon espinoso (&quot;Melocactus lemairei&quot;), palo blanco (&quot;Croton poitaei&quot;), pitahaya (&quot;Harrisia nashii&quot;) and oreganillo (&quot;Lantana cifferiana&quot;).

The lagoon itself has several species of algae. In the fringes of the lake, &quot;Conocarpus erectus&quot; are reported and &quot;Typha domingensis&quot; are seen in the marshy region and fresh water streams and canals that have inlet into the lake. The lake has halophytic algae laid out as mattresses growing on its lake bed. Buttonwood mangroves trees have large growth in the periphery of the lake. These are felled extensively to make charcoal.

==Threats to the lake==
Deforestation and soil erosion have occurred and are occurring in the catchment of Lake Azuéi. Its water level has remained relatively stable. Increased levels of eutrophication in the form of increased growth of algae have been noted due to urban growth which is chiefly in Fonds Parisien. During heavy afternoon winds deposit periodically dropped or dumped plastics from the shore. Publicly taxed waste disposal and management rarely operate around the lake, an area which also has little law enforcement of minor littering.

==Conservation measures==
Haiti and the Dominican Republic and many international agencies are aware of the status of the two water bodies and the catchments drained by them. While Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic has become the first Dominican Ramsar Site and is also a national park since 1996, its twin lake, Etang Saumâtre has only been studied and is yet to receive the constructive attention for conservation of its American crocodiles and to promote ecotourism in general. However, a transboundary environmental program covering the watershed of the two lakes has been identified by the two governments to jointly initiate measures to improve the condition of the lakes and their respective catchments. This team, with professionals drawn from both countries, and with financial support from the European Union, could ensure that steps are taken to “create wise use practices for both lakes and their corresponding watersheds”.

<text>Nissim ben Jacob (), also known as Nissim Gaon (; 990–1062), was a rabbi and Gaon best known today for his Talmudic commentary ha-Mafteach, by which title he is also known.

==Biography==
Rav Nissim studied at the Kairouan Yeshiva, initially under his father, Jacob ben Nissim, who had studied under Hai ben Sherira and then Chushiel, who succeeded as head of the yeshiva. Nissim himself later became head of the yeshiva; in this capacity he is closely associated with Chananel ben Chushiel. His most famous student is probably Isaac Alfasi. Nissim maintained an active correspondence with Hai ben Sharira and with Samuel ibn Naghrillah, whose son Joseph married Nissim&#x27;s only daughter in 1049.

&lt;br&gt;



&lt;br&gt;

==Works==
The commentary &quot;Sefer mafteaḥ le-manʻ ūlei ha-talmūd &quot; (Hebrew: &quot;The book of the key to unlocking the Talmud&quot;; often, simply &quot;ha-Mafteach&quot;, (The Key), linked here) is essentially a Talmudic cross-reference. In it Rav Nissim identifies the sources for Mishnaic quotes, identifying obscure allusions to other places in Talmudic literature. He quotes from the Tosefta, Mekhilta, Sifre, Sifra, and from the Jerusalem Talmud, the explanations of which he sometimes prefers to those of the Babylonian Talmud. Nissim did not confine himself to quoting references, he also discusses these in connection with the text; this work is thus also a commentary. The work was written on several tractates, and is printed, in many editions, on the page itself.

Nissim also wrote other works, some of which have been lost, but which are quoted by later sages:
*&quot;Siddur Tefillah&quot;, a siddur (prayerbook)
*A commentary on the Torah (now lost)
*A &quot;Sefer ha-Mitzvot&quot; on the commandments (now lost)
* &quot;Hilkhot Lulav&quot; a polemic against the Karaites (now lost)
*&quot;Megillat Setarim&quot;: a collection of notes concerning halakhic decisions, explanations, and midrashim, primarily a note-book for the author&#x27;s private use, and published by his pupils probably not until after his death.
*A collection of tales, &quot;Sefer Ma&#x27;asiyyot ha-Hakhamim wehu Ḥibbur Yafeh meha-Yeshu&#x27;ah&quot;: about sixty tales, based upon the Mishnah, Baraita, the two Talmuds, and the midrashic writings; and written at the request of Nissim&#x27;s father-in-law, Dunash, on the loss of his son. This is translated into English as &quot;An Elegant Compilation concerning Relief after Adversity&quot; (Bibliography, below)

==Literary portrayals==
R. Nissim appears as a character in &quot;A Delightful Compendium of Consolation: A Fabulous Tale of Romance, Adventure and Faith in the Medieval Mediterranean&quot;, a novel by Burton Visotzky. The novel expands on the few known biographical facts (including the marriage of his daughter). Its title, &quot;A Delightful Compendium&quot;, derives from &quot;Ḥibbur Yafeh&quot;.

<text>Faithlift is a 1993 album by Canadian band Spirit of the West.

It is the band&#x27;s best-selling album, and includes their biggest Canadian Top 40 hit, &quot;And if Venice Is Sinking.&quot; The album peaked at #27 on &quot;RPM&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 albums chart the week of October 30, 1993.

Although &quot;Faithlift&quot; is one of the band&#x27;s rock albums, several songs (particularly &quot;Sadness Grows&quot; and &quot;Death on the Beach&quot;) retain the Celtic folk flavour that the band was previously known for.

The album includes many topical songs drawn from the news headlines: &quot;Bone of Contention&quot; mocks society&#x27;s hypocrisy in the Pee-Wee Herman controversy, &quot;Mum&#x27;s the Word&quot; is about the 1992 Giant Mine explosion, &quot;God&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; addresses the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal (which hit Canada several years earlier than it did the United States), and &quot;Guildhall Witness&quot; is about a race riot which the band encountered during its tour of England with The Wonder Stuff. &quot;6th Floor&quot; is about visiting Dallas and finding it impossible to resist going to see Dealey Plaza, the spot where John F. Kennedy was assassinated.

The album was reissued in 2008 on Rhino Records, concurrently with the release of the band&#x27;s career retrospective &quot;Spirituality 1983-2008: The Consummate Compendium&quot;.

<text>Real-time Multitasking eXecutive (iRMX) is a real-time operating system designed for use with the Intel 8080 and 8086 family of processors.

==Overview==
Intel developed iRMX in the 1970s and originally released RMX/80 in 1976 and RMX/86 in 1980 to support and create demand for their processors and Multibus system platforms.

The functional specification for RMX/86 was authored by Bruce Schafer and Miles Lewitt and was completed in the summer of 1978 soon after Intel relocated the entire Multibus business from Santa Clara, California to Aloha, Oregon. Schafer and Lewitt went on to each manage one of the two teams that developed the RMX/86 product for release on schedule in 1980.

Effective 2000 iRMX is supported, maintained, and licensed worldwide by TenAsys Corporation, under an exclusive licensing arrangement with Intel.

iRMX is a layered design: containing a kernel, nucleus, basic I/O system, extended I/O system and human interface. An installation need include only the components required: intertask synchronization, communication subsystems, a filesystem, extended memory management, command shell, etc. The native filesystem is specific to iRMX, but has many similarities to the original Unix (V6) filesystem, such as 14 character path name components, file nodes, sector lists, application readable directories, etc.

iRMX supports multiple processes (known as jobs in RMX parlance) and multiple threads are supported within each process (task). In addition, interrupt handlers and threads exist to run in response to hardware interrupts. Thus, iRMX is a multi-processing, multi-threaded, pre-emptive, real-time operating system (RTOS).

===Commands===
The following list of commands are supported by iRMX 86.
* ATTACHDEVICE
* ATTACHFILE
* BACKUP
* COPY
* CREATEDIR
* DATE
* DEBUG
* DELETE
* DETACHDEVICE
* DETACHFILE

===Historical uses===
iRMX III on Intel Multibus hardware is used in the majority core systems on CLSCS the London Underground Central line signals control system was supplied by Westinghouse (now Invensys) and commissioned in the late 1990s. The Central line is an automatic train operation line. Automatic train protection is by trackside and train borne equipment that does not use iRMX. It is the automatic train supervision elements that use a mix of iRMX on Multibus, and Solaris on SPARC computers. 16 iRMX local site computers are distributed along the Central line together with 6 central iRMX computers at the control centre. All 22 iRMX computers are dual redundant. iRMX CLSCS continues in full operation.

Oslo Metro uses a similar, although less complex, Westinghouse-supplied iRMX control system through the central Common Tunnel tracks. This was expected to be decommissioned in 2011.

==Variants==
Several variations of iRMX have been developed since its original introduction on the Intel 8080: iRMX I, II and III, iRMX-86, iRMX-286, DOS-RMX, iRMX for Windows, and, most recently, INtime. While many of the original variants of iRMX are still in use, only iRMX III, iRMX for Windows, and INtime are currently supported for the development of new real-time applications. Each of these three supported variants of iRMX require an Intel 80386 equivalent or higher processor to run.

A significant architectural difference between the INtime RTOS and all other iRMX variants is the support for address segments (see x86 memory segmentation). The original 8086 family of processors relied heavily on segment registers to overcome limitations associated with addressing &quot;large&quot; amounts of memory via 16-bit registers. The iRMX operating system and the compilers developed for iRMX include features to exploit the segmented addressing features of the original x86 architecture. The INtime variant of iRMX does not include explicit support for segmentation, opting instead to support only the simpler and more common 32-bit flat addressing scheme.

Despite the fact that native processes written for INtime can only operate using unsegmented flat-mode addressing, it is possible to port and run some older iRMX applications that use segmented addressing to the INtime kernel.

When Intel introduced the Intel 80386 processor, in addition to expanding the iRMX RTOS to support 32-bit registers, iRMX III also included support for the four distinct protection rings (named rings 0 through 3) which &quot;describe&quot; the protected-mode mechanism of the Intel 32-bit architecture. In practice very few systems have ever used more than rings 0 and 3 to implement protection schemes.

===iRMX===
The I, II, III, -286 and -86 variants are intended as standalone real-time operating systems. A number of development utilities and applications were made for iRMX, such as compilers (PL/M, Fortran, C), an editor (Aedit), process and data acquisition applications and so on. Cross compilers hosted on the VAX/VMS system were also made available by Intel. iRMX III is still supported today and has been used as the core technology for newer real-time virtualization RTOS products including iRMX for Windows and INtime.

===DOS-RMX===
DOS-RMX is a variant of the standalone iRMX operating system designed to allow two operating systems to share a single hardware platform. In simplest terms, DOS and iRMX operate concurrently on a single IBM PC compatible computer, where iRMX tasks (processes) have scheduling priority over the DOS kernel, interrupts, and applications. iRMX events (e.g., hardware interrupts) pre-empt the DOS kernel to ensure that tasks can respond to real-time events in a time-deterministic manner. In a functional sense, DOS-RMX is the predecessor to iRMX for Windows and INtime.

In practice, DOS-RMX appears as a Terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program to the DOS kernel. Once loaded as a TSR, iRMX takes over the CPU, changing to protected mode and running DOS in a virtual machine within an RMX task. This combination provides RMX real-time functionality as well as full DOS services.

===iRMX for Windows===
Like DOS-RMX, this system provides a hybrid mixture of services and capabilities defined by DOS, Windows, and iRMX. Inter-application communication via an enhanced Windows DDE capability allows RMX tasks to communicate with Windows processes.

iRMX for Windows was originally intended for use in combination with the 16-bit version of Windows. In 2002 iRMX for Windows was reintroduced by adding these RMX personalities to the INtime RTOS for Windows, allowing it to be used in conjunction with the 32-bit protected-mode versions of Windows (Windows NT, Windows 2000, etc.).

===INtime===
Like its iRMX predecessors, INtime is a real-time operating system. And, like DOS-RMX and iRMX for Windows, it runs concurrently with a general-purpose operating system on a single hardware platform. INtime 1.0 was originally introduced in 1997 in conjunction with the Windows NT operating system. Since then it has been upgraded to include support for all subsequent protected-mode Microsoft Windows platforms, including Windows Vista and Windows 7.

INtime can also be used as a stand-alone RTOS. INtime binaries are able to run unchanged when running on a &quot;stand-alone&quot; node of the INtime RTOS. Unlike Windows, INtime can run on an Intel 80386 or equivalent processor. Current versions of the Windows operating system generally require at least a Pentium level processor in order to boot and execute.

The introduction of INtime 3.0 included several important enhancements. Among them, support for multi-core processors and the ability to debug real-time processes on the INtime kernel using Microsoft Visual Studio. INtime is not an SMP operating system, thus support for multi-core processors is restricted to a special form of asymmetric multiprocessing. When used on a multi-core processor INtime can be configured to run on one CPU core while Windows runs on the remaining processor core(s).

===BOS===
Named BOS (BOS1810, BOS1820), the operating system was cloned by the East-German VEB Robotron-Projekt in Dresden in the 1980s.

<doc id="1209133" wikidata="Q836386" url="?curid=1209133" title="Orange Revolution">
<text>The Orange Revolution () was a series of protests that led to political upheaval in Ukraine from late November 2004 to January 2005. It gained momentum primarily due to the initiative of the general population, sparked by the aftermath of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election run-off which was claimed to be marred by massive corruption, voter intimidation and electoral fraud. Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was the focal point of the movement&#x27;s campaign of civil resistance, with thousands of protesters demonstrating daily. Nationwide, this was highlighted by a series of acts of civil disobedience, sit-ins, and general strikes organized by the opposition movement.

The protests were prompted by reports from several domestic and foreign election monitors as well as the widespread public perception that the results of the run-off vote of 21 November 2004 between leading candidates Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych were rigged by the authorities in favour of the latter. The nationwide protests succeeded when the results of the original run-off were annulled, and a revote was ordered by Ukraine&#x27;s Supreme Court for 26 December 2004. Under intense scrutiny by domestic and international observers, the second run-off was declared to be &quot;free and fair&quot;. The final results showed a clear victory for Yushchenko, who received about 52% of the vote, compared to Yanukovych&#x27;s 44%. Yushchenko was declared the official winner and with his inauguration on 23 January 2005 in Kyiv, the Orange Revolution ended. In the following years, the Orange Revolution had a negative connotation among pro-government circles in Belarus and Russia.

In the 2010 presidential election, Yanukovych became Yushchenko&#x27;s successor as President of Ukraine after the Central Election Commission and international observers declared that the presidential election was conducted fairly.

==Background==

===Gongadze assassination or Kuchmagate crisis===
Georgiy Gongadze, a Ukrainian journalist and the founder of &quot;Ukrayinska Pravda&quot; (a newspaper well known for publicising the corruption or unethical conduct of Ukrainian politicians), was kidnapped and murdered in 2000. Persistent rumours suggested that Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma had ordered the killing. Gen. Oleksiy Pukach, a former police officer, was accused of the murder under the orders of a former minister who committed suicide in 2005. Pukach was arrested in 2010 and was sentenced to life in prison in 2013. The murder sparked a movement against Kuchma in 2000 that may be seen as the origin of the Orange Revolution in 2004. After two terms of presidency (1994–1999) and the Cassette Scandal of 2000 that significantly damaged his image, Kuchma decided not to run for a third term in the 2004 elections and instead supported Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential race against Viktor Yushchenko of the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc.

===Causes of the Orange Revolution===
The state of Ukraine during the 2004 presidential election was considered to be in &quot;ideal condition&quot; for an outburst from the public. During this time, Ukrainians were impatient while waiting for the economic and political transformation. The results of the election were thought to be fraudulent.

The Revolution empowered many Ukrainians to take to the streets and participate in the protests, some lasting as long as seventeen days. The protests did not have national participation, but mostly was joined by western and central Ukrainians. Ukraine gained independence in 1991 and it was the quest for that independence that supported the Orange Revolution. Ukrainians for the most part did not want to be too closely associated with the past history of the Soviet Union. The Austro-Hungarian roots in the eastern European geo-cultural area of Ukraine (formerly known as Poland-Lithuania) helped shape the modern-day Ukrainian national identity.

=== Factors enabling the Orange Revolution ===
The Ukrainian regime prior to the Orange Revolution sought to create a path for democratization. Ukraine was considered a &quot;competitive authoritarian regime&quot; that is transitioning hybrid regime, allowing for room to fully transition into a liberal democracy, with a market based economy. The Ukrainian electorate sought to elect a candidate to bring economic and political reforms. Yushchenko quickly established himself as the leading candidate in calling for these reforms.

After a clear lack of faith in the government had been instilled in the Ukrainian population, Yushchenko&#x27;s role had never been more important to the revolution. Yushchenko was a charismatic candidate who showed no signs of being corrupt. Yushchenko was on the same level as his constituents and presented his ideas in a &quot;non-Soviet&quot; way. Young Ukrainian voters were extremely important to the outcome of the 2004 presidential election. This new wave of younger people born in a post-Soviet Ukraine had different views of the main figures in Ukraine. They were exposed to a lot of negativity from Kuchmagate and therefore had very skewed visions about Kuchma and his ability to lead their country.

The abundance of younger people who participated showed an increasing sense of nationalism that was developing in the country. The Orange Revolution had enough popular impact that it interested people of all ages.

===Visits of Vladimir Putin to Ukraine in 2004===

In 2004, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Ukraine numerous times.

==Prelude to the Orange Revolution==
=== Political alliances ===

In late 2002, Viktor Yushchenko (Our Ukraine), Oleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party of Ukraine), Petro Symonenko (Communist Party of Ukraine) and Yulia Tymoshenko (Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc) issued a joint statement concerning &quot;the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine&quot;. The communists left the alliance: Symonenko opposed the idea of a single candidate from the alliance in the Ukrainian presidential election of 2004; but the other three parties remained allies until July 2006. (In the autumn of 2001 both Tymoshenko and Yushchenko had broached the idea of setting up such a coalition.)

On 2 July 2004, Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc established the &quot;Force of the People&quot;, a coalition which aimed to stop &quot;the destructive process that has, as a result of the incumbent authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine&quot; – at the time President Kuchma and Prime Minister Yanukovych were the &quot;incumbent authorities&quot; in Ukraine. The pact included a promise by Viktor Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as Prime Minister if Yushchenko won the October 2004 presidential election.

=== 2004 Ukraine presidential election campaign ===
The 2004 presidential election in Ukraine eventually featured two main candidates:

* sitting Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, largely supported by Leonid Kuchma (the outgoing President who had already served two terms in office from 1994 and was precluded from running himself due to the term limits under the constitution)
* the opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko, leader of the Our Ukraine faction in the Ukrainian parliament and a former Prime Minister (in office 1999–2001)

The election took place in a highly charged atmosphere, with the Yanukovych team and the outgoing president&#x27;s administration using their control of the government and state apparatus for intimidation of Yushchenko and his supporters. In September 2004 Yushchenko suffered dioxin poisoning under mysterious circumstances. While he survived and returned to the campaign trail, the poisoning undermined his health and altered his appearance dramatically (his face remains disfigured by the consequences ).

The two main candidates were neck and neck in the first-round vote held on 31 October 2004, winning 39.32% (Yanukovych) and 39.87% (Yushchenko) of the votes cast. The candidates who came third and fourth collected much less: Oleksandr Moroz of the Socialist Party of Ukraine and Petro Symonenko of the Communist Party of Ukraine received 5.82% and 4.97%, respectively. Since no candidate had won more than 50% of the cast ballots, Ukrainian law mandated a run-off vote between two leading candidates. After the announcement of the run-off, Oleksandr Moroz threw his support behind Viktor Yushchenko. The Progressive Socialist Party&#x27;s Nataliya Vitrenko, who won 1.53% of the vote, endorsed Yanukovych, who hoped for Petro Symonenko&#x27;s endorsement but did not receive it.

In the wake of the first round of the election, many complaints emerged regarding voting irregularities in favour of the government-supported Yanukovych. However, as it was clear that neither nominee was close enough to collect an outright majority in the first round, challenging the initial result would not have affected the outcome of the round. So the complaints were not actively pursued and both candidates concentrated on the upcoming run-off, scheduled for 21 November.

Pora! activists were arrested in October 2004, but the release of many (reportedly on President Kuchma&#x27;s personal order) gave growing confidence to the opposition.

Yushchenko&#x27;s supporters originally adopted orange as the signifying colour of his election campaign. Later, the colour gave its name to an entire series of political labels, such as &quot;the Oranges&quot; (&quot;Pomaranchevi&quot; in Ukrainian) for his political camp and its supporters. At the time when the mass protests grew, and especially when they brought about political change in the country, the term &quot;Orange Revolution&quot; came to represent the entire series of events.

In view of the success of using colour as a symbol to mobilise supporters, the Yanukovych camp chose blue for themselves.

==Protests==
Protests began on the eve of the second round of voting, as the official count differed markedly from exit poll results which gave Yushchenko up to an 11% lead, while official results gave the election win to Yanukovych by 3%. While Yanukovych supporters have claimed that Yushchenko&#x27;s connections to the Ukrainian media explain this disparity, the Yushchenko team publicised evidence of many incidents of electoral fraud in favour of the government-backed Yanukovych, witnessed by many local and foreign observers. These accusations were reinforced by similar allegations, though at a lesser scale, during the first presidential run of 31 October. 

The Yushchenko campaign publicly called for protest on the dawn of election day, 21 November 2004, when allegations of fraud began to spread in the form of leaflets printed and distributed by the &#x27;Democratic Initiatives&#x27; foundation, announcing that Yushchenko had won – on the basis of its exit poll. Beginning on 22 November 2004, massive protests started in cities across Ukraine. The largest, in Kyiv&#x27;s Maidan Nezalezhnosti &quot;(Independence Square)&quot;, attracted an estimated 500,000 participants, who on 23 November 2004 peacefully marched in front of the headquarters of the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament, many wearing orange or carrying orange flags, the colour of Yushchenko&#x27;s campaign coalition. One of the most prominent activists of that time was Paraska Korolyuk, subsequently bestowed with the Order of Princess Olga. From 22 November Pora! undertook the management of the protests in Kyiv until the end of the demonstration.

The local councils in Kyiv, Lviv, and several other cities passed, with the wide popular support of their constituency, a largely symbolic refusal to accept the legitimacy of the official election results, and Yushchenko took a symbolic presidential oath. This &quot;oath&quot; taken by Yushchenko in half-empty parliament chambers, lacking the quorum as only the Yushchenko-leaning factions were present, could not have any legal effect. But it was an important symbolic gesture meant to demonstrate the resolve of the Yushchenko campaign not to accept the compromised election results. In response, Yushchenko&#x27;s opponents denounced him for taking an illegitimate oath, and even some of his moderate supporters were ambivalent about this act, while a more radical side of the Yushchenko camp demanded him to act even more decisively. Some observers argued that this symbolic presidential oath might have been useful to the Yushchenko camp should events have taken a more confrontational route. In such a scenario, this &quot;presidential oath&quot; Yushchenko took could be used to lend legitimacy to the claim that he, rather than his rival who tried to gain the presidency through alleged fraud, was a true commander-in-chief authorised to give orders to the military and security agencies.

At the same time, local officials in Eastern and Southern Ukraine, the stronghold of Viktor Yanukovych, started a series of actions alluding to the possibility of the breakup of Ukraine or an extra-constitutional federalisation of the country, should their candidate&#x27;s claimed victory not be recognised. Demonstrations of public support for Yanukovych were held throughout Eastern Ukraine and some of his supporters arrived in Kyiv. In Kyiv the pro-Yanukovych demonstrators were far outnumbered by Yushchenko supporters, whose ranks were continuously swelled by new arrivals from many regions of Ukraine. The scale of the demonstrations in Kyiv was unprecedented. By many estimates, on some days they drew up to one million people to the streets, in freezing weather.

In total 18.4% of Ukrainians have claimed to have taken part in the Orange Revolution (across Ukraine).

==Political developments==
Although Yushchenko entered into negotiations with outgoing President Kuchma in an effort to peacefully resolve the situation, the negotiations broke up on 24 November 2004. Yanukovych was officially certified as the victor by the Central Election Commission, which itself was allegedly involved in falsification of electoral results by withholding the information it was receiving from local districts and running a parallel illegal computer server to manipulate the results. The next morning after the certification took place, Yushchenko spoke to supporters in Kyiv, urging them to begin a series of mass protests, general strikes and sit-ins with the intent of crippling the government and forcing it to concede defeat.

In view of the threat of illegitimate government acceding to power, Yushchenko&#x27;s camp announced the creation of the &quot;Committee of National Salvation&quot; which declared a nationwide political strike.

On 1 December 2004, the Verkhovna Rada passed a resolution that strongly condemned pro-separatist and federalisation actions, and passed a non-confidence vote in the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, a decision Prime Minister Yanukovych refused to recognise. By the Constitution of Ukraine, the non-confidence vote mandated the government&#x27;s resignation, but the parliament had no means to enforce a resignation without the co-operation of Prime Minister Yanukovych and outgoing President Kuchma.

On 3 December 2004, Ukraine&#x27;s Supreme Court finally broke the political deadlock. The court decided that due to the scale of the electoral fraud it became impossible to establish the election results. Therefore, it invalidated the official results that would have given Yanukovych the presidency. As a resolution, the court ordered a revote of the run-off to be held on 26 December 2004. This decision was seen as a victory for the Yushchenko camp while Yanukovych and his supporters favoured a rerun of the entire election rather than just the run-off, as a second-best option if Yanukovych was not awarded the presidency. On 8 December 2004 the parliament amended laws to provide a legal framework for the new round of elections. The parliament also approved the changes to the Constitution, implementing a political reform backed by outgoing President Kuchma as a part of a political compromise between the acting authorities and opposition.

In November 2009 Yanukovych stated that although his victory in the election was &quot;taken away&quot;, he gave up this victory in order to avoid bloodshed. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want mothers to lose their children and wives their husbands. I didn&#x27;t want dead bodies from Kyiv to flow down the Dnipro. I didn&#x27;t want to assume power through bloodshed.&quot;

===Re-run election===
The 26 December revote was held under intense scrutiny by local and international observers. The preliminary results, announced by the Central Election Commission on 18 December, gave Yushchenko and Yanukovych 51.99% and 44.20% of the total vote, which represented a change in the vote by +5.39% to Yushchenko and −5.27% from Yanukovych respectively when compared to the November poll. The Yanukovych team attempted to mount a fierce legal challenge to the election results using both the Ukrainian courts and the Election Commission complaint procedures. However, all their complaints were dismissed as without merit by both the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the Central Election Commission. On 10 January 2005 the Election Commission officially declared Yushchenko as the winner of the presidential election with the final results falling within 0.01% of the preliminary ones. This Election Commission announcement cleared the way for Yushchenko&#x27;s inauguration as the President of Ukraine. The official ceremony took place in the Verkhovna Rada building on 23 January 2005 and was followed by the &quot;public inauguration&quot; of the newly sworn President at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (&quot;Independence Square&quot;) in front of hundreds of thousands of his supporters. This event brought the Ukrainian Orange Revolution to its peaceful conclusion.

==Role of Ukrainian intelligence and security agencies==
According to one version of events recounted by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ukrainian security agencies played an unusual role in the Orange Revolution, with a KGB successor agency in the former Soviet state providing qualified support to the political opposition. As per the paper report, on 28 November 2004 over 10,000 MVS (Internal Ministry) troops were mobilised to put down the protests in Independence Square in Kyiv by the order of their commander, Lt. Gen. Sergei Popkov. The SBU (Security Service of Ukraine, a successor to the KGB in Ukraine) warned opposition leaders of the crackdown. Oleksander Galaka, head of GUR (military intelligence) made calls to &quot;prevent bloodshed&quot;. Col. Gen. Ihor Smeshko (SBU chief) and Maj. Gen. Vitaly Romanchenko (military counter-intelligence chief) both claimed to have warned Popkov to pull back his troops, which he did, preventing bloodshed.

In addition to the desire to avoid bloodshed, the &quot;New York Times&quot; article suggests that &quot;siloviki&quot;, as the security officers are often called in the countries of the former Soviet Union, were motivated by personal aversion to the possibility of having to serve President Yanukovych, who was in his youth convicted of robbery and assault and had alleged connection with corrupt businessmen, especially if he were to ascend to the presidency by fraud. The personal feelings of Gen. Smeshko towards Yanukovych may also have played a role. Additional evidence of Yushchenko&#x27;s popularity and at least partial support among the SBU officers is shown by the fact that several embarrassing proofs of electoral fraud, including incriminating wiretap recordings of conversations among the Yanukovych campaign and government officials discussing how to rig the election, were provided to the Yushchenko camp. These conversations were likely recorded and provided to the opposition by sympathisers in the Ukrainian Security Services.

According to Abel Polese, Kuchma was concerned about its reputation in the West; because of a lack of natural resources to finance his regime he had to show a commitment to democracy in order to be targeted for Western financial assistance.

==U.S. involvement in the revolution==
In February 2004, an editorial &quot;A Chestnut Revolution&quot; appeared in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the author of which wrote that &quot;Ukraine offers the best chance to build on the Georgian success in popular democracy — as long as the West and the democratic opposition play their cards right&quot;. The note also says that the United States has already spent $2 billion to support a &quot;free and independent&quot; Ukraine and it would be better if this money went to support Kuchma&#x27;s democratic rivals, whose actions are inspired by Georgia and Serbia.

Adrian Karatnycky, a senior researcher at Freedom House, who was born in New York into a family of Ukrainian immigrants, has repeatedly traveled to Ukraine to meet with representatives of public groups, figures of the country&#x27;s political elite, as well as people from Viktor Yushchenko&#x27;s team. When opposition candidate Yushchenko visited New York, Karatnycky acted as a connector, organizing meetings with American associations, such as the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. A year before the elections, Karatnycky, together with NDI and Freedom House, gathered 1,023 observers from Central and Eastern Europe, who organized the &quot;European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations&quot;. Karatnycky himself took a direct part as an observer during the second round of the presidential elections and witnessed violations.

In August 2004, he took part in a training camp for Ukrainian activists; according to him, &quot;Croatians, Romanians, Slovakians, and Serbians – leaders of the group that led civic opposition to Milošević – taught Ukrainian kids how to ‘control the temperature’ of protesting crowds&quot;. Democratic activists were trained on how to resist government pressure, as well as establish communication with the public and the police. Karatnycky also served as president of Freedom House from 1996 to 2003 and executive director from 1993 to 1996, and in this position helped create a network of centers and public organizations in Ukraine engaged in monitoring the media and elections. On November 30, 2004, at the very beginning of the protests, Karatnycky stated in his speech at the Knickerbocker Club: &quot;I think the ‘orange revolution’ will win this time, and I can’t conceive of a set of circumstances under which Yushchenko won’t be president of the country&quot;.

In the two years before the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, the United States spent $65 million &quot;to aid political organizations in Ukraine, paying to bring opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko to meet U.S. leaders and helping to underwrite exit polls indicating he won a disputed runoff election.&quot; State Department spokesman Richard A. Boucher said that the U.S. money was not going to help a particular candidate, but to institutions that are necessary for free elections. Freedom House and the National Democratic Institute also funded civic groups that counted votes and announced exit poll results. In late November 2004, Senator Richard Lugar arrived in Kyiv as a representative of President George W. Bush and delivered a message to President Leonid Kuchma: &quot;you play a central role in ensuring that Ukraine’s election is democratic and free of fraud and manipulation. A tarnished election, however, will lead us to review our relations with Ukraine.&quot;

==Internet usage==
Throughout the demonstrations, Ukraine&#x27;s emerging Internet usage (facilitated by news sites that began to disseminate the Kuchma tapes) was an integral part of the orange revolutionary process. It has even been suggested that the Orange Revolution was the first example of an Internet-organised mass protest. Analysts believe that the Internet and mobile phones allowed an alternative media to flourish that was not subject to self-censorship or overt control by President Kuchma and his allies and pro-democracy activists (such as Pora!) were able to use mobile phones and the Internet to coordinate election monitoring and mass protests.

==2004 Ukrainian constitutional changes==

As part of the Orange Revolution, the Ukrainian constitution was changed to shift powers from the presidency to the parliament. This was Oleksandr Moroz&#x27;s price for his decisive role in winning Yushchenko the presidency. The Communists also supported these measures. These came into effect in 2006 during which Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions won the parliamentary election, creating a coalition government with the Socialists and the Communists under his leadership. As a result, President Viktor Yushchenko had to deal with a powerful Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych who had control of many important portfolios. His premiership ended in late 2007 after Yushchenko had succeeded in his months-long attempt to dissolve parliament. After the election, Yanukovych&#x27;s party again was the largest, but Tymoshenko&#x27;s finished far ahead of Yushchenko&#x27;s for second place. The Orange parties won a very narrow majority, permitting a new government under Tymoshenko, but Yushchenko&#x27;s political decline continued to his poor showing in the 2010 presidential election.

On 1 October 2010, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine overturned the 2004 amendments, considering them unconstitutional.

==2010 presidential election==
A Circuit administrative court in Kyiv forbade mass actions at Maidan Nezalezhnosti from 9 January 2010 to 5 February 2010. The Mayor&#x27;s office had requested this in order to avoid &quot;nonstandard situations&quot; during the aftermath of the 2010 presidential election. Apparently (in particular) the Party of Regions, All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot; and Svoboda had applied for a permit to demonstrate there. Incumbent President Viktor Yushchenko got a dismal 5.45% of votes during the election.
&quot;Ukraine is a European democratic country&quot;, said Yushchenko in a sort of political will at the polling station. &quot;It is a free nation and free people.&quot; According to him, this is one of the great achievements of the Orange Revolution.

In the 2010 presidential election Viktor Yanukovych was declared the winner which was labeled by some Yanukovych supporters as &quot;an end to this Orange nightmare&quot;. Immediately after his election Yanukovych promised to &quot;clear the debris of misunderstanding and old problems that emerged during the years of the Orange power&quot;. According to influential Party of Regions member Rinat Akhmetov the ideals of the Orange Revolution won at the 2010 election &quot;We had a fair and democratic independent election. The entire world recognised it, and international observers confirmed its results. That&#x27;s why the ideals of the Orange Revolution won&quot;. According to Yulia Tymoshenko the 2010 elections were a missed &quot;chance to become a worthy member of the European family and to put an end to the rule of the oligarchy&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
President Viktor Yushchenko decreed in 2005 that 22 November (the starting day of the Orange Revolution) will be a non-public holiday &quot;Day of Freedom&quot;. This date was moved to 22 January (and merged with Unification Day) by President Viktor Yanukovych late December 2011. President Yanukovych stated he moved &quot;Day of Freedom&quot; because of &quot;numerous appeals from the public&quot;.

Outright vote rigging diminished after the 2004 presidential election. No officials involved in the 2004 elections that preceded the Orange Revolution were convicted for election fraud.

A 2007 study revealed that opinion about the nature of the Orange Revolution had barely shifted since 2004 and that the attitudes about it in the country remained divided along the same largely geographical lines that it had been at the time of the revolution (West and Central Ukraine being more positive about the events and South and Eastern Ukraine more cynical (seniors also). This research also showed that Ukrainians in total had a less positive view on the Orange Revolution in 2007 than they had in 2005. It has been suggested that since the Orange Revolution was impactful enough to interest people of all ages it increased the overall unity of Ukraine.

During the elections campaign of the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election the Party of Regions&#x27; campaign focused heavily on (what they called) &quot;the chaos and ruins of 5 years of orange leadership&quot;.

===Outside Ukraine===

In March 2005 Ukrainian Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk stated that Ukraine would not be exporting revolution.

During Alexander Lukashenko&#x27;s inauguration (ceremony) as President of Belarus of 22 January 2011 Lukashenko vowed that Belarus would never have its own version of the Orange Revolution and Georgia&#x27;s 2003 Rose Revolution. In the aftermath of the 2011 South Ossetian presidential election (in December 2011) and during the protests following the 2011 Russian elections (also in December 2011) the Ambassador of South Ossetia to the Russian Federation Dmitry Medoyev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Putin&#x27;s supporters named the Orange Revolution an infamous foreknowledge for their countries. Putin also claimed that the organisers of the Russian protests in December 2011 were former (Russian) advisors to Yushchenko during his presidency and were transferring the Orange Revolution to Russia. A 4 February 2012 rally in favor of Putin was named the &quot;anti-Orange protest&quot;. In 2013 a Russian State Duma Oleg Nilov and former fellow Russian politician Sergey Glazyev referred to political adversaries as &quot;different personalities in some sort of orange or bright shorts&quot; and &quot;diplomats and bureaucrats that appeared after the years of the &#x27;orange&#x27; hysteria&quot;. In 2016 the Russian newspaper Izvestia claimed, &quot;in Central Asia weak regimes are already being attacked by extremists and &#x27;Orange Revolutions&#x27;.&quot;

In Russian nationalist circles the Orange Revolution has been linked with fascism because, albeit marginally, Ukrainian nationalist extreme right-wing groups and Ukrainian Americans (including Viktor Yushchenko&#x27;s wife, Kateryna Yushchenko, who was born in the United States) were involved in the demonstrations; Russian nationalist groups see both as branches of the same tree of fascism. The involvement of Ukrainian Americans led them to believe the Orange Revolution was steered by the CIA.

In a televised meeting with military bloggers on 13 June 2023 Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that, the winner of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, Viktor Yushchenko had come to power with the help of a coup d&#x27;etat, which &quot;at least took place in a relatively peaceful way.&quot;

The series was executive produced by Sydney Pollack and produced by Steve Golin and others. The theme song was written by Elmer Bernstein and the original music was written by Peter Bernstein.

Each episode is based on a story by a noted hardboiled crime writer, including Raymond Chandler, Jim Thompson, Cornell Woolrich, James Ellroy, Evan Hunter, Mickey Spillane, Dashiell Hammett and Walter Mosley.

Period torch songs by performers like Patti Page and Billie Holiday were used periodically.

In Europe, the show is known as Perfect Crimes and shown in France on Canal +, and in the United Kingdom.

==Reception==
When it debuted, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; received mixed to critical notices. In his review for the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, Scott Williams wrote, &quot;We&#x27;re asking a lot of TV to deliver entertainment about that stylish, moral abyss. &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; delivers. It lets us look over the edge and measure our souls against the darkness&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the series two out of four stars and Ginny Holbert wrote, &quot;Part of the problem is the series&#x27; arch, self-conscious obsession with style. Instead of a &#x27;90s interpretation of film noir, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; offers contrived, full-color cliche noir, replete with cocked fedoras, plumes of curling smoke and harsh sunlight sliced by venetian blinds&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John J. O&#x27;Connor called it, &quot;uneven but diverting, even when just hovering around film-school level&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, Louis B. Parks wrote, &quot;The big problem with film noir homages is they usually overdo the ingredients, with none of the subtlety of the great originals. &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; has a touch of that. But the directors and actors play straight, and the adaptations, taken from the real McCoy writers, are pretty good stuff&quot;. 

In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Tom Shales wrote, &quot;Creating period pieces out of their period seems to be fairly easy now for the gifted artisans of Hollywood. Even by today&#x27;s commonplace high standards, however, the look and feel of the six &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; films seem transportingly authentic and sensuous, stylized in ways that evoke the milieu without spoofing it. Occasionally, the films veer into the arch and ridiculous, but overall, they at least look darn good&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Gates wrote, &quot;no show this summer will do a better job of whisking you away from the increasingly unacceptable &#x27;90s. These half hours are all too short&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, &quot;One unintended result of all this happy, naughty cigarette-puffing, however, is that, at their weakest, these films look like the work of boys (and don&#x27;t be fooled, this is a boys&#x27; fantasy production) dressed up in their dads&#x27; big suits&quot;.

==Home media==
In the United States the first season was released in a two volume VHS set. The second season was released in Europe (DVD region 2) in 1999 and Australia (DVD region 4) under the title &quot;Perfect Crimes&quot;.

==Other media==
Grove Press released a companion book, &quot;Six Noir Tales Told for Television,&quot; (1993) with all the original stories and the screenplays from the first season. A soundtrack was also released.

<text>Typhoon Gay, also known as the Kavali Cyclone of 1989, was a small but powerful tropical cyclone which caused more than 800 fatalities in and around the Gulf of Thailand in November 1989. The worst typhoon to affect the Malay Peninsula in thirty-five years, Gay originated from a monsoon trough over the Gulf of Thailand in early November. Owing to favorable atmospheric conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining winds over 120 km/h (75 mph) by 3 November. Later that day, Gay became the first typhoon since 1891 to make landfall in Thailand, striking Chumphon Province with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). The small storm emerged into the Bay of Bengal and gradually reorganized over the following days as it approached southeastern India. On 8 November, Gay attained its peak intensity as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). The cyclone then moved ashore near Kavali, Andhra Pradesh. Rapid weakening ensued inland, and Gay dissipated over Maharashtra early on 10 November.

The typhoon&#x27;s rapid development took hundreds of vessels by surprise, leading to 275 offshore fatalities. Of these, 91 occurred after an oil drilling ship, the &quot;Seacrest&quot;, capsized amid swells. Across the Malay Peninsula, 588 people died from various storm-related incidents. Several towns in coastal Chumphon were destroyed. Losses throughout Thailand totaled (). Striking India as a powerful cyclone, Gay damaged or destroyed about 20,000 homes in Andhra Pradesh, leaving 100,000 people homeless. In that country, 69 deaths and () in damage were attributed to Gay.

==Meteorological history==

In early November, a monsoon trough over the Gulf of Thailand showed signs of tropical cyclogenesis. A small, concentrated area of convection quickly developed over a low-pressure area within the trough, and on 2 November the system became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Owing to its small size, the system began strengthening within the narrow gulf by taking advantage of warm waters and good outflow. Moving generally northwestward, it became a tropical depression later that day and underwent rapid intensification. As the newly named Tropical Storm Gay strengthened, it &quot;presented a paradox to forecasters&quot;, according to Lieutenant Dianne K. Crittenden; synoptic data from Malaysia and Thailand indicated decreasing wind speeds and increasing barometric pressures around the storm, but these observations were later interpreted as increased subsidence.

Strengthening faster than anticipated, Gay attained typhoon status early on 3 November. Later that day, the storm developed an eye before passing over the &quot;Seacrest&quot;, an oil drilling ship. On 4 November, Gay&#x27;s winds increased to 185 km/h (115 mph), equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, before making landfall in Chumphon Province, Thailand, at 0600 UTC. The Japan Meteorological Agency assessed that the storm had ten-minute sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and a pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg). Crossing the Kra Isthmus, Gay weakened to minimal typhoon status as it entered the Bay of Bengal. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gay was the first typhoon since 1891 to form in the Gulf of Thailand and enter the Bay of Bengal. Responding to a ridge to its north, Gay maintained a west-northwestward to northwestward track for the next four days. The storm gradually restrengthened as it moved through an area of low wind shear and warm waters; however, this was limited by restrictions to the cyclone&#x27;s outflow. Early on 6 November, Gay passed near the Andaman Islands as a Category 2-equivalent cyclone.
After changing little in intensity for much of 6 November, Gay strengthened as the ridge to its north intensified and the previous restrictions to its outflow diminished. The storm moved due west through a small fetch of warmer waters, fueling the process of intensification over the next 42 hours. Based on estimates provided through the use of the Dvorak technique, the JTWC assessed Gay to have attained its peak intensity as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) early on 8 November. Around this time, the IMD estimated that the storm had three-minute sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph), classifying Gay as a modern-day super cyclonic storm. Additionally, the agency estimated the cyclone&#x27;s central pressure to have decreased to 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). Around 1800 UTC, Gay made landfall over a sparsely populated area near Kavali, India, in Andhra Pradesh. Upon coming ashore, the storm&#x27;s eye was about 20 km (12 mi) wide, with gale-force winds within 95 km (60 mi) of the center. Now over land, Gay no longer had access to warm waters, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm less than twelve hours after this landfall. The storm continued to deteriorate while moving across India, before it completely dissipated over Maharashtra on 10 November.

==Impact and aftermath==
===Gulf of Thailand===

The most powerful storm to affect the Gulf of Thailand in more than thirty-five years, Gay produced swells which caught many ships in the region off-guard. At least 16 vessels were reported missing by 5 November, including the Unocal Corporation oil drilling ship &quot;Seacrest&quot;. According to survivors, the vessel received no warning of the developing typhoon. Just when all crew members were about to abandon ship, the eye passed over. Winds fluctuated violently and changed direction, preventing the ship from remaining stabilized despite being within safe operating limits. The vessel abruptly capsized with all 97 crew members on board during the overnight hours of 3 November, before any life boats could be deployed. Initial rescue attempts on 4 November were hampered by rough seas. Two days after the sinking, four rescue ships and two helicopters in the region were searching for survivors; four people were rescued from the wreckage on 6 November. Divers from the Thai Navy were sent to search the capsized vessel for anyone trapped inside. Of the crew, only six survived; 25 bodies were recovered, and the remaining 66 members were presumed dead. Losses from the sinking of the &quot;Seacrest&quot; totaled $40 million. Another 20 cargo and fishing ships sank during the storm, resulting in 140 fatalities.

===Thailand===

Striking Thailand with unprecedented strength, Typhoon Gay caused catastrophic damage across many of its provinces. Areas between Chumphon and Rayong provinces were severely affected by heavy rains, high winds and large swells. Rainfall amounts peaked at Chumphon, where fell during the cyclone&#x27;s passage. Widespread disruption of communication and electricity occurred in most areas south of Bangkok; many households remained without power for weeks. Damaging winds uprooted numerous trees and power poles and toppled wooden houses built on stilts. Exacerbated by deforestation, flash flooding triggered by the storm damaged or destroyed thousands of homes and caused at least 365 fatalities. Several towns and villages across Chumphon province were devastated, and one of the destroyed villages &quot;looked like it had been bombed&quot; according to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;. Entire districts were reportedly &quot;flattened&quot; in Chumphon and Prachuap Khiri Khan provinces. The typhoon destroyed many schools across Chumphon and Surat Thani provinces, many of which were constructed of wood. All structures close to the storm&#x27;s path had their windows and doors blown out, and some multi-story buildings lost their upper floors. A few schools constructed from reinforced concrete sustained little damage. More than a thousand roads and 194 bridges were damaged or washed away. At the height of the floods, over of land was under water. Onshore, 558 fatalities were attributed to the storm, and another 44 died just offshore. Throughout Thailand, approximately 47,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and more than 200,000 people were affected, of which about 153,000 were left homeless. Monetary losses reached 11 billion baht (US$456.5 million), ranking Gay as one of the costliest disasters in the country&#x27;s history.

Within a week of the storm&#x27;s passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing relief goods to residents throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying the impact of the typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32 percent to 30.53 percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96 percent to 13.03 percent.

Following post-storm surveys, it was determined that most of the severely damaged schools had been built improperlybuilding codes in Thailand mandate that structures withstand up to 120 kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies determined how best to rebuild: reinforced concrete structures which can last fifty years.

===India===

After crossing the Malay Peninsula, Gay moved through the Andaman Islands on 6 November. As a precautionary measure, all air and sea traffic were suspended to the region. Winds in excess of 120 km/h (75 mph) battered North Andaman Island, causing two structures to collapse. A few days before the cyclone made landfall, officials in Andhra Pradesh began evacuating roughly 50,000 residents along the coast and stockpiled relief goods. Some people were forced to leave vulnerable locations in the Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts. Local meteorologists warned that the storm was comparable to a cyclone in 1977 that killed more than ten thousand. Striking the southern coast of Andhra Pradesh, Gay produced wind gusts estimated at 230 km/h (145 mph). Along the coast, a storm surge of inundated areas up to inland, washing away numerous structures. About outside of Kavali, a tall, steel lattice microwave tower collapsed after experiencing winds estimated at 142 km/h (88 mph). Transportation and communication across the region was disrupted and 20,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving at least 100,000 people homeless. Nearly every structure in Annagaripalem were severely damaged or destroyed. Offshore, 25 fishermen drowned near Machilipatnam after ignoring warnings to return to port. Throughout Andhra Pradesh, 69 fatalities and () worth of damage was attributed to Gay. In the months after the storm, concrete shelters were built to house displaced persons.

<text>John Sullivan, (10 April 1830 – 28 June 1884) was a sailor in the Royal Navy and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Royal Navy==
Sullivan was 25 years old, and a boatswain&#x27;s mate in the Royal Navy, serving in the Naval Brigade during the Crimean War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 10 April 1855 at Sebastopol, in Crimea, Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Sullivan, as captain of one of the guns at Greenhill Battery, volunteered to place a flagstaff on a mound to act as an aiming point. He carried out this dangerous task undeterred by continuous fire from enemy sharpshooters, and his action enabled the battery to open fire on hitherto concealed enemy guns which were doing great damage to some of the advanced works.

Sullivan later achieved the rank of chief boatswain&#x27;s mate. He committed suicide at Kinsale, County Cork, on 28 June 1884.

<doc id="1209178" wikidata="Q193216" url="?curid=1209178" title="Trachoma">
<text>Trachoma is an infectious disease caused by bacterium &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;. The infection causes a roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids. This roughening can lead to pain in the eyes, breakdown of the outer surface or cornea of the eyes, and eventual blindness. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections can result in a form of permanent blindness when the eyelids turn inward.
The bacteria that cause the disease can be spread by both direct and indirect contact with an affected person&#x27;s eyes or nose. Indirect contact includes through clothing or flies that have come into contact with an affected person&#x27;s eyes or nose. Children spread the disease more often than adults. Poor sanitation, crowded living conditions, and insufficient clean water and toilets also increase spread.
Efforts to prevent the disease include improving access to clean water and treatment with antibiotics to decrease the number of people infected with the bacterium. This may include treating, all at once, whole groups of people in whom the disease is known to be common. Washing, by itself, is not enough to prevent disease, but may be useful with other measures. Treatment options include oral azithromycin and topical tetracycline. Azithromycin is preferred because it can be used as a single oral dose. After scarring of the eyelid has occurred, surgery may be required to correct the position of the eyelashes and prevent blindness.
Globally, about 80 million people have an active infection. In some areas, infections may be present in as many as 60–90% of children. Among adults, it more commonly affects women than men – likely due to their closer contact with children. The disease is the cause of decreased vision in 2.2 million people, of whom 1.2 million are completely blind. Trachoma is a public health problem in 42 countries across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. There are 136.9 million people at risk. It results in US$8 billion of economic losses a year. It belongs to a group of diseases known as neglected tropical diseases.

==Signs and symptoms==

The bacterium has an incubation period of 5 to 10 days, after which the affected individual experiences symptoms of conjunctivitis, or irritation similar to &quot;pink eye&quot;. Blinding endemic trachoma results from multiple episodes of reinfection that maintains the intense inflammation in the conjunctiva. Without reinfection, the inflammation gradually subsides.

The conjunctival inflammation is called &quot;active trachoma&quot; and is usually seen in children, especially those in preschool. It is characterized by white lumps in the undersurface of the upper eyelid (conjunctival follicles or lymphoid germinal centers) and by nonspecific inflammation and thickening, often associated with papillae. Follicles may also appear at the junction of the cornea and the sclera (limbal follicles). Active trachoma can often be irritating and have a watery discharge. Bacterial secondary infection may occur and cause a discharge of pus.

The later structural changes of trachoma are referred to as &quot;cicatricial trachoma&quot;. These include scarring under the eyelid (tarsal conjunctiva) that leads to distortion of the eyelid with buckling of the lid (tarsus) so the lashes rub against the eye (trichiasis). This can lead to corneal opacities and scarring and then to blindness. Linear scars present in the sulcus subtarsalis are called Arlt&#x27;s lines (named after Carl Ferdinand von Arlt). In addition, blood vessels and scar tissue can invade the upper cornea (pannus). Resolved limbal follicles may leave small gaps in the pannus (Herbert&#x27;s pits).

Most commonly, children with active trachoma do not present with symptoms, as the low-grade irritation and ocular discharge are just accepted as normal, but further symptoms may include:
* Eye discharge
* Swollen eyelids
* Trichiasis (misaligned eyelashes)
* Swelling of lymph nodes in front of the ears
* Sensitivity to bright lights
* Increased heart rate
* Further ear, nose, and throat complications.
The most important complication to look out for is a corneal ulcer, which is caused by intense rubbing of the affected eye, or trichiasis with a superimposed bacterial infection.

== Cause ==
Trachoma is caused by &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;, serotypes (serovars) A, B, and C. It is spread by direct contact with eye, nose, and throat secretions from affected individuals, or contact with fomites (inanimate objects that carry infectious agents), such as towels and/or washcloths, that have had similar contact with these secretions. Flies can also be a route of mechanical transmission. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections result in entropion (the inward turning of the eyelids), which may result in blindness due to damage to the cornea. Children are the most susceptible to infection due to their tendency to get dirty easily, but the blinding effects or more severe symptoms are often not felt until adulthood.

Blinding endemic trachoma occurs in areas with poor personal and family hygiene. Many factors are indirectly linked to the presence of trachoma including lack of water, absence of latrines or toilets, poverty in general, flies, close proximity to cattle, and crowding. The final common pathway, though, seems to be the presence of dirty faces in children, facilitating the frequent exchange of infected ocular discharge from one child&#x27;s face to another. Most transmission of trachoma occurs within the family.

==Diagnosis==

===McCallan&#x27;s classification===
McCallan in 1908 divided the clinical course of trachoma into four stages:
===WHO classification===
The World Health Organization recommends a simplified grading system for trachoma. The Simplified WHO Grading System is summarized below:

Trachomatous inflammation, follicular (TF)—Five or more follicles of &gt;0.5 mm on the upper tarsal conjunctiva

Trachomatous inflammation, intense (TI)—Papillary hypertrophy and inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva obscuring more than half the deep tarsal vessels

Trachomatous scarring (TS)—Presence of scarring in tarsal conjunctiva.

Trachomatous trichiasis (TT)—At least one ingrown eyelash touching the globe, or evidence of epilation (eyelash removal)

Corneal opacity (CO)—Corneal opacity blurring part of the pupil margin

==Prevention==
Although trachoma was eliminated from much of the developed world in the 20th century (Australia being a notable exception), this disease persists in many parts of the developing world, particularly in communities without adequate access to water and sanitation. It is grouped as a neglected tropical disease which is a target for preventive chemotherapy.

===Environmental measures===
Environmental improvement: Modifications in water use, fly control, latrine use, health education, and proximity to domesticated animals have all been proposed to reduce transmission of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot;. These changes pose numerous challenges for implementation. These environmental changes are likely to ultimately affect the transmission of ocular infection through a lack of facial cleanliness. Particular attention is required for environmental factors that limit clean faces.

A systematic review examining the effectiveness of environmental sanitary measures on the prevalence of active trachoma in endemic areas showed that the use of insecticide spray resulted in significant reductions of trachoma and fly density in some studies. Health education also resulted in reductions of active trachoma when implemented. Improved water supply did not result in a reduction of trachoma incidence.

===Antibiotics===
WHO Guidelines recommend that a region should receive community-based, mass antibiotic treatment when the prevalence of active trachoma among one- to nine-year-old children is greater than 10%. Subsequent annual treatment should be administered for three years, at which time the prevalence should be reassessed. Annual treatment should continue until the prevalence drops below 5%. At lower prevalences, antibiotic treatment should be family-based.

==Management==

===Antibiotics===
Azithromycin (single oral dose of 20 mg/kg) or topical tetracycline (1% eye ointment twice a day for six weeks). Azithromycin is preferred because it is used as a single oral dose. Although it is expensive, it is generally used as part of the international donation program organized by Pfizer. Azithromycin can be used in children from the age of six months and in pregnancy. As a community-based antibiotic treatment, some evidence suggests that oral azithromycin was more effective than topical tetracycline, but no consistent evidence supported either oral or topical antibiotics as being more effective. Antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of active trachoma in individuals infected with chlamydial trachomatis.

===Surgery===
For individuals with trichiasis, a bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure is warranted to direct the lashes away from the globe. Evidence suggests that the use of a lid clamp and absorbable sutures would result in reduced lid contour abnormalities and granuloma formulation after surgery. Early intervention is beneficial as the rate of recurrence is higher in more advanced diseases.

===Lifestyle measures===

The WHO-recommended SAFE strategy includes:
* Surgery to correct advanced stages of the disease
* Antibiotics to treat active infection, using azithromycin
* Facial cleanliness to reduce disease transmission
* Environmental change to increase access to clean water and improve sanitation

Children with visible nasal discharge, discharge from the eyes, or flies on their faces are at least twice as likely to have active trachoma as children with clean faces. Intensive community-based health education programs to promote face-washing can reduce the rates of active trachoma, especially intense trachoma. If an individual is already infected, washing one&#x27;s face is encouraged, especially a child, to prevent reinfection. Some evidence shows that washing the face combined with topical tetracycline might be more effective in reducing severe trachoma compared to topical tetracycline alone. The same trial found no statistical benefit of eye washing alone or in combination with tetracycline eye drops in reducing follicular trachoma amongst children.

==Prognosis==
If not treated properly with oral antibiotics, the symptoms may escalate and cause blindness, which is the result of ulceration and consequent scarring of the cornea. Surgery may also be necessary to fix eyelid deformities.

Without intervention, trachoma keeps families in a cycle of poverty, as the disease and its long-term effects are passed from one generation to the next.

==Epidemiology==

As of 2011, about 21 million people are actively affected by trachoma, with around 2.2 million people being permanently blind or have severe visual impairment from trachoma. An additional 7.3 million people are reported to have trichiasis. As of June 2022, 125 million individuals live in trachoma endemic areas and are at risk of trachoma-related blindness, and the disease is a public health problem in 42 countries. Of these, Africa is considered the worst affected area, with over 85% of all known active cases of trachoma. Within the continent, South Sudan and Ethiopia have the highest prevalence. In many of these communities, women are three times more likely than men to be blinded by the disease, likely due to their roles as caregivers in the family. Australia is the only developed country that has trachoma. In 2008, trachoma was found in half of Australia&#x27;s very remote communities.

===Elimination===
In 1996, the WHO launched its Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020, and in 2006, the WHO officially set 2020 as the target to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem. The International Coalition for Trachoma Control has produced maps and a strategic plan called 2020 INSight that lays out actions and milestones to achieve global elimination of blinding trachoma by 2020. The program recommends the SAFE protocol for blindness prevention: Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics to clear infection, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement to reduce transmission. This includes sanitation infrastructure to reduce the open presence of human feces that can breed flies.

As of 2018, Cambodia, Ghana, Iran, Laos, Mexico, Nepal, Morocco, and Oman have been certified as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem; China, Gambia, Iran, Iraq, and Myanmar made that claim, but have not sought certification. Eradication of the bacterium that causes the disease is seen as impractical; the WHO definition of &quot;eliminated as a public health problem&quot; means less than 5% of children have any symptoms, and less than 0.1% of adults have vision loss. Having already donated more doses (about 700 million since 2002) of the drug than it has sold during the same period, the drug company Pfizer has agreed to donate azithromycin until 2025, if necessary, for the elimination of the disease. The campaign unexpectedly found the distribution of azithromycin to very poor children reduced their early death rate by up to 25%.

==History==
The disease is one of the earliest known eye afflictions, having been identified in Egypt as early as 15 BCE.

Its presence was also recorded in ancient China and Mesopotamia. Trachoma became a problem as people moved into crowded settlements or towns where hygiene was poor. It became a particular problem in Europe in the 19th century. After the Egyptian Campaign (1798–1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1798–1815), trachoma was rampant in the army barracks of Europe and spread to those living in towns as troops returned home. Stringent control measures were introduced, and by the early 20th century, trachoma was essentially controlled in Europe, although cases were reported until the 1950s. Today, most victims of trachoma live in underdeveloped and poverty-stricken countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control says, &quot;No national or international surveillance [for trachoma] exists. Blindness due to trachoma has been eliminated from the United States. The last cases were found among Native American populations and in Appalachia, and those in the boxing, wrestling, and sawmill industries (prolonged exposure to combinations of sweat and sawdust often led to the disease). In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, trachoma was the main reason for an immigrant coming through Ellis Island to be deported.&quot;

In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed an act designating funds for the eradication of the disease. Immigrants who attempted to enter the U.S. through Ellis Island, New York, had to be checked for trachoma. During this time, treatment for the disease was by topical application of copper sulfate. By the late 1930s, several ophthalmologists reported success in treating trachoma with sulfonamide antibiotics. In 1948, Vincent Tabone (who was later to become the President of Malta) was entrusted with the supervision of a campaign in Malta to treat trachoma using sulfonamide tablets and drops.

Due to improved sanitation and overall living conditions, trachoma virtually disappeared from the industrialized world by the 1950s, though it continues to plague the developing world to this day. Epidemiological studies were conducted in 1956–1963 by the Trachoma Control Pilot Project in India under the Indian Council for Medical Research. This potentially blinding disease remains endemic in the poorest regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East and in some parts of Latin America and Australia. Currently, 8 million people are visually impaired as a result of trachoma, and 41 million have an active infection.

Of the 54 countries that the WHO cited as still having blinding trachoma occurring, Australia is the only developed country—Australian Aboriginal people who live in remote communities with inadequate sanitation are still blinded by this infectious eye disease.

India&#x27;s Health and Family Welfare Minister JP Nadda declared India free of infective trachoma in 2017.

===Etymology===
The term is derived from Neo-Latin , from Greek τράχωμα , from τραχύς &quot;&quot; &quot;rough&quot;.

== Economics ==
The economic burden of trachoma is huge, particularly concerning covering treatment costs and productivity losses as a result of increased visual impairment, and in some cases, permanent blindness. The global estimated cost of trachoma is reported between $US2.9 and 5.3 billion each year. By including the cost of trichiasis treatment, the estimated overall cost for the disease increases to about $US 8 billion.

<doc id="1209179" wikidata="Q558904" url="?curid=1209179" title="Heller (coin)">
<text>The Heller, abbreviation hlr, was a coin, originally valued at half a pfennig, that was issued in Switzerland and states of the Holy Roman Empire, surviving in some European countries until the 20th century.

It was first recorded in 1200 or 1208 or, according to Reiner Hausherr as early as 1189. The &quot;hellers&quot; were gradually so debased that they were no longer silver coins. There were 576 &quot;hellers&quot; in a &quot;Reichsthaler&quot; (&quot;imperial &quot;thaler&quot;). After the Second World War, &quot;hellers&quot; only survived in Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

The &quot;heller&quot; also existed as a silver unit of weight equal to of a &quot;Mark&quot;.

Notgeld (emergency paper money) was issued in Germany, Austria and Liechtenstein during the interwar period denominated in hellers.

== Name ==
The &quot;Heller&quot;, also called the Haller or Häller (), in Latin sources: &quot;denarius hallensis&quot; or &quot;hallensis denarius&quot;, took its name from the city of Hall am Kocher (today Schwäbisch Hall). Silver coins stamped on both sides (&quot;Häller Pfennige&quot;) were called &quot;Händelheller&quot; because they usually depicted a hand. A distinction was made between white, red and black &quot;hellers&quot;.

== Germany ==

=== Overview ===
Mints produced the coin from the beginning of the 13th century, based on a previously produced silver pfennig (Häller Pfennig, sometimes called &quot;Händelheller&quot; for its depiction of a hand on the front face), but its composition deteriorated with the mixing in copper little by little so that it was no longer considered to be a silver coin. There were red, white and black Hellers. Beginning in the Middle Ages it became a symbol of low worth, and a common German byword is &quot;keinen (roten) Heller wert&quot;&quot;, lit.: not worth a (red) Heller, or &quot;not worth a red cent&quot;.

The term &quot;Heller&quot; came into wide use as a name for coins of small value throughout many of the German states up to 1873 when, after German unification, Bismarck&#x27;s administration introduced the Mark and the pfennig as coinage throughout the German Empire.

=== History ===
In Swabia the &quot;Heller&quot; originally corresponded to the &quot;Pfennig&quot;, so that there were 240 &quot;Heller&quot; in a Carolingian pound. However, by an imperial edict of 1385, the value of the &quot;Heller&quot; was halved, resulting in 8 &quot;Hellers&quot; = 4 &quot;Pfennigs&quot; = 1 &quot;Kreuzer&quot; and 4 &quot;Kreuzer&quot; = 1 &quot;Batzen&quot;

Due to the low value and the non-standard quality of these coins, it was common in the High and Late Middle Ages to weigh large amounts of &quot;Hellers&quot; and to transact business based on the total coin weight; this often resulted in purchase amounts in &quot;pound &quot;hellers&quot;&quot;, which did not necessarily correspond to the Carolingian pound of 240 &quot;hellers&quot;.

In what was then Bohemian Upper Lusatia, the cities Bautzen and Görlitz had the right to mint coins. In the 15th century they coined alternately every year. The Görlitz Heller (&quot;Katterfinken&quot;) was a coin whose silver content decreased more and more in later years.

For example, around 1490, the House of Wettin&#x27;s silver &quot;pfennig&quot; currency was: 24 &quot;hellers&quot; = 12 &quot;pfennigs&quot; = 2 half &quot;Schwertpfennigs&quot; = 1 &quot;Spitzpfennig&quot; = 1 &quot;Bartpfennig&quot; or &quot;Zinspfennig&quot;. The &quot;hellers&quot; were hollow and called &quot;Hohlhellers&quot;, similar to the Thuringian &quot;Hohlpfennigs&quot;.

In Electoral Saxony, low-value &quot;Besselpfennigs&quot; circulated as &quot;invaders&quot;. They were referred to as &quot;Näpfchenheller&quot; in Saxon documents from 1668. In some areas of Saxony, for example in the Ore Mountains, they became a nuisance. The population preferred to throw the lower value &quot;Näpfchenhellers&quot; into the collection bag, which significantly reduced income from the collection. This led, for example, in Annaberg to the introduction of special church &quot;pfennigs&quot; (&quot;Kirchenpfennige&quot;).

In the Electorate of Hesse, the silver &quot;groschen&quot; was divided into 12 &quot;hellers&quot;, so that the &quot;heller&quot; was equal to the Prussian &quot;pfennig&quot;. &quot;Dreiheller&quot; were copper 1 &quot;pfennig&quot; pieces that were minted in Saxe-Gotha.

With the transition to a standard imperial currency of &quot;marks&quot; and &quot;pfennigs&quot; under the Coinage Act of 9 July 1873, the &quot;heller&quot; disappeared like all other old currency units (except for the simple &quot;Vereinstaler&quot;, which circulated until 1907). Only the &quot;last Bavarian Heller&quot; of the former guilder standard were still valid in Bavaria for a considerable time after 1878 as pf coins of the new Goldmark imperial currency.
=== German East Africa ===

The German &quot;heller&quot; was resurrected in 1904 when the government took over responsibility for the currency of German East Africa from the German East Africa Company. The &quot;heller&quot; was introduced as 1/100 of a rupie instead of the pesa, which had been a 1/64 of a rupie up to that time. 

In the 1920s the &quot;Heller&quot; currency was expanded to greater denominations in the German territories and printed bills were produced to represent their value for trade. Coins valued at , 1, 5, 10 and 20 &quot;hellers&quot; were minted.

== Austria-Hungary ==
In Austria-Hungary, &quot;Heller&quot; was also the term used in the Austrian half of the empire for 1/100 of the Austro-Hungarian krone (the other being fillér in the Hungarian half), the currency from 1892 until after the demise (1918) of the Empire.
== Czech Republic and Slovakia ==
The term &quot;heller&quot; (, ) was also used for a coin valued at 1/100 of a &quot;koruna&quot; (crown) in the Czech Republic (Czech koruna) and Slovakia (Slovak koruna), as well as in former Czechoslovakia (Czechoslovak koruna).

Only the currency of the Czech Republic continues to use &quot;hellers&quot; (&quot;haléře&quot;), although they survive only as a means of calculation — the Czech National Bank removed the coins themselves from circulation in 2008 and notionally replaced them with rounding to the next koruna.

== Liechtenstein ==

In Liechtenstein, emergency money was in circulation from 1919 to 1924. The denominations were based on the &quot;heller&quot;.

== Switzerland ==
In the late Middle Ages, the &quot;haller&quot; was the lowest denomination coin in the area of the Swiss Confederation and corresponded to half a &quot;pfennig&quot;. From the 1320s, the first south German &quot;haller&quot; made its way to northern Switzerland, where it replaced the production of small, one-sided &quot;pfennigs&quot;, which were now known as &quot;haller&quot;.

This &quot;haller&quot; established itself as a basic unit in the city-state of Zurich and in the princely Abbey of St. Gallen from 1370 onwards. As the name of an increasingly devalued coin, the &quot;haller&quot; existed nominally until the end of the 18th century.

== In culture ==
&quot;Ein Heller und ein Batzen&quot; is a well-known student and soldier&#x27;s song by Albert von Schlippenbach (lyrics) and Franz Kugler (music).

The German idiom &quot;Das ist keinen roten Heller wert&quot; – &quot;that&#x27;s not worth a red &quot;heller&quot;&quot; – goes back to the coin&#x27;s low value and means that something is worthless. Others include &quot;eine Schuld auf Heller und Pfennig begleichen&quot; (&quot;to settle a debt to the last &quot;heller&quot; and &quot;pfennig&quot;&quot; i.e. to settle a debt in full), &quot;seinen letzten Heller verlieren&quot; (&quot;to lose your last &quot;heller&quot;&quot;) and &quot;keinen roten Heller haben&quot; (&quot;to not have a red &quot;heller&quot;&quot; i.e. penniless).

On the A 33 motorway north of the Wünnenberg-Haaren interchange is the motorway services station of &quot;Letzter Heller&quot; (&quot;Last Heller&quot;). In earlier times there was an inn nearby. After the residents of the surrounding villages had done their shopping in Paderborn and returned to their villages on foot, they paused halfway at the inn and &quot;spent their last &quot;heller&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="1209183" wikidata="Q732737" url="?curid=1209183" title="Colobinae">
<text>The Colobinae or leaf-eating monkeys are a subfamily of the Old World monkey family that includes 61 species in 11 genera, including the black-and-white colobus, the large-nosed proboscis monkey, and the gray langurs. Some classifications split the colobine monkeys into two tribes, while others split them into three groups. Both classifications put the three African genera &quot;Colobus&quot;, &quot;Piliocolobus&quot;, and &quot;Procolobus&quot; in one group; these genera are distinct in that they have stub thumbs (Greek κολοβός &quot;kolobós&quot; = &quot;docked&quot;). The various Asian genera are placed into another one or two groups. Analysis of mtDNA confirms the Asian species form two distinct groups, one of langurs and the other of the &quot;odd-nosed&quot; species, but are inconsistent as to the relationships of the gray langurs; some studies suggest that the gray langurs are not closely related to either of these groups, while others place them firmly within the langur group.

== Characteristics ==
Colobines are medium-sized primates with long tails (except for the pig-tailed langur) and diverse colorations. The coloring of nearly all young animals differs remarkably from that of the adults.

Most species are arboreal, although some live a more terrestrial life. They are found in many different habitats of different climate zones (rainforests, mangroves, mountain forests, and savannah), but not in deserts and other dry areas. They live in groups, but in social forms vary.

Colobines are folivorous, though their diet may be supplemented with flowers, fruits and the occasional insect. To aid in digestion, particularly of hard-to-digest leaves, they have multichambered, complex stomachs, making them the only primates with foregut fermentation. Foregut fermenters use bacteria to detoxify plant compounds before reaching the intestine, where toxins can be absorbed. Foregut fermentation is also associated with higher protein extraction and efficient digestion of fiber; it is the dominant form of digestions in diverse herbivore taxa, including most Artiodactyla (e.g., deer, cattle, antelope), sloths, and kangaroos. In contrast, lower diversity howler monkeys in the New World rely on hindgut fermentation – occurring lower in the colon or cecum – much like horses and elephants. Unlike the other subfamily of Old World monkeys, the Cercopithecinae, they do not possess cheek pouches.

In the silvery lutung (&quot;Trachypithecus cristatus&quot;) and the Northern plains gray langur (&quot;Semnopithecus entellus&quot;) females begin reproducing after around 3 years of age.

== Classification and evolution ==
Colobinae is split into two tribes: Colobini, found in Africa, and Presbytini, found in Asia. Based on fossil records, the tribes split between 10 and 13 million years ago. The Colobini tribe contains three genera, black-and-white colobuses, red colobuses, and the olive colobus, all of whom are found in Africa. The Asian Presbytini comprises seven genera split into two clades, the odd-nosed group and the langur group. The discordant gene tree topologies and divergence age estimates suggest that hybridization, particularly involving female introgression from &quot;Piliocolobus&quot;/&quot;Procolobus&quot; into &quot;Colobus&quot; and male introgression from &quot;Semnopithecus&quot; into &quot;Trachypithecus&quot;, played a prominent role in shaping the phylogenetic relationships of African and Asian colobine monkeys during their evolutionary history.

The earliest remains of Colobinae are known from the Tugen Hills of Kenya, dating to 12.5 million years ago. The earliest fossils of the genus in Eurasia are those of &quot;Mesopithecus&quot; found in Greece, dating to around 8.2 million years ago.

<doc id="1209190" wikidata="Q1052650" url="?curid=1209190" title="Royal train">
<text>A royal train is a set of railway carriages dedicated for the use of the king or other members of a royal family. Most monarchies with a railway system employ a set of royal carriages. If the monarch is an emperor the proper term is imperial train.

==Australia==

The various government railway operators of Australia have operated a number of royal trains for members of the royal family on their numerous tours of the country.

==Austria-Hungary==

The imperial and royal court used the &quot;k.u.k. Hofsalonzug&quot; (Imperial and Royal Court Saloon Train). Various versions existed under the rule of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Many of the cars were built by Ringhoffer in Bohemia. The cars were operated and maintained by the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways. Two cars have survived, one is the dining car kept at the Technical Museum in Prague, and the other is the car of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, which is kept at the Technical Museum in Vienna.

==Belgium==
===Historic use===
Some of the historic royal coaches are still preserved, two of which are on display at the Train World museum at Schaerbeek. From the royal coaches that served for King Leopold II and King Albert I are preserved the three most important royal coaches. From the royal coaches that served for King Leopold III and King Baudouin the following are preserved: the drawing room coach (with private rest compartment for the king), the dining coach (with big and private dining compartment and kitchen) and the sleeping coach for the king and queen (with small drawing room, sleeping compartments, bathing compartments with bathtub and compartments for the staff).

===Modern use (from 2000)===
For rail transport during visits of heads of state to Belgium, there is a possibility of using a first-class SNCB I11 coach with seats partially removed and a set of armchairs put in the middle of the coach. This arrangement was used for the first time on 30 May 2002 during the state visit of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, for a trip from Bruges to Brussels-South, and a second time during the state visit of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands on 22 June 2006 for a trip from Schaerbeek to Liège-Guillemins.

In October 2019 the royal family used a converted 1st class train to visit Luxembourg. They departed from the Brussels-Luxembourg railway station, to not hinder the busy train network around Brussels.

==Canada==

Royal trains have been employed to transport members of the Canadian royal family on numerous tours prior to the 1960s, after which the Canadian Royal Flight was predominantly used.
*1860 – Grand Trunk Railway: Prince of Wales (later as King Edward VII)
*1901 – Canadian Pacific Railway: Duke of York (later as King George V)
*1906 – Canadian Pacific Railway: Duke of Connaught (Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn)
*1939 – Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway: King George VI and Queen Elizabeth

==Denmark==
Denmark’s oldest royal coach dates back to 1854 and known as JFJ S (I) (Jysk-Fynske Jernbaner) the S stands for Salonvogn which is the Danish classification for all the royal cars up to the modern day. It was gifted to King Frederik VII by Peto, Brassey &amp; Betts to the inauguration of the railway between Flensborg-Tønning. (Now in German Southern Schleswig)
and as a result of the Second Schleswig War better known as the war of 1864, it was stranded on the Prussian side but returned to Denmark in 1865 in a barge. 
It was rebuilt several times first in 1883 where it was fitted with a vacuum brake, gaslighting and Mays heating system. It was rebuilt again in 1898 from a 3-axle to 2-axle car and classified Danish State Railways DSB SB 2, and 1903 reclassified for the last time as DSB S 2 and used as an inspection car until 1934 when it was withdrawn from service. In 1935 its wooden coach body was sold to greengrocer Møller and used as a summer house in Hurup Thy until 1983 when it donated to the DJK (Dansk Jernbane-Kub) Danish railway club. In 1985 it was given to the Aalholm collection at Aalholm Castle, and in 2011 it came to the Danish Railway Museum in Odense where it sits on display as an unrestored coach body to show what several other coaches looked like before restoration.

For her 60th birthday in 2000, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark received a new royal coach with a drawing room, sleeping compartments and kitchen. She used this coach for her state visit to Belgium, travelling the night of 27–28 May 2002 from Denmark to Brussels-South and returning from there to Denmark on the evening of 30 May 2002. The coach and the accompanying sleeping car for the staff were hooked to normal trains, except for the part from Aachen to Brussels, where it ran as a special train to allow for the arrival on a reserved platform where the press were waiting.

==Ethiopia==
Emperor Menelik II was known to use a special first class saloon when travelling on the Franco-Ethiopian Railroad. In 1935 Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia received two carriages from the Société Franco-Belge in Raismes. Another two from the Decauville works were commissioned in 1954. As of its last use in 1973, prior to the Emperor&#x27;s overthrow in a coup d&#x27;etat the following year, the imperial train consisted of two locomotives, a baggage car with a diesel generator, four imperial carriages for the emperor and his family (lounge, sleeping compartments, offices, kitchen and restaurant), two 1st class salon-sleeper cars for guests of the royal family and government officials, and two 2nd passenger cars. Today the cars are held in storage in the obscure Railway Museum the yards of Legehar train station, but as of the early 2000s were kept in good condition and are occasionally open for public viewing.

== Germany ==
===Before 1918===

Germany consisted of more than 30 states – most of them monarchies – when railways came into existence. In the beginning, royalty used first class coaches or first class compartments within public coaches and trains. So Prince Frederick of Prussia (later German Emperor) travelled in a first class compartment in 1851 when the train derailed in the vicinity of Gütersloh.

But soon most of these kings, great dukes and princes possessed their own private coaches or trains. In other cases the railway companies provided such coaches and rented them to royalty. Complementary to those private coaches and trains were private reception rooms in the station buildings and in some cases even private railway stations for the exclusive use of these privileged few. A well-preserved example is Potsdam Park Sanssouci railway station, a railway station for the use of Emperor Wilhelm II near his summer palace, the New Palace in Potsdam.

====Prussia====
King Frederick William IV of Prussia purchased a set of royal coaches in 1857. They ran on two and three axles and were painted in a chestnut brown. None of these have survived. After 30 years of use they became technically outdated, so in 1889 the new emperor, Wilhelm II, who was always very interested in engineering and technological developments started to order new coaches. Until the end of his reign in 1918 there were about 30 coaches. These ran on bogies with either two or three axles and were painted in bright blue and ecru which contrasted significantly with ordinary coaches of the day which usually were painted green, grey or brown; only during World War I the imperial coaches were painted green. The private car of the emperor is on display in the German Museum of Technology, Berlin, the private car of the empress in the museum of former Linke-Hofmann-Busch GmbH (today: Alstom Transport Deutschland GmbH) who built the coach.

====Other states====

The kings of Saxony, Wurttemberg and Bavaria possessed their own trains. Two royal coaches of a most splendid design used by King Ludwig II of Bavaria are preserved in the Nuremberg Transport Museum, the king&#x27;s personal coach as well as a terrace-coach, by half open-air. The Weimar Republic inherited about 100 of these royal cars, a number far larger than useful for the president and government. So no new cars were built but some of the old ones used. Others were used in luxury trains or in ordinary services, especially dining cars, or as sleepers. Many of them were also converted to departmental vehicles.

==Japan==

In Japan, trains for the emperor, the empress, or the empress dowager are called , literally meaning &quot;trains that they use&quot;, albeit using an extremely polite word for &quot;use&quot;. Trains for the other members of the imperial family are called , meaning &quot;trains to ride&quot; in slightly more common language. However, both &quot;Omeshi Ressha&quot; and &quot;Gojōyō Ressha&quot; refer to a non-scheduled service solely operated for the imperial family. Dedicated imperial carriages were owned by Japanese National Railways (JNR), and these came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) following privatization. The dedicated locomotive-hauled set was retired in the 2000s and replaced by the specially built E655 series EMU, which can also be used as a VIP charter trainset.

When the emperor must travel on the Shinkansen or private railways, other trainsets may be used for &quot;Omeshi Ressha&quot; service, such as the Kintetsu 50000 series EMU for visits to Ise Grand Shrine. These trainsets are otherwise operated regularly for passenger service, but as is the case with the Kintetsu 50000 or the N700 Series Shinkansen, may have carriages retrofitted with bulletproof windows to accommodate the emperor.

Additionally, when travelling to Ise, an additional carriage is reserved solely for the transport of the Three Sacred Treasures as they must accompany the emperor.

Under Emperor Akihito, imperial trains were used less and less: the emperor generally travelled by air, or regular scheduled trains with a reserved carriage. In this case, bulletproof carriages were still be operated where available. Imperial trains were still operated occasionally, but they mainly functioned as a cordial reception for state guests, rather than transportation of the imperial family.

==Morocco==
The Moroccan royal train was composed of SPV-2000 railcars produced by Budd Company in the US and delivered in the early 1980s. The royal train consists of two self-propelled cars. After King Hassan II died, his successor, King Mohammed VI, stopped using the royal train.

==The Netherlands==

The Dutch State Railways (NS) uses a single royal carriage to transport the king and his family. It was ordered by the Dutch royal family in 1991, and construction was finished in 1993. It replaced a previous two-carriage royal train built in 1930, which is currently on display in the Dutch Railway Museum. In 2012 two more carriages were added to the royal train. These former first class passenger carriages were slightly modified and painted blue for use in the royal train. However, they are not available for international use, unlike the royal carriage itself, which is an International Coach Regulations carriage allowed in 16 different countries. When the king travels by train, a single (diesel) locomotive travels ahead to explore the tracks. The train itself is composed of two ordinary locomotives of the Dutch State Railways (head and tail of the train), the royal carriage itself, and, since 2012, the two slightly modified first class passenger carriages for staff, press and other guests. Before 2012, instead of the two extra carriages, two ordinary first class passenger carriages were added. Usually those carriages were the most luxurious type NS had available.

==New Zealand==

The Royal Trains were special train carriages used by the New Zealand Railways during royal visits to New Zealand between 1901 and 1954.

==Norway==

The Norwegian Royal Train is a train carriage used by the Norwegian royal family and maintained by the Norwegian Railway Museum. The current carriage was introduced in 1994 in connection with the Lillehammer Olympics and replaced a carriage from 1962. The current carriage contains a main sleeping compartment with dressing room and adjoining bathroom, two guest compartments, guest bathroom, kitchen, guard compartments and a combined dining and conference room.

The carriage is pulled by ordinary railway locomotives and most often ordinary passenger carriages for press and other guests are added.

==Romania==
The Romanian Royal Train was ordered by King Ferdinand I of Romania in 1926 to Ernesto Breda/Construzioni Meccaniche plants in Milan. It was delivered in 1928, one year after King Ferdinand&#x27;s death. It was subsequently used by Queen Marie of Romania, King Michael I of Romania, Queen-Mother Elena of Romania and King Carol II of Romania.

The train is composed of one steam-engine locomotive (under restoration, for the moment) and five railway cars: the Dining Car, the King&#x27;s Car, the Queen&#x27;s Car, the Guests Car and the Royal House Personnel&#x27;s Car.

On 3 January 1948 King Michael I and his mother, Queen Elena, were forced into exile by the newly installed Communist authorities. After a thorough luggage search for values, the King left Romania (from Sinaia) for Austria, in the Royal Train, with tightly closed windows and under strict supervision. The royal family was in exile until 1997, when the post-1989 government of Victor Ciorbea revoked their loss of citizenship.

During the communist era, the train was used occasionally by the communist rulers of Romania, especially by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.

In recent years, the Royal Train was gradually renovated by an NGO (the old steam locomotive is still under renovation and cannot be used).

On 15 October 2012, ownership of the train line reverted from the state to the ownership of King Michael I. Starting in 2012, the Royal Train is annually used by the Romanian royal family (Crown Princess Margareta, the eldest daughter and heir of King Michael) for public events, mainly trips with political and symbolic significance as well as travelling between the Balkan countries. For example, since 2013, the train has made regular trips. The first one was on 1 December (celebration of National Union of Romania) one the route Sinaia, Bușteni, Predeal, Brașov, Codlea, Făgăraş, Avrig and Sibiu and it was met with huge public appreciation and participation at stops; another trip was in remembrance of the royal family, Parliament and Government retreat from Bucharest to Iași in World War I, during the German occupation of Bucharest. The trips are met with great political and public enthusiasm as well as anticipation.

King Michael I of Romania was given a state funeral on 16 December 2017. At the conclusion of the ceremonies in Bucharest, the coffin was taken from Băneasa Railway Station to Curtea de Argeş Railway Station on board the Royal Train for burial in Curtea de Argeş.

==Russian Empire==

The late Romanov Tsars traveled by rail extensively over the expanse of their empire.

The catastrophic derailment of the Russian Royal Train on 17 October 1888 killed 21 people, however Alexander III, along with his wife and children, survived. After this accident, a so-called Temporary Imperial Train was composed of several surviving cars of the wrecked train, with the addition of several converted passenger cars of the Nikolayevskaya Railway. The emperor also had at his disposal a standard gauge Imperial Train, used for traveling to Europe; this train set was purchased by the Russian Railway Ministry from Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée in the 1870s, and was deemed to be technologically obsolescent.

Accordingly, new standard-gauge and broad-gauge trains for the use of the Imperial Court were constructed. The new broad-gauge Imperial Train for domestic travel became ready in time for the coronation of Nicholas II in 1896. Initially the train consisted of 7 cars, purpose-built at the Aleksandrovsky Railway Factory in St Petersburg. Later, the size of the train was increased to 10 cars. When the Royal family moved from one palace to another, as much as twenty cars were required just for their luggage. One of the best known aspects of the refurbished train was the Tsar&#x27;s personal bathroom which boasted a bathtub that would not spill water no matter which direction the train was turning. The old &quot;temporary&quot; train in the meantime was transferred for use of Empress Dowager Maria Feodorovna.

The Russian Empire itself came to an end with Nicholas II&#x27;s abdication in 1917 while aboard his Imperial Train at Dno. The train itself was later moved to Alexandria Park in the 1930s and used as a museum exhibition. It was later captured by the Nazis, who stripped it of much of its piping, plumbing and wiring and looted any items of value during the Second World War. In 1954, the Politburo ordered all remnants of the Imperial Train to be dismantled.

==South Africa==
From 5 February to 10 April 1934, Prince George, Duke of Kent, toured South Africa in a special train known as The White Train.

The three-month-long British royal family tour of South Africa in 1947 saw the ordering of eight ivory-painted air-conditioned saloons from Britain, three of which were built to Blue Train sleeping car standards, while the remaining five were special saloons for use by the royal family and Field Marshal Jan Smuts, the South African prime minister.

After the tour the Blue Train type saloons were painted in matching livery to serve on the Blue Train, while the remaining special saloons became part of the White Train used exclusively by the governor-general and later the president of South Africa. Part of the Royal Train is preserved in the Outeniqua Transport Museum, George, South Africa, with a SAR Class &quot;GL&quot; 2351 &quot;Princess Alice&quot; Garrett steam locomotive that actually was used to haul the White Train in 1947.

==Sweden==
Sweden&#x27;s first royal train was put into service in 1874 for the use of King Oscar II. It consisted of five cars: an audience (meeting) car, a dining car, a saloon car, a sleeping car for the King and another sleeping car for Queen consort Sophia. In 1891 the cars were converted to bogie-cars and put together two and two: The King&#x27;s sleeping car was joined with the saloon car; the Queen&#x27;s sleeping car was joined with the dining car. The audience car was not converted. The different cars were rebuilt, refurbished and replaced continuously over the years, and some of them are now on display at the Swedish Railway Museum in Gävle. The last royal train car to be built was in 1931 for King Gustav V. It was used on the King&#x27;s many trips from Sweden to Nice in southern France as a through coach connected to regular trains. The King&#x27;s royal car remained in use for several of his successors and was also used by the present King Carl XVI Gustaf and his family on their trips to the mountains in northern Sweden, as a through coach connected to regular trains. In the year 2001 the last royal car was taken out of regular service and is now on display at the Swedish Railway Museum, however it has been put back into service for special occasions since; the museum is connected by rail to the regular network and some of the cars on display can rather easily be brought back to service.

==United Kingdom==

Queen Victoria was the first British monarch to travel by train, on 13 June 1842, when she travelled on the Great Western Railway (GWR), which ran the line between London Paddington and Windsor (for Windsor Castle). She famously quoted, when the train was recording , &quot;This is too fast for a person to travel&quot;. Soon, other major British railway companies had their own carriage(s) dedicated for use by the royal family or other dignitaries.

In 1948, upon the formation of British Railways, the individual regions continued to maintain their own royal train carriages. A single &quot;Royal Train&quot; was only formed in 1977 as a response to the demands of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. This train has been maintained since the privatisation of British Rail by DB Cargo UK at Wolverton Works, although the royal family has travelled on ordinary service trains more frequently in recent years to minimise costs.

==Non-royal official trains==
Rail transport, in the form of special presidential trains, have been widely used by the leaders of countries that are/were not monarchies, while private rail cars, whether attached to regular passenger trains or not, were once used by the very rich in many countries. Presidents of the United States often traveled in presidential railcars and Soviet leaders had special trains. (One of Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s rail cars is preserved at the Pokrovsk Station in Engels City and Volodymyr Shcherbytsky&#x27;s car in Kyiv.) Leaders of North Korea, starting from Kim Il-Sung, had their own fleet of private trains. In Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito had the Blue Train. In the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos had the Presidential Carriage (PC) 286. This unit was decommissioned in 1986, but in 2020 this carriage was planned for refurbishment.

<text>Heller Hobby GmbH is a French manufacturing company established in 1957 in Paris. Currently headquartered in Radevormwald, Germany, Heller produces plastic scale model kits of cars, aircraft, ships, and military vehicles.

== History ==
Heller was founded in Paris in 1957 by Léo Jahiel, born in Lyon. He had previously worked at SOMAP, a plastics company, and set up company headquarters on Rue de Paradis in the 10th arrondissement of Paris, with a production facility in Trun, Orne. The first Heller&#x27;s model kit was a 1/100 scale Sud Aviation Caravelle, produced the following year. In 1963, a production facility was established in Trun.

In 1972, Heller joined with Solido (a die cast toy car maker), Jouef (an HO scale train maker) and Delacoste (maker of balloons and toys) to form &quot;Le Jouet Français.&quot; In 1980 the company went into liquidation and was in Court directed administration in May 1981. The company was broken up: Majorette bought Solido, Vullierme bought Delacoste, and Jouef was bought back by a subsidiary company of the &quot;CEJI&quot; group (Compagnie Générale du Jouet).

On June 9, 1977, Heller&#x27;s founder, Léo Jahiel, was made a member of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing for his years of professional activity.

Heller was acquired in 1981 by the Hobby Products Group of Borden, Inc., owners of British model company Humbrol. In 1986 Airfix also joined the group. Production of Airfix kits, already in Calais, moved to the Heller factory in Trun. Heller, with the rest of the group was acquired by an Irish investment company, Allen, McGuire &amp; Partners, in 1994, and received 31 million francs of investment.

In 1999 Heller re-branded as Heller SA and acquired, together with the Thirion group, French toy manufacturer Joustra. In 2005, Heller SA was acquired by French buyers but in 2006 once again the company went into administration.

In July 2006 the company was put into receivership and in November Hornby PLC bought sister brands Airfix and Humbrol but not Heller or its factory. By January 2007 Heller SA was transferred to &quot;la société MANOP&quot; (Manufacture d&#x27;Objet Précieux) under the direction of Benjamin Leneman, and over the next 7 years slowly returned to profitability selling model kits.

Heller SA yet again found itself in trouble in 2016. It was &quot;in a situation of non-financial return due to cash flow problems and a decline consumption related to the November attacks.&quot; The Commercial Court of Argentan, on 11 March, approved the acquisition of Heller-Joustra (Heller SA) by Maped, following six weeks of administration. Maped, in partnership with entrepreneur Alain Bernard of the New York Finance Innovation (of Paris) had invested 3.5 million euros in Heller-Joustra.

On March 18, 2019, Antoine Lacroix, Directeur General of Groupe Maped announced that Heller was acquired by the company Glow2B of Germany, which had been the distributor of Joustra and Heller products in that country. They announced that production would continue in both France and Germany.

<doc id="1209196" wikidata="Q857562" url="?curid=1209196" title="Remington Model 700">
<text>The [[Remington Arms|Remington]] Model 700 is part of a series of bolt-action (later semi-automatic 7400 series) centerfire rifles manufactured by Remington Arms since 1962. It is a progressive variant of the Remington Model 721 and Model 722 rifles series, which was introduced in 1948. The M24 and M40 military sniper rifles, which are both based on the Model 700 design, are in use by the United States Army and United States Marine Corps, respectively.

The Remington 700 series rifles feature a 3, 4, or 5-round internal magazine depending on the caliber. Some models include a hinged floor plate for quick unloading and can also be configured with a detachable box magazine. The Model 700 is available in many different stock, barrel, and caliber combinations, with many third-party and aftermarket variants built on the same action footprint. From 1978 to 1982, Remington offered the Sportsman 78, which had the same Model 700 action but with lower-cost features, such as a plain, non-knurled stock.

==Development==
After World War II, Remington Arms engineer Merle &quot;Mike&quot; Walker designed lower-cost alternatives to the Model 30, resulting in the Model 721. These used a cylindrical receiver produced from cylindrical bar stock that could be turned on a lathe rather than machined in a series of milling operations which significantly reduced production costs. Additionally, small metal parts, such as the bottom metal, were stamped, and the stocks were finished to a lower standard than previous models. The Model 721 saw further development under the direction of Walker, which resulted in the Model 722, 725 and ultimately the Model 700 in 1962.

Walker sought to increase the rifles&#x27; accuracy by utilizing tight tolerances in the chamber and bore, a short leade, and a much faster lock time. Like the earlier Model 721, the Model 700 was designed for mass production. Remington initially produced two variants of the Model 700, the ADL and BDL, in both long-action and short-action rifles that allowed for the chambering of different cartridges. 

In 1969, Remington introduced several upgrades to the rifle, including a more extended rear bolt shroud, a jeweled bolt, and improved stock finishing. Four years later, the production of left-handed versions of the rifle began to compete with the Savage Model 110, the only primary rifle manufactured with a left-handed variant. Since then, various versions of the gun have been introduced, including the titanium receiver 700 Ti, the 700 SPS (which replaced the ADL in 2005), and the CDL. In addition to it being catered as a hunting rifle, the Model 700 also provided the basis for military and police sniper rifles, starting with the M40 rifle in 1966, which the U.S. Marine Corps initially ordered. The U.S. Army adopted the M24 Sniper Weapon System in 1986.

===Design===
The Remington 700 is a manually operated bolt-action rifle with two forward dual-opposed lugs. The bolt face is recessed, fully enclosing the base of the cartridge. The extractor is a C-clip sitting within the bolt face. The ejector is a plunger on the bolt face actuated by a coil spring. The bolt is of three-piece construction (head, body, and bolt handle), brazed together. The receiver is milled from round cross-section steel.

The Remington 700 is available in numerous variants. 

* The symmetrical two-lug bolt body has a diameter. 
* The long action — designed for full-length cartridges up to in overall length, such as the .30-06 Springfield, and magnum cartridges, such as the 7mm Remington Magnum and .300 Winchester Magnum — has a lock time of 3.0 to 3.2 milliseconds. 
* The short action designed for cartridges having an overall length of or less, such as the .308 Winchester/7.62×51mm NATO, has a lock time of 2.6 milliseconds.

The rifles are designed to accept different magazine configurations — a blind magazine without a floor-plate, a conventional magazine with a detachable floor-plate, and a detachable box magazine. There are standard consumer versions as well as versions designed for military and police use. Some variants also have bipods, slings and other accessories.

===Standard versions===

Remington produces the Mountain LSS model with a stainless steel barrel and laminated stock. Heavy barrel versions with laminated stocks like the Model 700 SPS Varmint are available for varmint hunting. The Model 700 ADL was replaced as the most economical Model 700 by the Model 700 SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic) in newer production.

Remington also produced a 700 ML (muzzleloader) rifle from 1996-2004. 

The EtronX electronic primer ignition system was implemented in the Model 700 EtronX introduced in 2000, though this model was a commercial failure and ceased production in 2003 along with the EtronX primers.

Remington markets the 700 to military forces and civilian law-enforcement agencies under the &quot;Remington Law Enforcement&quot; and &quot;Remington Military&quot; banners, with the military/law enforcement 700s referred to as the Model 700P (&quot;Police&quot;).

The 700P series was influenced by the designs, features and success of the M24 Sniper Weapon System and the M40 series; for instance, the Model 700P series features a heavier and thicker barrel for increased accuracy and reduced recoil. 

The rifle is chambered for the .308 Winchester cartridge as well as the .223 Remington, .243 Winchester, 7mm Remington Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum, .300 Remington Ultra Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum. The 700P has a 26&quot; barrel and aluminum block bedding in its stock made by HS Precision.

Remington also sells the standard U.S. Army-issue Leupold Mark IV M3 10x40mm telescopic sight used by the Army&#x27;s M24 as an optional feature.

Remington offers similarly styled, less expensive versions under the Special Purpose Synthetic (SPS) name.

===Military version===

Both the U.S. Army&#x27;s M24 Sniper Weapon System and U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; M40 sniper rifles are built from the Remington Model 700 rifle with different degrees of modification, the main difference being the custom fitted heavy contour barrel and action length. The M24 utilizes the long action and the M40 employs the short action bolt-face, as the M24 was originally intended to chamber the longer .300 Winchester Magnum round. The M40, however, was not intended to chamber the more powerful .300 Winchester Magnum round, yet the Marine Corps&#x27; intention was to migrate to the .300 Winchester Magnum cartridge. The Marine Corps&#x27; delay led to a change in the migratory direction. The goal was for the M40 to become a rifle chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum.
The United States Army&#x27;s Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center awarded Remington a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (W15QKN-10-R-0403) for the upgrade of up to 3,600 M24 Sniper Weapon Systems (SWS) fielded to the Army, pending type classification as the “M24E1”. The major configuration change for this system was the caliber conversion from 7.62mm NATO (.308 Winchester) to .300 Winchester Magnum to provide soldiers with additional precision engagement capability and range. The contract was for a five-year period with a guaranteed minimum value of $192K and a potential value of up to $28.2 million. This award followed a full and open competitive evaluation lasting nine months, which began with the release of the Army&#x27;s Request for Proposal (RFP) on January 13, 2010. The program was executed under the authority of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, and managed by its subordinate unit, Product Manager Individual Weapons. 

In 2009, the U.S. Army changed the weapon name from M24E1 to XM2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle.

=== Model Seven version ===
The Remington Model Seven carbine is a compact version of the Remington 700 built around a short action and chambered in the .223 Rem and .308 Win class cartridges. Introduced in 1983, the stock is shorter than the standard version with the barrel being only 18.5&quot;.

==Controversy==

Thousands of Remington Model 700 customers have complained to Remington that a defect in the trigger mechanism could cause the gun to be fired without the trigger being squeezed. Remington received nearly 2,000 complaints from 2013 through 2016 and 150 lawsuits had been filed against Remington alleging injury or death related to the trigger. Lawsuits have alleged that Remington covered up a design flaw in the trigger mechanism, resulting in dozens of deaths and hundreds of serious injuries. A class-action lawsuit alleges Remington knowingly sold a defective product. The Attorneys general from nine states and the District of Columbia objected to the proposed settlement in the class action, saying that Remington has &quot;long known&quot; of the defect and that the proposed settlement &quot;fails to adequately protect public safety.&quot;

On October 20, 2010, CNBC televised the first in an ongoing investigative series, &quot;Remington Under Fire: a CNBC Investigation,&quot; reporting that the trigger mechanism used prior to 2007 on the Model 700 could fire without the trigger being squeezed. The report stated that Remington has received thousands of customer complaints since the firing mechanism was introduced in the 1940s and that nearly two dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries had been attributed to inadvertent discharges of 700 series rifles. Through internal Remington documents, the program showed that on multiple occasions the company considered recalling the product.

The inventor of the firing mechanism, Mike Walker, 98 years old at the time of the documentary, told CNBC he proposed what he called a &quot;safer trigger&quot; back in 1948 while the product was still in the testing stage. Walker said his enhanced design was rejected because of the added cost, 5.5 cents per gun (adjusted for inflation: $). Critics of the documentary countered that every incident featured on the program involving loss of life was the result of firearms mishandling, where owners pointed their rifles at other human beings. Remington responded with the Remington Model 700 Network, which gave direct rebuttals to the program, and their perspective on the incidents the program described. Remington dismisses the allegations, pointing out that in every case either trigger mechanisms of the rifles were adjusted or altered beyond recommended specifications, with rifles being poorly maintained and left to rust, or due to the misuse of the rifles. Those involved admitted to police they might have &quot;possibly&quot; pulled the trigger.

Though Remington has since changed to a new, cheaper, trigger mechanism design, the original Walker trigger is still produced for the U.S. military and buyers of custom rifles.

On December 6, 2014, Remington announced that as a part of actions put into place to settle multiple lawsuits and to avoid future legal actions, they are replacing all triggers in the Model 700s. Over 7.85 million rifles were included in this agreement, making all of them eligible for replacements.

On February 19, 2017, CBS News&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired a segment on the Remington 700 trigger mechanism safety. The episode highlighted incidents of accidental deaths as a result of Remington 700s firing without the trigger being initiated, problems with Remington&#x27;s trigger mechanism replacement program, and a class-action lawsuit filed by Remington owners.

<doc id="1209200" wikidata="Q5532208" url="?curid=1209200" title="General Spanky">
<text>General Spanky is a 1936 American comedy film produced by Hal Roach. A spin-off of Roach&#x27;s popular &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects, the film stars George McFarland, Phillips Holmes, Rosina Lawrence, Billie Thomas and Carl Switzer. Directed by Fred Newmeyer and Gordon Douglas, it was originally released to theaters on December 11, 1936, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).

This film, a Civil War period piece, was intended as an experiment to determine if Roach could move &quot;Our Gang&quot; into features, as the double feature and block booking were slowly smothering his short subjects production. The film was a box-office disappointment and, after another year of shorts production, Roach ended up selling the &quot;Our Gang&quot; unit to MGM in May 1938.

When Roach bought the rights to the back catalog of &quot;Our Gang&quot; films he had produced from MGM in 1949, he did not buy back the rights to &quot;General Spanky&quot;. The film was part of the pre-May 1986 MGM catalog acquired in 1986 by Turner Entertainment Co., which holds the rights today as a subsidiary of Warner Bros. &quot;General Spanky&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1991. In 2016, it was released on DVD in Region 1 by Warner Bros. via their Warner Archive Collection.

==Plot==
Spanky (George McFarland), Alfalfa (Carl Switzer), Buckwheat (Billie Thomas) and others form an army called &quot;The Royal Protection of Women and Children Regiment Club of the World and Mississippi River&quot;. The group sees unexpected action when Union troops approach, engaging in battles more farcical than fierce. Using clowning tactics instead of military tactics, the kids stop the advance . . . and later save an adult friend from the firing squad.

<text>Go Figure is the fifth studio album by Canadian folk rock group Spirit of the West, released on June 25, 1991 by Warner Music Canada. It was the band&#x27;s first rock album, and their first with drummer Vince Ditrich.

The album garnered the band new airplay on rock music radio stations, although it was controversial among the band&#x27;s traditional folk music fan base. The album includes a rock rendition of &quot;Political&quot;, one of the band&#x27;s best known songs. During the concert tour to support this album, fans in one city actually presented the band with a petition requesting that they play the &quot;old&quot; version of that song.

Despite earning a gold record, the album was only a modest success on the charts, however, peaking at #45 on &quot;RPM&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 albums chart.

A recurring theme throughout the album is disaffection with the government of then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. &quot;D for Democracy&quot;, &quot;Pulling Lame&quot; and &quot;Far Too Canadian&quot; are all anti-Mulroney songs, reflecting the widespread popular opposition to Mulroney among the Canadian public which led to the 1992 defeat of the Charlottetown Accord and the Progressive Conservative decimation in the 1993 Canadian federal election. However, &quot;D for Democracy&quot; is not about Mulroney alone, as the song also touches on other contemporaneous stories of political malfeasance, such as the drug controversy surrounding Washington, DC mayor Marion Barry.

<doc id="1209207" wikidata="Q531857" url="?curid=1209207" title="Stephen Ross (economist)">
<text>Stephen Alan &quot;Steve&quot; Ross (February 3, 1944 – March 3, 2017) was the inaugural Franco Modigliani Professor of Financial Economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management after a long career as the Sterling Professor of Economics and Finance at the Yale School of Management. He is known for initiating several important theories and models in financial economics. He was a widely published author in finance and economics, and was a coauthor of a best-selling Corporate Finance textbook.

He received his BS with honors from Caltech in 1965 where he majored in physics, and his PhD in economics from Harvard in 1970, and taught at the University of Pennsylvania, Yale School of Management, and MIT.

Ross is best known for the development of the arbitrage pricing theory (mid-1970s) as well as for his role in developing the binomial options pricing model (1979; also known as the Cox–Ross–Rubinstein model). He was an initiator of the fundamental financial concept of risk-neutral pricing. In 1985 he contributed to the creation of the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model for interest rate dynamics. Such theories have become an important part of the paradigm known as neoclassical finance.

Ross also introduced a rigorous modeling of the agency problem in 1973, as seen from the principal&#x27;s standpoint.

Ross served as president of the American Finance Association in 1988. He was named International Association of Financial Engineers&#x27; Financial Engineer of the Year in 1996.

He gave the inaugural lecture of the Princeton Lectures in Finance, sponsored by the Bendheim Center for Finance of Princeton University, in 2001. It became a book in 2004, presenting neoclassical finance and defending it, including such notions as the efficiency and rationality of markets, against its critics, especially those who belong to the behavioral finance tradition.

Ross was a recipient of a 2006 Smith Breeden Prize, a 2012 Onassis Prize, a 2014 Morgan Stanley - AFA Award for Excellence in Finance, as well as a 2015 Deutsche Bank Prize for developing models used for assessing prices for options and other assets in the previous 30 years.

Ross chaired the theses of a number of prominent economists, including John Y. Campbell, Douglas Diamond, Philip H. Dybvig, and William N. Goetzmann. Two of his students, Douglas Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2022.

<text>Donald Ellis Wildmon (January 18, 1938 – December 28, 2023) was an American ordained United Methodist minister, author, radio host, and founder and chairman of the American Family Association and American Family Radio.

==Life and career==
Donald Ellis Wildmon was born in Ripley, Mississippi, the son of Johnnie Bernice (née Tigrett), a schoolteacher, and Ellis Clifton Wildmon, a civil servant. Wildmon graduated from Millsaps College in 1960. In 1961, he married Lynda Lou Bennett, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. From 1961 to 1963, he served in the U.S. Army. He gained his Master of Divinity (M.Div.) from Emory University&#x27;s Candler School of Theology in 1965.

In June 1977, he moved to Tupelo, Mississippi, to establish the National Federation for Decency (NFD), the predecessor to the modern American Family Association, because after watching television one night in December 1976 he felt that no primetime television program was appropriate for his family with young children. With a membership of 1,400, NFD&#x27;s first television advertiser boycott was during spring 1978 and against Sears for sponsoring &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. Sears withdrew sponsorship of the latter two programs.

In February 1980, Wildmon founded the Coalition for Better Television (CBTV), this time with the help of Jerry Falwell and claiming a nationwide membership of 5 million. However, CBTV disbanded and Wildmon started Christian Leaders for Responsible Television without Falwell&#x27;s involvement.

In 1986, the owners of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain pulled adult magazines from its stores after a boycott by the NFD.

===Campaign for Decency===
Throughout the late 1970s, Wildmon actively protested television series that he thought promoted immoral lifestyles. He spoke against such programs as &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;.

=== &quot;Damned in the U.S.A.&quot; ===
In 1991, the British television documentary &quot;Damned in the U.S.A.&quot;, made for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Without Walls&quot; arts series and directed by Paul Yule, about the then current state of censorship in the United States, chronicled the battle between Wildmon and artists Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe. The documentary won the International Emmy for Best Documentary, amongst several other awards. Wildmon sued the producers for $8 million in damages after a distributor got the rights to show the film in the United States, stating that he had signed a contract with the producers that prevented distribution in the USA. A federal court found that Wildmon&#x27;s contract did not support his claim concerning distribution of the film and the documentary was released in 50 cities nationwide.

=== Illness and retirement ===
On August 18, 2009, Tim Wildmon released the news via email that his father had been admitted to the North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo over the weekend of August 15–16, with what was thought to be a serious case of meningitis. After running tests, however, doctors determined that he had Saint Louis encephalitis, a disease usually contracted from mosquitoes. He spent 121 days in the hospital and rehabilitation, and later underwent surgery for cancer on his left eye. On March 3, 2010, it was announced that Wildmon was stepping down as chairman of the American Family Association. His son Tim was expected to become the new chairman.

On December 28, 2023, Wildmon died in Tupelo, Mississippi, at the age of 85, due to complications from Lewy body dementia.

Laurenson appeared in numerous British Shakespearean productions, notably &quot;Richard II&quot;, and as Rosencrantz in &quot;Hamlet.&quot; He performed on radio in the marathon series, &quot;Vivat Rex&quot;. He also appeared as Piers Gaveston in the 1970 production of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot;, opposite Ian McKellen. The latter actor later recalled that kissing Laurenson &quot;was a bonus throughout the run&quot;. Other costume roles by Laurenson included a French courtier in &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; and the Earl of Lincoln in &quot;Shadow of the Tower&quot; (1972).

That same year (1972), he took on a more modern role starring as Det. Inspector Napoleon &quot;Boney&quot; Bonaparte in the Australian TV drama series &quot;Boney.&quot; His character was a police detective who was half-Aboriginal. His two seasons in that role was his most high-profile part. Some Australian critics, including from within the Australian Aboriginal community criticised the casting of a white man in the role, believing that an Aboriginal actor would have been ideal.

In 1974, Laurenson took the lead role in the TV film &quot;The Prison&quot;, based on the novel by Georges Simenon. This was the first instalment in the Thames Television/Euston Films series &quot;Armchair Cinema&quot;. He also starred as Pink&#x27;s Father in the 1982 film, &quot;Pink Floyd—The Wall&quot;.

Laurenson took the lead role of Julian Marsh in the 1984 West End production of Gower Champion&#x27;s musical &quot;42nd Street&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. This was his only role in a musical. He made another notable stage appearance at Greenwich Theatre in &quot;Falling Over England&quot; with Charlotte Cornwell.

Throughout his career, Laurenson had guest roles in numerous popular TV series such as &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Professionals&quot;, &quot;Armchair Thriller&quot;, &quot;Hammer House of Horror&quot;, &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, &quot;Cagney and Lacey&quot;, &quot;Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense&quot;, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, &quot;Bergerac&quot;, &quot;Boon&quot;, &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Silent Witness&quot;, &quot;Taggart&quot;, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;State of Play&quot;, &quot;Hustle&quot;, &quot;Endeavour&quot; and &quot;Spooks&quot;.

Laurenson had many appearances on BBC Radio, including the role of the Squire of Altarnun in the 1991 adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;.

In 2012, he played the Earl of Westmoreland in the BBC Two adaptations of &quot;Henry IV, Parts I and II&quot;.
 In 2013 he appeared as Professor Hilary Ambrose in Season 2, Episode 5 of the BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Father Brown&quot; series. In 2016, he played the role of John Weir in the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
Laurenson was married twice, firstly to actress Carol MacReady with whom he had one son. He had made his long-term home in the English market-town of Frome in Somerset. He died on 18 April 2024, at the age of 84.

<doc id="1209231" wikidata="Q270907" url="?curid=1209231" title="ATP Finals">
<text>The ATP Finals is the season-ending championship of the ATP Tour. It is the most significant tennis event in the men&#x27;s annual calendar after the four majors, as it features the top eight singles players and top eight doubles teams based on their results throughout the season. The eighth spot is reserved, if needed, for a player or team who won a major in the current year and is ranked from ninth to twentieth.

The tournament uses a unique format not seen in other ATP Tour events, where the singles players and doubles teams are separated into two groups of four, within which they each play three round-robin matches. After the round-robin stage, the top two performers from each group play in knock-out semifinals and a final to determine the champion(s).

The tournament was first held in 1970, shortly after the beginning of the Open Era. Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most singles titles with seven, while Peter Fleming and John McEnroe jointly hold the record for the most doubles titles with seven (all won consecutively as a team).

In the tournament&#x27;s current format, the champion can earn a maximum of 1,500 ranking points, if they win the event after going undefeated in the round-robin stage. By winning the 2024 title, Sinner earned a record $4,881,100, the highest payout for a tournament winner in tennis. In 2022, Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury claimed $930,300, the highest payout in doubles history.
== Tournament ==

=== History ===
The ATP Finals is the fifth iteration of a championship which began in 1970. It was originally known as the Masters Grand Prix and was part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit. It was organised by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) and ran alongside the competing WCT Finals from 1971 to 1989. The Masters was a year-end showpiece event between the best players on the men&#x27;s tour, but did not count for any world ranking points.

In 1990, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) took over the running of the men&#x27;s tour and replaced the Masters with the &quot;ATP Tour World Championships&quot;. World ranking points were now at stake, with an undefeated champion earning the same number of points they would earn for winning one of the four Grand Slam events. The ITF, who continued to run the Grand Slam tournaments, created a rival year-end event known as the Grand Slam Cup, which was contested by the 16 players with the best records in the Grand Slam tournaments of the season (1990–99).

In December 1999, the ATP and ITF agreed to discontinue the two separate events and create a new jointly-owned event called the &quot;Tennis Masters Cup&quot;. As with the Masters Grand Prix and the ATP Tour World Championships, the Tennis Masters Cup was contested by eight players and teams. However, the player or team ranked number eight in the ATP Race world rankings was not guaranteed a spot: if a player or team won one of the year&#x27;s majors and finished the year ranked from ninth to twentieth, they were included in the Tennis Masters Cup instead. If two outside the top eight won majors, the higher-ranked of the two in the world rankings took the final spot. This accommodation for major champions continues in the event&#x27;s current form.

In 2009, the championship was renamed the &quot;ATP World Tour Finals&quot; and was held at The O2 Arena in London. The contract ran through 2013, but was extended multiple times until it was last held there in 2020. In 2017 the event was renamed the &quot;ATP Finals&quot;. In April 2019, the ATP announced that Turin would host the ATP Finals from 2021 to 2025.

For most of its history, the event has been considered the most important indoor tennis tournament in the world (there were a few exceptions when the event was held outdoors: 1974 in Melbourne &amp; 2003–04 in Houston). The indoor atmosphere allows for controlled conditions of play, both in terms of the court surface and the court&#x27;s illumination.

In recent years it has been played on indoor hard courts, however, indoor carpet was used in some previous editions. On one occasion, when Melbourne hosted the event in 1974, the grass courts of Kooyong Stadium were used; the tournament was staged only 1–2 weeks before the 1975 Australian Open, which was also played on grass. Apart from 1974, all tournaments have been on a hard court variant, which has prompted calls from some players (such as Rafael Nadal) to feature a greater variety of surfaces, including clay courts.

For many years, the doubles event was held as a separate tournament staged the week after the singles competition, but more recently both events have been held together during the same week and in the same venue.

In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to reduce the number of staff on-site, the ATP introduced live electronic line-calling powered by Hawk-Eye Live. Instead of line umpires, the system detects the relevant movements of the player and where the ball bounces on court. A pre-recorded voice announces &quot;Out&quot;, &quot;Fault&quot;, and &quot;Foot fault&quot;. Also, video review was also introduced for suspected double bounces, touches, and other reviewable calls.

The tournament has traditionally been sponsored by the title sponsor of the tour; however, in 1990–2008 the competition was not sponsored, even though the singles portion of the event, as part of the ATP Tour, was sponsored by IBM. In 2009, the tournament gained Barclays PLC as its title sponsor. Barclays confirmed in 2015 that they would not renew their sponsorship deal once it expires in 2016. On 25 May 2017, it was announced that Nitto Denko would be the main sponsor for the tournament through 2020. In September 2020, Nitto Denko announced it will extend its title partnership of the ATP Finals for another five years, until 2025.

=== Qualification ===
The criteria to qualify for the ATP Finals are as follows:

# Players and teams who finish the season ranked in the top seven in the ATP race automatically qualify.
# The eighth spot is reserved for a player or team who won a major in the season and is ranked from eighth to twentieth. Goran Ivanišević in 2001, Albert Costa in 2002, Gastón Gaudio in 2004, and Marin Čilić in 2014 are the singles players who have qualified due to their major title despite not ending in the top eight in the ATP race.
# If more than one player or team won a Grand Slam event in the season and are ranked from eighth to twentieth, then whoever is highest-ranked is awarded the eighth spot; whoever is second highest-ranked is made first alternate.
# If there is no player who won a major in the season and is ranked from eighth to twentieth, then the eight spot is awarded to the player ranked eighth.

Two alternates also attend the ATP Finals. If the first alternate has already been selected according to (3) mentioned above, then the second alternate is the highest-ranked player who has not otherwise qualified for the event. If both alternate spots are available, they are awarded to the two highest-ranked players who did not otherwise qualify for the event.

An alternate can replace a player who withdraws before the round-robin stage is over, so long as the player who withdraws still has at least one round-robin match left to play. When an alternate enters the competition, his results are considered separately, i.e. the alternate does not inherit the results of the player he is replacing. If an alternate&#x27;s round-robin results qualify him for the semifinals, then he may continue into the single-elimination rounds.

=== Format ===
Unlike other events on the ATP Tour, the ATP Finals is not a straightforward single-elimination tournament. The eight players and teams are divided into two groups of four and each play three round-robin matches against the others in their group. After the round-robin stage, the top two performers in each group advance to the semifinals in a knock-out stage. The two winners of the semifinals play a final to determine the champion. In this format, it is theoretically possible to advance to the semifinals with two round-robin losses, but no player in the history of the singles tournament has won the title after losing more than one round-robin match.

To create the groups, the eight players and teams are seeded according to rank. The first and second seeds are placed in Group A and Group B, respectively. The remaining seeds are drawn in pairs (third and fourth, fifth and sixth, seventh and eighth); the first of the pair to be drawn goes to Group A and the other to Group B, and so on.

The format described above has been in place for all editions of the tournament except the following years:
* 1970–71: All round robin (no groups), no semifinals or finals, the winner was decided based on round-robin standings.
* 1982–84: 12-player three-round single-elimination tournament (no round robin), the top four seeds received byes in the first round.
* 1985: 16-player four-round single-elimination tournament (no round robin), no byes.

=== Group standings ===
Since 2019, the group standings at the end of the round-robin stage are determined by, in order:
* Most matches won.
* Most matches played (for example: the record 1–2 beats 1–1, and 2–1 beats 2–0).

If some players are tied, the following tiebreakers are used depending on how many players are tied (two or three):

If two players are tied, then:
* Head-to-head round-robin result.

If three players are tied, then the following tiebreakers are used, in order, until all three players are no longer tied OR until only two players are tied, at which point the two-player tie is broken by the head-to-head round robin result:
* Highest % of sets won.
* Highest % of games won.
* Highest ranking at the start of the tournament.

When calculating tiebreakers, a match that ended in a retirement is counted as a 0–2 sets loss for the retiring player and a 2–0 sets win for their opponent, regardless of the actual score when the retirement occurred. When calculating the &quot;Highest % of games won&quot; tiebreaker, a match that ended in a retirement is disregarded.

=== Singles venues ===
ATP Finals is the men&#x27;s premier indoor event of the season, only in three editions it was played outdoors; 1974, 2003 and 2004.

<text>Voyageur Colonial Bus Lines, commonly called Voyageur Colonial or just Voyageur, was a Canadian intercity bus company that serves Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec, primarily the cities of Montreal, Ottawa and Kingston, Toronto. It was acquired by Greyhound Canada in 1998.

==History==
Voyageur Colonial Limited was incorporated on January 7, 1928, as Colonial Coach Lines Ltd., which ran buses between Renfrew, Ottawa, Morrisburg and Kingston, Ontario. In 1930 Colonial was purchased by the Provincial Transport Company (la Compagnie de Transport-Provincial), which had been incorporated in November 1928 and acquired 31 bus lines in the Montreal area in June 1929. Colonial expanded during the 1930s and 1940s, acquiring many other operators, including the Toronto–Montreal Road Coach Line, the J. Gill Bus Line, Collacutt Coach Lines, Kawartha Lakes Coach Lines and Pony Bus Lines Ltd.

In Quebec, Provincial was affiliated with the Montreal Tramways Company until 1948. Operations included intercity bus service throughout the province and transit operations (through subsidiaries) in Sherbrooke, Quebec City, Kingston and elsewhere. In 1969, after 40 years of operation, all of Provincial Transport Enterprises&#x27; subsidiaries were unified under the Voyageur name. At the same time, Colonial Coach Lines was renamed Voyageur Colonial Ltd.
At various times Voyageur operated a number of subsidiaries, including Voyageur Abitibi (based in Val d&#x27;Or), Voyageur Inc., Voyageur Provincial (both headquartered in Montréal) and Voyageur Quebec. By 1981 the company was owned by Canada Steamship Lines Inc., 50% owned by Paul Martin&#x27;s family. The Quebec routes were sold to other operators over the following decade, and in 1994 Greyhound purchased key Ottawa and Toronto routes from Voyageur. In 1998 CSL sold Voyageur to Greyhound Canada, which in turn is owned by the UK-based FirstGroup.

<text>Oliver Howard Vaughton (9 January 1861 – 6 January 1937) was an England international footballer who played as an inside left.

Vaughton played for England on five occasions, scoring six goals. Five of his goals were scored in a 13–0 victory over Ireland in Belfast on 18 February 1882, with his Villa team-mate Arthur Brown contributing four.

After his football career ended he ran a silversmith&#x27;s firm, which was charged with making a new FA Cup after the original disappeared in mysterious circumstances in 1895.

He died in Birmingham on 6 January 1937, three days before what would have been his 76th birthday.

<doc id="1209254" wikidata="Q4934982" url="?curid=1209254" title="Bobby Estalella (outfielder)">
<text>Roberto Estalella Ventoza [es-tah-LAY-yah] (April 25, 1911 – January 6, 1991) was a Cuban professional baseball outfielder and third baseman, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Senators (–, and ), St. Louis Browns (), and Philadelphia Athletics (– and ). He was selected to represent the American League (AL) in the ill-fated 1945 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which was scheduled for July 10 at Fenway Park but never played because of World War II restrictions on civilian domestic travel.

==Early life==
Born in Cárdenas, Matanzas, Cuba, Estalella earned the nickname &quot;Tarzan&quot; by his medium-frame, stocky and compact body. Standing tall and weighing , he threw and batted right-handed.

==Professional career==
Estalella&#x27;s organized baseball career began in the minor leagues in 1934. After two brief trials with the 1935–1936 Harrisburg Senators, Estalella led the Class B Piedmont League in home runs (33) and batting average (.349) in 1937, and in 1938 he won the circuit&#x27;s Triple Crown, pacing the Piedmont League in batting (.378), homers (38) and runs batted in (123), as well as in hits (180) and runs scored (134). After that, he returned to the American League to spend full or partial seasons with the Senators (1939 and 1942) and Browns (1941). He was sent to the Athletics in 1943 in the same trade that brought All-Star outfielder &quot;Indian Bob&quot; Johnson to Washington.

With Philadelphia, Estalella hit .298 in and .299 in 1945 (fourth in the league). He would have played many more years, but he was one of the players suspended by Commissioner Happy Chandler in 1946 for jumping to the outlaw Mexican League. Chandler mentioned a lifetime suspension for them, but when the penalty was reduced in 1949, Estalella came back to the majors.

Although Estalella vigorously denied it during his life, several current baseball writers now consider him to have been the first player of some African ancestry to have played in the Major Leagues in the 20th century.

==Career stats==
In the major leagues, Estalella was a career .282 hitter with 44 home runs and 308 RBI in 680 games played. His 620 MLB hits included 106 doubles and 33 triples. He also compiled a respectable 1.423 walk-to-strikeout ratio (350-to-246) and a .383 on-base percentage. He led AL centerfielders in fielding percentage in both 1944 (.993) and 1945 (.990).

==Personal Life==
His grandson, also named Bobby Estalella, was a catcher who also played in Major League Baseball between and .

Bobby Estalella died in Hialeah, Florida at the age of 79.

<text>Patrick Travis Swilling (born October 25, 1964) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the New Orleans Saints, Detroit Lions, and the Oakland Raiders. He had five Pro Bowl appearances in his NFL career and was the Associated Press (AP) NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1991. He served from 2001 to 2004 as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives.

==College career==
Swilling played for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. He set the NCAA record for sacks in a game, with seven against North Carolina State and the Georgia Tech mark for sacks in a season (15). Voted first-team All-America in 1985, Swilling left Georgia Tech as the all-time sack leader and now ranks 5th.

==Professional career==
The New Orleans Saints drafted Swilling in the third round of the 1986 NFL Draft. The Saints fielded fierce defenses in 1991 and 1992, led by the best linebacker unit in the history of the league. In 1991, he had 17 sacks and was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year. In 1992, linebackers Rickey Jackson, Vaughan Johnson, Sam Mills, and Swilling, also known as the Dome Patrol, all played in the Pro Bowl, and the Saints led the league in quarterback sacks. Despite its tenacious defense, the team lost in the first round each time it made the playoffs during this time.

Swilling was traded to the Detroit Lions in 1993 for draft picks. In order to sign him, Detroit had to &quot;unretire&quot; the legendary Joe Schmidt’s number 56. In his first year with Detroit he made it to his fifth and final Pro Bowl. The Detroit Lions qualified for the playoffs in both of Swilling&#x27;s seasons with the team, being eliminated each time, in the first round, by the Green Bay Packers. He signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Raiders in April of 1995. He finished his career with 107.5 sacks.

Swilling lost all six playoff games he played in; no other player in NFL history has more losses, in the postseason, without a win.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Personal life==
Swilling was a professional football player from 1986 to 1998. In 2001, he won a special election as a Democrat to the Louisiana House for District 100 in New Orleans. He served for three years with assignments on the House Education, Retirement, and Transportation committees. He lost his bid for a full term as representative in the 2003 runoff election to his fellow Democrat Austin Badon, who polled 6,688 votes (53.3 percent) to Swilling&#x27;s 5,851 (46.7 percent).

On April 30, 2009, Swilling was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. He is currently a real estate developer in New Orleans. His son, Pat Swilling Jr. signed to play basketball at the University of Tulsa on May 24, 2012. Two of his sons, Bruce Jordan-Swilling and Tre Swilling, play on the Georgia Tech football team. As of the 2020–2021 season, Bruce is a senior linebacker and Tre is a redshirt junior defensive back.

Swilling&#x27;s son, Tre Swilling currently plays for the Baltimore Ravens.

<doc id="1209269" wikidata="Q3286639" url="?curid=1209269" title="2300 Arena">
<text>2300 Arena is a multipurpose indoor arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, used primarily for professional wrestling, boxing, mixed martial arts, and concert events. Originally known as Viking Hall, the venue has since been named XPW Arena, New Alhambra Sports &amp; Entertainment Center, New Alhambra Arena, The Arena and Asylum Arena. It was known unofficially as ECW Arena when it was home to Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from 1993 to 2001.

The venue has hosted professional wrestling broadcasts including the first ECW pay-per-view Barely Legal, the first Dragon Gate USA pay-per-view Enter the Dragon, and the WWE television special &quot;NXT&quot; 2300. It has hosted professional boxing broadcasts including &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot; and &quot;Wednesday Night Fights&quot;, for which it was named ESPN2&#x27;s 2006 Venue of the Year.

Recognized as the birthplace of American hardcore wrestling, the venue has been home to the Hardcore Hall of Fame since 2002.

==History==
===1920–1985: Freight house===
The South Philadelphia venue was originally constructed in 1920 as a freight house. Railway tracks next to the building allowed freight trains to drop off cargo for storage and then continue on to their destinations. The tracks were eventually paved over to become an extension of West Ritner Street, allowing West Ritner Street to intersect with South Swanson Street. An elevated stretch of Interstate 95 was later erected above the venue.

===1986–2002: South Philly Vikings management===

Elias Stein and Leon Silverman of the law firm Stein &amp; Silverman Family Partnership, Inc. purchased the freight house in 1986. The southern part of the facility was given the name Viking Hall when the South Philly Vikings, a local chapter of mummers, began utilizing it. They used the building to rehearse for the annual Mummers Parade, assembling and storing their floats within the facility. The South Philly Vikings also staged midnight bingo games at the venue to raise funds for their organization. Carmen &quot;Butch&quot; D&#x27;Amato of the South Philly Vikings served as the facility&#x27;s general manager. The northern part of the building was occupied by retail space, most notably a dollar store and Forman Mills.

====Extreme Championship Wrestling residency, 1993–2001====
The southern part of the building gained worldwide recognition when it served as ECW Arena, home of professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling from May 1993 until the promotion&#x27;s closure in April 2001. The promotion was charged $1,000 per month by Stein &amp; Silverman Family Partnership, Inc. to rent the venue, and was also responsible for any damage caused by its performers.

With the venue&#x27;s size and intimacy reminiscent of Japan&#x27;s Korakuen Hall, its vocal live crowds became synonymous with Extreme Championship Wrestling&#x27;s presentation of hardcore wrestling. Attendance frequently exceeded the venue&#x27;s legal seating capacity of 1,060. Fans Bring the Weapons matches encouraged audience members to purchase items from the adjacent dollar store for wrestlers to strike each other with. The promotion was sued after a fire stunt in October 1995 burned a member of the crowd. Frank Talent of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission was seen as an ally of the promotion, regularly turning a blind eye when regulations were violated.

Smart wrestling fans traveled from all over the world to experience the venue&#x27;s atmosphere. Extreme Championship Wrestling founded their annual CyberSlam fan convention and supercard at the venue in February 1996. Future All Elite Wrestling founder Tony Khan attended The Doctor Is In as a teenager in August 1996, a show that featured his future star Chris Jericho. The Elvis Depressedly album &quot;New Alhambra&quot; was named after the venue, with frontman Mathew Lee Cothran deriving inspiration from a bloody Rob Van Dam match he witnessed from the crowd.

Extreme Championship Wrestling moved away from the supercard model, broadcasting its first pay-per-view event called Barely Legal from the venue in April 1997. The promotion never ran another live broadcast from the venue, as their pay-per-view provider Request TV wanted the company to run events in larger cities.

===2002–2003: Xtreme Pro Wrestling management===
Following the closure of Extreme Championship Wrestling in April 2001, Combat Zone Wrestling and Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling began running regular shows at the venue. Ring of Honor opted to run their shows at nearby Murphy Recreation Center, citing the need to establish their own legacy separate from ECW.

Controversy arose when Xtreme Pro Wrestling signed an exclusive lease with the venue in December 2002 and renamed the building XPW Arena, preventing other promotions from utilizing it. Kirk Farrington, who had worked for Xtreme Pro Wrestling in California, was named the venue&#x27;s general manager. Forced to relocate, Combat Zone Wrestling moved their shows to CZW Arena in Southwest Philadelphia, Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling moved their shows to Electric Factory in Callowhill, and the South Philly Vikings established a new Viking Hall in East Passyunk Crossing.

In January 2003, the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission banned barbed wire and light tubes from professional wrestling matches in response to violent Xtreme Pro Wrestling and Combat Zone Wrestling events at the venue.

The building&#x27;s ownership evicted Xtreme Pro Wrestling from the venue in February 2003 after the promotion failed to make lease payments. Combat Zone Wrestling resumed running shows at the venue in March 2003, with Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling returning in November 2003.

===2004–2012: Roger Artigiani management===
====Peltz and Hand residency, 2004–2009====
Roger Artigiani became the venue&#x27;s general manager in 2004. That same year, the building&#x27;s name was officially changed to New Alhambra Sports &amp; Entertainment Center, which was later shortened to New Alhambra Arena in 2006. The name was suggested by J. Russell Peltz, who began co-promoting professional boxing cards at the venue with Joe Hand, Sr. in May 2004. It paid homage to the original Alhambra Movie Theater in South Philadelphia that hosted boxing in the 1950s and 1960s.

Renovations were undertaken at a cost of $500,000 to improve the building&#x27;s infrastructure and increase its suitability for boxing. A 16-foot boxing ring was installed at the insistence of J. Russell Peltz, who believed that the small dimensions would force boxers to engage with each other and make bouts more exciting. The venue&#x27;s bleachers were removed and replaced with folding chairs and skyboxes. Land was acquired for a 500-space parking lot that was built across from the venue under Interstate 95.

J. Russell Peltz and Joe Hand, Sr. announced in January 2009 that after a five-year partnership, they would stop promoting boxing cards at the venue and move their shows to The Blue Horizon. Although their claimed reason for leaving was a rent increase from $1,000 per month to $6,000 per month, the new rental fee was in actuality $2,500. The venue was then renamed to The Arena by general manager Roger Artigiani.

====Asylum Fight League naming rights, 2010–2012====

After The Blue Horizon closed in June 2010, J. Russell Peltz and Joe Hand, Sr. returned to once again promote boxing cards at the venue.

Roger Artigiani announced in October 2010 that mixed martial arts group Asylum Fight League had purchased the naming rights to the venue and renamed it Asylum Arena.

===2012–2013: Arena Operating LLC management===

Joanna Pang of the Trocadero Theatre (dba Arena Operating LLC) signed an exclusive lease with the venue in February 2012 with plans to renovate and convert it to a concert hall. Forced to relocate, Chikara moved their shows to Trocadero Theatre in Chinatown, while Combat Zone Wrestling moved their shows to Flyers Skate Zone in Voorhees Township, New Jersey.

Arena Operating LLC was evicted by the building&#x27;s ownership in April 2013 after Joanna Pang failed to complete her proposed renovations. Pang started the project but never completed it, leaving the venue stripped down to its bare walls.

===2013–present: Roger Artigiani management===

The venue reopened as 2300 Arena in May 2014, hosting a Peltz Boxing Promotions card for its soft launch. The name referenced a newly constructed entranceway at 2300 South Swanson Street, replacing the original entrance at 7 West Ritner Street.

Renovations were performed that saw a bar constructed in the lobby, with overall seating capacity rising to 1,300. The venue was modernized to accommodate conventions and other large events such as banquets and fashion shows.

Christy Bottie, an accomplished artist with Mural Arts Philadelphia and Roger Artigiani&#x27;s business partner, was responsible for designing the renovated venue.

==Notable events==

==Special features==

===Hardcore Hall of Fame===


The venue is home to the Hardcore Hall of Fame, which commemorates the careers of professional wrestlers and wrestling personalities who have contributed to the legacy of both 2300 Arena and hardcore wrestling. It was established in 2002 following the death of former Extreme Championship Wrestling star Rocco Rock, who suffered a fatal heart attack while driving to the venue for an appearance with Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling. Banners representing all inductees are on permanent display within the venue.

===Bar 2300===
The venue&#x27;s lobby contains Bar 2300, a bar with a capacity of 350 that provides service during events, and also hosts intimate concert performances. Vicki Pohl, niece of Bruce Montgomery, runs in-house catering.

Tributes to the venue&#x27;s past are represented by the bar&#x27;s decor, with paintings by artist Christy Bottie that commemorate prior wrestling and combat sport events. Bottie also painted a mural dedicated to Extreme Championship Wrestling in the men&#x27;s room, which has since become a popular photo op.

==Transportation access==
2300 Arena is located within two miles of both the Front Street exit (Exit 351) of Interstate 76, and the Columbus Boulevard exit (Exit 20) of Interstate 95.

On-street parking is available in front of the building on South Swanson Street, and to the side of the building on both West Ritner Street and Wolf Street.

SEPTA maintains bus stops located within walking distance from the venue, providing local service on Route 7 (Weccacoe Avenue and Wolf Street), Route 57 (2nd Street and West Ritner Street), and Route G (Oregon Avenue and Front Street).

<text>Save This House is the fourth studio album by Canadian folk rock band Spirit of the West, released on February 20, 1990, by Warner Music Canada.

It was the band&#x27;s first album for Warner Music Canada, and their first with Linda McRae. Although still a relatively traditional folk album, its release on a major label meant that it was the band&#x27;s first album to expand their fan base significantly beyond the folk music scene. The album was certified platinum in Canada and was the band&#x27;s mainstream commercial breakthrough.

The band toured Canada and Great Britain in support of this album. Their British tour was as a supporting act for The Wonder Stuff. Members of Spirit of the West appeared on that band&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Cheap Seats&quot; EP.

==Songs==
The album&#x27;s title track, an energetically percussive environmental anthem, was written by Geoffrey Kelly and John Mann in fifteen minutes before the band were to perform a new song on a CBC program. Linda McRae has said that the song was written from the perspective that if everyone looked at the world as each person&#x27;s individual house, then (we) would all take better care of it. The song was released as a single (at the band&#x27;s request) and was a notable hit for the band on campus radio.

The album&#x27;s best-known song is &quot;Home for a Rest&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Home for a Rest&quot; was also named the 22nd greatest Canadian song of all time on CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;50 Tracks: The Canadian Version&quot;.

<text>The Gezhouba Dam or Gezhouba Water Control Project () on the Yangtze River is located in the western suburbs of Yichang, in central China&#x27;s Hubei province. One of the largest run-of-the-river dams, it sits several kilometers upstream from downtown Yichang, just downstream of the fall of the Huangbo River into the Yangtze. Construction started on December 30, 1970 and ended on December 11, 1988. The dam has a total installed electrical capacity of .

After rushing out of Nanjin Pass (南津关, &quot;South Ford Pass&quot;), the Yangtze River slows down and widens from to about at the dam site. Two small islands, Gezhouba and Xiba, divided the river into three channels. There the Gezhouba Project was built.

The facility boasts a generating capacity of along with three ship locks, two power stations that generate of electricity annually. It has 27 gates of spillway, and a non-flowing Dam on both banks. The dam is long with a maximum height of . The reservoir has a total volume of .

The navigation lock on the third channel was, when built, among the 100 largest in the world. The lock chamber is long and wide, with a minimum draft of at the sill. It provides passage for 10,000 ton ships.

The construction of the Gezhouba Dam, and others on the Yangtze, is considered by scientists to be one of the main causes of the decline and extinction of the Chinese paddlefish.

<doc id="1209283" wikidata="Q3317355" url="?curid=1209283" title="Mizzou Arena">
<text>Mizzou Arena is an indoor arena located on the campus of the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Home to the school&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, the facility opened in November 2004 and replaced the Hearnes Center (which still hosts all other indoor events) as the school&#x27;s flagship indoor sports facility. The arena also serves as the Columbia-Jefferson City market&#x27;s venue for well-known &#x27;arena&#x27; acts such as Rascal Flatts, Luke Bryan and the Eagles. The arched-roof building seats 15,061, and is located just south of Hearnes and Memorial Stadium. The arena is host to Missouri State High School Activities Association championships for boys and girls basketball, as well as wrestling. The arena was originally known as Paige Sports Arena.

==About the arena==

Mizzou Arena also includes offices for the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s basketball programs, the Athletic Administration and Mizzou Arena&#x27;s Building Operations. For the basketball programs the arena also offers locker rooms, a 24-hour practice gym, weight and training facilities including a hydrotherapy pool, video classrooms with audio and video editing capabilities, and an academic study center.

Missouri basketball coach from 1967 to 1999, Norm Stewart, is the namesake of the arena&#x27;s playing court.

==History==
After protracted negotiations, a third of the venue&#x27;s $75 million cost was donated by Walmart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie and her husband Bill. It was initially named Paige Sports Arena after their daughter (who attended the University of Southern California rather than Mizzou, to much alumni and student criticism regarding the name), but the Lauries gave up their naming rights due to a term paper scandal involving that daughter shortly after the arena&#x27;s dedication. The name of the arena&#x27;s playing surface, Norm Stewart Court (in honor of Mizzou&#x27;s longtime men&#x27;s coach), was carried over from the basketball team&#x27;s previous home at the Hearnes Center with the arena&#x27;s opening in 2004.

In September 2014, the university announced renovations to the arena including new scoreboard infrastructure, improvements to the facility&#x27;s entryway and upgrades to the team&#x27;s locker room coming from a $1.5 million donation.

In June 2017, a former Mizzou athletics staffer was arrested on two felony charges after he allegedly drove a Volkswagen Passat through Mizzou Arena and onto Norm Stewart Court early that morning, causing an estimated $100,000 in damages.

Prior to the 2023-2024 basketball season, the gold seats inside the arena were removed and replaced with black seats.

<doc id="1209297" wikidata="Q1685402" url="?curid=1209297" title="Jean Bugatti">
<text>Jean Bugatti (&quot;né&quot; Gianoberto Maria Carlo Bugatti; 15 January 1909 – 11 August 1939) was an automotive designer and test engineer for Bugatti. He was the son of Bugatti&#x27;s founder Ettore Bugatti.

== Biography ==

Born in Cologne, Jean Bugatti was the eldest son of Ettore Bugatti. Soon after his birth the family moved to the village of Dorlisheim near Molsheim in Alsace, Germany, where his father built the new Bugatti automobile manufacturing plant. Born into a family of creative people, from boyhood he was interested in his father&#x27;s business. His grandfather Carlo Bugatti had lived in France for several years when he relocated from his native Milan to live in Paris. The Bugatti family were multilingual and in France, Gianoberto became known as Jean.

During World War I, the family lived in Milan, Italy. After the ceding of Alsace by Germany to France after the end of the war in 1919, the company became subject to French jurisdiction. By the late 1920s, young Jean Bugatti was an integral part of the company and had already demonstrated his vehicle design abilities. In 1932, at the age of twenty-three years, he did most of the design for the company&#x27;s Type 41 Royale. His body designs complemented his father&#x27;s engineering skill, making Bugatti one of the greatest names in automobile manufacturing. Additionally, Jean Bugatti designed four bodies for the Type 57, the Ventoux, Stelvio, Atalante and Atlantic models. Regarded as the finest of all the Bugatti touring models, the supercharged Bugatti 57 was debuted at the 1936 Paris Salon. Jean Bugatti also showed his engineering skills by working on new independent suspension systems to replace solid front axles and on twin-cam engine applications.

He frequently tested the company&#x27;s prototypes. On 11 August 1939, while testing the Type 57 tank-bodied racer which had just won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race that year, not far from the factory on the road near the village of Duppigheim, 30-year-old Jean Bugatti was killed when he lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a tree, after avoiding a cyclist. He is interred in the Bugatti family plot at the municipal cemetery in Dorlisheim. There is a monument to him at the site of his accident.

<doc id="1209300" wikidata="Q7053241" url="?curid=1209300" title="Norrbotten Armoured Battalion">
<text>The Norrbotten Armoured Battalion (), designation Pbat/I 19 or P 5, is a Swedish Army armoured battalion, one of the few new formations raised in the 20th century. It is still in active service, and is currently garrisoned in Boden, Norrbotten as part of Norrbotten Regiment.

==History==
The Norrbotten Armored Battalion (P 5) was raised on 1 April 1957, by decision through letters patent of 1 June 1956, based on a parliamentary decision in May 1956. The unit was raised to meet the needs of the armored units in Upper Norrland. On 30 June 1975, the battalion disbanded as an independent unit and on 1 July 1975 it was amalgamated into a training battalion in Norrbotten Regiment (I 19). The name of the regiment was changed to that of the Norrbotten Regiment with the Norrbotten Armored Battalion (I 19/P 5).

For a short time in the 1990s, the regiment ceased to exist as it was merged with the wartime organised Norrbotten Brigade. In 2000, the battalion was re-raised, this time as one of five battalions in Norrbotten Regiment, retaining its old name, but not the designation P 5 (5th Armoured Regiment) it originally had, even though it is still in common use. The battalion is as of 2006 one of the three Swedish Army training regiments for armoured units. The battalion has been garrisoned in Boden during its whole existence.

===Colours, standards and guidons===
The unit presents one battalion standard which was established by Army Order 417/1 1959. It was drawn by Brita Grep and embroidered by hand in insertion technique by Libraria. The standard was presented to the former Royal Norrbotten Armoured Battalion (P 5) in Boden by His Majesty the King Gustaf VI Adolf on 28 July 1961.

<text>Joseph R. Morrison (August 21, 1937 – February 5, 1989) was an American football player and coach. He played professionally as a running back and wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants from 1959 to 1972. Morrison served as the head football coach at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga from 1973 to 1979, at the University of New Mexico from 1980 to 1982, and at the University of South Carolina from 1983 to 1988, compiling a career college football coach record of 101–72–7.

==Playing career==
Morrison was born in Lima, Ohio. He attended the University of Cincinnati where he played both halfback and quarterback and also played on defense during his three varsity seasons. Morrison was drafted by the Giants in the third round of the 1959 NFL draft, where he mostly played at the positions of running back and wide receiver. He had a long career with the Giants, playing from 1959 to 1972. He is 3rd on the Giants&#x27; team record for receptions, with 395 catches, from seven different quarterbacks; over his career his plays gained 4,993 yards. His jersey number (#40) has been retired by the Giants.

Morrison&#x27;s best individual season as a receiver came in 1966 when the Giants won only one game. He caught 46 passes for 724 yards and scored six touchdowns. While the Giants fell on hard times, Morrison was one of the bright stars on the team. He also had five seasons of 40 receptions or more between 1964 and 1971.

Because he played many positions as needed for the Giants, he was nicknamed &quot;Old Dependable.&quot;

==Coaching career==
Joe Morrison was a head coach at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, University of New Mexico, and University of South Carolina. He is one of the few major college head coaches to never work as an assistant coach.
As the head coach at Chattanooga, Morrison turned around a Mocs program coming off four straight losing seasons, pacing them to three straight Southern Conference championships (1977–1979). His record at Chattanooga was 44–29–3 in seven seasons.

Other than his NFL years, he is best remembered as the head coach at South Carolina. Morrison came to USC after three seasons with the Lobos of the University of New Mexico. He was a hot prospect, having gone 10–1 in 1982. Morrison took the Gamecocks to three postseason games (1984 and 1987 Gator Bowl and the 1988 Liberty Bowl) during his tenure.

It was under Morrison in 1983 that South Carolina began the tradition of &quot;Einleitung&quot; from &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; (theme from the movie &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;) as its pre-game anthem and entrance song. The idea had actually originated with former quarterback Tommy Suggs, who suggested it to then-coach and athletic director Jim Carlen in 1981. However, Carlen wanted the Carolina Band to play it rather than have it played over the stadium&#x27;s sound system. When Carlen left after the season, Suggs took the idea to his successor as athletic director, Bob Marcum. While Marcum liked it, he suggested that they wait to play it until a brand-new sound system could be installed in 1982. The song was finally played for the first time in Morrison&#x27;s first year, and partly because of his success the song is identified with him.

Morrison&#x27;s second season, 1984, was until the turn of the century reckoned as the greatest in school history. It was affectionately dubbed the &quot;Black Magic&quot; year by South Carolina fans because of the team&#x27;s success and because of Morrison&#x27;s famous all-black attire (cap, shirt, pants). The team ran a streak of nine consecutive wins (longest single season streak in school history) and was ranked #2 in the nation before being upset by Navy and later falling to Oklahoma State University in the Gator Bowl. Gaining victories against storied programs such as Georgia, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, Florida State, and arch-rival Clemson, the Gamecocks finished that season with a 10–2 record, which would remain a school record for wins until 2011. Morrison was named by the Walter Camp Foundation as the 1984 National College Football Coach of the Year. Morrison would also be named the Independent Coach of the Year in 1987. The 1984 squad also heralded two first-team All-American players in James Seawright (linebacker) and Del Wilkes (offensive lineman), as well as future NFL players Sterling Sharpe (1984–1987), and Brad Edwards (1984–1987).

Other notable players coached by Morrison included Harold Green, who spent several years with the Cincinnati Bengals in the NFL, current Gamecock football radio broadcaster Todd Ellis, who is the all-time passing leader at South Carolina, and Robert Brooks, who was part of the Green Bay Packers 1997 Super Bowl Championship team. During this time, Charlie Weis, former head coach of the University of Notre Dame and the University of Kansas, was an assistant coach under Morrison, his first coaching job in the college ranks. Also serving as an assistant during Morrison&#x27;s tenure was Al Groh, who went on to be head coach of the New York Jets and the University of Virginia.

After back-to-back 8–4 season in 1987 and 1988, expectations were high in Columbia for the 1989 campaign. However, it would not come to pass as Morrison collapsed after playing racquetball at a court located inside Williams-Brice Stadium, and died on February 5, 1989, at age 51 from congestive heart failure.

Morrison won his 100th game as a coach in 1988, when South Carolina beat N.C. State 23–7.

==Head coaching record==








==Legacy==
Todd Ellis, who played quarterback for Morrison, summarized his former coach&#x27;s legacy at South Carolina: &quot;Coach Spurrier was an icon before coming here, but there’s a part of the South Carolina community that takes pride in the fact coach Morrison was successful and did it here first. He made South Carolina stand out for the first time. He provided an edge; he made it cool to play at Carolina.&quot;

Morrison&#x27;s legacy still is in place at the University of South Carolina in various ways:
* Black jerseys are part of uniform options in football and other sports.
** Morrison began the use of black jerseys as a uniform option and used them as the team&#x27;s primary home jerseys during the 1987 and 1988 seasons.
* The use of &quot;Einleitung&quot; from &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;, Op. 30 (theme from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;) was a tradition started by Morrison for the football team&#x27;s pre-game entrance and is still done so today. The theme has been spread to other sports and university functions.
* The offensive MVP of the football spring game every year is designated the Joe Morrison Offensive Player of the Spring.
* The football team&#x27;s senior defensive MVP every year is awarded the Joe Morrison Award.
* Todd Ellis, who was recruited by Morrison and played most of his college career under Morrison, has been the &quot;Voice of the Gamecocks&quot; since 2003, serving as the play-by-play announcer for South Carolina&#x27;s football radio coverage.
* The USC Sumter athletic teams are known as the &quot;Fire Ants&quot;, named after Morrison&#x27;s 1984 defense.
* He still holds the record for highest ranking ever achieved by South Carolina in football: No. 2 in 1984.

<text>Old Material 1984–1986 is the first compilation album by Canadian folk rock group Spirit of the West, released in November 1989 by Stony Plain Records.

It was the band&#x27;s final release for Stony Plain Records. Side one of the album includes five tracks from their out-of-print 1984 album &quot;Spirit of the West&quot;, and side two presents a 1986 live performance from the Vancouver East Cultural Centre.

The live performance showcases a band already quite skilled at the crowd-pleasing sense of showmanship that would become their trademark, especially when John Mann flubs the beginning of &quot;General Guinness&quot; from laughing too hard at the clownish antics of bandmates J. Knutson and Geoffrey Kelly.

<doc id="1209320" wikidata="Q2323930" url="?curid=1209320" title="St Giles-without-Cripplegate">
<text>St Giles-without-Cripplegate is an Anglican church in the City of London, located on Fore Street within the modern Barbican complex. When built it stood without (that is, outside) the city wall, near the Cripplegate. The church is dedicated to St Giles, patron saint of handicapped and infirm people of many different kinds. It is one of the few medieval churches left in the City of London, having survived the Great Fire of 1666.

==History==
There had been a Saxon church on the site in the 11th century but by 1090 it had been replaced by a Norman one. In 1394 it was rebuilt in the perpendicular gothic style during the reign of Richard II. The stone tower was added in 1682.
The church has been badly damaged by fire on three occasions: In 1545, in 1897 and during an air raid of the Blitz of the Second World War . German bombs completely gutted the church but it was restored using the plans of the reconstruction of 1545. A new ring of twelve bells was cast by Mears and Stainbank in 1954, and this was augmented with a sharp second bell cast in 2006 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The historic pews, altar and font come from the nearby St Luke Old Street, and were transferred to St Giles when it closed and the parishes were amalgamated in 1959.

The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

<text>Irish Sign Language (ISL, ) is the sign language of Ireland, used primarily in the Republic of Ireland. It is also used in Northern Ireland, alongside British Sign Language (BSL). Irish Sign Language is more closely related to French Sign Language (LSF) than to BSL, though it has influence from both languages. It has influenced sign languages in Australia and South Africa, and has little relation to either spoken Irish or English. ISL is unique among sign languages for having different gendered versions due to men and women being taught it at different schools all over Ireland.

==Development==
The earliest known references to signing in Ireland come from the 18th century. According to Ethnologue, the language has influence from both French Sign Language (LSF) and British Sign Language (BSL), as well as from signed French and signed English, BSL having been introduced in Dublin in 1816. The first school for deaf children in Ireland, the Claremont Institution, was established in 1816 by Dr. Charles Orpen. According to admission documents between 1816 and 1822, about half of the students admitted already knew some form of signing. Conama and Leonard suggest that this points to evidence of an older, undocumented form of ISL.

The Claremont Institution was a Protestant institution and given that Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom, it is no surprise that BSL (or some version of signed English based in BSL) was used for teaching and learning (Pollard 2006). St. Mary&#x27;s School for Deaf Girls sent two teachers and two students to Caen in France for 6 months; the students there likely learned LSF, which likely influenced ISL when the students returned to Ireland. McDonnell (1979) reports that the Irish institutions - Catholic and Protestant - did not teach the children to speak and it was not until 1887 that Claremont report changing from a manual to an oral approach. For the Catholic schools, the shift to oralism came later: St. Mary&#x27;s School for Deaf Girls moved to an oral approach in 1946 and St. Joseph&#x27;s School for Deaf Boys shifted to oralism in 1956, though this did not become formal state policy until 1972. Sign language use was seriously suppressed and religion was used to further stigmatise the language (e.g. children were encouraged to give up signing for Lent and sent to confession if caught signing). The fact that the Catholic schools are segregated on the basis of gender led to the development of a gendered-generational variant of Irish Sign Language that is still evident (albeit to a lesser degree) today.

ISL was brought by Catholic missionaries to Australia, and to Scotland and England, with remnants of ISL still visible in some variants of BSL, especially in Glasgow, and with some elderly Auslan Catholics still using ISL today. In South Africa, the Dominican nuns who established Catholic Schools saw a need for a school for the deaf, but due to resource constraints were not in a position to do this immediately. Instead, they wrote back to their Mother House in Cabra requesting an experienced teacher of the deaf. A deaf teacher, Bridget Lynne, responded. Remnants of gendered generational Irish Sign Language are thought to still be visible in some dialects of South African Sign Language, which can probably be traced back to Lynne.

==Oireachtas bill==
The &quot;Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016&quot; passed all stages in the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) on 14 December 2017, and was signed into law under the revised title, The Irish Sign Language Act 2017. The Act was signed into law by the President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on 24 December 2017. The Act, which commenced on December 23, 2020, requires that public services are available through ISL and also outlines the need for greater access to education through sign language. Prior to the passage, there was no automatic right for deaf people to have an ISL interpreter (except for criminal court proceedings). For the deaf community, recognition of ISL means more legal rights and better access to public services - including education, healthcare, media and banking.

==Language code==
The ISO 639-3 code for Irish Sign Language is &#x27;isg&#x27;; &#x27;isl&#x27; is the code for Icelandic.

<text>The Lost Opera (also stylized The Lost O?era) is an album by the Korean soprano Kimera and the Operaiders with the London Symphony Orchestra. Consisting of snatches of popular operatic arias and choruses against a disco beat, in the style of the &quot;Hooked on Classics&quot; album, it was released in 1984 by the record label Red Bus. Whilst not a major UK success, it spent some sixteen weeks in the French charts. It was repackaged in a style more disco than classical in 1985 and reissued with the more descriptive title &quot;Hits on Opera&quot;, and with a more techno-style cover illustration, but it gained little additional interest. Being neither one thing nor the other, however, its audience was bound to be divided and it may be regarded as an experiment belonging to its time.

<text>Paul Grüninger (; 27 October 1891 – 22 February 1972) was a Swiss police commander in St. Gallen. He was recognized as one of the Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial foundation in 1971. Following the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot;, Grüninger saved about 3,600 Jewish refugees by backdating their visas and falsifying other documents to indicate that they had entered Switzerland at a time when legal entry of refugees was still possible. He was dismissed from the police force, convicted of official misconduct, and fined 300 Swiss francs. He received no pension and died in poverty in 1972.

== Early life ==
Grüninger attended a teacher preparatory school from 1907 to 1911. He also played football semi-professionally. In 1913 he joined SC Brühl and was part of the squad that won the 1915 Swiss first division title. Following completion of the military service, in 1919 he joined the police corps of the canton of St. Gallen.

== Rescue of Jews ==
Grüninger was police commander of the Canton of St. Gallen that borders Germany and Austria. Following the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Switzerland had closed its border to Jewish people arriving without proper entry permits, and in October 1938 negotiations between Switzerland and Germany led to the stamping of a &#x27;J&#x27; in issued to Jewish people.

As the number of refugees who tried to enter Switzerland illegally increased, Grüninger decided in the summer of 1938 to not send them back, facing the consequence of breaching explicit government instructions. To legalize the refugees&#x27; status, he falsified visas so that their passports showed that they had arrived in Switzerland before March 1938, when immigration to Switzerland had been restricted. This enabled newly arrived Jewish refugees to be taken to Diepoldsau camp to await permits for a temporary stay. Grüninger falsified reports about the number of arrivals and status of refugees in his canton. He also used his own funds to provide some of them with winter clothing.

The Swiss federal government initiated an investigation, whereupon Grüninger was dismissed by the government without notice in March 1939. Grüninger&#x27;s trial at the district court of St. Gallen opened in January 1939 and dragged over two years. In March 1941 the court found him guilty of &quot;breach of duty&quot;, &quot;official misconduct and forgery to a fine&quot;. His retirement benefits were forfeited, and he was cashiered, fined and had to pay the trial costs. The court recognized his altruistic motivations, but found that nevertheless, as a state employee, it was his duty to follow his instructions.

== Later life ==

Ostracized and forgotten, Grüninger lived for the rest of his life in difficult circumstances. Despite the difficulties, he never regretted his action on behalf of the Jews. In 1954 he explained his motives:

In December 1970 as a result of protest in the media, the Swiss government sent Grüninger &quot;a somewhat reserved letter of apology, but refrained from reopening his case and reinstating his pension&quot;. Ostracized and accused and slandered as a womanizer and corrupt fraudster, even as a Nazi by some people in the 2000s, the former chief of police for the rest of his life was no longer fixed point: Grüninger died in 1972, nearly forgotten in Switzerland, without rehabilitation by the Swiss authorities. Two months before his death, West German President Gustav Heinemann gave him a color television.

The mortal remains of Grüninger were cremated and his urn buried at the cemetery of Au, a small town in the canton of St. Gallen where he resided. His wife Alice, née Federer in 1897, died in 1984 and her urn was buried next to his. The simple tombstone bears only their names and the year numbers of their births and deaths. In 2008, the artist Norbert Möslang, who hails from St. Gallen, created a three-dimensional text sculpture, which reads:&quot;Paul Grüninger / rettete / 1938/39 / viele hundert / Flüchtlinge&quot; (Paul Grüninger rescued in 1938/39 many hundreds of refugees&quot;)Eight years later, the couple&#x27;s urns were reburied as part of the cemetery renovation. The grave had previously been located on the left side of the northern rear wall of the cemetery, but was now relocated to the middle on the initiative of the Municipal Council in order to upgrade it to a memorial in a central location. This project was co-funded by the local congregation of the Protestant Reformed Church.

== Rehabilitation and Righteous Among the Nations ==
After his death, Grüninger&#x27;s fate was brought back partially into the public memory by some publications beginning in 1984, and steps to rehabilitate him were set into motion. The first attempt was rejected by the Swiss Council, and only as late as 1995, the Swiss federal Government finally annulled Grüninger&#x27;s conviction: the district court of St. Gallen revoked the judgment against him and cleared him of all charges. Three years later the government of the Canton of St. Gallen paid compensation to his descendants, and in 1999 also the so-called Bergier Commission&#x27;s report took part in Grüninger&#x27;s rehabilitation, as well to rehabilitate the surviving people who had been convicted during the National Socialist period in Switzerland for their assistance to refugees – 137 women and men received public rehabilitation up to 2009.

In 1971, the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial foundation in Israel honoured Grüninger as one of the Righteous Among the Nations. A street located in the northern Jerusalem neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev has been named after him.

<doc id="1209346" wikidata="Q3022111" url="?curid=1209346" title="Bicyclic semigroup">
<text>In mathematics, the bicyclic semigroup is an algebraic object important for the structure theory of semigroups. Although it is in fact a monoid, it is usually referred to as simply a semigroup. It is perhaps most easily understood as the syntactic monoid describing the Dyck language of balanced pairs of parentheses. Thus, it finds common applications in combinatorics, such as describing binary trees and associative algebras.

== History ==

The first published description of this object was given by Evgenii Lyapin in 1953. Alfred H. Clifford and Gordon Preston claim that one of them, working with David Rees, discovered it independently (without publication) at some point before 1943.

== Construction ==

There are at least three standard ways of constructing the bicyclic semigroup, and various notations for referring to it. Lyapin called it &quot;P&quot;; Clifford and Preston used formula_1; and most recent papers have tended to use &quot;B&quot;. This article will use the modern style throughout.

=== From a free semigroup ===

The bicyclic semigroup is the quotient of the free monoid on two generators &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; by the congruence generated by the relation . Thus, each semigroup element is a string of those two letters, with the proviso that the subsequence &quot;&quot; does not appear. 
The semigroup operation is concatenation of strings, which is clearly associative. 
It can then be shown that all elements of &quot;B&quot; in fact have the form , for some natural numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. The composition operation simplifies to
: (&quot;q&quot;&quot;a&quot; &quot;p&quot;&quot;b&quot;) (&quot;q&quot;&quot;c&quot; &quot;p&quot;&quot;d&quot;) = &quot;q&quot;&quot;a&quot;+&quot;c&quot;−min{&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;} &quot;p&quot;&quot;d&quot;+&quot;b&quot;−min{&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;}.

=== From ordered pairs ===

The way in which these exponents are constrained suggests that the &quot;&quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; structure&quot; can be discarded, leaving only operations on the &quot;&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;&quot; part. 
So &quot;B&quot; is the semigroup of pairs of natural numbers (including zero), with operation
: (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) = (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;c&quot; − min{&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}, &quot;d&quot; + &quot;b&quot; − min{&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}).
This is sufficient to define &quot;B&quot; so that it is the same object as in the original construction. Just as &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; generated &quot;B&quot; originally, with the empty string as the monoid identity, this new construction of &quot;B&quot; has generators and , with identity .

=== From functions ===

It can be shown that &quot;any&quot; semigroup &quot;S&quot; generated by elements &quot;e&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;b&quot; that satisfies the statements below is isomorphic to the bicyclic semigroup.
* &quot;a&quot; &quot;e&quot; = &quot;e&quot; &quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot;
* &quot;b&quot; &quot;e&quot; = &quot;e&quot; &quot;b&quot; = &quot;b&quot;
* &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; = &quot;e&quot;
* &quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;e&quot;
It is not entirely obvious that this should be the case – perhaps the hardest task is understanding that &quot;S&quot; must be infinite. To see this, suppose that &quot;a&quot; (say) does not have infinite order, so for some &quot;h&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. Then , and
: &quot;b&quot; = &quot;e&quot; &quot;b&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; &quot;b&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 &quot;e&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1,
so 
: &quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; = &quot;e&quot;,
which is not allowed – so there are infinitely many distinct powers of &quot;a&quot;. The full proof is given in Clifford and Preston&#x27;s book.

Note that the two definitions given above both satisfy these properties. A third way of deriving &quot;B&quot; uses two appropriately-chosen functions to yield the bicyclic semigroup as a monoid of transformations of the natural numbers. Let &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, and &quot;ι&quot; be elements of the transformation semigroup on the natural numbers, where
* &quot;ι&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;
* &quot;α&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot; + 1
* &quot;β&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 0 if &quot;n&quot; = 0, and &quot;n&quot; − 1 otherwise.
These three functions have the required properties, so the semigroup they generate is &quot;B&quot;.

== Properties ==

The bicyclic semigroup has the property that the image of any homomorphism &quot;φ&quot; from &quot;B&quot; to another semigroup &quot;S&quot; is either cyclic, or it is an isomorphic copy of &quot;B&quot;. The elements &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;), &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) and &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) of &quot;S&quot; will always satisfy the conditions above (because &quot;φ&quot; is a homomorphism) with the possible exception that might turn out to be φ(&quot;e&quot;). If this is not true, then &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) is isomorphic to &quot;B&quot;; otherwise, it is the cyclic semigroup generated by &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;). In practice, this means that the bicyclic semigroup can be found in many different contexts.

The idempotents of &quot;B&quot; are all pairs , where &quot;x&quot; is any natural number (using the ordered pair characterisation of &quot;B&quot;). Since these commute, and &quot;B&quot; is &quot;regular&quot; (for every &quot;x&quot; there is a &quot;y&quot; such that ), the bicyclic semigroup is an inverse semigroup. (This means that each element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;B&quot; has a unique inverse &quot;y&quot;, in the &quot;weak&quot; semigroup sense that and .)

Every ideal of &quot;B&quot; is principal: the left and right principal ideals of are
* (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) &quot;B&quot; = {(&quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) : &quot;s&quot; ≥ &quot;m&quot;} and
* &quot;B&quot; (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) = {(&quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) : &quot;t&quot; ≥ &quot;n&quot;}.
Each of these contains infinitely many others, so &quot;B&quot; does not have minimal left or right ideals.

In terms of Green&#x27;s relations, &quot;B&quot; has only one &quot;D&quot;-class (it is &quot;bisimple&quot;), and hence has only one &quot;J&quot;-class (it is &quot;simple&quot;). The &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot; relations are given by
* (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) &quot;R&quot; (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) if and only if ; and
* (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) &quot;L&quot; (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) if and only if .
This implies that two elements are &quot;H&quot;-related if and only if they are identical. Consequently, the only subgroups of &quot;B&quot; are infinitely many copies of the trivial group, each corresponding to one of the idempotents.

The egg-box diagram for &quot;B&quot; is infinitely large; the upper left corner begins:
Each entry represents a singleton &quot;H&quot;-class; the rows are the &quot;R&quot;-classes and the columns are &quot;L&quot;-classes. The idempotents of &quot;B&quot; appear down the diagonal, in accordance with the fact that in a regular semigroup with commuting idempotents, each &quot;L&quot;-class and each &quot;R&quot;-class must contain exactly one idempotent.

The bicyclic semigroup is the &quot;simplest&quot; example of a bisimple inverse semigroup with identity; there are many others. Where the definition of &quot;B&quot; from ordered pairs used the class of natural numbers (which is not only an additive semigroup, but also a commutative lattice under min and max operations), another set with appropriate properties could appear instead, and the &quot;+&quot;, &quot;−&quot; and &quot;max&quot; operations modified accordingly.

<doc id="1209357" wikidata="Q36388" url="?curid=1209357" title="Nubi language">
<text>The Nubi language (also called Ki-Nubi, ) is a Sudanese Arabic-based creole language spoken in Uganda around Bombo, and in Kenya around Kibera, by the Ugandan Nubians, many of whom are descendants of Emin Pasha&#x27;s Sudanese soldiers who were settled there by the British colonial administration. It was spoken by about 15,000 people in Uganda in 1991 (according to the census), and an estimated 10,000 in Kenya; another source estimates about 50,000 speakers as of 2001. 90% of the lexicon derives from Arabic, but the grammar has been simplified, as has the sound system. Nairobi has the greatest concentration of Nubi speakers. Nubi has the prefixing, suffixing and compounding processes also present in Arabic.

Many Nubi speakers are Kakwa who came from the Nubian region, first into Equatoria, and from there southwards into Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They rose to prominence under Ugandan President Idi Amin, who was Kakwa.

Jonathan Owens argues that Nubi constitutes a major counterexample to Derek Bickerton&#x27;s theories of creole language formation, showing &quot;no more than a chance resemblance to Bickerton&#x27;s universal creole features&quot; despite fulfilling perfectly the historical conditions expected to lead to such features.
Scholars (Sebit, 2023) have suggested that the Nubi Language was the main point of unity among the Nubi community in east Africa, to survive the hardship they experienced from different community components.

== Phonology ==
===Vowels===
There are five vowels in Nubi. Vowels are not distinguished by length except in at least two exceptions from Kenyan Nubi (which are not present in Ugandan dialects) where means &quot;outside&quot; and is an adverb while means &quot;the outside&quot; and is a noun, and also where meaning &quot;bewitch&quot; is compared to meaning &quot;&quot;herd, cattle&quot;.&quot; Despite this, there is a tendency for vowels in stressed syllables to be registered as long vowels.

Each of the vowels has multiple allophones and the exact sound of the vowel depends on the surrounding consonants.

====Consonants====
Speakers may use Standard Arabic phonemes for words for which the Arabic pronunciation has been learned. The retroflex version of the /r/ sound may also occur and some dialects use /l/ in its place. Geminates are very unusual in Nubi. These less common phonemes are shown in brackets.

Ineke Wellens gives the following orthography for Nubi where it differs from the IPA symbols: // = sh; /t/ = ch; // = j; // = ny; /w/ = w or u; /j/ = y or i; // = th; // = dh; /x/ = kh; // = ḥ.

==== Syllable Structure ====
Syllables typically have a CV, VC, V or CVC structure with VC only occurring in initial syllables. Final and initial CC occur only in a few specific examples such as which means &quot;school&quot; or which means &quot;sun&quot;.

Stress can change the meaning of words for example means &quot;seven&quot; or &quot;morning&quot; depending on whether the stress is on the first or second syllables respectively. Vowels are often omitted in unstressed, final syllables and sometime even the stressed final &quot;u&quot; in the passive form may be deleted after &quot;&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;f&quot; or &quot;b&quot;.&quot; This can cause syllables to be realigned even across words.

==Grammar==
=== Nominals ===
Nouns are inflected by number only (taking a singular or plural form) although for most nouns this does not represent a morphological change. Jonathan Owens gives 5 broad inflectional categories of nouns:
# Nouns which undergo a stress shift when the plural is formed.
# Nouns which undergo apophony.
# Nouns which take a suffix and undergo a stress shift in the plural form.
# Nouns which form the plural by suppletion
# Bantu loan-words which take different prefixes in the singular and plural forms
The table below shows examples of each type of pluralisation. The apostrophe has been placed before the stressed syllable:

1 may be supplemented by a suffix as if it were type 3, thus, could also mean &quot;&quot;women&quot;.&quot;

Adjectives follow the noun and some adjectives have singular and plural forms which must agree with the noun. Adjectives may also take the prefixes , , or which mark them as habitual. Possessor nouns follow the possessed, with a particle placed in between. In the case of inalienable possession the particle is omitted.

<text>Rembrandt Bugatti (16 October 1884 – 8 January 1916) was an Italian sculptor, known primarily for his bronze sculptures of wildlife subjects. During World War I, he volunteered for paramedical work at a military hospital in Antwerp, an experience that triggered in Bugatti the onset of depression, aggravated by financial problems, which eventually caused him to commit suicide on 8 January 1916 in Paris, France when he was 31 years old.

==Early life==
Born in Milan into an artistic family, Rembrandt Bugatti was the second son of Carlo Bugatti and his wife, Teresa Lorioli. His older brother Ettore Bugatti became a famous automobile manufacturer.

He was given his first name by his uncle, painter Giovanni Segantini. His father was an Art Nouveau furniture and jewelry designer who also worked in textiles, ceramics, and silver metalware. As such, Rembrandt Bugatti grew up in an environment where a great many of his parents&#x27; friends were from the artistic world. In 1902, the family moved to Paris, where they lived in a community of artisans.

As a child, he hung around his father&#x27;s workshop and was encouraged to try sculpting in plasticine by a family friend, Russian sculptor Prince Paolo Troubetzkoy (1866–1938).

==Work==

Rembrandt Bugatti was a young man when he began to work with the art foundry and gallery owner, Adrian Hébrard. He produced a number of bronzes, which were exhibited and promoted by Hébrard. Bugatti&#x27;s love of nature led to him spending a great deal of time in the wildlife sanctuary near the Jardin des Plantes in Paris or at the Antwerp Zoo, where he studied the features and movement of exotic animals. His sculptures of animals such as elephants, panthers, and lions became his most well-known works.

The elephant mascot that sits on top of the radiator of the Bugatti Royale was cast from one of Rembrandt&#x27;s original sculptures.

His art works are now highly priced. A cast of his 1909–1910 bronze, &quot;Babouin Sacré Hamadryas&quot; (Sacred hamadryas baboon), was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2006 for $2.56 million. In May 2010, the &quot;Babouin&quot; reappeared at auction at Sotheby&#x27;s (est. $2/3 million), along with a male and female &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Lionne de Nubie&quot; (est. $1.5/2 million and $1.2/1.8 million, respectively), a &quot;Grande girafe tête basse&quot; (est. $1/1.5 million) and seven other pieces from the S. Joel Schur Collection, perhaps the finest collection of masterpieces by Bugatti in private hands according to one report. One of the Bugatti pieces was reported sold apparently as part of a group of sculptures (with three Rodin and a Noguchi) for an aggregate of $20 million.

==Later life and death==
His work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics. During World War I, he volunteered for paramedical work at a military hospital in Antwerp, an experience that triggered in Bugatti the onset of depression, aggravated by financial problems arising because now he was no longer able to give so much time to his artistic work. At the same time, Antwerp Zoo was forced, by feedstuff shortages, to start killing its animals, which deeply affected Bugatti because he had used many of them as subjects for his sculpture. In 1916, at the age of 31, he committed suicide. He is interred in the Bugatti family plot at the municipal cemetery in Dorlisheim in the Bas-Rhin département of the Alsace region of France.

<text>Ronald Saunders (6 November 1932 – 7 December 2019) was an English football player and manager. He played for Everton, Tonbridge Angels, Gillingham, Portsmouth, Watford and Charlton Athletic during a 16-year playing career, before moving into management. He managed seven clubs in 20 years, and he was the first manager to have taken charge of Aston Villa, Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion, the three rival clubs based in and around the city of Birmingham.

Saunders also managed Yeovil Town, Oxford United, Norwich City and Manchester City. He was involved in football for 36 consecutive years; he left his final managerial role, at West Bromwich Albion, at the age of 54.

==Playing career==
As a player, he was an old-fashioned, hard-shooting centre forward who scored 246 goals in 16 years for Everton, Tonbridge Angels, Gillingham, Portsmouth, Watford and Charlton Athletic. Saunders was leading goalscorer for six consecutive seasons at Portsmouth and his goals were a key factor in helping Pompey win the Third Division title in 1962. He remains their third highest goalscorer. He retired from full-time playing in 1967, when with Charlton.

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
Saunders became player-manager at non-league Yeovil Town.

===Norwich City===
As a manager, Saunders first tasted success at Norwich City, guiding them to the Second Division title in 1972, which saw them promoted to the First Division for the first time in their history. Saunders steered Norwich City to survival in their first season in the top flight. They also reached the Football League Cup final, losing 1–0 to Tottenham Hotspur. He resigned as Norwich manager on 17 November 1973 following a boardroom row after a 3–1 home defeat to Everton.

===Manchester City===
Five days later, Saunders accepted an offer to take over at Manchester City. For the second season running Saunders managed a team to the Football League Cup final, but once again they lost – this time to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite their cup success, City&#x27;s league form was shaky, and Saunders was dismissed three weeks before the end of the season. He did not stay out of work for long however, and the following month joined Second Division side Aston Villa as manager.

===Aston Villa===
Saunders guided Villa to promotion to the First Division (as runners-up in the Second Division) in his first season as manager, also winning the League Cup. He became the first manager to take three clubs to the League Cup Final in three successive years. He re-established Villa as a top First Division club, winning the League Cup again in 1977. In 1980–81, he guided Villa to their first First Division title for 71 years.

He resigned from Villa on 9 February 1982, due to a disagreement with the board over his contract. At the time, Villa were mid-table in the First Division and had reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup. His assistant Tony Barton took over, and led them to victory in the 1982 European Cup Final four months later.

===Birmingham City===
Saunders moved straight to Villa&#x27;s local rivals, Birmingham City. They went down in 1984 but he got them back into the top flight at the first attempt. In January 1986, Saunders walked out on struggling Birmingham to take charge of local rivals and fellow strugglers West Bromwich Albion.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Saunders was unable to stop Albion from sliding into the Second Division and was dismissed in September 1987, after failing to get them back into the First Division. This was his last managerial role.

===Retirement===
In a friendly fixture staged as a testimonial for the recently deceased Tony Barton, Saunders appeared at Villa Park in 1994 as manager of a Villa side drawn mostly from players who had played in the European Cup final in 1982, against a West Midlands all-stars side. This was the first time he had returned to the club since his resignation some 13 years earlier. In December 2006, the 74-year-old Saunders was the guest of honour at Villa Park for the match between Aston Villa and Manchester United, invited by new chairman Randy Lerner. He returned to Villa Park shortly after, on 5 May 2007, for the 25th anniversary celebrations of the 1982 European Cup win.

==Death==
Saunders died on 7 December 2019, aged 87.

Walton was born on May 15, 1951. She is the younger daughter of Bud Walton, the brother and business partner of Walmart founder Sam Walton. She grew up in Versailles, Missouri, where she met future husband Bill Laurie. At Bud&#x27;s death, she and her sister Ann Walton Kroenke inherited a stake in Walmart that made them both billionaires.

==Philanthropy==
With her husband, she donated US$25 million to the University of Missouri for the construction of a new sports arena for the Missouri Tigers in 2001, to be named after their daughter Paige Laurie, who did not attend the university. However, it was revealed shortly after the 2004–05 basketball season started that Paige Laurie paid her USC roommate to do much of her homework for her, even after the roommate left the university due to financial issues. The Lauries gave up the naming rights on November 23, 2004, to the university, which then renamed the arena with the university&#x27;s common nickname &quot;Mizzou&quot; and removed all mention of Elizabeth Paige Laurie from the venue, beyond the bare minimum required to acknowledge the Lauries&#x27; gift. They have also endowed the E. Paige Laurie Professorship for the Equine Center at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Missouri. According to &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, they have also made charitable gifts for &quot;a cancer research center&quot; and &quot;a shelter for abused women&quot; and &quot;a children&#x27;s hospital.&quot;

Laurie is the founder of the Nancy Walton Laurie Leadership Institute at the Chi Omega sorority. She was the president and founder of a New York City dance company called the Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet, which closed in 2015. She is the owner of the Columbia Performing Arts Centre, a dance studio located in Columbia, Missouri.

==Personal life==
Laurie married Bill Laurie, after a courtship that occurred when they both attended the University of Memphis (then known as Memphis State University).

The couple resides primarily in the Las Vegas Valley, owning a mansion in Henderson, Nevada and Bel Air, California. They also have homes in Columbia, Missouri, where they own an equine farm where they breed appaloosa horses, and Bel Air, California. In January 2015, she filed a lawsuit through her company, LW Partnership, against Mohamed Hadid, a property developer who is building a retaining wall next to the Bel Air house, alleging Hadid damaged the roots of a eucalyptus tree. According to the Center for Investigative Reporting, Walton uses &quot;at least 2.3 million gallons (8.7 million liters) per year&quot; to water her Bel Air estate.

Laurie owns a superyacht called &quot;Kaos&quot;, on which she cruised to the UK in May 2023. In July 2023, &quot;Kaos&quot; was sprayed with paint by members of &quot;Futuro Vegetal&quot; a Spanish climate movement in the port of Ibiza. The members of &quot;Futuro Vegetal&quot; showed a poster saying &quot;You consume - others suffer&quot;.

<text>Mario Ancona (28 February 1860 – 23 February 1931), was a leading Italian baritone and master of bel canto singing. He appeared at some of the most important opera houses in Europe and America during what is commonly referred to as the &quot;Golden Age of Opera&quot;.

==Career==
Ancona was born into a middle-class Jewish family at Livorno, Tuscany, on 28 February 1860. After embarking on a business career he decided to study voice with a local singing teacher named Matteini in his native city of Livorno. Later, he took lessons from Giuseppe Cima in Milan.

Ancona is reputed to have made his debut as an amateur singer in 1880; but according to &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera&quot;—from which many of the ensuing appearance dates, venues and career highlights are taken—his earliest known professional appearance in an opera did not occur until 1889, when he sang the role of Scindia in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot; in Trieste. Not long afterwards, he appeared in another Massenet opera, &quot;Le Cid&quot;, at Italy&#x27;s principal theatre—La Scala, Milan. His arrival at La Scala so soon after his debut reflects the excellence of the technical grounding that he must have received as an amateur performer.

On 21 May 1892, Ancona was asked to create the part of Silvio in the first performance of Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, which took place at Milan&#x27;s Teatro Dal Verme with Arturo Toscanini conducting. The next year, he appeared in the first London performance of &quot;Pagliacci&quot; at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. On this occasion, however, he sang the role of Tonio. (Soprano Nellie Melba and tenor Fernando De Lucia were also in the high-quality cast.)

Ancona would appear regularly at Covent Garden until 1901, being held in high esteem by London audiences. He also sang as a guest artist in Cairo, Lisbon, Madrid, Warsaw, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Chicago, Boston and Buenos Aires.

The New York Metropolitan Opera first engaged him in 1893. He sang successfully at the Met until 1897, when he went back to Europe. In 1906–1908, he returned to New York—this time to join the Manhattan Opera Company, where he was paid a generous fee. He became a special favourite of this company, which had been established by Oscar Hammerstein I in direct rivalry to the Met. His suave interpretation of Mozart&#x27;s Don Giovanni was singled out for particular praise by newspaper reviewers and the Manhattan&#x27;s audiences.

Ancona sang in Paris in 1908, and again in 1914, at the Sarah Bernhardt theatre, where he was complimented by Bernhardt in person for his impressive singing. The illustrious French actress was not alone in her admiration for Ancona&#x27;s vocal artistry. Music critics on both sides of the Atlantic commended Ancona on his elegant singing style and beautiful voice, with its easy top register and open-throated emission of homogeneous tone. Indeed, the great tenor Jean de Reszke called him the best-schooled Italian baritone of his era. His histrionic skills were less developed however, and he was not considered to be an especially imaginative or exciting interpretive artist. Physically, he was said to resemble King Edward VII of England because of his pointed beard and ample waistline.

The fact that Ancona was able to establish himself as a major singer in the face of intense competition from a host of other first-class baritones is a testament to his sheer quality as a vocalist. His main Italian rivals in the period between his debut in 1889 and the outbreak of World War I were: Mattia Battistini, Antonio Scotti, Giuseppe Pacini, Antonio Magini-Coletti, Giuseppe Campanari and Giuseppe Kaschmann (born Josip Kasman)—and, from a younger generation of verismo opera-influenced baritones, Titta Ruffo, Riccardo Stracciari, Pasquale Amato, Giuseppe De Luca, Eugenio Giraldoni, Mario Sammarco, Domenico Viglione-Borghesi and the promising newcomer Carlo Galeffi.

==Repertoire==

According to the critic Michael Scott, author of &quot;The Record of Singing&quot;, Ancona&#x27;s smooth, fluent and refined method of singing pre-dated the verismo movement. His style and technique were particularly well suited to the operas of Verdi, and to the bel canto works composed by Bellini and Donizetti (such as &quot;I Puritani&quot;, &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; and &quot;La favorite&quot;). Ancona&#x27;s repertoire of Verdi parts included Germont, Di Luna, Rigoletto, Amonasro and Iago, as well as Don Carlos in &quot;Ernani&quot;.

Ancona also undertook roles composed by Leoncavallo (Silvio and Tonio), Puccini (Lescaut and Marcello), Mascagni (Alfio and David in &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot;), Giordano (Gerard in &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;), Mozart (Don Giovanni and Figaro) and Wagner (Wolfram, Telramund and even, on occasion, Hans Sachs). He appeared, too, in French operas written by Meyerbeer, Gounod, Bizet and, as we have seen, Massenet, performing such parts as Nevers, Hoël, Scindia, Escamillo, Zurga and Valentin.

==Retirement, death and recorded legacy==
Ancona was still in good vocal shape when he elected to retire from the stage in 1916. World War One was then reaching its height in Europe, and Ancona was singing with the Chicago opera company at the time. In retirement, he devoted himself to teaching. He died of lung cancer in Florence, Italy, on 23 February 1931. An extensive collection of documents, photographs and other items relating to Ancona&#x27;s career is preserved at Stanford University&#x27;s Archive of Recorded Sound in California.

Fortunately, however, Ancona&#x27;s thoroughbred voice lives on in a series of gramophone recordings which he made during the first decade of the 20th century for Pathé in 1905–06 and, more rewardingly, for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1907–08. Twenty of his Victor recordings are now available on CD transfers (see below). They consist of several songs as well as operatic arias and duets by Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti, Meyerbeer, Gounod, Bizet, Leoncavallo and Giordano.

<text>Labour Day is a 1988 album by Spirit of the West.

The album&#x27;s best-known song is &quot;Political&quot;, which was the first song to gain widespread airplay for the band on campus radio and CBC Radio One. When the band evolved into an alternative rock group in the 1990s, their 1991 album &quot;Go Figure&quot; included a controversial revamp of that song.

It was the band&#x27;s first album with Hugh McMillan. McMillan found the tour to support the album draining, and took a temporary hiatus from the band; he was replaced by Daniel Lapp and Linda McRae. However, McMillan returned before the band&#x27;s next album. Lapp left on McMillan&#x27;s return, but McRae stayed with the band until 1996.

It was also the band&#x27;s first album to reach the &quot;RPM&quot; Top 100 albums chart, peaking at #64, and was a nominee for Best Roots &amp; Traditional Album at the Juno Awards of 1989.

==Track listing==
Lyrics and music are credited to various combinations of the band members: John Mann, Geoffrey Kelly and Hugh McMillan. Arrangements are credited to the band. Former band member J. Knutson also receives an arranging credit on &quot;Drinking Man&quot;. As with all of the band&#x27;s early folk albums, several songs are arranged around traditional Irish and Scottish reels and jigs.

<doc id="1209385" wikidata="Q223297" url="?curid=1209385" title="Copa Centroamericana">
<text>The Copa Centroamericana () was a regional football competition for senior national teams from Central America. It was organized by the [[Central American Football Union|Unión Centroamericana de Fútbol]] (UNCAF), the regional body for the Central American Zone under CONCACAF. The tournament was held from 1991 to 2017, every two years in the years before and after the FIFA World Cup and also served as a qualification method for the CONCACAF Gold Cup. It was originally known as Copa de Naciones UNCAF () from 1991 to 2009, changing to the latter name in the 2011 edition.

The tournament consisted of two stages, in the group stage of the tournament finals, the seven teams competed in two groups with a round-robin format, one group with four teams and the other with three teams, with the top two teams in each group qualified for the semifinal, where the winners advanced into the final while the losers disputed a third place match. The fifth place match was disputed between the third-ranked teams of the group stage. Depending on their performance in the Copa Centroamericana, teams then went on to participate in other competitions, such as the CONCACAF Gold Cup and the Copa América.

The 14 editions of the Central American competition were won by four different national teams: Costa Rica were the most successful national team with 8 titles. Honduras won 4 titles, Guatemala and Panama won one title each. Costa Rica and Honduras were the only sides in history to win consecutive titles, with the former winning an unprecedented three titles in 2003, 2005 and 2007.

The last edition was held in 2017, with its place in the fixture schedule being taken by the CONCACAF Nations League.

==History==
Due to the success of the Costa Rica national football team at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and the approaching 1994 FIFA World Cup to be hosted in the United States, the CONCACAF Congress in Kingston, Jamaica decided to stage a continental championship itself; the CONCACAF Gold Cup was ratified on August 18, 1990. Costa Rica were given a bye into the competition due to its title at the 1989 CONCACAF Championship, which also served as a qualification phase for the World Cup hosted by Italy. However, due to mainly economic reasons, the United States were chosen as the venue for the continental tournament.

During that same conference, the qualification format for the Central American associations were also decided on. The final qualification round of the Central American zone had two bids: the United States and Costa Rica. Costa Rica, now three-time CONCACAF champions and to celebrate their anniversary of the nation&#x27;s World Cup performance by its team, was named by CONCACAF and UNCAF as the host country of the inaugural edition of the regional tournament organized by UNCAF (1991 UNCAF Nations Cup) on February 19, 1991.

<doc id="1209386" wikidata="Q5126818" url="?curid=1209386" title="Clarence Wijewardena">
<text>Vithana Kuruppu Arachchilage Clarence Arthur Somasinghe Wijewardena JP (, ; 3 August 1943 – 13 December 1996), known professionally as Clarence Wijewardena, was a Sri Lankan singer, composer and musician. Considered one of the most respected musicians in Sri Lanka, Wijewardena revolutionized Sri Lankan Sinhala Pop Music with the use of the electric guitar in Sinhala music, in the 1960s. Due to his influence on Sinhala pop music, he is often named as the &quot;father of Sri Lankan pop music&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Clarence Wijewardena was born on 3 August 1943, in Haputale, Sri Lanka, to an estate medical practitioner. His family moved to Batugedara, Ratnapura, and Clarence abandoned a budding career as a planter to pursue music full-time. He completed education from Weeraparakrama College, Yatawatta and Hatton Highland College. 

He married Sheela Ramadasa and they had one daughter, Amila Priyadarshani.

Wijewardena died on 13 December 1996, at the age of 53, in Sri Lanka after a long struggle against ruptured gastric ulcers and gangrene due to acute diabetes.

==Career in musical bands==
=== Moonstones ===
Wijewardena formed the Moonstones at the age of 21 with Annesley Malewana as lead vocalist. Managed by an advertising icon, Sri Sangabo Corea, the group recorded several songs, which aired on the Saturday Star program in 1966. The young musicians were mentored by Sri Sangabo Corea, together with veteran Radio Ceylon/SLBC broadcasters Vernon Corea and Vijaya Corea. Their 1968 debut EP &quot;Mango Nanda&quot; was released on the JVPC007 Philips label selling up to 5,000 copies. It included the songs &quot;Mango Nanda&quot;, &quot;Ruwan Puraya&quot;, &quot;Seetha Ude&quot; and &quot;Menike&quot;. Their second release &quot;More Hits by the Moonstones&quot; came out in November that year, on the Sooriya label and included the hits &quot;Kalu Mama&quot;, &quot;Rosa Male&quot;, &quot;Ramani&quot; and &quot;Goyam Kapanawa&quot;. Later the song &quot;Mango Nanda&quot; was selected the best Sinhala song by the Hit Parade program on Radio Ceylon as well. In 1969, the Moonstones welcomed female vocalist Indrani Perera who sang lead on the best selling hit &quot;Dilhani&quot;. Wijewardena himself only sang lead on &quot;Dileepa Podi Puthu&quot; an adaptation of a poem written by Karunaratne Abeysekera to his son.

During the &#x27;Moonstones&#x27; era, Wijewardena, who performed as a composer and music director, became a singer. Wijewardena took the initiative to start a three-member band, he was a self taught guitarist. However, later the &#x27;Moonstones&#x27; were formed with Annesley playing the key role as lead singer. After he left the Moonstones in 1970, he held a musical show in Moratuwa with Shanaka Perera and Wijith Peiris and the show was named as &quot;Breakaways from the Moonstones&quot;. The late Mike Goonesekera took over the reins of the Moonstones after the departure of Clarence.

=== Golden Chimes ===
Wijewardena departed the Moonstones and formed a new music group called the Golden Chimes, with ex-Moonstones bassist Chanaka Perera and Lankika Perera in January 1971. Their first release included &quot;Kimade Nawe&quot;, &quot;Mage Pelpathe&quot;, &quot;Sihin Sinawai&quot; and &quot;Samanalayo&quot;. Subsequently, the vocalist Anil Bharathi joined with Golden Chimes. The second EP on Philips label contained &quot;Malai Velai&quot;, &quot;Sihil Nuwan&quot;, &quot;Surangana Vesvala&quot; and &quot;Mage Viyowen&quot; and third EP contained &quot;Iru Dina&quot;, &quot;Sandai Tharui&quot;, &quot;Muhudu Rella&quot; and &quot;Thakkita Tharikita&quot;. At this time Wijewardena found a professional lead guitarist Dixon Gunaratne at a wedding.

After evaluating Bharati&#x27;s performance for one year, Wijewardena decided to enter him into the Sinhala pop music scene. Wijewardena composed &quot;Ada Wei Iru Dina&quot; for Bharati which became an all-time hit followed by the lovely Christmas song &quot;Bethlehempure&quot; and &quot;Maa Adarai Nangiye&quot;. Clarence offered him another all-time hit &quot;Tikirimalee&quot; with &quot;Ma Mulin Liyu Pem Pathe&quot;, &quot;Desa Vidala&quot;, &quot;Bambaraku Aduna&quot;, &quot;Sarojini&quot; and &quot;Iru Dina Pamanak&quot;.

=== The Super Golden Chimes ===

In 1972, Wijewardena and Gunaratne left the Golden Chimes and they both formed a new band known as Super Golden Chimes also with the support of Annesley in 1973. Wijewardena formed the &quot;Super Golden Chimes&quot; back in the company of his lifelong friend Annesley. It was one of the most productive music groups in Sri Lanka and together they hit the number one slot in the Sri Lankan music charts on both the Sinhala and English Services of Radio Ceylon and subsequently the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. For many years they enjoyed the reputation as Sri Lanka&#x27;s number one group in the 1970s and 1980s. After three years Wijewardena decided to go solo when Annesley announced his plans for marriage.

== Experiments in music ==
Wijewardena experimented with sitar music and introduced the sitar to some of the songs of the &#x27;Moonstones. For the first time in Sri Lanka, he used a guitar wah wah pedal for the song &quot;Pemkathwawa&quot; for a recording. Also the song &quot;Sigiriya&quot; was the first Bossa nova beat song in Sri Lanka and later he used this beat for the songs &quot;Piyaneni&quot;, &quot;Mage Palpathe&quot;, &quot;Muhudu Rella&quot;, &quot;Renin Piyabanna&quot;, &quot;Maliniye&quot;, &quot;Ramya&quot;, &quot;Ran Monarun&quot; (Winslow Six), &quot;Lalitha Kala&quot; (Chithra Somapala). Also he used two guitar players to play lead parts and counterparts of songs such as &quot;Sumudu Mal Pipinu&quot; and &quot;Dileepa Podi Puthu&quot;. For the first time in Sri Lanka he used the blocked guitar tone for the song &quot;Kusumalatha&quot;. Wijewardena introduced some of the guitar techniques through his songs via a single guitar harmony style in the introduction of &quot;Dileepa Podi Puthu&quot; and arpeggio styles in &quot;Sihina Lowak&quot; and &quot;Malata Bambareku Se&quot;.

Wijewardena composed a song &quot;Ma Langin&quot; that was in the 1960s &quot;Twist&quot; style and released the song in &quot;Yugayen Yugayata&quot; cassette in 1989. For the song &quot;Dineka Me Nadee Theere&quot;, he used mute guitar technique for the introduction.

==Music direction==
=== Sinhala cinema ===
He entered the Sinhala film music industry with the 1975 blockbuster &quot;Sikuruliya&quot; directed by H. D. Premaratne. The sound track was supplied by the Golden Chimes – the film includes a scene where Wijewardena and the Golden Chimes perform at a party. For the film, he also used western musical instruments as well as eastern musical instruments. The song &quot;Wasanthaye Mal Kekulay&quot; sung by Indrani Perera was composed by him was the first song that consists of five lines in the chorus part of the song. He also composed music for the 1978 film &quot;Apeksha&quot; directed by Premaratne.
=== Television ===
Wijewardena directed music for the two popular television serial &quot;Susima&quot; and &quot;Nidikumba Mal&quot;. He was the composer and the music director for all the six songs of &quot;Susima&quot; teledrama, including &quot;Desa Piyagath Kala&quot; sung by Jackson Anthony and George Senanayake. During this time he got the opportunity to compose and direct music for maestro W. D. Amaradeva for the song &quot;Sasara Gewa Yana&quot; which contained in serial &quot;Nidikumba Mal&quot; directed by Sydney Chandrasekara. He also composed and music directed the song &quot;Daesawan Dase&quot; which says about child abuse and other prohibited things happen in present society. The song was contained in the &quot;Sihiwatana II&quot; cassette. When the Royal Tusker of the Temple of Tooth Relic Raja died, he composed and music directed a song about the royal tusker and it was named as &quot;Kandu Sikarin Wata Senkadagala Pura&quot;. It was vocalized by the Ananda Perera who was the leader of the Siha Shakthi music band.

=== Tribute songs and jingles===
Wijewardena has composed and directed music for a number of songs for the daughters and sons of his friends and relatives. He composed &quot;Piyaneni&quot; in memory of the late Reverend Canon Ivan Corea who was the father of Radio Ceylon broadcaster, Vernon Corea. He had met Corea in Maha Nuge Gardens in the 1960s during his visits to meet with Vernon Corea. The song became an instant hit in South Asia and to this day it is sung by Annesley on his world tours.
Wijewardena composed a song for the son of Vijaya Corea and it was titled as &quot;Viran Bilindhu Puthe&quot;. After that Wijewardena changed the chorus part of the song and sang that song as &quot;Kiri Muhuda Kalabala&quot;. He also composed a song for the son of Chanaka and Lankika Perera and it was titled as &quot;Sihina Pathum Wimane&quot;. He also composed the song &quot;Naththal Seeya&quot; in the early 1970s. His first solo is &quot;Dileepa Podi Puthu&quot; was written by Radio Ceylon broadcaster, Karunaratne Abeysekera for his own son.

Wijewardena joined Sing Lanka Ltd. and acted as the General Manager. Sing Lanka recording studio was the first recording studio in Sri Lanka with multi tracks and Wijewardena was the pioneer to introduce this recording studio. During that time he directed music for a number of artists in Sri Lanka. He also produced a cassette tape named &quot;Clarence with the Rising Stars&quot;.

Wijewardena showed his outstanding music skills during this time. He composed and directed music a song named as &quot;Maha Balwathune&quot; for the conference of the Non-Aligned Movement held in 1975 in Sri Lanka. He composed and directed music a song for the SAARC Conference as well. At the same time he sang the song &quot;Duwani Sirima&quot; when Hon. Former Prime Minister Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike arrived as the chief guest for the opening ceremony of Ceramic Corporation. Also Super Golden Chimes supplied music for that opening ceremony. He certificated as the most popular composer in Sri Lanka for the years 1974 and 1976 by a pop poll conducted by Pop and Teen Fanfare. The song &quot;Kataragama&quot; was composed by himself also certificated as the best song in Sri Lanka for the year 1974 by a pop poll conducted by Pop and Teen Fanfare.

In the early 1970s, Wijewardena invited Vernon Corea who had mentored him from the start to write the notes on a Lotus LP sleeve. Vernon Corea wrote: &quot;We have all shared the treat of your lovely Lyrics, your tuneful compositions, your friendly presentation and your spontaneous sense of sharing with your followers, your treasury of talent. Keep going, keep growing, keep glowing&quot;. In 1976, when Vernon Corea was invited to present the first Asian radio programme in English on BBC Radio London called &#x27;London Sounds Eastern&#x27; he played the music of Wijewardena and Annesley, introducing them to a whole new audience in London.


Wijewardena became famous for his melodious and catchy jingles aired over the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. These jingles were Elasto, Bata, Astra Margarine, Bristol Cigarettes, Arpico, Dot Toffee, Singer, Edna Chocolate, Thultex, Ice-Cream Soda, Development Lottery, Dasuna Cartoon Paper, Atlas pens, Orex pens, Building Materials Co-operation (in Sinhala and English), Keels and Health Joy Soap etc. The song &quot;Sigiri Ru Ladun Paradai&quot; which he composed for the beauty queen contest became an instant hit. He formed the Sri Lankan band &quot;Madhara&quot; in 1985 with Rookantha Gunathilake (keyboards), Mariazelle Goonetilleke (keyboards/female vocals), Raju Bandara (lead guitar), Keneth De Silva (bass guitar), Ajantha Dodampegama (drums) and rest of the other members of the group.

All of Wijewardena&#x27;s compositions have been recorded at some of the island&#x27;s best recording studios and under the best producing labels in Sri Lanka. Some of the early 1960s recordings were at Augie Ranaweera&#x27;s studio in Bambalapitiya. Wijewardena organised three musical shows with Annesley and Indrani at BMICH in Colombo. Wijewardena proved to be quite a hit in London when broadcaster Vernon Corea broadcast his music on BBC Radio London 206 on his popular radio program, &quot;London Sounds Eastern&quot;. Wijewardena and Annesley frequently toured the United Kingdom in the 1980s playing to huge audiences in London.

==Beyond singing==
When the Sri Lankan cricket team became a Test cricket nation in 1982, Wijewardena produced an album called &quot;Test Cricket Souvenir&quot;, commemorating the country achieving test cricket status. The song &quot;Thana Nilla Dige&quot; performed by Saman De Silva became a hit during the season of Test cricket and every big match in Colombo. 

Wijewardena was concerned and made a statement to &quot;Sathsara&quot;, an art magazine in Sri Lanka regarding the song &quot;Thana Nilla Dige&quot; and how its singer Saman De Silva was not given due credit for the song and published a full-page article about the song in a newspaper around the time of the release of the song and cassette but did not mention the name of the composer.

== Controversy ==
However, due to the popularity of his songs which has grown since his death, they have also become the subject of a lawsuit over illegally recorded renditions sampled by other Sri Lankan artists. In 2001, Wijewardena&#x27;s widow Sheela filed suit against Rajiv Sebastian, hoping to recover a portion of the income earned through the use of her late husband&#x27;s work. An action doomed to failure due to the non-availability of evidence on the part of the complainant. Since the lawsuit against Rajiv and Sarath Kothalawela, Sheela filed a wrongful lawsuit against Annesley Malawana and lost it with no recourse. To this date, she has been unable to establish her rightful claims as the legitimate or legal heir to his intellectual property.

==Legacy==
Many of his songs are considered classics, and continue to enjoy ample airtime on Sri Lankan television and radio broadcasts and on some overseas radio stations. The songs such as Rasa Pirunu Katha, Geeyakin Kese, Eatha Ran Wiman Yowun Sihina Loke, etc. are very popular among present generation which again demonstrated his talent in composing music (also as a lyricist) for the future. Clarence also supported the drafting of the Code of Intellectual Property Act No. 52 of 1979 by offering his insights as an artist, advocating for musicians&#x27; rights in Sri Lanka.

On 21 March 2017, the concert &quot;Unfogettable Melodies of Clarence Live in Concert&quot; was held at 6.30 pm at the Nelum Pokuna Theater, Colombo.
