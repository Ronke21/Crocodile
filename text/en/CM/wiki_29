<text>The Archbishop of Uppsala (spelled Upsala until the early 20th century) has been the primate of Sweden in an unbroken succession since 1164, first during the Catholic era, and from the 1530s and onward under the Lutheran church.

== Historical overview ==
There have been bishops in Uppsala from the time of Swedish King Ingold the Elder in the 11th century. They were governed by the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen until Uppsala was made an archbishopric in 1164. The archbishop in Lund (which at that time belonged to Denmark) was declared primate of Sweden, meaning it was his right to select and ordain the Uppsala archbishop by handing him the pallium. To gain independence, Folke Johansson Ängel in 1274 went to Rome and was ordained directly by the pope. This practice was increasing, so that no Uppsala archbishop was in Lund after Olov Björnsson, in 1318. In 1457, the archbishop Jöns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna) was allowed by the pope to declare himself primate of Sweden.

Uppsala (then a village) was originally located a couple of miles to the north of the present city, in what is today known as &quot;Gamla Uppsala&quot; (&quot;Old Uppsala&quot;). In 1273, the archbishopric, together with the relics of King Eric the Saint, was moved to the market town of Östra Aros, which from then on is named &quot;Uppsala&quot;.
In 1531, Laurentius Petri was chosen by King Gustav I of Sweden (Vasa) to be archbishop, taking that privilege from the pope and in effect making Sweden Protestant. The archbishop was then declared &quot;primus inter pares&quot; i.e. first among equals. The archbishop is both bishop of his diocese and Primate of Sweden; he has however no more authority than other bishops, although in effect his statements have a more widespread effect. In 1990, the Archbishop of Uppsala was aided in the diocese by a bishop of Uppsala. Karin Johannesson is the current (2022) Bishop of Uppsala.

==Notable archbishops==
The labours of the archbishops extended in all directions. Some were zealous pastors of their flocks, such as Jarler and others; some were distinguished canonists, such as Birger Gregerson (1367–83) and Olof Larsson (1435-8); others were statesmen, such as Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstjerna (d. 1467), or capable administrators, such as Jacob Ulfsson Örnfot, who was distinguished as a prince of the Church, royal councillor, patron of art and learning, founder of the University of Upsala and an efficient helper in the introduction of printing into Sweden. There were also scholars, such as Johannes Magnus (died 1544), who wrote the &quot;Historia de omnibus Gothorum sueonumque regibus&quot; and the &quot;Historia metropolitanæ ecclesiæ Upsaliensis&quot;, and his brother Olaus Magnus (d. 1588), who wrote the &quot;Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus&quot; and who was the last Catholic Archbishop of Upsala.

The archbishops and secular clergy found active co-workers among the regular clergy (i.e. religious orders). Among the orders represented in Sweden were the Benedictines, Cistercians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Brigittines (with the mother-house at Wadstena) and Carthusians. A Swedish Protestant investigator, Carl Silfverstolpe, wrote: &quot;The monks were almost the sole bond of union in the Middle Ages between the civilization of the north and that of southern Europe, and it can be claimed that the active relations between our monasteries and those in southern lands were the arteries through which the higher civilization reached our country.&quot;

== Earliest bishops ==

The first written mention of a bishop at Uppsala is from Adam of Bremen&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; that records in passing Adalvard the Younger appointed as the bishop for &quot;Sictunam et Ubsalam&quot; in the 1060s. Swedish sources never mention him either in Sigtuna or Uppsala.

The medieval &quot;Annales Suecici Medii Aevi&quot; and the 13th century legend of Saint Botvid mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (&quot;Henricus scilicet Upsalensis&quot;) in 1129, participating in the consecration of the saint&#x27;s newly built church. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the &quot;Chronicon Roskildense&quot; written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna. Also he is omitted from, or at least redated in, the first list of bishops made in the 15th century. In this list, the first bishop at Uppsala was Sverinius (Siwardus?), succeeded by Nicolaus, Sveno, Henricus and Kopmannus. With the exception of Henricus, the list only mentions their names.

<doc id="1202193" wikidata="Q1288707" url="?curid=1202193" title="Stopping time">
<text>In probability theory, in particular in the study of stochastic processes, a stopping time (also Markov time, Markov moment, optional stopping time or optional time) is a specific type of “random time”: a random variable whose value is interpreted as the time at which a given stochastic process exhibits a certain behavior of interest. A stopping time is often defined by a stopping rule, a mechanism for deciding whether to continue or stop a process on the basis of the present position and past events, and which will almost always lead to a decision to stop at some finite time.

Stopping times occur in decision theory, and the optional stopping theorem is an important result in this context. Stopping times are also frequently applied in mathematical proofs to “tame the continuum of time”, as Chung put it in his book (1982).

==Definition==
=== Discrete time ===
Let formula_1 be a random variable, which is defined on the filtered probability space formula_2 with values in formula_3. Then formula_1 is called a stopping time (with respect to the filtration formula_5), if the following condition holds:
:formula_6 for all formula_7
Intuitively, this condition means that the &quot;decision&quot; of whether to stop at time formula_8 must be based only on the information present at time formula_8, not on any future information.

=== General case ===
Let formula_1 be a random variable, which is defined on the filtered probability space formula_11 with values in formula_12. In most cases, formula_13. Then formula_1 is called a stopping time (with respect to the filtration formula_15), if the following condition holds:
:formula_16 for all formula_17

=== As adapted process ===
Let formula_1 be a random variable, which is defined on the filtered probability space formula_11 with values in formula_12. Then formula_1 is called a stopping time if the stochastic process formula_22, defined by
:formula_23

is adapted to the filtration formula_24

=== Comments ===
Some authors explicitly exclude cases where formula_1 can be formula_26, whereas other authors allow formula_1 to take any value in the closure of formula_12.

==Examples==
To illustrate some examples of random times that are stopping rules and some that are not, consider a gambler playing roulette with a typical house edge, starting with $100 and betting $1 on red in each game:

*Playing exactly five games corresponds to the stopping time &quot;τ&quot; = 5, and &quot;is&quot; a stopping rule.
*Playing until they either run out of money or have played 500 games &quot;is&quot; a stopping rule.
*Playing until they obtain the maximum amount ahead they will ever be &quot;is not&quot; a stopping rule and does not provide a stopping time, as it requires information about the future as well as the present and past.
*Playing until they double their money (borrowing if necessary) &quot;is not&quot; a stopping rule, as there is a positive probability that they will never double their money.
*Playing until they either double their money or run out of money &quot;is&quot; a stopping rule, even though there is potentially no limit to the number of games they play, since the probability that they stop in a finite time is 1.

To illustrate the more general definition of stopping time, consider Brownian motion, which is a stochastic process formula_29, where each formula_30 is a random variable defined on the probability space formula_31. We define a filtration on this probability space by letting formula_32 be the &quot;σ&quot;-algebra generated by all the sets of the form formula_33 where formula_34 and formula_35 is a Borel set. Intuitively, an event &quot;E&quot; is in formula_32 if and only if we can determine whether &quot;E&quot; is true or false just by observing the Brownian motion from time 0 to time &quot;t&quot;. 
* Every constant formula_37 is (trivially) a stopping time; it corresponds to the stopping rule &quot;stop at time formula_38&quot;.
* Let formula_39 Then formula_40 is a stopping time for Brownian motion, corresponding to the stopping rule: &quot;stop as soon as the Brownian motion hits the value &quot;a&quot;.&quot;
* Another stopping time is given by formula_41. It corresponds to the stopping rule &quot;stop as soon as the Brownian motion has been positive over a contiguous stretch of length 1 time unit.&quot;
* In general, if τ1 and τ2 are stopping times on formula_42 then their minimum formula_43, their maximum formula_44, and their sum &quot;τ&quot;1 + &quot;τ&quot;2 are also stopping times. (This is not true for differences and products, because these may require &quot;looking into the future&quot; to determine when to stop.)

Hitting times like the second example above can be important examples of stopping times. While it is relatively straightforward to show that essentially all stopping times are hitting times, it can be much more difficult to show that a certain hitting time is a stopping time. The latter types of results are known as the Début theorem.

==Localization==
Stopping times are frequently used to generalize certain properties of stochastic processes to situations in which the required property is satisfied in only a local sense. First, if &quot;X&quot; is a process and τ is a stopping time, then &quot;X&quot;&quot;τ&quot; is used to denote the process &quot;X&quot; stopped at time &quot;τ&quot;.
:formula_45
Then, &quot;X&quot; is said to locally satisfy some property &quot;P&quot; if there exists a sequence of stopping times τ&quot;n&quot;, which increases to infinity and for which the processes 
:formula_46 
satisfy property &quot;P&quot;. Common examples, with time index set &quot;I&quot; = [0, ∞), are as follows:

Local martingale process. A process &quot;X&quot; is a local martingale if it is càdlàg and there exists a sequence of stopping times τ&quot;n&quot; increasing to infinity, such that 
:formula_46 
is a martingale for each &quot;n&quot;.

Locally integrable process. A non-negative and increasing process &quot;X&quot; is locally integrable if there exists a sequence of stopping times &quot;τ&quot;&quot;n&quot; increasing to infinity, such that 
:formula_48 
for each &quot;n&quot;.

==Types of stopping times==
Stopping times, with time index set &quot;I&quot; = [0,∞), are often divided into one of several types depending on whether it is possible to predict when they are about to occur.

A stopping time &quot;τ&quot; is predictable if it is equal to the limit of an increasing sequence of stopping times &quot;τ&quot;&quot;n&quot; satisfying &quot;τ&quot;&quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;τ&quot; whenever &quot;τ&quot; &gt; 0. The sequence &quot;τ&quot;&quot;n&quot; is said to &quot;announce&quot; &quot;τ&quot;, and predictable stopping times are sometimes known as &quot;announceable&quot;.
Examples of predictable stopping times are hitting times of continuous and adapted processes. If &quot;τ&quot; is the first time at which a continuous and real valued process &quot;X&quot; is equal to some value &quot;a&quot;, then it is announced by the sequence &quot;τ&quot;&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;τ&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the first time at which &quot;X&quot; is within a distance of 1/&quot;n&quot; of &quot;a&quot;.

Accessible stopping times are those that can be covered by a sequence of predictable times. That is, stopping time &quot;τ&quot; is accessible if, P(&quot;τ&quot; = &quot;τ&quot;&quot;n&quot; for some &quot;n&quot;) = 1, where &quot;τ&quot;&quot;n&quot; are predictable times.

A stopping time &quot;τ&quot; is totally inaccessible if it can never be announced by an increasing sequence of stopping times. Equivalently, P(&quot;τ&quot; = &quot;σ&quot; &lt; ∞) = 0 for every predictable time &quot;σ&quot;. Examples of totally inaccessible stopping times include the jump times of Poisson processes.

Every stopping time &quot;τ&quot; can be uniquely decomposed into an accessible and totally inaccessible time. That is, there exists a unique accessible stopping time σ and totally inaccessible time υ such that &quot;τ&quot; = &quot;σ&quot; whenever &quot;σ&quot; &lt; ∞, &quot;τ&quot; = &quot;υ&quot; whenever &quot;υ&quot; &lt; ∞, and &quot;τ&quot; = ∞ whenever &quot;σ&quot; = &quot;υ&quot; = ∞. Note that in the statement of this decomposition result, stopping times do not have to be almost surely finite, and can equal ∞.

==Stopping rules in clinical trials==
Clinical trials in medicine often perform interim analysis, in order to determine whether the trial has already met its endpoints.
However, interim analysis create the risk of false-positive results, and therefore stopping boundaries are used to determine the number and timing of interim analysis (also known as alpha-spending, to denote the rate of false positives).
At each of R interim tests, the trial is stopped if the likelihood is below a threshold p, which depends on the method used. See Sequential analysis.

<text>The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit&#x27;s Flower is a release by the Elephant 6 band Of Montreal. It is an extended version of their EP &quot;The Bird Who Ate the Rabbit&#x27;s Flower&quot;; the first five tracks are the ones from that first effort.

==Background==
Initially a short run five-song EP, &quot;The Bird Who Ate the Rabbit&#x27;s Flower&quot; went out of print. The songs were recorded at the same time as the songs that made &quot;The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy&quot; and &quot;The Gay Parade&quot;, but not fitting either of their styles. These EPs and further albums were released via Kindercore, as opposed to Bar/None Records due to the volume of material Kevin Barnes was making. Bar/None wanted to wait to release more, so Kevin signed a deal with local Athens, Georgia label Kindercore to get all of it out.

&quot;You Are An Airplane&quot; was written about Kevin&#x27;s best friend Niquelin, who they lived with at the time, not wanting her to get into cocaine.

&quot;The Inner Light&quot; is about a Christian girl Kevin meets who they are surprised to learn is very compassionate and loving.

&quot;When a Man Is in Love with a Man&quot; details Kevin questioning their sexuality after seeing their friends in healthy homosexual relationships.

&quot;If I Faltered Slightly Twice&quot; is a song about Kevin&#x27;s failed relationship with the band&#x27;s namesake girl from Montreal, Julie. Kevin drove to Montreal to see her, it went very poorly, and she kicked them out. They later wrote the song at their sister&#x27;s house.

&quot;Disguises&quot; is a The Who cover.

&quot;On the Drive Home&quot; is another song about Julie, detailing Kevin driving home after the experience. They had bought a cherry cola, as mentioned in the song, then had broken down in their car. They had been speeding, and a cop stopped them. Realizing they were in deep distress, he let them go.

&quot;The Secret Ocean&quot; is an Elf Power cover, an Elephant 6 band that Kevin had collaborated with at the time.

&quot;I Felt Like Smashing My Face Through a Clear Glass Window&quot; is a Yoko Ono cover. Yoko later mailed Kevin a postcard informing them she heard the cover via her son Sean and enjoyed it.

<doc id="1202206" wikidata="Q1068951" url="?curid=1202206" title="Ministry of State Security (China)">
<text>The Ministry of State Security (MSS) is the principal civilian intelligence and security service of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, responsible for foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, and defense of the political security and honor of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). One of the largest and most secretive intelligence organizations in the world, it maintains powerful semi-autonomous branches at the provincial, city, municipality and township levels throughout China. The ministry&#x27;s headquarters, Yidongyuan, is a large compound in Beijing&#x27;s Haidian district.

The origins of the MSS begin with the CCP&#x27;s Central Special Operations Division, better known as the &quot;Teke&quot;, which was replaced by the Central Social Affairs Department from 1936 through the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1949. In 1955, the department was replaced with the Central Investigation Department, which existed in various configurations through the Cultural Revolution to 1983, when it was merged with counterintelligence elements of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) to form the MSS. 

The contemporary MSS is an all-source intelligence organization with a broad mandate and expansive authorities to undertake global campaigns of espionage and covert action on the so-called &quot;hidden front.&quot; Within China, the ministry leverages extrajudicial law enforcement authorities to achieve its domestic objectives: Its State Security Police serve as a secret police authorized to detain and interrogate people in what is known as &quot;an invitation to tea.&quot; Those remanded by state security are detained in the ministry&#x27;s own detention facilities.

Outside the mainland, the ministry is best known for its numerous advanced persistent threat groups, some outsourced to contractors, which carry out prolific industrial and cyber espionage campaigns. The ministry has also been implicated in political and transnational repression and harassment of dissidents abroad. Its influence operations, often orchestrated in collaboration with the United Front Work Department, have led national policy, originating phrases like &quot;China&#x27;s peaceful rise&quot; and &quot;great changes unseen in a century&quot;, which have become staples of official PRC political rhetoric.

Once rarely acknowledged, in recent years the ministry has drastically increased its public profile, publishing a manga series, and a recruitment video starring Li Yifeng. While its inner workings remain opaque, propaganda posters about national security branded with the ministry&#x27;s seal are now a common sight on billboards and public transit in Chinese cities, and its daily WeChat posts receive millions of views. The ministry is currently estimated to have at least 110,000 employees, with 10,000 reporting directly to MSS headquarters and 100,000 spread across its dozens of semi-autonomous bureaus.

== Overview ==
MSS functions as China&#x27;s intelligence, security and secret police agency. A document from the U.S. Department of Justice described the agency as being like a combination of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Australian author Clive Hamilton described it as being similar to an amalgamation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) &quot;with a lot more power and less subject to the constraints of the rule of law.&quot;

According to sinologists Peter Mattis and Matthew Brazil, who have studied the MSS for many years:

The MSS is a civilian agency that controls its own separate police force, the &quot;State Security Police&quot;, which is one of the four components of the People&#x27;s Police. The MSS seal contains the emblem of the Chinese Communist Party and the official uniform is identical to that of the other People&#x27;s Police, with the only difference being the police insignia include the Chinese characters &quot;国安&quot; (&quot;State Security&quot;).

Article 4 of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China gives the MSS the same authority to arrest or detain people as MPS for crimes involving state security with identical supervision by the procuratorates and the courts. The National Intelligence Law of 2017 grants the MSS broad powers to conduct many types of espionage both domestically and abroad; it also gives the MSS the power to administratively detain those who impede or divulge information on intelligence work for up to 15 days.

== History ==
=== Central Special Branch (1928–1936) ===
In November 1927, the CCP established its first formal intelligence service, with Zhou Enlai founding the Central Special Branch (, often shortened to Teke; sometimes written Special Services Section (SSS)) to conduct &quot;special operations&quot; work. With Xiang Zhongfa and Gu Shunzhang&#x27;s assistance, Zhou designed the organization that many Chinese intelligence officers today see as the origins of their enterprise. Establishing secret bases across the Chinese territory, the Teke was composed of four sections led by Gu Shunzhang and Kang Sheng.

* 1st Section, General Services Section (), was responsible for the protection and safety of CCP headquarters and leaders and included making arrangements for secret meetings. 1st Section was led by Hong Yangsheng ().
* 2nd Section, Intelligence Section (), was responsible for intelligence and counterintelligence and led by Chen Geng (), later to become the CCP&#x27;s Vice Minister of National Defense.
* 3rd Section, Operations Section (), was the infamous &quot;Red Guard&quot; assassination section headed by Gu Shunzhang (顾顺章) whose &quot;dog-beating squads&quot; () were tasked with killing traitors.
* 4th Section, Radio Communications Section () was headed by Li Qiang (later to become PRC Minister of Foreign Trade) and responsible for communication in the underground spy network.

Zhou&#x27;s primary objective was to disrupt the Kuomintang&#x27;s secret police attempts to penetrate the CCP which required both a defensive counterintelligence effort to identify potentially traitorous members of the party and an offensive intelligence effort to plant spies within the Kuomintang&#x27;s security and intelligence services. To prevent leaks and limit damage caused by infiltration by Nationalist spies, agents of Teke were forbidden to have any relationship with other agents making the party so compartmentalized that many never knew the name of the organization only calling it &quot;Wu Hao&#x27;s Dagger&quot;, a reference to Zhou Enlai&#x27;s &quot;nom de guerre&quot;.

Based in Shanghai, Teke grew to become &quot;a small army of messengers, people smugglers, and informers&quot; with a constant presence in clubs, religious organizations, music groups, and brothels serving as Zhou Enlai&#x27;s (and subsequently the CCP&#x27;s) eyes and ears both in Shanghai and across the nation. Nonetheless, Teke had to compete with the newly established KMT Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (BIS) under the notorious Dai Li whose nickname as the &quot;Chinese Himmler&quot; lives on for his horrific torture record which included death in excruciating agony and forced heroin overdosing. Under Dai Li, the BIS created vast networks of 100,000 operatives across and outside the borders of China and mastered new means of intercepting communist communications — an art taught to the KMT by American cryptographer Herbert Yardley for use against the Japanese. The overwhelming advantages of the KMT were challenged only by the extensive and thorough infiltration of the security services by Teke agents including Qian Zhuangfei, Li Kenong, and Hu Di.

Gu Shunzhang, whom Zhou Enlai had chosen to head operations for Teke, would prove to be one of the most adversely consequential members of the CCP&#x27;s underground intelligence ring. Having been born in Shanghai on &quot;the &quot; according to French author Roger Faligot, Gu lived crudely out of bars smoking opium, having affairs, and joining the Green Gang but made a name for himself as a magician. Made a bodyguard for Mikhail Borodin, the Comintern agent and advisor to the Kuomintang from Soviet Russia, Gu was sent to Vladivostok to learn the tactics of insurrection and tradecraft of espionage as Borodin feared division between the Chinese nationalists and communists. A trained spy, Gu led Teke operations from the group&#x27;s 1927 founding until 25 April 1931. 

While performing the typical magic show for young children that usually covered for his espionage missions, a nationalist informer who had turned on the CCP recognized Gu from a photograph and alerted the KMT authorities. A number of KMT agents appeared and tackled Gu, not only gleeful to have detained one of their most challenging communist adversaries but were successful in turning the spymaster against the communists making Gu the most notorious intelligence traitor in modern Chinese history. As Gu provided the KMT with a flood of Teke agents&#x27; names and safe house locations, Zhou&#x27;s spy inside the BIS, Qian Zhuangfei, immediately notified Zhou and Kang Shang who were able to relocate every Teke agent within two days — avoiding a potential extermination of CCP&#x27;s core. Some agents, however, were located and arrested. On 21 June 1931, presumably with help from Gu&#x27;s defection, the KMT captured CCP General Secretary Xiang Zhongfa hiding in a jewelry store with his cabaret dancer mistress. Despite offering to convert to the KMT party, Xiang was shot by his jailers before the received word of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s pardon. Though the CCP&#x27;s nascent intelligence branch under Kang Shang had narrowly escaped destruction, the damage done by Gu&#x27;s defection and the number of communist spy arrests attrited the group until, in 1935, the CCP elected to disband it. While many of Teke&#x27;s agents moved to the Red Army&#x27;s Political Protection Bureau (PPB) led by Dong Fa, the PPB focused entirely on counterintelligence meaning real intelligence collection would go largely dormant until the formation of the Social Affairs Department.

=== Central Social Affairs Department (1936–1955) ===

In 1936, the CCP established the Social Affairs Department (often abbreviated as SAD in English) in Yan&#x27;an, Shaanxi to consolidate the party&#x27;s foreign intelligence and counterintelligence efforts. It wasn&#x27;t until 1938 when Kang Sheng took control of the department and restructured the organization that it took its final form in the merging of the preceding Special Branch, the Political Protection Bureau (which Kang Sheng had previously headed), and the Guard Office. The Political Protection Bureau provided rear area security to CCP forces prior to the Long March and close security to Mao during the march while the Guard Office established a local constabulary and counterintelligence service. Under Kang Sheng and his deputy Li Kenong, the SAD provided the CCP foreign intelligence, domestic intelligence, military security, and political security in every province in which communist forces held terrain.

The Social Affairs Department was constructed similarly to the Soviet model (as Kang had been trained by Soviet intelligence in Moscow):

* Section 1 was responsible for administration and personnel,
* Section 2 was responsible for intelligence collection,
* Section 3 was responsible for counterintelligence,
* Section 4 was responsible for intelligence analysis,
* Special section for security, and
* The &quot;Executions Department&quot;

From 1942 to 1944, as the Social Affairs Department expanded, Kang Sheng became paranoid and fearful of spies within his organization. Kang, known as the &quot;Chinese Beria&quot; abroad, frequently reminded others that political deviation was inextricably linked to being a traitorous spy, remarking &quot;There is a close link between the twin crimes of espionage and deviationism. One is not a deviationist, as we have tended to believe, by chance or error. It is, ineluctably, dialectically, because one is a Japanese agent or a Kuomintang spy—or both. We must begin a ruthless hunt to root out these two plagues from Yan&#x27;an because, by fighting against deviationism, we weaken the clandestine plots of our enemies, and vice versa.&quot; Convinced that at least 30 percent of his organization were counterrevolutionaries and spies, Kang established a counterintelligence quota which contributed greatly to the practice of &quot;bigongxin&quot;, forcing a false confession in order to build a case against the accused. Kang&#x27;s counterintelligence inquisition utilized &quot;techniques of punishment and interrogation inspired by the millennia-long Chinese tradition of torture, updated by twentieth-century Stalinism for the requirements of the era&quot; with torture practices including driving bamboo spikes under fingernails, inserting hair from a horse&#x27;s tail into the penis, pumping high-pressure water into the vagina, cutting off the breasts of women looking for their tortured husbands, forcing the ingestion of large amounts of vinegar, applying burning incense to armpits, tying to a whipped horse&#x27;s tail, and live burials. Kang&#x27;s perceived connection between political deviation and traitorship led many senior leaders to avoid criticizing Kang&#x27;s purges.

Known by 1944 as the &quot;party hangman&quot;, Kang was eventually opposed by Zhou Enlai and later Mao Zedong who forced Kang to produce his own self-criticism proclaiming that perhaps only 10 percent of the comrades accused were spies and, in November 1944, relieved him of the position as head of the Social Affairs Department. Various rumors for the cause of his removal endure. One version claims that his paranoid purges made him a target of many senior communist officials, many of whom found themselves in Kang&#x27;s sights. Another less likely explanation from Mao&#x27;s physician, Li Zhuisui, claims that Kang suffered acute paranoia and symptoms of schizophrenia and was consequently sent to a mental asylum. American intelligence reportedly believed Kang&#x27;s downfall was the result of the collapse of the pro-Stalinist faction proceeding the deaths of Stalin and Beria since Kang had trained as an intelligence officer in Moscow. Li Kenong, the new head of the Social Affairs Department, developed the organization&#x27;s intelligence networks and was appointed by Zhou Enlai to simultaneously serve as the nation&#x27;s deputy minister of foreign affairs.

=== Central Investigation Department (1955–1983) ===
In an effort to disaffiliate the intelligence service from Kang Sheng&#x27;s paranoia-driven legacy of purges, the organization was renamed to the CCP Central Investigation Department () with only one SAD branch moved out to its own organization, the Legal and Administrative Work Department.

In the 1950s, nearly every Chinese embassy abroad had an Investigation and Research Office, a cover for a group of intelligence officers belonging to the Central Investigation Department (CID) who kept close watch on diplomats and embassy staff, often sitting in on meetings and reporting back to CID headquarters&#x27; Eight Bureau (known later as the &quot;Institute of Contemporary International Relations&quot;).

On 9 February 1962, Li Kenong died after a period of illness from the residual effects of brain damage from a fall he had sustained three years prior. Kong Yuan, Kang Sheng&#x27;s former secretary and friend of Zhou Enlai, ran the service with Zou Dapeng and Luo Qingchang as his deputies.

Early in 1976, Mao Zedong and his defense chief Marshal Lin Biao plotted to overthrow army Chief of Staff and Deputy Prime Minister Luo Ruiqing who, despite being a lifelong supporter of the CCP and founder of the MPS, had opposed the political training in the military instituted at Mao&#x27;s directive. Eager to thieve for the second time a senior position in the security services from Luo and to gain a stronghold over the party&#x27;s security apparatus, Kang Sheng prepared a traitorous dossier on Luo complete with accusations of &quot;illicit intercourse with foreigners&quot;. Lin Biao sent for Luo&#x27;s arrest, and, under appalling conditions of incarceration and interrogation, Luo attempted to commit suicide in March by throwing himself from his cell breaking two legs after which Red Guards forced him to make his own self-criticism. As Mao Zedong launched his Cultural Revolution in 1966, Kang Sheng attempted to limit the destructive influence of the revolution on his intelligence and security apparatus issuing in September the directive &quot;Codes, telegrams, confidential documents, files, and secret archives are the essential secrets of the Party and State; the safeguarding of all of these elements is the responsibility of all cadres, revolutionary masses, students, and revolutionary teachers.&quot; Despite this, Kang Sheng soon found that the calamitous red wave that overtook Mao&#x27;s China would grow beyond his control. It wouldn&#x27;t be until October 1978, after Mao&#x27;s death in September 1976, that Hua Guofeng and Wang Dongxing would rebuild the Central Investigative Department which was officially reestablished on 28 July 1978. The organization still lacked experience or established tradecraft which would cause them a number of embarrassments.

==== Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia ====
The most impactful embarrassment of the newly reestablished Central Investigative Department (or &quot;Diaochabu&quot;) was their inability to predict the Vietnamese invasion of the Republic of Kampuchea (today Cambodia) in 1979. Following a visit to Democratic Kampuchea by Wang Dongxing in early November 1978, he and head of the new Central Investigative Department Luo Qinchang praised the ten-year friendship with the Khmer Rouge and helped Kaing Khek and Ta Mok to establish the neighboring communist party&#x27;s notorious S-21 interrogation and extermination camp where around 20,000 Cambodians would be killed under Pol Pot&#x27;s genocide. Within a month of Wang and Luo&#x27;s return to China, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion of Kampuchea in response to a series of border attacks on the Liberation Army of Kampuchea. Perhaps by ideological closeness to Pol Pot and his followers, Chinese intelligence under the Central Investigative Department, and consequently PRC leadership, was caught by surprise by the Vietnamese invasion. Unable to contact the Khmer Rouge who, under the leadership of Ta Mok, had escaped into the jungles to organize a guerrilla resistance with only one Chinese agent carrying a defective satellite radio, a thousand Chinese military advisors fled Cambodia via Thailand and left 4,000 civilian advisors to the invading Vietnamese army. Compounding the intelligence failure, as the invasion broke the Central Investigative Department expressed confidence to Chinese leaders that the invasion would be easily repelled and that the Chinese embassy in the capital, Phnom Penh, would be unharmed.

Hoping to force a Vietnamese withdrawal from its ally Cambodia, the People&#x27;s Republic of China launched their own southward invasion across the border into Vietnam in February 1979 which was withdrawn four weeks later after heavy resistance by Vietnamese guerrillas bearing Soviet and American weapons. Nonetheless, head of the CCP Deng Xiaoping supported the Khmer Rouge for another ten years in exile limiting his criticism of the two million-victim genocide assessing &quot;the domestic counterintelligence activities created a negative atmosphere, slowing down many activities and causing social problems as well as many other problems... A thorough study of this political aspect should be undertaken and concrete measures taken.&quot;

==== End of the Diaochabu ====
At the end of the Cultural Revolution, as China struggled to regain its footing after a tumultuous decade, Deng Xiaoping and his fellow reformers Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang endeavored down the road of governmental reform. CCP general secretary Hu Yaobang decried Kang Sheng&#x27;s destructive and paranoid legacy in a speech in November 1978 enumerating many of the crimes Kang Sheng had been found guilty of, up to and through the Cultural Revolution. Kang&#x27;s condemnation was bolstered by the investigation prepared by Luo Qingchang&#x27;s Central Investigative Department which detailed how Kang had organized the Yan&#x27;an purges and named any of his opponents &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;.

Deng Xiaoping was himself a victim of Mao&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, the Gang of Four, and Kang Sheng&#x27;s secret police. Deng&#x27;s son, Deng Pufang, became paraplegic and needed to use a wheelchair after Red Guards threw him from a high window. After these experiences, Deng was committed to reforming the Chinese intelligence services. Deng first initiated a small but meaningful campaign to degrade Kang Sheng&#x27;s legacy, which began with Hu Yaobang&#x27;s speech. Next, Deng subordinated the Central Investigative Department into a minor political organ. Finally, Deng took all the &quot;external intelligence expertise&quot; from the Central Investigative Department and consolidated it and all the CCP&#x27;s espionage and counterintelligence functions into a new, &quot;revolutionized&quot; Chinese intelligence service, fitting of the new era of the Chinese &quot;opening-up&quot; to the world.

=== Ministry of State Security (1983–present) ===

Proposed by Premier Zhao Ziyang and Minister of Public Security Liu Fuzhi and approved at the first session of the sixth National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC), the Ministry of State Security (MSS) was approved on 20 June 1983 to be a merger between the Central Investigation Department and the Bureau of Investigating Counterrevolutionaries (or the First Bureau) of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) to &quot;protect the security of the state and strengthen China&#x27;s espionage work&quot;. The following day, the NPC appointed Ling Yun to be the first Minister of State Security which would announce its establishment on 1 July 1983. There were serious political reasons behind the merger, as Luo Qingchang, who had been Director of the CID since 1973 and was a powerful player in Chinese Communist intelligence since the 1940s, was a fierce opponent of Deng Xiaoping. Although Deng had risen to supreme power in the late 1970s, he initially couldn&#x27;t remove Luo from his post, until he finally succeeded in 1983. But even after this, Luo still remained influential as an adviser on the Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs. Although the MSS maintains loyalty to party and ideology as a central mission, its founding represents the first time that a Chinese intelligence organ was placed under the State Council instead of the party.

The 1st Bureau of the new MSS managed internal affairs and security in each of the provinces with the help of local and regional offices. The MSS also maintained a number of concentration camps () where apprehended enemy spies like the Taiwanese &quot;Society of the Continent&quot; network in Tianjin. The 2nd Bureau of the MSS was responsible for foreign intelligence collection beginning in the nearby capitals of Tokyo, Bangkok, and Singapore. Intelligence officers of the 2nd Bureau operated under diplomatic cover posing as advisors or secretaries to diplomats in-country. The MSS&#x27; 3rd Bureau was responsible for nearby areas the People&#x27;s Republic of China wished to draw back into the CCP&#x27;s control: Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau. The 4th Bureau focused on the technical aspects of espionage, the 5th Bureau for local intelligence, the 6th Bureau for counterintelligence, the 7th Bureau that conducted surveillance or special operations, and the 8th Bureau engaged in research through open sources (OSINT). The 8th Bureau took control over the former branch of the Central Investigative Department called the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) whose members denied any connections to the Chinese intelligence apparatus. The 9th Bureau managed the threat of enemy infiltration and MSS officer defections, the 10th Bureau worked with the State Scientific &amp; Technological Commission and the intelligence section of the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND). The 11th Bureau managed computers, networks, and information technology equipment, and finally the 12th Bureau was responsible for liaising with foreign intelligence services under the name of the Office of Foreign Affairs. Officers of the 12th Bureau worked with the CIA&#x27;s David Gries, BND&#x27;s Dr. Herms Bahl, MI6&#x27;s Nigel Inkster, and the DGSE&#x27;s Thierry Imbot while keeping them under surveillance. The so-called Office of Foreign Affairs also took up duties to surveil visiting tourists, diplomats, and journalists who began to enter the country after China&#x27;s opening to the world. The MSS&#x27; first head announced &quot;The intelligence agencies and secret services of some foreign countries have increased their spying activities against China&#x27;s state secrets and are now sending agents to subvert and destroy our country.&quot;

One of the longest-serving Ministers of State Security was Jia Chunwang, a native of Beijing and a 1964 graduate of Tsinghua University, reportedly an admirer of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He served as Minister of State Security from 1985 until March 1998, when the MSS underwent an overhaul and Xu Yongyue, a former secretary of party elder Chen Yun was appointed the new head of the organization. Jia was largely responsible for the development of the MSS out of each of the provincial departments of state security, wherein many police officers found themselves intelligence officers the next day. Within the first year, Jia consolidated the security departments of Beijing, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Shanghai. Between 1985 and 1988 Jia had managed to incorporate those departments of Chongqing, Gansu, Hainan, Henan, Shaanxi, Tianjin, and Zhejiang. From 1990 to 1995, Jia incorporated security departments from Anhui, Hunan, Qinghai, and Sichuan provinces. Jia was then appointed to the Minister of Public Security post, after 13 years as head of the MSS. After becoming the secretary of Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission in 2007, the MSS was under the command and influence of Zhou Yongkang until his ouster and conviction for corruption in 2014. One of the people responsible for &quot;taking down&quot; Zhou Yongkang was Chen Wenqing of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, who was nominated Minister of State Security by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in 2016, partly as a reward for purging Zhou and his network, as well as replacing the prior minister Geng Huichang.

==== Under Xi Jinping ====
Since CCP general secretary Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, the MSS gained more responsibility over cyberespionage vis-à-vis the PLA, and has sponsored various advanced persistent threat groups such as Double Dragon. Starting in 2016, provincial and local state security bureaus were brought under centralized control. In October 2018, the Deputy Minister of State Security, Yanjun Xu, was charged with economic espionage by the United States prosecutors.

On May 28, 2021, a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California returned an indictment against four People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) citizens for their alleged roles in a long running campaign of computer network operations targeting trade secrets, intellectual property, and other high value information from companies, universities, research institutes, and governmental entities in the United States and abroad, as well as multiple foreign governments. The indictment alleges that Zhu Yunmin, Wu Shurong, Ding Xiaoyang, and Cheng Qingmin targeted the following sectors: aerospace/aviation, biomedical, defense industrial base, healthcare, manufacturing, maritime, research institutes, transportation (rail and shipping), and virus research from 2012 to 2018, on behalf of the PRC Ministry of State Security. Additionally, the indictment alleges the use of front companies by the PRC Ministry of State Security to conduct cyber espionage.

In July 2023, the MSS opened a WeChat account, where it wrote its first post that it wishes to popularize counterintelligence among the population and make such activity &quot;normal&quot; with systems of rewards. In another post in September, the MSS criticized the policies of the United States towards China, saying that the US was &quot;decoupling and disconnecting at the economic level, ganging up at the political level, deterrence and containment at the security level, discrediting and disparaging at the public opinion level, and constraining and locking down at the rules level&quot;.

In January 2024, the MSS published a list of &quot;10 conditions&quot;, euphemistically referred to as &quot;cups of tea&quot; to its official WeChat channel; which would subject individuals to scrutiny and questioning by state security authorities, including but not limited to: endangering national security, illegally acquiring or holding state secrets, committing or assisting espionage, refusing to cooperate in an espionage investigation, leaking state secrets related to counter-espionage and intelligence works and &quot;failing to take security precautions against spying&quot;.

== Contemporary activities ==
The MSS recruits new intelligence officers primarily from major universities, police and military academies.

In March 2009, former MSS operative Li Fengzhi told the &quot;Washington Times&quot; in an interview that the MSS was engaged in counterintelligence, the collection of secrets and technology from other countries, and repressing internal dissent within China. The internal repression, according to Li, includes efforts against house churches, the underground church and the Falun Gong religious group, plus censoring the Internet to prevent China&#x27;s population from knowing what is going on outside the country. Li emphasized that MSS&#x27;s most important mission is, &quot;to control the Chinese people to maintain the rule of the Communist Party.&quot;

In 2012, an executive assistant to MSS vice minister Lu Zhongwei was found to have been passing information to the CIA. Lu Zhongwei was not formally charged, but that incident was said to have infuriated Hu Jintao and led to a tightening on information dissemination and increased counterintelligence activities in Beijing and abroad.

The Shanghai State Security Bureau (SSSB) of the MSS has repeatedly been involved in both failed and successful attempts to recruit foreign agents. In 2010, the SSSB directed US citizen Glenn Duffie Shriver to apply for a position at the National Clandestine Service of the CIA. In 2017, SSSB case workers were implicated in the recruitment of US Department of State employee Candace Claiborne who was charged with obstruction of justice.

In 2013, a Chinese driver was employed by Senator Dianne Feinstein who was notified that the driver was being investigated for possible Chinese spying. At some point, he visited China and was recruited by China&#x27;s MSS. He worked for Senator Feinstein for several years. The FBI concluded the driver hadn&#x27;t revealed anything of substance.

During January 2017, the FBI arrested Candace Claiborne, a State Department employee who had previously worked in the American Embassy in Beijing between 2009 and 2012. In April 2019 Claiborne pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the United States. Prosecutors argued that she had passed sensitive information to the MSS.

Companies such as Huawei, China Mobile, and China Unicom have been implicated in MSS intelligence collection activities.

In 2017, MSS officials entered the United States on the pretense of transit visas as cultural officials. During the visit the officials made an attempt to persuade Chinese dissident Guo Wengui to return to China in order to face charges for prosecution. Guo Wengui accepted the meeting, out of apparent gratitude for one of the officials, named Liu Yanping, having previously assisted in bringing his wife to America. However, Guo Wengui recorded the conversations and alerted the FBI. Subsequently, the Chinese officials were confronted by FBI agents in Pennsylvania Station, the Chinese officials initially claimed to be cultural affairs diplomats but ultimately admitted to being security officials. The Chinese officials were given a warning for their activities in New York and were ordered to return to China. Two days later, the officials again visited the apartment of Guo Wengui once more prior to leaving the country. While at the apartment the second time, the officials reportedly ate dumplings made by the wife of Guo Wengui, and Guo Wengui walked them out of the building after again declining their offer of clemency for silence. The FBI was aware of the second visit and agents were prepared to arrest the Chinese security officials at JFK Airport prior to their Air China flight on charges of visa fraud and extortion, but arrests were not made following pressure from the State Department to avoid a diplomatic crisis. The FBI did, however, confiscate the Chinese officials’ phones before the plane took off.

In 2019, according to a report released by the European External Action Service, there were an estimated 250 MSS spies operating in Brussels.

In September 2020, a journalist, a Chinese MSS operative and her Nepalese informant were arrested in India for providing classified information about Indian army deployments in Doklam area and India&#x27;s Ministry of External Affairs to two officers of Yunnan State Security Department (YSSD) of the MSS.

In December 2020, 10 MSS Operatives of Xinjiang State Security Department (XSSD) were arrested in Kabul, Afghanistan by the National Directorate of Security. During questioning, one operative told the interrogators that they were gathering information about al Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Turkistan Islamic Party in Kunar and Badakhshan Provinces, and wanted to trap and assassinate high-level members of Turkistan Islamic Party. At least two of the operatives were also in contact with the Haqqani network for this job. After days of negotiations between Afghanistan and China, all of them were pardoned and were flown out of the country in a plane arranged by the Chinese government.

In February 2021, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Britain had expelled three MSS agents posing as journalists.

In March 2021, at least six Chinese bloggers were arrested by MSS for &#x27;insulting&#x27; People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force soldiers who died in the Galwan Valley clash. Those bloggers had suggested that the death toll of the China-India border clash was 11times higher than the official count of four.

In late April 2021, the Ministry of State Security announced that it was introducing several new measures to fight alleged infiltration by &quot;hostile forces&quot; of Chinese companies and other institutions. These measures include drawing up a list of companies and organizations considered to be at risk of foreign infiltration and requiring them to take security measures. In addition, staff travelling on business trips to the Five Eyes countries (the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) have been ordered to report all contact with foreign personnel, participate in anti-espionage seminars, and leave mobile phones, laptops, and USB drives at home before traveling abroad.

In September 2022, it was reported during Congressional testimony that the FBI had informed Twitter of at least one MSS agent on its payroll.

In December 2023, a joint investigation by &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot; reported that Belgium former senator Frank Creyelman accepted bribes from MSS for three years to influence discussions within the European Union.

In March 2024, the MSS warned that overseas intelligences services had used foreign consulting firms as a cover to steal classified information and pose &quot;major risks to national security.&quot;

=== Cyberespionage ===

In 2017, the cyberespionage threat group known as Gothic Panda or APT3 was determined to have nation-state level capabilities and to be functioning on behalf of the MSS by researchers.

In 2018, the United States Department of Justice indicted two individuals of the cyber-espionage group APT10, which it stated was under the direction of the Tianjin State Security Bureau (TSSB) of MSS.

In 2020, the United States Department of Justice indicted two MSS contractors who were involved in hacking Moderna, a biotechnology company developing a vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released a security advisory regarding hacking by groups affiliated with the MSS.

In March 2024, the United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and UK government sanctioned an MSS front company called Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology and affiliated individuals for placing malware in critical infrastructure and breaching the UK Electoral Commission.

In September 2024, Salt Typhoon, an advanced persistent threat affiliated with the MSS, gained access to multiple internet service providers in the U.S. and attempted to gain access to the phones of staff of the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign as well as those of Donald Trump and JD Vance.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj/2024-09-26&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/2024/10/06/salt-typhoon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveillance of ethnic minorities ===
Domestically, the MSS undertakes surveillance of ethnic minorities, especially in Tibet and Xinjiang.

=== Surveillance and harassment of dissidents abroad ===
According to Nicholas Eftimiades, &quot;[o]ne of the MSS&#x27;s responsibilities has been penetrating Chinese dissident groups abroad — what they call the &#x27;five poisons&#x27;: democracy advocates, Taiwan, Tibetans, Uyghurs and Falun Gong.&quot;

In the United States, MSS officers were reported to have worked with students affiliated with local university chapters of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association to surveil other students.
During the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay, MSS agents coordinated counter-protesters to disrupt pro-Tibetan independence demonstrations in San Francisco.

In September 2020, Baimadajie Angwang, a New York City Police Officer of Tibetan descent, was arrested for allegedly gathering information on the Tibetan American community for the MSS. He was also accused of trying to recruit informants inside the local Tibetan community. In January 2023, federal prosecutors dismissed all charges against the officer.

In March 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted individuals, including an MSS officer, for surveilling and conspiring to harass Chinese American pro-democracy dissidents, including political candidate Xiong Yan, Olympic figure skater Alysa Liu and her father Arthur Liu. In May 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice charged a US citizen for spying under the direction of the MSS on Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, Taiwan independence supporters, and Uyghur and Tibetan activists.

In December 2023, a joint investigation by &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot; reported an agent of the Zhejiang branch of the MSS had been tasked with discrediting German anthropologist Adrian Zenz.

=== United front activities ===
The MSS also leverages so-called &quot;united front&quot; work for intelligence activity. In 1939, Zhou Enlai espoused &quot;nestling intelligence within the united front&quot; while also &quot;using the united front to push forth intelligence.&quot; According to Australian analyst Alex Joske, &quot;the united front system provides networks, cover and institutions that intelligence agencies use for their own purposes.&quot; Joske added that &quot;united front networks are a golden opportunity for Party&#x27;s spies because they represent groups of Party-aligned individuals who are relatively receptive to clandestine recruitment.&quot;

Roger Faligot stated that the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre led to the &quot;growing use of party organizations, such as the United Front Work Department and friendship associations, as fronts for intelligence operations.&quot;

== Directors ==

Below are the heads of the MSS and its predecessors, the Social Affairs Department and Central Investigation Department. Since 1983, agency heads carry the title of Minister of State Security (MSS), reporting directly to the State Council.

=== Social Affairs Department (1939–1955) ===

=== Central Investigation Department (1955–1983) ===


=== Ministry of State Security (1983–present) ===



Notes: Wang Dongxing directed the Central Investigation Department while it was under Special Unit 8341 under the pressures of the Cultural Revolution. Succeeding him, Kang Sheng directed the department while it was under the Second Department of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

== Organization ==
According to the Federation of American Scientists, MSS headquarters is in the Xiyuan () area of Beijing&#x27;s Haidian District. According to David Wise, Xiyuan also contains other MSS facilities. Bureaus may use cover identities under &quot;one institution with two names&quot;.

Many MSS personnel are trained at the University of International Relations in Haidian, due north of MSS housing and offices in Xiyuan, as well as Jiangnan Social University.

=== China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations ===

The Ministry of State Security operates the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR, pronounced ), an academic think tank on international affairs. 

CICIR was the eighth bureau of the former Central Investigation Department (CID) of the CCP Central Committee, but became the eleventh bureau of the MSS when the CID was merged with the counter-intelligence department of the Ministry of Public Security to form the new Ministry of State Security in 1983.

Although the Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged CICIR&#x27;s connection to the MSS, numerous press reports, scholars, and think tanks within and without China have detailed the relationship between the two organizations. The institute is managed by the MSS, and overseen by the CCP Central Committee. The organization itself does not speak much about its relationship with the Chinese government; however, and Chinese media reports rarely acknowledge the institution&#x27;s ties with the regime.

<text>Amrita Pritam (; 31 August 1919 – 31 October 2005) was an Indian novelist, essayist and poet, who wrote in Punjabi and Hindi. A prominent figure in Punjabi literature, she is the recipient of the 1956 Sahitya Akademi Award. Her body of work comprised over 100 books of poetry, fiction, biographies, essays, a collection of Punjabi folk songs and an autobiography that were all translated into several Indian and foreign languages.

Pritam is best remembered for her poignant poem, &quot;Ajj aakhaan Waris Shah nu&quot; (Today I invoke Waris Shah – &quot;Ode to Waris Shah&quot;), an elegy to the 18th-century Punjabi poet, and an expression of her anguish over massacres during the partition of British India. As a novelist, her most noted work was &quot;Pinjar&quot; (&quot;The Skeleton&quot;, 1950), in which she created her memorable character, &quot;Puro&quot;, an epitome of violence against women, loss of humanity and ultimate surrender to existential fate; the novel was made into an award-winning film, &quot;Pinjar&quot; (2003).

When British India was partitioned into the independent states of India and Pakistan in 1947, she migrated from Lahore to India, though she remained equally popular in Pakistan throughout her life, as compared to her contemporaries like Mohan Singh and Shiv Kumar Batalvi.

Pritam&#x27;s magnum opus, the long poem &quot;Sunehade&quot;, won her the 1956 Sahitya Akademi Award, making her the first and the only woman to have been given the award for a work in Punjabi. She received the Jnanpith Award, one of India&#x27;s highest literary awards, in 1982 for &quot;Kagaz Te Canvas&quot; (&quot;The Paper and the Canvas&quot;). She was awarded the Padma Shri in 1969, and the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian award, in 2004. In that same year she was honoured with India&#x27;s highest literary award given by the Sahitya Akademi (India&#x27;s Academy of Letters), the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, awarded to &quot;the &quot;immortals of literature&quot;&quot; for lifetime achievement.

==Biography==

===Background===
Amrita Pritam was born as Amrit Kaur in 1919 in modern-day district of Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab, in British India into a Khatri Sikh family the only child of Raj Bibi, who was a school teacher, and Kartar Singh Hitkari, who was a poet, a scholar of the Braj Bhasha language, and the editor of a literary journal. Besides this, he was a &quot;pracharak&quot; – a preacher of the Sikh faith. Amrita&#x27;s mother died when she was eleven. Soon after, she and her father moved to Lahore, where she lived till her migration to India in 1947. Confronting adult responsibilities and besieged by loneliness following her mother&#x27;s death, she began to write at an early age. Her first anthology of poems, &quot;Amrit Lehran&quot; (&quot;Immortal Waves&quot;) was published in 1936, at age sixteen, the year she married Pritam Singh, an editor to whom she was engaged in early childhood, and changed her name from Amrit Kaur to Amrita Pritam. Half a dozen collections of poems followed between 1936 and 1943.

Though she began her journey as a romantic poet, she soon shifted gears, and became part of the Progressive Writers&#x27; Movement. The effect was seen in her collection, &quot;Lok Peed&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Anguish&quot;, 1944), which openly criticised the war-torn economy after the Bengal famine of 1943. She was also involved in social work to a certain extent, and participated in such activities wholeheartedly after Independence, when social activist Guru Radha Kishan took the initiative to bring the first Janta Library in Delhi. This was inaugurated by Balraj Sahni and Aruna Asaf Ali, and she contributed to the occasion. This study centre cum library is still running at Clock Tower, Delhi. She also worked at a radio station in Lahore for a while, before the partition of India.

M. S. Sathyu, the director of the partition movie &quot;Garam Hava&quot; (1973), paid a theatrical tribute to her through his performance &#x27;Ek Thee Amrita&#x27;.

===Partition of India===
One million people, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims died from communal violence that followed the partition of India in 1947, and left Amrita Pritam a Punjabi refugee at age 28, when she left Lahore and moved to New Delhi. Subsequently, in 1947, while she was pregnant with her son, and traveling from Dehradun to Delhi, she expressed anguish on a piece of paper like the poem, &quot;Ajj Aakhaan Waris Shah Nu&quot; (I ask Waris Shah Today); this poem was to later immortalize her and become the most poignant reminder of the horrors of Partition. The poem addressed to the Sufi poet Waris Shah, author of the tragic saga of Heer and Ranjah and with whom she shares her birthplace.

Amrita Pritam worked until 1961 in the Punjabi service of All India Radio, Delhi. After her divorce in 1960, her work became more feminist. Many of her stories and poems drew on the unhappy experience of her marriage. A number of her works have been translated into English, French, Danish, Japanese, Mandarin, and other languages from Punjabi and Urdu, including her autobiographical works &quot;Black Rose&quot; and &quot;Rasidi Ticket&quot; (Revenue Stamp).

The first of Amrita Pritam&#x27;s books to be filmed was &quot;Dharti Sagar te Sippiyan&quot;, as &quot;Kadambari&quot; (1975), followed by &quot;Unah Di Kahani&quot;, as &quot;Daaku&quot; (Dacoit, 1976), directed by Basu Bhattacharya. Her novel &quot;Pinjar&quot; (The Skeleton, 1950) narrates the story of partition riots along with the crisis of women who suffered during the times. It was made into an award-winning Hindi movie by Chandra Prakash Dwivedi, because of its humanism: &quot;Amritaji has portrayed the suffering of people of both the countries.&quot; &quot;Pinjar&quot; was shot in a border region of Rajasthan and Punjab.

She edited &quot;Nagmani&quot;, a monthly literary magazine in Punjabi for several years, which she ran together with Imroz, for 33 years; though after Partition she wrote prolifically in Hindi as well. Later in life, she turned to Osho and wrote introductions for several books of Osho, including &quot;Ek Onkar Satnam&quot;, and also started writing on spiritual themes and dreams, producing works like &quot;Kaal Chetna&quot; (&quot;Time Consciousness&quot;) and &quot;Agyat Ka Nimantran&quot; (&quot;Call of the Unknown&quot;). She had also published autobiographies, titled, &quot;Kala Gulab&quot; (&quot;Black Rose&quot;, 1968), &quot;Rasidi Ticket&quot; (&quot;The Revenue Stamp&quot;, 1976), and &quot;Aksharon kay Saayee&quot; (&quot;Shadows of Words&quot;).

===Awards and honors===
Amrita was the first recipient of Punjab Rattan Award conferred upon her by Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh. She was the first female recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1956 for &quot;Sunehadey&quot; (poetic diminutive of the Punjabi word &quot;ਸੁਨੇਹੇ&quot; (Sunehe), &quot;Messages&quot;), Amrita Pritam received the Bhartiya Jnanpith Award, India&#x27;s highest literary award, in 1982 for &quot;Kagaj te Canvas (Paper and Canvas).&quot; She received the Padma Shri (1969) and Padma Vibhushan (2004), India&#x27;s second highest civilian award, and Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, India&#x27;s highest literary award, also in 2004. She received D.Litt. honorary degrees, from many universities including, Delhi University (1973), Jabalpur University (1973) and Vishwa Bharati (1987).

She also received the international Vaptsarov Award from the Republic of Bulgaria (1979) and Degree of Officer dens, Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Officier) by the French Government (1987). She was nominated as a member of Rajya Sabha 1986–92. Towards the end of her life, she was awarded by Pakistan&#x27;s Punjabi Academy, to which she had remarked, &quot;Bade dino baad mere Maike ko meri Yaad aayi..&quot; (My motherland has remembered me after a long time); and also Punjabi poets of Pakistan, sent her a chaddar, from the tombs of Waris Shah, and fellow Sufi mystic poets Bulle Shah and Sultan Bahu.

==Personal life==

In 1935, Amrita married Pritam Singh, son of a hosiery merchant of Lahore&#x27;s Anarkali bazaar. They had two children together, a son and a daughter. She had an unrequited affection for poet Sahir Ludhianvi. The story of this love is depicted in her autobiography, &quot;Rasidi Ticket&quot; (Revenue Stamp). When another woman, singer Sudha Malhotra came into Sahir&#x27;s life, Amrita found solace in the companionship of the artist and writer Inderjeet Imroz. She spent the last forty years of her life with Imroz, who also designed most of her book covers and made her the subject of his several paintings. Their life together is also the subject of a book, &quot;Amrita Imroz: A Love Story&quot;.

She died in her sleep on 31 October 2005 at the age of 86 in New Delhi, after a long illness. She was survived by her partner Imroz, daughter Kandlla, son Navraj Kwatra, daughter-in-law Alka, and her grandchildren, Kartik, Noor, Aman and Shilpi. Navraj Kwatra was found murdered in his Borivali apartment in 2012. Three men were accused of the murder but were acquitted due to lack of evidence.

==Legacy==
In 2007, an audio album titled, &#x27;Amrita recited by Gulzar&#x27; was released by noted lyricist Gulzar, with poems of Amrita Pritam recited by him. A film on her life is also in production.
On 31 August 2019, Google honoured her by commemorating her 100th birth anniversary with a Doodle. The accompanying write up read as, &quot;Today’s Doodle celebrates Amrita Pritam, one of history’s foremost female Punjabi writers, who &#x27;dared to live the life she imagines.&#x27; Born in Gujranwala, British India, 100 years ago today, Pritam published her first collection of verse at the age of 16.&quot;

<doc id="1202210" wikidata="Q5397407" url="?curid=1202210" title="Escort destroyer">
<text>An escort destroyer was a small warship built to full naval standards which was optimised for air-defence and anti-submarine duties in wartime, but which retained many of the capabilities of a traditional fleet destroyer, enabling it to conduct operations in conjunction with main fleet units as well as carrying out convoy escort and ASW patrols. Typically, escort destroyers had a high enough speed and sufficient armament of guns and torpedoes that they were capable of skirmishing successfully with enemy destroyers and cruisers.

An escort destroyer with United States Navy hull classification symbol DDE was a destroyer (DD) modified for and assigned to a fleet escort role after World War II. These destroyers retained their original hull numbers. Later, in March 1950, the post World War II ASW destroyer (DDK) classification was merged with the DDE classification, resulting in all DDK ships being reclassified as DDE, but again retaining their original hull numbers. On 30 June 1962, the DDE classification was retired, and all DDEs were reclassified as destroyers (DD). 

&quot;Escort destroyers&quot; should not be confused with the cheaper, slower, less capable, and more lightly armed World War II &quot;destroyer escorts&quot;.
==Concept==
Following the outbreak of World War II, the Royal Navy had inadequate numbers of warships suitable for escort of trade convoys. While more modern destroyers were assigned to screen capital ships, destroyers built during World War I were modified to serve as trade convoy escorts. Four V and W-class destroyers were re-armed with modern anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons. Additional V &amp; W destroyers received simpler modifications as shipyard resources became taxed by other wartime needs. The quarterdeck gun was removed to increase depth charge storage, and the after bank of torpedo tubes was replaced by a anti-aircraft gun for escort of convoys in European coastal waters. Destroyers escorting trans-Atlantic convoys also replaced the forecastle gun with hedgehog, removed all torpedo tubes to improve seaworthiness, and replaced one boiler with additional fuel storage to increase range. Similar modifications were made to former United States destroyers obtained through the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Anticipating a possible need to defend convoys supplying NATO allies, the United States Navy modified older destroyers during the Cold War. In the absence of hostilities requiring escort of merchant shipping, escort destroyers operated with anti-submarine warfare carrier (CVS) hunter-killer groups. Operational doctrine anticipated each CVS would be accompanied by eight DDEs. Four DDEs would provide a close screen for the CVS while the other four attacked submarines detected by aircraft.

==&quot;Gearing&quot; class==
 conversions were modified by replacing the B position 5&quot;/38 caliber guns (mount 52) with either RUR-4 Weapon Alpha or hedgehog. A second Weapon Alpha was sometimes installed at the aft end of the 01 level above the aft 5&quot;/38 gun mount.

==&quot;Fletcher&quot; class==
 conversions removed all torpedo tubes and three 5&quot;/38 caliber gun mounts to retain only the main deck mounts fore and aft. A Weapon Alpha replaced the B position gun mount.

Similar modifications were made by the Royal Navy, usually to older, World War I era vessels, to fit them for specific tasks such as convoy work.

<text>Weymouth is a rural village located in Digby County, Nova Scotia on the Sissiboo River near its terminus on Baie Ste. Marie. 

==History==
The area was settled in the 1760s by New England Planters. The town was formally founded by Loyalist James Moody in 1783 (the year that the Treaty of Paris was signed to end the American Revolution). Current-day Weymouth was once called Weymouth Bridge, and Weymouth North was called Weymouth. Weymouth is supposed to have been named in honour of the previous settlement of the Strickland family from Weymouth, Massachusetts.

Shipping and shipbuilding were the main industry in the mid-19th century. Remnants of docks can be seen on the Northeast side of the Sissiboo today. Goods such as lumber were loaded on ships at these docks and shipped all over the world. Until recently, Weymouth housed the oldest general store in Eastern Canada. Opened in 1837, the store was called The Trading Post, but closed in 2009. The village also houses one of the original offices of the Merchants Bank of Halifax (later renamed Royal Bank of Canada). This building is now part of the aforementioned Weymouth Trading Post building. The Dominion Atlantic Railway stopped running through Weymouth in March 1990. 
Nearby Weymouth Falls was home to one of the world&#x27;s greatest boxers, Sam Langford (1886–1956). Although he was never officially crowned World Champion, he held titles from England, Spain and Mexico.

===Disasters===
On 4 August 1909, 2 churches, a hotel, and several other buildings were destroyed by fire. On 2 October 1929 a fire started in the general store of Captain R.D. Barkhouse and swept through the downtown area destroying 25 buildings including retail shops, factories, and private homes. It was estimated that the fire caused approximately $250,000 in damages. No serious injuries or deaths occurred because of the fire. On 6 February 1958, another fire destroyed the boat and furniture plants of Weymouth Industries Ltd., and in June 1959 six businesses were wiped out due to fire. 

The Sissiboo River overflowed in March 2003, flooding the town under almost two feet of water.

In 2017 one of the oldest buildings in Canada located in Weymouth was destroyed by fire. The blaze also consumed another building and it damaged three other buildings. It took nine Fire Departments and over 130 firefighters to contain the fire.

=== New France (&quot;Electric City&quot;) ===

The lumber community of New France, located about inland from Weymouth, was founded by the Stehelin family who came to the area from Normandy, France in 1892. The community they established was notable for its early use of hydroelectric power generation, earning it the local nickname &quot;The Electric City&quot;. Also notable was the Stehelin family&#x27;s railroad, the Weymouth and New France Railway, constructed using logs as tracks, which they used to bring lumber to the company wharf at Weymouth. As many as 1.5 million board feet of timber were shipped annually from New France to South America and England. The railway was destroyed by fire in 1907 and the business ceased not long afterwards. There is little left of New France except for the foundations of the city buildings. J.D. Irving, recent owners of the land, established walking trails and interpretive signs at the site and fixed the foundations so they are safe for visitors to explore. The lands were purchased by the Province of Nova Scotia on 3 February 2010, thus assuring the protection of this unusual part of the province.

==Geography==
Modern day Weymouth straddles the Sissiboo River. This river swells approximately every six hours as salt water backs up from the high tides of the Bay of Fundy into St. Mary&#x27;s Bay.

Weymouth is situated on the border between the provincial electoral districts of Clare and Digby-Annapolis. It is located 33 kilometres from Digby, 72 kilometres from Yarmouth and 250 kilometres from the capital of Nova Scotia, Halifax.

Smaller villages surrounding Weymouth proper are Weymouth Falls, Weaver Settlement, Ohio, Southville, Riverdale, Danvers, Hassett, Saint Bernard and New Edinburgh.

Two exits (27 and 28) on Highway 101 are the primary access to the town. Trunk 1 runs through the village and was the main thoroughfare from the Annapolis Valley to Yarmouth prior to the construction of Highway 101.

===Climate===
Weymouth has a humid continental climate influenced by its maritime position. It is shielded from some Atlantic influence by having a landmass between itself and the main ocean, but it is still moderated compared to areas in the interior of the continent.

==Economy==
Fur farming, especially mink, fishing, and logging are the principal industries in the area.

==Demographics==
The Village of Weymouth comprises many different ethnic backgrounds. Primarily populated by descendants of the loyalists, African-Canadian and White, it also is home to a few Acadians, Mi&#x27;kmaq and people of German ancestry.

==Weymouth in fiction==
Author Josephine Leslie (pseudonym R. A. Dick) frequently summer vacationed in Weymouth North. During her visits she would imagine living during Weymouth&#x27;s heyday (age of sail) and was inspired to write &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot;.

Weymouth and Weymouth Falls appear mythologized in George Elliott Clarke&#x27;s poetical work &quot;Whylah Falls&quot; (1990).

<text>Examilia () is a town in the municipality of Corinth, Greece. It is situated about 5 km south of Corinth, and 6 km west of Kechries (ancient Cenchreae). The name likely derives from the adjacent Hexamilion Wall, although it had not been in use for some time before the town was founded.

== History ==
The town was first attested in 1676 by French archaeologist Jacob Spon as an Albanian (Arvanite) village. In present times only few of the inhabitants are still able to speak Arvanitika.
According to the inhabitants of the town they are descended from Albanian settlers that arrived in Corinth earlier than the ones of Xylokeriza. Based on Spon and Francis Wheler modern historians assume that the ancestors of Examilians had settled the area at least since the late 17th century. Examilians have been reported to not always be in good terms with the inhabitants of Xylokeriza. According to some scholars the source of these local differences is that Examilians descend from earlier settlers than the ones of Xylokeriza.

==Demographics==
==Other==
The population also has Romani minority. On February 18, 2000, clashes occurred with four police officers and the minorities.

<text>Illinois Route 6 is a 4-lane freeway entirely in Peoria County in central Illinois. It begins as a northern extension of Interstate 474 at Interstate 74 west of Peoria, and ends at Illinois Route 29 at the 9th Mile in Mossville, south of Chillicothe. The freeway currently has a total length of , including the connector ramp to Illinois 29.

== Route description ==
Although fairly short, Illinois 6 draws more traffic than a rural highway because it passes through the developing north and northwest edge of Peoria. A stretch of road around the U.S. Route 150 (War Memorial Drive) exit has become a major commercial development area that now includes a major mall and a nearby strip mall with over 30 movie screens between them. In addition, new development is occurring rapidly around the other interchanges of Allen Road (old Illinois Route 174), Knoxville Avenue (Illinois Route 40), and Illinois Route 29.

== History ==
SBI Route 6 initially ran from Fulton to Chicago. It roughly followed present-day US 30, Illinois Route 38, and Roosevelt Road. In 1935, IL 6 was decommissioned and was replaced with a portion of US 330 (now IL 38/Roosevelt Road) and US 30.

The Illinois Route 6 designation remained decommissioned until the early 1980s when the present freeway north of Peoria was finished. By 1988, the freeway was extended to Illinois Route 29 near Mossville.

==Future==
Several plans have been considered for continuing the Illinois 6 corridor. One is extending Illinois 6 into a loop by building a bridge over the Illinois River and running the highway south to Interstates 74 and 474 near Interstate 155 in Morton. 

In 2013, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn proposed a $12.3 billion road plan that earmarked funds for engineering work and corridor studies, renewing interest in connecting Route 6 with I-74.

<doc id="1202255" wikidata="Q409071" url="?curid=1202255" title="Rhodonite">
<text>Rhodonite is a manganese inosilicate, with the formula (Mn, Fe, Mg, Ca)SiO3, and member of the pyroxenoid group of minerals, crystallizing in the triclinic system. It commonly occurs as cleavable to compact masses with a rose-red color (its name comes ), often tending to brown due to surface oxidation. The rose-red hue is caused by the manganese cation (Mn).

Rhodonite crystals often have a thick tabular habit, but are rare. It has a perfect, prismatic cleavage, almost at right angles. The hardness is 5.5–6.5, and the specific gravity is 3.4–3.7; luster is vitreous, being less frequently pearly on cleavage surfaces. The manganese is often partly replaced by iron, magnesium, calcium, and sometimes zinc, which may sometimes be present in considerable amounts; a greyish-brown variety containing as much as 20% of calcium oxide is called &quot;bustamite&quot;; &quot;fowlerite&quot; is a zinciferous variety containing 7% of zinc oxide.

The inosilicate (chain silicate) structure of rhodonite has a repeat unit of five silica tetrahedra. The rare polymorph &quot;pyroxmangite&quot;, formed at different conditions of pressure and temperature, has the same chemical composition but a repeat unit of seven tetrahedra.

Rhodonite has also been worked as an ornamental stone. In the iron and manganese mines at Pajsberg near Filipstad and Långban in Värmland, Sweden, small brilliant and translucent crystals (pajsbergite) and cleavage masses occur. Fowlerite occurs as large, rough crystals, somewhat resembling pink feldspar, with franklinite and zinc ores in granular limestone at Franklin Furnace in New Jersey.

Rhodonite is the official gemstone of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

<doc id="1202260" wikidata="Q7554336" url="?curid=1202260" title="Software patents under TRIPs Agreement">
<text>The WTO&#x27;s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), particularly Article 27, is occasionally referenced in the political debate on the international legal framework for the [[software patent|patentability of software]], and on whether software and computer-implemented inventions should be considered as a field of technology.

== Article 27 of TRIPS==
Article 27 paragraph 1 of TRIPS provides for that:
The only allowable exceptions to this provision are laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same Article 27, and neither software nor computer programs are mentioned therein. The following elements may be excluded from patentability by WTO members under TRIPs:
* (...) inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect &quot;ordre public&quot; or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law.&quot;(paragraph 2)&quot;
* diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals; &quot;(paragraph 3(a))&quot; and
* plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and microbiological processes. (...) &quot;(paragraph 3(b))&quot;.

However, despite not being mentioned as an exception in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 27 TRIPs, &#x27;pure software&#x27; is not considered an invention under European law. The decision of the contracting states of the TRIPS Agreement, i.e. the WTO member states, was that patents should be granted in all fields of technology, without discrimination (Art. 27(1) TRIPS). However, according to Paul Hartnack, former Comptroller-General of the UK Patent Office, it is arguable whether pure software is a technology, or is, in many cases, capable of industrial application. He argues that its acceptance as such under European jurisdiction would be a political matter based on economic interest.

Art. 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties requires &quot;ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty&quot;. The same provision requires interpretation within the light of the object and purpose of the treaty.

There have been no dispute settlement procedures regarding software patents. Its relevance for patentability in the domains of, for example, computer-implemented business methods, computer science and software information technology remains uncertain, since the TRIPS agreement is subject to interpretation, like all legal texts.

== Relationship with copyright protection ==
Article 10 paragraph 1 of TRIPS provides that a computer program is a type of work which is eligible for protection under copyright law:
This argument was used by some adversaries of software patents to contend that software patents would not be allowed by the TRIPS agreement.
TRIPS textbooks see no conflict, for instance Correa &amp; Yusuf
notes that software patents complement copyright because copyright does not protect underlying ideas.

<text>The 1st Confederate States Congress, consisting of the Confederate States Senate and the Confederate States House of Representatives, convened between February 18, 1862, and February 17, 1864. This assembly took place during the first two years of Jefferson Davis&#x27;s presidency, convening at the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, Virginia.

==Sessions==
The following sessions were held during the period February 18, 1862, and February 17, 1864, at the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, Virginia.

==Members==

===Senate===
Confederate States senators were elected by the state legislatures, or appointed by state governors to fill casual vacancies until the legislature elected a new senator. It was intended that one-third of the Senate would commence fresh six-year terms with each subsequent Congress following the inaugural one.

Preceding the names in the list below are Senate class numbers, which indicate the cycle of their terms. In this Congress, all senators were newly elected. Senators of Class 1 served a two-year term, expiring at the end of this Congress, requiring a new election for the six-year term,1864–1870. Class 2 senators served what was intended to be a four-year term, due to end on the expiry of the next Congress in 1866. Class 3 senators were meant to serve a six-year term, due to expire at the end of the Third Confederate Congress in 1868. As the Confederate Congress lasted less than four full years, the distinction between classes 2 and 3 was ultimately academic.

The members of the classes were selected by drawing of lots, which was done during the meeting of the Senate on February 21, 1862.

The class is indicated before the name.

<text>The Salt Lake City School District (SLCSD) is the oldest public school district in Utah. Boundaries for the district are identical to the city limits for Salt Lake City. Employing about 1,300 teachers who instruct about 25,000 students K-12, the district is the ninth largest in the state, as of 2009, behind Granite, Davis, Alpine, Jordan, Canyons, Weber, Nebo, and Washington. Two of the district&#x27;s high schools, East and West, are over 100 years old.

== High schools ==
All high schools in the Salt Lake City District serve grades 9-12. The district operates three high schools: East High School near the University of Utah serving the southwest and central-east part of the city, West High School in western downtown serving the north and west area, and Highland High School near Sugar House Park serving the southeast. Additionally, the district runs an alternative/adult education school, Horizonte High School, located on Main Street in the south central city, and the new Innovations Early College High School, a &quot;student centered, personalized education&quot; school that will focus on learning through digital technology, located in the south-central part of the city attached to Salt Lake Community College South City campus.

A high school no longer extant, South High School, located at State St. and 1700 South, once served the southern part of Salt Lake City. The district built this school during the Great Depression to accommodate about 1000 students from the private LDS High School, which closed in 1931. South High was located in some of the poorer areas of Salt Lake City with a population increasingly devoid of school age children by the 1980s. Falling enrollment throughout the school district prompted the district to close the fledgling South High in 1988. Schools with older facilities, such as East and West, as well as Highland High School received students from portions of the former South High school boundaries. The district donated the South High School school building to the Salt Lake Community College, where it currently serves as its South City campus.

===East High School===

East High School serves grades nine through twelve. East High School was founded in 1914 and currently has an enrolled student body of 2,109. It is located at 840 S 1300 E in Salt Lake City&#x27;s East Bench. The current principal is Ryan Oaks. The school mascot is the leopard, and the school colors are red and white.

===Highland High School===

Highland High School opened in 1956 and has a student body of about 1,546. It is located at 2166 South 1700 East, next to Sugar House Park. The current principal is Jeremy Chatterton. The school mascot is the ram, and the school colors are black and white. Highland also has a long-standing rivalry with East High School.

===West High School===
West High School is located at 241 North 300 West in Salt Lake City. Founded in 1890 as Salt Lake High School, West High is the oldest high school in the Salt Lake School District and the second oldest in Utah. It is the highest-ranked high school in Utah according to &quot;Newsweek&quot;. West High has a student population of 2,559 under principal Ford White. In addition to students in grades nine through twelve, West High School serves a group of 7th and 8th graders in an Extended Learning Program (ELP). The school mascot is the panther, and the school colors are red and black.

== Middle schools ==
There are five middle schools in the Salt Lake City School District. All middle schools in the district teach grades 7-8, except Glendale which teaches 6-8.

In addition, West High School offers grade 7 and 8 for some students as part of the &quot;Extended Learning Program&quot; (ELP).

== K-8 schools ==
== Elementary schools ==
The district operates 27 elementary schools. Almost all elementary schools in the district serve grades K-6. Riley, Edison, Parkview, and Mountain View serve grades K-5 (these 6th graders attend Glendale Middle). Most elementary schools offer preschool services.
In 1999, the district approved a bond that would reconstruct 20 of the elementary schools as well as Northwest Middle School. In addition, two elementary schools were closed for the 2002–2003 school season (Rosslyn Heights in Sugar House and Lowell in The Avenues) while serving as temporary campuses for the reconstructed schools. They were originally going to choose two schools off of a list of eight to be closed, and eventually the school board decided to close Lowell and Rosslyn Heights (the latter of which was not on the list). This aroused considerable protest from parents, teachers, and even board members, and lawsuits were filed against the district. However, they failed to keep the schools open.

==Charter schools==
Public charter schools in the district include Open Classroom, an elementary and middle school that has been part of the district since 1977 and is currently housed in the building that once was Lowell Elementary and Open High School of Utah, established in 2009.

<text>The Personal Software Process (PSP) is a structured software development process that is designed to help software engineers better understand and improve their performance by bringing discipline to the way they develop software and tracking their predicted and actual development of the code. It clearly shows developers how to manage the quality of their products, how to make a sound plan, and how to make commitments. It also offers them the data to justify their plans. They can evaluate their work and suggest improvement direction by analyzing and reviewing development time, defects, and size data. The PSP was created by Watts Humphrey to apply the underlying principles of the Software Engineering Institute&#x27;s (SEI) Capability Maturity Model (CMM) to the software development practices of a single developer. It claims to give software engineers the process skills necessary to work on a team software process (TSP) team.

&quot;Personal Software Process&quot; and &quot;PSP&quot; are registered service marks of the Carnegie Mellon University.

==Objectives==
The PSP aims to provide software engineers with disciplined methods for improving personal software development processes. The PSP helps software engineers to:

* Improve their estimating and planning skills.
* Make commitments they can keep.
* Manage the quality of their projects.
* Reduce the number of defects in their work.

==PSP structure==
PSP training follows an evolutionary improvement approach: an engineer learning to integrate the PSP into his or her process begins at the first level – PSP0 – and progresses in process maturity to the final level – PSP2.1. Each Level has detailed scripts, checklists and templates to guide the engineer through required steps and helps the engineer improve their own personal software process. Humphrey encourages proficient engineers to customize these scripts and templates as they gain an understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses.

;Process
The input to PSP is the requirements; requirements document is completed and delivered to the engineer.

;PSP0, PSP0.1 (Introduces process discipline and measurement)
PSP0 has 3 phases: planning, development (design, code, compile, test) and a post mortem. 
A baseline is established for current process measuring: time spent on programming, faults injected/removed and size of a program.
In a post mortem, the engineer ensures all data for the projects has been properly recorded and analysed. 
PSP0.1 advances the process by adding a coding standard, a size measurement and the development of a personal process improvement plan (PIP). In the PIP, the engineer records ideas for improving his own process.

;PSP1, PSP1.1 (Introduces estimating and planning)
Based upon the baseline data collected in PSP0 and PSP0.1, the engineer estimates how large a new program will be and prepares a test report (PSP1).
Accumulated data from previous projects is used to estimate the total time.
Each new project will record the actual time spent.
This information is used for task and schedule planning and estimation (PSP1.1).

;PSP2, PSP2.1 (Introduces quality management and design)
PSP2 adds two new phases: design review and code review. Defect prevention and removal of them are the focus at the PSP2. Engineers learn to evaluate and improve their process by measuring how long tasks take and the number of defects they inject and remove in each phase of development.
Engineers construct and use checklists for design and code reviews.
PSP2.1 introduces design specification and analysis techniques

(PSP3 is a legacy level that has been superseded by TSP.)

==The importance of data==
One of the core aspects of the PSP is using historical data to analyze and improve process performance. PSP data collection is supported by four main elements:
* Scripts
* Measures
* Standards
* Forms

The PSP scripts provide expert-level guidance to following the process steps and they provide a framework for applying the PSP measures. The PSP has four core measures:
* Size – the size measure for a product part, such as lines of code (LOC).
* Effort – the time required to complete a task, usually recorded in minutes.
* Quality – the number of defects in the product.
* Schedule – a measure of project progression, tracked against planned and actual completion dates.

Applying standards to the process can ensure the data is precise and consistent.
Data is logged in forms, normally using a PSP software tool. The SEI has developed a PSP tool and there are also open source options available, such as Process Dashboard.

The key data collected in the PSP tool are time, defect, and size data – the time spent in each phase; when and where defects were injected, found, and fixed; and the size of the product parts. Software developers use many other measures that are derived from these three basic measures to understand and improve their performance. Derived measures include:

* estimation accuracy (size/time)
* prediction intervals (size/time)
* time in phase distribution
* defect injection distribution
* defect removal distribution
* productivity
* reuse percentage
* cost performance index
* planned value
* earned value
* predicted earned value
* defect density
* defect density by phase
* defect removal rate by phase
* defect removal leverage
* review rates
* process yield
* phase yield
* failure cost of quality (COQ)
* appraisal COQ
* appraisal/failure COQ ratio

==Planning and tracking==
Logging time, defect, and size data is an essential part of planning and tracking PSP projects, as historical data is used to improve estimating accuracy.

The PSP uses the PROxy-Based Estimation (PROBE) method to improve a developer&#x27;s estimating skills for more accurate project planning. For project tracking, the PSP uses the earned value method.

The PSP also uses statistical techniques, such as correlation, linear regression, and standard deviation, to translate data into useful information for improving estimating, planning and quality. These statistical formulas are calculated by the PSP tool.

==Using the PSP==
The PSP is intended to help a developer improve their personal process; therefore PSP developers are expected to continue adapting the process to ensure it meets their personal needs.

===PSP and the TSP===
In practice, PSP skills are used in a TSP team environment. TSP teams consist of PSP-trained developers who volunteer for areas of project responsibility, so the project is managed by the team itself. Using personal data gathered using their PSP skills; the team makes the plans, the estimates, and controls the quality.

Using PSP process methods can help TSP teams to meet their schedule commitments and produce high quality software. For example, according to research by Watts Humphrey, a third of all software projects fail, but an SEI study on 20 TSP projects in 13 different organizations found that TSP teams missed their target schedules by an average of only six percent.

Successfully meeting schedule commitments can be attributed to using historical data to make more accurate estimates, so projects are based on realistic plans – and by using PSP quality methods, they produce low-defect software, which reduces time spent on removing defects in later phases, such as integration and acceptance testing.

===PSP and other methodologies===
The PSP is a personal process that can be adapted to suit the needs of the individual developer. It is not specific to any programming or design methodology; therefore it can be used with different methodologies, including Agile software development.

Software engineering methods can be considered to vary from predictive through adaptive. The PSP is a predictive methodology, and Agile is considered adaptive, but despite their differences, the TSP/PSP and Agile share several concepts and approaches – particularly in regard to team organization. They both enable the team to:

* Define their goals and standards.
* Estimate and schedule the work.
* Determine realistic and attainable schedules.
* Make plans and process improvements.

Both Agile and the TSP/PSP share the idea of team members taking responsibility for their own work and working together to agree on a realistic plan, creating an environment of trust and accountability. However, the TSP/PSP differs from Agile in its emphasis on documenting the process and its use of data for predicting and defining project schedules.

===Quality===
High-quality software is the goal of the PSP, and quality is measured in terms of defects. For the PSP, a quality process should produce low-defect software that meets the user needs.

The PSP phase structure enables PSP developers to catch defects early. By catching defects early, the PSP can reduce the amount of time spent in later phases, such as Test.

The PSP theory is that it is more economical and effective to remove defects as close as possible to where and when they were injected, so software engineers are encouraged to conduct personal reviews for each phase of development. Therefore, the PSP phase structure includes two review phases:

* Design Review
* Code Review

To do an effective review, you need to follow a structured review process. The PSP recommends using checklists to help developers to consistently follow an orderly procedure.

The PSP follows the premise that when people make mistakes, their errors are usually predictable, so PSP developers can personalize their checklists to target their own common errors. Software engineers are also expected to complete process improvement proposals, to identify areas of weakness in their current performance that they should target for improvement. Historical project data, which exposes where time is spent and defects introduced, help developers to identify areas to improve.

PSP developers are also expected to conduct personal reviews before their work undergoes a peer or team review.

==Certification==
A certification covering PSP is offered by the SEI at Carnegie Mellon University. The steps to becoming an SEI-Certified PSP Developer are: learn the PSP; take the certification exam; maintain credentials. 
The PSP Developer examination is based on concepts found in the PSP Body of Knowledge. The SEI maintains an FAQ on certification.

<text>Watanabe ( and other variants) is a Japanese surname derived from the noble and samurai Watanabe clan, a branch of the Minamoto clan, descending from the Emperor Saga (786-842), the 52nd Emperor of Japan, and refers to a location called &#x27;Watanabe no tsu&#x27; which was settled by the Watanabe clan, who took the name of the place. It was located in the medieval period near the mouth of the Yodogawa River in Settsu Province, in present-day city of Osaka.



==History==

===Origin===
The surname Watanabe comes from the Watanabe clan founded by Watanabe no Tsuna (953-1025), of the Saga Genji branch of the Minamoto clan, and his official name was Minamoto no Tsuna. He established the Watanabe branch of the Minamoto clan, taking the name from his stronghold at Watanabe no tsu, a port on the Yodogawa River in Settsu Province, and in 1020 he was appointed Tango no Kami (Governor of Tango Province). He was the son of Minamoto no Atsuru (933-953), married to a daughter of the &quot;Chinjufu-shōgun&quot; (Commander in chief of the defense of the north) Minamoto no Mitsunaka (912-997); he was the grandson of Minamoto no Tsuko (891-942), Musashi no Kami (Governor of Musashi province); was the great-grandson of Minamoto no Noboru (848-918), Dainagon (Chief Councilor of State); great-great-grandson of Minamoto no Tōru (822-895), Sadaijin (Minister of the Left); and was the great-great-great-grandson of the Emperor Saga (786-842), the 52nd Emperor of Japan. He was the stepgrandson of the Chinjufu-shōgun Minamoto no Mitsunaka, a descendant of the Emperor Seiwa (850-881), and having lost his father the year of his birth, he was adopted by Minamoto no Atsushi, a descendant of the Emperor Ninmyō (808-850), and son in law of Mitsunaka. He was companion in arms to his stepuncle Minamoto no Yorimitsu (944–1021), son of Mitsunaka; and is famous for his military exploits in a number of tales and legends. He is known as one of the Four Guardian Kings (Shitennō) of Yorimitsu, referring to the Buddhist Four Heavenly Kings.

===Heian period to the Genpei war===

Watanabe no Den, great-grandson of Tsuna, received from the Emperor Shirakawa (1053-1129) the hereditary title of Shokan (Governing officer) of the huge Oe no Mikuriya estate, and in Kyoto he inherited the military charges of Takiguchi no musha (Takiguchi warriors Guards of the Imperial Palace), as well as Emonfu (Government office of the Outer Palace Gate Guards) and Hyoefu (Administrative office of Middle Palace Guards).

Dominating Settsu Province as a focal area of maritime transportation in medieval Japan, the Watanabe family spread its influence widely. Their descendants settled in other areas, including Kyushu. 

Watanabe Hisashi (1064-1148 or 1154), also called Minamoto no Hisashi, great-grandson of Tsuna, was appointed Kebiishi (Chief of the police and justice), received the title of Shokan (Governing officer) of Uno no Mikuriya estate in Matsuura (Hizen province, in Kyushu) and called himself Matsuura Hisashi. He ruled the County of Matsuura, the province of Iki, and a part of Sonogi district, and is the ancestor of the Matsuura Watanabe branch, Lords of Hirado castle.

The priest Mongaku Shōnin who urged Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199) to start a war against the Taira, and who managed to get a letter from the Emperor Go-Shirakawa (1127–1192) to Yoritomo, requesting that he set up an army and liberate the country from the tyranny of the Taira, which enabled the Minamoto clan to take up arms, was the son of Watanabe no Endo Mochito.

During the Hōgen rebellion (1156), and the Genpei War (1180–1185), the Watanabe sided with Minamoto no Yorimasa (1106–1180), until his death at the Battle of Uji, then with Minamoto no Yoritomo.

At the Battle of Uji (1180), the opening battle of the Genpei War, the Watanabe clan formed with the warrior monks of Miidera Temple most of the Minamoto clan army.
The Heike Monogatari describes some of the Watanabe samurai present at this battle :
* Watanabe Choshichi Tonō : &quot;He was attired that day in a samurai clothing of light green, and body armour ornamented with cherry blossoms on a yellow ground, and wore a sword with mounts of red copper; in his quiver he carried twenty four arrows feathered with white and under his arm was a bow lacquered in black and bound with red bands&quot;.
* Watanabe no Kiō : &quot;clad in a brocaded hunting suit profusely embroidered with chrysanthemums, and wearing a general&#x27;s armour of scarlet; its name was Kisenaga, and it had been a treasured heirloom for many generations. On his head was a helmet shining with silver stars, and a splendid sword hung at his side. In his quiver were twenty four arrows barred with black on their white feathers, not to speak of the special arrow, feathered with a hawk&#x27;s wing, always carried by the Imperial Guards of the Takiguchi. His bow was a &#x27;shigeto&#x27; of black lacquer with red binding. He rode on (the horse named) Nanryo, while one of his servants followed with a remount and another bore his shield under his arm&quot;.

Both were killed in battle. Were also present that day from the Watanabe clan : Minamoto no Sazuku, Minamoto no Tsuranu, Watanabe Habuku, Minamoto no Okoru, and others, who fought to death and were killed fighting against the Taira.

The Watanabe had a powerful navy, and in 1185 they sent their navy ships to support the Minamoto cause.

In February 1185, the Minamoto army of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, brother of Yoritomo, stayed at Watanabe no tsu, in the lands of the Watanabe clan, to rest, gather troops, army provisions, and prepare a fleet of ships for the raid in Shikoku.

At the Battle of Yashima (March 1185) the Watanabe horsemen proved to be decisive, and due to the fall of Yashima, the Taira clan lost their bases in Shikoku.

At the Battle of Dan-no-ura (April 1185), when the Dowager Empress Kenrei-mon-In, daughter of Taira no Kiyomori, tried to drown herself, she was pulled out by the samurai Watanabe no Mutsuru.

===Kamakura to Muromachi periods===

After the Genpei war, the Matsuura Watanabe received the additional titles of Gokenin (Direct Retainer of the Shogunate), and of Jitō (Military Governor). During the Mongol invasions (1274 and 1281), the Matsuura Watanabe fought fiercely to repel the invaders. Sashibo, the Soryo (Heir) of the Matsuura Watanabe and his cousin Yamashiro Kai, from the Yamashiro Watanabe branch descending from Oi, sixth son of Watanabe Hisashi, were killed in battle fighting against the Mongols.

The Kamachi were direct descendants of Minamoto no Noboru (848-918), like their cousins of the Watanabe clan, and had the titles of Shokan (Governing officer) of Kanzaki no shō estate (Hizen province), of Gokenin, of Jitō (Military Governor) of the County of Mizuma (Chikugo province), and held the court rank of Kizoku (Officer). Minamoto no Hisanao, son of Watanabe Hisashi, was &#x27;Uhyoe no jo&#x27; (Officer of the guards of the Middle Palace), and owner of Mikuriya no shō estate. After the Jōkyū War (1221), Hisanao&#x27;s son, Minamoto no Sanen, was adopted by the Kamachi as their son in law to succeed their estates and titles; he changed his name to Kamachi, and was the founder of the Kamachi Watanabe branch, Lords of Kamachi castle. At the time of the Mongol invasions, Morohisa went to the front as a member of the Matsuura Watanabe clan.

In 1235, the Watanabe clan received from the Kamakura shogunate the responsibility of overseeing large shipments of tax and tributes due the shogunate from the provinces of western and central Japan

During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (1336-1392), the Matsuura Watanabe sided with the Northern Court, and fought at the Battle of Chikugogawa (1359). The Kamachi Watanabe sided with the Southern Court, and Takehisa was killed at the Battle of Tatarahama (1336).

Watanabe Mochi, descendant of Watanabe no Tsuna, rendered distinguished military service to the Shogun Ashikaga Takauji (1305-1358), and was granted the title of Jitō (Military Governor) of Yamada no shō territory (Bingo Province). He is the ancestor of the Yamada Watanabe branch, Lords of Ichijoyama castle, who owned the whole area of the Peninsula of Numakuma. During the Ōnin War (1467-1477), they sided with the Eastern camp. They were treated by the Ashikaga Shoguns as equal to a Shugo (Governor of province), and were allowed to use the &#x27;Shirokasabukuro&#x27; and &#x27;Mosen kuraoi&#x27; seals allowed only to the Shugo in the Muromachi period.

===Sengoku period===

During the 16th century wars, the following Watanabe samurai distinguished themselves :
* Watanabe Tōru († 1543), also called Kayo, descendant of the Matsuura Watanabe, was the son of Watanabe Suguru († 1524), Lord of Nagamiyama castle, and was a General of Mōri Motonari. In 1540, at the Battle of Yoshida-Koriyama, he was the Commander of a detached force, attacked a much larger army and defeated Amago Sanehisa&#x27;s army. In 1543, at the Battle of Gassan-Toda, he was killed in a fierce battle in place of Motonari. After that the Mōri clan continued to give important posts to the Watanabe family, and the Watanabe clan members were honored at the head of the Choshu Mōri Domain&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Kachu-kaiki ceremony for generations.
* Watanabe Hajime (1534-1612), son of Watanabe Tōru, fought at the Battle of Kanbe (1548), against the Hiraga clan of Takayatozaki castle (1551), against the Miya clan of Takiyama castle (1552), at Miyajima (1555) and Moji (1561). In 1586, he took part in the invasion of Kyushu, and in 1588, he went to Kyoto with Mōri Terumoto, and received from Toyotomi Hideyoshi the title of Hida no kami (Governor of Hida Province). He is listed as one of the eighteen Generals of the Mōri.
* Watanabe Tadasu († 1615) was a descendant of the Matsuura Watanabe, and a retainer of the Toyotomi clan. He took a part in the Battle of Dōmyōji (1615), in the Battle of Tennōji (1615), and died at the Siege of Osaka castle (1615).
* Watanabe Motoharu, of the Yamada Watanabe branch, Jitō (Military Governor) of Yamada, Lord of Ichijoyama castle, was a direct retainer of the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki (1537-1597). At the Battle of Sekigahara, he fought against Tokugawa Ieyasu. After that his family was deprived of their fiefs.
* The Matsuura Watanabe of Izumi, were Shugodai (vice-Governors) of Izumi province and Lords of Kishiwada Castle. In 1527, they were involved in the administration of Izumi province as Shugodai, and in 1548 they sided with the Miyoshi clan . However when Magohachiro succeeded his father, he was still a child, and the Miyoshi while recognizing his position, sent their troops in Kishiwada Castle to protect the young lord. In 1562, Tora became Lord of Kishiwada with the aid of the Miyoshi army, but the Lordship changed again to his cousin Magohachiro, also called Hikaru, who later became Hizen no kami (Governor of Hizen Province). In 1585, Munekiyo with Nakamura Kazuuji and 8,000 men were besieged by 30,000 men (Battle of Kishiwada), and the castle was rebuilt as the base of Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s conquest of Kishu. For his military achievement, Munekiyo was given additional territories and transferred to Ise Province. Hisanobu, also called Hideto, was Lord of Ise Iyo castle, Iyo no Kami (Governor of Iyo province), and the General of the gun division of Toyotomi Hideyoshi; during the Sekigahara campaign, he was killed at the Battle of Anotsu (1600). At the Battle of Sekigahara (1600), they sided against the Tokugawa, and were deprived of their fiefs. 
* Watanabe Moritsuna (1542–1620), descended from the Matsuura Watanabe, through Watanabe Yasushi, grandson of Matsuura Hisashi, great-grandson of Watanabe no Tsuna. His ancestors were direct retainers of the Ashikaga Shoguns, and later moved to Mikawa province, thence they were called the Mikawa Watanabe branch. He joined Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1557, and fought at the Battles of Yawata (1562), Anegawa (1570), Mikatagahara (1573), Nagashino (1575), Komaki and Nagakute (1584), and the Siege of Osaka (1614-1615). He is listed as one of the sixteen Generals of Tokugawa Ieyasu. He was the Lord of Terabe castle, General of the Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543-1616), and is the ancestor of the Hakata Watanabe branch, Lords of Hakata, and the Hanzo Watanabe branch, Lords of Terabe, and Hida no Kami (Governors of Hida province).

===Edo period to the Meiji Restoration===
Besides the mainstream of Watanabe, the Matsuura branch, had the title of &quot;Daimyō&quot; (Grand feudal Lords) of Hirado Domain (Hizen Province) until 1868, were the most famous and flourished branch, and had a revenue of 61,700 koku. The territories of the Lords of Hirado included the Province of Iki (with the County of Iki (11 villages), and the County of Ishida (11 villages)); in the Province of Hizen : the County of Matsuura (47 villages), and 7 villages in the County of Sonogi.

The Matsuura Watanabe of Hirado Shinden, &quot;Daimyō&quot; of Hirado Shinden Domain (Hizen Province) until 1868, descending from the fourth Lord of Hirado, was given 10,000 koku, and established a branch domain.

The Hakata Watanabe branch, were &quot;Daimyō&quot; (Grand feudal Lords) of Hakata Domain (Izumi Province) until the Meiji Restoration (1868), had a revenue of 13,500 koku, and descend from Watanabe Yoshitsuna (1611-1668), who was appointed Sobayonin (Grand Chamberlain) by Tokugawa Ietsuna (1651–1680), the 4th Tokugawa Shogun, and was the grandson of Moritsuna. The territories of the Lords of Hakata included in the Province of Izumi : 12 villages in the County of Otori, 4 villages in the County of Izumi; in the Province of Kawachi : 5 villages in the County of Furuichi, 5 villages in the County of Shiki, and 2 villages in the County of Tanboku; in the Province of Omi : 1 village in the County of Kurita, 2 villages in the County of Yasu, 2 villages in the County of Gamo, and 6 villages in the County of Takashima.

The Hanzo Watanabe branch, descending from Watanabe Shigetsuna (1574-1648), son of Moritsuna, were lords of Terabe estate, Hida no Kami (Governors of Hida province), Karō (Chief retainers) of the Owari Tokugawa, and had a revenue of 10,000 koku. After 1868, they were raised to the Peerage. 

The Watanabe of Ōmura (Hizen Province) were ranked among the Peers after 1868.

The Watanabe of Suwa (Shinano Province) were also raised to the Peerage after 1868.

Several Watanabe samurai had the title of Taishin (Grand) Hatamoto (Guardians of the Banner), the last rank before Daimyo, direct retainers of the Shogunate, high ranking samurai, and senior retainers of the Tokugawa Shoguns and their principal branches, like the descendants of :

* Watanabe Terutsuna, Noto no Kami (Governor of Noto province), and Taishin Hatamoto with a revenue of 6,000 koku.
* Watanabe Zonosuke, a Taishin Hatamoto.
* Watanabe Shinzaemon, younger brother of Moritsuna, and ancestor of the Shinzaemon Watanabe branch, senior retainers of the Owari Tokugawa. His descendant, Watanabe Aritsuna (1820-1868), was the Commander of the Owari Tokugawa army; he fought at the first Choshu war (1864), the second Choshu war (1865), and was killed in 1868.
* Watanabe Tozutsuna, Karō (Chief retainer) of the Tayasu Tokugawa, and of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa.
* Watanabe Naotsuna, Wakasa no Kami (Governor of Wakasa province), had a revenue of 8,000 koku, and was the founder of the Wakasa Watanabe branch, Karō (Chief retainers) of the Kishū Tokugawa.

, means ‘to cross over a river’. Even by the standards of Japanese names, there is an unusual degree of variation in the second kanji used to write Watanabe, with at least 51 recorded variants including the common , and .

According to the &#x27;Japanese Family Names and Family Crests&#x27;, the surname Watanabe is a toponymic surname (and never an occupational surname). In Japan, there are very few occupational surnames, and unlike in several european countries, in Japan, occupational surnames are the exceptions. The surname Watanabe is not considered one of these very few occupational exceptions. A basic translation of the name of the original village 渡辺 is ‘to cross over a river’, and sometimes people mistakenly write that the Watanabe are &#x27;river crossers&#x27; which is incorrect.

The location called &#x27;Watanabe no tsu&#x27; was located between Tenmabashi Station and Tenjinbashi Station, in the present day Osaka City.

Watanabe no Tsuna took charge of Zama jinja Temple, also called Ikasuri Shrine. The hereditary &quot;guji&quot; (chief priest) of the temple were descending from Watanabe Kaoru, descendant of Watanabe no Tsuna. The original site of the shrine was different from the current one, and the main hall was in the place where Watanabe no tsu used to be. Toyotomi Hideyoshi relocated to its current location near Nishiyokoborikawa River, at the address 3 Watanabe, 4-chome Watanabe, Kyutaromachi, Chuo Ward, Osaka City.

It is the fifth most common Japanese surname.

In the context of the Japanese economy, is a generic name for housewives who deal in foreign exchange.

<text>The United States Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) is a branch of the family of United States Department of Defense (DoD) Working Capital Funds. The NWCF is a &quot;revolving fund&quot;, an account or fund that relies on sales revenue rather than direct Congressional appropriations to finance its operations. It is intended to generate adequate revenue to cover the full costs of its operations, and to finance the fund&#x27;s continuing operations without fiscal year limitation. A revolving fund is intended to operate on a break-even basis over time; that is, it neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss. 

United States Navy activities financed through the NWCF perform a wide variety of functions including Supply Management, Depot Maintenance, Research and Development, Transportation, and Base Support. The NWCF continues to pursue some important efforts to improve efficiency and maximize effectiveness. Success in these endeavors is critical to ensuring that the Department of the Navy can afford both the ongoing support costs of fleet operations and the necessary reinvestment in new platforms and weapons systems. 

==History of the NWCF==
Historically, the U.S. military has had two categories of revolving funds; stock funds and industrial funds.

Stock funds, in use by the Navy since the 1870s, were aimed at financing the procurement of material (spare parts and other items) in volume from commercial sources, to be held in inventory. This material was intended to be sold to customers, in order to achieve weapon systems readiness or to provide personnel support. Industrial funds, in use by the Navy since the 1940s, provided industrial and commercial goods and services such as depot maintenance, transportation, and research and development. The 1949 amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 authorized the United States Secretary of Defense to establish revolving funds as the business model for the operation of these funds.

In 1991, all of DoD&#x27;s stock and industrial funds were rolled into a single revolving fund, the Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF), along with five additional defense commercial operations or business areas previously funded with direct appropriations. DBOF was capitalized at a level significantly less than the sum of the stock and industrial funds it replaced. The consolidation of stock and industrial funds caused overall cash levels to be reduced, by allowing funds or capital to be shared across all of the activities, resulting in cash flow problems. The Defense Authorization Act addressed this issue, requiring that DoD conduct a comprehensive study of DBOF and present its findings along with a proposed improvement plan to Congress for approval. 

In December 1996, DBOF was reorganized into four working capital funds (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense-Wide). With the addition of a fifth fund—the Defense Commissary Agency in 1999—the new organization was now officially called the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). The five funds and their corresponding business areas provide goods and services to DoD and authorized non-DoD activities.

==DWCF and NWCF operations==
The support functions financed through the NWCF, as part of the DWCF, are grouped together at the DWCF level into business areas that are managed within DoD. Business areas receive their initial working capital through an appropriation or transfer of resources from an existing revolving fund. This working capital is called the &quot;corpus&quot; and is used to finance the initial costs of goods and services. Resources to replenish the corpus are generated by acceptance of customer orders. Customer orders are obligations on the appropriations of the ordering activity. The business area delivers the goods or services ordered using the funds in the corpus, and then bills the customer based on the rates set for those goods and services. The fund is replenished when the customer pays the bill to the fund.

Customer orders accepted by the NWCF activities must be either obligations of a federal government activity or cash advances from non-federal government customers. The acceptance of a customer order creates a quasi-contractual relationship between the NWCF activity and its customer. The customers of each NWCF activity are responsible for budgeting for and budgetary control of the cost of end products and services ordered from the NWCF activity. The customer cannot use its appropriated funds to do indirectly (through the NWCF activity) what it is not permitted to do directly. The availability of an appropriation cannot be expanded or otherwise changed by transfer to the NWCF. The customer bears the primary responsibility for the determination of the applicability of its appropriated funds in the orders placed with the NWCF activity. 

===Stabilized billing rates===
One of the features of the NWCF that allows its customers to accurately plan and budget their appropriated funds for NWCF support requirements is the rate stabilization policy adopted by the NWCF. For each budget year, the NWCF establishes customer rates on an end product basis whenever feasible. These rates are set at levels estimated to recover the cost of products or services to be provided. This stabilized rate policy protects appropriated fund customers from unforeseen cost changes, and also minimizes fluctuations in planned NWCF work levels, permitting a more effective use of NWCF resources.

In conjunction with the stabilized rate policy, the NWCF uses a cost recovery, or breakeven policy. With stabilized rates, gains or losses in operations may occur as a result of variations in program execution. To maintain full cost recovery and thereby to break even over the long term, NWCF activities generally adjust their rates each year to reflect such realized gains and losses.

==NWCF requirements==
To be included in the NWCF financial structure, a proposed business area must meet four criteria: 
# Outputs (i.e., goods produced and services provided) can be identified; 
#An approved accounting system is available; 
#Organizations (i.e., customers) that require and order products or services have been identified; 
#Advantages and disadvantages of establishing a buyer/seller relationship have been evaluated.

==Revolving funds==
The funding of the NWCF is based on a revolving-fund concept of operations, under which the NWCF activities received their initial working capital through an appropriation or through a transfer of resources from existing appropriations of funds and used those resources to finance the initial cost of products and services. Financial resources to replenish the initial working capital and to permit continuing operations are generated by the acceptance of customer orders.

Revolving funds operate in a fashion similar to a personal checking account. An individual deposits income into their account. In order to maintain themselves as a &quot;continuing operation,&quot; necessary goods and services must be purchased, reducing the fund total. In order to keep the fund balanced, expenditures must not exceed income. By keeping a positive account balance, and by looking for ways to stretch capital further, revolving fund activities are exercising sound financial management.

A revolving fund gets its name from the cyclic nature of the cash flow. Income from customer purchases is used to finance a service providers&#x27; continuing operations, i.e., the business areas in a working capital fund sell goods or services with the intent of recovering the total cost incurred in providing those goods and services. Income from sales is then used to buy or replace inventory and finance the production of future goods and services. 

==NWCF funding process summary==
# Congress provides a one-time cash corpus to begin operation and in advance of customer orders.
# Customers receive appropriations from Congress. 
# The customer sends a work order or project order to the working capital fund business area provider. 
# The business area furnishes the service or product, pays for expenses incurred, and bills the customer. 
# The customer pays the bill. 
# The business area incurs either a loss or a profit during the fiscal year, resulting in either an increase in the rate charged to the customer or a rebate (lowered rate) charged to the customer.

<doc id="1202284" wikidata="Q423025" url="?curid=1202284" title="Phenakite">
<text>Phenakite or phenacite is a fairly rare nesosilicate mineral consisting of beryllium orthosilicate, Be2SiO4. Occasionally used as a gemstone, phenakite occurs as isolated crystals, which are rhombohedral with parallel-faced hemihedrism, and are either lenticular or prismatic in habit: the lenticular habit is determined by the development of faces of several obtuse rhombohedra and the absence of prism faces. There is no cleavage, and the fracture is conchoidal. The Mohs hardness is high, being 7.5–8; the specific gravity is 2.96. The crystals are sometimes perfectly colorless and transparent, but more often they are greyish or yellowish and only translucent; occasionally they are pale rose-red. In general appearance the mineral is not unlike quartz, for which indeed it has been mistaken. Its name comes from , meaning &quot;deceiver&quot; due to its close visual similarity to quartz, named by Nils Gustaf Nordenskiöld in 1833.

== Largest phenakite ==

A large phenakite gemstone has been found in Sri Lanka. Found on November 18, 2021, this gemstone weighs 616.9 carats which makes it the largest of its kind. It is owned by a gem dealer from Beruwala, Sri Lanka, and reported to be worth around (US $ million).

==Occurrence==
Phenakite is found in high-temperature pegmatite veins and in mica-schists associated with quartz, chrysoberyl, apatite and topaz. It has long been known from the emerald and chrysoberyl mine on the Takovaya stream, near Yekaterinburg in the Urals of Russia, where large crystals occur in mica-schist. It is also found with topaz and amazonite in the granite of the Ilmen Mountains in the southern Urals and of the Pikes Peak region in Colorado, US. Additionally in Colorado, phenakite is found in the Mount Antero area with aquamarine, bertrandite, and fluorite. Small, gem grade individual crystals of phenakite showing a prismatic habit are noted in beryl dissolution cavities at the Noumas II Pegmatite, part of the Orange River pegmatite belt in the Northern Cape of South Africa. Large crystals of prismatic habit have been found in a feldspar quarry at Kragerø in Norway. Framont near Schirmeck in Alsace is another well-known locality. Still larger crystals, measuring in diameter and weighing . have been found at Greenwood in Maine, but these are pseudomorphs of quartz after phenakite.

For gem purposes the stone is cut in the brilliant form, of which there are two fine examples, weighing 34 and 43 carats (6.8 and 8.6 g), in the British Museum. The indices of refraction are higher than those of quartz, beryl or topaz; a faceted phenakite is consequently rather brilliant and may sometimes be mistaken for diamond.

<text>In the reign of Ordoño I of Asturias (850–866), the kingdom began to be known as that of León. In 910, an independent Kingdom of León was founded when the king of Asturias divided his territory amongst his three sons.

Below follows a list of Leonese monarchs. It is, in part, a continuation of the list of Asturian monarchs.

==Kings of León==

===Astur-Leonese dynasty===
===Jiménez Dynasty===
===House of Ivrea / Burgundy===
The follow dynasts are descendants, in the male line, of Urraca&#x27;s husband, Raymond of Burgundy.
===House of Trastámara===

Henry II, the founder of the Trastámara dynasty was installed after victory in the Castilian Civil War. Under the Trastámaras, as with the late kings of the House of Ivrea/Burgundy, Castile and León were governed together, constituting the core of the Crown of Castile.

===House of Habsburg===
Under the Hapsburgs, León continued to be governed as part of the Crown of Castile, as under the Trastámaras. 

===House of Bourbon===


==Family tree==

<doc id="1202287" wikidata="Q7312849" url="?curid=1202287" title="Rendition aircraft">
<text>This page describes several aircraft that are alleged in media reports to have been used in the practice of extraordinary rendition, the extralegal transfer of prisoners from one country to another.

==N313P==

N313P was a tailnumber assigned to a Boeing 737 that the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported on Tuesday, February 6, 2007, flew from Tashkent to Kabul, Afghanistan, on September 21, 2003, and then to Szczytno-Szymany International Airport in Poland, landing at 9 p.m. &quot;It stayed on the ground for 57 minutes before taking off for Baneasa Airport in Bucharest, Romania, an airport that, according to the Marty Report, &#x27;bears all the characteristics of a detainee transfer or drop-off point,&#x27;&quot; states author Tom Hundley on page 14 of the &quot;Tribune&quot;. The 737 then continued on to Rabat, Morocco, and Guantanamo Bay, the Marty Report said. In 2004 the plane was used to render LIFG leader Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Bouchar to Libya.

&quot;The registered owners of both planes [Boeing 737, N313P, and Gulfstream V, N379P] appear to be CIA front companies. Previous attempts by the &quot;Tribune&quot; to contact the owners produced a trail of non-existent people at unlikely addresses, or law firms that did not want to discuss the nature of their interest in aviation. Both planes have been involved in rendition cases documented by the &quot;Tribune&quot;, other media and EU investigators,&quot; states the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; on page 14.

==N379P==
N379P was a tailnumber assigned to a Gulfstream V executive jet. The aircraft has been reported in several press sources as a U.S. Department of Defense prisoner transport, also known as &quot;Guantánamo Bay Express&quot;. The craft has been reported to being used to transport suspected terrorists to undisclosed locations for either extraordinary rendition or into the CIA prison system. It has been the subject of criminal complaints and parliamentary inquiries.

According to an in-depth investigation into the worldwide network of detention and interrogation facilities employed in the War on Terror, by the British Guardian newspaper, (March 2005):

===Background===
The first media mention of N379P was six weeks after September 11, 2001, when, according to the &quot;Chicago Tribune,&quot; a Pakistani newspaper reported that a student at the University of Karachi and a citizen of Yemen, had been seen being forced onto the plane at Jinnah International Airport by Pakistani security officers on the morning of October 23, 2001. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported on the aircraft again on February 6, 2007, stating that N379P departed Washington Dulles International Airport July 27, 2003, and flew to Frankfurt, Germany according to FAA records. The FAA then records the Gulfstream taking off from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on July 31, 2003, bound for Glasgow, Scotland, and then return to Dulles. The &quot;Tribune&quot; then states that Polish aviation records indicate that N379P landed at Szczytno-Szymany International Airport, a remote airfield at Szymany, Poland, at 2:58 a.m. on July 30, 2003, after a flight from Afghanistan. How the aircraft moved from Frankfurt to Tashkent remains unreported. The Szymany airport is located southwest of the Stare Kiejkuty intelligence base in northern Poland.

The executive jet with the tail number N379P was again brought to public attention by Swedish TV4&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Det brutna löftet&quot; (&quot;The broken promise&quot;), aired May 17, 2004. The documentary claimed that the expulsion of two men, Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery—ordered by the Cabinet—to Egypt on December 18, 2001, was carried out by hooded U.S. agents. The plane booked by the Swedish Security Police (SÄPO) was cancelled when another plane arrived—N379P—a Gulfstream V executive jet supplied by the firm (Premier Executive Transport Services, Inc.) which works exclusively for the U.S. Defense Department.

Agiza and al-Zery were arrested and brought to Bromma airport in Stockholm where Swedish police handed them over to hooded operatives. The two prisoners had their clothes cut from their bodies by scissors, without their hand- and footcuffs being loosened. The naked and chained prisoners were given suppository of unknown kind inserted into their anus, and diapers were put on them. They were forcibly dressed in dark overalls. Their hands and feet are chained to a specially designed harness. On the plane, both men are blindfolded and hooded. The plane took off at 21.49 and set course towards Egypt.

Later on, when the Gulfstream&#x27;s log books came into a journalist&#x27;s hands, the wider scope became clear:

=== Appearance in fiction ===
N379P appears in the episode &quot;Hundrede dage&quot; of the Danish TV series &quot;Borgen&quot; which focuses on the problems for the Danish prime-minister caused by the revelation of rendition flights landing at Thule. In addition, a Gulfstream V that is being used to carry out an extraordinary rendition appears in Jason Trask&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;I&#x27;m Not Muhammad&quot; (Red Wheelbarrow Books).

==N596GA ==
N596GA was the tailnumber of a Gulfstream V, which has also been mentioned in print as a possible transport for the CIA program of extraordinary rendition. According to a 2008 article by writer Dave Willis, the plane was ordered in 1999 by the United States Air Force as a C-37A, serial &quot;99-0405&quot;, and was rolled out as N596GA but only briefly took up its military serial before reverting to the civil registration, issued on September 20, 2001, nine days after the 9-11 attacks. It was registered to National Aircraft Leasing of Greenville, New Castle County in Delaware, &quot;and is believed to have been used by the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation Systems (JPATS), managed by the U.S. Marshals Service. JPATS is responsible for moving prisoners and non-US citizen criminals around and has its own fleet of aircraft, as well as frequently leasing others. N596GA is also said to have been used in the CIA&#x27;s programme of extraordinary rendition against terrorist subjects.&quot;

==N85VM==
N85VM was the tail number of a Gulfstream IV which newspaper reports have speculated may have been used as a US Department of Defense or CIA prisoner transport. Plane logs obtained by reporters show that the plane was in Cairo on February 18, 2003, the same day that the radical Egyptian cleric Abu Omar arrived in Cairo after being abducted in Italy, leading reporters to speculate that the Gulfstream IV may have been the plane used to render Abu Omar. American and Italian intelligence officers were later charged with Abu Omar&#x27;s abduction.

In addition to the trip to Cairo, between June 2002 and January 2005, the aircraft made 51 trips to Guantánamo Bay, as well as 82 visits to Dulles International Airport and Andrews Air Force Base. It also visited U.S. air bases at Ramstein and Rhein-Main in Germany, Afghanistan, Morocco, Dubai, Jordan, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, Azerbaijan and the Czech Republic.

<text>Joseph Siffert (; 7 July 1936 – 24 October 1971) was a Swiss racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Siffert won two Formula One Grands Prix across 10 seasons.

Affectionately known as &quot;Seppi&quot; to his family and friends, Siffert was born in Fribourg, Switzerland, the son of a dairy owner. He initially made his name in racing on two wheels, winning the Swiss 350 cc motorcycle championship in 1959, before switching to four wheels with a Formula Junior Stanguellini. Siffert graduated to Formula One as a privateer in 1962, with a four-cylinder Lotus-Climax. He later moved to Swiss team Scuderia Filipinetti, and in 1964 joined Rob Walker&#x27;s private British Rob Walker Racing Team. Early successes included victories in the 1964 and 1965 Mediterranean Grands Prix non-Championship Formula One races, both times beating Jim Clark by a very narrow margin. He won two World Championship races, one for the Rob Walker Racing Team and one for BRM. He died at the 1971 World Championship Victory Race, a non-Championship Formula One race, having his car roll over after a crash caused by a mechanical failure and being caught under the burning vehicle. Siffert was married twice and to his second wife Simone during the height of his career in the late 1960s and at the time of his death. They had two children together, Véronique and Philippe.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life ===
Siffert was born in 1936 in the town of Fribourg, Switzerland, 35 km (22 mi) from Bern to a poor family. Aged 12, Siffert and his father went to Bern to see the 1948 Swiss Grand Prix at the Bremgarten circuit, and it was at this event where Siffert wanted to be a racing driver.

=== Formula One ===

In 1968, Siffert drove into the F1 history books by winning the 1968 British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch in Rob Walker Racing Team&#x27;s Lotus 49B, beating Chris Amon&#x27;s Ferrari into second place after a race-long battle. This is regarded as the last GP victory by a genuine privateer. In 1971 as a BRM team driver he scored his second Formula One Championship race victory at the Austrian Grand Prix held at the Österreichring.

=== Sports cars ===
While Siffert&#x27;s status in F1 grew slowly, his fame came as a leading driver for the factory Porsche effort in its quest for the World Sportscar Championship. In 1968, Siffert and Hans Herrmann won the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring in a Porsche 907, marking the first major outright wins for the company, apart from a few earlier victories on twisty tracks.

Later on, Siffert&#x27;s driving displays in the Porsche 917 earned him several major wins in Europe. In addition, Siffert was chosen by Porsche to help launch its CanAm development programme, driving a Porsche 917PA spyder in 1969 and finishing fourth in the championship despite few entries.

In 1970 he teamed up with Brian Redman to drive a Porsche 908/3 to victory at the Targa Florio. That same year, Porsche bankrolled Siffert&#x27;s seat in a works March Engineering F1 since the German company did not wish to lose one of their prize drivers to rival Ferrari. His association with March in F1 was disastrous, so he was pleased to join rival Porsche racer Pedro Rodriguez at BRM the following season.

=== Death ===
Siffert was killed in the non-championship World Championship Victory Race at Brands Hatch, Kent, England, the scene of his first victory in 1968. The suspension of his BRM had been damaged in a lap one incident with Ronnie Peterson, and broke later. This was not admitted by BRM until much later when it was accidentally divulged by a BRM ex-mechanic. The BRM crashed and immediately caught fire. Siffert could not free himself from the burning car.

In the subsequent Royal Automobile Club (the UK organising and regulatory representative of the FIA at the time) investigation, it was discovered that Siffert had only suffered a leg fracture in the initial crash but because three fire extinguishers failed to work properly no rescuers could reach Siffert for five minutes and he died of smoke inhalation. A fire marshall stated that if the fire extinguishers worked correctly then they could have reached Siffert within 20 seconds.

This accident led to a rapid overhaul of safety, both in-car and on circuit. On-board fire extinguishers (using BCF—bromochlorodifluoromethane, an aircraft product) became mandatory and also piped air for the drivers, direct into their helmets.

His funeral in Switzerland was attended by 50,000 people and a Gulf-Porsche 917 of Team John Wyer led the hearse and procession through the streets of Fribourg.

=== Legacy ===
In the final round of the 2007–08 A1GP season, at Brands Hatch, the A1 Team Switzerland car carried the message &quot;Jo &#x27;Seppi&#x27; Siffert - 40th Anniversary - Brands Hatch&quot;. This commemorated his 1968 British Grand Prix victory at Brands Hatch.

<doc id="1202295" wikidata="Q2375620" url="?curid=1202295" title="Synanon">
<text>Synanon, originally known as Tender Loving Care, was a new religious movement founded in 1958 by Charles E. &quot;Chuck&quot; Dederich Sr. in Santa Monica, California, United States. Originally established as a drug rehabilitation program, Synanon developed into an alternative community centered on group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the &quot;Synanon Game&quot;, a form of attack therapy.

Described as one of the &quot;most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen&quot;, Synanon disbanded in 1991 after several members were convicted of offenses including financial misdeeds, evidence tampering, terrorism, and attempted murder.

== Beginnings ==
Synanon was founded in 1958 by Charles Dederich Sr., a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) from Santa Monica, California. At the time of Synanon&#x27;s founding, those suffering from drug addiction were not always welcomed into AA because their issues were considered significantly different from those of alcoholics. Dederich, after taking LSD, decided to create his own program to respond to their needs. He was said to have coined the phrase &quot;today is the first day of the rest of your life.&quot; After his small group, called &quot;Tender Loving Care&quot;, gained a significant following, Dederich incorporated the organization into the Synanon Foundation in 1958.

The origins of the name &quot;Synanon&quot; are not entirely clear, with some claiming it to be the result of a group member slurring the words &quot;symposium&quot; and &quot;seminar&quot; and others simply describing it as a portmanteau of &quot;symposium&quot; and &quot;anonymous&quot;. The word syndicate also means &quot;an association of people or firms formed to promote a common interest or carry out a business enterprise&quot;.

Synanon began as a two-year residential program, but Dederich soon concluded that its members could never graduate, because a full recovery was impossible. The program was based on testimony of fellow group members about their tribulations and urges of relapsing, and their journeys to recovery.

The Synanon organization also developed a business that sold promotional items. This became a successful enterprise that for a time generated roughly $10 million per year.
In 1959, Synanon moved from their small storefront to an abandoned armory on the beach. In 1967, Synanon purchased the &quot;Club Casa del Mar&quot;, a large beachside hotel in Santa Monica, as its headquarters and a dormitory for those undergoing treatment for drug addiction. Later on, Synanon acquired a large building that had been the home of the Athens Athletic Club, in Oakland, California, and then transformed it into a residential facility for Synanon&#x27;s members.

Professionals, even those without drug addictions, were invited to join Synanon. The New York psychiatrist Daniel Casriel M.D. visited in 1962, lived there in 1963, and wrote a book about his experiences. He later founded AREBA, the oldest surviving private addiction treatment center in the United States, as well as Daytop Village, one of the world&#x27;s largest therapeutic communities.

Control over members occurred through the &quot;Game&quot;. The &quot;Game&quot; was presented as a therapeutic tool, and likened to a form of group therapy; but it has been criticized as a form of a &quot;social control&quot;, in which members humiliated one another and encouraged the exposure of one another&#x27;s innermost weaknesses.
Beginning in the mid-1970s, women in Synanon were required to shave their heads, and married couples were made to break up and take new partners. Men were given forced vasectomies, and a few pregnant women were forced to have abortions.

Leonard Nimoy taught drama classes to members of Synanon partly as a result of the role he played in the production of &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, a 1965 English-language film version of Jean Genet&#x27;s play &quot;Haute Surveillance&quot; (the story deals with three prison inmates). Nimoy is quoted as saying &quot;Give a little here and it always comes back&quot;.

The film director George Lucas needed a large group of people with shaved heads for the filming of his movie &quot;THX 1138&quot; and hired some of his extras from Synanon. Robert Altman hired members of Synanon to be extras for the gambling scenes in his movie &quot;California Split&quot;.

== Practices ==

Entrance into the Synanon community required a strong initial commitment. Newcomers were first interviewed by Synanon leadership to gain entrance into the community. Upon their arrival, those newcomers were forced to quit using drugs cold turkey, going through withdrawal for the first few days in the program. Furthermore, for their first ninety days in the community, members were expected to cease contact with outside friends and family.

During its first decade, Synanon members entered into a 1–2-year program in three stages aimed at preparing members to reenter greater society. During the first stage, members did community and housekeeping labor. During the second stage, members worked outside of the community but still resided within the community. Finally, during the third stage, members both worked and lived outside of the community, but still attended regular meetings. After Synanon&#x27;s transition into an alternate society in 1968, this program changed to a &quot;lifetime rehabilitation&quot; program, with the premise that drug addicts would never truly be well enough to return to society.

One of the most distinguishing practices of the Synanon community was a therapeutic practice commonly referred to as &quot;The Game&quot;. The Game was a session during which one member would talk about themselves and then endure intense criticism by their peers. During this practice, members were encouraged to be critical of everything, using harsh and profane language. The practice has been charactized as a form of attack therapy. Outside of The Game, members were required to act civilly to each other. While in The Game, members criticized each other, but left as friends and supportive community members. The Game served not only as Synanon&#x27;s most prominent form of therapy and personal change, but also worked as a way for leaders to collect the opinions of community members. Because there was no hierarchy in The Game, members could freely criticize Synanon&#x27;s highest leadership, who would then take member concerns into consideration when deciding policy.

The Game turned into a 72-hour version and was admitted by Dederich to be brainwashing. The Game was eventually used to pressure people to submit to Dederich&#x27;s will, abort pregnancies, undergo vasectomies, and commit violence.

Over time, Dederich&#x27;s vision of Synanon evolved, and he began to envision the group&#x27;s potential to promote social progress. Synanon moved to create schooling for members, and Dederich wanted members to mentally change in order to improve society on the outside. The school was headed by Al Bauman, who believed in an innovative philosophy and aimed to teach children in the same manner to think differently. The school attracted lawyers, screenwriters, and business executives, all wanting to educate their children in a progressive environment.

==Lifetime rehabilitation concept==
Beginning in 1964, the legal authorities began to investigate Synanon&#x27;s practices. The concept of &quot;lifetime rehabilitation&quot; did not agree with therapeutic norms, and it was alleged in 1961 by the City of Santa Monica that Synanon was &quot;operating a hospital in a residential zone&quot;. Synanon expanded an old Trans-Pacific Marconi RCA radio station in Tomales Bay now Marconi Conference Center State Historic Park in Marshall, California. It was alleged that on remote properties in California such as at Marshall in Marin County and in Badger, Tulare County, Synanon had erected buildings without the legally-required permits, had created a trash dump, and built an airstrip. Taxation issues also arose. In response to these accusations, Dederich declared that Synanon was a tax exempt religious organization, the &quot;Church of Synanon&quot;.

Legal problems continued, despite this change. Children who had been assigned to Synanon began running away, and an &quot;underground railroad&quot; had been created in the area that sought to help them return to their parents. Beatings of Synanon&#x27;s opponents and its ex-members, &quot;splittees&quot;, occurred across California. Beatings occurred in Synanon basements. A state Grand Jury in Marin County issued a scathing report in 1978 that attacked Synanon for the very strong evidence of its child abuse, and also for the monetary profits that flowed to Dederich. The Grand Jury report also rebuked the governmental authorities involved for their lack of oversight, although it stopped short of directly interceding in the Synanon situation.

== Criminal activity and collapse ==
While Synanon initially did not tolerate violence, Dederich came to allow for violence as he sought greater control over the group. Much of the violence by Synanon was carried out by an internal group called the &quot;Imperial Marines&quot; Over 80 violent acts were committed, including mass beatings that hospitalized teenagers, and ranchers who were beaten in front of their families. People who left Synanon risked physical violence for being a &quot;splittee&quot;; one ex-member, Phil Ritter, was beaten so severely that his skull was fractured and he subsequently fell into a coma with a near-fatal case of bacterial meningitis.

In mid-1978, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; produced a segment on the controversies surrounding Synanon. Following the broadcast, several NBC executives, including the network&#x27;s chairman, allegedly received hundreds of threats from Synanon supporters. On October 10, 1978, two Synanon members placed a de-rattled rattlesnake in the mailbox of Paul Morantz, an attorney who had successfully brought a suit against the group on behalf of Synanon detainees. The snake bit Morantz, and he was hospitalized for six days. This incident, along with the press coverage, prompted a law enforcement investigation into Synanon.

Six weeks after the snake attack, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) performed a search of the ranch in Badger that found a recorded speech by Dederich in which he said, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to mess with the old-time, turn-the-other-cheek religious postures... Our religious posture is: Don&#x27;t mess with us. You can get killed dead, literally dead... These are real threats&quot;, he stated. &quot;They are draining life&#x27;s blood from us, and expecting us to play by their silly rules. We will make the rules. I see nothing frightening about it... I am quite willing to break some lawyer&#x27;s legs, and next break his wife&#x27;s legs, and threaten to cut their child&#x27;s arm off. That is the end of that lawyer. That is a very satisfactory, humane way of transmitting information. I really do want an ear in a glass of alcohol on my desk.&quot;

Though many San Francisco area newspapers and broadcasters covered the Synanon case, they were largely silenced by legal action from Synanon&#x27;s lawyers, who made claims of libel. These lawsuits ultimately turned out to be a large part of Synanon&#x27;s undoing, by giving journalists access to Synanon&#x27;s own internal documents. The main thorn in the cult&#x27;s side was the &quot;Point Reyes Light&quot;, a weekly newspaper published by David V. Mitchell. The newspaper was domiciled in a tiny town ten miles south of Marshall, where Synanon&#x27;s main facility was located. The paper prevailed on press freedom and protection issues and its reporting was consummately professional. It won a $100,000 judgement against the cult and in 1979, for its efforts, became the smallest paper ever to win a Pulitzer Prize.

As a result of the snake attack, Dederich and two Synanon residents, Joe Musico and Lance Kenton (son of the musician Stan Kenton) were arrested and pleaded &quot;no contest&quot; to charges of assault and conspiracy to commit murder. Lance Kenton was sentenced to a year in prison. While his associates went to jail, Dederich received probation because his doctors claimed that due to ill health he would most likely die in prison. As a condition of probation, he was disallowed from taking part in managing Synanon. Dederich died on February 28, 1997 at age 83, after a series of strokes; the cause of death was cardiorespiratory failure.

Synanon struggled to survive without its leader, and also with a severely tarnished reputation. The Internal Revenue Service revoked the organization&#x27;s tax-exempt status and ordered them to pay $17 million in back taxes. This bankrupted Synanon, which formally dissolved in 1991.

==Subsequent treatment approaches==
Mel Wasserman, influenced by his Synanon experience, founded CEDU Educational Services, a company in the troubled teen industry that owned and operated several schools. CEDU&#x27;s schools used the confrontational model of Synanon. The CEDU model was widely influential on the development of parent-choice, private-pay residential programs. People originally inspired by their CEDU experience developed or strongly influenced a significant number of the schools in the therapeutic boarding school industry. The company&#x27;s schools have faced numerous allegations of abuse. CEDU went out of business in 2005, amid lawsuits and state regulatory crackdowns.

Father William B. O&#x27;Brien, the founder of New York&#x27;s Daytop Village, included Synanon&#x27;s group encounters and confrontational approach in his research into addiction treatment methods.

The author, journalist, and activist Maia Szalavitz claims to chart the influence of Synanon in other programs including Phoenix House, Straight, Incorporated, and Boot Camps in addition to those mentioned above.

Its members were elected in the 1863 congressional elections.

<doc id="1202306" wikidata="Q2303434" url="?curid=1202306" title="6 Feet Deep">
<text>6 Feet Deep (also titled Niggamortis in some regions) is the debut album of the American hip hop supergroup Gravediggaz. Formed by former Tommy Boy Records artists Prince Paul, RZA, Frukwan and Poetic, the group utilized horror-themed imagery and lyrics combined with black comedy and satire to vent their frustrations with the hip hop record industry. The album&#x27;s concept satirizes the hardcore hip hop and gangsta rap of the early 1990s. Released on August 9, 1994, by Gee Street Records, the album helped usher in horrorcore.

==Production==
The conception of the Gravediggaz group came at a low point in the careers of each of the group&#x27;s members, each of which had at one point or another been signed to Tommy Boy Records and had not had good experiences with the label. Prince Paul had also contributed drums to the RZA&#x27;s early single &quot;Ooh We Love You Rakeem&quot;. According to Paul, the RZA was trying to get signed to Doo Dew Man Records, Paul&#x27;s vanity label distributed by Def Jam Records, but Paul had failed to launch the label, and Def Jam put Resident Alien&#x27;s It Takes a Nation of Suckers to Hold Us In, the label&#x27;s lone album, on hold. Additionally, Paul and rapper Frukwan had both recently left Stetsasonic, and while Paul had received much praise for his instrumentals for De La Soul&#x27;s acclaimed debut album, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;, the group&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;De La Soul is Dead&quot; was not well received, and De La Soul were beginning to handle more of their own production, alienating Paul from the group and leaving him in a &quot;dark [and] depressed&quot; mood, which was reflected in the instrumentals he was creating at this time. Paul called rappers RZA, Frukwan, and Poetic separately, inviting them to listen to these new instrumentals in his home, and RZA suggested that they form a group together and proposed they name it Gravediggaz, which met with the approval of the four, who each took on &quot;grave-themed&quot; aliases - the Undertaker (Prince Paul), the Grym Reaper (Poetic), the Gatekeeper (Frukwan) and the RZArector - and recorded the demo &quot;The House That Hatred Built&quot;. The formation of the Gravediggaz made the group one of hip hop&#x27;s first supergroups. 

The demo was shopped to Def Jam and Jive Records, who both passed on the group. Subsequently, Poetic began working at a bagel factory, Frukwan got a job making clothes, and the RZA co-founded the Wu-Tang Clan, which Paul later observed had been influenced by the Gravediggaz&#x27; conceptualization as a concept-oriented rap supergroup. Eazy-E offered the Gravediggaz a contract with Ruthless Records, but Paul turned it down due to Jerry Heller&#x27;s contract, which Paul described as &quot;one of the worst [contracts] I’ve ever seen in my life.&quot; Several years after the demo was recorded, Gee Street Records offered a better contract, and subsequently signed the group. &quot;Constant Elevation&quot; was the first song recorded by the group after signing with Gee Street. Poetic rewrote his intro verse after some bad takes, establishing the energy that would carry over to the rest of the album&#x27;s vocal sessions. RZA intended to record &quot;Nowhere to Run, Nowhere to Hide&quot; as a solo track, but Prince Paul recorded additional verses from Frukwan and Poetic.

==Composition==
Gravediggaz was one of the first rap groups in the subgenre horrorcore, which &quot;The Quietus&quot; writer David Bennun described as &quot;a then novel means of addressing black life at street level [and] finding a new way of getting that message across&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine said that the Gravediggaz &quot;use death, burial and The Grim Reaper as central themes for a chilling mid-tempo stomp through America&#x27;s urban problems.&quot; Bennun connects Gravediggaz&#x27; lyrics not only to the hardcore rap lyrics of the Geto Boys and Cypress Hill, but also to EC Comics&#x27; &quot;Tales From The Crypt&quot;. According to John-Michael Bond in his review for &quot;Rap Reviews&quot;, the album&#x27;s unifying theme is hate, which Gravediggaz use as &quot;a metaphor for murdering the mindless drivel that infected early &#x27;90s rap&quot;. Hip hop at this time had shifted towards violent gangsta rap, due to the popularity of N.W.A and Ruthless Records, and the lyrical content of early-90s rap acts was seen as &quot;vying to outdo the last for cold-blooded gruesomeness, justified on the grounds that it was simply portraying life as it is on the street&quot;, according to Bennun. In contrast to the serious-toned violent threats of hardcore rap, the Gravediggaz&#x27; lyrics combine horror themes with black comedy and satire, exemplified by the album&#x27;s original title, &quot;Niggamortis&quot;. According to Bond, &quot;Gravediggaz were born out of a disdain and hatred for the bullshit that surrounded four men whose talents were under represented at the time and set out to make the most uncompromising music possible.&quot; Bond compares &quot;6 Feet Deep&quot; to social horror films like &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; and &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;. Gravediggaz also drew inspiration from the lyrical themes and imagery of heavy metal music. &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; uses imagery from the crucifixion of Jesus in RZA&#x27;s verse. Despite the group intending the lyrics of &quot;1-800 Suicide&quot;, which appear to encourage suicide, as dark humor, high scrutiny of rap lyrics at this time meant that the Gravediggaz had to record an alternate lyric version as an anti-suicide PSA.

Most of the album&#x27;s instrumentals were created by Prince Paul. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Paul&#x27;s production &quot;[evokes] the atmosphere of horror movies and ominous effects&quot;. The piano loop of &quot;Constant Elevation&quot; was sampled from Allen Toussaint&#x27;s &quot;Louie&quot;. &quot;Nowhere to Run, Nowhere to Hide&quot; samples Eugene McDaniels &quot;Jagger’s Dagger&quot;. &quot;Defective Trip (Trippin&#x27;)&quot; utilizes psychedelic rock electric guitar playing. It samples John Ussery&#x27;s &quot;Listen to the Melody&quot; and Alvin Cash&#x27;s &quot;Twine Time&quot;. &quot;2 Cups of Blood&quot; samples it&#x27;s keyboard loop from Larry Willis&#x27; &quot;Inner Crisis.&quot; &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; does not utilize any samples. Paul&#x27;s instrumental for &quot;Bang Your Head&quot; was originally created for the Cold Crush Four, but after the group rejected the instrumental, RZA proposed using it for the Gravediggaz. &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, one of the album&#x27;s only tracks to feature an instrumental by the RZA, utilized a shelved instrumental demo intended for a Wu-Tang Clan song, sampling Johnny Mathis. &quot;1-800 Suicide&quot; samples Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s &quot;Sunny&quot;. &quot;Death Trap&quot; samples the Whole Darn Family&#x27;s &quot;7 Minutes of Funk&quot;; The song&#x27;s lyrics refer to drug overdoses, murder and Lorena Bobbitt.

==Release and reception==

The album was released on August 9, 1994. It was released under the title &quot;Niggamortis&quot; outside of the United States. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;the flustered beats, washed in minor chords, are strangely irresistible&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; praised the album for &quot;feverishly [documenting] the low life&quot;. The magazine later ranked the album at No. 22 on its list of the &quot;Top 50 Albums of 1994&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; concluded that, &quot;Even with their rotten language and funereal imagery, the Gravediggaz&#x27;s grim rapping is not the lurid, flesh-chopping of, say, Insane Poetry.&quot;

In 2009, &quot;Fangoria&quot; named it as an iconic horrorcore album.

<doc id="1202309" wikidata="Q2903317" url="?curid=1202309" title="Bill Phipps">
<text>William Frederick Allen Phipps (May 4, 1942 – March 4, 2022) was a Canadian ordained minister of the United Church of Canada, lawyer and social activist. He served as the 36th Moderator of the United Church of Canada from 1997 to 2000, and engendered controversy for expressing support for gay ordination and not believing in a physical Resurrection of Jesus.

==Early life and ministry==
Phipps was born in Toronto, the son of Cora Stinson and Reginald Phipps. He graduated from Osgoode Law School in 1965, but felt a call to ministry rather than the law, and enrolled at McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago. During his studies, he worked with community activist Saul Alinsky, and marched with Martin Luther King. After graduation in 1968, Phipps moved to Toronto to article for his law degree and opened the first Poverty law office in Canada. He was ordained by the United Church of Canada in 1969, and became the minister first of Thorncliffe United Church, and then Trinity-St. Paul&#x27;s United Church. During his time in Toronto, he advocated for LGBTQ rights, the poor, and homelessness.

In 1986, he moved to Edmonton, Alberta to work in church administration for seven years. In 1993, he moved to Calgary to become the minister of Scarboro United Church.

==Moderator of the United Church of Canada==
===Controversy===
Phipps was elected to the post of Moderator at the 36th General Council of the United Church in August 1997. Shortly after being installed, Phipps was interviewed by many journalists and newspapers, including the editorial board of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;. The subsequent editorial published by the &quot;Citizen&quot;, which criticized his views on the ordination of gays, economic justice for the poor, and especially his theological views, ignited nation-wide controversy, During the interview, Phipps had questioned the Resurrection of Jesus as a scientific fact, added he was undecided on the question of the afterlife, and &quot;I don&#x27;t believe Jesus was God.&quot; Although several contemporary theologians and scholars were surprised by the fierce backlash, saying that Phipps&#x27; theological views were not considered radical, the controversy resulted in discussions and debates in United Church congregations across the country. As the &quot;Globe &amp; Mail&quot; noted in his obituary, &quot;Some called him saint; others, a heretic.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Phipps further explained his views on the Resurrection of Jesus, saying, &quot;There’s no question that Jesus’ followers [...] believed with all their being that Jesus was alive and with them and energizing them to carry forward his ministry. Something very real happened to those people and it has been giving power to the Christian community ever since. But the body that he was crucified with — dying and coming back and walking around the earth and then ascending into heaven in a three-storey universe — that doesn’t make sense. If I have to put it in those terms, it loses its power because it’s not credible to me.&quot;

Four months after the controversy started, the United Church&#x27;s General Council executive issued a statement of support for Phipps.

===Apology for residential schools=== 
In October 1998, speaking on behalf of the United Church, Phipps apologized on behalf of the United Church to Canada&#x27;s indigenous First Nations for abuse in church-run residential schools earlier in the century, saying in part, &quot;To those individuals who were physically, sexually, and mentally abused as students of the Indian Residential Schools in which The United Church of Canada was involved, I offer you our most sincere apology. You did nothing wrong. You were and are the victims of evil acts that cannot under any circumstances be justified or excused.&quot;

===Other initiatives===
Phipps travelled across Canada to speak to people in an initiative called &quot;Faith and the Economy&quot;. He also co-authored &quot;Bearing Faithful Witness: United Church–Jewish Relations Today&quot; with Rev. Clint Mooney, about the church&#x27;s relationship with Judaism.

==Later life and death==
Following his time as moderator, Phipps returned to ministry at Scarboro United in Calgary. In 2000, he co-founded Faith and the Common Good with Rev. Ted Reeve, an interfaith group dedicated to working together on projects for the common good. Their main initiative became known as &quot;Greening Sacred Spaces.&quot;

Phipps continued to be a community organizer, hospital chaplain and adult educator.

In 2002, Phipps was the New Democratic Party candidate in the Calgary Southwest by-election contested by newly elected Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper. Phipps challenged Harper&#x27;s conservative economic and social views. During the campaign, Harper commented that he &quot;despise[d]&quot; Phipps, and declined to participate in debates with him. In the election, Phipps came in second with just over 20 per cent of the vote.

In 2005, Phipps was awarded the Alberta Centennial Medal.

Phipps retired from ministry in 2007, but stayed actively involved with community projects. He died on March 4, 2022, at the age of 79.

<doc id="1202313" wikidata="Q5189567" url="?curid=1202313" title="Crowninshield family">
<text>The Crowninshield family is an American family that was historically prominent in seafaring, political and military leadership, and the literary world. The founder of the American family emigrated from what is now Germany in the 17th century. The family is one of several known collectively as Boston Brahmins, a reference to old wealthy New England families of British Protestant origin that became influential in the development of American institutions and culture.

==History==
Johann Caspar Richter was a Saxon landowner and shipper-trader originally from Germany. He moved to a supposed German village of Kronenschieldt (sometimes spelled Cronenschieldt), near Leipzig, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) and married Maria Hahn, from Annaburg in Saxony-Anhalt.

His illegitimate son, Johannes Caspar Richter von Kronenschieldt, was born in Leipzig circa 1661 and adopted the village&#x27;s name as part of his surname, together with an entirely spurious and canting coat of arms. After being educated briefly at the University of Leipzig, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts in about 1688. He anglicized his name to &quot;John Caspar Crowninshield&quot; and married Elizabeth Allen on December 5, 1694, in Lynn, Massachusetts, and bought land near Spring Pond. Their children began the Crowninshield family known today. He died December 19, 1711.

His great-granddaughter Mary Crowninshield (1778–1835) was the wife of Senator Nathaniel Silsbee, whose son-in-law was Jared Sparks.

==Influence in America==
===Seafaring===
Shortly after moving to Essex County, Massachusetts, and especially the town of Salem, the Crowninshields began to make their impact on American seafaring. They helped settle Salem and led it to seafaring prominence, helping turn it into an important seaport as well as a settlement for affluent families by the late 18th century. George Crowninshield (1733–1815) founded the Crowninshield &amp; Sons shipping business with his five sons.

In Salem, the family built Crowninshield&#x27;s Wharf, one of three major town wharves at the time. As a result, the Crowninshields became highly influential in the international trade in tea (including Bohea from as far as China), cod, molasses, Madeira wine, Valencia oranges, Málaga grapes, salt, iron, pepper, and other goods.
Lieutenant Benjamin Crowninshield (b. 1757) served from 17 October 1778 on the American privateer &quot;Black Prince&quot; during the American Revolution, which raided Fishguard and disrupted British merchant shipping. He was a son of Jacob Crowninshield (1732–1774) and Hannah Carlton (1734–1824). A son of George Crowninshield (b. 1733), sea adventurer George Crowninshield Jr. (1766–1817) built and sailed the yacht &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Barge&quot;, named after the ancient ship used by Cleopatra VII. It became the first yacht to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

===Government and military===
Although the family&#x27;s prominence was originally gained via seafaring, Crowninshields later became most noted for the public service, primarily in politics and the military. The early Crowninshields were Republicans and were noted for their strong support of Thomas Jefferson.

The Crowninshields were particularly praised for their naval leadership. Benjamin Williams Crowninshield was United States Secretary of the Navy under both James Madison and James Monroe, while his great-great-grandson Charles Francis Adams III, also a noted yachtsman, was secretary under Herbert Hoover. Former U.S. Representative Jacob Crowninshield was appointed to be the second person to hold the position by Thomas Jefferson, but did not serve due to his ill health. His grandson Arent S. Crowninshield served as an admiral in the United States Navy and later as chief of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Navigation during the McKinley Administration.

William Crowninshield Endicott was United States Secretary of War during Grover Cleveland&#x27;s first term as President of the United States. Caspar F. Crowninshield served as a Union Army captain and brevet brigadier general during the American Civil War, while Charles Francis Adams Jr., great-grandson of Benjamin Williams Crowninshield, served as a general.

Since the late 19th century, the family&#x27;s political influence has been exercised primarily at the state and local levels, including in Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York, where multiple branches of the family settled, as well as in Massachusetts.

===The arts and publishing===
During the late 19th and 20th centuries, the Crowninshields were mostly visible in the arts and publishing. Frank Crowninshield created and edited &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine, while Francis Boardman Crowninshield became an accomplished painter and architect. Stained-glass artist Frederic Crowninshield (1845–1918) was an instructor at the Museum of Fine Arts School of Drawing and Painting in Boston.

Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee was the executive editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; during the publication of the Pentagon Papers and played a pivotal role in the newspaper&#x27;s coverage of the Watergate scandal. He stepped down as executive editor and became a member of the editorial board and vice president at large in 1991.

===Other activities===
The Crowninshields were responsible for bringing the first elephant to the U.S. The elephant arrived on April 12, 1796, brought by Jacob Crowninshield, who had purchased it in India. The two-year-old elephant was brought into New York City, costing Crowninshield a total of $450. It later toured the country extensively after Crowninshield sold it for $10,000.

Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield, wife of Francis Boardman Crowninshield, is known as one of America&#x27;s first major historical preservationists and was a founding member of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

Charles Francis Adams IV, great-great-great-grandson of Benjamin Williams Crowninshield and the son of Charles Francis Adams III, was the first president and later chairman of the Raytheon Company.

==Brahmin life==
===Marriages===
The Crowninshields, like other Boston Brahmin families, often married into other noted families. Frances (Fanny) Cadwalader Crowninshield, daughter of George and Harriet Sears Crowninshield, married John Quincy Adams II, son of Charles Francis Adams, grandson of president John Quincy Adams and great-grandson of president John Adams. William Crowninshield Endicott was a direct descendant of John Endecott, the first Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Fellow Salem resident Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s father, Captain Nathaniel Hathorne Sr., sailed ships owned by the Crowninshields, who were his in-laws.

The Crowninshields were also intermarried with the Derby and Pickman families of Salem, two other dynastic families of merchants. George Crowninshield married Mary Derby, sister of Elias Hasket Derby, who married Elizabeth Crowninshield, George Crowninshield&#x27;s sister, in 1761. Anstiss Derby, Elias Hasket&#x27;s daughter by his Crowninshield wife, Derby married merchant Benjamin Pickman Jr.

Rebecca Crowninshield Browne married Robert F. Bradford, who was Governor of Massachusetts from 1947 to 1949. Francis Boardman Crowninshield married the former Louise Evaline du Pont (later Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield) of the Du Pont family.

===First home===
On June 20, 1700, in Massachusetts Bay Colony, Dr. John Casper Richter von Crowninshield (Johannes Kaspar Richter von Kronenscheldt, as first spelled), became a historic landowner of an estate by Spring Pond in Lynn and Salem, married Elizabeth, daughter of the former land owners of the estate. He was a physician from Germany, descended from a noble family of the Kingdom of Saxony. He bought the land near Spring Pond with all the &quot;houses, buildings, waters, and fishings&quot; from Elizabeth (Clifford) Allen of Salem, widow of Jacob Allen. He settled on the land in the interest of retreat and farming.

===Friends and rivals===
The Crowninshields also had close associations with other elite families, including the Monroes, Jeffersons, and Madisons. Robert Gould Shaw was a close friend of Benjamin W. Crowninshield (not to be confused with Benjamin Williams Crowninshield) at Harvard. The Crowninshields also periodically lived with other noted figures, such as William Bentley, who boarded with the family in Salem from 1791 to 1819; Andrew Jackson and his wife, who lived with Benjamin William Crowninshield and his family in Georgetown; and Condé Nast, who was Frank Crowninshield&#x27;s New York City roommate.

Although they were known for feuding with other noted families, particularly the anti-Jeffersonian Derby family of Salem, they also had close connections to the powerful. During the Salem witch trials, the Crowninshields were aligned on the side of John Hathorne, one of the associate magistrates of the trials; no Crowninshields were accused during the trials.

===Education===
Early Crowninshields were typically educated at institutions like St. Paul&#x27;s School and Phillips Academy, followed by Harvard University, Harvard Law School, Williams College, or the service academies. Family members have held trusteeships and provost positions at Harvard College and Boston College, among other institutions.

==Historic sites==
The Crowninshield influence is particularly visible in Essex County, Massachusetts, and especially in their historical homebase of Salem.

The homestead of Captain John Crowninshield, son of Johannes Caspar Richter von Kronenschieldt and Elizabeth Allen, survives as the Crowninshield-Bentley House, which is governed by the Peabody Essex Museum and is part of Salem&#x27;s historical tourism industry.

Benjamin Williams Crowninshield&#x27;s federal-style waterfront mansion, once used by President James Monroe on a trip to Salem, is now used as home for the Brookehouse for Women. Some other sites, such as the Crowninshield Wharf have been lost to time and damage.

Other places and things named for the family include Crowninshield Island, located off nearby Marblehead, and , a during World War I.

There are also streets named for members of the Crowninshield family in Providence (Rhode Island); Brookline, Marblehead, and Peabody (Massachusetts); and The Bronx (New York City), all locations where noted Crowninshields lived.

Family members are buried in several of New England&#x27;s most prominent cemeteries, including Mount Auburn Cemetery and the ancient burial ground in Salem.

* In one of E.E. &#x27;Doc&#x27; Smith&#x27;s novels in the Lensman series, an enemy base is disguised as an office building belonging to the wealthy Crowninshield family.

<doc id="1202314" wikidata="Q786973" url="?curid=1202314" title="Autocovariance">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, given a stochastic process, the autocovariance is a function that gives the covariance of the process with itself at pairs of time points. Autocovariance is closely related to the autocorrelation of the process in question.

== Auto-covariance of stochastic processes ==
=== Definition ===
With the usual notation formula_1 for the expectation operator, if the stochastic process formula_2 has the mean function formula_3, then the autocovariance is given by

where formula_4 and formula_5 are two instances in time.

=== Definition for weakly stationary process ===
If formula_2 is a weakly stationary (WSS) process, then the following are true:

:formula_7 for all formula_8

and

:formula_9 for all formula_10

and

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the lag time, or the amount of time by which the signal has been shifted.

The autocovariance function of a WSS process is therefore given by:

which is equivalent to

:formula_13.

=== Normalization ===
It is common practice in some disciplines (e.g. statistics and time series analysis) to normalize the autocovariance function to get a time-dependent Pearson correlation coefficient. However in other disciplines (e.g. engineering) the normalization is usually dropped and the terms &quot;autocorrelation&quot; and &quot;autocovariance&quot; are used interchangeably.

The definition of the normalized auto-correlation of a stochastic process is

:formula_14.

If the function formula_15 is well-defined, its value must lie in the range formula_16, with 1 indicating perfect correlation and −1 indicating perfect anti-correlation.

For a WSS process, the definition is

:formula_17.

where

:formula_18.

===Properties===
====Symmetry property====
:formula_19
respectively for a WSS process:
:formula_20

====Linear filtering====
The autocovariance of a linearly filtered process formula_21
:formula_22
is
:formula_23

== Calculating turbulent diffusivity==
Autocovariance can be used to calculate turbulent diffusivity. Turbulence in a flow can cause the fluctuation of velocity in space and time. Thus, we are able to identify turbulence through the statistics of those fluctuations.

Reynolds decomposition is used to define the velocity fluctuations formula_24 (assume we are now working with 1D problem and formula_25 is the velocity along formula_26 direction):

:formula_27

where formula_25 is the true velocity, and formula_29 is the expected value of velocity. If we choose a correct formula_29, all of the stochastic components of the turbulent velocity will be included in formula_24. To determine formula_29, a set of velocity measurements that are assembled from points in space, moments in time or repeated experiments is required.

If we assume the turbulent flux formula_33 (formula_34, and &quot;c&quot; is the concentration term) can be caused by a random walk, we can use Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion to express the turbulent flux term:

:formula_35

The velocity autocovariance is defined as

:formula_36 or formula_37

where formula_38 is the lag time, and formula_39 is the lag distance.

The turbulent diffusivity formula_40 can be calculated using the following 3 methods:

<text>Star Tower is a digital television and FM radio transmitting tower on Winton Road near North Bend Road in the College Hill neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio designed and built by the Landmark Tower Company. The three-legged lattice tower stands high. It is one of the tallest lattice towers in the world and the second tallest of the four that rise above 900 feet in Cincinnati, Ohio. The tower is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, though the company owns an additional tower in Mount Auburn for its main station in the area, CBS affiliate WKRC-TV (next to WSTR and WKRC&#x27;s studios).

==History==
In 1988, Hoker Broadcasting Company, then owner of WOFX-FM and WSTR-TV (&quot;Star 64&quot;), purchased a site in College Hill from a developer who had planned to build self-storage lockers. It was registered with FCC as Antenna Structure Registration (ASR) 1014132. The following year, nearby residents sued to stop the project out of concern that the tower would be an eyesore. Hoker settled with the group in 1991, agreeing to restrictions on how the land surrounding the tower could be developed. Landmark Tower Company completed the tower in October 1991. At the time, it was the tallest tower in Cincinnati and the tallest of its kind in the world. It increased WSTR&#x27;s transmitting power by and added 1 million potential viewers.

==Stations==
An omnidirectional antenna atop Star Tower continues to transmit WSTR-TV, while a number of FM radio stations, including WREW, WGRR, and WYGY also broadcast from the tower. WRRM has a backup antenna located on this tower; their primary is on the WXIX tower closer to the center of Cincinnati.

===Television===

<text>The Orava () is a river in north-western Slovakia passing through a picturesque country, in the Orava county. Its source is nowadays the Orava water reservoir whose waters flooded the confluence of Biela (White) Orava and Čierna (Black) Orava in 1953. It flows into the river Váh near the village of Kraľovany. It is long and its basin size is .

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Orava&quot; may be of Pre-Slavic or Slavic origin. Pre-Slavic &quot;*er-/*or-&quot;: fast, swift (swift river). Proto-Slavic &quot;*or-&quot;, &quot;*orati&quot;: to scream, to roar. Slovak rivers &quot;Revúca&quot; and &quot;Hučava&quot; have the same etymology (a roaring river). The similar names from other Slavic countries are e.g. the Croatian river Orljava (1234 Orauua), the Ukrainian river and the village Oriava or &quot;Orzawiec&quot; (in the river system of Dnieper). The suffix &quot;-ava&quot; could be derived from Germanic &quot;-ahwa&quot; (water), but it is typical also for older Slovak hydronyms.

The earliest records are &quot;fl. Arua&quot; (1287) and &quot;Oravia&quot; (1314).

<doc id="1202324" wikidata="Q7887873" url="?curid=1202324" title="United Indoor Football">
<text>United Indoor Football (UIF) was an indoor American football league in the United States that operated from 2005 to 2008. Ten owners from the National Indoor Football League, including one expansion (the Dayton Warbirds, which never played a game in UIF) and two from arenafootball2 (af2) took their franchises and formed their own league. The league was based in Omaha, Nebraska.

On July 22, 2008, it was announced that the UIF would be merging with the Intense Football League for the 2009 season. The merged league is known as the newest incarnation of the Indoor Football League.

==Field==
United Indoor Football was played exclusively indoors, in arenas usually designed for either basketball or ice hockey teams. The field was the same width (85 feet) as a standard NHL hockey rink. The field was 50 yards long with up to an 8-yard end zone. (End zones could be a lesser depth with League approval.) Depending on the stadium in which a game was being played, the end zones may be rectangular (like a basketball court) or curved (like a hockey rink). There was a heavily padded wall on each sideline, with the padding placed on top of the hockey dasher boards. The field goal uprights were 9 feet wide, and the crossbar was 18 feet above the playing surface. Unlike Arena football, the ball was not &quot;live&quot; when rebounded off the nets behind the end zone or their support apparatuses.

A player was counted as out of bounds on the sidelines if they came into contact or fell over the boundary wall.

==Players==
Each team fielded eight players at a time from a 21-man active roster.

==Ball movement==
The ball was kicked off from the goal line. The team with the ball was given four downs to gain ten yards or score. Punting was illegal because of the size of the playing field. A receiver jumping to catch a pass needed to get only one foot down in bounds for the catch to be deemed a completed catch. Balls that bounced off the padded walls that surrounded the field were live. The defending team could return missed field goal attempts that fell short of the end zone. If a free kick struck the ceiling or any object hanging from said ceiling while over the field of play, it was immediately dead and belonged to the receiving team 5 yards from mid-field.

==Scoring==
The scoring was the same as in the NFL with the addition of a drop kick field goal worth four points during normal play or two points as a post-touchdown conversion. Blocked extra points and turnovers on two-point conversion attempts could be returned by the defensive team for two points. A rouge-kickoff downed in the end zone was worth 1 point to the kicking team; a rouge-kickoff being when the kick returner is caught in his own end zone. A free kick recovered in the end zone by the kicking team was considered a touchdown.

==Timing==
A game consisted of four 15-minute quarters with a halftime intermission 20 minutes in length. The clock typically only stopped for time-outs, penalties, injuries, and official clarifications. Further stoppages occurred for incomplete passes and out of bounds during the final 90 seconds of the second and fourth quarters. A mandatory official&#x27;s time-out, called a promotional timeout, was assessed after the first and third quarters and is 90 seconds in duration. Another mandatory official&#x27;s time-out, called a warning period, was assessed with 90 seconds to play at the end of each half. The game could also be stopped for further promotional time-outs but not exceed 90 seconds per league rules.

==Overtime rules==
Each team received one possession from the 25-yard line to try to score. If one team outscored the other on the possession, the game was over. If still tied after an overtime possession, then each team received a new possession from the 25-yard line to try to score.

The United Football League had expressed an interest in the use of the United Bowl name after the UIF-IFL merger, but the Indoor Football League has retained the &quot;United Bowl&quot; trademark and uses it for the name of the United Conference championship. The UFL instead uses the name &quot;The Championship&quot; for its championship game.

<doc id="1202325" wikidata="Q29894" url="?curid=1202325" title="Orava Castle">
<text>Orava Castle (, , ) is a castle situated on a high rock above Orava river in the village of Oravský Podzámok, Slovakia. The castle was built in the Kingdom of Hungary, with the oldest parts being built in the thirteenth century and the most recent parts in the early seventeenth century. Many scenes of the 1922 film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; were filmed here, the castle representing Count Orlok&#x27;s Transylvanian castle.

Orava Castle stands on the site of an old wooden fortification, built after the Mongol invasion of Hungary of 1241. Its history follows a familiar pattern of construction, destruction, reconstruction, fire, various ownerships and territorial squabbles. The original design was in Romanesque and Gothic style; it was later reconstructed as a Renaissance and Neo-Gothic structure, hugging the shape of the 520-metre spur on which it perches.

The mining magnates Thurzo family, who took charge in the mid-16th century, were responsible for a great deal of rebuilding work, although its present form was not finalised until 1611. It burned down again in 1800, after which it was no longer used as a residence. After a period of dilapidation dating until World War II, the castle became a national monument.

==Origins==
 The natural rock formation known as &quot;castle cliff&quot; – a limy spur 112 meters (367 ft) high, surrounded by the river Orava and its right tributary stream – has been inhabited since primeval times. During its history a wooden rampart became a strong walled castle of which the first written record dates back to 1267. At that time only the ground floor was built of stone, while the upper floors were made of wood.

In 1370 as part of the Hungarian Kingdom the castle became the center of Árva county. A tetrahedral multi-story tower was built here in the 14th century, probably on older foundations, as a donjon – the place of &quot;last defense&quot; within the castle. After 1474, King Matthias Corvinus gave orders to build a square and a residence-wing in the Middle Castle. The buildings were situated in front of the castle. In 1534 John of Dubovec obtained the castle and became head of the county. He started to rebuild the castle and to make new fortifications. He ordered the building of a half-round tower in the Upper Castle that in 1539 was followed by two large round fortifications for cannons in the Middle Castle. The middle platform was also configured for cannon firing. In the years 1539 to 1543 John of Dubovec built a five-story palace in the empty space between the tower and the stone wall of the Upper Castle. The threat of Ottoman invasion was the reason for building these new fortifications. A new gate with a ditch and drawbridge in the Lower Castle was completed in 1543. The &quot;Tower of the Archives&quot; was built against the castle walls.

==16th–18th centuries==

After the death of John of Dubovec, his heirs quarreled over the inheritance and the situation became so bad that the castle even became a store-house. It was paid for by the mine owner Ferenc Thurzó. A lot of building activity took place at the castle following this time period. The wooden stairs in the Upper Castle were replaced by stone stairs. The same was done to the stairs between the Middle and the Upper Castle with the drawbridge. A cellar was also dug out of the stone of the castle court and a single-story residence-wing was built in the lower castle near the west wall.

György Thurzó also carried out some important repairs. One of the first was the building of a tunnel between both castle gates, above which was formed a large terrace. After this was all done he moved the living-quarters and the building of the chapel started using parts of some old architecture. The interior furnishing of the chapel was later arranged in a taste which suited the new owners of the castle. One of the most well-known features is the Renaissance grave tomb of György Thurzó from the beginning of the 17th century and the Baroque altar from 1751–1752.

==Disuse, fire and the museum==

After the death of Erzsébet Czobor, the widow of György Thurzó, the castle became the property of Thurzó&#x27;s daughters, who entrusted its administration to an elected administrator. Because of changes in politics, society and the economy, the castle gradually lost its important functions. Only a few clerks stayed on and the uninhabited and disused parts of the castle gradually deteriorated. The greatest catastrophe affected the castle in 1800, when a gigantic fire destroyed all the wooden parts of the castle. Some objects from the Lower Castle were recovered after the fire because they had been covered by the roof shingles. However, the objects from the Middle and Upper Castle were not reconstructed until 1861.

To find a use for the historical object, Ödön Zichy, the administrator of the property (as administrator of Veszprém County), organized a foundation which had the aim of founding a regional museum of Orava. The first exhibition took place at the Thurzo Palace in 1868. Nowadays, the Orava Museum is one of the oldest in Slovakia. Its most attractive expositions are those of the Castle Chapel, the Knights&#x27; Room, and several rooms with period-style furnishing. Further highlights include the Painting Gallery, the Weapon room, and the scientific, ethnographic and archaeological collections.

==Cultural references==
Many scenes of the 1922 film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; were filmed here, the castle representing Count Orlok&#x27;s Transylvanian castle; In their 2020 TV adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat also used Orava as their Castle Dracula. Orava Castle served as the filming location for the 1972 film, &quot;Adam Šangala&quot; as well as for the 2000 film, &quot;&quot;. It was also used by the Polish video game company CD Projekt as inspiration for the fictional Kaer Morhen, fortress for the witchers of the Wolf School in Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s &quot;The Witcher&quot; book series. Van Helsing&#x27;s season 5 was filmed on location.

<text>The 2004 Alberta Senate nominee election, formally the 3rd Alberta Senate nominee election of Alberta was held on November 22, 2004, to nominate appointments to the Senate of Canada. The Senate nominee election was held in conjunction with the 2004 Alberta general election.

The 3rd Senate nominee election took place six years following the 2nd Senate nominee election held in 1998, and 15 years after the first Senate nominee election held in 1989.

The election came five months following the 2004 Canadian federal election which saw the Liberal government secure a minority under new Prime Minister Paul Martin. Previous Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien refused to appoint senators elected in Alberta in 1998. Previous Senate nominees from 1998 Bert Brown and Ted Morton, both of the Reform Party failed to be nominated before their five-year term expired. Brown, one of the four nominated senators was subsequently appointed to the Senate by Prime Minister Stephen Harper on July 10, 2007, and Betty Unger was appointed to the Senate on January 6, 2012, becoming the second and third elected senators in the upper chamber.

==Background==

In the late-1980s, the Government of Alberta under Premier Don Getty had made vailed statements about holding a province-wide election to select nominees for the Senate with the expectation that Meech Lake Accord would be ratified and the Prime Minister would make appointments to the Senate on the basis of names submitted by each province&#x27;s premier. The Senate nominee election was featured in the Speech from the Throne in February 1989 for the fourth session of the 21st Alberta Legislature, but died on the order paper when the legislature was dissolved to hold an early provincial election. The bill was reintroduced in the summer of 1989 during the 22nd Alberta Legislature, which permitted the vote to take place during the October 1989 Alberta municipal elections.

Stan Waters, nominated by the Reform Party, won the 1989 Senate nominee election, with 41.7 per cent of the popular vote. On October 17, 1989, one day after the Senate nominee election, Mulroney stated he was not bound to appoint a senator by the results of the election, and instead intended to follow the process in the Meech Lake Accord. Getty responded to the comments by Mulroney by stating he would provide a list to the Prime Minister with a single name, Waters. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had criticized the electoral process, although he nonetheless made a public announcement agreeing to advise Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn to appoint Waters to the Canadian Senate on June 11, 1990.

Waters time in the Senate was cut short when he was diagnosed with brain Cancer in the Summer of 1991, and died months later in Calgary on September 25, 1991, at the age of 71, four years before the mandatory retirement age for Canadian senators.

Prime Minister Jean Chrétien appointed four senators from Alberta prior to the 1998 Alberta Senate nominee election, including Nicholas Taylor on March 7, 1996, Jean Forest on May 17, 1996, Thelma Chalifoux on November 26, 1997, and Douglas Roche. Roche, a former Member of Parliament for the Progressive Conservative Party was appointed to the Senate on September 17, 1998, one month before the 1998 Alberta Senate nominee election was held. Former Prime Minister Joe Clark criticized the appointment as a &quot;cynical, provocative and wrong&quot;. Alberta Premier Ralph Klein penned an open letter to Chrétien criticizing the appointment and calling for Senate reform. Klein went on to criticize Chrétien stating &quot;the prime minister of this country is saying that democracy is a joke&quot;.

=== Candidates ===
Both of Alberta&#x27;s opposition parties, the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party (NDP), boycotted the election in demonstration of their opposition to the process. As a result, the only candidates to contest the election were representatives of the right-of-centre Alberta Progressive Conservatives, Alberta Alliance Party and Social Credit parties, and a number of independents. After pressure from the Liberal and NDP camps (who did not want their supporters to feel compelled to vote for a right-of-centre candidate), polling officers were instructed to advise voters on election day that they did not have to vote in the Senate election.

In early October, Progressive Conservative Premier Ralph Klein promised that the Progressive Conservative Party would not run a candidate in the Senate nominee election, which he reversed after pressure from caucus. Klein&#x27;s rationale for the boycott was that the Senate was a &quot;federal thing&quot;. Five candidates were nominated from the Progressive Conservative Party, including the 1998 Senate election winner Bert Brown. The second nominee from the 1998 election, Ted Morton declined to run, and instead contested a seat in the Legislative Assembly as a Progressive Conservative. The other Progressive Conservative candidates were Betty Unger, a home-care nurse and conservative party supporter; Cliff Breitkreuz, a farmer and former Reform and Alliance Member of Parliament for Yellowhead; Jim Silye, President of an oil exploration company and former Calgary Stampeders player; and David Usherwood, a farmer and financial advisor.

Three candidates were nominated under the Alberta Alliance Party, including Michael Roth, a small business owner from Lacombe; Vance Gough a Calgary entrepreneur and business instructor at Mount Royal University who previously finished fourth of four candidates in 1998; and Gary Horan, a small business owner from Edmonton.

Two independent candidates contested the election, Link Byfield, the former publisher of &quot;Alberta Report&quot; and western rights advocate; and Tom Sindlinger, an economist and former Member of the Legislative Assembly for Calgary-Buffalo.

The Social Credit party attempted to nominate Gerry Pyne of Calgary, but were unable to obtain the 1,500 signatures required to get on the ballot, and the party therefore was not represented in the election.

As of the date of the election, there were three vacant Alberta seats in the Senate of Canada, with another set to become vacant within six years. Voters could vote for up to four candidates, though many candidates encouraged their supporters to vote for only one, a legal option, to prevent the vote totals of their competitors from rising.

A total of 2,176,341 votes were cast (714,709 ballots).

== Aftermath ==
Overall, Albertans were seen as uninterested in the Provincial election and Senate nominee election. Elections Alberta stated the provincial election turnout was 44.7 per cent of eligible voters, while the Senate nominee election saw a turnout of 44.2 per cent (885,289 ballots). Although total turnout included 85,937 (9.7 per cent) voters decline ballots, and 84,643 (9.6 per cent) voters rejecting their ballot. Commentators such as the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; editorial board called the large number of declined and rejected ballots a grim picture for Alberta&#x27;s senator-in-waiting strategy for reform. Many Liberal and NDP supporters were observed discarding their Senate nominee ballots, while the proportion of spoiled ballots was higher in ridings and polls where the Liberals and NDP did well in the concurrent Legislature election.

The Klein government sent the four senators-in-waiting on a cross-country trip following the election in Spring 2005 to promote Senate reform. Although Klein refused to give the group of nominees the opportunity to speak at the August 2005 Council of the Federation meeting in Banff.

Prime Minister Paul Martin refused to advise Governor General Adrienne Clarkson to appoint the elected Senate nominees to the Upper Chamber, instead putting forward three appointees of his choosing: Grant Mitchell, Elaine McCoy and Claudette Tardif on March 24, 2005. After the announcement, Breitkreuz publicly admonished Klein for his perceived failure to advocate for Alberta&#x27;s senators-in-waiting.

On April 19, 2007, on the advice of newly elected Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Governor General Michäelle Jean appointed Bert Brown to the Senate to fill the vacancy left by Daniel Hays&#x27; early retirement.

Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach decided to defer new Senate elections set to take place when the terms of senators-in-waiting ended, which was controversial. Senator-in-waiting Link Byfield decided to resign as he felt he lacked a mandate. Remaining candidates Breitkreuz and Unger both accepted the term extension. Unger was appointed to the Senate on January 6, 2012, after the mandatory retirement of Tommy Banks.

<text>Orava () is a reservoir in northernmost Slovakia, forming the largest lake in Slovakia (35.2 km2).

==History==
The reservoir was created by the construction of a dam between 1941 and 1953 on the former two sources of the Orava river. Several former villages had to be inundated for this purpose, including Hámre, Osada, and Ústie. The most notable of these is Slanica, the remains of which form a large island in the reservoir – the Slanica Island, which today hosts a museum exhibition. The reservoir is currently protected by the Horná Orava Protected Landscape Area.

The average depth of the reservoir is 15 meters.

== Islands ==

=== Vtáčí ostrov ===

In the northeastern extension of the reservoir lies Vtáčí ostrov (&quot;Bird Island&quot;), a government ornithological reservation with Protected Bird Area status. The nature reserve in and around the island is also part of the Horná Orava Protected Landscape Area.

Waterfowl species inhabiting the Bird Island reserve include herons, great cormorants, spoonbills and several others. The wetlands around the Orava reservoir are also regarded as some of the most important in Europe. The protection of the forests skirting the Orava Reservoir has helped prevent erosion.

=== Slanický ostrov ===

Slanický ostrov (&quot;Slanica Island&quot;) is the largest island of the reservoir and one of the largest lake islands of any water reservoir in Slovakia. The island is mildly forested with a series of groves, and includes some of the last architectural remnants of the defunct Oravan village of Slanica, the birthplace of 18th century Slovak intellectual, cleric and linguist Anton Bernolák (Antonius Bernolacius). The centrepiece of the surviving architecture is the original church of Slanica. A new building constructed after the creation of the Orava reservoir and the island is an art gallery. Slanica Island is the only island in Slovakia to house a museum of art or art gallery, with the gallery serving as its main tourist attraction, along with the preserved church.

<doc id="1202336" wikidata="Q1404893" url="?curid=1202336" title="Power window">
<text>Power windows or electric windows are automobile windows which can be raised and lowered by pressing a button or switch, as opposed to using a crank handle.

== History ==

Packard had introduced hydraulic window lifts (power windows) in fall of 1940, for its new 1941 Packard 180 series cars. This was a hydro-electric system. In 1941, the Ford Motor Company followed with the first power windows on the Lincoln Custom (only the limousine and seven-passenger sedans). Cadillac had a straight-electric divider window (but not side windows) on their series 75.

Power assists originated in the need and desire to move convertible body-style tops up and down by some means other than human effort. The earliest power assists were vacuum-operated and were offered on Chrysler Corporation vehicles, particularly the low-cost Plymouth convertibles in the late 1930s. 

Shortly before World War II, General Motors developed a central hydraulic pump for working convertible tops. This system was introduced on 1942 convertibles built by GM. Previously, GM had used a vacuum system which did not have the power to handle increasingly larger and complex (four side-windows vs. only two) convertible top mechanisms. 

Chief Engineer of the Buick Division, Charles A. Chayne, &quot;...had introduced an electrically controlled hydraulic system into the 1946 Buick convertibles that provided fingertip operation of the top, door windows, and front seat adjustment&quot;. These systems were based on major hydraulic advances made in military weapons in preparation for World War II. 

The &quot;Hydro-Electric&quot; system (windows, front seat adjustment and convertible top) was standard on 1947 model year. The seat and window assist system became available on GM closed cars (standard on some Cadillac Series 75 models and all Series 60 Specials, commonly called &quot;Fleetwood&quot; beginning with the 1948). The full system was standard only on the high-end GM convertibles made by Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. It was only available as a package; that is, power assisted windows, front seat, and convertible top (where applicable). This feature can be identified in 1948 and later General Motors model numbers with an &quot;X&quot; at the end, such as the 1951 Cadillac Sixty Special sedan, model 6019X. The electrically operated hydraulic pump system was shared by Hudson and Packard for their 1948 through 1950 models. The driver&#x27;s door contained four buttons in addition to the remaining individual windows.

Ford also had a similar electro-hydraulic system on higher-end convertibles. Mercury and Ford Sportsman convertibles (with wood trim) were equipped with power windows on four windows from 1946 through 1948 and Mercury and Lincoln by 1951. These systems were used by other luxury car models (Imperial and Packard) until Chrysler introduced the all-electric operation on the 1951 Imperial. The availability of power windows increased with the use of small, high-torque electric motors. General Motors also followed with full electric operation in 1954. This included four-way and then six-way seats, which were introduced in 1956. Chevrolet introduced the oddity of power front windows (only) in the 1954 model. Ford also introduced full four-door power windows in sedans in 1954. The full-sized 1955 Nash &quot;Airflyte&quot; models featured optional power windows.

Electrically-operated vent windows were available as early as 1956 on the Continental Mark II. The 1960s Cadillac Fleetwood came standard with power front and rear vent windows, in addition to standard power side windows, for a total of eight power window controls on the driver&#x27;s door panel. 

Modern heavy-duty highway tractors frequently have an option for power window controls; however, these are generally what is referred to as &quot;straight air&quot;. That is, the compressed air system used for air brakes is also used for the windows. These types of trucks have long used compressed air cylinders for seat height adjustment. In a similar fashion to the electro-hydraulic system, the compressed air is merely released to lower the window and/or seat. The compressed air is then admitted to the respective cylinder to raise the window or seat. 

In a typical auto/light truck installation, there is an individual switch at each window and a set of switches in the driver&#x27;s door or a-frame pillar, so the driver can operate all the windows. These switches took on many different appearances, from heavy chrome plate to inexpensive plastic. 

However, some models like Saab, Volvo, Mazda and Holden have used switches located in the center console, where they are accessible to all the occupants. In this case, the door-mounted switches can be omitted. This also removes the need to produce separate door components and wiring for left and right-hand drive variants.

== Operation ==
Power windows are usually inoperable when the car is not running. This is primarily a security feature. It would be a simple thing to allow electric power windows to be operable when the ignition is turned off, however it would also make the car much easier to steal. Some systems offer the compromise of leaving power applied to the windows until a passenger door is opened at which time the window power is removed.

Hydraulic drive systems could lower the windows at rest, since pressure from the hydraulic system was merely released to lower the window. Raising the windows required an electrically operated pump to operate and introduce pressure at the appropriate cylinder. These systems also required pressure lines to each cylinder (in the doors, as well as on certain cars, to the power seat and a power operated convertible top). Because of the complexity, the system could also leak fluid. 

Many modern cars have a time delay feature, first introduced by Cadillac in the 1980s, called &quot;retained accessory power&quot;. This allows operation of the windows and some other accessories for ten minutes or so after the engine is stopped. Another feature is the &quot;express-down&quot; window, which allows the window to be fully lowered with one tap on the switch, as opposed to holding the switch down until the window retracts. Many luxury vehicles during the 1990s expanded on this feature, to include &quot;express-up&quot; on the driver&#x27;s window, and recently, some manufacturers have added the feature on all window switches for all passengers&#x27; convenience. This is done by activating the switch until a &quot;click&quot; response is felt.

Power windows have become so common that by 2008, some automakers eliminated hand crank windows from all their models. So many vehicles now have power windows that some people no longer understand the (formerly) common sign from another driver of using their hand to simulate moving a window crank to indicate that they wish to speak with someone when stopped at a light or in a parking lot. The 2008 Audi RS4 sold in Europe, however, still has roll-up windows for the rear doors although its counterpart sold in the U.S. has power windows for all doors.

== Safety ==
Power windows have come under some scrutiny after several fatal accidents in which children&#x27;s necks have become trapped, leading to suffocation. Some designs place the switch in a location on a hand rest where it can be accidentally triggered by a child climbing to place his or her head out of the window. To prevent this, many vehicles feature a driver-controlled lockout switch, preventing rear-seat passengers (usually smaller children) from accidentally triggering the switches. This also prevents children from playing with them and pets riding with their heads out windows from activating the power window switch. 

A power window lockout switch is a popular convenience that allows the driver to prevent passengers, usually children, from using the windows. Many cars have a feature called &quot;courtesy power on&quot; which allows the windows to remain operational for a brief period after the key is taken out of the ignition, so that adjustments can be made without putting the key back in. Additionally, some vehicles offer the option to operate the windows from outside the car using a remote. 

Starting with the 2008 model year, U.S. government regulations required automakers to install safety mechanisms to improve child safety. However, the rules do not prevent all potential injuries to a hand, finger, or even a child&#x27;s head, if someone deliberately holds the switch when the window is closing. In 2009, the U.S. auto safety administration tentatively decided against requiring all cars to have automatic reversing power windows if they sense an obstruction while closing. Proposed requirements concern automatic (&quot;one-touch up&quot;) window systems, but most vehicles with this feature already have automatic-reversing. The federal government made a written contract that all automakers should make the lever switches (as opposed to the rocker and toggle switches) standard on all new vehicles by 1 October 2010.

<text>The Sissiboo River is a river located in Digby County, Nova Scotia, Canada. The origins of the name &quot;Sissiboo&quot; are not known. The most credible is a derivation from the Mi&#x27;kmaq word for river, &quot;Seboo.&quot;

The river flows out of a chain of lakes near the border with Annapolis County, named respectively, First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Lakes. The Sissiboo River follows a winding course, draining a large area and passing through the former lumbering communities of Weymouth Falls and Weymouth Mills.

The Sissiboo becomes tidal at Weymouth and its estuary is called Weymouth Harbour. Trunk 1 crosses the river in Weymouth. An inactive Dominion Atlantic Railway bridge was demolished in 2012. Further downstream, Highway 101 crosses near the fishing community of New Edinburgh. The river empties into St. Mary&#x27;s Bay.

The river currently is obstructed by four dams, three of which are used to generate hydroelectricity: Weymouth Falls, Sissiboo Falls and Fourth Lake.

<doc id="1202347" wikidata="Q194534" url="?curid=1202347" title="Dylan Carlson (musician)">
<text>Dylan Carlson (born March 12, 1968) is an American musician, best known as the guitarist and founder of the drone metal/post-rock group Earth, and the main contributor to his solo project Drcarlsonalbion.

==Early life and education==
Carlson was born in Seattle, Washington, United States. His father worked for the Department of Defense, and as a result, moved quite frequently. Living in Philadelphia, Texas, New Mexico, and New Jersey, before coming back to live in Washington state.

==Career==
He had first become interested in being a rock musician at age 15, inspired by bands such as Molly Hatchet, AC/DC, and Black Sabbath. He also cites the Melvins, and composers La Monte Young and Terry Riley as major influences on his music. It was in Olympia, Washington that he met Slim Moon, Greg Babior, Dave Harwell and Joe Preston, with whom he would later form Earth. During this time, he would often make &quot;sonic collages&quot; with his then-roommate Kurt Cobain. From 1991 to 1996, Earth had an ever-changing lineup. Carlson attributes a lack of (full-length) studio album recordings from 1997 to 2005 to &quot;legal and drug problems&quot;.

==Personal life==
Carlson was a good friend of Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and, like Cobain, has struggled with heroin addiction, particularly so after Cobain&#x27;s death. Dylan was the one who purchased the gun that ended Kurt&#x27;s life, which he bought at Cobain&#x27;s request six days before his death. He was actually with investigator Tom Grant when he searched Kurt&#x27;s home, but they failed to search the greenhouse above the garage where his body lay.

In his biography of Cobain, &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot;, Charles R. Cross asserted that &quot;In Bloom&quot; was a &quot;thinly disguised portrait&quot; of Carlson.
He now lives in recovery of heroin addiction. He has survived a rare form of hepatitis B and liver failure. Carlson was married to fellow Earth member, drummer Adrienne Davies for a time. Davies still remains in the band despite their split.

<doc id="1202349" wikidata="Q4921729" url="?curid=1202349" title="Black Rock Mountain State Park">
<text>Black Rock Mountain State Park is a Georgia, United States, state park west of Mountain City in Rabun County, in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is named after its sheer cliffs of dark-colored biotite gneiss. Astride the Eastern Continental Divide at an elevation of , the park provides many scenic overlooks and vistas of the southern Appalachian Mountains. On a clear day, four states are visible: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. In addition to Black Rock Mountain itself, the park includes four other peaks over in elevation, making it the state&#x27;s highest state park. As of 2019, it was open to visitors year round.

==History==
Most of the rock outcrops found throughout the park are made of biotite gneiss, a metamorphic rock that underlies a large portion of the Georgia Blue Ridge. Black Rock Mountain State Park was established in 1952 and originally consisted of . Before the park was established, Rabun County native John V. Arrendale began assembling the area that would later become the park, making his first purchase in 1938. Numerous purchases have added to the park&#x27;s area, including added in 1995 with funding received from then-Governor Zell Miller&#x27;s Preservation 2000 land acquisition program. Several smaller acquisitions have added acreage to the park&#x27;s southwest corner.

==Climate==
==Hiking and camping==
There are five hiking trails through forests, alongside mountain streams and around Black Rock Lake. The Tennessee Rock Trail crosses Black Rock Mountain&#x27;s north slope before climbing across the mountain&#x27;s summit and following the Eastern Continental Divide. From the trail&#x27;s namesake feature, Tennessee Rock, vistas can be seen that extend northward into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, including Kuwohi, the highest point in Tennessee.

The James E. Edmonds Trail is named for &quot;Mr. Eddie&quot; Edmonds, one of the park&#x27;s earliest and longest-serving rangers. This rugged trail features four secluded campsites that allow backpackers with reservations to escape into the park&#x27;s quiet backcountry. The campsites are undeveloped and offer no facilities. In places the Edmonds Trail weaves in and out of laurel-filled coves and follows mountain streams with small waterfalls. At the trail&#x27;s northern end, there are Lookoff Mountain and views of Wolffork Valley, the source of the Little Tennessee River.

The Ada-Hi Falls Trail is named for the Cherokee word for &quot;forest&quot;. The quarter-mile trail begins near the entrance of the park&#x27;s RV camping area and leads into a moist north-facing cove filled with rosebay rhododendron. The lower portion of the trail becomes very steep and utilizes a series of wooden steps before ending on the observation platform for Ada-hi Falls, a small cascade typical of falls found in the upper reaches of mountain coves. The trail is short but strenuous due to the elevation change.

The Black Rock Lake Trail was completed in August, 2007. This gently rolling path encircles Black Rock Lake and features several wooden bridges that span streams, as well as trailside benches that afford scenic views of the lake.

The park&#x27;s newest trail, the Norma Campbell Cove Trail, is only 200 yards. It begins on the southern edge of the Eastern Continental Divide near the Marie Mellinger Center and descends into the upper reaches of a south-facing cove filled with ferns, mayapple and trillium. It passes huge boulders and large rock outcrops, as well as small springs that flow into Stekoa Creek, one of the principal tributaries of the federally designated &quot;wild and scenic&quot; Chattooga River. The cove and trail are named for the late Norma Campbell, a popular park naturalist, who led the decade-long effort to acquire funding for the construction of the Marie Mellinger Center, the park&#x27;s primary programming and special event facility.

The park offers a variety of camping experiences. It has a 44-site campground featuring water, electricity and cable TV hookups for recreational vehicles. There are also 12 isolated walk-in tent sites in Hickory Cove on the mountain&#x27;s southeastern slope. On the park&#x27;s westernmost ridge are ten rental cottages and Camp Tsatu-gi, a primitive pioneer campsite designed for use by organized groups.

==Marie Mellinger Center==
The park&#x27;s newest facility, the Marie Mellinger Center, was completed in July 2010. Named for one of the region&#x27;s most-noted botanists, the facility is designed to accommodate a variety of uses including special events; country, bluegrass, and gospel music programs; nature arts and crafts; and other naturalist-led programs. A deck overlooks densely forested Norma Campbell Cove. A separate construction project to add restroom facilities to the Mellinger Center was completed in March 2011. The facility was formally dedicated during a public ceremony on October 8, 2011.

==Black Rock Lake==

In September, 2010, Black Rock Lake was officially opened for boating for the first time since its construction in 1974. Canoes, kayaks, and other small boats are authorized. No boat ramps exist.

The Turtle Rock Fishing Pier, near Taylors Chapel Road, is barrier-fee and offers easy lake access for fishermen with mobility challenges.

During the spring and early summer, Black Rock Lake is regularly stocked with rainbow trout. In addition, anglers fish for catfish, bream, yellow perch, and large-mouth bass.

==Tornado ==

On April 27, 2011, the park was hit by an EF-2 tornado spawned from the same supercell thunderstorm that had earlier in the evening tracked across central Alabama, heavily damaging Tuscaloosa. Thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted, and large parts of the park&#x27;s camping areas and summit area were damaged. In the camping area, several cars and trucks were crushed by falling trees, however, no injuries were sustained. The park was re-opened to the public on May 6; however, large swaths of downed timber remain, especially on the mountain&#x27;s westernmost flank above 3,200 feet. Most park trails were re-opened on May 13, with the exception of the Ada-hi Falls Trail. A large section of wooden steps was crushed by fallen trees. The trail has since been repaired and reopened.

<text>Natrolite is a tectosilicate mineral species belonging to the zeolite group. It is a hydrated sodium and aluminium silicate with the formula . The type locality is Hohentwiel, Hegau, Germany.

It was named natrolite by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1803. The name is derived from &quot;natron&quot; (), the Greek word for soda, in reference to the sodium content, and &quot;lithos&quot; (), meaning stone. Needle stone or needle-zeolite are other informal names, alluding to the common acicular habit of the crystals, which are often very slender and are aggregated in divergent tufts. The crystals are frequently epitaxial overgrowths of natrolite, mesolite, and gonnardite in various orders.

Larger crystals most commonly have the form of a square prism terminated by a low pyramid, the prism angle being nearly a right angle. The crystals are tetragonal in appearance, though actually orthorhombic. There are perfect cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism. The mineral also often occurs in compact fibrous aggregates, the fibers having a divergent or radial arrangement. Natrolite is readily distinguished from other fibrous zeolites by its optical characteristics.

Between crossed nicols the fibers extinguish parallel to their length, and they do not show an optic figure in convergent polarized light. Natrolite is usually white or colorless, but sometimes reddish or yellowish. The luster is vitreous, or, in finely fibrous specimens, silky.

The specific gravity is 2.2, and the hardness is 5.5. The mineral is readily fusible, melting in a candle-flame to which it imparts a yellow color owing to the presence of sodium. It is decomposed by hydrochloric acid with separation of gelatinous silica.

== Environment ==
Natrolite occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities of basaltic igneous rocks. It is also common in nepheline syenites.

== Notable localities ==
Excellent specimens of diverging groups of white prismatic crystals are found in compact basalt at the Puy-deMarman, Puy-de-Dôme, France. Huge crystals have been found on the Kola Peninsula, Russia (30 cm by 13 cm). The walls of cavities in the basalt of the Giants Causeway, in County Antrim, are frequently encrusted with slender needles of natrolite, and similar material is found abundantly in the volcanic rocks (basalt and phonolite) of Salesel, Aussig and several other places in the north of Bohemia. Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec has produced large crystals associated with many rare minerals. The Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, New Jersey, Oregon, and British Columbia have also produced excellent specimens.

Several varieties of natrolite have been distinguished: fargite is a red natrolite from Glenfarg in Perthshire; bergmannite or spreustein is an impure variety which has resulted by the alteration of other minerals, chiefly sodalite, in the augite syenite of southern Norway.

Natrolite is one of the closely associated minerals with benitoite, a rare mineral with its type locality in San Benito County, California.

Natrolite forms opaque white spherical inclusions within nodules of translucent green prehnite from Wave Hill, Northern Territory, Australia.

<doc id="1202354" wikidata="Q1071784" url="?curid=1202354" title="Árva County">
<text>Árva County (, , , , ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary since the 14th century until 1920. Its territory is now in northern Slovakia and southern Poland. Today, the Slovak name is only used as an informal designation of the corresponding territory (see Orava region).

==Geography==

Between 1804-1854 and 1860-1920, Árva County shared borders with Austrian Galicia and the Hungarian counties of Trencsén, Turóc and Liptó County. The county&#x27;s territory was situated along the Árva (Orava) river between Zázriva (Zázrivá) and the Tatra mountains. Its area was around 1910. Now the territory is divided between Poland and Slovakia. The main Polish town of Orava is Jabłonka.

==Capitals==
The county seat was at the Orava Castle (Hungarian: Árva vára). After the destruction of the town by the Lithuanian troops in 1683, the seat was moved to Alsókubin (also Kolbin, Kublen, Kubin, Also Helben, Clbin, Culbyn, Cublyn, present-day Dolný Kubín).

==History==
Emerging from the Zólyom royal land (), the first written mention about Árva County is from 1349. However, the territory had been still referenced as a district in 1351-1368 and it finally became a county with its own self-administration in 1370.

On 13 September 1850, following the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, Árva and Turóc counties were merged to form Árva-Turóc county, becoming part of the Military District of Preßburg; this merger was re-affirmed in 1853 and 1854. In 1860 Hungary&#x27;s pre-1850 counties, including Árva, were restored.

In the aftermath of World War I, the territory of the whole county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia. After a border dispute (treated in detail under Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts) several villages in the north-east territory were exchanged between Poland and Czechoslovakia. The former county&#x27;s Czechoslovak part was abolished with effective date 1 January 1923 and its territory became a part of Váh County.

<doc id="1202355" wikidata="Q2165082" url="?curid=1202355" title="List of Medal of Honor recipients">
<text>The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. Recipients must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own lives above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. The President of the United States, in the name of the United States Congress, has awarded more than 3,520 Medals of Honor, including 19 second awards to the nation&#x27;s soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen since the decoration&#x27;s creation in 1861.

The citations highlighting acts of gallantry that received the Medal of Honor have been and continue to be regularly released by book publishers. After the Second World War, both the Army and Navy produced hardbound Medal of Honor compilations. Between 1964 and 1979, the United States Senate Subcommittee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and later the Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs produced a number of consolidated compilations of all Medal of Honor citations to date. Additions and changes to the list of recipients of the medal since 1979 have been regularly published by the Congressional Research Service.

The first Army Medal of Honor was awarded to Private Jacob Parrott during the American Civil War for his role in the Great Locomotive Chase.

Bernard John Dowling Irwin was the first (chronologically by action) Medal of Honor recipient during the Apache Wars. His actions on February 13, 1861, are the earliest for which the Medal of Honor was awarded.

The first African American recipient for this award was Robert Blake, who manned his post during a naval engagement against infantry while under heavy fire (William Harvey Carney is commonly and erroneously cited as the first African-American to receive a medal because his actions in combat did precede those of the other African-American recipients, although his physical medal was not presented until 1900). The only female Medal of Honor recipient is Mary Edwards Walker, a Civil War surgeon. Her medal was rescinded in 1917 along with many other non-combat awards, but it was restored by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.

While current law, (), beginning in 1918, explicitly states that recipients must be serving in the U.S. Armed Forces at the time of performing a valorous act that warrants the award, exceptions have been made. Notably, Charles Lindbergh, while a reserve member of the U.S. Army Air Corps, received his Medal of Honor as a civilian pilot. Although Medals of Honor can only be awarded to members of the U.S. Armed Forces, being a U.S. citizen is not a prerequisite for eligibility to receive the medal. Sixty-one Canadians who were serving in the United States Armed Forces have received the Medal of Honor; most received it for actions in the American Civil War. Since 1900, only four have been awarded to Canadians. In the Vietnam War, Peter C. Lemon was the only Canadian-born recipient of the Medal of Honor. However, he was a U.S. citizen.

==19th century==

===American Civil War===
The American Civil War (1861–1865) was a war between the United States (the Union) and the Southern states of the newly formed Confederate States of America under Jefferson Davis. The Medal of Honor was established during this conflict; 1523 were awarded (33 posthumously) for acts of bravery and gallantry in combat. Most awards were granted after the end of the Civil War with two late awards to Andrew Jackson Smith and Alonzo Cushing in 2001 and 2014.

===Indian Wars===
The term Indian Wars is the name generally used in the United States to describe a series of conflicts between colonial or federal governments and the American Indian population resident in North America before the arrival of settlers. During this conflict the Medal of Honor was presented to 426 soldiers, 13 posthumously for acts of bravery and gallantry in combat.

===Korean Expedition===
The United States expedition to Korea in 1871, also known as &quot;Shinmiyangyo &quot; (&quot;Western Disturbance of the Shinmi (1871) year&quot;), was the first American military action in Korea. It took place predominantly on and around the Korean island of Ganghwa. The reason for the presence of the American military expeditionary force in Korea was to support an American diplomatic delegation sent to establish trade and diplomatic relations with Korea and to ascertain the fate of the &quot;General Sherman&quot; merchant ship. The isolationist nature of the Joseon Dynasty government and the assertiveness of the Americans led to an armed conflict between the two parties. Eventually, the United States failed to secure its objectives.

===Spanish–American War===

The Spanish–American War (Spanish: &quot;Guerra Hispano-Estadounidense&quot;, &quot;desastre del 98&quot;, &quot;Guerra Hispano-Cubana-Norteamericana&quot; or &quot;Guerra de Cuba&quot;) was a military conflict between Spain and the United States that began in April 1898. Hostilities halted in August of that year, and the Treaty of Paris was signed in December. The war began after the American demand for Spain&#x27;s peacefully resolving the Cuban fight for independence was rejected, though strong expansionist sentiment in the United States may have motivated the government to target Spain&#x27;s remaining overseas territories: Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam and the Caroline Islands.

Riots in Havana by pro-Spanish &quot;Voluntarios&quot; gave the United States reason to send in the warship . This action by the U.S. indicated high national interest. Tension among the American people was raised because of the explosion of USS &quot;Maine&quot;, and &quot;yellow journalism&quot; - sensationalist reporting that exposed Spain&#x27;s extensive atrocities, agitating American public opinion. The war ended after decisive naval victories for the United States in the Philippines and Cuba. The Treaty of Paris ended the conflict 109 days after the outbreak of war giving the United States ownership of the former Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Guam. 111 people received the Medal of Honor from the Spanish–American War.

===Samoan Civil War===
The Samoan Civil War(s) occurred in the Samoa Islands of the South Pacific in the late 19th century. The Samoan Civil Wars were a series of conflicts between Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, ending in the partitioning of the island chain in 1899. The concluding event was the Second Samoan Civil War. The first Samoan Civil War lasted for eight years. The warring Samoan parties were supplied with arms, training and sometimes even combat troops by Germany, Britain and the United States. These three powers valued Samoa as a refueling station for coal fired shipping. In addition, these countries sought to gain more power in Europe and wanted Samoa due to the scarcity of unclaimed territory from 1870 onwards.

===Philippine-American War===

The Philippine–American War was an armed military conflict between the United States and Filipino nationalists who established the “First Philippine Republic”, fought between 1899 and at least 1902, which arose from a Filipino political struggle against U.S. occupation of the Philippines. While the conflict was officially declared over on July 4, 1902, American troops continued hostilities against remnants of the “Philippine Army” and other insurgent groups until 1913, and some historians consider these unofficial mop-up operations part of the war.

Eighty-six men were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions in the Philippine–American War: 70 from the Army, 10 from the Navy, and 6 from the Marine Corps. Four of the awards were posthumous. Among the recipients were Webb Hayes, the son of former U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, and two prominent Marine Corps officers, Hiram I. Bearss and David Dixon Porter. Bearss became known for leading long-range reconnaissance patrols behind enemy lines and was later wounded as a colonel in World War I. Porter was from a distinguished military family and rose to become a major general. José B. Nísperos, a member of the Philippine Scouts who was honored for continuing to fight after being wounded, was the first Asian recipient of the Medal of Honor.

===Boxer Rebellion===
The Boxer Movement or Boxer Rebellion, which occurred in China from November 1899 to September 7, 1901, was an uprising by members of the Chinese Society of Right and Harmonious Fists against foreign influence in areas, politics, religion and technology that occurred in China during the final years of the Manchu rule (Qing Dynasty). The members of the Society of Right and Harmonious Fists were simply called &quot;boxers&quot; by the Westerners due to the martial arts and calisthenics they practiced. The uprising began as a xenophobic, anti-foreign, nationalist peasant-based movement in northern China. They attacked foreigners who were building railroads and supposedly violating Feng shui, as well as Christians, who were held responsible for the foreigners in China. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. Tens of thousands of Chinese Christians, Catholic and Protestant alike, were killed mostly in Shandong and Shanxi Provinces as part of the uprising. This drew criticism from many Chinese, including Chinese Christian Sun Yat-Sen (later to help overthrow the Manchu dynasty in 1911 and become first president of the Republic of China). The government of Empress Dowager Cixi was not helpful, and diplomats, foreign civilians, soldiers and some Chinese Christians retreated to the legation quarter where they held out for fifty-five days until a multinational coalition rushed 20,000 troops to their rescue. The Chinese government was forced to indemnify the victims and make many additional concessions. Subsequent reforms implemented after the crisis of 1900 laid the foundation for the end of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the modern Chinese Republic.

During the Boxer rebellion, 59 American servicemen received the Medal of Honor for their actions. Four of these were for Army personnel, twenty-two went to navy sailors and the remaining thirty-three went to Marines. Harry Fisher was the first Marine to receive the medal posthumously and the only posthumous recipient for this conflict.

==20th century==

===United States occupation of Veracruz, 1914===
The United States occupation of the Mexican port of Veracruz lasted for six months in response to the Tampico Affair of April 9, 1914. The incident came in the midst of poor diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United States, related to the ongoing Mexican Revolution.

Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels ordered that 56 Medals of Honor be awarded to participants in the occupation of Veracruz, the most for any single action before or since. In total 63 Medals of Honor were received for actions during the occupation; 1 Army, 9 to members of the United States Marine Corps and 53 to Navy personnel.

===Invasion and occupation of Haiti===
The first United States occupation of Haiti began on July 28, 1915, and ended in mid-August 1934.
===Occupation of the Dominican Republic===
The United States occupied the Dominican Republic from 1916 to 1924. In May 1917, Rear Admiral William Caperton forced Arias to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. U.S. Marines invaded and took control of the country within two months; in November that same year, the U.S. imposed a military government. The Marines restored order throughout most of the republic (with the exception of the eastern region); the country&#x27;s budget was balanced, its debt was diminished, and economic growth resumed; infrastructure projects produced new roads that linked all the country&#x27;s regions for the first time in its history; a professional military organization, the Dominican Constabulary Guard, replaced the partisan forces that had waged a seemingly endless struggle for power.

===World War I===
World War I, also known as the First World War and the Great War, was a global military conflict which took place primarily in Europe from 1914 to 1918. Over 40 million casualties resulted, including approximately 20 million military and civilian deaths. Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilized from 1914 to 1918. The immediate cause of the war was the June 28, 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb citizen of Austria-Hungary and member of the Black Hand. The retaliation by Austria-Hungary against Serbia activated a series of alliances that set off a chain reaction of war declarations. Within a month, much of Europe was in a state of open warfare.

During this war, 126 men received the Medal of Honor for their actions, including five Marines who received both the Army and Navy versions of the medal for the same action.

===Occupation of Nicaragua===
The United States occupied Nicaragua from 1909 to 1933 and intervened in the country several times before that. The American interventions in Nicaragua were designed to prevent the construction of a trans-isthmian canal by any nation but the US and stop endless civil war. Nicaragua assumed a quasi-protectorate status under the 1916 Chamorro-Bryan Treaty. The occupation ended as Augusto César Sandino, a Nicaraguan insurgent, led guerrilla bands against US troops. Furthermore, the onset of the Great Depression made it costly for the US to maintain occupation.

===World War II===


World War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict. The conflicts joined from two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German and Russian invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world&#x27;s nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. It involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history, and placed the participants in a state of &quot;total war&quot;, erasing the distinction between civil and military resources. This resulted in the complete activation of a nation&#x27;s economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities for the purposes of the war effort. Over 60 million people, the majority of them civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history. The worldwide financial cost of the war is estimated at a trillion 1944 U.S. dollars, making it the most costly war both in capital expenditures as well as loss of lives.

During this conflict 471 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor, 273 of them posthumously. A total of 42 Medals of Honor, representing 9% of all awarded during World War II, were presented for action in just two battles – 15 for actions during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and 27 for actions during the Battle of Iwo Jima. Also a total of 21 (4.5% of all World War II Medals of Honor) were awarded to members of the all-Japanese American 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, for actions in numerous battles across six different campaigns. Additionally, the only Medal of Honor ever presented to a member of the United States Coast Guard (Douglas Albert Munro) was received for actions during this war.

===Korean War===
The Korean War was ignited by the 1950 invasion of South Korea when the North Korean Army moved south on June 25, 1950, to seize the rest of the Korean peninsula, which had been formally divided since 1948. The conflict was then expanded by the United States, China&#x27;s and the Soviet Union&#x27;s involvement. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950, until the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953.

In South Korea, the war is often called &quot;6•25&quot;, or the 6•25 War (Korean: 6•25 전쟁), from the date of the start of the conflict or, more formally, &quot;Hanguk Jeonjaeng&quot; literally &quot;Korean War&quot;. In North Korea, while commonly known as the Korean War, it is formally called the Fatherland Liberation War. In the early days of the war, United States President Harry Truman called the United Nations response a &quot;police action&quot;. The war is sometimes called &quot;The Forgotten War&quot; because it is a major conflict of the 20th century that gets less attention than World War II, which preceded it, and the controversial Vietnam War, which succeeded it. In China, the conflict was known as the War to Resist America and Aid Korea, but is today commonly called the &quot;Korean War&quot;.

During this war, 146 Medals of Honor were awarded.

===Vietnam War===
The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, and in Vietnam as the American War, occurred from 1959 to April 30, 1975. The term &quot;Vietnam Conflict&quot; is often used to refer to events which took place between 1959 and April 30, 1975. The war was fought between the Communist-supported Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the United States supported Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam).

During the Vietnam War and in the following twelve months, 234 Medals of Honor were received and since 1978 a further 32 awards have been presented. Of the total of 266 awards, 174 were to the US Army, 15 to the US Navy, 57 to the USMC and 14 to the USAF. The first medal of the war was presented to Roger Donlon for rescuing and administering first aid to several wounded soldiers and leading a group against an enemy force. The first African American recipient of the war was Milton L. Olive III, who sacrificed himself to save others by smothering a grenade with his body. Riley L. Pitts was killed after attacking an enemy force with rifle fire and grenades and was the first African American commissioned officer of the war to receive the medal. Thomas Bennett was a conscientious objector who received the medal for his actions as a medic; three chaplains received the medal, including Vincent R. Capodanno, who served with the Marine Corps and was known as the Grunt Padre.

===USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident===
The USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident was an attack on a neutral U.S. Navy spy ship, the USS &quot;Liberty&quot;, by Israeli jet fighter planes and motor torpedo boats on June 8, 1967, during the Six-Day War. The combined air and sea attack, a result of the vessel being misidentified by the IDF, killed 34 and wounded more than 170 crew members, and damaged the ship severely.

===Post-Vietnam===
Since the end of the Vietnam War, also known as the Vietnam Conflict and Second Indochina War, the United States was involved in a number of smaller conflicts during the end of the Cold War, including in Grenada, Panama, and elsewhere. In the Post-Cold War, the United States was involved in conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean, and in the Balkans. No Medals of Honor have been awarded for any of the aforementioned conflicts so far either proactively or retroactively.

===Somalia===
On October 3, 1993, during the Battle of Mogadishu, members of the U.S. Army Rangers and SOCOM&#x27;s Delta Force executed a mission to capture members of Gen. Mohamed Farrah Aidid&#x27;s forces. In the ensuing battle, two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters were shot down. As the second Blackhawk, containing Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant, was hit and crashed, Master Sergeant Gary I. Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randall D. Shughart were in a nearby Blackhawk monitoring radio traffic. Gordon and Shughart were part of a sniper team for Delta Force that was assigned to watch over the operation, engaging targets from their position in the Blackhawk. As they monitored the downing of the second Blackhawk, it became evident that ground forces would not be available to secure the crash site and protect the critically injured crew of four, all of whom survived the crash. Gordon, the sniper team leader, requested that they be inserted at the 2nd crash site. His request was denied twice before finally being approved on the third request. The snipers were armed only with their sniper rifles and pistols.

Upon reaching the downed Blackhawk, which was under intense enemy fire, Gordon and Shughart pulled the crew from the wreckage and proceeded to set up a defensive perimeter. The snipers, assisted by the severely injured Durant, began to engage the attacking Somalis from the opposite side of the wreckage using assault rifles stored on the Blackhawk. Shughart and Gordon were eventually mortally wounded after nearly exhausting all available ammunition; Durant, the only survivor, was taken hostage. According to Durant&#x27;s account, 25 Somalis were killed and many more were wounded.

On Monday, May 23, 1994, President Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to the widows of Gordon and Shughart. They are the only snipers to have received the Medal of Honor. The film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, based on the book of the same name, includes a narrative of the events.

===War in Afghanistan===
The War in Afghanistan, which began on October 7, 2001, was launched by the United States, the United Kingdom, and NATO allies in response to the September 11 attacks. It was the beginning of the war on terror. The stated purpose of the invasion was to capture Osama bin Laden, destroy al-Qaeda and remove the Taliban regime which had provided support and safe harbor to al-Qaeda. Since 2001, 18 American service-members have received the Medal of Honor for actions in Afghanistan, four of them posthumously. Army Sergeant First Class Jared C. Monti received his medal for attempting to rescue a wounded soldier at the cost of his own life. Navy Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy received his for actions against insurgent forces and for sacrificing his life to call for help when his team had been overwhelmed by a much larger enemy force. Army Staff Sergeant Robert James Miller&#x27;s surviving family was presented with his medal on October 6, 2010. On June 19, 2014, Marine Corps Corporal Kyle Carpenter received the Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the White House. He is the eighth living recipient to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Afghanistan. John Allan Chapman (July 14, 1965 – March 4, 2002) was a Combat Controller in the United States Air Force who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on August 22, 2018, for his actions in the Battle of Takur Ghar. The first living recipient since the Vietnam War and the fourth Afghanistan recipient, Salvatore Giunta, received his for his actions in 2007 when he risked his life to save a wounded comrade. A second living recipient, Sergeant First Class Leroy Petry, received the medal from President Obama during a July 12, 2011 ceremony. Marine Corps Corporal Dakota Meyer became the third living recipient awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Ganjgal. An additional eleven living recipients have been awarded the Medal of Honor since Meyer. There have been twelve awards to the U.S. Army, three to the U.S. Navy, two to the U.S. Marine Corps and one to the U.S. Air Force.

===Iraq War===
The Iraq War, known in the United States as Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation TELIC in the United Kingdom was a conflict which began on March 20, 2003, with the United States-led invasion of Iraq by a multinational coalition composed of United States and United Kingdom troops supported by smaller contingents from Australia, Poland, as well as other nations. Seven service members have received the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq; five from the Army, one from the Marine Corps and one from the Navy. Paul Ray Smith was the first to receive it for his actions on April 4, 2003, when he held enemy forces back, allowing other wounded soldiers to be evacuated to safety. The other five recipients were Staff Sergeant David Bellavia, Staff Sergeant Travis Atkins, Corporal Jason Dunham of the Marine Corps, Specialist Ross A. McGinnis of the Army and Master-at-Arms Second Class Michael A. Monsoor of the U.S. Navy. The latter four of these each received it after being killed while using their own bodies to smother explosive devices to protect their comrades. On December 16, 2021, Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe was awarded the medal, posthumously, for his heroism in the Iraq conflict.

==Non-combat==
Before 1963, the Medal of Honor could be received for actions not involving direct combat with enemy or opposing foreign forces and 193 men earned the medal in this way. Most of these medals were presented to members of the United States Navy for rescuing or attempting to rescue someone from drowning. One of those awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing others was Fireman Second Class Telesforo Trinidad, who, as of 2020, has been the only Asian American sailor to be awarded the Medal of Honor. In addition to the medals that were presented for lifesaving acts, one Medal of Honor was presented to William Halford, who sailed in a small boat for 31 days to get help for the other crew of who had been stranded on an island. Three explorers were also presented with the medal by special acts of Congress. Charles Lindbergh received the medal for flying the first solo non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean. Floyd Bennett and Richard Evelyn Byrd received it for their participation in what was thought to be the first successful heavier-than-air flight to the North Pole and back. One recipient, Adolphus W. Greely, received his for a lifetime of military service.

==Foreign==
Current law, explicitly states that recipients must be serving in the U.S. Armed Forces at the time of performing a valorous act that warrants the award. However, the Medal of Honor has been presented to five First World War unknown soldiers of allied countries: the British Unknown Warrior in the United Kingdom by General Pershing on October 17, 1921; the Romanian Unknown Soldier, the French Unknown Soldier (entombed under the Arc de Triomphe), the Belgian Unknown Soldier, and the Italian Unknown Soldier (entombed in the Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II). Each of the countries reciprocally awarded medals to the U.S. Unknown Soldier.

<doc id="1202358" wikidata="Q336041" url="?curid=1202358" title="Diesel exhaust">
<text>Diesel exhaust is the exhaust gas produced by a diesel engine, plus any contained particulates. Its composition may vary with the fuel type, rate of consumption or speed of engine operation (e.g., idling or at speed or under load), and whether the engine is in an on-road vehicle, farm vehicle, locomotive, marine vessel, or stationary generator or other application.

Diesel exhaust causes lung cancer and other diseases such as asthma, and many premature deaths. Methods exist to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) in the exhaust.

Some countries have set a date to stop selling diesel vehicles, and some city centres will ban diesel cars.

==Composition==
The primary products of petroleum fuel combustion in air are carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen. The other components exist primarily from incomplete combustion and . While the distribution of the individual components of raw (untreated) diesel exhaust varies depending on factors like load, engine type, etc., the table below shows a typical composition.

The physical and chemical conditions that exist inside any such diesel engines under any conditions differ considerably from spark-ignition engines, because, by design, diesel engine power is directly controlled by the fuel supply, not by control of the air/fuel mixture, as in conventional gasoline engines. As a result of these differences, diesel engines generally produce a different array of pollutants than spark-driven engines, differences that are sometimes qualitative (what pollutants are there, and what are not), but more often quantitative (how much of particular pollutants or pollutant classes are present in each). For instance, diesel engines produce one-twenty-eighth the carbon monoxide that gasoline engines do, as they burn their fuel in excess air even at full load.

However, the lean-burning nature of diesel engines and the high temperatures and pressures of the combustion process result in significant production of NOx (gaseous nitrogen oxides), an air pollutant that constitutes a unique challenge with regard to their reduction. While total nitrogen oxides from petrol cars have decreased by around 96% through the adoption of exhaust catalytic converters as of 2012, diesel cars still produce nitrogen oxides at a similar level to those bought 15 years earlier under real-world tests; hence, diesel cars emit around 20 times more nitrogen oxides than petrol cars. Modern on-road diesel engines typically use selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to meet emissions laws, as other methods such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) cannot adequately reduce NOx to meet the newer standards applicable in many jurisdictions.

Moreover, the fine particles (fine particulate matter) in diesel exhaust (e.g., soot, sometimes visible as opaque dark-colored smoke) has traditionally been of greater concern, as it presents different health concerns and is rarely produced in significant quantities by spark-ignition engines. These especially harmful particulate contaminants are at their peak when such engines are run without sufficient oxygen to fully combust the fuel; when a diesel engine runs at idle, enough oxygen is usually present to burn the fuel completely. From the particle emission standpoint, exhaust from diesel vehicles has been reported to be significantly more harmful than those from petrol vehicles.

Diesel exhausts, long known for their characteristic smells, changed significantly with the reduction of the sulfur content of diesel fuel, and again when catalytic converters were introduced in exhaust systems. Even so, diesel exhausts continue to contain an array of inorganic and organic pollutants, in various classes, and in varying concentrations (see below), depending on fuel composition and engine running conditions.
==Chemical classes==
The following are classes of chemical compounds that have been found in diesel exhaust.

===Specific chemicals===
The following are classes of specific chemicals that have been found in diesel exhaust.
§ Includes all regioisomers of this aromatic compound. See &quot;ortho-, meta-, and para-&quot;isomer descriptions at each compound&#x27;s article.

==Regulation==

=== United States ===
To rapidly reduce particulate matter from heavy-duty diesel engines in California, the California Air Resources Board created the Carl Moyer Memorial Air Quality Standards Attainment Program to provide funding for upgrading engines ahead of emissions regulations. In 2008, the California Air Resources Board also implemented the 2008 California Statewide Truck and Bus Rule which requires all heavy-duty diesel trucks and buses, with a few exceptions, that operate in California to either retrofit or replace engines in order to reduce diesel particulate matter. 

===European Union===

Unlike international shipping, which had a sulfur limit of 3.5% mass/mass outside ECA until 2020, when it reduced to 0.5% outside ECA, diesel for on road use and off-road (heavy equipment) has been limited throughout the EU since 2009.

Diesel and gasoline have been limited to 10 ppm sulfur since 2009 (for on-road vehicles) and 2011 (non-road vehicles). Mandatory specifications also apply to more than a dozen fuel parameters.

==Health damage==

===Damage to public health===
Emissions from diesel vehicles are more harmful than those from petrol vehicles. Diesel combustion exhaust is a source of atmospheric soot and fine particles, which is a component of the air pollution implicated in human cancer, heart and lung damage, and mental functioning. Moreover, diesel exhaust contains contaminants listed as carcinogenic for humans by the IARC (part of the World Health Organization of the United Nations), as present in their List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens. In 2014, diesel exhaust pollution accounted for around one quarter of the pollution in the air and a high share of sickness caused by automotive pollution.

Diesel exhaust is a Group 1 carcinogen, which causes lung cancer and has a positive association with bladder cancer. It contains several substances that are also listed individually as human carcinogens by the IARC. 

===Occupational health effects===

Exposure to diesel exhaust and diesel particulate matter (DPM) is an occupational hazard to truckers, railroad workers, occupants of residential homes in the vicinity of a rail yard, and miners using diesel-powered equipment in underground mines. Adverse health effects have also been observed in the general population at ambient atmospheric particle concentrations well below the concentrations in occupational settings.

In March 2012, U.S. government scientists showed that underground miners exposed to high levels of diesel fumes have a threefold increased risk for contracting lung cancer compared with those exposed to low levels. The $11.5 million Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS) followed 12,315 miners, controlling for key carcinogens such as cigarette smoke, radon, and asbestos. This allowed scientists to isolate the effects of diesel fumes.

For over 10 years, concerns have been raised in the US regarding children&#x27;s exposure to DPM as they ride diesel-powered school buses to and from school. In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Clean School Bus USA initiative in an effort to unite private and public organizations in curbing student exposures.

===Due to particulates===

Diesel particulate matter (DPM), sometimes also called diesel exhaust particles (DEP), is the particulate component of diesel exhaust, which includes diesel soot and aerosols such as ash particulates, metallic abrasion particles, sulfates, and silicates. When released into the atmosphere, DPM can take the form of individual particles or chain aggregates, with most in the invisible sub-micrometer range of 100 nanometers, also known as ultrafine particles (UFP) or PM0.1.

The main particulate fraction of diesel exhaust consists of fine particles. Because of their small size, inhaled particles may easily penetrate deep into the lungs. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the exhaust stimulate nerves in the lungs, causing reflex coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. The rough surfaces of these particles makes it easy for them to bind with other toxins in the environment, thus increasing the hazards of particle inhalation.

A study of particulate matter (PM) emissions from transit buses running on ULSD and a mixture of biodiesel and conventional diesel (B20) was reported by Omidvarborna and coworkers, where they concluded that PM emissions appeared lower in cases of mixed diesel/biodiesel use, where they were dependent on the engine model, cold and hot idle modes, and fuel type, and that heavy metals in PM emitted during hot idling were greater than those from cold idling; reasons for PM reduction in biodiesel emissions were suggested to result from the oxygenated structure of biodiesel fuel, as well as arising from changes in technology (including the use of a catalytic converter in this test system). Other studies concluded that while in certain specific cases (i.e. low loads, more saturated feedstocks, ...), NOx emissions can be lower than with diesel fuel, in most cases NOx emissions are higher, and the NOx emissions even go up as more biofuel is mixed in. Pure biodiesel (B100) even ends up having 10-30% more NOx emissions compared to regular diesel fuel.

===Specific effects===
Exposures have been linked with acute short-term symptoms such as headache, dizziness, light-headedness, nausea, coughing, difficult or labored breathing, tightness of chest, and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Long-term exposures can lead to chronic, more serious health problems such as cardiovascular disease, cardiopulmonary disease, and lung cancer.
Elemental carbon attributable to traffic was significantly associated with wheezing at age 1 and persistent wheezing at age 3 in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study birth cohort study. Ambient traffic-related air pollution is associated with decreased cognitive function in older men.

The study of nanoparticles and nanotoxicology is in its infancy, and health effects from nanoparticles produced by all types of diesel engines are still being uncovered. It is clear, that diesel health detriments of fine particle emissions are severe and pervasive. Although one study found no significant evidence that short-term exposure to diesel exhaust results in adverse extrapulmonary effects, effects that are correlated with an increase in cardiovascular disease, a 2011 study in &quot;The Lancet&quot; concluded that traffic exposure is the single most serious preventable trigger of heart attack in the general public, as the cause of 7.4% of all attacks. It is not possible to tell how much of this effect is due to the stress of being in traffic and how much is due to exposure to exhaust.

Since the study of the detrimental health effects of nanoparticles (nanotoxicology) is still in its infancy, and the nature and extent of negative health impacts from diesel exhaust continues to be discovered, it remains controversial whether the public health impact of diesels is higher than that of petrol-fueled vehicles.

===Variation with engine conditions===
The types and quantities of nanoparticles can vary according to operating temperatures and pressures, the presence of an open flame, fundamental fuel type and fuel mixture, and even atmospheric mixtures. As such, the resulting types of nanoparticles from different engine technologies and even different fuels are not necessarily comparable. One study has shown that 95% of the volatile component of diesel nanoparticles is unburned lubricating oil. Long-term effects still need to be further clarified, as well as the effects on susceptible groups of people with cardiopulmonary diseases.

Diesel engines can produce black soot (or more specifically diesel particulate matter) from their exhaust. The black smoke consists of carbon compounds that have not burned because of local low temperatures where the fuel is not fully . These local low temperatures occur at the cylinder walls, and at the surface of large droplets of fuel. At these areas where it is relatively cold, the mixture is rich (contrary to the overall mixture which is lean). The rich mixture has less air to burn and some of the fuel turns into a carbon deposit. Modern car engines use a diesel particulate filter (DPF) to capture carbon particles and then intermittently burn them using extra fuel injected directly into the filter. This prevents carbon buildup at the expense of wasting a small quantity of fuel.

When starting from cold, the engine&#x27;s combustion efficiency is reduced because the cold engine block draws heat out of the cylinder in the compression stroke. The result is that fuel is not burned fully, resulting in blue and white smoke and lower power outputs until the engine has warmed. This is especially the case with indirect injection engines, which are less thermally efficient. With electronic injection, the timing and length of the injection sequence can be altered to compensate for this. Older engines with mechanical injection can have mechanical and hydraulic governor control to alter the timing, and multi-phase electrically controlled glow plugs, that stay on for a period after start-up to ensure clean combustion; the plugs are automatically switched to a lower power to prevent their burning out.

Wärtsilä states that there are two ways of forming smoke, on large diesel engines, one being fuel hitting metal and not having time to burn off. The other being, when too much fuel is in the combustion chamber.

Wärtsilä have tested an engine and compared smoke-output, when using conventional fuel system and common rail fuel system, the result shows improvement on all operation conditions when using the common rail system.

==Ecological effects==

Experiments in 2013 showed that diesel exhaust impaired bees&#x27; ability to detect the scent of oilseed rape flowers.

Emissions from diesel engines contribute to the production of ground-level ozone, which can damage crops, trees, and other vegetation. Diesel exhaust also contributes to the formation of acid rain, which affects soil, lakes, and streams, and can enter the human food chain via water, produce, meat, and fish.

Diesel exhaust plays a role in climate change. Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from diesel engines through improved fuel economy or idle reduction strategies can help address climate change, improve energy security, and strengthen the economies of countries. While diesel fuel contains slightly more carbon (2.68 kg CO2/litre) than petrol (2.31 kg CO2/litre), overall, the CO2 emissions of a diesel car tend to be lower due to higher efficiency. In use, on average, this equates to around 200 g CO2/km for petrol and 120 g CO2/km for diesel.

==Remedies==

===General===
With emission standards tightening, diesel engines are having to become more efficient and have fewer pollutants in their exhaust. Moreover, in recent years the United States, Europe, and Japan have extended emissions control regulations from covering on-road vehicles to include farm vehicles and locomotives, marine vessels, and stationary generator applications. Changing to a different fuel (i.e. dimethyl ether, and other bioethers as diethyl ether) tends to be a very effective means to reduce pollutants such as NOx and CO. When running on dimethyl ether (DME) for instance, particulate matter emissions are near-nonexistent, and the use of diesel particulate filters could even be omitted. Also, given that DME can be made from animal, food, and agricultural waste, it can even be carbon-neutral (unlike regular diesel). Mixing in bio ether (or other fuels such as hydrogen) into conventional diesel also tends to have a beneficial effect on the pollutants that are emitted. In addition to changing the fuel, US engineers have also come up with two other principles and distinct systems to all on-market products that meet the U.S. 2010 emissions criteria, selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Both are in the exhaust system of diesel engines, and are further designed to promote efficiency.

===Selective catalytic reduction===
Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) injects a reductant such as ammonia or urea — the latter aqueous, where it is known as diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) — into the exhaust of a diesel engine to convert nitrogen oxides (NOx) into gaseous nitrogen and water. SNCR systems have been prototyped that reduce 90% of the NOx in the exhaust system, with commercialized systems being somewhat lower. SCR systems do not necessarily need particulate matter (PM) filters; when SNCR and PM filters are combined, some engines have been shown to be 3-5% more fuel efficient. A disadvantage of the SCR system, in addition to added upfront development cost (which can be offset by compliance and improved performance), is the need to refill the reductant, the periodicity of which varies with the miles driven, load factors, and the hours used. The SNCR system is not as efficient at higher revolutions per minute (rpm). SCR is being optimized to have higher efficiency with broader temperatures, to be more durable, and to meet other commercial needs.

===Exhaust gas recirculation===

Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), on diesel engines, can be used to achieve a richer fuel to air mixture and a lower peak combustion temperature. Both effects reduce NOx emissions, but can negatively impact efficiency and the production of soot particles. The richer mix is achieved by displacing some of the intake air, but is still lean compared to petrol engines, which approach the stoichiometric ideal. The lower peak temperature is achieved by a heat exchanger that removes heat before re-entering the engine, and works due to the exhaust gases&#x27; higher specific heat capacity than air. With the greater soot production, EGR is often combined with a particulate matter (PM) filter in the exhaust. In turbocharged engines, EGR needs a controlled pressure differential across the exhaust manifold and intake manifold, which can be met by such engineering as use of a variable geometry turbocharger, which has inlet guide vanes on the turbine to build exhaust backpressure in the exhaust manifold directing exhaust gas to the intake manifold. It also requires additional external piping and valving, and so requires additional maintenance.

===Combined systems===
John Deere, the farm equipment manufacturer, is implementing a combined SCR-EGR design, in a 9-liter &quot;inline 6&quot; diesel engine that involves both system types, a PM filter and additional oxidation catalyst technologies. The combined system incorporates two turbochargers, the first on the exhaust manifold, with variable geometry and containing the EGR system; and a second a fixed geometry turbocharger. Recirculated exhaust gas and the compressed air from the turbochargers have separate coolers, and air merges before entering the intake manifold, and all subsystems are controlled by a central engine control unit that optimizes minimization of pollutants released in the exhaust gas.

===Other remedies===

A new technology being tested in 2016 has been created by Air Ink which collects carbon particles using a &quot;Kaalink&quot; cylindrical device that is retrofitted into a vehicle&#x27;s exhaust system, after processing to remove heavy metals and carcinogens, the company plans to use the carbon to make ink.

In India, the Chakr Dual Fuel Kit retrofits a diesel generator set to operate on a mixture of both gas and diesel, with 70% natural gas and 30% fossil fuel.

===Water recovery===
There has been research into ways that troops in deserts can recover drinkable water from their vehicles&#x27; exhaust gases.

<text>Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara [[Aktiebolag]](LKAB) is a state-owned Swedish mining company. The company mines iron ore at Kiruna and at Malmberget in northern Sweden. The company was established in 1890, and has been 100% state-owned since the 1950s. The iron ore is processed to pellets and sinter fines, which are transported by Iore trains (Malmbanan) to the harbours at Narvik and Luleå and to the steel mill at Luleå (SSAB). Their production is sold throughout much of the world, with the principal markets being European steel mills, as well as North Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. LKAB&#x27;s mines supply at least 80% of Europe&#x27;s iron ore.

==Operations==
, LKAB has over 4,500 employees in 12 countries. There are iron ore mines, processing plants and ore harbors in northern Sweden and Norway, and a sales office in Germany. LKAB has subsidiaries for industrial minerals with processing plants in Sweden, Finland, the UK, the Netherlands, Turkey and China. Additional subsidiaries are in Germany, the US and Hong Kong as well as representative offices in Slovakia, Greece, Spain and South Africa.

LKAB&#x27;s chief assets are among the magnetite orefields of northern Sweden. Its corporate headquarters are in Luleå and the main production sites are in Kiruna (Kiruna Mine) and Malmberget, close to Gällivare. The ore is partially processed on site, and is transported by freight train on Malmbanan to either Narvik or Luleå depending on final destination. LKAB has been ranked as among the 14th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights and resource extraction in the Arctic. In 2021, LKAB was ranked no. 23 out of 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle in the Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI).

<doc id="1202363" wikidata="Q422100" url="?curid=1202363" title="Scolecite">
<text>Scolecite is a tectosilicate mineral belonging to the zeolite group; it is a hydrated calcium silicate, CaAl2Si3O10·3H2O. Only minor amounts of sodium and traces of potassium substitute for calcium. There is an absence of barium, strontium, iron and magnesium. Scolecite is isostructural (having the same structure) with the sodium-calcium zeolite mesolite and the sodium zeolite natrolite, but it does not form a continuous chemical series with either of them. It was described in 1813, and named from the Greek word, σκώληξ (sko-lecks) = &quot;worm&quot; because of its reaction to the blowpipe flame.

==Crystal class==
It is monoclinic m with space group Cc, but crystals are pseudotetragonal. Scolecite, like natrolite and mesolite, usually occurs as acicular (needle-like) and fibrous aggregations. It has nearly the same angles between the crystal faces as does natrolite, but natrolite is orthorhombic and scolecite is monoclinic. The etched figures (figures that arise from the action of a solvent on a crystal face, and indicate its true symmetry) and the pyroelectric character of scolecite show that it crystallizes with a plane of symmetry, but no axis of symmetry, that is to say it belongs to the hemihedral class of the monoclinic system. Scolecite can therefore be distinguished from natrolite by an optical examination, since the acicular crystals do not extinguish parallel to their length between crossed nicol prisms. Twinning on the ortho-pinacoid is usually evident.

==Structure==
The structure of the aluminosilicate framework is the same for scolecite, natrolite and mesolite. Scolecite has long ordered chains, rotated 24° round the axis of the chain. One Ca cation and three H2O molecules are in four ion sites in the channels parallel to the c crystal axis. There is no sign of aluminium ions occupying silicon ion sites.

==Unit cell==
Scolecite is a monoclinic mineral, with the angle β equal to about 109° and four formula units per unit cell (Z = 4). Described in this way, various sources give the following values for the parameters of the unit cell, which has one long side and two short ones:
* a = 6.516 to 6.517 Å, b = 18.948 to 18.956 Å, c = 9.761 to 9.765 Å, β = 108.86 to 108.98°
* a = 6.52 to 6.53 Å, b = 18.96 to 18.97 Å, c = 9.76 to 9.78 Å, β = 108.9°
* a = 6.516 Å, b = 18.948 Å, c = 9.761 Å, β = 108.98°
Crystals, however, are pseudotetragonal, and this can be represented by taking a different unit cell, with twice as many formula units (Z = 8) and two long sides and one short one. The axes are redefined, a and b are very nearly equal and the angle β between the new a and c axes is very nearly equal to 90° (a truly tetragonal crystal would have a = b and β = 90° exactly). The sources give the following values:

==Crystal habit==

Scolecite commonly occurs as sprays of thin, prismatic needles, frequently flattened on one side, with slanted terminations and striated parallel to the length of the needles. The crystals appear to be pseudo-orthorhombic or pseudo-tetragonal, and may be square in cross section. It also occurs as radiating groups and fibrous masses. Epitaxial intergrowths (intergrowths of two different crystalline substances in a non-random way) with mesolite, Na2Ca2Al6Si9O30·8H2O, are common. (Natrolite, Na2Al2Si3O10·2H2O, does not directly form epitaxial overgrowths on scolecite). All three minerals may be developed in the same crystal.

Scolecite crystals appear to be monoclinic by X-ray analysis. Common forms include , , , and .

==Physical properties==
Scolecite is usually colorless or white, but can also be pink, salmon, red or green. It is transparent to translucent, with a white streak and a luster which is vitreous, or silky for fibrous specimens. It has a Mohs hardness of 5 to and a specific gravity in the range 2.16 to 2.40. (2.24 to 2.31 2.25 to 2.29 2.16 to 2.4 2.25 to 2.31). Cleavage is perfect in two directions parallel to the length of the crystals; the mineral is brittle with an irregular fracture. Twinning is common on , twin axis [001], as penetration or contact twins producing V-shaped or fishtail terminations. Scolecite is pyroelectric and piezoelectric, sometimes fluorescent yellow to brown in longwave and shortwave ultraviolet light. It is soluble in common acids. Not radioactive.

==Optical properties==
Biaxial (-) with refractive indices:
Nx = 1.507 to 1.513, Ny = 1.516 to 1.520, Nz = 1.517 to 1.521. Pleochroism has been reported, X: colorless Y: colorless Z: colorless.

==Environment==
Scolecite is a common zeolite. It is a mineral of secondary origin, and occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities (cavities filled with secondary minerals) of weathered basalts, also in gneisses and amphibolites, and in laccoliths and dikes derived from syenitic and gabbroic magmas, and in contact metamorphic zones. It is a hydrothermal mineral derived from low temperature alteration of basalts and related rocks, associated with other zeolites, calcite, quartz and prehnite. It can be found on top of the calcium zeolites heulandite, stilbite and epistilbite. Associated minerals include quartz, apophyllite, babingtonite, heulandite, stilbite and other zeolites.

==Localities==
Scolecite was first described from Kaiserstuhl in Baden-Württemberg in 1813. Divergent groups of prismatic crystals are found in the basalt of Berufjörður near Djúpivogur, Suður-Múlasýsla, Iceland and in the Deccan Traps near Pune in India; hence the synonym poonahlite for this species. Other occurrences include Riverside County, California; Skye, Scotland and Santa Catarina, Brazil.

There is no type locality. Most of the world&#x27;s finest scolecite specimens are found in the Tertiary Deccan Basalt near Nasik, Pune, in the state of Maharashtra, India. The quarries in the Nasik region produce large, colorless sprays of well terminated coarse scolecite crystals that are commonly twinned on to form V-shaped terminations with V-shaped striations on . The scolecite is commonly found alone or on stilbite and is covered with laumontite or colorless, pale green or white fluorapophyllite. It is also found in the region as massive radiating material with powellite, and in cavities in basalt as colorless, flattened crystals in radiating sprays on blocky green apophyllite covered by tiny, thin, colorless apophyllite plates.

Scolecite has been reported from many other localities, including Antarctica, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Faroe Islands, France, Germany, Greenland, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States and Yugoslavia.

<text>Bobby Brown Park, formerly known as Bobby Brown State Outdoor Recreation Area and prior to that Bobby Brown State Park, is a park located near Elbert County and Middleton. The park&#x27;s name is a memorial to Robert T. Brown, a lieutenant in the United States Navy who was killed during World War II aboard the submarine .

The park is located on a plot of land that was once Petersburg, a small town that thrived during the 1790s due to its location where the Broad River and Savannah River met. The park is now located next to both Lake Strom Thurmond and Richard B. Russell Lake, two manmade reservoirs. When water levels are low, however, the old town of Petersburg can once again be glimpsed by visitors. The park&#x27;s strategic location near so much water provides much fishing and water recreation.

==History==
Bobby Brown State Park was downgraded to Bobby Brown State Outdoor Recreation Area in 2009. In 2015, a lease agreement was reached with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The park is now operated by the government of Elbert County, Georgia.

<text>The February 13, 1979, windstorm was a natural phenomenon which happened in the West Coast region of Canada and the Pacific Northwest. During the early morning, an intense wave cyclone moved across southern Vancouver Island in British Columbia. South of the low center, a strong atmospheric pressure gradient was carried across Washington, with associated high winds. With a cold airflow moving toward the northeast interacting with the high terrain of the Olympic Mountains, a lee low developed east of the Olympics. The mesoscale low caused a particularly intense pressure gradient across the Kitsap Peninsula region.

==Wind velocity==
At 6 mb (mililbars) over 8 miles, the geostrophic wind potential easily exceeded 200 knots (roughly translating to about 100 knots in a geostrophic flow over the Earth&#x27;s rough surface, or 115 mph). As reported by the crew of the Hood Canal Bridge, average winds reached at least 80 mph out of the south, with gusts in the triple digits. The wind velocities were cross-checked on two different anemometers at the bridge control tower.

==Damage==
Extensive damage to trees on surrounding private timberland corroborated the extreme intensity of the tempest. The pressure of winds and waves on the Hood Canal Bridge stressed the structure enough to cause catastrophic failure. It is suspected that a severe list in the bridge exposed pontoon access hatches to the waves, which then tore the covers loose allowing water to enter the flotation devices, causing sections to sink. It took nearly three years and over $140 million to rebuild the bridge.

<text>Balfour Watson Currie, (November 1, 1902 – January 8, 1981) was a Canadian scientist specializing in the fields of meteorology and climatology.

== Early life ==
Born in Montana, he came to Saskatchewan at an early age. His parents moved to a farm homestead at Netherhill, near Kindersley, in the west central region of the province. Because of his pioneer heritage, he was equally comfortable with internationally renowned scientists or with farmers in the field. He came to the University of Saskatchewan as a student and received a Bachelor-level degree in Physics (1925) and a Master-level degree in Physics (1927). His Ph.D. program at McGill University was completed in 1930.

== Career ==
He was a staff member of the Department of Physics at the University of Saskatchewan (1928 - 1981), was Professor of Physics (1943–70) Head of the Department (1952–61), founder of the Institute of Space and Atmospheric Studies (1956–66), Dean of Graduate Studies (1959–70) and Vice-president, Research (1967–74). Upon his retirement as Vice-president, he was appointed by the President of the University to be Special Advisor in Research Matters (1974–78). Later in 1974, he became Canadian Coordinator of the International Magnetospheric Study, and gave it his fullest attention until its completion at the end of 1979. During this period, he also pursued an earlier research interest in the possible influence of solar activity on prairie weather and rainfall.

Early in his career, he spent two years in the Canadian Arctic. Currie and Frank Davies worked together at Chesterfield Inlet during the Second International Polar Year (1932-1933). An online archive of Currie&#x27;s work on 2nd IPY studies of the Polar Year data continued under his direction at the University of Saskatchewan after World War II.

== Recognition ==
In recognition of his outstanding contributions to his fields of study, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Meteorology Society of Great Britain in 1940, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1947. In 1967, he received the Patterson Medal from the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society. In 1972, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada &quot;for his services to science and education especially in the fields of meteorology and climatology&quot;.

In 1977 he received an honorary Doctor of Science (space research) from York University.

<text>KPR, originally known as Kodak Photoresist, is a photosensitive material used in photoengraving, Photogravure and photolithography. Once dried, KPR can be dissolved by several solvents. However, after exposure to strong ultraviolet light, it hardens and becomes insoluble by some of these solvents. It is also resistant to acid, ferric chloride and other chemicals used to etch metals.

The fundamental method of its use was first described in two US Patents, USP 2610120 and USP 2670287, assigned to the Eastman Kodak Company of Rochester, New York. These photo-resistant resins are formed from cinnamic acid esters, with the most preferable being polyvinyl cinnamate. While they were developed primarily for photolithography for high-speed print setting for uses such as newspaper printing, their perhaps highest value came from their ability to produce non-conducting layers on top of conducting layers to precise dimensions. This enabled the &quot;printing&quot; of large scale, closely placed conductive and non-conductive pathways to create binary gates. These were semi-conductors or the means to create semiconductors. This technology was utilized heavily by the Shockley 8, at the original Fairchild Semiconductor to produce more and more closely spaced semiconductors for computing. It is ironic that Kodak, the original patent assignee, did not really participate in the economic juggernaut that it created through this lithographic printing technology.

<text>USS &quot;Charles P. Cecil&quot; (DD/DDR-835) was a , the only ship of the United States Navy to be named after Rear Admiral Charles P. Cecil. She was launched on 22 April 1945 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. C. P. Cecil; and commissioned on 29 June 1945.

==Service history==
&quot;Charles P. Cecil&quot; arrived at San Diego, her home port, on 20 November 1945, and almost at once sailed on a tour of Pacific duty which found her operating as part of Joint Task Force One in the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, as well as supporting occupation forces with operations in Japanese waters. She returned to San Diego on 9 August 1946, and took part in exercises off the west coast until on 26 August 1947, when she cleared for her second deployment to the Far East. She touched at many Pacific islands as well as calling at ports in China, Japan and Okinawa before her return to San Diego on 5 May 1948.

Reclassified DDR-835 on 18 March 1949, &quot;Charles P. Cecil&quot; left San Diego astern on 4 April 1949, bound for Newport, Rhode Island, and assignment to the Atlantic Fleet. First from Newport, and from December 1950, from Norfolk, Virginia, &quot;Charles P. Cecil&quot; operated through 1960 with the Atlantic Fleet, taking part in midshipmen training cruises, periodic deployments to the Mediterranean, and the overhauls and refresher training necessary to maintain her readiness. She participated in a long list of NATO operations, in waters ranging from those north of the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean. Her tours of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean included one which coincided with the Suez Crisis of fall 1956, during which she took up watchful patrol in the eastern Mediterranean.

From January 1959, when she was fitted with highly complex electronic computational and tracking equipment, &quot;Charles P. Cecil&quot; concentrated on air defense experiments and exercises, contributing to the development of advanced techniques. Her training, however, continued to include the areas such as anti-submarine warfare and amphibious operations required of the versatile destroyer.

&quot;Charles P. Cecil&quot; participated in thirteen Mediterranean cruises, two Middle East cruises, and two Vietnam cruises; She was one of the first ships on the Cuban Quarantine Line in the fall of 1962, where she was the principal unit that challenged the B-36, a Foxtrot class Russian submarine and forced her to surface.

In 1963, &quot;Charles P. Cecil&quot; entered the New York Naval Shipyard for her FRAM I modernization. Her armament was optimised for anti-submarine warfare and she was redesignated DD-835 on 30 July 1963. Her yard period lasted until May 1964.

In July 1973 &quot;Charles P. Cecil&quot; was assigned to naval reserve squadron COMDESRON TWO EIGHT and homeported in New London, Connecticut.

==Greek service==

&quot;Charles P. Cecil&quot; was struck from the United States Navy&#x27;s rolls of fighting ships on 1 October 1979 and subsequently sold to Greece and renamed Apostolis (D216) on 8 August 1980. Named to honor the Naval Commander Nikolis Apostolis, who fought in the Greek War of Independence, she served with the Hellenic Navy until she was decommissioned in 1993. She was scrapped in March 2003.

<text>The blue poison dart frog or blue poison arrow frog (&quot;Dendrobates tinctorius&quot; &quot;azureus&quot;) is a poison dart frog found in the &quot;forest islands&quot; surrounded by the Sipaliwini Savanna in southern Suriname. Its indigenous Tiriyo name is &quot;okopipi&quot;. The name &quot;azureus&quot; comes from its azure blue color. While first described as a valid species and usually recognized as such in the past, recent authorities generally treat it as a morph of &quot;D. tinctorius&quot;, although a few treat it as a subspecies of &quot;D. tinctorius&quot; or continue to treat it as its own species. To what extent it differs from the blue &quot;D. tinctorius&quot; in southern Guyana, adjacent Pará (Brazil) and possibly far southwestern Suriname, is also a matter of dispute, and many herpetologists, as well as many people keeping poison dart frogs in captivity, have not distinguished these, with all commonly being identified as &quot;azureus&quot;.

==Description==
The blue poison dart frog is a medium-sized poison dart frog that weighs about and grows to in snout–vent length. Females are larger and on average about half a centimetre longer than males, but males have larger toes. Its bright blue skin, usually darker around its limbs and stomach, serves as a warning to predators. The glands of poisonous alkaloids located in the skin serve as a defence mechanism to potential predators. The black spots are unique to each frog, enabling individuals to be identified. In addition to differing in color, blue poison dart frogs also tend to have a distinctive hunch-backed posture and a relatively smaller, more oval (less round) tympanum than in other variants of dyeing poison dart frog. Each foot has four toes, which each have a flattened tip with a suction cup pad used for gripping. The tips of the toes in females are round, while males have heart-shaped tips.

Their tadpoles have a long tail, about 6 mm, with a total length of around 10 mm. They lack legs and have gills instead of lungs.

==Behavior==


The blue poison dart frog is a terrestrial animal, but, as an amphibian, stays close to water sources. These frogs spend most of their active hours hopping around in short leaps, looking for insects. They are very territorial and aggressive, towards both their own species and others, much like other poison dart frogs. To ward off intruders, they use a series of calls, chases, and wrestling.

Although poison dart frogs are known for their skin toxins used on the tips of hunting-arrows of natives, in reality only the species of the genus &quot;Phyllobates&quot; are used in this manner. In nature, poison dart frogs consume specific insects, such as small beetles or ants, which contain formic acid (among other alkaloids), which the frogs are able to metabolize and retain as a defense mechanism. Thus, all captive and captive-bred dart frog specimens, including wild-collected individuals, lose their toxicity as a result of a change in diet.

==Reproduction==
The blue poison dart frog breeds seasonally, usually during February or March when the weather is rainy. To find mates, the males sit on a rock and produce quiet calls, which the females follow to track down the males. The females then physically fight over a male. The male takes the female to a quiet place by the water, which becomes the site of the egg-laying. Fertilization occurs externally; once the eggs are laid, the male covers them in his sperm.

Between five and ten offspring are produced at each mating. Eggs are laid in the male&#x27;s territory, which he defends. The male takes care of the eggs, sometimes joined by the female. The eggs hatch after 14 to 18 days, and after 10 to 12 weeks the tadpoles are fully mature. Both sexes reach sexual maturity at two years of age. The expected lifespan of &quot;D. tinctorius&quot; &quot;azureus&quot; is between 4 and 6 years in the wild and about 10 years in captivity.

==Feeding==
The blue poison dart frog feeds on fire ants and insects which may have poisonous chemical which makes the blue poison dart frog poisonous. Other than that it also feeds on beetles, flies, mites, spiders, termites, maggots, and caterpillars.

==Captive care==
In captivity, like most captive dart frogs, they eat a staple diet of fruit flies, pinhead crickets, rice flour beetle larvae, isopods, and springtails.

<doc id="1202432" wikidata="Q6553497" url="?curid=1202432" title="Linear range">
<text>The linear range is that range of input or output values for which an electronic amplifier produces an output signal that is a direct, linear function of the input signal. That is, the output can be represented by the equation:

:&quot;Output&quot; = &quot;Input&quot; × &quot;Gain&quot;

When operating in the linear range, no clipping occurs. If an amplifier were perfectly linear, no distortion (harmonic distortion or intermodulation distortion) would occur (although random noise may still be introduced).

Vacuum tube amplifiers tend to exhibit soft clipping; as they approach the maximum possible output value, the gain tends to drop, rounding the tops of the signal waveform. Transistor amplifiers, by comparison, tend to produce hard clipping; the gain remains approximately the same until the maximum possible output voltage is reached; at that point, hard clipping occurs and the waveform never exceeds that value. The sharp inflection points thus produced in the output waveform tend to have many more high-order harmonics. This is alleged to be the basis of the &quot;transistor sound&quot; that some audiophiles find offensive (although this would not have occurred if they would not have been driving their amplifiers beyond the linear range in the first place).

<doc id="1202436" wikidata="Q5135753" url="?curid=1202436" title="Cloudland Canyon State Park">
<text>Cloudland Canyon State Park is a Georgia state park located near Trenton and Cooper Heights on the western edge of Lookout Mountain. One of the largest and most scenic parks in Georgia, it contains rugged geology, and offers visitors a range of vistas across the deep gorge cut through the mountain by Sitton Gulch Creek, where the elevation varies from 800 to over 1,800 feet. Views of the canyon can be seen from the picnic area parking lot, in addition to additional views located along the rim trail. At the bottom of the gorge, two waterfalls cascade across layers of sandstone and shale, ending in small pools below.

The park, previously known as Sitton Gulch (or Gulf) or Trenton Gulf, was purchased in stages by the state of Georgia beginning in 1938. Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a project of Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression built the first facilities and signs in the park, which opened the following year. Today the park features a variety of campsites, cabins, hiking and recreational activities.

==History==
Cloudland Canyon was designated a state park in 1939 when the state began acquiring land from private owners. Three of these owners, from the Mathews, McCauley and McKaig families, still reside in the area. Expansion of the park continues sporadically as new land is purchased for it. The park was originally , and has been expanded to its present size of .

Until 1939 the only access to the area (and much of Dade County, Georgia) was through Tennessee or Alabama. That year, Georgia began work on Highway 136 to connect U.S. 41 to the recently established park. The Civilian Conservation Corps did much of the early work to construct the state park and access roads.

==Geology==

The park is located on the Cumberland Plateau, atop Lookout Mountain. On the summit of Lookout Mountain, the waters of Daniel Creek and Bear Creek cut gorges through the rock, converging to form Sitton Gulch Creek. The flat-topped mountains of the Cumberland Plateau are significantly different from the narrow Armuchee ridges beyond nearby Chickamauga Valley to the east. From a geological standpoint, Lookout Mountain is transitional between the flat-lying sedimentary beds of central Tennessee, and the ridges and valley to the east, which display more intensive folding and faulting. Most of the canyon&#x27;s rock formations consist of sandstone; shale layers below the sandstone are marked by pine trees.

Lookout Mountain was created through a combination of tectonic activity and erosion. It was uplifted during the period of mountain building that formed the Appalachians, known as the Appalachian orogeny. Over 200 million years ago, the modern-day parklands lay beneath an ocean. When first formed, the entire mountain was underwater, but the rim of the canyon eventually became a beach along the edge of the receding ocean. As the ocean dried up, Sitton Gulch Creek and its tributaries, particularly Daniel Creek, eroded the rock. The sandstone forming the bluffs has a tendency to fracture into blocks, creating unusual boulder formations. The concave shape of the top of Lookout Mountain also drains rainwater through fissures into the underlying limestone, forming miles of caves in the area.

The canyon is more than deep, ranging in elevation from to over ; the park&#x27;s peak elevation is . The bottom of Cloudland canyon contains a slope of rock talus, which are sandstone and shale fragments. The valley floor is also rich in fossil-bearing limestone.

==Hiking trails==
The Park contains several well-marked trails which allow visitors to view the geology of the canyon and its surroundings. A paved, wheelchair-accessible trail about long overlooks the rim of the canyon. The park also features four more extensive hiking trails, including one backpacking trail. These trails are generally considered moderate in difficulty.

The Waterfalls Trail begins on a paved section, at the main overlook, and progresses into the canyon along a 40-degree slope. Most of the trail consists of gravel, and a 600-step staircase. Each waterfall emanates from Daniel Creek, and both cascade down sheer faces at and . The trail is generally considered to be a strenuous hike, which can take up to 90 minutes to complete. Cherokee Falls is from the trailhead; Hemlock Falls, at the bottom of the canyon, appears at . Each cascades into small pools at the base of the canyon, and continue down through a boulder-strewn stream bed. The creek flow feeding the waterfalls varies considerably according to the season. The Sitton&#x27;s Gulch trail, commencing at the bottom of the Waterfalls Trail, runs parallel to the creek until it ends in a parking area in Trenton.

In contrast, the long West Rim Loop Trail is rated as moderately difficult, although it contains a few short, steep rocky sections. A scenic hike beginning at the Daniels Creek Bridge, it offers panoramic views before climbing out of the canyon and onto the plateau. This trail also provides views of Trenton, Georgia, neighboring Sand Mountain, and of Cloudland Canyon. Rhododendron and mountain laurel thickets are interspersed with sour gum and dogwood; large oaks, hickories, hemlocks and maples shade the trail. Cottages and walk-in camping areas are accessible via the West Rim Loop. Passing over varied terrain, most of the hike is moderately difficult, and is considered strenuous along several short sections.

The Backcountry Loop Trail provides access to the park&#x27;s eleven secluded primitive hike-in camping sites. Beginning at the parking area for group camping, the trail passes through hemlock groves, before descending on a moderate grade into a hollow filled with spring and summer flowers. At the far end of the loop, hikers emerge from the hemlock groves onto level trail, among oaks and hickories, before returning to the parking area.

In the fall of 2011, the park reopened the Bear Creek Trail, which had been closed to hikers for nearly a decade. This approximately trail is the longest trail in the park. This trail begins as a spur off of the Back Country Trail and drops down to Bear Creek. After crossing the creek, the trail continues up until it becomes a loop around the northeast portion of the park. Around the area of the creek, the trail crosses over private property for a brief distance. During wet seasons, the creek crossing can be difficult as there is no bridge or dry crossing available.

In 2023, the 34 mile long River to Clouds trail was announced, connecting Cloudland Canyon State Park to St. Elmo in Chattanooga.

==Facilities and activities==
Cloudland Canyon State park features a variety of camping and lodging options. There are 16 rental cottages as well as a group lodge. The park also offers 62 tent, trailer and RV sites, 28 walk-in camp sites, and 10 backcountry camp sites for backpackers. Four pioneer campsites provide facilities for groups of tent campers. The East Rim has 24 camp sites located along a loop road; many of the sites can accommodate RVs, and all feature water and electric hookups. Bathing facilities are located nearby. The West Rim Camp ground, located across the gorge and away from the park&#x27;s busiest section, is located in thick forest, and hosts approximately 48 camp sites spread along two loops. It too offers bathing facilities.

Picnic areas include a group pavilion, tennis courts, a children&#x27;s playground and a disc golf course. The park has an interpretive center near the main parking lot, adjacent to the canyon. Annual events hosted in the park include a Wildflower Program in April, Adventure Weekend (also in April), and a Kids&#x27; Catfish Rodeo in May.

<doc id="1202443" wikidata="Q277882" url="?curid=1202443" title="Mr. Plow">
<text>&quot;Mr. Plow&quot; is the ninth episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 19, 1992. In the episode, Homer buys a snowplow and starts a business plowing driveways as &quot;Mr. Plow&quot;. It is a huge success and, inspired by this, Barney Gumble starts a rival company as the &quot;Plow King&quot; and quickly puts Homer out of business.

The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Jim Reardon. The episode was well received, with some critics calling it one of the best in the show&#x27;s history.

Dan Castellaneta won his second consecutive Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Voice-Over Performance&quot; for this episode (Castellaneta performs the voice of both Homer and Barney in the series). The episode was also submitted in the &quot;Outstanding Comedy Series&quot; category although ultimately it was not nominated.

==Plot==
After crashing into Marge&#x27;s car on a snowy night, Homer has to purchase a replacement car. The Simpsons go to a car show where a salesman convinces Homer to buy a pickup truck mounted with a snowplow by saying Homer can make the payments by plowing people&#x27;s driveways. Homer starts a plowing business called Mr. Plow but has trouble finding customers until Lisa suggests recording a commercial and airing it on public television. The resulting commercial attracts many customers and the business becomes highly successful. Homer is given the key to the city in recognition of his service.

Barney, envious of Homer&#x27;s success, starts a rival business called Plow King. Barney advertises his business with a commercial featuring a jingle sung by Linda Ronstadt. Homer pays an agency to make him a new commercial, but the new commercial is perplexing and does not sufficiently advertise Homer&#x27;s business. As a result, Barney becomes much more successful than Homer. Mayor Quimby revokes Homer&#x27;s key to the city and gives it to Barney.

To get revenge on Barney and revitalize his own business, Homer tricks Barney into plowing a non-existent driveway on Widow&#x27;s Peak, a large, treacherous mountain outside of town. After a day of successfully plowing Springfield citizens&#x27; driveways, Homer sees a news report that says Barney is trapped in an avalanche on Widow&#x27;s Peak. Feeling guilty and fearful for Barney&#x27;s life, Homer drives to the mountain and rescues Barney. Barney and Homer reconcile and agree to become business partners. However, after Homer says, &quot;When two best friends work together, not even God himself can stop them!&quot;, an angered God promptly retaliates by increasing the outside temperature, melting all the snow and effectively putting both Homer and Barney out of business. Since Homer can no longer make the snowplow payments, his plow is repossessed, but he keeps the Mr. Plow jacket to wear to bed because he knows it arouses Marge.

==Production==

When the episode was being written, many writers&#x27; contracts had expired, so some writers were not at the annual story retreat. Al Jean was very nervous about how they could write a whole new season with such a small crew. In addition, there were several scenes added after the animatic, making the schedule even tighter. However, Jon Vitti was very committed to this episode and pitched almost the entire plot by himself.

It was Vitti&#x27;s idea to have Adam West at the car show, as he wanted to finally meet him. The other writers agreed because they were all big fans of &quot;Batman&quot; as children and also wanted to meet West. Matt Groening said that West was one of the most popular people to ever come to the studio. Linda Ronstadt was recorded in San Francisco. Vitti was tasked with recording Ronstadt, and enjoyed it immensely. He said the most beautiful thing he has ever heard is Ronstadt singing the Spanish Plow King jingle.

Two more script changes that put extra pressure on the episode were a post-animatic rewrite and a complete character change. In the original script for the episode, Lenny was going to be Homer&#x27;s rival, the Plow King. The idea was quickly dropped because it did not seem to fit in. The post-animatic rewrite was to include the joke in which Homer uses the radio dial to tip the precariously balanced plow back onto the road. This joke was pitched by Conan O&#x27;Brien, and the writers liked it so much that they added it to the episode.

The &quot;Simpsons&quot; team encountered trouble with the network censors in the scene where Homer answers the phone and pretends to be Tony Dow from &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;. After a brief pause, Homer replies to an inquiry by the person on the phone with &quot;Yeah, they were gay.&quot; The censors refused to allow the line to be aired, fearing legal recourse for libel. The &quot;Simpsons&quot; crew protested, arguing that no one in particular was being implied, and that the &quot;they&quot; could be anybody. After numerous phone calls and arguments, the censors allowed the joke to air.

The &quot;Carnival of the Stars&quot; show seen at the start of the episode is a parody of &quot;Circus of the Stars&quot;, an annual special that aired on CBS from 1976 to 1994, which featured celebrities performing circus acts. Troy McClure is broadcasting from Molokai, adding &quot;It&#x27;s not just for lepers anymore!&quot; &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; contains several references that Al Jean called &quot;very obscure&quot;. In the scene of Kent Brockman reporting Barney&#x27;s accident, his attire (including glasses) and facial expressions are similar to Walter Cronkite&#x27;s when reporting the Kennedy assassination. The scene where Homer drives over a rickety bridge in the mountains is a parody of a climactic scene from William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (1977), including music similar to Tangerine Dream&#x27;s score for the film.

The lyrics and melody of the original Mr. Plow jingle, &quot;Call Mr. Plow, that&#x27;s my name, that name again is Mr. Plow!&quot;, are based on the Roto-Rooter jingle, &quot;Call Roto-Rooter, that&#x27;s the name, and away go troubles down the drain.&quot; The revamped Mr. Plow commercial is a parody of a similar perfume commercial that aired at the time of the episode&#x27;s production. The fast-moving clouds were taken from the documentary &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;. The music in the commercial was a Russian recording of &quot;Casta Diva&quot; from Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;. At the time the episode was made, Russia did not abide by American copyright laws and America did not respect Russia&#x27;s copyright laws, so they would not have to pay to use the recording. The shattered snowglobe is an allusion to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941).

Adam West plays himself and is first seen signing autographs at a car show. When West says he is Batman and worked with Robin, Bart says he doesn&#x27;t know who Robin is, and West goes on a tangent about how he was disappointed by the newer Batman movies where the actor suited up with prosthetic chests. Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s desire to record a Spanish version of the Plow King jingle, along with her mariachi costume in Barney&#x27;s commercial, are references to her recording several popular Spanish-language albums celebrating the music of Mexico, beginning with &quot;Canciones de Mi Padre&quot;. The McMahon &amp; Tate advertising firm is a reference to &quot;Bewitched&quot;. The scene of Barney&#x27;s gradual descent into a drunk is a parody of the transformation sequence in &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1941). The scene of Bart being pelted with snowballs is a reference to the Sonny Corleone tollbooth shooting scene in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972). When Moe offers free beer to Homer, Barney mentions that he hadn&#x27;t done that for the Iranian hostages. The snowmen melting during the heatwave is a reference to the melting Nazis at the end of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; finished 23rd in ratings for the week of November 16–22, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.6, equivalent to approximately 13.6 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating &quot;Married... with Children&quot;.

In 1993, Dan Castellaneta won an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Voice-Over Performance&quot; for his performance as Homer in this episode. It was his second consecutive Emmy, as he had also won in the same category the previous year. In 1993, &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; and &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot; were submitted for the Primetime Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Comedy Series&quot;. The &quot;Simpsons&quot;&#x27; staff had previously submitted episodes for &quot;Outstanding Animated Program&quot;, winning twice, but that season they took a chance with the main comedy category. However, the Emmy voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; did not receive a nomination. The &quot;Simpsons&quot;&#x27; crew submitted episodes for Outstanding Comedy Series the next season, but again these were not nominated. Since then, the show has submitted episodes in the animation category and has won eight times.

In 2003, the episode was placed sixth on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s top 25 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode list. In June 2009, Robert Canning of &quot;IGN&quot; gave the episode a score of 9.8 out of 10 and said it was &quot;a fantastic episode that told an engaging story and was laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish. [...] There was a fun, engaging story, great guest stars poking fun at themselves, flashbacks, songs, cutaways and opportunities to highlight characters outside the series&#x27; namesake family.&quot;

In January 2010, Michael Moran of &quot;The Times&quot; ranked the episode as the second best in the show&#x27;s history. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, enjoyed the episode. They said that it is: &quot;A good one. The highlights; the TV show &quot;Carnival of Stars&quot;, featuring Angela Lansbury walking on hot coals (&#x27;Excitement, she wrote!&#x27;), Homer&#x27;s flashback to all he&#x27;s done for Barney, and best of all, the McMahon &amp; Tate ad agency&#x27;s arty commercial for Mr. Plow.&quot; In June 2012, Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated that the episode &quot;isn&#x27;t just spectacularly funny and filled with classic bits: it also foretells the future. Not bad for an animated cartoon from the 1990s.&quot;

When asked to pick his favourite season out of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; seasons one through twenty, Paul Lane of the &quot;Niagara Gazette&quot; picked season four and highlighted &quot;Brother from the Same Planet&quot; and &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; which he called &quot;excellent&quot;, along with &quot;the sweetly funny&quot; &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot;, and &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot;. The episode&#x27;s reference to &quot;The Godfather&quot; was named the 37th greatest film reference in the history of the show by &quot;Total Film&quot;&#x27;s Nathan Ditum. Ditum also ranked West&#x27;s performance as the seventh-best guest appearance in the show&#x27;s history.

When &quot;The Simpsons&quot; began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service.

==Legacy==
On December 17, 2015, Google and YouTube modernized the episode and its &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; jingle for use in a commercial in which Lisa uses the website on her computer to place Homer&#x27;s advertisement onto its YouTube campaign.

<doc id="1202452" wikidata="Q1419887" url="?curid=1202452" title="Piper PA-38 Tomahawk">
<text>The Piper PA-38-112 Tomahawk is a two-seat, fixed tricycle gear general aviation airplane, originally designed for flight training, touring and personal use.

==Design and development==
The Tomahawk is a single-engined low-wing cantilever monoplane with a T-tail and an enclosed cabin for two. It has a fixed tricycle landing gear and is powered by a Lycoming O-235 four-cylinder piston engine with a twin-bladed tractor propeller. The Tomahawk has two front-hinged doors for access to the cabin.

The Tomahawk was Piper&#x27;s attempt at creating an affordable two-place trainer. Before designing the aircraft, Piper widely surveyed flight instructors for their input into the design. Instructors requested a more spinnable aircraft for training purposes, since other two-place trainers such as the Cessna 150 and 152 were designed to spontaneously fly out of a spin. The Tomahawk&#x27;s NASA GA(W)-1 Whitcomb airfoil addresses this requirement by making specific pilot input necessary in recovering from spins, thus allowing pilots to develop proficiency in dealing with spin recovery.

The Tomahawk was introduced in 1977 as a 1978 model. The aircraft was in continuous production until 1982 when production ended, with 2,484 aircraft built.

The 1981 and 1982 models were designated as the Tomahawk II. They incorporated improved cabin heating and windshield defroster performance, an improved elevator trim system, improved engine thrust vector, 100% airframe zinc-chromate anti-corrosion treatment, better cockpit soundproofing, larger 6&quot; wheels and tires for greater propeller ground clearance and improved performance on grass and dirt runways, among other enhancements.

== Operational history ==
As of 2020, a handful of Tomahawks are currently being used to train Australian Air Force Cadets in flight courses. These are operated from RAAF Base Amberley by 211 Squadron AAFC. These aircraft have been in service since the early 2000s.
=== Safety record ===
According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Air Safety Foundation, which published a &quot;Safety Highlight&quot; report on the Piper Tomahawk, the Piper Tomahawk has a one-third lower accident rate per flying hour than the comparable Cessna 150/152 series of two-place benchmark trainers. The Tomahawk has a higher rate of fatal spin accidents per flying hour. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) estimated that the Tomahawk&#x27;s stall/spin accident rate was three to five times that of the Cessna 150/152.

According to the NTSB, the Tomahawk&#x27;s wing design was modified after FAA certification tests, but was not retested. Changes included reducing the number of full wing ribs and cutting lightening holes in the main spar. The aircraft&#x27;s engineers told the NTSB that the changes made to the design resulted in a wing that was soft and flexible, allowing its shape to become distorted and possibly causing unpredictable behavior in stalls and spins. The design engineers said that the GAW-1 airfoil required a rigid structure because it was especially sensitive to airfoil shape, and that use of a flexible surface with that airfoil would make the Tomahawk wing &quot;a new and unknown commodity in stalls and spins.&quot;

Airworthiness Directive 83-14-08 issued in September 1983 mandated an additional pair of stall strips to be added to the inboard leading edge of the PA-38 wing to &quot;standardize and improve the stall characteristics&quot;.

<text>Crooked River State Park is a Georgia state park located near St. Mary&#x27;s on the south bank of the Crooked River, providing an excellent coastal setting. The park is dedicated to the preservation of its natural resources and public education. The park is near the ruins of the McIntosh Sugarworks, built around 1825 and used as a starch factory during the American Civil War. It is the closest state park to Cumberland Island National Seashore and it is adjacent to the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay.

==History==
The earliest residents of Crooked River State Park were the Guale and the Timucua Indians who were pushed out and moved southward in the 1700s. Once a Royal Land Grant, Crooked River State Park was confiscated at the end of the revolution and owned by Robert Montfort. In 1792, Alexander Elliot purchased the area of the park known today as Elliott’s Bluff. Records indicate in 1824, John H. McIntosh owned Mush Bluff, south of the park and Elliot’s Bluff. Evidence of this plantation era and earlier times remain on the park’s grounds including old bottles, planted pines, and oyster shell middens found along marsh edge on east side of park. The unofficial opening day of Crooked River State Park was March 27, 1947.

<text>Peter Whelan (3 October 1931 – 3 July 2014) was a British playwright.

Whelan was born and raised in Stoke-on-Trent, England. As a student from 1951–55 Whelan was an inspirational figure in the newly-formed Drama Society at the experimental University College of North Staffordshire, later Keele University. At Keele he met his wife Frangcon Price, who also excelled in drama as a student and in her later career. They married in 1958.

His works includes seven plays for the Royal Shakespeare Company, most of which are period pieces based on real historical events. The first of these was &quot;Captain Swing&quot; in 1979. Another was &quot;The Herbal Bed&quot;, about a court case involving William Shakespeare&#x27;s daughter. It was first produced at the RSC&#x27;s The Other Place theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in 1996 and was revived at The Duchess Theatre from April to October 1997.

In 2008, his play &quot;The School of Night&quot;, originally produced at The Other Place theatre, in November 1992, made its US debut at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. It fictionalizes the relationships between Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd and Sir Walter Raleigh as well as the events leading up to Marlowe&#x27;s death.

In January 2018, his play &quot;Sleepers in the Field&quot; had its world premiere at The Questors Theatre, in Ealing, London.

Important papers of his are stored in the Borthwick Institute for Archives in the Library of the University of York.

<text>MySQL Cluster , also known as MySQL Ndb Cluster is a technology providing shared-nothing clustering and auto-sharding for the MySQL database management system. It is designed to provide high availability and high throughput with low latency, while allowing for near linear scalability. MySQL Cluster is implemented through the NDB or NDBCLUSTER storage engine for MySQL (&quot;NDB&quot; stands for Network Database).

==Architecture==
MySQL Cluster is designed around a distributed, multi-master ACID compliant architecture with no single point of failure. MySQL Cluster uses automatic sharding (partitioning) to scale out read and write operations on commodity hardware and can be accessed via SQL and Non-SQL (NoSQL) APIs.

===Replication===
Internally MySQL Cluster uses synchronous replication through a two-phase commit mechanism in order to guarantee that data is written to multiple nodes upon committing the data. Two copies (known as &quot;replicas&quot;) of the data are required to guarantee availability. MySQL Cluster automatically creates “node groups” from the number of replicas and data nodes specified by the user. Updates are synchronously replicated between members of the node group to protect against data loss and support fast failover between nodes. Cluster replication differs from &quot;MySQL Replication&quot;, which is instead .

It is also possible to replicate asynchronously between clusters; this is sometimes referred to as &quot;MySQL Cluster Replication&quot; or &quot;geographical replication&quot;. This is typically used to replicate clusters between data centers for IT disaster recovery or to reduce the effects of network latency by locating data physically closer to a set of users. Unlike standard MySQL replication, MySQL Cluster&#x27;s geographic replication uses optimistic concurrency control and the concept of Epochs to provide a mechanism for conflict detection and resolution, enabling active/active clustering between data centers.

Starting with MySQL Cluster 7.2, support for synchronous replication between data centers was supported with the Multi-Site Clustering feature.

===Horizontal data partitioning (auto-sharding)===
MySQL Cluster is implemented as a fully distributed multi-master database ensuring updates made by any application or SQL node are instantly available to all of the other nodes accessing the cluster, and each data node can accept write operations.

Data within MySQL Cluster (NDB) tables is automatically partitioned across all of the data nodes in the system. This is done based on a hashing algorithm based on the primary key on the table, and is transparent to the end application. Clients can connect to any node in the cluster and have queries automatically access the correct shards needed to satisfy a query or commit a transaction. MySQL Cluster is able to support cross-shard queries and transactions.

Users can define their own partitioning schemes. This allows developers to add “distribution awareness” to applications by partitioning based on a sub-key that is common to all rows being accessed by high running transactions. This ensures that data used to complete transactions is localized on the same shard, thereby reducing network hops.

===Hybrid storage===
MySQL Cluster allows datasets larger than the capacity of a single machine to be stored and accessed across multiple machines.
MySQL Cluster maintains all indexed columns in distributed memory. Non-indexed columns can also be maintained in distributed memory or can be maintained on disk with an in-memory page cache. Storing non-indexed columns on disk allows MySQL Cluster to store datasets larger than the aggregate memory of the clustered machines.

MySQL Cluster writes Redo logs to disk for all data changes as well as check pointing data to disk regularly. This allows the cluster to consistently recover from disk after a full cluster outage. As the Redo logs are written asynchronously with respect to transaction commit, some small number of transactions can be lost if the full cluster fails, however this can be mitigated by using geographic replication or multi-site cluster discussed above. The current default asynchronous write delay is 2 seconds, and is configurable. Normal single point of failure scenarios do not result in any data loss due to the synchronous data replication within the cluster.

When a MySQL Cluster table is maintained in memory, the cluster will only access disk storage to write Redo records and checkpoints. As these writes are sequential and limited random access patterns are involved, MySQL Cluster can achieve higher write throughput rates with limited disk hardware compared to a traditional disk-based caching RDBMS. This checkpointing to disk of in-memory table data can be disabled (on a per-table basis) if disk-based persistence isn&#x27;t needed.

===Shared nothing===
MySQL Cluster is designed to have no single point of failure. Provided that the cluster is set up correctly, any single node, system, or piece of hardware can fail without the entire cluster failing. Shared disk (SAN) is not required. The interconnects between nodes can be standard Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand, or SCI interconnects.

===SQL and NoSQL APIs===
As MySQL Cluster stores tables in data nodes, rather than in the MySQL Server, there are multiple interfaces available to access the database:

* SQL access via the MySQL Server
* NoSQL APIs where MySQL Cluster libraries can be embedded into an application to provide direct access to the data nodes without passing through a SQL layer. These include:
** Memcached
** Node.js / JavaScript
** Java and JPA 
** HTTP / REST
** NDB API (C++)

===MySQL Cluster Manager===
Part of the commercial MySQL Cluster CGE, MySQL Cluster Manager is a tool designed to simplify the creation and administration of the MySQL Cluster CGE database by automating common management tasks, including on-line scaling, upgrades, backup/restore and reconfiguration. MySQL Cluster Manager also monitors and automatically recovers MySQL Server application nodes and management nodes, as well as the MySQL Cluster data nodes.

===MySQL Ndb Operator===
The open source MySQL Ndb Operator simplifies the deployment and operation of MySQL Cluster on a Kubernetes cluster. Ndb Operator deploys containerized MySQL Cluster Data, Management and SQL nodes in a number of StatefulSets with data stored in Persistent Volumes.
Kubernetes mechanisms extend the high availability features of MySQL Cluster, for example automatically restoring HA redundancy after hardware failures by migrating pods to new hardware.
Operating MySQL Cluster on Kubernetes allows a full stack of cloud native software to be operated in the same way on private or public clouds.

===NDB Cluster===
NDB Cluster is the distributed database system underlying MySQL Cluster. It can be used independently of a MySQL Server with users accessing the Cluster via the NDB API (C++). &quot;NDB&quot; stands for Network Database.

From the MySQL Server perspective the NDB Cluster is a Storage engine for storing tables of rows. 

From the NDB Cluster perspective, a MySQL Server instance is an API process connected to the Cluster. NDB Cluster can concurrently support access from other types of API processes including Memcached, JavaScript/Node.JS, Java, JPA and HTTP/REST. All API processes can operate on the same tables and data stored in the NDB Cluster.

MySQL Cluster uses the MySQL Server to provide the following capabilities on top of Ndb Cluster:

* SQL parsing / optimising / execution capability
** Connectors to applications via JDBC, ODBC etc.
* Cross-table join mechanism
* User authentication and authorisation
* Asynchronous data replication to other systems

All API processes including the MySQL Server use the NDBAPI C++ client library to connect to the NDB Cluster and perform operations.

==Implementation==
MySQL Cluster uses three different types of nodes (processes) :
* Data node (ndbd/ndbmtd process): These nodes store the data. Tables are automatically sharded across the data nodes which also transparently handle load balancing, replication, failover and self-healing.
* Management node (ndb_mgmd process): Used for configuration and monitoring of the cluster. They are required only to start or restart a cluster node. They can also be configured as arbitrators, but this is not mandatory (MySQL Servers can be configured as arbitrators instead).
* Application node or SQL node (mysqld process): A MySQL server (mysqld) that connects to all of the data nodes in order to perform data storage and retrieval. This node type is optional; it is possible to query data nodes directly via the NDB API, either natively using the C++ API or one of the additional NoSQL APIs described above.

Generally, it is expected that each node will run on a separate physical host, VM or cloud instance (although it is very common to co-locate Management Nodes with MySQL Servers). For best practice, it is recommended not to co-locate nodes within the same node group on a single physical host (as that would represent a single point of failure).

== Versions ==
From the 8.0 release onwards, MySQL Cluster is based directly on the corresponding releases of the MySQL Server. Previously, MySQL Cluster version numbers were decoupled from those of MySQL Server - for example MySQL Cluster 7.6 was based on/contained the server component from MySQL 5.7.

For evaluation purposes, it is possible to run MySQL Cluster on a single physical server. For production deployments, the minimum system requirements are for 3 x instances / hosts:
* 2 × Data Nodes
* 1 × Application / Management Node
or

* 2 × Data Node + Application
* 1 × Management Node

Configurations as follows:
* OS: Linux, Solaris, Windows. macOS (for development only)
* CPU: Intel/AMD x86/x86-64, UltraSPARC
* Memory: 1GB
* HDD: 3GB
* Network: 1+ nodes (Standard Ethernet - TCP/IP)

Tips and recommendations on deploying highly performant, production grade clusters can be found in the MySQL Cluster Evaluation Guide and the Guide to Optimizing Performance of the MySQL Cluster Database.

==History==
MySQL AB acquired the technology behind MySQL Cluster from Alzato, a small venture company started by Ericsson. NDB was originally designed for the telecom market, with its high availability and high performance requirements.

MySQL Cluster based on the NDB storage engine has since been integrated into the MySQL product, with its first release being in MySQL 4.1.

<text>Arnold Davidson Dunton, (July 4, 1912 – February 7, 1987) was a Canadian educator and public administrator, from 1943 to 1958 chairman of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

==Early life and career==
He was educated at the High School of Montreal and Lower Canada College, Montréal, completing his secondary education at the age of fifteen. Too young to attend a Canadian university, for four years he travelled and attended courses in France, Britain, and Germany. On his return, he worked as a reporter on the &quot;Montreal Star&quot;. He was the paper&#x27;s associate editor, 1937–38, and was editor of its sister paper the Montréal &quot;Saturday Standard&quot; in 1938. He joined the Wartime Information Board in 1942 and was general manager 1944-45. In late 1945, at age 33, he was appointed the first full-time chairman of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).

Throughout the controversies that arose over the funding and regulation of the new medium of television, Dunton was a persuasive defender of the corporation&#x27;s independence and a strong advocate of the need to fund publicly a television system. Shortly after the CBC completed its network from coast to coast in July 1958, he resigned and became president of Carleton University. His post as CBC chairman was replaced by Alphonse Ouimet. Dunton was widely commended for the tact and intelligence with which he had overseen the development of CBC television. Marc Thibault who directed the News and Public Affairs (1968-1981) at Société Radio-Canada (CBC French Network), built on Davidson Dunton&#x27;s vision to bring qualitative and quantitative rigour (formative and summative evaluation) in assessing coast-to-coast equity and content impartiality, especially during federal and provincial elections.

He was appointed by Prime Minister Lester Pearson co-chairman, (with André Laurendeau), of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in 1963, which has profoundly influenced federal government language policies. He stepped down as Carleton&#x27;s president in 1972 to become director of the Institute of Canadian Studies at Carleton (1973–78) and later fellow of the Institute. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada and received honorary diplomas from seven Canadian universities. The Dunton Tower at Carleton University is named in his honour.

<text>The University of Michigan Law School (branded as Michigan Law) is the law school of the University of Michigan, a public research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Founded in 1859, the school offers Master of Laws (LLM), Master of Comparative Law (MCL), Juris Doctor (JD), and Doctor of the Science of Law (SJD) degree programs.

Notable alumni include U.S. Supreme Court Justices Frank Murphy, William Rufus Day, and George Sutherland, as well as a number of heads of state and corporate executives. Approximately 98% of Class of 2022 graduates were employed within ten months of graduation; its first time bar passage rate in 2023 was 95.45% and the passage rate for all graduates within two years was 99.20%.

The school enrolls about 976 students and employs about 107 full-time faculty members and 76 non-full time faculty members.

==History==
The law school was founded in 1859. By 1870, it was the largest law school in the country.

In 1870, Gabriel Franklin Hargo graduated from Michigan Law as the second African American to graduate from law school in the United States. In 1871 Sarah Killgore, a Michigan Law graduate, became the first woman to both graduate from law school and be admitted to the bar.

Although the law school is part of the public University of Michigan, less than 2% of the law school&#x27;s expenses are covered by state funds. The remainder (97–98% of Michigan Law&#x27;s budget) is supplied by private gifts, tuition, and endowments.

In 2009, Michigan Law began a $102 million enterprise to construct a new law building that would remain loyal to the English Gothic style. The enterprise was fully funded by endowments and private gifts. 2009 also marked the school&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebration. As a part of the festivities, Chief Justice John Roberts visited the school and participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for the new building. The building was dedicated in 2012 and called South Hall. In December 2018, South Hall was renamed Jeffries Hall, after a record $33 million donation from real estate developer Christopher M. Jeffries.

== Academics ==

=== Rankings ===
Michigan Law was ranked third in the initial &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; law school rankings in 1987. Michigan Law is also one of the &quot;T14&quot; law schools, schools that have consistently been ranked in the top 14 since U.S. News began publishing rankings. In the 2021 &quot;U.S. News&quot; ranking, Michigan Law is ranked 9th overall. Michigan Law ranked 15th among U.S. law schools, tied with the Georgetown University Law Center, for the number of times its tenured faculty&#x27;s published scholarship was highly cited in legal journals during the period 2010 through 2014.

=== Admissions ===
Admission to Michigan Law is highly selective. For the class entering in the fall of 2021, 819 applicants were accepted out of a total of 7,693, an acceptance rate of 10.65%. Out of those 819 accepted applicants, 313 students enrolled. The 25th and 75th LSAT percentiles for the 2021 entering class were 166 and 172, respectively, with a median of 171. The 25th and 75th undergraduate GPA percentiles were 3.61 and 3.93, respectively, with a median of 3.84.

==Campus==


Built between 1924 and 1933 by the architectural firm York and Sawyer with funds donated by attorney and alumnus William W. Cook, the Cook Law Quadrangle comprises four buildings:

*Hutchins Hall, the main academic building, named for former Dean of the Law School and President of the University, Harry Burns Hutchins
*The Legal Research Building
*John P. Cook Dormitory
*The Lawyer&#x27;s Club, providing additional dormitory rooms and a meeting space for the residents of the Quad, is highlighted by a Great Lounge, and a dining room with a high-vaulted ceiling, an oak floor, and dark oak paneling.
In 2012, extensive renovations of the Lawyers Club were undertaken thanks in part to a $20 million gift from Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman Charles T. Munger, and was re-opened on August 19, 2013 for the 2013 school year.

== Student life ==

=== Publications ===
Michigan Law School students publish several law journals in addition to the &quot;Michigan Law Review&quot;, the sixth oldest legal journal in the U.S. These include:
*&quot;University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform&quot;
*&quot;Michigan Journal of International Law&quot;
*&quot;Michigan Journal of Gender and Law&quot;
*&quot;Michigan Journal of Race &amp; Law&quot;
*&quot;Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review&quot;
*&quot;Michigan Journal of Environmental and Administrative Law&quot;
*&quot;Michigan Business &amp; Entrepreneurial Law Review&quot;, formerly the &quot;Michigan Journal Private Equity and Venture Capital Law&quot;

Journal membership is obtained through participation in writing competitions.

=== Moot court ===
Students may compete in intramural moot court competitions, the oldest of which is the Henry M. Campbell Moot Court Competition, established in 1926 and first held in the 1927–1928 academic year. Other moot court competitions include the Child Welfare Law Moot Court Competition, Criminal Law Moot Court Competition, the Entertainment Media and Arts Moot Court Competition, the Environmental Law Moot Court Competition, the Intellectual Property Moot Court Competition, the Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, the Vis International Arbitration Moot Court, the Native American Law Students Association Competition, the Manfred Lachs Moot Court, Michigan Law Corporate Counseling Competition, and the 1L Oral Advocacy Competition.

=== Clinical programs ===
Michigan Law&#x27;s clinical program allows students to provide direct representation to clients under the supervision of full-time faculty. There are 18 clinical programs, including the Child Advocacy Law Clinic, the Entrepreneurship Clinic, the Environmental Law Clinic, the Federal Appellate Litigation Clinic, the International Transactions Clinic, the Michigan Innocence Clinic, the Transactional Lab, and the Unemployment Insurance Clinic.

=== Student organizations ===
Michigan Law offers a wide array of student organizations centered around various interest areas, including politics, pro bono work, community service, race, gender, religion, and hobbies. Student organizations organize various annual events, from student pageants such as Mr. Wolverine to the Michigan Law Culture Show.

=== Externships and internships ===
Michigan&#x27;s externship program is designed to provide students with real-world legal experience and advanced research opportunities beyond what is separately available in either a classroom or a clinic. Externships are available in places such as Switzerland, South Africa, and India.

=== Fellowships ===
Student Funded Fellowships (SFF) is a program designed to fund Michigan Law students who accept public interest summer job, particularly to help 1Ls finance the living costs associated with their summer jobs. SFF is governed by a board of law students and operates independently of the law school. Board members head fundraising efforts throughout the year, ranging from Donate a Day&#x27;s Pay (DADP), in which highly paid law firm summer associates donate a day&#x27;s salary to SFF, to a grand auction in the spring that invites bids on various donated items, including sports tickets, art, meals, and activities with faculty members. Around the time of the auction, board members review applications for summer funding and select a limited number of qualified students for grants. As of 2022, SFF awarded these select applicants $6,500. Students not otherwise selected for the grant, or students who do not plan to pursue public interest after law school but nonetheless need income for their summer positions, are entitled to a $5,000 loan for their summer expenses. This loan is facilitated by the law school. The loan is repaid on a sliding scale depending on how much money these students make during their 1L and 2L summers. As of 2022, if a student does not make more than $18,000 across their two summers, the loan is completely forgiven.

=== Employment ===
According to the University of Michigan Law School&#x27;s ABA-required employment disclosures, 98% of the graduates of the Class of 2021 were employed or seeking an advanced degree. This includes the 94.2% of the class who had obtained jobs requiring a J.D. Of the Class of 2021, 55% were employed by firms of greater than 100 attorneys and 18% obtained clerkships. Michigan&#x27;s Law School Transparency under-employment score is 5.8%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2021 who are unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. The majority of Michigan Law grads work in New York, Illinois, Michigan, California, and Washington, D.C.

=== Costs ===
Tuition at Michigan for the 2020–2021 academic year is $63,680 for residents of the state of Michigan and $66,680 for non-residents. The estimated cost of living for a Michigan student is $21,900. Assuming no tuition increases, a typical three-year course of study at Michigan therefore costs $256,740 (or $85,580 per year) for residents and $265,740 (or $88,580 per year) for non-residents.

<text>Hal Anderson is a Canadian radio personality. He is best known for his time hosting morning shows on CJOB and CJOB&#x27;s FM sister station, Power 97.

==Radio career==
While still studying Communication Arts at Lethbridge Community College, Anderson worked at CJOC in 1984, then took a job a year later as news director at CHAB in Moose Jaw, SK and then oldies station KY58 in Winnipeg.

In 1995, Anderson and B.J. Burke were given the morning show slot on Power 97, replacing Scruff Connors as co-hosts. This new show was billed as &quot;B.J. and Hal&quot;. Burke departed the show in 2003. On February 3, 2003, Anderson was joined by Dave Wheeler as his new co-host and the show was re-branded &quot;Wheeler and Hal&quot;.

On July 31, 2009, it was announced that Anderson would be moving to Power 97&#x27;s sister station, CJOB 680 AM, as the morning show host, replacing the outgoing Larry Updike. The last broadcast of the Wheeler and Hal show took place on September 4, 2009.

Anderson was released from his position as morning host with CJOB on May 13, 2014.

On September 27, 2015, Anderson debuted his new radio program on FAB 94.3 FM (CHIQ-FM) in Winnipeg called &quot;Hal Anderson Sundays&quot;.

On January 11, 2017, CJOB announced that Anderson will return as host of a new weekend show called &quot;Hal Anderson Weekends&quot; from 7-10 am starting on February 4, 2017, later moving to afternoons.

On September 27, 2021, CJOB announced that Hal was moving from their afternoon slot back to their 10 a.m. morning talk-show.

==&quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot; Prank==
Anderson encouraged listeners to vote for him as &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot; in 2004 as a joke, ultimately placing 34th in the top 50, ahead of William Lyon Mackenzie King, Wilfrid Laurier, Jean Chrétien, Tecumseh and Pamela Anderson.

<doc id="1202480" wikidata="Q3107857" url="?curid=1202480" title="Gitaroo Man">
<text>Gitaroo Man is a rhythm video game developed by iNiS and published by Koei for PlayStation 2. The game features visual production by Mitsuru Nakamura and an original soundtrack by Japanese band COIL. The game was released in Japan on June 21, 2001, in North America on February 18, 2002 and in Europe on June 21, 2002. A port of the game for PlayStation Portable, titled &quot;Gitaroo Man Lives!&quot;, was released in 2006.

==Story==
&quot;Gitaroo Man&quot; follows a young boy named U-1 who is often picked on by his rival Kazuya and passed over by the girl of his dreams, Pico. One day, as U-1 is suddenly attacked, his talking dog Puma transforms and gives him a weapon known as the Last Gitaroo, which transforms U-1 into the legendary warrior Gitaroo Man. After defeating many enemies, sent by Prince Zowie of the Gravillian Empire, and obtaining their Gitaroos, Puma brings a reluctant U-1 to Planet Gitaroo, which had been invaded by the Gravillian Empire. Upon arriving there, U-1 befriends a girl named Kirah, only to later discover that she is Zowie&#x27;s gladiator. Refusing to fight her, U-1 uses the power of music to convince Kirah to stand up against Zowie. Obtaining all eight Gitaroos, U-1 becomes the True Gitaroo Man and defeats Zowie, after which he returns home as a more confident person.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Gitaroo Man&quot; is a rhythm game in which the player character, U-1, faces against various opponents in musical battles. In each level, both the player and opponent has a life bar, with the player tasked with depleting the opponent&#x27;s life bar and reaching the end of the song without running out of life. With some exceptions, each level consists of three main phases; Charge, Attack, and Guard, followed by the Harmony and End phases at the end of the level. During the Charge and Attack phases, players follow a &quot;trace line&quot; using the analog stick, upon which red &quot;phase bars&quot; will appear. By pressing and holding down the button at the start of a phase, timing it to its appearance at the center of the screen, and releasing the button at the end, the player plays music. In the Charge phase, successful notes restore the player&#x27;s health, whereas in the Attack phase, successful notes damage the opponents whilst missed notes will hurt the player. During the guard phase, players must hit corresponding buttons as they reach the center of the screen to avoid attacks from the opponent, taking damage should they miss. Unlike the player&#x27;s life, which ends the game if depleted, the opponent&#x27;s life bar indicates the progress of the player. Most levels are split up into different sections, which can have multiple variations on each playthrough, and the player must damage the opponent enough to move onto the next section. Otherwise, they will have to repeat the section until enough damage is dealt. At the end of a level, players play through the Harmony phase, which is similar to the Attack phase, and keep on playing til the End phase, at which point the player will no longer take damage. After each level, players are given a rank based on their performance, with good ranks earning items for the collection, which unlocks character bios.

Masters&#x27; Play is an additional mode unlocked after clearing the game once. In this mode, gameplay is harder as more complex notes appear, the &quot;trace line&quot; becomes more complex with more twists and turns and thus harder to follow and players take more damage from mistakes. Versus Mode is a game for up four players, where players battle against each other in two teams playing Gitaroo Man&#x27;s parts and his opponent&#x27;s parts respectively. Not all songs are available in the mode, and some songs are altered to provide better balance for both players compared to the single player mode. The PSP version additionally features Duet Mode, in which two players can play co-operatively ad hoc in two exclusive new levels; &quot;Metal Header&quot; and &quot;Toda Pasion&quot;.
==Soundtrack==
The &quot;Gitaroo Man Original Soundtrack&quot; is an audio CD released in 2001, containing the majority of the songs found in the PS2 video game &quot;Gitaroo Man&quot;. While it is missing the background music played during the Collection viewing and the Masters&#x27; Play versions of songs, it does have four &quot;Ropeland&quot; remixes of certain stages.

==Release==
, a budget trial version of the game, was released prior to the full game&#x27;s Japanese launch, on April 5, 2001. It features the original TGS trailer, alternate versions of some of the game&#x27;s songs, an art gallery mode, and a mini game starring Puma. Each copy also included three collectible cards with which players could play rock paper scissors.

THQ handled distribution of the title in Europe as part of a four-game deal with Koei.

===&quot;Gitaroo Man Lives!&quot;===
Gitaroo Man Lives!, known in Japan as , is a port of the game released for the PlayStation Portable in Japan on June 8, 2006, in Europe on September 29, 2006, and in North America on November 14, 2006. Along with local Ad-Hoc multiplayer and additional difficulty options, the game adds a new Duet mode, in which two players control Gitaroo Man and Kirah in two exclusive new stages, &quot;Metal Header&quot; and &quot;Toda Pasión&quot;. These levels may also be played alone if the handheld&#x27;s Ad-Hoc is activated.

== Reception ==
According to the game&#x27;s designer Keiichi Yano, the game was commercially successful in the United States, where it sold more copies than it did in Japan.

&quot;Edge&quot; awarded the game a score of 7 out of 10; the game was later included in that magazine&#x27;s staff- and reader-voted &quot;Top 100 Games&quot; list published in July 2007. Despite a number of positive reviews, the North American and European versions of &quot;Gitaroo Man&quot; were produced in very low quantities by Koei and, as a result, have become somewhat rare; it is regarded as a cult video game. Around November 2005 in North America, copies of &quot;Gitaroo Man&quot; began popping up in GameStop game stores. This was due to a reprint by GameQuestDirect, similar to their previous reprints of PlayStation RPGs &quot;Persona 2&quot; and &quot;&quot;, both of which were previously very rare. The game was also reissued in Europe around this time.

Blake Fischer reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;The genius here isn&#x27;t in any bold gameplay innovations; it&#x27;s that it delivers a fun, well-rounded package that is beautifully crafted.&quot; It was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Music on PlayStation 2&quot; and &quot;Best Game No One Played on PlayStation 2&quot; awards.

===Awards===
*Received IGN&#x27;s award for Best PSP Music Game of 2006.

<doc id="1202481" wikidata="Q3107885" url="?curid=1202481" title="Quindim">
<text>Quindim () is a popular Brazilian baked dessert with Portuguese heritage, made chiefly from sugar, egg yolks and ground coconut. It is a custard and usually presented as an upturned cup with a glistening surface and intensely yellow color. The mixture can also be made in a large ring mold (like a savarin mold) in which case it is called a &quot;quindão&quot; and served in slices.

==Etymology==

The word quindim comes from &quot;dikende&quot; in Kikongo, a Bantu language. It means &quot;the gestures, or demeanor, or humor characteristic of adolescent girls.&quot;

== Origins ==

The heavy use of egg yolks is characteristic of many Portuguese sweets and pastries, such as the &quot;papo de anjo&quot; (&quot;angel&#x27;s crop&quot;) and &quot;fios de ovos&quot; (&quot;egg threads&quot;). Their combination with coconut and sugar was probably created by African slaves in 17th century Brazilian Northeast, where coconuts were abundant and sugar (from sugarcane) was a major industry.

==In popular culture==

Quindim is also a rhinoceros character (named after the dessert) featured in Monteiro Lobato&#x27;s children&#x27;s books.

It is also the subject of the song Os Quindins de Yayá which is featured in The Three Caballeros and sung by Aurora Miranda.

<doc id="1202482" wikidata="Q2937651" url="?curid=1202482" title="Captain Swing">
<text>&quot;Captain Swing&quot; was a name that was appended to several threatening letters during the rural Swing Riots of 1830, when labourers rioted over the introduction of new threshing machines and the loss of their livelihoods. The name was made-up and it came to symbolise the anger of the poor labourers in rural England who wanted a return to the pre-machine days when human labour was used.

==Labourers&#x27; war==
William Cobbett was a political activist who supported the working man. He rode around Kent and Sussex and spoke to agricultural workers about their problems. He then used this as source material for his journal the Political Register. He learned that many agricultural labourers were badly paid, or unemployed and half starved. The financial support for a laid off agricultural worker was less than that paid to support a criminal in prison. Cobbett realised that Parishes were trying to avoid having to provide support to the poor with many parishes sending labouring people to the United States to save the costs of supporting them as paupers. Cobbett had predicted that there would be problems with the agricultural workers and when rural disturbances started in Kent and spread to Sussex during August 1830, Cobbett described it as the &quot;Labourers&#x27; war&quot;.

The main causes of the disturbances were due to an excess of labour, predominantly by men who had been involved in the Napoleonic wars, returning home. Also by itinerant Irish labourers prepared to work for next to nothing undercutting the local agricultural workers. This coincided with a fall in agricultural prices. During the ensuing depression farmers were not able to pay their agricultural workers a sustainable wage. Farmers also stopped the custom of allowing their workers to take left over crops after the corn harvest, that would help them through the winter. This was compounded by the church tithes and the enclosure of common land. 

Added to this farmers began to introduce threshing machines that displaced workers. The displaced workers had no means to feed or clothe their families during the winter. A resident of Lewes in Sussex, Gideon Mantell the English obstetrician, geologist and palaeontologist noted in his diary of 1830:

Popular protests by farm workers occurred across agricultural areas of southern England. The main targets for protesting crowds were landowners/ landlords, whose threshing machines they destroyed or dismantled, and whom they petitioned for a rise in wages. 

The protests were notable for their discipline, a tradition of popular protest that went back to the eighteenth century. The act of marching towards an offending farmer&#x27;s homestead served not only to maintain group discipline, but also to warn the wider community that they were regimented and determined.
Often they sought to enlist local parish officials and occasionally magistrates to raise levels of poor relief as well. Throughout England, 2,000 protesters were brought to trial in 1830–1831; 252 were sentenced to death (though only 19 were actually hanged), 644 were imprisoned, and 481 were transported to penal colonies in Australia.

==Who was Swing?==


Threshing machines had been contentious since the Napoleonic wars. Letters had been sent to farmers, in the Reading area, suggesting that they should get rid of their threshing machines as early as 1811, the following two were reproduced in The London Gazette:
On Saturday night, 28 August 1830, in the Elham Valley, Kent a threshing machine was destroyed by rioters. The ringleaders were arrested on the 27 September 1830, nine days after the word &#x27;Swing&#x27; was graffitied on unpainted walls between Canterbury and Dover. Also two threatening letters were sent to local farmers, signed SWING:


The letters threatened violence. The intention was to terrify the farmers. The local paper reported that farmers who received the first two letters, were so terrified that they placed their machines in the open field inviting their destruction. 

Initially the authorities were not clear who was responsible for the wrecking of threshing machines and other farm equipment blaming it on poachers, smugglers or deer-stealers. However it wasn&#x27;t long before it was realised that it was mainly local village labourers.

The authorities tried to identify who this &#x27;Swing&#x27; was and apprehend him, it took a while for them to realise that Captain Swing was probably an invented name. The origin of the name is not clear. But the word &#x27;Swing&#x27; seems to have a deliberate double meaning. It could represent how the part of flail known as either a swing or a swingel, which the thrasher brings down in contact with the corn. It can also represent a swinging corpse on the gallows or gibbet. Possibly a more plausible explanation is that after a work party had stopped to sharpen their scythes and were ready to recommence work the leader would shout out &#x27;Swing!&#x27;, the leader was usually known as the Captain, hence &#x27;Captain Swing&#x27;. The name &#x27;Captain Swing’ became synonymous with the riots and soon symbolized the whole rural resistance.

==Examples of threatening &quot;Swing&quot; letters==

Not all letters were from impoverished farm labourers trying to improve their lot; other people saw the use of the eponymous &#x27;Swing&#x27; purely for private gain. For example a letter sent to a Mrs Chandler of Church Farm, Pursey, Wiltshire, was an obvious attempt at extortion:

The sender turned out to be a soldier in the Dragoons.

<doc id="1202483" wikidata="Q3757073" url="?curid=1202483" title="Loach minnow">
<text>The loach minnow (Rhinichthys cobitis) is a species of freshwater fish. It is a member of the carp family (family Cyprinidae) of order Cypriniformes. It occurs in streams and small rivers throughout the Gila River and San Pedro River systems in Arizona, New Mexico, and Sonora; it is now considered extinct in Mexico.

==Description==

Loach minnow has an elongated, compressed body with its size rarely exceeding in length. This species have an olivaceous body, highly blotched with darker pigment. They have dirty-white spots before and behind base of dorsal fin, and on lower and upper sides base of caudal. Breeding males have vivid red-orange markings on bases of fins, body, and lower head. Breeding females become yellow on their fin and lower body.
The loach minnow has whitish spots that are present on the origin and insertion of the dorsal fin as well as on the dorsal and ventral portions of the caudal fin base, this distinguishes the loach minnow from the similar speckled dace for field identification.

==Biology==
Loach minnows are short-lived fishes, depending on their environment and different characteristics of individual population. Spawning is observed to take place from late winter in early summer. Their eggs are deposited on the bottom of flattened rocks, and the number of eggs can range from 5 to more than 250 per rock, with average of 52 to 63 eggs per rock. A female can contain 150 to 1200 mature ova. Males turn red on their fins and above their mouths when they are ready to breed.

==Habitat and food==
Loach minnows can be found at turbulent, rocky riffles of mainstream rivers. They prefer moderate to swift current velocity and gravel substrates. Members of this species are opportunistic benthic insectivores: they seek food at the bottom substrate for riffle-dwelling larval ephemeropterans, simuliid, and chironomid dipterans.

==Conservation==
Loach minnow was proposed (USDI, Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS] 1985) and subsequently listed (USFWS 1986) as a threatened species. Critical habitat was proposed (USFWS 1985) and took effect on April 7, 1994. The critical habitat designation was subject to controversy and litigation, causing it to be rescinded, redesignated and altered. In 2012, the loach minnow was declared &quot;endangered&quot; alongside the spikedace (&quot;Meda fulgida&quot;), with which it shares much of its range.

<text>South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA), based in Pompano Beach, Florida, provides public transport services in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties. The organization was created on July 1, 2003, by the Florida Legislature and enacted by the Florida Department of Transportation. Replacing the pre-existing Tri-County Commuter Rail Authority, the goal of incorporation was to expand cooperation between the Tri-Rail commuter rail service and the existing county public transport authorities: Broward County Transit, Miami-Dade Transit, and Palm Tran. Tri-Rail is solely operated by the SFRTA.

==History==
SFRTA&#x27;s mission statement is; &quot;To coordinate, develop and implement, in cooperation with all appropriate levels of government, private enterprise and citizens at-large in the community, a viable regional transportation system in South Florida that endeavors to meet the desires and needs for the movement of people, goods and services.&quot;

In November 2011, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), through its TIGGER III Program, awarded $5.7 million to the SFRTA for its sustainable stations project. The project involves installation of solar panels at a station that will provide 100% of the station&#x27;s energy, while sending excess energy to the main power grid and store daytime energy for lighting needs at night.

<doc id="1202488" wikidata="Q7253849" url="?curid=1202488" title="Prüfer rank">
<text>In mathematics, especially in the area of algebra known as group theory, the Prüfer rank of a pro-p group measures the size of a group in terms of the ranks of its elementary abelian sections. The rank is well behaved and helps to define analytic pro-p-groups. The term is named after Heinz Prüfer.

== Definition ==
The Prüfer rank of pro-p-group formula_1 is 

::formula_2

where formula_3 is the rank of the abelian group 

:formula_4, 

where formula_5 is the Frattini subgroup of formula_6.

As the Frattini subgroup of formula_6 can be thought of as the group of non-generating elements of formula_6, it can be seen that formula_3 will be equal to the &quot;size of any minimal generating set&quot; of formula_6.

== Properties ==
Those profinite groups with finite Prüfer rank are more amenable to analysis.

Specifically in the case of finitely generated pro-p groups, having finite Prüfer rank is equivalent to having an open normal subgroup that is powerful. In turn these are precisely the class of pro-p groups that are p-adic analytic – that is groups that can be imbued with a 
p-adic manifold structure.

<doc id="1202497" wikidata="Q5472420" url="?curid=1202497" title="Fort Yargo State Park">
<text>Fort Yargo State Park is a U.S. state park located in Winder, Georgia, situated between Athens and Atlanta. The park is located 1 mile south of Winder and is accessible by Georgia State Route 81. There is a lake with a public beach. Available activities at Fort Yargo include GeoCaching, hiking, mountain biking, disc golf, boating (including Jon boat, pedal boat, and canoe rentals), lake swimming, fishing, picnicking, and miniature golf. The park also features a log fort built in 1792 by settlers, for protection against the Creek and Cherokee.

The park also hosts Camp Will-A-Way, an accessible camp designed for individuals with developmental disabilities, in partnership with Camp Twin Lakes.

==History==
The Creek village known as Snodon was located near what is now Athens and Church streets in Winder. A Creek named Umausauga claimed an area south of Tishmagu, now called Mulberry River. In 1786, three men – Abednego Moore, Richard Easley, and Josiah Strong - arrived from Effingham County. They set up camp north of the Mulberry River in hopes of trading beads and cloth. The three men formed a friendship with Umasauga, who allowed the men to purchase some of his land which they called Beadland. The day after the trade nine friends and family joined the three men. They brought four horses, two wagons, four head of cattle, four sheep, six pigs, ten new rifles with powder and shot and tools. The new colony now had eight men and four women, six of whom had fought in the American Revolution.

The State of Georgia contracted with the Humphries brothers – George, Shadrack, and Uriah, the three sons of Revolutionary War captain and Jackson County delegate to 1798 Georgia Constitutional Convention, Joseph Humphries – to build four forts across Georgia. Fort Yargo was constructed in 1793. Its location was given as three miles SW of &quot;Jug Tavern,&quot; the original name for Winder. The other three forts are Fort Strong at Talassee, Fort Thomocoggan now Jefferson, and Fort Groaning Rock now Commerce.

In 1810, George Washington Humphrey, an original builder of the Fort, sold Fort Yargo and 121 surrounding acres at auction to John Hill for $167.00. John Hill and his family lived on the property for a number of years. The family cemetery is located in the Fort Yargo State Park.

In the year 1927, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) took on the project to restore and preserve Fort Yargo. Mildred Pledger and the DAR placed a marker on the grounds which was later destroyed. Led by C.O. Maddox, members of the Kiwanis Club and the Lions Club set out to preserve the fort. With the help of Senator Richard B. Russell, Jr. in 1954, were donated to the state. Other lands were acquired to bring the acreage count to .
The Fort Yargo building, constructed as part of the original Fort, is an two-story log blockhouse. The logs used to construct the Fort are around 10 inches thick and are joined at the corners by interlocking wedge shaped notches. Local citizens and the Fort Yargo Living History Society are working today to restore Fort Yargo and some out buildings. Scheduled living history dates provide visitors with a chance to learn more about the history of the site.

===Camp Will-A-Way===
Camp Will-A-Way is provided by Camp Twin Lakes and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Opened in 1971 and renovated in 2009, the camp provides a 250-bed camping facility to provide for the special needs population.

<doc id="1202498" wikidata="Q2922966" url="?curid=1202498" title="Boxing Legends of the Ring">
<text>Boxing Legends of the Ring is a boxing video game for the Sega Genesis and Super NES consoles. The boxers are represented by 2D sprites seen from over the shoulder of one of the fighters. The title of the game refers to the famous boxing magazine, &quot;The Ring&quot;, which the game is licensed to associate itself with. The following famous middleweight boxers are represented in the game: Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Durán, Thomas Hearns, James Toney, Marvin Hagler, Jake LaMotta, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Rocky Graziano.

All of the fights in the game take place in the Las Vegas Hilton casino in the North American version. There are also advertising banners for HBO visible during fights that are not available in the Japanese version. In the Japanese version, the game takes place in a generic boxing ring using the publisher&#x27;s name in place of the HBO advertisements found in the North American version.

A special version was released in Mexico and the American Southwest called Chavez II; the game exchanged the English language words for Spanish and omitted some vocals.

==Gameplay==

During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers&#x27; wellbeing by observing the small portraits of the fighters&#x27; faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter&#x27;s health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).

The fighters&#x27; movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called &#x27;super punches&#x27;, that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: &#x27;power&#x27;, &#x27;stamina&#x27;, and &#x27;chin&#x27;.
There are three different modes: &#x27;exhibition&#x27;, &#x27;career&#x27;, and &#x27;battle of the legends&#x27;. In &#x27;exhibition&#x27; mode, a player can choose to fight as any boxer in the game, against any boxer in the game, against either the console or another player. In &#x27;career&#x27; mode, a player creates their own boxer, and fights their way through all the boxers in the game, before fighting for the world title. If the player loses once in &#x27;career&#x27; mode, he is given a warning that &#x27;game over&#x27; would be given for the second loss; giving the player no alternative but to either use a password or start over again with a new boxer.

==Presentation==
Each fight is seen from behind and slightly to one side of one of the boxers, so that the player appears to be looking over their shoulder, in the direction of their opponent. In the North American version, the blood is colored red while the Japanese version uses sweat instead. This is contrary to Nintendo&#x27;s then-current censorship policy that blood should never be used in their games. Between each round, girls in bikinis announce the next round by showing a number around the ring (and to the player).

==Reception==

Reviewing the SNES release as &quot;Chavez II&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot; assessed that while it was not one of the best boxing games for the system, it was a surprisingly strong improvement from the original, with faster controls and sharper, bloodier graphics. They summarized it as &quot;decent&quot;.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;other than the novely of Spanish text and Chavez on the box, you&#x27;re just as well off picking up [...] &quot;Legends of the Ring&quot;.&quot; Super Gamer magazine gave the SNES version a review score of 81% stating: &quot;Huge character graphics get you right into the bone-crunching action. Gameplay is somewhat limited, but there is always plenty of challenge and moves.&quot;

<text>Picture Butte is a town in southern Alberta, Canada. It is located north of the city of Lethbridge. It claims the title of &quot;Livestock Feeding Capital of Canada.&quot;

== Name ==
In 2010, Ernest and Austin Mardon stated that &quot;the name is descriptive, being a translation of the Blackfoot &#x27;the beautiful hill.&#x27;&quot;

== History ==
Picture Butte received its name from a prominence southeast of town. By 1947, however, the prominence&#x27;s soil had been reworked and used for street improvements, highway construction and a dyke on the shore of the Picture Butte Lake Reservoir. The prominence no longer exists.

Homesteading in the area began in the early 20th century. The building of the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation System in 1923 and the CPR rail line in 1925 stimulated an influx of settlers. The first post office opened in 1925.

In 1943, Picture Butte became a village, and it attained town status in 1961 with a population of 978.

The Canadian Sugar Factory closed in 1978 and resulted in the loss of tax revenues and employment opportunities to the town. Industrial activity consists of small service, warehousing and wholesaling industries.

The town annexed approximately in 1991, significantly changing the town&#x27;s boundary since the general municipal plan of 1980.

A number of farms and properties in the Picture Butte area have changed and adapted over time; for example, in 2016, the Natural Resources Conservation Board approved Scholten Farms&#x27; request to convert swine feeders to cattle feeders.

<text>The Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism (CCDS) is a democratic socialist group in the United States that originated in 1991 as the Committees of Correspondence, a moderate grouping in the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). Named after the Committees of Correspondence formed during the American Revolution, the group criticized the leadership of CPUSA president Gus Hall and argued that, in light of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the party should reject Leninism and adopt a multi-tendency democratic socialist orientation. The party continues to consider itself Marxist.

The former CPUSA official Gil Green, as well as notable activists, such as Pete Seeger and Angela Davis, led the reformist movement in December 1991 at the national convention. Failing to win over the majority of CPUSA members, the group left the party. It held conferences to establish a new organization, which attracted independent leftists and socialists from outside the CPUSA tradition, or some who had left the party previously over its policies. In 2000, the group changed its name to the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. In addition to that of the CPUSA, the CCDS permits dual membership in the Democratic Socialists of America and the Socialist Party USA. Its publications include &quot;Dialogue and Initiative&quot; and &quot;Crosscurrents&quot;.

<doc id="1202515" wikidata="Q5463824" url="?curid=1202515" title="Fobia">
<text>Fobia is a Mexican rock en español band from Mexico City.

==History==
The band was formed in 1987 by Leonardo de Lozanne and Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Huidobro, brother of Micky Huidobro of Molotov. The original lineup consisted of Lozanne, Huidobro, bassist Javier &#x27;Chá!&#x27; Ramirez, keyboardist Iñaki Vazquez, and Gabriel Kuri on drums. Kuri was later replaced by Jorge ‘Chiquis’ Amaro who was followed by multi-instrumentalist Jay de la Cueva, (lead singer of the Mexican glam metal band Moderatto).

Fobia was one of the original bands to emerge from the rock en español / Rock en tu idioma (Rock in your language) boom of the late 1980s, alongside Caifanes, Maná, Neón, Maldita Vecindad y los Hijos del Quinto Patio and Los Amantes de Lola; all of which followed in the footsteps of Soda Stereo – who by the late 1980s had amassed a huge following in the Americas. In December 1987, RCA Ariola de México held a &quot;Rock en tu idioma&quot; battle of the bands contest in Mexico City. Fobia was eliminated early on and Los Amantes de Lola went on to win the contest. In spite of their early elimination, executives from Ariola decided to schedule an appointment with Fobia. According to legend, the band missed their meeting with Ariola because they weren&#x27;t able to enter the building due to problems with security. Following the incident, the band&#x27;s luck improved. Saúl Hernández of Caifanes produced their first demos and Ariola eventually signed them.

Fobia&#x27;s early sound, like many of the genre, was heavily influence by 80&#x27;s new wave with a few notable exceptions: David Bowie and KISS. Fobia&#x27;s music has always embraced the fantastic and eccentric and contains large doses of irony and humor. Fobia steered clear of the political and cultural themes that were embraced by their contemporaries. According to Lozanne, &quot;I think it was more of a strategy of the record companies. We never felt like we were part of a movement. We didn&#x27;t dress like the other bands. We didn&#x27;t sing about the things they were singing about&quot;.

The name &quot;Fobia&quot; was chosen because it described the insecurities, fears, and personal obsessions of the band members. These were transformed into melodies and music, and materialized into their first songs; &quot;El microbito&quot;, &quot;La iguana&quot; and &quot;El crucifijo&quot;, which they played in small bars and at house parties.

Fobia&#x27;s self-titled debut album &quot;Fobia&quot; cemented their reputation as an innovative and original rock en español act. Produced by Oscar López, their self-titled album yielded classics such as &quot;El Microbito&quot;, &quot;El Crucifijo&quot;, and &quot;La Iguana&quot;. In 1990, Fobia toured with Caifanes, Maná, and Maldita Vecindad y los Hijos del Quinto Patio as part as a promotional tour for the emerging batch of Mexican rock bands.

The following year Fobia released &quot;Mundo Feliz&quot; (Happy World) which was recorded in Mexico City and at the Power Station in New York City, again with Marteen. &quot;Mundo Feliz&quot; yielded &quot;Camilla&quot; and &quot;El Diablo&quot;. The album featured a cameo by Mexican rock/pop diva Alejandra Guzmán.

In 1993 Fobia release &quot;Leche&quot; (Milk), a decidedly more experimental album, infusing Latin rhythms and alternative rock. The self-produced album became Fobia&#x27;s least successful album to date. The lead single, &quot;Los Cibernoides&quot; (Cybernoids) was a critique of the Mexican media conglomerate Televisa. Regardless of sales, &quot;Leche&quot; was a critical success. &quot;Leche&quot; saw the departure of original drummer Gabriel Kuri.

For 1995&#x27;s &quot;Amor Chiquito&quot; (Small Love) Fobia enlisted famed Argentine producer and composer Gustavo Santaolalla who had a long string of production credits during the 1990s, producing albums for Mexican acts such as Café Tacuba, Caifanes, Molotov, and Julieta Venegas. The album was mixed by Jim Kerr and Tony Peluso, ex guitarist of The Carpenters. For &quot;Amor Chiquito&quot;, original drummer Gabriel Kuri was replaced by Jorge (Chiquis) Amaro, former drummer of Neón.

&quot;Amor Chiquito&quot; was a more direct sounding album. The lead single “Revolucion sin Manos” was a guitar driven 4/4 stomper. &quot;Amor&quot; put Fobia back on top of the rock en español food chain. Fobia toured the U.S. and Latin America. Following the release of the album Kuri was replaced by Jay de la Cueva, currently of Moderatto, who at the time had worked with teen pop group Micro Chips and played drums for Las Víctimas del Doctor Cerebro.

In 1997 Fobia participated in a Queen tribute album with &quot;Under Pressure&quot; (&quot;Presionando&quot;). That same year Fobia released the live album &quot;Fobia on Ice&quot;. Fobia disbanded in 1997.

==Reunion==

In 2004 Fobia reunited and released a greatest hits compilation album titled &quot;Wow 87*04&quot;. &quot;Wow 87*04&quot; was followed by Fobia&#x27;s fifth studio album Rosa Venus (Venus Rose). To promote the record, Fobia toured the U.S. and Latin America. Following the release of Rosa Venus and the subsequent tour Fobia returned to Mexico City to play a series of shows including an opening slot for the Rolling Stones held at El Foro Sol. To honor their 20th anniversary in 2007 Fobia released XX a compilation of live tracks recorded during their 2005 tour. The album included acoustic versions as well as new arrangements of old songs. This disc was accompanied by a documentary/music video DVD.

In April 2011, Fobia gave a rousing performance at the 11th Vive Latino – Festival Iberoamericano de Cultura Musical, one of the most important music festivals in Latin America. Fobia previewed &quot;La Búsqueda&quot; a song from their upcoming album. Since then, the band released Destruye Hogares in 2012.

In early 2019 Fobia played in &#x27;El Palacio de los deportes&#x27; field for 17,000 fans to celebrate its 30th years anniversary and played 32 songs and releasing &#x27;Pastel&#x27; on march the 1st with their main hits and many other songs live.

<text>Robert D. (Bob) Rose (born July 16, 1931) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the south Winnipeg riding of St. Vital for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Rose worked as a broker before entering political life.

==Political career==
===Municipal===
In the 1983 Winnipeg municipal elections, Rose was elected as a school trustee in the St. Vital school division at his first attempt. He served one three-year term. In the 1986 Winnipeg municipal election, he was elected to Winnipeg City Council, for the St. Vital ward of Glenlawn, defeating Al Ducharme, who had represented the ward since 1977.

===Provincial===
The New Democratic Party government of Manitoba, led by Howard Pawley, fell in 1988 when NDP backbencher Jim Walding—the Member of the Legislative Assembly for St. Vital—took the unprecedented step of voting against his own government&#x27;s budget. Rose ran in the 1988 provincial election in St. Vital and defeated his closest competitor, Progressive Conservative candidate Paul Herriot, by 817 votes; Walding did not stand. The Liberals increased their legislative strength from one to twenty in this election, and Rose sat as a member of the official opposition for the next two years. In the election of 1990, he lost by 118 votes to Tory Shirley Render amid a general decline in support for his party. He has not sought a return to political life since this time.

<text>In botany, a virtual herbarium is a herbarium in a digitized form. That is, it concerns a collection of digital images of preserved plants or plant parts. Virtual herbaria often are established to improve availability of specimens to a wider audience. However, there are digital herbaria that are not suitable for internet access because of the high resolution of scans and resulting large file sizes (several hundred megabytes per file). Additional information about each specimen, such as the location, the collector, and the botanical name are attached to every specimen. Frequently, further details such as related species and growth requirements are mentioned.

== Specimen imaging ==
The standard hardware used for herbarium specimen imaging is the &quot;HerbScan&quot; scanner. It is an inverted flat-bed scanner which raises the specimen up to the scanning surface. This technology was developed because it is standard practice to never turn a herbarium specimen upside-down. Alternatively, some herbaria employ a flat-bed book scanner or a copy stand to achieve the same effect.

A small color chart and a ruler must be included on a herbarium sheet when it is imaged. The JSTOR Plant Science requires that the ruler bears the herbarium name and logo, and that a ColorChecker chart is used for any specimens to be contributed to the Global Plants Initiative (GPI). 

== Uses ==

Virtual herbaria are established in part to increase the longevity of specimens. Major herbaria participate in international loan programs, where a researcher can request specimens to be shipped in for study. This shipping contributes to the wear and tear of specimens. If, however, digital images are available, images of the specimens can be sent electronically. These images may be a sufficient substitute for the specimens themselves, or alternatively, the researcher can use the images to &quot;preview&quot; the specimens, to which ones should be sent out for further study. This process cuts down on the shipping, and thus the wear and tear of the specimens, as well as the wait times associated with shipping.

Virtual herbaria can also be used to increase public awareness of herbaria. Some herbaria make their specimen databases publicly available on the Internet. Digital images of specimens can be added to these databases to allow the public to further engage with the material. Some herbaria also capitalize on their images by selling herbarium prints and greeting cards featuring particularly attractive specimens.

== Five task clusters for digitization ==

* pre-digitization curation and staging
* specimen image capture
* specimen image processing

<doc id="1202532" wikidata="Q3574843" url="?curid=1202532" title="Tombak">
<text>The tombak (Persian: تمبک), tonbak (تنبک) or zarb (ضَرب) is an Iranian goblet drum. It is considered the principal percussion instrument of Persian music. The tombak is normally positioned diagonally across the torso, while the player uses one or more fingers and/or the palm(s) of the hand(s) on the drumhead, often (for a ringing timbre) near the drumhead&#x27;s edge. Sometimes, tombak players wear metal finger rings for an extra-percussive &quot;click&quot; on the drum&#x27;s shell. Tombak virtuosi often perform solos lasting ten minutes or more.

==Description==
The tombak is a single-headed goblet drum is about 18 inches in height with a 28 centimetre diameter head. Its shell is carved from a single block of (sometimes highly figured, knotted or marbled) wood, maybe with a carved design or geometric pattern (such as furrows, flutes, diamonds and/or spirals—it is often a costly, heirloom-type or vintage musical instrument). At the bottom the shell is somewhat thicker than at the top for strength (since the drumhead adds to the strength at the top). The shell&#x27;s wall thickness is approximately 2 centimetres. The throat is nearly cylindrical and connects the top (body) cavity to the hollow base (the throat itself, the interior of which forms the small opening).

A sheepskin or goatskin head is stretched and secured with glue, tacks or both. The fairly wide top opening permits full bass tone as well as various treble tones (see below). Tombaks with adjustable tuning have been produced experimentally but the head tension is normally fixed prior to performance with careful attention to the temperature and humidity. The player may heat or cool or dampen or dry the membrane to reach a desired fundamental pitch. The pitch can be raised somewhat during a performance by applying finger pressure but a variety of tapping and clicking timbres reduce overall focus on the drum&#x27;s pitch. Typically, two or three clearly contrasting timbres (through varying finger placement or clacking of a ring against the drum shell) are played in an antiphonal style.

Goblet-shaped drums are played in different regions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Although similarities exist among all goblet drums, the techniques for playing the tombak are different from most other goblet drums. The modern tombak described in this page is most closely associated with the music of Iran. The tombak was not considered a virtuoso solo instrument until the pioneering work of Hossein Tehrāni in the 1950s, as well as innovations of Nasser Farhangfar and others. Modern tombak players are exponentially expanding the techniques used in playing the instrument.

== Modernisation ==
The Tombak was considered an accompanying instrument until the pioneering work of Hossein Tehrāni in the 1950s. Tehrani added to the instrument&#x27;s possibilities with added &quot;beating methods&quot;. He also played his instrument with different &quot;sonorities&quot;. His pupils included Mohammad Esmaili (born 1934), Jahangir Malek (born 1931), Jamshid Chemirani (born 1942), Amir Nasser Eftetah (1925–1977) renowned teacher whose disciple Bahman Rajabi, develop modern technology.

Farhangfar Nasser (1947–1997) revolutionized the principles of accompaniment, often away much of the melody without ever interfering, he drew on many styles of play of Zarb-e zourkhâné (especially that of Morshed Moradi) that accompanies Varzesh-e Pahlavani (), traditional martial gymnastics practiced in Zurkhaneh (&quot;house of strength&quot;) and motrebs (popular musicians playing accents in a particular way). His knowledge of poetry and a clear and powerful voice make an improviser and especially an outstanding accompanist, always anticipating phrases soloist. Very few players assimilate his art. Modern players open new perspectives amount to the game of Tombak, as Madjid Khaladj, Jamshid Mohebbi, Morteza Aayan, Mohammad Akhavan, Dariush Zargari, Navid Afghah, Farbod Yadollahi, Dariush Es&#x27;haghi, Ahmad Mostanbet, Sahab Torbati, Khâvarzamini Pedram, Siamak Barghi, Pezhham Akhavass, and Pejman Haddadi.
