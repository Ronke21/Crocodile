<text>Sneeze are an Australian pop rock band formed in 1991 by Nic Dalton (who ran the band&#x27;s record label, Half a Cow) on vocals, bass guitar, guitar, keyboards, and drums, and Tom Morgan (from Smudge) on vocals and guitar. They issued four albums, &quot;Sneeze&quot; (1993), &quot;The Four Seezons&quot; (1997), &quot;Lost the Spirit to Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (2001) and &quot;Just The Blues Sped Up&quot; (April 2004). As of mid-2019, Sneeze have been working on new material.

== History ==

Sneeze were formed in Sydney in 1991 by Nic Dalton (The Plunderers) on vocals, bass guitar, guitar, keyboards and drums, and Tom Morgan (from Smudge) on vocals and guitar. In 1993 they issued their debut album, &quot;Sneeze&quot;, which initially comprised 20 tracks with none over two minutes in length on Dalton&#x27;s own label, Half a Cow. It was recorded with a range of guest musicians: Simon Day (from Ratcat) on guitar and vocals, Alannah Russack (from the Hummingbirds) on guitar and vocals, and Evan Dando (from the Lemonheads) on guitar and vocals. It was expanded by 21 additional tracks and released on CD as &quot;41 Songs in 47 Minutes&quot; (June 1996).

Dalton later recalled that the group was initially a studio-only side project, &quot;Tom and I were just writing these short songs for Smudge, I was in the Plunderers and the Hummingbirds. The Lemonheads were the first band to record a Sneeze song, even before Tom and I did. We ended up starting Sneeze, but we never thought we’d play live.&quot; Lara Meyerratken joined on the drums in 1996 when they started playing live. Sneeze&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Four Seezons&quot; (1997), has one side providing their &quot;take on Vivaldi&#x27;s Four Seasons&quot; and the b-side has live tracks recorded at Fbi Radio. After Meyerratken left the group in 1998 they used &quot;several drummers including using the drummer of their support act for the evening.&quot;

Sneeze had many other members including drummers Russell Hopkinson (from You Am I), Simon Gibson (from Half Miler), and Andy Calvert (from Wifey). Bill Gibson (from the Eastern Dark) on bass guitar and Cameron Bruce (from the Fantastic Leslie) on keyboards have played shows with the band, as did Bernie Hayes, Jess Ciampa and Leticia Nischang (from Bambino Koresh). Sneeze saw their floating line-up as one of their strengths. Dalton described how &quot;there’s about 10 or 11 Sneeze members. Basically it&#x27;s like the album, Sneeze is who ever we want to get in the band. Every time we play live we seem to have a completely different lineup, and just really love that. It makes it fresh and exciting, and you never know who&#x27;s going to turn up and what it&#x27;s going to sound like. But there&#x27;re all such good musicians that it always ends up sounding great.&quot;

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Lost the Spirit to Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (2001), was described by Michelle Ho of &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; as &quot;Reaching past the simple (but not necessarily bad) structure of classic indie pop guitar/bass/drums, Sneeze delves into elements of soul, groove and even, heaven help us, dabblings into seventies disco, making heavy use of the sorely underrated casio keyboard, bongo drums and deliciously giggle-worthy male falsettos, making [the album] one of the most unique Australian pop releases to date.&quot; In April of the following year they issued an eight-track extended play, &quot;Maybe Moving In&quot;, which Ho&#x27;s colleague Jasper Lee felt &quot;shows the band with slightly greater thematic consistency that is far easier to appreciate... it&#x27;s hard to discern when to take Sneeze seriously, no doubt they&#x27;ve got their act together in this fairly comprehensive and lengthy EP. There are moments where you can see the pop genius of Morgan and Dalton at work, and that can only be a good thing.&quot;

The group&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Just the Blues Sped Up&quot; (April 2004), was promoted with an east coast tour. AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger rated the album as three out of four stars and explained, &quot;Variety can be a virtue, but the main shortfall here is that the songs aren&#x27;t special. The range, it must be emphasized, is admirable: quasi-hard rock, psychedelic, punkish numbers that verge on Fall-like harshness at times, amiable No Depression-like country-rock, turgid soul-pop vaguely reminiscent of Lambchop...&quot;

Sneeze&#x27;s recordings use a range of guest artists including other members of the Lemonheads (who were the first band to record a song for the first Sneeze album), Robyn St. Clare, Simon Holmes (of the Hummingbirds), Bernie Hayes, John Encarnacao (from Warmer), Swirl, the Plunderers) and Jess Ciampa. Gibson and Holmes were both members of Her Name in Lights, which issued their debut album, &quot;Into the Light Again&quot;, in October 2004.

<doc id="1194509" wikidata="Q6962339" url="?curid=1194509" title="Oliver Twist (1999 TV series)">
<text>Oliver Twist is a 1999 drama serial produced by ITV based on the 1838 novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; by Charles Dickens.

==Plot==
Edwin Leeford, who has a country estate, falls in love with his neighbour, Agnes Fleming, who lives with her widowed former sea-captain father and her young sister, Rose. After Agnes becomes pregnant by Edwin, she discovers he is married, with a long-estranged wife and a teenage son. Edwin is called to Rome by a dying uncle who plans to leave him a fortune as compensation for having arranged Edwin&#x27;s unhappy marriage. However, his wife Elizabeth learns of this plan, follows him there, and murders him (after the uncle dies and Edwin inherits his wealth). She tries to convince their son Edward to murder Agnes but his inability to do so triggers a seizure and Agnes runs away, convinced Edwin abandoned her despite his promise to return: Rose witnesses the attack and escapes and is traumatized. Agnes seems to contemplate suicide but trudges on to a town, where she collapses, is taken to the local workhouse and dies in childbirth. Her baby is christened Oliver Twist and taken to a farm for foundlings.

At nine, Oliver is moved from the farm back to the workhouse, where he is starved, beaten, and forced to work long hours alongside other children. Other boys compel him at mealtime to ask for more food, and the workhouse board decides he has to be sent away. He is apprenticed to Mr. Sowerberry, an undertaker, who is partly sympathetic to him, though his wife and their servants abuse Oliver, and Sowerberry&#x27;s other apprentice, Noah, insinuates that Oliver&#x27;s mother is a criminal, inciting Oliver to violence. Oliver escapes from the house and runs away to London, where he is taken by a young pickpocket, the Artful Dodger, to a dwelling occupied by young aspiring thieves under the tutelage of Fagin, a former magician from Prague reduced to a life of crime.

By this point, Edward Leeford, Oliver&#x27;s half-brother, lives in London with his mother, who is determined to disinherit Oliver. Using the pseudonym Monks, Edward associates with Fagin and contracts him to make Oliver a criminal and experience public disgrace, as a provision in their father&#x27;s will left most of his estate to Agnes&#x27;s child, but disinherited him if the child was a boy who showed any signs of bad character. Oliver accompanies the Dodger and Charley, another young thief, outdoors and they set him up to be arrested for pickpocketing. The target is Mr. Brownlow, Edwin Leeford&#x27;s dearest friend and executor of his will, with whom Edwin left a portrait of Agnes on his way to Rome. A bookstore owner&#x27;s testimony exonerates Oliver.

Unaware of who his charge is, Mr. Brownlow takes Oliver home to live with him and his housekeeper Mrs. Bedwin. Before Oliver can tell his story, he is kidnapped while on an errand for Brownlow by two of Fagin&#x27;s adult accomplices, Bill Sikes (a housebreaker) and Nancy (Sikes&#x27;s lover and a prostitute), and returned to Fagin&#x27;s house. Brownlow reluctantly accepts his friend Grimwig&#x27;s insistence that Oliver has lied and has returned to the thieves and angrily sends Mrs. Bedwin, who defends Oliver, to his country house. Fagin, still determined to fulfill his contract with Monks and discredit Oliver, sends him off with Bill Sikes and another housebreaker, Toby Crackit, to rob this country house, where Mrs. Bedwin is looking after Agnes&#x27;s orphaned sister Rose, adopted by Brownlow, now 17, and just returned from a trip to Paris with her governess. Four other servants help with the house.

During the robbery, Oliver is shot in the dark by one of the servants. Toby runs, Sikes leaves Oliver in a ditch, then runs off himself; Oliver makes his way to the house and is taken in by Mrs. Bedwin. When Brownlow arrives, finally what Oliver knows of his history is revealed, and Rose befriends him. However, Fagin and Monks travel to this place after neither Sikes nor Toby can confirm that Oliver is dead; Rose and Oliver see them peering in a window and Rose, recognizing Monks from his attack on her sister, has this old trauma reawakened. However, both men escape from the estate. Monks had previously managed to get from Mr. Bumble, formerly beadle in the town where Oliver was born, and his wife, the workhouse matron, a locket and ring Edwin gave to Agnes, engraved with their names, and has kept these proofs of Oliver&#x27;s identity.

Brownlow and his household return to London to find out more about Oliver&#x27;s history. Nancy, who has always been sympathetic to Oliver, runs to Brownlow&#x27;s house while Sikes is asleep and tells them about the contract between Monks and Fagin. Finally, Rose can describe her nightmares about Agnes&#x27;s attacker. Meanwhile, Fagin has grown suspicious of Nancy and has sent the Dodger and Charley to spy on her; when Sikes learns she went to Brownlow&#x27;s house, he murders her in a fit of rage. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Leeford, who has persisted in her pursuit of revenge and money, but now is aging and unwell, dies suddenly, leaving Monks/Edward, who is now strong enough to escape her beatings, a free agent. Brownlow&#x27;s men arrest him and bring him to Brownlow&#x27;s house.

Between Nancy&#x27;s murder and Monks&#x27;s desertion, Fagin is increasingly cornered. He scatters his gang and disguises himself, but Sikes, now a fugitive, arrives to try to get Fagin to help him escape. By this point, a mob is breaking down the doors of the house. Sikes falls from the roof and is killed; Fagin is spotted by Oliver and Charley (who has given up on crime) in the crowd and arrested.

Brownlow persuades Edward Leeford to confess to Rose and Oliver what he and his mother tried to do. He describes his own childhood trauma, including an accident that left him with uncontrollable seizures and his mother&#x27;s abuse of him. Brownlow, Rose, and Oliver agree that he can have his rightful part of his father&#x27;s estate, and he emigrates to the Caribbean, where he marries and starts a family.

As Fagin awaits execution, Brownlow and Oliver visit him, and he tells Oliver how to find what Monks/Edward gave him for safekeeping, an unmailed letter from Edwin to Agnes, written shortly after the death of his uncle and just before his own murder; Brownlow reads this to Oliver. Shortly thereafter, Rose marries Dr. Losborne, a local physician, and Oliver attends the wedding with Brownlow&#x27;s household, where Charley is now employed.

==Cast==
==Controversy==
The adaptation, by Alan Bleasdale, attracted controversy, particularly for the decision to begin with two hours of backstory (much of it invented by Bleasdale) before reaching the plot of the novel. Furthermore, Bleasdale altered well-known sections of the novel, so that although the basic idea is the same, almost every detail is changed enough so that the drama plays like an original story, not an adaptation. Monks, who is made an out-and-out murderer in this serial (he kills his father), is nevertheless changed from a completely irredeemable and evil villain to someone who reforms to the point of getting married and starting a family.

==Home media==
On 27 March 2000 ITV released a double box set VHS of the adaption. It was co-owned by the TV and film company Carlton. On 16 October 2006 ITV re-released it on DVD.

<text>Peter &quot;Pirre&quot; Wallenberg Sr. (29 May 1926 – 19 January 2015) was a Swedish business leader who was chairman of Investor AB for ten years.

==Early life and education==
Wallenberg was born in , Stockholm, Sweden, into the Wallenberg finance family. He was the son of banker Marcus Wallenberg Jr. and his Scottish wife Dorothy (née Mackay), the younger brother of Marc Wallenberg and the nephew of Jacob Wallenberg. He earned a Candidate of Law degree in 1949 from Stockholm College, now Stockholm University.

==Career==
He began his career in 1953 at Atlas Copco AB. Wallenberg worked at its subsidiary in the United States from 1956 to 1959 and was CEO of its subsidiary in Rhodesia from 1959 to 1962 and in Congo from 1960 to 1962 and in England from 1962 to 1967. He was CEO of Atlas Copco MCT AB (Mining and Construction Technique) in Stockholm from 1968 to 1970 and Vice CEO of Atlas Copco AB from 1970 to 1974. Wallenberg was industrial advisor to the Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) from 1974. For a long time he stood in the shadow of his father, who made his oldest son Marc his apprentice and doubted his youngest son Peter&#x27;s abilities. Only in 1982, after his father&#x27;s death, did he become a prominent member of the Wallenberg clan. After his father&#x27;s death, Peter Wallenberg bought out Volvo&#x27;s shares in two family businesses and merged the three family investment firms, Investor AB, Providentia and Export Invest. He served as chairman of Investor AB for ten years, during which time he internationalised the firm and set in motion international mergers that created companies such as ABB, AstraZeneca and Stora Enso.

He was also chairman of the International Council of Swedish Industry (NIR), Swedish-French Research Association (&quot;Svensk-franska forskningsföreningen&quot;) and the Swedish-British Society as well as the Royal Lawn Tennis Club (&quot;Kungliga Lawn Tennis Klubben&quot;). Wallenberg was also honorary chairman of the Swedish Tennis Association (&quot;Svenska Tennisförbundet&quot;) and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences.

Wallenberg was in the early 1990s the chairman of the board of ASEA AB, Atlas Copco AB, Investor AB, STORA, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and co-chairman of ABB Asea Brown Boveri. He was first vice chairman of SEB, vice chairman of AB Electrolux, Incentive AB, AB SKF and Telefon AB LM Ericsson. Wallenberg was also board member of the Federation of Swedish Industries, Nobel Foundation, Scandinavian Airlines, Swedish Intercontinental Airlines, AB Aerotransport, the Swedish National Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and Immediate Past President of the ICC in Paris. He was also board member of the Stockholm School of Economics Association, Dillon, Read &amp; Co. in the United States, Per Jacobsson Foundation in the United States, Lauder Institute and the Swiss Bank Corporation Advisory Board in Switzerland. Until his death he also directed several of the Wallenberg family foundations, in particular the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation. The Peter Wallenberg, D.Econ, Foundation for Economics and Technology (&quot;Ekon.dr Peter Wallenbergs Stiftelse för Ekonomi och Teknik&quot;) was founded in 1996 to honour him on his 70th birthday.

==Personal life and death==
Wallenberg was in his first marriage married 1954–1962 to Suzanne Grevillius (born 1933), the daughter of chief physician Åke Grevillius and Sylvia (née Stenhammar). Together they had three children: Jacob Wallenberg (born 1956), Andrea Gandet (born 1957) and Peter Wallenberg, Jr. (born 1959). In his second marriage he was married 1966–1969 to Alice Pearce Rosier (1944–1970) and the third marriage 1971–1980 to the judge Anna-Maria Eek (born 1927).

Wallenberg died in his residence in Värmdö on 19 January 2015 at the age of 88. The funeral was held in Katarina Church in Stockholm on 4 February 2015.

<doc id="1194520" wikidata="Q3432247" url="?curid=1194520" title="Marc Wallenberg">
<text>Marc &quot;Boy-boy&quot; Wallenberg (28 June 1924 – 19 November 1971) was a Swedish banker and business manager. A member of the prominent Wallenberg family, Marc Wallenberg was CEO of Stockholms Enskilda Bank until his death in 1971.

==Early life==
Wallenberg was born in London, United Kingdom, the eldest son of Swedish banker Marcus Wallenberg (1899–1982) and Dorothy Mackay (1900–1984) from Scotland. He was the brother of Peter Wallenberg (1926–2015) and Ann-Mari Wallenberg (born 1929). Wallenberg passed &quot;studentexamen&quot; in 1943 and graduated from Harvard Business School in 1949 before bank studies in New York City, Geneva, Paris, London and Düsseldorf from 1949 to 1952, all according to his father&#x27;s plan.

==Career==
Wallenberg became deputy director of the family bank Stockholms Enskilda Bank in 1953 and became director and member of its board two years later. In 1956 he became vice CEO and in 1958 he became CEO.

He was a board member of AB Svenska järnvägsverkstäderna, and he became vice chairman of the Swedish Bankers&#x27; Association (&quot;Svenska Bankföreningen&quot;) in 1959 and its chairman in 1961. Wallenberg was appointed by the School of Economics and Business as a member of the Stockholm School of Economics Board of Directors which is Stockholm School of Economics highest executive agency, where he was treasurer from 1965 to 1971. At the time of his death in 1971, Wallenberg was on the boards of 67 companies.

==Personal life==
In 1955 he married Olga Wehtje (born 1930), the daughter of director Walter Wehtje and Gurli Bergström. They had four children; Marcus (born 1956), Axel (1958–2011), Mariana (born 1965, married Risberg) and Caroline (born 1968, married Ankarcrona).

==Death==
On Thursday, 18 November 1971, the family bank held an ordinary board meeting. In the morning, Wallenberg flew from Värnamo, where he had participated in a corporate debate the day before. At the debate, he was asked why the Wallenberg Group had started construction of a new pulp mill in Hyltebruk, despite it not yet having been authorized. His answer to the question was rash, responding that he would rather be prosecuted for an environmental crime than be forced to pay damages to a mass buyer for breach of contract. The statement was big news in the press and he was criticized by his father at the board meeting. In the evening, he left a reception at the Italian Embassy and he did not come home for the night. The next day his car was found at Lake Orlången in Huddinge. Jacob Palmstierna and Peder Bonde, both Deputy CEO&#x27;s of SEB, arrived at the site at 12 o&#x27;clock and were the first to see Wallenberg&#x27;s dead body near his car and could confirm his identity. Wallenberg had taken his own life using a hunting rifle.

It cannot be determined what influence stress due to the bank merger might have had on his decision to commit suicide. His workload was great and the expectations and pressure on him were no less. Marcus Wallenberg considered that his son&#x27;s prolonged cold and medication with sulfa drugs might have been fatal. Another reason is thought to be depression. In his memoirs, Lars-Erik Thunholm testified that Marc Wallenberg&#x27;s suicide was due to the fact that he, like his uncle Jacob Wallenberg, was against the merger with Skandinaviska Banken, contrary to his father&#x27;s intentions to go ahead with the agreement. To confront his father with his idea was impossible for Marc and he chose suicide. Although it is likely that Wallenberg died on 18 November, the official death day was set to 19 November 1971, the day when he was found dead. The day the family chose to indicate on his tombstone is, however, 18 November. The 19 November, is dynasty founder André Oscar Wallenberg&#x27;s birthday, an important day for the family, which has always been celebrated.

<doc id="1194521" wikidata="Q3843128" url="?curid=1194521" title="Maggi Hambling">
<text>Margaret J. Hambling (born 23 October 1945) is a British artist. Though principally a painter her best-known public works are the sculptures &quot;A Conversation with Oscar Wilde&quot; and &quot;A Sculpture for Mary Wollstonecraft&quot; in London, and the 4-metre-high steel &quot;Scallop&quot; on Aldeburgh beach. All three works have attracted controversy.

==Early life and education==
Maggi Hambling was born in Sudbury, Suffolk to Barclays bank cashier and local politician Harry Smyth Leonard Hambling (1902–1998) and Marjorie (née Harris: 1907–1988). She had two siblings, a sister, Ann, who was 11 years older, and a brother, Roger, nine years older than Hambling. Her brother had wanted a younger brother but ignored the fact that his new sibling was female and taught her carpentry and &quot;how to wring a chicken&#x27;s neck.&quot; Hambling was close to her mother who taught ballroom dancing and took Hambling along to be her partner. It was from her father that she inherited her artistic skills. She was not as close to him as she was to her mother but when her father retired at the age of 60, she gave him some oil paints and discovered that he had a knack for painting; he went on to have seven well-received solo shows, and exhibited twice at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition; his paintings were owned by George Melly, Delia Smith, and Paul Bailey, among others, and are held in public and private collections including in America and Australia.

Hambling first studied art under Yvonne Drewry at the Amberfield School in Nacton. She then studied at the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing from 1960 under Cedric Morris and Lett Haines at Benton End, then at Ipswich School of Art (1962–64), Camberwell (1964–67), and finally the Slade School of Art (1967–69) at UCL, graduating in 1969.

==Career==
Hambling is known for her intricate land and seascapes, including a celebrated series of North Sea paintings. Among her portraits, several works are held by the National Portrait Gallery, London.

In 1980 Hambling became the first artist in residence at the National Gallery, after which she produced a series of portraits of the comedian Max Wall. Wall responded to Hambling&#x27;s request to paint him with a letter saying: &quot;Re: painting little me, I am flattered indeed – what colour?&quot; She has taught at Wimbledon School of Art.

Women feature prominently in her portrait series. Hambling was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to paint Professor Dorothy Hodgkin in 1985. The portrait features Hodgkin at a desk with four hands, all engaged in different tasks. Her wider body of work is held in many public collections including the British Museum, Tate Collection, National Gallery, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Hambling is known for painting the dead, including portraits of her parents and Henrietta Moraes in their coffins, saying that she &quot;found it rather therapeutic to go on painting them after death&quot;. George Melly was the subject of a series that documented his approach to death, and said she would go down in history as &quot;Maggi &#x27;coffin&#x27; Hambling&quot;. Some of her recent work is spurred through anger—for the destruction of the planet, about politics, for social issues. She has also said that &quot;Making a work of art is making a work of love.&quot;

In 2013, she exhibited at Snape during the Aldeburgh Festival, and a solo exhibition was held at the Hermitage, St Petersburg.

Hambling is a patron of Paintings in Hospitals, a charity that provides art for health and social care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

==Works of public sculpture==
===Memorial to Oscar Wilde===

Hambling&#x27;s 1998 outdoor sculpture at Charing Cross in central London as a memorial to dramatist Oscar Wilde, the first public monument to him outside his native Ireland.

Derek Jarman first suggested a memorial in the 1980s and a committee chaired by Sir Jeremy Isaacs including actors Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen and the poet Seamus Heaney, raised the money and commissioned Hambling. Her design features Wilde rising from a polished green granite coffin holding a cigarette. The coffin is intended to serve as a public bench rather than the more conventional stone plinth, hence Hambling&#x27;s name for the memorial A Conversation with Oscar Wilde, as visitors sit next to the writer&#x27;s effigy. The work bears a quotation from &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;: &quot;We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars.&quot;

Some critics were severe in their criticism of the work, but supporters said it was well-loved by the public. The chief art critic of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that ultimately the sculpture was not about Wilde or the viewing public, but a reflection of Hambling herself. The cigarette was repeatedly removed, &quot;the most frequent act of vandalism/veneration to a public statue in London&quot;, and is now no longer replaced.

===Memorial to Benjamin Britten===


&quot;Scallop&quot; (2003) celebrates the composer Benjamin Britten and stands on the beach outside Aldeburgh, Suffolk, near Britten&#x27;s homes and not far from Hambling&#x27;s village. The cast stainless steel sculpture is in the form of the two fractured halves of a scallop shell, etched with the quotation from Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;: &quot;I hear those voices that will not be drowned.&quot;

Hambling describes &quot;Scallop&quot; as a conversation with the sea:
:&quot;An important part of my concept is that at the centre of the sculpture, where the sound of the waves and the winds are focused, a visitor may sit and contemplate the mysterious power of the sea.&quot;

Opponents claimed the sculpture ruined a previously unspoilt stretch of beach. A local petition against it attracted several hundred signatures and it has been vandalised a number of times.

For this work, Hambling received the 2006 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture.

===Memorial to Mary Wollstonecraft===

In May 2018, Hambling was chosen to create a statue commemorating Mary Wollstonecraft, the “foremother of feminism”. The &quot;Mary on the Green&quot; campaign was working to erect a permanent memorial to the philosopher and author of &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; since 2011. It chose Hambling for the sculpture unanimously. Hambling&#x27;s design features a figure – described as an everywoman – emerging out of organic matter. It is inspired by Wollstonecraft&#x27;s claim to be “the first of a new genus”. Wollstonecraft&#x27;s famous quotation, “I do not wish women to have power over men but over themselves”, appears on the plinth.

The work, &quot;A Sculpture for Mary Wollstonecraft&quot;, was unveiled in Newington Green, north London, on 10 November 2020, across from the Newington Green Unitarian Church, where Wollstonecraft worshipped. Newington Green is known as the birthplace of feminism because of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s roots there and is where Wollstonecraft moved her school for girls from Islington in 1784.

The sculpture sparked a backlash. British feminist author Caroline Criado Perez called it &quot;catastrophically wrong&quot; and said, &quot;I honestly feel that actually this representation is insulting to [Wollstonecraft]. I can&#x27;t see her feeling happy to be represented by this naked, perfectly formed wet dream of a woman.&quot; Hambling defended her decision, saying that &quot;clothes would have restricted her. Statues in historic costume look like they belong to history because of their clothes. It&#x27;s crucial that she is &#x27;now&#x27;.&quot; The design of the statue was in deliberate opposition to &quot;traditional male heroic statuary&quot; of the Victorian era, the campaigners behind it describing the figure as someone who has &quot;evolved organically from, is supported by, and does not forget, all her predecessors.&quot;

==Awards==
In 1995, she was awarded the Jerwood Painting Prize (with Patrick Caulfield). In the same year she was awarded an OBE for her services to painting. In 2005, she received the Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture for &quot;Scallop&quot;.

In the 2010 New Year Honours, she was awarded a CBE for services to art.

==Personal life==
Hambling described herself as &quot;lesbionic&quot; (her adjective). She formed a relationship with a fellow artist, Victoria (“Tory”) Dennistoun, from a family of horse racing jockeys and trainers, who was married to John Lawrence (later Lord Oaksey), aristocrat and horse racing journalist. Lord and Lady Oaksey&#x27;s &quot;marriage broke up in unhappily public fashion in the mid-1980s&quot;. Tory Lawrence and Hambling have been together ever since, living in a cottage near Saxmundham in Suffolk. The house was left to Hambling by Lady Gwatkin (Isolen Mary June Wilson), widow of Norman Gwatkin.

For the last year of the life of Henrietta Moraes, she and Hambling were in a relationship. The artists&#x27; model, Soho muse, and memoirist died in 1999 and Hambling produced a posthumous volume of charcoal portraits of her.

She once said that she would not speak during a television show if she could not smoke. The camerawoman had stated she would not work with someone who did; Hambling stuck to her word and did not speak.

==Political views==
Hambling gave up smoking in 2004 and was involved in the campaign against the total ban on smoking in public places in England which took effect on 1 July 2007. Speaking at a news conference at the House of Commons on 7 February 2007, she said: &quot;I wholeheartedly support the campaign against a ban on smoking in public places. Just because I gave up at 59, other people may choose not to. There must be freedom of choice, something that is fast disappearing in this so-called free country.&quot; She took up smoking again on her 65th birthday but only &#x27;the ones that smell of toothpaste&#x27;.

In August 2014, Hambling was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

<text>Lerik District () is one of the 66 districts of Azerbaijan. It is located in the southeast of the country and belongs to the Lankaran-Astara Economic Region. The district borders the districts of Yardimli, Masally, Lankaran, Astara and the Ardabil Province of Iran. Its capital and largest city is Lerik. As of 2022, the district had a population of 87,000. It is located between the Talysh Mountains and the agricultural plain of the Lankaran Lowland.

== History ==
Lerik district was established in August 1930. It was called &quot;Zuvand District&quot; until January 1938. 29 municipalities operate in the district. The district includes a city and 162 villages with a total area of 1084 square kilometer. In accordance with the presidential decree dated June 13, 2008, the settlement of Lerik was granted the status of a city.

Different items belonging to the Stone Age were found in the Lerik district. The cave called “Buzeyir” is the oldest settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan. In the 18th-19th centuries, French archaeologist Jacques de Morgan, K. Schaffer and his brother Henri called this territory &quot;archaeological paradise&quot; during archaeological excavations. Morgan has conducted archaeological excavations at the Gizilbashlar cemetery in the village of Veri of Lerik.

<doc id="1194525" wikidata="Q6218624" url="?curid=1194525" title="John Alexander Sinton">
<text>Brigadier John Alexander Sinton (2 December 1884 – 25 March 1956) was a British medical doctor, malariologist, soldier, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Sinton was born in Victoria, British Columbia, the third of the seven children of Walter Lyon Sinton (1860–1930) and his wife, Isabella Mary, née Pringle (1860–1924), a family of Quaker linen manufacturers from Northern Ireland. On his mother&#x27;s side he was a cousin of James Pringle, and a nephew of Thomas Sinton and cousin of Ernest Walton on his father&#x27;s. In 1890 they returned to Ulster where he was educated and lived for the rest of his life. He studied at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and read medicine at the Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast, where he graduated in 1908 as first in his year. He went on to attain degrees from the University of Cambridge (1910) and the University of Liverpool (1911).

Sinton joined the Indian Medical Service in 1911, coming first in the entrance examinations, but before being posted to India was seconded as the Queen&#x27;s University research scholar to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine where his contact with Sir Ronald Ross may have influenced his later career as a malariologist.

==Military career==
Sinton was 31 years old and a captain in the Indian Medical Service (IMS), Indian Army, during the First World War. On 21 January 1916 at the Orah Ruins, Mesopotamia, Captain Sinton attended to the wounded under very heavy fire and the citation to his VC reads:
Sinton later achieved the rank of brigadier (1943), was awarded the Russian Order of St George and mentioned in dispatches six times.

In 1921 he transferred from the military to the civil branch of the IMS which he continued to serve with until 1936.
==Medical career==
In July 1921 he was put in charge of the quinine and malaria inquiry under the newly formed Central Malaria Bureau. He was appointed the first director of the malaria survey of India at Kasauli in 1925 where he worked with Sir S. R. Christophers.

He became Manson fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and at the malaria laboratory of the Ministry of Health at Horton Hospital, near Epsom. He also became adviser on malaria to the Ministry of Health. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Sinton was recalled as an IMS reservist and commanded a hospital in India. At the age of fifty-five he was again retired, but was appointed consultant malariologist to the east African force and later to Middle East command, retiring with the honorary rank of brigadier in August 1943.

He then worked as consultant malariologist to the War Office, travelling widely to Assam, Australia, Burma, Ceylon, India, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, where his expertise in malaria was invaluable. Further military decorations resulted from this period, after which Sinton returned to Northern Ireland and retired to Cookstown. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1946.

==Other activities==
Sinton is the only Fellow of the Royal Society to have received a Victoria Cross. In his retirement he served as Deputy Lieutenant for County Tyrone and, in 1953, as High Sheriff of Tyrone.

At Kasauli, Sinton met Eadith Seymour Steuart-Martin (1894–1977), daughter of Edwin Steuart-Martin and Ada May Martin (née Martin), whom he married on 19 September 1923. Their daughter, Eleanor Isabel Mary Sinton, was born at Kasauli on 9 December 1924.

His name is remembered in Sinton Halls, a student housing block at the Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast, where he sat on the senate and was a Pro-Chancellor. The Sinton Medical and Dental Centre at Thiepval Barracks, Lisburn is also named in his honour. Others honoured Sinton by naming three mosquito species, &quot;Aedes sintoni&quot;, &quot;Anopheles sintoni&quot;, and &quot;Anopheles sintonoides&quot;, one sandfly species, &quot;Sergentomyia sintoni&quot;, and one subgenus &quot;Sintonius&quot; of the genus &quot;Phlebotomus&quot;, after him.

Stinton described and named the species &quot;Phlebotomus (Paraphlebotomus) alexandri&quot;. and &quot;Prowazekia urinaria&quot; (now &quot;Parabodo caudatus&quot;).

He died at his home at Slaghtfreedan Lodge, Cookstown, County Tyrone, on 25 March 1956 and was buried with full military honours on 28 March at Claggan Presbyterian cemetery in Cookstown. Colonel H. W. Mulligan in an obituary in the British Medical Journal described him thus:
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum at Aldershot.

<doc id="1194538" wikidata="Q3622538" url="?curid=1194538" title="Lucius Trebius Germanus">
<text>Lucius Trebius Germanus was a governor of Roman Britain in 127, and suffect consul with Gaius Calpurnius Flaccus, the proconsul of Cyprus in 123, at an uncertain date. He is known from a military diploma published in 1997 that bears the date 20 August 127.

Anthony Birley provides further information on Trebius Germanus. He is mentioned in the &quot;Digest&quot;, which cites a legal decision Trebius Germanus made while governor of an unnamed province, not necessarily Roman Britain, condemning a slave boy to death for failing to call for help when his owner was murdered. Birley also notes that Trebius Germanus is a member of a small group of three consuls appointed to the office in a ten-year period who share the same gentilicium -- the others being Gaius Trebius Maximus (suffect consul 121 or 122) and Gaius Trebius Sergianus (consul 132) -- while adding Ronald Syme&#x27;s observations that &quot;&#x27;the obscure Trebii... are the first and last consuls of that name&#x27;; elsewhere he called them &#x27;a unique and isolated group&#x27;&quot;. Birley speculates on the place of origin for these three consulars, finding less prominent Trebii attested in Italy, Spain, Gaul, and Dalmatia, but preferring none of these.

Birley offers a few more speculations about Trebius Germanus. He suggests that his tenure as governor followed immediately on his predecessor, Aulus Platorius Nepos, and lasted three years from 125 to 127; the military diploma would date from towards the end of his tenure. Birley also suggests that he may be the governor in whose name a broken and now lost inscription found at Bewcastle was made. Prior to the discovery of this military diploma, Birley had speculated it might have contained the name of the other three governors then attested under Hadrian -- Nepos, Julius Severus, and Mummius Sisenna, or another consular, Gaius Nonius Proculus, who held the consulship in some undetermined &quot;nundinium&quot; between AD 50 and 150.

<text>John Kendrick Skinner VC, DCM (5 February 1883 – 17 March 1918) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Skinner was born in Shore Street, Inver, near Tain to Walter C. Skinner, a tailor&#x27;s cutter, and Mary Skinner née Kendrick. He was educated at Queen&#x27;s Park Higher Grade School and Allan Glen&#x27;s School in Glasgow.

Skinner was an acting Company Sergeant Major in the 1st Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, British Army, when he became the recipient of the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Battle of Passchendaele on 18 August 1917 at Wijdendrift, Belgium.

His citation reads:

C.S.M Skinner received the medal from King George V at an investiture in Buckingham Palace on 26 September 1917. Following the investiture he was granted the customary fourteen days&#x27; leave after which he was posted to the Reserve Battalion in Edinburgh. A few days later, however, he was seen in the line, having risked a court-martial to return to his men.

He was killed in action at Vlamertinghe, Belgium, on 17 March 1918, when trying to rescue a wounded man and was buried at Vlamertinghe New British Cemetery, Belgium, west of Ypres, in Plot XVI, Row H, Grave 15. His pallbearers were six fellow-VCs with three others in attendance.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Kings Own Scottish Borderers, in Berwick Barracks, Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland, England.

<doc id="1194551" wikidata="Q372748" url="?curid=1194551" title="Adrian Carton de Wiart">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Adrian Paul Ghislain Carton de Wiart, (; 5 May 1880 – 5 June 1963) was an officer in the British Army. He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; in various Commonwealth countries. He served in the Boer War, First World War, and Second World War. He was shot in the face, head, stomach, ankle, leg, hip, and ear; was blinded in his left eye; survived two plane crashes; tunnelled out of a prisoner-of-war camp; and tore off his own severely injured fingers when a doctor declined to amputate them. Describing his experiences in the First World War, he wrote, &quot;Frankly, I had enjoyed the war.&quot;

After returning home from service (including a period as a prisoner-of-war) in the Second World War, he was sent to China as Winston Churchill&#x27;s personal representative. While &quot;en route&quot; he attended the Cairo Conference.

In his memoirs, Carton de Wiart wrote, &quot;Governments may think and say as they like, but force cannot be eliminated, and it is the only real and unanswerable power. We are told that the pen is mightier than the sword, but I know which of these weapons I would choose.&quot; Carton de Wiart was thought to be a model for the character of Brigadier Ben Ritchie-Hook in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s trilogy &quot;Sword of Honour&quot;. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; described him thus: &quot;With his black eyepatch and empty sleeve, Carton de Wiart looked like an elegant pirate, and became a figure of legend.&quot;

==Early life==
=== Background ===
Carton de Wiart was born into an aristocratic family in Brussels, on 5 May 1880, as the eldest son of Léon Constant Ghislain Carton de Wiart (1854–1915), a lawyer and magistrate, and Ernestine Wenzig (1860–1886), although at the time he was widely believed to be an illegitimate son of King Leopold II of the Belgians. He spent his early days in Belgium and in England; the &#x27;loss of his mother&#x27; when he was six prompted his father to move the family to Cairo so his father could practise at Egypt&#x27;s mixed courts. This led early biographers to assume that his mother had died in 1886; however, in later research it was established that his parents had in fact divorced in that year and that his mother remarried Demosthenes Gregory Cuppa later in 1886. In his position as a lawyer, magistrate, and a director of the Cairo Electric Railways and Heliopolis Oases Company, his father was well connected in Egyptian governmental circles. Adrian Carton de Wiart learned to speak Arabic.

Carton de Wiart was a Roman Catholic. In 1891, his English stepmother sent him to a boarding school in England, the Roman Catholic Oratory School, founded by John Henry Newman. From there, he went to Balliol College, Oxford, but left around 1899, just before or during the Second Boer War, to join the British Army. He falsified his name and age, signing up as &quot;Trooper Carton&quot; and claiming to be 25 years old where his actual age was no more than 20.

=== Second Boer War ===
Carton de Wiart was wounded in the stomach and groin in South Africa early in the Second Boer War and was invalided home. His father was furious when he learned his son had abandoned his studies, but allowed him to remain in the army. After another brief period at Oxford, where Aubrey Herbert was among his friends, he was given a commission in the Second Imperial Light Horse. He saw action in South Africa again, and on 14 September 1901 was given a regular commission as a second lieutenant in the 4th Dragoon Guards. Carton de Wiart was transferred to India in 1902. He enjoyed sports, especially shooting and pig sticking.
==Character, interests, and life in the Edwardian army==
Carton de Wiart&#x27;s serious wound in the Boer War instilled in him a strong desire for physical fitness and he ran, jogged, walked, and played sports on a regular basis. In male company he was &quot;a delightful character and must hold the world record for bad language.&quot;

After his regiment was transferred to South Africa he was promoted to lieutenant on 16 July 1904 and appointed an aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Hildyard, the following July. He describes this period lasting up to 1914 as his &quot;Heyday&quot;, the title of Chapter 3 of his autobiography. His light duties as aide-de-camp gave him time for polo, another of his interests. By 1907, although by then having served in the British Army for eight years, he had remained a Belgian subject. On 13 September of that year, he took the oath of allegiance to Edward VII and was formally naturalised as a British subject.

In 1908, he married Countess Friederike Maria Karoline Henriette Rosa Sabina Franziska Fugger von Babenhausen (1887 Klagenfurt – 1949 Vienna), the eldest daughter of Karl, 5th Prince Fugger von Babenhausen and Princess Eleonora zu Hohenlohe-Bartenstein und Jagstberg of Klagenfurt, Austria. They had two daughters; the eldest, Anita (born 1909, deceased), was to be the maternal grandmother of the war correspondent Anthony Loyd (born 1966).

Carton de Wiart was already well-connected in European circles, his two closest cousins being Count Henri Carton de Wiart, Prime Minister of Belgium from 1920 to 1921, and Baron , political secretary to the King of Belgium and director of La Société Générale de Belgique. While on leave, he travelled extensively throughout central Europe, using his Catholic aristocratic connections to shoot at country estates in Bohemia, Austria, Hungary, and Bavaria. Following his return to England, he rode with the famous Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Hunt where he met, among others, the future field marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson and the future air marshal Sir Edward Ellington. He was promoted to the rank of captain on 26 February 1910. The Duke of Beaufort was the honorary colonel of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, and from 1 January 1912 until his departure for Somaliland in 1914 Carton de Wiart served as the regiment&#x27;s adjutant.

==First World War==
=== Somaliland Campaign ===
When the First World War broke out, Carton de Wiart was en route to British Somaliland where a low-level war was underway against the followers of Dervish leader Mohammed bin Abdullah, called the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot; by the British. Carton de Wiart had been seconded to the Somaliland Camel Corps. In an attack upon an enemy fort at Shimber Berris, Carton de Wiart was shot twice in the face, losing his eye and a portion of his ear. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 15 May 1915. Upon hearing of the death of the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot;, Carton de Wiart stated that he &quot;felt a sense of real personal loss&quot;, for the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot; was &quot;a godsend to officers with an urge to fight and a shaky or non-existent bank balance&quot;. 

=== Western Front ===
In February 1915, he embarked on a steamer heading for France. Carton de Wiart took part in the fighting on the Western Front, commanding successively three infantry battalions and a brigade. He was wounded seven more times in the war, losing his left hand in 1915 and pulling off his fingers when a doctor declined to remove them. He was shot through the skull and ankle at the Battle of the Somme, through the hip at the Battle of Passchendaele, through the leg at Cambrai, and through the ear at Arras. He went to the Sir Douglas Shield&#x27;s Nursing Home to recover from his injuries.

===Victoria Cross===
Carton de Wiart received the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in combat that can be awarded to British Empire forces, in 1916. He was 36 years old, and a temporary lieutenant-colonel in the 4th Dragoon Guards (Royal Irish), British Army, attached to the Gloucestershire Regiment, commanding the 8th Battalion, when the following events took place on 2/3 July 1916 at La Boiselle, France, as recorded in the official citation:

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum in Chelsea.

===1916–1918===

Carton de Wiart was promoted to temporary major in March 1916, and to the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel on 18 July, was brevetted to major on 1 January 1917 and was promoted to temporary brigadier general on 12 January 1917. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the Crown of Belgium in April 1917. On 3 June 1917, Carton de Wiart was brevetted to lieutenant-colonel. On 18 July, he was promoted to the substantive rank of major in the Dragoon Guards. He was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre in March 1918, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List in June.

On 8 November, just three days before the end of the war, Carton de Wiart was given command of a brigade with the rank of temporary brigadier general. A.S. Bullock gives a vivid first-hand description of his arrival: &#x27;Cold shivers went down the back of everyone in the brigade, for he had an unsurpassed record as a fire eater, missing no chance of throwing the men under his command into whatever fighting happened to be going.&#x27; Bullock recalls how the battalion looked &#x27;very much the worse for wear&#x27; when they paraded for the brigadier general&#x27;s inspection. He arrived &#x27;on a lively cob with his cap tilted at a rakish angle, and a shade over the place where one of his eyes had been&#x27;. He was also missing two limbs and had eleven wound stripes. Bullock, the first man in line for the inspection, notes that Carton de Wiart, despite having only one eye, ordered him to get his bootlace changed.

==Post-First World War era and the Polish mission==

At the end of the war Carton de Wiart was sent to Poland as second in command of the British-Poland Military Mission under General Louis Botha. Carton de Wiart was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1919 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List. After a brief period, he replaced General Botha in the mission to Poland.

Poland desperately needed support, as it was engaged with Bolshevik Russia in the Polish-Soviet War, the Ukrainians in the Polish-Ukrainian War, the Lithuanians in the Polish-Lithuanian War, and the Czechs in the Czech-Polish border conflicts. There he met pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Marshal Józef Piłsudski, the Chief of State and military commander, and General Maxime Weygand, head of the French military mission in mid-1920. The Ukrainian nationalists under Simon Petlyura were besieging the city of Lwów (; ). One of his tasks soon after Carton de Wiart&#x27;s arrival was to attempt to make peace between the Poles and the Ukrainians; the peace talks were unsuccessful.

From there, he went on to Paris to report to the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George and to General Sir Henry Wilson, regarding the Polish situation. Lloyd George was not sympathetic to Poland and, much to Carton de Wiart&#x27;s annoyance, Britain sent next to no military supplies. Then he went back to Poland and many more front line adventures, this time in the Bolshevik zone, where the situation was grave and Warsaw threatened. During this time he had significant interaction with the nuntius (dean of the Vatican diplomatic corps) Cardinal Achille Ratti, later Pius XI, who wanted Carton de Wiart&#x27;s advice as to whether to evacuate the diplomatic corps from Warsaw. The diplomats moved to Poznań, but the Italians remained in Warsaw along with Ratti.

From all these affairs, Carton de Wiart developed a sympathy with the Poles and supported their claims to eastern Galicia. This caused disagreement with Lloyd George at their next meeting, but was appreciated by the Poles. At one time during his Warsaw stay he was a second in a duel between Polish members of the Mysliwski Club, the other second being Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, later commander-in-chief of Finnish armies in World War II and President of Finland. Norman Davies reports that he (Carton de Wiart) was &quot;compromised in a gun-running operation from Budapest using stolen wagon-lits&quot;.

He became close to the Polish leader, Marshal Piłsudski. After an aircraft crash occasioning a brief period in Lithuanian captivity, he went back to England to report, this time to the Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill. He passed on to Churchill Piłsudski&#x27;s prediction that the White Russian offensive under General Anton Denikin directed at Moscow would fail, and it did shortly thereafter. Churchill was more sympathetic to Polish needs than Lloyd George and succeeded, over Lloyd George&#x27;s objections, in sending some materiel to Poland.

On 27 July 1920, Carton de Wiart was appointed an aide-de-camp to the king, and brevetted to colonel. He was active in August 1920, when the Red Army was at the gates of Warsaw. While out on his observation train, he was attacked by a group of Red cavalry, and fought them off with his revolver from the footplate of his train, at one point falling on the track and re-boarding quickly.

When the Poles won the war, the British Military Mission was wound up. Carton de Wiart was promoted to temporary brigadier general and also appointed to the local rank of major general on 1 January. He was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel on 21 June 1922, with seniority from 27 July 1920 and relinquished his local rank of major general on 1 April 1923, going on half-pay as a colonel at the same time. Carton de Wiart officially retired from the army on 19 December, with the honorary rank of major general.

==Polish gentleman (1924–1939) ==
His last Polish aide de camp was Prince Karol Mikołaj Radziwiłł, member of the Radziwiłł family who inherited a large estate in eastern Poland when the communists killed his uncle. They became friends and Carton de Wiart was given the use of a large estate called Prostyń, in the Pripet Marshes, a wetland area larger than Ireland and surrounded by water and forests. In this location Carton de Wiart spent the rest of the interwar years. In his memoirs he said &quot;In my fifteen years in the marshes I did not waste one day without hunting&quot;.

After 15 years, Carton de Wiart&#x27;s peaceful Polish life was interrupted by the looming war, when he was recalled in July 1939 and appointed to his old job, as head of the British Military Mission to Poland. Poland was attacked by Nazi Germany on 1 September and on 17 September the Soviets allied with Germany attacked Poland from the east. Soon Soviet forces overran Prostyń and Carton de Wiart lost all his guns, fishing rods, clothing, and furniture. They were packed up by the Soviets and stored in the Minsk Museum, but destroyed by the Germans in later fighting. He never saw the area again, but as he said &quot;they did not manage to take my memories&quot;.

==Second World War==
===Polish campaign (1939)===
Carton de Wiart met with the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły, in late August 1939 and formed a rather low opinion of his capabilities. He strongly urged Rydz-Śmigły to pull Polish forces back beyond the Vistula River, but was unsuccessful. The other advice he offered, to have the seagoing units of the Polish fleet leave the Baltic Sea, was, after much argument, finally adopted. This fleet made a significant contribution to the Allied cause, especially the several modern destroyers and submarines.

As Polish resistance weakened, Carton de Wiart evacuated the British Mission from Warsaw along with the Polish government, with both the Germans and the Soviets in pursuit. His car convoy was attacked by the Luftwaffe on the road, and the wife of one of his aides was killed, and he was in danger of arrest in Romania and only got out by aircraft on 21 September with a false passport—just in time, as the pro-Allied Romanian prime minister, Armand Calinescu, was assassinated that very day.

===Norwegian campaign (1940)===

Recalled to a special appointment in the army in the autumn of 1939, Carton de Wiart reverted to his former rank of colonel, and was granted the rank of acting major general on 28 November. After a brief stint in command of the 61st Division in the English Midlands, Carton de Wiart was summoned in April 1940 to take charge of a hastily drawn together Anglo-French force to occupy Namsos, a small town in middle Norway. His orders were to take the city of Trondheim, 125 miles (200 km) to the south, in conjunction with a naval attack and an advance from the south by troops landed at Åndalsnes. He flew to Namsos to reconnoitre the location before the troops arrived. When his Short Sunderland flying boat landed, it was attacked by a German fighter and his aide was wounded and had to be evacuated. After the French Alpine troops landed (without their transport mules and missing straps for their skis), the Luftwaffe bombed and destroyed the town of Namsos.

Despite these handicaps, Carton de Wiart managed to move his forces over the mountains and down to Trondheimsfjord, where they were shelled by German destroyers. They had no artillery to challenge the German ships. It soon became apparent that the whole Norwegian campaign was fast becoming a failure. The naval attack on Trondheim, the reason for the Namsos landing, did not happen and his troops were exposed without guns, transport, air cover, or skis in a foot and a half of snow. They were being attacked by German ski troops, machine gunned and bombed from the air, and the German Navy was landing troops to his rear. He recommended withdrawal but was asked to hold his position for political reasons, which he did.

After orders and counterorders from London, the decision to evacuate was made. However, on the date set to evacuate the troops, the ships did not appear. The next night a naval force finally arrived, led through the fog by Lord Louis Mountbatten. The transports successfully evacuated the entire force amid heavy bombardment by the Germans, resulting in the sinking of two destroyers: the French and British . Carton de Wiart arrived back at the British naval base of Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on 5 May 1940, his 60th birthday.

===Northern Ireland===
Carton de Wiart was posted back to the command of the 61st Division, which was soon transferred to Northern Ireland as a defence against invasion. However, following the arrival of Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pownall as Commander-in-Chief in Northern Ireland, Carton de Wiart was told that he was too old to command a division on active duty.

===British military mission to Yugoslavia (1941)===

Advanced to temporary major-general on 28 November 1940, he remained inactive very briefly, as he was appointed as head of the British-Yugoslavian Military Mission on 5 April 1941. Hitler was preparing to invade the country and the Yugoslavs asked for British help. Carton de Wiart travelled in a Vickers Wellington bomber to Belgrade, Serbia to negotiate with the Yugoslavian government. After refuelling in Malta, the aircraft left for Cairo with enemy territory to the north and south. Both engines failed off the coast of Italian-controlled Libya, and the plane crash-landed in the sea about a mile from land. Carton de Wiart was knocked unconscious, but the cold water made him regain consciousness. When the plane broke up and sank, he and the rest aboard were forced to swim to shore. They were captured by the Italian authorities.

===Prisoner of war in Italy (1941–1943)===
Carton de Wiart was a high-profile prisoner. After four months at the Villa Orsini at Sulmona, he was transferred to a special prison for senior officers at Castello di Vincigliata. There were a number of senior officer prisoners here due to the successes achieved by Rommel in North Africa early in 1941. Carton de Wiart made friends, especially with General Sir Richard O&#x27;Connor, The 6th Earl of Ranfurly and Lieutenant-General Philip Neame, VC.
In letters to his wife, Lord Ranfurly described Carton de Wiart in captivity as &quot;a delightful character&quot; and said he &quot;must hold the record for bad language.&quot; Ranfurly was &quot;endlessly amused by him. He really is a nice person – superbly outspoken.&quot; The four were committed to escaping. He made five attempts, including seven months tunnelling. Carton de Wiart once evaded capture for eight days disguised as an Italian peasant (he was in northern Italy, could not speak Italian, and was 62 years old, with an eye patch, one empty sleeve and multiple injuries and scars).

Then, in a surprising development, Carton de Wiart was taken from prison in August 1943 and driven to Rome. The Italian government was secretly planning to leave the war and wanted Carton de Wiart to send the message to the British Army about a peace treaty with the UK. Carton de Wiart was to accompany an Italian negotiator, General , to Lisbon to meet Allied contacts to negotiate the surrender. To keep the mission secret, Carton de Wiart was told he needed civilian clothes. Distrusting Italian tailors, he stated that &quot;[he] had no objection, provided [he] did not resemble a gigolo.&quot; In &quot;Happy Odyssey&quot;, he described the resultant suit as being &quot;as good as anything that ever came out of Savile Row.&quot; When they reached Lisbon, Carton de Wiart was released and made his way to England, reaching there on 28 August 1943.

===China mission (1943–1947)===
Within a month of his arrival back in England, Carton de Wiart was summoned to spend a night at the prime minister&#x27;s country home at Chequers. Churchill informed him that he was to be sent to China as his personal representative. He was granted the rank of acting lieutenant-general on 9 October, and left by air for India on 18 October 1943. Anglo-Chinese relations were difficult in World War II as the Kuomintang had long called for the end of British extraterritorial rights in China together with the return of Hong Kong, neither proposal being welcome to Churchill. In early 1942, Churchill had to ask Chiang Kai-shek to send Chinese troops to help the British hold Burma from the Japanese, and following the Japanese conquest of Burma the X Force of five Chinese divisions had ended up in eastern India. Churchill was unhappy with having the X Force defend India as it weakened the prestige of the Raj, and in an attempt to improve relations with China, the prime minister felt a soldier experienced in diplomacy such as Carton de Wiart would be the best man to be his personal representative in China.

As his accommodation in China was not ready, Carton de Wiart spent time in India gaining an understanding of the situation in China, especially being briefed by a genuine &quot;tai-pan&quot;, John Keswick, head of the great China trading empire Jardine Matheson. He met the Viceroy, Field Marshal Viscount Wavell and General Sir Claude Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief in India. He also met Orde Wingate. Before arriving in China, Carton de Wiart attended the 1943 Cairo Conference organized by Churchill, U.S. President Roosevelt and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.

When in Cairo, he took the opportunity to renew his acquaintance with Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly, the wife of his friend from prisoner-of-war days, Dan Ranfurly. Carton de Wiart was one of the few to be able to work with the notoriously difficult commander of US forces in the China-Burma-India Theatre, U.S. Army General Joseph Stilwell. He arrived in the headquarters of the Nationalist Chinese Government, Chongqing, in early December 1943. For the next three years, he was to be involved in a host of reporting, diplomatic and administrative duties in the remote wartime capital. Carton de Wiart became a great admirer of the Chinese people. He wrote that, when he was appointed as Churchill&#x27;s personal representative to Chiang Kai-shek in China, he imagined a country &quot;full of whimsical little people with quaint customs who carved lovely jade ornaments and worshiped their grandmothers.&quot; Once stationed in China, however, he wrote: &quot;Two things struck me forcibly: the first was the amount of sheer hard work the people were doing, and the second their cheerfulness in doing it.&quot;

He regularly flew out to India to liaise with British officials. His old friend, Richard O&#x27;Connor, had escaped from the Italian prisoner-of-war camp and was now in command of British troops in eastern India. The Governor of Bengal, the Australian Richard Casey, became a good friend.

On 9 October 1944, Carton de Wiart was promoted to temporary lieutenant-general and to the war substantive rank of major-general. Carton de Wiart returned home in December 1944 to report to the War Cabinet on the Chinese situation. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1945 New Year Honours. Clement Attlee, when he became head of the Labour government in June 1945, asked Carton de Wiart to stay on in China.

==== South East Asia ====
Carton de Wiart was assigned to a tour of the Burma front, and after meeting Admiral Sir James Somerville, commander-in-chief of the British Eastern Fleet, he was given a front seat on the bridge of the battleship for the bombardment of Sabang in the Netherlands East Indies in 1945, including air battles between Japanese fighters and British carrier aircraft.

A good part of Carton de Wiart&#x27;s reporting had to do with the increasing power of the Chinese Communists. The journalist and historian Max Hastings writes: &quot;De Wiart despised all Communists on principle, denounced Mao Zedong as &#x27;a fanatic&#x27;, and added: &#x27;I cannot believe he means business&#x27;. He told the British cabinet that there was no conceivable alternative to Chiang as ruler of China.&quot; He met Mao Zedong at dinner and had a memorable exchange with him, interrupting his propaganda speech to criticise him for holding back from fighting the Japanese for domestic political reasons. Mao was briefly stunned, and then laughed.

After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, Carton de Wiart flew to Singapore to participate in the formal surrender. After a visit to Peking, he moved to Nanking, the now-liberated Nationalist capital, accompanied by Julian Amery, the British Prime Minister&#x27;s Personal Representative to Chiang. A visit to Tokyo to meet General Douglas MacArthur came at the end of his tenure. He was now 66 and ready to retire, despite the offer of a job by Chiang. Carton de Wiart retired in October 1947, with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general.

==Retirement and death==
En route home via French Indochina, Carton de Wiart stopped in Rangoon as a guest of the army commander. Coming downstairs, he slipped on coconut matting, fell, broke several vertebrae, and knocked himself unconscious. He was admitted to Rangoon Hospital where he was treated. His wife died in 1949. In 1951, at the age of 71, he married Ruth Myrtle Muriel Joan McKechnie, a divorcee known as Joan Sutherland, 23 years his junior (born in late 1903, she died 13 January 2006 at the age of 102). They settled at Aghinagh House, Killinardrish, County Cork, Ireland.

Carton de Wiart died at the age of 83 on 5 June 1963. He left no papers. He and his wife Joan are buried in Caum Churchyard just off the main Macroom road. The grave site is just outside the graveyard wall near the gojo shrine on the grounds of his home, Aghinagh House. Carton de Wiart&#x27;s will was valued at probate in Ireland at £4,158 and England at £3,496.

<text>Vacheron Constantin SA () is a Swiss luxury watch and clock manufacturer founded in 1755. Since 1996, it has been a subsidiary of the Swiss Richemont Group. Vacheron Constantin is one of the oldest watch manufacturers in the world with an uninterrupted watchmaking history since its foundation in 1755. It employs around 1,200 people worldwide as of 2018, most of whom are based in the company&#x27;s manufacturing plants in the Canton of Geneva and Vallée de Joux in Switzerland.

Vacheron Constantin is a highly regarded watchmaker. The Vacheron Constantin pocket watch No. 402833 (1929), which was owned by King Fuad I of Egypt, ranks as one of the most expensive watches ever sold at auction, fetching US$2.77 million (3,306,250 CHF) in Geneva on April 3, 2005. In 2015, Vacheron Constantin introduced the pocket watch Reference 57260, which currently holds the title of the most complicated mechanical watch ever made, with 57 horological complications. In 2024, Vacheron Constantin unveiled Les Cabinotiers - The Berkley Grand Complication, a pocket watch featuring 63 complications, surpassing the previous record set by Reference 57260 with 57 complications. This model includes the very first Chinese perpetual calendar.

==History==
=== Early history ===

The business was founded in 1755 by Jean-Marc Vacheron, an independent watchmaker in Geneva, Switzerland. He was a close friend of leading Enlightenment philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire due to their common interests in philosophy, science and watchmaking. In 1770, Vacheron&#x27;s company created the world&#x27;s first horological complication, and nine years later he designed the first engine-turned dials. The son of Jean-Marc Vacheron, Abraham Vacheron took over the family business in 1785. In 1810, Jacques-Barthélemy Vacheron, the grandson of the founder, became the head of the company. He was the first to initiate the company&#x27;s exports to France and Italy. 
Later, Jacques-Barthélemy realized that he was not able to handle the business alone. In order to travel overseas and sell the company&#x27;s products, he needed a partner. Consequently, in 1819, François Constantin became an associate of Vacheron. The company continued its activities under the new name &quot;Vacheron &amp; Constantin&quot;. The company&#x27;s motto (which remains today), &quot;Faire mieux si possible, ce qui est toujours possible (Do better if possible and that is always possible)&quot;, first appeared in Constantin&#x27;s letter to Jacques-Barthélémy. The letter was dated July 5, 1819.

François Constantin traveled around the world and marketed watches. The main market at the time was North America. In 1833, Vacheron and Constantin hired Georges-Auguste Leschot, whose job was to supervise the manufacturing operations. In particular, Leschot was an inventor and his creations turned out to be a success for the company. His inventions had significant impact on the watchmaking industry in general, and he was the first person to standardize watch movements into Calibers. In 1844, Georges-Auguste Leschot was awarded with a gold medal from the Arts Society of Geneva, which highly appreciated Leschot&#x27;s pantographic device - a device that was able to mechanically engrave small watch parts and dials.

=== Re-organization ===
After François Constantin&#x27;s death in 1854 and Jacques-Barthélemy Vacheron&#x27;s death in 1863, the company was taken over by a series of heirs. At one point, the company was headed by two women. In 1862, Vacheron Constantin became a member of the Association for Research into non-magnetic materials.

In 1877, &quot;Vacheron &amp; Constantin, Fabricants, Geneve&quot; became the official name of the company. In 1880, the company started using the Maltese cross as its symbol until today. This was inspired by a component of the barrel, which had a cross-shape and was used for limiting the tension within the mainspring.

In 1887, Vacheron &amp; Constantin was reorganized into a joint-stock company. Notably, in the same year, Fabergé&#x27;s 1887 Third Imperial Egg contained a Vacheron Constantin Lady&#x27;s watch as the surprise. For the remarkable achievements of the company, Vacheron &amp; Constantin was awarded a gold medal at the Swiss National Exhibition in Geneva in 1887. The first Vacheron &amp; Constantin boutique in Geneva was opened in 1906.

During the Great Depression, Vacheron &amp; Constantin found itself in a difficult situation. In 1936, Charles Constantin became the head of the company, the first time since 1850s that a representative from the Constantin family became the president of Vacheron &amp; Constantin. However, in 1940, Georges Ketterer acquired the majority portion of the stock of Vacheron &amp; Constantin from Charles Constantin.

===Recent development===

George Ketterer died in 1969, and his son, Jacques Ketterer, succeeded as the head of Vacheron &amp; Constantin. In 1970, the company officially changed its name to &quot;Vacheron Constantin&quot;.

Vacheron Constantin was affected by the quartz crisis during 1970s and 1980s. When Jacques Ketterer died in 1987, Vacheron Constantin changed hands. Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the former Oil Minister of Saudi Arabia and avid watch collector, became the company&#x27;s majority shareholder, who then folded Vacheron Constantin into his personal portfolio of holdings. In 1996, the entire share capital of Vacheron Constantin was bought by the Swiss Richemont Group.

In 2004, Vacheron Constantin opened its new headquarters and manufacture in Plan-les-Ouates, Geneva. The Vacheron Constantin headquarters building in Geneva was designed by Bernard Tschumi, and has been noted for its architectural significance. In October 2005, the Richemont Group named Juan Carlos Torres as the chief executive officer of the company. Currently, the company is an active member of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH, and produces about 20,000 timepieces per year.

== Motto and slogan ==
The company motto of Vacheron Constantin is &quot;Faire mieux si possible, ce qui est toujours possible (Do better if possible, and that is always possible)&quot;. The motto first appeared in a François Constantin&#x27;s letter to Jacques-Barthélémy, and the letter was dated July 5, 1819.

Vacheron Constantin was given an average environmental rating as &quot;Upper Midfield&quot;, suggesting that the manufacturer has taken first actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change.

== Notable models ==

=== Most expensive pieces ===

* In 1979, Vacheron Constantin made &quot;Kallista&quot;, one of the most expensive wristwatches in the world. Its initial price was $5 million, but in 2016 the watch was valued at about $11 million. Kallista had 118 emerald-cut diamonds. It took about 6,000 hours for the watch masters to make this watch and about 20 months for jewelers to enrich the watch.
* On April 3, 2005, the Vacheron Constantin pocket watch Ref. 402833 (1929), which was owned by King Fuad I of Egypt, fetched a final price of 2.77 million US dollars (3,306,250 CHF) in Antiquorum&#x27;s Geneva auction.
*On April 3, 2005, a Vacheron Constantin mysterious clock was auctioned by Antiquorum for 1.83 million US dollars (2,206,250 CHF) in Geneva.
* On April 3, 2005, a Vacheron Constantin wristwatch Tour de I&#x27;lle fetched 1.56 million US dollars (1,876,250 CHF) in Antiquorum&#x27;s Geneva auction.
* On June 15, 2011, a Vacheron Constantin minute repeater pocket watch (1918), which was owned by James Ward Packard, was auctioned for 1.76 million US dollars in Christie&#x27;s New York auction.

===Overseas wristwatch ===
In 1996, Vacheron Constantin formally introduced a new high-end sports line called &quot;Overseas&quot;. The precursor of Overseas collection, however, was originally introduced in 1977 during the quartz crisis. The precursor was the wristwatch Ref. 222, which was designed by a 23-year-old designer named Jorg Hysek.

The original version of Overseas was revamped in 2004, and was re-invented again in 2016. Some of the Overseas wristwatches also come with complications such as chronograph, World Time, tourbillon, moon phase, and so on.

=== 222 wristwatch ===
In January 2025, for the brand&#x27;s 270th anniversary, Vacheron Cosntantin re-released their 222 model, with the inclusion of a piece in steel, with the Ref. 4200H/222A-B934. This marked another notable entry into the integrated steel sports watch market, paired with the established Overseas model.

=== Patrimony wristwatch ===
The Patrimony wristwatch is a model of Vacheron Constantin. The collection was introduced in 2004, and is known for its simple and elegant design as well as its ultra-thin case. The designer was inspired by some of the company&#x27;s watch models back in 1950s.

In 2009, Vacheron Constantin decided to integrate the minute repeating complication into some of the Patrimony wristwatches, and the end product was the Patrimony Calibre 1731, the world&#x27;s thinnest minute repeater. The current Patrimony collection also includes some other complications such as perpetual calendars, moon phase indicators, and so on.

===Métiers d&#x27;Art wristwatch ===
In 2007, Vacheron Constantin introduced the Métiers d&#x27;Art &#x27;Les Masques&#x27; collection of timepieces featuring miniature reproductions of primitive art masks. The company selected 12 masks from a private museum collection and reproduced them on a small scale. The miniaturized masks are featured in the dial centre of every watch from the &#x27;Les Masques&#x27; collection.

In 2012, Vacheron Constantin introduced the Métiers d&#x27;Art &#x27;Les Univers Infinis&#x27; collection of timepieces featuring tessellation, a design of interlocking shapes inspired by the work of the Dutch artist M. C. Escher.

=== 250th anniversary edition ===
In 2005, Vacheron Constantin created the wristwatch &quot;Tour de I&#x27;lle&quot; to mark the anniversary of 250 years of Vacheron Constantin. The watch includes 834 parts and 16 horological complications, including tourbillon, minute repeater, moon phase as well as moon age, and took over 10,000 hours of research and development.

The Tour de l&#x27;lle wristwatch is one of the most complicated wristwatches in the world. In total, only seven pieces were manufactured, each of which had a sale price over US$1 million. On April 3, 2005, a Tour de I&#x27;lle wristwatch fetched a final price of 1.56 million US dollars (1,876,250 CHF) in Antiquorum&#x27;s Geneva auction. The auctioned piece has a unique black dial.

=== 260th anniversary edition ===
In 2015, during the manufacturer&#x27;s 260th anniversary, Vacheron Constantin revealed the world&#x27;s most complicated mechanical watch, named Reference 57260. The pocket watch took three watchmakers eight years to build the 57-complication pocket watch at the request of a client. Vacheron Constantin would not disclose the exact price of this watch but did confirm that it was between 8 million and 20 million US dollars.

The Reference 57260 is part of Vacheron Constantin&#x27;s lineage of tailor-made grand complicated pocket watches since James W. Packard&#x27;s pocket watch (1918), which was auctioned for US$1.763 million by Christie&#x27;s in New York on June 15, 2011. In addition, the Vacheron Constantin pocket watch Ref. 402833 (1929), which was tailored for King Fuad I of Egypt, ranks as one of the most expensive watches ever sold at auction, fetching US$2.77 million (3,306,250 CHF) in Geneva on April 3, 2005. In 1946, Vacheron Constantin tailored a complicated pocket watch for King Farouk of Egypt, the successor of King Fuad I, and in 1948 the company tailored another one for Count Guy de Boisrouvray of France.

<text>The river Kladeos flows through Olympia in Elis, Southern Greece, and empties into the river Alfeios. As a tributary of the Alfeios, the Kladeos is fed by the Plataneiko, Lagadino, Gani, and Liakoto streams. Already in classical antiquity, the river was diverted near Olympia in order to prevent flooding in winter. However, the sanctuary of Olympia was covered by a 4 m thick layer of sediment when it was excavated in 1875.

The river is named after Kladeos (, ), a river god in Greek mythology who was one of the sons of Oceanus and Tethys.

<doc id="1194555" wikidata="Q2601401" url="?curid=1194555" title="Exotheology">
<text>The term &quot;exotheology&quot; was coined in the 1960s or early 1970s for the examination of theological issues as they pertain to extraterrestrial intelligence. It is primarily concerned with either conjecture about possible theological beliefs that extraterrestrials might have, or how our own theologies would be influenced by evidence of and/or interaction with extraterrestrials.

One of the main themes of exotheology is applying the concept of extraterrestrials who are sentient, and more to the point, endowed with a soul, as a thought experiment to the examination of a given theology, mostly Christian theology, occasionally also Jewish theology.

==Christianity==
The Christian writer C. S. Lewis, in a 1950s article in the &quot;Christian Herald&quot; contemplated the possibility of the Son of God incarnating on extraterrestrial worlds, or else that God could devise an entirely distinct plan of salvation for extraterrestrial communities from the one for humans.
Lutheran theologian Ted Peters (2003) said that the questions raised by the possibility of extraterrestrial life are not new to Christian theology and do not pose, as said by other authors, a threat for Christian dogma. Peters says that medieval theology had frequently considered the question of &quot;what if God had created many worlds?&quot;, as had the earlier Church Fathers in discussion of the Antipodes.

The Catholic theologian Corrado Balducci often discussed the question in Italian popular media, and in 2001 published a statement &quot;UFOs and Extraterrestrials - A Problem for the Church?&quot;.
In a 2008 statement, José Gabriel Funes, head of the Vatican Observatory, said
&quot;Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on earth, there can be other beings, even intelligent, created by God. This is not in contrast with our faith because we can&#x27;t put limits on God&#x27;s creative freedom&quot;.

Smaller denominations also have similar treatments in passing in their key writings: Christian Science and the Course in Miracles treat extraterrestrials as effectively brother spiritual beings in a non-absolute physical experience, the founder of the former writing, &quot;The universe of Spirit is peopled with spiritual beings...&quot;, and Emanuel Swedenborg wrote, &quot;Anyone with a sound intellect can know from many considerations that there are numerous worlds with people on them. Rational thought leads to the conclusion that massive bodies such as the planets, some of which are larger than our own earth, are not empty masses created merely to wander aimlessly around the sun, and shine with their feeble light on one planet. No, they must have a much greater purpose than that. ... What would one planet be to God, who is infinite, and for whom thousands, or even tens of thousands of planets, all full of inhabitants, would be such a trifling matter as to be almost nothing?&quot;

==Judaism==
Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, who was also a physicist, was inclined toward the belief in extraterrestrial life, citing Jewish authorities including medieval philosopher Rabbi Chasdai Crescas (Ohr Hashem 4:2) and 18th century kabbalist Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu Horowitz (Sefer HaBris). Kaplan says, &quot;We therefore find the basic thesis of the Sefer HaBris supported by a number of clear-cut statements by our Sages. There may even be other forms of intelligent life in the universe, but such life forms do not have free will, and therefore do not have moral responsibility&quot;—at least in the same sense as human beings.
Rabbi Kaplan also cites Judges 5:23 (&quot;Cursed is Meroz...&quot;), about which Rashi, the foremost medieval commentator said, &quot;Some say [Meroz] was a planet, and some say [Meroz] was a prominent person who was near the battle area and yet did not come [to intervene].&quot; 

Rabbi Norman Lamm, former chancellor of Yeshiva University, also wrote on this subject, saying that if the existence of extraterrestrial life should be confirmed, religious scholars must revise previous assumptions to the contrary. He, too, does not rule out this possibility from an Orthodox Jewish point of view.

Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik is said to have remarked that life on other planets would only reflect God&#x27;s greatness, which exceeds mortal understanding, while not contradicting the role of the Jewish people to heed the Torah and in so doing to perform God&#x27;s will here on earth.

==Islam==
Depending on the suras cited, the Quran of Islam appears to leave open the door to the idea of extraterrestrials, as in 27:65, situated similarly on par with humans subject to a divine judgment leading toward a heaven or hell as reward or punishment for the deeds of one&#x27;s life.

<doc id="1194558" wikidata="Q1932733" url="?curid=1194558" title="Paper Monsters">
<text>Paper Monsters is the debut solo studio album by English singer Dave Gahan. It was released on 2 June 2003 in the United Kingdom by Mute Records and the following day in North America by Reprise Records.

==Background and release==
The album was produced by Ken Thomas, known for his work with Icelandic band Sigur Rós. Upon its debut, critical reception was generally mixed; while many complimented the album&#x27;s personal subject matter, others described it as lacking depth. &quot;Paper Monsters&quot; debuted at number 36 on the UK Albums Chart, while reaching the top 10 in Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. In North America, the album was released on 3 June 2003. In March 2004, Gahan released the live video album &quot;Live Monsters&quot;, containing footage from his concert on 5 July 2003 at the Olympia in Paris.

Gahan first played with the idea of releasing a solo album after the release of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Exciter&quot; in 2001, but approached the project slowly. It was not until he began writing music with friend and musician Knox Chandler that he gained the self-confidence he needed to begin to consider working on an album of his own material.

===Singles===
The album spawned three singles. &quot;Dirty Sticky Floors&quot;, the lead single from the album, became Gahan&#x27;s most successful solo release, reaching number 18 on the UK Singles Chart and the top 10 in Germany and Italy. Its remixes were also promoted in US dance clubs, and peaked within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.

The second single, &quot;I Need You&quot;, was a ballad based around a synth and drum arrangement, which reached number 27 in the UK and number five on the US dance chart.

The third and final single was &quot;Bottle Living&quot; / &quot;Hold On&quot;, a double A-side, meaning that two songs were released on the same single. The single continued the album&#x27;s string of top-40 singles, reaching number 36 in the UK.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Paper Monsters&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on nine reviews.

In a review for BBC Music, Kate Lawrence called &quot;Paper Monsters&quot; &quot;an assured debut&quot; with &quot;surprising depth&quot;. She was impressed by Gahan&#x27;s vocals on the track &quot;Hidden Houses&quot;, which she called &quot;deliciously devilish and angelic in equal measure&quot; and said that it &quot;demonstrates a vocal range rarely seen in the Mode back catalogue&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; echoed Lawrence&#x27;s review for BBC Music, calling the album a &quot;competent solo debut&quot; with &quot;murky rock grooves and throaty vocals&quot;.

However, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Michael Idov was less impressed with the album and wrote that its personal subject matter made for a &quot;faintly embarrassing listen&quot;. Idov criticised Gahan&#x27;s lyrics stating that his &quot;vocal can still elevate the dumbest lyric to the level of a cathartic mantra, a skill that comes handy in the absence of Martin Gore&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Don Kline called &quot;Paper Monsters&quot; &quot;a mix of swampy blues-injected rock, slick urban electronica, and atmospheric balladry&quot; and gave it three out of five stars. He also stated that &quot;although it doesn&#x27;t stray too far from the Depeche Mode, Gahan does manage to put his own stamp on the songs&quot;.

<doc id="1194559" wikidata="Q6207304" url="?curid=1194559" title="Jock Campbell (British Army officer)">
<text>Major-General John Charles Campbell, (10 January 1894 – 26 February 1942), known as Jock Campbell, was a British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Campbell was born in Thurso and educated at Sedbergh School. At the beginning of the First World War in August 1914 he joined the Honourable Artillery Company, and, after graduating from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in July 1915. Serving in France, he was wounded twice and ended the war as a captain, having earned the Military Cross (MC).

Between the wars (see the interwar period) he became a first class horseman (in the top flight at both polo and hunting), while continuing to serve as an artillery officer.

==Second World War==
When the Second World War broke out Campbell was 45 years old and a major commanding a battery in the 4th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery in Egypt. When Italy declared war in June 1940, Campbell, by then a lieutenant colonel, was commanding the artillery component of 7th Armoured Division&#x27;s Support Group under Brigadier William Gott. The British Army was heavily outnumbered by the Italians, so General Archibald Wavell formulated a plan with his senior commanders to retain the initiative by harassing the enemy using mobile all-arms flying columns. Campbell&#x27;s brilliant command of one of these columns led to their being given the generic name &quot;Jock columns&quot; (although it is unclear if the idea originated with Campbell or not).

During Operation Compass Campbell&#x27;s guns played an important role in 7th Support Group&#x27;s involvement in the decisive battle at Beda Fomm in February 1941 which led to the surrender of the Italian Tenth Army. In April 1941 Campbell was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), receiving a second award clasp shortly afterwards.

In September 1941 Gott was promoted to command 7th Armoured Division and Campbell took over command 7th Support Group as an acting brigadier. In November 1941 during Operation Crusader, 7th Support Group was occupying the airfield at Sidi Rezegh, south of Tobruk, together with 7th Armoured Brigade. On 21 November 1941 they were attacked by the two armoured divisions of the Afrika Korps. The British tanks suffered heavy losses but prevented the Germans taking the airfield. Brigadier Campbell&#x27;s small force, holding important ground, was repeatedly attacked and wherever the fighting was hardest he was to be seen either on foot, in his open car or astride a tank. According to Alan Moorehead,


The following day he was again at the forefront, encouraging his troops through continued enemy attacks. He personally directed the fire of his batteries, and twice manned a gun himself to replace casualties. Though wounded, he refused to be evacuated during the final German attack. His leadership did much to maintain the fighting spirit of his men, and resulted in heavy casualties being inflicted upon the enemy. The fighting continued on 23 November, but with 7th Armoured Brigade destroyed and the 5th South African Infantry Brigade being decimated, Campbell withdrew the remains of his support group to the south. For his actions during the battle, Campbell was awarded the Victoria Cross.

He purportedly received a letter of congratulation from General Johann von Ravenstein, commander of the 21st Panzer Division, one of the armoured formations which Campbell had faced at Sidi Rezegh. When interviewed later as a prisoner of war, Ravenstein freely expressed his &quot;greatest admiration&quot; for Campbell&#x27;s skill on &quot;those hot days&quot; and recalled &quot;all the many iron that flew near the aerodrome around our ears&quot;.

In February 1942 Campbell was promoted Major-General and given command of 7th Armoured Division, while Gott was promoted from the 7th to lead XIII Corps.

Three weeks after his promotion Campbell was killed when his jeep overturned on a newly laid clay road. The driver of the jeep, Major Roy Farran, and the other passengers were thrown clear from the wreck and knocked unconscious. Farran had been Campbell&#x27;s aide-de-camp, and later admitted considering suicide while waiting for medical help. During the Western Desert campaign Campbell was considered one of the finest commanders in the Eighth Army, an old desert hand who had been in North Africa from the start of the war. His loss was deeply felt. Alan Moorehead, a war correspondent who served throughout the war in the desert, described the impact that both Gott and Campbell had when visiting a hospital in Benghazi:&#x27;

==Victoria Cross==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich, England. The citation for the award was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 30 January 1942, reading:

==Further information==
A memorial to Campbell stands in his old school, Sedbergh, commemorating his brave deeds.

There is a plaque and bench on a seaside walk in his home town in his honour. Major-General Campbell is also recorded on the War memorial in the village of Flore, 7 miles West of Northampton.

<text>Prestige Records is a jazz record company and label founded in 1949 by Bob Weinstock in New York City which issued recordings in the mainstream, bop, and cool jazz idioms. The company recorded hundreds of albums by many of the leading jazz musicians of the day, sometimes issuing them on subsidiary labels. The company&#x27;s began releasing jazz records in 78 and 45 RPM formats in 1950. The Prestige label includes the 13000 and 25000 cat# series. Prestige International was a sub-label of Prestige, active from 1960 to 1969, that mostly released folk music. In 1971, the company was sold to Fantasy, which was later absorbed by Concord.

==History==
The Prestige office was located at 446 West 50th Street, New York City. Its catalogue included Gene Ammons, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Stan Getz, Wardell Gray, Thelonious Monk, and Sonny Rollins.

Audio engineer Rudy Van Gelder was the recording engineer of many Prestige albums in the 1950s and early-to-mid-1960s. Prestige created new labels in 1960: Swingville, Moodsville, covering jazz, Bluesville featuring blues revival artists, Lively Arts featuring spoken word recordings and Prestige International, Prestige Folklore, Irish and Near East with folk and world music.

By the later 1950s, Weinstock ceased supervising recording sessions directly, employing Chris Albertson, Ozzie Cadena, Esmond Edwards, Don Schlitten, and producer/music supervisor Bob Porter, among others, to fulfill this function. Musicians recording for the label in the 1960s included Jaki Byard and Booker Ervin, while Prestige remained commercially viable by recording a number of soul jazz artists like Charles Earland. In 1966 the company&#x27;s headquarters were located at 203 South Washington Avenue in Bergenfield, New Jersey.

The company was sold to Fantasy Records in 1971, and original releases on the label formed a significant proportion of its Original Jazz Classics line. Fantasy was purchased by Concord Records in 2005.

In 2017, Concord Music Group revived the Prestige label. The first album released under the label&#x27;s reactivation was &quot;A Social Call&quot; from Texas native Jazzmeia Horn.

In the mid 1960s the company fell into relative limbo, but limited new recordings were made in the late 1970s, including a series of albums by Art Pepper recorded at the Village Vanguard club in New York. After Les Koenig&#x27;s death in 1977, the label was run for seven years by his son, John, who produced albums by George Cables, Joe Farrell, Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson, Peter Erskine, and Chico Freeman.

In 1984 Contemporary was purchased by Fantasy Records, which used the name for a short time. Most Contemporary titles were reissued by Fantasy. Also, some titles have found new life among today&#x27;s audiophiles as high-quality LP remasters from Analogue Productions and other audiophile labels. The Fantasy catalog, including Contemporary and its associated labels, Good Time Jazz Records, Society for Forgotten Music, and Contemporary Composers Series, was sold to Concord Records in 2004.

Over the years, a number of major figures in the music business worked for Contemporary. Among them were Atlantic Records executive Nesuhi Ertegun, writers Nat Hentoff and Leonard Feather, producer Joe Boyd, recording engineer and studio designer Howard Holzer, and mastering engineer Bernie Grundman.

==Recording==
Koenig maintained high audio standards. He hired Roy DuNann from Capitol Records in 1956, who, out of the label&#x27;s shipping room turned studio, turned out some of the best sounding records of the time. DuNann provided some details of his techniques in a &quot;Stereophile&quot; article nearly 50 years later. He said Koenig provided him with German (Neumann/Telefunken U-47) and Austrian (AKG C-12) condenser microphones and he immediately noted the very high output of these microphones, especially close-in on jazz musicians&#x27; dynamic playing. DuNann achieved his signature sound—crisp, clear and balanced without distortion or unpleasant &quot;peak presence&quot;—by keeping his microphone setups very simple (generally one per musician) and avoided the use of pre-amplifiers for them.

He built a simple passive mixing system that directly fed the electronics of his Ampex 350 and 351 tape machines. Also, DuNann told &quot;Stereophile&quot; that Contemporary sessions were recorded &quot;dry&quot; (without electronic echo added or in a reverberant room). Sometimes, such as in the case of Sonny Rollins&#x27; &quot;Way Out West&quot;, a plate reverb unit was inserted between the tape machine and the LP disc cutting lathe. This is why some later LP and CD reissues of Contemporary albums sound &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;dead&quot; compared to the original LPs mastered by DuNann.

<doc id="1194572" wikidata="Q2736068" url="?curid=1194572" title="Victor Crutchley">
<text>Admiral Sir Victor Alexander Charles Crutchley (2 November 1893 – 24 January 1986) was a British naval officer. 

He was a First World War recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, and a senior Royal Navy officer during the Second World War.

==Early life and education==
Crutchley was born on 2 November 1893 at 28 Lennox Gardens, Chelsea, London, the only son of Percy Edward (1855–1940) and the Hon. Frederica Louisa (1864–1932), second daughter of Charles FitzRoy, 3rd Baron Southampton. His mother had been maid of honour to Queen Victoria. He was a godchild of Queen Victoria (from whom he derived his first two names). He joined the navy in 1906 and was educated at the Royal Naval College, Osborne and Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.

==First World War==
In September 1915 Crutchley was promoted to lieutenant and posted to a battleship of the Grand Fleet, . &quot;Centurion&quot; participated in the Battle of Jutland. After the battle Captain Roger Keyes assumed command of &quot;Centurion&quot; and acquired a highly favorable impression of Crutchley. Keyes selected Crutchley for the Zeebrugge Raid of 23 April 1918; he was assigned by Keyes as first lieutenant to Commander Alfred Godsal, also of &quot;Centurion&quot;, on the obsolete cruiser .

&quot;Brilliant&quot; and were to be sunk as blockships at Ostend. The Germans had moved a navigation buoy, and so the ships were beached in the wrong place under heavy fire. But Crutchley performed well and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

Crutchley volunteered for the Second Ostend Raid on 9 May, and was posted to the cruiser , again commanded by Godsal. When Godsal was killed and the navigating officer incapacitated, Crutchley took command. When a propeller was damaged on the quay, preventing the vessel fully closing the canal, Crutchley ordered its scuttling and personally oversaw the evacuation under fire.

Crutchley transferred to the damaged motor launch &quot;ML 254&quot;. When its wounded captain Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond collapsed, Crutchley took command. Crutchley oversaw bailing operations, standing in water up to his waist, until the destroyer , carrying Admiral Keyes, came to its aid.

Although the second raid also failed fully to close the Bruges Canal to submarine traffic, Crutchley, Drummond and Rowland Bourke were awarded Victoria Crosses for the action. When there were more worthy recipients than VCs to award, the men were allowed to elect those to receive a VC. Crutchley was one of the last elected VCs. During the final months of the war, Crutchley served on HMS &quot;Sikh&quot; in the Dover Patrol, the Channel force commanded by Keyes.

==Inter-war==
In 1920, Crutchley spent a tour of duty on board the minesweeper on the South American and South Atlantic station. He then served on the royal yacht in 1921, the cadet-training dreadnought in 1922–1924, and the royal yacht in 1924.

In 1924 he went to the Mediterranean Fleet for four years, serving under Roger Keyes, now Commander-in-Chief at Malta. Crutchley was on in 1924–1926, and then on the light cruiser in 1926–1928.

Crutchley was a polo player, and was invited to play for Keyes&#x27; polo team, the &quot;Centurions&quot;. At one point in 1927, Crutchley played on the same team as Keyes, the Duke of York, and Louis Mountbatten. Crutchley was promoted to commander in 1928. In 1930, he married Joan Elisabeth Loveday of Pentillie Castle, Cornwall, the sister of Air Chief Marshal Alec Coryton.

In August 1930, Crutchley joined in the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy where he served until 1933. Serving as executive officer, Crutchley was present at the relief operation after the 1931 Hawke&#x27;s Bay earthquake, and towards the end of his tour, when the captain was chronically ill, took command of &quot;Diomede&quot; until he was promoted to captain. He was posted home in 1933. Crutchley was senior officer, 1st Minesweeper Flotilla (1st MSF) from 1935 to 1936 aboard the minesweeper at Portland, Dorset. In November 1935 Crutchley took the 1st MSF to join the Mediterranean Fleet in Alexandria, and cruised to Famagusta, Cyprus for 10 days during the winter. On 16 April 1936, Crutchley was relieved by Captain W. P. C. Manwaring and appointed Captain, Fishery Protection and Minesweeping with overall command over the Royal Navy&#x27;s Minesweeping and armed trawler fleet.

On 1 May 1937, Crutchley took command of , which had been completely refitted in three years at Portsmouth. Due to acceptance trials &quot;Warspite&quot; was not present at the Coronation Fleet Review of King George VI. Additional engineering work on the steering gear (which still suffered from damage taken at Jutland) and other equipment resulted in weekend leaves for the crew being curtailed, leading to very low morale. Comments appeared in British newspapers, which culminated in an anonymous letter from a crew member. This provoked an inquiry by the Admiralty. The inquiry led to the removal of three of Crutchley&#x27;s officers, including his executive officer. Crutchley disagreed with the findings of the Inquiry and made sure that the confidential report on his executive officer would lead to a promotion to captain.

&quot;Warspite&quot; eventually proceeded to the Mediterranean Fleet to serve as the flagship of Admiral Dudley Pound, Commander-in-Chief. Crutchley served as Flag Captain to first Pound and then to Admiral Andrew Cunningham up to the outbreak of war.

==Second World War==
===North Sea===
After the outbreak of war in September 1939, &quot;Warspite&quot; was assigned to the Home Fleet. Due to the lack of anti-submarine precautions at the North Sea naval bases, it was some time before she reached Scapa Flow, the main fleet anchorage. Until the start of the Norwegian campaign on 9 April 1940, action had been severely limited by the U-boat threat. A significant German naval presence in the North Sea saw the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway. The inconclusive first battle of Narvik was on 10 April.

On 13 April, Crutchley commanded &quot;Warspite&quot; in the second battle of Narvik. She accompanied nine destroyers into Ofotfjord, where eight German destroyers were sunk or scuttled. &quot;Warspite&quot;″s catapult plane even sank a U-boat.

After this action, Crutchley was appointed commodore of Royal Naval Barracks, Devonport, overseeing the preparation of crews for assignment to ships. While there he was greeted by a detachment of sailors who had served on &quot;Warspite&quot; at Narvik:

===South West Pacific Area===
After the opening of hostilities with Japan, Crutchley was promoted to rear admiral and lent to the Royal Australian Navy for service in the South West Pacific Area. On 13 June 1942 Crutchley succeeded Rear Admiral John Crace in command of Task Force 44, the Australian Squadron, based in Brisbane, the last Briton to do so.

====Battle of Savo Island====

During the landings on Guadalcanal, on 7 August 1942, Crutchley served as Commander Task Group 62.2 (CTG 62.2), the covering group, with his flag in . TG 62.2 included three Australian and five American cruisers, fifteen destroyers, and some minesweepers. He was under Admiral Richmond K. Turner of the United States Navy, commander of the amphibious force. TG 62.2 was on constant alert, rendering support to the landings or fending off Japanese air attacks.

On 8 August, Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher withdrew the aircraft carriers that had provided air cover. Turner decided the amphibious force must also leave the next day. He summoned Crutchley and Major General Alexander Vandegrift (commander of the troops on Guadalcanal) to an evening conference on his flagship. Crutchley took &quot;Australia&quot; to the amphibious anchorage, leaving five cruisers and six destroyers on guard to the west.

That night a powerful Japanese cruiser force attacked. They caught Task Group 62.2 by surprise, and sank four Allied cruisers, including . In the wake of the disaster, Crutchley was heavily criticised, both for leaving his command, and for an ineffective deployment which allowed the Japanese to get close without being detected by radar.

Crutchley nonetheless retained the confidence of his superiors. He remained with the RAN in the South West Pacific, commanding TF 44 (redesignated TF 74 in 1943) for another 23 months. His command of the Australian Squadron ended on 13 June 1944.

In September 1944, Crutchley received the American Legion of Merit in the degree of Chief Commander.

==Later years==
Crutchley&#x27;s final command was Flag Officer Gibraltar after the war (14 January 1945 - January 1947). He retired in 1947 and was promoted to admiral in 1949.

Crutchley enjoyed a long retirement at Mappercombe Manor, near Bridport in Dorset. In 1955, he was appointed High Sheriff of Dorset and in 1957, Deputy Lieutenant for Dorset. When he died in 1986 at the age of 92, he was one of the last surviving admirals from World War II. In 1945, Crutchley had bought two paintings (&quot;Capriccio: The Lagoon, Venice&quot; and &quot;La Torre di Marghera&quot;) by the landscape artist Bernardo Bellotto. They were given to the nation in lieu of tax and presented to the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery in 1988.

<text>The Golf Paris Val D&#x27;Europe (formerly known as &quot;Golf Disneyland) is a golf complex co-operated by the Disney Experiences division, and it&#x27;s located at Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallée, France. The complex includes a Disney-themed golf course. Popular with adult visitors, it also has a children&#x27;s section. Within the golf course is the Marriott Village. Other Disney Golf offerings include the Palm, the Magnolia, the Lake Buena Vista, and Oak Trail golf courses at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, FL.

==Presentation==
Since its creation, the courses have been the property of Disneyland Paris, but since January 1, 2022, management was granted to Resonance Golf Collection associated with UGOLF. It was the largest golf course of any Disney property. However, this golf course remains far from the 5 golf courses at Walt Disney World Resort (Florida, United States) totaling 99 holes and two miniature golf courses.

The golf course is made up of a triple modular 9-hole course, making a total of 27 holes over an area of 91 hectares.

It also has a golf area for young people in the shape of Mickey Mouse and a 600 m2 driving range. The zones are named after the Disney universe:

* &quot;Hundred Acre Wood&quot; with &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; and his friends from the &quot;Hundred Acre Wood&quot;.
* &quot;Wonderland&quot; with &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; characters from &quot;Wonderland&quot;.
* &quot;Neverland&quot; with &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and the characters from &quot;Neverland&quot;.

The golf course had 18 holes when it opened in October 1992 and was expanded in August 1993 with 9 additional holes. Ronald Fream designed it.

The golf course also has a clubhouse designed by the architectural firm Gwathmey Siegel and Associates housing:

* &quot;Goofy&#x27;s Pro Shop&quot; is a store for the equipment for playing golf and clothing featuring Disney characters.
* &quot;Clubhouse Grill&quot;: a restaurant.

<text>Frederick Fisher (3 August 1894 – 23 April 1915), was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. 

A soldier with the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) during the First World War, he was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions on 22 April 1915, during the Second Battle of Ypres. His VC was the first to be earned by a Canadian while serving in the CEF.

==Early life==
Born in St. Catharines, Ontario, on 3 August 1894, Fredrick Fisher was one of four children of a bank manager and his wife. He attended schools in Niagara, Dunneville and Montreal, as his father moved for work. In 1912, he enrolled at McGill University in Montreal to study engineering. While at McGill he joined Zeta Psi fraternity. He did well academically but was also a keen athlete; he was a member of the university&#x27;s track team.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, Fisher enlisted in the 5th Regiment of the Royal Highlanders. He sailed for England aboard &quot;Alaunia&quot; with other contingents of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), arriving there on 15 October 1914. By this time, he had been posted to the regiment&#x27;s 13th Battalion. For the next few months, the battalion underwent training on the Salisbury Plains, during which time Fisher was promoted to lance corporal. In March 1915, the battalion departed for the Western Front.

As part of 3rd Brigade, 1st Canadian Division, Fisher&#x27;s battalion was stationed near St. Julien in the Ypres Salient, with the French 45th Division, made up of Moroccan troops on its left. To open the Second Battle of Ypres, on the evening of 22 April 1915, near St Julien, Belgium, the Germans released poison gas, the first instance of chemical warfare. Caught by surprise, the Moroccans to the left of the Canadians retreated. After a short pause to wait for the gas to clear, the Germans launched an attack into the gap, while the British and Canadians desperately tried to establish a new defence line. A Canadian artillery battery of 18 pounders was firing on the German trenches when its commander became aware of German troops moving in the open towards his position and requested infantry support. Soldiers of the 14th and 15th Battalions were sent forward along with a machine-gun squad commanded by Fisher. Under heavy fire, he covered the retreat of the battery, losing four men in the process. His actions allowed for the battery to initially remove the immediate threat posed by the Germans and continue firing, and for its guns to be hauled to safety later in the evening. Early the next morning, 23 April, when Fisher had obtained four more men from the 14th Battalion, he went forward again into St. Julien to fire on the swarming Germans. Meanwhile, the 13th Battalion positioned on the extreme left of the Canadian Division&#x27;s sector was under heavy fire. Fisher set up his gun at another position to attack the oncoming Germans and was subsequently killed while yet again bringing his machine gun into action under very heavy fire.

Fisher was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions on 22 April 1915. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire and Fisher was the first Canadian recipient from the CEF to earn the award. The citation that was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; for his VC read:

The citation refers to 23 April 1915; this is likely an error as his actions in covering the withdrawal of the artillery battery were performed on 22 April. Like many of the other Canadian soldiers who fell in the first three days of the Second Battle of Ypres, Fisher&#x27;s body was never recovered. His name can be found on the Menin Gate war memorial in Ypres for the 56,000 troops from Britain, Australia, Canada and India killed in the Ypres Salient and who have no known grave.

==Victoria Cross==
In August 1915, the War Office forwarded Fisher&#x27;s VC to his parents, who were living in Westmount, and accompanied by a handwritten letter from King George V. The following year, they attended a ceremony at McGill University where a portrait of Fisher was unveiled. Following the death of Fisher&#x27;s mother in 1946, the VC was passed on to his sister, who in turn donated it to the Royal Highland Regiment of Canada, now known as the Black Watch. The VC is securely held in a bank vault while a replica is displayed at its headquarters in Montreal.

Fisher is remembered by two plaques; the first, laid in 1917, is at the Royal Highlanders of Canada Armories in Montreal, while the other, laid in 1970 by the Royal Canadian Legion, is in Memorial Park at St. Catharines, his town of birth.

<text>Pablo Records was a jazz record company and label founded by Norman Granz in 1973, more than a decade after he had sold his earlier catalog (including Verve Records) to MGM Records.

Pablo initially featured recordings by acts that Granz managed: Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson, and Joe Pass. Later, the label issued recordings by Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Milt Jackson, and Paulinho da Costa. The label also re-released 1950s recordings by Art Tatum, which Granz reacquired, and released unissued European live recordings of John Coltrane and his groups.

In January 1987, it was announced that the label had been acquired by Fantasy Records for an undisclosed amount. Eric Miller, who had worked with Norman Granz since the early 1970s, continued with Pablo as head of A&amp;R, until the early-2000s. Fantasy continued to release previously unissued recordings using the Pablo name.

<doc id="1194589" wikidata="Q3349601" url="?curid=1194589" title="Mistaken Identity (Delta Goodrem album)">
<text>Mistaken Identity is the second studio album by Australian singer Delta Goodrem, released in Australia on 8 November 2004, a day before Goodrem&#x27;s twentieth birthday, by Epic and Daylight Records. Goodrem co-wrote all but one of the songs on the album, which was produced by Guy Chambers with Richard Flack and Steve Power. &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; debuted at number-one on the Australian Albums Chart making it her second number-one album but the sales did not match up to her previous album &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; (2003) which sold 4.5 million copies worldwide. The album produced Goodrem two more number-one singles with &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; and &quot;Almost Here&quot;, and the rest of the album&#x27;s singles; &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; and &quot;A Little Too Late&quot;, became top twenty hits. The album features Goodrem&#x27;s first duet, &quot;Almost Here&quot; (with Irish singer Brian McFadden).
It had two tours Visualise Tour in 2005 and Mistaken Identity twenty year anniversary in 2025 

== Content ==
Music was one of the main comforts for Goodrem during the chemotherapy for her Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma cancer diagnosis. Songs kept going around in her head: harmonies, melodies, lyrics, many deeper and darker than those that were on her debut album, &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;. Goodrem states &quot;It&#x27;s a more grown up album&quot;, &quot;My music changed because my life had changed; the whole world around me had changed. My music had to reflect that&quot;. &quot;Extraordinary Day&quot; is about the day (8 July 2003) when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, &quot;The Last Night On Earth&quot; is a song about death and love, &quot;The Analyst&quot; tells the story of the hours of self-analysis she dealt with, &quot;Be Strong&quot; is an encouraging call for confidence and &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; is Goodrem stating for the record where her head was at. She also stated &quot;There are a lot of lyrics I wouldn&#x27;t have used on the first album&quot;.
Musically the album is more classically piano driven and ventures into pop rock and pop jazz. The single &quot;A Little Too Late&quot; is guitar-driven pop rock song; &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; is a dark, theatrical alternative pop song; while &quot;The Last Night On Earth&quot; is a pop rock ballad.

Goodrem states that &quot;This time around I had time to think &#x27;What kind of song do I want to create here?&#x27;&quot;, &quot;I really felt the sky was the limit with this record, you could do anything in a song. I didn&#x27;t feel limited at all. There were a lot more options, a lot more paths I could go down, more directions I could choose&quot;. Songwriter Guy Chambers had been keeping an eye on Goodrem&#x27;s career and was impressed with her vocals and songwriting skills. The two writing together resulted in many of the album&#x27;s key tracks. &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s really unusual to work with somebody so talented, young, and brave. Who&#x27;s not scared to take risks and who has the most emotional voice in pop music&quot;, You cannot help but believe every word Delta sings.&quot; Chambers states about working with Goodrem. Goodrem stated that Chambers was a classy producer and that he was an inspiration to work with. She felt they had a good connection on a musical level. &quot;There&#x27;s a definite story in the tracklisting,&quot; Goodrem says. &quot;I felt I had to be really honest. Songs that people could still relate to but songs that also confronted issues. This past chapter of my life has been such an intense one and I wanted people to know my thoughts&quot;.

== Chart performance and promotion ==
&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was the first song off the album to be released and was released to radio on 24 September 2004 and quickly became the most added song to radio for that week. The music video was directed by Nigel Dick and made its premier to television on 1 October, [2004, right after the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Goodrem performed the song live for the first time on 17 October 2004 at the eighteenth Annual ARIA Awards and that same night &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; made its debut in the charts at number-one, Goodrem&#x27;s sixth consecutive number-one single in Australia. Debuting at number-one on its first week, the song also was certified platinum by ARIA and stayed at number-one for two more weeks. The song also reached the top ten in the UK and the top twenty in Greece, Ireland, and New Zealand.

&quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; debuted at number one on the ARIA Album Chart on 15 November 2004 with triple platinum sales knocking Robbie Williams album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; off the top spot. Unlike her debut album &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; only spent one week at the top, being knocked off by Eminem&#x27;s album &quot;Encore&quot;, and falling to number two. In its third week, it fell to number three but in its fourth week it jumped up to number two. The album spent eight weeks in the top ten. When the album was in its fourth week in the chart and its position at number two, it had gone four times platinum and by its sixth week in the chart at number five it went five times platinum. The album spent forty-six weeks in the charts, leaving at number one hundred. It was the thirteenth-highest-selling album in Australia for 2004 and the thirtieth highest selling album for 2005. In 2005 the album was nominated for one ARIA Award, &quot;Highest Selling Album&quot; but lost to Missy Higgins album &quot;The Sound of White&quot; (2004). The album did not perform as well in the UK, debuting and peaking at number twenty-five and then falling to forty-four in its second week. It spent a total of ten weeks in the top seventy-five and accredited gold by BPI.

The second song lifted off the album was an Australian-only release, the title track &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, released to radio on 6 December 2004, and became the second-most-added song to radio for that week. The music video for the song was directed by Michael Spiccia, released on 13 December 2004 and was based on the 1984 film &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot;. It was released as a CD single in January 2005 and debuted at number seven on the Australian Singles Chart, the fifth highest entry for that week and was certified gold by ARIA. &quot;Almost Here&quot; was the third song released from the album but was the second internationally, released on 31 January 2005. A song about a broken relationship, the video was filmed in a London airport between 27 and 29 October 2004. It became one of Goodrem&#x27;s biggest hits, making it her seventh number-one single in Australia, her first in Ireland, and her fifth top ten hit in the UK, and was nominated for an ARIA Award in 2005 for &quot;Highest Selling Single&quot; but lost to &quot;The Prayer&quot; by Anthony Callea. &quot;A Little Too Late&quot; was the fourth song released from the album on 30 May 2005 and the music video was directed by MTV award-winner Anthony Rose and was premiered 2 May 2005 on the Channel Ten news. The song was only released in Australia and did not chart like the other singles, debuting and peaking at number thirteen. The last song released from the album was &quot;Be Strong&quot;, which was only released in Australia as a digital download on 17 October 2005.

<text>Andrew Fitzgibbon VC (13 May 1845 – 7 March 1883) was a British soldier, and possibly the youngest recipient of the Victoria Cross.

==Details==
Fitzgibbon was born in Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand, India. He was fifteen years old, and a Hospital Apprentice in the Indian Medical Establishment, Indian Army, attached to the 67th Regiment (later The Royal Hampshire Regiment) during the Third China War when the deed for which he was awarded the VC took place.

On 21 August 1860 at the capture of the Northern of the Taku Forts, China, Fitzgibbon accompanied a wing of the 67th Regiment when it took up a position within 500 yards of the fort. He proceeded, under heavy fire, to attend a dhoolie-bearer whose wound he had been directed to bind up. Then, while the regiment was advancing under the enemy&#x27;s fire, he ran across the open ground to attend to another wounded man. In doing so he was himself severely wounded.

==Further information==
Acknowledged to be youngest recipient of the VC (aged 15 years, 3 months), with Thomas Flynn (VC). Jack Cornwell was 16 years old when he was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross after the Battle of Jutland.

Fitzgibbon later achieved the rank of Apothecary. He died in Delhi, India on 7 March 1883. He is believed to have been buried with his Victoria Cross.

<doc id="1194591" wikidata="Q2300281" url="?curid=1194591" title="Abuse (video game)">
<text>Abuse is a run and gun video game developed by Crack dot Com and published by Electronic Arts in North America and Origin Systems in Europe. It was released on February 29, 1996 for MS-DOS. A Mac OS port of the game was published by Bungie and released on March 5, 1997. The game&#x27;s source code, along with some of the shareware content, has been in the public domain since the late 1990s and has been ported to Linux and many other platforms.

==Plot==
The protagonist of the game, Nick Vrenna, has been unjustly incarcerated in a prison where the staff are performing unethical medical experiments upon the inmates. A prison riot occurs and an experiment goes horribly wrong. The people inside the prison - except for Nick, who seems to be immune - are infected with a substance called Abuse that transforms them into monsters. With the water supply in danger of being infected, Nick arms himself and fights through the horde to prevent this, and then escapes from the prison complex.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Abuse&quot; resembles a side-scrolling platform game. The keyboard is used to move Nick, while the mouse is used for aiming the weapons. The gameplay consists of fighting various enemies (mostly the various forms of mutants, who prefer to attack in huge swarms) and solving simple puzzles, usually involving switches.

Networked play, through IPX/SPX, is supported.

==Development==
&quot;Abuse&quot; had a very different storyline coming out of production. The update for it replaced the original introduction with the current storyline. The original involved an invasion by an alien species called &quot;ants&quot;. The player was a special ops agent, sent into their &#x27;hive&#x27; to covertly destroy the aliens by shutting down the cooling system. This story was alluded to in a hidden section towards the end of level 14, where a large area, full of maroon tiles, can be found.
The game was in development for 6 months by three people with a budget of $150,000.

==Release==
&quot;Abuse&quot; was originally released on February 29, 1996, for MS-DOS and Linux, as an incomplete shareware version by Electronic Arts in North America, and Origin Systems in Europe. The game was ported to Mac OS by Oliver Yu of Crack dot Com and published by Bungie on March 5, 1997. The port was largely reworked for Mac, with the graphics partially redone to work better in 640x480 resolution. An AIX port published by IBM on September 26, 1996, is distributed via FTP.

===Source code release===
Approximately two years after the release of the game, Crack dot Com decided to release the game&#x27;s source code. Also the shareware release&#x27;s game data (excluding the sound effects) was handed into the public domain.

===Community development===
Based on the source release the game&#x27;s community worked initially on maintenance work, e.g. making the game work over TCP/IP. In 2001 &quot;Abuse&quot; was adapted to SDL multimedia library, with other technical refinements such as more than the 8-bit color depth the original version was limited to.

The SDL version allowed easy porting to modern platforms, for instance Microsoft Windows, Linux/X11 and also the Mac version has been updated to run on OS X. Over the years, the game became available for many more platforms, for instance BeOS, Nintendo Wii via Wii homebrew, OpenBSD, and in 2009 AmigaOS 4. The game has also been ported to the mobile devices, to iPhone/iPod Touch under the name Abuse Classic.

Until 2011 the game was maintained by Sam Hocevar on his webpage. In 2014 the game was ported to SDL2 and transferred to a GitHub repository.

In 2016, on the 20th birthday of the game, a community developer released a &quot;20th anniversary source port&quot; on base of the previous works which enabled custom resolutions, OpenGL rendering, and Xbox 360 controller support, and fixed the music.

==Reception==
Reviewing the DOS original, a &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic said the game &quot;has everything it needs to be a great arcade classic – intuitive play control, a variety of weapons, creatures, devices, and traps ... scores of secrets to be ferreted out&quot;. He also praised the inclusion of an accessible level editor, and said the game&#x27;s strongest point is the depth of its challenging puzzles, though he criticized the lack of story. He scored the game 4 out of 5 stars. The game was also reviewed in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;.

Due to its futuristic yet spooky atmosphere, &quot;Home of the Underdogs&quot; regarded &quot;Abuse&quot; as a 2D platform equivalent of the first person shooter &quot;Doom&quot;.

&quot;Abuse&quot; in its open-source version was selected in August 2011 as &quot;HotPick&quot; by Linux Format.

<text>George Bell Chicken VC (2 March 1833 – May 1860) was a British sailor and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was one of only five civilians to be awarded the VC, and was awarded the medal for actions while serving ashore as a volunteer in the Indian Naval Brigade during the Indian Mutiny in 1858. In 1860, he returned to sea, and died while in command of schooner &quot;Emily&quot; which was lost in a storm in the Bay of Bengal.

==Early life and Victoria Cross==
Chicken was born on either 2 or 6 March 1833 at either Howdon Pans, Wallsend, Northumberland, or Bishopswearmouth, Durham. He was the son of George Chicken and his wife, Elizabeth (née Bell). During the Indian Mutiny, Chicken volunteered for service as a civilian, and on 31 July 1858, he was taken on strength at HMS &quot;Calcutta&quot;. As an acting-master, he served several months at Fort William, India, before being assigned to No. 3 Detachment of the Indian Naval Brigade. He deployed with them to Jagdispur, in Bengal, to provide artillery support.

He was 25 years old when fighting in the action that resulted in his being awarded the VC. On 27 September 1858, at Suhejnee (Sahejani), near Peroo, Bengal, Chicken was attached to a party of cavalry from the Bengal Military Police Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Charles George Baker, and accompanied by a detachment of the 3rd Sikh Irregular Cavalry commanded by Lieutenant William Edward Delves Broughton. They routed a force of about 700 mutineers and in the pursuit which followed, Chicken forged ahead and charged into the middle of about 20 mutineers, killing five before he was forced off his horse and injured, sustaining severe wounds to his left wrist and left shoulder joints. He would have been killed if four of his fellow troopers had not arrived and rescued him. 

Lieutenant Baker wrote the following about Chicken&#x27;s conduct in a despatch to Captain Gordon, Field Adjutant, Lieutenant Colonel Turner&#x27;s Field Force:

A note was attached from Captain Rattray, commanding officer of the Bengal Military Police Battalion that included the following:

This note was forwarded to Lieutenant-Colonel W. W. Turner, Commander of the Troops on the Grand Trunk Road, who attached the following about Mr. Chicken:

When this note reached the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in India, Lord Clyde, the following was included in a note sent to the Governor-General Lord Canning:

His citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; reads:
==Further information==
Chicken was one of only five civilians to be awarded the VC. His VC is described as &quot;the only Naval VC to be won on horse-back&quot;.

After the action at Suhejnee, Chicken served in the naval brigade for another two years. He was lost at sea in May 1860 when his schooner &quot;Emily&quot; was reportedly lost with all hands in the Bay of Bengal during bad weather. 

==The medal==
The VC was originally sent to India for presentation to Chicken; however, he died before it could be bestowed upon him and the medal subsequently went missing. As a result, another medal was struck and was sent to his father, a master mariner of Shadwell, on 4 March 1862. The VC and other items came up for sale in Canada in 1987. 

In 2006, the medal – believed to be the original that was sent to India, and not the one sent to the recipient&#x27;s father – was purchased by Lord Ashcroft. It is displayed as part of the collection in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Gnaeus Minicius Faustinus Sextus Julius Severus was an accomplished Roman general of the 2nd century. He also held the office of suffect consul in the last three months of 127 with Lucius Aemilius Juncus as his colleague.

==Biography==
Julius Severus was born in the Province of Dalmatia, Colonia Claudia Aequum, today Čitluk, a small village in what is now Croatia.

He served as governor of Moesia; he was appointed governor of Britain around 131.

In 133 and to circa 135, he was transferred to 14th legate of Judaea, to help suppress the Bar Kokhba revolt there. Because of his military reputation, historians have seen him as a troubleshooter, sent to troublesome provinces to bring peace through war and his presence has been taken as indication of unrest in Britain at the time. There is no archaeological evidence to suggest fighting in Britain under his governorship, although a reference by the orator Fronto to many soldiers dying in Britain under Hadrian&#x27;s reign may refer to trouble at this time.

:&quot;Soon [132], however, all Judaea had been stirred up, and the Jews everywhere were showing signs of disturbance ... Hadrian sent against them his best generals. The first of these was Julius Severus, who was dispatched from Britain, where he was governor, against the Jews.&quot; – Cassius Dio, &quot;History of Rome&quot; LXIX.xiii.1-2 - Epitome of Xiphilinus

<text>Karl Wolfgang Deutsch (21 July 1912 – 1 November 1992) was a Czech social and political scientist. He was a professor at MIT, Yale University and Harvard University, as well as Director of WZB Berlin Social Science Center.

Deutsch studied war and peace, nationalism, co-operation, and communication, as well as pioneered quantitative methods and formal systems analysis and model-thinking into the field of political and social sciences, contributing to the development of sociological liberalism school in international relations.

==Early life==
Born into a German-speaking Jewish family in Prague on 21 July 1912 when the Kingdom of Bohemia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Deutsch became a citizen of Czechoslovakia after World War I. His mother Maria was a Social Democrat, and one of the first women to be elected to the Czechoslovak parliament in 1920. His father Martin Moritz Deutsch owned an optical shop on Prague&#x27;s Wenceslas Square and was also active in the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Worker&#x27;s Party. His uncle Julius Deutsch was an important political leader in the Social Democratic Party of Austria.

==Education==
Karl studied law at the German University of Prague, where he graduated in 1934. He discontinued further studies as his overt anti-Nazi stance caused opposition by pro-Nazi students. Karl married his wife Ruth Slonitz in 1936, and after spending two years in England returned to Prague where due to his former anti-Nazi activities, he could not return to the German University. He instead joined its Czech counterpart, the Charles University, where he obtained a law degree in international and canon law and a PhD in Political Sciences in 1938.

==Emigration and career==
In 1938 following the Munich Agreement allowing German troops to enter the Sudetenland, he and his wife did not return from a trip to the United States. In 1939 Deutsch obtained a scholarship to carry out advanced studies at Harvard University where he received a second PhD in political science in 1951. His dissertation, &quot;Nationalism and Social Communication&quot;, was awarded Harvard’s Sumner Prize in 1951.

During World War II he worked for the Office of Strategic Services and participated in the San Francisco conference that resulted in the creation of the United Nations in 1945. Deutsch taught at several universities; first at MIT from 1943 to 1956 (he became a professor of history and political science at MIT in 1952); then at Yale University (initially as a visiting professor in 1957 before becoming a permanent professor in 1958) until 1967; and again at Harvard until 1982. He became a professor at Harvard in 1967, becoming Stanfield Professor of International Peace at Harvard in 1971, a position he held until his death. At Yale University, Deutsch developed the Yale Political Data Program, which collected quantitative indicators for theory testing.

Deutsch worked extensively on cybernetics, on the application of simulation and system dynamics models to the study of social, political, and economic problems, known as wicked problems. He built upon earlier efforts at world modeling such as those advanced and advocated by authors of the Club of Rome such as &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; by Donella Meadows, et al. (1972). He worked with an interdisciplinary team to build new concepts such as security community to the literature.

He held several other prestigious positions; he was a member of the board of World Society Foundation in Zürich, Switzerland from 1984 onwards. He was also elected President of the American Political Science Association in 1969, of the International Political Science Association in 1976, and of the Society for General Systems Research in 1983. From 1977 to 1987, he was Director of the Social Science Research Center Berlin (Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, WZB) in Berlin.

Karl W. Deutsch in his book &quot;The Nerves of Government: Models of Political Communication and Control&quot; hypothesized about “information elites, controlling means of mass communication and, accordingly, power institutions, the functioning of which is based on the use of information in their activities.”

==Personal life==
He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 1 November 1992. He has two daughters and three grandchildren.

Although nothing (outside a formal system) can be completely defined, the clarity test allows the decision participants to determine whether such elements as variables, events, outcomes, and alternatives are sufficiently well defined to make the decision at hand. In general, a model element is well defined if a knowledgeable individual can answer questions about the model element without asking further clarifying questions.

More precisely, Howard defines the clarity test by saying that a quantity or event is clearly defined—it passes the clarity test—if a &quot;clairvoyant would be able to say whether or not the event in question occurred or, in the case of a variable, the value of the variable.&quot; Howard defines the clairvoyant as &quot;a person who knew the future, who had access to all future newspapers, readings of physical devices, or any other determinable quantity.&quot; In later teaching Howard more broadly defined the clairvoyant as a person with perfect knowledge of all events and measurable quantities, past present and future, but no judgment.

The concept of the clairvoyant is useful in decision analysis for ensuring clarity of thought, particularly when assessing uncertainty.

The wizard is another mythical character who can change the future, usually for a fee, provided he or she is given a well-defined request. The concept of the wizard is useful for assessing deterministic preferences by eliminating the complexity added by uncertainty.

<text>James Collis VC (19 April 1856, Cambridge – 28 June 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military service==
Collis was a 24‑year‑old gunner in the Royal Horse Artillery, British Army, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. On 28 July 1880, during the retreat from Maiwand to Kandahar in Afghanistan, when the officer commanding the battery was trying to bring in a limber with wounded men under cross-fire, Gunner Collis ran forward and drew the enemy&#x27;s fire on himself, thus taking their attention from the limber. He was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for this action. His citation read:
He was presented his VC, on Poona (Pune) Racecourse, by Lord Frederick Roberts on 11 July 1881.

Collis was one of eight men whose VCs were forfeited. He was stripped of the medal on 18 November 1895 after being convicted of bigamy.

He enlisted in the Suffolk Regiment, in which he served as a private, service number 16525, in World War I, until discharged on medical grounds in August 1917. 

He died, aged 62, on 28 June 1918 of a heart attack in Battersea hospital. He left a widow, Adela Grace Collis, who was living at Old Sapper&#x27;s Lines, Mayo Road, Poona, India. At his funeral his coffin was draped with the Union Flag and borne on a gun carriage escorted by a military firing party. At Earlsfield Cemetery, Wandsworth he was given full military honours, and there was no mention of his crime or the forfeiture of the Victoria Cross. 

==Post-death developments==
Although his burial in Plot B, Section 20, grave 295, was registered with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (initially omitting the postnominal VC), for 80 years he lay in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave, with no headstone to acknowledge his act of bravery in the service of his country. On 22 May 1998 a ceremony was held at Wandsworth Council&#x27;s Earlsfield Cemetery in Magdalen Road to mark the erection of a headstone, resplendent with the carving of his Victoria Cross.
On Collis&#x27; death his sister made a plea to King George V to restore her brother&#x27;s name to the VC register. She received a sympathetic reply from the King&#x27;s private secretary Lord Stamfordham who while denying the request did support the proposal that Gunner Collis&#x27; name should be inscribed with those of other VC recipients on the tablets of the Royal Artillery Victoria Cross Memorial. When the subject of forfeiture was again raised, the King&#x27;s view that &quot;no matter the crime committed by anyone on whom the VC has been conferred, the decoration should not be forfeited&quot; was expressed in another letter by Lord Stamfordham on 20 July 1920. There is no evidence to support the suggestion that this was in response to the earlier petition from the sister of James Collis.

The medal was bought by Lord Ashcroft in 2014 and is now on display in the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1194604" wikidata="Q2545678" url="?curid=1194604" title="Walter Congreve">
<text>General Sir Walter Norris Congreve, (20 November 1862 – 28 February 1927), was a British Army officer in the Second Boer War and the First World War, and Governor of Malta from 1924 to 1927. He received the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Walter Norris Congreve was born in Chatham, Kent, on 20 November 1862, the son of William and Fanny E. Congreve, of Castle Church, Stafford. His father was then a captain in the British Army, having served with both the 9th (East Norfolk) and 29th (Worcestershire) Regiments of Foot and would later become the chief constable of Staffordshire from 1866 until 1888. Walter himself was educated at Twyford School, Harrow School and Pembroke College, Oxford. He did not graduate from the latter, however, &quot;having left after a senior member of the college was wounded with an air rifle. This perhaps was the first sign of Congreve&#x27;s passion for shooting and mystery that served him so well in his later career.&quot;

==Early military career==
Congreve was commissioned into the militia battalion of the North Staffordshire Regiment in January 1880.

After resigning his commission in March 1884, Congreve, after graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was re-commissioned as a lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) in February 1885 and promoted to captain in December 1893.

==Second Boer War==
The Second Boer War started in October 1899 with a Boer offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas. Congreve arrived in South Africa and was posted as a brigade major in the Ladysmith relief force. He was present at the Second Battle of Colenso when British troops commanded by Sir Redvers Buller attempted to cross the Tugela River to relieve the besieged city of Ladysmith. The Boers repelled all their attempts to cross the river, and the British were forced to retreat in one of their biggest defeats of the war.

===Action at Colenso===
On 15 December 1899 at the Second Battle of Colenso, Captain Congreve with several others, tried to save the guns of the 14th and 66th Batteries, Royal Field Artillery, when the detachments serving the guns had all become casualties or been driven from their guns. Some of the horses and drivers were sheltering in a donga (gully) about 500 yards behind the guns and the intervening space was swept with shell and rifle fire. Captain Congreve, with two other officers (Frederick Roberts and Harry Norton Schofield), and Corporal George Nurse retrieved two of the guns. All four received the VC for this action. (Roberts was the son in one of the two other father-and-son pairs of VC winners.) Then, although wounded himself, seeing one of the officers fall, Congreve went out with Major William Babtie, RAMC, who also received the VC for this action, and brought in the wounded man. His citation read:
===Later service in South Africa===
Wounded, Congreve did not take part in the actual relief of Ladysmith in February 1900, but he was back in service later that year, and served as a staff officer. He served as adjutant in a newly established colonial mounted infantry regiment which, with the leave of Lord Roberts, was named after his chief of staff, &quot;Kitchener&#x27;s Horse&quot;. The unit was employed, with distinction, in the operations undertaken by Lord Roberts in February 1900 for the relief of Kimberley and his advance on Bloemfontein and later Pretoria. Lord Kitchener took over the chief command of British forces in South Africa in November 1900, and appointed Congreve his personal secretary. He was promoted to major on 21 December 1901, and on the next day received a brevet promotion as lieutenant-colonel in recognition of services in South Africa. Following the end of hostilities in early June 1902, he left Cape Town on board the &quot;SS Orotava&quot; together with Lord Kitchener, and arrived at Southampton the next month. He was mentioned in a despatch by Lord Kitchener in June 1902.

==Between the wars==
After the Boer War, Congreve held a series of command posts in Britain and Ireland, steadily advancing through the ranks as he did so. In November 1902 he joined the staff of the 3rd Army Corps in Ireland as he was appointed assistant military secretary and aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief of the corps, the Duke of Connaught.

He was promoted to colonel in September 1909 upon being made commandant of the School of Musketry in Hythe, Kent, in succession to Colonel Granville Egerton. In this post he excelled, and apparently, &quot;greatly improved rifle skills, raising the rate of fire to fifteen armed shots a minute&quot;.

==First World War==


At the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914, Congreve was a temporary brigadier-general, having been promoted to that rank in December 1911, when he assumed command of the 18th Brigade, part of the 6th Division. Congreve&#x27;s brigade was on manoeuvres in Wales at the time of the war&#x27;s outset. Although suffering from asthma, he deployed with the formation in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to France, taking part in the Battle of the Aisne.

The division was stationed near Neuve Chapelle when Congreve&#x27;s men took part in the 1914 Christmas truce. In a letter written on Christmas Day itself, Brigadier-General Congreve wrote recalling how the Germans opposite his lines initiated by calling a truce earlier the same day, how one of his men got out over the parapet to meet in no man&#x27;s land, and how officers and men exchanged cigars and cigarettes. Congreve admitted he was reluctant to personally witness the scene of the truce for fear he would be a prime target for German snipers.

===The Somme: Delville Wood===


Congreve, promoted in February 1915 to major general, was general officer commanding (GOC) of the 6th Division from May onwards and then XIII Corps as a temporary lieutenant general from November 1915. As the GOC of XIII Corps, Congreve led the battles for Longueval and Delville Wood between 14 July and 3 September 1916. The rapid advance of his corps in the southern sector of the Somme offensive had brought about a situation where the allied front was set at a right angle – the left sector facing north and the right, facing east from Delville Wood. This meant that an advance on a wide front would result in the attacking forces diverging as they advanced. In order to &quot;straighten the line,&quot; General Sir Douglas Haig, commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, had decided to exploit the advances which had been made by Congreve in the south by taking and holding the town of Longueval and Delville Wood. Being on fairly high ground and providing good spotting opportunities for artillery fire, an occupied Longueval would protect the right flank and allow the Allies to advance in the north and align their left with that of Congreve&#x27;s XIII Corps on the right. XIII Corps succeeded in securing Delville Wood, but it was one of the bloodiest confrontations of the Somme, with both sides incurring large casualties.

During the war, Congreve, made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath in January 1917, and whose rank of lieutenant general was made substantive in January 1918, lost a hand in action.

Having remained out of action for the rest of 1917, Congreve continued his war service by becoming GOC VII Corps in January 1918.

==Later life==

Later Congreve, who in June 1921 was made colonel commandant of the Rifle Brigade, rose to the rank of general in November 1922 and was knighted. He was GOC of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force between 1919 and 1923 and then Commander-in-Chief Southern Command between 1923 and 1924.

From 1924 to 1927, he served as the governor of Malta, where he died. At his request, he was buried at sea in the channel between the coast and Filfla Island; there is a small monument to him on the coast between Hamrija Tower and the prehistoric site of Mnajdra; the channel between Malta and Filfla is known as Congreve Channel (the official name is &#x27;Il-Fliegu ta&#x27; Filfla&#x27;).

One of the three school houses of St. Edward&#x27;s College in Cottonera, Malta, a Catholic school for boys founded in 1929 is also named after Congreve. The other two being Campbell and Ducane, after General David Campbell and Sir John Du Cane, all former governors-general of Malta.

There is also a stone bearing his name above the gate to the &quot;Scouts&quot; HQ in Floriana, just outside the capital Valletta.

From 1903 to 1924, Congreve had a home in Shropshire at West Felton Grange. His service in the First World War is recorded, with that of his son William, in a Roll of Honour book in St Michael&#x27;s Church at West Felton.

==Family==
Congreve married at St Jude&#x27;s Church, Kensington, on 18 May 1890, Cecilia Henrietta Dolores Blount La Touche. Lady Congreve was a nurse in the First World War, and a poet and author of &quot;The Firewood Poem&quot;.

They were the parents of Major Billy Congreve – they are one of only three father and son pairs to win a VC. Their younger son Geoffrey Cecil Congreve was created a baronet, of Congreve in the County of Stafford, in July 1927. The eldest son, Arthur (d.1992), served as a Major in the Rifle Brigade.

==Victoria Cross==
Congreve&#x27;s VC is on display at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum, Winchester, Hampshire.

<text>William La Touche Congreve, (12 March 1891 – 20 July 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life and career==
He was at school at Summer Fields School, Oxford, and then at Eton, leaving in 1907. On 1 June 1916 he married Pamela Cynthia Maude, the daughter of actors Cyril Maude and Winifred Emery.

Congreve was 25 years old, and a major in The Rifle Brigade, British Army, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

During the period 6 to 20 July 1916 at Longueval, France, Major Congreve constantly inspired those round him by numerous acts of gallantry. As Brigade Major he not only conducted battalions up to their positions but when the brigade headquarters was heavily shelled he went out with the medical officer to remove the wounded to places of safety, although he himself was suffering from gas and other shell effects. He went out again on a subsequent occasion tending the wounded under heavy shell fire. Finally, on returning to the front line to ascertain the position after an unsuccessful attack, he was shot by a sniper and died instantly.

He was the son of General Sir Walter Congreve, also a Victoria Cross awardee – they are one of only three father and son pairings to win a VC. His younger brother Geoffrey Congreve was a distinguished sailor.

His widow bore a posthumous daughter, Mary Gloria Congreve, born 21 March 1917. Pamela Congreve later remarried, to Brigadier the Hon. William Fraser, in 1919.

==Memorials==
William Congreve&#x27;s grave is at Corbie Communal Cemetery Extension, France, 9 miles east of Amiens, Plot I, Row F, Grave 35. There is also a memorial to him in the form of a plaque in Corbie church, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.

Lutyens designed another plaque to his memory which is at St John the Baptist&#x27;s church in Stowe-by-Chartley, Staffordshire.

Congreve&#x27;s service in the First World War is also recalled, along with that of his father, in a Roll of Honour book in St Michael&#x27;s Church, West Felton, Shropshire, the latter village having been his childhood home when his father lived at West Felton Grange from 1903 to 1924. His VC is recorded in the same village on the community building called the Haslehurst Institute, land for building which had been given by his father.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum, Winchester, England.

On 3 June 1855 at Taganrog, Sea of Azov, Crimea, Boatswain Cooper of HMS &quot;Miranda&quot; together with a lieutenant (Cecil William Buckley) landed while the town was actually under bombardment by the Allied Squadron. It was garrisoned by 3,000 Russian troops, but the two men landed at several places and set fire to government buildings and destroyed enemy equipment and arms. They were under fire themselves for most of the time.

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>James Cooper VC (September 1840 – 9 August 1889) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Cooper was about 27 years old and a private in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Andaman Islands Expedition. The Cross was not awarded for bravery in action against the enemy, but for bravery at sea in saving life in a storm off the Andaman Islands.

On 7 May 1867 at the island of Little Andaman, eastern India, in the Bay of Bengal, Private Cooper was one of a party of five (David Bell, Campbell Mellis Douglas, William Griffiths, Thomas Murphy) of 2/24th Regiment. They risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through dangerous surf to rescue some of their comrades who had been sent to the island to find out the fate of the commander and seven of the crew, who had landed from the ship &quot;Assam Valley&quot; and were feared murdered by the cannibalistic islanders.

The citation was gazetted on 17 December 1867:

THE Queen has been graciously pleased to signify Her intention to confer the decoration of the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned Officer and Private Soldiers of Her Majesty&#x27;s Army, whose claims to the same have been submitted for Her Majesty&#x27;s approval, for their gallant conduct at the Little Andaman Island, as recorded against their names, viz. :—

2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment: Assistant-Surgeon Campbell Millis Douglas, M.D, Private Thomas Murphy, Private James Cooper, Private David Bell, Private William Griffiths.

For the very gallant and daring manner in which, on the 7th of May, 1867, they risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through a dangerous surf to the rescue of some of their comrades, who formed part of an expedition which had been sent to the Island of Little Andaman, by order of the Chief Commissioner of British Burmah, with the view of ascertaining the fate of the Commander and seven of the crew of the ship &quot; Assam Valley,&quot; who had landed there, and were supposed to have been murdered by the
natives.

The officer who commanded the troops on the occasion reports : About an hour later in the day Dr. Douglas, 2nd Battalion, 24th
.&quot;Regiment, and the four Privates referred&quot; to, gallantly manning the second gig, made their way through the surf almost to the shore, but finding their boat was half filled with water, they retired. A second attempt made by Dr. Douglas and party proved successful, five of us being safely passed through the surf to the boats outside. A third and last trip got the whole of the party left on shore safe to the boats. It is stated that Dr. Douglas accomplished these trips through the surf to the shore by no ordinary exertion. He stood in the bows of the boat, and worked her in an intrepid and seamanlike manner, cool to a degree, as
if what he was then doing was an ordinary act of every-day life. The four Privates behaved in an equally cool and collected manner, rowing through the roughest surf when the slightest hesitation or want of pluck on the part of any one of them would have been
attended by the gravest results. It is reported that seventeen officers and men were thus saved from what must otherwise have been a fearful risk, if not certainty of death.
Cooper is buried at Warstone Lane Cemetery, in Birmingham.

<text>Dürnstein () is a small town on the Danube river in the Krems-Land district, in the Austrian state of Lower Austria. It is one of the most-visited tourist destinations in the Wachau region and also a well-known wine growing area. The municipality consists of the Katastralgemeinden of Dürnstein, Oberloiben, and Unterloiben.

==Etymology==
The town gained its name from the medieval Dürnstein castle, which overlooked it. The castle&#x27;s name derived from the German &quot;duerr/dürr&quot;, meaning &quot;dry&quot;, and &quot;Stein&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;. The stone castle was dry because it was located on a rocky hill, high above the damp conditions of the Danube at the base of the hill. The modern town stands between the castle and the river.

==History==

Dürnstein was first mentioned in 1192 when, in the castle above the town, King Richard I of England was held captive by Leopold V, Duke of Austria, after their dispute during the Third Crusade. Richard the Lionheart had offended Leopold the Virtuous by casting down his standard from the walls at the Battle of Acre, and the duke suspected that King Richard ordered the murder of his cousin Conrad of Montferrat in Jerusalem. In consequence Pope Celestine III excommunicated Leopold for capturing a fellow crusader. The duke finally gave custody of the king to Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, who imprisoned Richard at Trifels Castle.

Dürnstein Castle was almost completely destroyed by the troops of the Swedish Empire under Field Marshal Lennart Torstenson in 1645.

Dürnstein Abbey (&quot;Stift Dürnstein&quot;) was established in 1410 by Canons Regular from Třeboň and from 1710 rebuilt in a Baroque style according to plans by Joseph Munggenast, Jakob Prandtauer and Matthias Steinl. The monastery was dissolved by order of Emperor Joseph II in 1788 and fell to the Herzogenburg Priory. It is famous for its blue tower, which is clearly visible from the river.

During the War of the Third Coalition the Battle of Dürenstein was fought nearby on 11 November 1805.
==Politics==
Seats in the municipal assembly as of 2020 elections:
* Austrian People&#x27;s Party: 10
* Social Democratic Party of Austria: 3
* Freedom Party of Austria: 2

==International relations==
Dürnstein is twinned with:
* Tegernsee, Germany

<text>The General Data Format for Biomedical Signals is a scientific and medical data file format. The aim of GDF is to combine and integrate the best features of all biosignal file formats into a single file format.

The original GDF specification was introduced in 2005 as a new data format to overcome some of the limitations of the European Data Format for Biosignals (EDF). GDF was also designed to unify a number of file formats which had been designed for very specific applications (for example, in ECG research and EEG analysis). The original specification included a binary header, and used an event table. An updated specification (GDF v2) was released in 2011 and added fields for additional subject-specific information (gender, age, etc.) and utilized several standard codes for storing physical units and other properties. In 2015, the Austrian Standardization Institute made GDF an official Austrian Standard https://shop.austrian-standards.at/action/en/public/details/553360/OENORM_K_2204_2015_11_15, and the revision number has been updated to v3.

The GDF format is often used in brain–computer interface research. However, since GDF provides a superset of features from many different file formats, it could be also used for many other domains.

The free and open source software BioSig library provides implementations for reading and writing of GDF in GNU Octave/MATLAB and C/C++. A lightweight C++ library called libGDF is also available and implements version 2 of the GDF format.

<doc id="1194628" wikidata="Q5497578" url="?curid=1194628" title="Frederick Corbett">
<text>Frederick Corbett VC (17 September 1853 – 25 September 1912) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Corbett was born on 17 September 1853 in Maldon, Essex, and died there in 1912. His name at birth was David Embleton. He served in first the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (1873–83) and second, the Royal Artillery (1884–91).

==Military service==
Corbett served in the British Army between 1873 and 1891.

Corbett was 28 years old and a private in the 3rd Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps in Egypt when discontented Egyptian officers under Ahmed ‘Urabi rebelled against the administration of Khedive Tewfik, which was influenced by the British and French governments. In the ensuing unrest, the United Kingdom acted to protect its interests in the country, notably the Suez Canal. It was during this service that the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:

The citation in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 16 February 1883, read
During the reconnaissance upon Kafr Dowar, Egypt, on 5 August 1882, the Mounted Infantry, with which Private Corbett was serving, came under a hot fire from the enemy and suffered some loss, including Lieutenant Howard Vyse, mortally wounded. This officer fell in the open, and there being then no time to move him, Private Corbett asked and obtained permission to remain by him, and though under a constant fire, he sat down and endeavoured to stop the bleeding of this officer&#x27;s wounds, until the Mounted Infantry received orders to retire, when he rendered valuable assistance in carrying him off the field.
The event occurred during a probing attack on the Egyptian position. He also served at the decisive Battle of Tel el-Kebir on 13 September 1882. Subsequently, when Kafr-el-Dawwar surrendered following the British victory in Egypt, the works there were found to be strong and well-stocked with modern artillery and arms and ammunition. Held by determined defenders, they would have been extremely difficult to take.

==VC forfeiture==
The British Army Discipline and Regulation Act of 1879 (Army Act) required active soldiers to display their medals on their uniforms on specific occasions. After leaving the army, Corbett sold the medal. He re-enlisted, this time into the Royal Artillery, in 1884. On 30 July 1884, after being convicted of being absent without leave and for embezzlement and theft from an officer in a court-martial, Corbett&#x27;s name was erased from the VC Register by royal warrant and his VC pension was terminated.

Corbett was among eight recipients of the VC whose awards were withdrawn for later criminal offences between 1856 and 1908. The original royal warrant for the Victoria Cross involved an expulsion clause that allowed for a recipient&#x27;s name to be erased from the official register in certain wholly discreditable circumstances and his pension cancelled. The power to cancel and restore awards is still included in the warrant, but none has been forfeited since 1908. King George V felt that no VC should ever be forfeited, regardless of crime. Corbett and the seven others whose awards were forfeited &quot;continue to be included on the official War Office list of VC holders&quot;.

By 1903 the Corbett VC had come into the possession of a Mr Mansfield, Clerk of Kingsbury Urban District Council, who approached the War Office (WO) apparently with the intention of returning the actual medal to Frederick Corbett, or to his family. The War Office informed Mansfield that, &quot;as the name of Frederick Corbett had been erased from the VCR, the cross should not be delivered to Corbett or his representatives.&quot; Worried as to whether he could retain the medal, Mr Mansfield sought clarification; a further letter from the WO confirmed that, &quot;in view of Corbett having sold his VC at a time when he was not subject to the Army Act, Mr Mansfield was entitled to retain it.&quot; Corbett&#x27;s Victoria Cross was sold at auction by Glendining&#x27;s on 17 June 1924 for £50 and now resides in the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester.
==Death==

Corbett died in Maldon Union Workhouse on 25 September 1912. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Maldon cemetery. On 16 April 2004, a regimental headstone was placed over the grave and, in a simple ceremony, the headstone, covered in the regimental flag of the 60th Rifles, was unveiled by Lieutenant General Sir Christopher Wallace. Howard Vyse, the man he tried to save, was buried with three other fatalities shortly after the battle at the English cemetery outside the (now demolished) Rosetta Gate of Alexandria.

<text>The Hallam Line is a railway connecting Leeds and Sheffield via Castleford in the West Yorkshire Metro area of northern England. It is a slower route from Leeds to Sheffield than the Wakefield line. Services on this line are operated by Northern Trains. Services from Leeds to also use the line.

West Yorkshire MetroCards are available on trains between Leeds and Darton, north of Barnsley and South Yorkshire Travelmaster tickets are available in the South Yorkshire area.

==Origin of name==
The line is named after the manor of Hallam which included Sheffield at the time of the Domesday Book (1086). At this time the local area was known as &quot;Hallamshire&quot;—the names &quot;Hallam&quot; and &quot;Hallamshire&quot; are still used today by many local companies and organisations.

==History==
Before the 1923 grouping the route followed by the line was owned as follows:
* Leeds–Methley: Midland Railway
* Methley–Normanton: Midland Railway 
* Methley–Castleford–Normanton: North Eastern Railway
:(alternate route since 1988)
* Normanton–Barnsley: Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
* Barnsley, Jumble Lane to Quarry Junction: Great Central Railway
* Barnsley, Quarry Junction to Sheffield: Midland Railway 

After 1921, the entire route, except Methley to Normanton via Castleford, and the short stretch from Barnsley (Jumble Lane) to Quarry Junction, became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway until nationalisation in 1948. Midland Railway trains made use of station to avoid contact with Great Central or LNER rails.

The route that now exists as the Hallam Line was not possible until 1960 when BR added a connection at Barnsley (Quarry Junction) to allow trains to use Exchange station and reach the Midland line to Sheffield.

==Route details==
Trains on the line serve the following places; some stations may no longer be open: 
* Leeds railway station: in MR days trains would have operated from &quot;Wellington station&quot;. Here there is a triangular junction with the line to Bradford. The line from here to Castleford is also served by Pontefract Line services.
* Hunslet (Closed)
* here was the junction with the &quot;East &amp; West Yorkshire Union Railway&quot; (MidR/Great Northern Railway (GNR) joint: it was a direct connection to Wakefield via Rothwell
* Methley: station closed
* between here and Castleford there were several junctions: with the &quot;Methley Joint Railway&quot; (GNR/L&amp;YR/North Eastern Railway (NER); with the NER line Leeds to York; and with the &quot;Swinton &amp; Knottingley Railway&quot; to Pontefract 
* Either goes to a branch towards where it then reverses towards Normanton which stopping trains use or alternatively goes a more direct route bypassing Castleford and past the former Altofts railway station which closed in 1990 towards Normanton station that Leeds–Sheffield fast trains use.
* here the MidR main line to Sheffield branched off: our route now uses the L&amp;YR metals 
* (Also served by the Pontefract and Huddersfield lines)
* Horbury Junction (closed) for the L&amp;YR main line to Manchester
* Crigglestone (Closed)
* A pair of parallel single-track tunnels, &quot;Woolley Tunnels&quot; (1745 yd; 1570 m), which take the line directly under Woolley Edge services, a motorway service station on the M1 motorway, and under the motorway itself
* (Closed)
* here was &quot;Silkstone Junction&quot; for the freight line to Silkstone. 
* Barnsley: formerly , traffic arrived not only from Leeds but via the Great Central Railway line from Penistone. This is nowadays known as the Penistone Line. 
Stations from here to Sheffield are also on the Penistone line:
* Swaithe Viaduct – carries the line over the Worsborough Branch of the Great Central.
* was &quot;Elsecar &amp; Hoyland&quot;
* – also known as &quot;Wentworth &amp; Hoyland Common&quot; and &quot;Wentworth &amp; Tankersley&quot;. (Closed)
* : formerly Chapeltown South to distinguish from Chapeltown Central on the former South Yorkshire Railway, later G.C.R. line. Chapeltown station was rebuilt nearer to the town centre roundabout in the 1970s as the first railway project of the, then, new South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority. Much of the original remains. 
From here the two railways – MidR and GCR had parallel lines to Sheffield. The latter line is closed and lifted.
* Ecclesfield – known as &quot;Ecclesfield West&quot; to distinguish from Ecclesfield East on the former South Yorkshire Railway, later G.C.R. line. (Closed)
* Meadowhall: partly built on the site of &quot;Wincobank and Meadow Hall&quot;
* (Closed)
* (Closed)
* Sheffield Midland station (also served by the Wakefield and Dearne Valley lines)

<text>Maurice James Dease VC (28 September 1889 – 23 August 1914) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was one of the first British officer battle casualties of the war and the first officer to posthumously receive the Victoria Cross.

==Military career==

Dease was born on 28 September 1889 in Gaulstown, Coole, County Westmeath, Ireland to Edmund Fitzlaurence Dease and Katherine Dease (née Murray). He was educated at Stonyhurst College and the Army Department of Wimbledon College before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was 24 years old, and a lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, commanded at the time by Lieutenant Colonel Norman McMahon, and was awarded the VC for his actions on 23 August 1914, at Mons, Belgium.

Nimy Bridge was being defended by a single company of the 4th Royal Fusiliers and a machine-gun section with Dease in command. The gun fire was intense, and the casualties very heavy, but the lieutenant went on firing in spite of his wounds, until he was hit for the fifth time and was carried away. 

Dease was awarded the first Victoria Cross in the Great War and he received it on the first day of the first significant British encounter in that war.

When Lieutenant Dease had been mortally wounded, Private Sidney Godley offered to defend the Railway Bridge while the rest of the section retreated and was also awarded the VC. He was taken prisoner of war.

H. C. O&#x27;Neill wrote this account in &quot;The Royal Fusiliers in the Great War&quot;.
&quot;The machine gun crews were constantly being knocked out. So cramped was their position that when a man was hit he had to be removed before another could take his place. The approach from the trench was across the open, and whenever a gun stopped Lieutenant Maurice Dease... went up to see what was wrong. To do this once called for no ordinary courage. To repeat it several times could only be done with real heroism. Dease was badly wounded on these journeys, but insisted on remaining at duty as long as one of his crew could fire. The third wound proved fatal, and a well deserved VC was awarded him posthumously. By this time both guns had ceased firing, and all the crew had been knocked out. In response to an inquiry whether anyone else knew how to operate the guns Private Godley came forward. He cleared the emplacement under heavy fire and brought the gun into action. But he had not been firing long before the gun was hit and put completely out of action. The water jackets of both guns were riddled with bullets, so that they were no longer of any use. Godley himself was badly wounded and later fell into the hands of the Germans.

Dease is buried at St Symphorien Military Cemetery, 2 kilometres east of Mons, in Belgium. He is remembered with a plaque under the Nimy Railway Bridge, Mons and in Westminster Cathedral. His name is also commemorated on the Wayside Cross at the Catholic priory in Woodchester, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, where his aunt, Lady Mostyn, was a parishioner. He is further commemorated on a cross at Exton, Rutland and on a plaque installed in St Martin&#x27;s Church, Culmullen, County Meath, Ireland. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Fusiliers Museum in the Tower of London. Victoria Cross holders are being honoured with commemorative paving stones; Dease&#x27;s was the first to be unveiled on 23 August 2014 at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

He was portrayed in the BBC Three series &quot;Our World War&quot; (2014) by Dominic Thorburn.

<doc id="1194636" wikidata="Q1228707" url="?curid=1194636" title="Publius Mummius Sisenna">
<text>Publius Mummius Sisenna was a Roman politician who was &quot;consul ordinarius&quot; in 133 with Marcus Antonius Hiberus as his colleague, and governor of Roman Britain shortly afterwards.

Ronald Syme considers Sisenna&#x27;s tribe &quot;Galeria&quot; as clear evidence that his family origins lay in Spain, and counts twenty different individuals from those provinces who shared his &quot;gentilicium&quot;.

== Life ==
Little is known of his career. Syme speculates that Sisenna may be identical with a &quot;Publius&quot; known to have been governor of Thracia between the years 128 and 136. Sisenna is attested as governor of Roman Britain in a fragmentary inscription at Wroxeter dated 14 April 135. The brief period between his consulship and governorship is unusual; he was one of only three persons known to have proceeded directly to governorship of Roman Britain without governing another province first. The sudden departure of Sextus Julius Severus to Judaea to suppress a rebellion there would explain part of this. Birley speculates that no other person was suitable for the job, and Hadrian appointed him to the ordinary consulship as a means to render Sisenna eligible more rapidly.

Another inscription was thought to show Sisenna to be proconsul of Asia in 150–51, but is now regarded as pertaining to his probable son.

Based on the unusual name, he was kinsman to, if not father of, the suffect consul of 146 and proconsul of Asia, Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus. Rutilianus served as legate of Legio VI Victrix, which was stationed in Britain, likely during the tenure of Sisenna. If they were father and son, that Rutilianus became consul only thirteen years after Sisenna suggests that the older man attained the &quot;fasces&quot; late in life.

<text>Campbell Mellis Douglas (5 August 1840, in Quebec City – 31 December 1909), was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The awarding of the VC to Douglas was one of the few (only six in number) instances of the VC being awarded for actions taken not in the face of the enemy. (Another instance with a Canadian connection was the awarding of the VC to Timothy O&#x27;Hea (an Irishman serving in the British army) for actions taken at Danville, Quebec in 1866 relating to Canada&#x27;s defence against Fenian raids.)

Douglas joined the British Army in 1862.

==Details==
Douglas was born in Quebec City to Dr. George Mellis Douglas and Charlotte Campbell. His father was a prominent doctor in Quebec and served as a Surgeon with the Royal Quebec Volunteers and Eastern Townships Loyal Militia during the Rebellions of 1837-38. His maternal grandfather was Archibald Campbell and his brother was Admiral Archibald Lucius Douglas. 

Campbell Mellis Douglas graduated from the University of Edinburgh Medical School with an MD degree in 1861. He was 26 years old, and an assistant surgeon in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Andaman Islands Expedition when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

VC not awarded for bravery in action against the enemy, but for bravery at sea in saving life in storm off Andaman Islands. On 7 May 1867 at the island of Little Andaman, eastern India, in the Bay of Bengal, Assistant Surgeon Douglas and four Privates (David Bell, James Cooper, William Griffiths and Thomas Murphy) of the 2/24th Regiment risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through dangerous surf to rescue some of their comrades who had been sent to the island to find out the fate of the commander and seven of the crew, who had landed from the ship &quot;Assam Valley&quot; and were feared murdered by the cannibalistic islanders.

The citation was gazetted on 17 December 1867:

THE Queen has been graciously pleased to signify Her intention to confer the decoration of the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned Officer and Private Soldiers of Her Majesty&#x27;s Army, whose claims to the same have been submitted for Her Majesty&#x27;s approval, for their gallant conduct at the Little Andaman Island, as recorded against their names, viz. :—

2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment: Assistant-Surgeon Campbell Millis Douglas, M.D, Private Thomas Murphy, Private James Cooper, Private David Bell, Private William Griffiths.

For the very gallant and daring manner in which, on the 7th of May, 1867, they risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through a dangerous surf to the rescue of some of their comrades, who formed part of an expedition which had been sent to the Island of Little Andaman, by order of the Chief Commissioner of British Burmah, with the view of ascertaining the fate of the Commander and seven of the crew of the ship &quot; Assam Valley,&quot; who had landed there, and were supposed to have been murdered by the
natives.

The officer who commanded the troops on the occasion reports : About an hour later in the day Dr. Douglas, 2nd Battalion, 24th
.&quot;Regiment, and the four Privates referred&quot; to, gallantly manning the second gig, made their way through the surf almost to the shore, but finding their boat was half filled with water, they retired. A second attempt made by Dr. Douglas and party proved successful, five of us being safely passed through the surf to the boats outside. A third and last trip got the whole of the party left on shore safe to the boats. It is stated that Dr. Douglas accomplished these trips through the surf to the shore by no ordinary exertion. He stood in the bows of the boat, and worked her in an intrepid and seamanlike manner, cool to a degree, as
if what he was then doing was an ordinary act of every-day life. The four Privates behaved in an equally cool and collected manner, rowing through the roughest surf when the slightest hesitation or want of pluck on the part of any one of them would have been
attended by the gravest results. It is reported that seventeen officers and men were thus saved from what must otherwise have been a fearful risk, if not certainty of death.
==Later life==
He later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel, and served on the Northwest Frontier in India. He retired from the army in 1882 and settled in Lakefield, Ontario. He married the widow of Valentine Munbee McMaster VC. 
He was recruited for service as a medical officer during the North-West Rebellion in 1885, where he further distinguished himself, arriving in time to treat the wounded from the 3 May Battle of Fish Creek and caring for the soldiers wounded during the Battle of Batoche, on 14 May.

Campbell Mellis Douglas retired to England in 1894, and died at Hollington, Somerset, on 30 December 1909.

== Medal ==
His Victoria Cross is held in the collection of the Canadian War Museum &quot;(Ottawa, Ontario, Canada)&quot;.

<text>Piaget SA () is a Swiss luxury watchmaker and jeweller. Founded in 1874 by Georges Piaget in the village of La Côte-aux-Fées, Piaget is currently a subsidiary of the Swiss Richemont group.

Piaget was founded as a manufacturer of watch movements but began marketing its own line of watches in the 20th century.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1874, Georges Edouard Piaget set up his first workshop on the family farm, situated in the small village of La Côte-aux-Fées in the Swiss Jura mountains. Situated in the Neuchâtel region, the company was dedicated to crafting pocket watches and high-precision clock movements.

In 1911, Timothée Piaget, the son of Georges Piaget, took over the family firm. The company&#x27;s policy has been to be dedicated to the production of wristwatches ever since.

=== Registered Trademark ===
Under the guidance of the founder&#x27;s grandsons, Gérald and Valentin Piaget, the Piaget brand became a registered trademark in 1943. Since then, the manufacturer at La Côte-aux-Fées has produced its own creations.

As a result of this expansion, the family business opened a new factory in 1945, again in La Côte-aux-Fées.

=== Ultra-thin movement and jewellery ===
In 1957, the &quot;manufacture&quot; at La Côte-aux-Fées brought out the Calibre 9P, the first ultra-thin (2 mm), hand-wound mechanical movement.

Then, in 1960, the Piaget watchmakers developed the Calibre12P, the thinnest automatic movement in the world, with a thickness of 2.3 mm (made official by an entry in the Guinness Book of Records).

In addition to coin watches, ring watches, brooch watches and cufflink watches, Piaget created their first pieces of jewellery.

In 1957, the Emperador men&#x27;s watch was launched and since its relaunch in 1999 has become one of the brand&#x27;s emblematic models.

Building on the success of these ultra-thin movements, Piaget continued to innovate throughout the decades. In 2014, they introduced the Altiplano 900P, the world’s thinnest mechanical hand-wound watch at just 3.65mm thick. The Altiplano 900P broke the previous record held by Jaeger-LeCoultre, incorporating the case and movement into a single unit to achieve this remarkable thinness. This watch exemplified Piaget’s commitment to technical innovation and minimalist design, continuing their legacy in setting world records for ultra-thin watches.

The company&#x27;s expansion led to the opening of a new factory in Geneva, dedicated to jewellery and, in 1959, their first boutique.

In 2014, Piaget presented the Altiplano 900P. At 3.65 millimeters (around 1/8th of an inch) it is the world&#x27;s thinnest hand-wound mechanical watch.

=== Rapid expansion ===
In 1964, Piaget presented their first watches with dials worked in precious stones: lapis-lazuli, turquoise, onyx and tiger&#x27;s eye. Piaget then launched the cuff watch. 1976 saw the launch of the Calibre 7P, a quartz movement, during the quartz crisis.

The Piaget Polo watch with its avant-garde style, was brought out in 1979 and became one of the brand&#x27;s models. The Dancer collection was launched in 1986.

The company has been under the presidency of Yves Piaget since 1980.

=== Merger ===
The luxury Vendôme group, now Richemont, purchased the Piaget manufacture in 1988.

In the 1990s, several new collections were launched: Possession, Tanagra, Limelight and Miss Protocole with its interchangeable straps.

Piaget brought out the Altiplano watch and in 1999 reinvented one of their classics, the Emperador line.

Watchmaking was regrouped in one collection: Black Tie.

=== 21st century ===

In 2001, a Piaget Haute Horlogerie &quot;manufacture&quot; was opened in Plan-les-Ouates, just outside Geneva. The movements continued to be produced at La Côte-aux-Fées, the family&#x27;s birthplace. The new building grouped together over 40 professions in the fields of watchmaking and jewellery.

The manufacture developed mechanical movements and in 2002 brought out the first Piaget Manufacture tourbillon movement, the Calibre 600P, the thinnest tourbillon in the world with 3.5 mm thickness.

In 2004, Piaget celebrated their 130th anniversary.

== Watch and jewelry manufacturing ==

=== Ultra-thin movement ===
The brand is one of the forerunners in the creation of ultra-thin movements with the manual 9P and automatic 12P movements, respectively the thinnest in their category in the world in 1957 and 1960. This has led in more recent years to the modern developments 430P, 450P and 438P, with a thickness of only 2.1 millimetres. These latest innovations are used in the Altiplano line, the most recent of which is the Altiplano 900P. At 3.65 millimeter it is the world&#x27;s thinnest hand-wound mechanical watch.

=== Tourbillon movement ===
The Tourbillon movement was developed over a period of three years. Resulting from this research is the calibre 600P, the thinnest tourbillon movement in the world (3.5 mm). Its frame is composed of 42 minuscule parts, including three titanium bridges, it weighs just 0.2 grams. The flying tourbillon – mounted on a single axis – is topped by the initial “P”, which adds to the complexity of the poising.

=== Tourbillon skeleton movement ===
Piaget&#x27;s flying tourbillon movement is the thinnest of its kind in the world (3.5 mm). It is divided into segments corresponding to each of the 60 seconds, a sunburst guilloche decoration shines out from the tourbillon&#x27;s frame. The model is in gold and set with precious stones.

=== Retrograde movement ===
The Calibre 560P is a self-winding mechanical movement, designed, developed and built at the heart of Manufacture Piaget, and boasting a complex retrograde seconds mechanism. The hand traces an arc from 0 to 30 at 12 o’clock, then jumps back to its starting point. The design of the handcrafted finishing details took 24 months: circular Côtes de Genève decoration, stippled main plate, bevelled and hand-drawn bridges as well as blued screws.

=== Self-winding movement ===
A new generation of self-winding mechanical movements was launched in 2006. The 800P, with hours, minutes, central seconds hands and large date display, is equipped with two barrels, guaranteeing a power reserve of 72 hours. This 12-ligne calibre, beats at 21,600 vibrations per hour (3 hertz) and its timing is ensured by a screw-regulated balance. The 850P version displays small seconds and a second time zone on two sub-dials. A day/night indicator synchronised with the central time zone completes the display.

=== Art of enamelling ===
Piaget continue the tradition of miniature painting thanks to a traditional technique. The enameller begins by crushing and cleaning raw enamels to obtain a very fine powder, which is then mixed with essential oils to achieve the colour palette. The enamel is applied with a brush in successive fine layers, each of which is oven-fired at temperatures exceeding 800 °C. Each enamelled piece requires nearly twenty firings in the oven. The enamel and its colours are then set forever.

=== Setting and gemmology ===
Piaget owns the largest jewellery workshop in Geneva. Every stone is cut, adjusted and set by hand. The diamonds meet the highest standards of colour (D to G) and clarity (IF to VVS.) The diamonds are tested according to in-house guidelines based on their colour, size, clarity and carat.

== Environmental rating ==

In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. Piaget was ranked No. 3 among the 15 manufacturers and, along with 3 other manufacturers including Vacheron Constantin and Jaeger-LeCoultre, was given an average environmental rating as &quot;Upper Midfield&quot;, suggesting that the manufacturer has taken first actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change. According to Piaget&#x27;s official document, the company is committed to &quot;preserving natural resources and minimizing its environmental impact&quot;.

In jewelry and watchmaking industry, there are concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. The situation is especially serious in the developing countries which are top producers of gold, including China, Russia and South Africa. It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world&#x27;s annual gold production (over 2,000 tons), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use eco-friendly sourcing technologies.

== Prizes and awards ==
* In 2000, the jury of Montres Passion awarded the prize of “Watch of the Year” to the Emperador model.
* At the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix, the Piaget 1967 watch was awarded the “Design Watch Prize” in 2002 and the Altiplano XL watch won the “Ultra-Flat Watch Prize” in 2003.
* At the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix, Piaget were awarded the Ladies’ Jewellery Watch Prize in 2006, for their Limelight Party model.
* In 2006 the Limelight Party watch was also elected “Most beautiful watch of 2006” by the magazine Vogue Joyas Spain.
* The Piaget Polo Chronograph watch was elected “Watch of the Year 2007” in the Chronograph category by the jury of the French magazine La Revue des Montres.
* The Emperador model received the prize of Men&#x27;s Watch of the Year 2007 (Middle East Watch of the Year Awards 2007), organised by the magazine Alam Assaat Wal Moujawharat.
* The Limelight Party Secret watch was named “Watch of the Year 2007” in the Ladies’ Watch category by the Belgian magazine Passion des Montres.

=== Piaget Best Jeweller Prize ===
In 2005, Piaget created their Best Jeweller Prize. This prize is awarded to the most deserving student of the Certificat Fédéral de Capacité in watchmaking. Dorian Recordon was the first holder of the qualification to receive this prize.

<doc id="1194646" wikidata="Q7509073" url="?curid=1194646" title="Sidney Godley">
<text>Private Sidney Frank Godley VC (14 August 1889 – 29 June 1957) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first private soldier awarded the VC in World War I.

==Early life==
Godley was born on 14 August 1889 in East Grinstead, West Sussex, the son of Avis (née Newton) and Frank Godley. His mother died in 1896, and he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in Willesden, London. He was educated at Henry Street School, St John&#x27;s Wood and, upon moving to Sidcup, at Sidcup National School. From the ages of fourteen to twenty, he worked in an ironmonger&#x27;s store. On 13 December 1909, he joined The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) of the British Army as a private with the service number 13814.

==Victoria Cross==
Godley was 25 years old, and a Fusilier in the 4th Battalion, The Royal Fusiliers, British Army, during the Battle of Mons in the First World War when he performed an act for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 23 August 1914, at Mons, Belgium on the Mons-Condé Canal, Lieutenant Maurice Dease and Sidney Godley were manning the machine gun after the previous crews were either killed or wounded. When Lieutenant Dease had been mortally wounded and killed, and the order to retreat was issued, Private Godley offered to defend the Nimy Railway Bridge while the rest of the section retreated. Godley held the bridge single-handed under very heavy fire and was wounded twice. A shell fragment (&quot;shrapnel&quot;) entered his back when an artillery shell went off near him, and he was wounded in the head by a bullet. Despite his injuries he carried on the defence of the bridge while his comrades escaped. His citation read: &quot;For coolness and gallantry in fighting his machine gun under a hot fire for two hours after he had been wounded at Mons on 23 August&quot;.

H.C. O&#x27;Neill wrote this account of Godley&#x27;s actions in &quot;The Royal Fusiliers in the Great War&quot;.
&quot;The machine gun crews were constantly being knocked out. So cramped was their position that when a man was hit he had to be removed before another could take his place. The approach from the trench was across the open, and whenever a gun stopped Lieutenant Maurice Dease... went up to see what was wrong. To do this once called for no ordinary courage. To repeat it several times could only be done with real heroism. Dease was badly wounded on these journeys, but insisted on remaining at duty as long as one of his crew could fire. The third wound proved fatal, and a well deserved VC was awarded him posthumously. By this time both guns had ceased firing, and all the crew had been knocked out. In response to an inquiry whether anyone else knew how to operate the guns Private Godley came forward. He cleared the emplacement under heavy fire and brought the gun into action. But he had not been firing long before the gun was hit and put completely out of action. The water jackets of both guns were riddled with bullets, so that they were no longer of any use. Godley himself was badly wounded and later fell into the hands of the Germans.

Godley defended the bridge for two hours, until he ran out of ammunition. His final act was to dismantle the gun and throw the pieces into the canal. He attempted to crawl to safety, but advancing German soldiers caught him and took him to a prisoner of war camp. His wounds were treated, but he remained in camp until the Armistice with Germany in November 1918. Originally it was thought that he had been killed, but some time later it was found that he was a prisoner of war in a camp called Delotz at Dallgow-Döberitz. It was in the camp that he was informed that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross. Godley left the camp in 1918 after the guards fled their posts. He received the actual medal from King George V, at Buckingham Palace, on 15 February 1919.

On 19 July 2012 his medals were sold at auction for £276,000.

==Post-war life==
On 2 August 1919, Godley married Ellen Eliza Norman. He worked as a school caretaker in Tower Hamlets, London. He died in Epping Hospital on 29 June 1957. He was buried with full military honours in the town cemetery at Loughton, Essex, where he latterly resided.
He was portrayed in the BBC Three series &quot;Our World War&quot; (2014) by Theo Barklem-Biggs.

==Memorials==
* East Grinstead Town Council mounted a Blue Plaque on their offices.
* Loughton Town Council placed a Blue Plaque at 164 Torrington Drive to commemorate its famous former resident. On 23 August 2014, exactly 100 years to the hour from when he defended the bridge at Mons, a commemorative service was held at his graveside.
* in 1976 a new housing estate in Bexley, Greater London, was named after him.
* In 1992 Tower Hamlets Council named a block of flats &quot;Godley VC House&quot; (Digby Street, E2). A plaque attached to the flats also commemorates him.
* In 2014 the Department of Communities and Local Government gave each birth town of a World War I VC winner a paving stone to commemorate their deed. The paving stone in East Grinstead was unveiled by the Town Mayor with Communities Secretary Eric Pickles MP in attendance, at 11.00 am on 23 August 2014. This was the first day of unveilings. The paving stone is set at the base of the war memorial in East Grinstead High Street, as the original wish that they be incorporated in the pavement in front of the former home was not possible as the exact address of his home is not known.
* A small residential area in &quot;rue des Victoria Cross&quot; (&quot;&quot;Victoria Crosses street&quot;) in Saint-Symphorien near Mons, Belgium is named &quot;Clos Sidney Godley&quot; (&quot;Sidney Godley Enclosed Field&quot;&quot;).

<text>Maléon is a hamlet in the outskirts of le Moulinon (a suburb of Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut) in the Ardèche &quot;département&quot; of France. The hamlet is affiliated to Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut.

The Auzène river flows up through the hamlet, and as a result it is possible to swim in the river underneath the bridge. There are a few families living in Maléon, although there are cottages often frequented by tourists in the summer months.

<text>Brigadier-General Sir John Edmond Gough (25 October 1871 – 22 February 1915), was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early military career==
Gough, known as &quot;Johnnie&quot;, was the son of General Sir Charles Gough, and nephew of General Sir Hugh Gough, both of whom won the Victoria Cross (VC) during the Indian Mutiny in 1857. This gave the family the rare distinction of holding the VC simultaneously by father, brother and (father&#x27;s) son. He was also the younger brother of General Sir Hubert Gough (1870–1963), who led the British Fifth Army on the Western Front during the First World War.

Gough was, after graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) on 12 March 1892, and promoted to lieutenant on 6 December 1893. He served in British Central Africa in 1896, the Sudan in 1898, and took part in the Occupation of Crete (1898–99). Promoted to captain on 5 December 1898, he served in the Second Boer War from 1899 until 1902, and received a brevet rank of major on 29 November 1900.

After the war ended in June 1902, Gough was among a number of officers who left Cape Town on the in late July, arriving in Southampton the following month. In late 1902 he left the United Kingdom for Berbera, to be a staff officer in a flying column in the Somaliland Field Force, serving in British Somaliland during the Third Somaliland Expedition. He was seconded from his regiment in order to attend the Staff College, Camberley from 1904–05, was back in Somaliland in 1909, then returned to the college as an influential lecturer on war studies from 1909 to 1913. He was promoted to colonel in December 1909.

===Award of the VC===
Gough was 31 years old, and a brevet major in the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) during the Third Somaliland Expedition when the following event took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22 April 1903, Gough was in command of a column on the march which was attacked by an enemy force in superior numbers, that is the Darawiish army of Diiriye Guure near Daratoleh, British Somaliland. After conducting a successful defence, then a fighting withdrawal, Gough came back to help two captains (William George Walker and George Murray Rolland). The captains were helping a mortally wounded officer. They managed to get the wounded officer onto a camel, but then he was wounded again and died immediately. The two captains won the VC for their actions. However, Gough played down his own part in the event. It was not until late in the year that the true story came out indicating that Gough was equally deserving of recognition. He was subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross in January 1904. The King Edward VII presented the medal to him at Buckingham Palace on 29 February 1904. He was appointed an aide-de-camp to the King in August 1907 and promoted to major in May 1908.

==Curragh Incident==
Prior to the outbreak of the First World War, Gough had been serving at the Staff College as a general staff officer, grade 1 (GSO1), an appointment he relinquished in January 1913 and was then placed on half-pay. After being removed from half-pay in October, he was promoted to temporary brigadier general and succeeded Brigadier General Francis Davies as brigadier general, general staff (BGGS) effectively chief of staff, to Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig at Aldershot Command. He played a role in the Curragh Incident in March 1914, in which his brother and other cavalry officers stationed in Ireland threatened to resign rather than coerce Ulster Protestants who had no wish to be part of an Irish state governed from Dublin. Gough accompanied his brother, who had been suspended from duty, to a meeting in London with the adjutant general, Major General Spencer Ewart, on the morning of Sunday 22 March 1914, where Hubert confirmed that he would have obeyed a direct order to move against the Ulster population. Johnnie was in the War Office on 23 March, when French (CIGS) agreed to Hubert&#x27;s demand that he amend a Cabinet document to promise that the British Army would not be used to enforce Irish Home Rule on Ulster. French may have been acting in the belief that the matter needed to be resolved quickly after learning from Haig that afternoon that all the officers of &quot;Aldershot&quot; Command would resign if Hubert were punished.

==First World War==

Gough went to France as a brigadier-general in mid-August 1914 with the British Expeditionary Force, as chief-of-staff to Douglas Haig&#x27;s I Corps. In early 1915 he continued as Haig&#x27;s principal staff officer when Haig was given command of the newly created British First Army. By February 1915 whilst working on planning for the forthcoming attack at Neuve Chapelle, Gough was chosen to command one of the British New Army divisions. This appointment was due to commence sometime in March 1915 and would have entailed his promotion to the rank of major-general.

==Death==
On 20 February 1915 Gough was visiting his old Battalion, the 2nd Battalion, The Rifle Brigade, in the line at Fauquissart, about 3 km north of Neuve Chapelle, about 2 km west of Aubers to luncheon at its H.Q.&#x27;s Officers&#x27; Mess before his imminent departure to the British Isles to assume the command of a new division. Whilst in the line he was hit in the abdomen by a chance ricochet of a German bullet which mortally wounded him. The event was an unlucky one as the bullet that struck him was thought to have been a single shot fired from approximately 1000 yards away from somewhere in the German lines. He was conveyed to the 25th Field Ambulance at nearby Estaires, about 7 km behind the front line, where he succumbed to the wound and died in the early morning of 22 February 1915. His body was buried that afternoon in Estaires Communal Cemetery, located 7 miles to the South-West of Armentières, in Plot II, Row A, Grave No. 7. On 20 April 1915 Gough was posthumously knighted, being gazetted KCB on 22 April 1915.

==Assessments==
Gough was quoted as making a famous remark in November 1914 that was to be repeated as inspirational in the dark days of March 1918. &quot;As he watched the enemy swarming over a low ridge one of his staff said the fight was decided. Gough turned with his eyes ablaze and exclaimed: &#x27;God will never let those devils win.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Through Johnnie&#x27;s death Haig lost a sounding board which was highly constructive yet far from uncritical. Had Johnnie gone on to command a division then it seems almost certain that, as predicted by so many contemporaries, he would have risen much further in the army. Johnnie was a convinced &#x27;westerner&#x27; in strategic terms and a &#x27;fighting general&#x27;. The army high command&#x27;s commitment to the Western Front and to strategic offensives on that front would not have changed had Johnnie lived, but as he had demonstrated in his Staff College days he was a supreme realist and the conduct of these offensives might well have been modified by his influence with and, especially, by his ability to relate to Douglas Haig.&quot;

A contemporary, General Sir George Barrow, described John Gough as &quot;a twentieth-century Chevalier Bayard, had he lived he might have gone to the top of the British Army&quot;. To some extent Hubert Gough replaced his brother as Haig&#x27;s sounding board.

==Memorials==

There is a memorial to Gough in Winchester Cathedral; his Victoria Cross medal is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum, in Winchester, England.

<text>Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, (1 March 1909 – 12 February 1942) was a distinguished Irish pilot in the Fleet Air Arm who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy awarded to members of Commonwealth forces. Esmonde earned this award while in command of a torpedo bomber squadron in the Second World War - in an action known as Operation Fuller, the &#x27;Channel Dash’.

==Early life==
Esmonde was born on 1 March 1909 in Thurgoland, Yorkshire, near Barnsley. His mother, Eily O’Sullivan, was his father&#x27;s second wife. Dr John Joseph Esmonde (1862–1915) had married her in 1904, after his first wife died in 1901. Dr. Esmonde was an Irish Catholic, a former Irish MP, who was in general practice in Yorkshire.

Esmonde had six natural siblings (including a twin brother) and six half-siblings - three male, three female - from his father&#x27;s first marriage to Rose McGuinness. The natural siblings were: Owen, Donal, John Witham, his twin James, Carmel and Patrick. His half-brothers were: Sir John Esmonde, 14th Baronet, who served in the First World War; Second Lieutenant Geoffrey Esmonde (1897–1916), who was killed in action in the First World War serving with the 26th Tyneside Irish Battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers; and Sir Anthony Esmonde, 15th Baronet.

His father, died in 1915, when Esmonde and his siblings were all quite young. He had been serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and succumbed to pneumonia, after being laid low by over-work.

Though born in England, Esmonde&#x27;s parents were from Ireland and the family returned to the Esmonde family&#x27;s ancestral home - Esmonde baronets - in Drominagh, County Tipperary. He was educated by the Jesuits, first at Wimbledon College in London and then at Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare, Ireland.

Esmonde was commissioned into the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a pilot officer on probation on 28 December 1928. During the early 1930s, Esmonde served first in the RAF, and then transferred to the Fleet Air Arm where he served in the Mediterranean when responsibility for naval aviation was returned to the Royal Navy. Upon leaving the navy in 1934, he flew for Imperial Airways. and amongst other feats he flew flying boats and the first surcharged airmail to Australia.

==Second World War==
===Early wartime career===
At the start of the Second World War, he returned to the Fleet Air Arm with the rank of lieutenant commander. His first sea posting was to , which was sunk in September 1939. He returned to sea duty on board after a series of postings to shore-based stations.

On the night of 24 May 1941, Esmonde led No. 825 Naval Air Squadron&#x27;s nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers in an attack against the . This attack took place after the Battle of the Denmark Strait, in which &quot;Bismarck&quot; sank . The biplanes flying from &quot;Victorious&quot; made a 193 km (120-mile) flight in foul North Atlantic weather and one torpedo hit the &quot;Bismarck&quot; amidships, leading either directly or indirectly through hard manoeuvring to earlier damage opening up, causing further flooding and a boiler room rendered unusable. The Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet wrote in his despatch to the Admiralty that &#x27;This attack, by a squadron so lately embarked in a new carrier, in unfavourable weather conditions, was magnificently carried out and reflects the greatest credit on all concerned,&#x27; adding &#x27;There can be little doubt that the hit was largely responsible for the &quot;Bismarck&quot; finally being brought to action and sunk,&#x27; (although it was another torpedo hit by aircraft of &quot;Ark Royal&quot; several days later that led to the battleship&#x27;s final destruction). Esmonde was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order on 11 February 1942 for his leadership and actions (the award was announced on 16 September 1941).

His squadron was serving on when she was torpedoed in November 1941. Attempts to tow her to Gibraltar were abandoned, and on 14 November 1941 she sank. The Swordfish of the squadron ferried some of the crew off the ship before she sank; Esmonde was mentioned in dispatches for his actions on this occasion.

===Channel Dash===
Esmonde earned his Victoria Cross when he led his squadron against elements of the German fleet which were making the &quot;Channel Dash&quot; (Operation &quot;Cerberus&quot;) from Brest in an attempt to return to their home bases at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel through the English Channel. On 12 February 1942 off the coast of England, 32-year-old Lieutenant Commander Esmonde led a detachment of six Fairey Swordfish in an attack on the German battlecruisers and and the heavy cruiser . All three had left Brest unopposed, and, with a strong escort of smaller craft and fighter aircraft.

The British had long-anticipated the movement of these ships and had formulated a combined operation of attack by sea, air and land artillery, as the Germans approached the Straits of Dover. The plan was termed Operation Fuller. It was not executed well, principally because the Germans vessels were not detected until they were almost at Dover. Consequently, everything was hurried and poorly coordinated.

Esmonde’s squadron received orders to attack, but no fighter coverage materialised. He waited as long as he felt he could for his escorts to appear, but eventually took off without them. One of the fighter squadrons (10 Supermarine Spitfires of No. 72 Squadron RAF) did rendezvous with Esmonde&#x27;s squadron; the two squadrons were later attacked by enemy fighters of JG 2 and JG 26 as part of Operation &quot;Donnerkeil&quot;, the German air superiority plan for the mission. The subsequent fighting left all of the planes in Esmonde&#x27;s squadron damaged, and caused them to become separated from their fighter escort.

The torpedo bombers continued their attack, in spite of their damage and lack of fighter protection. There was heavy anti-aircraft fire from the German ships, and Esmonde&#x27;s aeroplane possibly sustained a direct hit from anti-aircraft fire that destroyed most of one of the port wings of his Swordfish biplane. Esmonde led his flight through a screen of the enemy destroyers and other small vessels protecting the battleships. He was still 2,700 metres from his target when he was hit by a Focke-Wulf Fw 190, resulting in his aircraft bursting into flames and crashing into the sea. The remaining aircraft continued the attack, but all were shot down by enemy fighters; only five of the 18 crew survived the action. The four surviving officers received the Distinguished Service Order, and the enlisted survivor was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal.

The courage of the Swordfish crews was noted by friend and foe alike. Admiral Bertram Ramsay later wrote, &quot;In my opinion the gallant sortie of these six Swordfish aircraft constitutes one of the finest exhibitions of self-sacrifice and devotion to duty the war had ever witnessed&quot;, while Admiral Otto Ciliax in the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; described &quot;The mothball attack of a handful of ancient planes, piloted by men whose bravery surpasses any other action by either side that day&quot;. As he watched the smoking wrecks of the Swordfish falling into the sea, Captain Hoffmann of the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; exclaimed, &quot;Poor fellows, they are so very slow, it is nothing but suicide for them to fly against these big ships&quot;. Willhelm Wolf aboard the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; wrote, &quot;What an heroic stage for them to meet their end! Behind them their homeland, which they had just left with their hearts steeled to their purpose, still in view&quot;.

The award of the VC was gazetted on 3 March 1942, the citation read:

In fact, no torpedo hits were achieved.

Esmonde was remembered in Winston Churchill&#x27;s famous broadcast speech on 13 May 1945, &quot;Five years of War&quot;, as having defended Ireland&#x27;s honour:

Seven weeks later Lieutenant Commander Esmonde&#x27;s body, still in his lifejacket, was washed ashore in the Thames Estuary near the River Medway. Esmonde was buried in the Woodlands Cemetery, Gillingham, Kent on 30 April 1942.

His great-uncle Thomas Esmonde, had been awarded the Victoria Cross in the Crimean War.

<text>Frederick William Hall, (21 February 1885 – 24 April 1915) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Life ==
Hall was born in Kilkenny, Ireland, on 21 February 1885. His father was a British Army soldier from London. Hall emigrated to Canada approximately 1910, and lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Hall was working as a clerk in Winnipeg when the First World War started. He enlisted in the 8th Canadian Infantry Battalion (90th Winnipeg Rifles) at Valcartier Camp, Quebec, on 26 September 1914. He already had military experience. In addition to serving in the 106th Winnipeg Light Infantry of the Canadian Militia, he had spent over 12 years in the British Army’s Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). He saw service in India and was awarded the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. A teetotaller, Hall was a member of the British Army’s Temperance Association while with the Cameronians.

He was 30 years old, and a company sergeant-major in the 8th Battalion (90th Winnipeg Rifles), Canadian Expeditionary Force, during the First World War when he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Victoria Cross==

The citation in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; reads: 

During the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium, Hall discovered a number of men were missing. On the ridge above he could hear moans from the wounded men. Under cover of darkness, he went to the top of the ridge on two separate occasions and returned each time with a wounded man.

By nine o&#x27;clock on the morning of the 24th there were still men missing. In full daylight and under sustained and intense enemy fire, Hall, Corporal Payne and Private Rogerson crawled out toward the wounded. Payne and Rogerson were both wounded, but returned to the shelter of the front line. When a wounded man who was lying some 15 yards from the trench called for help, Hall endeavoured to reach him in the face of heavy fire by the enemy but was shot in the head. The soldier he had attempted to help, Private Arthur Edwin Clarkson, was also killed.

==Memorials==

Frederick William Hall has no known grave. His name is on the Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing in Ypres, Belgium, honouring 56,000 troops from Britain, Australia, Canada and India whose final resting place in the Ypres Salient is unknown. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission records that he was the son of Mary Hall, of Leytonstone, London, and the late Bombardier F. Hall.

Hall lived on Pine Street in Winnipeg. In 1925, Pine Street was renamed Valour Road because three Victoria Cross recipients resided on the same 700 block of that street: Hall, Leo Clarke and Robert Shankland. It is believed to be the only street in the Commonwealth of Nations to have three Victoria Cross recipients live on it. A bronze plaque is mounted on a street lamp at the corner of Portage Avenue and Valour Road to tell the tale of the three men.

He is also remembered in St Helens, Lancashire, where he lived at the time of the 1891 United Kingdom census and used as his home address until he left for Canada in 1910.

His medals are in the Canadian War Museum. The museum has acquired all three Valour Road Victoria Cross medals and they are on permanent display in Ottawa.

<text>John Hannah, VC (27 November 1921 – 7 June 1947) was a Scottish airman and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born in Paisley and educated at Bankhead Primary School and Victoria Drive Secondary School, Glasgow, Hannah joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1939. After training as a wireless operator was promoted to sergeant in 1940. He was posted to No. 83 Squadron, flying Handley Page Hampden bombers as a wireless operator/gunner.

==Victoria Cross==

On 15 September 1940 over Antwerp, Belgium, after a successful attack on German barges, the Handley Page Hampden bomber (serial P1355) in which Sergeant Hannah was wireless operator/air gunner, was subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire, starting a fire which spread quickly. The rear gunner and navigator had to bail out and Sergeant Hannah could have acted likewise, but instead he remained to fight the fire, first with two extinguishers and then with his bare hands. He sustained terrible injuries, but succeeded in putting out the fire and the pilot was able to bring the almost wrecked aircraft back safely.

The Canadian pilot of the aircraft, Flying Officer Clare Connor, recommended Hannah receive the Victoria Cross. Connor himself was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. King George VI presented the decorations to Hannah and Connor at an investiture in Buckingham Palace.

Eighteen years old at the time of his Victoria Cross action, Hannah was the youngest recipient of the medal for aerial operations and the youngest for the Second World War.

===Victoria Cross citation===
The announcement and accompanying citation for the Victoria Cross was published in supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 1 October 1940, reading

==Later life and death==

Hannah contracted tuberculosis only a year later in mid-late 1941; it is likely that his weakened condition following the severe burns he sustained during his Victoria Cross action undermined his resistance to infection. His illness necessitated his eventual discharge from the RAF, with full disability pension, in December 1942. However, unable thereafter to take up a full-time job, he initially took a job as a taxi driver (using a car his aunt had lent him) but due to increasing ill health he returned the car in 1943. He then found it increasingly difficult to support his wife and three small daughters, and his health ultimately gave out. He died on 7 June 1947 at Markfield Sanatorium in Leicester, where he had been lying for four months. He is buried in the churchyard of St James the Great Church, Church Hill, Birstall, north Leicester. His wife, Janet Hannah, is also interred there with her husband. An inscription to her reads &quot;Loved and remembered always Janet Hannah Aged 83 years&quot;.

Hannah&#x27;s headstone is inscribed: &quot;Courageous Duty Done In Love, He Serves His Pilot Now Above.&quot; His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon, London.

<doc id="1194669" wikidata="Q8013457" url="?curid=1194669" title="William Hardham">
<text>William James Hardham, VC (31 July 1876 – 13 April 1928) was a New Zealand soldier who was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that could be awarded at the time to military personnel of the British Empire.

Born in Wellington, Hardham was a blacksmith and part-time soldier in the local militia when he volunteered to serve with the New Zealand Military Forces in the Second Boer War. Posted to the 4th Contingent in 1900, he was on a patrol in the South African Transvaal when it was ambushed. He rode his horse to the rescue of a wounded soldier while under heavy fire and for this he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Discharged from the New Zealand Military Forces in 1901, he rejoined for another period of service in the Second Boer War but was only briefly in South Africa before being sent to England for the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.

Returning to civilian life, he became increasingly involved in rugby administration with the Wellington Rugby Football Union; he had played representative rugby for Wellington in his youth. He also continued to serve in the militia. When the First World War began, he volunteered for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and was posted to the Wellington Mounted Rifles (WMR) as a captain. Wounded during the Gallipoli Campaign, he was repatriated to New Zealand. On recovery he was made commandant of Queen Mary Hospital in Hanmer Springs but desired a return to the NZEF and a posting overseas. He rejoined the WMR, then in Palestine, in late 1917 but his health was poor and affected the remainder of his service in the military. Having reached the rank of major by the end of the war in 1918, he was discharged from the NZEF. Returning to civilian life, he worked for a newspaper and later the Public Works Department as well as being involved in veterans&#x27; affairs. He died in 1928 at the age of 51.

==Early life==
William James Hardham was born on 31 July 1876 in Wellington to George Hardham, a labourer, and his wife, Ann Hardham . He received his education at Mount Cook School. When his schooling was completed, he obtained work as a blacksmith. A keen sportsman, he played rugby for the Petone Rugby Club and also represented Wellington in provincial rugby. He would eventually play 53 games for Wellington. His military career began in 1895, when he joined the Wellington Naval Artillery, a part-time militia unit, serving with the Petone Company.

==South Africa==
The Second Boer War arose from tensions between the Boer South African Republic and the British authorities in the Transvaal of South Africa over control of the region. In September 1899, just prior to the commencement of hostilities, New Zealand&#x27;s Parliament offered the British Government a mounted rifles contingent from the New Zealand Military Forces for service in South Africa, which was accepted. Volunteers were plentiful and two contingents had already left for the war by 1900.

Hardham was among those who volunteered and he was posted to the 4th New Zealand Contingent as a farrier sergeant major. Landing in Portuguese East Africa in April 1900, the Fourth Contingent, nicknamed the &quot;Rough Riders&quot;, were deployed as part of the Rhodesian Field Force around Mafeking. Aside from a brief action at Ottoshoop in August, the Rough Riders spent the majority of their war service in the Transvaal, carrying out reconnaissance patrols and pursuing Boer commandos. As part of the effort to deprive the Boers of resources, they also helped to destroy crops and round up civilians and cattle, during which they occasionally skirmished with armed commandos. On 28 January 1901, Hardham was on a patrol near Naauwpoort, in the Transvaal, when it was ambushed by twenty Boers. Although the patrol was able to withdraw, one man was wounded and his horse was shot from under him. Seeing this, Hardham rode to his aid and extracted him to safety while under heavy gunfire.

For his actions, Hardham was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC) by General Herbert Kitchener, commander of British forces in South Africa. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a military personnel of the British Empire. The local commander, Major-General Ian Hamilton, believed the Distinguished Conduct Medal, second only to the VC, was a more appropriate form of recognition for Hardham. However, the commander-in-chief of the British Army, Field Marshal Earl Roberts, concurred with Kitchener and the VC nomination was approved. The citation for Hardham&#x27;s VC, the first to be awarded to a New Zealander of a unit of the New Zealand Military Forces serving overseas, read:

Hardham was presented with the VC, the only such award made to a New Zealander in the Boer War, on 1 July 1901 by George, Prince of Wales, who was in South Africa on a visit. This event took place even before the award was officially announced in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;. At the time of the presentation of the VC, the back of the suspender bar and reverse face of the medal itself was not engraved with his name, rank, unit and date of the action that resulted in the award, in a departure from normal practice; Hardham presumably arranged the engraving himself later. The Rough Riders spent the final weeks of their service in South Africa in operations to the north of Klerksdorp, patrolling and denying the Boer commandos food. They were also involved in the capture of a convoy of Koos de la Rey&#x27;s commando in March 1901. The contingent left for New Zealand in June 1901 and Hardham was discharged two months later.

He volunteered to serve again in South Africa, this time with the Ninth Contingent and was commissioned as a lieutenant in February 1902. Soon after the Ninth Contingent&#x27;s arrival in South Africa in late April, Hardham and over 50 other New Zealand mounted riflemen, serving in South Africa, were sent to England to join up with the official New Zealand party attending the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra and participated in a parade of colonial troops in London on 1 July 1902.

==Civilian life==
Hardham returned to civilian life after his visit to London and continued to serve with the Naval Artillery. In 1910, having attained the rank of sergeant and served as a volunteer in the militia for 16 years, he was awarded the Long and Efficient Service Medal. In addition to his work as a blacksmith, he also increasingly became involved in rugby administration; in 1908 he commenced a six-year term on the committee of the Wellington Rugby Football Union.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Hardham volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), being raised for service overseas. Appointed as a captain in the Wellington Mounted Rifles (WMR), he was second in command of its 2nd Squadron. Travelling on the troopship &quot;Arawa&quot;, he embarked with the main body of the NZEF for the Middle East in October 1914. His regiment was part of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and was destined for service in the Gallipoli campaign. Arriving in Egypt, the WMR spent several months in training and during this time Hardham helped to organise sporting events to keep the men occupied.

===Gallipoli===
While the WMR was not involved in the initial landings on 25 April 1915 at Gallipoli, it arrived on the peninsula a few weeks later on 12 May, without their horses. Within days, the WMR was involved in the fighting. During the Turkish assault on Anzac Cove on 19 May, the WMR helped fend off attacks at Quinn&#x27;s Post. Later in the day, Hardham was ordered to lead an attacking party on the stretch of ridge named the Nek, from where Turkish soldiers were sniping. The area over which the party was to advance was swept with Turkish machine-gun fire and the orders to attack were cancelled. Soon afterwards, he participated in the Battle for No.3 Post, an effort to capture a Turkish outpost. Seized by the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on 28 May, a squadron of the WMR immediately took over the position but were attacked in the evening and cut off for over 24 hours. Involved in the efforts to relieve the beleaguered squadron, Hardham received serious wounds; another officer who came to his aid was also wounded. The trapped WMR soldiers were relieved on 30 May and the position, too exposed to further attacks from the Turks, was abandoned.

===Later war service===
Although treated for his injuries, which were to his hand and chest, Hardham was repatriated to New Zealand in February 1916. Soon after his return, on 16 March, he married Constance Evelyn née Parsonson at St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Wellington. His brother was the best man for the ceremony. He agitated for a return to active duty with the NZEF but instead received an appointment as commandant of Queen Mary Hospital in Hanmer Springs. Initially a temporary position, he did so well in the post that it was made permanent and he was promoted to major.

Hardham still sought a role with the NZEF and in late 1917 the military authorities relented, and he was able to rejoin the WMR, which was serving in Palestine. His health was poor and he was ill for much of the remainder of the war. He was ultimately repatriated back to New Zealand suffering from malaria.

==Later life and legacy==

After the war, Hardham was discharged from the NZEF but sought a role in the New Zealand Military Forces as a professional soldier. His application was declined on account of his health. Unable to return to his work as a blacksmith because of his poor physical condition, he found employment at &quot;The Dominion&quot;, a Wellington-based newspaper, and later with the Public Works Department. He was involved in veterans&#x27; affairs, being a club manager at the Wellington Returned Soldiers&#x27; Association and organising Anzac Day parades.

Hardham was still involved with rugby administration, serving again on the committee of the Wellington Rugby Football Union from 1921 to 1925. He was eventually made a life member. As a schoolboy, the future rugby commentator Winston McCarthy met Hardham, later describing him as &quot;a very silent, simple man&quot; who gave him a historic book on rugby.

Suffering from stomach cancer, Hardham died at his home in the suburb of Ngaio on 13 April 1928, at the age of 51. He received a military funeral, and among the attendees was the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Gordon Coates. Buried at Karori Cemetery in Wellington, Hardham was survived by his wife. The couple had no children. His VC is displayed at the National Army Museum at Waiouru. The Hardham Cup, a competition trophy in Wellington club rugby, is named in his honour and he is also remembered by a plaque in Queen&#x27;s Gardens in Dunedin.

<text>The Penistone Line is operated by Northern Trains in the West Yorkshire Metro and Travel South Yorkshire areas of northern England. It connects Huddersfield and Sheffield via Penistone and Barnsley, serving many rural communities. Metrocards (Zone 5) can be used for travel between Huddersfield and Denby Dale and intermediate stations.

== Line details ==


=== Huddersfield–Penistone ===
The first section of line between and was opened on 1 July 1850 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR). From the joint L&amp;YR/London and North Western Railway Huddersfield station, trains ran south to Springwood Junction (south of Huddersfield) on the London and North Western Railway Leeds–Manchester main line, where the L&amp;YR line began; from there the route was as follows:
* &quot;Springwood Tunnel&quot;
* &quot;Meltham Branch Junction&quot; was the junction for the now disused Meltham branch line
* &quot;Lockwood Viaduct&quot;
* &quot;Robin Hood Tunnel&quot;
* &quot;Honley Tunnel&quot;
* was the junction for the now closed Holmfirth Branch Line.
* &quot;Thurstonland Tunnel&quot;
* also serves Shelley
* &quot;Clayton West Junction&quot; for the now closed Clayton West branch line Clayton West Junction signal box
* &quot;Cumberworth Tunnel&quot;
* Denby Dale also serves Upper Cumberworth and Lower Cumberworth, and was originally &quot;Denby Dale &amp; Cumberworth&quot;
* &quot;Denby Dale Viaduct&quot;
* &quot;Wellhouse Tunnel&quot;
* &quot;Penistone Viaduct&quot;
* The station was opened with the line; in 1874, a joint L&amp;YR/Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (GCR from 1899) station was built to replace the original M.S.&amp; L.R. Penistone station which served only the line to Manchester. This line was closed to passenger traffic on 5 January 1970 and completely 11 years later.

The southern part of that section follows the upper reaches of the River Don.

=== Penistone–Barnsley–Sheffield ===
At Penistone, the route joins the former Great Central Railway (GCR) line from Manchester via the Woodhead Tunnel, travelling eastwards. It deviates from the former main line towards Sheffield Victoria at a point once known as Barnsley Junction, and heads towards that town beyond which it takes a circuitous route via Wombwell before going south to Sheffield. The route is as follows:
* Penistone : the junction here was originally known as Huddersfield Junction.
* junction, originally Barnsley Junction, with the direct line to that town and West Silkstone Junction, a few miles further, via Worsborough to Wombwell and the Wath marshalling yard (freight-only) (closed)
* (was Silkstone: the station was re-opened when the direct line to Sheffield closed and trains diverted via Barnsley on 16 May 1983)
* (as for Silkstone – a re-opened station)
* (closed)
* the line then descends steeply, latterly at 1 in 50 to the former location of the junction which brought the M.S.&amp; L. R. trains from Barnsley Court House to the Penistone line.
* the line joins the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway&#x27;s line from Wakefield and enters the former Barnsley Exchange, rebuilt and renamed Barnsley Interchange.
* Barnsley Interchange. Barnsley was served by three railway companies: L&amp;Y, GCR, and Midland; and by two stations: Exchange and Court House. The latter is now closed. The Penistone Line continues to Sheffield, leaving the station over Jumble Lane crossing on tracks of the former South Yorkshire Railway (later Great Central) but only for a short distance. A connection made in April 1960 by British Rail gave access to the Midland route towards Sheffield (and also enabled the closure of Court House station):
* junction for the Birdwell and Pilley freight-only branch
* passes over Swaithe Viaduct high over the Worsborough line
* (was Wombwell West)
* (was Elsecar &amp; Hoyland)
* Wentworth &amp; Hoyland Common (closed)
* &quot;Tankersley Tunnel&quot;
* (was Chapeltown South).(not all trains stop here – check WY Metro) This station being the first to be rebuilt under the guidance of the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive was moved some 500 yards further south and new approaches made from the town centre and via the ASDA car park.
* Meadowhall Interchange (the previous station on the site was named Wincobank and Meadowhall)
* , closed in the 1990s
* , closed in the 1990s.
* Sheffield Midland

Up until 1983, trains between Huddersfield and Sheffield travelled due south from Penistone direct to Sheffield via the old GCR line. The diversion to Barnsley officially opened in May 1983, and originally, the line was marketed with the brand name of &quot;The Hurrier&quot;.

=== Network Rail ===
The 32.6-km section of line from Springwood Junction (between and ) to Barnsley Station Junction (between and ) constitutes Network Rail route LNE 15A.

== The Penistone Line today ==

The Penistone Line Partnership, representing local interests, is a long-time supporter of services on the route and has provided music and real-ale trains.

In November 2005, the line was named as a pilot project within the Department for Transport&#x27;s Community Rail Strategy. The section from Barnsley to Huddersfield was designated a community rail line in May 2006. This led to line speed improvements at Cumberworth Tunnel and improved reliability. Passenger numbers have continued to grow to a record 1,030,000 in 2005 – a stark contrast from the late 1970s and early 1980s when the line was under threat of closure due to falling levels of patronage and the possible loss of revenue support from both PTEs.

The entire Barnsley to Huddersfield route was originally double tracked. However, following modernisation works in 1983 and 1989, it was reduced to a single line, apart from a pair of crossing loops at Penistone and between Stocksmoor and Shepley. Control was split between the Huddersfield and Barnsley signal boxes but, by 2018, the Rail Operating Centre at was to take over the signalling of the entire route.

=== Tram-train trial ===
On 18 March 2008, the Department for Transport released details of a proposal to trial tram-trains on the Penistone Line, the first use of such vehicles in the UK. The trial was to start in 2010 and last for two years. Northern Rail, the operator of passenger services on the line, asked potential manufacturers to tender for the design and construction of five new vehicles, which Northern Rail would subsequently lease. In addition, Network Rail planned to spend £15 million modifying track and stations to make them compatible with the new vehicles.

However, it was announced on 15 September 2009 that a city tram-train trial between Rotherham and Sheffield would replace the Penistone Line scheme.

<text>Khudadad Khan, (20 October 1888 – 8 March 1971) was a Pakistani recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. During the First World War, on 31 October 1914 at Hollebeke, Belgium, while serving in the British Indian Army, he performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

He was the first British Indian subject to earn the Victoria Cross, after members of the British Indian Army became eligible for the Victoria Cross in 1911, replacing the Indian Order of Merit first class.

==Life==
Born on 20 October 1888 in the village of Dab in Chakwal District of the Punjab Province, British India (now Pakistan) in a Punjabi Muslim Rajput family of Minhas clan, Khudadad Khan was a Sepoy in the 129th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own Baluchis, British Indian Army (now 11th Battalion The Baloch Regiment of Pakistan Army). The battalion formed part of the Indian Corps, which was sent to France and Flanders in 1914 to reinforce the British forces fighting on the Western Front during the First World War. He took part in the defence of Lille until it was overrun by the Germans.

In October 1914, when the Germans launched the First Battle of Ypres, the newly arrived 129th Baluchis were rushed to the frontline to support the hard-pressed British troops. On 31 October, two companies of the Baluchis bore the brunt of the main German attack near the village of Gheluvelt in Hollebeke Sector. The out-numbered Baluchis fought gallantly but were overwhelmed after suffering heavy casualties. Sepoy Khudadad Khan&#x27;s machine-gun team, along with one other, kept their guns in action throughout the day, preventing the Germans from making the final breakthrough. The other gun was disabled by a shell and eventually, Khudadad Khan&#x27;s own team was overrun. All the men were killed by bullets or bayonets except Khudadad Khan who, despite being badly wounded, had continued working his gun. He was left for dead by the enemy but managed to crawl back to his regiment during the night. Thanks to his bravery, and that of his fellow Baluchis, the Germans were held up just long enough for Indian and British reinforcements to arrive. They strengthened the line, and prevented the German Army from reaching the vital ports; Khan was awarded the Victoria Cross.

=== Official citation ===

He was supposed to be awarded the medal on the same day, 5 December 1914, as Darwan Singh Negi VC but Khan was too sick. Khan was presented with the Victoria Cross by King George V during a visit to troops in France on 26 January 1915. As such Khan is regarded as the first Indian recipient, as Negi&#x27;s VC action was on a later date.

=== Later life and legacy ===

Khan was subsequently sent for treatment at the Royal Pavilion military hospital in Brighton. Khan retired as a Subedar in 1929, after which he settled in the Punjab. He made several visits to Britain in connection with the Victoria Cross, including the Victoria Cross centenary review parade in Hyde Park, London, in June 1956. He died on 8 March 1971 aged 82, and is buried in Chak No. 25, Mandi Bahauddin. His Victoria Cross is on display at his ancestral house in Village Dab (Chakwal), Pakistan. He was at the time of his death the last surviving British Indian World War I veteran who had served on the Western Front.

A statue of Khudadad Khan is at the entrance of the Pakistan Army Museum in Rawalpindi.

In 2016 a play by Ishy Din, &quot;Wipers&quot;, about Khudadad Khan&#x27;s feat was put on in a number of English theatres.

<text>Amblecote is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley in the West Midlands, England. It lies immediately north of the historic town of Stourbridge on the southwestern edge of the West Midlands conurbation. Historically, Amblecote was in the parish of Oldswinford, but unlike the rest of the parish (which was in Worcestershire) it was in Staffordshire, and as such was administered separately. It borders Audnam, Quarry Bank and Wollaston.

==History==
Amblecote was a village in Staffordshire near the River Stour, which formed the border with the county of Worcestershire. Amblecote was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Old Swinford, which was otherwise in Worcestershire. It was a separate division for rating purposes from those Stourbridge and Oldswinford (the two Worcestershire divisions of the parish). Since rates were separately collected for it, it became a civil parish in 1866. In 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, the parish of Amblecote became part of Kingswinford Rural District, but became an urban district by itself in 1898. The urban district council of Amblecote used to meet in the former &quot;Fish Inn&quot; public house which is now a Chinese restaurant and historic relics of this time remain at the building, such as the civic clock. This civic clock has recently been restored and opened up by Pat Martin, ward councillor in 2009. Amblecote was divided between the County Borough of Dudley and the Municipal Borough of Stourbridge and Brierley Hill Urban District on 1 April 1966, with the area to the east of the railway line becoming part of Brierley Hill and the remainder part of Stourbridge. This is reflected in the area&#x27;s postcodes, being split between the DY5 and DY8 postal districts. On 1 April 1966 the parish was abolished and merged with Stourbridge and Dudley. In 1961 the parish had a population of 3009.

In 1974, under the Local Government Act, the entirety of Amblecote became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, in the new West Midlands county.

From the 17th century, there have been glassworks in Amblecote, including Thomas Webb and Dennis Hall, and together with the adjoining village of Wordsley, formed the main centre of the Stourbridge glass industry, now known as &quot;The Glass Quarter&quot;. The glass tradition was brought by Huguenot immigrants to the area. Glass is still produced to this day in albeit much reduced numbers following the deindustrialisation of the area in the 1980s and 1990s which saw the closure of many of the larger companies.

Other important industries included
*Coal and fire clay mining, especially in the north-east of the village;
*Fire brick and house brick manufacturing; (George King Harrison &amp; Co., William King and Co and Pearsons)
*Ironworks, particularly the Stourbridge Ironworks of John Bradley &amp; Co, which included the engineering works of Foster, Rastrick and Company, which made the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot;, the first train to run on American railways and the &quot;Agenoria&quot;, another important early locomotive.
*Davits and ship equipment.
Agriculture continued well into the 20th century. The ancient Manor House of Amblecote Hall went back to Norman times, and had a farm attached to it. The Hall was probably rebuilt, and perhaps relocated, several times over the intervening centuries, the last Hall was lived in by a number of prominent people throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The Gittins family lived there until the Hall was demolished in 1952 due to mining subsidence. The farm disappeared when the whole area to the east of the Western Fault was open cast mined to extract the coal in the mid-1960s.

The parish church of Holy Trinity was begun in 1841, and the church completed in 1842 and consecrated in 1844, being made a separate ecclesiastical parish (a perpetual curacy) in 1845 and then a vicarage in 1868. Amblecote Parish Church of the Holy Trinity is almost unique (as is nearby Quarry Bank Church) because it is constructed completely of yellow fire bricks, made by local brickworks (William King and Co) from the local fire clay which, together with thick coal seams, forms the main strata of Amblecote in the east, whilst the new red sandstone underlies Amblecote to the west of the railway line. Local benefactors, such as the Foster Rasterick Ironworks, supplied the iron railings around the perimeter of the church and Amblecote was one of few to retain these railings following World War II when many churches did not keep them.

Amblecote was the location up until 2007 of the Corbett Hospital, presented to the local people by the local born (at The Delph) businessman John Corbett. He made his fortune from extracting brine to make salt in his works at Stoke Prior near Droitwich, and who became known as the &#x27;Salt King&#x27;. John Corbett visited France extensively in the course of his business, and in Paris he met and wed Anna O&#x27;Meara, daughter of an Irish father and French mother. He purchased the Impney Estate, just outside Droitwich Spa, and built a chateau-styled mansion to try to assuage her home-sickness. &quot;The Chateau Impney&quot; was finished in 1875 and cost £247,000 to build. In 1893 he gave &quot;The Hill&quot; to the local people of Amblecote in perpetuity as a hospital, to augment the dispensary in Stourbridge Town Centre, which still remains on the junction of New Road and Worcester Street, which had been the mainstay of local public health before this time. Corbett Hospital was much extended over the years and catered for all hospital functions, becoming a general hospital. It was allowed to become run down in the mid-1980s, as a new hospital Russells Hall Hospital was built in Dudley to cater for all health-care issues in the Dudley MBC area. The Corbett Hospital was mostly demolished in 2006 and replaced with a new Out-Patients Centre containing a wide range of services and also a new children and family centre.

In 1966, Amblecote Urban District Council (Stourbridge part) was absorbed into the municipal borough of Stourbridge in Worcestershire and the north-eastern part of the Borough, was incorporated within the County Borough of Dudley as part of Brierley Hill. In 1974, Amblecote and the rest of the Stourbridge borough and the former County Borough of Dudley became the Metropolitan District of Dudley under the two tier county of West Midlands and when the West Midlands County Council was abolished in 1986, the Metropolitan District of Dudley became the unitary Metropolitan Borough of Dudley in the metropolitan county of the West Midlands.

==Modern expansion==
Located within Amblecote is the War Memorial Athletic Ground, home of Stourbridge Football Club (nicknamed the Glassboys) and Stourbridge Cricket Club. Amblecote Cricket Club used to play on land off Church Avenue (now Cricketer&#x27;s Green estate), to the rear of the Parish Church, before the land was sold to Hassall Homes for housing in the mid-1980s. Before this, the club used to play on part of &quot;Peters Hill&quot; just down from the Birch Tree Inn,towards Stourbridge , until the early 1980s when it was sold to Tarmac Homes who constructed the &quot;Broomhill Estate.&quot; Amblecote Cricket Club is still in existence and after a period of around 20 years playing at Dudley Kingswinford Rugby Club, their base is now at the Marsh Playing Fields in nearby Kinver. Due to the construction of massive new housing estates, the existing primary school at Amblecote was too small to cope with the influx of new residents. Many residents children on the Stourview estate had to attend schools some distance away, such as Thorns Primary. In 1974, the County Borough of Dudley responded by constructing the new Peters Hill Primary School, which rapidly expanded over time to eventually accommodate some 800 children.

Some of the northern part of Amblecote High Street was demolished in the early 1990s to make way for a major road widening scheme.

These developments, coupled with the nearby Withymoor Village development (classed as part of Brierley Hill), added almost 8,000 new homes between 1964 and 1998 on land formerly used for farming and rehabilitated former coal and fire clay mines, both bell pits and open cast mines, which completely changed the face of the area, and brick works which closed down. Many of the new homes were family dwellings, which saw the rapid expansion especially of Peters Hill Primary School, which more than quadrupled in size from around 200 when opened to over 800 on completion.

The development also changed Amblecote&#x27;s nature as a settlement, from a clearly defined ancient village separated from Quarry Bank and Stourbridge by fields and pit workings etc. to a coalesced settlement, looking more like a suburban development and the development joined Stourbridge and Brierley Hill for the first time ever and Amblecote became the largest electoral ward in Dudley Borough, with a Conservative leaning, under first Dudley West and then Stourbridge Constituencies, until boundary changes in 2004 created Lye and Stourbridge North which took half of Amblecote and reduced the Amblecote ward.

<text>Thomas Lane VC (May 1836 – 12 April 1889) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born in Cork, Ireland, in May 1836, and served throughout the Crimean War in the 47th Regiment of Foot.

==Military service==
On 21 August 1860 at the Taku Forts, China, during the Second China War, Lane, then aged 24 and a private in the 67th (South Hampshire) Regiment of Foot (later The Royal Hampshire Regiment), British Army and a Lieutenant Nathaniel Burslem of his regiment were awarded the Victoria Cross:
He fought in the Anglo-Zulu War as a sergeant with the 3rd Natal Native Contingent. This unit was disbanded at Rorke&#x27;s Drift after the siege, and the officers and non-commissioned officers formed three troops of the Natal Horse. He also fought in Landrey&#x27;s Light Horse in Basutoland in 1881–1882. His VC gratuity was paid from the consulate in Boston, United States, and also in Auckland, New Zealand, during the 1870s.

Lane was one of eight men whose VCs were forfeited. He was stripped of the medal on 7 April 1881 after being convicted of desertion on active service and theft of a &quot;horse, arms and accoutrements&quot;. However, King George V felt that no VC should be forfeited and although the present warrant retains the forfeiture clause, no award have been forfeited since the King&#x27;s 1920 comments. The eight recipients who forfeited their awards have always been included on official War Office lists of VC holders but with a note at the end of the alphabetical list of recipients prior to the First World War stating the names and dates of the warrants that cancelled their awards.

The British Government insisted on the return of his medal from the South African authorities. However, Lane had entrusted his VC to a friend, so the South Africans made a copy and sent that to the War Office. His original medal was found in a pawnshop in 1909. Both are now in the possession of The Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum &amp; Memorial Garden in Winchester, Hampshire, England.

He died in Kimberley, South Africa on 12 April 1889 as a member of the Kimberley Police.

<doc id="1194681" wikidata="Q368770" url="?curid=1194681" title="Belle and Sebastian (Japanese TV series)">
<text>is an anime adaption of the 1965 novel &quot;Belle et Sébastien&quot; by French author Cécile Aubry. The series ran on the Japanese network NHK from April 7, 1981 to March 24, 1982. It consists of 52 episodes and was a co-production of MK Company, Visual 80 Productions and Toho Company, Ltd.

Toshiyuki Kashiwakura was the head writer and character designs were by Shuichi Seki. The show was broadcast on French and Japanese television in 1981, with American cable network Nickelodeon picking it up in 1984. In the United Kingdom, it aired on Children&#x27;s BBC in 1989 and 1990.

This anime used many staffers from Nippon Animation&#x27;s &quot;World Masterpiece Theater&quot; franchise, thus the look and feel is similar to that of a &quot;WMT&quot; production even though Nippon Animation itself was not involved with this series.

The series has been aired in many countries outside Japan and has been dubbed and subtitled in English and numerous other languages. The English-language script was written by Eileen Opatut, and the series was dubbed into English by Synchro-Quebec in Montreal.

==Plot==
The series is about the mountain-based adventures of a young boy named Sebastian and his Pyrenean mountain dog, Belle, who live in a small village in Southern France. He has no friends because he is bullied by the other children for not having a mother. But one day, he meets a gentle white dog who has been falsely accused of attacking people. He names her Belle and they become the best of friends. To save her from being put down, he leaves his adoptive family and flees to Spain with her and his little dog, Poochie. They have many adventures as they elude the police and search for his long-lost mother.

==Characters==
; Sebastian
: Sebastian is a 9-year-old boy from a French village near the mountains. Although his age is never explicitly given, the repeated references to &#x27;the events 9 years ago&#x27; throughout the series point to it. His name was chosen because he was born on St. Sebastian&#x27;s Day. Since he was born, he has been living with his adoptive grandfather, Cecil, and Anne-Marie who is Cecil&#x27;s real granddaughter. He is good-natured and energetic, but the children in town tease him because he doesn&#x27;t have a real mother. Sebastian&#x27;s deepest desires are to find his mother and to have a good friend.

; Belle
: Belle (&quot;Jolie&quot; in the Japanese version) is a large white Great Pyrenees who escaped into the French countryside. She is gentle and warmhearted, but her attempts to help those in need are misunderstood. She is labeled &quot;The White Monster&quot; and the police are constantly on her tail.

; Poochie
: Poochie is a little puppy who rides around in Sebastian&#x27;s pocket. Although Poochie is always yapping and getting into mischief, he is a good friend to Sebastian and Belle.

; Cecil
: Cecil took Sebastian in as a baby and acts as his adoptive grandfather. He is a loving mentor who teaches him all he knows about the mountains and the wilderness.

; Anne-Marie
: Anne-Marie is Cecil&#x27;s biological granddaughter. She has helped care for Sebastian since he was born, and fancies herself as his mother despite being the age of an older sister at best. She loves him deeply, but is often overprotective and a little harsh.

; Paul
: Paul is Anne-Marie&#x27;s older brother. He&#x27;s a soldier in the mountain army.

; Isabel
: Isabel is Sebastian&#x27;s real mother, a traveling Romani. She went against the gypsy code and married an outsider, but he died before Sebastian was born. She had him secretly in the mountains, and promised to come back for him one day when her people were able to understand.

; Sarah
: Sarah is a sick, lonely little girl living in Spain who Sebastian meets on his journey. Both long for friends their own age to play with, so they quickly become close. During the series she celebrates her 9th birthday. Her father is a very rich man who gives her everything she can possibly desire, yet the only thing that can make Sarah happy is to have a truly good friend. She reappears several times during his journey to lend a helping hand. Towards the end of the series Sarah is celebrating her 9th birthday, meaning that she is perhaps only a month older than Sebastian himself. During the course of the series, a romantic bond forms between Sebastian and Sarah, and it is strongly implied that the two of them married when they grew up and lived happily ever after, with Belle still at their side.

; Doctor Alexander Phillips (Original: Dr. Guillaume)
: Dr. Phillips is a local doctor in the village where Sebastian lives, he&#x27;s also Anne-Marie&#x27;s boyfriend.

; Mister Albert
: Mr. Albert is Sarah&#x27;s father, a rich man, well respected in the community, and doesn&#x27;t like dogs. He slowly becomes fond of Belle and Poochie after they help Sarah to get well with her sickness. His love for his daughter ensures his willingness to aid the fugitives, if only for her sake. He is in fact a long term fan and admirer of Isabel, admitting to her that he was the man who sent her red roses in Barcelona; it is implied that a romantic attachment meant is growing between the couple and that their respective children approve.

; Robert and Maria
: Robert and Maria are servants at the home of Mr. Albert. Robert is the butler and sometimes chauffeur, while Maria is the housekeeper. They appear to be fond of each other but refuse to admit it, not even to themselves.

; The Carlos Company
: The Carlos Company is a band of gypsies whom Sebastian&#x27;s mother, Isabel, is traveling with. Isabel is, in fact, their star performer because of her beauty and wonderful singing voice. She also makes and repairs the company&#x27;s costumes, a skill she uses to good effect when she makes Anne-Marie a wedding dress.

; Hernandez and Fernandez
: Hernandez and Fernandez are a reoccurring duo of crooks that are trying to capture Belle for a quick rise to fame, fortune, and popularity.

; Oscar and Johnny
: Oscar is a traveling performer that uses his feats of strength by breaking chains wrapped around his body. Johnny is Oscar&#x27;s son and also is a performer, but not in strength. His ability is that of balance and agility. They used to be members of the Carlos company and Oscar still holds a candle for Isabel in his heart, as well as a photo of her in his trunk, which he shows to Sebastian. He refuses to give it at first, as it is a prized possession.

; Inspector Garcia
: Inspector Garcia is an officer of the Spanish Police and is always hot on the trail of Belle and Sebastian. He is heavy-set and has a thin mustache.

; Officer Martin
: Officer Martin is the Inspector&#x27;s assistant and a very clumsy man.

; Commander Costello
: Costello is the head of the Spanish Border Guards and has a strong resemblance to Fidel Castro.

<text>William Job Maillard, VC (10 March 1863 – 10 September 1903) was a British surgeon, officer in the Royal Navy, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. In addition, he was &quot;the first and only naval medical officer to win the VC&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Born in the village of Banwell, Somerset, Maillard was educated at Kingswood School in Bath, Dunheved College in Launceston and Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London, from 1882 to 1889, when he won the gold medal. He joined the Royal Navy in 1889, first serving in . Maillard was 35 years old, and a surgeon in the Royal Navy during the 1898 Occupation of Crete when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 6 September 1898 at Candia, Crete, Greece, two parties of men from went to the assistance of the Customs House Garrison, which was being besieged. Later, when medical help was called for, Surgeon Maillard, who had disembarked and reached a place of safety, went back through a deluge of bullets in an attempt to rescue one of the seamen who was wounded and had fallen back into the boat. He was, however, almost dead and it was impossible for the surgeon to lift him, as the boat was drifting. He returned to his post unhurt, but his clothes were riddled with bullets.

Maillard was the first and only naval medical officer to win the VC. He later achieved the rank of staff surgeon, and retired from the navy on 7 April 1902.

Maillard&#x27;s medal is displayed in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1194689" wikidata="Q4742911" url="?curid=1194689" title="American Academy of Religion">
<text>The American Academy of Religion (AAR) is the world&#x27;s largest association of scholars in the field of religious studies and related topics. It is a nonprofit member association, 
serving as a professional and learned society for scholars involved in the academic study of religion. It has some 10,000 members worldwide, with the largest concentration being in the United States and Canada. AAR members are university and college professors, independent scholars, secondary teachers, clergy, seminarians, students, and interested lay-people.

== History ==

AAR was founded in 1909 as the Association of Biblical Instructors in American Colleges and Secondary Schools. The name was changed to National Association of Biblical Instructors (NABI) in 1933. The American Academy of Religion was adopted as the organization name in 1963 to reflect its broader, inclusive mission to foster the academic study of all religions. Over its long history, AAR has broadened its scope to reflect contemporary values of its membership, such as responding to feminist scholarship and women in religion, increased attention to religions beyond Christianity, differentiation between theology and/or religious reflection within the academic study of religion as a cultural/historical/political phenomenon, and engagement with the public understanding of religion. Stausberg suggested that &quot;Probably because of its more encompassing and open policy and its strategy to position itself as the default home for Religious Studies in the United States, the AAR has been a success story.&quot; 
Presidents of the AAR have included well-known scholars such as Judith Plaskow, Mark Juergensmeyer, Wendy Doniger, Emilie Townes, Peter J. Paris, Rebecca Chopp, Elizabeth A. Clark and Ann Taves.

== Publications ==

Oxford University Press publishes &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Religion&quot; on behalf of the AAR. &quot;Religious Studies News&quot; is the quarterly newspaper of record for the organization; it transitioned from a print to online-only publication in 2010. AAR also publishes &quot;Reading Religion&quot;, an online publication featuring book reviews by scholars in religious studies and other related fields. AAR publishes five book series through Oxford University Press: Academy; Reflection and Theory in the Study of Religion; Religion, Culture, and Theory; Religion in Translation; and Teaching Religious Studies. AAR presents awards each year to notable books in the study of religion. It offers three categories of Awards for Excellence: Analytical-Descriptive Studies, Historical Studies, and Constructive-Reflective Studies.

== Annual meeting ==

AAR hosts an annual meeting each year in November. The AAR annual meeting is the world&#x27;s largest meeting for religious studies scholars. Over 400 events, including meetings, receptions, and academic sessions, occur on the AAR program alone; hundreds more, hosted by affiliated societies and institutions, occur over the course of the meeting. The location of the meeting changes each year. The annual meetings of the AAR are attended by about half their membership &quot;(some 4,500 in 2014), which make these meetings by far the most important social arena for academic interaction&quot; in comparison with meetings of other North American academic societies for the study of religion. The AAR annual meeting program is developed entirely by volunteers involved in program units representing disciplines and sub-disciplines within the field.

== Other activities ==

AAR offers activities on a regional level for its members. Professional development resources such as research grants, career services, and scholarships are some of the member benefits. AAR also advocates the importance of the critical study of religion on institutional and national levels.

== Presidents ==
The president is part of the board of directors, which is elected by AAR members each September and takes up their post at the close of each annual meeting.

<text>Major-General William McBean (1 January 1819 – 22 June 1878) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

He was born in Inverness on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1 January 1819, the son of John McBean (McBain), a shoemaker in Inverness, and his wife Ann Gordon. The year of his birth is found cited as 1818 and 1819, and his date of death is found cited as 22 June and 23 June 1878. The correct dates appear to be those recorded on inscriptions on his parents&#x27; gravestone in Inverness&#x27;s old Chapel Yard and on the plinth supporting a bust of General McBean, donated by his brother&#x27;s family, which is inside Inverness Town House. The inscription on the former states that he &quot;died at Woolwich 22 June 1878&quot;, and the inscription on the latter states he was &quot;Born at Inverness January 1819. Died at Woolwich 22nd June 1878&quot;. His father has been said to have been a ploughman, but General McBean&#x27;s baptism record, and his parents&#x27; gravestone, placed there by him and his brother, confirms his father was a shoemaker. It is still possible that his father could have been a ploughman at some other point in his life, but there appears to be no evidence on this point.

Around 1835 he enlisted as a private in the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders. He rose through the ranks and received a commission on 10 August 1854, at the rank of Ensign, being promoted to Lieutenant by December. In December 1854 he sailed to the Crimea and took part in the Siege of Sebastopol and the assaults on Redan on 18 June and 8 September 1855. He received the Crimean Medal with clasp, and the Turkish Crimea Medal.

Serving in the Indian Mutiny over and above his actions at Lucknow, he was present at the defeat of the Gwalior Contingent at Cawnpore, the affair at Kalee Nuddee, the affair of Alligunge, and Battle of Bareilly and the evacuation of the fort at Mithowli.

==The Victoria Cross==
He was 39 years old, and a lieutenant in the 93rd Regiment of Foot (later Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders - Princess Louise&#x27;s), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place at Lucknow, India for which he was awarded the VC.

He personally killed 11 people in hand-to-hand combat during the attack. Afterwards he casually stated &quot;it only took me twenty minutes&quot;. He was promoted to Captain a few months later on 16 August 1858. Queen Victoria agreed the award on 24 December and he received the Victoria Cross on the parade ground at Umbeyla from Major General Robert Garrett on 6 February 1859.

==Further information==

He held every rank from private to major general, and never left the 93rd Regiment, including becoming the Commanding Officer (Colonel in Chief) of the 93rd Regimnent on 29 October 1873 in place of Colonel Burroughs CB.

He died at Shooter&#x27;s Hill in London on 22 June 1878 but was buried with his wife, Victoria Beveridge (d.1871) and infant son, Henry Gordon Victor McBean, in Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh. His wife died a few days after giving birth and the son died a few weeks after. The grave lies to the east side of the eastern path, just south of its midpoint.

==The medal==

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Museum in Stirling Castle, Scotland.

<doc id="1194692" wikidata="Q538805" url="?curid=1194692" title="Quintus Lollius Urbicus">
<text>Quintus Lollius Urbicus was a Berber governor of Roman Britain between the years 139 and 142, during the reign of the Emperor Antoninus Pius. He is named in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, although it is not entirely historical, and his name appears on five Roman inscriptions from Britain; his career is set out in detail on a pair of inscriptions set up in his native Tiddis near Cirta (Constantine, Algeria), Numidia.

== Early life ==
Lollius Urbicus was the son of Marcus Lollius Senecio, who was a Berber landowner, and his wife Grania Honorata. Professor Edward Champlin included Adventus as a member of &quot;a Cirtan community at Rome&quot; he infers existed there, whose members included: Publius Pactumeius Clemens, consul in 138; Gaius Arrius Antoninus, consul c. 170; and the orator Marcus Cornelius Fronto. Champlin notes that Urbicus, along with Pactumeius Clemens, would later be useful patrons for Fronto at the beginning of the orator&#x27;s career.

== Early career ==
The early senatorial career of Lollius Urbicus is known from a detailed inscription erected in Tiddis. After a military tribunate with the Legio XXII Primigenia at Mogontiacum (present-day Mainz), he entered the Senate and served for a year as legate to the proconsul of Asia. He quickly rose to prominence as emperor Hadrian&#x27;s candidate, and received a commission as legatus or commander of the Legio X Gemina at Vienna. He received &quot;dona militaria&quot;, or military decorations, for his service as a legate during Hadrian&#x27;s Jewish War of 132–135. His consulship can be placed in 135 or 136, after which he governed Germania Inferior. He was transferred to Britannia soon after Hadrian&#x27;s death.

== Governor of Britain ==
According to the Augustan History, the emperor Antoninus Pius &quot;defeated the Britons through the agency of the legate Lollius Urbicus&quot;. It seems that, in a reversal of Hadrianic policy in Britain, he sent Lollius Urbicus to effect the reconquest of Lowland Scotland. Between 139 and 140 Urbicus refurbished the fort at Corbridge, in preparation for the move north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and commemorative coins were issued in 142 celebrating a victory in Britain. It is therefore likely that Urbicus led the reoccupation of southern Scotland in 141 including the capture of Burnswark Hill, using all three legions and a variety of auxiliary units. In 143 he oversaw the initial construction of the Antonine Wall; he is explicitly named on building inscriptions from Balmuildy.

No historical source describes the Antonine invasion, so any attempted reconstruction will be purely speculative. Urbicus may have campaigned against several British tribes (possibly including factions of the northern Brigantes), certainly against the lowland tribes of Scotland; the Votadini and the Selgovae of the Scottish Borders region, also the Damnonii of Strathclyde and the Novantae of Dumfries and Galloway. All three of the legions of Britain would have taken part (Legio II Augusta based at Caerleon, the Sixth Victrix based at York and the Twentieth Valeria Victrix based at Chester), as they are all mentioned on the inscriptions recording building work undertaken along the Antonine Wall. This legionary core was, no doubt, backed up by a substantial contingent of auxiliary units, of which we have record of around nine regiments (e.g. RIB 1276, 2140, 2142, 2149, 2155, 3509).

It seems likely that Urbicus planned his campaign of attack from Corbridge in Northumberland, just to the rear of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, as dedicatory inscriptions positively dated to the early 140s have been uncovered at the Antonine storage-depot there. From here he drove north-north-west into the Scottish Borders along the Agricolan military road Dere Street, leaving garrison forts at High Rochester in Northumberland and possibly also at Newstead in the Borders, as he struck towards the Firth of Forth. Both of these sites, as well as similar military installations at Risingham, Chew Green, Cappuck and Inveresk, were very likely used as bases from which to police the lowland tribes, namely the Votadini to the east and the Selgovae to the west.

Having secured an overland supply route for military personnel and equipment along Dere Street, Urbicus very likely set up a supply port at Carriden for the supply of grain and other foodstuffs before proceeding against the Dumnonii tribe in South Strathclyde. This done, then came the task of completing a new barrier of turf and timber stretching for thirty-five miles from east to west across the narrow neck of land separating the mighty Rivers Forth and Clyde, nowadays known as the Antonine Wall.

==Later career==
Urbicus returned to Rome with the prospect of the prestigious post of &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; (Prefect of Rome), which he probably held in AD 146, after the death of the incumbent, Sextus Erucius Clarus. He was perhaps the &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; who is known to have died in AD 160.

One recorded activity of Urbicus while &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; was his presiding at the trial of one Ptolemaeus, who had been accused by her ex-husband of being a Christian; she admitted to the prefect that she was indeed a Christian and was sentenced to death. This trial led Justin Martyr, who had converted her, to write his &quot;Apology&quot; to plead for her life.

Citing Urbicus&#x27; career inscription, Colin Wells concludes that: &quot;At no other period of history could the second or third son of a Berber landowner from a very small town in the interior enjoy a career which took him to Asia, Judaea, the Danube . . . the lower Rhine and Great Britain, culminating in a position of great power and honor in the capital of the empire to which all these regions belonged.&quot;

<text>Michael Murphy VC (c. 1837, Cahir, County Tipperary, Ireland – 4 April 1893, Darlington, County Durham, England) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and other Commonwealth forces.

Murphy was born in Cahir, County Tipperary, to Michael Murphy, a local blacksmith, and his (unknown) wife. He had at least two younger sisters, named Mary and Julia Mary. Little is known about his early life until 1855, when he started his army career.

==Army career==

===Early career===
On 27 August 1855, Murphy enlisted in the 17th Lancers at Cork. The 17th Lancers, however, were still at the Crimean War, having lost most of their complement in the Charge of the Light Brigade in the previous year. As a result, Murphy started his training with the 16th Lancers at the Portobello Barracks, Dublin.

On 22 May 1856, Murphy attached to the 17th Lancers, who were now en route from the Crimea, via Ismid in Turkey, to help contain the early stages of the Indian Mutiny. It seems he intended to catch up with his regiment in India. Something must have affected this plan, since on 18 October 1856, he joined the 2nd Battalion Military Train (later the Royal Army Service Corps and nowadays the Royal Logistic Corps) instead. In March 1857, Murphy left the Curragh Camp and boarded the steamer &quot;Calypso&quot; at Dublin bound for Woolwich. On 28 April, he embarked for Hong Kong. On reaching the Dutch East Indies, the battalion was diverted to Calcutta on news of the Indian Mutiny. They arrived in Calcutta on 27 August, and after a series of moves were deployed to relieve Lucknow. The battalion was subsumed into the Azimghur Field Force on 29 March 1858.

===Victoria Cross===

On 15 April 1858, Murphy was in position at Nathupur, near Azimgurh, in north-east India. During the fighting, Murphy and Private Samuel Morley were severely wounded while defending an injured comrade, Lieutenant Hamilton, adjutant of the 3rd Sikh Cavalry. Hamilton died from his injuries the next evening, but for his actions Murphy was awarded the Victoria Cross:

Queen Victoria presented Michael Murphy with his Victoria Cross at the Quadrangle, Windsor Castle on 4 January 1860. Recognition for Morley did not come until later.

===Return to the UK===
After his injuries at Nathupur, Murphy was invalided to Calcutta and returned to the United Kingdom and the Invalid Depot, Great Yarmouth. On 14 May 1859, he resumed his duties at the Depot, at Aldershot and returned to the 2nd Battalion on 1 October 1859. On 7 April 1860, he married at Aldershot and his new wife and two children joined him in establishment accommodation the same day. Murphy was soon promoted to Farrier Sergeant, and moved to Woolwich. In January 1862, Murphy was attached to the 1st Battalion and served 5 months in Canada, returning on 14 June 1862 to Woolwich and then onto Aldershot. On 21 March 1865, Murphy transferred to the 6th Battalion and moved to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. On 6 September of the following year, Murphy rejoined the Military Train at the Curragh in Ireland. By 1868, he was back at Woolwich with his wife and two children. By the time the Military Train became the Army Service Corps in 1869, Murphy had achieved the rank of Farrier-Major and was stationed in Aldershot. On 1 July 1871, Murphy transferred from the Army Service Corps to the 7th Hussars.

===Forfeiture===
On 26 January 1872, a civilian, James Green, was stopped by Farrier-Major Knott at Aldershot with a wagon containing sacks of oats and hay. Green stated that Murphy had given him permission to remove these goods. Murphy and Green were then arrested for the theft of these goods. At the trial at Winchester, Green was acquitted and released, but Murphy was convicted and sentenced to nine months&#x27; hard labour at the House of Correction for the county of Hampshire. On 5 March, an order was issued for the forfeit of Murphy&#x27;s VC. Murphy was one of only eight men who forfeited their Victoria Crosses. Although Murphy had worn his Victoria Cross every day during his trial, the medal could not be found after the forfeiture order. His wife Mary and their child had disappeared from their Army establishment accommodation. After Murphy was released from prison on 30 November 1872, he returned to his regiment at Hounslow. His wife and children returned to Army establishment in December 1873.

His medal re-appeared 26 years later.

===Later career and discharge===
During 1873, Murphy&#x27;s battalion moved to Wimbledon and then Maidstone. Murphy was in hospital and did not move with his battalion when it moved to Norwich in June 1874. On 7 December 1874, Murphy was transferred to the 9th Lancers. In January 1875, the 9th Lancers were sent to Bombay, but Murphy reattached to the 5th Lancers returning from India.

On 1 February 1875, after almost 20 years army service, Murphy was discharged at Colchester.

==Post-military life and death==
Immediately following his army discharge, Murphy took up residence in Bellingham, Northumberland. From Bellingham, he moved by early 1876 to become a blacksmith at Scotswood, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland. then by mid-1878 to Murton, County Durham, and, by 1881, back to Heworth, Northumberland.

During the 1880s, Murphy&#x27;s children appear to have left home. In 1889, while staying at Wilton Lodge, Darlington, Murphy&#x27;s wife was admitted to Winterton Asylum, Sedgefield, where she later died on 3 March 1900. By 1891, Murphy had moved on his own to a cottage on the Blackwell Grange estate, outside Darlington (owned by a benefactor, Sir Henry Havelock-Allan, another Victoria Cross recipient). Murphy later relocated to Darlington to work as a labourer in an ironworks.

Murphy died of pneumonia at 22 Vulcan Street, Darlington on 4 April 1893. He was buried in the North Road Municipal Cemetery, Darlington. A gravestone was erected by Sir Henry and comrades from the India campaign. Despite having at least two children still alive but not at home, his sole heir was stated to be his married niece Bridget Mary Anne Dobson, who was caring for, and residing with, him at the end. Murphy&#x27;s epitaph 
records that three of his sons were killed in action.

===Reappearance of medal===
It is not known where the medal was kept between March 1872 and June 1898, nor who held possession. However, five years after Murphy&#x27;s death, in June 1898, his Victoria Cross medal eventually resurfaced when it was offered by an anonymous seller at auction. It was bought by Master Sergeant Masterman on behalf of the Army Service Corps, at Aldershot. This medal was presented to the RASC, which has since been subsumed into the Royal Logistic Corps, based at the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, Surrey. Murphy&#x27;s actual medal is now owned by a regimental trust and can be viewed, but only by prior arrangement with the Royal Logistic Corps Museum.

===Commemoration===

The 150th anniversary of Murphy&#x27;s VC occurred on 15 April 2008, and was commemorated at his grave in Darlington by the RLC, with the Mayor of Darlington, numerous family members and the British Legion present.
==Family==
Murphy married Mary Fox (c. 1841, Ireland – 9 March 1900) at the Farnham Register Office, nr Aldershot, on 7 April 1860. One or both of them may have had previous children, or may have been caring for family or army children, since the army records state that they went onto army establishment the very same day with two children or stepchildren, aged 1 and 5.

Subsequently, they had at least three children together:
# Edward John Murphy (b. 10 January 1864, Aldershot Camp – alive at 1881 census – d. unknown)
# George Frederick William Murphy (15 December 1875, Scotswood, Northumberland – 1954, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire)
# Mary Ann Murphy (15 May 1878, Murton Colliery, County Durham – alive at 1911 census – d. unknown)

These three children—and no others—appear in the civilian records (BMD, census, etc.). Despite this, Murphy&#x27;s epitaph stated that &quot;Three of his sons died or were killed in Her Majesty&#x27;s service&quot; before 1893. It is known that his son George died in 1954, and that Mary Ann and her family survived into the 20th century, so his son Edward John Murphy and two further stepsons must have died before 1893. The army records suggest that these deaths may have been:
* James Ballard, an alleged stepson of Murphy and a colour-sergeant of the 1st Battalion 24th Regiment of Foot who was killed at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879
* A sergeant of artillery who was killed at Tel-el-Kebir on 13 September 1882
* A corporal of the Durham Light Infantry who died on the Nile in 1885.

The exact identity and fate of all his children are not known; nor is the connection to his niece Bridget Dobson.

<text>Danko Jones is a Canadian hard rock trio from Toronto. The band consists of Danko Jones (vocals/guitar), John &quot;JC&quot; Calabrese (bass), and Rich Knox (drums). The band&#x27;s music includes elements of hard rock and punk. 

==History==
=== Formation and early years ===

Formed in 1996 by namesake Danko Jones, Scaltro (John Calabrese) and Gran Sfigato (Michael Caricari). Danko Jones played consistently for two years after formation in and around the northeastern United States and Canada, opening for The New Bomb Turks, Nashville Pussy, Blonde Redhead, The Make-Up, The Dirtbombs, The Chrome Cranks and The Demolition Doll Rods. Originally they did not intend to release an album, preferring to have the band&#x27;s live reputation spread by word of mouth.

Eventually, the trio relented and put out a self-titled six-song EP on Sonic Unyon records in 1998. In 1999 the band performed around Toronto, including at Lee&#x27;s Palace and the Horseshoe Tavern. That year they released the self-produced &quot;My Love Is Bold&quot; E.P. and release the single &quot;Bounce&quot;. They were nominated for a Juno Award in 2000 for Best Alternative Album.

In early 2000 Danko Jones opened for Beck at Maple Leaf Gardens. In 2001 Bad Taste Records released a compilation of the band&#x27;s early recordings, demos, and b-sides entitled, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive and On Fire&quot;. A five-week European tour followed to promote the release including shows at the Roskilde festival in Denmark and Hultsfred festival in Sweden. By the end of the year they had returned twice more, once as main support for the Backyard Babies.
In 2002 they released their first full-length album, &quot;Born a Lion&quot;, produced by Bill Bell, on Bad Taste Records in Europe and on Universal in Canada. The band did several European tours and two Canadian tours to promote the record including a repeat performance at Roskilde and a return to Hultsfred as well as stops to Pukkelpop in Belgium and The Lowlands festival in the Netherlands. They also performed the opening slot with The Rolling Stones on their &quot;40 Licks&quot; World tour kick-off show at the Palais Royale in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on August 16, 2002.

2003 saw the release of &quot;We Sweat Blood&quot;, produced by Matt DeMatteo, and the group taking a heavier approach to their hard-rock sound. More touring followed that included Europe and Japan. They were also nominated for two Junos: Best Rock Album (&quot;Born a Lion&quot;) and Best video (&quot;Lovercall&quot;). While success was happening abroad, home relations with Universal Canada had soured and the band was dropped mid-album run. Explanations from the label were vague, but the separation happened after Jones&#x27; February 2004 appearance on CBC Sunday where Jones appeared as a pro-downloader opposite then CRIA president, Brian Robertson. In spite of being dropped from Universal Canada, the group continued to tour heavily for the rest of the year well into 2004 with Turbonegro, Sepultura and The Bronx. While touring they received another Juno nomination for Best Rock Album (&quot;We Sweat Blood&quot;) and tour Australia as well as more European dates including Rock Am Ring and Rock Im Park in Germany and Download, Leeds and Reading in England.

=== Mid-2000s ===
Early 2005 recording sessions for the follow-up to &quot;We Sweat Blood&quot; were interspersed with a series of tours amidst recording that brought the band to the Netherlands, Germany and South Africa-promoted by their record label and events company ASP Records, who released a collectors double set featuring Born A Lion and We Sweat Blood. In April, American label, Razor &amp; Tie released &quot;We Sweat Blood&quot; and the band set out to America in support as well. Working two releases simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic proved time-consuming, and the worldwide release for the upcoming album, &quot;Sleep Is The Enemy&quot;, produced by Matt DeMatteo, was pushed back to 2006.

 In 2005, Danko Jones signed to Aquarius Records. During the summer and fall of 2005, the band toured America heavily with two of &quot;We Sweat Blood&quot;″s singles being played regularly on rock radio in America (&quot;Lovercall&quot; and &quot;Forget My Name&quot;). Stateside tours with Flogging Molly, Our Lady Peace, The Supersuckers, and The (International) Noise Conspiracy followed. Prior to the release of &quot;Sleep Is The Enemy&quot; drummer Damon Richardson left the band, citing fatigue. He was replaced by Dan Cornelius.

In January and February 2006, the band set out to do their first Canadian tour in almost four years, opening for Nickelback. With the release of &quot;Sleep Is the Enemy&quot; came more touring including America and a headlining European club tour with support from Brant Bjork &amp; The Bros.

Their fourth album, &quot;Never Too Loud&quot; was released on February 27, 2008 and produced by Nick Raskulinecz. The album yielded three singles, the international hit, &quot;Code Of The Road&quot;, followed by &quot;Take Me Home&quot; and &quot;King Of Magazines&quot;. A city tour of Europe in April 2008 was followed by a Canadian tour in May and a three-month stint in Europe playing about 30 dates on the festival circuit that included Rock Am Ring, Rock Im Park and With Full Force in Germany; Bospop and Lowlands in The Netherlands; Sziget Festival in Hungary; Rabarock in Estonia; Provinssi Rock in Finland; and Eurockeennes and Hellfest in France, where Jones sang on stage with Death Angel for the song, &quot;Bored&quot;. They opened for Motörhead in England, Germany, France and Benelux in late 2008.

On February 3, 2009 B-Sides was released in Europe only—a collection of previously released B-sides from European singles and unreleased tracks that spanned 1996 to 2008. On February 24 they set out on a seven-week tour in support of the release that spanned The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, France and the UK with support coming from The Backyard Babies, Winnebego Deal and The Black Spiders. The CD yielded the singles &quot;Sugar High&quot; and &quot;My Problems (Are Your Problems Now)&quot;. A greatest hits compilation titled &quot;This Is Danko Jones&quot; was released on April 7 the same year in Canada only.

In the summer the band made a few festival appearances, including the Sziget Festival in Hungary on the main stage with Faith No More and The Offspring, as well as Huntenpop in The Netherlands, Winterthur and Gampel Open Air in Switzerland, Parken Festival in Norway and Jurassic Rock in Finland. In January and February 2010 the band toured across Canada with Guns N&#x27; Roses and Sebastian Bach. In March the same year they toured the United States with Clutch.

=== 2010s ===
Their fifth album, &quot;Below the Belt&quot;, was released on May 11, 2010 and produced by Matt DeMatteo. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Full of Regret&quot;, features Elijah Wood, Lemmy Kilmister, Selma Blair and Mike Watt in the accompanying video, the first in &#x27;The Ballad of Danko Jones&#x27; video trilogy. It debuted at No. 36 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks in November. It is also featured on EA&#x27;s &quot;NHL 11&quot; soundtrack. The second single, &quot;Had Enough&quot;, has Ralph Macchio appearing in the accompanying video while &quot;I Think Bad Thoughts&quot; features Wood, Macchio, Jena Malone and Watt in the final instalment of the music video trilogy.

In June 2011 drummer Dan Cornelius left the band and was replaced by Atom Willard. A 90-minute documentary about the band, &quot;Bring on the Mountain&quot;, was released in June 2012. The two-disc DVD also included a short film based on the band&#x27;s latest three videos, all their music videos and several live clips. An oral history book about the band, &quot;Too Much Trouble: A Very Oral History of Danko Jones&quot;, was to be released by ECW Press in October 2012. &quot;Rock and Roll Is Black and Blue&quot; was released on September 21, 2012 in Europe and October 9 in North America. They went on a 2013 Spring tour with Volbeat and Spoken.

&quot;Fire Music&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album to include drummer Rich Knox, was released on February 10, 2015 in Canada. In July 2015, the band announced a nine-date tour of the UK and Ireland scheduled for September, with support from the Amorettes. More touring followed, including a tour of summer festivals.

Danko Jones&#x27; eighth album, &quot;Wild Cat&quot;, was released on March 3, 2017. The band also went on a 17-date European tour to accompany the release of the album. 2017 saw four more tours: a spring Canadian tour, the usual summer festival tour, an autumn Canadian tour and a winter Nordic tour. Danko Jones supported Skindred on their April UK tour, alongside CKY. The band performed in Luxembourg in May that year. &quot;We&#x27;re Crazy&quot; was released on September 21, 2018, although it had been played live since April. &quot;A Rock Supreme&quot;, their ninth studio album, was released on April 26, 2019. A European summer festival tour with Volbeat and Baroness followed.

=== 2020s ===

In March 2021 the band released &quot;I Want Out&quot;, the first single and video from their tenth album, &quot;Power Trio&quot;, which was released in August 2021. The album was recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic. With this album the band performed at many festivals and tours between 2021 and 2022. 

The album &quot;Electric Sounds&quot; was released in September 2023. 

This was followed by the &quot;Shake your City&quot; Tour in Europe in November/December 2023 and the &quot;Guess who&#x27;s back?&quot; tour in March 2024 in Scandinavia. They played at festivals in the summer. The &quot;Good Times&quot; tour was set in October 2024. They played in Spain, Portugal, Germany and Austria.

<text>Thomas Murphy VC true name Thomas Cosgrove (1832 – 22 March 1900) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

The Cross was awarded not for bravery in action against the enemy, but for bravery at sea in saving life in a storm off Andaman Islands. Born in Dublin, he was about 28 years old and a private in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Andaman Islands Expedition when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 7 May 1867 at the island of Little Andaman, eastern India, in the Bay of Bengal, Private Murphy was one of a party of five (David Bell, James Cooper, Campbell Mellis Douglas and William Griffiths) of the 2/24th Regiment, who risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through dangerous surf to rescue some of their comrades who had been sent to the island to find out the fate of the commander and seven of the crew, who had landed from the ship &quot;Assam Valley &quot; and were feared murdered by the cannibalistic islanders.

The citation was gazetted on 17 December 1867:

THE Queen has been graciously pleased to signify Her intention to confer the decoration of the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned Officer and Private Soldiers of Her Majesty&#x27;s Army, whose claims to the same have been submitted for Her Majesty&#x27;s approval, for their gallant conduct at the Little Andaman Island, as recorded against their names, viz. :—

2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment: Assistant-Surgeon Campbell Millis Douglas, M.D, Private Thomas Murphy, Private James Cooper, Private David Bell, Private William Griffiths.

For the very gallant and daring manner in which, on the 7th of May, 1867, they risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through a dangerous surf to the rescue of some of their comrades, who formed part of an expedition which had been sent to the Island of Little Andaman, by order of the Chief Commissioner of British Burmah, with the view of ascertaining the fate of the Commander and seven of the crew of the ship &quot; Assam Valley,&quot; who had landed there, and were supposed to have been murdered by the
natives.

The officer who commanded the troops on the occasion reports : About an hour later in the day Dr. Douglas, 2nd Battalion, 24th
.&quot;Regiment, and the four Privates referred&quot; to, gallantly manning the second gig, made their way through the surf almost to the shore, but finding their boat was half filled with water, they retired. A second attempt made by Dr. Douglas and party proved successful, five of us being safely passed through the surf to the boats outside. A third and last trip got the whole of the party left on shore safe to the boats. It is stated that Dr. Douglas accomplished these trips through the surf to the shore by no ordinary exertion. He stood in the bows of the boat, and worked her in an intrepid and seamanlike manner, cool to a degree, as
if what he was then doing was an ordinary act of every-day life. The four Privates behaved in an equally cool and collected manner, rowing through the roughest surf when the slightest hesitation or want of pluck on the part of any one of them would have been
attended by the gravest results. It is reported that seventeen officers and men were thus saved from what must otherwise have been a fearful risk, if not certainty of death.
==Later life, death and burial==
Thomas Murphy VC was long thought to have died in Philadelphia, PA and was buried in either Holy Cross Cemetery (Yeadon, Pennsylvania) or Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, PA. Research by US Medal of Honor researcher Karl Jensen and Canada Victoria Cross researcher William Mullen has proven that these two burial locations are incorrect. Documents below support the correct death place, burial location and true name of Thomas Murphy VC.

Thomas Murphy VC, whose true name was Thomas Cosgrove, emigrated to the United States after his military service. He had used his mother’s maiden name of Murphy as an alias. He lived in Pittston, Pennsylvania and had work as a coal miner. He married on 1 Feb 1886 a widow Catherine (nee Lynch) Dougherty in Pittston, PA. Catherine’s first husband James Dougherty had died in a mining accident on 22 May 1882. James and Catherine had four children Patrick, Michael, Anna and Catherine. Thomas Cosgrove, Catherine and the four now step children all resided at 133 John St. in Pittston, Pennsylvania next to the Market Street Cemetery, which is now known as St. John the Evangelist Cemetery. Cosgrove died 22 Mar 1900 at Pittston, Pennsylvania and was buried in St. John the Evangelist Cemetery. His exact burial location is not known due to a fire had destroyed cemetery burial records pre-1936. He is perhaps buried with his widow Catherine, who died in 1927, in a Dougherty family plot in Old Section 4, Avenue 46 or nearby.

Thomas Cosgrove’s obituary in the 23 Mar 1900 Wilkes-Barre, PA Daily News newspaper front page read:
WORE VICTORIA CROSS. - HE WON IT BY HIS BRAVERY - DIED AT PITTSTON.
Thomas Cosgrove died at 3 o&#x27;clock yesterday morning at his home on Liberty Hill. Mr. Cosgrove for thirty years had been a resident of Pittston. He was a man with an extraordinary record, as the following will show: In I859, although he was but 16 years of age, he ran away from home and joined the British army under the assumed name of Thomas Murphy. He entered Co. H, 24th Regiment, British Infantry. In 1867 the regiment, stationed at Burmah, India, of which Mr. Cosgrove was a member, was ordered to investigate the wrecking of a trading vessel near the South Andaman Islands, on the Malay coast. Some of the officers and crew escaped to the shore and were captured by savages. These islands were also thought to be the nest of a band of pirates. One of the small boats which was conveying the soldiers from a warship was overturned by the rough sea. Fourteen of the occupants of the boat swam to shore, but were captured by the savages. They were taken to the interior of the island. Mr. Cosgrove, with five comrades, after a heroic effort, rescued them from the island. The rescuing party were surrounded by many wild savages, armed with arrows, which they used to excellent advantage. Mr. Cosgrove was struck twice in the leg and in the forehead. It was a heroics rescue. In the same year a Victoria Cross was awarded to Mr. Cosgrove and his five companions. The deceased was probably the only one in this section of the country who had such an honor. In his death Pittston has lost a good citizen and home a good father. He had been ill for about three years and had been in a very feeble condition for some time past. The deceased was a member of Branch 72, E. B. A., and Division 15, A. 0. H. He is survived by his wife and the following step-children: Patrick, Michael, Annie and Katie Dougherty, living at home. The funeral will take place Sunday afternoon at 2:30 o&#x27;clock, with interment in Market street cemetery.

It follows &quot;The Shipman&#x27;s Tale&quot; in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. It is followed by Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Tale of Sir Topas&quot;. The General Prologue names the prioress as Madame Eglantine, and describes her impeccable table manners and soft-hearted ways. Her portrait suggests she is likely in religious life as a means of social advancement, given her aristocratic manners and mispronounced French. She maintains a secular lifestyle, including keeping lap dogs that she privileges over people, a fancy rosary and a brooch inscribed with (&#x27;Love Conquers All&#x27;).

Her story is of a child martyr killed by Jews, a common theme in Medieval Christianity, and much later criticism focuses on the tale&#x27;s antisemitism.

==Plot==
The story is introduced with an invocation to the Virgin Mary, then sets the scene in Asia, where a community of Jews live in a Christian city. A seven-year-old school-boy, son of a widow, is brought up to revere Mary. He teaches himself to sing the first verse of the popular medieval hymn (&quot;Nurturing Mother of the Redeemer&quot;); although he does not understand the words, an older classmate tells him it is about Mary, the mother of Jesus. He begins to sing it every day as he walks through the local Jewish ghetto to school.

Satan, &quot;That hath (built) in Jewes&#x27; heart his waspe&#x27;s nest&quot;, incites some Jews to murder the child and throw his body into a public cesspit. His mother searches for him and eventually finds his body, which miraculously begins to sing the . The Christians call in the city magistrate, who has the Jews drawn by wild horses and then hanged. The boy continues to sing throughout his own Requiem Mass until the local abbot asks him how he is able to do so. He replies that although his throat is cut, Mary appeared to him and laid a grain on his tongue, saying he could keep singing until it was removed and she would come for him. The abbot removes the grain and the boy finally becomes silent and dies. The story ends with a reference to Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, another child martyr whose death was blamed on Jews.

==Genre==

The story is an example of a class of stories, popular at the time, known as the &quot;miracles of the Virgin&quot; such as those by Gautier de Coincy. It also blends elements of common story of a pious child killed by the enemies of the faith; the first example of which in English was written about William of Norwich. Matthew Arnold cited a stanza from the tale as the best of Chaucer&#x27;s poetry.

== The Prioress and the Pardoner ==

In &quot;Chaucer&#x27;s Prioress and the Sacrifice of Praise&quot;, Sherman Hawkins juxtaposes the Pardoner and the Prioress as the representatives of two radically different forms of religious expression. The Pardoner&#x27;s materialistic orientation, his suspicious relics and accusations of sinfulness (evident in his conflict with the Host) align him with Paul&#x27;s account of the &quot;outward Jew, circumcised only in the flesh&quot;, rather than the &quot;inward&quot; Jew of Romans 2.29 who is spiritually rather than literally circumcised: &quot;the Pardoner, outwardly &#x27;a noble ecclesiaste&#x27;, actually reduces Christianity to a code as rigorous and external as the Old Law itself.&quot; In his tale, &quot;the Pardoner presents death as the wages of sin, an effect of justice&quot; while the &quot;Prioress, through the paradox of martyrdom, shows it as mercy, an effect of grace.&quot;

In &quot;Criticism, Anti-Semitism and the Prioress&#x27; Tale&quot;, L. O. Fradenburg argues for a radical rereading of the binary oppositions between Christian and Jew, Old Law and New Law, literal and spiritual in the tale in part to critique the &quot;patristic exegesis&quot; of Sherman Hawkins&#x27; earlier interpretation. Fradenburg challenges Hawkins&#x27; &quot;elision of the &#x27;literal&#x27; or &#x27;carnal&#x27; level of meaning in favour of the spiritual&quot; by lingering on those moments in the tale, such as the &quot;litel clergeon&#x27;s&quot; transgressive rote memorisation of the , in which this elision fails, or succeeds only ambiguously. She traces the impossibility of ultimately separating and opposing Old and New Laws in the &quot;Prioress&#x27; Tale&quot; back to a tension between letter and spirit internal to Paul&#x27;s discourse itself. Fradenburg gestures at a larger project of turning &quot;patristic exegesis&quot; against itself to read the contradictions revealed by the theological subtext of the tale.

Fradenburg notes that the substance of the &quot;Prioress&#x27; Tale&quot; can be linked to the child-host&#x27; miracle of the later Middle Ages&quot; which involved the substitution of the &quot;actual body of the Christ Child&quot; for the Eucharist. Such miraculous tales appear designed to reaffirm faith in the miraculous efficacy of transubstantiation in the face of the pressure of Lollard dissent, which broadly questioned the spiritual status of the Eucharist and other Church traditions: relics, clerical celibacy, even pilgrimages. According to Fradenburg, these miraculous tales operate according to a paradoxical logic in which &quot;visuality and carnality are used to insist upon the superior virtue of that which is beyond sight and flesh&quot;. Yet such sacramental materialism remains vulnerable to the kinds of abuse more obviously associated with the Pardoner; Fradenburg cites the case of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, the historical episode of the young English Christian supposedly martyred by Jews, &quot;slayn also / With cursed Jewes, as it is notable / For it is but a litel while ago&quot; (VII 684–686), tacked onto the end of the &quot;Prioress&#x27; Tale&quot;. The tale was intimately bound up with attempts to &quot;aggrandise the spiritual prestige and temporal revenues&quot; of the local cathedral. Thus the vivid &quot;carnality&quot; of the miraculous tale of martyrdom could be deployed as easily to enhance the worldly prominence of the Church as to refute heretical doctrine by reaffirming the spiritual legitimacy of Church rituals. The &quot;Prioress&#x27; Tale&quot; may approximate the greedy exploitation of spirituality embodied by &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Prologue and Tale&quot; insofar as it is indebted to tales of martyrdom circulated for worldly profit.

<doc id="1194699" wikidata="Q3695060" url="?curid=1194699" title="Coseley">
<text>Coseley ( ) is a village in the Dudley district, in the county of the West Midlands, England. It is situated north of Dudley itself, on the border with Wolverhampton and Sandwell. It falls within the Tipton and Wednesbury parliamentary constituency.

==History==

Coseley was originally a village in the ancient manor of Sedgley. In 1867, it joined with Brierley and Ettingshall to break away from the parish of Sedgley and formed Lower Sedgley Local Board District. In 1875, the name was changed to Coseley Local Board District by order of the board and, in 1895, became Coseley Urban District. At this stage, most of the Coseley area was occupied by industrial and agricultural land; it was known during this time for its Carboniferous fossils.
Coseley Urban District Council built several thousand council houses and flats over a 40-year period from the mid-1920s which changed the face of the area. Most of these were built around Woodcross, Lanesfield, Wallbrook, and Brierley.

Coseley gained a cinema, on the corner of Mason Street and Birmingham New Road, during the 1930s, part of the Clifton chain, but this closed in January 1963 as a result of the postwar decline in cinema audiences brought on by the rising popularity of home television. The building was later demolished and a veterinary surgery now occupies the site.

Since 1927, Coseley has had a direct road link with Birmingham and Wolverhampton. The &quot;Birmingham New Road&quot;, a dual carriageway, was laid out at this time.

Bean Cars opened a factory at Coseley in 1919, with another being in operation in central Dudley. The new factory was situated in the south-east of the district near the border with Tipton, and a subsequent second phase of the factory (at the other side of a now-defunct railway line) was actually situated &quot;in&quot; Tipton, as were its offices in Sedgley Road West, which had been taken over by Tipton Urban District Council by the end of the 1930s. Bean ceased production of passenger cars in 1929, and for the next two years switched to commercial vehicles. After 1931, Bean switched ventures again – this time to making car parts. It was a key supplier for the largest independent British carmaker – British Motor Corporation, British Leyland, Austin Rover, Rover Group and most recently MG Rover – until the business closed due to financial problems in October 2005. Its demise was largely blamed on the closure of its key client MG Rover six months earlier. The Tipton part of the Bean site was demolished shortly afterwards and developed for housing, but the Coseley section was not demolished until the summer of 2008. The land has yet to be redeveloped. The former Newey Goodman site, which was divided into industrial units after the company was broken up during the 1990s, was completely abandoned by 2014, but remains undeveloped.

Cannon Industries, famous for producing gas and electric cookers, was based in Coseley from 1861 until the closure of its Havacre Lane factory in 1993. However, the bulk of the factory buildings were retained as Cannon Business Park, a mix of industrial and commercial ventures. The original factory in Darkhouse Lane lay abandoned for many years but was demolished in 2018 and the site redeveloped for housing. The access road to the new housing development has been named Cannon Park Way.

The main &quot;high street&quot; in Coseley is Castle Street. Most of the current buildings have been built since the 1960s. A by-pass was opened on 23 August 1989, incorporating a widened section of Green Street, to relieve congestion in the town centre.

===Civic history===

Coseley was originally part of Staffordshire. Coseley was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Sedgley, in 1894 Coseley became an urban district, on 30 September 1903 Coseley became a civil parish, being formed from the part of Sedgley parish in Coseley Urban District. Coseley had unsuccessfully bid for borough status in 1937. On 1 April 1966, the south of Coseley became part of the County Borough of Dudley, part also went to the County Borough of Wolverhampton, the County Borough of West Bromwich and the County Borough of Walsall. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with Dudley, Wolverhampton, West Bromwich and Walsall. In 1961 the parish had a population of 39,535. In 1974 it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley in the West Midlands. However, the north of the Brierley area and most of Ettingshall were merged into the Wolverhampton County Borough instead, while a smaller area bordering Tipton was transferred into the expanded borough of West Bromwich, in turn becoming part of Sandwell in 1974.

Numerous council housing estates were built by Coseley Urban District Council. Some of the first council estates to be built during the 1920s and 1930s included Ward Grove at Lanesfield, Hartland Avenue at Hurst Hill, Norton Crescent at Wallbrook and the Batmanshill Road estate near Princes End. The first sections of the Woodcross Estate were built in the 1930s, but most of Woodcross was built in the 1950s, along with a further housing estate at Hilton Road in Lanesfield and in the south of the district at Central Drive. A large section of the Wallbrook area was redeveloped with houses and three- and four-storey blocks of flats and maisonettes during the 1950s and 1960s. This includes the area around Spencer Avenue and Chaucer Close, which is now affected by high levels of crime, particularly graffiti, vandalism and drink-fuelled anti-social behaviour.

The Coseley Urban District Council Offices were opened in 1897 on the corner of Green Street and School Street, and remained in that building until the dissolution of the Urban District Council in April 1966. They were demolished in about 1970.

==Geography==
* Roseville – central area of Coseley, situated on the main Birmingham New Road. Local landmarks include Silver Jubilee Park, St Chad&#x27;s Church, the Old Windmill, and Coseley Canal Tunnel.
* Hurst Hill – situated in the west of Coseley near Sedgley, contains many housing types of different ages.
* Wallbrook – situated in the east of Coseley, near Dudley&#x27;s boundary with Sandwell.
* Highfields Estate – situated in the north of Coseley near the Dudley MBC boundary with the City of Wolverhampton, and was mostly developed between 1920 and 1970.
* Foxyards Estate – a housing estate in the south of Coseley on land straddling the Dudley/Sandwell boundary. It was mostly developed in the mid-1960s. Foxyards Primary School has served the estate since 1971. George Andrews, who scored Walsall FC&#x27;s winning goal against Newcastle United in a 1975 FA Cup giant-killing feat, lives on the estate.
* Deepfields – Area of Coseley near the Coseley school. Local landmarks include Coseley School, Coseley railway station, Christ Church, and Coseley Tunnel North portal. The first bridge Wolverhampton-side of the tunnel is named &#x27;Deepfields footbridge&#x27;.

Lanesfield, Woodcross, and Ettingshall were all part of Coseley until 1966, when being incorporated into the borough of Wolverhampton. Part of Princes End was also in Coseley until this date, then being transferred into the borough of West Bromwich (Sandwell from 1974) and the township of Tipton.

==Transport==
Coseley railway station on the West Coast Main Line provides a direct rail link to Wolverhampton and Birmingham. The station is currently operated by West Midlands Trains. The area was served by Deepfields &amp; Coseley railway station from 1852 until replaced by the current station in 1902. The former Coseley Urban District had two stations on the Oxford-Worcester-Wolverhampton railway line: Daisy Bank and Princes End and Coseley, both of which closed in 1962.

Bus services in Coseley are operated by National Express West Midlands, Diamond and Banga Buses. Services travel to Sedgley, Dudley, Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Moseley and Bilston on a regular schedule. These include:

* 8 | Wollaston Farm – Wolverhampton
* X8 | Birmingham – Wolverhampton
* 81 | Dudley – Wolverhampton
* 82 | Dudley – Wolverhampton
* 229 | Dudley – Bilston

==Sport==
In October 2006 a volleyball club was started in Coseley, which competes in the West Midlands Volleyball League. Coseley Volleyball Club initially trained and played matches at Dudley Leisure Centre, but from 25 February 2007 moved to Coseley Leisure Centre.

Coseley also has a cricket club which has been in existence on a site on Church Road since 1870. They currently have 3 teams playing in the Staffs Club Championship on a Saturday, and two teams that play in the Worcester Borders Sunday League. A Youth section has also been recently introduced.

At the end of the 1950s, plans were announced to build a public swimming pool in Coseley. A site to the east of the centre, in Peartree Lane, was identified, and work began on the site on 25 August 1962, the foundation stone being laid by local councillor and future Mayor of Dudley, John T. &quot;Jack&quot; Wilson. It was opened on 30 November 1963 by fellow councillor John Pointon. A &quot;Supachute&quot; slide was added in the late 1980s, but over the following 20 years the building&#x27;s condition gradually deteriorated, resulting in closure by Dudley Council in August 2009, with demolition taking place in March 2010.

==Education==

===Current secondary schools in Coseley===
There have been no secondary schools in Coseley since The Coseley School closed in 2017.

===Former secondary schools in Coseley===
* Mount Pleasant Senior School – was a secondary school built in 1913. The school was merged into the new Coseley School in 1969 and survived as that school&#x27;s annex until July 1972, but the buildings had been used from March 1992 until the early 2010s as the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley&#x27;s records office and archive service.
* Manor Secondary School – opened in 1933, on Ettingshall Road in the Woodcross area, which was then in its first stages of development, growing rapidly after the end of World War II. However, the growth of the surrounding area after 1945 put pressure on places at the Manor, and by the late 1950s Coseley UDC had decided to build a new secondary modern school on Lawnswood Avenue in the extreme north of the district. The school, Parkfield Secondary Modern School, opened in April 1962, but Manor continued as a secondary school until July 1969, with the buildings being retained to form the new Manor Primary School for the autumn term that year. Parkfield School came under control of Wolverhampton council as a result of boundary changes in April 1966, becoming the South Wolverhampton and Bilston Academy in September 2009 and moving to a new site at Bilston three years later, with the old school buildings being retained as the Orchard Centre, a special school for secondary-aged children.
* The Coseley School – opened off Ivyhouse Lane in 1969. However, Dudley Council put pressure on the school by restricting its funding in the mid-2010s, which led to a decline in pupil numbers, which ultimately ended in the council deciding in early 2016 to close it a year later (with it only open to Year 11 in the final year) because of the low numbers caused by the council.

===Current primary schools in Coseley===
* Christ Church Primary School – has one of the oldest school buildings in Dudley Borough, which is still used as a school, dating from the 19th century.
* Foxyards Primary School – situated on the Foxyards Estate, it was built in 1971 to serve the new Foxyards housing estate and its surrounding area. The first head teacher was Joseph Jones. Jones retired in about 1985 to be succeeded by Mr David Cox, the former deputy head of Cotwall End Primary School in Sedgley. Mr Cox was seconded to the local authority in September 1989 for an academic year, during which time Mrs Evans was acting head teacher. Mr Cox finally left in March 1999 to become head of Alder Coppice Primary in Sedgley. Mrs Pam Greenhalgh was acting head of one term before the appointment of Mrs Sandra O&#x27;Gorman, who has been at the helm ever since. Foxyards was built as a one-form entry school for pupils aged from 4 to 11 years, and a nursery unit was added in the mid-1980s. Due to a growing demand for places which saw more than 40 pupils in some year groups, it changed from one-form entry to vertical streaming (up to three classes in two years) in the early 1990s. There are still some mixed age classes in the school, and a new building at the school was opened in 2007 to accommodate growing pupil numbers.
* Hurst Hill Primary School – opened in November 1986 on a new site on Paul Street. It was formed from a merger of St. Mary&#x27;s Primary School and Mount Pleasant Primary School. The school&#x27;s first headteacher was Mr Michael Harvey (who had been head of St. Mary&#x27;s since 1978), with his deputy being Mr Eric Tibble. Mr Tibble became head in the early 1990s on Mr Harvey&#x27;s retirement, and was succeeded himself by Mrs Joy Powell in 2003, before the appointment of the current headteacher Mr Kevin King in 2007. The school was officially opened on 2 March 1987 by Neil Kinnock, leader of the Labour Party.
* Wallbrook Primary School – located in Bradley&#x27;s Lane, in the east of Coseley near the Dudley/Sandwell boundary. There are an estimated 275 pupils aged from 3 to 11 on the school roll. The majority of Wallbrook pupils move to The Coseley School on leaving. The school was established in 1954 under headmaster A R Gowland – who was succeeded by L Clarke. The current head is Mrs C Longden.
*Manor Primary School – located on the A4126/Ettingshall Road; in-between Woodcross and the A4123/Birmingham New Road. The school was originally a senior school, until it was turned into a primary school. It is now under the control of Wolverhampton City Council.

===Former primary schools in Coseley===
* Highfields Primary School – opened in September 1972 as a one-form entry primary school to serve the north-eastern part of Coseley. The last head teacher of the school was Leonard Hazelhurst, appointed in September 2003 to replace Mrs Angela Hambrook. The school closed in July 2006 after Dudley MBC decided that falling numbers on the school roll made it no longer viable, and most of the school&#x27;s remaining pupils were transferred to Wallbrook Primary School. The building has been retained, however, and since March 2008 has housed Rosewood Special School, which relocated from the Russells Hall Estate in southern Dudley.
* Hurst Hill County Primary school (known locally as the &#x27;Board school&#x27;) was located in Hollywell Street. Although on a single site the school operated as separate infants and juniors, each with their own classrooms, halls and playgrounds. At the start of the autumn term 1964 the school relocated down the hill to the Manor School and the buildings were then used by St. Mary&#x27;s C of E Primary School.
* Mount Pleasant Primary School – its history can be traced back to October 1879, when a 500-pupil Board School was opened on Mount Pleasant Street by Sedgley School Board. It moved onto a neighbouring site in 1904, with the old infant and junior schools becoming a senior school, but by the early 1980s these buildings were becoming outdated and plans were unveiled to build a new primary school in the area, to replace both this and the nearby St. Mary&#x27;s Primary School. The school finally closed in November 1986, when Hurst Hill Primary School opened. There were initial plans to retain the Mount Pleasant buildings for community use, but it was ultimately demolished in late 1990 after standing empty for four years. Private housing was later constructed on the site.
* St. Chad&#x27;s Mixed Infant School – was a Church of England school located on Portland Place, at the top of Oak Street near to St. Chad&#x27;s Church.
* St. Mary&#x27;s Primary School – was a Church of England school built during the 19th century to serve the expanding Hurst Hill area of Coseley, and was twinned with the local parish church. Originally located in two buildings in Hurst Road, the primary school was at the corner of Hurst Road and Clifton Street, and the junior school was located in front of St. Mary&#x27;s Church. It relocated to the old &quot;Board Schools&quot; in Hollywell Street and Horace Street, though was very outdated by the early 1980s and plans were announced for a new school to be built nearby, to replace both St. Mary&#x27;s and Mount Pleasant schools. Hurst Hill Primary School opened in November 1986 as the replacement, and the St. Mary&#x27;s buildings were demolished soon afterwards to be redeveloped for private housing.

<text>Timothy O&#x27;Hea VC (1843 – 1874), born in Schull, County Cork, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Victoria Cross==

O&#x27;Hea was born on 11 June 1843, at Schull Co Cork, Ireland. He was a private in the 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army stationed in the Province of Canada when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 9 June 1866 at Danville, Canada East, a fire broke out in a railway car containing of ammunition, between Quebec City and Montreal. The alarm was given and the car was disconnected at Danville Railway Station. While the sergeant in charge was considering what should be done, Private O&#x27;Hea took the keys from his hand, rushed to the car, opened it and called for water and a ladder. It was due to this man&#x27;s example that the fire was suppressed.

==Australia==
O&#x27;Hea is believed to have died in the Sturt Stony Desert in the far south western border area of Queensland in November 1874 while searching for a lost member of the Leichhardt expedition. A book by Elizabeth Reid, (born 1928 and since deceased), &quot;The Singular Journey of O&#x27;Hea&#x27;s Cross&quot;, published in 2005, suggested Timothy O&#x27;Hea died in Ireland, after his discharge from the British Army in 1868. His identity and VC annuity were then assumed by his brother John, and it is this man who actually died in Australia.

==Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum, Winchester, England.

<doc id="1194702" wikidata="Q338097" url="?curid=1194702" title="Lech, Czech, and Rus">
<text>Lech, Czech and Rus (, ) refers to a founding legend of three Slavic brothers who founded three Slavic peoples: the Poles, the Czechs, and the Ruthenians (Belarusians, Russians, and Ukrainians). The three legendary brothers appear together in the &quot;Wielkopolska Chronicle&quot;, compiled in the early 14th century. The legend states that the brothers, on a hunting trip, followed different prey and thus travelled (and settled) in different directions: Lech in the northwest, Czech in the west, and Rus in the northeast. There are multiple versions of the legend, including several regional variants throughout West Slavic, and to lesser extent, other Slavic countries that mention only one or two brothers. The three also figure into the origin myth of South Slavic peoples in some legends. Their stories are often, to some extent as well, used as a myth to understand the eventual foundation of the Polish, Czech and Ruthenian states, in accordance with the legend.

==Polish version==
In the Polish version of the legend, three brothers go hunting together, but each follows a different prey, and eventually, they travel in different directions. Rus went to the east, Čech headed west to settle on Říp, a mountain rising from the Bohemian hilly countryside, while Lech travelled north. While hunting, Lech followed his arrow and suddenly found himself face-to-face with a fierce, white eagle guarding its nest from intruders. Seeing the eagle against the red of the setting sun, Lech took this as a good omen and decided to settle there. He named his &quot;gród&quot; (&#x27;fortified settlement&#x27;) Gniezno ( &#x27;nest&#x27;) in commemoration and adopted the White Eagle as his coat-of-arms. The white eagle remains a symbol of Poland to this day, and the colors of the eagle and the setting sun are depicted in the coat of arms of Poland, as well as its flag, with a white stripe on top for the eagle, and a red stripe on the bottom for the sunset. Lech founded the Polish Kingdom at the beginning of the fifth century.

According to the 13th-century &quot;Wielkopolska Chronicle&quot;, Slavs are descendants of Prince Pan of Pannonia. He had three sons – Lech (the youngest), Rus, and Čech (the oldest), who decided to settle north, east, and west, respectively.

==Czech version ==
A variant of this legend, involving only two brothers (and three sisters), is also known in the Czech Republic. As in the Polish version, Čech is identified as the founder of the Czech nation (&quot;Češi&quot; pl.) and Lech as the founder of the Polish nation. Zdeněk Nejedlý argued that Cosmas of Prague&#x27;s &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot; (12th century) described Čech&#x27;s arrival from Northeastern Bohemia once called White Croatia. The older chronicles from 14th century (such as those of Dalimil, Wenceslaus Hajek and Přibík Pulkava z Radenína) do not specify the location of Čech and Lech&#x27;s homeland &quot;Charvaty&quot;, but in the Alois Jirásek retelling of &quot;Staré pověsti české (Old Bohemian Legends)&quot; from 1894 it is more closely determined; &quot;Za Tatrami, v rovinách při řece Visle rozkládala se od nepaměti charvátská země, část prvotní veliké vlasti slovanské&quot; (Behind the Tatra Mountains, in the plains of the river Vistula, stretched from immemorial time Charvátská country (probably meaning so-called Great or White Croatia), the initial part of the great Slavic homeland), and &quot;V té charvátské zemi bytovala četná plemena, příbuzná jazykem, mravy, způsobem života&quot; (In Charvátská existed numerous tribes, related by language, manners, and way of life). In the same century, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor in 1347 claimed &quot;seniority of Croatian&quot;. Dušan Třeštík saw parallels of number seven and else in the Croatian &quot;origo gentis&quot; of five brothers and two sisters from the 30th chapter of &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; by Constantine VII (10th century).

However, numerous battles had made the country very unfavorable for the people, who were accustomed to living in peace, cultivating the land and growing grain. According to other versions, the reason was that Čech had been accused of murder. They gathered their people and set off towards the sunset. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Dalimil&quot; (1314), when Čech and his people climbed Říp Mountain, he looked upon the landscape and told his six brothers that they have reached the promised land: a country where there are enough beasts, birds, fish, and bees so that their tables will be always full, and where they could defend themselves against enemies. He settled in the area with a tribe and, according to the &quot;Přibík Pulkava&quot; version (circa 1374), his brother Lech continued his journey to the lowlands over the snowy mountains of the north, where he founded Poland.

Wenceslaus Hajek&#x27;s version from 1541 adds many (probably fanciful) details not found in other sources. According to Hájek, the brothers were dukes who had already owned castles in their homeland before their arrival in the region and dates their arrival to the year 644.

==Croatian version==
A similar legend with partly changed names (Čeh, Leh, Meh and sister Vilina), was also registered in folk tales in Croatia in the Kajkavian dialect of Krapina in Zagorje (northern Croatia). However, some believe it isn&#x27;t of ancient origin but rather it was introduced among commoners by literary people since 16th century. Hajek was the first to mention Krapina as place of origin of Leh meanwhile Čeh ruled over Psar near stream/river Krupa, while Klemens Janicki wrote that Lech emigrated from island Hvar in Dalmatia. Already since 16th century Vinko Pribojević, Faust Vrančić, Mavro Orbini and others from today&#x27;s Croatia wrote that Čeh and Leh arrived from Croatia and related Czech and Polish language with Croatian, while Juraj Ratkaj was the first to assert that Čeh, Leh, and Meh&#x27;s origin is in Krapina. Many wrote about it, including Johann Christoph Jordan who personally came to Krapina to hear it told by the local people and mentioned it in &quot;De Originibus Slavicis&quot; (1745), in 1702 was held a theatre play, in 1848 the three brothers were part of the coat of arms of Varaždin county and the flag was present during the office inauguration of Josip Jelačić, the legend was in addition popularized especially by Ljudevit Gaj, while Stjepan Ortner published the legend in full form in 1899. The legend was one of the reasons Croatian language was chosen in 17th century as the common Slavic language for Catholic books for all Slavic nations.

==Debate==
In the Bohemian chronicles, Čech appears on his own or only with Lech. Čech is first mentioned in Latin as &quot;Bohemus&quot; in the Cosmas&#x27; chronicle of 1125. The earliest Polish mention of Lech, Čech, and Rus is found in the &quot;Chronicle of Greater Poland&quot; written at the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century.

The legend suggests a common ancestry of the Poles, Czechs and the Ruthenians (Rus&#x27;), and illustrates the fact that as early as the 13th century at least three different Slavic peoples were aware of being ethnically and linguistically interrelated. The legends also agree on the location of the homeland of the Early Slavic peoples in Eastern Europe. This area overlapped the region presumed by mainstream scholarship to be the Proto-Indo-European homeland in the general region of the Pontic–Caspian steppe. In the framework of the Kurgan hypothesis, &quot;the Indo-Europeans who remained after the migrations became speakers of Balto-Slavic&quot;.

The most well-known version of the legend is seen to be somewhat Polonocentric, as it mentions a national symbol (the white eagle) only for Lech and the Polish nation, while relegating the two other brothers Czech and Rus to secondary characters. Furthermore, this particular version does not address the origin of the South Slavic peoples.

The legend also attempts to explain the etymology of the ethnonyms: Lechia (another name for Poland including Silesia), the Czech lands (including Bohemia, Moravia, and also Silesia), and Rus&#x27;. Jan Kochanowski, a prominent Renaissance Polish man of letters, in his essay on the origin of the Slavs, makes no mention of the third &quot;brother&quot;, Rus. Moreover, he dismisses the legend entirely, stating that &quot;no historian who has taken up the subject of the Slavic nation [...] mentions any of those two Slavic leaders, Lech and Czech&quot;. He goes on to assume that &quot;Czechy&quot; and &quot;Lechy&quot; are quite probably the original names for the two nations, although he does not dismiss the possibility that there might have been a great leader by the name Lech whose name replaced the original and later forgotten name for the Polish nation.

==Legacy==
===Oaks of Rogalin===
Three large oaks in the garden adjacent to the 18th-century palace in Rogalin, Greater Poland, are named after the brothers (&quot;Lech, Czech i Rus&quot;), and are several hundred years old. They vary between in circumference. They are part of the Rogalin Landscape Park, and together with others they have been declared nature monuments and placed under protection.

<text>Edmond Joseph O&#x27;Toole VC was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Origins==

He was the fourth son of Charles O&#x27;Toole of Wilford, Bray, Ireland and brother of Luke O&#x27;Toole of Toole and Company, Seed Merchants. He was baptised in Dublin in 1848. It had been previously claimed falsely that he was born at Grahamstown, South Africa, but it has been shown that he was born in Ireland of an Irish family. Several sources report his death as 1891 in Salisbury, Rhodesia but there is a reference to him being a resident of the &quot;Cape&quot; in 1900. and Tanser states the Darter&#x27;s claim that he died in 1891 is incorrect.

He was always known as Pat or Paddy O&#x27;Toole. His first name is sometimes spelt as Edmond.

==Details==

He was a Sergeant in the Frontier Light Horse, British Colonial forces during the Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 3 July 1879 at Ulundi, Zululand, South Africa, during the retirement of a reconnoitering party, a captain (Lord William Leslie de la Poer Beresford) of the 9th Lancers went to the assistance of Sergeant Fitzmaurice of the 24th Regiment whose horse had fallen and rolled on him. The Zulus were coming up quickly in great numbers, but the officer, with help from Sergeant O&#x27;Toole, managed to mount the injured man behind him. He was, however, so dizzy that the sergeant, who had been keeping back the enemy, gave up his carbine and rode alongside to hold him on. They all finally reached safety.

Beresford&#x27;s VC was gazetted on 23 August 1879. It is reported that when he collected his medal from the Queen he told her that &quot;he could not in honour receive the recognition of his services unless it were shared in by Sergeant O’Toole&quot;. O&#x27;Toole was then gazetted on 10 October 1879.

:&quot;Her Majesty pinning it on to the hero&#x27;s breast, but not before he had explained to his Queen he could not in honour receive recognition of any services he had been able to perform, unless Sergeant O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s services were also recognised, as he deserved infinitely greater credit than any that might attach to himself. The Queen, appreciating this generosity and soldierly honesty, bestowed the reward also on Sergeant Edmund OToole of Baker&#x27;s Horse, and Lord William was satisfied.&quot;

He later achieved the rank of Captain.

<doc id="1194705" wikidata="Q7303751" url="?curid=1194705" title="Red Bird Records">
<text>Red Bird Records was a record label founded by American pop music songwriters Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller, and George Goldner in 1964. Though often thought of as a &quot;girl-group&quot; label, female-led acts made up only 40% of the artist roster on Red Bird and its associated labels (including Blue Cat Records, Tiger and Daisy). However, female-led acts also accounted for more than 90% of the label&#x27;s charting records.

The label&#x27;s first release was &quot;Chapel of Love&quot; by the Dixie Cups, which quickly reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, a feat matched later that year by the Shangri-Las&#x27; &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;. Eleven of the first 30 singles released by Red Bird reached the Top Forty.

==History==
After closing Spark Records (in 1955) and working for Atlantic (1955–1961) then United Artists (1961–1963) and starting Red Bird, Leiber and Stoller brought in George Goldner, a veteran record promoter and former owner of Gee Records, Gone Records and Rama Records. They used the skillful Brill Building husband-and-wife songwriting team of Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, who had been writing most of Phil Spector&#x27;s first hits. The label was sold in 1966 as Leiber and Stoller preferred to write and produce rather than manage the business of running a label, and after they had a falling-out with Goldner whose gambling debts caused Red Bird to be taken over by the Mafia. Leiber and Stoller sold Red Bird to Goldner for one dollar. Goldner then sold the Red Bird catalogue to raise money.

A subsidiary label, Blue Cat Records, had a hit with &quot;The Boy from New York City&quot; by The Ad Libs.

<text>Spark Records was a record label started by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller around 1954 in Los Angeles, California. Artists released on Spark Records included Willy &amp; Ruth, The Sly Fox, Ervin &quot;Big Boy&quot; Groves, and The Robins. Leiber and Stoller eventually decided that while they wanted to write songs and make records, but did not want to deal with the mechanics of publishing records, so they sold the label to Atlantic Records.

<doc id="1194710" wikidata="Q32910" url="?curid=1194710" title="Domino (2005 film)">
<text>Domino is a 2005 action crime film directed by Tony Scott with a screenplay by Richard Kelly from a story by Kelly and Steve Barancik. An international co-production between France, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the film is inspired by Domino Harvey, the English daughter of stage and screen actor Laurence Harvey, who became a Los Angeles bounty hunter.

Its plot flashes back as Domino (Keira Knightley), a fashion model turned bounty hunter, narrates how a $10 million robbery came about 36 hours before. Supporting actors include Mickey Rourke, Édgar Ramírez, Delroy Lindo, Mena Suvari, Mo&#x27;Nique, Lucy Liu, and Christopher Walken. The film is dedicated to Harvey, who died at age 35 from an overdose of fentanyl on 27 June 2005, a few months before the film was released.

==Plot==
Domino Harvey, a bounty hunter, has been arrested by the FBI, investigating the theft of $10 million from an armored truck. She is interviewed by criminal psychologist Taryn Mills who tells her everything she knows about the case. Domino explains her profession and the events leading up to the theft with Mills occasionally prompting her to give more detail.

Domino is a former model living in Los Angeles who becomes a bounty hunter when, after being kicked out of college, she notices a newspaper advertisement for a bounty hunter training seminar. Her colleagues are Ed Moseby, Choco, and Afghan driver, Alf. They are employed by Claremont Williams III, a bail bondsman who also runs an armored car business, and whose mistress, Lateesha Rodriguez, works for the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Lateesha&#x27;s granddaughter Mica is suffering from a blood disease and needs an operation that costs $300,000. Claremont sets up the robbery of $10 million from Drake Bishop, the owner of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and a client of Claremont. His bounty hunters would return the stolen money and collect a $300,000 finder&#x27;s fee from Bishop.

Lateesha has been running a counterfeit driver&#x27;s license racket at the DMV. A teenager named Frances arrives at the DMV and asks Lateesha for fake licenses for himself, his brother, and two of their friends. The FBI are tipped about Lateesha&#x27;s racket. They threaten to send her to jail unless she gives them information about Frances, whom they have been surveilling. Lateesha throws them off the trail by saying that Frances, his brother, and his two friends are going to commit the armored car robbery when in reality she and Claremont are doing it themselves.

Lateesha carries out the robbery with the help of three co-workers. Claremont finds that Frances and his brother are the sons of mafia boss Anthony Cigliutti. He phones Lateesha and tells her to abort the plan, leaving the money with getaway driver Locus Fender, who takes the money to his mother&#x27;s trailer home. Claremont has the bounty hunters apprehend Frances, his brother, and his two friends and then tells them to deliver them to men working for Drake Bishop. Claremont tells them to retrieve the money from Fender and to deliver it to Bishop at the Stratosphere Casino. Following a shootout with Fender&#x27;s mother, the $10 million is retrieved. Cigliutti is told about his sons&#x27; arrest and is led to believe that Bishop had his sons killed. In reality, Bishop&#x27;s men released the boys after learning that they did not know anything about the robbery. Believing his sons dead, Cigliutti wants revenge and heads for the Stratosphere. In Las Vegas, Domino takes $300,000 of Bishop&#x27;s money and gives it to Lateesha for Mica&#x27;s operation.

At the Stratosphere, the bounty hunters meet with Bishop, who has an armed crew with him. Domino and Bishop discuss the $10 million and what should happen next. Alf has stolen the money and filled the sacks with plastic explosives. He then reveals that he has the remote detonator taped to his hand, and has shipped the money to free Afghanistan. Shortly after this revelation, Cigliutti turns up with his crew. Though Bishop denies he had Cigliutti&#x27;s sons killed, Cigliutti shoots him and Beckett. In the ensuing gunfight, Choco and Ed are severely wounded but make it into the elevator with Domino. Alf, critically wounded, sacrifices himself to blow up the top of the Stratosphere and Domino is the only survivor.

After telling Taryn Mills everything, Domino is released by the FBI. Mills advises her to retire from bounty hunting. The (nearly) $10 million in boxes is delivered to Afghanistan and opened by celebrating children in the streets, Mica gets her $300,000 operation, and Domino shares a moment with her mother.

==Cast==

In addition, Dale Dickey plays Edna Fender, Tom Waits plays the Wanderer, and Riz Abbasi is Alf, the team&#x27;s driver from Afghanistan. Jerry Springer makes a cameo appearance as himself, hosting his show.

===Development===

In 1994 director Tony Scott was sent an article from the British newspaper &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; by his business manager Neville Shulman. The article, written by Sacha Gervasi and titled &quot;My gun for hire: Why a movie star&#x27;s rebel daughter turned into a bounty hunter&quot;, was about an English woman named Domino Harvey who was working as a bounty hunter, apprehending fugitives who had skipped bail for the Celes King Bail Bond agency in South Central Los Angeles. While Harvey was one of the few female bounty hunters, what caught the attention of Shulman and Scott was that she was the daughter of actor Laurence Harvey.

Tony Scott tracked Domino to Beverly Hills, where she was living at the time with her mother Paulene Stone and Stone&#x27;s then-husband Peter Morton. He invited Domino to his office, where he proposed a film of her life. Domino agreed and sold Scott the film rights. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Harvey was paid $360,000 for the rights. Tony Scott interviewed Harvey about her life and her work bounty hunting. Scott also met and interviewed Ed Martinez and Choco, who were Domino&#x27;s bounty-hunting colleagues. She took him to meet Celes King III, the bail bondsman they worked for.

20th Century Fox, which had a first refusal deal on the project, turned it down and in the end the film was financed by New Line Cinema.

Steve Barancik wrote the first draft of the screenplay, in 1997, which Scott rejected. A second script was written by Roger Avary, but was also rejected by Scott. Scott described the two rejected screenplays as conventional biopics of Domino Harvey&#x27;s life, which was not what he had in mind. Finally, Richard Kelly was asked to write the screenplay after Scott read his script for &quot;Southland Tales&quot;. Kelly was sent transcripts of Domino Harvey&#x27;s interviews with Tony Scott, but he did not read the scripts that Scott had rejected. In discussing the finished product, Kelly commented that &quot;...Domino might be one of the most subversive films released by a major studio since &quot;Fight Club&quot;&quot;.

Tony Scott thought of Keira Knightley for the role of Domino after seeing her in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. Mickey Rourke initially turned down the film, describing the part of bounty hunter Ed Moseby as &quot;one-dimensional&quot;; he agreed to do the film when Scott had the role rewritten.

===Filming===
Filming began in Los Angeles on October 4, 2004. Filming locations included the Ambassador Hotel, the Hotel Alexandria, and the Wilshire Grand Hotel. Scenes were also shot at the Santa Monica Department of Motor Vehicles. Filming moved to Nevada in early December 2004. Scenes were filmed at the Valley of Fire State Park, as well as Hoover Dam and Needles, California.

During the final week of production, scenes were filmed over six days at the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Interior shots included the resort&#x27;s Top of the World restaurant, which was closed at the time for renovations. The Stratosphere was not in the original script. Executive producer Barry Waldman met with the casino&#x27;s owners in the summer of 2004 to discuss featuring it in the movie, which the owners agreed to after small changes were made to the script. Tony Scott said an eight-minute BMW commercial he shot at the resort was &quot;a testing ground&quot; for &quot;Domino&quot;.

Scenes were filmed at the Bonnie Springs Ranch motel on December 20, 2004. Scott had wanted to include the ranch and the Valley of Fire in one of his movies. The following day, scenes were filmed at the Stardust Resort and Casino&#x27;s Starlight Lounge. Filming concluded on December 22, 2004, after scenes were shot at the intersection of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara Avenue. Filming lasted a combined total of 62 days.

==Release==
The release date of the film was announced and delayed several times. The original release date was August 19, 2005. On May 22, 2005, the release date was changed to November 4, 2005. On June 28, 2005, a day after Harvey&#x27;s death, the release date was changed to November 23, 2005. On July 11, 2005, it was moved to October 14, 2005, which was the date the film was released on. The film had its premiere on October 11, 2005, in Los Angeles.

The film was released on October 14, 2005, in 2,223 theaters across America and grossed $4,670,120 on its opening weekend. The film stayed in release for four weeks and ended up with a gross of $10,169,202. In other territories, the film grossed $13,404,855 which, added to the domestic gross, gave the film a total worldwide gross of $23,574,057. This was a box-office flop compared to the film&#x27;s estimated $50 million cost.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;Domino&quot; has an approval rating of 18%, based on 155 reviews, with an average rating of 4.00/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;The life story of model-turned-bounty-hunter Domino Harvey struggles to get out of this overwrought and excessive biopic.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, which it ranks as &quot;generally unfavorable&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;C+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Owen Gleiberman in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;Domino&quot; a &#x27;D&#x27; grade, describing it as &quot;trash shot to look like art imitating trash&quot;. Gleiberman criticized the plot as &quot;so dense with ersatz Elmore Leonard convolutions that it manages to stay three steps ahead of the audience and four steps behind common sense&quot;. Kenneth Turan in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also criticized the story, saying that the film was &quot;so over-plotted that it&#x27;s borderline incomprehensible&quot;. A more positive review came from Jeff Otto at IGN who praised the film for originality and also praised the acting. Otto stated that &quot;the final result is a bit of a mess, but it&#x27;s one hell of an entertaining mess&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; also wrote a positive review, giving the film three stars and saying he admired it. The film was among Tony Scott&#x27;s favourites of his own films, although he was also very critical of it, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t let the movie breathe enough. The script was great—Richard Kelly wrote a great script—and I got overcome by the insanity of the world I was touching. I think I fucked up on that one.&quot;

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD and VHS on February 21, 2006. The DVD contained several extra features including an audio commentary with Tony Scott and Richard Kelly, deleted scenes from the film, featurettes on Domino Harvey and the visual style of the film, the teaser trailer and the theatrical trailer. While the film was released in its original widescreen format in all DVD regions, the film was also released in a full screen format on Region 1. The film was released on Blu-ray on January 20, 2009.

<text>USS &quot;Ontario&quot; was a lake schooner in the United States Navy during the War of 1812.

&quot;Ontario&quot; was built as a merchant ship on Lake Ontario; purchased in October 1812; and placed in service in 1813, Sailing Master Joseph Stevens in command.

Part of Commodore Isaac Chauncey&#x27;s tiny Lake Ontario squadron protecting upstate New York from a seaborne British and Canadian invasion, &quot;Ontario&quot; supported an attack on York, Canada, on 27 April 1813. General Zebulon Pike landed 1700 troops to raid the town while the U.S. squadron destroyed large quantities of stores and burned a schooner under construction. The warship then cooperated with troops attacking Fort George on 27 May, forcing a British evacuation of the Niagara Frontier. She then patrolled the Lake against British warship and merchantmen movements into the summer.

From 7–11 August, &quot;Ontario&quot;, still with Chauncey&#x27;s 13-ship squadron, fought a running engagement with British Captain James Yeo&#x27;s 6-ship group. Losing two ships on the 8th to heavy weather, the squadron had two more captured during the inconclusive exchange of fire on the 10th. A further sea fight on the 11th brought no more results but finally, a battle off York on 28 August succeeded in damaging two British ships and forced the enemy to flee into Burlington Bay.

For the next year and one-half, &quot;Ontario&quot; remained on Lake Ontario on patrol against any British invasion attempts. Laid up in ordinary following the end of the War of 1812, the converted commercial schooner was sold on 15 May 1815 and returned to merchant service.

<text>Gnaeus Papirius Aelianus Aemilius Tuscillus was a Roman senator, who was active during the reign of Antoninus Pius. He was suffect consul in the &quot;nundinium&quot; of September-December 135 as the colleague of Publius Rutilius Fabianus, as attested by two different military diplomas. Aelianus is best known for being governor of Roman Britain in 146.

Anthony Birley notes two fragmentary inscriptions recorded at Iliberris bear his name, which leads Birley to conclude Aelianus was a native of the town. From these inscriptions we know two of the earliest steps of his cursus honorum. The earliest mentioned in the surviving fragments is quaestor of Achaea; upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he would be enrolled in the Senate. After this Aelianus was commissioned military tribune for an unknown legion. Birley identifies Aelianus as the governor of Dacia Superior named on a building inscription dated to 132 at Sarmizegetusa.

Little is known of his tenure in Britain, although Aelianus was probably in charge of the occupation of the Scottish Lowlands following its reconquest by Quintus Lollius Urbicus. This may have been peaceful as he was able to spare troops to take part in the Moorish campaign of 145–47. Nor is anything known of Aelianus after he left Britain. Birley notes &quot;it may be presumed that the homonymous &quot;cos. ord.&quot; of 184 was his grandson.&quot;

<text>George Albert Ravenhill VC (21 February 1872 – 14 April 1921) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and other Commonwealth forces. Ravenhill is one of eight men whose VCs were involuntarily forfeited.

==Military service==
Ravenhill was born in Aston, Birmingham in 1872. In May 1889 Ravenhill joined the 1st Battalion of The Royal Scots Fusiliers at Birr, County Offaly. He served near six years in India then two years with the 2nd Battalion in South Africa. He gained the Queen&#x27;s and the King&#x27;s medals, with clasps, for Relief of Ladysmith, Transvaal and Cape Colony.

Ravenhill was 27 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Scots Fusiliers, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place on 15 December 1899 at the battle of Colenso, South Africa for which he was awarded the VC. His citation reads:
He was wounded at Colenso due to being shot through the forearm.

==Forfeiture==
Ravenhill&#x27;s VC was forfeited in 1908 after he was imprisoned for theft of a quantity of iron and could not afford to pay the 10 shilling fine. His VC-entitled pension was also withdrawn. 

Despite the forfeiture of his VC, Ravenhill re-enlisted into the army in September 1914, aged 42, and fought in the First World War. During the next two years he earned the British, Victory and 1915 Star campaign medals. He was invalided out of the army for health reasons in 1916.

Ravenhill died in poverty at the age of 49, and three of his children were taken away to be fostered in the USA and Canada. Ravenhill is buried in an unmarked grave at Witton Cemetery, Birmingham.

==The Medal==
Ravenhill&#x27;s Victoria Cross is currently displayed at the Museum of The Royal Highland Fusiliers in Glasgow, Scotland.

<text>Frederick Hugh Sherston Roberts (8 January 1872 – 17 December 1899) was a British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Roberts was the son of the famous Victorian commander Field Marshal Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts.

==Early life==
Born in Umballa, India, Roberts attended Sandroyd School before heading to Eton College and joined the British Army soon after completing his studies. As the son of Field Marshal Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, one of the greatest commanders of the Victorian era, he followed his father into the army and, after the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps on 10 June 1891. After joining the army he was soon involved in action, fighting in the Waziristan Expedition in 1894 and 1895, where he was mentioned in dispatches. He came to the attention of senior officers for his effective leadership. In 1898 he took part in the Nile Expedition following which he was promoted lieutenant, and awarded Order of Meijidieh, 4th class, from the Ottoman Empire.

==Second Boer War==
At the age of 27, Roberts went with the King&#x27;s Rifles to the Second Boer War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 15 December 1899 at the Battle of Colenso, South Africa, Roberts, with several others, tried to save the guns of the 14th and 66th Batteries, Royal Field Artillery, when the detachments serving the guns had all become casualties or been driven from their guns. Some of the horses and drivers were sheltering in a donga, a dried watercourse, about 500 yards behind the guns and the intervening space was swept with shell and rifle fire. Roberts with two other officers (Walter Congreve and Harry Norton Schofield) and Corporal George Nurse helped to hook a team into a limber and then to limber up a gun. While doing so, he fell badly wounded and two days later died of his wounds at Chieveley, Natal. The action was observed by the Commander-in-Chief, Redvers Buller, who recommended Roberts for the VC in a despatch written on 16 December, before Roberts had died from his wounds.

Confirmation of the award was made on 2 February 1900, the citation reading:

Roberts and his father were one of only three father-son pairs to win the VC, his father having won it in 1858 for an action at Khudaganj during the Indian rebellion.

Roberts&#x27; Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum in Chelsea, London.

<text>In mathematics, the Heine–Cantor theorem states that a continuous function between two metric spaces is uniformly continuous if its domain is compact.
The theorem is named after Eduard Heine and Georg Cantor.
An important special case of the Cantor theorem is that every continuous function from a closed bounded interval to the real numbers is uniformly continuous.

For an alternative proof in the case of formula_1, a closed interval, see the article Non-standard calculus.

<doc id="1194734" wikidata="Q5549936" url="?curid=1194734" title="Gerard Broadmead Roope">
<text>Lieutenant Commander Gerard Broadmead Roope (13 March 1905 – 8 April 1940) was a posthumous British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

A 35-year-old Royal Navy officer, his action was the earliest awarded a Victoria Cross in the Second World War (although the award was not gazetted until after hostilities ended) and is one of very few to have the award justified, in part, from a recommendation and supporting evidence provided by the enemy.

==Early life, education, and early naval career==
Roope was born at Hillbrook, Trull, near Taunton in Somerset, son of Gerard Roope, described as a &quot;gentleman of independent means&quot;, and Florence, daughter of Thomas Palfrey Broadmead, JP, of Enmore Castle, Somerset. The Broadmead family had owned Enmore Castle since the 1830s, becoming part of the landed gentry.

He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth from the age of 13, and on 15 January 1923 was appointed a midshipman in the gunroom of the battleship HMS &quot;Revenge&quot;. He subsequently served as a sub-lieutenant on the &quot;Concord&quot; and the &quot;Caledon&quot;, and on the &quot;Marlborough&quot; as a lieutenant, before taking command of the G-class destroyer HMS &quot;Glowworm&quot; on 22 July 1938.

==Gallantry in action==

On 8 April 1940, in the Norwegian Sea, the destroyer HMS &quot;Glowworm&quot; (1,345 tons), commanded by Lt-Cdr Roope, engaged two enemy destroyers while heading alone to Norway&#x27;s West Fjord. After one of the enemy ships was hit, they both broke off and retreated to the north. Though aware that the enemy destroyers were attempting to draw him towards German capital ships, he gave chase. &quot;Glowworm&quot; soon spotted the German cruiser &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; (14,000 tons). He alerted the Home Fleet before turning to engage the cruiser. &quot;Glowworm&quot; fired ten torpedoes but scored no hits and was soon battered by enemy rounds and set on fire. With only three guns still firing, the heavily damaged destroyer ended up ramming the cruiser, gouging open several holes in her hull and destroying her forward starboard torpedo mounting. &quot;Glowworm&quot; then fired one more salvo, scoring a hit, before she capsized and sank. Of the crew of 149, one officer and 30 men survived and were chivalrously picked up by the &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;. Lt-Cdr Roope drowned in the course of assisting the rescue of survivors. The &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;&#x27;s commander, Kapitän zur See Hellmuth Heye, wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, recommending award of the VC for his opponent&#x27;s courage in engaging a vastly superior warship.

==The medal==

The citation reads:

The award was presented to his widow on 12 February 1946. This Victoria Cross is currently in private ownership and is not on public display.

==Personal life==
Roope married Faith Dulcibella (1907–2001), daughter of George Frederick Clarke, of St Mary&#x27;s Lodge, Argyle Road, Walton St Mary, Clevedon, Somerset, of a landed gentry family of Bridwell, Devon, and Theodora, daughter of Rev. John Benson Sidgwick, rector of Ashby Parva, Leicestershire. The Roopes lived at Richmond, then part of Surrey (now Greater London) and had a son and daughter. After the war Faith remarried. She died in 2001.

==Literary reference==
The novel &quot;Battle of the April Storm&quot;, by Larry Forrester, is based upon the action between &quot;Glowworm&quot; and &quot;Hipper&quot;. The characters are fictional, including the &quot;Glowworm&quot;&#x27;s captain, but the story depicts an &quot;unlucky&quot; ship that is redeemed by an heroic final action and, at the end, the fellowship between mariners, even enemies.

<text>Edward John Francis Ryan, VC (9 February 1890 – 3 June 1941) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was approximately 28 years old, and a private in the 55th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 30 September 1918 at the Hindenburg Defences, France, when the enemy succeeded in establishing a bombing party in the rear of the battalion&#x27;s recently won position, Private Ryan, on his own initiative, organized and led a party of men with bombs and bayonets against the enemy. He reached the position with only three men and they succeeded in driving the enemy back. Private Ryan cleared the last of them alone, finally falling wounded himself.

After the war, Ryan struggled to adjust to civilian life. During the Great Depression Ryan was an itinerant worker. In 1935, he walked to Mildura where he was given work by the local council. He later worked for an insurance company in Melbourne. By 1941, Ryan was again destitute and working as an itinerant labourer. In June that year he was diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted to Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he died. He was buried in the Catholic section of Springvale Cemetery with an honour guard of eight Victoria Cross winners in attendance.

His Victoria Cross was displayed at the Australian War Memorial &quot;(Canberra, Australia)&quot;.

<text>Anantnag district is an administrative district of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir in the disputed Kashmir region. It is one of ten districts which make up the Kashmir Valley. The district headquarters is Anantnag city. As of 2011, it was the third most populous district of Jammu and Kashmir (out of 22), after Jammu and Srinagar.

==Administration==
At the time of the 2011 census, Anantnag district comprised: Anantnag, Bijbehara, Dooru, Kokernag, Pahalgam, and Shangus tehsils. The district consisted of seven blocks: Breng, Shangus, Achabal, Dachnipora, Qazigund, Khoveripora and Shahabad. 

==Geography==
Anantnag district has a total area of . The district is bordered by Kargil district and Kishtwar district in the east, Doda district and Ramban district to the south and Ganderbal district to the north and Kulgam, Srinagar, Pulwama and Shopian districts to the west.

==Climate==
Anantnag features a moderate climate (Köppen climate classification. Anantnag&#x27;s climate is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering Karakoram to its east and the Pirpanjal range to the south. It can be generally described as cool in the spring and autumn, mild in the summer, and cold in the winter. As a large city with significant differences in Geolocation among various districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly areas of the east as compared to the flat northern part of Anantnag.

Summer is usually mild and with a little rain, but relative humidity is generally high and the nights are cool. The precipitation occurs throughout the year but no one month is particularly dry. The hottest month is July (mean minimum temperature 6 °C, mean maximum temperature 32 °C) and the coldest are December–January (mean minimum temperature -15 °C, mean maximum temperature 0 °C).

Weather conditions are unpredictable. The record high temperature is 33 °C and the record low is -18 °C. On 5–6 January 2012, after years of relatively little snow, a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures shocked the city covering it in a thick layer of snow and ice, forcing them to officially declare a state of emergency and calling the following two days (6 and 7 January) off for the whole valley.

Anantnag has seen an increase in relative humidity and annual precipitation in the last few years. This is most likely because of the commercial afforestation projects which also includes expanding parks and green cover. The suburb parts of Anantnag are lusher than the central part.
Anantnag District possesses all the typical characteristics of the climate of Kashmir Valley as a whole. &quot;In his introduction to the &quot;Rajtarangini Kulan&quot; or &quot;Kalhána&quot;, Pandit says about the climate of Valley: &#x27;It is a country where the sun shines mildly, being the place created by Kashayapa as if for his glory. High school-houses, the saffron, iced water and grapes, which are rare even in heaven, are common here. Kailasa is the best place in the three worlds, Himalaya the best part of Kailásá, and Kashmir the best place in Himalaya.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Sir Walter Lawrence writes in his book &quot;The Valley of Kashmir&quot; that in latitude Kashmir corresponds with Peshawar, Baghdad and Damascus in Asia: with Fez in Morocco: and South Carolina in America, but it presents none of the characteristics of those countries. People have linked the climate of Kashmir to that of Switzerland until the end of May, and of Southern France in July and August. But it is impossible to speak of Kashmir as possessing any one climate or group of characteristics. Every hundred feet of elevation brings some new phase of climate and of vegetation.&quot;

==Politics==
Anantnag district has 7 assembly constituencies: Anantnag, Anantnag West, Dooru, Kokernag, Shangus-Anantnag East, Bijbehara and Pahalgam. Anantnag district has one Lok Sabha constituency.

<text>CSS Cotton Plant, sometimes referred to as &quot;Cotton Planter&quot;, was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1860 and reportedly carried troops in the Pamlico River as early as September 1861. She sailed with CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot; when that ironclad ram attacked Union forces at Plymouth, North Carolina, sank USS &quot;Southfield&quot; and drove off USS &quot;Miami&quot;, USS &quot;Ceres&quot; and USS &quot;Whitehead&quot; on April 18–19, 1864. On May 5, 1864 she steamed as convoy to &quot;Albemarle&quot; from the Roanoke River en route to the Alligator River. The convoy was engaged by ships of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in the Battle of Albemarle Sound, but both the ram and &quot;Cotton Plant&quot; with several launches in tow escaped into the Roanoke River.

In May 1865, &quot;Cotton Plant&quot; was surrendered to Union officials near Halifax, North Carolina by parties claiming that she had been appropriated by Confederate authorities. Ownership was adjudicated at Plymouth and she was turned over to the U.S. Treasury purchasing agent to transport cotton and provisions. She was later delivered to the U.S. Navy at Norfolk, Virginia.

<text>Blood of the Fold is the third book in Terry Goodkind&#x27;s epic fantasy series &quot;The Sword of Truth.&quot;

==Plot introduction==
Prior to the start of &quot;Blood of the Fold,&quot; Richard comes to terms with his true identity as a War Wizard, a powerful wizard with both additive and subtractive magic. The New World, and all the freedom of humankind, is under threat from the Imperial Order after the barrier between the Old and New World was brought down. The Imperial Order has already sent delegations and armies into the New World. Richard&#x27;s only option to stop the invasion is to claim his heritage and unite all free kingdoms and provinces under one rule and one command.

==Plot summary==
The story begins at the Palace of the Prophets where a funeral is being held for Nathan and Ann. Sister Verna and Warren, now freed from Rada&#x27;Han, are traveling with Richard to break down the barrier between the New and the Old World. Upon returning from the funeral, Sister Verna discovers that the ring of the Prelate is at the center of the large room, wrapped in a spell that does not allow any sister to retrieve it. The sisters invite Verna to make an attempt and she succeeds, becoming Ann&#x27;s successor. Incredulous, Verna confides to Warren that she does not know what to do about the presence in the Palace of the Sisters of the Dark.

In the meantime, Richard suffers an attack by mriswiths at Aydindril but is saved by Gratch, who can sense the presence of the creatures. Realizing that they need allies, Richard decides to go to the embassy of D&#x27;Hara to claim the loyalty of the troops as the new Lord Rahl. On the way into town he gives a silver coin with the symbol of the Palace of the Prophets to a little girl who, with her grandmother, sells cakes with honey and is recognized by them as the Seeker. They promise not to reveal his identity. Shortly afterwards, Richard clashes with Blood of the Fold member Galtero, and is saved thanks to the intervention of four Mord-Sith: Cara, Raina, Berdine and Hally, and two personal guards of the Master Rahl, Ulic and Egan, who swear allegiance to him. Richard also learns from them the nature of the special bond that exists between Lord Rahl and all the D&#x27;Haran: a spell cast almost three thousand years ago by an ancestor of Richard, which involves a pact where the D&#x27;Haran protect Lord Rahl by force of arms and in return Lord Rahl protects all his subjects with the power of magic. The only requirement for the bond to work is that the D&#x27;Harans recognize the legitimacy of the title of Lord Rahl. Richard and his escort go to General Reibisch, the man in charge of the D&#x27;Haran army in Aydindril, in an effort to gain their loyalty. They succeed only through an attack of mriswith who burst into the room killing the Mord-Sith Hally, and several soldiers, which gives Richard the opportunity to kill the mriswith by dancing with the spirits, which convinces the D&#x27;Harans he is the real Lord Rahl. The general recognizes the authority of Lord Rahl, thus giving Richard control of the army.

At the Nicobarese&#x27;s Palace in Aydindril, Lord General Tobias Brogan, assisted by his sister Lunetta, who through her gift is able to identify lies, investigates the death of the Mother Confessor. Among the ones being questioned is Sanderholt, the cook of the Confessors&#x27; Palace, whose lies are discovered by Lunetta who figures out that Kahlan is still alive. They also question the old lady and the little girl that Richard had previously bought cupcakes from, who demonstrate a knowledge of magic greater than expected. The old woman suggests that the Mother Confessor is alive and protected by a spell and she gives Brogan the money received from Richard telling him that in the city there is a magician powerful enough to cast a spell of that type. Brogan gives orders to his subordinates to question the two by all means to prove that they are servants of the Keeper. He then decides to go immediately in search of the Mother Confessor to kill her but is stopped by the words of his sister who explains that the spell that protects Kahlan probably makes sure that the Seeker can not recognize her. While deciding what to do, Brogan is summoned to the Confessors&#x27; Palace by the new Lord Rahl, along with all delegations in the Midlands. 

While waiting for Richard to start his speech, Duchess Lumholtz introduces herself to Tobias Brogan. She tries to spark a conversation and ingratiate herself but Tobias does not engage with her. She persists in trying to converse with him until Tobias mockingly dismisses her for being too talkative. 

At the Confessors&#x27; Palace, Richard dissolves the Midlands giving everyone an ultimatum: either unite under D&#x27;Haran Empire willingly or be conquered. His words anger Duke and Duchess Lumholtz. Richard also announces that Galea has already joined the D&#x27;Haran Empire and he&#x27;s going to marry their new queen, after which the assembly is dissolved with the caveat that none of the dignitaries will leave Aydindril until they surrender to D&#x27;Hara. Richard speaks to Brogan and his sister and demands they stop their interrogations that take place in the palace of the Nicobarese. Richard reiterates that the Mother Confessor is dead and emphasizes the fact that Nicobarese would do well to join D&#x27;Hara. Brogan gives his knife as a sign of confidence in Richard and asks for a silver coin in exchange. At the end of the meeting Richard sends Gratch to give a letter to Kahlan, describing his resolutions to dissolve the Midlands.

At the Palace of the Prophets, Verna and Warren go to visit sister Simona, a sister of the Light confined in the infirmary because she is considered crazy. She discovers that the Emperor Jagang, who is coming to visit in Tanimura, is the one in the ancient prophecies called the dreamwalker. She also realizes that there are many discrepancies in the circumstances that led to the death of Annalina and the Prophet Nathan. She decides to investigate.

Just out of the assembly, Tobias Brogan uses his sister to cast a circle spell on the Duke and Duchess Lumholtz, which would make them walk around a midden heap near the city. Brogan, Galtero and Lunetta wait by the midden heap until the couple shows up. Brogan greets the duchess warmly, wishing her a good evening but she ignores his greeting and walks right past him.

They wait until the duke and duchess show up again. This time, the duchess reacts with shock and asks Brogan to stop following her. She gets upset and closes her coat when she notices Galtero staring at her cleavage. The duke threatens to kill Galtero if he stares at his wife. Galtero just smiles without responding to the man. 

The third time the noble couple shows up, Duchess Lumholtz gets angry and insults Brogan. He snatches the lace at the bosom of her dress and rips open her dress down to her waist, exposing her breasts. Galtero pins her arms behind her back and forces her to arch her back. The duke tries to draw his sword but is frozen in place by Lunetta&#x27;s magic. The duchess&#x27;s nipples stand out stiff in the cold.

Brogan grabs the woman&#x27;s left nipple, stretches it and cuts it off to give it to Lunetta, who uses it to cast a spell upon the young woman, making her obey Brogan. Under Brogan&#x27;s orders, Lunetta heals Duchess Lumholtz left breast, leaving it without a nipple. Brogan then gives Duchess Lumholtz to Galtero, who rapes the woman on top of the midden. Brogan then kills the Duke and makes it look like a mriswith did it. After Galtero finishes raping the Duchess, Lunetta weaves another spell on her using the coin Richard gave, making her irresistible to Richard. Brogan also has the Duchess paint herself a nipple where her real one is missing. 

Brogan decides to run away from Aydindril to pursue the Mother Confessor because he sensed that she hides under the identity of the queen of Galea. He returns to the palace and discovers that the soldier to whom he had given orders to torture the old lady is dead and that she and the girl have fled. Brogan and Lunetta prepare to flee to chase the Mother Confessor but are attacked by D&#x27;Haran soldiers guarding the palace. They are rescued by the mriswith, who kill the soldiers. Galtero knocks down the Mord-Sith Berdine and Lunetta then casts the same spell on Berdine as she cast upon Duchess Lumholtz, binding her to Brogan&#x27;s will as well.

Berdine then presents Duchess Lumholtz to Richard. He is so attracted to her that he doubts control of his own actions and agrees to let her stay in the palace as a guest and to protect her from the mriswith if she will surrender Kelton.

Meanwhile, Warren discovers that he is a prophet, and when pronounces his first prophecy, in which he speaks of a &quot;false prelate&quot; and the &quot;end the Palace of the Prophets.&quot; Together, Verna and Warren decide to find out why gravediggers were hired at the Palace of the Prophets.

Richard, now under the spell surrounding the Duchess Cathryn Lumholtz, is able to organize and carry out the public ceremony in which Kelton surrenders totally to D&#x27;Hara.

Ulicia and five other Sisters of the Dark arrive at the residence of Emperor Jagang where they discover that a large number of Sisters of Light and Dark are Jagang&#x27;s and that he has bent them to his will using his dreamwalking. Ulicia and the five sisters unite their Han to destroy him. The Emperor effortlessly defends against the Sisters&#x27; attack because he has already made them into slaves, promising them agony if they use magic without his direct order. He then hands the sisters over to a bunch of sailors to rape, save for Merissa who he keeps as his new favorite after he kills Christabel as an example.

At the Confessors&#x27; Palace, Richard manages to retire to his room for the night in an attempt to escape the tempting Duchess Lumholtz. Soon after she enters his room eager to have sex with him, Richard realizes that something is wrong and uses his magic to see the nature of the spell cast on the Duchess. He realizes that she is about to stab him and barely manages to escape the attack. A mriswith enters the room and cuts Cathryn in half, telling Richard that he came to save him because he is a &quot;skin brother.&quot; Baffled, Richard observes that there is something strange about Cathryn&#x27;s left breast. He licks his finger and erases the paint, making him realize that the nipple was missing. He senses that this is tied to the spell that changed the behavior of the now dead Duchess. He has Egin roll up Cathryn&#x27;s corpse in a carpet and take it away. Lord Rahl calls the three Mord-Sith and orders them to take their tops off. This reveals that Berdine, the Mord-Sith who threatened him with Agiel the previous day, has the same mutilation. Trying to save Berdine, Richard lets her hit him with the Agiel in order to prove that the magical link with the House of Rahl is the most powerful spell. Because the magical bond with Lord Rahl prevents Berdine from killing Richard if he does not try to defend himself, the woman is eventually destroyed by the pain of magic and begs Richard to kill her. Instead he saves her which erases the possession spell. Stunned by Richard&#x27;s altruistic behavior, the three Mord-Sith swear their loyalty again.

At Aydindril, Richard and Berdine enter the Wizard&#x27;s Keep to search for anything that can help defeat the dreamwalker. Following the directions of a mriswith, they arrive in a room in which they find the mummified body of a magician and a diary. The two take the diary and return to the Confessors&#x27; Palace.

The Prelate Verna wakes up in a cell and learns from Sister Leoma that her imprisonment has a specific purpose: Emperor Jagang wants to find out if it is possible to break the magical bond that protects those who are faithful to the Lord Rahl. Sister Leoma has been authorized to torture Verna through the Rada-Han and to use her as a guinea pig.

Richard gets a visit from the commander-in-chief of the Kelton army who says he is very concerned about the fate of his country because the death of the Duchess Lumholtz could cause a bloody war of succession. The general asks Richard to appoint a king for the Keltons and he responds by choosing Kahlan as Queen of Kelton. To the astonishment of Richard, the general and the Mord-Sith knows that Kahlan is the Mother Confessor. Richard then realizes that the spell that protected Kahlan has dissolved. He decides to send his soldiers to look for her.

Kahlan and Adie are then taken to the Palace of the Prophets and locked in a room to await the arrival of Jagang. Meanwhile, Brogan begins to suspect that what is happening to the Palace of the Prophets does not follow the will of the Creator and he begins showing signs of mental imbalance.

<text>Temple of the Winds is the fourth book in Terry Goodkind&#x27;s epic fantasy series &quot;The Sword of Truth.&quot;

==Plot introduction==
Jagang, Emperor of the Imperial Order, has invoked a bound fork prophecy binding Richard and Kahlan to a fate of pain, betrayal, and a path to the Underworld. At Jagang&#x27;s behest a Sister of the Dark gains access into the fabled Temple of the Winds and has unleashed a plague that sweeps across the lands like a firestorm consuming lives at an alarming rate. To stop the plague Richard and Kahlan are forced to sacrifice everything they have between them.

==Plot summary==

&quot;Temple of the Winds&quot; picks up shortly where the last volume, &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot;, left off. A wizard named Marlin appears in Aydindril announcing his intent to kill Richard Rahl. He is immediately captured and questioned by the Mother Confessor, Kahlan Amnell, and one of Richard&#x27;s bodyguards, Cara. Cara uses her Mord&#x27;Sith ability to capture Marlin&#x27;s gift when he tries to escape, but the link between Cara and Marlin is used against her when Emperor Jagang takes possession of Marlin soon thereafter. A lady named Nadine, whom Richard had known as an herbalist from the Westland, arrives and attempts to heal Cara, but fails. Richard&#x27;s half-brother Drefan, a self-proclaimed high priest of a sect of healers, does, however, succeed in curing Cara with acupressure. Kahlan learns that Nadine and Richard had been close, but that Nadine had pursued Richard&#x27;s brother in a baffling attempt to seduce Richard.

Meanwhile, Zedd and Prelate Annalina continue their search for the unleashed Nathan Rahl. Their search leads them to a run down inn in an unnamed city, where they discover that Nathan misled them into following another man. The man then gives them a message informing them not to follow Nathan but to protect a treasure instead. A Sister of the Dark, who was also following Nathan, ends up getting caught in a snare Zedd intended for the Prophet Rahl. Meanwhile, Nathan rescues a woman named Clarissa from a life of slavery in the Imperial Order. He then builds a relationship with the woman and uses her to obtain items from Jagang that were given under a tentative deal struck between Nathan (acting as Lord Rahl at the time) and the Emperor.

Richard and Berdine continue to work on the translation of the &#x27;Journal of Kolo&#x27;. In the midst of all these activities, a Sister of the Dark travels through Aydindril spreading a magical plague. In a search for a cure, Richard travels to the First Wizard&#x27;s Enclave. To save the people of the Midlands from the plague, Kahlan is told again and again by prophecy and the ancestor spirits of the Mud People that she must betray Richard to allow him to enter the Temple of the Winds, and that Richard must marry Nadine, or everyone in the New World will die of the plague. Even confronting the witch Shota, who sent Nadine to the Palace, Shota says that it was out of pity for Richard, that Nadine was the only other woman he ever even remotely cared for, and that the prophecy is unstoppable.

Eventually, a form of messenger from the Temple arrives and Cara steals his gift and the message, stating that Richard must marry Nadine and Kahlan must marry Drefan, and that the marriage must be immediately consummated, and in total silence. Utterly crushed at the loss of Richard, and wanting any form of comfort, Kahlan gives in, believing she is with Drefan. However, as lightning starts to crash all around, she sees it&#x27;s Richard. Cara had swapped them in the dark of the corridors leading to the Temple. In the distance, Drefan throws Nadine from the cliffs as he had planned to do with Kahlan all along. Richard, feeling betrayed by Kahlan&#x27;s apparent throes of passion with Drefan, is able to enter the Temple. Inside, he easily cures the plague and performs several other magical spells that used to be totally beyond him. He is then visited by the spirit of Kahlan&#x27;s mother, who gently tries to explain the crushing loneliness of a Confessor&#x27;s life, and Richard is eventually moved to return to the real world. The spirit of Darken Rahl appears and sets conditions for his release: he must give up the knowledge of the Temple of the Winds, and is infected with the plague.

When Richard returns, Kahlan learns from writing on Richard&#x27;s hands and arms that she must destroy a book in order to save Richard, so she travels to the Old World in the sliph. Upon her arrival, she finds Nathan, Sister Verna, and Warren in a compromised situation, and she immediately spring into action to aid them. Clarissa is killed in the struggle by traitors.

Kahlan returns to Aydindril with the book, but is attacked by Drefan. Instead Richard, nearly dead from the plague, manages to subdue Drefan, who is then killed by the sliph. Kahlan destroys the book, recites the names of the three chimes, and Richard is cured of the plague.

In the epilogue, members of Drefan&#x27;s sect come to see Richard looking for him. They tell him that Drefan was seriously disturbed, having taken to murdering prostitutes who reminded him of his mother. Richard and Kahlan travel to the land of the Mud People to be wed, where they meet up with Zedd and Ann. Richard and Kahlan are soon thereafter wed and are visited by the witch woman Shota, who once again warns them not to conceive a child.

==Wizard&#x27;s Fourth Rule==

It is explained in the novel as follows: &quot;Forgiving and being forgiven are powerful elements of healing for the soul. Forgiving others grants by the giving of forgiveness but more so one receives self healing by the necessity of letting go of bitterness through forgiveness of others.&quot;

<text>Soul of the Fire is the fifth book in Terry Goodkind&#x27;s epic fantasy series &quot;The Sword of Truth.&quot;

==Plot introduction==
Richard and Kahlan are finally married and are enjoying their wedding night back in the Spirit house in the Village of the Mud People. Soon, sudden and unexplainable deaths begin to occur, and Richard comes to the conclusion that when Kahlan called forth &quot;the chimes&quot; in order to save him, they remained free, causing havoc. Zedd sends Richard and Kahlan off to the Wizard&#x27;s Keep in Aydindril to get a special bottle that contains a spell that will stop the threat.

While en route, Richard, Kahlan, and their Mord-Sith protector Cara are sidetracked into dealing with the people of Anderith, who have a powerful weapon of mass destruction called the Dominie Dirtch. They find that the leadership of Anderith wishes to surrender to the Imperial Order rather than surrender to the D&#x27;Haran Empire. As Richard tries his best to convince the people of Anderith of the danger the Imperial Order poses, he becomes firmly convinced that the chimes are loose.

==Plot summary==
Continuing on from &quot;Temple of the Winds,&quot; the story begins after Richard and Kahlan&#x27;s wedding in the village of the Mud People. Strange deaths and the appearance of a &#x27;chicken-that-isn&#x27;t-a-chicken&#x27; leaves Richard fearing the worst. Zedd confides in Richard that the chicken is a Lurk sent by Emperor Jagang&#x27;s Sisters of the Dark. According to Zedd, the only way to destroy the Lurk is by smashing a bottle from the Wizard&#x27;s Keep in Aydindril with the Sword of Truth.

However, Zedd is actually lying. He has surmised that a terrible magic known as &quot;the chimes&quot; has been accidentally released by Kahlan in her attempt to cure Richard. The chimes will eventually drain all magic from the world of the living, beginning with the additive magic. This would cause death to beings that require magic and possibly cause the destruction of the world if additive magic were to completely fail. Zedd determines that he must find a remedy, and wants Richard and Kahlan safely out of the way while he does so.

Richard, Kahlan and Cara, unaware of the truth, set out to accomplish the task of breaking the bottle. Meanwhile, Zedd and Ann set off in separate ways. Zedd recalls some lore that relates the chimes to Anderith and he travels there to attempt to banish the chimes. Ann infiltrates the Imperial Order in order to save the Sisters of the Light under Jagang&#x27;s enslavement. However, the Sisters of the Light betray Ann to Jagang because they fear the wrath of Emperor Jagang, causing Ann to be captured.

Elsewhere, there are Machiavellian politics of Anderith to worry about. Both the Anders, black-haired people who govern the city, and the Hakens, red-haired people under the boot of Ander oppression, occupy Anderith. From an early age, Hakens are kept under control and disrespected by the Anders and are taught that this oppression is a necessity to protect the Hakens from their violent ancestral ways. Most Hakens have bought into this idea and willingly subject themselves to the oppression.

Anderith is being wooed by the Imperial Order in the person of Stein, who personifies the savage ruthlessness of Jagang&#x27;s empire. Stein offers double the going rate for any goods that merchants, all of the Ander race, will sell to the Imperial Order. He also plots with the Minister of Culture, Bertrand Chanboor, to surrender Anderith to the Order. They begin infiltrating Imperial Order soldiers into Anderith under the guise of Special Anderian Troops.

Dalton Campbell, aide to the Minister of Culture, has a hand in most events within the Anderith nation. He uses his connections, along with his squad of messengers, to accomplish underhanded tasks to ensure that the Minister will ascend to the chair of Sovereign (a religious position similar to the real world pope) when the present one passes on. Dalton treasures his wife Teresa above all else.

A kitchen scullion, Fitch, is recruited into the messenger corps by Dalton. Though he has conflicting goals and values, Fitch&#x27;s gratitude towards Dalton results in blind obedience and he smothers his conscience to accomplish Dalton&#x27;s bidding. Ultimately, Dalton betrays Fitch, who is forced to flee. Fitch determines to redeem himself by becoming the Seeker of Truth, a longtime fantasy of his. The first step to becoming Seeker is to obtain the Sword of Truth.

The Anderith Army is seriously under-trained and little more than children. They guard the Dominie Dirtch, a defensive line of giant bell-shaped structures, seemingly made from a solid piece of dark-veined stone, which kill anything in front of them when struck.

Elsewhere, Richard realizes the chimes are, in fact, loose. Because of this, he sends Cara to Aydindril to retrieve the Sword of Truth while he, Kahlan and Du Chaillu, about to deliver her child, head to Anderith to banish the chimes. Richard also deduces that the army of the Imperial Order is marching on Anderith. If the Imperial Order conquers Anderith, it will be a continuing imminent threat to the rest of the Midlands. Arriving in Anderith first, Zedd attempts to banish the chimes by offering them his soul. This is the cause of the chimes&#x27; presence: they don&#x27;t have souls, and when Kahlan summoned them she inadvertently promised them Richard&#x27;s soul. However, it is not Zedd&#x27;s soul the chimes want. When Zedd&#x27;s attempt fails, he undergoes a transformation, becoming a raven.

Richard and Kahlan arrive in Anderith and set out to look for the chimes, but they also work on joining Anderith with the D&#x27;Haran Empire. Word spreads and a vote is taken. While Richard makes a good plea to the people of Anderith, Dalton Campbell&#x27;s interference sways the vote, leaving Richard defeated. At the same time, Kahlan struggles with the knowledge that she is with child, and the trouble that will come because of it.

Meanwhile, Ann finds the captive Sisters of the Light and persuades them to come with her. Since magic is failing, Jagang&#x27;s abilities as a Dream Walker are null, and Ann informs the Sisters of a bond to Richard, the Lord Rahl, that can keep them safe from the Dream Walker. However, the Sisters, fearful of retribution by Jagang, betray Ann to the Imperial Order. She is left in her tent by herself when Sister Alessandra, a Sister of the Dark, begins visiting her and bringing her food. She attempts to sway Alessandra, at first to no avail but with success in the end.

Dalton Campbell, along with help from a Sister of the Dark, sets a group of his messengers on Kahlan when she is off by herself pondering on whether or not to keep Richard&#x27;s child. She is beaten nearly to death, but she is saved by Richard, who at first doesn&#x27;t recognize her. When he finally does, however, he realizes that he will be unable to heal her unless he manages to banish the chimes first.

Cara almost obtains the Sword of Truth, but is beaten to it by Fitch and his friend, Morley. A combination of sheer dumb luck and the fact that the Chimes have deactivated the Wizards&#x27; Keep defenses and killed many of its guards allow Fitch and his accomplice to easily obtain the Sword. Cara gives chase and kills the friend before chasing Fitch back to Anderith. When she catches him at the Dominie Dirtch, she loses the sword when Imperial Order scouts attack. The Order&#x27;s soldiers collect the sword as a prize for Stein to present to Emperor Jagang.

Around this time, Dalton Campbell manages to murder the Sovereign, instead of waiting for the feeble figurehead to pass naturally. This immediately pushes Bertrand Chanboor to the rank of Sovereign. The empowered Chanboor consummates his promotion by sleeping with Dalton&#x27;s wife, Teresa. Dalton pretends not to be disturbed by this betrayal and even seemingly &quot;joins&quot; the web of infidelity by sleeping with both Teresa and Chanboor&#x27;s wife in turn, intentionally having contracted a lethal STD first. Campbell finalizes his revenge by killing the Imperial Order emissary, Stein (who had &quot;shared&quot; Teresa with Chanboor), gaining possession of the Sword of Truth in turn.

Having studied the actions of Joseph Ander, the ancient founder of Anderith, Richard comes to realize that the chimes and the Dominie Dirtch are connected. More specifically, he comes to understand that Joseph Ander enslaved the Chimes using them to power the Dominie Dirtch. Richard finally comes to understand that by using art as a form of intent, he can alter the Grace and create a new pathway for magic. Thus Richard counters the magic Ander used to enslave the Chimes and calls them forth giving the chimes a choice: His soul (which they were promised by Kahlan) or revenge on the spirit of Ander for enslaving them. The chimes choose vengeance, taking Ander to the underworld. Once he is successful in banishing the chimes, Richard sets off to heal Kahlan but is stopped by Du Chaillu, just having given birth, who tells him that his healing powers would kill her due to a hidden subtractive magic spell that has been placed within her.

Alessandra eventually frees Ann, reverts her faith back to the Creator and gives her oath to Richard. The pair soon sets off out of Anderith. When Zedd&#x27;s soul is returned to his body with the banishment of the chimes, he also departs. Richard decides to leave for Westland, where he plans to let Kahlan recover from her wounds naturally. Dalton Campbell sees them off with his apologies and informs Richard that Campbell, Chanboor, and both of their wives have become stricken with an &quot;unfortunate&quot;, incurable venereal disease and have doomed themselves to a slow, agonizing demise. He returns the Sword of Truth to Richard before they set off. Richard claims he will wait in Westland until the people of the world can prove to him that they truly desire freedom. As they depart, they pass a group of people set to welcome the Order, planning to sway them with peaceful protest. As they leave, the Order begins to sack the city, and the screams of the women being forced into sexual slavery follow them into the night.

<text>Gnaeus Julius Verus was Roman senator and general of the mid-2nd century AD. He was suffect consul, and governed several important imperial provinces: Germania Inferior, Britain, and Syria.

== Life ==
Verus came from Aequum in Dalmatia; this has led some experts (such as Géza Alföldy. Anthony Birley, and Werner Eck) to believe he was the son of Sextus Julius Severus (consul 127), but other experts assert Julius Severus was his uncle. He served as tribune in the legio X Fretensis when Julius Severus was governor of Judaea from 132 to 135. That Verus served as a &quot;tresvir monetalis&quot;, then &quot;quaestor Augusti&quot;, and was co-opted as an augur; all suggesting that he was marked out at an early stage for a prominent career.

Following his achievement as praetor, Verus was &quot;legatus legionis&quot; or commander of Legio XXX &quot;Ulpia Victrix&quot; in the 140s, which was stationed at Xanten then part of Germania Inferior. He returned to Rome to serve as prefect of the &quot;aerarium Saturni&quot;; Mireille Corbier dates his tenure from January 147 to the end of 149, which would make him the colleague of Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus (suffect consul 152). Verus was suffect consul at some point in the years 149 to 151.

The first consular office Verus held was as governor of Germania Inferior, possibly arriving there in 154. Birley notes that &quot;Verus&#x27; dispatch to govern a province where he had commanded a legion a decade or so earlier is relatively unusual.&quot;

An inscription from Birrens, north of the western end of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, shows that Verus was present in Britain as governor in 158, but he likely was present in the province before then. His dispatch to Britain with troops from Germany was probably meant to put down a revolt there, or at least to reinforce the remnants of the troops who had done so. The revolt had been led by the Brigantes tribe and had resulted in the abandonment of the Antonine Wall and a possible slaughter at the fort at Newstead.

It is not clear when Verus left Britain. Details on his successor are few. Verus is known to have accompanied Lucius Verus east in his campaign against the Parthians in 162, and a mile post in Syria dated to 163 shows he succeeded Marcus Annius Libo as governor upon the latter&#x27;s death. In Syria, he instructed road improvements along the gorge of the Barada River, as documented by inscriptions from Abila Lysaniou. 

His offices after he left Syria are not known. Dąbrowa notes Verus &quot;was an experienced man who had good relationship with the emperors.&quot; Birley admits it is possible he was proconsular governor of Africa 20 years after his consulship, since the plague of 166 had slain so many qualified men. Verus was nominated for a second consulship in 180, but he died in 179.

<doc id="1194755" wikidata="Q4728804" url="?curid=1194755" title="All Hallows Staining">
<text>All Hallows Staining was a Church of England church located at the junction of Mark Lane and Dunster Court in the north-eastern corner of Langbourn ward in the City of London, England, close to Fenchurch Street railway station. All that remains of the church is the tower, built around AD 1320 as part of the second church on the site. Use of the grounds around the church is the subject of the Allhallows Staining Church Act 2010 (c. v).

==History==
The first mention of the church was in the late 12th century. It was named &quot;Staining&quot;, which means stone, to distinguish it from the other churches of All Hallows in the City of London, which were wooden.

The old church survived the Great Fire of London in 1666 but collapsed five years later in 1671. It was thought its foundations had been weakened by too many burials in the churchyard close to the church walls. The church was rebuilt in 1674.
The parishes of All Hallows Staining and nearby St Olave Hart Street were combined in 1870. At that time All Hallows Staining was demolished, leaving only the tower. The proceeds from the demolition funded the construction of a new church in East End of London, All Hallows, Bow.

During the Second World War in 1941, St Olave Hart Street was badly damaged by bombs. Between 1948 and 1954, when the restored St Olave&#x27;s was reopened, a prefabricated church stood on the site of All Hallows Staining. This was known as St Olave Mark Lane. The tower of All Hallows Staining was used as the chancel of the temporary church.

The tower is maintained by the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers, one of the livery companies of the City of London. In 1957 the Clothworkers&#x27; Company built a church hall for St Olave Hart Street on the site of All Hallows Staining. The old tower now stands at the back of a small courtyard next to the new hall; and the remains of the church were designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

The remains of &#x27;Lambe&#x27;s Chapel Crypt&#x27;, lies under the adjacent yard. It was moved from the site of Lambe&#x27;s Chapel in Monkswell Street and rebuilt here in the mid–12th century. It was said to have formed part of the &#x27;Hermitage of St James on the Wall&#x27;. These remains were designated Grade II at the same time as the main tower. William Lambe became a master of the Clothworkers.

===Contemporary description===

At the North Corner of this Street, on the same side, was sometime an Hermitage or Chappel of St. James, called In the Wall, near Cripplegate. It belonged to the Abbey and Covent of Garadon, as appeareth by a Record, the Seven and twentieth of Edward I. And also by a Record the 16 of Edward III. William de Lions was Hermit there; and the Abbot and Covent of Geredon found two Chaplains, Cestercian Monks of their House, in this Hermitage: one of them for Aymor de Valence, Earl of Pembrook; and Mary de Saint Paul, his Countess.Of these Monks, and of a Well pertaining to them, the Street took that Name, and is called Monks Well street. This Hermitage, with the Appurtenances, was in the Reign of Edward VI. purchased from the said King, by William Lambe, one of the Gentlemen of the King&#x27;s Chappel, Citizen and Clothworker of London. He deceased in the Year 1577. and then gave it to the Clothworkers of London; with other Tenements, to the value of Fifty Pounds the Year; to the intent they shall hire a Minister to say Divine Service there.&quot; from &quot;Faringdon Ward within. [St. Nicolas.]&quot;

<text>&quot;There are unknown unknowns&quot; is a phrase from a response United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld gave to a question at a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) news briefing on February 12, 2002, about the lack of evidence linking the government of Iraq with the supply of weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups. Rumsfeld stated:
The statement became the subject of much commentary. In &quot;The Decision Book&quot; (2013), author refers to it as the &quot;Rumsfeld matrix&quot;. The statement also features in a 2013 documentary film, &quot;The Unknown Known&quot;, directed by Errol Morris.

Known unknowns refers to &quot;risks you are aware of, such as canceled flights&quot;, whereas unknown unknowns are risks that come from situations that are so unexpected that they would not be considered.

With respect to awareness and understanding, unknown unknowns can be compared to other types of problems in the following matrix:

Rumsfeld&#x27;s statement brought attention to the concepts of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns, but national security and intelligence professionals have long used an analysis technique referred to as the Johari window. The idea of unknown unknowns was created in 1955 by two American psychologists, Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham in their development of the Johari window. They used it as a technique to help people better understand their relationship with themselves as well as others.

The term was also commonly used inside NASA. Rumsfeld cited NASA administrator William Graham in his memoir; he wrote that he had first heard &quot;a variant of the phrase&quot; from Graham when they served together on the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States during the late 1990s. Kirk Borne, an astrophysicist who was employed as a data scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at the time, said in an April 2013 TED talk that he had used the phrase &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; in a talk to personnel at the Homeland Security Transition Planning Office a few days prior to Rumsfeld&#x27;s remarks, and speculated that the term may have percolated up to Rumsfeld and other high-ranking officials in the Defense Department.

The terms &quot;known unknowns&quot; and &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; are often used in project management and strategic planning circles.

Contemporary usage is largely consistent with the earliest known usages. For example, the term was used in evidence given to the British Columbia Royal Commission of Inquiry into Uranium Mining in 1979:

The term also appeared in a 1982 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article on the aerospace industry, which cites the example of metal fatigue, the cause of crashes in de Havilland Comet airliners in the 1950s.

==Reaction==

Canadian columnist Mark Steyn called it &quot;in fact a brilliant distillation of quite a complex matter&quot;. Australian economist and blogger John Quiggin wrote: &quot;Although the language may be tortured, the basic point is both valid and important.&quot;

Psychoanalytic philosopher Slavoj Žižek says that beyond these three categories there is a fourth, the unknown known, that which one intentionally refuses to acknowledge that one knows: &quot;If Rumsfeld thinks that the main dangers in the confrontation with Iraq were the &#x27;unknown unknowns&#x27;, that is, the threats from Saddam whose nature we cannot even suspect, then the Abu Ghraib scandal shows that the main dangers lie in the &quot;unknown knowns&quot;—the disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background of our public values.&quot;

German sociologists Christopher Daase and Oliver Kessler agreed that the cognitive frame for political practice may be determined by the relationship between &quot;what we know, what we do not know, what we cannot know&quot;, but stated that Rumsfeld left out &quot;what we do not like to know&quot;.

The event has been used in multiple books to discuss risk assessment.

Rumsfeld named his 2011 autobiography &quot;Known and Unknown: A Memoir&quot;. In the author&#x27;s note at the start of the book, he expressly acknowledges the source of his memoir&#x27;s title and mentions a few examples of his statement&#x27;s prominence. &quot;The Unknown Known&quot; is the title of Errol Morris&#x27;s 2013 biographical documentary film about Rumsfeld. In it, Rumsfeld initially defines &quot;unknown knowns&quot; as &quot;the things you think you know, that it turns out you did not&quot;, and toward the end of the film he defines the term as &quot;things that you know, that you don&#x27;t know you know&quot;.

Rumsfeld&#x27;s comment earned the 2003 Foot in Mouth Award from the British Plain English Campaign.

==Analytical sciences==
The term &quot;known unknowns&quot; has been applied to the identification of chemical substances using analytical chemistry approaches, specifically mass spectrometry. In many cases, an unknown to an investigator that is detected in an experiment is actually known in the chemical literature, a reference database, or an Internet resource. These types of compounds are termed &quot;known unknowns&quot;. The term was originally coined by Little et al. and reported a number of times in the literature since then as a general approach.

<text>Spiru C. Haret (; 15 February 1851 – 17 December 1912) was a Romanian mathematician, astronomer, and politician. He made a fundamental contribution to the &quot;n&quot;-body problem in celestial mechanics by proving that using a third degree approximation for the disturbing forces implies instability of the major axes of the orbits, and by introducing the concept of &quot;secular perturbations&quot; in relation to this.

As a politician, during his three terms as Minister of Education, Haret ran deep reforms, building the modern Romanian education system. He was made a full member of the Romanian Academy in 1892.

He also founded the Bucharest Astronomical Observatory, appointing as its first director. The crater Haret on the Moon is named after him.

==Life==
Haret was born in Iași, Moldavia, to Constantin and Smaranda Haret, who were of Armenian origin. His baptismal record listed his name as Spiridon Haret. He started his studies in Dorohoi Iași, and in 1862 moved to Saint Sava High School in Bucharest. He showed an early talent for mathematics, publishing two textbooks (one in algebra and one in trigonometry) when he was still a high school student. In 1869 he entered the University of Bucharest, where he studied physics and mathematics. In 1870, while a student in his second term, he became teacher of mathematics at the Nifon Seminary in Bucharest, but quit the following year in order to continue his studies. In 1874, at age 23, he graduated with a degree in physics and mathematics.

After graduation, Haret won a scholarship competition organized by Titu Maiorescu and went to Paris in order to study mathematics at the Sorbonne. There he earned a mathematics diploma in 1875 and a physics diploma in 1876. Two years later (on 18 January 1878), he earned his Ph.D. by defending his thesis, &quot;Sur l’invariabilité des grandes axes des orbites planétaires&quot; (&quot;On the invariability of the major axis of planetary orbits&quot;), in front of examiners led by Victor Puiseux, his Ph.D. advisor. In this work he proved a result fundamental for the &quot;n&quot;-body problem in astronomy, the thesis being published in volume 18 of &quot;Annales de l&#x27;Observatoire de Paris&quot;. Haret was the first Romanian to obtain a Ph.D. degree in Paris.

After his return to Romania in 1878, Haret largely abandoned scientific research and dedicated the rest of his life to improving Romanian education, which was heavily underdeveloped at the time, both as professor and as politician. He was appointed professor of rational mechanics at the Faculty of Science of the University of Bucharest. The next year (1879), Haret became a correspondent member of the Romanian Academy, receiving full membership in 1892. He kept the professorship at the Faculty of Science until his retirement in 1910, when he was followed as professor of mechanics by Dimitrie Pompeiu. From 1882 he was also a professor of analytical geometry at the School of Bridges and Roads in Bucharest. After retirement, Haret occasionally lectured at the informal &quot;People&#x27;s University&quot;.

Haret was the Minister of Public Education in three liberal governments, between 1897 and 1899, 1901–1904, and 1907–1910. As Minister of Education he ran a complete reform, basically building the modern Romanian education system.

The folk song &quot;Cântă cucu-n Bucovina&quot; (&quot;Sings the Cuckoo in Bukovina&quot;) was composed in 1904 by at Haret&#x27;s request for commemorating the 400th anniversary of the death of Prince of Moldavia Stephen the Great.

In January 1883, he married in Buzău a local, Ana Popescu, 15 years his junior. The two had a son, Ion, who died at age 1, and later adopted a child, Mihai. Haret died in Bucharest in 1912 of cancer, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Bellu Cemetery; Ana Haret died in 1941, aged 74.

==Scientific activity==
Haret&#x27;s major scientific contribution was made in 1878, in his Ph.D. thesis &quot;Sur l’invariabilité des grandes axes des orbites planétaires&quot;. At the time it was known that planets disturb each other&#x27;s orbits, thus deviating from the elliptic motion described by Johannes Kepler’s First Law. Pierre Laplace (in 1773) and Joseph Louis Lagrange (in 1776) had already studied the problem, both of them showing that the major axes of the orbits are stable, by using a first degree approximation of the perturbing forces. In 1808 Siméon Denis Poisson had proved that the stability also holds when using second degree approximations. In his thesis, Haret proved by using third degree approximations that the axes are not stable as previously believed, but instead feature a time variability, which he called &quot;secular perturbations&quot;. This result implies that planetary motion is not absolutely stable. Henri Poincaré considered this result &quot;a great surprise&quot; and continued Haret’s research, which eventually led him to the creation of chaos theory. Haret established the instability of the model of the &quot;n&quot;-body problem assuming frequencies to be incommensurable; Poincaré also took into account commensurabilities, and using generalized Fourier series (which generate quasi-periodic solutions), he proved the divergence of these series (which means instability), thus confirming Haret’s result. Félix Tisserand recommended the extension of Haret&#x27;s method to other astronomic problems and, much later, in 1955, Jean Meffroy restarted Haret’s research using new techniques.

Soon after his return to Romania, Haret abandoned research, focusing for the rest of his life on teaching and, as Minister of Education, on the reform of the education system. He only published an article on the secular acceleration of the Moon in 1880 and one on Jupiter’s Great Red Spot (1912).
In 1910 he published &quot;Social mechanics&quot;, which used mathematics to explain social behaviour (somehow anticipating the fictional &quot;psychohistory&quot; branch of mathematics developed by Hari Seldon, the fictional character of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot;, published 40 years later).

<text>During the 2004 United States elections, there was controversy around various aspects of the voting process, including whether voting had been made accessible to all those entitled to vote, whether ineligible voters were registered, whether voters were registered multiple times, and whether the votes cast had been correctly counted.

There was generally less attention paid to the Senate and House elections and to various state races, but some of them were also questioned, especially the gubernatorial election in Washington, which was decided by less than 0.01% and involved several recounts and lawsuits. The final recount also reversed the outcome of this election.

==Voting difficulties==
===Voter registration===
In the months leading up to the 2004 election, both parties made efforts to register new voters. In some cases, Republicans challenged or prepared to challenge the validity of many new registrations, citing instances of fictitious names such as Mary Poppins appearing on the voter rolls.

There were also complaints about the rejection of registrations by government agencies. College students encountered difficulties in registering where they attended school. Some officials rejected voter registration forms on grounds that were contested, such as a failure to use paper of a particular weight (in Ohio) or a failure to check a box on the form (Florida).

A &quot;New York Daily News&quot; article alleged 46,000 people were registered to vote in both New York City and Florida. A &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; article identified 27,000 people possibly registered in both Ohio and Florida, with 400 possibly voting in both states consistently in the previous four years. The articles attempted to match voter rolls to each other, which probably did not produce accurate results due to similarity of names.

===Voter intimidation===

Court injunctions were placed by the Franklin County Common Pleas Court against MoveOn for verbally threatening and harassing individuals who identified themselves as Republican. On October 5, a Bush-Cheney campaign volunteer in Orlando had his arm broken when trying to stop union activists from storming the campaign office. The &quot;storming&quot; was part of a massive simultaneous campaign against 20 pro-Republican headquarters.

===Practical impediments===
In every election, some voters encounter practical impediments to voting, such as long lines at the polling place. In 2004, however, the issue received increased attention. In many places, some voters had to wait several hours to vote. In Ohio, some precincts had too few machines, causing long waiting times, while others had many machines per registered voters. Officials cited a late rush of registrations after voting machines had already been allocated as one source of long lines.

===Voting machines===

In the 2000 election, especially in the disputed recounts in Florida, there were issues concerning the ambiguities and uncertainties that arose from punch-card ballots, such as the hanging chads (incompletely punched holes). In 2004, the punch-card ballots were still widely used in some states. Most Ohio voters used punch-card ballots, and more than 90,000 ballots cast in Ohio were treated as not including a vote for President; this &quot;undervote&quot; could arise because the voter chose not to cast a vote or because of a malfunction of the punch-card system. Undervotes were down slightly from the 2000 election on the whole.

For the country as a whole, the voting technology used in the 2004 election breaks down as follows:

Before 2004, the increasing use of electronic voting machines had raised several issues:
* Security. Without proper testing and certification, electronic voting machines could produce an incorrect report due to malfunction or deliberate manipulation.
* Recounts. Voting machine recounts should include auditing of hardware, software and the comparison of multiple vote records. Nevada was one of several states which insisted on electronic voting systems that create a .
* Partisan ties. Democrats noted the Republican or conservative ties of several leading executives in the companies providing the machines.

The state of California ordered that 15,000 of its Diebold voting machines not be used in the 2004 elections due to flaws that the company failed to disclose.

In September 2005, the Government Accountability Office released a report noting electronic voting systems hold promise for improving the election process while citing concerns about security and reliability raised by numerous groups, and detailing specific problems that have occurred.

===Provisional and absentee ballots===
In Ohio, Secretary of State Ken Blackwell ruled that Ohio would not count provisional ballots that were submitted at the wrong precinct. This ruling was ultimately upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.

Absentee ballots were also an issue. There were reports of absentee ballots being mailed out too late for some voters to complete and return them in time. In Broward County, Florida, some 58,000 absentee ballots were delivered to the Postal Service to be mailed to voters, according to county election officials, but the Postal Service said it had never received them.

==Exit polls==
According to Richard Morin of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the 2004 election &quot;may have finally stripped exit polling of its reputation as the crown jewel of political surveys, somehow immune from the myriad problems that affect telephone polls and other types of public opinion surveys. Instead, this face-to-face, catch-the-voters-on-the-way-out poll has been revealed for what it is: just another poll, with all the problems and imperfections endemic to the craft.&quot; Exit polls showed a higher percentage of the vote for Kerry than he actually received, leading some, including Tony Blair, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to conclude that Kerry won the election prematurely.

Mitofsky International, the company responsible for exit polling for the National Election Pool (NEP) and its member news organizations, released a report detailing the 2004 election&#x27;s exit polling. The NEP report stated that &quot;the size of the average exit poll error ... was higher in 2004 than in previous years for which we have data&quot; and that exit polling estimates overstated Kerry&#x27;s share of the vote in 26 states by more than one standard error and overestimated Bush&#x27;s share in four states by more than one standard error. It concluded that these discrepancies between the exit polls and the official results were &quot;most likely due to Kerry voters participating in the exit polls at a higher rate than Bush voters&quot;. The NEP report further stated that &quot;Exit polls do not support the allegations of fraud due to rigging of voting equipment. Our analysis of the difference between the vote count and the exit poll at each polling location in our sample has found no systematic differences for precincts using touch screen and optical scan voting equipment.&quot; A study performed by the Caltech / MIT Voting Technology Project concluded that &quot;there is no evidence, based on exit polls, that electronic voting machines were used to steal the 2004 election for President Bush.&quot;

Following the 2004 election, researchers looked at ways in which polling methodologies might be flawed and explored ways to improve polling in the future.

==Recounts and close elections==
Ralph Nader requested a recount of 11 wards in New Hampshire where vote totals for Bush were 5–15% higher than predicted by exit polls. The Nader campaign reported that &quot;only very minor discrepancies were found between the optical scan machine counts of the ballots and the recount. The discrepancies are similar to those found when hand-counted ballots are recounted&quot;.

Two poll workers in Cuyahoga County were convicted of preselecting ballots for recounts in Ohio.

Around the country there were also recounts of races for state and local office. Most of them reflected simply the closeness of the official tally, but some also raised issues of election irregularities. These included the elections for:
* Governor of Washington, between Dino Rossi and Christine Gregoire. Issues raised included the mailing of absentee ballots, the counting of provisional and absentee ballots, correction of improper marks on optically scanned ballots, and alleged tampering with electronic voting machines. The first tally and the first recount gave the election to Republican Dino Rossi. However, after two statewide recounts, Gregoire, the Democrat, had a narrow lead of 129 votes out of 2.8 million cast. A Republican lawsuit seeking to overturn the result and force a re-vote was rejected by the court, after which Rossi conceded the election. See Washington gubernatorial election, 2004.
* North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture, between Britt Cobb and Steve Troxler. The number of votes lost due to a voting machine malfunction in Carteret County (over 4,000) exceed the reported margin of about 2,000. The state board of elections initially called for a new election in Cartaret County before a judge struck the idea down; a new statewide election was also struck down. The Troxler campaign attempted to gather affidavits from Cartaret County voters to establish they had won; this was mooted when Cobb, who said he wanted to &quot;avoid the terrible precedent of settling elections by affidavit&quot;, conceded.
* Governor of Puerto Rico, between Aníbal Acevedo Vilá and Pedro Rosselló. Aníbal Acevedo-Vilá was declared the winner after several months of disputes. The two candidates were separated by just under 4,000 votes.

==Objection to Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes==
After the election, many blogs published false rumors claiming to show evidence that voter fraud had prevented Kerry from winning. Unfounded conspiracy theories about the election were circulated and promoted. Conspiracy theorists argued the election was stolen, arguing that votes were switched from Democratic to Republican, that &quot;phantom voters&quot; voted in Ohio, that exit polls that favored Democrat John Kerry were &quot;more accurate&quot; than the actual result, and that voting machines were rigged to favor George W. Bush.

Although the overall result of the election was not challenged by the Kerry campaign, Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb and Libertarian Party presidential candidate Michael Badnarik obtained a recount in Ohio. This recount was completed December 28, 2004, although on January 24, 2007, a jury convicted two Ohio elections officials of selecting precincts to recount where they already knew the hand total would match the machine total, thereby avoiding having to perform a full recount. Independent candidate Ralph Nader obtained a recount in 11 New Hampshire precincts that used Accuvote voting machines.

As a result of these conspiracy theories, some Democratic members of Congress asked for investigations into the vote count. At the official counting of the electoral votes on January 6, an objection was made under the Electoral Count Act (now ) to Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes. Because the motion was supported by at least one member of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the law required that the two houses separate to debate and vote on the objection. In the House of Representatives, the objection was supported by 31 Democrats. It was opposed by 178 Republicans, 88 Democrats and one independent. Not voting were 52 Republicans and 80 Democrats. Four people elected to the House had not yet taken office, and one seat was vacant. In the Senate, it was supported only by its maker, Barbara Boxer, with 74 senators opposed and 25 not voting. During the debate, no Senator argued that the outcome of the election should be changed by either court challenge or revote. Boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome, but &quot;to cast the light of truth on a flawed system which must be fixed now.&quot;.

Kerry would later state that &quot;the widespread irregularities make it impossible to know for certain that the [Ohio] outcome reflected the will of the voters.&quot; In the same article, Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said &quot;I&#x27;m not confident that the election in Ohio was fairly decided... We know that there was substantial voter suppression, and the machines were not reliable. It should not be a surprise that the Republicans are willing to do things that are unethical to manipulate elections. That&#x27;s what we suspect has happened.&quot;

A 2005 report by Democratic House Judiciary Committee ranking member John Conyers titled &quot;What Went Wrong in Ohio&quot; claimed that &quot;numerous serious election irregularities&quot; and voter suppression by Republicans had caused Bush to win the state. The report was promoted by conspiracy theorists such as New York University professor Mark Crispin Miller and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as well as by author Gore Vidal. While some courts before the election found that certain restrictive voting policies of Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell were illegal, claims of voter and machine fraud swaying the election have been widely rejected and refuted. A congressional letter in 2005 support of the report was supported only by the &quot;most liberal members of Congress&quot; due to the &quot;exaggerated charges&quot; in the report.

<text>Julee Ann Cruise (December 1, 1956 – June 9, 2022) was an American singer and actress, known for her collaborations with composer Angelo Badalamenti and film director David Lynch in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She released four albums beginning with 1989&#x27;s &quot;Floating into the Night&quot;.

Cruise is best known for her 1989 single &quot;Falling&quot;; an instrumental version was used as the theme song for the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in which she appeared in a recurring role as a roadhouse singer. She reprised the role in the 1992 movie &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (which also featured her music), and in the 2017 revival series &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot;. She was also featured in Lynch and Badalamenti&#x27;s avant-garde 1990 theater production &quot;Industrial Symphony No. 1,&quot; which was filmed and released on home media.

Other notable singles included &quot;Rockin&#x27; Back Inside My Heart&quot; (1990) and &quot;If I Survive&quot; (1999) by the band Hybrid, which featured her vocals. In the 1990s, she was a touring member of the B-52&#x27;s, filling in for Cindy Wilson. Cruise was also a stage actress and appeared in the off-Broadway musicals &quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet&quot; and &quot;Radiant Baby&quot; in 2004. Her final album, &quot;My Secret Life&quot;, was released in 2011.

==Early life==
Born in Creston, Iowa, Julee Ann Cruise was the daughter of John Cruise, the town dentist, and Wilma Cruise, who was his office manager. She studied French horn at Drake University and performed as a singer and actress in Minneapolis with the Children&#x27;s Theater Company (notably in the role of Jinjur in stage adaptations of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; books).

She moved to New York and played Janis Joplin in a revue called &quot;Beehive&quot;, while also working with Angelo Badalamenti.

==Career==
===Collaborations with Badalamenti and Lynch===
In 1985, Badalamenti was composing the score for David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, as well as serving as the vocal coach for the film&#x27;s star, Isabella Rossellini. A key scene in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was intended to feature This Mortal Coil&#x27;s version of &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; by Tim Buckley, with lead vocal by Elizabeth Fraser. When it proved prohibitively expensive to obtain rights to use the song, it was suggested that Badalamenti compose a pop song in the same style, with lyrics written by Lynch. Because the song required a vocalist with a haunting, ethereal voice, Badalamenti recommended Cruise, who had sung in a New York theater workshop Badalamenti had produced. The result of their initial collaboration was &quot;Mysteries of Love&quot;, which figures prominently in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;″s closing scenes and gained a cult following.

Badalamenti and Lynch went on to write and produce additional songs for Cruise, most of which were featured in her debut album, &quot;Floating into the Night&quot; (1989). The album was released on September 12, 1989, by Warner Bros. Records, and charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; the following year. It also provided musical material for Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Industrial Symphony No. 1&quot;, in which Cruise performed while &quot;floating&quot; from a harness dozens of feet above a stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

The second, more significant project was the soundtrack to Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, for which Badalamenti composed the original score. The song &quot;Falling&quot;, which became the orchestral theme for the television series, caused a minor sensation, winning a Grammy at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards in 1991 for Best Pop Instrumental. The &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; soundtrack, featuring Cruise on the songs &quot;Into the Night&quot; and &quot;The Nightingale&quot; as well as on the vocal version of &quot;Falling&quot;, eventually went gold (500,000+ copies) in the U.S., a rare feat for a television soundtrack. Cruise made a number of appearances on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; as a singer at a local bar, and was prominently featured in both the show&#x27;s landmark pilot episode and the episode where Laura Palmer&#x27;s murderer is revealed, as well as in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;. &quot;Rockin&#x27; Back Inside My Heart&quot;, the second single from &quot;Floating into the Night&quot;, was released in 1990 and was also featured in an episode of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; along with &quot;The World Spins&quot;; in the episode, several of the main female characters are shown lip-synching to &quot;Rockin&#x27; Back Inside My Heart&quot;.

Cruise reinterpreted and sang the theme song for an episode of the USA Network show &quot;Psych&quot;. The episode, &quot;Dual Spires&quot;, was about a secluded town full of secrets and skeletons while they investigate the murder of a girl. It aired 20 years to the day after Laura Palmer&#x27;s murderer was revealed.

Cruise appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on May 12, 1990, filling in along with Spanic Boys on short notice when scheduled performer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor refused to appear on the same show as guest host Andrew Dice Clay. Cruise performed &quot;Falling&quot;.

The following year, Cruise recorded a Lynch- and Badalamenti-produced cover of the Elvis Presley song &quot;Summer Kisses, Winter Tears&quot; for the soundtrack of Wim Wenders&#x27;s &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;. Afterward, Cruise maintained a relatively low profile until her second album, &quot;The Voice of Love&quot;, was released in 1993. An instrumental version of &quot;She Would Die for Love&quot; was used as the main theme for the movie &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.&quot;

&quot;She Would Die for Love&quot; was also covered by alternative metal band Fantômas on their &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; album as &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;.

Cruise&#x27;s early collaborations with Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch were closely related to Lynch&#x27;s film work, which was reflected in the lyrics. For example, &quot;Into the Night&quot; begins with the whispered words &quot;Now it&#x27;s dark&quot;, a line which was repeatedly spoken by Frank Booth, Dennis Hopper&#x27;s character, in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. Lynch also photographed Cruise for the liner notes of &quot;Floating Into the Night&quot; and &quot;The Voice of Love&quot;, and created the sculptures featured on the covers of both albums.

In 2017 she appeared in Part 17 of the new &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; season performing &quot;The World Spins&quot;.

Cruise released the EP &quot;Three Demos&quot; in 2018, containing the original demo versions of &quot;Floating&quot;, &quot;Falling&quot;, and &quot;The World Spins&quot;.

===Post-Badalamenti and Lynch===
Cruise&#x27;s long-delayed third album, &quot;The Art of Being a Girl&quot;, was released in 2002. This was the first of her albums for which Badalamenti and Lynch did not produce or write any of the music. Instead, the music and lyrics for each of the songs were written by Cruise herself (with the exception of an updated version of the single &quot;Falling&quot;), and produced by Rick Strom and Mocean Worker.

In 2011, Cruise released her fourth album, &quot;My Secret Life&quot;. The album was a collaboration with DJ Dmitry (formerly of Deee-Lite) and contained a cover of Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; and a cover (technically) of Hybrid&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Beating&quot; called &quot;A Fatal Beating&quot;.

Cruise also acted and sang in the off-Broadway cast of &quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet&quot;, a spoof of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and toured with The B-52&#x27;s as Cindy Wilson&#x27;s touring stand-in on and off from 1992 to 1999. She also performed regularly with Bobby McFerrin&#x27;s improvisational vocal group Voicestra/CircleSong.

She appeared as Andy Warhol (among other characters, including Susan Sontag) in the 2004 Keith Haring bio-musical &quot;Radiant Baby&quot; at The Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival, directed by George C. Wolfe.

===Other collaborations===
Cruise lent her vocals to works by a miscellaneous list of collaborators, mostly in electronic music. She collaborated with Moby on his song &quot;Drown Disco&quot; which remains unreleased.

She provided vocals and lyrics to several of the songs on &quot;Wide Angle&quot; (1999), the debut album by Welsh electronic music group Hybrid, notably the nu skool breaks track &quot;If I Survive&quot;. In 1999, she performed on two songs on &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic!&quot; by DJ Silver, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Your Girl&quot;.

She appeared on the albums &quot;1-900-Get-Khan&quot; (1999) and &quot;No Comprendo&quot; (2001) by dance artist Khan (Can Oral), and performed live and toured numerous times with him. The lyrics for many of these songs, such as &quot;Body Dump&quot;, reflect Cruise&#x27;s own interest in true crime. Their most successful collaboration, the classic &quot;Say Good-bye&quot;, was a hit in Europe and elsewhere.

She was featured in two songs on Supa DJ Dmitry&#x27;s (formerly of Deee-Lite) album &quot;Scream of Consciousness&quot; (2000): &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk Me Down&quot; (originally issued on TVT 7311-0 12&quot;) and a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot;.

She appeared on a number of tracks on both the 2003 album &quot;Dreams Top Rock&quot; and the 2007 album &quot;Monstrous Surplus&quot; by German post-rock act Pluramon, a pseudonym of the musician Marcus Schmickler. Cruise appeared as a guest vocalist on &quot;Sarcast While&quot;, the 2006 full-length album from the New York band, Time of Orchids, released on Tzadik Records. Her vocals appeared on five tracks on Kenneth Bager&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Fragments from a Space Cadet&quot;.

Cruise provided the vocals for Delerium&#x27;s &quot;Magic&quot; song (on the &quot;Chimera&quot; album). She also provided vocals alongside Pharrell Williams on Handsome Boy Modeling School&#x27;s song &quot;Class System&quot;, produced by Prince Paul. Additionally, she contributed vocals on Ror-Shak&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Deep&quot;, on the song &quot;Fate or Faith&quot;.

Cruise was photographed in London by the fashion photographer Matt Colombo in an editorial that appeared in issue No. 49 of &quot;Zoo Magazine&quot; in 2015.

====Cover versions, film soundtracks and adverts====
Cruise recorded several memorable covers over the years, including Sir Cliff Richard&#x27;s &quot;Wired for Sound&quot; with B(if)tek, R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot; with Eric Kupper, Eurythmics&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; with DJ Silver, Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Summer Kisses, Winter Tears&quot;, and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot; with Supa DJ Dmitry.

In 1991, Cruise contributed the song &quot;Summer Kisses, Winter Tears&quot; to the &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; soundtrack.

In 1996, Cruise with the Flow appeared on the &quot;Scream&quot; soundtrack with the song &quot;Artificial World (Interdimensional Mix)&quot;.

In 2001, Cruise contributed two exclusive tracks to the &quot;An American Nightmare&quot; (which stars David Hess) soundtrack CD maxi-single, &quot;In Your World of Blue&quot; and &quot;Never Let You Go&quot;.

In 2003, Depeche Mode songwriter Martin Gore included a cover version of Cruise&#x27;s song &quot;In My Other World&quot; (from her 1993 album &quot;The Voice of Love&quot;) on &quot;Counterfeit²&quot;, the second in his series of cover albums dedicated to his own musical influences and atmospheric inspirations. That same year, Cruise&#x27;s song &quot;The World Spins&quot; was featured in an extended ballet sequence in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Company&quot;.

A modified sample of Cruise&#x27;s song &quot;I Float Alone&quot; was used as the backing track in the Dean Blunt song &quot;The Narcissist&quot;.

Cruise&#x27;s song &quot;Floating&quot; was featured in TV advertisements and trailers for the show &quot;The Riches&quot;, which debuted on FX in March 2007. The next year her music was used in &quot;&quot; and in episode 12 of season 5 of &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;Dual Spires&quot;, she sang a rendition of &quot;Psych&quot; theme song. The episode was a spoof of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

In 2012, her song &quot;The World Spins&quot; was used in an episode of the TV show &quot;House&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cruise married Edward Grinnan, an author and editor, in 1988. They lived in Manhattan and in the Berkshires.

==Health and death==
On March 28, 2018, Cruise announced on her Facebook page that she had systemic lupus, which caused her considerable pain and affected her ability to walk and stand. She also had depression. Reflecting on death in a 2018 interview with &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Cruise said, &quot;But I&#x27;m not gonna get buried. I&#x27;m going to have my ashes mixed in with my dogs&#x27;. They&#x27;re gonna spread my ashes across Arizona, and Arizona is going to turn blue. It&#x27;s not gonna be a red state anymore.&quot;

Cruise died in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on June 9, 2022, aged 65; her death was a suicide. Her husband, Edward Grinnan, said that she &quot;left this realm on her own terms. No regrets. She is at peace ... I played her &#x27;Roam&#x27; during her transition. Now she will roam forever. Rest In Peace, my love.&quot;

<text>Kevin Drumm (born 1970) is an experimental musician based in Chicago, United States.

==Biography==
Emerging from the city&#x27;s improvised music scene, in the 1990s he became one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent prepared guitar players. Since then his work has expanded to include electroacoustic compositions and live electronic music made with laptop computers and analog modular synthesizers. His early recordings contain mostly sparse, quiet sounds; recent works have been more loud and dense.

Drumm has collaborated with many artists working in similar fields, including Japanese guitarist Taku Sugimoto, multi-instrumentalist and producer Jim O&#x27;Rourke, and many European improvisers such as Swedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson and German trumpeter Axel Dörner. He has also worked with the artist group Simparch, composing a piece for their installation &quot;Spec&quot;, shown at Documenta XI in Kassel, Germany and at the Renaissance Society in Chicago. Drumm has also worked with saxophonist Ken Vandermark&#x27;s Territory Band, which brings together American and European players who work in both jazz and free improvisation. Drumm has received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2011).

<text>The Smallgoods is an Australian indie pop band originally from the Victorian coastal town of Port Fairy, but now based in Melbourne. The band&#x27;s music draws on influences from 1960s artists such as The Beatles and The Byrds, along with more recent pop influences.

The band was originally a four-piece consisting of brothers, Gus and Lachlan Franklin, Ben Mason and Shags Chamberlain who established themselves on the Warrnambool pub scene in 1999 - Ben and Lachlan were playing in local cover band, Slight Return, Gus having achieved 15 minutes of fame with his Triple J Unearthed winning group, Gramps, and Shags playing keyboards with the Port Fairy band, The Pimps. &quot;We were called Lukewerm originally, which was kind of on the right track but not the right train. I hated the name. It came about because we shopped this demo around and someone gave us a gig and we needed a name and it just kind of came out. The Smallgoods is a &#x27;60s-ish kind of name and we&#x27;re a &#x27;60s-ish kind of band. It kind of stuck, even though it means &#x27;meat products&#x27;&quot; - Ben Mason.Their debut album, &quot;Listen to the Radio&quot; was recorded over two years with the help of Melbourne producer and musician Paul Thomas (The Huxton Creepers, Weddings Parties Anything and Custard). It was released by Half A Cow records in November 2003 receiving airplay on National Youth broadcaster, Triple J and community radio stations across Australia including 3RRR (Melbourne), PBS (Melbourne), FBi (Sydney), 2SER (Sydney), 3D Radio (Adelaide), 4ZZZ (Brisbane) and RTRFM (Perth). Melbourne&#x27;s Inpress magazine bestowing &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; status upon the song &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, which appeared on a split 7-inch shared with New Yorkers, The Essex Green. The single was released as part of the Singles Club collective, through Low Transit Industries.

In the last two years the Smallgoods have been developing their show alongside acts like The Shins (USA), Ben Kweller (USA), Josh Rouse (USA), The New Folk Implosion (USA), The Brunettes (NZ), Architecture in Helsinki, The Lucksmiths, Midstate Orange and Ground Components, to name a few. This is in addition to a headline shows in Sydney, Canberra, Newcastle and Adelaide, and a notable return to their hometown to appear at the Port Fairy Folk Festival in 2003.

In 2007 the band signed with Melbourne&#x27;s a new record label at Melbourne&#x27;s Lost and Lonesome Record Company and with help from engineer Marcus Barczak (Art of Fighting, Midstate Orange, The Small Knives) have completed recording their latest album, &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; which is due to be released in August 2007.

<doc id="1194789" wikidata="Q8563761" url="?curid=1194789" title="Flexible organic light-emitting diode">
<text>A flexible organic light-emitting diode (FOLED) is a type of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) incorporating a flexible plastic substrate on which the electroluminescent organic semiconductor is deposited. This enables the device to be bent or rolled while still operating. Currently the focus of research in industrial and academic groups, flexible OLEDs form one method of fabricating a rollable display.

==Technical details and applications==
An OLED emits light due to the electroluminescence of thin films of organic semiconductors approximately 100 nm thick. Regular OLEDs are usually fabricated on a glass substrate, but by replacing glass with a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) among others, OLEDs can be made both bendable and lightweight.

Such materials may not be suitable for comparable devices based on inorganic semiconductors due to the need for lattice matching and the high temperature fabrication procedure involved.

In contrast, flexible OLED devices can be fabricated by deposition of the organic layer onto the substrate using a method derived from inkjet printing, allowing the inexpensive and roll-to-roll fabrication of printed electronics.

Flexible OLEDs may be used in the production of rollable displays, electronic paper, or bendable displays which can be integrated into clothing, wallpaper or other curved surfaces. Prototype displays have been exhibited by companies such as Sony, which are capable of being rolled around the width of a pencil.

==Disadvantages==

Both flexible substrate itself as well as the process of bending the device introduce stress into the materials. There may be residual stress from the deposition of layers onto a flexible substrate, thermal stresses due to the different coefficient of thermal expansion of materials in the device, in addition to the external stress from the bending of the device.

Stress introduced into the organic layers may lower the efficiency or brightness of the device as it is deformed, or cause complete breakdown of the device altogether. Indium tin oxide (ITO), the material most commonly used as the transparent anode, is brittle. Fracture of the anode can occur which can increase the sheet resistance of the ITO or disrupt the layered structure of the OLED. Although ITO is the most common and best understood anode material used in OLEDs, research has been undertaken into alternative materials that are better suited for flexible applications including carbon nanotubes.

Encapsulation is another challenge for flexible OLED devices. The materials in an OLED are sensitive to air and moisture which lead to degradation of the materials themselves as well as quenching of excited states within the molecule. The common method of encapsulation for regular OLEDs is to seal the organic layer between glass. Flexible encapsulation methods are generally not as effective a barrier to air and moisture as glass, and current research aims to improve the encapsulation of flexible organic light emitting diodes.
