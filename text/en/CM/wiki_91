<text>Central place theory is an urban geographical theory that seeks to explain the number, size and range of market services in a commercial system or human settlements in a residential system. It was introduced in 1933 to explain the spatial distribution of cities across the landscape. The theory was first analyzed by German geographer Walter Christaller, who asserted that settlements simply functioned as &#x27;central places&#x27; providing economic services to surrounding areas. Christaller explained that a large number of small settlements will be situated relatively close to one another for efficiency, and because people don&#x27;t want to travel far for everyday needs, like getting bread from a bakery. But people would travel further for more expensive and infrequent purchases or specialized goods and services which would be located in larger settlements that are farther apart.

==Building the theory ==
To develop the theory, Christaller made the following simplifying assumptions:

All areas have:
* an unbounded isotropic (all flat), homogeneous, limitless surface (abstract space)
* an evenly distributed population
* all settlements are equidistant and exist in a triangular lattice pattern
* evenly distributed resources
* distance decay mechanism
* perfect competition and all sellers are economic people maximizing their profits
* consumers are of the same income level and same shopping behaviour
* all consumers have a similar purchasing power and demand for goods and services.
* Consumers visit the nearest central places that provide the function which they demand. They minimize the distance to be travelled
* no provider of goods or services is able to earn excess profit (each supplier has a monopoly over a hinterland)
Therefore, the trade areas of these central places who provide a particular good or service must all be of equal size
* there is only one type of transport and this would be equally easy in all directions
* transport cost is directly proportional to distance travelled

The theory then relied on two concepts: &quot;threshold&quot; and &quot;range&quot;. 
*Threshold is the minimum market (population or income) needed to bring about the selling of a particular good or service.
*Range is the maximum distance consumers are prepared to travel to acquire goods - at some point the cost or inconvenience will outweigh the need for the good.

The result of these consumer preferences is that a system of centers of various sizes will emerge. Each center will supply particular types of goods forming levels of hierarchy. In the functional hierarchies, generalizations can be made regarding the spacing, size and function of settlements.

#The larger the settlements are in size, the fewer in number they will be, i.e. there are many small villages, but few large cities.
#The larger the settlements grow in size, the greater the distance between them, i.e. villages are usually found close together, while cities are spaced much further apart.
#As a settlement increases in size, the range and number of its functions will increase .
#As a settlement increases in size, the number of higher-order services will also increase, i.e. a greater degree of specialization occurs in the services.

The higher the order of the goods and services (more durable, valuable and variable), the larger the range of the goods and services, the longer the distance people are willing to travel to acquire them. Although, higher goods can increase the price of lower goods or knock off versions of the higher goods. 

At the base of the hierarchy pyramid are shopping centres, newsagents etc. which sell low order goods. These centres are small. At the top of the pyramid are centres selling high order goods. These centres are large. Examples for low order goods and services are: newspaper stalls, groceries, bakeries and post offices. Examples for high order goods and services include jewelry, large shopping malls and arcades. They are supported by a much larger threshold population and demand.

==Predictions==
He deduced that settlements would tend to form in a triangular/hexagonal lattice, as it is the most efficient pattern to serve areas without any overlap.

In the orderly arrangement of an urban hierarchy, seven different principal orders of settlement have been identified by Christaller, providing different groups of goods and services. Settlement are regularly spaced - equidistant spacing between same order centers, with larger centers farther apart than smaller centers. Settlements have hexagonal market areas, and are most efficient in number and functions.

The different layouts predicted by Christaller have &quot;K&quot;-values which show how much the sphere of influence of the central places takes in — the central place itself counts as 1 and each portion of a satellite counts as its portion:

=== &quot;K&quot; = 3 marketing principle ===

According to the marketing principle &quot;K&quot; = 3, the market area of a higher-order place (node) occupies one-third of the market area of each of the consecutive lower size place (node) that lies on its neighbour; the lower size nodes (6 in numbers and second larger circles) are located at the corner of a largest hexagon around low value the high-order settlement. Each high-order settlement gets one-third of each satellite settlement (which are 6 in total), thus &quot;K&quot; = 1 + 6 ×  = 3.

However, in this &quot;K&quot; = 3 marketing network the distance traveled is minimized.

=== &quot;K&quot; = 4 transporting/traffic principle ===

According to &quot;K&quot; = 4 transport principle, the market area of a higher-order place includes a half of the market area of each of the six neighbouring lower-order places, as they are located on the edges of hexagons around the high-order settlements. This generates a hierarchy of central places which results in the most efficient transport network. There are maximum central places possible located on the main transport routes connecting the higher order center. The transportation principle involves the minimization of the length of roads connecting central places at all hierarchy levels. In this system of nesting, the lower order centres are all located along the roads linking the higher order centres. This alignment of places along a road leads to minimization of road length. However, for each higher order centre, there are now four centres of immediate lower order, as opposed to three centres under the marketing principle.

=== &quot;K&quot; = 7 administrative principle ===
According to &quot;K&quot; = 7 administrative principle (or political-social principle), settlements are nested according to sevens. The market areas of the smaller settlements are completely enclosed within the market area of the larger settlement. Since tributary areas cannot be split administratively, they must be allocated exclusively to a single higher-order place. Efficient administration is the control principle in this hierarchy.

==Evaluation==

The validity of the place theory may vary with local factors, such as climate, topography, history of development, technological improvement and personal preference of consumers and suppliers. However, it is still possible to discern Christaller patterns in most distributions of urban centres, even though these patterns will often be distorted by the terrain or imperfect because of suboptimal (with regard to the optimal distribution of centres) historical development decisions. 

Economic status of consumers in an area is also important. Consumers of higher economic status tend to be more mobile and therefore bypass centers providing only lower order goods. The application of central place theory must be tempered by an awareness of such factors when planning shopping center space location.

Purchasing power and density affect the spacing of centers and hierarchical arrangements. Sufficient densities will allow, for example, a grocery store, a lower order function, to survive in an isolated location.

Factors shaping the extent of market areas: 
* Land use: industrial areas can provide little in the way of a consuming population
* Poor accessibility: this can limit the extent of a center&#x27;s market area
* Competition: this limits the extent of market areas in all directions
* Technology: high mobility afforded by the automobile allows overlapping of market areas

Market area studies provide another technique for using central place theory as a retail location planning tool. The hierarchy of shopping centers has been widely used within the planning of &quot;new towns&quot;. In this new town, the hierarchy of business centers is evident. One main shopping center provides mostly durable goods (higher order); district and local shopping centers supply, increasingly, convenience (lower order) goods. These centers provided for in the new town plan are not free from outside competition. The impacts of surrounding existing centers on the new town centers cannot be ignored.

==Examples==

The newly reclaimed polders of the Netherlands provide an isotropic plane on which settlements have developed and in certain areas 6 small towns can be seen surrounding a larger town, especially in the Noord-Oostpolder and Flevoland.

The Fens of East Anglia in the UK also provide a large expanse of flat land with no natural barriers to settlement development. Cambridge is a good example of a K=4 Transport Model Central Place, although it is surrounded by 7, rather than 6, settlements. Each satellite is 10–15 miles from Cambridge and each lies on a major road leading out of Cambridge:
* Ely - A10 north
* Newmarket - A1303 (now bypassed by A14/A11) northeast
* Haverhill - A1307 southeast
* Saffron Walden - A1301 south
* Royston - A10 southwest
* St Neots - A428 west
* St Ives - A14 northwest

As all of the satellite settlements are on transport links, this is a good example of a K=4 CPT model (although in this case it is K=4.5 due to 7 rather than 6 settlements).

Another example of the use of CPT was in the delineation of Medical Care Regions in California. A hierarchy of primary, secondary and tertiary care cities was described, and the population size and income needed to support each medical care specialty in California determined.

== Criticism ==
The central place theory has been criticized for being static; it does not incorporate the temporal aspect in the development of central places. Furthermore, the theory holds up well when it comes to agricultural areas, but not industrial or postindustrial areas due to their diversified nature of various services or their varied distribution of natural resources.

== Newer developments: a dynamic concept for CPT ==
Newer theoretical developments have shown that it is possible to overcome the static aspect of CPT. Veneris (1984) developed a theoretical model which starts with (a) a system of evenly distributed (&quot;medieval&quot;) towns; (b) new economic activities are located in some towns thus causing differentiation and evolution into a hierarchical (&quot;industrial&quot;) city system; (c) further differentiation leads into a post-hierarchical (&quot;postindustrial&quot;) city system.

This evolution can be modelled by means of the three major CPT theories: stage (a) is a system of von Thünen &quot;isolated states&quot;; stage (b) is a Christallerian hierarchical system; stage (c) is a Löschian post-hierarchical system. Furthermore, stage (b) corresponds to Christopher Alexander&#x27;s &quot;tree&quot; city, while (c) is similar to his &quot;lattice&quot; system (following his dictum &quot;the city is not a tree&quot;).

==The importance of a city and other theoretical considerations==
According to Margot Smith, Walter Christaller erred in his development of CPT in 1930 by using size of population and number of telephones in determining the importance of a city. Smith recognized that although population size was important to the area served by a city, the number of kinds of services offered there was more important as a measure of the importance of a city in attracting consumers. In applying CPT to describe the delivery of medical care in California, Smith counted the number of physician specialties to determine the importance of a city in the delivery of medical care.

Christaller also erred in the assumption that cities &quot;emerge&quot;. In California and much of the United States, many cities were situated by the railroads at the time the tracks were laid. In California, towns founded by the railroads were 12 miles apart, the amount of track a section crew could maintain in the 1850s; larger towns were 60 miles apart, the distance a steam engine could travel before needing water. Older towns were founded a day&#x27;s horse ride apart by the Spanish priests who founded early missions.

In medical care regions described by Smith, there is a hierarchy of services, with primary care ideally distributed throughout an area, middle sized cities offering secondary care, and metropolitan areas with tertiary care. Income, size of population, population demographics, distance to the next service center, all had an influence on the number and kind of specialists located in a population center. (Smith, 1977, 1979)

For example, orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry are more likely to be found in high income areas. It was possible to estimate the size of population (threshold) needed to support a specialty, and also to link specialties that needed to cooperate and locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.

Her work is important for the study of physician location—where physicians choose to practice and where their practices will have a sufficient population size to support them. The income level of the population determines whether sufficient physicians will practice in an area and whether public subsidy is needed to maintain the health of the population.

The distribution of medical care in California followed patterns having to do with the settlement of cities. Cities and their hinterlands having characteristics of the &quot;traffic principle&quot; (see K=4 above) usually have six thoroughfares through them—the thoroughfares including highways, rivers, railroads, and canals. They are most efficient and can deliver the lowest cost services because transportation is cheaper. Those having settled on the market principle (K=3 above) have more expensive services and goods, as they were founded at times when transportation was more primitive. In Appalachia, for example, the market principle still prevails and rural medical care is much more expensive.

== Making central place theory operational ==
CPT is often criticized as being &quot;unrealistic&quot;. However, several studies show that it can describe existing urban systems. An important issue is that Christaller&#x27;s original formulation is incorrect in several ways (Smith). These errors become apparent if we try to make CPT &quot;operational&quot;, that is if we try to derive numerical data out of the theoretical schemata. These problems have been identified for by Veneris (1984) and subsequently by Openshaw and Veneris (2003), who provided also theoretically sound and consistent solutions, based on a K=3, 37-centre CP system:

#Closure problem. Christaller&#x27;s original scheme implies an infinite landscape. Although each market has finite size, the total system has no boundaries to it. Neither Christaller, nor the early related literature provide any guidance as to how the system can be &quot;contained&quot;. Openshaw and Veneris (2003) identified three different types of closure, namely (a) isolated state, (b) territorial closure and (c) functional closure. Each closure type implies different population patterns.
#Generating trips. Following the basic Christallerian logic and the closure types identified, Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate trip patterns between the 27 centres.
#Calculating inter- and intra-zonal costs/distances. Christaller assumed freedom of movement in all directions, which would imply &quot;airline&quot; distances between centres. At the same time, he provided specific road networks for the CP system, which do not allow for airline distances. This is a major flaw which neither Christaller, nor early related literature have identified. Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate costs/distances which are consistent with the Christallerian principles.

=== Central place theory and spatial interaction models ===
It was once thought that central place theory is not compatible with spatial interaction models (SIM). It is paradoxical however that some times towns or shopping centres are planned with CPT, and subsequently evaluated with SIM.

Openshaw and Veneris (2003) succeeded in linking these two major regional theories in a clear and theoretically consistent way: using the data they derived from the operationalization of CPT, they experimented with several SIM. Following a thorough investigation via computer simulation, they reached important theoretical and practical conclusions.

Smith was able to delineate medical care regions (the range), describe the hierarchy of medical services, the population base required of each medical specialty (threshold), the efficiency of regions, and the importance of how an area was settled to the delivery of medical care, that is, according to traffic, market or administrative principles.

<doc id="1223923" wikidata="Q370362" url="?curid=1223923" title="Francis Granger">
<text>Francis Granger (December 1, 1792 – August 31, 1868) was an American politician who represented Ontario County, New York, in the United States House of Representatives for three non-consecutive terms. He was a leading figure in the state and national Whig Party, particularly in its moderate-conservative faction. He served as a Whig vice presidential nominee on the party&#x27;s multi-candidate 1836 ticket and, in that role, became the only person to ever lose a contingent election for the vice presidency in the U.S. Senate. He also served briefly in 1841 as United States Postmaster General in the cabinet of William Henry Harrison. In 1856, he became the final Whig Party chairman before the party&#x27;s collapse, after which he joined the Constitutional Union Party.

==Early life==
Granger was born in Suffield, Connecticut, on December 1, 1792. Granger was born into a prominent political family, with his father, Gideon Granger, serving in the Connecticut House of Representatives before being appointed by Thomas Jefferson as the longest serving Postmaster General in United States history. His mother was Mindwell (née Pease) Granger (1770–1860) and his first cousin, Amos Phelps Granger, also served two terms in the United States House of Representatives.

Granger pursued classical studies at and graduated from Yale College in 1811. He then moved with his father to Canandaigua, New York, in 1814, where he studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1816 and commenced practice.

==Career==
Granger started his own political career as a member of the New York State Assembly from 1826 to 1828 and from 1830 to 1832. He ran unsuccessful campaigns for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1828, and for Governor of New York in both 1830 and 1832 with the National Republican Party.

===National politics===
He was then elected as an Anti-Jacksonian to the 24th Congress serving from March 4, 1835, to March 3, 1837.

In 1836, the Whig Party was unable to settle on one set of candidates for its presidential ticket. Granger was a regional vice presidential nominee for the northern and border states on the same ticket as William Henry Harrison, though in Massachusetts he was on the Whig ticket headed by Daniel Webster. Though Democrat Martin Van Buren secured enough votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency, Virginia&#x27;s 23 electors refused to vote for his running mate Richard M. Johnson, who had then lacked only one vote. As a result, votes were split among Johnson, Granger, John Tyler and William Smith with none getting the majority. This triggered a contingent election, the only contingent vice presidential election by the Senate in history, under the Twelfth Amendment with the U.S. Senate deciding between the top two vote-getters Johnson and Granger. As the 25th Congress consisted of 35 Democrats and 17 Whigs, Granger could not hope to be elected and was defeated by Johnson 33–16.

In the general election of the same year, Granger was also running as a Whig candidate for election to the 25th Congress, but failed in that bid as well. He was re-elected to Congress as a Whig to the 26th and 27th Congresses serving from March 4, 1839, to March 5, 1841.

Harrison would win the presidency four years later in 1840 but Granger was not again his running mate and was instead replaced by John Tyler.

If Granger had been reselected as Harrison&#x27;s running mate in 1840, Granger as vice president would have become president when President Harrison died in April 1841 after a month in office.

In 1841, Granger was appointed Postmaster General in the Cabinet of President William Henry Harrison and served from March 6 to September 18, 1841, the day when almost all Whig Cabinet members left the government of new President John Tyler on the instruction of their party leader Henry Clay. Following that event, he was again elected to the Congress in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Representative John Greig. He served from November 27, 1841, to March 3, 1843, and was not a candidate for reelection in 1842.

===Later career===
A supporter of the Compromise of 1850, Granger led the pro-Fillmore group which became known as the Silver Gray Whigs after Granger&#x27;s own silver hair. This faction would remain in conflict with the anti-Compromise Sewardites until the collapse of the Whig Party in the state in 1855.

Chairman of the Whig National Executive Committee from 1856 to 1860, Granger joined in the call for the convention of the Constitutional Union Party that was held in May 1860. He was then a member of the peace convention of 1861 held in Washington, D.C., in an effort to devise means to prevent the impending war.

==Personal life==
He married Cornelia Rutsen Van Rensselaer (1798–1823), the daughter of Jeremiah Van Rensselaer and Sybella Adeline (née Kane) Van Rensselaer. She was also the granddaughter of Brigadier General Robert Van Rensselaer, who was a member of the New York Provincial Congress from 1775 to 1777 and later a member of the New York State Assembly in the 1st, 2nd and 4th New York State Legislatures. The Grangers&#x27; home at Canandaigua from 1817 to 1827, now known as the Francis Granger House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Together, they had a daughter, son, and an unnamed second daughter who died with her mother in childbirth in 1823.

* Adele Granger (1819–1892), who married John Eliot Thayer (1803–1857), the son of Nathaniel Thayer. After his death, she remarried in 1865 to Robert Charles Winthrop (1809–1894), a U.S. Senator and Representative who served as Speaker of the House.
* Gideon Granger II (1821–1868), who married Isaphine Pierson (1826–1905), the daughter of U.S. Representative Isaac Pierson.

Granger died in Canandaigua on August 31, 1868. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.

<text>Cumbria Constabulary is the territorial police force in England covering the unitary authority areas of Cumberland and Westmorland and Furness in the ceremonial county of Cumbria. As of September 2017, the force had 1,108 police officers, 535 police staff, 93 police community support officers, and 86 special constables.

The force serves a population of 500,000 across an area of .
There are significant areas of isolated and rural community, and the area has one of the smallest visible minority ethnic populations in the country at under 3.0%. Each year, the force&#x27;s area, which incorporates the Lake District National Park, attracts over 23million visitors from all over the world (46 times the local population). The area has of motorway and some of trunk and primary roads.

The chief constable is Rob Carden. The headquarters of the force are at Carleton Hall, Penrith.

== History ==
Cumberland and Westmorland Constabulary was formed in 1856. In 1947 this force absorbed Kendal Borough Police. Less than 20 years later this amalgamated force absorbed Carlisle City Police to form a force broadly the same as today&#x27;s force called the Cumberland, Westmorland and Carlisle Constabulary. In 1965, it had an establishment of 652 and an actual strength of 617. In 1967 the force name was changed to Cumbria Constabulary.

In 1974 the force&#x27;s boundaries were expanded to include the new non-metropolitan county of Cumbria, in particular Furness and Sedbergh Rural District.

The Home Secretary proposed on 6 February 2006 to merge it with Lancashire Constabulary. These proposals were accepted by both forces on 25 February and the merger would have taken place on 1 April 2007. However, in July 2006, the Cumbria and Lancashire forces decided not to proceed with the merger because the Government could not remedy issues with the differing council tax precepts.

* The force&#x27;s first, and to date only, murder of an officer occurred on 10 February 1965. Constable George William Russell, aged 36, was fatally shot when, unarmed and knowing that colleagues had already been fired on, he confronted an armed suspect and called upon him to surrender at the railway station in Kendal. Russell was posthumously awarded the Queen&#x27;s Police Medal for gallantry and a memorial plaque has been unveiled on a wall at Carlisle Cathedral.
* PC Nick Dumphreys was killed on duty on 26 January 2020, when his vehicle crashed whilst responding to an emergency call in the Carlisle area. PC Dumphreys was part of Cumbria Constabulary&#x27;s roads policing unit.

<text>French Guiana is not a separate territory but a region of France. France has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

For further details see the article: Politics of France.

==The parties==
Most of the French political parties are active in French Guiana.

In addition to these there are a number of regional parties:

Since the December 2015 territorial elections, all the regional parties and the branches of the metropolitan parties hitherto represented in the former regional and general councils have been eliminated from the new Guianese Assembly. Only two lists, both labeled &quot;miscellaneous left&quot; (&quot;LDVG&quot;) by the Interior Ministry, concurred for the second round, none of them from a party or coalition of parties, both of them including unaffiliated candidates from left and right. Many local officeholders are also &quot;miscellaneous left&quot; or &quot;miscellaneous right&quot;.

<text>Illinois Route 89 (IL 89) is a rural, north–south state highway in central Illinois. It runs from U.S. Route 34 (US 34) in La Moille southward to IL 116 in Metamora. IL 26 and IL 89 are the main north–south roads between Interstate 39 (I-39)/US 51 and IL 29.

== Route description ==

Starting at La Moille, IL 89 travels south and passes through the small towns of Arlington, Cherry, and Ladd, where it crosses I-80. After passing Spring Valley and crossing the Illinois River, IL 89 crosses IL 71 near Granville, then passes through McNabb. After crossing IL 18 in Magnolia and IL 17 at Varna, it then passes through LaRose and Washburn as only state highway in those two towns. It becomes North Niles Street in Metamora and ends at Mount Vernon Street, IL 116.

== History ==

SBI Route 89 originally ran from Dixon to Metamora along Illinois Route 26 and Illinois 71. It was truncated north at Granville in 1938 and rerouted to La Moille.

The highway&#x27;s crossing of the Illinois River in Spring Valley was replaced with a new bridge that opened on June 18, 2018. The former bridge was imploded.

<text>William Richard Cotter VC (March 1882 – 14 March 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Cotter was born in Folkestone, Kent in 1882 the son of Richard and Amy Cotter, his father who had been born in Ireland was described in the 1891 census of Elham as a plasterer&#x27;s labourer.

He was 33 years old, and an Acting Corporal in the 6th Battalion, The Buffs (East Kent Regiment), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 6 March 1916 near Hohenzollern Redoubt, France, Corporal Cotter&#x27;s leg was blown off at the knee and he was also wounded in both arms. He nevertheless made his way unaided for 50 yards to a crater, steadied the men who were holding it, controlled their fire, issued orders and altered their dispositions to meet a fresh counter-attack. For two hours he held his position and only allowed his wounds to be roughly dressed when the attack had quietened down. He could not be moved back for 14 hours and during all this time he had a cheery word for everyone.

He was buried at Lillers Communal Cemetery, France which is north west of Bethune. Plot IV. Row E. Grave 45.

His Victoria Cross was on display at The Buffs Regimental Museum, Canterbury, England. With the rest of that museum&#x27;s collections, it has now been transferred to the National Army Museum, where it is now displayed.

The Amazing Brewery Co. based at the Ship Inn in Sandgate, Folkestone, brews a classic bitter – Amazing Cotter VC – in his honour.

<doc id="1223946" wikidata="Q5496090" url="?curid=1223946" title="Fred Potts">
<text>Frederick William Owen Potts, VC, (18 December 1892 – 2 November 1943), more commonly known as Trooper Fred Potts, was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Potts was born and raised on Edgehill Street in the Katesgrove area of Reading. He first came to public notice in 1913, when he saved five-year-old boy, Charles Rex, from drowning in the River Thames (Rex lived to the age of 87.)

In 1915, Potts was 22 years old, and a private in the 1/1st Berkshire Yeomanry of the British Army. During the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War, he performed the following deed, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 21 August 1915 in the attack on Hill 70, Potts (although wounded in the thigh) remained for over 48 hours under the Turkish trenches with Arthur Andrews, another private from his regiment who was severely wounded and unable to move. (Andrews also came from Reading.) Potts finally fixed a shovel to the equipment of his wounded comrade and, using this as a sledge, dragged the man back over to safety, being under fire all the way. He became known as &quot;the hero with the shovel&quot;. He was feted on his return from Gallipoli.

After the war, during which he eventually achieved the rank of lance-corporal, he kept a tailor&#x27;s shop in his home town. He was a Mason and in 1934 was Master of the Aldermaston Lodge.

Potts died on 2 November 1943 at the age of 50. His grave is at Reading Crematorium, whilst his medals are held by the Imperial War Museum.

Andrews lived until 1980, when he died at the age of 89. In 2009, as the result of the production of a BBC Radio Berkshire documentary on Potts, a reunion occurred between the relatives of the two men at the Imperial War Museum.

In 1967 &quot;The Victor&quot; children&#x27;s magazine told the story very graphically on the front and back covers; it used to feature a story of bravery every week. This article has been used by the Memorial Trust to explain the story at local schools as a graphical presentation; being very much &quot;of its time&quot; appealed to children.

==Memorial in Reading==
During Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions on 20 January 2010, Martin Salter, Member of Parliament for Reading West, indicated that there were plans to provide a permanent memorial to Trooper Potts. It was announced in May 2014 that the memorial would be sited just outside Forbury Gardens, on the open paved area opposite the Crown Court / The Forbury Hotel.

The Trooper Potts VC Memorial Trust was established to raise the necessary funds to build the memorial in 2010, gaining charitable status in 2012. The trust raised the £150,000 required.

Liverpool sculptor Tom Murphy designed the memorial. The life-sized, cast-bronze sculpture was installed on 2 October 2015.

A roll of honour lists the names of 426 men of The Berkshire Yeomanry who gave their lives in the wars of the twentieth century. They are listed by war, by rank and then alphabetically and at the centre is a quote from John F Kennedy.

== Other honours ==
Potts was commemorated in September 2013 in the name of a new road, Trooper Potts Way, created during construction of the Reading Station north entrance. It was unveiled on 5 April 2014.

The Government&#x27;s Commemorative VC Paving Stone was set in the eastern corner of the 1920s War Memorial. It was unveiled in a small ceremony by Trooper Potts&#x27; granddaughter, Anne Ames, at 17:00 on 21 August 2015, the exact centenary of the Berkshire Yeomanry&#x27;s attack on Scimitar Hill.

On 21 March 2016, Greene King opened a new pub/restaurant along Basingstoke Road, to the south of Reading called The Trooper Potts. It featured two very large displays which tell the story of the rescue and Fred and Arthur&#x27;s lives. In 2019 the company changed the name to The Victoria Cross in a &quot;rebrand&quot; in an attempt to distance it with some unfortunate behaviour by users, the décor now features information about the VC winners from across Berkshire.

== Educational outreach ==
In 2011 the trust started to work with the history department of Reading College. Their students have helped the trust by fundraising, joining the committee and teaching to local primary schools about the First World War, Gallipoli and this local story. In 2013 the Trooper Potts prize for History was introduced at the college, it was awarded for 3 years.

Starting in 2013 the Trust has delivered presentations about this Reading story to local groups including; Business groups lunches, pensioner groups, U3A, WEA, WI, Rotary, Round Table, History of Reading Society, Visits Reading and it continues to do so with a booking in 2021.

The trust delivered Trooper Potts mornings at Katesgrove Primary School, Fred Potts&#x27; old school, Southcote Primary School and St Edwards School. The curators of the Berkshire Yeomanry Museum brought along kit of the period for the children to see / try on. Shorter events were run at other schools. In 2018 it delivered sessions to Cub and Brownie groups in Ascot and Staines. The outreach work to schools has continued each year at Katesgrove and Southcote Schools with the occasional new school being added.

== The Victoria Cross ==
The trust commissioned a film of David Callaghan, a former director of Hancocks &amp; Co, the London jewellers which has supplied the VC since it was instituted on 29 January 1856, explaining the history of the Victoria Cross. This is being used in its educational work.

<text>This article lists political parties in Jordan. Jordan has 31 officially registered political parties, but few play a real role because of lack of organization and clear political platforms.

The role of parties is significantly limited by institutional factors as well. The king is vested with somewhat broader executive power than is usually the case for a constitutional monarch, making it difficult for a party to win control of the government solely at the ballot box. Additionally, the electoral system is significantly malapportioned in favor of rural areas.

There is no clear picture on several political parties in Jordan, but sources mention the following parties.

<text>Edward Charles Jones (born October 20, 1971) is an American former professional basketball player who played for five teams in his 14-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career. Jones played college basketball at Temple University and was the 1993–94 Atlantic 10 Player of the Year. He led the &quot;Owls&quot; to the Elite 8 in the NCAA tournament. The three-time NBA All-Star was selected 10th overall in the 1994 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers.

==College career==
Jones played college basketball for Temple from 1991 to 1994. In his junior season, he led them to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament, and in his final season with the Owls he averaged 19.2 points. In 1994, he was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Year.

==Professional career==

===Los Angeles Lakers (1994–1999)===
The Los Angeles Lakers selected Jones with the 10th overall selection in the 1994 NBA draft. Lakers general manager Jerry West stated, &quot;We wanted the best pure athlete available, and Eddie was too good to pass up&quot;.

In his rookie season Jones averaged 14.0 points per game and 2.05 steals per game as he played in 64 games, 58 of which he started. He also led the NBA in steal/turnover ratio (1.75), placed 4th in the NBA Rookie of the Year ballot, and was on the 1994–95 NBA All-Rookie First Team. In the 94–95 All-Star weekend Rookie Challenge he won the MVP, posting a game-high 25 points, 6 steals, and 4 rebounds. With his combination of size, athleticism, and defense, Jones began to draw favorable comparisons to another former Lakers great, Michael Cooper. (Cooper himself said that looking at Jones on the court was like &quot;looking in a mirror.&quot;) Jones would become an integral part of the Lakers squad, along with Nick Van Exel and Cedric Ceballos as the Lakers made the playoffs and upset the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round 3–1 before facing the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs led by league MVP David Robinson. The younger Lakers managed to push the Spurs to six games before losing the series, with Jones averaging 8.7 points off the bench in his first playoff run.

The following year featured Jones solidifying his position as the team&#x27;s starting shooting guard, as Jones started 66 of 70 games and averaged 12.8 points a game for the season. The Lakers improved their total record to 53 wins, bolstered by the midseason return of franchise legend Magic Johnson out of retirement. The Lakers made the playoffs again, but could not defeat the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets, who defeated the Lakers 3–1 in the first round. Jones averaged 17.3 points in the series.

After his second season, Jones switched from number 25 to 6, as the Lakers had retired 25 for Gail Goodrich. He selected 6 as growing up he was a fan of Julius Erving. In the off-season, the team acquired superstar center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, and traded Vlade Divac to the Hornets for rookie guard Kobe Bryant. Jones played and started in 80 games, placing second in the team in scoring with 17.2 points and fourth in the league in steals with 2.4 a game. He also played in his first NBA All-Star Game, scoring 10 points in 17 minutes in the 1997 NBA All-Star Game. Led by O&#x27;Neal, the Lakers won 56 games before defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs, but fell to the top-seeded Utah Jazz in five games in the conference semifinals. Jones struggled in the playoffs, as his scoring average fell to 11.2 in the postseason.

In the 1997–98 season, Jones averaged 16.9 points with 2 steals a game, and scored 15 points with 11 rebounds in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. His pesky defense also earned him a selection to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. The Lakers won 61 games and defeated Portland and Seattle in the first and second round of the playoffs. The team failed to win a game in the conference finals against the Jazz, however, as the veteran team swept the Lakers. Jones averaged 17 points with 2 steals in 13 playoff games.

===Charlotte Hornets (1999–2000)===
The following season would be shortened to 50 games due to a league lockout, with Jones starting the first 20 games of the season before he and Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets for Glen Rice, J. R. Reid, and B. J. Armstrong on March 10, 1999. Jones started in 30 games for the remainder of the season with the Hornets, who did not make the playoffs, but Jones placed second in the league in steals with 2.5 a game and made the All-Defensive team for the second straight year.

Jones&#x27;s following campaign with the Hornets, the 1999–2000 season, was his finest statistically, as he averaged 20.1 points, led the league in total steals (192) and steals per game (2.7) along with 4.2 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game. Jones was also voted to start at guard for the Eastern Conference in the 2000 NBA All-Star Game and scored 10 points in 21 minutes. The Hornets won 49 games and made the playoffs, losing in the first round to the Philadelphia 76ers in four games. At the end of the season, Jones was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the first time and was named to his third straight All-Defensive second team.

Jones became a free agent after the 2000 season, and talked with the Chicago Bulls and Orlando Magic, but wanted to play for his hometown of Miami.

===Miami Heat (2000–2005)===
After re-signing with the Hornets, Jones was traded with Anthony Mason, Ricky Davis and Dale Ellis to the Miami Heat for Otis Thorpe, Rodney Buford, Jamal Mashburn, Tim James and P. J. Brown. Jones&#x27; rerouting was a sign-and-trade. The acquisition of Jones was an attempt by Heat coach Pat Riley to improve his team into a title contender. Before the start of the 2000–01 season however, the team&#x27;s star center Alonzo Mourning was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, meaning Jones would have to carry the team&#x27;s offensive load even more than originally intended. He would go on to play consistently at both ends of the floor, however, averaging 17.4 points a game and leading the team in scoring despite only playing in 63 games for the season. Jones and Mason led the team to 50 wins, and Mourning returned in late March, but the Heat were swept in the first round of the playoffs to the sixth-seeded Hornets, despite Jones averaging 19 points in the three-game series.

Mourning returned to full action in the 2001–02 season, and Jones started 81 games for the team and led in scoring again with 18.3 points a game. The Heat failed to make the playoffs however, and with Mourning&#x27;s disease returning he would be left out of the entire 2002–03 season, forcing Miami to enter a rebuilding phase. Jones only played in 47 contests in the 2003 season due to his own injuries, but once again led the team in scoring with 18.5 points a game. In the off-season, Riley revamped the roster, as Mourning left to join the New Jersey Nets while Miami drafted Dwyane Wade and acquired Lamar Odom from the Los Angeles Clippers to join Jones and second year player Caron Butler. Riley also stepped down as coach just before the season started, with longtime assistant Stan Van Gundy taking the helm.

Despite starting the season 0–7, the 2003–04 season proved to be a success for Miami, with Jones sharing a balanced offensive attack with Wade, Butler and Odom but still leading the team in overall scoring with 17.3 points a game. Jones finished 3rd in the league in total three point field goals, and Miami finished the season with a 42–40 record to make the playoffs with the fourth seed in the East. The Heat would go on to defeat the New Orleans Hornets in a difficult 7-game series in the first round in which the home team won each game, before losing in six games to the top-seeded Indiana Pacers in the conference semifinals. Jones averaged 13.2 in the postseason.

In the off-season prior to the 2004–05 season, Miami made major roster changes, trading Odom and Butler along with center Brian Grant for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Jones&#x27;s old Lakers teammate. Although Jones started the season at the shooting guard position, he would move to the small forward position with Wade taking over as the team&#x27;s starting shooting guard. The result was a blossoming season for Wade combined with the dominating presence of O&#x27;Neal. Jones saw his scoring output dip to 12.7 points a game, but he remained a crucial 3 point shooting option for Miami as the team won 59 games and the top seed in the Eastern Conference. Near the end of the season the Heat also brought back Alonzo Mourning, and the team would sweep New Jersey and the Washington Wizards in the playoffs before facing the defending NBA champion Detroit Pistons. The Heat took a 3–2 series lead after five games, but faced difficulties with an injury to Wade, and the Pistons rallied to win game 6 in Detroit and game 7 in Miami. Jones averaged 13.7 points throughout the playoffs.

===Memphis Grizzlies (2005–2007)===
Miami was disappointed to have just missed a chance to make the NBA Finals, and Riley decided to part ways with Jones after five seasons as he was dealt to the Memphis Grizzlies for James Posey and Jason Williams on August 2, 2005, in a record five-team, thirteen-player trade. On November 4, 2005, Jones scored a game-leading 25 points as the Grizzlies beat the Orlando Magic 94–85. His first season in Memphis, Jones started in 75 games in total, averaging 11.8 points with 1.7 steals a game as the Grizzlies made the playoffs but were swept in the first round by the Dallas Mavericks. Jones started in 14 of 29 games the following year for the Grizzlies, before getting waived by the team on January 30, 2007.

===Return to Miami (2007)===
On February 1, 2007, Jones signed a minimum contract for his second stint with the Miami Heat, playing increasing minutes after Wade&#x27;s shoulder injury. The Heat had won the NBA title the previous year, but struggled throughout the season with injuries to Wade, as Miami fell in a four-game sweep to the Chicago Bulls in the first round.

===Dallas Mavericks (2007–2008)===
After the 2006–07 season ended, Jones became an unrestricted free agent. On August 3, 2007, Jones agreed to a two-year deal with the Dallas Mavericks.

On October 10, 2008, Jones was traded to the Indiana Pacers. After being traded to the Pacers, Jones had his contract renegotiated which enabled him to pursue playing for another team or retire. On October 16, 2008, he was released from the Pacers in order for them to free up cap room.

==Media and endorsements==

Jones appeared in a comical Taco Bell commercial that features several people who were related to the Lakers organization at the time. The commercial focuses on Shaquille O&#x27;Neal suffering from Taco Neck Syndrome. Along with Michael Finley, Jones appeared in a commercial for the Air Jordan XVI.

Jones was the cover athlete for the 989 Sports basketball game &quot;NBA ShootOut &#x27;97&quot;. He was also one of the original players chosen to endorse Air Jordan, and wear the &quot;Jordan XI&quot;. Jones appeared on the sitcom &quot;In the House&quot;.

On June 8, 2009, Jones was featured in the Spike TV show called &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;. As one of the pros, he was teamed with his former Miami Heat teammates Alonzo Mourning and Antoine Walker.

==Personal life==
Jones and his wife Trina have three children together. Jones is the cousin of Jalen Suggs of the Orlando Magic and Tyrese Haliburton of the Indiana Pacers.

<text>Martinique is not a separate territory but a region of France. France has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

For further details see the article: &quot;Politics of France&quot;.

==The parties==
Most of the French political parties are active in Martinique.

In addition there are a number of regional parties:

* Martinican Independence Movement (&quot;Mouvement Indépendantiste Martiniquais&quot;, MIM)
* Martinican Progressive Party (&quot;Parti Progressiste Martiniquais&quot;, PPM)
* Build the Martinique Country (&quot;Batir le Pays Martinique&quot;)
* Martinican Communist Party (&quot;Parti Communiste Martiniquais&quot;, PCM) close to PCF
* Péyi-A, affiliated with NUPES

===Local factions of French parties===

* Socialist Federation of Martinique (&quot;Fédération socialiste de Martinique&quot;, FSM) close to PS
* Worker&#x27;s Combat (&quot;Combat Ouvrier&quot;, CO) close to Workers&#x27; Struggle

<doc id="1223959" wikidata="Q1385061" url="?curid=1223959" title="Frank Adams">
<text>John Frank Adams (5 November 1930 – 7 January 1989) was a British mathematician, one of the major contributors to homotopy theory.

==Life==
He was born in Woolwich, a suburb in south-east London, and attended Bedford School. He began his academic career at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a student of Abram Besicovitch, but soon switched to algebraic topology. He received his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1956. His thesis, written under the direction of Shaun Wylie, was titled &quot;On spectral sequences and self-obstruction invariants&quot;. He held the Fielden Chair at the University of Manchester (1964–1970), and became Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at the University of Cambridge (1970–1989). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1964.

His interests included mountaineering—he would demonstrate how to climb right round a table at parties (a Whitney traverse)—and the game of Go.

He died in a car crash in Brampton. There is a memorial plaque for him in the Chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Work==
In the 1950s, homotopy theory was at an early stage of development, and unsolved problems abounded. Adams made a number of important theoretical advances in algebraic topology, but his innovations were always motivated by specific problems. Influenced by the French school of Henri Cartan and Jean-Pierre Serre, he reformulated and strengthened their method of killing homotopy groups in spectral sequence terms, creating the basic tool of stable homotopy theory now known as the Adams spectral sequence. This begins with Ext groups calculated over the ring of cohomology operations, which is the Steenrod algebra in the classical case. He used this spectral sequence to attack the celebrated Hopf invariant one problem, which he completely solved in a 1960 paper by making a deep analysis of secondary cohomology operations. The Adams–Novikov spectral sequence is an analogue of the Adams spectral sequence using an extraordinary cohomology theory in place of classical cohomology: it is a computational tool of great potential scope.

Adams was also a pioneer in the application of K-theory. He invented the Adams operations in K-theory, which are derived from the exterior powers; they are now also widely used in purely algebraic contexts. Adams introduced them in a 1962 paper to solve the famous vector fields on spheres problem. Subsequently he used them to investigate the Adams conjecture, which is concerned (in one instance) with the image of the J-homomorphism in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. A later paper of Adams and Michael F. Atiyah uses the Adams operations to give an extremely elegant and much faster version of the above-mentioned Hopf invariant one result.

In 1974 Adams became the first recipient of the Senior Whitehead Prize, awarded by the London Mathematical Society. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1957–58.

Adams had many talented students, and was highly influential in the development of algebraic topology in Britain and worldwide. His University of Chicago lectures were published in a 1996 series titled &quot;Chicago Lectures in Mathematics Series&quot;, such as &quot;Lectures on Exceptional Lie Groups&quot; and &quot;Stable Homotopy and Generalised Homology&quot; .

==Recognition==
The main mathematics research seminar room in the Alan Turing Building at the University of Manchester is named in his honour.

<doc id="1223972" wikidata="Q277156" url="?curid=1223972" title="Jesu (band)">
<text>Jesu (pronounced &quot;yay-zoo&quot;) are a British experimental metal band formed in 2003 by Justin Broadrick following the breakup of his band Godflesh. It shares its name with the last song on &quot;Hymns&quot;, the final album of Godflesh&#x27;s initial run. Jesu&#x27;s sound is heavily layered and textured, incorporating a diverse mix of influences. Broadrick himself has stated that &quot;...it&#x27;s very loosely speaking pop/rock/metal/electronica ... I&#x27;m intentionally writing what I consider to be coherent &#x27;pop&#x27; songs&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== 2004–2008 ===
Jesu&#x27;s first release, the &quot;Heart Ache&quot; EP, was released in 2004 and featured Broadrick performing all of the instruments and vocals alone. It was followed four months later by the full-length &quot;Jesu&quot; LP, which featured the addition of bassist Diarmuid Dalton and drummer Ted Parsons, although not every song features both members. A tour of Europe, in support of the album, featured Roderic Mounir of Knut filling in for Ted Parsons on drums. Commenting on the sonic influences of the band, Broadrick said: &quot;I really wanted to take that rhythm and weld it to the Godflesh sensibilities of abstract, surreal, mutated metal.&quot;

With their third release, 2006&#x27;s four song &quot;Silver&quot; EP, Jesu took a more melodic and layered approach, gaining comparison to shoegazing band My Bloody Valentine. The majority of this release features Broadrick and Dalton, with Parsons joining them for the title track.

The full lineup recorded the second full-length album, &quot;Conqueror&quot;, which was released in February 2007. Broadrick and Dalton recorded the &quot;Sun Down/Sun Rise&quot; EP without Parsons for a 23 April release. This EP had already seen release in Japan where it had been packaged as a bonus CD for the &quot;Conqueror&quot; album. Jesu returned as a solo act with the release of a split 12&quot; album with Eluvium, released on 5 July 2007.

October 2007 saw the release of &quot;Pale Sketches&quot;, a collection of previously unreleased Jesu songs, performed entirely by Broadrick and recorded between 2000 and 2007. The album was released on Broadrick&#x27;s own label, Avalanche. That same month, a four-song EP titled &quot;Lifeline&quot;, once again featuring Broadrick as the sole member, was released by Hydra Head in the United States and Daymare in Japan. The band made their United States live debut in March 2007 as an opening act for Isis, although work permit problems caused them to miss the first three weeks of the tour. Neither Parsons nor Dalton were able to participate in the tour and were temporarily replaced by Danny Walker (of Intronaut) and long-time Broadrick collaborator Dave Cochrane (Head of David, God, Ice), respectively. During this tour, Jesu also made their South by Southwest debut as part of a Hydra Head Records showcase.

In late 2007 the band embarked on headlining tours of the United Kingdom, Japan, Europe and the United States. During this tour, Phil Petrocelli of Seattle band, Black Noise Cannon, took over as the band&#x27;s touring drummer. Jesu released their second split release, this time with Japanese post-rock band, Envy, exclusively in Japan through Daymare Records on 11 July 2008. On 12 August 2008, a third split 12&quot;, this time with Battle of Mice, was engineered by Joel Hamilton and released by Robotic Empire. The album had originally been announced in 2006 but was delayed while awaiting cover art.

On 9 September 2008 Hydra Head released &quot;Why Are We Not Perfect&quot;, a CDEP featuring the three Jesu songs previously only available on the Eluvium split vinyl album, as well as two new remixes. Daymare released the album, in Japan, with an additional third remix not available on the American release. On 23 September 2008 Dwell Records released &quot;Like Black Holes in The Sky: The Tribute to Syd Barrett&quot; which features Jesu covering Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Chapter 24.&quot; Jesu also contributed a cover version of The Cure&#x27;s &quot;The Funeral Party&quot; to Manimal Vinyl&#x27;s &quot;Perfect As Cats: A Tribute to The Cure&quot;. The album was released digitally through iTunes on 28 October 2008. The CD edition of the album was released in stores on 25 November 2008, in a limited edition of 2,000 copies.

In March 2009 Broadrick announced a new one-song LP, titled &quot;Infinity&quot;, scheduled for release through his own Avalanche Recordings label in June 2009, although he later announced it was certain to be released in July. &quot;Infinity&quot; was made available to purchase through Broadrick&#x27;s Avalanche Recording webstore on 23 July. On 29 July Broadrick made the album available via digital download. The album consists of one track, lasting approximately 50 minutes, performed entirely by Broadrick. On 19 August 2009 Daymare released the &quot;Infinity&quot; album as a two-disc set featuring an extra track as well as a re-release of &quot;Pale Sketches&quot;, containing a second disc featuring three new remixes.

=== 2009–present ===
Broadrick also announced that a new EP, titled &quot;Opiate Sun&quot;, would be released in July 2009. The EP had originally been mentioned in 2008 but a title and official release date had yet to be announced. &quot;Opiate Sun&quot; was later rescheduled for 27 October 2009, and was released on Mark Kozelek&#x27;s record label Caldo Verde. The Daymare edition of the album was released on 6 November 2009 in Japan and includes a &quot;demo&quot; version of one of the four songs as a bonus track. Initially, the EP was intended to be the first studio recording to include the lineup of Justin Broadrick, Dave Cochrane and Phil Petrocelli. This lineup was to be featured on two of the four tracks, with the classic lineup of Broadrick, Parsons and Dalton performing the other two tracks. The released version of the album features Broadick performing solo on all four tracks.

In June 2009, Hydra Head re-released the Jesu/Envy split 12&quot; on CD. The label also released a double 10&quot; vinyl edition in September 2009. On 16 November 2010 Hydra Head released &quot;Heart Ache/Dethroned&quot;, which featured a reissue of the &quot;Heart Ache&quot; EP, packaged with &quot;Dethroned&quot;, a previously unreleased Jesu EP from 2003.

In March 2010, Broadrick stated that he felt that Jesu had strayed further away from the guitar driven music that he intended it to be and more into electronica. Broadrick further stated that while Jesu would continue to contain electronic elements, it would return to a guitar driven sound and a new project, named Pale Sketcher, would allow Broadrick to continue exploring the electronica oriented sound without interfering with Jesu. Jesu released two albums after 2010, &quot;Ascension&quot; (2011), &quot;Everyday I Get Closer to the Light from Which I Came&quot; (2013).

In January 2016, Broadrick, as Jesu, collaborated with Mark Kozelek&#x27;s folk rock project, Sun Kil Moon to record an album titled &quot;Jesu/Sun Kil Moon&quot; and the collaborative act toured in support of the album. Jesu and Sun Kil Moon collaborated once again to record a cover of &quot;Condor Ave&quot; for an Elliott Smith tribute album titled &quot;Say Yes!&quot;, released in October 2016. A second album by Jesu and Sun Kil Moon, titled &quot;30 Seconds to the Decline of Planet Earth&quot;, was released in May 2017.

On July 3, 2020, Jesu released the five-track &quot;Never&quot; EP digitally through Bandcamp. A new full-length, titled &quot;Terminus&quot;, was released through the same outlet on November 13, 2020.

Broadrick works from a studio in Abergele, Wales.

== Remixes ==
Using the Jesu name, Broadrick has also contributed remixed versions of songs by such bands as Mogwai, N.I.C., Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Explosions in the Sky, Interpol, Isis, Pelican, Earth, Cult of Luna, Fog, Maninkari, Pyramids, Yakuza, Genghis Tron, Jack Colwell, Challenger, Constants and Isaurian.

<text>Derbyshire Constabulary is the territorial police force responsible for policing the county of Derbyshire, England. The force covers an area of over with a population of just under one million.

==History==

In 1965, the force had an establishment of 852 and an actual strength of 775.

=== Chief constables ===
* 1873unknown: Francis Joseph Parry
* 18761898: Lieutenant-Colonel William Addis Delacombe
* 1898unknown: Capt. Henry Mansfield Haywood
* 1918: Major Philip Francis Ross Anley
* 19541967: William Ewart Pitts
* 19671979: Sir Walter Stansfield (knighted 1979 New Year Honours)
* 19791981: James Fryer
* 19811985: Alfred Parrish
* 19851990: Alan Smith
* 19902000: John Newing
* 20012007: David Coleman
* 20072017: Mick Creedon
* 20172020: Peter Goodman
* 2020present: Rachel Swann

===Officers killed in the line of duty===

The Police Roll of Honour Trust and Police Memorial Trust list and commemorate all British police officers killed in the line of duty. Since its establishment in 1984, the Police Memorial Trust has erected 50 memorials nationally to some of those officers.

Since 1828 the following officers of Derbyshire Constabulary were killed while attempting to prevent or stop a crime in progress:
* Parish Constable William Taylor, 1828 (fatally injured arresting two men)
* Police Constable Joseph Moss, 1879 (shot whilst dealing with a prisoner)
* Police Constable Stevenson, 2013 (collapsed and died while on duty)

==Organisation and structure==

To police the county the force is divided into two territorial divisions, based respectively in the towns of Buxton and Chesterfield (North Division – covering High Peak and Derbyshire Dales District Council areas, Chesterfield, NE Derbyshire, Amber Valley and Bolsover and the villages of South Normanton and Pinxton which lie within the boundaries of Bolsover District Council), and Derby ( South Division – policing the city of Derby and the districts of Erewash, Long Eaton and South Derbyshire). The Force Headquarters, near Ripley and close to the A38 road, is Butterley Hall, former residence of Benjamin Outram and once owned by the Butterley Company.

The Old Hall and later additional buildings in the large grounds house much of the force&#x27;s central administrative services. The Ops Divisions HQ at Wyatts Way Ripley (adjacent to force Headquarters) is now the home of Operational Support Division which encompasses the Road Policing Unit (with bases at Cotton Lane in Derby, Beetwell Street in Chesterfield and Chapel-en-le-Frith), ARU (Armed Response Unit), Dog Section, Uniform Task Force and Road Policing Support (Collision Investigators). 
The Constabulary is led by the chief constable assisted by a Deputy and two assistant chief constables. Each division is headed by a chief superintendent – the divisional commander – and each division is divided into Sections, which are led by an inspector. The force has an authorised establishment of 1,827 police officers, 350 special constables and 104 Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs)

The chief officers of the force formerly worked in partnership with the 17 publicly elected representatives on the Derbyshire Police Authority, which shared responsibility for budgets and policy, and was intended to ensure that the public of Derbyshire had a voice in the policing of their county. 
Since the introduction of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 the Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) is now responsible for tasks that were once completed by the Police Authority. In November 2012, Alan Charles was elected as PCC for a four-year term. Charles previously served as Vice Chair of the Derbyshire Police Authority.

==PEEL inspection==
His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In its latest PEEL inspection, Derbyshire Constabulary was rated as follows:

==Regionalisation==
Proposals were made by the Home Secretary on 20 March 2006 to integrate groups of police forces in England and Wales into &#x27;strategic&#x27; forces, which he saw as being more &#x27;fit for purpose&#x27; in terms of combating terrorism and organised crime. Under these proposals Derbyshire would have merged with nearby forces to create an &#x27;East Midlands Police&#x27;. However, these proposals were unpopular and were later cancelled.

<text>This article lists political parties in the Northern Mariana Islands. 
The Northern Marianas has a multi-party system, with two or three strong parties and a third party that is electorally successful. As of 28 April, 2024, The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are the only two parties represented in elected and appointed offices, though the independents are a majority in the house and make up one-third of the senate.

The Covenant Party was a political party advocating governmental and financial reform. It was named after the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, Act of Mar. 24, 1976, Pub. L. 94-241, 90 Stat. 263, &quot;codified as amended at&quot; 48 U.S.C. § 1801 note. The Covenant Party is considered de facto dissolved when Governor Eloy Inos departed the party and rejoined the GOP in 2013. Many left the party soon after, most moving to the Republic Party, making it a de facto GOP absorption of the Covenant Party. 

The Reform Party was a political party that was not an affiliate of the Reform Party USA but rather the American Reform Party, a splinter group of that party. The party was founded in 1999 by former Governor Froilan C. Tenorio, who claimed to be disgruntled and tired of the disunity showed by his former political affiliation, the Democrats. In 2002, the party merged back into the Democratic Party.

<doc id="1223977" wikidata="Q6634235" url="?curid=1223977" title="List of political parties in Palau">
<text>Palau currently has no political parties. It is a de facto non-partisan democracy and no law prevents the formation of political parties. Political scientist Wouter Veenendaal states that &quot;according to various sources the Palauan political environment is primarily determined by clan membership and inter- and intra-clan relationships, which according to Larry Gerston essentially assume the role of political parties&quot;.

The Palau Nationalist Party, which functioned mainly as an electoral vehicle as opposed to an ideological movement, was founded for the 1996 elections. It is believed to no longer exist.

The Ta Belau Party was formed in 1987, and likewise is not currently active. It supported the presidency of Lazarus Salii, who committed suicide while in office in 1988.

<text>The following political parties, listed in alphabetic order, have taken part in recent elections for the Palestinian National Authority in the Palestinian territories:

==Brief history and overview==
In 1994, The Palestinian Authority was formed, the governing body for the interim period pending final status negotiations. The President of the State of Palestine is the highest-ranking political position, the equivalent to head of state, in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The President is elected by popular elections. The Palestinian Legislative Council is the legislature of the Palestinian Authority. It is not to be confused with the Palestinian National Council, which remains the national legislature of the Palestinian people as a whole. The PLC passed a new law in June 2005 increasing the number of MPs from 88 to 132, stipulating that half be elected under a system of proportional representation and half by traditional constituencies.

<doc id="1223981" wikidata="Q945436" url="?curid=1223981" title="Sonni Ali">
<text>Sunni Ali, also known as Si Ali, Sunni Ali Ber (Ber meaning &quot;the Great&quot;), reigned from about 1464 to 1492 as the 15th ruler of the Sunni dynasty of the Songhai Empire. He transformed the relatively small state into an empire by conquering Timbuktu, Massina, the Inner Niger Delta, and Djenne.

==Early life==
Sunni Ali was born the son of Sonni Muhammad Da&#x27;o, who appears in the kinglists of the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; and &quot;Tarikh al-Fattash&quot; as the 10th Sonni ruler. His mother was from Fara, an area that was still heavily pagan, and Ali was raised in this milieu. As a Sonni, he also received an Islamic education, but practiced a syncretic, unorthodox faith.

==Reign==
Upon Sunni Ali&#x27;s accession, the Songhay already controlled the Niger river basin from Dendi to Mema. His first major conquest was the ancient city of Timbuktu. Controlled by the Tuaregs since the Malian retreat a few decades earlier, in 1469 the Timbuktu-koi &#x27;Umar asked for Songhai protection. He conducted a repressive policy against the scholars of Timbuktu who he saw as associated with the Tuareg.

Sunni Ali organized a powerful fleet on the Niger river, and in 1473 used it to lay siege to Djenne, which surrendered only after being reduced to starvation. In order to bring his fleet to bear in an attempt to conquer Walata, he tried to dig a canal hundreds of kilometers to the town from Ras el Ma. In 1483 he had to abandon this project, however, to defeat an invasion by the Mossi people. He also conquered the lands of the Sanhaja called Nunu. He conquered the lands of Kunta and was determined to seize the lands of Borgu but was unable to.

===Domestic policies===
In addition to external enemies, Sunni Ali fought campaigns against the Fulani of Massina and other nomadic peoples raiding within his borders. His main capital was Gao, but he was also based at Kukiya, Kabara, and Tindirma at different times depending on where he was campaigning. Sunni Ali ruled over both urban Muslims and rural non-Muslims at a time when the traditional co-existence of different beliefs was being challenged. His adherence to African animism while also Islam leads some writers to describe him as outwardly or Muslim. Funeal stelae from Kukiya, however, cast some doubt on the chroniclers criticism of Sunni Ali, as they were writing on behalf of the Askias who had overthrown the Sunni dynasty.

==Death and succession==
His death, on November 6, 1492, is a matter of conjecture. According to the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;, Ali drowned while crossing the Niger River. Oral tradition believes he was killed by his sister&#x27;s son, Askia Muhammad Ture. Sonni Ali&#x27;s son, Sunni Baru, was immediately proclaimed king of Songhay by the army commanders, but he was challenged by Askia because Baru was not seen as a faithful Muslim. Askia eventually defeated Sunni Baru and took power.

<text>Marvel Comics 2 was an imprint from Marvel Comics whose comic books depict an alternative future timeline for the Marvel Universe. The imprint was spun off from the events of &quot;What If?&quot; #105 (February 1998), which was the first appearance of the character Spider-Girl, Spider-Man&#x27;s daughter from an alternative future. This Earth has been designated as Earth-982.

==Publication history==

The MC2 Universe was conceived by writer/editor Tom DeFalco as a possible alternate future for the Marvel Universe, set in the present day, with the first appearances of most Marvel heroes having taken place fifteen years earlier than in main continuity. The goal of the line was to produce comic books that were more accessible to a wider audience than Marvel&#x27;s main line of books and weren&#x27;t entrenched in years of continuity, which was later repeated with the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; imprint.

Three MC2 titles were launched in October 1998 as twelve-issue maxiseries:
*&quot;Spider-Girl&quot;, starring the daughter of Spider-Man.
*&quot;A-Next&quot;, featuring a new team of Avengers who come together after the original Avengers disbanded.
*&quot;J2&quot;, starring the Juggernaut&#x27;s son, a heroic teenager.

&quot;A-Next&quot; and &quot;J2&quot; ended after twelve issues and were replaced by:
*&quot;Fantastic Five&quot;, featuring the expanded Fantastic Four.
*&quot;Wild Thing&quot;, starring Wolverine and Elektra&#x27;s daughter.

&quot;Spider-Girl&quot; meanwhile continued publication. However, with the collapse of a deal to sell the comics in Kmart and Target both &quot;Fantastic Five&quot; and &quot;Wild Thing&quot; were canceled after five issues, leaving &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; as the only title in the MC2 Universe still published. A few spin-off limited series were launched during the time Spider-Girl was published, such as &quot;Darkdevil&quot; and &quot;Spider-Girl Presents The Buzz&quot;.

The Spider-Girl title was nearly canceled several times due to low sales. Each time, campaigns by Tom DeFalco and fans of the title prevented cancelation. Fans created a webpage, savespidergirl.com, to help drum up support for the book. In an effort to boost sales on the title, Marvel reprinted &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; in small &quot;Digest-sized&quot; trade paperbacks.

A five-issue limited series set in the MC2 Universe titled &quot;Last Hero Standing&quot; was printed. In 2006, Marvel released another limited series set in the MC2 Universe titled &quot;Last Planet Standing&quot;. The series was intended to wrap up all the loose ends in the MC2 Universe and destroy it at the series&#x27; conclusion. As a result, &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; was slated to be canceled at issue 100, where the character would die. Due to backlash from DeFalco and fans, Marvel quashed the move and announced the relaunching of &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; under the title of &quot;Amazing Spider-Girl&quot;. The &quot;Amazing&quot; title lasted until early 2009, when the book was again canceled due to low sales. A third title, &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot;, was then launched. Initially a digital exclusive, the &quot;Spectacular&quot; book was incorporated into the &quot;Amazing Spider-Man Family&quot; anthology magazine. After &quot;Amazing Spider-Man Family&quot; and its successor, &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot;, folded, a final four-issue &quot;Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot; mini-series was produced, allowing many of the long-running plot threads from the book to be tied up. The final MC2-oriented story to date, a one-shot called &quot;Spider-Girl: The End&quot;, was published in 2010, which gave the title character a happy ending while leaving the door open for further adventures.

In 2008, a prequel strip, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man&quot;, was launched in the pages of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man Family&quot;. DeFalco confirmed on the official Spider-Girl boards that this strip would serve as the definitive continuity of the MC2 Spider-Man timeline. However, the &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man&quot; strips were quickly ended so the &quot;Spider-Man Family&quot; title could make room for the relaunched Spider-Girl book.

American Dream has appeared in both her own 2008 limited series and the 2011 five-issue limited series &quot;Captain America Corps&quot;, marking the first time an MC2 character has met or teamed up with characters from the mainstream Marvel universe.

Spider-Girl returned in the Spider-Verse storyline in 2014. During the story, it was revealed that when she traveled back in time to meet Spider-Man in his youth in her original series, she had entered Earth-616, the mainstream Marvel universe, before the point which it branched out into the MC2 universe. Her father, however, unfortunately died protecting May and Benjy from Daemos. As Daemos drained Peter&#x27;s life force, May fled with Ben in her arms. Upon May&#x27;s return home, Mary Jane passes Peter&#x27;s former costume down to her, though Mayday eventually begins wearing a new outfit and eventually returns to her old one. Following Spider-Geddon it is revealed that the Multiversal entity known as The Other has chosen and sought Peter as its host, thus resurrecting him.

The MC2 Universe also appears in the Secret Wars event in the Spider-Island tie-in backup.

<text>Réunion is not a separate territory but a region of France. France has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

For further details see the article: Politics of France.

==The parties==
Most of the French political parties are active in Réunion.

In addition there are the following regional parties:

* Communist Party of Réunion (&quot;Parti communiste réunionnais&quot;, or PCR)
*For Réunion (&quot;Pour La Réunion&quot;)
*Le Progrès

<doc id="1223992" wikidata="Q5498859" url="?curid=1223992" title="Frederick Thornton Peters">
<text>Acting Captain Frederick Thornton &quot;Fritz&quot; Peters, &amp; Bar (17 September 1889 – 13 November 1942) was a Canadian-born sailor in the Royal Navy and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Peters&#x27; parents were Frederick Peters (Premier of Prince Edward Island, 1891–1897) and Roberta Hamilton Susan Gray (daughter of John Hamilton Gray, who was Premier of Prince Edward Island at the time of the Charlottetown Conference of 1864). He was educated at St. Peter&#x27;s School on Prince Edward Island, at school in British Columbia and at Naval College in England. Two of Peters&#x27; brothers died in action on the Western Front during the First World War—John Francklyn Peters in April 1915 and Gerald Hamilton Peters in June 1916.

Peters entered the Royal Navy as naval cadet in 1905 and began the First World War as a lieutenant. He retired in 1920 at the age of thirty as a lieutenant-commander, having won the Distinguished Service Order and the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) during the war. Peters then split his time between Britain, Canada and the Gold Coast.

==Second World War==
In October 1939 Peters re-volunteered for Royal Navy service. He was made the commander of an anti-submarine flotilla. In 1940 he was awarded a Bar to his DSC and was later appointed acting captain for special services.

Peters was 53 years old, and an acting captain in the Royal Navy during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

Operation Reservist (part of Operation Torch, the Allied landings in French North Africa) was an attempt to capture Oran Harbour, Algeria and prevent it from being sabotaged by its French garrison. The two sloops and were packed with British Commandos, soldiers of the 6th United States Armored Infantry Regiment and a small detachment of United States Marines.

On 8 November 1942 Captain Peters, commanding in &quot;Walney&quot;, led his force through the boom towards the jetty in the face of point-blank fire from shore batteries, the sloop , and the destroyer . Blinded in one eye, he alone of 11 officers and men on the bridge survived. Besides him, 13 ratings survived &quot;Walney&quot; sinking. The destroyer reached the jetty disabled and ablaze and went down with her colours flying. Captain Peters and a handful of men managed to reach the shore, where they were taken prisoner. &quot;Hartland&quot; came under fire from the and blew up with the loss of half her crew. The survivors, like those of &quot;Walney&quot;, were taken prisoner as they reached shore.

Captain Peters was also awarded the United States Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Cross for the same actions. The citation, issued in Allied Force Headquarters General Orders No. 19 23 November 1942, stated that:
The survivors were released on 10 November 1942 when the French garrison surrendered. In the meantime, the French systematically destroyed the harbour facilities at Oran: Operation Reservist was thus a complete failure.

In addition to his service with the Royal Navy, Fritz worked with British Naval Intelligence and advised Prime Minister Winston Churchill. British double agent Kim Philby noted his admiration for Secret Intelligence Service instruction leader &quot;Commander Peters&quot; in his book &quot;My Silent War&quot;.

==Death==
Captain Peters was killed in an air crash three days after his release, on 13 November 1942. He was coming back to Britain in a Sunderland flying boat, which crash-landed in Plymouth Sound in thick fog, at the entrance to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Devonport Dockyard, near Plymouth, Devon. In spite of efforts by the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Wynton Thorpe, RAAF, who held on to him for ninety minutes in the water, he was dead when the rescue launch reached them. He has no known grave and is remembered on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial, (Panel 61. Column 3) Hampshire, England.

Mount Peters near Nelson, British Columbia, where his mother lived in her last years with the family of her daughter Helen Dewdney and her husband E.E.L. Dewdney, was named in his honour in 1946. A display of photos and panels on his life is on the main floor of the Daniel J. MacDonald Building in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. His name, along with the names of his three brothers who served in the First World War, is on memorial plaques in the St. Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church in Charlottetown.

In 2012, a biography by Peters&#x27; great-nephew Sam McBride, based on family letters and titled &quot;The Bravest Canadian – Fritz Peters VC: The Making of a Hero of Two World Wars&quot;, was published by Granville Island Publishing.

<doc id="1224001" wikidata="Q5201162" url="?curid=1224001" title="Cyrus Wesley Peck">
<text>Cyrus Wesley Peck &amp; Bar (26 April 1871 – 27 September 1956) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. 

Peck was one of the seven Canadians to be awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions on one single day, 2 September 1918, for actions across the 30 km long Drocourt-Quéant Line near Arras, France. The other six were Bellenden Hutcheson, Arthur George Knight, William Metcalf, Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney, Walter Leigh Rayfield and John Francis Young.

==Early life==
Cyrus Wesley Peck was born in Hopewell Hill, New Brunswick to a family that had emigrated from New England in 1763. His puritan ancestors include the Peck and Brewster families. 

Peck was 16 years old when his father moved the family to New Westminster, British Columbia. 

==Militia==
Peck joined the Canadian Militia in the late 1880s, serving with the 5th British Columbia Garrison Artillery. In the mid-1890s, he travelled to Ontario and lived there for several years. 

In 1894, Peck enlisted as a Private in the 43rd Ottawa and Carleton Rifles in Ottawa. He attended the militia training and instructional courses in Levis and Toronto, and was promoted to Sergeant and musketry instructor in 1896. In late 1896 he travelled to England to join the British Army was not selected for service and he returned home to Canada. He travelled to BC and in 1900 joined the 6th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own Rifles, but soon left to move for the Klondike. He and his cousin opened a canning business in Port Essington, near the Skeena River, in 1903. He later moved to Prince Rupert and worked in a salmon cannery. 

In 1914, he helped raise the 68th Earl Grey’s Own Rifles and served as Colonel of the regiment.

== First World War ==
He went overseas in 1914 as a Major in the 30th Battalion. Then in May 1915 Peck joined as a lieutenant colonel in the 16th (Canadian Scottish) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was 47 years old. He became the commanding officer of the Regiment during the Battle of the Somme (1916). Peck was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in the 1917 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours; a Bar to the DSO, for which the citation in the London Gazette read, &quot;During an attack he showed fine courage and leadership. He led his battalion, under difficulties caused by heavy mist, to its final objective, nearly three miles, after severe fighting. He personally led his men in an attack on nests of machine guns protecting the enemy&#x27;s guns, which he captured. Some of the guns were of 8-inch calibre.&quot;; was Mentioned in Despatches five times; and was wounded twice.

On 2 September 1918 at Cagnicourt, France (the Drocourt-Queant Line), when Lieutenant Colonel Peck&#x27;s command, after capturing the first objective, was held up by enemy machine-gun fire, he went forward and made a personal reconnaissance under very heavy fire. Returning, he reorganized his battalion and pushed them forward. He then went out, under the most intense artillery and machine-gun fire and intercepted the tanks, giving them the necessary directions, pointing out where they were to make for, and thus paving the way for an infantry battalion to push forward. To this battalion he subsequently gave the necessary support. The full citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 12 November 1918 (dated 15 November 1918):

==Later life==

In 1917 he was a soldier candidate elected in the khaki election of 1917. He was elected in 1917 as a Unionist for the riding of Skeena. He was defeated in 1921. In 1924, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for the riding of The Islands. A member of the British Columbia Conservative Party, he was reelected in 1928. He did not seek a third term in the 1933 provincial election.

In 1930, the Gulf Islands Ferry Company purchased the Canadian Pacific car ferry Island Princess and renamed it &quot;MV Cy Peck&quot; in honour of Peck, who was also the local MLA. The &quot;MV Cy Peck&quot; remained in service until 1966.

Following his political career he was appointed to the Canadian Pension Commission and held this post until 1941.

During the Second World War, Peck commanded the Vancouver Island Division of the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers. He served as Lieutenant-Colonel from 1942 to 1945. 

He died 27 September 1956 of a heart attack and is buried at New Westminster Crematorium, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

A plaque inside the House of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario is dedicated to Lieutenant Colonel Cyrus Wesley Peck.

<text>The Heck reaction (also called the Mizoroki–Heck reaction) is the chemical reaction of an unsaturated halide (or triflate) with an alkene in the presence of a base and a palladium catalyst to form a substituted alkene. It is named after Tsutomu Mizoroki and Richard F. Heck. Heck was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which he shared with Ei-ichi Negishi and Akira Suzuki, for the discovery and development of this reaction. This reaction was the first example of a carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction that followed a Pd(0)/Pd(II) catalytic cycle, the same catalytic cycle that is seen in other Pd(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. The Heck reaction is a way to substitute alkenes.

==History==
The original reaction by Tsutomu Mizoroki (1971) describes the coupling between iodobenzene and styrene in methanol to form stilbene at 120 °C (autoclave) with potassium acetate base and palladium chloride catalysis. This work was an extension of earlier work by Fujiwara (1967) on the Pd(II)-mediated coupling of arenes (Ar–H) and alkenes and earlier work by Heck (1969) on the coupling of arylmercuric halides (ArHgCl) with alkenes using a stoichiometric amount of a palladium(II) species.

In 1972 Heck acknowledged the Mizoroki publication and detailed &quot;independently discovered&quot; work. Heck&#x27;s reaction conditions differ in terms of the catalyst (palladium acetate), catalyst loading (0.01 eq.), base (hindered amine), and absence of solvent.

In 1974 Heck showed that phosphine ligands facilitated the reaction.
==Catalyst and substrates==
The reaction is catalyzed by palladium complexes. Typical catalysts and precatalysts include tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), palladium chloride, and palladium(II) acetate. Typical supporting ligands are triphenylphosphine, PHOX, and BINAP. Typical bases are triethylamine, potassium carbonate, and sodium acetate.

The aryl electrophile can be a halide (Br, Cl) or a triflate as well as benzyl or vinyl halides. The alkene must contain at least one sp2-C-H bond. Electron-withdrawing substituents enhance the reaction, thus acrylates are ideal.

== Reaction mechanism ==
The mechanism of this vinylation involves organopalladium intermediates. The required palladium(0) compound is often generated in situ from a palladium(II) precursor.

For instance, palladium(II) acetate is reduced by triphenylphosphine to bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (1) concomitant with oxidation of triphenylphosphine to triphenylphosphine oxide. Step A is an oxidative addition in which palladium inserts itself in the aryl-bromide bond. The resulting palladium(II) complex then binds alkene (3). In step B the alkene inserts into the Pd-C bond in a syn addition step. Step C involves a beta-hydride elimination (here the arrows are showing the opposite) with the formation of a new palladium - alkene π complex (5). This complex is destroyed in the next step. The Pd(0) complex is regenerated by reductive elimination of the palladium(II) compound by potassium carbonate in the final step, D. In the course of the reaction the carbonate is stoichiometrically consumed and palladium is truly a catalyst and used in catalytic amounts. A similar palladium cycle but with different scenes and actors is observed in the Wacker process.

This cycle is not limited to vinyl compounds, in the Sonogashira coupling one of the reactants is an alkyne and in the Suzuki coupling the alkene is replaced by an aryl boronic acid and in the Stille reaction by an aryl stannane. The cycle also extends to the other group 10 element nickel for example in the Negishi coupling between aryl halides and organozinc compounds. Platinum forms strong bonds with carbon and does not have a catalytic activity in this type of reaction.

==Stereoselectivity==
This coupling reaction is stereoselective with a propensity for trans coupling as the palladium halide group and the bulky organic residue move away from each other in the reaction sequence in a rotation step. The Heck reaction is applied industrially in the production of naproxen and the sunscreen component octyl methoxycinnamate. The naproxen synthesis includes a coupling between a brominated naphthalene compound with ethylene:

== Variations ==

===Ionic liquid Heck reaction===
In the presence of an ionic liquid a Heck reaction proceeds in absence of a phosphorus ligand. In one modification palladium acetate and the ionic liquid (bmim)PF6 are immobilized inside the cavities of reversed-phase silica gel. In this way the reaction proceeds in water and the catalyst is re-usable.
=== Heck oxyarylation ===
In the Heck oxyarylation modification the palladium substituent in the syn-addition intermediate is displaced by a hydroxyl group and the reaction product contains a dihydrofuran ring.
=== Amino-Heck reaction ===
In the amino-Heck reaction a nitrogen to carbon bond is formed. In one example, an oxime with a strongly electron withdrawing group reacts intramolecularly with the end of a diene to form a pyridine compound. The catalyst is tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and the base is triethylamine.

<text>Clann Zú were an Australian-Irish band that formed in late 1999 in Melbourne. By early 2002 they had relocated to Dublin. The group issued two albums, &quot;Rua&quot; (2002) and &quot;Black Coats &amp; Bandages&quot; (June 2004), before disbanding in May 2005.

==Biography==

Clann Zú were formed in Melbourne in late 1999 by Benjamin Andrews on electric guitar, Declan de Barra on vocals and bodhrán, and Nathan Greaves on bass guitar – all from Non-Intentional Lifeform. They were soon joined by Russell Fawcus on electric violin and keyboards, and Pip Reid on drums and percussion. Clann Zú played &quot;dramatic soundtrack quality&quot; music with &quot;a lush blend of dark and moving contemporary western sounds tinged with Middle Eastern and Irish melodies.&quot;

The forming members drew inspiration from an eclectic mix of musical styles, such as punk, rock, folk, electronic, and classical. Their fusion of Celtic folk, electronic music, and rock has created a unique epic soundscape full of powerful atmospheric sounds and off-beat instrumentation. Their songs are bilingual, utilising both Irish and English lyrics. In February 2000, they recorded a six-track extended play, &quot;Clann Zú&quot;, which was issued independently. Mediasearch&#x27;s Carmine Pascuzzi felt that &quot;Various styles epitomise their sound, from hip-hop to hard rock&quot; and that they provided &quot;a well-compiled collection that indicates potential for better things&quot; with &quot;de Barra, a charismatic frontman who sets a high standard for himself. He is intense and the vocals soar to good heights in the effort to impose himself on the audience.&quot;

In 2002 they released their first LP, &quot;Rua&quot;, on Zahrada Records. Jasper Lee of Oz Music Project described its &quot;style ranges from hard edged post rock riffs into languished instrumental and folk/celtic interludes, no one could ever blame the band for every being boring... Whilst room for improvement is in order, it is unlikely that [they] have peaked yet, so anticipate to hear even bigger and better things from them soon.&quot; In July, they toured New South Wales to promote their single, &quot;Choking on the Prize&quot;, which Christie Eliezer of Music &amp; Media previewed: the group &quot;plays a blend of alterno, folk and electronica.&quot;

During December 2001, Clann Zú relocated to Europe and early in the next year they moved to Dublin. The band signed to Winnipeg-based G7 Welcoming Committee Records, an independent record label, which re-issued, &quot;Rua&quot;, in September 2003. 
&quot;Five Thousand More&quot; was promoted via an animated music video created by de Barra, which was used for various festivals and online film and animation sites, including the 47th Cork International Film Festival. They subsequently released an animated video to accompany an Irish version of &quot;Crashing to the Floor&quot; in mid-2003. During 2003, My Disco was formed, initially as a side-project, in Melbourne by Benjamin Andrews on guitar; Liam Andrews on bass guitar and vocals; and Rohan Rebeiro on drums.

Clann Zú&#x27;s second album, &quot;Black Coats &amp; Bandages&quot;, was released in June 2004. The line-up for the album was Benjamin Andrews on guitar; Liam Andrews on bass guitar; de Barra on lead vocals; Fawcus on electric violin, piano and keyboard; Rebeiro on drums and percussion; and Lach Wooden on live sound manipulation and audio engineer. This saw a move away from the traditional Irish and folk influences which had characterised their first LP, &quot;Rua&quot;. Despite this stylistic departure they retained and indeed increased their use of the Irish language, with two songs (&quot;T-éan Bán&quot; and &quot;An Deireadh Scéal&quot;) sung entirely in Irish.

Clann Zú released the following statement, announcing their break-up, on their website in May 2005: &quot;Clann Zú regret to announce that it is no longer continuing to tour or record. Such is the life of a band. Benjamin and Liam will continue to tour and record with My Disco on the Crashing Jets label and Declan de Barra will continue with his own solo project.&quot; Russell Fawcus later joined The Black Hundred, with former members of Oneironaut, Season, and the Grand Silent System. In July 2010, the Black Hundred released their self-titled first album.

<text>Charles Anderson Wickliffe (June 8, 1788 – October 31, 1869) was a U.S. Representative from Kentucky. He also served as Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, the 14th Governor of Kentucky, and was appointed Postmaster General by President John Tyler. Though he consistently identified with the Whig Party, he was politically independent, and often had differences of opinion with Whig founder and fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay.

Wickliffe received a strong education in public school and through private tutors. He studied law and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1812. A vigorous supporter of the War of 1812, he served for a brief time as aide-de-camp to two American generals in the war. In 1823, he was elected to the first of five consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. He returned to the state House in 1833, and was elected the tenth Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1836. Governor James Clark died in office on October 5, 1839, and Wickliffe served as governor for the remaining nine months of Clark&#x27;s term.

President Tyler appointed Wickliffe as Postmaster General following Wickliffe&#x27;s term as governor. In 1844, he was stabbed by a man who was later found to be insane. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe on a secret mission to report on British and French intents with regard to annexing Texas and to assess the feasibility of the United States undertaking such an action. Wickliffe&#x27;s participation in this endeavor further distanced him from the Whigs.

In 1861, Wickliffe was again elected to the U.S. House, serving a single term. He tried to avert the Civil War by serving as a delegate to both the 1861 Peace Conference and the Border States Convention. After war was declared, he sided with the Union cause. In 1863, he again sought the office of governor, but federal military forces interfered with the election, resulting in a landslide victory for Thomas E. Bramlette. Later in life, Wickliffe was crippled in a carriage accident and also went completely blind. He died on October 31, 1869, while visiting his daughter in Maryland.

==Early life==
Charles Anderson Wickliffe was born June 8, 1788, in a log cabin near Springfield, Kentucky. He was the youngest of the nine children born to Charles and Lydia (Hardin) Wickliffe. His family emigrated to Kentucky from Virginia in 1784.

Wickliffe attained his early education at the local schools of Springfield, then attended Wilson&#x27;s Academy in Bardstown. For a year, he received private instruction from James Blythe, acting president of Transylvania University, then read law with Martin D. Hardin, a cousin on his mother&#x27;s side. In 1809, he was admitted to the bar and began practice in Bardstown. He owned slaves. He and five other prominent lawyers of Bardstown formed a debate club called The Pleiades Club. The club included six members: Wickliffe, John Hays, Ben Chapeze, Benjamin Hardin (another of Wickliffe&#x27;s cousins), Felix Grundy, and William Pope Duval. John Rowan and John Pope also participated in the debates, but were not members of the club.

In his early life, Wickliffe was known to gamble at cards. His friends considered his gambling excessive, and two of them – Duval and Judge John Pope Oldham – devised a scheme to break Wickliffe of his habit. The two knew that Wickliffe would be collecting several thousand dollars at the upcoming session of the Bullitt County court. They plotted to invite Wickliffe to play cards with them and agreed upon a secret system of signals to communicate about the strengths and weaknesses of the cards in their hands. In this way, they hoped to win all of Wickliffe&#x27;s money, then return it to him in exchange for his promise to forsake the vice. On the night appointed, however, it was Wickliffe who won all the money wagered by Duval and Oldham, despite their schemes. When Wickliffe later learned of the designs of his friends, he agreed to give up gambling.
In 1813, Wickliffe married Margaret Cripps, and the couple had three sons and five daughters. Most notable among the children was Robert, who became Governor of Louisiana. His daughter Nancy married David Levy Yulee.

The Wickliffes contracted with John Rogers, architect of St. Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral in Bardstown, to construct their residence, which they dubbed &quot;Wickland&quot;. Later, Wickland was called &quot;the home of three governors&quot;. Besides Wickliffe and his son, J. C. W. Beckham, Wickliffe&#x27;s grandson and future governor of Kentucky, occupied the residence.

==Political career==
Wickliffe&#x27;s political career began when he was elected to represent Nelson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1812 and 1813. During his tenure, he enthusiastically supported the War of 1812. He first served as an aide-de-camp to General Joseph Winlock, and on August 24, 1813, he enlisted as a private in Martin H. Wickliffe&#x27;s company. On September 2, 1813, he was chosen as aide-de-camp to General Samuel Caldwell and served in this capacity at the October 5, 1813, Battle of the Thames. In 1816, he succeeded Ben Hardin as Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney for Nelson County.

Wickliffe was returned to the Kentucky House in 1822 and 1823. During this period, a controversy known as the Old Court-New Court controversy was raging in Kentucky. Reeling from the financial Panic of 1819, many of the state&#x27;s citizens demanded debt relief. When some debt relief measures passed by the legislature were declared unconstitutional by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the legislature attempted to dissolve the court and replace it with a more sympathetic one. For a time, two courts claimed to be the court of last resort in Kentucky. Wickliffe supported the &quot;Old Court&quot;, which was the court that eventually prevailed.

===First service in the House of Representatives===
In 1823, Wickliffe was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and served five consecutive terms. Again he succeeded his cousin and friend, Ben Hardin. Though a Whig, he disagreed with many of the positions of the party&#x27;s founder, Henry Clay. When no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes in the 1824 presidential election, the constitution mandated that the election be decided in the House. Wickliffe bucked Clay&#x27;s advice to vote for him and instead voted for Andrew Jackson, who was the choice of the Kentucky legislature.

Historian Robert Powell opined that Wickliffe&#x27;s break from party loyalty may explain his lack of committee appointments in his early years in the House. Beginning in 1829, however, he chaired the Committee on Public Lands. In this capacity, he attacked Clay&#x27;s plan to distribute surplus revenue among the states as being unfair to younger states. He also differed with Clay over Clay&#x27;s willingness to limit slavery. He wrote Clay concerning his slowness to respond to the problem of fugitive slaves; Clay never responded. Neither was Wickliffe loyal to the Jacksonian platform, however. In a letter to his brother, he lamented Jackson&#x27;s attacks on the Second Bank of the United States. He publicly encouraged Kentuckians to strengthen the Whigs, despite his disagreements with Clay.

In 1830, Wickliffe was chosen by his colleagues as one of the managers of the impeachment trial proceedings against Missouri District Court judge James H. Peck. In 1831, he was one of several candidates proposed by the Kentucky General Assembly to succeed John Rowan in the U.S. Senate. Of the sixty-nine votes needed to be elected to the seat, Wickliffe received forty-nine. Other candidates included John J. Crittenden (sixty-eight votes), John Breathitt (sixty-six votes), and Richard Mentor Johnson (sixty-four votes). After three days of balloting, the Assembly was still unable to fill the seat, and it was allowed to remain vacant until the next session. Wickliffe did not seek re-election to his seat in the House in 1833.

===Governor of Kentucky===
Wickliffe returned to the state legislature from 1833 to 1835. In 1834, he defeated Daniel Breck and John L. Helm to become Speaker of the House. He was elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky in 1836, defeating Democrat Elijah Hise by a margin of just over 1,300 votes. Upon the death of Governor James Clark on October 5, 1839, he became acting governor and served the remaining nine months of Clark&#x27;s term.

As governor, Wickliffe&#x27;s primary concern was the Panic of 1837. He advocated raising property taxes to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state&#x27;s credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.

===Service to Presidents Tyler and Polk===
Wickliffe campaigned on behalf of the Whig ticket of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler in the presidential election of 1840. Wickliffe and Tyler were friends, having shared a room when they were both in Congress. When Harrison&#x27;s death elevated Tyler to the office of president, Tyler appointed Wicklilffe as Postmaster General, a choice that angered Clay supporters in the party. Wickliffe served in Tyler&#x27;s administration until March 1845.

On August 1, 1844, Wickliffe and two of his daughters boarded the steamship &quot;Georgia&quot; traveling from Old Point Comfort in Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. While en route, he was stabbed in the chest by a man wielding a claspknife. The knife bounced off Wickliffe&#x27;s breastbone without damaging any major internal organs, and a U.S. Navy officer prevented a second blow from hitting Wickliffe. Wickliffe&#x27;s attacker, J. McLean Gardner, was disarmed and arrested. Later that night, he wrote Wickliffe a letter of apology. Wickliffe was not seriously injured, and returned home three days after the attack. Gardner was tried and found to be insane; he was later sent to an asylum.

Wickliffe supported the annexation of Texas, an issue that helped seal Clay&#x27;s defeat in the 1844 presidential canvass. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe as an envoy on a secret mission to the Republic of Texas. Originally, his purpose was to quash British and French attempts to forestall the U.S. annexation of Texas, but he later joined Commodore Robert F. Stockton in lobbying leaders of the Republic of Texas to order their military forces across the Rio Grande into Mexico. Stockton and Wickliffe believed that if they could provoke a Texan invasion of Mexico, the United States would have a stronger case for annexing Texas. Ultimately, they failed in convincing the Texans to invade, but succeeded in drumming up support for annexation. Both Wickliffe&#x27;s position on annexation and his willingness to carry out Polk&#x27;s assignment further distanced him from the Whigs.

===Later political career===

On February 18, 1841, the Kentucky General Assembly elected James Turner Morehead to the U.S. Senate; Wickliffe received twenty votes in this contest. In 1849, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention, despite having opposed the calling of such a convention a decade earlier. Wickliffe&#x27;s political opponents, including Thomas F. Marshall, claimed this showed Wickliffe&#x27;s political inconsistency, a charge that Wickliffe denied. The following year, Wickliffe was appointed to a committee charged with revising the state&#x27;s code of laws. On January 8, 1861, he chaired the state Democratic convention in Louisville.

Wickliffe was elected to another term in Congress, serving from 1861 to 1863 as a Union Whig. He opposed the idea of secession, and was a member of both the 1861 Peace Conference and the Border States Convention that attempted to stave off the Civil War. In April 1861, he attended a secret meeting at the Capitol Hotel in Frankfort where participants planned to arm Union supporters in key areas of the state. On May 18, President Lincoln supplied rifles – nicknamed &quot;Lincoln guns&quot; – for the venture. After Braxton Bragg&#x27;s forces destroyed the railroad trestles near Bardstown, Wickliffe personally hired Joseph Z. Aud to carry the area&#x27;s mail by private carriage. The trestles were rebuilt in February 1863, precluding the need for Aud&#x27;s service.

Near the end of his term in Congress, Wickliffe was thrown from a carriage and permanently crippled. Despite his injury, he remained politically active. In 1863, he ran for governor as a Peace Democrat on an anti-Lincoln platform. Military authorities considered him subversive, however, and interfered with the election; Wickliffe lost to Thomas E. Bramlette in a landslide.

Wickliffe served as a delegate to the 1864 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, casting his vote for George B. McClellan. In the final years of his life, he became totally blind. While visiting his daughter near Ilchester, Maryland, he fell gravely ill and died on October 31, 1869. He was buried in Bardstown Cemetery in Bardstown. During World War I, a U.S. naval ship was named in Wickliffe&#x27;s honor.

<text>Amanda Byram (born 16 June 1973) is an Irish television presenter and former model, best known for co-presenting BBC One game show &quot;Total Wipeout&quot; with Richard Hammond, the Irish version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; on RTÉ1 and for hosting American television shows, &quot;The Swan&quot; and &quot;Paradise Hotel&quot;.

==Early life==
Formerly a model, Byram started her career on television in 1999 presenting the TV3 morning show &quot;Ireland AM&quot; with Mark Cagney, during which time she met her then-boyfriend, comedian Patrick Kielty.

==Television career==
Soon afterwards she began appearing on British television, initially as a host on &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; on Channel 4 in 2001 and subsequently appeared as a guest host on &quot;Liquid News&quot; on BBC Three in 2002. She also presented the UK edition of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, which aired on Sky One.

Having broken up with Kielty, she relocated to the United States, choosing to base herself in Los Angeles. Numerous TV presenting roles followed including the reality television series &quot;Paradise Hotel&quot;, in 2003 and 2008.

Byram hosted the &quot;Miss World&quot; pageant in 2003 and briefly appeared in David Hewlett&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Breakfast&quot;.

Byram served as the host for the Fox reality television special &quot;Seriously, Dude, I&#x27;m Gay&quot;, which was set to air on June 7, 2004. However, the special was abruptly shelved eleven days before its premiere following backlash from the media monitoring organization GLAAD. Speaking on the special&#x27;s cancellation, Byram commented: &quot;Of course it is always disappointing when things don’t air, but TV and the FCC is very sensitive right now, and I roll with the decisions made by the Fox network, as they have been and continue to be very supportive to me.&quot;

In 2007 she co-hosted, along with Dennis Miller, the Game Show Network programme &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, a US version of the British quiz format. She has also worked on &quot;The Swan&quot;, a controversial beauty show following 16 unattractive women who turn their life around by having an extreme makeover. She also appeared as a special guest on &quot;Anonymous&quot; in 2009.

She hosted the Meteor Music Awards at the RDS, Dublin on 17 March 2009 and appeared on &quot;The Cafe&quot; on 30 January to publicise her selection.

She has co-hosted the British gameshow &quot;Total Wipeout&quot; alongside Richard Hammond, from 3 January 2009. After 5 series and 1 Winter series, the final episode was aired on 31 December 2012.

She also regularly co-hosted &quot;Something for the Weekend&quot; with Tim Lovejoy, standing in for Louise Redknapp, as well as standing in for Lovejoy on its replacement series, &quot;Sunday Brunch&quot;.

In 2010, she appeared in one episode of &quot;Supersize vs Superskinny&quot;, helping Anna Richardson get the perfect body. On 6 August 2010, Byram presented &quot;This Morning&quot; with Paddy McGuinness.

Byram was a guest on the first episode of the BBC One panel game &quot;Ask Rhod Gilbert&quot;.

In January and February 2011 she presented selected &quot;Strictly Come Dancing Live!&quot; shows across different locations. Kate Thornton presented the shows that Byram missed.
On 8 January 2011, Byram appeared in an episode of BBC One show &quot;The Magicians&quot;. As the celebrity on the losing team, she had to endure the forfeit trick at the end of the episode, laying on a bed of nails while a motorcycle drove over her and Chris Korn.

Byram hosted a new TV show for Sky 1 HD, called &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;, in 2012. The first episode aired on 18 March 2012.

On 31 May 2013, Byram presented &quot;This Morning&quot; with Jake Humphrey.

In November 2016, it was reported and later confirmed that Byram would host the Irish version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; alongside Nicky Byrne. The series started in January 2017 on RTÉ One and is based on the format of the original British TV series &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. On 28 August 2018, after two series, Byram confirmed that she would not be returning as a presenter in 2019.

From 2019 to 2022, Byram served as a host on &quot;Food Unwrapped&quot;.

==Personal life==
Before she moved to the United States, Byram was in a relationship with comedian Patrick Kielty. Currently living in Fulham, South-west London, she was engaged to former rugby union player Craig McMullen. However, she announced in January 2012 that she had split from him.

Since April 2014, she has been in a relationship with Julian Okines, a creative content producer. In December 2015, they announced their engagement, and they got married in April 2016. Byram gave birth to their son named Phoenix in November 2021.

She adheres to a vigorous fitness routine and is known for being proud of her physique.

<text>Trench Town (also Trenchtown) is a neighbourhood located in the parish of St. Andrew, part of which is in Kingston, the capital and largest city of Jamaica. Today Trench Town is the location of the Trench Town Culture Yard Museum, a National Heritage Site presenting the unique history and contribution of Trench Town to Jamaica.

Trench Town is the birthplace of rocksteady and reggae music, as well as the home of reggae and Rastafari ambassador Bob Marley. The neighborhood gets its name from its previous designation as Trench Pen, of land once used for livestock by Daniel Power Trench, an Irish immigrant of the 18th century (descendants of the Earls of Clancarty). The Trench family abandoned the land in the late 19th century. Trench Town is home to the communities of Wilton Gardens [Rema], Federal Gardens, Arnett Gardens [Jungle], Havana, Buckers and others. Trench Town today is also the home of two of Jamaica&#x27;s top Premier League football club teams, Arnett Gardens and Boys&#x27; Town.

== History ==
During the colonial period, Trenchtown was part of the Greenwich Park estate of Daniel Power Trench (1813-1884), son of a wealthy plantation owner and slave-holder. Christopher Whyms-Stone asserts the settlement&#x27;s name derives from Daniel Trench (rather than, for instance, taking its name from gulleys and trenches observable in its landscape).

During the 1930s, Trench Pen, in southern St. Andrew (neighboring western Kingston), was a growing squatter settlement for the rural to urban migrants. Trench Pen was developed into Trench Town when the colonial government&#x27;s Central Housing Authority (CHA) initiated a model township project, which included owner-occupied housing, rental social housing, schools, a theatre (The Ambassador), a park (Vin Lawrence Park), YMCA and YWCA, health clinic and fire station. Approximately of Trench Pen was used to create Trench Town, and the remaining land became known as Rose Town, a residential community. Many who came from rural Jamaica to find work settled in the western side of Kingston, as there were available &quot;idle&quot; lands, and the area was also a desirable location since it close to downtown and the market district.

The new residences consisted of one- and two-storey &#x27;knog&#x27; buildings, built in clusters or around a central courtyard with communal cooking and bathroom facilities. The residences became the famous Government Yards of Trench Town. Knog construction refers to a labor-intensive traditional method of construction where a timber-frame structure is in-filled with brick or rubble then covered with a wire mesh and plastered. The architecture used was that of a rural Caribbean vernacular with hip roofs and wide verandas. Trench Town was a planned community with a hierarchical grid of streets and central sewage and garbage disposal systems. In the 1950s and 1960s, bread and milk were delivered door to door. Each month the CHA would inspect the residences to ensure compliance and that tenants paid their twelve shillings per month on time.

Trench then became famous for the talent which emerged from the project. Trench Town is mainly known for the vast number of musicians it produced, the community has also produced some of Jamaica&#x27;s top professional, business and political leaders as well as famous sports and religious personalities. This small area contributed widely to global awareness of the impoverished and politically-corrupt conditions in Jamaica.

Like the rest of Jamaica, Trench Town became unstable and dangerous in the early 1970s when politics became violent. The two major Jamaican political parties (the People&#x27;s National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party) had emerged in Kingston and violently enforced codes that ensured only their party&#x27;s supporters had access to jobs and services. The lower part of Trench Town below Seventh Street was sympathetic to the JLP, which in the 1970s put it at war with its northern neighbor Arnette Gardens, a PNP stronghold. The road connecting the two, Seventh Street, became the frontline in an all-out war, which saw the entire two blocks of Government Yards between Fifth Street and Seventh Streets being destroyed. The greatest challenge of the community and Jamaica today is poverty.

Traditional community organizations such as Boys Town [YMCA] and Joy Town [YWCA] continue to contribute to the welfare of the residents. New organizations such as AIR (Agency for Inner-city Renewal), the Trenchtown Reading Centre [FACE Jamaica], and the Trench Town Development Association, were formed to increase positive social attitudes, increase literacy and encourage government spending and development in the area. Crime in the neighbourhood has declined; the murder rate in western Kingston has dropped since the mid-1990s. King Charles III has funded a regeneration project in Rose Town through his Foundation for Building Community.

=== Birthplace of reggae ===
Trench Town is known in popular culture due to numerous ska, rocksteady, and reggae musicians who grew up there, most notably Bob Marley, who spent much of his youth in the Government Yard on First Street. His songs &quot;Trenchtown&quot;, &quot;Natty Dread&quot;, &quot;Trenchtown Rock&quot; and &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; make reference to it. It was also home to Rastafari elder Mortimo &quot;Kumi&quot; Planno, and the following artists and groups:

<text>BlackGirl is an American pop/dance vocal trio consisting of Pam Copeland, Nycolia &quot;Tye-V&quot; Turman, and Rochelle Stuart from Atlanta, that formed in 1992 on the Kaper/RCA/BMG label.

==Biography==
BlackGirl released their debut album &quot;Treat U Right&quot; in 1994. Warren Marshall of the &quot;Columbus Times&quot; remarked: &quot;Blackgirl -- the ultimate definition of today&#x27;s `90&#x27;s girls.&quot; They released their debut single &quot;Krazy&quot; in 1993, which was one of four consecutive top forty singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, &quot;Krazy&quot; (No. 37), &quot;90&#x27;s Girl&quot; (No. 13), &quot;Where Did We Go Wrong&quot; (No. 39) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; (No. 25). By the time &quot;90&#x27;s Girl&quot; was released the album has US sales of over 500,000 units.

By the end of 1994, BlackGirl toured the United States with R. Kelly for a six-week tour, appeared on Soul Train, and in a Chrysler commercial, and released the holiday single &quot;Give Love On Christmas Day&quot;/&quot;Christmas Time&quot;. The group then teamed up with Aaliyah, En Vogue, Mary J. Blige, Vanessa Williams, For Real, and SWV for the single &quot;Freedom&quot; from the film, &quot;Panther&quot;. The single became BlackGirl&#x27;s fifth Top forty single, when peaked at number eighteen.

On September 24, the band performed at the 1994 Georgia Hall of Fame gala honoring Isaac Hayes.

In 1995, the band earned two Soul Train Award nominations, Single of the Year (By A Group, Band or Duo) for &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; and Album of the Year (By A Group, Band or Duo) for &quot;Treat U Right&quot;. They then released &quot;90&#x27;s Girl&quot; in the UK, the song was a Top five success on the R&amp;B chart, and reached #23 on the UK Singles Chart. The group appeared on the single &quot;Hey, Look Away&quot; by Questionmark Asylum in late 1995, and at the end of the year the group performed with Chuck Berry at Apollo Theater Hall of Fame ceremony.

In 1996 the group disbanded. In 2010, Stuart released a gospel album titled &quot;I Choose Jesus&quot;, billed as Rochelle Morgan.

In 2013 AllMusic.com named &quot;Krazy&quot; the #35 Best R&amp;B Song of 1994. 
The original lineup of Blackgirl reunited in late 2016 with an updated version their hit, &quot;Where Did We Go Wrong.&quot; 2017 finds Blackgirl with new tour dates listed on their official website http://www.theofficialblackgirl.com

==Humanitarian work==
On January 7, 1995 BlackGirl took part in &#x27;The Lou Rawls Parade of Stars&#x27; to benefit the United Negro College Fund. In March 1995 BlackGirl joined Naomi Campbell, Coolio, Aaliyah and Naughty by Nature as part of CounterAID, a benefit for AIDS. The program raised over $200,000.

<text>From Chaos is the sixth studio album by 311, released on June 19, 2001.

In 2000, before this album was recorded and released they left Capricorn Records and switched to Volcano Entertainment as their permanent label.

Singles from this album include &quot;You Wouldn&#x27;t Believe&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Here Awhile&quot;, and &quot;Amber&quot;. The latter was the most popular single from the album, and it still remains 311&#x27;s most popular single to date.

&quot;From Chaos&quot; is the first album to ever be recorded in 311&#x27;s current recording studio The Hive in North Hollywood, California.

&quot;From Chaos&quot; is an enhanced CD, featuring interviews with the band.

Shortly after the album was mixed, lead singer Nick Hexum had his tonsils removed.

&quot;Bomb the Town,&quot; &quot;Will the World,&quot; &quot;We Do It Like This,&quot; and &quot;Dreamland&quot; are b-sides from this CD. They can be heard on the bonus disc included with Enlarged to Show Detail 2.

This is the last 311 studio album to receive a RIAA certification.

==Background==
Much of the album &quot;From Chaos&quot; was written by the band while on tour in 2000 promoting their fifth studio album &#x27;Soundsystem.&#x27; The album name &#x27;From Chaos&#x27; was inspired by the band’s situation with their previous record label of seven years, Capricorn Records. According to singer Nick Hexum, they &quot;had a lot of disagreements with Capricorn over the years and it was just time to end our relationship.&quot; The band sued Capricorn, voided their contract and signed with Volcano records. The band was going through stress of legal trouble, which brought a negativity environment where albums do not get made; they did not want to make an album surrounding that subject, so most of the album is born out of &quot;relationships and appreciating life&quot; according to Hexum, who takes pride in being up-beat and positive.

==Critical reception==

The album received positive reviews from various music critics. Steve Appleford of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writes &quot;[the album] &quot;From Chaos&quot; is mostly a repeat of proven 311 formulas (even with strange new flashes of prog-rock flavor), but singers &quot;Nicholas Hexum&quot; and S.A. Martinez are earnest, energetic MC&#x27;s, crooning, rapping, shouting across a thundering blend of rock, reggae, hip-hop and psychedelia. Still fresh and funky.&quot; Angelique Campbell from &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; in Ohio writes, &quot;311 stays with its formula of combining funk, rock and reggae with a dash of catchy pop sensibility on From Chaos.&quot; Jacob Lunders, a contributor for &quot;Allmusic&quot; writes, &quot;From Chaos astonishes and impresses with considerable energy and focus, proving itself as the album 311 has always been capable of making.&quot;

However, Paul Massari of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; criticized the album, writing &quot;311 tries to demonstrate that it is still relevant in the era of the loud, angry rap-metal band. The death-rock power chords on tracks like &quot;Full Ride&quot; are plodding, and the tone of the gangsta raps is absurdly inflated.&quot; Kathryn McGuire of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; adds, &quot;311 slings melodramatic metal riffs and whiny verses every which way, and their once-novel fusion seems unfocused and flat.&quot; Kristen Koba, founder of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote, &quot;The whiny white boy rap, almost funky bass lines, and grinding guitar riffs just couldn’t hold up in a city that offers so much innovative hip-hop and truly vital rock.&quot;

<text>Illinois Route 117 is a rural north–south state route in north central Illinois. It travels from Interstate 74 in the small community of Goodfield to Illinois Route 17 in Toluca. Illinois 117 covers a distance of about .

== Route description ==
Illinois 117 is a rural, two lane surface road for its entire length. The main cities of service on Illinois 117 are Eureka and Roanoke. In Eureka, Illinois 117 is known as Main Street, and intersects with U.S. Route 24 (Center Street).

Illinois 117 then overlaps Illinois Route 116 from west of Roanoke to Benson, a distance of about . Through Roanoke, Illinois 117 is called Front Street. Northeast of Roanoke, Illinois 116/117 runs on top of an abandoned rail line until it turns north towards Toluca.
== History ==

Though Illinois 117 now connects to Illinois 17, they were originally unconnected, and each were separately planned in State Bond Issue sequence. SBI Route 117 originally ran from U.S. Route 150 (just north of current I-74) in Goodfield to Illinois 116 north of Eureka. On January 8, 1993, it was extended north through Roanoke and north to Toluca to renumber IL 116A, the last surviving letter route in Illinois.

<text>Frederick Daniel Parslow VC (14 January 1856 – 4 July 1915) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross. He was a Master in the UK Merchant Navy.

Parslow was the first member of the Merchant Navy to receive a VC, and one of only two Merchant Navy members to receive a VC for his First World War service. At 59 years old he was also the oldest person to receive the VC for his action in World War I.

==Details==
At 0900 hrs 4 July 1915 in the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Queenstown, Ireland, the U-boat attacked HM Horse Transport &quot;Anglo-Californian&quot;, a cargo steamship that the UK Government had requisitioned from the Nitrate Producers&#x27; Steam Ship Company. Parslow was &quot;Anglo-Californian&quot;″s Master, and kept ordering changes of course to evade the enemy fire. At 1030 hrs &quot;U-39&quot; raised the flag signal &quot;abandon the vessel as fast as possible&quot;.

Parslow was about to obey the order when his wireless operator received a signal from a Royal Navy destroyer to hold on as long as possible. &quot;Anglo-Californian&quot; got under way again, so &quot;U-39&quot; opened a heavy fire, concentrated on the transport ship&#x27;s bridge, and doing great damage. Captain Parslow remained on the bridge throughout the attack, entirely without protection and was killed when the bridge was wrecked.

Parslow&#x27;s son, also Frederick Parslow, was the Chief Officer and took command on the death of his father. He held out until two destroyers arrived to drive the submarine away. &quot;Anglo-Californian&quot; suffered 20 casualties, but most of the cargo of nearly a thousand military horses was saved. The younger Parslow was commissioned as a Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

As a merchant officer, Parslow was not eligible for the VC in 1915. However, later the Royal Navy posthumously commissioned Parslow as a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, and in May 1919 he was posthumously awarded the VC.

Parslow lived in Balls Pond Road, Islington. On 4 July 2015 the London Borough of Islington commemorated the centenary of Parslow&#x27;s action and death by installing an inscribed memorial paving stone next to Islington Green War Memorial.

<text>Walter Richard Parker, VC (20 September 1881 – 28 November 1936) was a British ironworker, Royal Marine, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==First World War==
Parker was 33 years old, and a lance corporal in the Royal Marine Light Infantry, Royal Marines, Royal Naval Division during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On the night of 30 April/1 May 1915 at Gaba Tepe, Gallipoli, Lance Corporal Parker, a volunteer stretcher-bearer, went out with a party of NCOs and men to take ammunition, water and medical stores to an isolated trench containing about 40 men and several wounded. There were no communication trenches leading to the trench, and several men had already been killed in an attempt to reach it.

After crossing an area of about 400 yards swept by machine-gun and rifle fire, Lance Corporal Parker was alone, the rest of the party having been killed or wounded. On his arrival he gave assistance to the wounded and when the trench was finally evacuated early the next morning, he helped to remove and attend the casualties, although he himself was seriously wounded.

Parker never fully recovered from his wounds, and was invalided out of the service in June 1916. The award appeared in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 22 June 1917; the lengthy delay before the award being explained by the commanding officer, adjutant, sergeant major and the company commander all being wounded at the time of the action for which Parker was awarded the medal. The account of the award also noted that Parker had consistently displayed bravery and energy in the three previous days during a particularly difficult time as commander the battalion&#x27;s stretcher bearers, when almost every wounded man had to be evacuated over open ground and under fire.

==Death and legacy==
Parker died, aged 55, at Stapleford near Nottingham and is buried in the local cemetery. A memorial service to him is held annually at Stapleford by the local Royal Marines Association on the Sunday nearest 30 April. There is a paved area in Stapleford town centre named in his honour.

Parker&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Marines Museum, in Southsea, England.

<text>The Stille reaction is a chemical reaction widely used in organic synthesis. The reaction involves the coupling of two organic groups, one of which is carried as an organotin compound (also known as organostannanes). A variety of organic electrophiles provide the other coupling partner. The Stille reaction is one of many palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions.
:formula_1 
:*formula_2: Allyl, alkenyl, aryl, benzyl, acyl
:*formula_3: halides (Cl, Br, I), pseudohalides (OTf, OPO(OR)2), OAc
The R1 group attached to the trialkyltin is normally sp2-hybridized, including vinyl, and aryl groups.

These organostannanes are also stable to both air and moisture, and many of these reagents either are commercially available or can be synthesized from literature precedent. However, these tin reagents tend to be highly toxic. X is typically a halide, such as Cl, Br, or I, yet pseudohalides such as triflates and sulfonates and phosphates can also be used. Several reviews have been published.

==History==
The first example of a palladium catalyzed coupling of aryl halides with organotin reagents was reported by Colin Eaborn in 1976. This reaction yielded from 7% to 53% of diaryl product. This process was expanded to the coupling of acyl chlorides with alkyl-tin reagents in 1977 by Toshihiko Migita, yielding 53% to 87% ketone product.

In 1977, Migita published further work on the coupling of allyl-tin reagents with both aryl (C) and acyl (D) halides. The greater ability of allyl groups to migrate to the palladium catalyst allowed the reactions to be performed at lower temperatures. Yields for aryl halides ranged from 4% to 100%, and for acyl halides from 27% to 86%. Reflecting the early contributions of Migita and Kosugi, the Stille reaction is sometimes called the Migita–Kosugi–Stille coupling.

John Kenneth Stille subsequently reported the coupling of a variety of alkyl tin reagents in 1978 with numerous aryl and acyl halides under mild reaction conditions with much better yields (76%–99%). Stille continued his work in the 1980s on the synthesis of a multitude of ketones using this broad and mild process and elucidated a mechanism for this transformation.

By the mid-1980s, over 65 papers on the topic of coupling reactions involving tin had been published, continuing to explore the substrate scope of this reaction. While initial research in the field focused on the coupling of alkyl groups, most future work involved the much more synthetically useful coupling of vinyl, alkenyl, aryl, and allyl organostannanes to halides. Due to these organotin reagent&#x27;s stability to air and their ease of synthesis, the Stille reaction became common in organic synthesis.

==Mechanism==
The mechanism of the Stille reaction has been extensively studied. The catalytic cycle involves an oxidative addition of a halide or pseudohalide (2) to a palladium catalyst (1), transmetalation of 3 with an organotin reagent (4), and reductive elimination of 5 to yield the coupled product (7) and the regenerated palladium catalyst (1).

However, the detailed mechanism of the Stille coupling is extremely complex and can occur via numerous reaction pathways. Like other palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions, the active palladium catalyst is believed to be a 14-electron Pd(0) complex, which can be generated in a variety of ways. Use of an 18- or 16- electron Pd(0) source , can undergo ligand dissociation to form the active species. Second, phosphines can be added to ligandless palladium(0). Finally, as pictured, reduction of a Pd(II) source (8) , , , , etc.) by added phosphine ligands or organotin reagents is also common

===Oxidative addition===
Oxidative addition to the 14-electron Pd(0) complex is proposed. This process gives a 16-electron Pd(II) species. It has been suggested that anionic ligands, such as OAc, accelerate this step by the formation of [Pd(OAc)(PR3)n]−, making the palladium species more nucleophillic.
In some cases, especially when an sp3-hybridized organohalide is used, an SN2 type mechanism tends to prevail, yet this is not as commonly seen in the literature.
However, despite normally forming a &quot;cis&quot;-intermediate after a concerted oxidative addition, this product is in rapid equilibrium with its &quot;trans&quot;-isomer.

There are multiple reasons why isomerization is favored here. First, a bulky ligand set is usually used in these processes, such as phosphines, and it is highly unfavorable for them to adopt a &quot;cis&quot; orientation relative to each other, resulting in isomerization to the more favorable trans product. An alternative explanation for this phenomenon, dubbed antisymbiosis or transphobia, is by invocation of the sdn model. Under this theory, palladium is a hypervalent species. Hence R1 and the trans ligand, being trans to each other, will compete with one palladium orbital for bonding. This 4-electron 3-center bond is weakest when two strong donating groups are present, which heavily compete for the palladium orbital. Relative to any ligand normally used, the C-donor R1 ligand has a much higher trans effect. This trans influence is a measure of how competitive ligands trans to each other will compete for palladium&#x27;s orbital. The usual ligand set, phosphines, and C-donors (R1) are both soft ligands, meaning that they will form strong bonds to palladium, and heavily compete with each other for bonding. Since halides or pseudohalides are significantly more electronegative, their bonding with palladium will be highly polarized, with most of the electron density on the X group, making them low trans effect ligands. Hence, it will be highly favorable for R1 to be trans to X, since the R1 group will be able to form a stronger bond to the palladium.

===Transmetallation===
The transmetallation of the &quot;trans&quot; intermediate from the oxidative addition step is believed to proceed via a variety of mechanisms depending on the substrates and conditions. The most common type of transmetallation for the Stille coupling involves an associative mechanism. This pathway implies that the organostannane, normally a tin atom bonded to an allyl, alkenyl, or aryl group, can coordinate to the palladium via one of these double bonds. This produces a fleeting pentavalent, 18-electron species, which can then undergo ligand detachment to form a square planar complex again. Despite the organostannane being coordinated to the palladium through the R2 group, R2 must be formally transferred to the palladium (the R2-Sn bond must be broken), and the X group must leave with the tin, completing the transmetalation. This is believed to occur through two mechanisms.

First, when the organostannane initially adds to the trans metal complex, the X group can coordinate to the tin, in addition to the palladium, producing a cyclic transition state. Breakdown of this adduct results in the loss of R3Sn-X and a trivalent palladium complex with R1 and R2 present in a &quot;cis&quot; relationship. Another commonly seen mechanism involves the same initial addition of the organostannane to the &quot;trans&quot; palladium complex as seen above; however, in this case, the X group does not coordinate to the tin, producing an open transition state. After the α-carbon relative to tin attacks the palladium, the tin complex will leave with a net positive charge. In the scheme below, please note that the double bond coordinating to tin denotes R2, so any alkenyl, allyl, or aryl group. Furthermore, the X group can dissociate at any time during the mechanism and bind to the Sn+ complex at the end. Density functional theory calculations predict that an open mechanism will prevail if the 2 ligands remain attached to the palladium and the X group leaves, while the cyclic mechanism is more probable if a ligand dissociates prior to the transmetalation. Hence, good leaving groups such as triflates in polar solvents favor the cyclic transition state, while bulky phosphine ligands will favor the open transition state.

A less common pathway for transmetalation is through a dissociative or solvent assisted mechanism. Here, a ligand from the tetravalent palladium species dissociates, and a coordinating solvent can add onto the palladium. When the solvent detaches, to form a 14-electron trivalent intermediate, the organostannane can add to the palladium, undergoing an open or cyclic type process as above.

===Reductive elimination step===
In order for R1-R2 to reductively eliminate, these groups must occupy mutually &quot;cis&quot; coordination sites. Any &quot;trans&quot;-adducts must therefore isomerize to the &quot;cis&quot; intermediate or the coupling will be frustrated. A variety of mechanisms exist for reductive elimination and these are usually considered to be concerted.

First, the 16-electron tetravalent intermediate from the transmetalation step can undergo unassisted reductive elimination from a square planar complex. This reaction occurs in two steps: first, the reductive elimination is followed by coordination of the newly formed sigma bond between R1 and R2 to the metal, with ultimate dissociation yielding the coupled product.

The previous process, however, is sometimes slow and can be greatly accelerated by dissociation of a ligand to yield a 14-electron T shaped intermediate. This intermediate can then rearrange to form a Y-shaped adduct, which can undergo faster reductive elimination.

Finally, an extra ligand can associate to the palladium to form an 18-electron trigonal bipyramidal structure, with R1 and R2 cis to each other in equatorial positions. The geometry of this intermediate makes it similar to the Y-shaped above.

The presence of bulky ligands can also increase the rate of elimination. Ligands such as phosphines with large bite angles cause steric repulsion between L and R1 and R2, resulting in the angle between L and the R groups to increase and the angle between R1 and R2 to hence decrease, allowing for quicker reductive elimination.
==Kinetics==
The rate at which organostannanes transmetalate with palladium catalysts is shown below. Sp2-hybridized carbon groups attached to tin are the most commonly used coupling partners, and sp3-hybridized carbons require harsher conditions and terminal alkynes may be coupled via a C-H bond through the Sonogashira reaction.

As the organic tin compound, a trimethylstannyl or tributylstannyl compound is normally used. Although trimethylstannyl compounds show higher reactivity compared with tributylstannyl compounds and have much simpler 1H-NMR spectra, the toxicity of the former is much larger.

Optimizing which ligands are best at carrying out the reaction with high yield and turnover rate can be difficult. This is because the oxidative addition requires an electron rich metal, hence favoring electron donating ligands. However, an electron deficient metal is more favorable for the transmetalation and reductive elimination steps, making electron withdrawing ligands the best here. Therefore, the optimal ligand set heavily depends on the individual substrates and conditions used. These can change the rate determining step, as well as the mechanism for the transmetalation step.

Normally, ligands of intermediate donicity, such as phosphines, are utilized. Rate enhancements can be seen when moderately electron-poor ligands, such as tri-2-furylphosphine or triphenylarsenine are used. Likewise, ligands of high donor number can slow down or inhibit coupling reactions.

These observations imply that normally, the rate-determining step for the Stille reaction is transmetalation.

===Additives===
The most common additive to the Stille reaction is stoichiometric or co-catalytic copper(I), specifically copper iodide, which can enhance rates up by &gt;103 fold. It has been theorized that in polar solvents copper transmetalate with the organostannane. The resulting organocuprate reagent could then transmetalate with the palladium catalyst. Furthermore, in ethereal solvents, the copper could also facilitate the removal of a phosphine ligand, activating the Pd center.

Lithium chloride has been found to be a powerful rate accelerant in cases where the X group dissociates from palladium (i.e. the open mechanism). The chloride ion is believed to either displace the X group on the palladium making the catalyst more active for transmetalation or by coordination to the Pd(0) adduct to accelerate the oxidative addition. Also, LiCl salt enhances the polarity of the solvent, making it easier for this normally anionic ligand (–Cl, –Br, –OTf, etc.) to leave. This additive is necessary when a solvent like THF is used; however, utilization of a more polar solvent, such as NMP, can replace the need for this salt additive. However, when the coupling&#x27;s transmetalation step proceeds via the cyclic mechanism, addition of lithium chloride can actually decrease the rate. As in the cyclic mechanism, a neutral ligand, such as phosphine, must dissociate instead of the anionic X group.

Finally, sources of fluoride ions, such as cesium fluoride, also effect on the catalytic cycle. First, fluoride can increase the rates of reactions of organotriflates, possibly by the same effect as lithium chloride. Furthermore, fluoride ions can act as scavengers for tin byproducts, making them easier to remove via filtration.

===Competing side reactions===
The most common side reactivity associated with the Stille reaction is homocoupling of the stannane reagents to form an R2-R2 dimer. It is believed to proceed through two possible mechanisms. First, reaction of two equivalents of organostannane with the Pd(II) precatalyst will yield the homocoupled product after reductive elimination. Second, the Pd(0) catalyst can undergo a radical process to yield the dimer. The organostannane reagent used is traditionally tetravalent at tin, normally consisting of the sp2-hybridized group to be transferred and three &quot;non-transferable&quot; alkyl groups. As seen above, alkyl groups are normally the slowest at migrating onto the palladium catalyst.

It has also been found that at temperatures as low as 50 °C, aryl groups on both palladium and a coordinated phosphine can exchange. While normally not detected, they can be a potential minor product in many cases.

Finally, a rather rare and exotic side reaction is known as cine substitution. Here, after initial oxidative addition of an aryl halide, this Pd-Ar species can insert across a vinyl tin double bond. After β-hydride elimination, migratory insertion, and protodestannylation, a 1,2-disubstituted olefin can be synthesized.

Numerous other side reactions can occur, and these include E/Z isomerization, which can potentially be a problem when an alkenylstannane is utilized. The mechanism of this transformation is currently unknown. Normally, organostannanes are quite stable to hydrolysis, yet when very electron-rich aryl stannanes are used, this can become a significant side reaction.

==Scope==
===Electrophile===
Vinyl halides are common coupling partners in the Stille reaction, and reactions of this type are found in numerous natural product total syntheses. Normally, vinyl iodides and bromides are used. Vinyl chlorides are insufficiently reactive toward oxidative addition to Pd(0). Iodides are normally preferred: they will typically react faster and under milder conditions than will bromides. This difference is demonstrated below by the selective coupling of a vinyl iodide in the presence of a vinyl bromide.

Normally, the stereochemistry of the alkene is retained throughout the reaction, except under harsh reaction conditions. A variety of alkenes may be used, and these include both α- and β-halo-α,β unsaturated ketones, esters, and sulfoxides (which normally need a copper (I) additive to proceed), and more (see example below). Vinyl triflates are also sometimes used. Some reactions require the addition of LiCl and others are slowed down, implying that two mechanistic pathways are present.

Another class of common electrophiles are aryl and heterocyclic halides. As for the vinyl substrates, bromides and iodides are more common despite their greater expense. A multitude of aryl groups can be chosen, including rings substituted with electron donating substituents, biaryl rings, and more. Halogen-substituted heterocycles have also been used as coupling partners, including pyridines, furans, thiophenes, thiazoles, indoles, imidazoles, purines, uracil, cytosines, pyrimidines, and more (See below for table of heterocycles; halogens can be substituted at a variety of positions on each).

Below is an example of the use of Stille coupling to build complexity on heterocycles of nucleosides, such as purines. 

Aryl triflates and sulfonates are also couple to a wide variety of organostannane reagents. Triflates tend to react comparably to bromides in the Stille reaction.

Acyl chlorides are also used as coupling partners and can be used with a large range of organostannane, even alkyl-tin reagents, to produce ketones (see example below). However, it is sometimes difficult to introduce acyl chloride functional groups into large molecules with sensitive functional groups. An alternative developed to this process is the Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling reaction, which introduces the carbonyl group via carbon monoxide insertion.

Allylic, benzylic, and propargylic halides can also be coupled. While commonly employed, allylic halides proceed via an η3 transition state, allowing for coupling with the organostannane at either the α or γ position, occurring predominantly at the least substituted carbon (see example below). Alkenyl epoxides (adjacent epoxides and alkenes) can also undergo this same coupling through an η3 transition state as, opening the epoxide to an alcohol. While allylic and benzylic acetates are commonly used, propargylic acetates are unreactive with organostannanes.
===Stannane===
Organostannane reagents are common. Several are commercially available. Stannane reagents can be synthesized by the reaction of a Grignard or organolithium reagent with trialkyltin chlorides. For example, vinyltributyltin is prepared by the reaction of vinylmagnesium bromide with tributyltin chloride. Hydrostannylation of alkynes or alkenes provides many derivatives. Organotin reagents are air and moisture stable. Some reactions can even take place in water. They can be purified by chromatography. They are tolerant to most functional groups. Some organotin compounds are heavily toxic, especially trimethylstannyl derivatives.

The use of vinylstannane, or alkenylstannane reagents is widespread. In regards to limitations, both very bulky stannane reagents and stannanes with substitution on the α-carbon tend to react sluggishly or require optimization. For example, in the case below, the α-substituted vinylstannane only reacts with a terminal iodide due to steric hindrance. 

Arylstannane reagents are also common and both electron donating and electron withdrawing groups actually increase the rate of the transmetalation. This again implies that two mechanisms of transmetalation can occur. The only limitation to these reagents are substituents at the ortho-position as small as methyl groups can decrease the rate of reaction. A wide variety of heterocycles (see Electrophile section) can also be used as coupling partners (see example with a thiazole ring below).


Alkynylstannanes, the most reactive of stannanes, have also been used in Stille couplings. They are not usually needed as terminal alkynes can couple directly to palladium catalysts through their C-H bond via Sonogashira coupling. Allylstannanes have been reported to have worked, yet difficulties arise, like with allylic halides, with the difficulty in control regioselectivity for α and γ addition. Distannane and acyl stannane reagents have also been used in Stille couplings.

==Applications==

The Stille reaction has been used in the synthesis of a variety of polymers. However, the most widespread use of the Stille reaction is its use in organic syntheses, and specifically, in the synthesis of natural products.

===Natural product total synthesis===
Larry Overman&#x27;s 19-step enantioselective total synthesis of quadrigemine C involves a double Stille cross metathesis reaction. The complex organostannane is coupled onto two aryl iodide groups. After a double Heck cyclization, the product is achieved.

Panek&#x27;s 32 step enantioselective total synthesis of ansamycin antibiotic (+)-mycotrienol makes use of a late stage tandem Stille type macrocycle coupling. Here, the organostannane has two terminal tributyl tin groups attacked to an alkene. This organostannane &quot;stitches&quot; the two ends of the linear starting material into a macrocycle, adding the missing two methylene units in the process. After oxidation of the aromatic core with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) and deprotection with hydrofluoric acid yields the natural product in 54% yield for the 3 steps.
 Stephen F. Martin and coworkers&#x27; 21 step enantioselective total synthesis of the manzamine antitumor alkaloid Ircinal A makes use of a tandem one-pot Stille/Diels-Alder reaction. An alkene group is added to vinyl bromide, followed by an &quot;in situ&quot; Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the added alkene and the alkene in the pyrrolidine ring.
Numerous other total syntheses utilize the Stille reaction, including those of oxazolomycin, lankacidin C, onamide A, calyculin A, lepicidin A, ripostatin A, and lucilactaene. The image below displays the final natural product, the organohalide (blue), the organostannane (red), and the bond being formed (green and circled). From these examples, it is clear that the Stille reaction can be used both at the early stages of the synthesis (oxazolomycin and calyculin A), at the end of a convergent route (onamide A, lankacidin C, ripostatin A), or in the middle (lepicidin A and lucilactaene). The synthesis of ripostatin A features two concurrent Stille couplings followed by a ring-closing metathesis. The synthesis of lucilactaene features a middle subunit, having a borane on one side and a stannane on the other, allowing for Stille reactionfollowed by a subsequent Suzuki coupling.
==Variations==
In addition to performing the reaction in a variety of organic solvents, conditions have been devised which allow for a broad range of Stille couplings in aqueous solvent.

In the presence of Cu(I) salts, palladium-on-carbon has been shown to be an effective catalyst.

In the realm of green chemistry a Stille reaction is reported taking place in a low melting and highly polar mixture of a sugar such as mannitol, a urea such as dimethylurea and a salt such as ammonium chloride
. The catalyst system is with triphenylarsine:

===Stille–carbonylative cross-coupling===
A common alteration to the Stille coupling is the incorporation of a carbonyl group between R1 and R2, serving as an efficient method to form ketones. This process is extremely similar to the initial exploration by Migita and Stille (see History) of coupling organostannane to acyl chlorides. However, these moieties are not always readily available and can be difficult to form, especially in the presence of sensitive functional groups. Furthermore, controlling their high reactivity can be challenging. The Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling employs the same conditions as the Stille coupling, except with an atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO) being used. The CO can coordinate to the palladium catalyst (9) after initial oxidative addition, followed by CO insertion into the Pd-R1 bond (10), resulting in subsequent reductive elimination to the ketone (12). The transmetalation step is normally the rate-determining step.

Larry Overman and coworkers make use of the Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling in their 20-step enantioselective total synthesis of strychnine. The added carbonyl is later converted to a terminal alkene via a Wittig reaction, allowing for the key tertiary nitrogen and the pentacyclic core to be formed via an aza-Cope-Mannich reaction.

Giorgio Ortar et al. explored how the Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling could be used to synthesize benzophenone phosphores. These were embedded into 4-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine peptides and used for their photoaffinity labelling properties to explore various peptide-protein interactions.

Louis Hegedus&#x27; 16-step racemic total synthesis of Jatraphone involved a Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling as its final step to form the 11-membered macrocycle. Instead of a halide, a vinyl triflate is used there as the coupling partner.
===Stille–Kelly coupling===
Using the seminal publication by Eaborn in 1976, which forms arylstannanes from arylhalides and distannanes, T. Ross Kelly applied this process to the intramolecular coupling of arylhalides. This tandem stannylation/aryl halide coupling was used for the syntheses of a variety of dihydrophenanthrenes. Most of the internal rings formed are limited to 5 or 6 members, however some cases of macrocyclization have been reported. Unlike a normal Stille coupling, chlorine does not work as a halogen, possibly due to its lower reactivity in the halogen sequence (its shorter bond length and stronger bond dissociation energy makes it more difficult to break via oxidative addition). Starting in the middle of the scheme below and going clockwise, the palladium catalyst (1) oxidatively adds to the most reactive C-X bond (13) to form 14, followed by transmetalation with distannane (15) to yield 16 and reductive elimination to yield an arylstannane (18). The regenerated palladium catalyst (1) can oxidative add to the second C-X bond of 18 to form 19, followed by intramolecular transmetalation to yield 20, followed by reductive elimination to yield the coupled product (22).

Jie Jack Lie et al. made use of the Stille-Kelly coupling in their synthesis of a variety of benzo[4,5]furopyridines ring systems. They invoke a three-step process, involving a Buchwald-Hartwig amination, another palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction, followed by an intramolecular Stille-Kelly coupling. Note that the aryl-iodide bond will oxidatively add to the palladium faster than either of the aryl-bromide bonds.

<text>Major Parkash Singh VC (31 March 1913 – 23 March 1991) was a Sikh Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==

Parkash Singh was born on 31 March 1913 in Sharikar village, in the Lyallpur District of what was British India (now modern Pakistan) into a Jat Sikh family. He enlisted in the 8th Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army on 21 November 1936, seeing service on the North-West Frontier. During the Second World War, Singh was a 28-year-old Havildar serving in the Bren Gun Carrier Platoon of 5th Battalion 8th Punjab Regiment, British Indian Army (now 5th Battalion The Baloch Regiment of Pakistan Army). In January 1943, his battalion was engaged in fighting on the Mayu Peninsula in the Arakan, Burma, against Japanese forces, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

:On 6 January 1943, the Bren Gun Carrier Platoon of 5/8th Punjab was attacked by a strong Japanese patrol near Donbaik on the Mayu Peninsula. The Platoon Commander was wounded and was forced to retire, handing over the command to Havildar Parkash Singh. Parkash Singh noticed two other carriers bogged down in a &quot;nullah&quot;, and under heavy Japanese fire. He immediately rushed to the rescue of the stricken carriers; calling on their crews to abandon the vehicles and run for safety while he provided covering fire. When his Bren gunner was wounded, he took control of the gun from him, and charged towards the enemy. Driving with one hand and firing the Bren gun with the other, he drove them out of their fixed positions. As he returned to pick the crews of the stranded carriers, he came under heavy enemy fire, but calmly rescued all eight men. On 19 January, the battalion carriers again came under heavy anti-tank fire in the same area, and several of them were destroyed including that of the Platoon Commander. The crews of the destroyed vehicles were given up for dead, and the rest of the carriers withdrew. But Parkash Singh wanted to see for himself if there were any survivors among the burning wrecks. Driving down the beach under intense enemy fire, he found the officer and his driver in their badly damaged carrier. The men were too badly injured to be moved, so Parkash Singh decided to tow their vehicle to safety. Despite the order of his Platoon Commander to go back and save himself, the fearless NCO rigged a makeshift tow chain and secured it to the damaged carrier, all the time exposed to enemy fire, and then towed it back to safety. For his feats of cool courage and selfless devotion on 6 and 19 January 1943, Havildar Parkash Singh was awarded the Victoria Cross although the initial recommendation was for a VC and Bar.
On 15 August 1943, Singh was commissioned in the VCO (Viceroy&#x27;s Commissioned Officer - the present-day Junior Commissioned Officer) rank of &quot;jemadar&quot; (now &quot;naib subedar&quot;), with the war-substantive rank of &quot;subedar&quot;. Singh remained in the Indian Army post-Independence, transferring to the Sikh Regiment as 8 Punjab had been allotted to the Pakistan Army. Effective 19 July 1948, he was selected for a short-service commission in the rank of lieutenant (seniority from 19 July 1946), and received a regular commission in the same rank on 6 October 1952. He was promoted to captain and then to major on 19 July 1961, retiring on 21 November 1968 after 32 years of service. He died in 1991 aged 77, whilst undergoing heart surgery in England, at Ealing, London. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>The Suzuki reaction or Suzuki coupling is an organic reaction that uses a palladium complex catalyst to cross-couple a boronic acid to an organohalide. It was first published in 1979 by Akira Suzuki, and he shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Richard F. Heck and Ei-ichi Negishi for their contribution to the discovery and development of noble metal catalysis in organic synthesis. This reaction is sometimes telescoped with the related Miyaura borylation; the combination is the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction. It is widely used to synthesize polyolefins, styrenes, and substituted biphenyls. 

The general scheme for the Suzuki reaction is shown below, where a carbon–carbon single bond is formed by coupling a halide (R1-X) with an organoboron species (R2-BY2) using a palladium catalyst and a base. The organoboron species is usually synthesized by hydroboration or carboboration, allowing for rapid generation of molecular complexity.

Several reviews have been published describing advancements and the development of the Suzuki reaction.

==Reaction mechanism==
The mechanism of the Suzuki reaction is best viewed from the perspective of the palladium catalyst. The catalytic cycle is initiated by the formation of an active Pd0 catalytic species, A. This participates in the oxidative addition of palladium to the halide reagent 1 to form the organopalladium intermediate B. Reaction (metathesis) with base gives intermediate C, which via transmetalation with the boron-ate complex D (produced by reaction of the boronic acid reagent 2 with base) forms the transient organopalladium species E. Reductive elimination step leads to the formation of the desired product 3 and restores the original palladium catalyst A which completes the catalytic cycle.

The Suzuki coupling takes place in the presence of a base and for a long time the role of the base was not fully understood. The base was first believed to form a trialkyl borate (R3B-OR), in the case of a reaction of a trialkylborane (BR3) and alkoxide (−OR); this species could be considered as being more nucleophilic and then more reactive towards the palladium complex present in the transmetalation step. Duc and coworkers investigated the role of the base in the reaction mechanism for the Suzuki coupling and they found that the base has three roles: Formation of the palladium complex [ArPd(OR)L2], formation of the trialkyl borate and the acceleration of the reductive elimination step by reaction of the alkoxide with the palladium complex.

===Oxidative addition===

In most cases the oxidative addition is the rate determining step of the catalytic cycle. During this step, the palladium catalyst is oxidized from palladium(0) to palladium(II). The catalytically active palladium species A is coupled with the aryl halide substrate 1 to yield an organopalladium complex B. As seen in the diagram below, the oxidative addition step breaks the carbon-halogen bond where the palladium is now bound to both the halogen (X) as well as the R1 group.

Oxidative addition proceeds with retention of stereochemistry with vinyl halides, while giving inversion of stereochemistry with allylic and benzylic halides. The oxidative addition initially forms the cis–palladium complex, which rapidly isomerizes to the trans-complex.

The Suzuki coupling occurs with retention of configuration on the double bonds for both the organoboron reagent or the halide. However, the configuration of that double bond, &quot;cis&quot; or &quot;trans&quot; is determined by the &quot;cis&quot;-to-&quot;trans&quot; isomerization of the palladium complex in the oxidative addition step where the trans palladium complex is the predominant form. When the organoboron is attached to a double bond and it is coupled to an alkenyl halide the product is a diene as shown below.

===Transmetalation===

Transmetalation is an organometallic reaction where ligands are transferred from one species to another. In the case of the Suzuki coupling the ligands are transferred from the organoboron species D to the palladium(II) complex C where the base that was added in the prior step is exchanged with the R2 substituent on the organoboron species to give the new palladium(II) complex E. The exact mechanism of transmetalation for the Suzuki coupling remains to be discovered. The organoboron compounds do not undergo transmetalation in the absence of base and it is therefore widely believed that the role of the base is to activate the organoboron compound as well as facilitate the formation of R1-Pdll-O&quot;t&quot;Bu intermediate (C) from oxidative addition product R1-Pdll-X (B).

===Reductive elimination===

The final step is the reductive elimination step where the palladium(II) complex (E) eliminates the product (3) and regenerates the palladium(0) catalyst (A). Using deuterium labelling, Ridgway &quot;et al.&quot; have shown the reductive elimination proceeds with retention of stereochemistry.

The ligand plays an important role in the Suzuki reaction. Typically, the phosphine ligand is used in the Suzuki reaction. Phosphine ligand increases the electron density at the metal center of the complex and therefore helps in the oxidative addition step. In addition, the bulkiness of substitution of the phosphine ligand helps in the reductive elimination step. However, &quot;N&quot;-heterocyclic carbene ligands have recently been used in this cross coupling, due to the instability of the phosphine ligand under Suzuki reaction conditions. &quot;N&quot;-Heterocyclic carbenes are more electron rich and bulky than the phosphine ligand. Therefore, both the steric and electronic factors of the &quot;N&quot;-heterocyclic carbene ligand help to stabilize active Pd(0) catalyst.

==Advantages==
The advantages of Suzuki coupling over other similar reactions include availability of common boronic acids, mild reaction conditions, and its less toxic nature. Boronic acids are less toxic and safer for the environment than organotin and organozinc compounds. It is easy to remove the inorganic by-products from the reaction mixture. Further, this reaction is preferable because it uses relatively cheap and easily prepared reagents. Being able to use water as a solvent makes this reaction more economical, eco-friendly, and practical to use with a variety of water-soluble reagents. A wide variety of reagents can be used for the Suzuki coupling, e.g., aryl or vinyl boronic acids and aryl or vinyl halides. Work has also extended the scope of the reaction to incorporate alkyl bromides. In addition to many different type of halides being possible for the Suzuki coupling reaction, the reaction also works with pseudohalides such as triflates (OTf), as replacements for halides. The relative reactivity for the coupling partner with the halide or pseudohalide is: R2–I &gt; R2–OTf &gt; R2–Br ≫ R2–Cl. Boronic esters and organotrifluoroborate salts may be used instead of boronic acids. The catalyst can also be a palladium nanomaterial-based catalyst. With a novel organophosphine ligand (SPhos), a catalyst loading of down to 0.001 mol% has been reported. These advances and the overall flexibility of the process have made the Suzuki coupling widely accepted for chemical synthesis.

==Applications==
===Industrial applications===
The Suzuki coupling reaction is scalable and cost-effective for use in the synthesis of intermediates for pharmaceuticals or fine chemicals. The Suzuki reaction was once limited by high levels of catalyst and the limited availability of boronic acids. Replacements for halides were also found, increasing the number of coupling partners for the halide or pseudohalide as well. Scaled up reactions have been carried out in the synthesis of a number of important biological compounds such as CI-1034 which used triflate and boronic acid coupling partners which was run on an 80 kilogram scale with a 95% yield.

Another example is the coupling of 3-pyridylborane and 1-bromo-3-(methylsulfonyl)benzene that formed an intermediate that was used in the synthesis of a potential central nervous system agent. The coupling reaction to form the intermediate produced 278 kilograms in a 92.5% yield.

Significant efforts have been put into the development of heterogeneous catalysts for the Suzuki CC reaction, motivated by the performance gains in the industrial process (eliminating the catalyst separation from the substrate), and recently a Pd single atom heterogeneous catalyst has been shown to outperform the industry default homogeneous Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst.

===Synthetic applications===
The Suzuki coupling has been frequently used in syntheses of complex compounds. The Suzuki coupling has been used on a citronellal derivative for the synthesis of caparratriene, a natural product that is highly active against leukemia:

==Variations==
===Metal catalyst===
Various catalytic uses of metals other than palladium (especially nickel) have been developed. The first nickel catalyzed cross-coupling reaction was reported by Percec and co-workers in 1995 using aryl mesylates and boronic acids. Even though a higher amount of nickel catalyst was needed for the reaction, around 5 mol %, nickel is not as expensive or as precious a metal as palladium. The nickel catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction also allowed a number of compounds that did not work or worked worse for the palladium catalyzed system than the nickel-catalyzed system. The use of nickel catalysts has allowed for electrophiles that proved challenging for the original Suzuki coupling using palladium, including substrates such as phenols, aryl ethers, esters, phosphates, and fluorides.

Investigation into the nickel catalyzed cross-coupling continued and increased the scope of the reaction after these first examples were shown and the research interest grew. Miyaura and Inada reported in 2000 that a cheaper nickel catalyst could be utilized for the cross-coupling, using triphenylphosphine (PPh3) instead of the more expensive ligands previously used. However, the nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling still required high catalyst loadings (3-10%), required excess ligand (1-5 equivalents) and remained sensitive to air and moisture. Advancements by Han and co-workers have tried to address that problem by developing a method using low amounts of nickel catalyst (&lt;1 mol%) and no additional equivalents of ligand.

It was also reported by Wu and co-workers in 2011 that a highly active nickel catalyst for the cross-coupling of aryl chlorides could be used that only required 0.01-0.1 mol% of nickel catalyst. They also showed that the catalyst could be recycled up to six times with virtually no loss in catalytic activity. The catalyst was recyclable because it was a phosphine nickel nanoparticle catalyst (G3DenP-Ni) that was made from dendrimers.

Advantages and disadvantages apply to both the palladium and nickel-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reactions. Apart from Pd and Ni catalyst system, cheap and non-toxic metal sources like iron and copper have been used in Suzuki coupling reaction. The Bedford research group and the Nakamura research group have extensively worked on developing the methodology of iron catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction. Ruthenium is another metal source that has been used in Suzuki coupling reaction.

=== Amide coupling ===
Nickel catalysis can construct C-C bonds from amides. Despite the inherently inert nature of amides as synthons, the following methodology can be used to prepare C-C bonds. The coupling procedure is mild and tolerant of myriad functional groups, including: amines, ketones, heterocycles, groups with acidic protons. This technique can also be used to prepare bioactive molecules and to unite heterocycles in controlled ways through shrewd sequential cross-couplings. A general review of the reaction scheme is given below.
The synthesis of a tubulin-binding compound (antiproliferative agent) was carried out using a trimethoxybenzamide and an indolyl pinacolatoboron coupling partner on a gram scale.
===Organoboranes===
Aryl boronic acids are comparatively cheaper than other organoboranes and a wide variety of aryl boronic acids are commercially available. Hence, it has been widely used in Suzuki reaction as an organoborane partner. Aryltrifluoroborate salts are another class of organoboranes that are frequently used because they are less prone to protodeboronation compared to aryl boronic acids. They are easy to synthesize and can be easily purified. Aryltrifluoroborate salts can be formed from boronic acids by the treatment with potassium hydrogen fluoride which can then be used in the Suzuki coupling reaction.

===Solvent variations===
The Suzuki coupling reaction is different from other coupling reactions in that it can be run in biphasic organic-water, water-only, or no solvent. This increased the scope of coupling reactions, as a variety of water-soluble bases, catalyst systems, and reagents could be used without concern over their solubility in organic solvent. Use of water as a solvent system is also attractive because of the economic and safety advantages. Frequently used in solvent systems for Suzuki coupling are toluene, THF, dioxane, and DMF. The most frequently used bases are K2CO3, KO&quot;t&quot;Bu, Cs2CO3, K3PO4, NaOH, and NEt3.

<text>An ion-exchange resin or ion-exchange polymer is a resin or polymer that acts as a medium for ion exchange, that is also known as an ionex. It is an insoluble matrix (or support structure) normally in the form of small (0.25–1.43 mm radius) microbeads, usually white or yellowish, fabricated from an organic polymer substrate. The beads are typically porous (with a specific size distribution that will affect its properties), providing a large surface area on and inside them where the trapping of ions occurs along with the accompanying release of other ions, and thus the process is called ion exchange. There are multiple types of ion-exchange resin, that differ in composition if the target is an anion or a cation. Most commercial resins are made of polystyrene sulfonate, followed up by polyacrylate.

Ion-exchange resins are widely used in different separation, purification, and decontamination processes. The most common examples are water softening and water purification. In many cases, ion-exchange resins were introduced in such processes as a more flexible alternative to the use of natural or artificial zeolites. Also, ion-exchange resins are highly effective in the biodiesel filtration process.

==Types of resins==
Most typical ion-exchange resins are based on crosslinked polystyrene. The actual ion-exchanging sites are introduced after polymerisation. Additionally, in the case of polystyrene, crosslinking is introduced by copolymerisation of styrene and a few percent of divinylbenzene. Crosslinking decreases ion-exchange capacity of the resin and prolongs the time needed to accomplish the ion-exchange processes but improves the robustness of the resin. Particle size also influences the resin parameters; smaller particles have larger outer surface, but cause larger head loss in the column processes.

Besides being made as bead-shaped materials, ion-exchange resins are also produced as membranes. These ion-exchange membranes, which are made of highly cross-linked ion-exchange resins that allow passage of ions, but not of water, are used for electrodialysis.

Four main types of ion-exchange resins differ in their functional groups:
* strongly acidic cation (SAC), typically featuring sulfonic acid groups, e.g. sodium polystyrene sulfonate or polyAMPS, often used for water softening and demineralization operations. 
* strongly basic anion (SBA), typically featuring quaternary amino groups, for example, trimethylammonium groups, e.g. polyAPTAC), good for silica, uranium, nitrates removal. 
* weakly acidic cation (WAC), typically featuring carboxylic acid groups. An ideal choice for dealkalization part and also for softening streams with high salinity levels. 
* weakly basic anion (WBA), typically featuring primary, secondary, and/or tertiary amino groups, e.g. polyethylene amine. Are effective for demineralization where removal of SiO2 and CO2 are not required. Also effective for acid absorption.

Specialised ion-exchange resins are also known such as chelating resins (iminodiacetic acid, thiourea-based resins, and many others).

Anion resins and cation resins are the two most common resins used in the ion-exchange process. While anion resins attract negatively charged ions, cation resins attract positively charged ions.

=== Anion-exchange resins ===
Formula: R-OH basic

Anion resins may be either strongly or weakly basic. Strongly basic anion resins maintain their negative charge across a wide pH range, whereas weakly basic anion resins are neutralized at higher pH levels. Weakly basic resins do not maintain their charge at a high pH because they undergo deprotonation. They do, however, offer excellent mechanical and chemical stability. This, combined with a high rate of ion exchange, make weakly base anion resins well suited for the organic salts.

For anion resins, regeneration typically involves treatment of the resin with a strongly basic solution, e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide. During regeneration, the regenerant chemical is passed through the resin, and trapped negative ions are flushed out, renewing the resin exchange capacity.

=== Cation-exchange resin ===
Formula: R−H acidic

The cation exchange method removes the hardness of water but induces acidity in it, which is further removed in the next stage of treatment of water by passing this acidic water through an anion exchange process.

Reaction:
:R−H + M+ = R−M + H+.

Similar to anion resins, in cation resins the regeneration involves the use of a strongly acidic solution, e.g. aqueous hydrochloric acid. During regeneration, the regenerant chemical passes through the resin and flushes out the trapped positive ions, renewing the resin exchange capacity.

=== Anion-exchange resin ===
Formula: –NR4+OH−

Often these are styrene–divinylbenzene copolymer resins that have quaternary ammonium cations as an integral part of the resin matrix.

Reaction:

: –NR4+OH− + HCl = –NR4+Cl− + H2O.

Anion-exchange chromatography makes use of this principle to extract and purify materials from mixtures or solutions.

== Characteristics ==
Ion exchange resins are often described according to some of the following features.
* Capacity: Represents the amount of ions that can be exchanged/stored per unit of mass of the resin. Typically is expressed in miligrams of ion per gram of resin (mg/g).
* Swelling: Into contact with solvent, resins can swell (increase in volume). The swelling behavior of a resin is influenced by its chemical composition, polymer structure, and cross-linking. Resins with a higher degree of cross-linking tend to exhibit lower swelling tendencies compared to those with lower cross-linking. Swelling is typically expressed as the percentage increase in volume or weight of the resin when exposed to a specific solvent. 
* Selectivity: Refers to the resin&#x27;s preference or ability to selectively adsorb or exchange certain ions over others. It is a fundamental property that determines the resin&#x27;s effectiveness in separating or removing specific ions from a solution.
* Stability: The integrity of the resin can be described in terms of mechanical and chemical resilience of the beads.

== Pores ==
The pore media of the resin particles is one of the most important parameters for the efficiency of the product. These pores make different functions depending on their sizes and are the main feature responsible for the mass transfer between phases making the whole ion exchange process possible. There are three main types of pore sizes:

* Micropore: With a Slit width less than 2 nm, they are usually found at the end of larger pores and their main characteristic is to have superimposed wall potentials. This means, the particles inside them feel attracted towards their solid walls so they make contact with the active sites.
* Mesopore: With a Slit width between 2 and 50 nm these mid-size pores have the main objective to withhold capillary condensation and is usually found before the micropores.
* Macropore: With a Slit width bigger than 50 nm, these are the biggest size pores with the main purpose of being the main path for the molecules to enter the particle and later on redistribute through the other smaller channels

==Uses==
===Water softening===

In this application, Ion-exchange resins are used to replace the magnesium and calcium ions found in hard water with sodium ions. When the resin is fresh, it contains sodium ions at its active sites. When in contact with a solution containing magnesium and calcium ions (but a low concentration of sodium ions), the magnesium and calcium ions preferentially migrate out of solution to the active sites on the resin, being replaced in solution by sodium ions. This process reaches equilibrium with a much lower concentration of magnesium and calcium ions in solution than was started with.
The resin can be recharged by washing it with a solution containing a high concentration of sodium ions (e.g. it has large amounts of common salt (NaCl) dissolved in it). The calcium and magnesium ions migrate from the resin, being replaced by sodium ions from the solution until a new equilibrium is reached. The salt is used to recharge an ion-exchange resin, which itself is used to soften the water.

===Water purification===

In this application, ion-exchange resins are used to remove poisonous (e.g. copper) and hazardous metal (e.g. lead or cadmium) ions from solution, replacing them with more innocuous ions, such as sodium and potassium, in the process cation and anion exchange resins are used to remove dissolved ions from the water.

Few ion-exchange resins remove chlorine or organic contaminants from water – this is usually done by using an activated charcoal filter mixed in with the resin. There are some ion-exchange resins that do remove organic ions, such as MIEX (magnetic ion-exchange) resins. Domestic water purification resin is not usually recharged – the resin is discarded when it can no longer be used.

Water of highest purity is required for electronics, scientific experiments, production of superconductors, and nuclear industry, among others. Such water is produced using ion-exchange processes or combinations of membrane and ion-exchange methods.

===Ion exchange in metal separation===

Ion-exchange processes are used to separate and purify metals, including separating uranium from plutonium and other actinides, including thorium; and lanthanum, neodymium, ytterbium, samarium, lutetium, from each other and the other lanthanides. There are two series of rare-earth metals, the lanthanides and the actinides. Members of each family have very similar chemical and physical properties. Ion exchange was for many years the only practical way to separate the rare earths in large quantities. This application was developed in the 1940s by Frank Spedding. Subsequently, solvent extraction has mostly supplanted use of ion-exchange resins except for the highest-purity products.

A very important case is the PUREX process (plutonium-uranium extraction process), which is used to separate the plutonium and the uranium from the spent fuel products from a nuclear reactor, and to be able to dispose of the waste products. Then, the plutonium and uranium are available for making nuclear-energy materials, such as new reactor fuel and nuclear weapons.

Ion-exchange beads are also an essential component in in-situ leach uranium mining. In-situ recovery involves the extraction of uranium-bearing water (grading as low as 0.05% U3O8) through boreholes. The extracted uranium solution is then filtered through the resin beads. Through an ion-exchange process, the resin beads attract uranium from the solution. Uranium-loaded resins are then transported to a processing plant, where U3O8 is separated from the resin beads, and yellowcake is produced. The resin beads can then be returned to the ion-exchange facility, where they are reused.

The ion-exchange process is also used to separate other sets of very similar chemical elements, such as zirconium and hafnium, which incidentally is also very important for the nuclear industry. Zirconium is practically transparent to free neutrons, used in building reactors, but hafnium is a very strong absorber of neutrons, used in reactor control rods.

===Catalysis===
Ion exchange resins are used in organic synthesis, e.g. for esterification and hydrolysis. Being high surface area and insoluble, they are suitable for vapor-phase and liquid-phase reactions. Examples can be found where basic (OH−-form) of ion exchange resins are used to neutralize of ammonium salts and convert quaternary ammonium halides to hydroxides. Acidic (H+-form) ion exchange resins have been used as solid acid catalysts for scission of ether protecting groups. and for rearrangement reactions.

===Juice purification===
Ion-exchange resins are used in the manufacture of fruit juices such as orange and cranberry juice, where they are used to remove bitter-tasting components and so improve the flavor. This allows tart or poorer-tasting fruit sources to be used for juice production.

===Sugar manufacturing===
Ion-exchange resins are used in the manufacturing of sugar from various sources. They are used to help convert one type of sugar into another type of sugar, and to decolorize and purify sugar syrups.

===Pharmaceuticals===
Ion-exchange resins are used in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, not only for catalyzing certain reactions, but also for isolating and purifying pharmaceutical active ingredients.
Three ion-exchange resins, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, colestipol, and cholestyramine, are used as active ingredients. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a strongly acidic ion-exchange resin and is used to treat hyperkalemia. Colestipol is a weakly basic ion-exchange resin and is used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Cholestyramine is a strongly basic ion-exchange resin and is also used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Colestipol and cholestyramine are known as bile acid sequestrants.

Ion-exchange resins are also used as excipients in pharmaceutical formulations such as tablets, capsules, gums, and suspensions. In these uses the ion-exchange resin can have several different functions, including taste-masking, extended release, tablet disintegration, increased bioavailability, and improving the chemical stability of the active ingredients.

Selective polymeric chelators have been proposed for maintenance therapy of some pathologies, where chronic ion accumulation occurs, such as Wilson disease (where copper accumulation occurs) or hereditary hemochromatosis (iron overload, where iron accumulation occurs) These polymers or particles have a negligible or null systemic biological availability and they are designed to form stable complexes with Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the GIT and thus limiting the uptake of these ions and their long-term accumulation. Although this method has only a limited efficacy, unlike small-molecular chelators (deferasirox, deferiprone, or deferoxamine), such an approach may have only minor side effects in sub-chronic studies. Interestingly, the simultaneous chelation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ increases the treatment efficacy.

===CO2 Capture from Ambient Air===
Anion exchange resins readily absorb CO2 when dry and release it again when exposed to moisture. This makes them one of the most promising materials for direct carbon capture from ambient air, or direct air capture, since the moisture swing replaces the more energy-intensive temperature swing or pressure swing used with other sorbents. A prototype demonstrating this process has been developed by Klaus Lackner at the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions.

<text>Strike Fighter Squadron 102 (VFA-102) is a United States Navy Strike Fighter squadron based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni. Their call sign is Diamond, with the tail code NF, and they fly the F/A-18F Super Hornet.

==History==
Two distinct squadrons have been designated VF-102. The first VF-102 was established on 1 May 1952 and redesignated VA-36 on 1 July 1955.

The second VF-102 was established in 1955, was eventually redesignated as VFA-102, and is the subject of the remainder of this article.

===1950s ===

Fighter Squadron 102 (VF-102), was established as VA-36 on 1 July 1955, and was immediately redesignated VF-102 on the same day (at the time, squadron designations were associated with their assigned airwing). The squadron was based at NAS Jacksonville flying the F2H Banshee. The squadron&#x27;s inaugural cruise took place aboard in July 1956. After returning from deployment, the squadron transitioned to the F4D Skyray. In addition to four 20 mm internal cannons, the Skyray carried the new AIM-9 Sidewinder missile.

===1960s===

The final cruise with the Skyray on &quot;Forrestal&quot; was January through August 1961 after the squadron had moved to NAS Oceana, Virginia. It subsequently transitioned to the F-4 Phantom beginning a 20-year association with the Phantom.

In 1964 and 1966 VF-102 won the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle &quot;E&quot; efficiency awards. Highlights during this period included participation in Operation Sea Orbit on board , and combat operations off Vietnam in 1968.

===1970s===
In 1975 and 1978, VF-102 conducted cross-deck operations aboard HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;.
In 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975: the squadron conducted four deployments to the Mediterranean Sea aboard USS &quot;Independence&quot; as part of Carrier Air Wing Seven, including a port call in Athens, Greece, when they had a political coup; air cover operations during the Yom Kippur War; and recovery of aircraft debris and bodies from TWA Flight 841 that crashed into the Mediterranean Sea after a terrorist bomb exploded in the hold.

===1980s ===
In June 1981 the squadron flew their last Phantom during an Indian Ocean cruise aboard . During the summer of 1981, the squadron transitioned to the F-14A Tomcat. With the new aircraft, the squadron also received a new mission in addition to their traditional fighter role—photo reconnaissance using the TARPS pod. The squadron deployed aboard in late 1982 to participate in the NATO Exercise Northern Wedding that required high temperature operations in the heavy seas north of the British Isles, garnering considerable attention from Soviet Tu-95D Bear reconnaissance aircraft. The first Tomcat deployment with Carrier Air Wing One began in 1983 and took USS &quot;America&quot; through the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean. Two VF-102 Tomcats, flying a routine TARPS mission over Somalia were fired upon by an SA-2 SAM site and AAA in April 1983. Both aircraft returned without damage.

VF-102 deployed in 1984 with the first KA-93 LOROP camera and ARC-182 Have Quick radios, conducting Operational Evaluation for both systems at sea. In 1985, USS &quot;America&quot; participated in the NATO exercise Ocean Safari and again conducted operations in the challenging seas and low visibility conditions near the Arctic Circle and inside Vestfjord, Norway. While operating northwest of Ireland, a VF-102 TARPS aircrew flew an unprecedented 1200 nm TARPS mission to locate a Soviet Kynda Class Cruiser transiting the English Channel. In March 1986, the squadron deployed on board USS &quot;America&quot;, headed for the Gulf of Sidra joining and to challenge the Libyan proclaimed Line of Death. A VF-102 Tomcat was first to be fired on by a Libyan SA-5 and AAA while flying Combat Air Patrol for Operation Attain Document. A month later VF-102 flew cover for US Navy and US Air Force bombers in Operation El Dorado Canyon.

===1990s===
In late 1990, USS &quot;America&quot; joined and &quot;Saratoga&quot; in the Red Sea as part of Operation Desert Shield, arriving the day operations were to begin. USS &quot;America&quot; remained part of the Red Sea Battle Force until directed to join , and in the Persian Gulf. In the six-week campaign, VF-102 logged more than 1400 combat flight hours.
The squadron embarked on USS &quot;America&quot; again in December 1991 for a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf.

In early August 1993, the squadron embarked on USS &quot;America&quot; to begin their third Mediterranean deployment in three years. During this deployment the squadron conducted humanitarian operations off the coast of Bosnia-Herzegovina supporting Operation Provide Promise and Operation Deny Flight. In late October the squadron supported Operation Restore Hope off the coast of Mogadishu, Somalia. By mid-December they were supporting Operation Southern Watch in Iraq.

In June 1994, the squadron returned to NAS Oceana and transitioned to the F-14B aircraft. The squadron&#x27;s 1995–1996 Mediterranean cruise began with an emergency sortie to the Adriatic Sea to take part in Operation Deliberate Force. They then proceeded to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch. Placement of U.S. ground forces in Bosnia, led to another &quot;America&quot; emergency sortie back to the Adriatic in December. The squadron remained in the Adriatic for the remainder of the cruise, logging more than 4,000 hours and over 1,900 traps during the deployment.

With the disestablishment VF-33, VF-102 became &quot;America&quot;″s sole F-14 unit, completing its final deployment on 24 February 1996. Upon &quot;America&quot;″s decommissioning in 1996, VF-102 (and the rest of CVW-1) was assigned to .

In 1997, the squadron deployed aboard &quot;George Washington&quot;. A port visit to Haifa, Israel was cut short late in November as the carrier battle group was ordered to the Persian Gulf in response to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s barring UN weapon inspectors from carrying out their assigned tasks. As the crisis grew &quot;George Washington&quot; joined and . VF-102 returned to Norfolk on 13 March 1998.

In Autumn 1999, VF-102 deployed again to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch over southern Iraq. VF-102 carried out strikes on numerous anti-aircraft and radar sites and conducted numerous TARPS missions.

===2000s===
On 19 September 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks, VF-102 began a scheduled deployment to the Arabian Sea as a part of Operation Enduring Freedom and began combat operations. During that deployment VF-102 flew 5,000 combat hours and dropped 680 bombs as well as guiding more than 50,000 pounds of precision guided munitions launched by other aircraft, VF-102 dropped more ordnance and flew more combat hours than any other F-14 unit during the war in 2001 and 2002. In addition, as part of the USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; Battle Group they were at sea for 159 consecutive days, breaking a 20-year-old record.

Following the return from deployment, the squadron moved to NAS Lemoore, California to begin transition training in the F/A-18F. Upon completion, the squadron again changed homeport to Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan.

VFA-102 deployed to the Pacific Ocean aboard in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, taking part in several military exercises, including Orange Crush, Talisman Saber, Jasex, and Valiant Shield.

In March 2008, VFA-102 was named the Pacific Fleet Battle &quot;E&quot; award winner for the calendar year of 2007, recognizing their readiness to perform wartime tasks amongst all F/A-18E/F squadrons in the Pacific Fleet. In March 2010, the squadron was again awarded the Pacific Fleet Battle &quot;E&quot;.

In the spring of 2008, VFA-102 embarked on USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; for her final deployment. Following a crossdeck in San Diego, the air wing is currently assigned to .

In 2010, the squadron transitioned to Block II Super Hornets equipped with the AN/APG-79 AESA radar.

In 2021, VFA-102 flew combat missions into Afghanistan as part of the US&#x27;s Afghanistan retrograde.

<text>The People&#x27;s Unity Party – Socialist Party (), generally referred to as the Socialist Party (), was an Icelandic political party that functioned from 1938 to 1968, when the People&#x27;s Alliance party was created.

== History ==

It was formed through the merger of the Communist Party of Iceland (KFI) and another splinter group from the Social Democratic Party on the grounds that a united front was needed against fascism, according to the guidelines put forth by the Comintern. The formation of the Socialist Party was a result of the Popular Front line embraced by ComIntern, and promoted in Iceland by Einar Olgeirsson of the KFI. Philosopher Jon Olafsson has argued that as it resulted in a split within the larger Social Democratic Party, Comintern did not approve of the merger in its eventual form. This has been contested by historians Thor Whitehead and Hannes H. Gissurarson in books about the communist movement.
The Socialist Party maintained cordial relations with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1939, the chairmanship was taken over by Einar Olgeirsson, after the previous non-communist chairman had left the party in protest against the refusal of his new allies to condemn the attack by the USSR on Finland in the Winter War.

During the Second World War, the influence of the party grew. In the 1942 elections it won over its mother organization, the Social Democrats. The Socialist Party clearly supported the formation of the Icelandic Republic in 1944. During the two first years of independence, the Socialist Party took part in a broad coalition government. The coalition broke down on the issue of the claims of the United States to have a military base in Keflavík, which the socialists opposed.

In 1956, the Socialist Party took part in the People&#x27;s Alliance along with the Egalitarian Society and Hannibal Valdimarsson. When the People&#x27;s Alliance was made into a formal political party in 1968, the Socialist Party was merged into it and thus became defunct as an independent entity.

<text>Charlotte Ann Martin (born October 31, 1976) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performs predominantly on the piano. She has published several studio albums, two of which have received mainstream commercial releases: 2004&#x27;s &quot;On Your Shore&quot; and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Stromata&quot;. In 2009, she issued an instrumental piano album titled &quot;Piano Trees&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Dancing on Needles&quot;, on February 1, 2011.

==Personal life==
Martin grew up in Charleston, Illinois. Her father is a music professor at Eastern Illinois University. Martin won the Miss Illinois Teen USA 1994 title on June 26 and went on to compete in the Miss Teen USA pageant in Biloxi, Mississippi, on August 16. She graduated from Eastern Illinois University in 1998 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in vocal performance, majoring in opera. In 1999, she moved to Los Angeles. On September 30, 2005, she married musician/producer Ken Andrews. Their first child, a boy, was born on May 4, 2008; their second, a daughter, on March 9, 2011.

Following the birth of her first child, Martin suffered from intercostal neuralgia that left her incapacitated for the better part of a year, causing lengthy delays to the writing and recording process of her album &quot;Dancing on Needles&quot;.

On August 11, 2017, Martin filed for divorce from Andrews.

==Career==
===Early material===
Prior to the release of her major-label debut, &quot;On Your Shore&quot;, Martin had composed two full-length albums and two EPs. Her first foray into songwriting came in the form of &quot;Mystery, Magic &amp; Seeds&quot; (1998), an album Martin wrote as a result of a friend&#x27;s death, which she now considers juvenilia, but which is available for download from archive.org. Her second album, &quot;One Girl Army&quot;, remained unreleased, though an EP of the same name containing a few selections from the full-length record was published independently in 2000, and Martin still performs some of its content live. The masters for this album are now owned by Martin&#x27;s former label, RCA Records.

In 2002, Martin independently released a limited-edition EP containing eight tracks, called &quot;Test-Drive Songs&quot;, which is now out of print but still available for download on her official website.

In 2003, Martin released another EP, titled &quot;In Parentheses&quot;, on RCA. It contained four tracks, one of which (&quot;Your Armor&quot;) would later be included (with an added string arrangement) on &quot;On Your Shore&quot;.

===&quot;On Your Shore&quot;===
On August 10, 2004, &quot;On Your Shore&quot;, Martin&#x27;s first full-length album on a major label, RCA, was released. A video for the single &quot;Every Time It Rains&quot; was also issued.

To help promote the album, Martin toured on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair, the Cardigans, and Katy Rose in 2004.

===&quot;Darkest Hour&quot; and &quot;Veins&quot;===
While touring, two EPs were released in preparation for Martin&#x27;s second album, &quot;Stromata&quot;. The first, &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;, included a cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Judas&quot;. The second EP, &quot;Veins&quot;, came out in November 2005.

On May 1, 2006, a DVD of Martin&#x27;s live recordings, titled &quot;Something Like a DVD&quot;, was published via Musictoday.

Martin co-wrote and contributed vocals to &quot;Glass Breaker&quot;, a song by the Crystal Method, included on the soundtrack to the 2005 romantic drama film &quot;London&quot;.

===&quot;Stromata&quot;, &quot;Orphans&quot;, and &quot;Piano Trees&quot;===
On September 12, 2006, Martin issued &quot;Stromata&quot; on her husband&#x27;s label, Dinosaur Fight Records.

Martin co-wrote and contributed vocals to the song &quot;Sweet Things&quot; on Tiësto&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Elements of Life&quot;. She also co-wrote and contributed vocals and piano to the song &quot;Is This How Love&#x27;s Supposed to Feel&quot; on Ben Lee&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Ripe&quot;. She co-wrote and contributed vocals to the song &quot;Feed the Monster&quot; by BT. The original song was never released, but a remix by Blue Stahli was.

On November 11, 2008, Martin released the EP &quot;Orphans&quot; and followed it a year later with the instrumental album &quot;Piano Trees&quot;.

===&quot;Dancing on Needles&quot;===
On February 1, 2011, Martin issued her fourth full-length album, &quot;Dancing on Needles&quot;. Produced by her husband, Ken Andrews (who had previously worked with Pete Yorn and Beck), the record traces Martin&#x27;s struggle with intercostal neuralgia, a nerve disorder that had left her incapacitated for much of the previous year. &quot;It was the most difficult period of my life&quot;, Martin stated. &quot;The pain was excruciating. I saw countless doctors, was misdiagnosed countless times and prescribed countless medications. Nothing seemed to help. Forget about not being able to work; getting out of bed was a major undertaking. Worst of all, I couldn&#x27;t nurse, or even lift, my baby. As a new mother, that was devastating&quot;.

The album was released on Martin&#x27;s Test-Drive Records and was preceded by the single &quot;Volcano&quot;.

===&quot;Water Breaks Stone&quot;, &quot;Rapture&quot;===
On February 25, 2014, Martin published &quot;Water Breaks Stone&quot;.

On March 27, 2017, she announced that she would no longer be touring: &quot;At this point in my life, it&#x27;s not possible for me to mount any long tours or even short ones. I&#x27;ve chosen to be a mommy and that&#x27;s my first priority. I still plan to be involved in music though and will do one-offs here and there if the timing&#x27;s right... [T]his is right for me and my family.&quot; She held a farewell tour between March and May and released &quot;Rapture&quot; on May 12, 2017.

===&quot;Clear Blue Sky&quot;, &quot;Monotonous Night&quot;, and &quot;Dawn&quot;===
On October 5, 2018, Martin released the second of her instrumental piano albums, titled &quot;Clear Blue Sky&quot;. The following year, two more albums in a similar vein were issued: &quot;Monotonous Night&quot; on March 8 and &quot;Dawn&quot; on December 27. Her latest release is the 2023 EP &quot;Knives &amp; Bouquets&quot;.

<doc id="1224105" wikidata="Q5056295" url="?curid=1224105" title="Cecil Noble">
<text>Lance Corporal Cecil Reginald Noble VC (4 June 1891 − 13 March 1915) was a British Army soldier and a posthumous English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was killed at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle during the First World War.

Noble was born in Bournemouth, then part of Hampshire, the son of Frederick Noble, a decorator, and his wife Hannah, née Smith. The family lived in Capstone Road and he attended St Clement&#x27;s Elementary School, and followed his father in working as a decorator. He disliked his given forename and was known by friends and family as Tommy.

He enlisted in the Rifle Brigade, British Army, in 1910. When he was 23 years old, and an acting Corporal in the 2nd Battalion, The Rifle Brigade, on the Western Front the following deed took place for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 12 March 1915 at Neuve Chapelle, France, when the advance of the battalion was impeded by wire entanglements and by very severe machine-gun fire, Corporal Noble and another man (Harry Daniels) voluntarily rushed in front and succeeded in cutting the wires. They were both wounded, and Corporal Noble later died of his injuries. Daniels survived to receive his Victoria Cross and later rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

Noble was buried at Longuenesse Souvenir Cemetery, two miles south of Saint-Omer, France, in plot I, row A, grave 57.

==Blue Plaque==

Noble is commemorated by a Blue Plaque in Capstone Road, Bournemouth, unveiled on 2 October 1995. The plaque gives Noble&#x27;s rank as Corporal, in line with the VC citation published in the London Gazette of 28 April 1915, but differing from the rank of Lance-Corporal, as used on his Commonwealth War Grave headstone. The plaque was erected at the same time as one to Frederick Charles Riggs VC, also in Capstone Road. Noble and Riggs are also commemorated on WWI centenary paving slabs by Bournemouth&#x27;s War Memorial in the Central Pleasure Gardens, and by neighbouring street names in the Wallisdown area of Bournemouth.

His VC is not publicly held.

<text>The statute of &quot;Circumspecte agatis&quot; (), or Circumspecte Agatis, was an English statute issued in 1285 by King Edward I. It defines the jurisdictions of Church and State, forcing church courts to confine themselves to ecclesiastical cases. This, along with the &quot;Articuli Cleri&quot; of Edward II, the Act of the 18th of Edward III (1344) and the Charter of Edward IV (1462), eventually settled this long-standing dispute.

The original statute issued by Edward I was a response to a dispute involving the bishop of Norwich. The instructions to the king&#x27;s judges were to:...use yourselves circumspectly in all matters concerning the Bishop of Norwich and his Clergy, not punishing them if they hold Plea in Court Christian, of such things as be meer spiritual, that is to wit, of Penance, enjoined by Prelates for deadly Sin, as Fornication, Adultery, and such like.

Nickerson was promoted to captain in 1901, returning to the United Kingdom at the end of the war in June 1902 on board the SS &quot;Soudan&quot;, arriving in Southampton in September that year. He was then posted to Egypt.

He served in the First World War, on the Western front and then at Salonika in Greece. By then a major, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1915 and Brevet Colonel in June 1918,
becoming a companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in May 1916, companion of the Order of the Bath in June 1919, and receiving the Greek Medal for Military Merit 3rd class.

<text>Archer John Porter Martin (1 March 1910 – 28 July 2002) was a British chemist who shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the invention of partition chromatography with Richard Synge.

==Early life==
Martin&#x27;s father was a GP. Martin was educated at Bedford School, and Peterhouse, Cambridge.

==Career==
Working first in the Physical Chemistry Laboratory, he moved to the Dunn Nutritional Laboratory, and in 1938 moved to Wool Industries Research Institution in Leeds. He was head of the biochemistry division of Boots Pure Drug Company from 1946 to 1948, when he joined the Medical Research Council. There, he was appointed head of the physical chemistry division of the National Institute for Medical Research in 1952, and was chemical consultant from 1956 to 1959.

He specialised in biochemistry, in some aspects of vitamins E and B2, and in techniques that laid the foundation for several new types of chromatography. He developed partition chromatography whilst working on the separation of amino acids, and later developed gas-liquid chromatography. Amongst many honours, he received his Nobel Prize in 1952.

After his retirement from the University of Sussex, he was visiting professor at both the University of Houston in Texas and the EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) in Switzerland.

He published far fewer papers than the typical Nobel winners—only 70 in all—but his ninth paper contained the work that would eventually win him the Nobel Prize. The University of Houston dropped him from its chemistry faculty in 1979 (when he was 69 years old) because he was not publishing enough.

==Awards==
Archer Martin shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the invention of partition chromatography with Richard Synge.

Archer Martin&#x27;s 1954 paper with A. T. James, &quot;Gas-Liquid Chromatography: A Technique for the Analysis and Identification of Volatile Materials” reported the discovery of gas-liquid chromatography. This publication was honoured by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented in 2016 to the Francis Crick Institute.

The research was actually performed at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, which became the Francis Crick Institute in 2015.

Martin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1950, and made a CBE in 1960.

==Personal life==
In 1943 he married Judith Bagenal (1918–2006), and together they had two sons and three daughters. In the last years of his life he suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="1224123" wikidata="Q6775351" url="?curid=1224123" title="Martin Dunbar-Nasmith">
<text>Admiral Sir Martin Eric Dunbar-Nasmith, (1 April 1883 – 29 June 1965) was a Royal Navy officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was born Martin Eric Nasmith, adding &quot;Dunbar&quot; to his surname in 1923.

==Early life and education==
Nasmith was born on 1 April 1883 at 136 Castelnau in Barnes, which was then in the county of Surrey and is now in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

==Early career==
Educated at Eastman&#x27;s Royal Naval Academy in Winchester and HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; at Dartmouth, Nasmith joined the Royal Navy in 1898.

On 8 May 1912, King George V was in HMY &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot; in Weymouth Bay to witness Fleet manoeuvres. Because of heavy fog, the programme was disrupted, and the King expressed the desire to dive in a submarine. He embarked on HM Submarine &quot;D4&quot;, under then Lieutenant Nasmith&#x27;s command, and (in the words of &quot;The Times&quot; of 10 May) &quot;made a lengthy run in her when she was submerged.&quot; What made the occasion all the more remarkable was the presence on board of his second son, Prince Albert, who was to become King George VI, of Winston Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty and future prime minister), and of then Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, who was to become the first Director of Combined Operations (the Commandos) in the early part of the Second World War. A former prime minister, Arthur Balfour, was also embarked, but the then prime minister, H. H. Asquith, who had been with the King&#x27;s party earlier in the day, had had to return to London on urgent business and did not dive in &quot;D4&quot;. Nasmith&#x27;s diary records that: &quot;We remained under water for ten to 15 minutes, during which time he showed great interest in the proceedings, periscope in particular.&quot; A &quot;Navy News&quot; article from July 2012 by Commander William Corbett (at whose parents&#x27; wedding Nasmith had proposed the toast to the health of the bride and groom), records that Nasmith often wondered what would have happened to the course of 20th century history had he sunk that day, a not unreasonable thought, given that he had very nearly sunk in the Solent in 1905 whilst in command of HM Submarine &quot;A4&quot;.

==First World War==
Dunbar-Nasmith was 32 years old, and a lieutenant commander during the First World War, when the following actions took place for which he was awarded the VC.

Nasmith conducted combat operations in the Sea of Marmara for a three-month period. When his torpedoes ran low, he set them to float at the end of their run, so that he could recover them should they fail to hit a target. At one point, he captured a sailing dhow, and lashed it to the conning tower of &quot;E11&quot; as camouflage, and went on to capture an ammunition ship using small arms. His penetration of the Golden Horn was the first time an enemy ship had done so in over 500 years. He also attacked a railway viaduct.

Nasmith&#x27;s first lieutenant, Guy D&#x27;Oyly-Hughes, and second lieutenant, Robert Brown, were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, and all the rest of the crew were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Nasmith was promoted to commander immediately and to captain a year later.

==Later naval career==
Later in the war, Nasmith was in charge of the Seventh Submarine Flotilla in the Baltic and Senior Naval Officer at Reval (later Tallinn), and was appointed CB in 1920 for that service. He was captain of from 1921 to 1923.

He was appointed Commandant of the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in 1926 and then became Rear Admiral Submarines in 1929. He became Commander-in-Chief, East Indies in 1932 and Second Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Personnel in 1935. He was Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth from 1938 and then Commander-in-Chief of Plymouth and Western Approaches Command from the outbreak of war in September 1939. He served as Flag Officer-in-Charge, London from 1942 and retired in 1946. Before retiring in 1946 Nasmith moved to Rothes living out the remainder of his days in the town.

In retirement he became Vice Chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission. He was also appointed Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom, a ceremonial position.

He died in Rothes in 1965, aged 83.

==Family==
In 1920 he married Beatrix Justina Dunbar-Dunbar-Rivers; they had two sons (Rear-Admiral David Dunbar-Nasmith and the architect Professor Sir James Dunbar-Nasmith) and a daughter.

==Legacy==
On 11 April 2015, a blue plaque was unveiled at his birthplace in Barnes.

On 25 June 2015, the Rothes community hosted a ceremony for the unveiling of a commemorative Victoria Cross paving stone at Rothes&#x27;s war memorial.

<text>Akim Mikhailovich Tamiroff (born Hovakim Tamiryants; October 29, 1899 – September 17, 1972) was an Armenian-American actor of film, stage, and television. One of the premier character actors of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age, Tamiroff developed a prolific career despite his thick accent, appearing in at least 80 motion pictures over a span of 37 years.

He was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances in &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot; (1936) and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), winning the first ever Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the latter. Orson Welles, a friend and oft-collaborator, praised him as &quot;the greatest of all screen actors.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Tamiroff was born Hovakim Tamiryants () to Armenian parents living in the Russian Empire. Different sources cite either Tiflis (in modern-day Georgia) or Baku (in modern-day Azerbaijan) as his places of birth. His father was an oil worker, and his mother a seamstress. He trained at the Moscow Art Theatre drama school for nine years from the age of 19, where he was a pupil of Konstantin Stanislavski. During that time, he changed his name to the russified moniker Akim Mikhailovich Tamiroff ().

==Stage acting==
During his time at the Moscow Art Theatre, he became acquainted with fellow Armenian Nikita Balieff. Following the Russian Revolution, Tamiroff and several other émigrés joined Balieff in Paris to form the La Chauve-Souris touring revue.

He arrived in the U.S. for the first time in January 1923 on a three-month tour with the revue and starred in a repertory of Russian plays directed by Stanislavski. He returned in November and stayed until 1924. His final trip with them was in October 1927 when he decided to stay permanently. He joined the Theatre Guild in New York City, where he met his wife Tamara Shayne. Both were later naturalized as United States citizens.
== Film and television career ==
Tamiroff&#x27;s film debut came in 1932 in an uncredited role in &quot;Okay, America!&quot;. He performed in several more uncredited roles until 1935, when he appeared in &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot;. He also appeared in the lavish epic &quot;China Seas&quot; in 1935 with Clark Gable, Wallace Beery, Jean Harlow, Rosalind Russell and Robert Benchley. The following year, he was cast in the titular role in &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot;. He appeared in the 1937 musical &quot;High, Wide, and Handsome&quot; with Irene Dunne and Randolph Scott, and the 1938 proto-noir &quot;Dangerous to Know&quot; opposite Anna May Wong, frequently singled out as his best role.

In the following decade, he appeared in such films as &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1938) with Fredric March, &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; (1940), &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; (1941), &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; (1942) with Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr and John Garfield, &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot; (1943) with Erich von Stroheim as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, Frank Borzage&#x27;s &quot;His Butler&#x27;s Sister&quot; (1943), &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943) with Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman, for which he received another Oscar nomination, and Preston Sturges&#x27; &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1944). Though ethnically Armenian, his many character roles included such ethnicities as Russian, Mexican, Chinese, Italian, French, German, Greek, Egyptian, Polish, Turkish, Malayan, Tartar, Romani, and Jewish.

In later years, Tamiroff appeared in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960) with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin&#x27;s Rat Pack, &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964) with Peter Ustinov and Melina Mercouri, &quot;Lord Jim&quot; with Peter O’Toole and &quot;Alphaville&quot; (1965), &quot;Marquis de Sade: Justine&quot; (1969) by Jesús Franco. He also had a long collaboration with Orson Welles including &quot;Mr Arkadin&quot; (1955), &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958) with Charlton Heston, &quot;The Trial&quot; (1962), and as Sancho Panza in Welles&#x27;s unfinished version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

== Awards ==
In 1944, Tamiroff was the first Golden Globe Award winner for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.

He was twice nominated for Academy Awards, both times for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The first was for his work in &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot;, and the second was for his work in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. Both these films starred Gary Cooper.

For his contributions to the American film industry, Tamiroff received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for motion pictures at 1634 Vine Street.

==Personal life==
Tamiroff&#x27;s accepted birth year was 1899, although in at least two instances this appeared to be different. In his second trip to America in November 1923 his age is given as 27 and in the 1930 census as 32. He married fellow actress Tamara Shayne, with whom he performed nightclub acts, in February 1933 in Los Angeles. Yet, according to the above-mentioned 1930 census, the couple was living in Chicago, Illinois, as married under the (misspelled) name Tameriroff. It appears also that this was his second marriage.

Tamiroff was fluent in five languages – Armenian, Russian, English, French, and Italian.

==Death==
Tamiroff died on September 17, 1972, from cancer.

==Legacy==
While Tamiroff may not be a household name now, his malapropistic performance as the boss in &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; is thought to have been the inspiration for the cartoon character Boris Badenov, the male half of the villainous husband-and-wife team Boris and Natasha on &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;. He was also spoofed in a 1969 episode of the TV show &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; entitled &quot;The Stand-in&quot; in which a frog named &quot;Akim Toadanoff&quot; directs a movie on Living Island. He is mentioned in J.D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut&quot; (&quot;New Yorker&quot;, 1942), and Walker Percy&#x27;s 1961 novel &quot;The Moviegoer&quot;.

<doc id="1224131" wikidata="Q6148579" url="?curid=1224131" title="Hull–White model">
<text>In financial mathematics, the Hull–White model is a model of future interest rates. In its most generic formulation, it belongs to the class of no-arbitrage models that are able to fit today&#x27;s term structure of interest rates. It is relatively straightforward to translate the mathematical description of the evolution of future interest rates onto a tree or lattice and so interest rate derivatives such as bermudan swaptions can be valued in the model.

The first Hull–White model was described by John C. Hull and Alan White in 1990. The model is still popular in the market today.

==The model==

===One-factor model===
The model is a short-rate model. In general, it has the following dynamics:

:formula_1

There is a degree of ambiguity among practitioners about exactly which parameters in the model are time-dependent or what name to apply to the model in each case. The most commonly accepted naming convention is the following:

*formula_2 has &quot;t&quot; (time) dependence — the Hull–White model.
*formula_2 and formula_4 are both time-dependent — the extended Vasicek model.

===Two-factor model===
The two-factor Hull–White model contains an additional disturbance term whose mean reverts to zero, and is of the form:

:formula_5

where formula_6 is a deterministic function, typically the identity function (extension of the one-factor version, analytically tractable, and with potentially negative rates), the natural logarithm (extension of Black–Karasinski, not analytically tractable, and with positive interest rates), or combinations (proportional to the natural logarithm on small rates and proportional to the identity function on large rates); and formula_7 has an initial value of 0 and follows the process:

:formula_8

==Analysis of the one-factor model==
For the rest of this article we assume only formula_9 has &quot;t&quot;-dependence.
Neglecting the stochastic term for a moment, notice that for formula_10 the change in &quot;r&quot; is negative if &quot;r&quot; is currently &quot;large&quot; (greater than formula_11 and positive if the current value is small. That is, the stochastic process is a mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process.

θ is calculated from the initial yield curve describing the current term structure of interest rates. Typically α is left as a user input (for example it may be estimated from historical data). σ is determined via calibration to a set of caplets and swaptions readily tradeable in the market.

When formula_4, formula_2, and formula_14 are constant, Itô&#x27;s lemma can be used to prove that

:formula_15

which has distribution
:formula_16

where formula_17 is the normal distribution with mean formula_18 and variance formula_19.

When formula_20 is time-dependent,
:formula_21

which has distribution
:formula_22

==Bond pricing using the Hull–White model==

It turns out that the time-&quot;S&quot; value of the &quot;T&quot;-maturity discount bond has distribution (note the &quot;affine term&quot; structure here!)

:formula_23

where

:formula_24
:formula_25

Note that their terminal distribution for formula_26 is distributed log-normally.

==Derivative pricing==

By selecting as numeraire the time-&quot;S&quot; bond (which corresponds to switching to the &quot;S&quot;-forward measure), we have from the fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing, the value at time &quot;t&quot; of a derivative which has payoff at time &quot;S&quot;.

:formula_27

Here, formula_28 is the expectation taken with respect to the forward measure. Moreover, standard arbitrage arguments show
that the time &quot;T&quot; forward price formula_29 for a payoff at time &quot;T&quot; given by &quot;V(T)&quot; must satisfy formula_30, thus
:formula_31

Thus it is possible to value many derivatives &quot;V&quot; dependent solely on a single bond formula_26 analytically when working in the Hull–White model. For example, in the case of a bond put
:formula_33

Because formula_26 is lognormally distributed, the general calculation used for the Black–Scholes model shows that

:formula_35

where

:formula_36

and

:formula_37

Thus today&#x27;s value (with the &quot;P&quot;(0,&quot;S&quot;) multiplied back in and &quot;t&quot; set to 0) is:

:formula_38

Here formula_39 is the standard deviation (relative volatility) of the log-normal distribution for formula_26. A fairly substantial amount of algebra shows that it is related to the original parameters via

:formula_41

Note that this expectation was done in the &quot;S&quot;-bond measure, whereas we did not specify a measure at all for the original Hull–White process. This does not matter — the volatility is all that matters and is measure-independent.

Because interest rate caps/floors are equivalent to bond puts and calls respectively, the above analysis shows that caps and floors can be priced analytically in the Hull–White model. Jamshidian&#x27;s trick applies to Hull–White (as today&#x27;s value of a swaption in the Hull–White model is a monotonic function of today&#x27;s short rate). Thus knowing how to price caps is also sufficient for pricing swaptions. In the event that the underlying is a compounded backward-looking rate rather than a (forward-looking) LIBOR term rate, Turfus (2020) shows how this formula can be straightforwardly modified to take into account the additional convexity.

Swaptions can also be priced directly as described in Henrard (2003). Direct implementations are usually more efficient.

==Monte-Carlo simulation, trees and lattices==
However, valuing vanilla instruments such as caps and swaptions is useful primarily for calibration. The real use of the model is to value somewhat more exotic derivatives such as bermudan swaptions on a lattice, or other derivatives in a multi-currency context such as Quanto Constant Maturity Swaps, as explained for example in Brigo and Mercurio (2001). The efficient and exact Monte-Carlo simulation of the Hull–White model with time dependent parameters can be easily performed, see Ostrovski (2013) and (2016). An open-source implementation of the exact Monte-Carlo simulation following Fries (2016) can be found in finmath lib.

==Forecasting==
Even though single factor models such as Vasicek, CIR and Hull–White model has been devised for pricing, recent research has shown their potential with regard to forecasting. In Orlando et al. (2018, 2019,) was provided a new methodology to forecast future interest rates called CIR#.
The ideas, apart from turning a short-rate model used for pricing into a forecasting tool, lies in an appropriate partitioning of the dataset into subgroups according to a given distribution ).
In there it was shown how the said partitioning enables capturing statistically significant time changes in volatility of interest rates. following the said approach, Orlando et al. (2021) ) compares the Hull–White model with the CIR model in terms of forecasting and prediction of interest rate directionality.

<text>The E and F-class destroyers were a group of 18 destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. The ships were initially assigned to the Home Fleet, although they reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia of 1935–36 and enforced the Non-Intervention Agreement during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. After the beginning of the Second World War in August 1939, the E-class ships were mostly assigned to escort duties under the Western Approaches Command, while the Fs were assigned to escort the ships of the Home Fleet. Between them they sank four German submarines through March 1940 while losing only one ship to a submarine.

Most of the sisters were committed to the Norwegian Campaign in April–June where they helped to sink one German destroyer and a submarine. The two E-class minelayer-destroyers helped to evacuate Allied troops from Dunkirk in May–June. Most of the Fs were sent to Gibraltar around the end of June and formed part of Force H where they participated in the attack on Mers-el-Kébir. Two months later they participated in the Battle of Dakar where they sank three Vichy French submarines. During the rest of 1940, they sank one Italian submarine while losing two ships to mines and torpedoes. Force H covered a number of convoys to Malta in 1941, during which they sank one German submarine and lost one destroyer to bombs. Three E-class ships began escorting convoys to Russia in late 1941 and three others were transferred to the Eastern Fleet.

Two of these latter were sunk by Japanese forces in early 1942 and two Fs were transferred to replace them. Many of the Fs reinforced the Arctic convoy escorts during which they fought several engagements with German destroyers and sank one German submarine. Several were detached to escort Malta convoys, during which one ship was lost. Several ships were converted to escort destroyers in late 1942–early 1943 for duty in the North Atlantic and many others were assigned there for extended periods of time where they sank two German submarines. Three of these ships were later transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy. Four of the Es and Fs were sent to the Mediterranean Fleet in mid-1943 to support the invasion of Sicily and remained there into 1944. One of these was transferred to the Royal Hellenic Navy that same year and remained in Greek service until 1956. The ships that remained in the Atlantic sank two German submarines in 1944 before they were recalled to the UK in May to prepare for the invasion of Normandy. There they sank two submarines, although another F-class ship was lost to a mine. The ships mostly returned to the North Atlantic after Overlord or began long refits in Canada.

The three Canadian ships were used to transport troops back to Canada after the end of the war before being broken up in 1947. Most of the British ships were broken up around the same time, although one ship was sold to the Dominican Navy in 1949 and served until 1968.

==Design and description==

The E class were ordered as part of the 1931 Naval Construction Programme, the F class following in 1932. These ships were based on the preceding D class with minor changes to the hull and armament. Two of the ships were modified to accommodate 60 mines. The F class were repeats of the E&#x27;s with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.

The E- and F-class destroyers displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The ships&#x27; complement was 145 officers and ratings. They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers that operated at a pressure of and a temperature of . The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The destroyers carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at .
All of the ships had the same main armament, four quick-firing (QF) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The guns had a maximum elevation of 40° which was achieved by using a lowered section of the deck around the mount, the &quot;well&quot;, that allowed the breech of the gun to be lowered below deck height. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a range of . For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mk III machine gun on platforms between the funnels. The E- and F-class ships were fitted with two quadruple mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The ships, except for the minelayers, were also equipped with two throwers and one rack for 20 depth charges. The stern of the minelayers was fitted with a pair of sponsons that housed part of the mechanical chain-conveyor system and to ensure smooth delivery of her mines. To compensate for the weight of her Mark XIV mines, their rails, two 4.7-inch guns, their ammunition, both sets of torpedo tubes, their whalers and their davits had to be removed.

The main guns were controlled by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data derived from the manually-operated director-control tower and the separate rangefinder situated above the bridge. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye.

===Wartime modifications===
Beginning in May 1940, the after bank of torpedo tubes was removed and replaced with a QF 12-pounder 20-cwt anti-aircraft gun, the after mast and funnel being cut down to improve the gun&#x27;s field of fire. Four to eight QF 20 mm Oerlikon cannons were added to the surviving ships, usually replacing the .50-calibre machine gun mounts between the funnels. One pair of these was added to the bridge wings and the other pair was mounted the searchlight platform. Early in the war, depth charge stowage increased to 38. By 1943, all the surviving ships, except had the &#x27;Y&#x27; gun on the quarterdeck removed to allow for additional depth charge stowage and two additional depth charge throwers. The 12-pounder was removed to allow for the installation of a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast and for more depth charges. All of the survivors, except perhaps for , had &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;B&#x27; gun replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, and their director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge removed in exchange for a Type 271 target-indication radar, had her &#x27;A&#x27; gun reinstalled by 1944. A Type 286 short-range, surface-search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force&#x27;s ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. &#x27;s modifications differed somewhat in that &#x27;B&#x27; gun was replaced by a twin-gun QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss mount and a split Hedgehog installation. In addition, she retained her 12-pounder gun, but her remaining torpedo tubes were removed.

===Flotilla leaders===
For the first time since the A class of the 1927 programme, the flotilla leaders were built to an enlarged design, being lengthened to incorporate an additional QF 4.7-inch gun between the funnels. The lengthened design resulted in a three boiler room layout to enhance water-tight integrity. The leaders were not fitted for minesweeping or minelaying. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The ships carried a total of 175 personnel which included the staff of the Captain (D), commanding officer of the flotilla. Their turbines were more powerful than the private ships, which made them faster; their propulsion machinery was otherwise identical. was an early wartime loss and consequently received no modifications, but survived the war. Her modifications differed somewhat from those of the private ships. She received a AA gun in lieu of her aft torpedo tubes, although they were later reinstalled and the 4-inch gun replaced &#x27;X&#x27; 4.7-inch gun. Two Oerlikons were later added on the forward part of her aft superstructure and a quadruple QF two-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount replaced &#x27;Q&#x27; gun between the funnels. Finally her rangefinder was replaced by a high-angle director fitted with a Type 285 gunnery radar.

===F class===
==Service==

All of the E class were assigned to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet upon commissioning during 1934. Following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the entire flotilla was sent to the Red Sea in August 1935 to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936. Refitted upon their return, many were deployed to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39 to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British-flagged ships. While the F-class ships were assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, they followed much the same pattern as their E-class sisters. In April 1939 the 5th and 6th DFs were renumbered the 7th and 8th Destroyer Flotillas, respectively. In mid-1939, newly commissioned J-class destroyers began to replace the E-class ships and they were reduced to reserve for lack of manpower. Increasing tensions with Nazi Germany in August, caused the British to mobilize the Navy&#x27;s reserves, which allowed the ships to be manned again and assigned to the 12th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet.

When the war began on 3 September, the E-class ships, except for the two minelayers, &quot;Esk&quot; and &quot;Express&quot;, were assigned to the Western Approaches Command (WAC) for convoy escort and patrolling duties, while the Fs remained with the Home Fleet, performing the same sorts of tasks. On 14 September, &quot;Faulknor&quot;, &quot;Firedrake&quot;, and &quot;Foxhound&quot;, escorting the aircraft carrier , sank , the first German submarine to be lost during the war, after she had unsuccessfully attacked the carrier. Six days later, &quot;Fearless&quot;, &quot;Faulknor&quot;, &quot;Forester&quot;, and &quot;Fortune&quot; sank . Most of the E class remained with the WAC until April 1940, but several were transferred to Rosyth Command at the end of 1939. &quot;Exmouth&quot; was one of these and was sunk by on 21 January 1940 in the Moray Firth. On the other hand, &quot;Escapade&quot; forced to the surface on 25 February, which was then scuttled by her crew, and &quot;Fortune&quot; sank on 20 March. &quot;Esk&quot; and &quot;Express&quot; were assigned to the specialist 20th Destroyer Flotilla shortly after the war began, together with the four -minelayers, and were busy laying mines in the North Sea and off the English coast through April–May 1940.

The beginning of the Norwegian Campaign in April saw almost all of the E and F class transferred to the Home Fleet for operations in Norwegian waters. For the most part they escorted the ships of the Home Fleet and the various convoys to and from Norway, but &quot;Forester&quot; and &quot;Foxhound&quot; were part of the escort for the battleship during the Second Battle of Narvik on 13 April and the latter helped to sink one German destroyer. While escorting one convoy, &quot;Fearless&quot; and the destroyer sank two days later. &quot;Esk&quot; and &quot;Express&quot; were the only two ships committed to the evacuation of Dunkirk in May–June, each rescuing thousands of Allied troops.
&quot;Fearless&quot;, &quot;Escapade&quot;, &quot;Faulknor&quot;, and &quot;Foxhound&quot; of the 8th DF escorted &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and the battlecruiser to Gibraltar in late June, where they formed Force H. Eight days later, they participated in the attack on Mers-el-Kébir against the Vichy French ships stationed there, together with &quot;Forester&quot;, &quot;Foresight&quot; and &quot;Escort&quot;. The latter ship was sunk by an Italian submarine on 11 July while covering a Malta convoy. Most of Force H returned to the UK for a brief refit in early August, but upon their return at the end of the month, the 8th DF now consisted of &quot;Faulknor&quot;, &quot;Forester&quot;, &quot;Foresight&quot;, &quot;Firedrake&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Fury&quot;, and . On the night of 31 August/1 September, &quot;Esk&quot;, &quot;Express&quot; and three other minelaying destroyers laid a minefield off the Dutch island of Texel. While doing so, the latter ship struck a mine that blew her bow off. While closing to render aid, &quot;Esk&quot; struck two mines that broke her in half with heavy casualties. &quot;Express&quot; was towed back to England for repairs that lasted until October 1941. On 13 September, Force H met a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French that was escorted by , &quot;Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Encounter&quot;, and &quot;Escapade&quot;. Ten days later they attacked Dakar where &quot;Foresight&quot; and &quot;Inglefield&quot; sank the , &quot;Fortune&quot; sank the submarine a day later and &quot;Foresight&quot; sank the submarine on the 25th. After the battle, &quot;Escapade&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; returned to the Home Fleet and resumed their regular duties of fleet escort. On 17 October, &quot;Fame&quot; ran aground and could not be refloated for several months. The following day, &quot;Firedrake&quot; together with the destroyer and two Royal Air Force flying boats sank the . &quot;Fury&quot;, &quot;Encounter&quot;, &quot;Faulknor&quot;, &quot;Firedrake&quot;, and &quot;Forester&quot; participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November.

In 1941, the 8th DF escorted Force H as it covered multiple convoys and aircraft carriers flying off aircraft to Malta. While returning from one of the latter missions, &quot;Forester&quot;, &quot;Foresight&quot;, &quot;Faulknor&quot;, &quot;Fearless&quot; and &quot;Foxhound&quot; sank on 18 June. A month later, &quot;Fearless&quot; was crippled by Italian bombs on 23 July while escorting a convoy to Malta and had to be scuttled by her sister &quot;Foresight&quot; while &quot;Firedrake&quot; was badly damaged by near misses and had to return to Gibraltar for repairs. The ships of the 8th DF mostly returned home between August and October for repairs and refits. &quot;Encounter&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in April and spent several months under repair as she was badly damaged by bombs at Malta. The ship was then transferred to the Eastern Fleet in November and arrived at Singapore the following month. &quot;Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, and &quot;Electra&quot; were assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet at the beginning of 1941 where they escorted the larger ships of the fleet while they were searching for German commerce raiders and on other missions. &quot;Escapade&quot; began escorting convoys to Russia in August and continued to do so for most of the following year. &quot;Electra&quot; did the same for several months until she was detailed to escort the battleship and the battlecruiser to Singapore in October, together with &quot;Express&quot;.

&quot;Express&quot; and &quot;Electra&quot; were half of the escorts for &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; as they sailed north on 9 December, but could do little as the Japanese bombers sank the two capital ships other than help to rescue the 3,000-odd survivors. Upon their return to Singapore, they joined &quot;Encounter&quot; and the other destroyers there escorting ships between Singapore and the Sunda Strait. &quot;Electra&quot; and &quot;Encounter&quot; escorted the heavy cruiser during the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February 1942. The former ship was sunk by a Japanese destroyer as she covered &quot;Exeter&quot;″s withdrawal. Several days later, &quot;Encounter&quot; and the American destroyer were escorting the damaged &quot;Exeter&quot; en route to Ceylon when they encountered four Japanese heavy cruisers and their escorts. &quot;Encounter&quot; and &quot;Exeter&quot; were sunk in the subsequent battle on 1 March. &quot;Express&quot; did not participate in any of these battles because she&#x27;d been damaged by a boiler room fire in early February and her repairs did not begin until April. &quot;Fortune&quot; joined her sister with the Eastern Fleet in February, with &quot;Foxhound&quot; following two months later.
On 27 March, &quot;Fury&quot;, &quot;Eclipse&quot; and the light cruiser were escorting Convoy PQ 13 in the Arctic when they were intercepted by three German destroyers. In the ensuing action, the cruiser was damaged by one of her own torpedoes and &quot;Eclipse&quot; was hit twice, although the cruiser sank the . &quot;Foresight&quot;, &quot;Forester&quot; and the light cruiser were the close escort for Convoy QP 11, returning from Murmansk to Iceland, when &quot;Edinburgh&quot; was torpedoed on 29 April. The two hits disabled her steering and she had to be towed by the two destroyers. Two days later, they were attacked by three German destroyers which badly damaged &quot;Foresight&quot; and &quot;Forester&quot; and put another torpedo into &quot;Edinburgh&quot;, crippling her. The two destroyers took off the survivors and scuttled the cruiser. Temporarily repaired at Murmansk, the sisters were part of &quot;Trinidad&quot;″s escort home when she was set on fire by a German bomber and had to be scuttled on 15 May. &quot;Faulknor&quot;, &quot;Fury&quot;, &quot;Escapade&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, and &quot;Eclipse&quot; escorted more Arctic convoys in May–September, &quot;Faulknor&quot; sinking on 12 September while escorting Convoy PQ 18. &quot;Foresight&quot; and &quot;Fury&quot; were briefly detached to escort the fleet during Operation Pedestal in August, during which the former was torpedoed and had to be scuttled. While being repaired, &quot;Fame&quot; was converted into an escort destroyer and was assigned to the WAC, joining her sister, &quot;Fearless&quot;, upon its completion in September. A month later, she sank while protecting Convoy SC 104. &quot;Fearless&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by on 16 December.
When convoys to Russia resumed in December 1942, &quot;Fury&quot;, &quot;Forester&quot;, &quot;Faulknor&quot;, &quot;Eclipse&quot;, and &quot;Echo&quot; were assigned as escorts. &quot;Fury&quot;, and &quot;Eclipse&quot; were detached to augment the escorts of the WAC in March–May 1943, joining their sisters, &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Escapade&quot;, when German submarine attacks reached their peak. The former had already sunk on 17 February while escorting Convoy ONS 165. &quot;Express&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Foxhound&quot; was assigned to the Eastern Fleet at the beginning of 1943, but the first two returned to Britain in February to begin refits, during which they were transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy and renamed &quot;Gatineau&quot; and &quot;Saskatchewan&quot; in June and May, respectively. &quot;Foxhound&quot; followed in August and was converted into an escort destroyer before being given to the Canadians in February 1944 and renamed &quot;Qu&#x27;Appelle&quot;. &quot;Forester&quot; was assigned to Escort Group C1 of the WAC in June. &quot;Escapade&quot; was badly damaged by a premature detonation of her Hedgehog projectiles in September and was under repair until the end of 1944. &quot;Faulknor&quot;, &quot;Fury&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, and &quot;Eclipse&quot; were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet to escort the covering force during the invasion of Sicily in July and the subsequent landings in mainland Italy. &quot;Faulknor&quot;, &quot;Fury&quot;, and &quot;Eclipse&quot; participated in the Dodecanese Campaign after the surrender of Italy in September and the latter ship sank after hitting a mine on 24 October.

&quot;Echo&quot; began a long refit at Malta in December and was loaned to the Royal Hellenic Navy upon its completion in April 1944. Renamed &quot;Navarinon&quot;, she supported government forces during the Greek Civil War and was retained after the end of the war. &quot;Faulknor&quot; and &quot;Fury&quot; later supported operations in Italy before returning to the UK for Operation Overlord in June. While escorting Convoy HX 280, &quot;Gatineau&quot; helped to sink on 6 March, four days later &quot;Forester&quot; participated in the sinking of . &quot;Fame&quot;, &quot;Forester&quot;, &quot;Gatineau&quot;, &quot;Saskatchewan&quot;, and &quot;Qu&#x27;Appelle&quot; joined their sisters covering the preparations for the invasion of Normandy and the invasion itself. &quot;Fame&quot; and two others destroyers sank on 18 June. &quot;Fury&quot; struck a mine on 21 June and was forced to beach herself to prevent her from sinking. She was written off after she was salvaged and was broken up for scrap beginning in September. &quot;Saskatchewan&quot; and &quot;Gatineau&quot; returned to Canada in August for lengthy refits that lasted into 1945 after which they returned to the UK. &quot;Qu&#x27;Appelle&quot; returned to the North Atlantic in October and &quot;Forester&quot; helped to sink on 20 August and then was sent back to the North Atlantic. &quot;Escapade&quot; was fitted with the new Squid anti-submarine mortar when her repairs were finished.

===Postwar===
&quot;Gatineau&quot;, &quot;Saskatchewan&quot;, and &quot;Qu&#x27;Appelle&quot; were used to ferry Canadian troops back home before they were placed in reserve in 1946 and subsequently sold for scrap, although &quot;Gatineau&quot; was scuttled in 1948 in British Columbia to serve as a breakwater. &quot;Faulknor&quot; and &quot;Forester&quot; were reduced to reserve in 1945 and broken up the following year; &quot;Escapade&quot; lasted on active duty a year longer as she served in the Anti-Submarine Training Flotilla until 1946, but the ship was scrapped the next year. Unlike most of her sisters, &quot;Fame&quot; remained on active duty until 1947 when she was placed in reserve. She was sold to the Dominican Republic in 1949 and renamed &quot;Generalissimo&quot;. The ship was renamed &quot;Sanchez&quot; in 1962 and finally discarded in 1968. &quot;Navarinon&quot; later became a training ship before she was returned to the Royal Navy in 1956 and broken up the following year.

<text>Richard Murphy OBE (born 24 April 1955) is a British architect and businessman. He is the founder and principal architect of &quot;Richard Murphy Architects&quot;, an architectural firm operating in Edinburgh. He is a winner of the 2016 RIBA House of the year.

==Works==
Murphy studied at Newcastle University and University of Edinburgh. In 1991, he established Richard Murphy Architects in Edinburgh, which expanded to employ over twenty architects. Initially focused on residential extensions and mews conversions, the firm later branched into education, healthcare, arts, and commercial projects, with some buildings funded by the National Lottery.

In 1995, Murphy designed the inaugural Maggie&#x27;s Centre in Edinburgh, now the administrative headquarters for Maggie&#x27;s. The structure, intended to support cancer treatment, was uniquely designed without corridors to prevent an institutional feel.

In 1996, Murphy published a book on Venetian architect Carlo Scarpa and presented a Channel 4 documentary on him. He also co-authored a book on Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

In 2004, Murphy showcased his work at the Venice Biennale.

In January 2007, he was recognized with an OBE for his contributions to architecture.

Murphy has designed homes for his personal use, with his 2015 Hart Street residence winning the Saltire Society Award for Best Single Dwelling New Build.

== Teaching ==
Murphy has taught at University of Edinburgh, The Scott Sutherland School of Architecture, University of Strathclyde, and abroad at Technical University of Braunschweig, University of Virginia, and Syracuse University, New York.

<text>Lance Corporal Harold Sandford Mugford VC (31 August 1894 – 16 June 1958) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 22 years old, and a Lance-Corporal in the 8th Cavalry Machine Gun Squadron MGC, 8th Cavalry Brigade, 3rd Cavalry Division, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 11 April 1917 at Monchy-le-Preux, France, under intense fire, Lance-Corporal Mugford got his machine-gun into a forward, very exposed position from which he dealt very effectively with the enemy. Almost immediately his No. 2 was killed and he was severely wounded. He was ordered to go to a new position and then have his wounds dressed but this he refused to do, staying to inflict severe damage on the enemy with his gun. Soon afterwards a shell broke both his legs, but he still remained with his gun and when he was at last removed to the dressing station he was again wounded.

His VC is displayed at the Imperial War Museum &quot;(London, England)&quot; and there is a memorial to him in Chelmsford Cathedral.

<text>The Districts of Ghana are second-level administrative subdivisions of Ghana, below the level of region. There are currently 261 local metropolitan, municipal and district assemblies (or MMDA&#x27;s).

== History ==
The districts of Ghana were re-organized in 1988/1989 in an attempt to decentralize the government and to assist in development. The reform of the late 1980s subdivided the regions of Ghana into 110 districts, where local district assemblies should deal with the local administration. By 2006, an additional 28 districts were created by splitting some of the original 110, bringing their number up to 138. In February 2008, there were more districts created and some were upgraded to municipal status. This brought the final number to 170 districts in Ghana. Since then, a further 46 districts have been added since 28 June 2012 bringing the total to 216 districts.

==Types of Districts==
Districts are classified into three types: 
Ordinary Districts with a minimum population of seventy-five thousand (75,000) people,
Municipal Districts with a minimum population of ninety-five thousand (95,000) people, and Metropolitan Districts with a minimum population of two hundred and fifty thousand(250,000) people.

==Governance and administration==
===District Assemblies===
Districts are governed by District Assemblies, which are established by the Minister of Local Government, and serve as the highest political authority in each district. They consist of:
* the District Chief Executive, appointed by the President of the Republic
* one person from each electoral area within the district elected by universal adult suffrage 
* the member or members of Parliament from the constituencies that fall within the area of authority of the District Assembly
* other members that shall not exceed thirty per cent of the total membership of the District Assembly appointed by the President in consultation with the traditional authorities and other interest groups in the district

====District Chief Executive====
The District Chief Executive is appointed by the President of the Republic and serves as the representative of the Central Government in the district. The incumbent presides at meetings of the Executive Committee of the District Assembly, and is responsible for:
* the day-to-day performance of the executive and administrative functions of the District Assembly
* the supervision of the departments of the District Assembly

====Executive committee====
The Executive Committee exercises the executive and coordinating functions of the District Assembly, and has the following members:
* the District Chief Executive, who serves as chairperson
* the chairpersons of the following Sub-Committees of the Executive Committee:
** Development Planning,
** Social Services
** Works
** Justice and Security
** Finance and Administration
** the chairperson of one ad hoc Sub-Committee of the Executive Committee elected by the District Assembly
** any two other members elected by members of the District Assembly, at least one of whom is a woman

====Presiding Member====
Each District Assembly elects a Presiding Member from among their number, who convenes and presides at meetings of the District Assembly.

===Functions of District Assemblies===
As the political and administrative authorities over the districts, the primary function of District Assemblies is to promote local economic development.

The Local Government Act of 2016 also tasks District Assemblies to:
* formulate and execute plans, programs and strategies for the effective mobilization of the resources necessary for the overall development of the district
* promote and support productive activity and social development in the district and remove any obstacles to initiative and development
* sponsor the education of students from the district to fill particular manpower needs of the district especially in the social sectors of education and health, making sure that the sponsorship is fairly and equitably balanced between male and female students
* initiate programs for the development of basic infrastructure and provide municipal works and services in the district
* be responsible for the development, improvement and management of human settlements and the environment in the district
* in co-operation with the appropriate national and local security agencies, be responsible for the maintenance of security and public safety in the district
* ensure ready access to courts in the district for the promotion of justice
* act to preserve and promote the cultural heritage within the district
* initiate, sponsor or carry out studies that may be necessary for the discharge of any of their duties

The Act also grants the District Assemblies with the following authorities:
* Auction sales, as provided by the Auction Sales Act, 1989 (P.N.D.C.L. 230)
* Liquor licensing, as provided by the Liquor Licensing Act, 1970 (Act 331)
* Control bushfires, as provided by the Control and Prevention of Bushfires Act, 1990 (P.N.D.C.L. 229)*
* Execute the following provisions of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29) within its district: section 296 in respect of throwing rubbish in the street; and section 300 in respect of stray cattle

<doc id="1224162" wikidata="Q997841" url="?curid=1224162" title="Language delay">
<text>A language delay is a language disorder in which a child fails to develop language abilities at the usual age-appropriate period in their developmental timetable. It is most commonly seen in children ages two to seven years-old and can continue into adulthood. The reported prevalence of language delay ranges from 2.3 to 19 percent.

Language is a uniquely human form of communication that entails the use of words in a standard and structured way. Language is distinct from communication. Communication is a two-stage process. The first stage is the process of encoding the message into a set of words (or signs in the case of Sign Languages) and sentence structures that convey the required meaning, i.e. into language. In the second stage, language is translated into motor commands that control the articulators (hands, face, body, lungs, vocal cords, mouth, tongue, teeth, etc.), thereby creating speech.

Language delays are distinct from speech delays, in which the development of the mechanical and motor aspects of speech production are delayed. Many tend to confuse language delay with speech delay or even just late talker. All of these have different telltale signs and determining factors. Speech delay seems to be more similar to late talker compared to language delay. Speech is the verbal motor production of language, while language is a means of communication. Because language and speech are independent, they may be individually delayed. For example, a child may be delayed in speech (i.e., unable to produce intelligible speech sounds), but not delayed in language because they use a Sign Language. Additionally, language delay encompasses the entirety of language developmental progress being slowed and not just the speech aspects.

Language delays are recognized by comparing language development of children to recognized developmental milestones. They are presented in a variety of ways, as every individual child has a unique set of language skills and deficiencies that are identifiable through many different screenings and tools. There are different causes leading to language delay; it is often a result of another developmental disorder and treatment requires analysis of the unique individual causes. The condition is frequently observed early on, among two- and three-year-olds. Early language delays are only considered risk-factors in leading to more severe language disorders.

== Language development ==
The anatomical language centers of the brain are the Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s area. These two areas include all aspects of the development of language. The Broca&#x27;s area is the motor portion of language at the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus and involves speech production. The Wernicke&#x27;s area is the sensory portion of language at the posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus and involves auditory verbal comprehension.

There are recognizable speech and language developmental milestones in children. For children with language delays, milestones in their language development may be different or slowed. Recent studies have shown the different milestones for children with language delay compared to children with normal language development. Language delays are often identified when a child strays from the expected developments in the timeline of typical speech and language developmental milestones that researchers agree on. Children can stray slightly from the confines of the expected timeline; however, if a child is observed to be largely straying from the expected timeline, the child&#x27;s caretaker should consult with a medical specialist.

=== Timeline of typical speech and language developmental milestones ===
This timeline only provides a very general and brief outline of expected developments from birth to age five, individual children can still exhibit varying development patterns as this timeline only serves as a general guideline. This timeline is only one model, other models regarding language development exist. The development of language remains a theoretical mystery.

Around 2 months, babies can make &quot;cooing&quot; sounds.

Around 4 months, babies can respond to voices.

Around 6 months, babies begin to babble and respond to names.

Around 9 months, babies begin to produce mama/dada - appropriate terms and are able to imitate one word at a time.

Around 12 months, toddlers can typically speak one or more words. They can produce two words with meaning.

Around 15 months, toddlers begin to produce jargon, which is defined as &quot;pre-linguistic vocalizations in which infants use adult-like stress and intonation&quot;.

Around 18 months, toddlers can produce 10 words and follow simple commands.

Around 24 months, toddlers begin to produce 2-3 words and phrases that use &quot;I&quot;, &quot;Me&quot;, and &quot;you&quot;, indicating possession. They are about 25% intelligible.

Around 3 years, toddlers are able to use language in numerical terms.

Based on the milestones set for typical toddlers, if the child tends to have a lot of or very long delays, they may be deemed as having language delay. However, proper testing by a professional like a speech therapist or a doctor&#x27;s confirmation will be required to determine if a child has language delay. Although these milestones are the typical milestones for a child, they should not be followed strictly as they are mere guidelines.

=== Language development in language delay ===
Early developmental language delay is characterized by slow language development in preschoolers. Language development for children with language delay takes longer than the general timeline provided above. It is not only slower, but also presents itself in different forms. For example, a child with a language delay could have weaker language skills such as the ability to produce phrases at 24 months-old. They may find themselves producing language that is different from language norms in developing children.

==Types ==
A language delay is commonly divided into &quot;receptive&quot; and &quot;expressive&quot; categories. Both categories are essential in developing effective communication.

Receptive language refers to the process of understanding language, both verbal (spoken) and nonverbal (written, gestural). This may involve gaining information from sounds and words, visual information from surrounding environment, written information and grammar.

Expressive language refers to the use of sentences (made of words or signs) to communicate messages to others. It enables children to express their needs and wants to the people around them, interact with others and develop their language skills in speech and writing. Some expressive language skills include putting words together into sentences, being able to label objects in an environment and describing events and actions.

===Receptive language delay===
Children that are diagnosed with receptive language delay have difficulties understanding language. They may have trouble with receptive language skills such as identifying vocabulary and basic concepts, understanding gestures, following directions and answering questions. The number of language skills that children have difficulties with can differ greatly, with some having trouble with only a single skill and others having trouble with multiple.

===Expressive language delay===
A child diagnosed with expressive language delay (ELD) has trouble with language usage in some way. As this diagnosis is very broad, each child diagnosed with ELD can be very different in terms of the language skills they have problems with. Some may have difficulty with using the correct words and vocabulary, some have trouble forming sentences and others are unable to sequence information together coherently. Expressive language symptoms come in many forms and each one is treated with different methods.

==Presentation and diagnosis==
A language delay is most commonly identified around 18 months of age with an enhanced well-baby visit. It presents itself in many forms and can be comorbid or develop as a result of other developmental delays. Language delays act and develop differently individually. Language delay is different than individual variation in language development, and is defined by children falling behind on the timeline for recognized milestones.

=== Screening ===
Regular appointments with a pediatrician in infancy can help identify signs of language delay. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), formal screening for language delay is recommended at three ages: 9, 18, and 24–30 months. Screening is a two-part process: first, a general developmental screening using tools such as the Parents&#x27; Evaluation of Developmental Status or Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3); and second, specific screening for autism spectrum disorder using tools like the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers. Not all patients with language delay have autism spectrum disorder, so the AAP recommends both screens to assess for delays in developmental milestones.

However, the US Preventive Services Task Force (last updated in 2015) has determined that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for language delay in children under the age of 5. Other national panels, including the UK National Screening Committee and Canadian Task Force for Preventive Health Care, have also concluded that there is limited evidence on the benefits of screening all infants for language delay.

=== Early signs and symptoms (red flags) ===
There are several red flags in early infancy and childhood that may indicate a need for evaluation by a pediatrician. For example, language delay can present as a lack of communicative gestures or sounds. Language delay in children is associated with increased difficulty with reading, writing, attention, and/or socialization. In addition, an inability to engage in social exchanges is a sign of language delay at all ages.

Communicative deficits at specific ages and milestones might indicate language delay, including:

* Not smiling at 3 months
* Not turning the head toward sounds at 4 months
* Not laughing or responding to sounds at 6 months
* Not babbling at 9 months
* Not pointing and using gestures at 12 months
* Not producing more than 5 words at 18 months
* Not producing more than 50 words at 24 months
* Losing language and/or social skills after 36 months

Later in life, important signs include:

* A lack of speech
* An inability to comprehend, process, or understand language presented to the child

===Consequences of language delay===
Language delay is a risk factor for other types of developmental delay, including social, emotional, and cognitive delay. Language delay can impact behavior, reading and spelling ability, and overall IQ scores. Some children may outgrow deficits in reading and writing while others do not. Other conditions associated with language delay include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and social communication disorder.

==Causes==
Language delays are the most frequent developmental delays, and can occur for many reasons. A delay can be due to being a &quot;late bloomer&quot;, &quot;late talker&quot;, or a more serious problem. Such delays can occur in conjunction with a lack of mirroring of facial responses, unresponsiveness or unawareness of certain noises, a lack of interest in playing with other children or toys, or no pain response to stimuli.

===Socio-economic factors===
Socio-economic status

Children from families of low educational level are more likely to have delays and difficulties in expressive language. While language development is not directly affected by the socioeconomic level of a family, the conditions that are associated with the socioeconomic level affects the process of language development to a certain extent. A child&#x27;s early vocabulary development can be influenced by socioeconomic status via maternal speech, which varies according to the socioeconomic status of the family. Mothers with higher education levels are more likely to use rich vocabulary and speak in longer utterances when interacting with their children, which helps them develop their productive vocabulary more than children from a lower socioeconomic status.

Poverty is also a high risk factor for language delay as it results in a lack of access to appropriate therapies and services. The likelihood of those requiring early intervention for language delays actually receiving help is extremely low compared to those that don&#x27;t actually need it.

===Natural/medical factors===
Hearing loss

The process of children acquiring language skills involves hearing sounds and words from their caregivers and surroundings. Hearing loss causes that lack of these sound inputs, causing these children to have difficulties learning to use and understand language, which will eventually lead to delayed speech and language skills. For example, they may struggle with putting sentences together, understanding speech from other people or using the correct grammar, which are some language skills that typically developing children possess.

Autism

There is strong evidence that autism is commonly associated with language delay. Children with autism may have difficulties in developing language skills and understanding what is being said to them. They may also have troubles communicating non-verbally by using hand gestures, eye contact and facial expressions. The extent of their language usage is heavily influenced by their intellectual and social developments. The range of their skills can be very different and on opposite ends of a spectrum. Many children with autism develop some speech and language skills, but not like typically developing children, and with uneven progress.

Asperger syndrome, which is classified under the broad umbrella term of autistic spectrum disorder, however, is not associated with language delay. Children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome have decent language skills but use language in different ways from others. They may not be able to understand the use of language devices, such as irony and humor, or conversation reciprocity between involved parties.

Heritability

Genes have a very big influence in the presence of language impairments. Neurobiological and genetic mechanisms have a strong influence on late language emergence. A child with a family history of language impairments is more likely to have delayed language emergence and persistent language impairments. They are also 2 times more likely to be late talkers as compared to those with no such family history.

Genetic abnormalities may also be a cause of language delays. In 2005, researchers found a connection between expressive language delay and a genetic abnormality: a duplicate set of the same genes that are missing in individuals with Williams-Beuren syndrome. Also so called XYY syndrome can often cause speech delay.

Twins

Being a twin increases the chance of speech and language delays. Reasons for this are thought to include less one-on-one time with parents, the premature birth of twins, and the companionship of their twin sibling reducing their motivation to talk to others. A twin study has also shown that genetic factors have an important role in language delay. Monozygotic twin pairs (identical twins) recorded a higher consistency than dizygotic twin (fraternal twins) pairs, revealing monozygotic twins experiencing early vocabulary delay is attributed to genetic etiology. The environmental factors that influences both twins also play a big role in causing early language delay, but only when it is transient.

Gender

Research has shown that boys are at greater risk for delayed language development than girls. Almost all developmental disorders that affect communication, speech and language skills are more common in males than in females. British scientists have found that the male sex hormone (testosterone) levels were related to the development of both autism and language disorders, which explains why boys are at a greater risk of developmental disorders biologically.

Perinatal conditions

There is a high prevalence of early language delay among toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy. Hand usage and gestures are part of the motor system and have been proven correlate to comprehension and production aspects in language development. An interruption in the hand/arm usage caused by this condition during stages of language development could possibly cause these children to experience language delays.

Stress during pregnancy is associated with language delay. High levels of prenatal stress can result in poorer general intellectual and language outcomes. Chemical exposure during pregnancy may also be a factor that causes language delays.

===Environmental factors===
Interactive communication and parental inputs

Psychosocial deprivation can cause language delays in children. An example of this is when a child does not spend enough time communicating with adults through ways such as babbling and joint attention. Research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions with parents and other significant care givers for healthy brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional, and cognitive skills.

A study examining the role of interactive communication between parents and children has shown that parents&#x27; language towards toddlers with language delay differ from parents&#x27; language towards typically developing toddlers in terms of the quality of interaction. While late talkers and children with typical language development both receive similar quantitative parental input in terms of the number of utterances and words, parents of late talkers are found to respond less often to their children than parents of children with typical language development. Parents of late talkers tend to change or introduce topics more often than other parents in order to engage their children in more talk rather than responding to their child&#x27;s speech. They also seem to not provide an environment that is suitable for child engagement, nor do they establish routines that serve as a platform for communicative acts with their children. This, together with the fact that they respond less often to their children, shows that parents of late talkers do not follow their child&#x27;s lead. Instead, these parents are more likely to adapt to the child&#x27;s communication, which results in an &quot;idiosyncratic feedback cycle&quot; that worsens the child&#x27;s language difficulties rather than help with their language acquisition.

Birth Order

First-born children grow up in an environment that provides more possibilities of communicative interaction with adults, which differs from what is experienced by their younger siblings. Younger siblings are likely to have less one-on-one time with their parents or guardians. Older siblings also tend to talk for their younger siblings, giving them less opportunities to grow their language skills.

Television viewing

Excessive television viewing is associated with delayed language development. Children who watched television alone were 8.47 times more likely to have language delay when compared to children who interacted with their caregivers during television viewing. Some educational television shows, such as Blue&#x27;s Clues, have been found to enhance a child&#x27;s language development. But, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children under the age of 2 should watch no television at all, and after age 2 watch no more than one to two hours of quality programming a day. Therefore, exposing such young children to television programs should be discouraged, especially television shows with no educational value. Parents should engage children in more conversational activities to avoid television-related delays to their children language development, which could impair their intellectual performance. However, in a study conducted by Dr. Birken of the Hospital for Sick Children, it was found that watching television while interacting with a parent of caregiver is actually beneficial for children who are bilingual. The study spanned four years, from 2011 to 2015, and was based on parent report and clinician observation. Over the four years it was found that if a bilingual child had interaction with an adult while watching television they did not experience language delay and it in fact helped them develop English, their second language.

==Treatment==
Studies have failed to find clear evidence that a language delay can be prevented by training or educating health care professionals in the subject. Overall, some of the reviews show positive results regarding interventions in language delay, but are not curative. To treat an already existing language delay a child would need Speech and Language Therapy to correct any deficits. These therapists can be found in schools, clinics, through home care agencies, and also colleges where Communication Sciences and Disorders are studied. Most young children with language delay recover to a normal range by five years of age.

Aside from these, it is still encouraged for the child&#x27;s parent to get involved. A few ways that a parent could get involved with helping to improve a child&#x27;s language and speech skills includes speaking to their child with enthusiasm, engaging in conversations revolving what the child is focusing on, and reading to their child frequently.

Social and play skills appear to be more difficult for children with language delays due to their decreased experience in conversation. Speech pathologists utilize methods such as prompting to improve a child&#x27;s social skills through play intervention. While recent studies have consistently found play intervention to be helpful, further research is required in order to determine the effectiveness of this form of therapy.

Unfortunately, there is still not a lot of methods and cures that help children with language delay. However, there have been some recent therapy methods that have caused improvement in children with language delay. Certain types of therapy have been seen to show more or better improvement for the children compared to regular speech therapy. One such example is in the form of therapeutic horseback riding. It is also mentioned in a study that animals are a good source of therapy for children with special needs in areas including communication skills.

In regards to demographic factors causing language delay, specifically poverty, system-level changes improve access to treatment and therapy for children with language delay.

=== Intervention ===
The parent and child relationship is bi-directional, which means that parents have an influence over their child&#x27;s language development, while the child has an influence over the parent&#x27;s communication styles. Parents have the ability to maintain language delay by offering the child a non-verbal environment or one where their communication may not be challenged. Intervention programs and strategies are found to be beneficial to children with a specific language impairments. Research has found that the management strategies put to use are influenced by the child and the important participation of the parents. Parents are likely to follow the lead of the child&#x27;s language development.

One approach for intervening is naturalistic intervention. The child is in a natural environment where the communication is more responsive, rather than being more direct.

<doc id="1224171" wikidata="Q1193850" url="?curid=1224171" title="The General Died at Dawn">
<text>The General Died at Dawn is a 1936 American drama film that tells the story of a mercenary who meets a beautiful girl while trying to keep arms from getting to a vicious warlord in war-torn China. The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets and directed by Lewis Milestone.

It stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and Dudley Digges. Director Milestone has a cameo role.

==Plot==
General Yang, a warlord with control of one of China&#x27;s twelve provinces, plans to overtake them all with his army to corner the markets of silk, rice, and opium. However, the opposition in General Wu knows that Yang is lacking in enough men to hinder any chance of invasion, complete with desertion in certain numbers minus the most loyal. As such, Wu searches out for O&#x27;Hara, a soldier of fortune, to go to Shanghai to buy weapons from a gunrunner in Brighton that is selling to the first bidder. The money is kept in a belt that was funded by peasants under the oppression of Yang. In the way of all of this is the Perrie family, made up of Peter and his daughter Judy. Peter is dying soon and plans to take some of the money so Judy can see America. She reluctantly goes with her father&#x27;s plan to distract O&#x27;Hara while Yang makes his way across the train to capture him in order to buy the weapons.

The romantic plan works to capture O&#x27;Hara, but Judy has second thoughts about the trip to America. Complicating matters is a man named Leach who tries to get a cut from Peter&#x27;s theft. Peter hides the money in the lining of his suitcase and ignores his daughter&#x27;s desire to not engage with the money. O&#x27;Hara escapes capture by Yang and gets to the house where Wu is awaiting him. Peter tries to save himself and his hiding place by shooting him in the hand, but O&#x27;Hara gets the upper hand and kills him. Yang arrives and takes Judy, O&#x27;Hara, and Wu all captive on the boat and wants the money. Leach, trying to play at the hand of the General, is left to be shot by his men. Judy is prepared to tell Yang where the money is to save the lives of the other two, but Yang cruelly orders her to kiss O&#x27;Hara goodbye first. A man named Brighton finds the money in a stupor looking for alcohol when he wakes to see Yang&#x27;s soldiers. When he angrily states the currency being American and tries to escape the clutches of soldiers, he stumbles onto an incoming Yang while wielding a knife that mortally wounds the general. O&#x27;Hara tries to argue that Yang must let the folks live because otherwise the world will believe disloyal guards killed Yang. With the guns at hand, O&#x27;Hara, trying to save the lives of Judy and Wu, then pleads with him to let them live so they can tell the story of the general&#x27;s greatness. Yang, convinced, orders his men to kill each other for the sake of honor before he himself dies. Dawn breaks as Judy and O&#x27;Hara embrace.

==Production==
There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white doorknob, and then dissolves to a white billiard ball to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative.

The main character, O&#x27;Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer Morris Abraham &quot;Two-Gun&quot; Cohen. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China.

This is reported to be the first film to use foam latex prosthetics. Makeup artist Charles Gemora applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors.

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mildly good review, calling it &quot;as good as anything to be seen on the screen in London&quot;. Greene noted that it was &quot;a melodrama of more than usual skill&quot;, but criticized the end of the film and suggested that but-for the &quot;rather ludicrous ending, this would have been one of the best &#x27;thrillers&#x27; for some years&quot;.

John Howard Reid called it one of the fifty finest films Hollywood ever made.

==Awards and nominations==
The movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Akim Tamiroff), Best Cinematography, and Best Music, Score.

==In popular culture==
In 1938 an animated cartoon, called &quot;The Major Lied Till Dawn&quot;, was produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions. In it, a major tells tall tales about his hunting adventures to a boy who resembles Freddie Bartholomew. The character of the major may have been influenced by Colonel Heeza Liar.

A third-season episode of the TV show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was entitled &quot;The General Flipped at Dawn&quot; (broadcast September 10, 1974). In the episode, Harry Morgan appears as Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele, a batty general who is convinced that the 4077th needs to move closer to the front lines, to be near the action. (Morgan formally joined the cast of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in Season Four as the much-saner Colonel Sherman T. Potter.)

&quot;The General Danced at Dawn&quot; is a collection of short stories by George MacDonald Fraser first published in 1970.

<text>Private George Allan Mitchell VC (30 August 1911 – 24 January 1944) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
George Allan Michell was born on 30 August 1911 in Highgate, north London. He attended Farmer Lane Boys&#x27; School in Leyton, at that time in Essex, but now in the London Borough of Waltham Forest in east London. He was also active in Scouting in Leyton.

Mitchell was 32 years old, and a private in the British Army during the Second World War whilst serving with the 1st Battalion, London Scottish (Gordon Highlanders), during the Battle of Monte Damiano (part of the First Battle of Monte Cassino) in the Italian campaign when he earned the VC.

His citation in the London Gazette reads:

==The medal==
The Victoria Cross was presented to Mitchell&#x27;s family By King George VI in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 17 July 1945. In 1949, his brother placed Mitchell&#x27;s medal group in the care of Farmer Road School, which was renamed George Mitchell School in his honour in 1959. In 2006, in an agreement organised by Mitchell&#x27;s nephew, the medals were moved to the London Scottish Regimental Museum in Horseferry Road, London, The museum purchased the medals from the school for £150,000, which went towards the cost of a mobile classroom.

<doc id="1224174" wikidata="Q929554" url="?curid=1224174" title="South Lebanon Army">
<text>The South Lebanon Army or South Lebanese Army (SLA; , ), also known as the Lahad Army () or as the De Facto Forces (DFF), was a Christian-dominated militia in Lebanon. It was founded by Lebanese military officer Saad Haddad in 1977, amidst the Lebanese Civil War, and evolved to operate as a quasi-military during the South Lebanon conflict, basing itself in Haddad&#x27;s unrecognized State of Free Lebanon.

Initially, it was known as the &quot;Free Lebanon Army&quot; after it broke away from the Army of Free Lebanon, another Christian-dominated militia. After 1979, the SLA&#x27;s activity was almost exclusively confined to southernmost Lebanon. Under the aegis of Israel, the militia was bolstered by the 1982 Lebanon War. It came under increasing Israeli supervision following the collapse of the State of Free Lebanon in 1984 and subsequent establishment of the South Lebanon security belt administration.

As the most prominent pro-Israel militia in Israeli-occupied Lebanon, the SLA frequently engaged in armed clashes with Hezbollah, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and other militant groups.

After Israeli forces withdrew from Lebanon on 22 May 2000, the SLA positions collapsed in the face of Lebanese civilians and Hezbollah&#x27;s advance towards South Lebanon and Saad Haddad&#x27;s statue was dragged through the streets of Marjayoun. SLA members either fled to Israel, constituting Lebanese people in Israel, or were captured and tried for treason.

==History==

In 1975, at the town of Marjayoun in the Jabal Amel region of southern Lebanon, some local 300 Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF) and Guardians of the Cedars (GoC) militiamen were mustered together into the so-called &quot;Free Lebanese Militia&quot; – FLM (Arabic: &quot;Al-Milishia Al-Lubnaniyyat Al-Hura&quot;), ostensibly formed to defend the nearby Christian towns of Kfar Falous, Jezzine, Qlaiaa, Ain Ebel, Rumeish and surrounding villages threatened by Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and later by Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) attacks. In reality, the muster was secretly carried by Lieutenant Ya&#x27;ir Ravid of the AMAN (the Israeli military intelligence service), who envisaged using them as a buffer force to prevent a Palestinian military build-up in the border area that could threaten the security of northern Israel. A second muster took place at Qlaiaa in early 1976, gathering a force of some 400 Christian soldiers – mostly deserters from the Lebanese Army and Tigers Militia&#x27; militants – led by Major Sami Shidyaq, a Phalange militant.

In January 1976, as a result of the ongoing civil war, the Lebanese Army began to break up into two rival factions, the Muslim-led Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) who sided with the Muslim-leftist militias of the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) and their allies of the PLO guerrilla factions, and the Christian-led Army of Free Lebanon (AFL) aligned with the Christian-rightist militias of the Lebanese Front. Some Christian Lebanese Army officers commanding units based throughout the country joined the AFL with their men, including Major Saad Haddad, the commander of the 700-strong Marjayoun garrison in southern Lebanon.

By late 1976, pressure from PLO and LNM-LAA militias finally forced Major Saad Haddad to evacuate the town and withdraw unopposed with his battalion to the village of Qlaiaa, close to the border with Israel. Here Maj. Haddad and his men placed themselves under the protection of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), eventually providing the cadre – after merging with the local Christian FLM, Shia Muslim and Druze militias, gathered since October 21, 1976, into the informal &quot;Army for the Defense of South Lebanon&quot; or ADSL (French: &quot;Armée de Défense du Liban-Sud&quot; or ADLS) – of the so-called &quot;Free Lebanese Army&quot; (FLA), formed in March 1978 under the auspices of another AMAN officer, reserve Major Yoram Hamizrachi.

Primarily based at the towns of Marjayoun and Qlaiaa in southern Lebanon, and provisionally headquartered at the Hotel Arazim in Metula, Israel, the 1,200-strong FLA/SLA was initially placed under the overall command of Hamizrachi himself. In June 1978, Major Hamizrachi handed over the post to Major (later, Colonel) Saad Haddad, in turn replaced upon his death from Cancer in January 1984 by another ex-LAF Officer, retired Lieutenant general Antoine Lahad, who was also a NLP sympathiser.

The new FLA fought against various groups including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Amal Movement and (after the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon) the emerging Hezbollah. While the group was no longer under the direct control of the Lebanese Army command, from 1976 to 1979 its members were still receiving their pay from the Lebanese central government.

The 1978 Israeli invasion allowed the Free Lebanon Army to gain control over a much wider area in southern Lebanon. On April 18, 1979, Haddad proclaimed the area controlled by his force the &quot;Independent Free Lebanon&quot;. The following day, he was branded a traitor by the Lebanese government and officially dismissed from the Lebanese Army under presidential decree No. 1924. Part of the Army of Free Lebanon returned to government control, while Haddad&#x27;s part split away and was renamed the South Lebanon Army (SLA) in May 1980. In 1982, soldiers from the SLA were reported to have aided in the LF led Sabra and Shatila massacre. Though Haddad&#x27;s men were cleared by an Israeli panel for the massacre, SLA militiamen were known to still engage in brutality. Following Haddad&#x27;s death from cancer in 1984, he was replaced as leader by retired Lieutenant General Antoine Lahad.

In 1984 SLA militiamen were paid $300 a month. The SLA was closely allied with Israel. It supported the Israelis by fighting the PLO in southern Lebanon until the 1982 invasion. After that, SLA support for the Israelis consisted mainly of fighting other Lebanese guerrilla forces led by Hezbollah until 2000 in the &quot;security zone&quot; (the area under occupation after a partial Israeli withdrawal in 1985). In return, Israel supplied the organization with arms, uniforms, and logistical equipment.

The SLA hosted the Christian radio station Voice of Hope (established and funded by George Otis, founder of High Adventure Ministries). Beginning in 1982, the SLA played host to Middle East Television (which was also established, funded, and operated by High Adventure Ministries). Otis gave Middle East Television (METV) to Televangelist Pat Robertson, founder of CBN. On May 2, 2000, Middle East Television relocated to Cyprus.

In 1985 the SLA opened the Khiam detention center. Torture was a common tactic, and occurred on a large scale. Israel denies any involvement, and claims that Khiam was the sole responsibility of the SLA; this has been contested by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International. The SLA also imposed military conscription, under which males over 18 living in the territory it controlled served one year as military recruits. While the SLA received funding, weapons, and logistics from Israel during its existence, the SLA did much fighting independent from Israeli forces. The SLA also handled all civilian governmental operations in Israel&#x27;s zone of control.

During the 1990s Hezbollah carried out increasingly effective attacks on the SLA, aided in later years by Lebanese army intelligence which had infiltrated it. These changed circumstances led to a progressive loss of morale and members. In 1997, Israel maintained approximately 1,000 to 1,200 troops in southern Lebanon and supported another 2,000 in the SLA. By 2000 the SLA was reduced to 1,500 soldiers, compared to 3,000 ten years earlier. At its peak during the early 1980s, the SLA was composed of over 5,000 soldiers.

==Israeli withdrawal, SLA collapse, and surrender==
The increase in Israeli casualties in Lebanon over the previous few years led to growing domestic pressure for an end to Israel&#x27;s military presence in Lebanon. Ehud Barak&#x27;s Labor Party pledged during his March 1999 election campaign for Prime Minister to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon by July 2000. Barak won a victory in the May 1999 elections.

On 1 June 1999, the South Lebanon Army began dismantling its TV station and headquarters in Jezzine. In the following two weeks they withdrew from the town and thirty six surrounding villages. Retreating SLA members and their families commandeered empty houses in Marjayun, Ibl al-Saqi and Kawkaba in the Indian UNIFIL zone. At the time it was estimated that the SLA had only four hundred men.

On March 5, 2000, the Israeli cabinet voted unanimously for a full troop withdrawal from Lebanon by July. The expectation then was that such a withdrawal would be part of an agreement with Lebanon and Syria; however, negotiations with Syria broke down. On May 22, Israeli forces unilaterally began handing over their forward positions in the occupied zone to the SLA. As the chaotic nature of the withdrawal became obvious, civilians from the zone overran SLA positions to return to their occupied villages while Hezbollah guerrillas quickly took control of areas previously controlled by the SLA. The SLA in the central sector of the security zone collapsed in the face of the civilians and Hezbollah&#x27;s rapid advance. The next day, SLA forward positions in the eastern sector collapsed and Israeli forces began their general withdrawal from the remaining areas of the security zone. With the Israeli withdrawal, the SLA collapsed totally. The withdrawal was complete on Wednesday, May 24, 2000; the sight of Saad Haddad&#x27;s statue being dragged through the streets of the Lebanese town of Marjayoun was a sure sign that the South Lebanon Army was gone.

As the Israeli withdrawal rapidly progressed, SLA militiamen were left with few choices. The Lebanese government, Hezbollah and many civilians in the area considered them traitors and collaborators. In addition, they were told that Israel&#x27;s border would be closed after the withdrawal. Many were terrified of being captured (and possibly killed) by Hezbollah guerrillas or vengeful mobs, or being jailed or executed by the Lebanese government.

Many members of the SLA (including some with their families) fled to Israel; the Christian majority feared being suspected of serious offences committed by SLA members, and a number of members were reportedly granted asylum in European countries (primarily Germany). Others who remained in Lebanon surrendered to authorities or were captured by Hezbollah and handed over to the police. SLA members captured by Lebanon and Hezbollah were tried by Lebanese military courts for treason.

Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak was criticized in Israel by the Jewish settler movement on the grounds that his decision to withdraw without consulting his SLA allies led to the speed and confusion of its collapse. Hezbollah was criticized for preventing the arrest of some members of the SLA; it justified this on the grounds that it was in a position to know who among them had been informants.

By the next month (June 2000), 3,000 former SLA members were in the custody of the Lebanese government; by the end of the year, about 90 percent had been tried in military courts. It has been estimated that a third of the SLA members were sentenced to less than a month and another third received one-year sentences. Two members of the SLA accused of torture at Al-Khiam prison received life sentences. The death penalty was recommended for 21 SLA members, but in each case the military reduced the sentence. Certain other individuals were barred from returning to Southern Lebanon for a number of years.

Of those who initially fled to Israel, many SLA members and their families eventually chose to return to Lebanon after Hezbollah promised they would not be harmed. Others accepted Israel&#x27;s offer of full citizenship and a financial package similar to that granted new immigrants, and settled permanently in Israel. On April 6, 2006, the Israeli Knesset Finance Committee approved the payment of 40,000 shekels per family to SLA veterans, payable over seven years. Many of the SLA fighters who settled in Israel later moved to the United States and Europe. Approximately 6,500 SLA fighters and family members moved to Israel, of whom 2,700 remained in the country permanently. They are mainly concentrated in Nahariya, Kiryat Shmona, Tiberias, Ma&#x27;alot-Tarshiha, and Haifa. As of 2021, there are 3,500 Lebanese in Israel, former SLA members and their families.

Israel continues to host the Government of Free Lebanon, on whose behalf the SLA had operated. The Government of Free Lebanon has operated from Jerusalem since 2000, and still claims to be the true government of Lebanon.

==Field organization==
The SLA was organized into two regions (western and eastern), each with its own infantry brigade. Each brigade consisted of three battalion-sized infantry regiments; the strength of support included several heavy-artillery batteries (155 and 130mm), subdivided into the infantry battalions as needed. There was also an armored regiment of 55 tanks.

This force manned 46 locations along the front (from Naqoura in the west to the eastern slopes of Mount Hermon), while the Israeli Army had 11 centers, mostly in the rear lines.

The SLA Security Service consisted of 250 officers and men, tasked with:
* Counter-espionage by outside forces
* Border security

The service included field and intelligence officers, investigators, intelligence analysts, administrative personnel, security officers and guards.

<text>Centaurea diffusa, also known as diffuse knapweed, white knapweed or tumble knapweed, is a member of the genus &quot;Centaurea&quot; in the family Asteraceae. This species is common throughout western North America but is not actually native to the North American continent, but to the eastern Mediterranean.

==Description==
Diffuse knapweed is an annual or biennial plant, generally growing to between 10 and 60 cm in height. It has a highly branched stem and a large taproot, as well as a basal rosette of leaves with smaller leaves alternating on the upright stems. Flowers are usually white or pink and grow out of urn-shaped heads carried at the tips of the many branches. Diffuse knapweed often assumes a short rosette form for one year, reaching maximum size, then rapidly growing and flowering during the second year. A single plant can produce approximately 18,000 seeds.
==Synonyms==
* &quot;Centaurea microcalathina&quot; Tarassov
* &quot;Centaurea cycladum&quot; Heldr.
* &quot;Centaurea parviflora&quot; Sibth. &amp; Sm., &quot;non Desf.
* &quot;Centaurea comperiana&quot; Steven

==Distribution==
It is native to Eastern Europe and Western Asia, specifically the nations of Turkey, Syria, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Ukraine, and southern Russia.

==Invasive species==
Diffuse knapweed is considered an invasive species in some parts of North America, having established itself in many areas of the continent. &quot;C. diffusa&quot; was first identified in North America in 1907 when it was found in an alfalfa field in Washington state. The seeds had presumably been transported in an impure alfalfa seed shipment coming from somewhere in the species native range. Now present in at least 19 states in the United States, it has naturalized in all contiguous states west of the Rockies and additionally in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Portions of western Canada have also been colonized by this plant.

Areas in which diffuse knapweed has been established generally are plains rangelands or forest benchlands. Land that has recently been disturbed is commonly colonized. It grows in semi-arid and arid environments and seems to favor light, dry, porous soils. Areas with large amounts of shade or high levels of water discourage diffuse knapweed growth.

&quot;C. diffusa&quot; can be dispersed in multiple ways, such as contamination of food, wind dispersal, and water dispersal however wind is the primary dispersal method.
===Effects===
By 1998 diffuse knapweed had naturalized over in the western US, and was increasing its range at a rate of 18% annually. Diffuse knapweed can establish itself in grassland, scrubland and riparian environments. It has little value as feed for livestock, as its thistles can damage the mouth and digestive tract of animals that attempt to feed on it. A study in 1973 concluded that ranches lost approximately US$20/km2 (8 cents per acre) of diffuse knapweed due to decreased grazing area. In an agricultural setting, it can greatly reduce crop yield and purity. 

===Control===
Effective control of diffuse knapweed requires a fusion of well-executed land management, biological control, physical control, chemical control and reestablishment of the native species. Any method of control must ensure that the root is removed or the plant will grow back. Additionally, native plant growth in areas where diffuse knapweed has been removed should be encouraged to prevent reestablishment.

====Biological control====
Biological control involves the introduction of organisms, usually natural competitors of the invasive species, into the invaded environment in order to control the invasive species. Since 1970, 12 insects have been released to control diffuse knapweed. Of these 12, 10 have become established, and 4 are widely established (&quot;Urophora affinis&quot; and &quot;Urophora quadrifasciata&quot;, the root boring beetle, &quot;Sphenoptera jugoslavica&quot;, and the weevil &quot;Larinus minutus&quot;). Research based on simulation models have shown that for biocontrol agents to be effective, they must kill their host, otherwise plants can compensate by having increased seedling survival.

Some of the more commonly utilized biocontrol agents are the Lesser knapweed flower weevil and the Knapweed root weevil. Individuals of these species lay their eggs on the seed heads of both diffuse and spotted knapweed. When the larvae emerge from the eggs, they feed upon the seeds of their host plant. As the females of this species can create from 28 to 130 eggs and each larva can consume an entire seed head, an adequate population of &quot;Larinus minutus&quot; can devastate entire stands of knapweed. The adult weevils feed upon the stems, branches, leaves and undeveloped flower buds. It is native to Greece and is now found in Montana, Washington, Idaho and Oregon. Insects are also used for biocontrol, such as the Yellow-winged knapweed root moth (&quot;Agapeta zoegana&quot;), and several species of Tephritid flies, mostly &quot;Urophora affinis&quot; and &quot;Urophora quadrifasciata&quot;. 
====Physical control====
Physical control of diffuse knapweed primarily comprises cutting, digging or burning to remove the plants. 

Cutting 

While cutting the aboveground portion of diffuse knapweed will greatly decrease the spread of seeds, it does not remove the root. With only its root still intact, diffuse knapweed can survive and continue to grow. For a program of cutting to be effective, it must be long-term so that the effect of reduced seed spreading can be realized. 

Digging 

this removes both the portion above ground and the root of diffuse knapweed and has shown to be very effective; if the plant is properly disposed of, it can neither regrow nor spread its seeds. The largest problem with digging knapweed is that it is extremely labor-intensive. Additionally, the recently vacated soil should be planted with a native species to avoid knapweed reintroducing itself in the disturbed soil. 

Burning 

setting fire to a crowd of knapweed, if the fire is sufficiently severe, can successfully destroy the above ground and belowground sections of diffuse knapweed. However, precautions must be taken to first ensure that the fire is properly contained and that a new plant community is established to prevent the reintroduction of diffuse knapweed. 
====Chemical control====
Chemical control involves the use of herbicides to control diffuse knapweed. The herbicide Tordon (picloram) is recognized as the most effective, but it is common to use multiple herbicides in order to reduce strain on local grasses. The herbicides 2,4-D, dicamba, and glyphosate are also effective for control. In order to be most effective, it must be applied before the knapweed plants have released their seeds, regardless of which herbicide is used. Ongoing research at the University of Colorado suggests that Tordon treatment does not contribute to long-term reductions of exotic species cover and may contribute to recruitment of other invasive species, such as redstem filaree and Japanese brome, which quickly take the place of herbicide-treated diffuse knapweed.

===Human influence on invasion===
One of the first influences humans had on diffuse knapweed was to inadvertently introduce it to North America.

Diffuse knapweed is known to establish more easily and effectively in recently disturbed environments. Disturbed environments generally present low environmental stress because more resources are available than are being used. These available resources often allow the establishment of an invasion in an ecological community. The concentration of diffuse knapweed in such an area is often linked to the level of soil disturbance. Human disturbances often lead to less species diversity in a community. In turn, less species diversity can lead to unused resources, which allow invasive species to more readily establish. Areas such as fallow land, ditches, rangelands, residential and industrial districts and roadsides are all disturbed habitats where diffuse knapweed frequently establishes. Additionally, the removal of foliage and other ground cover increases the likelihood that seeds will come in contact with the soil and germinate.

The largest impact of humans on diffuse knapweed is efforts in controlling and eradicating its invasive populations. Besides reducing the spread of diffuse knapweed, efforts are also providing selective pressure against the individuals that cannot withstand a certain method of control. Selective pressure, given sufficient time, can cause the adaptation or evolution of invasive species such as diffuse knapweed. If an individual diffuse knapweed plant survives control efforts because of a trait it possesses, its progeny will make up a greater portion of the population than the plants that succumbed to the control.

===Toward an integrated control strategy===
To successfully control diffuse knapweed, an understanding of the mechanism that allows it to be invasive must be developed. Isolating the reason for its invasiveness would allow control methods designed to specifically target the effectiveness of that mechanism to be developed. Additionally, precautions designed to minimize the invisibility of at-risk environments could be carried out.

===Summary===
The success of diffuse knapweed must be attributed to a combination of several mechanisms. Its invasiveness is due to a mix of allelopathy, the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) and superior resource competition. However, the most importance must be attributed to the ERH because diffuse knapweed, while a very effective invasive species in its novel environment, is non-invasive and doesn&#x27;t establish monocultures in its native range. It is the differences, biotic and abiotic, between its novel and native surroundings that cause it to be invasive.

To demonstrate that the ERH applies to diffuse knapweed, it is essential to show that the absence of natural enemies has a significant positive effect on its success. One way to show this is to observe the effect of introducing some of diffuse knapweed&#x27;s natural enemies into its novel environment. If diffuse knapweed, which generally thrives in its invaded environment, is significantly inhibited through the introduction of natural enemies, it can be concluded that diffuse knapweed is more competitive in the absence of its natural enemies. A recent effort at biocontrol of diffuse knapweed in Idaho&#x27;s Camas County effectively reduced of knapweed to minimal levels through the release of the lesser knapweed flower weevil and the knapweed root weevil. Since both of the insects released are natural competitors of diffuse knapweed, and since this and other similar efforts at biocontrol have been successful, there is significant evidence that diffuse knapweed benefits from the absence of its natural enemies.

Another aspect of diffuse knapweed&#x27;s success relies on the effect of its allelopathic chemicals in its novel environment. Although there is still debate concerning the effectiveness of allelopathic chemicals in the field, the evidence of allelopathic effects demonstrated in a laboratory setting and its propensity to establish monocultures support the importance of allelopathy to diffuse knapweed&#x27;s success.

Curiously, diffuse knapweed&#x27;s allelopathic chemicals were shown to have a deleterious effect on the North American competitors but were beneficial to its native competitors. While diffuse knapweed&#x27;s native competitors are able to compete more effectively in the presence of allelopathic chemicals, the novel competitor&#x27;s fitness is decreased. This situation provides an example of the effectiveness of the allelopathy mechanism benefiting from the ERH. The increased effectiveness of allelopathic chemicals cause diffuse knapweed to experience less competitive pressure. As a result, diffuse knapweed is able to establish more predominantly in this new area.

Another connection between allelopathy and the ERH is the fact that concentrations of allelopathic chemicals were found to increase when diffuse knapweed was planted in North American soil as opposed to Eurasian soil. This effect is probably due to the absence of unfavorable soil conditions or soil microorganisms that exist in its native environment. As a result, the allelopathic chemicals will be able to reach higher concentrations, spread farther and therefore be more effective. By effecting more neighboring plants, the favorable changes in soil condition contribute to the success of diffuse knapweed.

Besides the advantages that diffuse knapweed gains from the ERH and allelopathy, it also possesses several characteristically invasive traits. One factor leading to the superior resource competition of diffuse knapweed is its ability to exist in drought conditions. This advantage allows diffuse knapweed to devote its resources to competition while its neighbors are conserving resources to survive. The high number of seeds produced by diffuse knapweed is also a common trait of invasive plants. A higher density of knapweed will not only increase the concentration of allelopathic chemicals in the soil but will also restrict the nutrients available to native plants. Unfortunately, very little research has been conducted to determine the relative competitive ability between diffuse knapweed and its novel competitors. However, tests conducted on the effect of diffuse knapweed on North American grasses in the absence on allelopathic chemicals demonstrated that the fitness of these grasses declined in the presence of diffuse knapweed.

Diffuse knapweed is successful in its novel range primarily because the organisms and conditions that prevent it from becoming invasive in its native environment are absent. It follows that the introduction of species from its native habitat would be an effective method of control. However, the introduction of a non-native organism has the potential to result in another invasive species outbreak. Therefore, any method of biological control must be preceded by analysis of possible effects.

==Phytochemicals==
The roots of Centaurea diffusa release 8-hydroxyquinoline, which has a negative effect on plants that have not co-evolved with it.

<doc id="1224181" wikidata="Q976893" url="?curid=1224181" title="Nokia 9300">
<text>The Nokia 9300 is a Nokia Series 80 Symbian mobile phone introduced in 2004. It is used as a normal though bulky mobile phone in closed mode, when it is flipped open it can be used like a very small notebook computer with a 640×200 screen. The phone also has speakerphone functionality, which is activated automatically when the phone is flipped open. An MP3 player is also built into the phone. It didn&#x27;t have vibration motor due to its shape.

The Nokia 9300 was released shortly after the Nokia 9500 Communicator.

Although very similar to the 9500 Communicator, this less expensive model was not officially marketed under the Communicator name by Nokia.

In the United States, the 9300b was sold through Cingular&#x27;s Business division.

The Nokia 9300 PDA phone was a prominent feature in Live Free or Die Hard, used by character Matt Farrell. 

The Nokia 9300i is an updated version with WiFi capability

== Differences from the 9500 Communicator ==
* Smaller – 132 × 51 × 21 mm compared to the 9500&#x27;s 148 × 57 × 24 mm
* Physically smaller screen with 9500&#x27;s resolution that can be tilted full 180 degrees
* No Wi-Fi, except in 9300i
* No built-in camera
* Smaller battery – 970mAh BP-6M battery (later revisions of BP-6M are 1100mAh however) compared to the 9500&#x27;s 1300mAh BP-5L
* Doesn&#x27;t bear the traditional name &quot;Communicator&quot;

Other than changes listed above, it is technically the same as the 9500, with the same 150 MHz processor, MMC memory card capability, the same amount of memory and the same screen resolution and colour depth. Both phones run the same version 7 of the Symbian OS.

== Variations in the 9300 line ==
The 9300 is the World version, with 900 MHz and 1800 MHz radios, plus 1900 MHz for North America. The 9300b is the North American model, with 850 MHz and 1900 MHz radios, plus 1800 MHz for world travel. Both, the 9300 and the 9300b will work in the US, but in the US the 9300b outperforms the 9300 in its ability to work in areas with weak cell coverage.

One can tell the 9300 and the 9300b apart by looking at the back of the phone. The 9300b has a portion next to the battery cover that is raised by approximately 2 mm (1/16&quot;). The model number is marked on the label underneath the battery. The label on a 9300 sold in Germany reads: &quot;NOKIA Model: 9300 Type RAE-6&quot;. On a 9300b sold in the US the label reads: &quot;NOKIA Model 9300/b Type: RA-4&quot;, and on a 9300i sold in Germany it reads: &quot;Nokia Model 9300i Type: RA-8&quot;. Alternatively one can type *#0000# into the phone cover keypad in standby mode to display the model number.

The 9300&#x27;s successor, the Nokia 9300i, restores Wi-Fi capability without adding a camera. The 9300i is only available with 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz radios. A version of the 9300i with 850 MHz radio capability was never made in any part of the world. Latest official firmware version is 6.27 (released July 2006).

All variants of the 9300 include multi-profile Bluetooth and IR for interoperability, the Opera web browser, a POP3/IMAP/BlackBerry Enterprise Server-compatible/SMS/MMS e-mail and messaging client, the ability to create, read, write and edit native Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. The external display above the twelve-key dial pad on the exterior of the phone runs Series 40 applications, so texting and simple functions can be performed one-handed without opening the clamshell. There is &quot;T9&quot; option while messaging. The external keypad can autolock only if an unlocking code is set. The cellphone radio can be turned off while permitting applications to run, for in-flight use.

A wide selection of third party applications to enhance the 9300 series is available through multiple websites. The 9300 also runs Java applications but some of these are not compatible with the large and wide screen, such that many existing Java games will run, but only use the top left hand corner of the screen.

<doc id="1224182" wikidata="Q5043042" url="?curid=1224182" title="Carlton North">
<text>Carlton North is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Melbourne and Yarra local government areas. Carlton North recorded a population of 6,177 at the 2021 census.

The suburb is bordered by Princes Street and Cemetery Road to the south, Royal Parade to the west, Nicholson Street to the east and Park Street to the north. Carlton North is home to the Melbourne General Cemetery and the Princes Park, which contains the Princes Park Football Ground.

Its main commercial area is along Rathdowne Street, which has numerous cafés, restaurants, small fashion boutiques, bookshops and other businesses.

Today, Carlton North, like other inner-northern suburbs of Melbourne, contains a mixture of white-collar professionals, bureaucrats and academics. The area has become more gentrified than Fitzroy North, Brunswick or Collingwood, resulting in significantly higher median property prices.

==History==

Carlton North has its origins with the allotment of the Melbourne General Cemetery in 1853. Previous cemetery sites at Flagstaff Gardens and (what is now) Queen Victoria Market had become full, thus the new Carlton North site was established. In the same year a prison stockade, Collingwood Stockade, was built on Lee Street. This subsequently became an asylum until 1873 when it became the area&#x27;s first primary school. A bluestone quarry was established at what is now Curtain Square. Subdivision into residential blocks began in 1869, with the emerging brick terrace houses standing in contrast to Carlton&#x27;s timber cottages. Princes Park was established in 1844 and became home to the Carlton Football Club in 1864.

Cable tram lines were installed along Lygon Street, Rathdowne Street, and Nicholson Street in the 1880s. The Lygon and Nicholson street routes were subsequently converted to electric traction, but the Rathdowne Street route was closed in 1936 and replaced with buses. The area was also serviced by the Inner Circle railway line (passenger services were ceased in 1948 although it remained a goods line until 1980). However Carlton North station was located in Princes Hill and no railway station was ever built in Carlton North.

==Demographics==

In the 2016 census, there were 6,300 people in Carlton North. The most common ancestries were English 24.6%, Australian 17.0%, Irish 12.4%, Scottish 9.2% and Italian 7.6%. 70.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.7%, New Zealand 3.1% and Italy 2.4%. 77.1% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian 4.5% and Greek 1.6%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 54.3% and Catholic 18.9%.

==Commerce and culture==

The main commercial precincts in Carlton North are the strip on Rathdowne Street (called &#x27;Rathdowne Village&#x27;) and the northern end of Nicholson Street. The most notable businesses in the area include the original La Porchetta pizza restaurant (which has since become an Australia and New Zealand-wide franchise) and the Natural Tucker Bakery.

In 2010 St Michael&#x27;s Anglican Church celebrated its 125th anniversary.

The Albanian Mosque in Carlton North is the oldest mosque in Melbourne, built by Albanian Australians in the late 1960s.

Dancehouse, a centre for independent contemporary dance, is located on Princes Street in the former Carlton Hall.

==Housing==

Carlton North has a large amount of Victorian and Edwardian era attached and semi-detached terrace houses. Since the 1950s as a result of gentrification many of these properties have been renovated.

In 1968 the announced acquisition by the Housing Commission of Victoria of a block of houses on an area bounded by Lygon, Princes, Lee and Drummond Street (the &quot;Lee Street block&quot; became the trigger for the formation of the Carlton Association in March 1969). Following the placement of a Black Ban on the site by a number of trade unions (including the Builders Labourers Federation) and a strong public relations and lobbying campaign by the resident action group, the Carlton Association were successful in seeing the site saved by 1973, with a number of the properties heritage listed by the National Trust. Parts of Carlton North&#x27;s housing also came under threat during the 1970s as a result of the Housing Commissions &#x27;urban renewal&#x27; program as well as plans to construct the F19 Freeway through the suburb, however the activities of the Carlton Association, trade unions and other community activists prevented this from occurring and the suburb remains one of the very few in inner Melbourne without any Housing Commission flats. Today large parts of Carlton North are covered by various heritage overlays.

==Pubs==

* The Great Northern Hotel
* The Kent Hotel (Formerly the Duke of Kent) - Kent Hotel
* The Brandon Hotel

===Former hotels===
* The Fenwick Hotel. Converted into a large house
* Nicholson&#x27;s Hotel (formerly Chestnut Tree Hotel, North Star Hotel and Polaris Inn Hotel). Extended and converted into flats.
* The Rising Sun Hotel. Now trading as Enoteca Sileno grocers

==Transport==
The suburb is serviced by the main roads of Royal Parade, Lygon Street, Princes Street, Rathdowne Street and Nicholson Street.

Tram routes run north–south along Royal Parade (route 19), Lygon Street (routes 1 &amp; 6) and Nicholson Street (route 96).

The railway station which was located in Princes Hill was closed to passengers in 1948 and freight in the early 1980s. Part of the former line was utilised for Housing Commission units for the elderly and part was turned into a rather long and narrow park. Carlton North also has significant segregated bicycle facilities, including the Capital City Trail. The Carlton North section is a converted rail trail.

==Parks and open space==
===Melbourne General Cemetery===
Melbourne General Cemetery is a large (43 hectare) necropolis which is notable for containing the graves of four Prime Ministers of Australia: James Scullin, Sir Robert Menzies, Harold Holt, and Sir John Gorton. Holt&#x27;s stone is a memorial as his body was never recovered after he disappeared at sea. The tomb of famous Australian explorers Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke and William John Wills (see Burke and Wills expedition) is also located in the cemetery, with an inscription reading &quot;Comrades in a great achievement and companions in 
death.&quot;

<doc id="1224195" wikidata="Q945151" url="?curid=1224195" title="Piedade (Lajes do Pico)">
<text>Piedade is a civil parish in the municipality of Lajes do Pico on the island of Pico, the Portuguese Azores. The population in 2011 was 844, in an area of 12.81 km2.

==History==
The parish was founded after 1506, from the historical registers of the time.

The 1755 Lisbon earthquake affected the community, resulting in the destruction of many homes and the parochial church of the time.
Before their destruction by phylloxera plague, the vineyards in this location were great producers of the popular Verdelho wines, becoming one of the more important agricultural centres on the island.

The &quot;Direcção de Serviços de Conservação da Natureza do Pico&quot; (&quot;Service Directorate of the Natural Conservancy of Pico&quot;) and &quot; Serviço de Ambiente do Pico&quot; (&quot;Environmental Services of Pico&quot;) were installed in the Parque Florestal Matos Souto (&quot;Forest Park Matos Souto&quot;), a park dedicated to commander Manuel Matos Souto, an emigrante who departed for Brazil in the 19th century, where he made his fortune (resending his monies home in order to buy land on the island).

==Geography==
Piedade is located on the extreme east coast of Pico, bordering the parishes of Calheta de Nesquim and Ribeirinha, and connected by the Regional E.R.1-1ª roadway to other centers on the island. The parish is divided into three distinct zones (Piedade, Calhau and Manhenha), and includes two fishing ports (Port of Manhenha and Porto of Calhau), in addition to swimming areas in the areas of Baía da Engrade, Baía do Céu de Abraão, Baía da Caravela and Baía da Fonte. The parishes includes several localities, that includes smaller non-political communities within the civil parish, including: Altamora, Areal, Biscoito Queimado, Cabecinho, Castelete, Eiras, Galego, Calhau, Cruz do Redondo, Curral da Pedra, Engrade, Faias, Fetais, Manhenha and Ponta da Ilha.

==Architecture==

The patrimony of the parish is diverse, although the primary buildings are the parochial church and hermitage, the curious fishing boat shelters, windmills and lighthouse. The following were classified by IGESPAR as buildings of public interest:

===Civic===

* Lighthouse of Ponta da Ilha (), originally proposed in 1883, the lighthouse was only built in the mid-20th century, in lands ceded by Maria Adelaide Gomes, Paulina Gomes Ávila and their husbands for 200$00, rural lands in Calvino.

===Religious===

* Church of Nossa Senhora da Piedade (), the original church was built in 1506, but destroyed following the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, resulting in the construction of the present building after 1756.

<doc id="1224197" wikidata="Q2918925" url="?curid=1224197" title="Simon Ramo">
<text>Simon &quot;Si&quot; Ramo (May 7, 1913 – June 27, 2016) was an American engineer, businessman, and author. He led development of microwave and missile technology and is sometimes known as the father of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). He also developed General Electric&#x27;s electron microscope. He played prominent roles in the formation of two Fortune 500 companies, Ramo-Wooldridge (TRW after 1958, now part of Northrop Grumman) and Bunker Ramo Corporation (now part of Honeywell).

== Early years ==
Ramo was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, the son of Clara (Trestman) and Benjamin Ramo. His father was a Polish Jewish immigrant and his mother was a Russian Jewish immigrant. He entered the University of Utah at the age of 16, where he joined Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity and earned a B.S. in electrical engineering at the age of 20. By 1936, at the age of 23, he had earned dual PhD degrees from Caltech in physics and electrical engineering.

== Career ==
=== General Electric ===
From 1936 until 1946, he led electronics research at General Electric, where he accumulated 25 patents before the age of 30 and was cited as one of America&#x27;s most outstanding young electrical engineers. He became globally recognized as a leader in microwave research and headed the development of GE&#x27;s electron microscope.

=== Hughes Aircraft ===
In 1946 he returned to California to become director of research for the electronics department of Hughes Aircraft, and his career became coupled with that of Dean Wooldridge. Together they formed a successful team for many years, with Wooldridge concentrating on investment and general business aspects while Ramo led research, development and engineering.

By 1948, Hughes had created its Aerospace Group to work with the newly created U.S. Air Force. Dr. Ramo became a Vice-President and the Group&#x27;s Director of Operations. Ramo employed his skills in Systems Engineering to allow Hughes to deliver integrated RADAR and aircraft fire-control systems. He developed the air-to-air missile, creating the Falcon missile.

In 1953 Ramo and Dean Wooldridge left Hughes Aircraft and formed the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, later TRW Inc.

=== Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation (TRW Inc.) ===
By 1953 Ramo and the Air Force had become increasingly frustrated with management problems at Hughes. Ramo and Wooldridge were particularly concerned when Howard Hughes avoided their attempts to discuss the problem. In September they jointly resigned, and within a week they formed the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation on September 16, 1953.

In October 1953 an Assistant Secretary of Defense, Trevor Gardner, created a committee to consider the future of guided missiles. This Strategic Missile Evaluation Committee (SMEC) was headed by John von Neumann and included both Ramo and Wooldridge. In four months, the committee produced their report and recommended that a crash program was needed to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles, and that such a program might enable the United States to overtake Russian developments by 1959 or 1960.

The Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. became the lead contractor for the resulting Air Force program. With Dr. Ramo as the driving scientific and engineering officer, they succeeded. In 1958, an Atlas rocket delivered a payload 5,000 miles downrange. The Atlas would go on to serve as the launch vehicle for NASA&#x27;s Project Mercury orbital flights, starting with John Glenn in Friendship 7. USAF General Bernard Schriever, head of the ICBM program, described Ramo as &quot;the architect of the Thor, Atlas, and Titan&quot; rockets.

According to a July 30, 2002, article, Ramo&#x27;s comments are legendary for capsulizing complex ideas into off-the-cuff witticisms.

During a series of key experiments of ballistic missiles in the 1950s at Cape Canaveral, Florida, at which Ramo and Air Force General Bernard Schriever were observers, test rockets kept blowing up on their launch pads. When one missile rose about 6 inches before toppling over and exploding, Ramo reportedly beamed and said: &quot;Well, Benny, now that we know the thing can fly, all we have to do is improve its range a bit.&quot;

Ramo-Wooldridge merged with Thompson Products to become TRW Inc., and Simon Ramo became Vice-Chairman. In 1964, TRW and Martin Marietta formed the jointly owned Bunker Ramo Corporation with Ramo as President, which expanded into the computer and communications technology fields.

In January 2008, he joined the faculty of the University of Southern California&#x27;s Viterbi School of Engineering as a presidential chair and professor of electrical engineering. Ramo is also a founding member of the National Academy of Engineering.

== Awards, appointments and fellowships ==
Over the course of his career, Ramo received numerous awards and fellowships. He was honored by the American Philosophical Society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the American Physical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Ramo served as an advisor to the United States government on science and technology. He was a member of the National Science Board, the White House Council on Energy R&amp;D, the Advisory Council to the Secretary of Commerce, the Advisory Council to the Secretary of State for Science and Foreign Affairs, and of many special advisory committees to the Defense Department and NASA. President Gerald Ford appointed Ramo as co-chairman of a committee of distinguished scientists and engineers, requesting Ramo to list the science and technology issues most deserving of attention by the White House and to recommend actions. Following this, Ramo was appointed by President Ford to be chairman of The President&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Science and Technology, a position created by Congress to advise on how to ensure that science and technology matters receive proper attention at the White House.

In 1980, then-President-elect Ronald Reagan asked Ramo to assemble a transition task force to advise on executive branch appointments where science and technology background was desirable. President Reagan subsequently invited Ramo to be a Science Adviser to the President of the Republic of China. In that assignment, Ramo aided greatly Taiwan&#x27;s development of a strong high-technology industry.

On February 23, 1983, Ramo was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Reagan.

In 1982, the IEEE Board of Directors initiated the IEEE Simon Ramo Medal for exceptional achievement in systems engineering and systems science.

In 1988, Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity inducted Simon Ramo, Lambda (Utah)&#x27;33, into its Alumni Hall of Fame .

In 2007, the Space Foundation awarded Ramo its highest honor, the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.

In 2009, the Theta Tau Educational Foundation named an annual scholarship in his honor.

<text>Biograph is a compilation spanning the career of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on November 7, 1985, by Columbia Records. Consisting of 53 tracks, 18 of which were previously unreleased, from 1962 to 1981; the box set was released as a five-LP set, a three-cassette tape set, and a three-compact disc set. &quot;Biograph&quot; reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the U.S. and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

==Content==
The recordings on &quot;Biograph&quot; are a mix of rarities, hit singles, and album tracks. They are not presented in chronological order; 18 of its 53 tracks had not been previously issued, and three more had only been previously available on singles. Every studio album released by Dylan prior to the appearance of this box set is represented by at least one track, with the exceptions of &quot;Self Portrait&quot;, &quot;Dylan&quot;, &quot;Desire&quot;, &quot;Infidels&quot;, and &quot;Empire Burlesque&quot;, although two songs from &quot;Desire&quot; appear in live versions and &quot;Abandoned Love&quot; is from the &quot;Desire&quot; sessions. The set comes accompanied with a 36-page booklet, containing rare photos and liner notes by Cameron Crowe, who interviews Dylan about each of the tracks.

While too comprehensive to be strictly a greatest hits album, it does include nine of the dozen Top 40 hits by Dylan during the time period covered. Missing are &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot;, &quot;George Jackson&quot;, and &quot;Hurricane&quot;. Nine of the ten tracks from &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; appear on this compilation.

Initially released in all formats in a box conforming to the dimensions of a vinyl long-playing album, on August 19, 1997 it was reissued by Legacy Records in a smaller compact disc brick package, the tracks remastered using Sony&#x27;s Super-Bit Mapping process. On August 6, 2002, it was reissued again in a booklet format with three discs; yet another new issue of this edition appeared in the marketplace on April 5, 2011. The 2011 edition was mastered at Sterling Sound Studios in New York City.

==Track listing==
All tracks written by Bob Dylan except &quot;Baby Let Me Follow You Down&quot; by Gary Davis, Dave Van Ronk, and Eric von Schmidt, and both &quot;Isis&quot; and &quot;Romance in Durango&quot; by Dylan and Jacques Levy. The compact disc running order is the same, except disc two ends with &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; inserted after &quot;Isis&quot;. Disc one ends with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)&quot;, and disc two begins with &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot;. Disc three begins with &quot;Caribbean Wind&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Ceres&quot; was a small steamboat acquired by the Union Navy during the beginning of the American Civil War. She was outfitted as a gunboat and used in the Union blockade of the waterways of the Confederate States of America.

==Service history==
&quot;Ceres&quot;, an armed side-wheel merchant steamer, was built at Keyport, New Jersey in 1856. &quot;Ceres&quot; was purchased by the United States Navy on 11 September 1861, fitted out at the Washington Navy Yard, and commissioned the same month, Acting Master J. L. Elliott in command. Originally assigned to the Potomac Flotilla, &quot;Ceres&quot; was ordered on 18 September 1861 to report to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and for the remainder of the war, aside from repair periods at Baltimore, Maryland operated in the rivers and sounds of Virginia and North Carolina. Here she maintained the close watch for Confederate States merchantmen through which the blockading forces provided so important a part of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s contribution in the American Civil War. She was successful in capturing four blockade runners during her service, as well as aiding in the seizure of others.

Another crucial assignment carried out by &quot;Ceres&quot;&#x27; squadron was support for Union Army forces holding or attempting to take coastal positions, as well as providing boats and cover for amphibious operations, raids, and reconnaissance. She took part in the capture of Roanoke Island on 7–8 February 1862, during which she was hit while firing on Confederate shore positions. When nearby Confederate naval ships retired up Albemarle Sound as Roanoke Island fell, &quot;Ceres&quot; joined in following them, and next took part in the naval engagement off Elizabeth City, North Carolina. During this action, in which one of her men was wounded, she captured CSS &quot;Ellis&quot;.

Continuing her operations in North Carolinian waters, &quot;Ceres&quot; took the steamer &quot;Wilson&quot; on 9 July 1862 while covering the landing of an Army raiding party near Hamilton, North Carolina. Through most of 1863, she protected the forces holding such posts as Fort Anderson at New Bern, North Carolina and the positions near Washington, North Carolina, coming under fire from Confederate batteries on several occasions.

In the lengthy series of attacks around Plymouth, North Carolina, &quot;Ceres&quot; lost two men killed and six wounded when she was taken under heavy fire from Fort Grey, upriver from Plymouth, on 17 April 1864. Two days later, it was &quot;Ceres&quot; who gave warning of the approach of the formidable Confederate ram CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;, and took part in the first engagement with the ram which followed. On 5 May, her group again was engaged with &quot;Albemarle&quot; and two other steamers at the Battle of Albemarle Sound. Following the dramatic sinking of &quot;Albemarle&quot; by Lieutenant William B. Cushing, and later salvage, &quot;Ceres&quot; towed &quot;Albemarle&quot; north to Norfolk, Virginia at the close of the war. After a final patrol period off North Carolina, &quot;Ceres&quot; was decommissioned at New York City on 14 July 1865, and sold on 25 October 1865.

<text>The British Railways Standard Class 4 tank is a class of steam locomotive, one of the BR standard classes built during the 1950s. They were used primarily on commuter and outer suburban services. They were capable of reaching speeds of .

== Background ==
On the nationalisation of British Railways (BR) in 1948, the London Midland Region had a number of ex-London, Midland and Scottish Railway 2-6-4T and the Western Region a number of GWR Large Prairie 2-6-2T types. These tank engines were particularly suited to commuter and secondary services. However, particularly in Scotland and the Southern Region, the situation was far less ideal, with large numbers of pre-grouping classes struggling to keep up with traffic.

== Design and construction ==

On the decision to build the BR standard series of locomotives, a series of class four tank engines was ordered, based on the ex-LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T with some modifications. The lineage of the class could therefore be tracked through the LMS/BR Class 4 2-6-4T locomotives back to the Fowler design of 1927.

Design work was done at Brighton, the overall programme being overseen by Robert Riddles. The principal modifications to the Fairburn design involved the reduction of their envelope to enable them to fit into the L1 loading gauge. To do this, the tanks and cab were made more curved than the Fairburn design, the Fairburn having a straight-sided tank. The biggest mechanical change was a reduction in cylinder size, also to reduce cross-section, and a corresponding increase in boiler pressure to compensate. Other visible changes included the re-introduction of plating ahead of the cylinders.

130 of the class of 155 were built at Brighton, 15 (80000–80009, 80054–80058) at Derby Works and 10 (80106–80115) at Doncaster Works between 1951 and 1956. The first to emerge was 80010 from Brighton in 1951. Fifteen that were due to be constructed in 1957 were cancelled, due to impending dieselisation, and the last five would have been, too, had they not been at an advanced stage of construction when the order came to cancel them.

No significant modifications were made to the design. The tank vent was found to restrict the driver&#x27;s vision and was moved further forward from 80059 onwards. Initially built with fluted coupling rods, these caused problems on other classes and, from 80079, plain section coupling rods were substituted.

The BR Standard Class 4 4-6-0 was essentially a tender engine derivative of the Standard Class 4 tank.

== Service ==

The Standard 4 tanks were originally allocated to all regions of British Railways, bar the Western. They became particularly associated with the London, Tilbury and Southend line (LT&amp;S) working commuter services out of London, until that route was electrified in 1962. They were also widely used in East Sussex and Kent, working from Brighton, Tunbridge Wells and Three Bridges on those lines of the former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway that were not electrified. Another group worked from Polmadie depot in the Scottish region on the Glasgow commuter services. Note that, from July 1962, a batch displaced by electrification of the LT&amp;S was transferred to the Western Region&#x27;s Swansea (East Dock) and Shrewsbury districts, as well as other regions.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 24 April 1956, locomotive No. 80119 was derailed at , Yorkshire when the track spread under it whilst shunting. An instruction banning heavy locomotives from shunting at Scalby had been forgotten.
*On 30 January 1958, locomotive No. 80079 was hauling a passenger train that overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with another passenger train at , Essex. Ten people were killed and 89 were injured.
*On 18 April 1961, locomotive No. 80075 was hauling a passenger train that was derailed at , Essex due to a pointsman&#x27;s error during single line working.
*On 9 December 1962, locomotive No. 80102 was derailed at , Hampshire due to vandalism.

== Withdrawal ==

There was a mass withdrawal of steam locomotive classes in the 1960s. Older types were withdrawn in preference to the Standard 4s, whose class remained intact until 1964 (except for 80103 as noted below). The final nine were withdrawn from the Southern Region on 9 July 1967. One Scottish Region example, 80002, remained in Glasgow past the end of steam haulage until 1969 as a static carriage heating boiler; eventually being preserved on the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway.

No. 80103 was withdrawn in 1962 after being reported for rough riding. It was towed between two other locomotives to Stratford Works, where it was discovered that the mainframe was broken in half. Considered beyond economic repair, 80103 was withdrawn and scrapped. It was the first of the &#x27;Standard&#x27; locomotives to be withdrawn, and the only one scrapped at Stratford.
== Operation in preservation ==

Of the fifteen engines to survive into preservation, only one was purchased directly from BR and this was No. 80002, all the others being purchased from Barry Scrapyard. Of the fifteen engines to be preserved only two members of the class are yet to run in preservation, these being: 80100 and 80150. 80097 has recently been steamed in preservation and entered service in March 2019 following its restoration from scrapyard condition at the East Lancashire Railway. Five of them have also seen mainline operation: Nos. 80002, 80079, 80080, 80098 and 80135. 80002 operated over the former BR system in the 1970s when it appeared at an open weekend in Leeds arriving and returning home from the event under its own power. Three of the class were regular mainline performers around the &#x27;90s, with 80080 being originally used on LU &#x27;Steam on the Met&#x27; trips. In 1991, steam was to return to the Folkestone Harbour branch with 80080 taking the train down from the mainline to the station at Folkestone Harbour and then for the journey back up to the mainline 80080 was used to bank West Country Pacific No. 34027 Taw Valley.

80080 became the first steam locomotive to work a normal stopping passenger service on the mainline in March 1993. It also returned to the Cambrian network in 1992. In 1994, 80079 joined up with 80080 to work a number of steam specials including a run over the Cambrian Coast Line.

In 1998, 80079 became the first steam locomotive to work a steam special down the Conwy Valley Line to Blaenau Ffestiniog since 1967.

80079 returned to Blaenau in 1999 with 80098.

80135 has been used on the Grosmont to Whitby workings for the North Yorkshire Moors Railway on the Esk Valley Line.

The Bluebell Railway had hoped to preserve No. 80154, the last steam locomotive to be built at Brighton Works, but this ultimately did not occur as the railway did not have the funds available.

=== Locomotives ===

Fifteen Class 4 tank engines have been preserved - the most of any BR Standard class. All were built at Brighton Works except 80002, which was constructed at Derby Works.
==In fiction==
Belle, a character from &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, is loosely based on this engine. The difference is that she has water cannons on top of her tanks (for a role as a fictional fire engine) and a large brass bell.

== Models ==
The Hornby Dublo range of 00 gauge model railways produced by Meccano Ltd released a model of the Standard 4 tank in 1954. This was Hornby&#x27;s first entirely new postwar introduction. The model passed to Wrenn, and remained in their range until the 1990s.

<text>Illinois Route 47 (IL 47) is a largely rural north–south state highway that runs from the Wisconsin state border at Highway 120 near Hebron, to IL 10, just south of Interstate 72 (I-72) near Seymour. IL 47 is in primarily rural areas but in several suburbs of Chicago, such as Woodstock and Huntley, traffic can be heavily congested.

IL 47 crosses most interstate highways in northern and central Illinois, but the largest towns that it serves are Woodstock (at US 14), Huntley (at I-90), Lily Lake at (IL 64), Elburn (at IL 38), Sugar Grove (at US 30), Yorkville (at US 34), Morris (at I-80), Dwight (at I-55), Forrest (at US 24), Gibson City (at IL 54), and Mahomet (at I-74).

==Route description==
Illinois 47 overlaps Illinois Route 72 and U.S. Route 20 at Pingree Grove, a village approximately from Chicago; this concurrency is part of a so-called wrong-way concurrency, where one can be driving both “south” on Illinois 72 and “north” on U.S. 20 at the same time. Route 47 also shares concurrencies with Illinois Route 9 and Illinois 54 in Gibson City, U.S. Route 30 in Sugar Grove, U.S. Route 6 in Morris, Historic U.S. Route 66 in Dwight, and U.S. Route 150 in Mahomet.

==History==
The original route ended near where it ends today, however, in 1937, it was extended to Decatur via portions of modern day IL 10 and IL 105. Only eight years later (in 1945) was it shortened back to Monticello (the old route became IL 105). One final change came in 1980 when IL 47 was moved back to its current southern terminus at IL 10 after I-72 was built in the area.

Widenings started occurring further north as early as 2009. A project to reconstruct the road to 4 lanes from Kreutzer Road to Reed Road through Huntley was completed in October 2011, including completing all ramps at the I-90 interchange. IL 47 was widened from I-80 in Morris to Caton Farm Road south of Yorkville as part of the Prairie Parkway study–work was completed in 2015. In 2015, the project to expand the section between IL 71 and Kennedy Road in Yorkville to 4-lanes was completed. The partial interchange with I-88 between Sugar Grove and Elburn was made full with the completion of the missing ramps (using electronic toll collection) in 2019.

==Future==

The Illinois Department of Transportation is proposing to add lanes to several portions of Illinois Route 47, which eventually would make it a 4-lane road from I-80 in Morris to I-88 in Sugar Grove, and from I-90 in Huntley to north of Woodstock.

<text>Biograph Studios was an early film studio and laboratory complex, built in 1912 by the Biograph Company at 807 East 175th Street, in The Bronx, New York City, New York, which was preceded by two locations in Manhattan.

==History==
=== 841 Broadway ===

The first studio of the Biograph Company, formerly American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, was located just south of Union Square on the roof of 841 Broadway at 13th Street in Manhattan, known then as the Hackett Carhart Building and today as the Roosevelt Building. The set-up was similar to Thomas Edison&#x27;s &quot;Black Maria&quot; in West Orange, New Jersey, being mounted on circular tracks to be able to get the best possible sunlight. As of 1988, the foundations of this machinery were still extant.

=== 11 East 14th Street ===
The company moved in 1906 to a brownstone a few blocks away at 11 East 14th Street, where it remained until 1913. The brownstone was torn down in the 1960s. It was at this location that D. W. Griffith began as a director, and quickly became the studio&#x27;s focus. Griffith found and developed for the company stars such as Florence Lawrence, Blanche Sweet, Mary Pickford, the Gish sisters - Lillian and Dorothy, Lionel Barrymore, Henry B. Walthall, Mae Marsh, Mabel Normand, Harry Carey, Owen Moore, Robert Harron and director Mack Sennett. Due to their overwhelming popularity and the fact that their names were not credited, stars like Florence Lawrence and Mary Pickford became known as the &#x27;Biograph Girls,&#x27; before screen credits began to become the norm.

The company used Fort Lee extensively for location shooting.

=== 807 East 175th Street ===

Griffith left Biograph in October 1913, a few months after the company had begun moving its Manhattan operations to new, state-of-the-art facilities at 807 East 175th Street in The Bronx, another borough of New York City. Without Griffith, the studio did not prosper, and the company was dissolved in 1915, and the studio property was leased out to other production companies after Biograph&#x27;s production stopped. The studio facilities and laboratory were acquired by one of Biograph Company&#x27;s creditors, the Empire Trust Company, although some of the Biograph old management continued to manage it. Herbert Yates acquired the Biograph Studio properties and Film laboratory facilities in 1928. Biograph Studio facilities in The Bronx were made a subsidiary of his Consolidated Film Industries.

Some advertising films and a few feature films were made at the studio in the 1930s, including &quot;Midnight&quot; (1934), &quot;Woman in the Dark&quot; (1934), &quot;The Crime of Dr. Crespi&quot; (1935), &quot;Manhattan Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1937), the Yiddish-language folk drama &quot;Tevya&quot; (1939), and the Oscar Micheaux production &quot;The Notorious Elinor Lee&quot; (1940).

However, the studio facilities principal activity in that decade was the production of shorts for Universal, Columbia, and RKO, mostly involving New York-based actors and entertainers. The studio suspended operations in 1939, due partly to curtailment of the activities of independent producers because of World War II and partly to a decline in the commercial film market, according to its general manager. At this time, the remaining Biograph films collection was donated to the film department of the Museum of Modern Art. The Soundies Distributing Corporation filmed at the Biograph Studios in 1944.

&quot;Sprucing up of the Biograph Studio in the Bronx and the entrance of Fritz Mandl, former Austrian munitions tycoon, into the local film production scene last week, gave rise to reports that the long-stalled drive toward Eastern film making was again getting under way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1940/springcleaning-biograph&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Empire Trust later assigned management of the property to one of its own subsidiaries, The Actinograph Corp., which held it until 1948.

=== Gold Medal Studios ===
Martin Poll (on July 21, 1959, sworn in as the Commissioner of Motion Picture Arts, by then Borough President of the Bronx, James J. Lyons&lt;ref name=&quot;aarp/film-bronx&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) restored the Biograph Studio facilities and reopened it in 1956 as the Gold Medal Studios. Gold Medal Studios became the largest film studio in the United States outside of Los Angeles at the time of its 1956 reopening, expanding in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1958/01/22/expansion&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold Medal Studios building at 807 East 175th St &amp; Marion Ave., in The Bronx, New York City, New York was photographed by Bronx Chamber of Commerce in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyheritage/164&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Movies filmed at Gold Medal Studios include Alan Freed″s &quot;Mister Rock and Roll&quot; (1957),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bronxboro/1957-Fall&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Robbins″ &quot;Never Love a Stranger, The Goddess (1958 film),&lt;ref name=&quot;catalog.afi/52568&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Act One (film), That Kind of Woman &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot;, Middle of the Night The Fugitive Kind, &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot;, Girl of the Night, Let&#x27;s Rock, and Pretty Boy Floyd (film).

The 1960 pilot episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show, &quot;Head of the Family&quot;, was filmed at Gold Medal Studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiner/RememberMe&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Waldron/DVDSB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biograph Studios, Inc.===
Martin Poll sold the Gold Medal Studios property in 1961, when it was incorporated into a newer company unrelated to the original Biograph Company, using the name Biograph Studios, Inc. It opened in 1961.

The television series &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;, and &quot;East Side/West Side&quot;, and movies such as &quot;The Incident&quot;, and &quot;John and Mary&quot; were filmed there. The Biograph Studio facilities went dormant again in the 1970s. The studio facilities and laboratory burned down in 1980.

The site is now occupied by a New York City Department of Sanitation garage.

<text>Multiply Records was a subsidiary of British label Telstar Records, that launched in 1993 and went into liquidation in 2004. Its major signings included Sash!, Phats &amp; Small and the Cheeky Girls.

It was the brainchild of Mike Hall, who already worked for the parent company Telstar. Early successes included signing Bassment Jaxx&#x27;s &quot;Flylife&quot;, TJR feat Xavier&#x27;s &quot;Just Gets Better&quot;, one of the garage scene&#x27;s foremost hits, as well as Lil Mo Yin Yang&#x27;s &quot;Reach&quot;, and Junior Vasquez&#x27;s &quot;If Madonna Calls&quot;. As a label, they balanced credible releases with commercial hits, and enjoyed considerable success, as well as providing content for Telstar&#x27;s huge compilation business.

The label had three sub labels – Multiply White (active 1995–1996), Sum Records (active 1996–1998) and MP2 (active in 2001).

In 2014, a number of Multiply releases were released to iTunes and Spotify by Phoenix Music International. Additionally, some releases by other Telstar dance subsidiaries such as Decode and Pukka were digitally released under the Multiply brand.

<text>Al Imran (, ; The Family of Imran) is the third chapter (sūrah) of the Quran with two hundred verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;).

This chapter is named after the family of Imran (Joachim), which includes Imran, Saint Anne (wife of Imran), Mary, and Jesus.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the asbāb al-nuzūl or circumstances of revelation, the chapter is believed to have been either the second or third of the Medinan surahs, as it references both the events of the battles of Badr and Uhud. Almost all of it also belongs to the third Hijri year, though a minority of its verses might have been revealed during the visit of the deputation of the Christian community of Najran at the event of the mubahala, which occurred around the 10th year of the Hijrah.

Meanwhile, Mahdi Rizqullah has compiled the commentary from classical Islamic scholars, that the verse narration about the angels attendance in the battle were also supported by hadiths from hadith collection from Muslim ibn Hajjaj, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and the also from Quranic historiography work by Ibn Kathir. Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani gave commentary of another supportive narration from al-Baihaqi and Ibn Ishaq, through various hadith narration chains about the testimony from several different sahabah. This included the narration of Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib who at that time fought on the side of Qurayshite polytheist, who testified that he has been taken captive on the aftermath of the battle by a horse rider whom he did not recognize at all from Muslims rank.

==3:33 The family of Imran==
The chapter takes its name from the family of Imran mentioned in verse .

According to Christian tradition, Joachim is the husband of Saint Anne and the father of Mary, mother of Jesus. As there is sparse evidence for Joachim being the name for the father of Mary, the Quranic account possibly alludes to the pun of Miriam, the daughter of Amram and sister of Aaron, for whom Muslim tradition believes Mary is named after. It also serves as a common focal point for Jewish and Christian audiences.

According to Iraqi Jewish translator, N.J. Dawood, Although Islamic studies of the beginning of the 20th century tended to note genealogical discrepancies, in more recent Islamic Studies of the 21st century the general consensus is, according to Angelika Neuwirth, Nicolai Sinai and Michael Marx, that the Quran does not make a genealogical error but instead makes use of typology. This is, following Wensinck&#x27;s conclusion, supported by the figurative speech of the Quran and the Islamic tradition:

Similarly, Stowasser concludes that &quot;to confuse Mary the mother of Jesus with Mary the sister of Moses and Aaron in Torah is completely wrong and in contradiction to the sound Hadith and the Qur&#x27;anic text as we have established&quot;. Rather it serves as a pun for the name Miriam, daughter of Amram and the sister of Aaron, venerated for helping to save her brother Moses as an infant. According to Muslim tradition, she serves as the forebearer of that name for Mary, mother of Jesus.

This matter has been explained in the following Hadith:

Ibn Kathir (d.1373) also commented on this in his Quranic exegesis (&quot;tafsir&quot;), recalling the Arab tradition of addressing a person as the brother or sister of their notable ancestor:

<text>The Kerensky–Krasnov uprising was an attempt by Alexander Kerensky to crush the October Revolution and regain power after the Bolsheviks overthrew his government in Petrograd. It took place between .

Following the October Revolution, Kerensky fled Petrograd, which fell to the Bolshevik-controlled Petrograd Soviet and went to Pskov, the headquarters of the Northern Front command. He did not get the support of its commander, General Vladimir Cheremisov, who prevented his attempts to gather units to march on Petrograd, but he did get the support of General Pyotr Krasnov, who advanced on the capital with about 700 Cossacks. In Petrograd, opponents of the October Revolution were preparing a revolt that would coincide with the attack on the city by Kerensky&#x27;s forces.

The Soviets had to improvise the defense of the hills south of the city and wait for the attack of Kerensky&#x27;s troops, who, despite the efforts of the high command, received no reinforcements. The clash in the Pulkovo Heights ended with the withdrawal of the Cossacks after the Junker mutiny, which failed prematurely, and they did not receive the necessary support from other units to force the defences. Talks between the sides ended with Kerensky&#x27;s flight, fearful of being handed over to the Soviets by his own soldiers, effectively ending attempts to restore the overthrown Russian Provisional Government.

== Background ==

Alexander Kerensky, who had left Petrograd during the October Revolution, looked for troops that might come to the capital, but did not find them until he arrived to Pskov, where he arrived around 9 pm on . In the first town with troops near the capital, Gatchina, the soldiers were pro-Bolshevik, and Kerensky narrowly escaped arrest.

In Pskov was the headquarters of the Northern Front under the command of General Cheremisov; there Kerensky came into contact with General Pyotr Krasnov, commander of the 3rd Cavalry Corps, which participated in the Kornilov putsch. Together they gathered a Corps to march over the capital, despite the doubts of his commissar, who was suspicious of the reliability of some troops who were hostile to Kerensky. Krasnov, a monarchist officer, was not a great a supporter of Kerensky, but believed his claim that the majority of the army would support him against the Bolsheviks.

In turn, Cheremisov, whose troops were effectively under Bolshevik control and who had bad relations with Kerensky, had rescinded the orders to help the Provisional Government by sending him to Petrograd. Upon his arrival, I had informed him that he could not guarantee his safety if he remained in the city and that he had to leave immediately. Cheremisov refused to help the former prime minister. The local Military Revolutionary Committee controlled communications and transport and monitored the actions of the commanders. Cheremisov had also obstructed Kerensky&#x27;s communications with the others. commanders of the front and communicated to the high command his appointment as commander-in-chief and the order to stop the march of troops on the capital, both false reports.

== Military operations ==
On the night of , Kerensky was again on the outskirts of the capital with little over six hundred Cossacks — twelve and a half squads of sixty men, forming two regiments of the 1st Don Cossack Division — some cannons, an armored convoy and an armored car. The dispersion of the III Corps and the lack of support for Kerensky among the troops prevented the assembly of larger forces, and only those that were stationed in Ostrov marched towards the capital. Krasnov, however, was confident that his cossack troops would receive reinforcements. The few Cossacks crossed Pskov by train at full speed to avoid clashes with the troops occupying the station and continued towards Gatchina.

The next morning, troops took Gatchina without encountering resistance and prepared to assault the Bolshevik positions while awaiting reinforcements. Various circumstances, however, prevented the arrival of new forces to Kerensky: the neutrality of many officers in the conflict, such as the commander of the Northern Front, General Cheremisov, the refusal of the majority of the army to fight, the growing influence of the Bolsheviks in the troops and the reluctance of railway workers to collaborate in the operation. Cheremisov, with bad relations with Kerensky due to a previous personal offense, had ordered that none troops were sent to the capital the day before, declaring that the army should not mix in politics. Kerensky received only reinforcements from an armored convoy and a regiment from Luga. In Gatchina, only a few officers from the aviation school joined Krasnov&#x27;s Cossacks; contributed a couple of planes and an armored car and dropped leaflets over the capital.
After midnight on , small forces, whose size was exaggerated by the government of Lenin who believed they were much larger, took the Tsarskoye Selo. Here the first fight took place; Krasnov, however, drove out the Red Guards with his light artillery. His advance, however, was slow due to lack of reinforcements, especially infantry. At Tsarskoye Selo, the great garrison — sixteen thousand men — who outnumbered Krasnov&#x27;s forces twenty to one, declared his neutrality in the confrontation. In turn, the Bolshevik Revolutionary Military Committee prepared to defend the capital and sent forward the best troops it had in Petrograd. Red Guards, civilians and sailors joined the garrison units that departed south of the city to mount defenses. The command has been placed in the hands of Colonel Muraviov, to whom Chudnovsky was attached as a commissioner; Trotsky and Pavel Dybenko accompanied them to supervise the operation.

Meanwhile, in Petrograd, ex-ministers Mensheviks encouraged officials to oppose the new Bolshevik government, the &quot;Sovnarkom&quot;, through strikes, and supporters of the old government, coordinated by the Committee for the Salvation of the Homeland and Revolution, controlled by the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR), planned a revolt simultaneously with Kerensky&#x27;s impending attack. The presidency of the dissolved Preparliament called for a revolt against the Lenin government. The chief military commissar of the deposed Provisional Government, Stankevich, left to meet with Kerensky in Gatchina to coordinate the revolt in the city and the advance of Kerensky&#x27;s troops.

After the failure of the junker mutiny in Petrograd, which had to be precipitated when it was discovered, some members of the PSR Central Committee joined Kerensky after fleeing the capital. Krasnov&#x27;s troops made no attempt to help the rebels in the capital. Avram Gots supported the search for infantry to reinforce the Cossacks on their march on the capital, both at the front and in the garrisons around the city, which had thousands of soldiers. At the front, the Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries predominated in the unit committees, but not among the soldiers, who were increasingly close to the Bolsheviks. The army closest to the capital, the 12th, belonging to the Northern Front and with two pro-Bolshevik Latvian divisions selected, elected its council, which turned out to consist of supporters and opponents of the October Revolution; the few units sent to the capital refused to advance beyond Valka. The other two armies on the Northern Front, the 1st and 5th. º, were even more pro-Bolshevik and opposed to Kerensky&#x27;s support. For their part, the Gatchina and Tsarskoye Selo garrisons had declared themselves neutral and did not support the attack by Kerensky to the capital. In the end, various efforts to obtain more troops, either from the front or from the nearby garrisons, proved fruitless.

On , 1917, faced with reports of excesses in the capital after the crushing the revolt of the cadets, tried to advance from the Tsarskoye Selo against the entrenched Bolshevik forces, which were twenty times as numerous. Despite advancing easily against the Red Guards, the Cossacks found themselves in danger of being attacked on their flanks by the marines commanded by Dybenko. The Cossacks were repulsed in the Pulkovo Heights and had to evacuate Tsarskoye Selo and return to Gatchina to avoid being surrounded. The confrontation had been messy and bloody. The forces of Kerensky began to disperse in retreat and some of them fraternized with the Bolsheviks in hopes of returning home. Lack of support had sapped the morale of Kerensky&#x27;s few Cossack troops.

By , the situation had deteriorated to the point that Kerensky was in danger of being arrested by his own men and handed over to the Bolsheviks; the leaders of the Socialist Revolutionary Party forced him to flee dressed as a sailor. Kerensky&#x27;s escape ended hopes of restoring the Provisional Government; after that the opponents of the October Revolution did not try to revive it, but to create a new alternative government to the Bolsheviks. The defeat of Kerensky, together with the Bolshevik victory in the heavy fighting in Moscow, temporarily secured the power of Lenin and his supporters; the capital was temporarily safe from military attack.

In turn, Krasnov was captured, but soon released after promising not to fight the Soviet authorities, a promise he quickly broke by becoming the leader of an anti-Bolshevik movement — the Don Republic.

<text>Somaliland has a multi-party system, with a constitutional limit of three official parties at the national level (determined for a 10-year period at the beginning of each decade based on municipal election results, in which more parties are allowed) as an attempt to avoid political tribalism. A single party often does not have win power alone, so the parties must instead form coalition governments. However, despite some parties having affiliations with political internationals of a particular ideology, politics in Somaliland tend to be more clan-based rather than ideology-based. As such, the programs of parties can fluctuate depending on the issues surrounding the clan(s) that support them.

<doc id="1224250" wikidata="Q1267190" url="?curid=1224250" title="Breakdown voltage">
<text>The breakdown voltage of an insulator is the minimum voltage that causes a portion of an insulator to experience electrical breakdown and become electrically conductive.
For diodes, the breakdown voltage is the minimum reverse voltage that makes the diode conduct appreciably in reverse. Some devices (such as TRIACs) also have a &quot;forward breakdown voltage&quot;.

==Electrical breakdown==

Materials are often classified as conductors or insulators based on their resistivity. A conductor is a substance which contains many mobile charged particles called charge carriers which are free to move about inside the material. An electric field is created across a piece of the material by applying a voltage difference between electrical contacts on different sides of the material. The force of the field causes the charge carriers within the material to move, creating an electric current from the positive contact to the negative contact. For example, in metals one or more of the negatively charged electrons in each atom, called conduction electrons, are free to move about the crystal lattice. An electric field causes a large current to flow, so metals have low resistivity, making them good conductors. In contrast in materials like plastics and ceramics all the electrons are tightly bound to atoms, so under normal conditions there are very few mobile charge carriers in the material. Applying a voltage causes only a very small current to flow, giving the material a very high resistivity, and these are classed as insulators.

However, if a strong enough electric field is applied, all insulators become conductors. If the voltage applied across a piece of insulator is increased, at a certain electric field strength the number of charge carriers in the material suddenly increases enormously and its resistivity drops, causing a strong current to flow through it. This is called electrical breakdown. Breakdown occurs when the electric field becomes strong enough to pull electrons from the molecules of the material, ionizing them. The released electrons are accelerated by the field and strike other atoms, creating more free electrons and ions in a chain reaction, flooding the material with charged particles. This occurs at a characteristic electric field strength in each material, measured in volts per centimeter, called its dielectric strength.

When a voltage is applied across a piece of insulator, the electric field at each point is equal to the gradient of the voltage. The voltage gradient may vary at different points across the object, due to its shape or local variations in composition. Electrical breakdown occurs when the field first exceeds the dielectric strength of the material in some region of the object. Once one area has broken down and become conductive, that area has almost no voltage drop and the full voltage is applied across the remaining length of the insulator, resulting in a higher gradient and electric field, causing additional areas in the insulator to break down. The breakdown quickly spreads in a conductive path through the insulator until it extends from the positive to the negative contact. The voltage at which this occurs is called the &quot;breakdown voltage&quot; of that object. Breakdown voltage varies with the material composition, shape of an object, and the length of material between the electrical contacts.

==Solids==
Breakdown voltage is a characteristic of an insulator that defines the maximum voltage difference that can be applied across the material before the insulator conducts. In solid insulating materials, this usually creates a weakened path within the material by creating permanent molecular or physical changes by the sudden current. Within rarefied gases found in certain types of lamps, breakdown voltage is also sometimes called the &quot;striking voltage&quot;.

The breakdown voltage of a material is not a definite value because it is a form of failure and there is a statistical probability whether the material will fail at a given voltage. When a value is given it is usually the mean breakdown voltage of a large sample. Another term is &quot;withstand voltage&quot;, where the probability of failure at a given voltage is so low it is considered, when designing insulation, that the material will not fail at this voltage.

Two different breakdown voltage measurements of a material are the AC and impulse breakdown voltages. The AC voltage is the line frequency of the mains. The impulse breakdown voltage is simulating lightning strikes, and usually uses a 1.2 microsecond rise for the wave to reach 90% amplitude, then drops back down to 50% amplitude after 50 microseconds.

Two technical standards governing performing these tests are ASTM D1816 and ASTM D3300 published by ASTM.

==Gases and vacuum==

In standard conditions at atmospheric pressure, air serves as an excellent insulator, requiring the application of a significant voltage of 3.0 kV/mm before breaking down (e.g., lightning, or sparking across plates of a capacitor, or the electrodes of a spark plug). Using other gases, this breakdown potential may decrease to an extent that two uninsulated surfaces with different potentials might induce the electrical breakdown of the surrounding gas. This may damage an apparatus, as a breakdown is analogous to a short circuit.

In a gas, the breakdown voltage can be determined by Paschen&#x27;s law.

The breakdown voltage in a partial vacuum is represented as

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the breakdown potential in volts DC, formula_3 and formula_4 are constants that depend on the surrounding gas, formula_5 represents the pressure of the surrounding gas, formula_6 represents the distance in centimetres between the electrodes, and formula_7 represents the Secondary Electron Emission Coefficient.

A detailed derivation, and some background information, is given in the article about Paschen&#x27;s law.

==Diodes and other semiconductors==

Breakdown voltage is a parameter of a diode that defines the largest reverse voltage that can be applied without causing an exponential increase in the leakage current in the diode. Exceeding the breakdown voltage of a diode, per se, is not destructive; although, exceeding its current capacity will be. In fact, Zener diodes are essentially just heavily doped normal diodes that exploit the breakdown voltage of a diode to provide regulation of voltage levels.

Rectifier diodes (semiconductor or tube/valve) may have several voltage ratings, such as the peak inverse voltage (PIV) across the diode, and the maximum RMS input voltage to the rectifier circuit (which will be much less).

Many small-signal transistors need to have any breakdown currents limited to much lower values to avoid excessive heating. To avoid damage to the device, and to limit the effects excessive leakage current may have on the surrounding circuit, the following bipolar transistor maximum ratings are often specified:

; &quot;V&quot;CEO (sometimes written &quot;BV&quot;CEO or &quot;V&quot;(BR)CEO): The maximum voltage between collector and emitter that can be safely applied (and with no more than some specified leakage current, often) when no circuit at the base of the transistor is there to remove collector-base leakage. Typical values: 20 volts to as high as 700 volts; very early Germanium point-contact transistors such as the OC10 had values around 5 volts or less.
; &quot;V&quot;CBO: The maximum collector-to-base voltage, &quot;with emitter open-circuit&quot;. Typical values 25 to 1200 volts. 
; &quot;V&quot;CER: The maximum voltage rating between collector and emitter with some specified resistance (or less) between base and emitter. A more realistic rating for real-world circuits than the open-base or open-emitter scenarios above. 
; &quot;V&quot;EBO: The maximum reverse voltage on the base with respect to the emitter. Typically around 5 volts - more for germanium transistors, less for UHF transistors usually.
; &quot;V&quot;CES: Collector to emitter rating when base is shorted to emitter; equivalent to &quot;V&quot;CER when &quot;R&quot; = 0.
; &quot;V&quot;CEX: Collector to emitter rating when a specific base-emitter voltage is supplied, such as in some high voltage switching scenarios.

Field-effect transistors have similar maximum ratings, the most important one for junction FETs is the gate-drain voltage rating.

Some devices may also have a &quot;maximum rate of change&quot; of voltage specified.

==Electrical apparatus==
Power transformers, circuit breakers, switchgear and other electrical apparatus connected to overhead transmission lines are exposed to transient lightning surge voltages induced on the power circuit. Electrical apparatus will have a &quot;basic lightning impulse level&quot; (BIL) specified. This is the crest value of an impulse waveform with a standardized wave shape, intended to simulate the electrical stress of a lightning surge or a surge induced by circuit switching. The BIL is coordinated with the typical operating voltage of the apparatus. For high-voltage transmission lines, the impulse level is related to the clearance to ground of energized components. As an example, a transmission line rated 138 kV would be designed for a BIL of 650 kV. A higher BIL may be specified than the minimum, where the exposure to lightning is severe.

<doc id="1224252" wikidata="Q133086" url="?curid=1224252" title="Moropus">
<text>Moropus (meaning &quot;slow foot&quot;) is an extinct genus of large perissodactyl mammal in the chalicothere family. They were endemic to North America during the Miocene from ~20.4–13.6 Mya, existing for approximately . &quot;Moropus&quot; belonged to the schizotheriine subfamily of chalicotheres, and has the best fossil record of any member of this group; numbers of individuals, including complete skeletons, have been found. The type species of &quot;Moropus&quot;, &quot;M. distans&quot;, was named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877, alongside two other species, &quot;M. elatus&quot; and &quot;M. senex&quot;. Three more species have been named since. Others have been named, but have either been invalidated for one reason or another, or reclassified to other genera.

Among the largest chalicotheres, some specimens of &quot;Moropus&quot; stood at the shoulder. One specimen had an estimated body mass of . Its dental anatomy was similar to ruminants, suggesting a similar method of cropping vegetation. Retracted nasal bones suggest a long upper lip, and a wide gap between the lower incisors and cheek teeth, called a diastema, would provide room for a long tongue to extend from the mouth at an angle. Together, the upper lip and tongue may have been used to pull down vegetation. Though not as adept at bipedalism as the related &quot;Chalicotherium&quot;, it may nonetheless have reared up on two legs to browse on vegetation, using its claws to hook into the bark of a tree or using them to pull down leaves that would otherwise have been unreachable. &quot;Moropus&quot; may have been sexually dimorphic, with the males being larger than the females. 

== Taxonomy ==

=== Early history ===
The first of the remains currently assigned to &quot;Moropus&quot; was a partial right maxilla (YPM 10030), uncovered at some point prior to 1873. In that year, the specimen was described YPM 10030, initially mistakenly attributed &quot;to Lophiodon&quot;. After its discovery, multiple more complete specimens were discovered in the Miocene strata of the John Day Fossil Beds of Oregon. In 1877, Othniel Charles Marsh formally described the specimens, assigning to them the genus name &quot;Moropus&quot;. The type species of &quot;Moropus&quot;, &quot;M. distans&quot;, was based only on fragments of the hind foot. Two other species, &quot;M. elatus&quot; and &quot;M. senex&quot;, were also described. At first, Marsh believed that &quot;Moropus&quot; belonged to the order Edentata, which historically included any mammal that lacked incisor teeth. Though he noted affinities with the African &quot;Ancylotherium&quot;, he opted to erect a new family, Moropodidae, to exclusively include &quot;Moropus&quot;. In 1908, geologist and palaeontologist Erwin Hinckley Barbour noted that &quot;Moropus&quot; had occasionally been treated as a form intermediate between edendates and ungulates, though affirmed that it was definitely a true ungulate.

In 1913, Olof August Peterson named a new species of &quot;Moropus&quot;, &quot;M. hollandi&quot;, from limb elements recovered in 1901, at first mistakenly assigned to &quot;M. elatus&quot;. In a 1913 monograph on chalicothere taxonomy, &quot;Moropus&quot; in particular, Peterson and William Jacob Holland recognised two additional species, &quot;M. matthewi&quot; and &quot;M. merriami&quot;, and reassigned &quot;Moropus&quot; to Chalicotheriidae.

=== Invalid or reassigned species ===
In 1892, Barbour came into possession of a partial mammal skeleton from the Agate Fossil Beds National Monument. He assigned the specimen to &quot;Moropus&quot;, and named a new species, &quot;M. cooki&quot; (after Harold Cook, who discovered it) based on it. However, Peterson and Holland considered &quot;M. cooki&quot; a junior synonym of &quot;M. elatus&quot;. In 1907, Holland named &quot;M. petersoni&quot;, also from the Agate Fossil Beds, after Peterson. Later, in 1975, Margery Chalifoux Coombs suggested that &quot;M. petersoni&quot; was instead the same taxon as &quot;M. elatus&quot;, and that its differences could be explained through sexual dimorphism . In 1935, Soviet palaeontologist K.K. Flerov named an Asian species of &quot;Moropus&quot;, &quot;M.&quot; &quot;betpakdalensis&quot; from Kazakhstan. This taxon has since been reassigned to a genus of its own, &quot;Borissiakia&quot;. Another purported Asian &quot;Moropus&quot;, &quot;M&quot;.&quot;&quot; &quot;huangheensis&quot;, has also been reassigned to &quot;Borissiakia&quot;.

=== Taxonomy ===
Chalicotheres are part of the order Perissodactyla, which includes modern equines, rhinoceroses, and tapirs, as well as extinct groups like brontotheres. As the early evolution of perissodactyls is still unresolved, their closest relatives among other perissodactyl groups is obscure. They are generally placed as part of the clade Ancylopoda alongside their close relatives Lophiodontidae. Many studies considered them as closer to Ceratomorpha (which includes tapirs and rhinoceroses) than Equoidea. A 2004 cladistic study alternatively recovered Ancylopoda as sister to all modern perissodactyls (which includes Equoidea and Ceratomorpha), with the brontotheres basal to both.

In their 1914 monograph on chalicotheres, Holland and Peterson listed three subfamilies: Moropodinae (&quot;Ancylotherium&quot;, &quot;Moropus&quot;, and &quot;Nestoritherium&quot;), Macrotheriinae (including &quot;Chalicotherium&quot;, &quot;Circotherium&quot;, and &quot;Macrotherium&quot;) and Schizotheriinae (&quot;Pernatherium&quot; and &quot;Schizotherium&quot;). Macrotheriinae was subsequently synonymised with the existing Chalicotheriinae. Palaeontologist Arthur Smith Woodward, in 1925, concurred with the system used by Holland and Peterson, and only altered the placements of a few genera. William Diller Matthew instead split chalicotheres into just two subfamilies, Chalicotheriinae and Eomoropinae. The former was divided into two clades based on whether their teeth were brachydont (short-crowned) or hypsodont (high-crowned): &quot;Moropus&quot; fell into the latter category. In 1935, Edwin H. Colbert retained this system, though divided Chalicotheriinae into the tribes Chalicotheriini and Schizotheriini. Currently, they are both treated as tribes, and eomoropids have been removed from Chalicotheriidae entirely. &quot;Moropus&quot; is currently classified under Schizotheriinae.

==Description==
Some species of &quot;Moropus&quot;, such as &quot;M. elatus&quot;, were among the largest chalicotheres, standing about tall at the shoulder and with a body weight around the size of a large rhinoceros. One &quot;Moropus&quot; specimen has an estimated body mass of . Smaller specimens have been described as being about the size of a tapir.

=== Skull ===
&quot;Moropus&quot;&#x27; skull was fairly small compared to its body. It was narrow, and bore high nasal bones. The snout had a spoon-shaped tip, a characteristic common to selective browsers. It suggests the presence of mobile lips and possibly a long tongue. William Berryman Scott suggested that the tongue may have been used in conjunction with the upper lip to pull down branches. The lower incisors protruded forwards, and the premaxilla is toothless, similar to in modern ruminants. This would have formed a cropping mechanism for processing vegetation. There was a diastema (gap) separating the incisors from the cheek teeth, which would have allowed the tongue to extrude from the mouth. The maxilla was similar to that of modern horses (&quot;Equus&quot;). Some specimens (or species) &quot;Moropus&quot; did not have a sagittal crest, while others did, even as juveniles. 

=== Dentition ===
&quot;Moropus&quot; had incisors only on the lower jaw. The cheek teeth (the premolars and molars) were robust, covered in thick enamel, and strongly rooted. The first upper premolar is absent, like other chalicotheres. The second upper premolar was triangular, with the protocone and tritocone (cusps) having fused into a single structure, mostly comprising the former. The third upper premolar is more quadrate in shape, and has one tubercle rather than two. The fourth upper premolar is slightly larger but otherwise very similar. The lower incisors, of which there were three on each side, are procumbent (protruding), spatulate, and were separated from the cheek teeth by a long diastema. The first upper molar is very enlarged, the second is one-fifth longer, and the third is only slightly larger. All three are roughly the same in terms of overall structure. The second lower premolar is highly reduced. Third is molariform (molar-like), in a similar fashion to the brontothere &quot;Megacerops&quot;. The first lower molar is considerably wider than the fourth lower premolar, though they are otherwise quite similar, with the exception that the hypoconid is more well-developed and the cingulum is less so. The second lower molar is longer, and has a more prominent cingulum. The third lower molar lacks its third lobe, similar to other chalicotheres.

=== Postcranial skeleton ===
&quot;Moropus&quot;&#x27; neck was somewhat like that of a modern horse, albeit considerably stockier. All of &quot;Moropus&quot;&#x27; cervical (neck) vertebrae were somewhat elongated, and the neck was long enough that, when drinking, &quot;Moropus&quot; would have to splay its forelimbs to reach the ground level, as in modern giraffes. This, and the fact that the dorsal musculature of the neck appears to have been stronger than the ventral musculature, suggest that &quot;Moropus&quot; held its neck obliquely upright. As in other chalicotheres, &quot;Moropus&quot; differed from typical ungulates in having large claws, rather than hooves, on the feet. Three large, highly compressed claws were present on each of the front feet, supported inside by fissured bony phalanges. As with all schizotheriines, the articulation of the phalangeal (finger) bones shows that &quot;Moropus&quot; could retract its claws enough to walk smoothly with the front feet in a normal digitigrade stance, lifting the claws by hyperextension. &quot;Moropus&quot; was likely more heavily quadrupedal than &quot;Chalicotherium&quot;. However, while not as extreme as in &quot;Chalicotherium&quot;, &quot;Moropus&quot;&#x27; pelvis still bore some adaptations for bipedal stance, such as a long ischium, and changes in the structure of the hindfoot (i.e. the shortening and widening of the astragalus) to increase its weight-bearing capabilities without sacrificing limb length.

== Palaeobiology ==
=== Feeding and diet ===
The spoon-shaped snout tip of &quot;Moropus&quot; suggests that it was a browser. It was suggested by William Diller Matthew that &quot;Moropus&quot; used its claws to dig for buried plant matter and water sources, though as it did not live in an arid environment, this is unlikely. Russian palaeontologist Alexey Borissiak suggested, based on &quot;Borissiakia&quot; from Kazakhstan, that schizotheriines may have fed bipedally, wedging their front claws into tree bark for support. The middle claw could be driven directly into the bark, while the first and third could be freely moved as necessary. In 1943, Swiss palaeontologist Samuel Schaub suggested that the related &quot;Ancylotherium&quot; used its forelimbs to pull down vegetation, much as in chalicotheriines.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
There has been some debate over whether &quot;Moropus&quot; was sexually dimorphic. The matter was discussed by Olof August Peterson and William Jacob Holland in their monograph, in reference to two different mature size groups that had been noted. The larger one was &quot;M. elatus&quot;, and the other was, at the time, considered &quot;M. petersoni&quot;. Larger individuals possessed small sagittal crests, whereas smaller individuals did not (and instead retained independent supraorbital ridges), though noted this could be due to sexual dimorphism. They supposed that, if they were females, the smaller specimens would have a larger pelvic cavity with larger foramina for blood supply, which is not observed. Based on the relative subtetly of these differences, which did not, to them, indicate sexual dimorphism, the smaller morph was decided to probably be separate, and &quot;Moropus petersoni&quot; was retained as a taxon. However, Margery Chalifoux Coombs suggested that there was, in reality, no reason to assume that sexual dimorphism was absent, and opted to sink &quot;M. petersoni&quot; into &quot;M. elatus&quot;. She suggested that &quot;M. petersoni&quot;, being smaller, may have represented the female of &quot;M. elatus&quot;. Further, she noted that there were cases of possible sexual dimorphism throughout Chalicotheriidae, and that there would be a strong precedent for it.

<text>Louis Del Grande (born March 23, 1943) is a retired American-Canadian actor, comedian, and television writer. He is best known as the co-creator and star of the mystery-comedy CBC Television series &quot;Seeing Things&quot; (1981-87). He won four Gemini Awards for his work on the series, two for Best Actor in a Comedy Series and two for Best Comedy Series.

==Early life==
Del Grande was born and raised in Union City, New Jersey. His father and brother were both institutionalized, while his sister underwent intensive psychiatric treatment. At age 16, Del Grande began acting in New York City, eventually landing a part in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.

==Career==
Del Grande moved to Toronto in 1964, drawn to Canada by the Stratford Festival, and soon found work as a stand-up comedian and comedy writer. In 1975, he was hired as head writer for a new sitcom, &quot;The King of Kensington&quot;, which became a hit in Canada until the end of the decade. He also appeared in the show a handful of times as Fred, a friend of Al Waxman&#x27;s lead character Larry King. Del Grande later became (with Jack Humphries) the show&#x27;s co-producer (a &quot;Fifth Estate&quot; documentary said the two producers ran &quot;Kensington&quot; &quot;with an iron hand&quot;).

After a brief stint in Hollywood, Del Grande returned to Toronto where he created, wrote and produced &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, which aired from 1981 to 1987. Del Grande played a crime-solving clairvoyant tabloid reporter who was separated from his wife Marge (played by Del Grande&#x27;s real-life wife, actress Martha Gibson). The series was popular and won Del Grande four Gemini Awards, two for best actor in a comedy and two for the show itself.

Outside Canada, Del Grande is probably best known as the ConSec scanner in the infamous &quot;head explosion&quot; scene in the David Cronenberg movie &quot;Scanners&quot;. He has also appeared in numerous theatrical and television movies and series, including &quot;Monkeys in the Attic&quot;, &quot;Due South&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and &quot;Goosebumps&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Del Grande is married to Canadian actress Martha Gibson. For many years, the couple resided on Cape Breton Island.

<text>Orvis is an American family-owned retail and mail-order business specializing in fly fishing, hunting and sporting goods. Founded in Manchester, Vermont, in 1856 by Charles F. Orvis to sell fishing tackle, it is the oldest mail-order retailer in the United States.

Orvis operates 40 retail stores and 1 outlet/warehouse locations in the US and 0 retail stores and one outlet store in the UK. Owned by the Perkins family since 1965, the company has changed hands twice and has had five CEOs in its history.

==History==

Charles F. Orvis opened a tackle shop in Manchester, Vermont, in 1856. His 1874 fly reel was described by reel historian Jim Brown as the &quot;benchmark of American reel design,&quot; the first fully modern fly reel.

Prior to the Civil War Orvis was sending out catalogs, which predated more famous ones from Sears, Roebuck by more than 20 years.
Charles&#x27;s daughter, Mary Orvis Marbury, took charge of the Orvis fly department in the 1870s. In 1892, she published an encyclopedic reference book on fly patterns &quot;Favorite Flies and Their Histories&quot;.

Following Charles&#x27;s death in 1915, sons Albert and Robert managed the company until the 1930s, when it essentially collapsed during the Depression. Investors, led by Philadelphia businessman-sportsman Dudley Corkran, purchased Orvis in 1939 for US$4,500 (equal to $ today), and quickly revitalized the business. Corkran hired master bamboo rodbuilder Wes Jordan, who by the late 1940s had developed a Bakelite impregnation process that made Orvis bamboo rods uniquely impervious to weather, rot, and other perennial perils.

After World War II, as fiberglass claimed the fishing rod market, Orvis competed with bamboo rod builders, such as Payne, Gillum, and Garrison, while its fiberglass and graphite rods competed with Shakespeare, Fenwick, and other emerging post-bamboo-era firms. The firm produces high quality flies and fly-tying tools, employing professional tyers like A.K. Best and Tom Rosenbauer to create new versions for sale.

=== Purchase by the Perkins family ===

In 1965 after nine months of negotiations with Corkran, Leigh H. Perkins (27 November 1927 - 7 May 2021) bought Orvis for $400,000, equal to $ today. Perkins had since his youth held an admiration for the company which he purchased using $200,000 in savings and the rest in the form of a loan. At the time the company had 20 employees and $500,000 in annual sales. 
In 1966 Perkins established the Orvis fly-fishing school in Manchester, Vermont, which is thought to have been the first of its kind in the United States. His idea was to both to democratize the world of fly casting and at the same time to expand his customer base. Eventually the company was to establish a total of seven such fishing schools.

Perkins recognized the opportunity to make Orvis synonymous not only with fly fishing but with an entire way of life, and greatly enlarged the product line in the 1980s into gifts and clothing. Described by contemporaries as a genius at mail order, Perkins pioneered the trading of customer mailing lists among his chief competitors, including L.L. Bean, Eddie Bauer and Norm Thompson. Inspired by Perkin’s respect for working dogs, the company introduced the Orvis Dog Nest bed in 1977, which not only launched an entirely new category for the company, but which was the first of its kind sold in the United States.

Under Perkins and Jordan&#x27;s successor as chief rod builder, Howard Steere, Orvis became one of the most innovative manufacturers of high-quality fly rods and reels, especially in the development of graphite fly rods. In 1989, Tom Peters, author of In Search of Excellence, named the Orvis fly rod one of the five best products made in the United States in the 1980s. Historian Kenneth Cameron has written that Perkins&#x27; accomplishment was to &quot;define the look of contemporary fly fishing and the entire social universe in which it fits, no small achievement.&quot;

By the time that Perkins retired in 1992 and turned Orvis over to his sons the company had grown to have annual sales of $90 million and more than 700 employees. Under the leadership of Perkins&#x27; sons, then-CEO Leigh (&quot;Perk&quot;) Perkins, Jr., and Executive Vice Chairman Dave Perkins, Orvis has more fully formalized- and broadened its corporate vision. Whilst Orvis has thrived and revenue has more than tripled under the second generation of Perkins leadership, a long-simmering corporate identity crisis had to be addressed: the company&#x27;s growth had strained Orvis&#x27;s sense of direction - e.g. between 1982 and 2000, Orvis purchased six other firms, most of whose own identities did not mesh well with Orvis and thus put the clarity of the brand at risk. As a result beginning in 2000 a rebranding effort began to focus Orvis as a name synonymous with a distinctive, outdoor style of living.
Simon Perkins, the son of Leigh “Perk” Perkins (former Orvis CEO), and grandson of Leigh H. Perkins took over the company as president in 2020.

Orvis also operates three shooting grounds, featuring a &quot;full-time staff&quot; with a &quot;host of offerings that include sporting clays, upland and waterfowl hunting, and the renowned Orvis Schools.&quot; The three locations are the Hill Country Shooting Grounds in Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania; the Sandanona Shooting Grounds in Millbrook, New York; and the Pursell Farms Shooting Grounds in Sylacuaga, Alabama.

== Conservation programs ==
Orvis&#x27;s conservation activism began with Charles Orvis&#x27;s work in fisheries conservation and management in the late 19th century and has continued since. Leigh Perkins continued with conservationism as a company value, donating to wildlife organizations before such practices were widespread. In 1994 Perkins was recognized for his efforts when he received the Chevron Corporation&#x27;s Chevron Conservation Award for lifetime achievements in conservation.

Since the 1970s, Orvis has annually donated five percent of its pretax profits to conservation projects in cooperation with the Atlantic Salmon Federation, The Nature Conservancy, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Ruffled Grouse Society, and Trout Unlimited among others.

== Employee Respiration ==
In 2020, Orvis announced a series of layoffs and furloughs affecting its workforce. The company cited the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the primary reason for these measures.

In October 2024, Orvis announced a significant restructuring plan aimed at ensuring the company&#x27;s longevity as a family-owned, purpose-driven brand. This plan included laying off 112 employees, representing about 8% of its workforce, closing a limited number of its retail stores, and discontinuing its iconic catalog after 170 years. The affected employees were offered two months of full pay and benefits, additional severance pay, and assistance with health insurance and job transition services.

<text>Henry Byron Warner (born Henry Byron Lickfold; 26 October 1876 – 21 December 1958) was an English film and theatre actor. He was popular during the silent era and played Jesus Christ in &quot;The King of Kings&quot;. In later years, he successfully moved into supporting roles and appeared in numerous films directed by Frank Capra. Warner&#x27;s most recognizable role to modern audiences is Mr. Gower in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, directed by Capra. He appeared in the original 1937 version of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; as Chang, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Early life==
Henry Warner was born in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, England in 1876, and educated at Bedford School. His father, Charles Warner, was an actor, and although Henry initially thought about studying medicine, he eventually performed on the stage. He had an older sister, Grace Warner (1873–1925), who was a stage actress and manager.

==Stage==
Warner&#x27;s stage debut came in &quot;It&#x27;s Never Too Late to Mend&quot; when he was 21. He acted in several plays before coming to the United States for the 1905–1906 season. His Broadway credits include &quot;Silence&quot; (1924), &quot;You and I&quot; (1922), &quot;Danger&quot; (1921), &quot;Sleeping Partners&quot; (1918), &quot;Out There&quot; (1917), and &quot;Blackbirds&quot; (1912).

==Film==
Warner began his film career in silent films in 1914 when he debuted in &quot;The Lost Paradise&quot;. He played lead roles in the silent era and also appeared in numerous Broadway plays. His greatest success was the role of Jesus in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s silent epic &quot;The King of Kings&quot; in 1927. He received good reviews for this role, but with the advent of sound era, he turned toward supporting roles, mostly because of his age. He usually was cast in dignified roles in numerous films of the 1930s and 1940s. He played in the 1930 version of &quot;Liliom&quot; (as the Heavenly Magistrate), in &quot;Five Star Final&quot; (1931, as Michael Townsend), in &quot;Grand Canary&quot; (1934, as Dr. Ismay), and the 1935 version of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; as Gabelle. He portrayed the strict judge in &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936). He appeared in the original 1937 version of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; as Chang, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Among his later films were &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot; (1938), &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), &quot;The Rains Came&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; (1941). In &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), he played an atypical role as the drunken druggist. Occasionally, Warner was seen in sinister roles as in the 1941 film version of &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;, in which he played the ghost of John Hathorne. Also that year, he played the villainous role of Mr. Carrington in &quot;Topper Returns&quot;. He had a cameo in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), directed by Billy Wilder, in which he played himself, playing cards with some other former silent film stars, including Buster Keaton and Anna Q. Nilsson. He had a cameo role in Cecil B DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956). His last film role was an uncredited cameo in &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot; (1958).

==Personal life==
Warner was married twice, first to the former Mrs. F. R. Hamlin, who died in 1913, and from 1915 until 1933 to Marguerite L. &quot;Rita&quot; Stanwood. On 21 December 1958, Warner died in Los Angeles, California, of a heart attack, and is interred in a private vault at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles, California. 

For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Warner has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6600 Hollywood Boulevard.

==History==
The term &quot;Model Parliament&quot; was coined by William Stubbs (1825-1901) and later used also by Frederic William Maitland. The assembly of AD 1295 included members of the clergy and the aristocracy, as well as representatives from the various counties and boroughs. Each county returned two knights, each borough elected two burgesses, and each city provided two citizens. That composition became the model for later parliaments, hence the name.

A similar scheme had been used in summoning Simon de Montfort&#x27;s Parliament in 1265, but it had been called by Simon de Montfort in the midst of the Second Barons&#x27; War against Henry III of England. The same scheme was remarkably adopted by a king who was Henry&#x27;s son and heir although he had quelled Montfort&#x27;s uprising.

Edward I summoned the parliament to meet at Westminster on 13 November 1295. In calling the parliament, Edward proclaimed in his writ of summons that &quot;what touches all, should be approved of all (), and it is also clear that common dangers should be met by measures agreed upon in common&quot;.

Parliament&#x27;s legislative authority was then limited, and its primary role was to levy taxes. Edward&#x27;s paramount goal in summoning the parliament was to raise funds for his wars, specifically the planned campaigns against the French and the Scots for the forthcoming year and countering an insurgency in Wales. That &quot;sound finance&quot; by taxation was a goal of summoning the parliament but was tied into &quot;counsel&quot; to the king and &quot;the element of service&quot; for feudalism.

However, the resulting parliament became a model for a new function as well, the addressing of grievances with the king. &quot;The elected members were far more anxious to establish the second function: to discuss grievances. A kind of quid pro quo was looked for: money for the Scottish campaign of 1296 would be forthcoming if certain grievances were addressed. This consciousness was growing, even if all was still in an embryonic state&quot;. The concept of &quot;Parliament&quot; was in fact such that the division into House of Commons and House of Lords had not yet taken place. The Model Parliament was unicameral and summoned 49 lords to sit with 292 representatives of the Commons.

The Model Parliament created a precedent in which each &quot;successor of a baron&quot; (which includes Lords Spiritual) who had received a writ to the parliament of 1295 &quot;had a legal right to receive a writ&quot;. However, this strictly hereditary right was not recognized formally until 1387.

<text>Wolfgang Thierse (; born 22 October 1943) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He served as the 11th president of the Bundestag from 1998 to 2005.

== Early life and career ==
Thierse was born in Breslau (Wrocław in present-day Poland). He is a Roman Catholic and grew up in East Germany. After his A-levels he first worked as a typesetter in Weimar. Then he studied German language and literature at Humboldt University in Berlin, where he was an active member of the Catholic Student Community. He also became a research assistant in the university&#x27;s Department of Cultural Theory / Aesthetics. In 1975–76 he was employed by the Ministry of Culture of the German Democratic Republic. But when he joined the protests against the expulsion of singer-songwriter and dissident Wolf Biermann from the GDR he lost his job.

From 1977 to 1990 Thierse worked as a research assistant at the Central Institute of the History of Literature in the Academy of Arts and Sciences of the GDR. He was one of the editors of the &quot;Historical Dictionary of Aesthetic Concepts&quot;.

== Early political career ==
Although his father had been a member of the Centre Party in the Weimar Republic and later of the Christian Democratic Union (East Germany), Wolfgang Thierse did not belong to any political party before 1990. That did not mean that he was not interested in politics. His father regularly listened to the West Berlin radio station RIAS, so Wolfgang had a chance to hear speeches from debates in the West German parliament. He was particularly impressed by Carlo Schmid, Herbert Wehner, and later Willy Brandt.

In October 1989, Thierse joined the opposition group New Forum and in January 1990 the Social Democratic Party in the GDR, whose leader he became in June. In August 1990, under Thierse&#x27;s leadership, the East German Social Democratic Party quit the governing coalition, apparently denying the coalition, which was led by Christian Democrats, a ruling majority.

With regard to German reunification Thierse was in favour of a gradual process, but he realized soon that the majority of the population of the GDR wanted to join the West German state as quickly as possible.

When the East German SPD merged with the West German SPD Thierse became the SPD&#x27;s deputy leader, an office he held until 2005. Until 2009 he belonged to the SPD&#x27;s national executive. He also belonged to various party commissions, which dealt with subjects like the party&#x27;s basic values, or the special problems of East Germany. He was elected as a member of the East German parliament in 1990.

== Member of the German Bundestag, 1990–2013 ==
Following the German reunification, Thierse served as member of the Bundestag, the lower house of the parliament of Germany. He was his parliamentary group&#x27;s deputy chairman from 1994 on, under the leadership of its chairman Rudolf Scharping. From 1995 until 1998, he was a member of the committee on the Election of Judges (&quot;Wahlausschuss&quot;), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany.

=== President of the Bundestag, 1998–2005 ===
After the SPD&#x27;s victory in the 1998 general elections, Thierse was elected president of the &quot;Bundestag&quot; on 26 October. That was &quot;a historic date&quot;, as he called it, because it was the first time that a citizen of the former GDR became Germany&#x27;s second highest representative. He had not been a lifelong resistance fighter against the rule of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany nor had he ever identified with that rule, he said, but he represented a large majority of the East German population in that. Journalists call him &quot;the advocate of the East&quot;. He served for two terms until October 2005, when he was succeeded by Norbert Lammert. In addition, he was chairman of the German delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) from 2002 until 2009.

He has never given the impression &quot;to be in the sole possession of truth&quot;. It is most important to him that you &quot;include&quot; your opponents, the &quot;other&quot; person, the &quot;other&quot; opinion. Therefore, it is necessary for speakers to put aside their manuscripts sometimes and to enter into a real dialogue with the speakers before them.

As president of the &quot;Bundestag&quot;, Thierse visited numerous countries. He has always shown a great interest in inter-cultural dialogue. In his speeches he addressed a variety of questions such as the consequences of globalization on the one hand and increasing individualization on the other, or problems of the environment.

Thierse passionately promoted the idea that the &quot;Bundestag&quot; should move to Berlin, thereby underlining the process of reunification. It was highly satisfactory for him when he was able to open its first meeting there in 1999.

In response to the CDU donations scandal in 2000, Thierse imposed a $21 million fine on former Chancellor Helmut Kohl&#x27;s party for accepting illegal financing. At the time, the fine was the largest in the history of the federal republic. Thierse accused Kohl of &quot;intentional violations of political contribution laws and the Constitution over many years.&quot;

Thierse was especially involved in the fight against right-wing extremism. He takes part in discussions, campaigns and demonstrations. He visits neo-Nazi strongholds, particularly in East Germany, and encourages people to stand up for democracy.

In 2002, Thierse demanded the abolition of checks on former Stasi employees.

=== Vice-president of the Bundestag, 2005–2013 ===
After the 2005 elections, Thierse was elected vice president of the Bundestag, serving alongside President Norbert Lammert. He also served on the Committee on Cultural Affairs and Media. In addition, he was a member of the Art Advisory Board of the German Bundestag.

== Recognition ==
Among the honours Thierse received are an honorary doctorate (awarded by the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Münster) and the Federal Cross of Merit.

== Personal life ==
Wolfgang Thierse is married with two children. He lives in Prenzlauer Berg, a north-eastern part of Berlin.

Thierse has published several books, especially about the situation in East Germany. In 2003 a CD was published with Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; read by Thierse. The proceeds were for the &quot;Green Berets&quot;, a charity that helped young Muslims and Christians to rebuild destroyed areas like Bosnia or Afghanistan.

&quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; is another fairy tale read on CD by Wolfgang Thierse. Again the profit is for charity.

== Controversy ==

On 30 December 2012, Thierse caused outrage by an interview in a Berlin paper (&quot;Berliner Morgenpost&quot;), criticizing gentrification tendencies in formerly poor Berlin inner city districts such as Prenzlauer Berg and Kreuzberg. He specifically mentioned so called &quot;Swabians&quot; (German: &quot;Schwaben&quot;) who serve as prototype for wealthy migrants from western Germany who often work in highly paid jobs in the Berlin media and culture industry, as well as government and industry organizations, replacing the original Berlin under-class population. Thierse specifically mentioned the usage of Swabian or more generally South-German terms for food like &quot;Wecken&quot; or &quot;Pflaumendatschis&quot; instead of the Berlin dialect variants for rolls or plum cakes respectively. Furthermore, those Swabians (symbolizing all migrants from the former West Germany) would be attracted by the cultural gems of Berlin and its status as chaotic, poor and sexy metropolis, but after some time in town would like to transform it in another variant of their small wealthy south German towns of origin.

Thierse received strong criticism from prominent Swabians such as Cem Özdemir (chairman of Germany&#x27;s Green Party) and by European Commissioner for Energy Günther Oettinger (CDU, conservative party), as well as by fellow high-ranking SPD party members. Oettinger pointed out that the Berlin state would only be a viable state because of Germany&#x27;s internal rescue fund (&quot;Länderfinanzausgleich&quot;) which is mainly financed by the two German states that comprise parts of the historic region of Swabia, namely Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, and in addition by Hesse. The state of Berlin is by far the main beneficiary of this rescue fund.

Some commentators (inter alia, Germany&#x27;s Stern magazine) even raised accusations against Thierse of discrimination against large parts of the West German population. Germany&#x27;s Federal minister for Economic Cooperation, Dirk Niebel (FDP, liberal party), born and raised in Hamburg but representing a south-western constituency around Heidelberg, called Thierse furiously in a public reaction reported by the news magazine &quot;Focus&quot;, a &quot;pietistischer Zickenbart&quot; (&quot;pietistic bitchy greybeard&quot;).

On 1 January 2013, Thierse re-affirmed his previous statements in the Berlin paper &quot;Tagesspiegel&quot;: He called the public criticism &quot;ridiculous&quot;, mentioned that intra-German migrants should be allowed to use their South German dialects only in their states/regions of origin and furthermore talked about an &quot;Organisierte Schwabenschaft&quot; (roughly &quot;Organized Swabians&quot;) that would have appeared in the nationwide media and that would abuse its influence. In particular this term &quot;Organisierte Schwabenschaft&quot; caused significant outrage, especially in West Germany, since the usage and wording resembled to the usage of similarly sounding racist terms by right-wing extremists against immigrants and religious minorities. According to the weekly &quot;Die Zeit&quot; magazine, Thierse would have de-masked himself as a &quot;babbit&quot; who did serious harm to the gentrification debate by introducing ethnic terms and regional prejudice into the public discussion.

Prominent former TV host and political correspondent Ulrich Kienzle accused Thierse in an emotional personal letter to him of talking nonsense and artificially intensifying a deeply rooted rivalry between South Germans and Prussians that would date back to even before the Battle of Königgrätz where Prussian forces defeated Austria and its South German allies. This victory eventually led to the Prussia-dominated German Empire in 1870–1871.

In an online essay for Der Spiegel, Jan Fleischhauer pointed out that so called &quot;Schwaben-Hass&quot; (discrimination or hatred vs Swabians) would be a politically correct variant of xenophobia for left-wing intellectuals and bohemians used to hide respectively camouflage otherwise totally unacceptable political positions against foreign infiltration or domination by immigrants.

For reconciliatory efforts, Thierse received a &quot;Goldene Narrenschelle&quot;, an order of Carneval from Vereinigung Schwäbisch-Alemannischer Narrenzünfte (VSAN), an umbrella organization of Swabian–Alemannic Fastnacht.

<text>Meremere is a small town in the northern Waikato region in the North Island of New Zealand. It is located on the east bank of the Waikato River, 50 kilometres north of Hamilton and 63 km south of Auckland.

Meremere was the site of fighting in 1863 during the New Zealand Wars, at which time the settlement (then known as Mere Mere) was the site of a Māori defensive outpost.

For a number of years a coal-fired power station operated in Meremere, and much of the workforce lived in the town. The station was the first government-built large scale thermal power station, opening in 1958 and was a notable landmark for travellers along State Highway 1, which runs past the town. An aerial ropeway carried buckets of coal to the station from the Maramarua coal mine. The station closed in 1991 and there were plans during the 1990s to convert the station into a waste to energy plant, using waste from Auckland. These plans, known as the Olivine project, did not eventuate. The site was used as a recycling centre from 2007 to at least 2017.

<doc id="1224309" wikidata="Q1371212" url="?curid=1224309" title="Roland Young">
<text>Roland Young (11 November 1887 – 5 June 1953) was an English-born actor. He began his acting career on the London stage, but later found success in America and received an Academy Award nomination for his role in the film &quot;Topper&quot; (1937).

In 1960, Young was posthumously honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions in the television and motion pictures industries.

==Early life==
Born in London, England, Young was the son of an architect, and early indications were that he would pursue the father&#x27;s career. He was educated at Sherborne School, Sherborne, Dorset and University College London before being accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art where his classmate was Gordon Richards.

==Career==
Young made his first stage appearance in London&#x27;s West End in &quot;Find the Woman&quot; in 1908, and in 1912 he made his Broadway debut in &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot;. He appeared in two comedies written for him by Clare Kummer, &quot;Good Gracious Annabelle!&quot; (1916) and &quot;A Successful Calamity&quot; (1917) before he served with the United States Army during World War I. He returned to New York when the war ended, and married Kummer&#x27;s daughter Majorie in 1921 after they costarred in Kummer&#x27;s &quot;Rollo&#x27;s Wild Oat&quot;. For the next few years, he alternated between New York and London. He made his film debut in the 1922 silent film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, in which he played Watson opposite John Barrymore as Holmes.

He signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and made his talkie debut in &quot;The Unholy Night&quot; (1929), directed by Lionel Barrymore. He was loaned to Warner Bros. to appear in &quot;Her Private Life&quot; (also 1929), with Billie Dove and Fox Film Corporation, winning critical approval for his comedic performance as Jeanette MacDonald&#x27;s husband in &quot;Don&#x27;t Bet on Women&quot; (1931). He was again paired with MacDonald &quot;Annabelle&#x27;s Affairs&quot; (1931), a talkie version of &quot;Good Gracious Annabelle!&quot;. He appeared in Cecil B. de Mille&#x27;s &quot;The Squaw Man&quot;, and played opposite Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in &quot;The Guardsman&quot; (both 1931). He appeared with Evelyn Brent in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;The Pagan Lady&quot; (also 1931) and Pola Negri in RKO&#x27;s &quot;A Woman Commands&quot; (1932). His final film under his MGM contract was &quot;Lovers Courageous&quot; (1932), opposite Robert Montgomery. He had a starring role in a risqué comedy for Fox entitled &quot;Pleasure Cruise&quot; (1933) alongside Genevieve Tobin.

==Freelance performer==
Young began to work as a freelance performer and found himself in constant demand. He appeared with Jeanette MacDonald, Genevieve Tobin and Maurice Chevalier in &quot;One Hour With You&quot; (1932) and with Kay Francis in &quot;Street of Women&quot; (1932). Alexander Korda invited him to return to Britain to make his British film debut in &quot;Wedding Rehearsal&quot; (1932). He returned to Hollywood and appeared in a diverse group of films that included comedies, murder mysteries, and dramas, and also worked on Broadway. Among his films of this period were &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot; (1935), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1935) (playing Uriah Heep), and the H. G. Wells fantasy &quot;The Man Who Could Work Miracles&quot; (1936).

In 1937, he achieved one of the most important successes of his career in &quot;Topper&quot;, as a bank president haunted by the ghosts of his clients, played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett. It was one of the most successful films of the year, and Young was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Topper&#x27;s wife was played by Billie Burke, who wrote in her memoir that Young &quot;was dry and always fun to work with&quot;. They also appeared together in &quot;The Young in Heart&quot; (1938), and both of the &quot;Topper&quot; sequels, &quot;Topper Takes a Trip&quot; (1938) and &quot;Topper Returns&quot; (1941). He continued to play supporting roles in comedies such as &quot;Yes, My Darling Daughter&quot;, with Fay Bainter and Priscilla Lane, but over the next few years the importance of his roles again decreased. He achieved another success as Uncle Willie in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940) with Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart. His last starring role was in the final instalment of the &quot;Topper&quot; series, &quot;Topper Returns&quot; in 1941, with Billie Burke, Joan Blondell and Carole Landis.

==Artwork==
As a visual artist, Young drew caricatures of notables, some of which appeared in &quot;Life&quot; magazine in the early 1920s. In 1925, a collection was published in the form of a limited-edition book, &quot;Actors and Others&quot;.

==Later life and career==
He continued working steadily through the 1940s, playing small roles opposite some of Hollywood&#x27;s leading actresses, such as Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, Paulette Goddard and Greta Garbo in her final film, &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941). In 1945, he began his own radio show and appeared in the film adaption of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;. By the end of the decade his film career had declined, and his final films, including &quot;The Great Lover&quot; (1949), in which he played a murderer opposite Bob Hope, and Fred Astaire&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1950), were not successful.

In the 1950s, Young appeared on several episodic television series, including &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Pulitzer Prize Playhouse&quot; and &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot;.

==Recognition==
Young has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for film at 6523 Hollywood Blvd. and another for television at 6315 Hollywood Blvd. Both were dedicated 8 February 1960.

==Personal life==
Young was married twice, to Marjorie Kummer from 1921 until 1940, and to Patience DuCroz from 1948 until his death at home in New York City at 65 in 1953.

<text>Brigadeführer (, ) was a paramilitary rank of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) that was used between 1932 and 1945. It was mainly known for its use as an SS rank. As an SA rank, it was used after briefly being known as &quot;Untergruppenführer&quot; in late 1929 and 1930.

== History ==
The rank was first created due to an expansion of the SS and assigned to those officers in command of &quot;SS-Brigaden&quot;. In 1933, the &quot;SS-Brigaden&quot; were changed in name to &quot;SS-Abschnitte&quot;; however, the rank of &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; remained the same.

Originally, &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; was considered the second general officer rank of the SS and ranked between &quot;Oberführer&quot; and &quot;Gruppenführer&quot;. This changed with the rise of the Waffen-SS and the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;. In both of those organizations, &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; was the equivalent to a &quot;Generalmajor&quot; and ranked above an &quot;Oberst&quot; in the German Army or police. The rank of &quot;Generalmajor&quot; was the equivalent of brigadier general, a one-star general in the US Army.The insignia for &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; was at first two oak leaves and a silver pip; however, the design was changed to three oak leaves in April 1942 after the creation of the rank &quot;SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot;. &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; in the Waffen-SS or police also wore the shoulder insignia of a &quot;Generalmajor&quot; and were referred to as such after their SS rank (e.g. &quot;SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS und Polizei&quot;).
