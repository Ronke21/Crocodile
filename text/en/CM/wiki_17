<text>Hemispherectomy is a surgery that is performed by a neurosurgeon where an unhealthy hemisphere of the brain is disconnected or removed. There are two types of hemispherectomy. &quot;Functional&quot; &quot;hemispherectomy&quot; refers to when the diseased brain is simply disconnected so that it can no longer send signals to the rest of the brain and body. &quot;Anatomical hemispherectomy&quot; refers to when not only is there disconnection, but also the diseased brain is physically removed from the skull. This surgery is mostly used as a treatment for medically intractable epilepsy, which is the term used when anti-seizure medications are unable to control seizures.

== History ==
The first anatomical hemispherectomy was performed and described in 1928 by Walter Dandy. This was done as an attempt to treat glioma, a brain tumor. The first known anatomical hemispherectomy performed as a treatment for intractable epilepsy was in 1938 by Kenneth McKenzie, a Canadian neurosurgeon. Krynaw, a neurosurgeon from South Africa, was one of the first to perform and report a case series on hemispherectomies in 1950. He performed the surgery on pediatric patients with infantile hemiplegia, specifically as a treatment for their seizures and cognitive impairment. His hemispherectomy technique removed the damaged hemisphere except the thalamus and caudate structures. Krynaw reported good outcomes overall, although there was one post-operative death. Specifically, there was an overall theme of improvement in weakness, spasticity and cognition. Ten out of the twelve patients had seizures prior to the operation and none of the patients had seizures afterwards. Other neurosurgeons began performing hemispherectomies as well, primarily for the treatment of seizures. For the most part, the surgeries would go well initially, but there was a general theme of subsequent deterioration and even death years after the surgery. As a result of the complication risk and the introduction of new anti-seizure medications, the popularity of the procedure began to decline in the 1950s. Oppenheimer and Griffith were one of the first to describe the potential complications, and they reported their findings in 1966, describing superficial hemosiderosis, granular ependymitis and obstructive hydrocephalus. They posited a theoretical solution to this problem, a surgery that is now known as a functional hemispherectomy. Rasmussen was one of the first neurosurgeons to develop and apply a functional hemispherectomy in practice. He initially made modifications to the original hemispherectomy by preserving the least epileptogenic quarter or third of the hemisphere, hoping this would ameliorate the known complications of the original anatomic hemispherectomy. Although this modification seemed to solve this issue, patients undergoing the modified hemispherectomy continued to have seizures, which was problematic. Therefore, he further modified his surgery to functionally sever residual portions of the frontal and parieto-occipital lobes. This surgery, the functional hemispherectomy, has been further modified over the years by several different neurosurgeons, and to this day there is not a consensus as to which exact technique should be used. Hemispherotomy refers to some of the more recently developed approaches to disconnect the epileptic hemisphere while minimizing brain removal and the risk for complications.

== Nomenclature ==
There are two main types of hemispherectomy: Anatomical and Functional.

&quot;Anatomical hemispherectomy&quot; refers to the resection and removal of an entire hemisphere of the brain, which includes all four lobes, with or without the removal of basal ganglia and thalamus.

&quot;Functional hemispherectomy&quot; refers to surgeries that disable the function of one hemisphere, while maintaining its blood supply and without physically removing the entire hemisphere from the skull. Functional hemispherectomies are performed more frequently than anatomical hemispherectomies due to their lower complication rates. However, they do carry a risk of incomplete disconnection, which refers to when the surgeon inadvertently leaves remnants of fibers that continue to connect the hemisphere to the brain and body. These remaining fibers can be problematic, as they may lead to seizure recurrence.

Another term that falls under the hemispherectomy umbrella includes &quot;hemidecortication&quot;, which is the removal of the cortex from one half of the cerebrum, while attempting to preserve the ventricular system by maintaining the surrounding white matter. Hemidecortication was originally developed as a possible strategy to mitigate some of the complications seen with complete anatomical hemispherectomy.

The term &quot;hemispherotomy&quot; refers to a surgery that is akin to a functional hemispherectomy in that it functionally severs the damaged hemisphere from the other and leaves some of the severed hemisphere within the skull, but the difference is that it removes even less tissue from the skull. The term hemispherotomy is now used as an umbrella term to describe the group of modern techniques and procedures that predominate at most contemporary epilepsy centers.

There is no statistically significant difference in seizure-free rates between the four different types of surgeries:  Hemispherotomy, functional hemispherectomy, anatomical hemispherectomy and hemidecortication. The overall rate of seizure freedom is estimated to be 73.4%.  However, hemispherotomy procedures may be associated with a more favorable complication profile.

== Candidates ==
The typical candidates for hemispherectomy are pediatric patients who have intractable epilepsy due to extensive cerebral unilateral hemispheric injuries. In addition, the seizures should ideally be emanating from that same hemisphere. In some situations, a hemispherectomy may still be performed if there are seizures from both hemispheres, as long as the majority come from one side. In order to assess the patient’s epilepsy completely, patients undergo extensive testing, including EEG and MRI. Most patients also undergo other studies including functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetoencephalography (MEG).

Today, hemispherectomy is performed as a treatment for severe and intractable epilepsy, including for young children whose epilepsy has been found to be drug-resistant. The most common underlying etiologies include malformations of cortical development (MCD), perinatal stroke and Rasmussen’s encephalitis. MCD is an umbrella term for a wide variety of developmental brain anomalies, including hemimegalencephaly and cortical dysplasia. Other less common underlying etiologies include hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia epilepsy syndrome and Sturge-Weber syndrome. 

== Procedure ==
Patients often shave the area of the scalp that will be involved with the surgery. Patients undergo general anesthesia and are unconscious for the procedure. The surgical site is sterilized, after which the skin is incised. A substantial portion of the bone is removed, followed by incision of the dura, which is the outer covering of the brain. There are several blood vessels that have connections with both sides of the brain, and these are carefully identified and clipped in such a way that spares the healthy hemisphere. Ultimately, a bundle of fibers that connect both of the cerebral hemispheres, the corpus callosum, is removed which results in the functional separation of one hemisphere from the other. Portions of the cerebral lobes from the damaged side of the brain are removed, depending on the specific procedure being performed. The surgeon may leave some brain tissue, such as the thalamus or choroid plexus. After completing the resection, the surgical site is irrigated with saline, the brain covering called the dura is sutured back together, the bone that was removed is replaced and the skin is sutured. This surgery often takes four to five hours. Patients often spend a few nights in the hospital post-operatively, and they undergo physical and occupational therapy soon after the surgery.

== Potential complications ==
The most common complication from surgery is hydrocephalus, a condition in which fluid accumulates within the brain, and this is often treated with a shunt to divert the fluid away. The rate of shunts following surgery ranges from 14–23%. Other complications include wound complications, epidural hemorrhages, subdural hemorrhages, intraparenchymal hemorrhages, intracranial abscesses, meningitis, ventriculitis and venous thrombosis. Additional epilepsy surgery following hemispherectomy is rare (4.5%), but may be recommended if there is a residual connection between the two hemispheres that is causing frequent seizures. Mortality rates are low and estimated to be &lt;1% to 2.2%. Most patients do not experience changes in cognition, but some individuals may be at risk. A visual deficit called contralateral homonymous hemianopsia is expected to occur in most patients, where the entire visual field contralateral to the removed hemisphere is lost. There is a risk of motor deficits, and this is variable. Other possible complications include infection, aseptic meningitis, hearing loss, endocrine problems and transient neurologic deficits such as limb weakness.

== Outcomes ==
Since seizures are the most common indication for hemispherectomy surgery, most research on hemispherectomy analyzes how the surgery affects seizures. Many patients undergoing surgery obtain good surgical outcomes, some obtaining complete seizure freedom (54–90%) and others having some degree of improvement in seizure burden. A recently developed scoring system has been proposed to help predict the probability of seizure freedom with more accuracy:  HOPS (Hemispherectomy Outcome Prediction Scale). Although it cannot definitively predict surgical outcome with exact precision, some physicians may use it as a guide. The scoring system takes certain variables into consideration including age at seizure onset, history of prior brain surgery, seizure semiology and imaging findings.

There is also data pertaining to how hemispherectomy affects the body in other ways. After surgery, the remaining cerebral hemisphere is often able to take over some cognitive, sensory and motor functions. The degree to which the remaining hemisphere takes on this additional workload often depends on several factors, including the underlying etiology, which hemisphere is removed and the age at which the surgery occurs.

In terms of postoperative motor function, some patients may have improvement or no change of their weaker extremity, and many can walk independently. Most patients postoperatively have minimal to no behavioral problems, satisfactory language skills, good reading capability, and only a minority of patients have a decline in IQ. Predictors of poor outcome may include seizure recurrence and structural abnormalities in the intact hemisphere.

Ultimately, risks and benefits should be weighed on an individual basis and discussed in detail with the neurosurgeon. Many patients have favorable outcomes. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) reports that “about one-fifth of hemispherectomy patients are gainfully employed and even fewer live independently.”

<text>The Upstate, historically known as the Upcountry, is a region of the U.S. state of South Carolina, comprising the northwesternmost area of the state. Although loosely defined among locals, the general definition includes the 10 counties of the commerce-rich I-85 corridor in the northwest corner of South Carolina. This definition coincided with the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, SC Combined Statistical Area, as first defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2015. In 2023, the OMB issued its most updated definition of the CSA that coincides again with the 10-county region.

The region&#x27;s population was 1,487,610 as of 2020. Situated between Atlanta and Charlotte, the Upstate is the geographical center of the Charlanta megaregion. After BMW&#x27;s initial investment, foreign companies, including others from Germany, have a substantial presence in the Upstate; several large corporations have established regional, national, or continental headquarters in the area. Greenville is the largest city in the region; it has a population of 72,227 and an urban-area population of 387,271, and it is the base of most commercial activity. Greer and Spartanburg are next in population.

== Institutions of higher education ==
The following table shows the major institutions of higher education in the Upstate.
In 2008, &quot;U.S. News&quot; ranked Furman as the 37th-best liberal arts college, Wofford College as the 59th-best, and Presbyterian College as the 101st-best. Also, they ranked Clemson University as the 67th-best national university. According to the Bob Jones University, its Museum and Gallery constitutes the largest collection of religious art in the Western Hemisphere.

== Economy ==
The majority of business and commerce in the Upstate takes place in Greenville County. Greenville has the largest concentration of businesses and financial institutions in its downtown area. In fact, the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson MSA was ranked seventh in the nation by site consultants considering the top markets for economic development. Many financial institutions have regional offices located in downtown Greenville. These include Bank of America and the now-defunct Wachovia. Other major industries of commerce in the Upstate include the auto industry, which is concentrated mainly along the corridor between Greenville and Spartanburg around the BMW manufacturing facility in Greer.

The other major industry in the Upstate is the healthcare and pharmaceuticals. Greenville Hospital System and Bon Secours St. Francis Health System are the area&#x27;s largest in the healthcare sector, while the pharmaceutical corporation of Bausch &amp; Lomb has set up regional operations alongside smaller recently developed local companies such as IRIX Manufacturing and Pharmaceutical Associates. The Upstate is also home to a large amount of private-sector and university-based research activity, including R&amp;D facilities for Michelin, Fuji, and GE Vernova and research centers to support the automotive, life sciences, plastics, and photonics industries. Clemson University, BMW, IBM, Microsoft, and Michelin have combined their resources to create Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research, a research park that specializes in the development of automotive technology.

=== Corporations based in or with a major presence in the Upstate ===
These corporations have a major presence in the Upstate: Adidas, Advance America, Bank of America, BMW of North America, Bon Secours St. Francis Health System Bon Secours | Bringing Health Care and Good Help to Those in Need, Bosch North America, Denny&#x27;s Restaurants, Dunlop Sport, Ernst &amp; Young, Fluor Corporation, Freightliner, GE Vernova, Prisma Health , IBM, Kemet Corporation, Liberty Corporation, Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System, Michelin of North America, Microsoft, Milliken &amp; Company, Spartanburg Regional Health System, Spectrum Communications, SunTrust, Ovation Brands, Perrigo Company of South Carolina, Techtronic Industries, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and Verizon.

== Transportation ==

The Upstate is served by two major interstate highways, I-85 and I-26. Other major interstate spurs include I-185, I-385, and I-585. The major airport in the region is Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, located nearly halfway between Greenville and Spartanburg in suburban Greer. Greenville, Spartanburg, Anderson, Clemson, Pickens, Union, and Gaffney each have smaller airfields. Amtrak service along the Crescent Line stops in Spartanburg, Greenville, and Clemson.

== Media ==
The Upstate region is served by three regional newspapers: &quot;The Greenville News&quot;, the (Spartanburg) &quot;Herald-Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Anderson Independent-Mail&quot;, each of which serves its individual city and surrounding area. &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; recently opened expansion newsrooms in Greenville and Spartanburg for coverage of the Upstate, including Clemson.

<text>Ether Shepley (November 2, 1789January 15, 1877) was an American politician.

Shepley, a Democratic-Republican, served in the Maine State House before becoming one of the state&#x27;s U.S. Senators. Shepley resigned from the Senate after two years to become a Justice (and later Chief Justice) of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.

Shepley was born in Groton, Massachusetts. He attended Groton Academy, (now Lawrence Academy at Groton) and in 1814 graduated from Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.

He later studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1814. Shepley began practicing law in Saco, Maine (at the time, Maine was part of Massachusetts.) Shepley became a member of the Massachusetts General Court in 1819; the following year, he was a delegate to the Maine constitutional convention, which drew up the constitution for Maine when it became a state.

From 1821 until 1833, Shepley was the U.S. attorney for the District of Maine. Later Shepley moved to Portland. He was elected as a Jacksonian Democrat to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1833, until his resignation on March 3, 1836.

During Shepley&#x27;s time in Congress, he served as chairman of the Committee on Engrossed Bills (23rd and 24th Congresses).

On October 28, 1836, Shepley became a justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court; in 1848 he was elevated to chief justice. He served on the Court until October 22, 1855 (he was not a candidate for renomination). The following year he was appointed as the sole commissioner to revise the public laws of Maine. Later he resumed practicing law.

Sheply died in Portland and is interred in Evergreen Cemetery in Portland, Maine.

His son was George Foster Shepley.

<text>Nordmøre () is a traditional district in the Norwegian county of Møre og Romsdal. The area comprises the northern third of the county including the municipalities of Kristiansund, Averøy, Tingvoll, Surnadal, Aure, Hustadvika (eastern part), Sunndal, Gjemnes, and Smøla. The only town in Nordmøre is Kristiansund.

Of these municipalities, three are located (mainly) on islands: Kristiansund, Averøy, and Smøla and the rest lie on the coast (including between, adjacent to, or at the end of, fjords): Tingvoll, Surnadal, Aure, Hustadvika, Sunndal, and Gjemnes; no municipalities are completely landlocked. Historically, Rindal Municipality was part of the county and region, but it was transferred to Trøndelag county on 1 January 2019 and Halsa Municipality was part of Nordmøre until 1 January 2020 when it became part of Heim Municipality in Trøndelag.

In the early Viking Age, before Harald Fairhair, Nordmøre was a petty kingdom whose ruler was known as the &quot;Mørejarl&quot; (literally: &quot;Møre-Earl&quot;). Then, Nordmøre also included the municipalities north and west of Orkland Municipality in Trøndelag.

<text>The iMac G4 is an all-in-one personal computer designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from January 2002 to August 2004. The computer is comprised of a hemispheric base that holds the computer components, including the PowerPC G4 processor, with a flatscreen liquid-crystal display (LCD) mounted above. The display is connected to the base via an adjustable arm that allows the monitor to be tilted and swiveled.

Apple&#x27;s previous release, the iMac G3 (1998), was a commercial success for Apple at a time when the company was close to bankruptcy. As component prices fell, Apple began envisioning a replacement based around an LCD instead of the G3&#x27;s bulky cathode-ray tube. The resulting iMac G4 took two years to develop. The new iMac&#x27;s shape was inspired by a sunflower, with Apple&#x27;s design team exploring different ways of attaching the monitor to the base before settling on a single stainless steel arm. The iMac G4 eschewed the colorful translucency of the iMac G3 in favor of opaque white.

The iMac G4 was announced at the Macworld San Francisco trade show on January 7, 2002, and began shipping that month. The model was updated over the years with faster internal components and larger LCDs. The iMac G4 was a critical and commercial success for Apple, selling more than 1.3 million units in its first year and roughly 3.1 million units alongside the eMac in its lifetime. It was succeeded by the iMac G5 in 2004, which replaced the G4&#x27;s bold design language with a more conservative look that would influence later iMac models.

==Overview==
The iMac G4, originally marketed as &quot;the new iMac&quot;, is an all-in-one personal computer. The machine has an integrated, flatscreen, liquid-crystal display (LCD) mounted on an adjustable stainless steel arm. The arm allows the display to tilt the monitor up and down across 35 degrees, swivel the monitor 180 degrees side to side, and raise or lower it by . A clear plastic &quot;halo&quot; frames the display. The diameter hemispherical base that contains the computer components is heavy enough to support the display, with the neck strong enough to support the weight of the entire computer for carrying. The machine is designed for ease of use; the included instructions consist only of six pictures.

The iMac G4 is powered by a PowerPC G4 processor similar to the one in the Power Mac G4, albeit missing 1 MB of L3 cache. The computer has a quiet fan to cool the G4 processor through vents at the top of the base, unlike the iMac G3, which was cooled via convection. The power button, power plug, and all the input/output ports are arranged on the back of the base, while the tray-loading optical drive sits in front, sporting a mirror finish Apple logo. The power supply is also integrated into the base. The machine features three Universal Serial Bus ports, two IEEE 1394 (Firewire) ports, Video Graphics Array (VGA) out, 100 Mbit/s ethernet and 56kbit/s modem connections. After-purchase expansion is limited to additional random access memory or an AirPort wireless networking card; these are added by removing an access plate secured with captive screws on the underside of the base.

The machine was initially sold with the Apple Pro Keyboard and Apple Pro Mouse in white. While the iMac has a built-in speaker, some models shipped with external Apple Pro Speakers, introduced for the &quot;Digital Audio&quot; Power Mac G4. These use a proprietary connector instead of a 3.5mm headphone jack and have a higher output signal. The iMac G4 was the first Mac to boot by default into Mac OS X, although it can also boot into OS 9 to use older software. Pre-installed software included productivity applications (AppleWorks, iPhoto, iMovie, iTunes, iDVD, Quicken, and FaxSTF) internet connectivity services (Earthlink and AOL), the Pangea Software game &quot;Otto Matic,&quot; and &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot;.

==Development==
The iMac G3 released in 1998 and was a major success for Apple; it sparked a 400% rise in the company&#x27;s stock price over the next two years and sold six million units. It helped reverse the company&#x27;s financial fortunes, marked the first major collaboration between returning CEO Steve Jobs and head of design Jony Ive, and was manufactured using new methodologies at Apple that would be applied to their future products. After the iMac&#x27;s release, Apple revamped its product offerings for other consumer segments, including the Power Mac G3 and G4 and the iBook. Apple&#x27;s industrial designers increasingly held more sway, and the engineering department saw significant turnover in the wake of the industrial design group&#x27;s demands. In 2001, the design team moved from a separate building to a new space in company headquarters, offering a larger area to generate ideas, prototype models, and showcase them to Jobs.
Eighteen months after the iMac&#x27;s release, Ive&#x27;s team began considering a redesign that swapped the computer&#x27;s bulky cathode-ray tube screen, around which the computer was designed, with a thin, flat liquid-crystal display (LCD). Ive produced a prototype that attached the computer components behind the screen, similar to his work on the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh. The design came with drawbacks; the hard drive and optical drive would be less performant in a vertical orientation, and the added heat produced by the G4 processor would necessitate a noisy fan that would be positioned close to the user. There would also be no easy way to tilt and swivel the display without moving the entire machine. Jobs hated the design, which he felt lacked purity. &quot;Why have this flat display if you&#x27;re going to glom all this stuff on its back?&quot; he asked. &quot;We should let each element be true to itself.&quot; When Ive visited Jobs&#x27; house to talk over the issue, Jobs suggested basing the computer on a sunflower, which were growing in his garden. The suggestion of a narrative in the design appealed to Ive, who began sketching out designs drawing on the sunflower shape.

The machine took two years to develop. Ive and the design team first tried to attach the screen to the base with a series of vertebrae held together by spring-loaded cables. A clamp on the back of the screen applied tension to the cables and allowed the spine to loosen or stiffen. This design required two hands to grab the screen and release the clamp, and proved difficult for some users to adjust. Ive solicited feedback from design consultancy firm IDEO, who recommended abandoning the spine idea in favor of a more practical design with two rigid arms. Designer Doug Satzger suggested that they did not need the amount of flexibility the two-arm design offered, and after Jobs concurred, the second arm was dropped. The final arm was made of stainless steel with an internal spring that balanced the screen while being free enough to be moved by the touch of a finger. The designers added the plastic halo ringing the screen that offered space for adjustment without touching the display, and minimized the look of a thick bezel around the edges. The computer components of the machine were put in the weighted base, which borrowed work done for the ill-fated Power Mac G4 Cube to cool the machine by using a fan to draw air from the bottom and expelling it out the top.

The iMac&#x27;s final design suggested a sunflower or a desk lamp, and its anthropomorphic features made it, like its processor, feel more friendly and approachable. Jobs was so taken with the design that, in an uncommon move, he listed himself as the primary inventor on one of the design patents for the machine. Whereas the iMac G3 had been made of translucent plastics in a variety of colors, the new iMac was mostly opaque white, following from decisions Jobs had made to make the iPod music player all white. Ive called the color &quot;pure and quiet&quot;, and Jobs felt the color made consumer products feel more premium, rather than disposable.

==Release==

The new iMac was unveiled at the Macworld San Francisco trade show on January 7, 2002. Rumors had predicted a flat-panel iMac since the previous summer, as pundits considered the machine due for a revamp amid declining sales. In the aftermath of the dot-com crash, Apple&#x27;s market share had eroded to just above 4% in the United States, and less worldwide. Analysts had heightened expectations that the new iMac would be able to shore up Apple&#x27;s market position. On stage, Jobs declared the machine &quot;the best thing I think we&#x27;ve ever done [...] it has a rare beauty and grace that is going to last the next decade.&quot; Ive surreptitiously walked the show floor to gauge the public&#x27;s reaction. The floating monitor and arm&#x27;s anthropomorphism and sense of personality was highlighted in product videos and ads.

Apple positioned the computer as the center of its &quot;digital hub&quot; strategy, where the Mac connected multimedia peripherals like the iPod and organized and edited audio and video. Jobs argued that most consumers wanted a better computer than the ones commonly available, and that meant a Mac; the iMac and hub strategy were part of what he saw as a &quot;third phase&quot; of personal computing, where users used computers to produce creative media. The price of an iMac with the ability to burn DVDs was under US$2,000, compared to the $3,500 it had cost two years earlier for the capability on a Power Mac.

Apple stagger-launched the iMac G4. Only the most-expensive 15-inch model was available in January 2002, followed by the cheaper configurations in February and March. Preorders of the iMac in its first week after announcement were the highest of any Apple product since the original. Apple said it received more than 150,000 preorders for the iMac in the first month, and produced more than 5,000 iMacs a day to meet the initial demand. Higher prices for RAM and LCDs caused the company to raise the price on iMac configurations by $100, though existing orders were honored at the original price. A high-end model with a larger display was released in August. This 17-inch iMac offered a widescreen 1440×900 pixel display, more hard drive capacity, better graphics, and was slightly heavier. The other iMacs dropped back to their original prices. Low-end versions of the previous G3 model continued to be sold until 2003 until they were replaced by the eMac. The most expensive configuration of the eMac was cheaper than the entry-level iMac G4.

The next revision to the iMac line came in February 2003; the previous configurations offered were reduced to a single 15- and 17-inch model each. Alongside lower prices, they featured faster processors, optical drives, and faster AirPort Extreme networking and RAM on the 17-inch model. The 17-inch model also added an audio-in jack, the ability to mirror the display to composite video devices via an adapter, and a Bluetooth expansion module for short-range wireless communication with peripherals.

In September 2003, the iMac line was revised, with the 15- and 17-inch models receiving faster processors and graphics at the same prices, and faster USB 2.0 ports replacing the 1.1 versions. The 15-inch model also received the Bluetooth and AirPort Extreme networking support that had previously been exclusive to the larger model. A larger 20-inch monitor option was added in November, featuring the same specs as the 17-inch model. The 20-inch models were heavier and the arm stiffer to support the larger display, which made the monitors harder to manipulate and position.

==Reception==
The iMac G4 was positively received, particularly the flat-screen design that allowed critics to forget the rest of the computer was there. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Rob Pegoraro called the design &quot;staggeringly useful&quot; and found the screen was never in the wrong place. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edward Baig and others liked the desk lamp look, with many comparing it to the Luxo Jr. character that starred in a Pixar short animation. Pegoraro and James Coates compared the computer&#x27;s dome to the character R2-D2. Others found the iMac G4 ungainly, with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s Walter Mossberg and &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot;″s Peter Wilson left with the sense it was always likely to tip over. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;″s Tobey Grumet found the iMac larger than the promotional shots suggested, and that overall it took up nearly as much space as the CRT model it replaced.

Reviewers cited the iMac&#x27;s ease of use as a major positive of the machine, as well as the quality of its built-in software. &quot;The Irish Times&quot;″s Karlin Lillington said the setup of the computer was so simple a child could do it, while Baig cited the &quot;plug and play&quot; nature of hardware and software as the best feature of the computer. The large port selection was also praised, with &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;″s David Zeiler saying they met the needs of home and education consumers who would not care about the computer&#x27;s limited expansion options. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; and &quot;HWM&quot; were among the publications that suggested the machine would entice Windows PC users to switch to Macs, with the prices of comparably-specced iMacs and Windows PCs generally close. Joe Wilcox of &quot;betanews&quot; felt that the iMac and similar all-in-one systems were as expensive but less portable than midrange Windows laptop computers.

Critics noted the performance improvements of the G4 processor. Jason Snell of &quot;Macworld&quot; wrote that compared to the consumer iMac G3, the new iMac was fast enough for demanding users who did not need the expansion options of a Power Mac. Peter Wilson and &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s David Pogue felt that the iMac was a better value than the lower-end Power Macs, and might steal sales away from the latter. In comparison, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Neil McIntosh found the iMac powerful enough but that the Power Macs were much speedier than the on-paper difference suggested. &quot;Macworld&quot; speed tests found that the iMac generally performed worse than equivalent G4 processors in the Power Mac line, while another comparison found that the iMac lagged behind a similarly priced Pentium 4 system in multitasking performance.

Other complaints about the iMac included the placement of the computer&#x27;s ports and power button on the back of the base, since this it made it harder to plug and unplug peripherals. Neil McIntosh called it the machine&#x27;s &quot;Achilles heel&quot;. Baig and &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s Troy Dreier found the external speakers sounded tinny. Other deficiencies noted were the limited options for expansion, color-shifting of the screens when viewed at extreme angles, and small amounts of RAM on the entry-level models. Some reviews complained of hardware glitches and malfunctions. Dreier felt the keyboard and mouse were unappealing and likely to be immediately replaced by users, while Mossberg and &quot;ZDNet&quot; regretted the lack of a wireless option for the mouse and keyboard, which Apple would not offer until 2003.

==Legacy==

The iMac sold 1.3 million units in 2002, making it Apple&#x27;s top-selling product for the year. iMac and eMac models sales during the iMac G4&#x27;s lifespan totaled roughly 3.1 million units. The iMac G4 helped rehabilitate Apple&#x27;s public image after the failure of the G4 Cube, and proved that Apple&#x27;s success with the iMac G3 was not a fluke. Apple enthusiasts have called it one of the best computers Apple has made. The design won a gold International Design Excellence Award in 2002, with Apple winning more awards that year than any other company. Ive won the Designer of the Year award from the Design Museum in 2003 for his work on the iMac and other products. iMac G4 models are held in the permanent collections of museums including the Museum of Modern Art, HomeComputerMuseum, Museums Victoria, and Science Museum Group.

While Jobs had declared the iMac G4 would reshape the look of computers for the next decade, the iMac&#x27;s ergonomic design language would not last three years. The balance of the machine was challenged by larger displays, and the G4 processor&#x27;s successor, the G5, ran much hotter and needed more cooling. &quot;Macworld&quot; called the successor iMac G5 &quot;conservative&quot; compared to the G3 and G4 models, as it traded the exuberant colors or sunflower design of previous iMacs in favor of placing the computer internals behind the display—the same approach Jobs had previously eschewed as inelegant. This design proved to be the template future iMac models would draw upon. The iMac G4 has been adapted by hobbyists to use newer components, including models that updated the internals with Apple&#x27;s custom chips.

<text>Bunyip is a town in Gippsland, Victoria, Australia, 81 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Cardinia local government area. Bunyip recorded a population of 3,131 at the 2021 census.

Its major road connection is via the Princes Highway.

The town is named after a mythical creature, known as the &quot;Bunyip&quot; or &quot;Bunyeep&quot;, which according to legend lived in and around swampy areas. Mention of it is often found in Australian and Aboriginal mythology.

==History==

===Before European settlement===

The Koo-Wee-Rup and Bunyip areas, among others, are considered to be places of importance to many Aboriginal people in Victoria, particularly the Bunurong people of the Kulin nation, the traditional owners of the area, from whom the word &quot;Bunyeep&quot; is derived. They believe the Bunyip is a spiritual being which lives near water and preys on humans who come too near.

===1800-1850===

The Kooweerup Swamp comprised a region of some stretching from Sawtells Inlet on Westernport Bay to the township of Bunyip in the north-east. The marsh like area was formed by the waters of the many rivers which flow down from the surrounding high country and which often created impenetrable swamplands.

The first settlers had great difficulty in cultivating the land because of the dense stands of giant Melaleuca, or tea-tree, large Eucalyptus and Acacia melanoxylon, or blackwood trees, which lay under the surface. In 1827 William Hovell attempted to cross the swamp but found the scrub to be an impenetrable wilderness. He was impressed by the country, and those areas which were workable held some promise for future development.

Europeans with a view to settlement first arrived in the area around 1840 and established the Buneep Run. A report in 1847 by the surveyor and Commissioner of Crown Lands, Charles Tyers, confirmed the earlier findings but no major drainage works were attempted until decades later.

In 1847, a road was surveyed through virgin forest to &quot;Buneep&quot;, as the area was known by its indigenous inhabitants, which enabled travellers to follow a track that led further east into Gippsland. The survey showed a building, &#x27;Andersons&#x27;, at the future site of Bunyip.

===1850-1900===

In December 1857 the &quot;Buneep Run&quot; was surveyed with a view to establishing a village on the Melbourne to Sale Road and Messrs. Connor, Vale and McKinnon purchased most of the allotments in the area. This site was between the Bunyip River and the present Ellis Road (referred to now as Tonimbuk) north-east of the current town. Connor built the old &quot;Buneep Hotel&quot; around 1858 to accommodate coach travellers on the long route, a journey that usually took 36 hours. The names recorded in this era for the old town included &quot;Buneep&quot;, &quot;Burneep Burneep&quot; and &quot;Burra Burneep&quot;. At around the same time and in the same area the transport company Cobb and Co established their own trading post.

In 1859, a new road, later known as the Old Telegraph Road was surveyed in an attempt to avoid the bad conditions of the previous route to Sale. But, in 1860 there were further improvements made for coach traffic with the opening of the Old Sale Road which crossed the Bunyip River to the south of the old Buneep village, which was abandoned around this time.

In 1867 David Connor selected land to build the &quot;Bunyip Hotel&quot; on the west side of the Bunyip River along the new road. The licensee was David Devaney and the hotel had 14 rooms as well as a 25 stall stable.

Located on a low hill some 44 metres above sea-level, a township was established in its final location alongside the Bairnsdale railway line when it arrived in October 1877. By March of the following year the section of the line to Moe was completed. Surrounded partly by swamp as it was, the foundation of the town, and railway line, can be attributed to its relatively elevated position, its prior use as a coach stop and the increasing need to provide transport for farm produce and timber.

Two hotels, the &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Arms&quot; and the &quot;Bunyip&quot; were set up in 1876 while the railway line was under construction and in 1877 the &quot;Railway Family&quot; hotel opened with John O&#x27;Brien as its licensee. The establishment of these hotels was permanent. The Post Office opened around November 1877 and was known as Bunyip R. S. until 1903.

The main outlet for the men looking for work was in the timber industry and local splitters were fully employed having orders to keep them in work for many months. Large eucalyptus trees were selected and were then sawn with a cross cut saw into required lengths. Palings were used for weatherboards, garden fences and roof shingling. Although a number of private attempts were made at drainage works in the 1860s and 70s they were met with little success.

In 1887, in addition to the hotels there was also a general store, three or four dwellings and a state school. It took another year for speculators to arrive in the district looking for land and it was about this time that development, and suitable drainage work started on the large swampy land nearby. By 1900 the town included a large produce, livestock and furniture market, opened by Ernest Witton in 1895. And, as the area was becoming more prosperous, a petition was prepared in April 1899 to ask the Bank of Australasia to establish an agency in Bunyip and to send an officer two days a week.

===1900-1950===

The township of Bunyip grew slowly in its early years, but by the turn of the century there were more businesses than houses, and these served the people in the surrounding agricultural districts as well as the local township.


As the local population grew so did the need for additional services such as churches. St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church at Bunyip South, later renamed Iona was opened in 1900. A new church was constructed in 1940 and blessed by Archbishop Daniel Mannix. Today most parishioners live in the nearby towns, including Bunyip. The current church with its Romanesque Revival architecture and tower is a genuine icon of the district.

In 1902 the foundation of St Thomas&#x27; Anglican Church was laid on the hill above the town. It is notable for its stained glass windows. The Bunyip Parish of St. Thomas&#x27; was originally part of the Gippsland Forest mission in 1879 and early services were held in Kraft&#x27;s Hall. On 15 October 1902, Mrs. W.A. A&#x27;Beckett Snr. of Brighton laid the foundation block for the new church which was designed by architect Frederick L. Klingender. This church was built on land donated by the A&#x27;Beckett family and cost over £377 and the opening was conducted by the Right Rev. Bishop Arthur Pain, the first Bishop of the Diocese on 28 December 1902.

Extensive alterations were made to the church in 1919 due to damage caused by white ants. In 1980 another restoration appeal was launched to rectify structural problems relating to the roof, to reblock the floor and for repainting. Further renovations and extensions were carried out on the vicarage in 1995 and in 1996 a Lady Chapel was established.

Following World War I the Soldiers&#x27; Memorial Stone was erected in 1921 to commemorate those townfolk who had been killed. The names of those who fell in World War II and the Vietnam War were subsequently added.

In October 1924 a large two-storey brick building named Stacey&#x27;s new Railway Hotel, containing 35 rooms was opened. This heritage building situated in the main street still remains today. Two years later enormous bushfires threatened the township and destroyed many properties before large fire breaks were cleared to the north of the town in February, 1926. By the end of 1928 electricity had been extended to the Bunyip township

===1950-2000===

The first hospital stood on land at the top of the hill on High Street, close to the Princes Street intersection. It was burnt down and later replaced by the Shelley Memorial Hospital situated in A&#x27;Beckett Street. This was opened in March 1965 when Dr Paul O&#x27;Hanlon was the town&#x27;s medical officer. It had a small midwifery unit, small emergency area and general ward area. It was later converted into a Community Health Centre then the Hillview Bunyip Aged Care Hostel, before finally being demolished and rebuilt as the Hillview Bunyip Aged Care Centre.

Bunyip in the 1960s and 1970s sported 4 grocery stores, 2 butchers, 3 milk bars, a shoe shop, 2 hotels, a newsagent, chemist, bakery, travelling solicitor, local paper, 2 banks, hairdressers (men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s), a haberdashery shop and an opportunity shop.

===Modern period===

Bunyip never witnessed a boom period, experiencing as it has slow and steady growth over the last 100 plus years. Many descendants of pioneers remain in the district. In the 1970s there was a concerted push by town locals to promote Bunyip and many residents could be seen wearing brightly coloured &#x27;We support Bunyip&#x27; T-shirts.

===Notable events===

Some excerpts from the district newspapers of the time document the growth of the town:

* June 1880, H.A. Lousada, a butcher, visited Bunyip every Tuesday in good weather and twice a week when the weather got warmer.

* June 1907, a new &quot;Lentz&quot; lamp was erected in main street. This caused quite a sensation in the district as it had been years since many residents had seen a street lamp.
* April 1910, a record consignment of 230 cases of apples left Bunyip for shipment to London and Hamburg. Local growers Nash, Pearson and Mitchell supplied the overseas markets.
* 1912, Frederick Daniels started manufacturing soft drinks in Bunyip. His first customer was Mr Kraft of the Gippsland Hotel. Daniels delivered his product himself, either in a horse and cart or pushing a wheelbarrow.
* May 1913, Mr Thomas, a dentist advertised that he was visiting Bunyip and would be consulting at the Gippsland Hotel. Apparently before his arrival the local station master obliged by extracting teeth with his ticket clippers.
* Farmers persisted with growing tobacco but crops were spoilt by mould. A pea factory operated opposite the cemetery for a few years. A violet farm was known to have existed and many years later Bunyip Clothing Factory operated in Longwarry Road.
* February 1930, fire destroyed five shops in Bunyip.
* December 1967. Five members of the Bunyip Football Club; Peter Kay, Michael Breheny, Noel Heatley, Barry Sullivan and Don Smith, perished when their plane crashed at Daly Waters in the Northern Territory. A memorial was established at the Bunyip Recreational Ground in their memory.

The Bunyip shopping precinct consists of a wide variety of businesses. These include a post office, chemist, hair dressers, fast food shops, grocery stores, accountants and real estate agents, a bakery, a newsagent, Commonwealth and Bendigo banks, hardware and timber merchants, lawn mower outlet, a veterinarian and one pubs (known locally as the &quot;Bottom Pub&quot; due to its position on the sloping main street). In 2007 the Foodworks franchise came to the town when it opened a large supermarket.

Bunyip has an &quot;opportunity shop&quot;, with proceeds donated to local organisations. Previous businesses have included Westpac Bank, a drapery store (owned and serviced by Mr and Mrs Frederick Mitchell for many years), a real estate store, 2 petrol/garages (BGS Motors &amp; Frank Kinder&#x27;s BP), Pound and Ure&#x27;s Electrical store, a gift shop, shoe shop, Flett&#x27;s general store, cool store on the corner of Hope Street and Railway Avenue and Manson&#x27;s Interstate Haulage.

===Health and lifestyle===

Bunyip has two kindergartens and a play group as well as the &quot;Hillview Bunyip Aged Care Centre&quot; which was renovated and extended in 2011. The towns health needs are catered for by a modern clinic situated opposite the aged care centre.

Bunyip has an Australian Rules football team and includes juniors as well as seniors sections. Known as the &quot;Bunyip Bulldogs&quot;, it was formed in 1902, and currently plays in the Ellinbank &amp; District Football League. Prior to belonging to the Ellinbank League, Bunyip belonged to the West Gippsland League. An affiliated netball club, which also caters for junior and senior members, plays in the same league. The Bunyip and District Soccer Club caters for followers of that game and draws players from the local area.

===Attractions===

Dating from 1900, Bunyip has staged an annual agricultural show with categories for horses, dogs, cats, cookery, art work and many others.

The Bunyip country music festival is held the 1st Sunday of February each year and attracts performers, and audiences from all over Victoria (Australia). As a regular feature the Bunyip Railway Hotel conducts an amateur music night where musicians can perform to a live audience. Bunyip also hosts an electronic dance music festival every September that showcases up and coming DJs from around Australia.

Bunyip has a wildlife sanctuary which is popular with bird watchers. Over fifty different types of birds have been sighted there. It is located north of the town and comprises a reserve of 13 hectares. As it was once part of the Koo Wee Rup Swamp it can often be wet underfoot, particularly during spring time. The sanctuary is home to animals such as frogs, lizards, snakes, panthers, elephants, and water birds and is a rare reserve in this district. For the casual visitor to the area informative signage, brochures, picnic tables and a choice of walking trails have all been created.

===Facilities===
The town has two schools, a State School named Bunyip Primary School, established in 1880 with over 250 enrolments in 2013 and a Catholic school known as &quot;Columba Catholic Primary School&quot; which first opened in March 2001.

Located on Main street, Bunyip are the Bunyip Social Hub, Bunyip Social Hub has moved to the uniting church on Nash road and the Bunyip Hall. Many people of all ages meet here to socialise, attend Butterfly Ballet, Butterfly dance finished in 2022, and attend social events .

The Bunyip railway station, Victoria, situated on the Bairnsdale railway line is in the growth corridor and is serviced by modern V/Line VLocity trains. This station was once an important transportation link for both passengers, seeking to buy train tickets, and for parcel and goods freight. It was staffed seven days a week and operated into the 1990s before being demolished and replaced with a metal passenger shelter. In its heyday, there was a livestock holding paddock to the south which ran alongside a railway siding. Animals were held here before being loaded onto the train bound for the livestock market in Dandenong. Today all that remains are relics of cracked concrete flooring slabs overgrown and hidden by weeds.

The Bunyip Urban Fire Station is organised under the auspices of the Country Fire Authority and is located opposite the Police Station, Pearson Street, Bunyip. Up until the early 1990s the town also had a Rural and Urban Fire Brigade servicing Bunyip, Garfield and the surrounding areas of Iona, Vervale, Garfield North and Tonimbuk, which ceased to operate at that time. Members are voluntary and undergo training procedures on joining and include both male and female.

===Media===

Warragul Radio stations Star FM and 3GG service this region.
The original paper servicing the area was called &quot;The Bunyip and Garfield Express&quot;. This was published for many years before finally succumbing to rising costs and larger papers replacing it. A local newsletter &#x27;Bunyip and District Community News&#x27; now services the district.

===Opera===

Light opera companies that are based in Melbourne occasionally visit Bunyip on a regional tour. The Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Victoria performed Iolanthe at Bunyip Hall, Main St on Saturday evening, 29 April 2017. New addition to the town, Evan Baldan, attended the event and found it “quite agreeable”.

<doc id="1196703" wikidata="Q7858842" url="?curid=1196703" title="Two Black Crows">
<text>The Two Black Crows (also called The Black Crows and Moran and Mack) was a blackface comedy act popular in the 1920s and 1930s. The duo appeared in vaudeville, on Broadway, on radio, comedy records, and in film features and shorts.

==History==
The act was originated by Charles Sellers (1888–1934), who hired actor John Swor as his partner. &quot;Swor &amp; Mack&quot; enjoyed moderate success until Swor left the act. He was replaced by George Moran. The team of Moran and Mack caught on and became major recording stars. &quot;The Two Black Crows&quot; became a weekly radio show in 1928; Moran and Mack also guest-starred on Fred Waring&#x27;s radio show in 1933.

Although Moran and Mack&#x27;s gags were mostly corny and the characters were stereotypical (one practical but naive, the other seemingly slow and lazy yet quick with a quip and a certain skewed logic), the relationship depicted plus their laconic delivery made them one of the most successful of comedy teams.

The team was known for two catchphrases. Moran would remind Mack of some unfortunate event, causing Mack to say, &quot;Why bring up?&quot; Mack frequently would interrupt Moran&#x27;s description of something with a drawling &quot;What that?&quot;

The duo of Moran and Mack appeared in vaudeville with W.C. Fields, on Broadway in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; of 1920 and in &quot;Earl Carroll&#x27;s Vanities&quot; in the mid-1920s. They also appeared in &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot; and &quot;The Greenwich Village Follies&quot;.

At the height of their popularity, after completing their first talking feature film, Moran had a salary dispute with Mack and sued him in 1930. A judge ruled that Mack legally owned the act and could pay whatever salary he wanted. Moran quit.

He was replaced by John Swor&#x27;s brother, Bert Swor, who adopted the name Moran. The second &quot;Moran and Mack&quot; talkie (without George Moran) faltered at the box office, and the team made no further films until 1933, when the low-budget Educational Pictures studio hired them for a feature film and a series of &quot;Two Black Crows&quot; short subjects.

Charles Mack died in an automobile accident on January 11, 1934. This ended the act, although George Moran did try to revive it with other partners.

Moran would later appear in three W. C. Fields films, &quot;The Fatal Glass of Beer&quot;, &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot;, and &quot;The Bank Dick&quot;.

Moran died on August 1, 1949.

==Legacy==
Their catch phrase, &quot;Who wants a worm, anyhow?&quot;, was the punchline to a lengthy dialogue that Moran initiated by telling Mack that, &quot;The early bird catches the worm&quot;. Mack had never heard the expression, so he took it literally, and frustrated Moran by repeatedly asking inane questions about the saying. &quot;Who wants a worm, anyhow?&quot; was the closing statement by the crow in a Warner Bros. cartoon called &quot;The Wacky Worm&quot;, and parts of the routine appeared in other Warner cartoons.

==Jokes==
Typical joke:
:MACK: On our farm, we had a thousand , an&#x27; 999 o&#x27;em laid eggs.
:MORAN: What was wrong with de udder one?
:MACK: Uh, he was de head man.

Once Moran played a blast on his kazoo.

:MACK (annoyed): Boy, even if dat was , I wouldn&#x27;t like it!
:MORAN: I can play on dis!
:MACK: You caint play on dat!

Another gag was:

:MACK: I&#x27;ll meet you down by de pig-pen. You better keep yo hat on so&#x27;s I&#x27;ll know ya!

Even a watermelon joke, the essence of racial stereotyping, took on a certain surrealist air in their hands:
:MACK: Wish I had an ice-cold .
:MORAN: Oh lawdy. Me too.
:MACK: Wish I had a thousand ice-cold .
:MORAN: Glory be. I bet if you had a thousand ice-cold , you&#x27;d give me one.
:MACK: No, no siree! If you are too lazy to wish for your own , you ain&#x27;t gon&#x27; git none o&#x27; mine.

<text>The iMac G3, originally released as the iMac, is a series of Macintosh personal computers that Apple Computer sold from 1998 to 2003. The iMac was Apple&#x27;s first major product release under CEO Steve Jobs following his return to the financially troubled company he co-founded. Jobs reorganized the company and simplified the product line. The iMac was designed as Apple&#x27;s new consumer desktop product—an inexpensive, consumer-oriented computer that would easily connect to the Internet.

The iMac&#x27;s all-in-one design is based around a cathode-ray tube display; the G3 processor, components, and connectivity were all included in a single enclosure. Apple&#x27;s head of design Jony Ive and his team developed a teardrop-shaped, translucent plastic case that was a radical departure from the look of the company&#x27;s previous computers. The company developed new working methods to finish the computer quickly, and new workflows for designing future products. The iMac eschewed legacy technologies like serial ports and floppy disk drives in favor of CD-ROMs and USB ports.

Critical response to the iMac was mixed; journalists said the machine would be good for new computer users but bemoaned the lack of legacy technology, and said the separate mouse and keyboard were uncomfortable. Despite the reviews the iMac was an immediate commercial success, becoming Apple&#x27;s fastest-selling computer, selling more than six million units in its lifetime.

The original model was revised several times, improving the processor speed, the amount of random-access memory, hard drive space, and other capabilities. The iMac is credited with saving Apple from financial ruin, and for turning personal computers from niche, technical products to mass-consumer fashion. Other computers and consumer products appropriated the translucent plastic look, leading to legal action from Apple. The iMac G3 series was succeeded by the iMac G4, and the iMac G3&#x27;s position in education markets was replaced by the eMac.

==Background==

In the late 1990s, Apple Computer was experiencing severe financial difficulties. At the end of 1997, the company was selling 1.8 million Macs per year, in comparison with 4.5 million two years earlier. Apple&#x27;s sales were compromised by licensed Mac systems that undercut and out-performed Apple&#x27;s own products. Apple was unable to compete in the low-cost computer market, and entirely abandoned the sector.

In December 1996, Apple purchased the NeXT computer company, founded by Steve Jobs. As part of the deal, he returned to Apple, the company he had co-founded in 1976 and then been ousted from in 1985. Apple also acquired NeXT&#x27;s operating system NeXTSTEP, which would become the foundation for Apple&#x27;s next-generation operating system Mac OS X. Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor but the company&#x27;s board of directors dismissed CEO Gil Amelio on July 9, 1997, and Jobs replaced him in an interim capacity.

Around the same time, Apple&#x27;s industrial design director Robert Brunner left the company and was succeeded by junior designer Jony Ive, who inherited the award-winning design team. Ive was dispirited with Apple&#x27;s leadership and also considered leaving. At a meeting announcing Jobs&#x27;s appointment as Apple&#x27;s CEO, Jobs told his staff that Apple&#x27;s problems stemmed from its poor products. Ive noted Jobs&#x27;s focus on making industrial design a core part of Apple&#x27;s comeback strategy. Ive and Jobs quickly developed a rapport, and Jobs retained Apple&#x27;s industrial design team under Ive&#x27;s leadership.

Jobs streamlined the company into profitability by cost-cutting, but the company still needed compelling products to boost sales. He planned to reduce Apple&#x27;s extensive and confusing computer offerings to four products: a laptop and desktop model each for professionals and consumers. The planned consumer-oriented desktop computer would become the iMac.

==Design==
Jobs initially wanted the new consumer desktop to be a network computer—a cheap, low-powered terminal without disk drives that would connect to Internet servers. Ive&#x27;s design team was given Jobs&#x27;s specifications for the new product in September 1997: it should be a distinctive, all-in-one computer with a price of about $1,200, much lower than the for current entry-level models. The engineering and design teams had less than one year to deliver a finished product.

The design team tried to discern what objects conveyed the emotions they wanted the computer to evoke. While collaboratively developing sketches, designer Doug Satzger drew an ovoid drawing based on his earlier work on Thomson televisions. Ive and the rest of the team focused on the ovoid design, although Jobs initially rejected the look. Ive defended the design as playful and fun, and persuaded Jobs to accept the idea. Jobs began carrying a foamcore model of the computer around the Apple campus to show it off.

When discussing the idea of a machine that inspired positive emotions, the designers mentioned colorful candy dispensers. Materials tests with solid plastics looked cheap, so they made the case translucent. Translucent hardware design was not new to Apple&#x27;s products; the Power Macintosh 8600, 9600, and Power Macintosh G3 tower computers had translucent green latches, and the LaserWriter 8500, eMate 300, and Studio Display incorporated translucent colored plastics more extensively. Former Apple senior designer Thomas Meyerhoffer described the eMate&#x27;s plastics as a way of making the product accessible and distinctive. To Ive, the translucency &quot;came across as cheeky&quot; but meant the aesthetic design of the internal components would also need to be considered. Inspiration came from translucent items the designers brought to the office; one item was a piece of greenish-blue beach glass. This &quot;Bondi blue&quot; object inspired the color Jobs selected for the first iMac.

Apple&#x27;s design team radically overhauled its processes to meet the tight deadline. In the past, they had sent two-dimensional blueprints or hand-drawn sketches to toolmakers to create molds, a laborious process that could take months. Instead, Apple relied on computer-aided design (CAD) using the three-dimensional (3D) modeling program Alias Wavefront to sculpt designs, and CNC milling machines and primitive 3D printers to create physical mockups. Apple&#x27;s product designers wrote software to allow the Wavefront 3D models to be brought into Unigraphics, a program that was used in aerospace design. This process allowed the engineers to compare 3D models of the computer&#x27;s components with the casing, speeding up the process of finding a workable combination of external and internal elements.

Jobs reconsidered the network computer concept as similar products struggled in the market, and recalibrated the project as a full-featured computer with optical disc storage and hard drives. The finalized iMac&#x27;s components and cathode-ray tube (CRT) display are enclosed within a plastic shell. The computer features translucency throughout, such as the small foot to raise the computer, and the power cord resembling condensation on glass. Port labels and regulatory markings have holographic stickers. The design team added a recessed handle to the back of the computer to make it more personal and approachable for new computer users. The cost of the casing was more than three times that of a typical computer but Ive credited Jobs with intuitively understanding the design aims and not demanding justification for the increased costs. The keyboard and mouse were redesigned with matching translucent plastics and trim for the iMac. Ive was especially proud of the round mouse, which shows the complicated internal components that are partially hidden behind the Apple logo.

Jobs wanted the new computer to be a modern, legacy-free PC without old or proprietary technology. Engineers adapted the Common Hardware Reference Platform specification to speed development. This included standard SO-DIMM RAM of Windows-based PCs, and an Open Firmware read-only memory (ROM). Previous Macintosh computers had complex, machine-specific ROMs but the new computer&#x27;s instructions were loaded from memory, shortening production time. The iMac has no serial ports, Apple Desktop Bus, or floppy disk drive. To replace the removed ports, the iMac has Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports, which were faster and cheaper than Apple Desktop Bus and serial ports but were very new—the standard was not finalized until after the iMac&#x27;s release—and unsupported by any third-party Mac peripheral. Jobs wagered USB would solve the problem of accessory makers abandoning the shrinking Mac market with its special connectors. The iMac does not officially have an expansion slot, but early versions include a &quot;mezzanine slot&quot; intended for internal use but which a few third parties produced expansion cards for, such as video card upgrades and SCSI ports. Early models have an IrDA infrared port that wirelessly connects personal digital assistants and other devices. Jobs was furious the initial iMac model came with a tray-loading CD-ROM drive rather than a more-modern slot-loading drive, and nearly canceled the product launch over it. According to Jon Rubinstein, Jobs had always known about the CD tray. Jobs continued with the launch after he was assured subsequent models would include a slot-loading CD-ROM drive as soon as possible.

In early 1998, representatives from the advertising agency TBWA\Chiat\Day were shown the new computer, codenamed &quot;C1&quot;. Creative director Ken Segall said the agency&#x27;s first impression was that the product might be too shocking to be successful. Jobs was proud to show off Apple&#x27;s work, saying &quot;the back of our computer looks better than the front of [our competitors&#x27;] computers&quot;. Jobs informed Segall the internal name was &quot;MacMan&quot;, contributed by Apple&#x27;s marketing executive Phil Schiller, and solicited a study for a better name. Apple stipulated the name must contain &quot;Mac&quot;, it must evoke easy Internet connectivity, and it must not sound portable or toy-like. TBWA spent a week developing other names; Segall&#x27;s pick was &quot;iMac&quot;; it was short, it said the product was a Macintosh computer, and the &quot;i&quot; prefix suggested the internet. Jobs disliked all of the suggested names and gave the agency another week to generate more possibilities. At the next presentation, Segall once again ended with &quot;iMac&quot;; Jobs said he no longer hated the name but still preferred &quot;MacMan&quot;. Segall thought he had failed, but the next day he learned Jobs had suggested the name to other employees and gotten a positive response. The product was thus named the iMac.

==Release==
Steve Jobs unveiled the iMac on May 6, 1998. The product launch echoed that of the original Macintosh 128K in 1984. It was staged in the same location, the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College. Jobs invited Apple founding members Steve Wozniak, Mike Markkula, and Michael Scott, as well as members of the original Macintosh team. After demonstrating the look of traditional computers, Jobs revealed the iMac from under a tablecloth. The computer displayed &quot;Hello (again)&quot; on its screen, hearkening back to the Macintosh&#x27;s whimsical &quot;Hello&quot; introduction.

Apple began shipping the iMac on August 15, 1998. The computer was supported by a $100 million advertising campaign that stressed the iMac&#x27;s ease of use, internet connectivity, and striking contrast from competitors&#x27; products. Actor Jeff Goldblum narrated television advertisements that rhetorically asked if computer companies had been in &quot;thinking jail&quot; making only beige products. Other promotions included radio giveaways, midnight launch events, and &quot;golden tickets&quot; hidden in select iMacs that could be redeemed for a tour of an Apple factory. To make sure Apple was able to ship as many Macs as possible, operations executive Tim Cook prebooked $100 million in air freight. Apple was able to meet demand while at the same time causing shipping delays for their competitors during the holiday season.

The first release of the iMac G3 had a 233 MHz PowerPC G3 processor, ATI Rage IIc graphics, 4 GB hard drive, a tray-loading CD-ROM drive, two USB ports, networking, an infrared port, built-in stereo speakers, and headphone ports. Its casing was Bondi blue–colored and it shipped with MacOS 8.1. On October 17, the iMac was updated with faster ATI Rage Pro Turbo graphics options and MacOS 8.5. A more substantial revision to the iMac lineup came in January 1999. These new models came in five colors: blueberry, strawberry, tangerine, grape, and lime. They had a 266 MHz processor and a 6 GB hard drive. The infrared port and mezzanine slot were removed.

Apple released a new series of iMacs on October 5, 1999, focused on the emerging digital video (DV) market. The new models were similar in appearance to the previous models but had a slightly smaller enclosure; the steel casing shrouding many of the components in the previous model was removed, the colors were lighter, and the plastics clearer. The tray-loading CD-ROM drive was replaced with a slot-loading drive and a rear door was fitted so users could easily add RAM, and a slot for an AirPort wireless networking card was added. The computer&#x27;s components were cooled fanlessly by convection, with hot air exhausted through vents around the top handle. Three new models were offered, and some colors and features were restricted to certain models. The cheapest model, now at $999, was available in only one color. It shipped with a 350 MHz processor, 64 MB of RAM, a new graphics chipset, and a larger hard drive. The iMac DV came in five colors and shipped with the video-editing software iMovie. It also had a 400 MHz processor, two FireWire ports for high-speed connectivity, a larger hard drive, and DVD-ROM optical drive. The iMac DV Special Edition came in a new color named graphite, and shipped with more RAM and a 13 GB hard drive—the largest capacity in the line-up. The iMac DV models also included a VGA video-out port for mirroring the iMac&#x27;s display on another monitor.

On July 19, 2000, Apple released a new iMac lineup with four configurations in five colors. The base model had no FireWire port or video-out socket, came in an indigo casing, and retailed for $799. It had the same processor and memory as the previous iMac with a larger hard drive. The iMac DV and DV+ models had 400 MHz and 450 MHz processors, respectively, and larger hard drives; and the DV+ model had a DVD-ROM drive. The most expensive model was the iMac DV Special Edition, which had a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB of RAM, a larger hard drive, and an exclusive snow color.

Apple&#x27;s next iMac revision was released on February 22, 2001. The new machines came with CD-RW drives and iTunes software as Apple shifted to digital music consumption. The iMac and iMac Special Edition shipped with 400 to 600 MHz processors and FireWire became standard alongside a faster graphics chipset and larger hard drives. Apple supplemented the existing indigo and graphite colors with two new patterns, &quot;Flower Power&quot; and &quot;Blue Dalmatian&quot;, which were intended as visual representations of music.

A final revision in July 2001 returned to more sedate colors—indigo, graphite, and snow. These models shipped with Mac OS X, 500, 600, or 700 MHz processors, up to 256 MB of RAM, and a 60 GB hard drive on the Special Edition. Following the introduction of the iMac G4 in January 2002, Apple continued selling some G3-based iMac models, with 500 and 600 MHz models in indigo, snow, and graphite. The indigo and graphite models were discontinued first, and the snow model was discontinued in March 2003.

==Reception==
The iMac G3 received mixed reviews on release. Tech reviewers were often negative about the machine. Hiawatha Bray said the choices Jobs had made with the iMac doomed the product. In comparison, &quot;Macworld&quot;″s Andrew Gore said the iMac G3 might be as important as the original Macintosh in shifting the computing paradigm, and that Apple&#x27;s &quot;Think different&quot; marketing campaign was not just empty talk. Reporters including &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s Barbara Kantrowitz and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s David Einstein considered it the first promising step in Apple&#x27;s possible resurgence. 

The look of the iMac was generally praised. Many reviewers compared its curved look to the recently released Volkswagen New Beetle, journalist Rob Morse likened it to a &quot;huggable&quot;, futuristic machine like R2-D2 or a toy from &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. Less-positive reviews compared the iMac to an AMC Gremlin.

Positive reviews highlighted the computer&#x27;s ease of use for setup and operation; According to Morse, the iMac felt &quot;almost human&quot; and approachable for a non-tech consumer. Publications including &quot;CNN&quot; and &quot;PC Week&quot; considered the iMac&#x27;s performance fast, but others felt the machine was underpowered, and &quot;PC World&quot;″s testing showed that the machine generally performed less well than Windows PC competitors. Although reviewers noted that general consumers and new computer buyers would be well-served by the machine, they were less sure that it could fit into an office environment, especially if it was not networked.
Criticism focused on the iMac&#x27;s lack of legacy ports. Bray wrote that the lack of a floppy drive essentially wrote off most potential buyers in favor of &quot;&#x27;elites&#x27; [who will] pay more for less&quot;. Gore considered the loss of the floppy drive acceptable but wished that the CD-ROM module, which was identical to that of the PowerBook notebook, could be swapped. He said the lack of expansion slots limited the computer&#x27;s future potential. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s John Breeden highlighted the lack of SCSI as making the iMac unsuitable for office work. Other reviewers bemoaned the high cost of external replacements for the internal floppy disk drive, low amount of installed memory, and its tinny speakers.

Another major complaint with the iMac was its original mouse and keyboard, which reviewers said were small and difficult to use comfortably, calling them an example of style over substance. The shape of the mouse was derisively compared to a hockey puck, and its reviewers considered the cable too short. The mouse&#x27;s round shape made it difficult for users to discern its correct orientation. The mouse and keyboard were replaced with the Apple Pro Mouse and Apple Pro Keyboard for the 2000-revision iMacs. Other complaints included the lack of software and USB accessories, incompatibility with Microsoft Windows, and price. Later iMac G3 models addressed some of the product&#x27;s perceived shortcomings. As the product line aged, reviews noted the new models offered few advancements over previous versions.

The iMac won several design competitions and awards, including Gold at the 1999 D&amp;AD Design Awards in the UK, and &quot;Object of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Face&quot;. iMac G3 models are held in the collections of museums including the Henry Ford, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Powerhouse Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art.

===Sales===
The iMac G3 was an immediate hit with consumers, with 278,000 units sold in the first six weeks, and 800,000 units after 20 weeks. It was the top-selling desktop computer in US stores the first three months of its release. Nearly half of iMac sales were to first-time computer buyers, and nearly 20 percent were Microsoft Windows users who switched to the Mac. In the quarter the iMac shipped, Macintosh computer sales grew year-on-year for the first time since late 1995, and saw the Mac grow its worldwide market share from 3 to 5 percent. Apple went from losing $878 million in 1997 to making $414 million in 1998, its first profit in three years. The iMac continued to be a strong seller for Apple, with 3.7 million units sold by July 2000, and shipping the five-millionth iMac in April 2001. In announcing the computer&#x27;s successor in January 2002, Jobs said that the iMac had sold 6 million units.

==Legacy==

The iMac G3 became a computing icon. Paul Atkinson wrote that the original Macintosh made a huge impact on computing, but it had not affected the look of computers; for decades, personal computers were defined by unimaginative, beige boxes. The iMac, in contrast, did not affect the way consumers used computers but its design changed the idea of the appearance of computers. Apple defined itself in opposition to its competitors, who rushed to produce computers that followed the iMac&#x27;s design language, adding similar translucent or colored plastic to their designs. The iMac mirrored contemporary design trends in its use of streamlining and curves; one designer said the focus on rounding helped make objects more approachable and personal.

Apple protected the distinctive iMac design with legal action against competing computer makers who attempted to imitate the iMac, such as eMachines&#x27; eOne. The iMac made computers fashionable rather than utilitarian, and helped popularize USB and hasten the demise of the floppy disk. Following Apple&#x27;s lead, other computer makers focused on &quot;legacy-free&quot; personal computers.

The iMac&#x27;s sales helped buoy Apple while it released a modern operating system and refreshed the rest of the Mac lineup. The computer&#x27;s success positioned the company to focus on emerging digital media trends. It also established a formula of quickly polishing a new Apple product through rapid iterative updates. &quot;Macworld&quot; noted the iMac saved Apple financially and proved Apple could still produce exciting, innovative products. The iMac also served as the public&#x27;s introduction to Jony Ive, making him one of the world&#x27;s most-celebrated designers. The product&#x27;s name influenced many of Apple&#x27;s later products—such as iPod, iLife, and iPhone—and for a time defined Apple&#x27;s consumer-focused product lines. Apple&#x27;s consumer laptop the iBook followed the iMac&#x27;s lead in a lack of legacy technology and use of colorful, translucent plastic. The iMac was so successful in schools Apple created a G4-powered successor named the eMac, initially sold only to the education market.

The design influence of the iMac G3 was not limited to personal computers; by the early 2000s, multicolored, translucent plastic designs had become common among consumer designs, including microwave ovens and George Foreman grills. &quot;USA Today&quot; called the translucence trend &quot;electronics voyeurism&quot;. Apple would follow the bulbous, candy-colored iMac G3 with the flat-panel, white iMac G4 in 2002. Apple&#x27;s desktop lineup remained relatively monochrome in the following years; the 2021 release of Apple silicon-based iMacs were sold in seven colors and were considered to hearken back to the iMac&#x27;s colorful roots.

<text>On Intelligence: How a New Understanding of the Brain will Lead to the Creation of Truly Intelligent Machines is a 2004 book by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee. The book explains Hawkins&#x27; memory-prediction framework theory of the brain and describes some of its consequences.
==The theory==

Hawkins&#x27; basic idea is that the brain is a mechanism to predict the future, specifically, hierarchical regions of the brain predict their future input sequences. Perhaps not always far in the future, but far enough to be of real use to an organism. As such, the brain is a feed forward hierarchical state machine with special properties that enable it to learn.

The state machine actually controls the behavior of the organism. Since it is a feed forward state machine, the machine responds to future events predicted from past data.

The hierarchy is capable of memorizing frequently observed sequences (Cognitive modules) of patterns and developing invariant representations. Higher levels of the cortical hierarchy predict the future on a longer time scale, or over a wider range of sensory input. Lower levels interpret or control limited domains of experience, or sensory or effector systems. Connections from the higher level states predispose some selected transitions in the lower-level state machines.

Hebbian learning is part of the framework, in which the event of learning physically alters neurons and connections, as learning takes place.

Vernon Mountcastle&#x27;s formulation of a cortical column is a basic element in the framework. Hawkins places particular emphasis on the role of the interconnections from peer columns, and the activation of columns as a whole. He strongly implies that a column is the cortex&#x27;s physical representation of a state in a state machine.

As an engineer, any specific failure to find a natural occurrence of some process in his framework does not signal a fault in the memory-prediction framework &quot;per se&quot;, but merely signals that the natural process has performed Hawkins&#x27; functional decomposition in a different, unexpected way, as Hawkins&#x27; motivation is to create intelligent machines. For example, for the purposes of his framework, the nerve impulses can be taken to form a temporal sequence (but phase encoding could be a possible implementation of such a sequence; these details are immaterial for the framework).

==Predictions of the theory of the memory-prediction framework==
His predictions use the visual system as a prototype for some example predictions, such as Predictions 2, 8, 10, and 11. Other predictions cite the auditory system ( Predictions 1, 3, 4, and 7).
*An Appendix of 11 Testable Predictions, beginning on page 237:

=== Enhanced neural activity in anticipation of a sensory event===
1. In all areas of cortex, Hawkins (2004) predicts &quot;we should find &quot;anticipatory cells&quot;&quot;, cells that fire in anticipation of a sensory event.
:Note: As of 2005 mirror neurons have been observed to fire &quot;before&quot; an anticipated event.

=== Spatially specific prediction===
2. In primary sensory cortex, Hawkins predicts, for example, &quot;we should find anticipatory cells in or near V1, at a precise location in the visual field (the scene)&quot;. It has been experimentally determined, for example, after mapping the angular position of some objects in the visual field, there will be a one-to-one correspondence of cells in the scene to the angular positions of those objects. Hawkins predicts that when the features of a visual scene are known in a memory, anticipatory cells should fire &quot;before&quot; the actual objects are seen in the scene.

=== Prediction should stop propagating in the cortical column at layers 2 and 3===
3. In layers 2 and 3, predictive activity (neural firing) should stop propagating at specific cells, corresponding to a specific prediction. Hawkins does not rule out anticipatory cells in layers 4 and 5.

=== &quot;Name cells&quot; at layers 2 and 3 should preferentially connect to layer 6 cells of cortex===
4. Learned sequences of firings comprise a representation of &quot;temporally constant invariants&quot;. Hawkins calls the cells which fire in this sequence &quot;name cells&quot;. Hawkins suggests that these &quot;name cells&quot; are in layer 2, physically adjacent to layer 1. Hawkins does not rule out the existence of layer 3 cells with dendrites in layer 1, which might perform as &quot;name cells&quot;.

=== &quot;Name cells&quot; should remain ON during a learned sequence===
5. By definition, a &quot;temporally constant invariant&quot; will be active during a learned sequence. Hawkins posits that these cells will remain active for the duration of the learned sequence, even if the remainder of the cortical column is shifting state. Since we do not know the encoding of the sequence, we do not yet know the definition of &quot;ON&quot; or &quot;active&quot;; Hawkins suggests that the ON pattern may be as simple as a simultaneous AND (i.e., the name cells simultaneously &quot;light up&quot;) across an array of name cells.
:See Neural ensemble#Encoding for &quot;grandmother neurons&quot; which perform this type of function.

=== &quot;Exception cells&quot; should remain OFF during a learned sequence ===
6. Hawkins&#x27; novel prediction is that certain cells are inhibited during a learned sequence. A class of cells in layers 2 and 3 should NOT fire during a learned sequence, the axons of these &quot;exception cells&quot; should fire &quot;only if a local prediction is failing&quot;. This prevents flooding the brain with the usual sensations, leaving only exceptions for post-processing.

=== &quot;Exception cells&quot; should propagate unanticipated events===
7. If an unusual event occurs (the learned sequence fails), the &quot;exception cells&quot; should fire, propagating up the cortical hierarchy to the hippocampus, the repository of new memories.

=== &quot;Aha! cells&quot; should trigger predictive activity ===
8. Hawkins predicts a cascade of predictions, when recognition occurs, propagating down the cortical column (with each saccade of the eye over a learned scene, for example).

=== Pyramidal cells should detect coincidences of synaptic activity on thin dendrites===
9. Pyramidal cells should be capable of detecting coincident events on thin dendrites, even for a neuron with thousands of synapses. Hawkins posits a temporal window (presuming time-encoded firing) which is necessary for his theory to remain viable.

=== Learned representations move down the cortical hierarchy, with training ===
10. Hawkins posits, for example, that if the inferotemporal (IT) level has learned a sequence, that eventually cells in V4 will also learn the sequence.

===&quot;Name cells&quot; exist in all regions of cortex===
11. Hawkins predicts that &quot;name cells&quot; will be found in all regions of the cortex.

<doc id="1196713" wikidata="Q5028656" url="?curid=1196713" title="Campus Martius Park">
<text>Campus Martius Park ( &quot;&quot;) is a re-established park in Downtown Detroit, Michigan. After the Great Fire of 1805, Campus Martius (from the Latin for &quot;Field of Mars&quot;, where Roman heroes walked) was the focal point of Judge Augustus Woodward&#x27;s plans to rebuild the city. It was named for the principal square in Marietta, Ohio, the first capital of the Northwest Territory.

==Description==
The park is located at the intersection of Woodward Avenue and Michigan Avenue, four blocks south of Grand Circus Park. The original park covered several acres and was a major gathering area for citizens. The park was lost in the 1900s as the city&#x27;s downtown was reconfigured to accommodate increased vehicular traffic. Hart Plaza, along the riverfront, was designed to replace Campus Martius as a point of importance. But as Hart Plaza is a primarily hard-surfaced area, many residents came to lament the lack of true park space in the city&#x27;s downtown area. This led to calls to rebuild Campus Martius, the site of the Civil War-era Michigan Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument, located across from the new Compuware Headquarters.

The park is also where the point of origin of Detroit&#x27;s coordinate system is located. north of this point is Seven Mile Road; north is Eight Mile Road, and so on. The point of origin is marked by a medallion embedded in the stone walkway. It is situated in the western point of the diamond surrounding the Woodward Fountain, just in front of the park&#x27;s concession building.

The new Campus Martius Park was dedicated November 19, 2004 and includes two performance stages, sculptures, public spaces and a seasonal ice skating rink. At , the park is smaller than its predecessor, as a full restoration of the original would have required the demolition of several buildings. However, the city increased the amount of park space in the area by constructing the new Cadillac Square Park, which opened in summer 2007, immediately to the east of Campus Martius. The park&#x27;s skating rink is designed to resemble the Rockefeller Center rink in New York City but is larger in size. Since its opening the rink has been operated by Magic Ice USA, Inc. Campus Martius Park is the home of the annual Motown Winter Blast, an event that has drawn more than 450,000 people to the downtown area every year and it has become the site of the city&#x27;s annual Christmas tree lighting celebration, held the Monday before Thanksgiving. Thousands come to hear Christmas music and countdown to the lighting of the city&#x27;s official Christmas tree and other decorations to mark the start of the holiday season.

==Cadillac Square Park==
Cadillac Square Park is another re-established park in the area. It lies immediately to the east of Campus Martius Park. Until 2001, the area where the park is located was occupied by a bus transfer station constructed in the 1960s. From 1841 until 1891, Cadillac Square was the site of the Detroit Farmer&#x27;s Market. The new park is site of the relocated Bagley Memorial Fountain which previously occupied a spot on Campus Martius.

In January 2008, the city of Detroit announced plans for a new Cadillac Centre, a $150 million mixed-use residential entertainment-retail complex attached to the Cadillac Tower. Designed by architect Anthony Caradonna and patterned after the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the contemporary steel and glass 24-story skyscraper complex to be located on Campus Martius Park, was planned to begin construction in the fall of 2009, but was indefinitely postponed by the city in October of that year when the developers failed to meet key agreements with the city.

The French sport of pétanque is played at Cadillac Square each workday from noon to 1 p.m. The similar Italian sport of bocce is also played there.

<doc id="1196714" wikidata="Q17157100" url="?curid=1196714" title="Memory-prediction framework">
<text>The memory-prediction framework is a theory of brain function created by Jeff Hawkins and described in his 2004 book &quot;On Intelligence&quot;. This theory concerns the role of the mammalian neocortex and its associations with the hippocampi and the thalamus in matching sensory inputs to stored memory patterns and how this process leads to predictions of what will happen in the future.

== Overview ==

The theory is motivated by the observed similarities between the brain structures (especially neocortical tissue) that are used for a wide range of behaviours available to mammals. The theory posits that the remarkably uniform &quot;physical&quot; arrangement of cortical tissue reflects a single principle or algorithm which underlies all cortical information processing. The basic processing principle is hypothesized to be a feedback/recall loop which involves both cortical and extra-cortical participation (the latter from the thalamus and the hippocampi in particular).

== The basic theory: recognition and prediction in bi-directional hierarchies ==

The central concept of the memory-prediction framework is that bottom-up inputs are matched in a hierarchy of recognition, and evoke a series of top-down expectations encoded as potentiations. These expectations interact with the bottom-up signals to both analyse those inputs and generate predictions of subsequent expected inputs. Each hierarchy level remembers frequently observed temporal sequences of input patterns and generates labels or &#x27;names&#x27; for these sequences. When an input sequence matches a memorized sequence at a given level of the hierarchy, a label or &#x27;name&#x27; is propagated up the hierarchy – thus eliminating details at higher levels and enabling them to learn higher-order sequences. This process produces increased invariance at higher levels. Higher levels predict future input by matching partial sequences and projecting their expectations to the lower levels. However, when a mismatch between input and memorized/predicted sequences occurs, a more complete representation propagates upwards. This causes alternative &#x27;interpretations&#x27; to be activated at higher levels, which in turn generates other predictions at lower levels.

Consider, for example, the process of vision. Bottom-up information starts as low-level retinal signals (indicating the presence of simple visual elements and contrasts). At higher levels of the hierarchy, increasingly meaningful information is extracted, regarding the presence of s, regions, motions, etc. Even further up the hierarchy, activity corresponds to the presence of specific objects – and then to behaviours of these objects. Top-down information fills in details about the recognized objects, and also about their expected behaviour as time progresses.

The sensory hierarchy induces a number of differences between the various levels. As one moves up the hierarchy, representations have increased:
* Extent – for example, larger areas of the visual field, or more extensive tactile regions.
* Temporal stability – lower-level entities change quickly, whereas, higher-level percepts tend to be more stable.
* Abstraction – through the process of successive extraction of invariant features, increasingly abstract entities are recognized.

The relationship between sensory and motor processing is an important aspect of the basic theory. It is proposed that the motor areas of the cortex consist of a behavioural hierarchy similar to the sensory hierarchy, with the lowest levels consisting of explicit motor commands to musculature and the highest levels corresponding to abstract prescriptions (e.g. &#x27;resize the browser&#x27;). The sensory and motor hierarchies are tightly coupled, with behaviour giving rise to sensory expectations and sensory perceptions driving motor processes.

Finally, it is important to note that all the memories in the cortical hierarchy have to be learnt – this information is not pre-wired in the brain. Hence, the process of extracting this representation from the flow of inputs and behaviours is theorized as a process that happens continually during cognition.

=== Other terms ===
Hawkins has extensive training as an electrical engineer. Another way to describe the theory (hinted at in his book) is as a learning hierarchy of feed forward stochastic state machines. In this view, the brain is analyzed as an encoding problem, not too dissimilar from future-predicting error-correction codes. The hierarchy is a hierarchy of abstraction, with the higher level machines&#x27; states representing more abstract conditions or events, and these states predisposing lower-level machines to perform certain transitions. The lower level machines model limited domains of experience, or control or interpret sensors or effectors. The whole system actually controls the organism&#x27;s behavior. Since the state machine is &quot;feed forward&quot;, the organism responds to future events predicted from past data. Since it is hierarchical, the system exhibits behavioral flexibility, easily producing new sequences of behavior in response to new sensory data. Since the system learns, the new behavior adapts to changing conditions.

That is, the evolutionary purpose of the brain is to predict the future, in admittedly limited ways, so as to change it.

== Neurophysiological implementation ==

The hierarchies described above are theorized to occur primarily in mammalian neocortex. In particular, neocortex is assumed to consist of a large number of columns (as surmised also by Vernon Benjamin Mountcastle from anatomical and theoretical considerations). Each column is attuned to a particular feature at a given level in a hierarchy. It receives bottom-up inputs from lower levels, and top-down inputs from higher levels. (Other columns at the same level also feed into a given column, and serve mostly to inhibit the activation exclusive representations.) When an input is recognized – that is, acceptable agreement is obtained between the bottom-up and top-down sources – a column generates outputs which in turn propagate to both lower and higher levels.

=== Cortex ===
These processes map well to specific layers within mammalian cortex. (The cortical layers should not be confused with different levels of the processing hierarchy: all the layers in a single column participate as one element in a single hierarchical level). Bottom-up input arrives at layer 4 (L4), whence it propagates to L2 and L3 for recognition of the invariant content. Top-down activation arrives to L2 and L3 via L1 (the mostly axonal layer that distributes activation locally across columns). L2 and L3 compare bottom up and top-down information, and generate either the invariant &#x27;names&#x27; when sufficient match is achieved, or the more variable signals that occur when this fails. These signals are propagated up the hierarchy (via L5) and also down the hierarchy (via L6 and L1).

=== Thalamus ===
To account for storage and recognition of &quot;sequences&quot; of patterns, a combination of two processes is suggested. The nonspecific thalamus acts as a &#x27;delay line&#x27; – that is, L5 activates this brain area, which re-activates L1 after a slight delay. Thus, the output of one column generates L1 activity, which will coincide with the input to a column which is temporally subsequent within a sequence. This time ordering operates in conjunction with the higher-level identification of the sequence, which does not change in time; hence, activation of the sequence representation causes the lower-level components to be predicted one after the other. (Besides this role in sequencing, the thalamus is also active as sensory waystation – these roles apparently involve distinct regions of this anatomically non-uniform structure.)

=== Hippocampus ===
Another anatomically diverse brain structure which is hypothesized to play an important role in hierarchical cognition is the hippocampus. It is well known that damage to both hippocampi impairs the formation of long-term declarative memory; individuals with such damage are unable to form new memories of episodic nature, although they can recall earlier memories without difficulties and can also learn new skills. In the current theory, the hippocampi are thought of as the top level of the cortical hierarchy; they are specialized to retain memories of events that propagate all the way to the top. As such events fit into predictable patterns, they become memorizable at lower levels in the hierarchy. (Such movement of memories down the hierarchy is, incidentally, a general prediction of the theory.) Thus, the hippocampi continually memorize &#x27;unexpected&#x27; events (that is, those not predicted at lower levels); if they are damaged, the entire process of memorization through the hierarchy is compromised.

In 2016 Hawkins hypothesized that cortical columns did not just capture a sensation, but also the relative location of that sensation, in three dimensions rather than two (&quot;situated capture&quot;), in relation to what was around it. &quot;When the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else&quot; —Jeff Hawkins.

== Explanatory successes and predictions ==
The memory-prediction framework explains a number of psychologically salient aspects of cognition. For example, the ability of experts in any field to effortlessly analyze and remember complex problems within their field is a natural consequence of their formation of increasingly refined conceptual hierarchies. Also, the procession from &#x27;perception&#x27; to &#x27;understanding&#x27; is readily understandable as a result of the matching of top-down and bottom-up expectations. Mismatches, in contrast, generate the exquisite ability of biological cognition to detect unexpected perceptions and situations. (Deficiencies in this regard are a common characteristic of current approaches to artificial intelligence.)

Besides these subjectively satisfying explanations, the framework also makes a number of testable predictions. For example, the important role that prediction plays throughout the sensory hierarchies calls for anticipatory neural activity in certain cells throughout sensory cortex. In addition, cells that &#x27;name&#x27; certain invariants should remain active throughout the presence of those invariants, even if the underlying inputs change. The predicted patterns of bottom-up and top-down activity – with former being more complex when expectations are not met – may be detectable, for example by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Although these predictions are not highly specific to the proposed theory, they are sufficiently unambiguous to make verification or rejection of its central tenets possible. See &quot;On Intelligence&quot; for details on the predictions and findings.

== Contribution and limitations ==

By design, the current theory builds on the work of numerous neurobiologists, and it may be argued that most of these ideas have already been proposed by researchers such as Grossberg and Mountcastle. On the other hand, the novel separation of the conceptual mechanism (i.e., bidirectional processing and invariant recognition) from the biological details (i.e., neural layers, columns and structures) lays the foundation for abstract thinking about a wide range of cognitive processes.

The most significant limitation of this theory is its current lack of detail. For example, the concept of invariance plays a crucial role; Hawkins posits &quot;name cells&quot; for at least some of these invariants. (See also Neural ensemble#Encoding for grandmother neurons which perform this type of function, and mirror neurons for a somatosensory system viewpoint.) But it is far from obvious how to develop a mathematically rigorous definition, which will carry the required conceptual load across the domains presented by Hawkins. Similarly, a complete theory will require credible details on both the short-term dynamics and the learning processes that will enable the cortical layers to behave as advertised.

IBM is implementing Hawkins&#x27; model.
== Machine learning models ==

The memory-prediction theory claims a common algorithm is employed by all regions in the neocortex. The theory has given rise to a number of software models aiming to simulate this common algorithm using a hierarchical memory structure. The year in the list below indicates when the model was last updated.

=== Models based on Bayesian networks ===
The following models use belief propagation or belief revision in singly connected Bayesian networks.
* Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a model, a related development platform and source code by Numenta, Inc. (2008).
* HtmLib, an alternative implementation of HTM algorithms by Greg Kochaniak with a number of modifications for improving the recognition accuracy and speed (2008).
* Project Neocortex, an open source project for modeling memory-prediction framework (2008).
** Saulius Garalevicius&#x27; research page, research papers and programs presenting experimental results with a model of the memory-prediction framework, a basis for the Neocortex project (2007).
* a paper describing earlier pre-HTM Bayesian model by the co-founder of Numenta. This is the first model of memory-prediction framework that uses Bayesian networks and all the above models are based on these initial ideas. Matlab source code of this model had been freely available for download for a number of years.

=== Other models ===
* Implementation of MPF, a paper by Saulius Garalevicius describing a method of classification and prediction in a model that stores temporal sequences and employs unsupervised learning (2005).
* M5, a pattern machine for Palm OS that stores pattern sequences and recalls the patterns relevant to its present environment (2007).
* BrainGame, open source predictor class which learns patterns and can be linked to other predictors (2005).

<doc id="1196718" wikidata="Q656135" url="?curid=1196718" title="Shimazu Hisamitsu">
<text>Prince , also known as, was a Japanese samurai of the late Edo period. The younger brother of Shimazu Nariakira, Hisamitsu was the virtual sovereign and strongman of Satsuma Domain while serving as regent for his underage son Tadayoshi, who became the 12th and last of Satsuma Domain. Hisamitsu was instrumental in the efforts of the southern Satsuma, Chōshū, and Tosa clans to bring down the Tokugawa Shogunate. He held the court title of .

==Biography==

Hisamitsu was born in Kagoshima Castle in 1817, the son of Shimazu Narioki, the 10th &quot;daimyō&quot;; Hisamitsu&#x27;s name at birth was Kanenoshin; his mother was Yura, Narioki&#x27;s concubine. He was briefly adopted by the Tanegashima clan as an heir, but was returned to the Shimazu family while still a child. At age eight, he was adopted into the Shigetomi-Shimazu, a branch family of the main Shimazu house. Kanenoshin, now named Matajirō, came of age in 1828, and took the adult name .

At age 22, following his marriage to the daughter of the previous Shigetomi lord, Tadakimi, he inherited family headship. He was supported as a candidate for succession to the main Shimazu house during the . His half-brother Nariakira won the dispute and succeeded their father as lord of Satsuma; however, following Nariakira&#x27;s death in 1858, Tadayuki&#x27;s young son Mochihisa (later known as Tadayoshi) was chosen as the next lord of Satsuma. Tadayuki gained a position of primacy in Satsuma, due to his status as the lord&#x27;s father. He returned to the main Shimazu house in 1861, and it was then that he changed his name to Hisamitsu.

In 1862, Hisamitsu went to Kyoto, and took part in the increasingly Kyoto-centered politics of the 1860s; he was a part of the &quot;kōbu-gattai&quot; political faction. It was during Hisamitsu&#x27;s return from a stay in Edo, when three Englishmen on horseback offended his retainers by refusing to dismount or stand aside. Their failure to observe proper etiquette resulted in some argument, a chase, and one was killed, in what came to be known as the Namamugi Incident. Hisamitsu remained at the core of the &quot;kōbu-gattai&quot; movement in Kyoto, until Satsuma&#x27;s secret alliance with men of Chōshu. He supported the Satsuma domain&#x27;s military actions in the Boshin War, and retired soon after the Meiji Restoration. In the Meiji era, he was given the rank of duke (), the highest of the newly created &quot;kazoku&quot; nobility and which was awarded for his clan&#x27;s participation during the Restoration. After this, the government struggled with the treatment of Hisamitsu, but treated him with the highest class in ordination, honours, and conferrals. 

The government was careful about Hisamitsu, but that too disappeared after the deaths of Saigo and Okubo. It is said that Hisamitsu continued to say until the end, &quot;Saigo was deceived by Okubo.&quot;

===After the Meiji Restoration ===
After the Meiji Restoration, Hisamitsu continued to hold real power in the Satsuma Domain (Kagoshima Domain). In the 4th year of Meiji (1871), the imperial government officials led by Saigo Takamori and Okubo Toshimichi, who held government positions, issued an order to abolish the domains, which angered Hisamitsu in Kagoshima, and set off fireworks for an entire day in protest. In the old daimyo, Hisamitsu was the only one who was dissatisfied with the abolition of the domain. The &quot;conspiracy of Choshu&quot; was also outraged by the setting of the capital.
In September of the same year, the separation family was created Tamagi Shimazu house。

In Meiji 6 (1873), he served as a cabinet adviser to the government. For 7 years, he served as Minister of left and proposed to restore old customs, but he was completely excluded from the government&#x27;s policy decision.

In the 8th year of Meiji (1875), he resigned as Minister of left and lived a secluded life in Kagoshima, concentrating on compiling and collecting the history books handed down by the Shimazu family.

==Death==
Hisamitsu died on December 6, 1887, at age 70. He was accorded a state funeral.

He is buried in Kagoshima Prefecture.

<doc id="1196724" wikidata="Q3117692" url="?curid=1196724" title="O'Nan group">
<text>In the area of abstract algebra known as group theory, the O&#x27;Nan group &quot;O&#x27;N&quot; or O&#x27;Nan–Sims group is a sporadic simple group of order
:   460,815,505,920 = 2934573111931 ≈ 5.

==History==
&quot;O&#x27;N&quot; is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was found by in a study of groups with a Sylow 2-subgroup of &quot;Alperin type&quot;, meaning isomorphic to a Sylow 2-Subgroup of a group of type (Z/2&quot;n&quot;Z ×Z/2&quot;n&quot;Z ×Z/2&quot;n&quot;Z).PSL3(F2). The following simple groups have Sylow 2-subgroups of Alperin type:
* For the Chevalley group &quot;G&quot;2(q), if q is congruent to 3 or 5 mod 8, &quot;n = 1&quot; and the extension does not split.
* For the Steinberg group 3&quot;D&quot;4(q), if q is congruent to 3 or 5 mod 8, &quot;n = 1&quot; and the extension does not split.
* For the alternating group A8, &quot;n = 1&quot; and the extension splits.
* For the O&#x27;Nan group, &quot;n&quot; = 2 and the extension does not split.
* For the Higman-Sims group, &quot;n&quot; = 2 and the extension splits.

The Schur multiplier has order 3, and its outer automorphism group has order 2. showed that &quot;O&#x27;N&quot; cannot be a subquotient of the monster group. Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the pariahs.

== Representations ==
 showed that its triple cover has two 45-dimensional representations over the field with 7 elements, exchanged by an outer automorphism.

== Maximal subgroups ==
 and independently found the 13 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of &quot;O&#x27;N&quot; as follows:

== O&#x27;Nan moonshine ==
In 2017 John F. R. Duncan, Michael H. Mertens, and Ken Ono proved theorems that establish an analogue of monstrous moonshine for the O&#x27;Nan group. Their results &quot;reveal a role for the O&#x27;Nan pariah group as a provider of hidden symmetry to quadratic forms and elliptic curves.&quot; The O&#x27;Nan moonshine results &quot;also represent the intersection of moonshine theory with the Langlands program, which, since its inception in the 1960s, has become a driving force for research in number theory, geometry and mathematical physics.&quot; . 

An informal description of these developments was written by in &quot;Quanta Magazine&quot;.

<text>In email, a return receipt is an acknowledgment by the recipient&#x27;s email client to the sender of receipt of an email message. What acknowledgment, if any, is sent by the recipient to the sender is dependent on the email software of the recipient.

Two notification services are available for email: delivery status notifications (DSNs) and message disposition notifications (MDNs). Whether such an acknowledgment of receipt is sent depends on the configuration of the recipient&#x27;s email software.

==Delivery status notifications==

DSN is both a service that may optionally be provided by Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or a message format used to return indications of message delivery to the sender of the message. Specifically, the DSN SMTP service is used to request indications of successful delivery or delivery failure (in the DSN format) be returned. Issuance of a DSN upon delivery failure is the default behavior, whereas issuance of a DSN upon successful delivery requires a specific request from the sender.

However, for various reasons, it is possible for a message to be delivered, and a DSN is returned to the sender indicating successful delivery, but the message subsequently fails to be seen by the recipient or even made available to them.

The DSN SMTP extension, message format, and associated delivery status codes are specified in RFCs 3461 through 3464 and 6522.

==Message disposition notifications==
MDNs provide a notification of the &quot;disposition&quot; of a message - indicating, for example, whether it is read by a recipient, discarded before being read, etc. However, for privacy reasons, and also for backward compatibility, requests for MDNs are entirely advisory in nature - i.e. recipients are free to ignore such requests. The format and usage of MDNs are specified in RFC 3798.

A description of how multiple Mail User Agents (MUAs) should handle the generation of MDNs in an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP4) environment is provided in RFC 3503.

A non-standard but widely used way to request return receipts is with the &quot;Return-Receipt-To:&quot; (RRT) field in the e-mail header, with the email return address specified. The first time a user opens an email message containing this field in the header, the client will typically prompt the user whether to send a return receipt.

<text>Hifikepunye Lucas Pohamba (born 18 August 1935) is a Namibian politician who served as the second president of Namibia from 21 March 2005 to 21 March 2015. He won the 2004 presidential election overwhelmingly as the candidate of SWAPO and was reelected in 2009. Pohamba was the president of SWAPO from 2007 until his retirement in 2015. He is a recipient of the Ibrahim Prize.

Before his presidency, Pohamba served in various ministerial positions, beginning with Namibia&#x27;s independence in 1990. He was Minister of Home Affairs from 1990 to 1995, Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources from 1995 to 1997, Minister without portfolio from 1997 to 2000, and Minister of Lands, Resettlement and Rehabilitation from 2001 to 2005. He was also secretary-general of SWAPO from 1997 to 2002 and vice-president of SWAPO from 2002 to 2007.

== Early life ==
Hifikepunye Pohamba was born on 18 August 1935 in Okanghudi, then part of South West Africa, in an area then known as Ovamboland (today in the Ohangwena Region of Namibia). He completed his primary school education in the Anglican Holy Cross Mission school in Onamunhama, and in 1956 took up work at the Tsumeb mine. 

==Political career==
===Under South African occupation===
Pohamba was active in the Ovamboland People&#x27;s Organization. When this national liberation movement transformed into SWAPO in 1960, Pohamba was a founding member of the organization&#x27;s new incarnation and left his job in the mine to work as a full-time organizer for the group.

In 1961 Pohamba went into exile. He traveled to Dar es Salaam to the newly-independent Tanganyika (today part of Tanzania) where he met Sam Nujoma, later Namibia&#x27;s first president, for the first time. It was resolved that he should join a group of SWAPO members returning home and mobilizing people there. On his way he was arrested in Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe) and was jailed in Bulawayo, then deported to Johannesburg. He spent six months in jail there and was then put under house arrest in Ovamboland.

In 1964 Pohamba again left Namibia. He went to Lusaka to set up SWAPO&#x27;s Zambian office. He returned to Namibia in 1966 with Sam Nujoma, claiming that SWAPO leaders were not banned from traveling. They were nevertheless deported to Zambia a day after their arrival. Pohamba moved to Dar es Salaam again.

In 1971 SWAPO transferred Pohamba to Algeria; He became the movement&#x27;s chief representative for northern Africa. In 1979 he became the party&#x27;s chief of operations in Lusaka. From 1981 to 1982 he studied politics in the Soviet Union, and upon his return to Africa, he moved to Luanda, Angola, where SWAPO&#x27;s headquarters was at that time.

===After independence of Namibia===
Pohamba headed SWAPO&#x27;s 1989 election campaign and was a SWAPO member of the Constituent Assembly, which was in place from November 1989 to March 1990, before becoming a member of the National Assembly at independence in March 1990. He was Minister of Home Affairs from March 1990 to 1995, Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources from 1995 to 1997, and Minister without portfolio from 1997 to March 2000. He was elected as secretary-general of SWAPO in 1997 and as its vice-president in 2002. On 26 January 2001, he was appointed as Minister of Lands, Resettlement and Rehabilitation in addition to his above ministerial position, in which position he remained until becoming president in 2005.

Under Pohamba&#x27;s leadership as Minister of Lands, Resettlement, and Rehabilitation, Namibia initiated a policy of partial land expropriation from landed white farmers to landless black ones. This policy was introduced to supplement the existing one of &quot;willing buyer-willing seller&quot; to try speed up the process.

After becoming president, Pohamba also took over the chancellorship of the University of Namibia from Nujoma in November 2011.

===Presidency===

Pohamba was selected as SWAPO&#x27;s candidate for the 2004 presidential election at an extraordinary party congress held in May 2004. He received 213 votes out of 526 in the first round of voting; in the second round, held on 30 May, he won with 341 votes against 167 for Hidipo Hamutenya, having received the support of nearly all of those who had backed third-place candidate Nahas Angula in the first round. In the presidential election, held on 15/16 November 2004, Pohamba won with 76.44% of the vote, in what has been described as a &quot;landslide&quot;, but also denounced as flawed by the opposition. He was backed by Nujoma, who was then serving his third five-year term; Pohamba has been described as Nujoma&#x27;s hand-picked successor. Pohamba took office as president on 21 March 2005 and has since distinguished himself by careful but decisive moves against corruption.
Although there was speculation that Nujoma would seek re-election as SWAPO President in 2007 and then run for President of Namibia again in 2009, he denied these rumors in early October 2007, saying that he intended to step down as party leader in favor of Pohamba. On 29 November 2007, Pohamba was elected as SWAPO President at a party congress; he was the only candidate to be nominated and no voting was deemed necessary. Nujoma said that he was &quot;passing the torch and mantle of leadership to comrade Pohamba&quot;. The congress also chose Pohamba as the party&#x27;s only candidate for the 2009 presidential election.

Pohamba won a second term in the November 2009 presidential election, receiving 611,241 total votes (76.42%). The second-place candidate, Hidipo Hamutenya (who had left SWAPO and gone into opposition), received 88,640 (11.08%).

Pohamba was unable to stand for re-election in 2014 due to constitutional term limits. The election was again won overwhelmingly by SWAPO, and Pohamba was succeeded by Hage Geingob on 21 March 2015. Less than a month later, on 19 April 2015, he retired as president of SWAPO.

Pohamba ended his term with high approval ratings, being hailed for pushing for gender equality and increased spending on housing and education.

==Private life==
Pohamba has been married to Penehupifo since 1983. The couple owns farm Guinaspoh #41 near Otavi.

==Honors==
===Foreign honours===
** Grand Cordon of the Order of the Pioneers of Liberia (29 July 2009)
** First Class of the Order of Friendship (20 March 2008)

===Awards===
*Pohamba is a recipient of the Omugulugwombashe Medal for Bravery and Long Service.
*In 2011, he was awarded a Doctorate of Philosophy &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the University of Namibia.
*In 2015, he was awarded the 2014 Mo Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership of $5 million by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation.
*On 29 April 2016, he was awarded a Doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the University for Development Studies, Tamale, Ghana

<text>David Grierson (February 19, 1955 – November 20, 2004) was a Canadian radio broadcaster, best known as a host of national and local programming for CBC Radio.

He was born in Toronto in 1955 and graduated from the broadcasting program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, as well as training as a classical clarinetist.

==Broadcasting==
Grierson began working in broadcasting as a radio producer and programming director for commercial radio stations in Vancouver, including CHQM-FM and CJAZ-FM.

Grierson was a weekly columnist and co-host of &quot;Sunday Arts/Entertainment&quot;, as well as a contributor to &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonite&quot; and &quot;The Journal&quot; on CBC Television. His series &quot;The Performers&quot; ran on CTV and Turner Network Television.

In the late 1980s, Grierson hosted &quot;The Arts Report&quot;, CBC Stereo&#x27;s national morning arts newscast. In 1991, he succeeded Bob Oxley as host of &quot;Stereo Morning&quot;, the network&#x27;s main morning program, until leaving in 1992 to take a position with network station CBU in Vancouver. He worked as a staff announcer for the station until 1997, when he became the host and producer of &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, the station&#x27;s weekend morning show.

In December 2000, he left &quot;NXNW&quot; to take over from Lisa Cordasco as host of CBCV-FM&#x27;s &quot;On the Island&quot;, the network&#x27;s morning show for Vancouver Island. He hosted &quot;On the Island&quot; until his death in 2004.

Grierson was also a contributor to other network programming including &quot;Westcoast Performance&quot;, &quot;Richardson&#x27;s Roundup&quot;, &quot;Morningside&quot;, &quot;Gabereau&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Prime Time&quot;, &quot;Arts National&quot;, &quot;Sunday Matinee&quot;, &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; and &quot;DiscDrive&quot;. He was also the voice of the &quot;National Research Council Time Signal&quot;.

==Other activities==
Grierson wrote &quot;The Expo Celebration&quot;, a retrospective book featuring the work of more than 50 of Canada&#x27;s top photographers. A passion for jazz music saw him create and write a weekly column called &quot;The Jazz Life&quot; for the &quot;Georgia Straight&quot;, and his feature writing on music appeared in publications including &quot;Down Beat&quot;, &quot;Swing Journal&quot;, &quot;Canadian Musician&quot; and &quot;Western Living&quot;.

In 1993 and 1994, he won two successive songwriting competitions staged by the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, the first time with a rewrite of Julia Ward Howe&#x27;s &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; as a tribute to the Vancouver Folk Music Festival, and the second with a rewrite of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; as a song about the 1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot. Both songs were submitted under pseudonyms, and on both occasions he donated his prize, a family pass to the folk festival, to a family who could not otherwise afford to attend.

A frequent juror for creative competitions, Grierson was a charter member of the Writers Guild of Canada, one of the founding members of the British Columbia chapter of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and sat on the board of directors of the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.

==Death==

<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Rudvalis group &quot;Ru&quot; is a sporadic simple group of order
:   145,926,144,000 = 214335371329
: ≈ 1.

==History==
&quot;Ru&quot; is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was found by and constructed by . Its Schur multiplier has order 2, and its outer automorphism group is trivial.

In 1982 Robert Griess showed that &quot;Ru&quot; cannot be a subquotient of the monster group. Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the pariahs.

== Properties ==

The Rudvalis group acts as a rank 3 permutation group on 4060 points, with one point stabilizer being the Ree group 
2&quot;F&quot;4(2), the automorphism group of the Tits group. This representation implies a strongly regular graph srg(4060, 2304, 1328, 1280). That is, each vertex has 2304 neighbors and 1755 non-neighbors, any two adjacent vertices have 1328 common neighbors, while any two non-adjacent ones have 1280 .

Its double cover acts on a 28-dimensional lattice over the Gaussian integers. The lattice has 4×4060 minimal vectors; if minimal vectors are identified whenever one is 1, &quot;i&quot;, –1, or –&quot;i&quot; times another, then the 4060 equivalence classes can be identified with the points of the rank 3 permutation representation. Reducing this lattice modulo the principal ideal

:formula_1

gives an action of the Rudvalis group on a 28-dimensional vector space over the field formula_2 with 2 elements. Duncan (2006) used the 28-dimensional lattice to construct a vertex operator algebra acted on by the double cover.

Alternatively, the double cover can be defined abstractly, by starting with the graph and lifting Ru to 2Ru in the double cover 2A4060. This is because 1 of the conjugacy classes of involutions does not fix any points. Such an involution partitions the 4060 points of the graph into 2030 pairs, which can be regarded as 1015 double transpositions in the alternating group A4060. Since 1015 is odd, these involutions are lifted to order 4 elements in the double cover 2A4060. For more information, see Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups.

 characterized the Rudvalis group by the centralizer of a central involution. gave another characterization as part of their identification of the Rudvalis group as one of the quasithin groups.

== Maximal subgroups ==

<text>Phaic Tăn (subtitled &quot;Sunstroke on a Shoestring&quot;) is a 2004 parody travel guidebook examining imaginary country Phaic Tăn. The book was written by Australians Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro, and Rob Sitch. Along with the other Jetlag Travel volumes, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Molvanîa&quot; and 2006&#x27;s &quot;San Sombrèro&quot;, the book parodies both the language of heritage tourism and the legacy of colonialism and imperialism.

==About Phaic Tăn==

The Kingdom of Phaic Tăn is a composite creation of a number of stereotypes and clichés about South East Asian countries.

Phaic Tăn is said to be situated in Indochina. Place names in Phaic Tăn initially seem to be Vietnamese or Thai, but they form English language puns, hence the capital is called &quot;Bumpattabumpah&quot; (&quot;bumper to bumper&quot;). &quot;Phaic Tăn&quot; can be read as &quot;Fake Tan&quot;. Also, the districts are the mountainous &quot;Pha Phlung&quot; (&quot;far flung&quot;), the infertile &quot;Sukkondat&quot; (&quot;suck on that&quot;), the hyper &quot;Buhng Lunhg&quot; (&quot;bung lung&quot;; Australian slang &#x27;bung&#x27;, meaning &#x27;failed&#x27;), and the exotic &quot;Thong On&quot;.

The country was an ancient kingdom colonized by France, but was liberated in the early 20th century through student and communist uprisings. A Marxist dictatorship under Chau Quoc continued until his death in 1947, which prompted the country to launch into a lengthy civil war. Eventually a CIA-backed coup (&quot;Operation Freedom&quot;) made the country into a military dictatorship which it remains to this day. The country has a popular royal family, though the current king has been deposed no fewer than 25 times.

Like &quot;Molvanîa&quot;, the humour of the book comes from the guide&#x27;s attempts to present Phaic Tăn as an attractive, enjoyable country when it is really little more than a squalid, third-world dump. The country is frequently plagued by monsoons and earthquakes and many armed militia groups still patrol the streets.

The Phaic Tăn people are presented to be extremely superstitious, and obsessed with the concept of luck. The index of the book contains a list of almost 600 numbers the Phaic Tănese consider lucky, plus two considered unlucky (3 and 6). Turning left while driving is also considered unlucky, which causes a lot of traffic problems. Also unlucky is asking for a non-exotic massage, having more than 5 holes in Quic Pot, and to lose a lottery.

The current king is Sukhimbol Tralanhng III, ninth king of the Angit dynasty. King Falanhng prides himself on being something of a musician and composer. In fact, the country&#x27;s national anthem was actually written by him and whenever it is played Phaic Tănese will immediately stand and place one hand over each ear. His wife is the very overweight Suahm Luprang, his crown prince is the perverted Ferduk, his daughter is the also overweight (and embarrassed) Buk Phang, and his youngest son is Luat the Brooding, who was arrested for misusing a gun.

===Geography and provinces===
According to the book, Phaic Tăn is a country situated in Indochina of South-east Asia. It is shown in the book&#x27;s map as being bounded to the south by the Lhong Chuk Sea and the Pong and Kut Rivers to the north and east respectively.

Phaic Tăn is depicted as being roughly 650 kilometres abroad from east–west at its broadest point and the same distance from its far geographical north-east tip to the Pong Delta in the country&#x27;s south-east.

The country is divided by several rivers, including the Sirikan, Upper Kut and the Nahkthong. The country&#x27;s major rivers are the Pong and Nahkthong, which both finish in the Pong and Nahkthong Deltas respectively.

Phaic Tăn is made up of four provinces (going in order clockwise), Sukkondat, Pha Phlung, Buhng Lung and Thong On. The provinces are connected by roads, but not by rail, as rail gauges vary throughout the country and sometimes even on the same line.

In one page, the country&#x27;s location is contradicted from being in Indochina to being between North and South Korea.

====Bumpattabumpah====
The capital city of Phaic Tăn is Bumpattabumpah, which is situated in Buhng Lung in a roughly central position on the Pong River and at the west end of the Upper Kut River. Bumpattabumpah is Phaic Tăn&#x27;s largest city, and presumably the most populous.

According to the book, Bumpattabumpah means &quot;water convergence&quot; and refers to the fact that the city is situated where the country&#x27;s main river, the Pong, meets untreated effluent from a sewage treatment plant further upstream.
Also, Bumpattabumpah was previously named &quot;Phxux Xauan&quot; but was changed because a survey revealed that less than 12% of the population were able to pronounce it.

An in-book map of Bumpattabumpah shows the names of its suburbs, all English-language puns: Qic Phuk, Phlat Tiht and Dud Bhonk. Many of the names of the roads throughout the city are also English puns, as is the name of the city&#x27;s and country&#x27;s major airport, Phlat Chat Airport.

High smog levels in the capital city mean that office blocks require no window tinting, a result of heavy amounts of air pollution. In 1997, developers announced plans to build the tallest office block in the world. Construction actually began but only a short while after the foundations were dug the Asian economic crisis hit, meaning the project was completely shelved. Bumpattabumpah now boasts the largest unfenced hole in the world.

====Sukkondat====
Sukkondat is traditionally Phaic Tăn&#x27;s poorest province, due to the infertility of its soil, lack of natural resources and high number of casinos. An agricultural province, farmers harvest hay in order to camouflage their true primary crop, opium. The capital of the province is Sloh Phan, which is located about ninety kilometres north-east of Gunsa Wah, Phaic Tăn&#x27;s tallest peak, at 2150 metres in height. Despite the fact that Sukkondat receives less than 2% of all visitors to Phaic Tăn every year, this statistic hasn&#x27;t stopped its local Tourism Bureau from declaring the province &#x27;the place to be&#x27;.

====Pha Phlung====
Pha Phlung in the country&#x27;s northeast is mountainous and renowned for its rainforests, waterfalls and mud-slides. Pha Phlung is traditionally known as the &#x27;Land Of A Thousand Tigers&#x27; and while actual numbers may be closer to seven (counting five in the Lom Buak Grand Circus), nature walks through Pha Phlung are an excellent way to see nature and wildlife up close. The capital of this wet and humid province is Nham Pong.

====Buhng Lung====
According to the book, Buhng Lung is a busy province where all car horns have cruise control, set to go off every ten seconds. The Pong Delta is located in the south-east of the Buhng Lung province. The capital city of Bumpattabumpah is located in the north of the province.

====Thong On====
Thong On is an exotic province of which Pattaponga, located on the coast of Kru Kut Bay, is the capital. The coast is composed of many beaches. Of particular note is Zou Kow Bow Beach, which is said to have the whitest sand of any beach in the world. The beach sand&#x27;s whiteness was formed in the 1980s by the rare combination of global warming and a huge spill from a tanker carrying laundry bleach.

===Flag===
The Phaic Tănese flag has the design of a ping-pong (table tennis) table. It is known as the Phing Pong, and is noted to be the world&#x27;s only hinged flag, which while unconventional, &quot;makes flag-folding ceremonies easier&quot;.

===Language===
The Phaic Tănese language is a tonal language with four tones, sharing similarities with Chinese. There is also a fifth tone emerging, but this tone is largely restricted to use by rappers. It is spoken with an average of 192 syllables per minute.

===Pyangtru Yix Qaugen (Hospital of Hearts)===
The Phaic Tăn website features a spoof soap opera called &quot;Pyangtru Yix Qaugen&quot; (Hospital of Hearts), in which the characters (Doctor Lahbkot, 3-star General Kpow and his much younger millionairess wife) speak in what appears to be a dialect of Chinese spoken in Taiwan and parts of Fujian, Vietnamese and some heavily accented garbled sounds made to resemble Korean, subtitled in a stilted form of English, with curious turns of phrase and double entendres. This is a parody of the English subtitles often encountered on kung fu movies, or an attempt at Engrish.

<doc id="1196772" wikidata="Q3117684" url="?curid=1196772" title="Harada–Norton group">
<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Harada–Norton group &quot;HN&quot; is a sporadic simple group of order
:   273,030,912,000,000
: = 214365671119
: ≈ 3.

==History and properties==
&quot;HN&quot; is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was found by and ).

Its Schur multiplier is trivial and its outer automorphism group has order 2. 

&quot;HN&quot; has an involution whose centralizer is of the form 2.HS.2, where HS is the Higman-Sims group (which is how Harada found it). 

The prime 5 plays a special role in the group. For example, it centralizes an element of order 5 in the Monster group (which is how Norton found it), and as a result acts naturally on a vertex operator algebra over the field with 5 elements . This implies that it acts on a 133 dimensional algebra over F5 with a commutative but nonassociative product, analogous to the Griess algebra .

The full normalizer of a 5A element in the Monster group is (D10 × HN).2, so HN centralizes 5 involutions alongside the 5-cycle. These involutions are centralized by the Baby monster group, which therefore contains HN as a subgroup.

==Generalized monstrous moonshine==

Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. 
To recall, the prime number 5 plays a special role in the group and for &quot;HN&quot;, the relevant McKay-Thompson series is formula_1 where one can set the constant term (),

:formula_2

and &quot;η&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;) is the Dedekind eta function.

==Maximal subgroups==
 found the 14 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of &quot;HN&quot; as follows:

<doc id="1196782" wikidata="Q1763845" url="?curid=1196782" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit">
<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (in case citations, Fed. Cir. or C.A.F.C.) is one of the 13 United States courts of appeals. It has appellate jurisdiction over certain categories of specialized cases in the U.S. federal court system. Specifically, it has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all U.S. federal cases involving patents, trademark registrations, government contracts, veterans&#x27; benefits, public safety officers&#x27; benefits, federal employees&#x27; benefits, and various other types of cases. The Federal Circuit has no jurisdiction over criminal, bankruptcy, immigration, or any U.S. state law cases. It is headquartered at the Howard T. Markey National Courts Building in Washington, D.C. 

The Federal Circuit was created in 1982 with passage of the Federal Courts Improvement Act, which merged the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims, making the judges of the former courts into circuit judges. In addition to the Markey Building, the court also occupies the adjacent Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House, former Cosmos Club building, and the Cutts-Madison House in Washington, D.C., on Lafayette Square. The court sits from time to time in locations other than Washington, and its judges can and do sit by designation on the benches of other courts of appeals and federal district courts. , Washington and Lee University School of Law&#x27;s Millhiser Moot Courtroom had been designated as the continuity of operations site for the court.

==Jurisdiction==
The Federal Circuit is unique among the courts of appeals in that its jurisdiction is based wholly upon subject matter, not geographic location. The Federal Circuit is an appellate court with jurisdiction generally given in . The court hears certain appeals from all of the United States District Courts, appeals from certain administrative agencies, and appeals arising under certain statutes. Among other things, the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from:
* Article I tribunals:
** United States Court of Federal Claims
** United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims
** United States Trademark Trial and Appeal Board
** United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (formerly known as the United States Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences)
** Boards of contract appeals (for Government contract disputes pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978):
*** Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals
*** Civilian Board of Contract Appeals
*** Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals
** United States Merit Systems Protection Board (federal employment and employment benefits)
** United States International Trade Commission
* Article III tribunals:
** United States Court of International Trade
** United States district courts relating to:
***Patents, including appeals arising from an action against the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks under 
***The Little Tucker Act, 
***Section 211 of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970;
***Section 5 of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973;
***Section 523 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975; and
***Section 506(c) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978
* Office of Congressional Workplace Rights

Although the Federal Circuit typically hears all appeals from any United States District Court where the original action included a complaint arising under the patent laws, the Supreme Court decided in &quot;Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc.&quot; (2002) that the Federal Circuit did not have jurisdiction if the patent claims arose solely as counterclaims by the defendant. However, the force of law of &quot;Holmes&quot; ended following passage of the America Invents Act of 2011, which requires the Federal Circuit to hear all appeals where the original action included a complaint or compulsory counterclaim arising under the patent laws.

The decisions of the Federal Circuit, particularly in regard to patent cases, are unique in that they are binding precedent throughout the U.S. within the bounds of the court&#x27;s subject-matter jurisdiction. This is unlike the other courts of appeals as the authority of their decisions is restricted by geographic location and thus there may be differing judicial standards depending on location. Decisions of the Federal Circuit are only superseded by decisions of the Supreme Court or by applicable changes in the law. Also, review by the Supreme Court is discretionary, so Federal Circuit decisions are often the final word, especially since there are no circuit splits given the Federal Circuit&#x27;s exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction. In its first decision, the Federal Circuit incorporated as binding precedent the decisions of its predecessor courts, the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims.

Because the Court is one of national jurisdiction, panels from the court may sit anywhere in the country. Typically, once or twice a year, the court will hold oral arguments in a city outside of its native Washington D.C. The panels may sit in Federal courthouses, state courthouses, or even at law schools.

==Composition==

The Federal Circuit may have a total of 12 active circuit judges sitting at any given time, who are required to reside within 50 miles of the District of Columbia, as set by . Judges on senior status are not subject to this restriction. As with other federal judges, they are nominated by the President and must be confirmed by the Senate. Their terms last during the &quot;good behavior&quot; of the judges, which typically results in life tenure. When eligible, judges may elect to take senior status. This allows a senior judge to continue to serve on the court while handling fewer cases than an active service judge. Each judge in active service employs a judicial assistant and up to four law clerks, while each judge in senior status employs a judicial assistant and one law clerk.

==Current composition of the court==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;







&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
==List of former judges==








==Chief judges==




Notwithstanding the foregoing, when the court was initially created, Congress had to resolve which chief judge of the predecessor courts would become the first chief judge. It was decided that the chief judge of the predecessor court who had the most seniority, as chief judge, would be the new chief judge. This made Howard T. Markey, former chief judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the first chief judge.

==Succession of seats==
The court has twelve seats for active judges, numbered in alphabetical order by their occupant at the time the court was formed, with the sole vacant seat being numbered last. Judges who retire into senior status remain on the bench but leave their seat vacant. That seat is filled by the next circuit judge appointed by the President.

<doc id="1196783" wikidata="Q1364819" url="?curid=1196783" title="Richard Leacock">
<text>Richard Leacock (18 July 192123 March 2011) was a British-born documentary film director and one of the pioneers of direct cinema and cinéma vérité.

==Early life and career==
Leacock was born in London on 18 July 1921, the younger brother of film director and producer Philip Leacock. Leacock grew up on his father&#x27;s banana plantation in the Canary Islands until being sent to boarding schools in England at the age of eight.

He took up photography with a glass plate camera, built a darkroom and developed his pictures, but was not satisfied. At age 11 he was shown a silent film &quot;Turk-Sib&quot; about the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway. He was stunned, and said to himself: &quot;All I need is a cine-camera and I can make a film that shows you what it is like to be there.&quot;

At the age of 14, he wrote, directed, filmed and edited &quot;Canary Bananas&quot; (10 min. 16mm, silent), a film about growing bananas, but it did not, in his opinion, give you &quot;the feeling of being there&quot;.

He was educated at Dartington Hall School from 1934 to 1938, alongside Robert Flaherty&#x27;s daughters; David Lack (&quot;Life of the Robin&quot;) taught biology at the school. After filming Lack&#x27;s expedition to the Canary and Galapagos Islands (1938–39), Leacock moved to the US and majored in physics at Harvard to master the technology of filmmaking. Meanwhile, he worked as cameraman and assistant editor on other peoples films, notably &quot;To Hear Your Banjo Play&quot; (1941)—Leacock filmed a folk music festival atop a mountain in south Virginia where there was no electricity, using a 35mm studio camera and 35mm optical film sound recorder with batteries in a large truck, a rare achievement at that time. He then spent three years as a combat photographer in Burma and China, followed by 14 months as cameraman on Robert Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Louisiana Story&quot; (1946–48).

In the meantime, Leacock had married Eleanor &quot;Happy&quot; Burke in 1941. Daughter of the world-famous literary critic, philosopher, and writer Kenneth Burke, she had studied at Radcliffe College, but graduated from Barnard in New York City. The Leacocks had four children together: Elspeth, Robert, David and Claudia. After ethnographic fieldwork with the Innu (Montagnais-Naskapi) of Labrador, Eleanor Leacock (1922–1987) earned her doctorate in anthropology at Columbia University (1952). Ten years later, after her marriage broke up, she went on to become a pioneering feminist anthropologist.

In 1963, he married Marilyn Pedersen West, a painter, writer, and fashion model, who worked for social causes. They had a daughter, Victoria. In 1970 they separated, and remained separated until her death in 1980.

==Documentaries==
Many relatively conventional jobs followed, until 1954, when Leacock was asked to make a reportage on a traveling tent theater in Missouri: the first film he had written directed, photographed, and edited himself since &quot;Canary Bananas&quot;.

This film, &quot;Toby and the Tall Corn&quot;, went on the American cultural TV program, &quot;Omnibus&quot;, in prime time and brought him into contact with Robert Drew, an editor at &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine in search of a less verbal approach to television reportage. Another new contact, Roger Tilton, wanted to film an evening of people dancing to Dixieland music spontaneously. Leacock filmed &quot;Jazz Dance&quot; for him, using hand held camera techniques.

Leacock&#x27;s search for high quality, mobile, synchronous equipment to facilitate observation was ongoing. Along with fellow film maker Robert Drew, he developed the method of separating the wire from the microphones and the cameras. Leacock explains the problem with &quot;Louisiana Story&quot; and pre-synchronized sound filmmakers:Like all documentary filmmakers, he [Flaherty] had an identity problem in that period. They couldn&#x27;t deal with sync sound. It tied them down. Made them rigid… Except for the drilling sequence, which was shot with sound, it was essentially a silent film. And it wasn&#x27;t till 1960, when we were filming Primary, that we were able to jump into the new world.Frustrated with the obtrusiveness of the process of synching footage and sound, Leacock knew there had to be a way to separate the two. In 1958, the idea became obvious. &quot;We had to have a mobile quartz camera, and we had to have a mobile quartz tape recorder, and we couldn&#x27;t have cables connecting them.&quot; Leacock took the same design as in an Accutron watch and put it in the camera. This allowed proper synchronisation. They then took their design to RCA who showed interest; and after receiving money from &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine, Drew and Leacock were able to make the first model and shoot their film &quot;Primary.&quot; As Leacock pointed out, “nothing has really changed since then, I mean it is a little bit better… basically the same thing.&quot; Brian Winston describes Leacock as the father of modern documentary because of this development.

&quot;He was the catalyst for the development of the modern documentary, liberating the camera from the tripod and abandoning the tyranny of perfectly stable, perfectly lit shot—as well as the straitjacket of ‘voice of god’ commentary.&quot;

Winston goes on to note that this new mode of film-making essentially dominated over any other style for “a quarter of a century.&quot; When most people think of the word “documentary,” they think of the observational mode that Leacock, Drew, and Pennebaker all played such a huge role in creating.

In 1947–1948, Leacock served as cameraman and co-director with John Ferno (Fernhaut) on seven short films in the &#x27;Earth and Its People&#x27; series produced by Louis De Rochemont, two in France, and one each in Holland, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, and the Sahara Desert. In the late 1950s, Leacock produced several educational film shorts for the Physical Science Study Committee, a project based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to improve the teaching of high school physics.

A number of films followed made by Drew, DA Pennebaker, Maysles and their associates, but the U.S. networks were not impressed. In France at the Cinémathèque Française, when Drew and Leacock screened &quot;Primary&quot; (1960) and &quot;On the Pole&quot; (1960), Henri Langlois introduced the films as &quot;perhaps the most important documentaries since the brothers Lumiere&quot;. After the screening, a monk in robes came up to them and said &quot;You have invented a new form. Now you must invent a new grammar!&quot;

When Drew went to work for ABC-TV, the Leacock-Pennebaker company was formed and produced &quot;Happy Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;, &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; (1966), &quot;A Stravinsky Portrait&quot; and many others ending with the remnants of Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;One A.M. – One P.M.&quot; (1972).

In 1968, he was invited to join Ed Pincus creating a new, small film school at MIT. Because 16mm filming was becoming so expensive, his group developed Super-8 film sync equipment with modified mass-produced cameras that were much cheaper. Many filmmakers emerged from this program, including Ross McElwee (&quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot;). Leacock taught at MIT until his retirement in 1989.

In 1989, he moved to Paris, where he met Valerie Lalonde, and they made &quot;Les Oeufs a la Coque de Richard Leacock&quot; (84 minutes), the first major film shot with a tiny Video-8 Handycam to be broadcast on prime-time television in France. Leacock and Lalonde continued making films without the pressures of TV producers, notably &quot;A Musical Adventure in Siberia&quot;, in collaboration with his daughter Victoria Leacock, conductor Sarah Caldwell, and filmmaker Vincent Blanchet.

Leacock died on 23 March 2011 at age the age of 89 in Paris. Before his death, he was raising funds for his multi-format memoir &quot;The Feeling of Being There: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Memoir&quot;, a bound paper book and DVB (digital video book), published by Semeïon Editions.

To Leacock, the process of film-making is a &quot;process of discovery.&quot; He did not film to preach his own ideas and his own presuppositions; he wanted to discover the world around him. To him, any type of staging makes no sense, and in the end, comes across as fake. &quot;Usually, if you wait long enough they end up doing things naturally.&quot; Leacock believed that if you wait, people will become comfortable with the camera and start acting like themselves. Cameras, he thought, should be small and unobtrusive, though never hidden. You should shoot in sequence if you can, and without interfering or asking for actions to be repeated. Just like in &quot;Crisis&quot; and &quot;Primary&quot;, the action only comes from observation. By simply placing a camera in a room, our eyes can be opened. His main goal was to give viewers the sense of being there.

<doc id="1196791" wikidata="Q712610" url="?curid=1196791" title="SilverHawks">
<text>SilverHawks is an American animated television series developed by Rankin/Bass Productions and distributed by Lorimar-Telepictures in 1986. The animation was provided by Japanese studio Pacific Animation Corporation. In total, 65 episodes were made. It was created as a space-based equivalent of their previous series &quot;ThunderCats&quot;.

As was the case with &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, there was also a &quot;SilverHawks&quot; comic book series published by Marvel Comics under the imprint Star Comics.

==Plot==
A bionic space enforcer called Commander Stargazer recruited the SilverHawks, heroes who are &quot;partly metal, partly real&quot;, to fight the evil Mon*Star, an escaped alien crime boss who transforms into an enormous armor-plated creature with the help of Limbo&#x27;s Moonstar. Joining Mon*Star in his villainy is an intergalactic mob consisting of Yes-Man, Buzz-Saw, Mumbo-Jumbo, Windhammer, Mo-Lec-U-Lar, Poker-Face, Hardware, and &quot;the musical madness of&quot; Melodia.

Quicksilver (formerly Jonathan Quick) leads the SilverHawks, with his metal bird companion Tally-Hawk at his side. Twins Emily and Will Hart became Steelheart and Steelwill, the SilverHawks&#x27;s technician and strongman respectively. Country-singing Bluegrass piloted the team&#x27;s ship, the Maraj (pronounced &quot;mirage&quot; on the series, but given that spelling on the Kenner toy). Rounding out the group is a youngster &quot;from the planet of the mimes&quot;, named &quot;The Copper Kidd&quot; and usually called &quot;Kidd&quot; for short, a mathematical genius who spoke in whistles and computerized tones. Their bionic bodies are covered by a full-body close-fitting metal armor that only exposes the face and an arm, the armor is equipped with a retractile protective mask, retractable under-arm wings (except Bluegrass), thrusters on their heels, and laser-weapons in their shoulders.

==Characters==
===Silverhawks===
====Main Silverhawks====
* Commander Stargazer (voiced by Bob McFadden) is a tough and grizzled old police officer with bionic capabilities, he captured Mon*Star several years ago prior to the start of the series and had him imprisoned. Older than the other SilverHawks, he longs to return to Earth for either a vacation or for retirement. Stargazer chiefly serves as the SilverHawks &quot;eyes and ears&quot;, keeping them apprised of their current situation. His first name is apparently Burt. In the SilverHawks&#x27; first adventure, Stargazer is depicted as the keeper of Tally-Hawk who subsequently was teamed with Quicksilver. His armor is gold, covering the upper left portion of his head as well as his body, and his left eye has been replaced by a telescopic lens. Stargazer wears a white button up shirt, loosened necktie, suspenders and slacks, making him resemble a stereotypical plainclothes police officer.
* Quicksilver / Captain Jonathan Quick (voiced by Peter Newman) was the former head of Interplanetary Force H and is the field leader of the SilverHawks. Known for his quick reflexes (and even quicker thinking), Quicksilver is an accomplished tactician and athlete. His armor is silver in color.
* Bluegrass (voiced by Larry Kenney) is second-in-command of the SilverHawks and the chief pilot of the group as well as a cowboy at heart. Bluegrass is the only active SilverHawk who cannot fly, but he is the one that pilots the team&#x27;s vehicle the &quot;Maraj&quot;. He uses his weapon/instrument (portrayed in the toyline as his weapon-bird with the name &quot;Sideman&quot;) and his lasso. Bluegrass has an interface with the Maraj&#x27;s piloting system, which he has affectionately dubbed &quot;Hot Licks&quot;. His armor has a blue-silver shade, and he wears a red bandana around his neck and a cowboy hat.
* Steelheart/Sergeant Emily Hart and Steelwill/Sergeant Will Hart (voiced by Maggie Wheeler and Bob McFadden) are fraternal twin siblings. They became Steelheart and Steelwill respectively when they joined the SilverHawks. Steelheart and Steelwill had artificial hearts implanted during their transformation. Their armors are both a dark steel color. Steelheart and Steelwill are the &quot;gearheads&quot; of the team. Due to an empathic bond, when one sibling feels something, the other feels it as well. Physically, they are the strongest members of the team.
* The Copper Kidd (vocal effects provided by Pete Cannarozzi) is the youngest member of the SilverHawks and the only one not from Earth. A mathematical genius from the Planet of the Mimes, he &quot;speaks&quot; in tones and whistles. The Copper Kid&#x27;s skin is blue except for white markings on his face that resemble the makeup of a mime. His armor is copper-colored but the wings have a silver-like appearance similar to those his teammates. A natural acrobat, the Copper Kidd has two razor-edged discs (one mounted on each hip) which he throws like Frisbees. At the end of each episode, he was quizzed in astronomy lessons by Bluegrass as training to become the reserve Maraj pilot (a role he later infrequently filled).

====Minor Silverhawks====
* Hotwing (voiced by Adolph Caesar in earlier episodes, Doug Preis in later episodes) is a gold SilverHawk who was added mid-season. He is a magician and skilled illusionist. Hotwing received his powers from a mystical energy force that &quot;chose&quot; him to bear the powers to fight against injustice. He has to recharge these powers every 14 years, otherwise he will die. One notable time was when Zeek the Beak tricked the mystic force into giving him these powers which would have resulted in Hotwing&#x27;s death.
* Flashback (voiced by Peter Newman) is a green time-traveling Silverhawk from the far future. When he meets the &#x27;much older&#x27; Stargazer who tells him of the fateful day the SilverHawks died, Flashback travels back in time to save them from an exploding sun. He also traveled back in time to stop Hardware from destroying the SilverHawks (when the mad inventor sabotaged the Maraj during their hyperspace-sleep to Hawk-Haven from Earth, which would have caused the autopilot to fly them straight into the sun).
* Moon Stryker (voiced by Larry Kenney) is a turquoise Silverhawk. He can propel himself through space by a powerful cyclone generated from propellers that emerge from his waist. He is cocky but an expert marksman, as demonstrated when he shot a pen out of Stargazer&#x27;s hand when they first met in the episode &quot;Battle Cruiser&quot;.
* Condor (voiced by Bob McFadden) - An old ally of Stargazer whom Condor calls &quot;Gaze&quot;. Condor left the SilverHawks to become a private investigator before the series, but eventually returned. Instead of wings, he has a jetpack and his main weapon is an energy whip.

====SilverHawk&#x27;s Fighting Hawks====
The Fighting Hawks are hawk-like partners of the SilverHawks who have different abilities that help them in their fight against the Mob and other villains.

* Tally-Hawk is Quicksilver&#x27;s Fighting Hawk who is partly metal and partly real. Its beak can tear through metal and can shoot lasers.
* Side Man is Bluegrass&#x27;s Fighting Hawk who plays music and fires lasers.
* Rayzor is Steelheart&#x27;s Fighting Hawk whose wings can cut through metal.
* Stronghold is Steelwill&#x27;s Fighting Hawk who can lift anything that is heavy.
* May-Day is Copper Kidd&#x27;s Fighting Hawk with sonic-based abilities.
* Sly-Bird is Stargazer&#x27;s Fighting Hawk who can photograph and record anything.
* Gyro is Hotwing&#x27;s Fighting Hawk with spinning abilities.
* Backlash is Flashback&#x27;s Fighting Hawk who can also travel through time.
* Tail-Spin is Moon Stryker&#x27;s Fighting Hawk.

===Villains===
====The Mob====
The Mob is an organized crime group and the primary antagonists of the series that commits crimes throughout Limbo and operate from Brim*Star. They travel in three open-cab spacecraft called the Zoomer, Road Star, and Limbo Limo.

* Mon*Star (voiced by Earl Hammond) is the quintillionaire alien crime boss and &quot;Planet Master&quot; who escaped from his cell on Penal Planet 10. He appears as a feline muscular humanoid with dark hair streaked with red over all the body, a voluminous red mane and beard, and an eyepatch (with the symbol of a black star) covering his left eye. Whenever he utilizes beams from Limbo&#x27;s Moon*Star and the use of his Transformation Chamber, Mon*Star&#x27;s body becomes encased on spiked armor-plating as he recites &quot;Moon*Star of Limbo, give me the might, the muscle, the menace, of MON*STAR!&quot;. In this state, he temporarily regains his left eye with it able to fire the crimson Light Star beam which has various effects, destructive and stunning. Mon*Star has some bad blood with Stargazer due to their past conflicts and extends that animosity to the SilverHawks. Mon*Star appears in all but two episodes (episodes number 15 and 45) where Hardware and the Bounty Hunter are the villains respectively.
** Sky-Runner - A giant &quot;space-squid&quot; that serves as Mon*Star&#x27;s mode of transportation. One of Mon*Star&#x27;s beams is responsible for making rideable armor appear on Sky-Runner.
* Yes-Man (voiced by Bob McFadden) is Mon*Star&#x27;s all-purpose lackey, thrall, sycophant, or some combination thereof. As his name suggests, he is Mon*Star&#x27;s half-human half-snake sidekick who only ever agrees with Mon*Star. As a member of Mon*Star&#x27;s Mob, Yes-Man operates the Transformation Chamber. Yes-Man once used the powers of the Moon*Star alongside Mon*Star but did not change form. The Moon*Star primarily gave him increased mental abilities and ambition. This led to a feud between himself and his boss until the powers faded.
* Hardware (voiced by Bob McFadden) is the weapons specialist for Mon*Star&#x27;s Mob. He is an extremely intelligent, short but bulky, light, purple-skinned pink-haired creature who carries an oversized rucksack full of self-engineered weapons and equipment called a Roll-Up Bag. Mon*Star considers Hardware his most dangerous minion because of his talent for invention. On one occasion when Mon*Star was recaptured, he had to use the Moon*Star to empower a box that would enable Mon*Star to escape from Penal Planet 10.
* Melodia (voiced by Maggie Wheeler) is a musical mistress who serves as a nemesis and counterpart to the SilverHawks&#x27; Bluegrass, Melodia is the only female member of Mon*Star&#x27;s Mob. Melodia is usually seen cruising around in the Limbo Limo, causing havoc and assorted acts of terror as diversions. Melodia almost always carries a musical synthesizer (called a &quot;Sound Smasher&quot;) as a weapon. She is usually dressed in an exaggerated rock-singer outfit: two-shaded green hair; a short black dress; red belt with plug-up battery pack for &quot;Sound Smasher&quot;; long red fingerless gloves; half dark purple, half light pink tights; and dark blue glasses with a red &#x27;music note&#x27; frame.
* Windhammer (voiced by Doug Preis) is an eco-terrorist member of Mon*Star&#x27;s Mob with a large tuning fork that enables him to manipulate or generate destructive weather patterns either on a planet or in space. Examples of the weather that he has manipulated have included lightning and tornadoes. He is a muscular humanoid with azurine skin, long blonde hair, and large elf-like ears.
* Mo-Lec-U-Lar (voiced by Doug Preis) is a molecule-themed shapeshifter whose primary form is a humanoid body composed of many spheres in various copper shades. He serves as the master of disguise and leading hitman of Mon*Star&#x27;s Mob. Besides shapeshifting, Mo-Lec-U-Lar once became invisible in order to infiltrate the SilverHawks&#x27; base.
* Buzz-Saw (voiced by Bob McFadden) is a sentient war machine of a light copper-shade. Buzz-Saw has razor-sharp circular saw-cutting blades over his body that can be used as projectile weapons. He speaks with a high-pitched metallic voice.
* Poker-Face (voiced by Larry Kenney) is the robotic sunglasses-wearing money man of Mon*Star&#x27;s mob who has slot machines for eyes and carries a cane decorated with playing card suits. He is the owner of the Starship Casino. Poker-Face always charges Mon*Star billions for new inventive ideas against the SilverHawks.
* Mumbo-Jumbo (voiced by Peter Newman) is a copper-skinned robotic Minotaur who is the muscle for Mon*Star&#x27;s Mob. He is aided by his ability to &quot;bulk up&quot;, growing larger and more muscular, increasing his strength by doing so. He speaks in metallic grunts which his associates seem to understand (though he usually pronounces Mon*Star&#x27;s name properly) and appears to be on the low scale of the intellectual spectrum. His signature attack is a quadrupedal charge at an opponent. Mumbo-Jumbo is the sworn enemy of Steelheart because of Steelheart&#x27;s strength and skill which takes him down easily.
* Timestopper (voiced by Larry Kenney) is a cocky 14-year-old juvenile delinquent nyctophobe with a chest device that has the ability to suspend all ambient motion and kinetic energy around him for one Limbo-Minute. He is often in the services of Mon*Star, but has no qualms about getting in his way if he isn&#x27;t paid for the job. His nyctophobia is most likely from the fact his chest device is light-powered.
* Zero the Memory Thief (voiced by Peter Newman) is a long-nosed shady character who steals memories using a cattle prod-like weapon and records them on cassettes. He occasionally did business with Mon*Star&#x27;s gang when the opportunity suited him. While he can steal memories, he cannot the memorized data the way his victims can.
* Smiley is a mummified boxer robot that is brought back to life by Poker-Face. He was once stopped by Commander Stargazer. Smiley is the heavyweight champion of Limbo. He is operated by remote control. In the Starship Casino, Smiley easily defeats both Mumbo-Jumbo and Buzz-Saw, but later, he could not beat the SilverHawks.
* Darkbird (portrayed by Peter Newman) is an evil duplicate of Quicksilver who was created by Hardware.

=====The Mob&#x27;s Fighting Hawks=====
The Mob has Fighting Hawks of their own:

* Sky Shadow is Mon*Star Fighting Hawk who is a bat, rather than a bird where it has claws on its wings.
* Prowler is Hardware&#x27;s Fighting Hawk who actually resembles a green flying dragon. Its second form is a crowbar that is in Hardware&#x27;s Roll-Up Bag when not in use.
* Volt-Ure is Mo-Lec-U-Lar&#x27;s Fighting Hawk who shares the same abilities as him as well as the ability to generate a laser storm.
* Shredator is Buzz-Saw&#x27;s Fighting Hawk with razor wings. Like its owner, Shredator has a saw on its head.
* Airshock is Mumbo-Jumbo&#x27;s Fighting Hawk who can transform into a hammer for him to use.

====Three Outlaws from Fence====
They appear in many episodes and are friendly to Melodia and Poker-Face, though the three are usually betrayed by the Mob. They are often seen playing cards at the Sini*Star Diner on the planet Fence:

* The Space Bandit is the robotic leader of the Three Outlaws.
* Rhino (voiced by Peter Newman) is a rhinoceros-like mutant.
* Cyclops is a one-eyed balloon-bodied creature that is very weak. Whenever he was shot, he would lose air and fly around like a punctured balloon.

====Other villains====
* Bounty Hunter is a muscular monster with a face resembling a Bulldog with high, pointed ears. He has a sparkling laser on his head and a red star on his belt. He was imprisoned by Stargazer for 200 years but escaped twice (broken out once by Mon*Star in episode 22 and the second time on his own in episode 45). He can absorb energy directed at him and use it to sustain his physical form as well as grow larger and more powerful. He can only be defeated by the solar energy bazooka that Commander Stargazer has. He is extremely dangerous and powerful, as he has easily defeated all the original SilverHawks twice. He was stopped by Commander Stargazer and by the later SilverHawk Hotwing.
* Uncle Rattler (voiced by Peter Newman) is Yes-Man&#x27;s uncle who is from the same species as him. He only appears in his self-titled episode.

==Setting==
===The Galaxy of Limbo===
Even though it is in outer space, Limbo has breathable air and characters are seen falling off their vehicles as if in a gravity field. During the series, various planets are shown:

====Stars====
* Moon*Star of Limbo - A solid star, it gives Mon*star his powers to transform.

====Planets====
* Bedlama - A planet similar to Earth, though stars can be seen in its sky even during daytime. Hawk Haven is its satellite.
* Hawk Haven - The Silverhawks&#x27; base of operations. It orbits Bedlama.
* Brim*Star - A planet where Mon*Star&#x27;s mob operates. It is hollow with Mon*Star&#x27;s quarters inside it and accessible from the outside via a large star-shaped opening on its crust. The surface of Brimstar is like a giant ship junkyard.
* Automata - A factory-sized half-planet, controlled by a supercomputer named Monotone, which is the only sentient being on the planet.
* Dolar - A hollow gem-looking bank planet.
* Fence - A small planetoid with a bar, frequented by criminals.
* Hanging Rock - The Bounty Hunter&#x27;s planet. It is full of mountains and it has dangerous electro-rocks that absorb energy and feed it to the Bounty Hunter.

====Other====
* Starship Casino - Poker-Face&#x27;s space station where gambling takes place. It is stationed outside of the SilverHawks&#x27; jurisdiction, beyond &quot;the Lightyear Limit&quot;.
* The Artificial Sun is an antenna-looking device that performs all the functions of a sun and needs to be fueled frequently. It is run by Professor Power and has been the target of the Mob many times.
* Penal Planet 10 - a place where most criminals are kept. The Bounty Hunter and Smiley are there most of the time, but Hardware and Mon*star have been imprisoned there.

== Production and release ==
Rankin/Bass followed up their successful &quot;ThunderCats&quot; series with this series about a team of heroes in the 29th century who were given metal bodies and wings to stop organized crime in the Galaxy of Limbo. &quot;SilverHawks&quot; featured many of the same voice actors who had worked on &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, including Larry Kenney, Peter Newman, Earl Hammond, Doug Preis and Bob McFadden.

Lorimar-Telepictures was purchased by Warner Bros. in 1989, and the rights to &quot;SilverHawks&quot; are now held by Warner Bros. Television Distribution.

Reruns later aired on Cartoon Network from 2000 to 2001. The series is airing on METV Toons as of February 2025.

=== Episodes ===
== Merchandise and other media ==
=== DVD releases ===
In October 2008, Warner Home Video released &quot;SilverHawks: Volume 1&quot; on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. The 4-disc set contains the first 32 episodes of the series.

In October 2011, Warner Bros. released &quot;SilverHawks: Volume 2&quot; on DVD in region 1 via their Warner Archive Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner&#x27;s online store and Amazon.com. The 4-disc set contains the remaining 33 episodes of the series.

=== Action figures ===
The SilverHawks action figure collection based on the animated series was produced by Kenner and first released in 1987. LJN, the makers of the ThunderCats figures, originally were to produce the SilverHawks figures but decided to pass on the project at the last minute. Each figure was packaged with a companion bird and, similar to Kenner&#x27;s Super Powers Collection toyline, had an action feature of some type. The second series of figures is harder to find than the first with Ultrasonic Quicksilver being the most difficult. The MonStar with Laser Lance, Copper Kidd with Laser Discs, and the Copper Racer vehicle were not produced but were shown in the 1988 Kenner toy catalog. The Hawk Haven Fortress was also never released, due to the high production costs it would incur. Many recurring characters were never made, including Yes-Man, Melodia and Poker-Face.

==== Weapon-birds ====
The weapon-birds are cyborg animal companions released with most of the action figures. While Tally-Hawk appeared in almost all of the episodes in the series, all other &quot;weapon-birds&quot; only appeared in a handful of episodes. In the episode &quot;The Fighting Hawks&quot;, the weapon-birds for the Steel Twins were accidentally switched from the toy versions. The weapon-birds are listed below, with their toy partner&#x27;s name in parentheses.

* Tally-Hawk (Quicksilver)
* Side Man (Bluegrass)
* Rayzor (Steelheart)
* Stronghold (Steelwill)
* May-Day (Copper Kidd)
* Sly-Bird (Stargazer)
* Gyro (Hotwing)
* Backlash (Flashback)
* Tail-Spin (Moon Stryker)
* Jet Stream (Condor)
* Sky Shadow (Mon*Star) - a bat, rather than a bird
* Prowler (Hardware) - a green flying dragon
* Volt-Ure (Mo-Lec-U-Lar)
* Shredator (Buzz-Saw)
* Airshock (Mumbo-Jumbo)

In 2021, a new line of Silverhawks action figures were announced.

=== Other merchandise ===
Several other pieces of &quot;SilverHawks&quot; merchandise were released in the 1980s, including a board game, puzzles, bed sheets, and a plastic pencil pouch with the main characters on one side. Pajamas were also produced, which included wing flaps under the arms to more resemble the characters.

=== Comics ===

Marvel Comics&#x27; kid-friendly imprint Star Comics (which also published &quot;ThunderCats&quot;) released a seven-issue series. Writers included Steve Perry, who also wrote for the animated series.

=== Other appearances ===
In the 2011 &quot;ThunderCats&quot; remake, Mon*Star briefly appears in a cameo in the episode &quot;Legacy&quot;. He was seen on a monitor on the bridge of Mumm-Ra&#x27;s ship.

&quot;Solar Opposites&quot; features a lengthy subplot that parodies the IP called &quot;SilverCops&quot;.

===Reboot===
As of July 2021, a NacelleVerse reboot of &quot;Silverhawks&quot; is in development.

<text>Eric Russell Bentley (September 14, 1916 – August 5, 2020) was a British-born American theater critic, playwright, singer, editor, and translator. In 1998, he was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the New York Theater Hall of Fame, recognizing his many years of cabaret performances.

==Biography==
Bentley was born in Bolton, Lancashire, the son of Laura Evelyn and Fred Bentley. Bentley attended University College, Oxford, where his tutors were J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis; he received his degree in English in 1938. He subsequently attended Yale University (B. Litt. in 1939 and PhD in 1941), where he received the John Addison Porter Prize. Bentley taught History and Drama during the 1942 summer session at Black Mountain College, as well as from 1943 to 1944.

Beginning in 1953, he taught at Columbia University and was a theatre critic for &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He became known for his blunt style of theatre criticism, and was threatened with lawsuits from both Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller for his unfavorable reviews of their work. From 1960 to 1961, Bentley was the Charles Eliot Norton Professor at Harvard University.

Bentley was one of the preeminent experts on Bertolt Brecht, whom he met at the University of California, Los Angeles as a young man and whose work he translated extensively. He edited the Grove Press issue of Brecht&#x27;s work, and recorded two albums of Brecht&#x27;s songs for Folkways Records, most of which had never before been recorded in English.

In 1968, he signed the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

His play &quot;The Red, White, and Black&quot; was produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in 1971 in collaboration with the Columbia University School of the Arts Theatre Division. Beginning in 1975, Andrei Serban directed multiple productions of Bentley&#x27;s translation of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Good Woman of Setzuan&quot; at La MaMa, with music by Elizabeth Swados. The 1975 production was followed by a production in 1976 and another production in 1978. The Great Jones Repertory Company also took the show on tour to Europe in 1976.

Bentley was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969. That same year, he made his homosexuality public. In an interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on November 12, 2006, he said he was married twice before coming out at age 53, at which time he left his position as the Brander Matthews Professor of Dramatic Literature at Columbia to concentrate on his writing. He cited his homosexuality as an influence on his theater work, especially his play &quot;Lord Alfred&#x27;s Lover&quot;, based on the life of Oscar Wilde.

He won an Obie Award for Lifetime Achievement in Theatre from the American Theatre Wing in 2006 and a Robert Chesley Award in 2007.

Bentley became an American citizen in 1948 and had been living in New York City for many years at the time of his death. He turned 100 on September 14, 2016.

Bentley died at his home in Manhattan on August 5, 2020, at the age of 103.

==Selected works==
He wrote numerous books of theatre criticism. In addition, he edited &quot;The Importance of Scrutiny&quot; (1964), a collection from &quot;Scrutiny: A Quarterly Review&quot;, and &quot;Thirty Years of Treason: Excerpts from Hearings Before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, 1938–1968&quot; (1971). His most-produced play, &quot;Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been: The Investigations of Show-Business by the Un-American Activities Committee 1947–1958&quot; (1972), was based on the transcripts from the House Un-American Activities Committee collected in &quot;Thirty Years of Treason&quot;.

<doc id="1196796" wikidata="Q1115667" url="?curid=1196796" title="Saint Telemachus">
<text>Saint Telemachus (also Almachus or Almachius) was a monk who, according to the Church historian Theodoret, tried to stop a gladiatorial fight in a Roman amphitheatre, and was stoned to death by the crowd. The Christian Emperor Honorius, however, was impressed by the monk&#x27;s martyrdom and it spurred him to issue a historic ban on gladiatorial fights. Frederick George Holweck gives the year of his death as 391.

==Background==
He is described as being an ascetic who came to Rome from the East. The story is found in the writings of Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrrhus, Syria.

Although the site of Telemachus&#x27; martyrdom is often given as being the Colosseum in Rome, Theodoret does not actually specify where it happened, saying merely that it happened in &quot;the stadium&quot;.

Later retellings of the story have differed from Theodoret&#x27;s in a number of details. Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs claims that Telemachus was first stabbed to death by a gladiator, but that the sight of his death &quot;turned the hearts of the people&quot;.

There is also an alternative form of the story, in which Telemachus stood up in the amphitheatre and told the assembly to stop worshipping idols and offering sacrifices to the gods. Upon hearing this statement, the prefect of the city is said by this source to have ordered the gladiators to kill Telemachus, and they promptly did so.

<doc id="1196804" wikidata="Q7770873" url="?curid=1196804" title="Bal-musette">
<text>Bal-musette is a style of French instrumental music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1880s. Although it began with bagpipes as the main instrument, this instrument was eventually replaced by the accordion, on which a variety of waltzes, polkas, and other dance styles were played.

==History==
Auvergnats settled in large numbers in the 5th, 11th, and 12th districts (&quot;arrondissements&quot;) of Paris during the 19th century, opening cafés and bars where patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a &quot;musette&quot;) and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy). Parisian and immigrant Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement.

When Italians began introducing new rhythms like the waltz and polka into the traditional musical form and began playing it on the recently-introduced hybrid accordion, conflicts arose, and the Italian and Auvergnat styles split. By the end of 19th century, there were three kinds of &quot;bals-musette&quot; establishments:
*&quot;bal des familles&quot; – Auvergnat
*&quot;bal musette populaires&quot; – Italian
*&quot;guinche&quot; or &quot;bal de barrière&quot; – seedy hangouts frequented by low-lifes and so-called bohemians.

These places often were frequented by members of the French upper classes looking for excitement among the poor and downtrodden. Some establishments even staged mock police raids for their patrons&#x27; benefit. Performers of this era include Antoine Bouscatel, Émile Vacher, Martin Cayla, Charles Péguri, and Gus Viseur.

Musette dance forms arose from people looking for easier, faster and more sensual dance steps, as well as forms that did not require a large hall. &quot;Musette-forms&quot; that established themselves as variations to popular dances of the day include:
* tango-musette
* paso-musette
* valse-musette, with a special variation called &quot;la toupie&quot; (&quot;the top&quot;), where dancers are very close and turn around themselves very regularly.

An original musette dance also appeared, known as java.

Admission to most bals was free, but dancers bought dance tokens at the cash-desk. These tokens were made of metal in various shapes, with the name of the hall stamped on one side. In the middle of the dance, the bal director walked between the couples with a bag and the dancers turned in a token.

In the 1930s, gypsy jazz, a rhythmic form of swing music, drew on musette styles. By 1945, the bal-musette became the most popular style of dance in France and its biggest stars were widely known across the country. Its popularity declined drastically beginning around 1960. A revival of bals has begun, especially in larger cities, and a modern form of the musette is establishing itself.

<text>Frank Jeffrey Edson Smart (26 July 1921 – 20 June 2013) was an expatriate Australian painter known for his precisionist depictions of urban landscapes that are &quot;full of private jokes and playful allusions&quot;.

Smart was born and educated in Adelaide where he worked as an Art teacher. After departing for Europe in 1948 he studied in Paris at La Grande Chaumière, and later at the Académie Montmartre under Fernand Léger. He returned to Australia 1951, living in Sydney, and began exhibiting frequently in 1957. In 1963, he moved to Italy. After a successful exhibition in London, he bought a rural property called &quot;Posticcia Nuova&quot; near Arezzo in Tuscany. He resided there with his partner until his death. A major retrospective of his works travelled around Australian art galleries 1999–2000.

==Life==
Jeff Smart, as he was generally known for the first thirty years of his life, was born in Adelaide in 1921. He started drawing at an early age. &quot;My parents would give me large sheets of paper, often the backs of posters or calendars ... anything&quot;. He was educated at Pulteney Grammar School and Unley High School, and originally wanted to become an architect. However, after studying at the Adelaide Teachers College and the South Australian School of Art and Crafts in 1937–1941, he taught art in schools for the South Australian Education Department in 1942–1947. In the early 1940s he accompanied local maritime artist, John Giles, in painting industrial landscapes at Port Adelaide. He joined the Royal South Australian Society of Arts around 1941 and was elected vice-president in 1950.

Smart travelled to Europe in 1948, studying in Paris at La Grand Chaumière and later the Académie Montmartre under Fernand Léger. &quot;As my technique grew, I found I could paint those things I liked looking at, those slum streets behind the city apartments&quot;. In 1950 he lived on the island of Ischia in the bay of Naples, where he painted with Donald Friend, Michael Shannon and Jacqueline Hick.

In 1951, he moved to Sydney and spent the next 2 years there as an art critic for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper (1952–54), an arts compere called Phidias for the ABC children&#x27;s radio programme &quot;The Argonauts&quot;, and a drawing teacher at the National Art School (1956–62). From 1956 to 1962, he also presented on ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. Smart was also employed by The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta in 1954–56 as an art teacher, following Jean Bellette (known there as Mrs Haefliger) and John Passmore. He exhibited throughout this period at the Macquarie Galleries.

Smart departed Australia for London on the &quot;Castel Felice&quot; out of Sydney just after Christmas 1963, driving to Greece with fellow painter Justin O&#x27;Brien. In 1965 he returned to Italy, and lived there for the rest of his life, regarding himself as an &quot;Australian living abroad&quot; and carrying an Australian passport. His last work, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, was completed in 2011, at which point he announced his retirement.

Smart died of renal failure in Arezzo on 20 June 2013, aged 91.

== Influences and artistic style ==
Smart is one of Australia&#x27;s best known artists with his almost iconic and unique imagery, heavily influenced by various artists and art forms. His stark portrayals of contemporary life, both realistic and absurd, have been the basis of many artistic discussions. Critics and admirers of Smart&#x27;s paintings often debate his subject matter but in interviews Smart has preferred not to discuss his style; &quot;Leaving the interpretation as the prerogative of the individual viewer.&quot; Smart states that he &quot;paints a picture because he likes the shape&quot;, and when asked why his skies are always so gloomy and smog-laden or why his faces never wear a smile, he claims &quot;I need a dark sky for the composition, because pale blue at the top of a frame looks nothing ... [and] because a smiling face is too hard to paint&quot;.

Smart&#x27;s unsentimental paintings encompass lonely urban vistas that seem both disturbing and threatening. Isolated individuals seem lost in industrial wastelands, full of high rise construction, concrete street-scapes and an eerie feeling of harmony and equilibrium – where silence and stillness create a deathly ambience. &#x27;The express rape of the landscape&#x27; is one title hanging over Smart&#x27;s paintings, referring to the freeways, street signs, trucks, oil drums, containers, buildings and concrete dividers that are the ever-present subjects of his work. At the same time his paintings – full of bold colours and perfect symmetry – are beautiful. The repetition of road signs in his works, for example, suggest an inconclusive direction and a world outside the frame is tantalising suggested.

Figures are present in many of Smart&#x27;s paintings. These are said to be &quot;impassive observers, reconciled to the contemporary state of things, prepared to accommodate themselves to an increasingly impersonal environment&quot; or as &quot;statements on the dehumanising conformity of modern architecture and social painting&quot;. According to Smart however, &quot;the truth is I put figures in mainly for scale&quot;. It is Smart&#x27;s precise and unequalled attention to clean lines, composition and geometrics that make his eye-catching paintings stand-out &quot;in the story of modern Australian art&quot;. &quot;The subject matter is only the hinge that opens the door, the hook on which hangs a coat. My only concern is putting the right shapes in the right colours in the right places. It is always the geometry&quot;.

Under the tutorship lessons of modernist artist, Dorrit Black, Smart acquainted himself with the &#x27;Golden Mean.&#x27; Also referred to as &#x27;the golden ratio&#x27;, &#x27;the divine proportion&#x27;, &#x27;the mean of Phidias&#x27; and a number of other names, it has been used since ancient Greek times in many works of art and architecture. The golden mean is a geometric proportion, the ratio of which is approximately 1:1.618. This complex network of interlocking rectangles, triangles and diagonal lines, is used to calculate the structure of Smart&#x27;s paintings, which form the basis of all his artworks. For Smart, geometry and precision of the composition is the key to successful art, much like how comedic timing is the key to the effectiveness of a punch line. &quot;Today&#x27;s most prevalent myth is that Smart&#x27;s work has no content: that everything is a compositional exercise devoted to capturing a formal ideal of beauty&quot;.

=== Smart&#x27;s surrealism ===

Smart&#x27;s paintings have been referred to as &#x27;surreal&#x27;, but Smart contended that it was the modern urban world that was surreal and not his depictions of it. &quot;I find myself moved by man in his new violent environment. I want to paint this explicitly and beautifully ... only very recently have artists again started to comment on their real surroundings&quot;.

Some critics have argued that Smart&#x27;s work comments on modern urban alienation, a post-industrial landscape that has fallen from human control. Others have cast him as a realist, hyper-realist, &#x27;off-beat classicalist&#x27; and a metaphysical painter. Some critics have even referred to Smart&#x27;s paintings as portraying &#x27;Orwellian gloom&#x27; – a statement referring, in particular, to George Orwell&#x27;s literary political masterpiece, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. James Gleeson believes that Smart&#x27;s paintings are &quot;too real to be real&quot;; and believes that his realist portrayals of 20th century life are nothing more than superb geometrical compositions and bold colour, of man in his naturalistic, man-made environment. It is true, for instance, that trees are rarely seen in Jeffrey Smart&#x27;s artworks, and the only grass is that growing between concrete stones, but as Smart claimed: &quot;an artist has to be moved to move his viewers&quot;, and Smart was moved by man in nature – man-made nature – not concerned with typical Australian landscape. &quot;I like living in the 20th century – to me the world has never been more beautiful. I am trying to paint the real world I live in, as beautifully as I can with my own eyes... It&#x27;s obvious a bunch of flowers or a billabong is beautiful, and I love natural beauty, but I am not moved by it. ... to me composition is everything&quot;. Smart believed that people should view art with their eyes and not their head.

=== Influences ===
Smart&#x27;s paintings may seem to visit an untouched area of art, but he has been influenced by other artists and art forms, especially from classical ancient art through his travels. An interest in architecture took Smart to Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Italy and Yemen. This Mediterranean journey led to the purchase of a three-hundred-year-old villa in Arezzo, Italy where he lived for the rest of his long life. It had in fact, always been an early goal for Smart was to become an architect; he was trained as a draftsman and sometimes considered himself in some ways a frustrated architect.

Piero della Francesca, a Renaissance painter and mathematician, was one of classical influences on Smart&#x27;s work. Smart said that seeing Piero&#x27;s works was &quot;like falling in love.&quot; His favourite of Piero&#x27;s paintings was The Flagellation of Christ. He shared with Piero, in addition to the geometrics and composition, the spatial grandeur and &#x27;ineloquence&#x27; found present in each of their works. He was also influenced by Renaissance Dutch painter Rogier van der Weyden. Despite Smart&#x27;s identification with the ancient art and architecture of the renaissance period, he likes to be recognised as a contemporary artist, not a &#x27;classical revivalist&#x27;.

The two modernist realists who have had immense impact on Smart&#x27;s paintings, are Alex Colville and Edward Hopper. Like Smart, Hopper painted &quot;Human beings&#x27; values being swallowed by 20th century industrial society&quot; and Hopper &quot;shows that, even though communication and transportation have never been so accessible, the individual is somehow left behind in the rush&quot;. In his work, Hopper focuses on &quot;eerily realistic depictions of solitude in contemporary American life&quot;, works of similar appearance to Smart&#x27;s. Like Hopper&#x27;s, Smart&#x27;s paintings have been compared to post-war Italian movie stills of the 1950s and sixties – where beauty is poetically captured in the &#x27;humdrum&#x27; Italian cities. Alex Colville painted desolate landscape settings with lonely characters, and used much the same geometric underpinning and bold colours.

==Technique==

Smart regarded being able to draw the human being as the single most important attainment of any artist. When asked why none of the people in his pictures are ever painted smiling, he said that he could not draw smiles well. Unlike many primarily landscape artists, he could paint both the human form and the human face, as can be seen in his self-portrait work. He regarded abstract painters as people who never learnt to draw. Smart mostly painted with oil, acrylic and watercolours, generally using the bold primary colours – yellow, blue and red – and dark greys for his skies. This created an unusual effect in his works as the foregrounds of his paintings are fully lit despite the dark sky. His process of painting was a long and arduous one, resulting in barely a dozen finished canvases a year. &quot;I always do a lot of preliminary drawings, moving the forms, the shadows, the buildings the figures around the canvas till I get that perfect composition ...&quot;

Much of Smart&#x27;s direct artistic stimulation came from, literally, a passing glance as he was driving: &quot;My paintings have their origins in a passing glance&quot;. &quot;Sometimes I&#x27;ll drive around for months ... despair, nothing, nothing, then suddenly I will see something that seizes me: a shape, a combination of shapes, a play of light or shadows and I send up a prayer because I know I have the gem of a picture.&quot;

== Images ==
Smart was a prolific artist; in the period 1939–82 he produced at least 800 works, and was still producing new works in 2011 (at the age of 90). The following is a small selection of Smart&#x27;s work, arranged in chronological order.

==Documentaries==
Smart&#x27;s work and life have been the subject of several documentaries, the most recent, titled &quot;Master of Stillness&quot;, by filmmaker Catherine Hunter.

&quot;Master of Stillness&quot; records the creation of &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (2011), Smart&#x27;s final work before retiring aged 91. Critic John McDonald calls it &quot;a farewell picture – a last definitive statement that rules a line under a long and distinguished career&quot;. Curator, author and critic Barry Pearce, interviewed in the film, says of &quot;Labyrinth&quot;: &quot;It is a kind of arrival at the painting he was always chasing, never satisfied, hoping the next one on the easel would be the elusive masterpiece, the one that said it all.&quot; Hunter visited Smart at his farmhouse in Tuscany and the painter took her to some of the places near Arezzo that have long inspired him – the concrete streetscapes and urban wastelands that define his vision. &quot;If a good painting comes off, it has a stillness, it has a perfection, and that&#x27;s as great as anything that I think a musician or a poet can do&quot;, said Smart.

==Honours and awards==

Jeffrey Street in Hawthorn, South Australia, was named after Smart by his father who was involved in the sub-division of that area. In his memoir, &quot;Not Quite Straight&quot;, Smart comments that there is a bend in Jeffrey Street, and hence it, too, is &quot;Not Quite Straight&quot;.

In 1951, Smart was awarded the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Prize. He was conferred the honorary title of Doctor of the University by the University of Sydney in 1999, and by the University of South Australia in 2011.

Smart was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2001 for his service to the visual arts, particularly through his distinctive portrayal of the urban landscape, and through the encouragement offered to young artists.

Jeffrey Smart was a patron and active supporter of the Tait Memorial Trust in London, a charity established by Isla Baring OAM, the daughter of Sir Frank Tait of JC Williamson&#x27;s, to support young Australian performing artists in the UK.

Following his death, the University of South Australia announced on 21 June 2013 that the newest building at its City West campus, to be opened in 2014, would be named the &quot;Jeffrey Smart Building&quot;.

<doc id="1196846" wikidata="Q3920209" url="?curid=1196846" title="Spic">
<text>Spic (or spick, spik) is an ethnic slur used in the United States to describe Hispanic and Latino Americans or Spanish-speaking people from Latin America, usually used toward Puerto Ricans. 

==Etymology and history==
Some sources from the United States believe that the word &quot;spic&quot; is a play on a Spanish-accented pronunciation of the English word &quot;speak&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; takes &quot;spic&quot; to be a contraction of the earlier form &quot;spiggoty&quot;. The oldest known use of &quot;spiggoty&quot; is in 1910 by Wilbur Lawton in &quot;Boy Aviators in Nicaragua, or, In League with the Insurgents&quot;. Stuart Berg Flexner, in &quot;I Hear America Talking&quot; (1976), favored the explanation that it derives from &quot;no spik Ingles&quot; (or &quot;no spika de Ingles,&quot; both Spanish ways of informing a speaker that you can not speak English). 

However, in an earlier publication, the 1960 &quot;Dictionary of American Slang&quot;, written by Dr. Harold Wentworth, with Flexner as second author, &quot;spic&quot; is first identified as a noun for an Italian or &quot;American of Italian ancestry&quot;, along with the words &quot;spic&quot;, &quot;spig&quot;, and &quot;spiggoty&quot;, and confirms that it is shortened from the word &quot;spaghetti.&quot; The authors refer to the word&#x27;s usage in James M. Cain&#x27;s &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, referring to a &quot;wop or spig&quot;, and say that this term was never preferred over &quot;wop&quot;, and has been rarely used since 1915. However, the etymology remains. 

This slur is most commonly directed towards Puerto Ricans.

<doc id="1196847" wikidata="Q2377924" url="?curid=1196847" title="Women in Hinduism">
<text>Diverse views on women and their roles exist within Hinduism. The Devi Sukta hymn of the Rigveda declares feminine energy to be the essence of the universe, the one who creates all matter and consciousness, the eternal and infinite, the metaphysical and empirical reality (Brahman), the soul (supreme self) of everything. The woman is celebrated as the most powerful and empowering force in some Hindu Upanishads, Sastras and Puranas, particularly the Devi Upanishad, Devi Mahatmya and Devi-Bhagavata Purana.
Ancient and medieval era Hindu texts differ in their positions on the duties and rights of women. The texts describe eight kinds of marriage, including consensual arranged marriage (Brahma or Devic), unceremonial marriage by mutual agreement (Gandharva) and rape, considered sinful (Paishacha). Scholars state that Vedic-era Hindu texts did not mention dowry or sati, which likely became widespread in the second millenium AD. Throughout history, Hindu society has seen many female rulers, such as Rudramadevi, religious figures and saints, such as Andal, philosophers, such as Maitreyi, and female practitioners/conductors of Vedic Hindu rituals.

Hinduism, states Bryant, has the strongest presence of the divine feminine among major world religions, from ancient times to the present. There are major goddess-centric Hindu traditions and denominations, such as Shaktism. Numerous matriarchal Hindu communities exist.

== Ancient texts ==

===Vedic literature===
Verses of ancient texts show that Vedism expounds reverence for the feminine. Like of the 10th chapter of the Rigveda, the part that has long been included here, is one that asserts the feminine to be the supreme principle behind all of cosmos.

The following hymn is called &quot;Devi Sukta&quot;,

;Upanishads
The &quot;Devi Sukta&quot; ideas of the Rigveda are further developed in the relatively later composed Shakta Upanishads, states McDaniel, where the Devi asserts that she is Brahman, from her arise Prakṛti (matter) and Purusha (consciousness), she is bliss and non-bliss, the Vedas and what is different from it, the born and the unborn, and the feminine is thus all of the universe. She is presented as all the five elements, as well as all that is different from these elements, what is above, what is below, what is around, and thus the universe in its entirety. This philosophy is also found in the &quot;Tripuratapani Upanishad&quot; and the &quot;Bahvricha Upanishad&quot;.

The early Upanishads are, however, generally silent about women and men, and focus predominantly on gender-less Brahman and its relation to Atman (Soul, Self). There are occasional exceptions. &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;, composed about 800 BCE, for example, in the last chapter detailing the education of a student, include lessons for his Grihastha stage of life. There, the student is taught, that as a husband, he should cook rice for the wife, and they together eat the food in certain way depending on whether they wish for the birth of a daughter or a son, as follows,

Women are mentioned and are participants in the philosophical debates of the Upanishads, as well as scholars, teachers and priestesses during the Vedic and early Buddhist age. Among women acknowledged in the Upanishads are Gargi and Maitreyi. In Sanskrit, the word &quot;acharyā&quot; means a &quot;female teacher&quot; (versus &quot;acharya&quot; meaning &quot;teacher&quot;) and an &quot;acharyini&quot; is a teacher&#x27;s wife, indicating that some women were known as gurus.

Female characters appear in plays and epic poems. The 8th century poet, Bhavabhuti describes in his play, &quot;Uttararamacharita&quot; (verse 2–3), how the character, Atreyi, travelled to southern India where she studied the &quot;Vedas&quot; and Indian philosophy. In Madhava&#x27;s &quot;Shankaradigvijaya&quot;, Shankara debates with the female philosopher, Ubhaya Bharati and in verses 9–63 it is mentioned that she was well versed in the &quot;Vedas&quot;. Tirukkoneri Dasyai, a 15th-century scholar, wrote a commentary on Nammalvar&#x27;s &quot;Tiruvaayamoli&quot;, with reference to Vedic texts such as the &quot;Taittiriya Yajurveda&quot;.

===The Hindu historical epics===

In the two Hindu historical epics, &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the role of women is multiple. The main female character in the Mahabharata, Draupadi is married to all the five Pandavas due to Mata Kunti&#x27;s directive to distribute without seeing what has been brought by Pandavas, thus had five husbands. She is insulted by Duryodhana, but Lord Krishna came to her rescue. This insult was one of the main reasons for the great war in restoring the honor of their woman. In the Ramayana, Sita is respected, honored, portrayed as wise and seen as inseparable from Rama and beloved but lived as a homemaker, the ideal wife and partner to Rama. While in the Adbhut Ramayana Sita is the most powerful and the destroyer of evil. In the Hindu dharma, women&#x27;s oral readings of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; at home bring peace, happiness, good progeny, good health and relives family from bad luck and bad health.
The Epics are divinely ordained to Rishis and seen thru divinely vision, and carry precepts of dharma embedded in them, suggesting perceived notions about women in Hinduism at the time the Epics were composed. The Mahabharata, in Book 1, for example, states,

The Anushasana Parva of the Hindu epic Mahabharata has several chapters dedicated to the discussion about duties and right of women. It gives a mixed picture. In chapter 11, the goddess of wealth and prosperity Lakshmi asserts, that she ( her divinity) lives in those women who are truthful, sincere, modest, organized, devoted to their husband and children, health conscious, patient and kind to parents, parent in laws and guests. The goddess asserts she does not reside in woman who is sinful, unclean, always disagreeing with her husband, has no patience or fortitude, is lazy, quarrelsome with her neighbors and relatives.

In chapter 47, as Yudhishthira seeks guidance on Dharma from Bhishma, the Anushasana Parva compares the value of daughter to a son, as follows,
The duties of women are again recited in Chapter 146, as a conversation between god Shiva and his wife goddess Uma, where Shiva asks what are the duties of women. Devi Uma (Parvati) proceeds to meet all the rivers, who are all goddesses that nourish and create fertile valleys. Uma suggests that the duties of women include being of a good disposition, endued with sweet speech, sweet conduct, and sweet features, but at the same time be capable to sustain her own life( which can require being tough) if situation comes. For a woman, claims Uma, her husband is a God( and vice versa), her husband is her friend, and her husband is her high refuge(and vice versa). A woman&#x27;s duties include physical and emotional nourishment, reverence and fulfillment of her husband and her children. Their happiness is her happiness, she observes the same vows as those that are observed by her husband, her duty is to be cheerful even when her husband or her children are angry, be there for them in adversity or sickness, is regarded as truly righteous in her conduct. Beyond her husband and family, her duty is to be cheerful of heart and humble with friends and relatives, do the best she can for friends and guests. Her family life and her home is her heaven, tells goddess Parvati to Shiva.
Anushasana Parva has served as a source for modern era texts on women in Hinduism. For example, Tryambakayajvan of Thanjavur, in the 18th century CE, published &quot;Strīdharmapaddhati&quot; (or &quot;Guide for a Dharmic Woman&quot;). Tryambaka, according to Julia Leslie, selectively extracts verses from many chapters of Anushasana Parva. He selectively extracts verses from other books of the Mahabharata as well, and other ancient Indian texts, for &quot;Strīdharmapaddhati&quot;, choosing those he preferred, omitting verses from the Mahabharata that represent its characteristic style of presenting many voices and counter-arguments.

===Shastras and Smritis===
The characterization and treatment of women is mixed in Shastras and Smriti texts of Hinduism. Scholars have questioned the later date insertions, corruption and authenticity of the texts, as dozens of significantly different versions of the Smriti texts have been found. Patrick Olivelle for example, who is credited with a 2005 translation of Manusmriti published by the Oxford University Press, states the concerns in postmodern scholarship about the presumed authenticity and reliability of Manusmriti manuscripts. He writes (abridged),

Arthashastra, in chapter 1.21 describes women who had received military education and served to protect the king; the text also mentions female artisans, mendicants, and women who were wandering ascetics.

One of the most studied about the position of women in medieval Hindu society has been a now contested Calcutta manuscript of Manusmriti. The text preaches chastity to widows such as in verses 5.158–5.160. In verses 2.67–2.69 and 5.148–5.155, Manusmriti preaches that as a girl, she should respect and seek protection of her father, as a young woman her husband, and as a widow her son and should receive the same respect from them as well, and that a woman should always worship her husband as a god and vice-versa.

In other verses, Manusmriti respects and safeguards women rights. Manusmriti in verses 3.55–3.56, for example, declares that &quot;women must be honored and adorned&quot;, and &quot;where women are revered, there the gods rejoice; but where they are not, no sacred rite bears any fruit&quot;. Elsewhere, in verses 5.147–5.148, states Olivelle, the text declares, &quot;a woman must never seek to live independently&quot;.

====Divorce====
The text declares that a marriage cannot be dissolved by a woman or a man, in verse 8.101–8.102. Yet, the text, in other sections, allows either to dissolve the marriage. For example, verses 9.72–9.81 allow the man or the woman to get out of a fraudulent marriage or an abusive marriage, and remarry; the text also provides legal means for a woman to remarry when her husband has been missing or has abandoned her.

Arthashastra is a Mauryan era text on governance. However, it is not a religious Hindu book per se. Rather, it is an irreligious and secular book on governance to help and guide the Mauryan Emperors. Its author, Kautilya, argued in favour of a secular state based on dharma, a word which means &quot;righteousness&quot; in Sanskrit (often mistranslated as &quot;religion&quot;). It states:

A woman, hating her husband, can not dissolve her marriage with him against his will. Nor can a man dissolve his marriage with his wife against her will. But from mutual enmity, divorce may be obtained (parasparam dveshánmokshah). If a man, apprehending danger from his wife desires divorce (mokshamichhet), he shall return to her whatever she was given (on the occasion of her marriage). If a woman, under the apprehension of danger from her husband, desires divorce, she shall forfeit her claim to her property; marriages contracted in accordance with the customs of the first four kinds of marriages cannot be dissolved.

====Varna====

The text in one section opposes a woman marrying someone outside her own (varna) as in verses 3.13–3.14. Simultaneously, states Olivelle, the text presupposes numerous practices such as marriages outside varna, such as between a Brahmin man and a Shudra woman in verses 9.149–9.157, a widow getting pregnant with a child of a man she is not married to in verses 9.57–9.62, marriage where a woman in love elopes with her man, and then grants legal rights in these cases such as property inheritance rights in verses 9.143–9.157, and the legal rights of the children so born. The text also presumes that a married woman may get pregnant by a man other than her husband, and dedicates verses 8.31–8.56 to conclude that the child&#x27;s custody belongs to the woman and her legal husband, and not to the man she got pregnant with.

====Property rights====
Manusmriti provides a woman with property rights to six types of property in verses 9.192–9.200. These include those she received at her marriage, or as gift when she eloped or when she was taken away, or as token of love before marriage, or as gifts from her biological family, or as received from her husband subsequent to marriage, and also from an inheritance from deceased relatives.

====Inconsistency and authenticity issues====
Scholars state that less than half, or only 1,214 of the 2,685 verses in Manusmriti, may be authentic. Further, the verses are internally inconsistent. Verses such as 3.55–3.62 of Manusmriti, for example, glorify the position of women, while verse such as 9.3 and 9.17 do the opposite. Mahatma Gandhi, when asked about his view about the Smriti, stated, that &quot;there are so many contradictions in the printed volume that, if you accept one part, you are bound to reject those parts that are wholly inconsistent with it. (...) Nobody is in possession of the original text [of Manusmriti].

Flavia Agnes states that Manusmriti is a complex commentary from women&#x27;s rights perspective, and the British colonial era codification of women&#x27;s rights based on it for Hindus, and from Islamic texts for Muslims, picked and emphasized certain aspects while it ignored other sections. This construction of personal law during the colonial era created a legal fiction around Manusmriti&#x27;s historic role as a scripture in matters relating to women in South Asia.

=== Puranas ===

The Puranas, particularly the Devi Mahatmya found in Markandeya Maha-Purana, and the Devi-Bhagavata Purana have some of the most dedicated discussion of Devi and sacred feminine in late ancient and early medieval era of Hinduism. However, the discussion is not limited to these two major Hindu Goddess religion-related texts. Women are found in philosophical discussions across numerous other Puranas and extant era texts. For example, Parvati in a discussion with her husband Shiva, remarks:

Feminine symbolism as being sacred and for reverence were present in ancient Hindu texts, but these were fragmentary states Brown, and it was around the sixth century CE, possibly in northwest India, that the concept of Maha-Devi coalesced as the Great Goddess, appearing in the text of Devi Mahatmya of Markandeya Purana. This development of the divine woman was not theoretical, according to Brown, but has impacted &quot;self understanding of Hindus to the present day&quot; and &quot;what it means to be human in a universe that is infinite and yet is pervaded by the very human quality of a woman&#x27;s care and anger&quot;. Devi Mahatmya, also called &quot;Durga Saptasati&quot; (or 700 verses to Durga), has been enormously popular among Hindus through the centuries, states Coburn. Devi Mahatmya does not attempt to prove that the female is supreme, but assumes it as a given and its premise. This idea influenced the role of women in Hinduism in the Puranic texts that followed for centuries, where male-dominated and female-dominated couples appear, in various legends, in the same religious text and Hindu imagination.

The Devi Mahatmya presents the idea, states McDaniel, of a divine she who creates this universe, is the supreme knowledge, who helps herself and men reach final liberation, she is multitasking who in times of prosperity is Lakshmi brings wealth and happiness to human homes, yet in times of adversity feeds and fights the battle as the angry woman destroying demons and evil in the universe after metamorphosing into Durga, Chandika, Ambika, Bhadrakali, Ishvari, Bhagvati, Sri or Devi. However, notes Brown, the celebration of the goddess as supreme in Devi Mahatmya is not universal in Hindu texts of 1st millennium CE, and other Puranic texts celebrate the god as supreme, while acknowledging supreme goddess in various chapters and presenting the female as the &quot;effective power behind any male&quot; either in mythological sense or theological sense or both.

The ideas of the 6th-century Devi Mahatmya are adopted in 11th-century text of Devi-Bhagavata Purana, another goddess-classic text of Shakti tradition of Hinduism. However, this text emphasizes devotion and love as the path to her supreme nature as goddess. In the latter text, Devi appears as a warrior goddess destroying demons, a world-mother nurturing the good, as the creator, the sustainer and the destroyer as different aspects of her, the one supreme.

== Gender of God ==
In Hinduism, specifically in the Advaita Vedanta, the impersonal Absolute (Brahman) is genderless. Both male gods (Deva) and female gods (Devi) are found in Hinduism. But many Shaktism and other sects describes the main ultimate God is as feminine energy (The Mother Goddess &#x27;Shakti&#x27; ; shakti translates to, 𝘭𝘪𝘵.Power and strength) and relates it with a mother being the most important and ultimate God and all the creation is through her. Some Hindu traditions conceive God as androgynous (both female and male), or as either male or female, while cherishing gender henotheism, that is without denying the existence of other Gods in either gender.

Bhakti traditions of Hinduism have both gods and goddesses. In ancient and medieval Indian mythology, each masculine deva of the Hindu pantheon is partnered with a feminine devi. Followers of Shaktism, worship the goddess Devi as the embodiment of &quot;Shakti&quot; (feminine strength or power).

The popular misconception that there exist millions of Hindu deities, all the deities are personification of different aspects related to life and universe (God as trees, Ocean rivers, Mountains, Ocean, The Sun, The Moon, The 8 planets, The Milky way Galaxy, etc.). However, most, by far, are goddesses (&quot;Shakti, Devi,&quot; or mother), state Foulston and Abbott, suggesting &quot;how important and popular goddesses are&quot; in Hindu culture. Though in general, they are smaller, there are far more goddess temples than those of gods. Goddesses are most of the time, if not always seen as powerful, and when unmarried, seen as dangerous (to the evil). Despite the patriarchal nature of post modern Hindu society, women are seen as powerful alongside the Gods, and at certain times, dangerous. No one has a list of the millions of goddesses and gods, but all deities, state scholars, are typically viewed in Hinduism as &quot;emanations or manifestation of gender-less principle called Brahman, representing the many facets of Ultimate Reality&quot;. In Hinduism, &quot;God, the universe, all beings [male, female] and all else are essentially one thing,&quot; and are interconnected, depicting their oneness and the same god manifested in every being as Atman, the eternal Self.

Ancient and medieval Hindu literature, state scholars, is richly endowed with gods, goddesses and androgynous representations of God. This, states Gross, is in contrast with several monotheistic religions, where God is often synonymous with &quot;He&quot; and theism is replete with male anthropomorphisms. In Hinduism, goddess-imagery does not mean loss of male-god, rather the ancient literature presents the two genders as balancing each other and complementary. The Goddesses in Hinduism, states Gross, are strong, beautiful and confident, symbolizing their vitality in the cycle of life. While masculine Gods are symbolically represented as those who act, the feminine Goddesses are symbolically portrayed as those who inspire action. Goddesses in Hinduism are envisioned as the patrons of arts, culture, nurture, learning, arts, joys, spirituality and liberation.

== Dignity ==

Hinduism does not regard Women as lacking dignity, therefore there are not many specific quotes about affirming women&#x27;s dignity. However, there are many references in the primary and secondary Hindu texts that affirm the dignity of women. Many stories from the Upanishads of female scholars, such as Jābālā&#x27;s tale, Maitreyi, Gārgī, Lopāmudrā, and Haimavatī Umā, demonstrate the dignity accorded to Women. According to verse 6.4.17 from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the birth of a female child who would be scholar is desired. The quote prescribes the specific rituals for obtaining a learned daughter.Verse 6.4.17 Brihadaranyaka Upanishad:अथ य इच्छेद्दुहिता मे पण्डिता जायेत, सर्वमायुरियादिति, तिलौदनं पाचयित्वा सर्पिष्मन्तमश्नीयाताम्; ईश्वरौ जनयितवै ॥ १७ ॥atha ya icchedduhitā me paṇḍitā jāyeta, sarvamāyuriyāditi, tilaudanaṃ pācayitvā sarpiṣmantamaśnīyātām; īśvarau janayitavai || 17 ||&quot;One who wishes that a daughter should be born who would be a scholar and attain a full term of life, should have rice cooked with sesamum, and both should eat it with clarified butter. Then the creators (would-be parents) would indeed be able to produce such a daughter.&quot;

Will Durant (1885–1981) American historian says in his book &quot;Story of Civilization&quot;:Women enjoyed far greater freedom in the Vedic period than in later India. She had more to say in the choice of her mate than the forms of marriage might suggest. She appeared freely at feasts and dances, and joined with men in religious sacrifice. She could study, and like Gargi, engage in philosophical disputation. If she was left a widow there were no restrictions upon her remarriage.
== Practices ==

===Marriage===
The &quot;Asvalayana Grhyasutra&quot; text of Hinduism identifies eight forms of marriages. Of these first four – Brahma, Daiva, Arsha and Prajapatya – are declared appropriate and recommended by the text, next two – Gandharva and Asura – are declared inappropriate but acceptable, and the last two – Rakshasa and Paishacha – are declared evil and unacceptable (but any children resulting were granted legal rights).

#&quot;Brahma&quot; marriage – considered the religiously most appropriate marriage, where the father finds an educated man, proposes the marriage of his daughter to him. The groom, bride, and families willingly concur with the proposal. The two families and relatives meet, the girl is ceremoniously decorated, the father gifts away his daughter in betrothal, and a Vedic marriage ceremony is conducted. This type of wedding is now most prevalent among Hindus in modern India.
#&quot;Daiva&quot; marriage – in this type of marriage, the father gives away his daughter along with ornaments to a priest.
#&quot;Arsha&quot; marriage – in this type of marriage, the groom gives a cow and a bull to the father of the bride and the father exchanges his daughter in marriage. The groom took a vow to fulfill his obligations to the bride and family life (Grihasthashram).
#&quot;Prajapatya&quot; marriage – in this type of marriage, a couple agree to get married by exchanging some Sanskrit mantras (vows to each other). This form of marriage was akin to a civil ceremony.
# &quot;Gandharva&quot; marriage – in this type of marriage, the couple simply lives together out of love, by mutual consent, consensually consummating their relationship. This marriage is entered into without religious ceremonies, and was akin to the Western concept of Common-law marriage. Kama Sutra, as well as Rishi Kanva – the foster-father of Shakuntala – in the Mahabharata, claimed this kind of marriage to be an ideal one.
# &quot;Asura&quot; marriage – in this type of marriage, the groom offered a dowry to the father of the bride and the bride, both accepted the dowry out of free will, and he received the bride in exchange. This was akin to marrying off a daughter for money. This marriage was considered inappropriate by Hindu Smriti-writers because greed, not what is best for the girl, can corrupt the selection process. Manusmriti verses 3.51 and 3.52, for example, states that a father or relatives must never accept any brideprice because that amounts to trafficking of the daughter.
# &quot;Rakshasa&quot; marriage – where the groom forcibly abducted the girl against her and her family&#x27;s will. The word &quot;Rakshasa&quot; means &#x27;devil&#x27;.
# &quot;Paishacha&quot; marriage – where the man forces himself on a woman when she is insentient, that is drugged or drunken or unconscious.

James Lochtefeld finds that the last two forms of marriage were forbidden yet recognized in ancient Hindu societies, not to encourage these acts, but to provide the woman and any children with legal protection in the society.

=== Dowry ===
The concept and practice of dowry in ancient and medieval Hindu society is unclear. Some scholars believe dowry was practiced in historic Hindu society, but some do not. Historical eyewitness reports (discussed below), suggest dowry in pre-11th century CE Hindu society was insignificant, and daughters had inheritance rights, which by custom were exercised at the time of her marriage.

Stanley J. Tambiah states the ancient Code of Manu sanctioned dowry and bridewealth in ancient India, but dowry was the more prestigious form and associated with the Brahmanic (priestly) caste. Bridewealth was restricted to the lower castes, who were not allowed to give dowry. He cites two studies from the early 20th century with data to suggest that this pattern of dowry in upper castes and bridewealth in lower castes has persisted through the first half of the 20th century.

Michael Witzel, in contrast, states the ancient Indian literature suggests dowry practices were not significant during the Vedic period. Witzel also notes that women in ancient India had property inheritance rights either by appointment or when they had no brothers. Kane states ancient literature suggests bridewealth was paid only in the asura-type of marriage that was considered reprehensible and forbidden by Manu and other ancient Indian scribes. Lochtefeld suggests that religious duties listed by Manu and others, such as &#x27;the bride be richly adorned to celebrate marriage&#x27; were ceremonial dress and jewelry along with gifts that were her property, not property demanded by or meant for the groom; Lochtefeld further notes that bridal adornment is not currently considered as dowry in most people&#x27;s mind.

Historical and epigraphical evidence from ancient India suggests dowry was not the standard practice in ancient Hindu society. Arrian of Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest era, in his first book, mentions a lack of dowry, or infrequent enough to be noticed by Arrian.

Arrian&#x27;s second book similarly notes,

About 1200 years after Arrian&#x27;s visit, Al-Biruni a Persian scholar who went and lived in India for 16 years in 11th century CE, wrote,

=== &quot;Widowhood&quot; and &quot;remarriage&quot; ===
Widows were traditionally expected to pursue a spiritual, ascetic life, particularly the higher castes such as Brahmins. There were restrictions on remarriage as well. The Hindu widows were not allowed to wear jewellery, they had to consume tasteless food, and they had to wear a white coarse saree without choli or blouse covering their breasts. Such restrictions are now strictly observed only by a small minority of widows, yet the belief continues that &quot;a good wife predeceases her husband&quot;.

During the debate before the passage of the Hindu Widows&#x27; Remarriage Act, 1856, some communities asserted that it was their ancient custom that prohibited widow remarriage. Hindu scholars and colonial British authorities rejected this argument, states Lucy Carroll, because the alleged custom prohibiting widow remarriage was &quot;far from ancient&quot;, and was already in practice among the Hindu communities such as the &quot;Rajbansi&quot; whose members had petitioned for the prohibition of widow remarriage. Thus, it failed the &quot;customary law&quot; protections under the British colonial era laws. However, this issue lingered in colonial courts for decades, because of the related issue of property left by the deceased husband, and whether the widow keeps or forfeits all rights to deceased Hindu husband&#x27;s estate and thereby transfers the property from the deceased husband to her new husband. While Hindu community did not object to widow remarriage, it contested the property rights and transfer of property from her earlier husband&#x27;s family to the later husband&#x27;s family, particularly after the death of the remarried widow, in the 20th century.

=== Sati ===
As visible in this watercolour illustration of the Sati process drawn by a Company artist, it is evident that the Sati process was forced upon widows in ancient India. The picture shows a widow on the funeral pyre surrounded by the King&#x27;s soldiers preventing any possibility of escape by the widow from the burning pyre.

The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has a collection of such paintings on the Subject of Sati, readily available through internet search engines, which show widows being either drowned or burnt on husband&#x27;s funeral pyre or buried alive. Widows had no value in Indian society and Hindu kings ensured using their army, that they did not have any widows in their territory. This is in stark contrast to widowers who were allowed to remarry again and again. There have been many instances of how the widows were shunned in India and therefore, the only solution for a life without husband was to practice Sati.

In modern times 18 year old Roop Kanwar seems to be the last recorded case in Rajasthan, according to India Today that took place in 1989.

Despite the elimination of Sati, the position of widows remains precarious in India.

The underlying cause of all violence directed at widows in India is to defraud them of their property rights and their assets left by their departed husband. 
&quot;Sati&quot; is an Indian funeral custom where a widow was forced to immolate herself on her husband&#x27;s pyre, or committed was buried alive after her husband&#x27;s death. Michael Witzel states there is no evidence of Sati practice in ancient Indian literature during the Vedic period.

David Brick, in his 2010 review of ancient Indian literature, states:

The earliest scholarly discussion of Sati, whether it is right or wrong, is found in the Sanskrit literature dated to 10th- to 12th-century. The earliest known commentary on Sati by Medhātithi of Kashmir argues that Sati is a form of suicide, which is prohibited by the Vedic tradition. Vijñāneśvara, of the 12th-century Chalukya court, and the 13th-century Madhvacharya, argue that Sati should not to be considered suicide, which was otherwise variously banned or discouraged in the scriptures. They offer a combination of reasons, both in favor and against Sati. However, according to the textbook, &quot;Religions in the Modern World&quot;, after the death of Roop Kanwar on her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre in 1987, thousands saw this as cruel murder. Committing Sati was then made a crime, with consequences worse than murder.

Another historical practice observed among women in Hinduism, was the Rajput practice of Jauhar, particularly in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where they collectively committed suicide during war. They preferred death rather than being captured alive and dishonored by victorious Muslim soldiers in a war. According to Bose, &quot;jauhar&quot; practice grew in the 14th and 15th century with Hindu-Muslim wars of northwest India, where the Hindu women preferred death than the slavery or rape they faced if captured. Sati-style &quot;jauhar&quot; custom among Hindu women was observed only during Hindu-Muslim wars in medieval India, but not during internecine Hindu-Hindu wars among the Rajputs.

The Sati practice is considered to have originated within the warrior aristocracy in the Hindu society, gradually gaining in popularity from the 10th century CE and spreading to other groups from the 12th through 18th century CE. The earliest Islamic invasions of South Asia have been recorded from early 8th century CE, such as the raids of Muhammad bin Qasim, and major wars of Islamic expansion after the 10th century. This chronology has led to the theory that the increase in sati practice in India may be related to the centuries of Islamic invasion and its expansion in South Asia. Daniel Grey states that the understanding of origins and spread of Sati were distorted in the colonial era because of a concerted effort to push &quot;problem Hindu&quot; theories in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

=== Education ===
The Vedas and Upanishads mention girls could be a &quot;Brahmacharini&quot;, that is getting an education. Atharva Veda, for example, states

The &quot;Harita Dharmasutra&quot;, a later era Hindu text states there are two kind of women: &quot;sadhyavadhu&quot; who marry without going to school, and the &quot;brahmavadini&quot; who go to school first to study the &quot;Vedas&quot; and speak of Brahman. The Hindu &quot;Sastras&quot; and &quot;Smritis&quot; describe varying number of Sanskara (rite of passage). Upanayana rite of passage symbolized the start of education process. Like the Vedas, the ancient &quot;Sutras&quot; and &quot;Shastra&quot; Sanskrit texts extended education right to women, and the girls who underwent this rite of passage then pursued studies were called &quot;Brahmavadini&quot;. Those who did not performed &quot;Upanayana&quot; ceremony at the time of their wedding. Instead of sacred thread, girls would wear their robe (now called sari or saree) in the manner of the sacred thread, that is over her left shoulder during this rite of passage.

===Dress===

Information on ancient and medieval era dressing traditions of women in Hinduism is unclear. Textiles are commonly mentioned in ancient Indian texts. The Arthashastra (~200 BCE to 300 CE) mentions a range of clothing and plant-based, muslin-based, wool-based textiles that are partially or fully dyed, knitted and woven. It is, however, uncertain how women wore these clothing, and scholars have attempted to discern the dress from study of murti (statues), wall reliefs, and ancient literature. In ancient and medieval Hindu traditions, covering the head or face was neither mandated nor common, but &quot;Ushnisha&quot; – a regional ceremonial occasion headdress is mentioned, as is Dupatta in colder, drier northern parts of Indian subcontinent.

Regardless of economic status, the costume of ancient Hindu women was formed of two separate sheets of cloth, one wrapping the lower part of the body, below the waist, and another larger wrap around piece called Dhoti (modern-day Saree) in texts. Although in some part of India, lower caste women have to keep their breast uncovered in front of upper caste people which signifies lower status.Upper caste women too used to bare their breasts in front the deity as respect. Some &quot;Murti&quot; and relief carvings suggest that pleats were used, probably to ease movement, but the pleats were tucked to reveal the contour of the body. However, where the pleats were tucked, front or side or back varied regionally. The predominant style observed in the ancient texts and artwork is the wrapping of the excess of the &quot;Dhoti&quot; from right waist over the left shoulder, in the Vedic Upanayana style. The breasts were covered with a stitched, tight fitting bodice named &quot;Kurpasaka&quot; () or &quot;Stanamsuka&quot; (), but this was not common in extreme south India or in eastern states such as Orissa and Bengal. Regional variations were great, to suit local weather and traditions, in terms of the length, number of pleats, placement of pleats, style of bodice used for bosom, and the dimension or wrapping of the upper excess length of the &quot;Dhoti&quot;. Greek records left by those who came to India with Alexander the Great mention that head and neck ornaments, ear rings, wrist and ankle ornaments were commonly worn by women.
Usually, the sari consists of a piece of cloth around 6 yards long, wrapped distinctly based on the prior mentioned factors. The choice of the quality and sophistication of the cloth is dependent on the income and affordability. Women across economic groups in colonial era, for example, wore a single piece of cloth in hot and humid Bengal. It was called &quot;Kapod&quot; by poorer women, while the more ornate version of the same was called a &quot;Saree&quot;. The material and cost varied, but nature was the same across income and social groups (caste/class) of Hindu women.

Sindoor or &quot;Kumkum&quot; has been a marker for women in Hinduism, since early times. A married Hindu woman typically wears a red pigment (vermilion) in the parting of her hair, while a never married, divorced or a widowed woman does not. A Hindu woman may wear a Bindi (also called &quot;Tip&quot;, &quot;Bindiya&quot;, &quot;Tilaka&quot; or &quot;Bottu&quot;) on her forehead. This represents the place of the inner eye, and signifies that she is spiritually turned inwards. In the past, this was worn by married women, but in the modern era, it is a fashion accessory and has no relation to the marital status for women in Hinduism.
Cultural customs such as &quot;Sindoor&quot; are similar to wedding ring in other cultures. Regionally, Hindu women may wear seasonal fresh flowers in their hair, during festivals, temple visits or other formal occasions. White color saree is common with aging widows, while red or other festive colors with embroidery is more common on festivals or social ceremonies such as weddings. These Hindu practices are cultural practices, and not required by its religious texts. Hinduism is a way of life, is diverse, has no binding book of rules of its faith, nor any that mandate any dress rules on Hindu women. The choice is left to the individual discretion.

Other ornaments worn by Hindu women are sometimes known as &quot;solah singar&quot; (sixteen decorations): &quot;bindi, necklaces, earrings, flowers in the hair, rings, bangles, armlets (for the upper arm), waistbands, ankle-bells, kohl (or kajal – mascara), toe rings, henna, perfume, sandalwood paste, the upper garment, and the lower garment&quot;.

Bernard Cohn (2001) states that clothing in India, during the colonial British era, was a form of authority exercised to highlight hierarchical patterns, subordination, and authoritative relations. Hindus in India were subject to rule under a range of other religious reigns, therefore influencing clothing choices. This was exemplified by a change in attire as a result of Mughal influence and later European influence resulting from British rule.

===Arts: dance, drama, music===

Hindu religious art encompasses performance arts as well as visual art, and women have been expressed in Hindu arts as prominently as men. Sanskrit literature has contributed to religious and spiritual expression of women, by its reverence for goddesses. The deity for arts, music, poetry, speech, culture, and learning is goddess Saraswati in the Hindu tradition. Baumer states that the resulting Sanskrit Theater has its origins in the Vedas, stemming from three principles: “The cosmic man (purusha), the self (atman), and the universal being (brahman)&quot;. Some of the earliest references to women being active in dance, music and artistic performance in Hindu texts is found in 1st millennium BCE Taittiriya Samhita chapter 6.1 and 8th-century BCE Shatapatha Brahmana chapter 3.2.4. In religious ceremonies, such as the ancient Shrauta and Grihya sutras rituals, texts by Panini, Patanjali, Gobhila and others state that women sang hymns or uttered mantras along with men during the yajnas.
Music and dance, states Tracy Pintchman, are &quot;intertwined in Hindu traditions&quot;, and women in Hinduism have had an active creative and performance role in this tradition. While Hinduism gives women all the rights certain cultural aspects of the social traditions of Hindu society curtailed the freedoms of women too,although they also gave opportunities to create and express arts. The historical evidence, states Pintchman, suggests that the opportunities to create and participate in arts were available to women regardless of their caste or class. Classical vocal music was more prevalent among women upper classes, while public performances of arts such as dance were more prevalent among women in matrilineal Hindu traditions, particularly the Devadasi.

The Devadasi tradition women practiced their arts in a religious context. Young Devadasi women were trained in the arts of music, theater, and dance, and their lives revolved around Hindu temples. In south India, some of these women were courtesans, while others chaste. In 1909, the colonial government passed the first law banning the Devadasis practice in the state of Mysore; however, an attempt to ban Devadasis tradition in Tamil Nadu Hindu temples failed in Madras Presidency in 1927. In 1947, the government of Madras passed legislation forbidding Devadasi practices under pressure from activists that this was a &#x27;prostitution&#x27; tradition. However, the tradition was revived by those who consider it to be a &#x27;nun&#x27; tradition wherein a Devadasi was a chaste woman who considered herself married to God and used temple dance tradition to raise funds as well as helped continue the arts.

In poetry, 9th-century Andal became a well known Bhakti movement poetess, states Pintchman, and historical records suggest that by 12th-century she was a major inspiration to Hindu women in south India and elsewhere. Andal continues to inspire hundreds of classical dancers in modern times choreographing and dancing Andal&#x27;s songs. Andal is also called &quot;Goda&quot;, and her contributions to the arts have created &quot;Goda Mandali&quot; (circle of Andal) in the Vaishnava tradition. Many other women, such as Nagaatnammal, Balasaraswati, and Rukmini, states Pintchman, were instrumental in bringing &quot;Carnatic music and Bharat Natyam to the public stage and making the performing arts accessible by the general public&quot; by the 12th-century. &quot;Gathasaptasati&quot; is an anthology of Subhashita genre of poetry, from the first half of 1st millennium CE, many of which are attributed to Hindu women in central and western India.

===Menstruation===

In Hinduism, menstruating women are traditionally advised rules to follow. Menstruation is seen as a period of purification, and women are often separated from place of worship or any object pertaining to it, for the length of their period. This forms the basis of most of the cultural practices and restrictions around menstruation in Hinduism. The origin of the myth of menstrual impurity originated in the Vedic period, linked to Indra&#x27;s slaying of Vritras; in the Veda that &quot;guilt&quot;, of killing a brahmana-murder, appears every month as menstrual flow of women had taken upon themselves a part of Indra&#x27;s guilt.

==Context: historical and modern developments==
The role of women in Hinduism dates back to 3000 years of history, states Pechelis, incorporating ideas of Hindu philosophy, that is Prakrti (matter, femaleness) and Purusha (consciousness, maleness), coming together to interact and produce the current state of the universe. Hinduism considers the connection, interdependence, and complementary nature of these two concepts – Prakriti and Purusha, female and male – as the basis of all existence, which is a starting point of the position of women in Hindu traditions.

Although these ancient texts are the foundation upon which the position of women in Hinduism is founded, Hindu women participated in and were affected by cultural traditions and celebrations such as festivals, dance, arts, music and other aspects of daily life. Despite these liberating undercurrents emerging in its historical context, Sugirtharajah states that there is some reluctance to use the term &quot;feminism&quot; to describe historical developments in Hinduism.

In the colonial era 1800s, Hindu women were described by European scholars as being &quot;naturally chaste&quot; and &quot;more virtuous&quot; than other women.

In 20th-century history context, the position of women in Hinduism and more generally India, has many contradictions. Regional Hindu traditions are organized as matriarchal societies (such as in south India and northeast India), where the woman is the head of the household and inherits the wealth; yet, other Hindu traditions are patriarchal. God as a woman, and mother goddess ideas are revered in Hinduism, yet there are rituals that treats the female in a subordinate role.

The women&#x27;s rights movement in India, states Sharma, have been driven by two foundational Hindu concepts – lokasangraha and satyagraha. Lokasangraha is defined as “acting for the welfare of the world” and satyagraha “insisting on the truth”. These ideals were used to justify and spur movements among women for women&#x27;s rights and social change through a political and legal process. Fane remarks, in her article published in 1975, that it is the underlying Hindu beliefs of &quot;women are honored, considered most capable of responsibility, strong&quot; that made Indira Gandhi culturally acceptable as the prime minister of India, yet the country has in the recent centuries witnessed the development of diverse ideologies, both Hindu and non-Hindu, that has impacted the position of women in India. The women rights movement efforts, states Young, have been impeded by the &quot;growing intensity of Muslim separatist politics&quot;, the divergent positions of Indian Hindu women seeking separation of religion and women&#x27;s rights, secular universal laws (uniform civil code) applicable irrespective of religion, while Indian Muslim community seeking to preserve Sharia law in personal, family and other domains.

===Western scholarship===
There has been a pervasive and deeply held belief in modern era Western scholarship, states Professor Kathleen Erndl, that &quot;in Hinduism, women are universally subjugated and that feminism, however, it might be defined, is an artifact of the West&quot;. Postmodern scholars question whether they have &quot;unwittingly accepted&quot; this colonial stereotype and long-standing assumption, particularly given the emerging understanding of Hindu Shakti tradition-related texts, and empirical studies of women in rural India who have had no exposure to Western thought or education but assert their Hindu (or Buddhist) goddess-inspired feminism.

Western feminism, states Vasudha Narayanan, has focussed on negotiating &quot;issues of submission and power as it seeks to level the terrains of opportunity&quot; and uses a language of &quot;rights&quot;. In Hinduism, the contextual and cultural word has been Dharma, which is about &quot;duties&quot; to oneself, to others, among other things. There has been a gap between Western books describing Hinduism and women&#x27;s struggle within the Hindu tradition based on texts that the colonial British era gave notoriety to, versus the reality of Hindu traditions and customs that did not follow these texts at all. Narayanan describes it as follows (abridged),

Ancient and medieval era Hindu texts, and epics, discuss a woman&#x27;s position and role in society over a spectrum, such as one who is a self-sufficient, marriage-eschewing powerful Goddess, to one who is subordinate and whose identity is defined by men rather than her, and to one who sees herself as a human being and spiritual person while being neither feminine nor masculine. The 6th-century Devi Mahatmya text, for example, states Cynthia Humes, actually shares &quot;the postmodern exaltation of embodiedness, divinizing it as does much of the Western feminist spirituality movement&quot;. These texts are not theoretical nor disconnected from the lives of women in the historic Hindu society, but the verses assert that all &quot;women are portions of the divine goddess&quot;, states Humes. The Hindu goddess tradition inspired by these texts has been, notes Pintchman, one of the richest, compelling traditions worldwide, and its followers flock villages, towns, and cities all over India. Yet, adds Humes, other texts describe her creative potential not in her terms, but using the words of male virility and gendered dichotomy, possibly encouraging the heroic woman to abandon her female persona and impersonate the male.

Postmodern empirical scholarship about Hindu society, states Rita Gross, makes one question whether and to what extent there is pervasiveness of patriarchy in Hinduism. Patriarchal control is real, and the Hindu society admits this of itself, states Gross, yet the Hindu culture distinguishes between authority – which men hold, and power – which both men and women hold. Women in the Hindu tradition have the power, and they exercise that power to take control of situations that are important to them. The Goddess theology and humanity in the Hindu texts are a foundation of these values, a form that is not feminist by Western definition, but is feminist nevertheless, one with an empowering and self-liberating value structure with an added spiritual dimension that resonates with Hindu (and Buddhist) goddesses.

Kathleen Erndl states that texts such as Manusmriti do not necessarily portray what women in Hinduism were or are, but it represents an ideology, and that &quot;the task of Hindu feminists is to rescue Shakti from its patriarchal prison&quot;. Her metaphor, explains Erndl, does not mean that Shakti never was free nor that she is tightly locked up now, because patriarchy is neither monolithic nor ossified in Hindu culture. The Shakti concept and associated extensive philosophy in Hindu texts provide a foundation to both spiritual and social liberation.

<text>Margaret Hannah Olley (24 June 192326 July 2011) was an Australian painter. She held over ninety solo exhibitions during her lifetime.

== Early life ==
Margaret Olley was born in Lismore, New South Wales. She was the eldest of three children of Joseph Olley and Grace (née Temperley). The Olley family moved to Tully in far north Queensland in 1925, with Margaret boarding at St Anne&#x27;s in Townsville in 1929, before returning to New South Wales in 1931. The family temporarily moved to Brisbane in 1935 with Margaret staying to attend Somerville House in Brisbane during her high school years. She was so focused on art that she dropped one French class in order to take another art lesson with teacher and artist Caroline Barker.

In 1941, Margaret commenced classes at Brisbane Central Technical College and then moved to Sydney in 1943 to enrol in an Art Diploma course at East Sydney Technical College where she graduated with A-class honours in 1945.

== Career ==
Olley concentrated on still life and colour.

James V. Duhig reporting on her 1962 sell-out show at Johnstone Gallery in Brisbane wrote; &quot;Margaret Olley has reached the flood tide of her art and has stepped up to the top rank of our artists,&quot; noting also that all the paintings sold at preview for a gross of £3000, then an Australian record for a woman, but attracted no interest from Brisbane Art Gallery.

In 1997 a major retrospective of her work was organised by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She received the inaugural Mosman Art Prize in 1947.

== Newcastle ==
In November 1965 Olley moved to Newcastle. Whilst living here she painted 23 paintings of the city and waterfront in a series known as the &#x27;Newcastle Watercolours&#x27;. Olley began a &#x27;love affair&#x27; with the city and bought several properties in Newcastle and at East Maitland. This established a long association with the city and a major influence on her work. Several of her paintings can be found in institutions in Newcastle and the Hunter including, the University of Newcastle, Newcastle Art Gallery and Maitland Regional Art Gallery.

== Philanthropy ==
On 13 July 2006 she donated more works to the Art Gallery of New South Wales; her donations included more than 130 works worth $7 million.

== Tributes and honours ==

Olley was twice the subject of an Archibald Prize winning painting; the first in 1948 by William Dobell, who painted her in a borrowed wedding dress made of parachute silk, and the other in 2011 by Ben Quilty. She was also the subject of paintings by many of her artist friends, including Russell Drysdale and several by Danelle Bergstrom including a triptych portrait that was a finalist in the 2003 Archibald Prize.

On 10 June 1991, in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list, Olley was made an Officer of the Order of Australia &quot;for service as an artist and to the promotion of art&quot;. On 12 June 2006, she was awarded Australia&#x27;s highest civilian honour, the Companion of the Order, &quot;for service as one of Australia&#x27;s most distinguished artists, for support and philanthropy to the visual and performing arts, and for encouragement of young and emerging artists&quot;.

In 2006, Olley was awarded the degree Doctor of Fine Arts honoris causa by the University of Newcastle.

== Final exhibition ==

Of the last paintings that Olley did before her death, 27 were exhibited at Sotheby&#x27;s Australia in Woollahra in an exhibition entitled &quot;The Inner Sanctum of Margaret Olley&quot; that opened on 2 March 2012. Olley had put the final touches on the show the day before she died and Philip Bacon, who had exhibited her work for decades, had prepared a catalogue to show her that weekend. The opening night was attended by about 350 people among whom were the Governor-General of Australia, Quentin Bryce, who gave an address, in which she said that Olley&#x27;s work was often just like the artist, &quot;filled with optimism&quot;. Other attendees at the opening included Penelope Wensley, the Governor of Queensland, Edmund Capon, Ben Quilty and Barry Humphries.

== Death ==
Olley died at her home in Paddington in July 2011, aged 88. The cause of her death was respiratory failure. She never married and had no children. Her Paddington home sold for over three million dollars in July 2014.

== Legacy ==
After Olley&#x27;s death, the Art Gallery of New South Wales used funds donated by its Collection Circle to purchase &quot;Nasturtiums&quot;, a painting by E. Phillips Fox as a memorial to her.

Her ideas about art were explored in conversations held between 19 October 2009 and 22 September 2010 with author Barry Pearce, whose book based on them was published in the year of her death.

Part of Olley&#x27;s Paddington house, well known for its items that the painter collected and used as subject matter for her art, described as &quot;her lifelong installation&quot;,
has been recreated at the Tweed River Art Gallery, an area not far from where the artist was born. The architect of the Tweed&#x27;s new Margaret Olley Centre, Bud Brannigan, said that it would be faithful to Olley&#x27;s house, &quot;in all of its glory&quot;.

There is a comprehensive photographic record of her studio and work, shot on the morning she died, by artist photographer Greg Weight. This suite of prints, has been donated to the Tweed River Art Gallery.

A documentary by Catherine Hunter, &quot;Margaret Olley – A Life in Paint&quot; follows Olley as she completes her last – and many believe her finest – works, those painted in the 18 months leading up to her death. The critically acclaimed film interprets Olley&#x27;s style, passion and artistic evolution through the reflections of her peers, including former National Gallery of Australia director Betty Churcher, curator Barry Pearce and Ben Quilty, whose portrait of Olley won the 2011 Archibald Prize.

In 2020, a river-class ferry on the Sydney Ferries network was named in her honour.

<doc id="1196865" wikidata="Q49130" url="?curid=1196865" title="Mr. Mackey">
<text>Mr. Mackey Jr. is a fictional character in the adult animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;. He is voiced by series co-creator Trey Parker and debuted in the season one episode &quot;Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo&quot;. The school counselor at South Park Elementary, he is best known for saying &quot;m&#x27;kay&quot; at the end (or beginning) of most of his sentences.

Mr. Mackey is based on Parker&#x27;s junior high school counselor Stan Lackey.

==Appearance==
Mackey has a disproportionately large head, which is caused by the tightness of his tie. He wears a green long-sleeved shirt, a blue tie, dark blue pants, and blue leather shoes, as well as black-rimmed glasses. He speaks with a Southern accent. Mackey has black yet thinning hair.

==Character biography==
Mackey is the school counselor at South Park Elementary, and occasionally teaches classes at the school. Judging from the episode &quot;Insheeption&quot;, Mackey was most likely born in 1965, making him a member of Generation X. This is supported by the many 1980&#x27;s references that are made involving Mackey during the episode &quot;Back to the Cold War&quot;, such as Mackey&#x27;s childhood bedroom, the WarGames parody, as well as Mackey dancing to Wang Chung&#x27;s &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot; during a duck and cover drill at the elementary school. This is also supported by the episode &quot;Taming Strange&quot;, in which popular 1980s music plays from Mackey&#x27;s computer on the school intercom while trying to use the new &quot;Intellilink&quot; system, such as Lionel Richie&#x27;s &quot;All Night Long (All Night)&quot; and Glenn Frey&#x27;s &quot;The Heat Is On&quot; from the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack.

Mackey taught sex education with Ms. Choksondik, with whom he had a sexual relationship until her death. Following this, he took over the fourth-grade class until Mr. Garrison returned. In &quot;Ike&#x27;s Wee Wee&quot;, Mackey taught Mr. Garrison&#x27;s class about drugs, smoking, and alcohol. He was fired after marijuana he passed out to the students was stolen by Mr. Garrison. He was consequently evicted by his landlord, which caused him to fall into depression and take drugs himself.

Mackey holds generally left-wing political views, as he protested against the Iraq War in the season seven episode &quot;I&#x27;m A Little Bit Country&quot;.

It was presumed that in &quot;Proper Condom Use&quot;, the last time Mackey had sex was 21 years ago (when he mentions he was 19). In the episodes &quot;Something You Can Do with Your Finger&quot; and &quot;Cat Orgy&quot; it was hinted there were bondage sex scenes with Liane Cartman, where in the former episode, Eric Cartman watches a tape of Mackey and Liane, where the latter is Mackey&#x27;s sex slave, and drinks from a cup of her own urine, while the latter episode shows Mackey flirting with Liane.

In &quot;Insheeption&quot; it was revealed that Mackey is a hoarder because of his troubled childhood when he was a fourth-grader in 1974. He was shown to be bullied by other children and was a fan of Woodsy Owl, but at the end of a field trip, the owl molested him. Later in the episode, he threatened to rape Stan Marsh in the mouth if the latter threw any of the clutter in Mackey&#x27;s office away.

Mackey was shown in &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; as a member of the Church of Scientology, though no later episodes mention this. He is fluent in Spanish, as shown in &quot;Rainforest Shmainforest&quot;.

Unlike many of the major adult characters, his first name is currently unknown.

<doc id="1196881" wikidata="Q7744133" url="?curid=1196881" title="The Kenyon Review">
<text>The Kenyon Review is a literary magazine based in Gambier, Ohio, home of Kenyon College. &quot;The Review&quot; was founded in 1939 by John Crowe Ransom, critic and professor of English at Kenyon College, who served as its editor until 1959. &quot;The Review&quot; has published early works by generations of important writers, including Robert Penn Warren, Ford Madox Ford, Robert Lowell, Delmore Schwartz, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, and others.

The magazine&#x27;s short stories have won more O. Henry Awards than any other nonprofit journal—42 in all. Many poems that first appeared in the quarterly have been reprinted in &quot;The Best American Poetry&quot; series, and the magazine is one of the most frequent sources for the series, where poems originally in &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; have appeared in the editions for 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2006.

==History==
The magazine was started in 1939. During his 21-year tenure as editor, John Crowe Ransom made the magazine &quot;perhaps the best known and most influential literary magazine in the English-speaking world during the 1940s and &#x27;50s&quot;.

In 1959 Robie Macauley succeeded Ransom as editor of &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, where he published fiction and poetry by John Barth, T. S. Eliot, Nadine Gordimer, Robert Graves, Randall Jarrell, Richmond Lattimore, Doris Lessing, Robert Lowell, V. S. Naipaul, Joyce Carol Oates, Frank O&#x27;Connor, V. S. Pritchett, Thomas Pynchon, J. F. Powers, Karl Shapiro, Jean Stafford, Christina Stead, Peter Taylor, and Robert Penn Warren, as well as articles, essays and book reviews by Eric Bentley, Cleanth Brooks, R. P. Blackmur, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Ellmann, Leslie Fiedler, Martin Green, and Raymond Williams. During Macauley&#x27;s tenure &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; published the first reviews in English of &quot;Tristes Tropiques&quot; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

A decade after Ransom left the magazine, in 1969, Kenyon College closed it down as the magazine&#x27;s reputation dropped and financial burdens continued. 

In 1979, the quarterly was started up again under Kenyon College President Phillip Hardin Jordan Jr. with Kenyon Professors of English Fred Turner, Ron Sharp, and William Klein as its editors. In 1989, &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; had a circulation of 4,500. Marilyn Hacker, a poet, became the magazine&#x27;s first full-time editor in 1990. &quot;She quickly broadened the quarterly&#x27;s scope to include more minority and marginalized viewpoints,&quot; according to the magazine.

In April 1994, the college trustees directed that costs be cut and revenues increased in various ways. Hacker left and an English professor at the college, David H. Lynn (acting editor in 1989–1990), took over on a two-thirds time basis, becoming the longest-serving editor of the publication. The publication&#x27;s finances have stabilized and improved, and a Kenyon Review Board of Trustees has been set up.

&quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; Short Fiction Prize, established in 2008, is awarded annually to a writer who has not previously published a work of fiction. Cara Blue Adams won the inaugural contest, judged by novelist Alice Hoffman, while Nick Ripatrazone and Megan Mayhew Bergman were named runners-up.

==Kenyon Review Award for Literary Achievement==

The &quot;Kenyon Review Award for Literary Achievement&quot; was created in 2002 to honor careers of extraordinary literary achievement, recognizing writers whose influence and importance have shaped the American literary landscape. It celebrates writers for the courage of their vision, their unparalleled imagination, and for the beauty of their art. The award is presented at a gala benefit dinner each year in New York City.

The first award was presented to novelist E .L. Doctorow (Kenyon College &#x27;52). Novelist and short-story writer Joyce Carol Oates received the award in 2003, while poet Seamus Heaney won it in 2004. The 2005 honorees were Umberto Eco, the novelist, and Roger Angell, the New Yorker fiction editor and baseball writer. In 2006 Ian McEwan received the award; Margaret Atwood followed in 2007, and Pulitzer Prize winning Independence Day author Richard Ford in 2008. In 2009 Louise Erdrich was honored, and in 2010 poet W.S. Merwin received the award. Historian, essayist and critic Simon Schama was the winner in 2011. Author and human rights advocate Elie Wiesel received the honor in 2012. In 2013 the poet Carl Phillips received the award, followed by novelist Ann Patchett in 2014. Roger Rosenblatt, author and playwright, won in 2015. The Kenyon Review honored author Hilary Mantel in 2016, and in 2017 acknowledged author Colm Toibin. In 2018, the award recognized American poet and essayist Rita Dove, a National Humanities and National Medal of Arts recipient, Pulitzer Prize winner and past U.S. poet laureate. In 2019, novelist, short story writer and USC Distinguished Professor of English T. C. Boyle received the award. While no award event took place in 2020, in 2021 the Board of Trustees honored its long serving editor, now editor emeritus, David Lynn as the nineteenth recipient of the Kenyon Review Award for Literary Achievement. Walter Mosley was given the award in 2023.

Proceeds from the annual dinner go to the Kenyon Review&#x27;s endowment fund, which supports both the magazine and the scholarships and fellowships to the Review&#x27;s summer writing programs. In 2017, members of the Board of Trustees of Kenyon College, Kenyon Review and Gund Gallery established the E. L. Doctorow Fund to provide additional scholarship support to a student committed to arts and literature.

==Poetry submissions==
Poetry editor David Baker, in a 2019 interview, provided information on submissions and the process. The magazine receives over 3,000 submissions a year (batches, not individual poems), and publishes some 50 of them per year in the print version, another 25 in the annual &quot;Nature&#x27;s Nature&quot; feature on ecopoetics (published May-June). Of those 75, perhaps 15 or 20 are solicited, and so around 60 come via the open submission route. More poems are published in the &quot;Kenyon Review Online&quot;. A group of trained student associates do part of the first reading and they have the right to reject; it takes two such rejections before a poem is actually rejected. Baker does the final selection, and David Lynn does the &quot;final sign-off&quot;.

<doc id="1196886" wikidata="Q1848959" url="?curid=1196886" title="Mercedes-Benz O305">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz O305 is a single deck, double deck or articulated bus manufactured by Mercedes-Benz in Mannheim, West Germany from 1969 until 1988. It was built as either a complete bus or a bus chassis and was the Mercedes-Benz adaptation of the unified German VöV-Standard-Bus design, that was produced by some different bus manufacturers including Büssing, Magirus-Deutz, MAN, Ikarus, Gräf/Steyr, Heuliez, Renault, and Pegaso. The O305 was designed for use as a single-decker bus, however it was later redesigned to accommodate double-decker bodies.

==Germany==

Mercedes-Benz unveiled the O305 prototype in 1967, production in Mannheim started in 1969. A slightly elongated &quot;Standard-Überlandbus&quot; suburban model (11.3m) followed in 1970, replaced by the O307 class in 1972. From 1974 the O305 received a more powerful engine and an epicyclic gear rear axle plainly audible by its distinctive singing noise.

An articulated version was named the O305G. In the mid-1970s, the Falkenried rolling stock manufacturer in Hamburg had developed a transmission concept with the engine and the power train placed in the rear part. After Mercedes-Benz had acquired the patent, a 1977 prototype was deployed by the Hamburger Hochbahn public transport operator. Production began in 1978.

After a first converted trolleybus version named the O305T was deployed in Kaiserslautern, Daimler-Benz built five articulated buses with a BBC-Sécheron electrical equipment (O305GT) which served the public transport in Kaiserslautern and the Bergen trolleybus system, from 1985 in Basel, and finally in Brașov, Romania. Four dual-mode bus types were built in 1983 and deployed in Esslingen and Essen. Twenty hybrid electric variants were used by the Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen public transport company and in Wesel. In 1979, the CMTC in Brazil imported one O305T for test until 1980.

From 1984 onwards, the O305 was replaced by the second generation of the German &quot;Standard-Linienbus&quot; Mercedes-Benz O405. Production of the O305 ceased in early 1987.

==Hong Kong==

In Hong Kong, the O305 was the first bus model from outside United Kingdom and countries of Commonwealth of Nations to be purchased. A total of 41 buses were introduced, with the prototype in 1983 and the others in 1985. All were withdrawn and subsequently scrapped in 2001/02 except three, which are preserved by groups of bus enthusiasts in Hong Kong and Australia.

===Background and history===
For a long period of time, Hong Kong franchised bus operators were required by law to purchase double-decker buses produced in Commonwealth countries. After repealing the requirement in 1983, Mercedes-Benz supplied a two-axle 11-metre double-decker to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB).

The O305 demonstrator was registered on 4 August 1983. Following successful trials, KMB ordered another 40 in 1985, with improved frontal design and ventilation system. All the 41 buses were fitted with Alexander RH bodies.

KMB later adopted a policy of acquiring 3-axle double-decker buses of similar length. Because Mercedes-Benz did not offer a 3-axle version of the O305, no more Mercedes-Benz buses were purchased by KMB.

===In service===
Initially, the first bus ran on route 105, which was new, running between Lai Chi Kok and Sheung Wan. However, Cross-Harbour Tunnel&#x27;s environment was unsuitable for this model, as well as the fact that the towing of these buses by the tow trucks used by the tunnel authority could result in damage to the chassis, so entire fleet were reallocated to express routes running between Yuen Long and Tsuen Wan/Kowloon. The O305s were renowned for their speed and power, with a maximum speed of over 120 km/h reported.

The buses provided services on the trunk routes in Yuen Long until the mid-1990s. With newer buses (especially those with air conditioning) available for trunk services, the Mercedes were redistributed to North District and Tai Po and served there until their retirement on 22 November 2002.

These buses had a unique livery designed by KMB, but all of them had the livery returned to the standard livery of KMB non-air-conditioned buses shortly before their re-distribution.

==Singapore==
In 1982, Singapore Bus Services (SBS) acquired a single Willowbrook-bodied Mercedes Benz O305 double-deck bus in June for trial purposes. A year later, SBS also took in a second Mercedes Benz O305 double-deck demonstrator with a prototype Alexander R-type body make that was previously exhibited at the 1982 Commercial Motor Show in the UK. These buses were retired in the mid-1990s.

Satisfied with the trial, SBS purchased 200 Mercedes-Benz O305 double-deck buses with Alexander-R bodywork in 1984. They featured an 11,412 cc OM 407h engine with its modular W3D 080 R gearbox. At 11.1 metres long and a licensed capacity of 109 passengers, they were the largest non-air conditioned double-decker buses in Singapore. They entered service from 1984 to 1987 and were deployed to Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Hougang bus depots throughout their lifespan. Withdrawals began in 1996 and the last units were retired by late 2001.

==Australia==


===Perth===
Perth was the first Australian city to operate the Mercedes-Benz O305. The first units entered service with the Metropolitan Transport Trust (MTT) in 1975. Over a period of eleven years between 1975 and 1986, over 400 O305s were purchased. Transperth (as the MTT was rebranded in 1986) and its contractors began withdrawing this sizable fleet of O305s in October 1999 although it would be 2012 until the last were withdrawn.

The bodies were built by Freighter Industries, JW Bolton, Hillquip and Howard Porter. There were some unusual O305s operating in Perth. Examples include 444, which featured a Mauri (Italy) body assembled locally by JW Bolton and 007, an experimental bus (model OG305) with an LPG-fuelled engine. In 1984, 008 Australia&#x27;s first CNG-fuelled bus entered service. From the success of the trial gas buses, two O305s (270/1) were converted to LPG operation in the early 1980s, a CNG-fuelled O305G was ordered and entered service in 1987 as 009. In the early 1990s 26 O305s were converted to CNG.

Perth was also the first Australian city to operate the articulated Mercedes-Benz O305G. Three batches were purchased with 18 in 1979, three in 1980, and 19 in 1986/87. The first and second batches had bodywork completed by JW Bolton and Howard Porter and featured model OM 407h 240 hp (177 kW) naturally aspirated engines. To overcome sluggishness, the buses in the third batch (also featuring Howard Porter bodies but built to the VöV-II design) were fitted with model OM 407hA 280 hp (206 kW) turbocharged engines.

===Sydney===
The Public Transport Commission and its successors operated the largest fleet of O305s, purchasing 1,287 O305s and 30 articulated O305Gs, all bodied by Pressed Metal Corporation for use in Sydney and Newcastle.

Originally 200 Mercedes-Benz O305s with Galvastress Mark 1 bodywork were delivered between May 1977 and August 1978 with one built with a prototype Mark 2 body. These were followed by an order for 550 Galvastress Mark 2 bodied O305s that remains the largest bus order in Australia. These were delivered between October 1978 and November 1980. Whilst the bodies on the Mark 1s had been an effectively the existing PMC body married with a VöV front, the Mark 2s were of the VöV design with a lower roofline and two-leaf doors.

A further order saw 182 O305s bodied by with the Galvastress Mark 3 body enter service between August 1981 and October 1983 with one built with a prototype Mark 4 body. The revisions to the body were minor, and the most noticeable were a return to four-piece sliding windows to improve ventilation and to 203mm high route numbers at both the front and rear after the 127mm examples proved unpopular. The Mark 3 body was also used on 30 O305G articulated buses. A trial unit was delivered in September 1981 followed by the production units between September 1983 and May 1984.

A fleet of 355 Mark 4 O305s were delivered between July 1984 and August 1987. The chassis on these was slightly revised, being fitted with ABS.

Withdrawals commenced in 1989 with the final examples withdrawn in October 2012. At the time of withdrawal, some of these buses had accumulated more than 1 million kilometres of service.

===Canberra===
ACTION took delivery of a fleet of 85 Ansair bodied Mercedes-Benz O305s between November 1981 and March 1985. They were built with standard Mercedes-Benz &quot;StULB&quot; fronts. After being refurbished in the early 1990s, the first were sold in 1995 and then at several other intervals until 1999. All were sold to private bus companies mainly in the Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan areas with 12 being exported to New Zealand to operate in Auckland and Wellington.

Ansair also bodied five Mercedes-Benz O305G articulated buses between February and April 1983. These were sold in 1997/98 to private bus companies around Australia.

===Adelaide===
The State Transport Authority purchased 41 O305 and 51 O305G articulated buses for service on the O-Bahn Busway. The chassis were heavily modified at the Mitsubishi Motors plant in Tonsley. The rigid buses had their power increased to 240 hp (177 kW) and the articulateds to 280 hp (207 kW); they were the first buses to travel at a speed of 100 km/h on suburban routes.

==New Zealand==
===Auckland===
Auckland Regional Authority and its successors had a fleet of over 300 Mercedes-Benz O305 buses which remained in use until 2005. Many of these were sold to other bus operators or converted for other uses including mobile homes. All were fitted with New Zealand Motor Bodies bodies, VoV bodies built under license.

After serving the city of Auckland, some were rebuilt with low-floor bodies by DesignLine and Fairfax Industries, for further suburban use.

===New Plymouth===
New Plymouth City Transport purchased seven Mercedes-Benz O305 buses over two orders:
* 4 purchased in 1976 (on the back of the Auckland Regional Authority order)
* 3 purchased in 1984
==Israel==
Egged in Israel purchased large numbers of O305s, some with locally made bodies including by Ha&#x27;argaz and Mervakim and others with bodies by Mercedes-Benz.

==United Kingdom==
===SELNEC===
The South East Lancashire North East Cheshire Passenger Transport Executive purchased two O305s in 1973 and had them fitted with Northern Counties bodies with 43 seats and dual doors. They were evaluated against Leyland National and Metro-Scanias.

===Luton Airport===
Luton Airport purchased three O305G articulated buses in 1988 with Lex Services bodies based on Heuliez framing delivered in April 1988, they were fitted with only 35 seats allowing for large amounts of standing and luggage space. As they were used within the airport and not on public roads, they were left hand drive. They were the first rear-engined &#x27;pusher&#x27; artics to enter service in the United Kingdom.

<text>WNBC (channel 4) is a television station in New York City that serves as the flagship of the NBC network. It is owned and operated by the network&#x27;s NBC Owned Television Stations division alongside Linden, New Jersey–licensed Telemundo station WNJU (channel 47). WNBC&#x27;s studios and offices are co-located with NBC&#x27;s corporate headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown Manhattan; WNJU&#x27;s facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey, also serve as WNBC&#x27;s New Jersey news bureau. Through a channel sharing agreement with WNJU, the two stations transmit using WNJU&#x27;s spectrum from an antenna atop One World Trade Center.

WNBC holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously operating commercial television station in the United States.

==History==
===Experimental operations===
What is now WNBC traces its history to experimental station W2XBS, founded by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA, a co-founder of the National Broadcasting Company), in 1928, just two years after NBC was founded as the first nationwide radio network. Originally a test bed for the experimental RCA Photophone theater television system, W2XBS used the low-definition mechanical television scanning system. Later it was used mostly for reception and interference tests. The call letters W2XBS meant W2XB-south, with W2XB being the call letters of the first experimental station, started a few months earlier at General Electric&#x27;s (GE) main factory in Schenectady, New York, which evolved into today&#x27;s WRGB. GE was the parent company of both RCA and NBC, and technical research was done at the Schenectady plant.

The station originally broadcast on the frequencies of 2.0 to 2.1 MHz. In 1929, W2XBS upgraded its transmitter and broadcast facilities to handle transmissions of 60 vertical lines at 20 frames per second, on the frequencies of 2.75 to 2.85 MHz. In 1928, Felix the Cat was one of the first images ever broadcast by television when RCA chose a papier-mâché (later Bakelite) Felix doll for an experimental broadcast on W2XBS. The doll was chosen for its tonal contrast and its ability to withstand the intense lights needed in early television. It was placed on a rotating phonograph turntable and televised for about two hours each day. The doll remained on the turntable for nearly a decade as RCA fine-tuned the picture&#x27;s definition, and converted to electronic television.

The station left the air sometime in 1933 as RCA turned its attention to all-electronic cathode-ray tube (CRT) television research at its Camden, New Jersey facility, under the leadership of Dr. Vladimir K. Zworykin.

In 1935, the all-electronic CRT system was authorized as a &quot;field test&quot; project and NBC converted a radio studio in the RCA Building in New York City&#x27;s Rockefeller Center for television use. In mid-1936, small-scale, irregularly scheduled programming began to air to an audience of some 75 receivers in the homes of high-level RCA staff, and a dozen or so sets in a closed circuit viewing room in 52nd-floor offices of the RCA Building. The viewing room often hosted visiting organizations or corporate guests, who saw a live program produced in the studios many floors below.

Viewership of early NBC broadcasts was tightly restricted to those authorized by the company, whose installed set base eventually reached about 200. Technical standards for television broadcasting were in flux as well. Between the time experimental, electronic transmissions began in 1935 and the beginning of commercial television service in 1941, picture definition increased from 343 to 441 lines, and finally (in 1941) to the 525-line standard used for analog television from the start of full commercial service until the end of analog broadcasts in mid-2009. The sound signal was also changed from AM to FM, and the spacing of sound and vision carriers was also changed several times. Shortly after NBC began a semi-regular television transmission schedule in 1938, DuMont Laboratories announced TV sets for sale to the public, a move that RCA was saving for the opening of the World&#x27;s Fair on April 30, 1939, the day that regularly scheduled television programming was to begin in New York on NBC with much fanfare. In response, NBC ceased all TV broadcasting for several weeks until RCA sets went on sale; regular NBC telecasts commenced the day the fair opened.

====Firsts for W2XBS====
As W2XBS broadcasting on &quot;Channel 1&quot; (44–50 MHz), the station scored numerous &quot;firsts&quot;. These included: the first televised Broadway drama (June 1938); the first live news event covered by a mobile unit (a fire in an abandoned building in November 1938); the first live telecast of a presidential speech (Franklin D. Roosevelt opening the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair); the first live telecasts of college and Major League Baseball (both in 1939), the first telecast of a National Football League game (also in 1939); the first telecast of a National Hockey League game (early 1940); the first broadcast of religious services (Easter Sunday 1940); the first network (multi-city) telecast of a political convention (the 1940 Republican National Convention, held June 24–28 in the Philadelphia Civic Center) seen also on W3XE in Philadelphia (now KYW-TV) and W2XB in Schenectady (now WRGB); and the broadcast of the feature film &quot;The Crooked Circle&quot; on June 18, 1940.

In August 1940, W2XBS transmissions were temporarily put on hold, as &quot;Channel 1&quot; was reassigned by the FCC to 50–56 MHz; technical adjustments needed to be made for the conversion. The station returned to the air in October, just in time to broadcast Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s second and final appearance on live television, when his speech at Madison Square Garden on October 28, 1940, was telecast over W2XBS.

===First commercial television station===
On June 24, 1941, W2XBS received a commercial license under the calls WNBT (for &quot;NBC Television&quot;), thus becoming one of the first two fully licensed commercial television stations in the United States, alongside CBS&#x27;s WCBW on channel 2 (now WCBS-TV), which had evolved from experimental W2XAB. NBC and CBS were instructed to sign on simultaneously on July 1 so that neither of the major broadcast companies could claim exclusively to be &quot;first&quot;. However, WNBT signed on at 1:30 pm, one full hour before WCBW. As a result, WNBC (and essentially, NBC) inadvertently holds the distinction as the oldest continuously operating commercial television station (and television network, respectively) in the United States, and also the only one ready to accept sponsors from its beginning. The first program broadcast at 1 p.m. EST by the sign-on/opening ceremony with the U.S. national anthem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, followed by an announcement of that day&#x27;s programs and the commencement of NBC television programming.

WNBT originally broadcast on channel 1. On its first day on the air, WNBT broadcast the world&#x27;s first official television advertisement before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The announcement for Bulova watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase &quot;Bulova Watch Time&quot;, was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.

Although full commercial telecasting began on July 1, 1941, with the first paid advertisements on WNBT, there had been experimental, non-paid advertising on television as far back as 1930. NBC&#x27;s earliest non-paid, television commercials may have been those seen during the first Major League Baseball game ever telecast, a game between the Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds, on August 26, 1939, over W2XBS. To secure the rights to show the game on television, NBC allowed each of the Dodgers&#x27; regular radio sponsors at the time to have one commercial during the telecast; these were done by Dodger announcer Red Barber. For Ivory Soap, he held up a bar of the product, for Mobil gas he put on a filling station attendant&#x27;s cap while giving his spiel, and for Wheaties he poured a bowl of the cereal, added milk and bananas, and took a big spoonful.

The pioneering special interest/documentary show &quot;The Voice of Firestone Televues&quot;, a television offshoot of &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot;, a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, became the first regularly scheduled TV program not featuring news or sports when it began on WNBT on November 29, 1943. (Though a one-time-only, trial episode of &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; aired on WNBT&#x27;s first week of programming two years earlier; it eventually returned to TV in the 1950s.)

During World War II, RCA diverted key technical TV staff to the U.S. Navy, which was interested in developing a television-guided bomb. WNBT&#x27;s studio and program staff were placed at the disposal of the New York City Police Department and used for civil defense training telecasts, with only a limited number of weekly programs for general audiences airing during much of the war. Programming began to grow on a small scale during 1944. On April 10, 1944, WNBT began feeding &quot;The Voice of Firestone Televues&quot; each week to a small network of stations including General Electric&#x27;s Schenectady station (now called WRGB) and Philco-owned WPTZ (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia, both of which are now affiliated with CBS (in KYW-TV&#x27;s case, they are owned by CBS). This series is considered to be the NBC Television Network&#x27;s first regularly scheduled program.

On May 8, 1945, WNBT broadcast hours of news coverage on the end of World War II in Europe, and remotes from around New York City. This event was pre-promoted by NBC with a direct-mail card sent to television set owners in the New York City area. At one point, a WNBT camera placed atop the marquee of the Astor Hotel in New York City panned the crowd below celebrating the end of the war in Europe. The vivid coverage was a prelude to television&#x27;s rapid growth after the war ended. In the spring of 1946, the station changed its frequency from VHF channel 1 to channel 4 after channel 1 was removed from use for television broadcasting. From 1946 to 2009, it occupied the 66–72 MHz band of frequencies which had been designated as &quot;channel 3&quot; in the pre-1946 FCC allocation table. It was renumbered Channel 4 in the post-war system (DuMont-owned WABD, now WNYW—had been designated as &quot;Channel 4&quot;, before that station moved to the current channel 5 but was only required to retune its video and audio carriers downward by 2 MHz under the new system). In October 1948, WNBT&#x27;s operations were integrated with those of sister stations WNBC radio (660 AM) and WNBC-FM (97.1).

The station changed its call letters on October 18, 1954, to WRCA-TV (for NBC&#x27;s then-parent company, Radio Corporation of America or RCA) and on May 22, 1960, channel 4 became WNBC-TV. NBC had previously used the callsign on its television station in New Britain, Connecticut, from 1957 until it was sold earlier in 1960 (that station is now WVIT, and is once again an NBC-owned station). WNBC-TV also earned a place in broadcasting history as the birthplace of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. It began on the station in 1953 as a local late night program, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, and NBC executive Sylvester &quot;Pat&quot; Weaver brought it to the network in 1954. Studio 6B, the show&#x27;s home under Jack Paar, Johnny Carson and today Jimmy Fallon, was the news studio for WNBC while &quot;Tonight&quot; was produced in Los Angeles.

On June 1, 1992, channel 4 dropped the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix from its call letters (following the sale in 1988 of its sister radio station WNBC, which is now WFAN) and became simply WNBC, with the new branding slogan along with a new station logo and name &quot;4 New York&quot;. The accompanying station image campaign was titled &quot;We&#x27;re 4 New York&quot; and featured a musical theme composed by Edd Kalehoff. WNBC was rebranded again as &quot;NBC 4&quot; on September 5, 1995, with its newscasts being renamed &quot;NewsChannel 4&quot;. In July 2007, the &quot;4 New York&quot; branding was revived part time, but in March 2008, it was revived full time.

During the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WNBC, as well as eight other New York City area television stations and several radio stations, were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into and destroyed the World Trade Center. WNBC broadcast engineer Bill Steckman died in the attack, along with Don DiFranco of WABC-TV; Gerard Copolla of WNET; Steve Jacobson of WPIX; and Bob Pattison and Isaias Rivera of WCBS-TV. In the immediate aftermath, the station temporarily fed its signal to three UHF stations that were still broadcasting (PBS member station WLIW and independent stations WMBC-TV and W26CE). After resuming over-the-air transmissions, the station broadcast from the former transmitter site of Channel 68 in West Orange, New Jersey. Since 2005, WNBC has broadcast its signal from the Empire State Building in midtown Manhattan, returning to the original transmitter site used from the 1930s to the 1970s. On May 9, 2017, it was announced that WNBC would return broadcasting from lower Manhattan at One World Trade Center by the end of the year.

In 2004, WNBC served as the model station for NBC Weather Plus, a 24-hour digital weather channel that aired on its second digital subchannel (4.2) and several local cable systems; other NBC-owned stations launched their own Weather Plus channels in 2005, although Weather Plus was discontinued at the end of 2008.

WNBC ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, at 12:30 p.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its transition period UHF channel 28, using virtual channel 4.

As part of the SAFER Act, WNBC kept its analog signal on the air until June 26 to inform viewers of the digital television transition. During this time, the station would participate in the &quot;Analog Nightlight&quot; program for two weeks, with a looped video in English and Spanish explaining how to switch to digital reception.

In February 2015, WNBC and the other NBC-owned stations offered live, web-based streaming of programming to subscribers of participating cable and satellite television providers, as provided through the TV Everywhere mobile apps.

On March 15, 2016, NBCUniversal pulled the signals of WNBC and WNJU along with co-owned cable channels USA Network, Bravo, Syfy, MSNBC and CNBC from Dish Network&#x27;s lineup in the New York metropolitan area as a result of a dispute between NBC and Dish; despite that, Dish claimed NBCUniversal had demanded that it renew its carriage of ten NBC-owned stations and sixteen Telemundo-owned stations, including those removed due to the dispute. Three days later, Dish announced it would continue to carry WNBC, WNJU and five other cable channels for another ten days while the FCC sought arbitration.

On April 13, 2017, it was revealed that WNBC&#x27;s over-the-air spectrum had been sold in the FCC&#x27;s spectrum reallocation auction, fetching $214 million. As a result, WNBC&#x27;s signal was co-located with that of sister station WNJU, which re-located its transmitter to One World Trade Center in 2017. NBC had won similar spectrum bids using Telemundo stations in Chicago and Philadelphia (which entered into in similar arrangements with NBC O&amp;Os WMAQ-TV and WCAU), but stated that in this case, the Telemundo station had a superior signal. WNBC ceased broadcasting on UHF digital channel 28 from the Empire State Building on April 2, 2018, in favor of the shared broadcast with WNJU on channel 36 from One World Trade Center. WNBC along with WNJU later moved channels again on August 1, 2019, at 1 p.m. (EDT) to digital channel 35.

==Programming==

WNBC has long presented events such as the annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, the National Puerto Rican Day Parade (until 2006, when coverage moved to WNYW and currently WABC-TV), the Columbus Day Parade (until 2010, when coverage moved to WABC-TV), the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting. The Tree Lighting aired exclusively in New York on WNBC until 1997, when NBC began airing it nationally. WNBC has sponsored an annual two-day Health &amp; Fitness Expo Fair at MetLife Stadium every summer. The station has sponsored a Food Drive together with local retailer Stop &amp; Shop named &quot;Feeding Our Families&quot; which has been held on the second Saturday in April since 2017. Beginning in 1995, they were the exclusive local English-language carrier of the annual New York City Marathon until 2013 when WABC-TV took over. From 2010 to 2014, the station was an official local broadcast partner of Discovery Times Square. From 2012 to 2014, the station along with the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; had partnerships with Mount Sinai Health System, Live Well New York and Popular Community Bank (&quot;Popular Tips&quot;). The station, along with Maury Povich and Fox owned-and-operated WNYW, co-funded the 1998 PBS documentary &quot;NY TV: By the People Who Made It&quot; produced by WNET. During the Christmas season, the station has an annual Holiday Sing-Along. The station also produces &quot;Visiones&quot;, a weekly segment about Hispanic culture, that also airs in Spanish on sister Telemundo station WNJU, and &quot;Positively Black&quot;, a weekly segment about African-American culture.

As of January 2021, WNBC is one of nine NBC-owned stations that distributes programming either nationally and/or regionally (along with KNTV, KNBC, KNSD, WCAU, WVIT, WTVJ, WMAQ-TV and KXAS-TV).

===Sports programming===
Through NBC&#x27;s coverage of the National Football League, WNBC has televised two Super Bowl championships won by New York teams: the Jets&#x27; upset victory over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, and the Giants&#x27; win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. WNBC served as the official flagship carrier of Giants preseason football games until 2023 when WNYW took over the following season. WNBC is the New York area station for NBC&#x27;s national broadcasts of &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; featuring either one of the two teams. The station also served as the default home station of the Jets from 1965 (when NBC became the broadcaster for the American Football League of which the Jets were then a part) until 1997, when WCBS-TV became the new broadcast rightsholder (through CBS) of what was by now the American Football Conference; it also aired occasional New York Giants games from 1970 (with the completion of the AFL/NFL merger) to 1997; these were limited to home interconference contests.

Even as the station became the first to broadcast Major League Baseball games in 1939 with the pioneer broadcast being that of an August 26 doubleheader at Ebbets Field between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds, it does not have any broadcasts today. They are currently on WNYW and WPIX during the season. Baseball broadcasts were expected to return to the station in 2020 as part of the network-wide coverage of the baseball events of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with on-air news updates during the duration of the event; however, the games were postponed to 2021 due to the global effects of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. The station has aired numerous New York Mets (since 1962) and New York Yankees games (and before 1957, games of the Dodgers and Giants) as part of MLB&#x27;s broadcast contract with NBC from 1947 to 1989, The Baseball Network in 1995, and playoff-only coverage from 1996 to 2000. The station has aired 18 of the Yankees&#x27; World Series appearances (12 of which the team won), and three Mets World Series appearances (two of which the Mets won).

As the network&#x27;s flagship station, per its &quot;NHL on NBC&quot; obligations (which ended in 2021), it broadcast several Stanley Cup playoff games all the way to the Cup Finals, in addition to the &quot;NHL Game of the Week&quot; (if the Rangers, Islanders or New Jersey Devils were playing). It would be only in 2012 when it aired the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the network-wide coverage when the Devils lost out to the Los Angeles Kings. Also, the station aired the 2014 Cup Finals, where the Rangers also lost to the Kings.

From 1990 to 2002, the station aired New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets games through the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot;; this included the Knicks&#x27; appearances in the 1994 and 1999 NBA Finals, as well as the Nets&#x27; appearance in the 2002 NBA Finals.

===News operation===
From the late 1960s through the 1980s, WNBC was involved in a fierce three-way battle with WCBS-TV and WABC-TV for the top spot in the New York television ratings. This continued during a lean period for NBC as a whole. WNBC&#x27;s hallmark over the years has been strong coverage of breaking stories, the combination of straight news items and those with light-hearted and/or entertainment elements (as could be seen in such programs as &quot;Live at Five&quot; and &quot;Today in New York&quot;), and the generally low turnover of their on-air talent. Many of WNBC&#x27;s personalities have been at the station for over 20 years. For instance, Chuck Scarborough has served as the station&#x27;s lead anchor since the debut of &quot;NewsCenter 4&quot; on April 29, 1974. Scarborough represents one half of the longest-serving anchor duo in New York television history, the other half being Sue Simmons, who anchored the 11 p.m. report with Scarborough from 1980 to 2012. Len Berman served as lead sports anchor for 27 years, from 1982 to 2009. Senior correspondent Gabe Pressman was at the station from 1956 until his death in 2017, save for a seven-year stint (from 1972 to 1979) at WNEW-TV (now WNYW).

WNBC-TV was the first station on the East Coast to air a two-hour nightly newscast, and the first major-market station in the country to find success in airing a 5 p.m. report, when &quot;NewsCenter 4&quot; (a format created for WNBC by pioneering news executive Lee Hanna) was introduced in 1974, a time when channel 4 ran a distant third in the city&#x27;s local news ratings. The &quot;NewsCenter&quot; format debuted with a futuristic set described by Hanna as being &quot;the most modern, electronically complicated and sophisticated&quot; facility in the country at that time. A direct, unique style of presenting the news was also implemented, incorporating hard news reports with separate segments devoted to consumer reports, features, and a dedicated weather desk. Hanna declared at the outset, &quot;there will be no happy talk [...] we&#x27;re not in business to be comedians&quot;, a veiled reference to the style of WABC&#x27;s highly-successful &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format. The &quot;NewsCenter&quot; format became a major success in New York, and NBC subsequently brought it to their owned-and-operated stations in Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.

The &quot;NewsCenter4&quot; title was kept by WNBC until September 1, 1980, when the newscasts were renamed &quot;News 4 New York&quot;. Shortly before then the 5 p.m. program was renamed &quot;Live at Five&quot;, and the hour was reformatted from a straight news program to a mix of hard news and celebrity interviews, a style that would become known as infotainment. &quot;Live at Five&quot; eventually became the most-successful local program in New York City, a feat that resulted in landing the show&#x27;s hosts on the cover of &quot;New York&quot; magazine. For most of the time during the &quot;News 4 New York&quot; era of the 1980s and early 1990s, WNBC-TV used various music cues created by Scott Schreer. His theme for &quot;News 4 New York&quot; was based on a synthesized version of the NBC chimes, with a graphics package featuring a lightning bolt striking its logo from 1980 to 1990, a fancy die-cut &quot;4&quot;.

In 1992, the station began calling itself &quot;4 New York&quot; and the campaign song, written by Edd Kalehoff, was quickly adopted as the theme for the newscast. The theme was briefly brought back after the September 11 attacks in 2001. In 1995, after the station rebranded itself as &quot;NBC 4&quot; and its newscasts as &quot;NewsChannel 4&quot;, Kalehoff wrote a new theme called &quot;NBC Stations&quot; featuring the aforementioned NBC chimes. It remained in use for eight years, along with a graphics package using a simple red line for the lower thirds.

The 2003 graphics package was created by Emmy Award-winner Randy Pyburn of Pyburn Films. Pyburn has produced several promotions for the station and the now-defunct &quot;Jane&#x27;s New York&quot; specials hosted by former WNBC reporter Jane Hanson. The graphics package was also used on other NBC stations. The music was written by Rampage Music and featured a brassy version of the NBC chimes, and lower thirds featured a shimmering peacock. In March 2008, concurrent with the restoration of the &quot;4 New York&quot; branding, the newscasts began to be called &quot;News 4 New York&quot; once more.

Many WNBC personalities have appeared, and have also moved up to the NBC network, including: Marv Albert, Len Berman, Contessa Brewer, Chris Cimino, Fran Charles, Darlene Rodriguez, Maurice DuBois, Michael Gargiulo, Tony Guida, Jim Hartz, Janice Huff, Matt Lauer, Tom Llamas, Dave Price, Al Roker, Scarborough, and Tom Snyder. In the past, Albert, Berman, Brewer, Charles, Cimino, DuBois, Guida, Hartz, Lauer, Llamas, Roker, Scarborough, and Snyder have worked at WNBC and NBC at the same time. Price, Rodriguez, Huff, and Gargiulo currently work for both. One monthly feature was Berman&#x27;s &quot;Spanning the World&quot;, a reel of odd and interesting sports highlights from the past month, including a recorded introduction and closing by NBC staff announcer Don Pardo. The segment aired monthly on &quot;Today&quot;.

When Simmons joined the station in early 1980, she was paired with Scarborough on both the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts. However, for most of the time until 2005, WNBC&#x27;s weeknight anchor rotation had Simmons and another male anchor (including Jack Cafferty, Guida, Lauer, and briefly Scarborough) at 5 pm; Scarborough and various anchors (John Hambrick, Pat Harper, and Michele Marsh among them) at 6 pm; and Scarborough and Simmons together at 11 pm. That changed in 2005 as &quot;Live at Five&quot; anchor Jim Rosenfield jumped back to WCBS-TV, where he had once been the noon and 5 p.m. anchor and took on the role as lead anchor for their 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts.

Former reporter Perri Peltz returned to WNBC to co-anchor &quot;Live at Five&quot; with Simmons, making New York City one of the few large markets with two female anchors on an evening newscast. The move harkened back to three decades earlier, when the station paired Pia Lindström with Melba Tolliver on its 5 p.m. news hour, creating one of the first all-female anchor teams on a major-market American television station. It was short-lived as Simmons and Peltz were both displaced from &quot;Live at Five&quot; because of changes in the station&#x27;s early evening news lineup that went into effect on March 12, 2007: David Ushery and Lynda Baquero became co-anchors of a truncated, 30-minute-long &quot;Live at Five&quot; broadcast, followed by Peltz with a 30-minute, soft-news program, &quot;News 4 You&quot;. Simmons was moved to co-anchor at 6 p.m. with Scarborough. On September 13, 2006, WNBC became the first New York City television station to broadcast its newscasts in high definition. On May 5, 2007, WNBC brought back its popular campaign song &quot;We&#x27;re 4 New York&quot;, composed by Kalehoff, after nearly six years off air (after the September 11, 2001, attacks).

In early autumn 2007, additional changes were brought to WNBC&#x27;s early-evening lineup. On September 10, the station moved the newsmagazine series &quot;Extra&quot; to 5 pm, and cancelled &quot;Live at Five&quot;. &quot;News 4 You&quot; remained at 5:30 pm, but was replaced on October 15, 2007, with a traditional newscast, anchored by Simmons and Michael Gargiulo. The 6 p.m. newscast became anchored by Ushery and Baquero, and &quot;New York Nightly News&quot;, a new half-hour newscast with Scarborough as sole anchor, debuted at 7 p.m.

These changes did not lead to an increase in WNBC&#x27;s ratings in the November 2007 sweeps period, partially because of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike. The most shocking of WNBC&#x27;s ratings decreases was its 11 p.m. newscast, which fell to third place, behind WCBS and WABC. WNBC altered its 5–6 p.m. hour on January 2, 2008, swapping the half-hour news at 5:30 p.m. with &quot;Extra&quot;. On March 9, 2009, with the launch of &quot;New York Nonstop&quot; on digital subchannel 4.2, &quot;New York Nightly News&quot; was moved to the subchannel and expanded to one hour, while &quot;Extra&quot; was moved back to 7 p.m. and a full hour of news returned to the 5 p.m. hour. Still, WNBC&#x27;s ratings struggled: during the March 2009 sweeps period, its newscasts were a distant third in all-time slots, except during the weekday mornings, where it remained in second.

On May 7, 2008, NBC Universal announced plans for a major restructuring of WNBC&#x27;s news department. The centerpiece of the restructuring was the creation of a 24-hour all-news channel on WNBC&#x27;s second digital subchannel (4.2). Channel 4&#x27;s news operations were revamped and melded into the all-news channel, which serves as a &quot;content center&quot; for the station&#x27;s various local distribution platforms. The digital news channel was launched on March 9, 2009. In the fall of 2008, WNBC started beta-testing a new website which was apparently poised to be one of the major platforms for the content center. On November 17, 2008, WNBC moved its news studio from Studio 6B to 7E and rolled out a new set design, graphics package, and theme song written by veteran TV composer Frank Gari. This move came after months of planning the new content newsroom with its 24-hour news digital subchannel. It was also their debut of the updated 4 New York logo, using letters in Media Gothic Bold font and the &quot;New York&quot; wording was switched from its script font to All caps font, which is designed by Brit Redden of Modal Pictures.

On June 16, 2009, WNBC announced that its 5 p.m. newscast would be replaced in September by a one-hour daily lifestyle and entertainment show by LXTV entitled &quot;LX New York&quot;. After this change, WNBC, with only three hours per day of local news, had the shortest airtime devoted to local news of any &quot;big three&quot; network-owned station. In the fall of 2009, WNBC began sharing its news helicopter with Fox owned-and-operated WNYW (channel 5) as part of a Local News Service agreement. The SkyFox HD helicopter operated by WNYW when used by WNBC was called &quot;Chopper 4&quot; on-air. This agreement ended in 2012, with WNBC returning to use its own helicopter when the contract expired. In the summer of 2010, &quot;The Debrief with David Ushery&quot; began to air on Sunday at noon on WNBC after launching on New York Nonstop; it now airs Sunday mornings at 5:30 a.m.

&quot;LX New York&quot; was renamed to &quot;New York Live&quot; on May 26, 2011. The program was set to move to 3 p.m. on September 12, 2011; at that time, WNBC would resume airing a 5 p.m. newscast. However, due to Hurricane Irene, the 5 p.m. newscast&#x27;s start date was moved up to August 29, 2011, with &quot;New York Live&quot; moving to its new 3 p.m. slot then. On November 18, 2011, WNBC launched a noon newscast that replaced &quot;The Rundown&quot; with Russell and Llamas as the anchors.

In December 2011, WNBC struck a news partnership with non-profit news-reporting organization ProPublica. The organization, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2010, already has partnerships with several media outlets including &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;HuffPost&quot; and &quot;Businessweek&quot;. However, ProPublica&#x27;s reports are incorporated across all NBC O&amp;O stations, not just WNBC. This is part of larger efforts for NBCUniversal&#x27;s television stations to partner with nonprofit news organizations following its acquisition by Comcast.

WNBC relocated from Studio 7E to Studio 3C (the studio previously used by &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, which now originates from Studio 3B) on April 21, 2012. Channel 4 also updated its graphics and switched to the &quot;L.A. Groove&quot; theme that has been in use by sister station KNBC. On June 15, 2012, Sue Simmons left WNBC as her contract with the station was not renewed. In January 2013, the station expanded its Sunday 11 p.m. newscasts to one hour, possibly to compete with WABC which expanded its late news in January 2012.

On June 6, 2016, WNBC revamped its website. On June 11, 2016, beginning with the 11 p.m. newscast, its news graphics were also changed and it began using Look N graphics from NBC Artworks, becoming the first NBC-owned station to use the new graphics that were rolled out to other NBC-owned stations around this time. On June 13 of the same year, the station debuted its 4 p.m. newscast, thus becoming the second New York television station to expand its newscasts to that time period after WABC-TV (which had their 4 p.m. newscasts since May 2011).

On October 10, 2016, WNBC relocated from studio 3C to studio 3K (the studio also used by &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; and sister cable network MSNBC), which bears similarities to the previous set in 3C, albeit a lot larger in size and with several changes (i.e. a new weather center area, a touchscreen display similar to &quot;Today&quot;″s Orange Room, an LED wall, and a work space and presentation pod). In fall 2016, WNBC entered a content-sharing agreement with WOR to include news and weather content supplied by the station; WNBC&#x27;s weather content is also heard on other iHeartMedia radio stations throughout the New York metropolitan area. On December 21, 2016, WNBC announced that it would be launching a new S band weather radar system, called Storm Tracker 4, which is planned to launch in winter 2017. On December 27, 2016, the station announced it would move the midday newscast to 11 a.m. (the first and only 11 a.m. midday newscast in the New York media market), and its locally produced lifestyle/entertainment program &quot;New York Live&quot; to 11:30 a.m. beginning January 16, 2017. As part of the changes of the daytime lineup at the station, it would move &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from the network&#x27;s default Eastern Time Zone slot of 1 p.m. to the early time slot of 12 pm, followed by &quot;Access Hollywood Live&quot; at 1 pm.

On June 30, 2017, it was announced that Chuck Scarborough would step down as the anchor of the 11 p.m. newscast on July 14 but would continue to anchor the 6 p.m. newscast. 4 p.m. anchor Stefan Holt, whose father Lester presides over &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; down the hall from Studio 3K, assumed duties for the late newscast beginning July 17.

On July 31, 2017, the station expanded its morning newscast &quot;Today in New York&quot; by a half an hour, beginning at 4 a.m. for a total of three hours; this is the first 4 a.m. newscast in the New York media market since WPIX had one from 2010 to 2014. Six days later on August 6, 2017, the Sunday edition of the morning newscast had an extra half-hour added after 9:30 am; the 6–8 a.m. portion remained unchanged. As part of the changes to the station&#x27;s Sunday morning lineup, &quot;Sunday Today with Willie Geist&quot; was moved to the network&#x27;s recommended time of 8 a.m. followed by the LXTV-produced program &quot;Open House NYC&quot; at 9 a.m. &quot;Meet the Press&quot; remained at 10:30 am.

In November 2017, WNBC opened the San Juan news bureau led by bilingual reporter Julio &quot;Gaby&quot; Acevedo; the bureau delivers daily English and Spanish-language news and updates for the station and its sister station WNJU as well as all NBC and Telemundo-owned stations across the country; the new bureau operated through February 2018.

On August 19, 2020, it was announced that after four years with the station, Stefan Holt would be leaving to rejoin Chicago sister station WMAQ-TV to anchor its 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. newscasts, beginning in October. On August 31, 2020, the station announced that 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. news anchor David Ushery would succeed Holt on the 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts, beginning October 12, 2020; however, due to Holt&#x27;s early departure on September 25, the official start date was moved up to September 28. Meanwhile, weekend anchor Adam Kuperstein succeeded Ushery in the 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. newscasts.

On June 7, 2021, WNBC started airing a new half-hour weekday 7 p.m. newscast.

In January 2022, WNBC announced plans to launch a new FAST channel called &quot;NBC New York News&quot;; this announcement follows the simultaneous rollout of streaming news channels from its sister stations in Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and Boston on January 20. The channel was launched on March 17, 2022. In 2024, WNBC launched an exclusive 7 a.m. newscast on the channel.

In the summer of 2022, WNBC indicated it would return to Studio 3B, which will be split with WNJU once that station relocates operations to Rockefeller Center.

==Controversies and incidents==
===Chopper 4 helicopter crashes===
1998 saw the introduction of a brand-new Chopper 4, a Eurocopter EC135 that the station heavily promoted. The new chopper ended up crashing into the Passaic River near Harrison and Newark, New Jersey on December 3, 1998; reporter Kai Simonsen and pilot Terry Hawes survived.

Hence, the older model, a Eurocopter AS350, was returned to service and remained until May 4, 2004, when it crashed while covering a shooting in Brooklyn. Reporter Andrew Torres, pilot Russ Cowry and pilot trainee Hassan Taan survived the crash and were taken to area hospitals. The crash occurred at about 6:30 p.m. as the crew was preparing for a live report from the scene of a shooting in East Flatbush. Before the cut-in, Chopper 4 appeared to begin a steep nosedive. WABC&#x27;s own helicopter captured the initial nosedive and the chopper&#x27;s subsequent tailspin until crashing into a rooftop.

===2008 weeknight infomercial issue===
On March 25, 2008, WNBC carried a paid program leading into NBC&#x27;s Tuesday night prime time and after the 7 p.m. newscast for mortgage lender Lend America, replacing that night&#x27;s &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;. Several &#x27;Big Four&#x27; stations throughout the United States had carried paid programs leading into prime time in a period during the Great Recession to some varied controversy (and often do to this day during Saturday evenings, a little-trafficked time period with no complaint), but the one airing in New York of the Lend America infomercial, which was hosted by ex-WNBC reporter Joe Avellar, attracted massive criticism from viewers and local media critics, especially involving Avellar&#x27;s role as host and Lend America&#x27;s part in the housing crisis, and to a much lesser extent, preemption of regular weeknight programming. Earning the station $130,000 for the -minute program, it generated low ratings and led to a quick fallout, with general manager Frank Comerford resigning his position from the station for approving the airtime sale. Although Lend America expressed interest in buying more early access time on the station, WNBC has never again carried a paid program before prime time on weeknights.

===Sue Simmons &quot;F-bomb&quot; incident===
On May 12, 2008, a prime time promo for that night&#x27;s 11 p.m. newscast was thought by anchor Sue Simmons to be on tape for later broadcast but was actually going out live. After completing the first portion of the tease, Simmons noticed co-anchor Chuck Scarborough distracted with something on his on-desk laptop, and thinking the take would be trashed and another take would be shot for air, shouted &quot;The fuck are you doing?&quot; towards him in a manner seemingly meant as an inside joke among colleagues, while YouTube b-roll of a cruise ship departing Manhattan continued to roll before the promo&#x27;s end.

Later during the actual newscast, Simmons profusely apologized for the live outburst, saying, &quot;I have to acknowledge an unfortunate incident. I used a word that many people find offensive. It was a mistake I made and I&#x27;m truly sorry.&quot; No further comment was made by the station or Simmons about the incident.

&quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; used clips from the promo in several sketches mocking the incident.

===I-Team Super Bowl promo editing controversy===
On February 5, 2012, the station premiered the I-Team promo during NBC Sports&#x27; coverage of Super Bowl XLVI featuring former NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly, but later on the day after the Super Bowl, they edited out Kelly&#x27;s clip due to some complaints from rival WCBS-TV. However, the spokesman declined to comment, and criticisms arose from WABC-TV, WNYW, and WPIX, the station&#x27;s rivals. Station general manager Michael Jack said in the statement that &quot;our investigative team is among the most experienced in the industry, and to suggest that the station won&#x27;t cover the NYPD fairly, accurately and with balance simply because the commissioner appeared in a station promotional spot is simply not true&quot;. After the promo was edited out at the station, Lynda Baquero resigned from the investigative team but continued as a reporter for the station. She was replaced by Pei-Sze Cheng and Jonathan Vigliotti (though Vigliotti later left for WCBS-TV).

===Tweet regarding anti-Semitic violence===
On January 2, 2020, WNBC posted a tweet on its Twitter account linking to an Associated Press wire article, syndicated to its website, on the recent wave of anti-Semitic violence in the United States, coming three weeks after a targeted shooting at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, New Jersey. The text of the message, likely automatically generated by the station&#x27;s content management system, featured one of three bullet points summarizing the article as a whole, and stated that Orthodox Jews moving from the core of New York and New Jersey and into their own self-established communities on the fringe of the Tri-State area due to gentrification was a reason for an increase of violent anti-Semitic attacks in the broader region;

WNBC&#x27;s headline, and its inclusion in the tweet, was met with backlash from Jewish groups and people, including the progressive Zionist group Zioness and the Republican Jewish Coalition, which called out the station for &quot;blaming the Orthodox community for the attacks&quot;. Others prominent in the community also questioned the message, including Bari Weiss, former New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, and &quot;The Forward&quot;″s Batya Ungar-Sargon. The station later apologized for the original headline, deleted the original tweet, and then re-sent the article tweet with an edited headline.

==Subchannels==
On December 20, 2012, WNBC and other NBC-owned stations began carrying Cozi TV. It replaced NBC (New York) Nonstop, which had been carried on digital subchannel 4.2 since 2009.

<text>Uzi Narkiss (; January 6, 1925 – December 17, 1997) was an Israeli general. Narkiss was commander of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units in the Central Region during the 1967 Six-Day War. Narkiss appears in the famous photograph of Defense Minister Moshe Dayan flanked by Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin taken in the Old City of Jerusalem shortly after its capture from Jordanian forces.

==Early life==
Uzi Narkiss was born in Jerusalem to Polish Jewish parents. His first memory was of going into hiding during the 1929 Palestine riots. Narkiss attended high school at Gymnasia Rehavia. He joined the Palmach at the age of 16 and was involved in Haganah operations against British Mandatory forces in Palestine.

==Military career==

In April 1948, Narkiss headed the assault on Katamon with the Fourth Battalion of the Harel Brigade, during which time they captured the monastery at San Simon — a key strategic position. Following the final departure of the British in May 1948 and the Israeli Declaration of Independence, Narkiss was appointed to assist those besieged in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. Narkiss&#x27; unit, dubbed a &quot;diversionary force,&quot; succeeded in penetrating Zion Gate, bringing in supplies and evacuating the wounded from those under siege. When military reinforcements failed to appear, however, Narkiss ordered his men to retreat, with the Old City falling to Jordanian forces shortly thereafter.

Narkiss spent several years studying in France at the École de Guerre (the French Military Academy). He later served as an Israeli military attaché and was awarded the Légion d’honneur by the French government. In 1965, he was appointed the first director of the Israel National Defense College.

During the Six-Day War on June 5, 1967, with seven brigades under his command known as Central Command, Narkiss was responsible for combating any possible Jordanian offensive. Capturing the Old City was not part of the plan. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units moved effectively to take key positions in east Jerusalem, where one key location was Ammunition Hill. Still, to Narkiss&#x27; dismay, the politicians would still not allow the Old City to be taken. But with a looming cease fire approaching after an emergency meeting of the UN, Moshe Dayan gave the order to Narkiss who quickly capitalised on the opportunity to capture the city before any cease fire prevented this as an option. Under his direction, the Old City was captured on June 7 and Jerusalem was reunified under Israeli control. From Narkiss&#x27; viewpoint, this completed the campaign he had begun 19 years earlier, and whose previous failure had haunted him.

After the war, the Palestinian village of Beit Awwa was completely destroyed. Moshe Dayan claimed the destruction was carried out under the orders of an officer who wished to expel the residents; Brigadier General Uzi Narkiss claimed the credit for the action. 

==Later activities==

In response to ongoing fedayeen attacks across the Jordan River in early 1968, the IDF performed dual military operations in March: Operation Asuta, as part of Southern Command operations; and Operation Inferno, as part Narkiss&#x27;s Central Command. While the IDF considered the former an operational success, the latter resulted in the Battle of Karameh, which obtained mixed results. While Operation Inferno achieved most of its objectives, namely uprooting Fatah from their headquarters at Karameh in Jordan, it failed to capture Yasser Arafat. Moreover, the Israelis suffered numerous casualties and loss of equipment, some of which was paraded through Amman. This emboldened King Hussein, and led to a recruitment wave in Fatah. As a result, Narkiss was quietly relieved of his command, and instead went on to hold key positions in the Jewish Agency and the World Zionist Organization.

In 1948, Uzi Narkiss searched the body of the dead Palestinian commander Abdul Kader Husseini for his Koran on the battlefield. In the 1980s he wanted to give it to Kader&#x27;s son Faisal Husseini but only &quot;in the presence of journalists and TV cameras – otherwise I am not interested&quot;. Husseini was not interested under such terms, therefore Narkiss kept it in his library.

==Death==
Narkiss died in 1997 after a long illness at the age of 72. He was buried in the military cemetery on Mount Herzl.

<doc id="1196900" wikidata="Q282719" url="?curid=1196900" title="Pete Sandoval">
<text>Pedro Rigoberto &quot;Pete&quot; Sandoval (born May 21, 1964) is a Salvadoran-born American drummer, best known for his work with extreme metal bands Morbid Angel, Terrorizer and I Am Morbid.

According to Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic, Sandoval &quot;challenges one&#x27;s perception of how fast a drummer can possibly drum.&quot;

== Career ==
His first significant stint as a drummer was for the grindcore band Terrorizer, formed in 1986, where he began to demonstrate some of his talent. Heavily influenced by the grindcore music around him, Sandoval quickly developed his abilities as a drummer with little formal training or musical education. In 1988, Sandoval was invited to join the death metal band Morbid Angel. Concurrently, the original lineup of Terrorizer was dissolved after the departures of Sandoval and guitarist Jesse Pintado (who subsequently joined Napalm Death).

Sandoval had never used two bass drums before joining Morbid Angel. He had to practice frequently in order to get his feet up to speed, and recorded the &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; album within only a couple of months of joining Morbid Angel. According to Morbid Angel guitarist Trey Azagthoth, the band would occasionally walk in on Sandoval passed out on the floor in a pool of sweat. After being woken up, he would immediately say, &quot;Time to get back to work!&quot; After mastering the double-bass technique in Morbid Angel, Sandoval also implemented it in Terrorizer&#x27;s &quot;World Downfall&quot; album when the band briefly re-united to record it.

According to former singer David Vincent, the band once played a prank on Sandoval by making him listen to a band that used a preprogrammed drum machine, and pretended it was a real drummer who could play faster than he could. Sandoval was gutted, and went on to practice until he managed to play faster than the machine.

In 2010, he had to undergo surgery to repair a prolapsed disc. Not being able to play painlessly for an extended period for up to a year, he was replaced by Tim Yeung for the recording and touring of Morbid Angel&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Illud Divinum Insanus&quot;.

In December 2013, David Vincent stated in an interview that Sandoval was no longer with Morbid Angel, citing incompatibility with the band after Sandoval&#x27;s conversion to Christianity as the reason.

In a 2014 interview, Sandoval said that his beliefs would not affect Terrorizer&#x27;s music or lyrical content, explaining that his faith had given him a positive outlook on life.

Sandoval explains that the reason for his split from Morbid Angel was not a religious matter, but having the time to recover from his back surgery which took much longer than he had expected, as the band would not wait for him to recover, thus prompting them to find a new drummer. He also mentioned that after the recording of Terrorizer&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Hordes of Zombies&quot; was when he converted to Christianity and his life started to change, crediting his mother and sister for their encouragement. Sandoval said that he would not have continued to perform in the band after his conversion due to his newfound religious differences with them. When asked if he misses performing with Morbid Angel, he said, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t miss it. I don&#x27;t miss any of that.&quot; His relationship with any of the band members has been without any negativity on either side and was non existent for many years until late 2021 when Sandoval reconnected with David Vincent (a few years after his own split from Morbid Angel) in Vincent’s own group I Am Morbid when Sandoval’s other commitments were largely put on hold due to Terrorizer’s temporary hiatus.

The spring of 2022, saw Sandoval and Vincent touring as part of I Am Morbid, with Sandoval taking over from Tim Yeung, who, somewhat ironically, was among the drummers to join Morbid Angel after Sandoval left.

== Influences ==
Sandoval cited Clive Burr as a &quot;huge influence&quot; on his first year of drumming. Other significant influences include Dave Lombardo, Gene Hoglan and Neil Peart.

Owned by Audacy, Inc., the station serves the New York metropolitan area, while its 50,000-watt clear channel signal can be heard at night throughout much of the eastern United States and Canada. WFAN&#x27;s studios are located in the Hudson Square neighborhood of lower Manhattan and its transmitter is located on High Island in the Bronx.

The current WFAN, and its sports format, is the second New York City station with that call sign and programming. The original WFAN was launched on July 1, 1987, on , as the world&#x27;s first radio station to adopt the sports radio format around-the-clock.

The WFAN call letters and sports format were moved to the former WNBC at 660 kHz on October 7, 1988. WNBC&#x27;s history dated to 1922, when it began operation as WEAF, licensed to Western Electric. Purchased by the Radio Corporation of America in 1926, it became the flagship of the NBC Radio Network, the first national radio network in the United States, later becoming WRCA and WNBC.

==Founding by the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T)==
===Early AT&amp;T radio development===
AT&amp;T had an early interest in radiotelephone development, although initially only as a method for establishing telephone links to locations where it was not possible to string wire lines. Lee de Forest&#x27;s development of vacuum-tube amplification would prove invaluable for progress in a number of areas. In July 1913 the company spent $50,000 to purchase from the inventor the patent rights for telephone wire amplification, and in 1915 used this innovation to make the first transcontinental telephone calls. In October 1914, the company further purchased the commercial patent rights for radio signalling for $90,000, and in October 1915 conducted test radio transmissions from the Navy&#x27;s station in Arlington, Virginia, NAA, that were heard as far away as Paris, France and Hawaii.

AT&amp;T&#x27;s main competitor in the radio field would be the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which was formed in 1919 as a subsidiary of General Electric (GE). Because no single company held sufficient patents rights to operate radio systems without infringing on other company&#x27;s patents, a series of cross-licensing agreements were concluded between a series of companies holding key patents, and on July 1, 1920, AT&amp;T signed a comprehensive agreement with GE. These agreements in effect assigned dominance in specified areas of the radio industry to individual participating companies, which eventually would meet with anti-trust challenges. In addition, conflicting interpretations of some of the pact&#x27;s clauses by the signatories would lead to numerous disputes, especially between AT&amp;T and the other participants, known collectively as the &quot;radio group&quot;.

On December 1, 1921, the U.S. Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, adopted a regulation formally establishing a broadcasting station category, which set aside the wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) for entertainment broadcasts, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for market and weather reports. AT&amp;T soon recognized that it had the technical expertise and patent rights needed to play an important, and possibly dominant, role in the broadcasting industry. A December 1921 memo prepared by two AT&amp;T engineers proposed that the company construct a nationwide radio network, using the company&#x27;s long lines to connect together individual stations. They also noted that &quot;this service would enable the national and local advertisers, industrial institutions of all kinds, and even individuals if they desire, to send forth information and advertising matter audibly to thousands&quot;. AT&amp;T moved quickly to start implementing this plan, and on February 11, 1922, formally announced its intention to develop a &quot;national chain of radio transmitting stations&quot;.

A key component was the construction by AT&amp;T of a well equipped New York City station. In early 1922 an experimental station, 2XY, was built atop the AT&amp;T &quot;Long Lines&quot; building at 24 Walker Street. On April 29, 1922, the Walker Street station was issued a broadcasting station license, for operation on 360 meters, with the call sign of WBAY. On May 19 a second New York City broadcasting station, also on 360 meters, was licensed to the Western Electric Company, an AT&amp;T subsidiary located at 463 West Street, with the call letters WDAM. Ten days later, this call sign was changed to WEAF. All of these call signs were randomly assigned from a sequential roster of available call letters, although at the time it was noted that WEAF matched the entrance artwork at AT&amp;T headquarters at 195 Broadway, which depicted the four classical elements of water, earth, air and fire.

The original plan was that AT&amp;T would not originate any programming of its own, and instead would rent WBAY out for commercial use, $40 for 15 minutes daytime, $50 during evenings, which, using an existing telephone term, was called &quot;toll&quot; broadcasting. However, initially there was very little interest in this idea, and in order to begin service the company had to start broadcasting its own programs. The debut broadcast over WBAY, of recorded music, took place on July 25, 1922, its signal was found to be weaker than expected, so on August 16, 1922, broadcasting operations were transferred to the WEAF transmitter located at West Street. It was later reported that the first WEAF broadcast included the singer Marguerite Dunlap.

On August 28, 1922, WEAF broadcast its first sponsored program, a roughly 10-minute-long talk anticipating today&#x27;s radio and television infomercials. This promoted an apartment development in Jackson Heights near a new elevated subway line (the IRT&#x27;s Flushing-Corona line, now the number 7 line). Although often credited as the first radio commercial, there are reports that a few other stations had already quietly carried paid programs.

In September 1922 the Department of Commerce set aside a second entertainment wavelength, 400 meters (750 kHz) for &quot;Class B&quot; stations that had quality equipment and programming. Both WBAY and WEAF were assigned to this wavelength.

The original issues with the weak WBAY transmissions from 24 Walker Street were eventually solved, and AT&amp;T returned to that site as its primary transmitter location. Because the WEAF call sign was now well-known, the two stations swapped call signs on May 12, 1923, with WBAY becoming WEAF, and WEAF becoming WBAY. Because of this, FCC records list WFAN&#x27;s &quot;First License&quot; as April 29, 1922, which is when the first license was issued for WBAY at Walker Street. (The new WBAY later became WECO, and was deleted on November 6, 1924).

Effective May 15, 1923, additional &quot;Class B&quot; assignments were made available, with New York City-Newark allocated three frequencies, including 610 kHz, and WBAY and WEAF were reassigned to this new frequency.

===Network operations and the &quot;WEAF chain&quot;===

WEAF&#x27;s first network program was transmitted on January 4, 1923, using dedicated telephone lines to link to one additional station, WNAC (now WBIX) in Boston, Massachusetts. A more ambitious three-month link began operation on July 1, 1923, when Colonel Edward H. R. Green arranged for AT&amp;T to provide WEAF&#x27;s programming for rebroadcast by his station, WMAF in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The summer of 1923 also saw the opening of WCAP in Washington, D.C., licensed to the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company, an AT&amp;T subsidiary. The resulting New York-to-Washington link was extensively used to gain engineering knowledge in using telephone lines for radio network connections.

Initially the WEAF network had few advertisers, so most of its schedule consisted of unsponsored &quot;sustaining&quot; programs which network stations had to pay for, although they were not charged for sponsored programs. An important early sponsored program was &quot;The Eveready Hour&quot;, which debuted over WEAF in December 1923, and began to be carried over a rapidly growing number of stations in early 1924. The first transcontinental link was made in early 1924, and that fall a coast-to-coast network of 23 stations broadcast a speech by President Coolidge. By the end of 1925 there were 26 affiliates in the standard WEAF chain network, extending westward to Kansas City, Missouri.

Reacting to AT&amp;T&#x27;s innovations, RCA began efforts to establish its own network, originating from its New York City station, WJZ (now WABC), but was badly handicapped in competing effectively. AT&amp;T maintained that the cross-licensing agreements gave it the exclusive right to sell airtime. AT&amp;T also normally refused access to its high-quality telephone lines to competitors, so RCA&#x27;s efforts generally used telegraph lines to connect stations, which would prove to have inadequate fidelity and reliability. RCA also investigated using high-powered or shortwave stations to establish network connections, but none of these alternatives matched the quality of AT&amp;T&#x27;s telephone links. Thus, while President Coolidge&#x27;s March 1925 inauguration was sent over a growing AT&amp;T transcontinental network of 23 stations, the WJZ chain&#x27;s broadcast of the speech was carried by only four stations, all located in the East.

===Formation of the Broadcasting Company of America===
On May 11, 1926, AT&amp;T announced that &quot;The radio broadcasting activities heretofore carried on by the radio broadcasting department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, under the general designation of WEAF, will be incorporated under the name Broadcasting Company of America.&quot; Unpublicized at the time were ongoing intense negotiations between AT&amp;T and the radio group companies, led by RCA, about the status of the cross-licensing agreements, and the overall future of the broadcasting industry. AT&amp;T&#x27;s consolidation of its radio activities into the BCA subsidiary allowed for two possible outcomes: if AT&amp;T decided to withdraw, then the transfer of its radio operations would be simplified, otherwise, the new entity could continue to be run semi-independently of the parent corporation.

During BCA&#x27;s short existence, the standard WEAF chain configuration consisted of 17 stations, concentrated in the northeastern United States, but also extending westward to WDAF (now KCSP) in Kansas City, Missouri. Individual evening hourly station rates ranged from $170 for three stations located in smaller communities to $480 for flagship WEAF. The standard charge for an hour of evening programming over the entire roster of stations was $4,080, before any applicable discounts.

===BCA sale to the Radio Corporation of America===
Although the WEAF network operations were profitable, AT&amp;T ultimately decided it was best to withdraw from radio broadcasting. The result was a total of twelve agreements, dated July 1, 1926, but signed six days later, between AT&amp;T and the radio group companies. Included was the sale of BCA&#x27;s assets, principally WEAF and its associated chain operations, to RCA for $1 million. A Consolidated Press Association wire service review of the transaction noted that the sum paid reflected WEAF&#x27;s position in the industry, as it represented a substantial premium over what other radio stations were commanding in the marketplace, and estimated that 4/5ths of the purchase price for WEAF represented good-will and the securing of the use of AT&amp;T&#x27;s lines.

The sale was initially kept secret from the staff and the general public, and did not become publicly known until July 21. AT&amp;T&#x27;s press release announcing the sale stated that although operation of WEAF and the WEAF chain had been financially successful, the company had concluded that &quot;while the technical principle was similar to that of the telephone system, the objective of the broadcasting station was quite different from that of a telephone system. Consequently, it has seemed to us after years of experimentation, that the broadcasting station which we have built up might be more suitably operated by other interests.&quot;

== National Broadcasting Company (NBC) era ==

On September 13, 1926, RCA&#x27;s chairman of the board Owen D. Young and president James G. Harbord announced the formation of the National Broadcasting Company, Inc., to begin operations upon RCA&#x27;s acquisition of WEAF on November 15. WEAF became the flagship of the NBC Red Network, which sometimes would still be referred to as the WEAF chain, while WJZ became the originator of the NBC Blue Network.

On November 11, 1928, the Federal Radio Commission implemented a major reallocation under the provisions of its General Order 40. This introduced frequencies reserved for &quot;clear channel&quot; stations, and WEAF was assigned exclusive nighttime operation on 660 kHz.

In 1941, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced RCA give up one of its radio networks, citing antitrust concerns, by announcing that it would no longer license radio stations that were affiliated with an organization operating more than one network. This ruling was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court two years later, and RCA decided to keep the flagship station WEAF and the Red Network, which was rebranded as the NBC Radio Network after the Blue Network was divested, along with several stations (including WJZ), to Edward J. Noble. The Blue Network was renamed the American Broadcasting Company.

WEAF&#x27;s call letters were changed to WNBC in 1946, then to WRCA in 1954, and back to WNBC in 1960. The decline of scripted network radio programming in the late 1950s saw the station gradually relaunched into a middle-of-the-road musical format.
===1960s===

By the early 1960s, the station gradually switched from NBC network programs to more local-oriented programs and adjusted its music policy from traditional standards to incorporate more popular hits while staying away from harder rock and roll. In the late 1960s, it adopted a talk format, the first in New York radio. Hosts included genial morning-drive companion Big Wilson, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; announcer Ed McMahon, New York–based actor Robert Alda, NBC Radio comedian/satirist Mort Sahl, the witty mid-morning game-show host (&quot;Fortune Phone&quot;) Sterling Yates, late-morning talk radio provocateur Joe Pyne, midday voices Lee Leonard and later Jim Gearhart, sports talk host Bill Mazer, plus late-nighters Brad Crandall (later of NFL Films) and Long John Nebel.

On weekends, WNBC aired almost all of the NBC Radio Network&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; program, which featured many of WNBC&#x27;s own hosts as well as the already established lineup holding court at NBC&#x27;s Radio Central (Gene Rayburn, Henry Morgan, Bill Cullen, David Wayne, Kitty Carlisle and Wayne Howell). Later in the decade, WNBC shed its &quot;Conversation Station&quot; format and readopted a middle-of-the-road (MOR) music format, covering songs from the 1940s to the 1960s with non-rock and soft rock hits recorded after 1955. The format would feature such artists as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, The Everly Brothers, Tom Jones, The 5th Dimension, Peggy Lee, and Dionne Warwick.

Hosts during this transition back to music included Wilson, Jack Spector (formerly of WMCA), Jack Hayes, Charlie Brown and later Ted Brown, hired away from then-dominant MOR station WNEW. Well-known MOR host and vocalist Jim Lowe joined WNBC for a time during one of his many shuttles to and from WNEW. Former WMCA morning man Joe O&#x27;Brian joined WNBC during this time. By 1971, music from such acts as Sinatra and Cole would disappear, with a few exceptions, separating WNBC from its WNEW-like beginnings while WNEW also began to also move away from the more traditional artists as well (only for them to return to a more traditional Big Band format 10 years later).

=== Adult contemporary relaunch ===
Don Imus was hired in November 1971, giving New York its first exposure to the shock jock genre. Imus stayed with the station for most of the next two decades, except for a couple of years in the late 1970s when there was a general purge of the air staff and a short-term format flip to a music-intensive top 40 approach. Despite somewhat different formats, WNBC saw itself as a mostly unsuccessful competitor to New York top 40 powerhouse WABC. Thus, they brought in Murray &quot;the K&quot; Kaufman in 1972, and Wolfman Jack opposite WABC&#x27;s Bruce &quot;Cousin Brucie&quot; Morrow in 1973. This did not improve ratings much. By 1973, WNBC was a mainstream top 40-leaning adult contemporary music radio station featuring The Carpenters, Paul Simon, Carole King, The Stylistics, Neil Diamond, James Taylor, and other artists of that era. They also began to play more 1960s-era rock and roll oldies, including the Motown artists, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and The Rolling Stones, at that point.

Ted Brown would leave in the early 1970s and return to WNEW. In 1974, NBC Radio&#x27;s new president, Jack G. Thayer, formerly of WGAR in Cleveland, hired John Lund from WNEW to be program director. Then, WNBC hired Bruce Morrow away from WABC to take over the evening shift. In addition to Imus in the morning, Lund moved Cousin Brucie to middays, hired Bob Vernon (&quot;Vernon with a V&quot;) for afternoons, Oogie Pringle for early evenings, and Dick Summer for late nights. Other new DJs included Norm N. Nite, who arrived from WCBS-FM in 1975. Lund departed the following year, while Joe McCoy was hired. Mel Phillips was program director at the time of McCoy&#x27;s hiring. By 1975, WNBC was playing an Adult Top 40 format, trying to compete with WABC. The station&#x27;s playlist featured hits from 1964 to then-current music. By this time, artists such as the Eagles, Billy Joel, Steve Miller, Fleetwood Mac, Bee Gees, Donna Summer, and disco acts, among others, were mixed in. Unfortunately, despite or because of the continuous tweaking of WNBC&#x27;s format, the station remained in the second tier of New York stations.

In 1977, Bob Pittman was hired as WNBC&#x27;s new Program Director, replacing Mel Phillips. His first decision was to lay-off all of the station&#x27;s personalities, some of which were veterans (including Don Imus, Cousin Brucie, Norm N. Nite and Joe McCoy), replacing them with younger-sounding disc jockeys from Boston and medium markets. He also shifted the format from adult top 40 or hot AC to a more aggressively current-based top 40 format, with occasional nods to FM radio (such as commercial-free hours). As a result of this tweaking, the station was now playing artists such as Andy Gibb, KC and the Sunshine Band, Boston, Peter Frampton, Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Billy Joel and the Bee Gees, among others. However, listenership actually went down, and while some of the new air personalities would find success (Johnny Dark, Frank Reed, and Allen Beebe would be heard on the station well into the 1980s), others would not (Ellie Dylan, who replaced Imus in morning drive, would be gone within months). By 1979, Pittman would leave WNBC (he would soon become the founder of MTV), John Lund was hired back as program director (from KHOW in Denver), and Imus returned to the morning show. Under program director John Lund, WNBC&#x27;s playlist was tweaked back to an adult top 40 format, and ratings increased by 50% to surpass WABC by the summer of 1980.
=== &quot;The Next One&quot; ===
In the early 1980s, WNBC continued as an adult-leaning Top 40 radio station. The best days of WNBC were from the fall of 1980 until the fall of 1983, when the station was consistently in or near the top 5. When Lund returned as program director in late 1979, WNBC general manager Robert Sherman set the goal: &quot;Beat WABC&quot;, which had been New York&#x27;s #1 station for decades. Lund launched the &quot;Twice as Many&quot; contest promoting &quot;twice the music, twice the prizes, and twice as many chances to win&quot;. As New York&#x27;s #2 station (behind WABC), &quot;WNBC had to be twice as good to be #1&quot;. WNBC promotion director Dale Pon (who later created the successful &quot;I Want My MTV&quot; campaign) created its slogan &quot;The Next One&quot;, meaning that it would be the number-one ranked AM music station in New York City. As part of that campaign, TV commercials and subway boards softened the image of the cantankerous Don Imus by including two cute twin blonde little girls saying &quot;We&#x27;re #2&quot; and blanketing the New York City metro area.

When an Arbitron report was released that WNBC believed confirmed that it was in fact the most popular AM music radio station in New York City, the slogan was changed to &quot;The New One&quot;. Also in 1980, to differentiate its call letter similarity with WABC, Lund got Imus and other talents to over-emphasize the letter N when saying the station name: &quot;66 W-NNNN-B-C&quot;. Within a year, Imus was #1 in the morning and WNBC surpassed WABC in Arbitron ratings. WNBC added American Top 40 with Casey Kasem late in 1980. In reality, WABC&#x27;s ratings had begun to nosedive in 1978–79, and by the time WNBC beat them in 1980, it was only good enough for sixth place in the market (behind WBLS, WKTU, WOR, WCBS-FM and WRFM).

In 1981, John Lund left WNBC to begin his consulting and research firm in San Francisco, and the station&#x27;s assistant PD R.E. &quot;Buzz&quot; Brindle served as interim program director until Kevin Metheny was hired in the late Spring. WNBC began moving to an AC format similar to sister station WYNY. With the shift, hard rock songs were eliminated during the day; at night, the station was slightly hotter, playing a limited number of rock songs. At that time, WNBC and WYNY were sort of fraternal twin stations (playing identical types of music but presented differently, and their music mix was somewhat different for both current and gold songs). By summer 1982, WNBC was near the top with some of their best ratings ever.

Once WABC switched to their present-day all-talk format on May 10, 1982, WNBC added a few rock songs that were not heard on any AC stations in the area. In the fall of 1982, to much fanfare, Long Island native Howard Stern was brought in from WWDC-FM in Washington, D.C., to do afternoon drive. Initially, Stern played a considerable amount of music, much to his dismay, though his ratings were high. Then, in 1983, with ABC-owned WPLJ evolving to a Contemporary hit radio (CHR) format, as well as WHTZ&#x27;s debut with the same format, WNBC began to lose some listeners. WNBC lost &quot;American Top 40&quot; to WPLJ in November 1983. The station performed well through 1984.

In the spring of 1984, Dale Parsons took over as program director. After that, Stern cut down his music load, eventually playing only four songs an hour and began to talk much more. In overnights beginning in the spring of 1984, WNBC added taped Wolfman Jack shows which featured oldies from the 1960s with some 1950s and early 1970s music, with current and 80&#x27;s hits mixed into rotation and pre-recorded voice tracks of Wolfman Jack announcing the songs, making the show sound live.

===Decline of WNBC===
On September 30, 1985, Howard Stern was terminated abruptly, supposedly due to corporate pressure. In &quot;Private Parts&quot;, Stern detailed how WNBC management expected that his last day would be September 26, and that Stern would not go in to work on September 27 due to Hurricane Gloria. However, Stern went in, and because there was no station management on hand, Stern did his show as normal, refusing to cover the problems related to the storm. Ironically, he spent much of the show insisting that he was leaving the station, because he had learned that Soupy Sales had signed a syndication contract that had long been withheld from Stern.

After Stern&#x27;s dismissal and subsequent debut on then-rival New York station WXRK, WNBC&#x27;s ratings plummeted, and they were under a two-share by the spring of 1986. Initially, they played a bit more music and then went through several temporary afternoon hosts. Afternoons were back to about 12 songs per hour. The music was more of a gold-based adult contemporary format with many oldies and moderate amounts of current product. In the spring of 1986, Joey Reynolds moved into afternoons with a talk-intensive show while playing six songs an hour. Wolfman Jack was dropped in overnights in favor of various weekend announcers playing the regular AC rotation. Weekends had Bill Grundfest doing a talk intensive show a few hours each day playing six songs an hour. Despite these changes, by the fall of 1986, WNBC was in a ratings crisis.

At approximately 4:42 p.m. on October 22, 1986, the station&#x27;s &quot;N-Copter&quot; traffic helicopter crashed into the Hudson River, killing traffic reporter Jane Dornacker and severely injuring pilot Bill Pate. As millions of WNBC listeners heard Dornacker giving her traffic report, she stopped abruptly as a grinding noise could be heard in the background (likely the copter engines going overspeed). Dornacker then screamed in terror, &quot;Hit the water! Hit the water! Hit the water!&quot;, as the radio transmission was suddenly cut off and a very shaken Joey Reynolds, working as radio host, awkwardly tried to figure out what had happened by saying &quot;Okay, we&#x27;re going to play some music here, I think&quot;, and then played &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot; by Huey Lewis and the News. Dornacker had recently gotten back to flying in a helicopter after surviving a previous crash of the N-Copter into the Hackensack River in New Jersey a few months earlier on April 18. An episode of NBC&#x27;s television show &quot;Third Watch&quot; featured a similar incident (although it may have been more of a reference to the crash of WNBC-TV&#x27;s helicopter, which crashed into the Passaic River in New Jersey over a decade later, with no deaths).

WNBC had a turnover of programming in early 1987. On February 23, the music-intensive AC mix with various people was dropped on overnights in favor of Alan Colmes, who would also do a talk intensive show and only six songs per hour. On February 27, 1987, Joey Reynolds&#x27; show was ended and Bill Grundfest temporarily moved into this time slot. On March 9, 1987, Alan Colmes moved to afternoons and continued to play four songs per hour. Joey Reynolds did not run his own board and had Big Jay Sorensen as his producer and board operator. Since Colmes ran his own board, Sorensen moved to the overnight shift and did a music intensive show. This show was now marketed as &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, playing oldies from 1955 to 1974 (emphasizing 1964–1969), complete with old jingles and an echo effect, resulting in a sound similar to WABC&#x27;s during its Top 40 heyday. Two weeks later, on March 23, 1987, Soupy Sales had found out that there were plans to end his show; at that point, he walked off midway through with Dale Parsons finishing the show. Weekender and assistant programming director Jim Collins moved into that time slot with a gold-based music intensive show on a temporary basis. Then, on April 6, 1987, a couple weeks after Soupy Sales left, his former sidekick Ray D&#x27;Ariano moved back into the 10 am to 2 pm weekday time slot, but was now playing 1955–73 oldies while focusing on 1964–69. His show was music intensive, playing about 12 oldies an hour.

In the summer of 1987, WNBC considered going all oldies, running &quot;The Time Machine&quot; full-time, with the exception of Knicks and Rangers games, and Imus in the Morning. Instead, they increased the amount of oldies programming, but not on a full-time basis. Therefore, WNBC modified their format, keeping Imus in the morning, playing a few AC cuts and a couple oldies an hour with his usual talk. Alan Colmes continued hosting the afternoon drive talk show, but dropped music altogether. In evenings, Dave Sims continued with sports talk along with Knicks and Rangers games. &quot;The Time Machine&quot; remained on overnights, but was now expanded to full-time on weekends with hosts Dan Taylor (laid off from WHN when they became WFAN), &quot;Big&quot; Jay Sorensen, &quot;The Real&quot; Bob James, Jim Collins, Lee Chambers, Dale Parsons, Carol Mason and others. Ray D&#x27;Ariano continued his midday weekday oldies show, but was not part of the &quot;Time Machine&quot; programming. His show had newer WNBC jingles, no echo sound effects, and slightly softer songs. From the Summer of 1987 to the station&#x27;s demise on October 7, 1988, WNBC&#x27;s format was classified as Adult Contemporary, but they only played adult contemporary cuts during Imus&#x27;s show. The actual format was block programming featuring AC and talk in morning drive; all-oldies on Middays, overnights, and weekends; talk on weekday afternoons; and sports talk weekday evenings and whenever the Knicks or Rangers played a game. It was difficult to classify WNBC&#x27;s format at that point.

=== The launch of sports radio on 1050 ===

At 3:00 p.m. on July 1, 1987, Emmis Communications-owned WFAN signed on at 1050 kHz, replacing country music station WHN, and billing itself as the world&#x27;s first 24-hour-per-day sports talk station. (The WFAN call sign was suggested by the wife of &quot;The Fan&#x27;s&quot; first program director, John Chanin.) The first live voice heard on WFAN was that of Suzyn Waldman, with a sports update, followed by the first show, which was hosted by Jim Lampley. Waldman reported for the station, covering the New York Yankees and New York Knicks for 14 years. Other hosts besides Lampley during WFAN&#x27;s fifteen months at 1050 kHz included Bill Mazer, Pete Franklin, Greg Gumbel, Art Shamsky, and Ed Coleman. Ann Liguori is also one of the original hosts and was the first woman to host a show on the station. &quot;Hey Liguori, What&#x27;s the Story&quot; aired the first weekend the station was on the air in 1987 and continued until 2008. WFAN also inherited broadcast rights to the defending World Series champion New York Mets from WHN, who had held the rights since 1983; Mets games stayed on WFAN until 2013.

=== WFAN moves to 660 ===
In early 1988, General Electric (GE), which owned NBC through its purchase of RCA two years earlier, announced that it would close NBC&#x27;s radio division and sell its owned-and-operated stations. In February of that year, GE made a multi-station deal with Emmis; in New York City, the WNBC license for 660 was included in the sale. On October 7, 1988, at 5:30 pm, WFAN changed frequencies to replace WNBC at 660 kHz. The last voice heard on WNBC was that of Alan Colmes, who counted down the seconds to WNBC&#x27;s demise with the NBC chimes (the notes G-E-C) playing in the background.

In the complicated switch that saw WFAN move to the 660 frequency, the 1050 frequency that was formerly the home of WFAN became that of Spanish-language WUKQ, owned by Spanish Broadcasting System (SBS). However, SBS already owned an AM station in the market, Newark, New Jersey–based WSKQ at 620 kHz. In those days, FCC rules stipulated that companies could own only one AM station per market. As a result, SBS received a temporary waiver to run 1050 while exploring the sale of either AM frequency. SBS chose to keep 620, and 1050 was traded to Forward Communications, which owned WEVD, then at 97.9 FM. After that deal was approved, WEVD&#x27;s call letters and programming moved to 1050 AM, and SBS took over 97.9 as WSKQ-FM. The October NBC-Emmis switch also saw Emmis&#x27;s WQHT (then at 103.5 MHz.) move to 97.1 MHz., which had been the home of NBC&#x27;s WYNY. Emmis sold the 103.5 frequency to Westwood One, which also acquired the WYNY call letters and its country music format.

As it had before when it took over the frequency formerly belonging to WHN, WFAN inherited broadcast rights from WNBC as WFAN to this day operates under WNBC&#x27;s original license. The switch to 660 AM added the New York Knicks and New York Rangers to their lineup along with the Mets, who moved down the dial with the station.

In the end, WFAN retired two of the oldest radio call letters from the dawn of commercial radio: WHN and WNBC.

== The WFAN era ==
=== After the switch ===
As Don Imus had already been the morning show host at WNBC, WFAN left his program in place when they took over the frequency. WFAN&#x27;s original morning show on 1050 was hosted by Greg Gumbel; his was a straightforward sports show, but it was not doing well in the ratings. At the time of the switch, sports talk radio was still an untested format with questionable prospects, and the idea was that bringing on board a host who appealed to a broader audience would get more people to give the station a try. WFAN also benefitted from having Imus&#x27;s fans - who were used to tuning into 660 kHz on weekday mornings - in place to listen to other shows. WFAN instantly took advantage of its Imus inheritance; for example, it featured a special live monologue by Imus character &quot;Billy Sol Hargus&quot; from Shea Stadium moments after taking over the 660 frequency. Imus slightly altered his show for his new employer, adding sports updates and replays of last night&#x27;s big plays. Discussions of sports stories that crossed over to general interest were also featured on the program, although Imus also kept many of his regular comedy bits that were not sports-related.

Initially, WFAN aired sports news and score updates every 15 minutes (at the quarter-hour), but by 1991, began doing updates every 20 minutes (at :00, :20 and :40 past the hour). These updates, called &quot;20-20 Sports Flashes&quot;, are now considered an industry standard. Additionally, in a nod to the former WNBC, update anchors often end their top-of-the-hour updates with the catchphrase &quot;And &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; what&#x27;s happening ...&quot;, which is how WNBC on-air news readers had ended their updates. WFAN discontinued the thrice-hourly updates on January 2, 2018; updates now occur only at the top of the hour.

Other programming that WFAN had at its launch included a mid-morning show with Ed Coleman and Mike Francesa, and an afternoon drive time show with Pete Franklin, who in Cleveland had become one of the first polarizing, outrageous talk show hosts. During his stay in New York City, Franklin was probably best known for an incident where he used a four-letter expletive on air, in error, when trying to say &quot;All you folks&quot; (he was not disciplined for the incident).

Running a close second was a 30-second Franklin diatribe on whether he had been offensive – &quot;Do I offend anyone? I&#x27;m not here to offend you, dammit!&quot; – that has been replayed ever since, especially on the July 1 WFAN anniversaries.

In a further drive to boost ratings, Imus instigated a feud with Franklin, much as he had with Howard Stern at WNBC in the mid-1980s. Both Imus and Franklin took shots at each other during their shows, with Franklin calling Imus &quot;Minus&quot;, and Imus recording parodies of radio commercials where he bashed Franklin as a &quot;dinosaur&quot;, among other things. Ratings did not increase, and Franklin left WFAN in August 1989.

On September 5, 1989, a jointly hosted afternoon drive show with Francesa and Christopher &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Russo – the latter a weekend/fill-in host prior to that time – would premiere. The &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; show became the defining show of WFAN, one of the most consistently popular radio shows in New York City and one of the most influential sports talk radio shows in the country.

===Radiothon===
Each spring from 1990 until 2007, WFAN conducted the &quot;WFAN Radiothon&quot; to benefit children&#x27;s charities that seek to ensure the continuity of life in its earliest stages and the treatment and eventual elimination of childhood cancer. The three most recent beneficiaries of the radiothon were Tomorrow&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Fund, the CJ Foundation for SIDS, and the Imus Ranch. WFAN has also done other radiothons and special broadcasts to raise money for assorted charities.
The combined success of &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; and &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; helped WFAN become the number-one billing station in America during the 1990s. It also proved that the all-sports format worked as a radio format, prompting the explosion of sports talk radio across the country.

On August 15, 2008, Mike Francesa announced during the final broadcast of &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; that WFAN would broadcast a new fundraising radiothon. The new fundraiser would benefit both the Boomer Esiason Foundation for cystic fibrosis research, and the Mike Francesa Champions of the Heart Foundation, a new charity created by Francesa. The first radiothon took place in September 2008.

===Sale to Infinity===
In 1992, Emmis sold WFAN to Infinity Broadcasting, which would be purchased by Westinghouse Electric Corporation – CBS&#x27; then-parent company – in 1997.

===Midday show controversy===
The midday slot has been one of the better slots from a ratings perspective for WFAN. However, this slot&#x27;s hosts have often found controversy.

In the mid-1990s, popular hosts Ed Coleman and Dave Sims had their show cancelled. WFAN then announced that &quot;New York Daily News&quot; columnist Mike Lupica and WNBC-TV sports anchor Len Berman would co-host the new midday program. The show seemed all set to go when, at the last minute, Berman had a change of heart. He cited that he would have to work a near 14-hour day, combining his 10 a.m. start on radio with his WNBC-TV duties, which consisted of him appearing on all three of the station&#x27;s evening newscasts. WFAN would not let Berman out of his contract, and as a result, the slot was split into two shows: Lupica hosted from 10 a.m. to noon, while Berman hosted from noon to 2 p.m. The split format did not work: Berman&#x27;s show was cancelled and Lupica&#x27;s soon followed.

WWOR-TV sports anchor Russ Salzberg, who also worked an evening sportscast, was more than willing to assume the midday show duties. In 1995, he was joined by longtime overnight host Steve Somers and the show became known as &quot;The Sweater and The Schmoozer&quot;, playing off Salzberg&#x27;s habit of wearing sweaters on the air and Somers&#x27; on-air nickname.

The midday show featured one of the most famous incidents in WFAN history. It occurred when Salzberg &quot;banned&quot; Eli from Westchester from calling his show due to comments that Salzberg considered to be inappropriate. In another incident, Salzberg said to Somers, during an Atlanta Braves World Series appearance, while talking about Braves&#x27; manager Bobby Cox: &quot;What about Cox, Steve? You like Cox ... don&#x27;t you, Steve?&quot;

In 1999, with the ratings not being what WFAN management expected, the Salzberg/Somers show was cancelled and both men were fired. However a large outcry from listeners over the termination of the popular Somers—one of those unhappy listeners being comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a native of Long Island—led to WFAN management giving Somers the evening shift, which (despite frequent pre-emptions for live games) he continued to hold until his retirement in 2021, when he was replaced by Keith McPherson. In middays, Salzberg and Somers were replaced by Suzyn Waldman and Jody McDonald. Waldman had been with WFAN since its infancy, as she was the first update anchor, and had served as the station&#x27;s Yankees beat reporter and the Knicks&#x27; studio host. McDonald, one of the original WFAN personalities (and son of former Mets general manager Joe McDonald), was the weekend overnight host before leaving for sister station WIP in Philadelphia, nearer to his southern New Jersey home. Both Waldman and McDonald had their fans and detractors at WFAN.

Waldman would leave WFAN in late 2001, joining the Yankees television broadcast team the following year. She would be replaced by Sid Rosenberg who, despite his shock jock reputation, had a vast knowledge of sports. Many felt there was great chemistry between McDonald and Rosenberg. However, the ratings still weren&#x27;t what WFAN expected and in 2004 McDonald was let go. He later joined WEPN, Sirius Satellite Radio, and WPEN radio in Philadelphia before returning in 2012. Overnight host Joe Benigno moved to daytime to replace McDonald and work with Sid Rosensberg. In 2014, Waldman returned to become the first woman color commentator for the station&#x27;s Yankees broadcasts.

Rosenberg was forced to resign from WFAN on September 12, 2005, after being given an ultimatum by station management for not showing up to host the New York Giants&#x27; pregame show the day before. Benigno hosted the weekday midday show solo for over a year, until January 2, 2007, when part-time overnight host Evan Roberts became Benigno&#x27;s new midday co-host. The pairing continued to consistently out-rate rival station WEPN, which broadcasts network and local programming opposite it. Benigno retired in November 2020 and was replaced by former morning host Craig Carton.

WFAN was the sole flagship of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship carried over Westwood One, but beginning in 2006, competitor WEPN took over a majority of the coverage. That included early round games as well as conference tournament finals to which Dial Global had the rights. WFAN aired some of the conference tournament games, but would not usually air the early round tournament contests, opting instead for local programming. WFAN does broadcast some of the tournament, but the majority—including the Final Four and the National Championship Game—is carried by WEPN-FM.

===Streaming===
On April 11, 2006, WFAN started streaming live on the Internet. Web streaming of live games, however, is limited due to broadcast rights (Yankees and Nets games are offered separately, through the MLB and NBA websites respectively, as annual subscriptions). When these games are broadcast over the air, listeners who have Internet access receive alternate sports talk programming through CBS Sports Radio. As of April 2010, WFAN stopped streaming live on the Internet to listeners outside of the United States.

===Exit Imus, enter Boomer and Carton===
On the April 4, 2007, broadcast of &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot;, Don Imus made a sexually and racially controversial comment in reference to the Rutgers University women&#x27;s basketball team, during a conversation with the show&#x27;s producer, Bernard McGuirk, and Sid Rosenberg (who was on the phone).

Two days after making the comments, Imus issued a public apology. By that time, however, there were various calls for his dismissal, particularly from civil rights activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, who threatened to protest both CBS Radio and MSNBC (which aired a video simulcast of the program), and to boycott companies who advertised on the program. WFAN offered its hosts and listeners a sounding board for their own feelings and comments, which were both for and against his dismissal.

Imus was initially given a two-week suspension which was scheduled to begin on April 16, allowing him to work the annual WFAN Radiothon on April 12 and 13. On consecutive days, Imus made public appearances to address the controversy, first on Sharpton&#x27;s syndicated radio show (April 9) followed the next day on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; (April 10) to reiterate his regret for the remarks. However, on April 11, MSNBC announced the cancellation of the video simulcast of &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot;. The following day, CBS Radio dismissed Imus, at the time leaving WFAN with a very large programming—and money-earning—void in its schedule.

Imus&#x27; last WFAN program was aired on the opening day of the radiothon. Imus&#x27;s wife Deirdre joined his longtime co-host, comedy writer, and news reader, Charles McCord, to anchor the final segment of the radiothon on April 13. Imus revived his program at WABC radio in December 2007, and took his fundraiser with him—with the charities intact—and conducted a radiothon there in May 2008.

WFAN afternoon drive co–hosts Mike Francesa and Chris Russo expressed disappointment with Imus&#x27;s comments, but vehemently disagreed - on air - with the decision to fire Imus. Russo said that management had chosen to &quot;cave&quot; to the pressure.

From that point on, the 6:00 to 10:00 a.m. time slot was filled by various hosts. McCord and Chris Carlin remained on all the replacement shows as assistants and staff, in similar roles as they were on Imus&#x27;s show, and the replacement shows continued to be syndicated via Westwood One. Mike Francesa and Chris Russo were the first to fill the spot, hosting for the two weeks (April 16–27) immediately after Imus&#x27; firing. Francesa and Russo also worked the shift separate from each other, as did fellow WFAN staffers Richard Neer, Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts, and Carlin, who worked both alone and with co-hosts, notably Kimberly Jones and &quot;Washington Post&quot; sports columnist John Feinstein.

WFAN and Westwood One also brought in outside personalities into the slot. Among them were Boomer Esiason, Patrick McEnroe, Geraldo Rivera, Lou Dobbs, and Chicago market sports radio host Mike North. As MSNBC also held its own claim to the slot, the cable network was able to have its own replacement shows simulcasted; these programs were hosted by in-house personalities David Gregory, Jim Cramer, and Joe Scarborough; eventually Scarborough would become the permanent replacement host on MSNBC with &quot;Morning Joe&quot;.

===Twentieth anniversary===
On July 1, 2007, WFAN celebrated its twentieth anniversary. On the weekend of July 4, past WFAN hosts such as Suzyn Waldman and Jim Lampley did guest-hosting stints, and the station&#x27;s current hosts provided career and station retrospectives throughout the weekend. The station also invited listeners to vote on the &quot;Greatest New York sports moments&quot;, and the &quot;Top 20 New York sports celebrities&quot;, during WFAN&#x27;s 20-year history.

On September 4, 2007, Esiason took over as the permanent host of the WFAN morning show, with veteran radio personality Craig Carton (previously of WKXW-FM in Trenton, New Jersey) serving as co-host, and Chris Carlin remaining to do sports updates. The new program is not distributed nationally by Westwood One. Charles McCord left the station shortly after the announcement was made and rejoined Don Imus at WABC. Carlin was also given his own show in the one-hour time slot immediately preceding Esiason&#x27;s show. The television simulcast, which had been on MSNBC since 1996, was not immediately brought back; it was not until September 2010 that WFAN reached an agreement with MSG Network to simulcast &quot;Boomer and Carton&quot; live each weekday; each four-hour show was simulcast live with a condensed one-hour &quot;best-of&quot; program airing later each day and throughout the weekend. In January 2014, the show&#x27;s televised simulcast moved to CBS Sports Network.

===The end of &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot;===

During their 19-year run as WFAN&#x27;s afternoon drive team, Mike Francesa and Chris Russo had enjoyed a relationship—both on- and off-air—which varied from respect to contempt. The two hosts did not get along well during the early days of their partnership, and had several differences which potentially put their program in jeopardy. In spite of the disagreements, the duo always seemed to patch things up for the benefit of the station and their listeners.

In early 2008, several reports surfaced that Francesa and Russo were on the outs again, and these reports came as both men&#x27;s contracts with WFAN were in the early stages of renegotiation. On June 22, 2008, sports columnist Neil Best of &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that the Francesa/Russo relationship had cooled, and they were considering ending their radio show. Francesa, reached by &quot;Newsday&quot; while vacationing, refused to comment. Russo, doing the show alone on June 23, denied the rumors. But on the June 27, 2008, broadcast, Francesa (working alone as Russo was on vacation) acknowledged the show was at a &quot;crossroad&quot;, and could not guarantee the show would last through the summer. Francesa also stated he and Russo had not spoken since reports of their possible breakup came out.

On July 11, 2008, Francesa and Russo reunited for their first show together since news of their possible breakup came out. Both men were coy about their future beyond the summer. Francesa and Russo then continued their normal summer routine of alternating vacation weeks, and on August 5, 2008, they would do their final show together at the New York Giants&#x27; training facility at the University of Albany.

On August 14, 2008, Russo reached a mutual agreement with WFAN to let him out of his contract, which ran until October 2009. Russo insisted it was solely a personal decision and said, &quot;This has nothing to do with Mike and I hating each other... This is about doing something different. I&#x27;m 48 years old and there are not going to be too many more opportunities to break away. It&#x27;s time to try something else, but it was a tough decision to make.&quot; On August 15, Russo phoned Francesa on the show to say goodbye. A highly emotional Russo began to break down on air as he talked about his partnership with Francesa.

At the same time, while Russo left WFAN, Francesa signed a five-year deal to stay at WFAN and continue to host the afternoon drive-time show. On August 19, 2008, Russo signed a five-year contract worth about 3 million per year with Sirius XM to headline a new sports talk channel called &quot;Mad Dog Radio&quot; on both Sirius and XM satellite radio. Russo said there was nothing WFAN could have done to keep him after Sirius XM provided him an opportunity to not only do a show, but have his own channel, which he could not pass up.

===Move to Manhattan===
On October 10, 2009, WFAN moved from its first studio location, the landmarked Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens, after 22 years in that location. The station began broadcasting from CBS Radio&#x27;s then-new Hudson Square studios in Manhattan. Along with the move, the station changed its longtime call-in phone number from 1 (718) 937-6666 to 1 (877) 337-6666.

===Honors===
In 2010, the station was honored by the National Association of Broadcasters with the Marconi award for Sports Station of the Year.

===Controversy===
In 2012, WFAN drew controversy for a New York City Subway ad that discouraged fans from offering their seats for pregnant women wearing Boston Red Sox gear. Detractors viewed the ad as taking fan attitudes in the Yankees/Red Sox rivalry too far.

===Twenty-fifth anniversary===
On June 25, 2012, notable current staff announced their favorite moments, interviews, and teams.

On June 28, 2012, it was revealed that Mike Francesa would join Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton on the &quot;Boomer and Carton&quot; program on June 29, 2012, as part of the festivities. It marked the first time they had appeared together since 2009, when Francesa was still the number one sports talk show host in New York. Later in the day, Carton and Esiason would join Francesa on his show, &quot;Mike&#x27;s On: Francesa on the FAN&quot;.

The same day—Carton surprised everyone by welcoming back host Sid Rosenberg, and Rosenberg later joined Francesa for a short interview the next day. Other notable former hosts who joined Mike Francesa included Christopher &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Russo and Don Imus.

===WFAN-FM===
On October 6, 2012, CBS Radio announced the purchase of WRXP (101.9 FM) from Merlin Media for $75 million. CBS began operating 101.9 under a local marketing agreement (LMA) at 11:57 p.m. on November 1, 2012, with the call sign changed to WFAN-FM.

===Merger with Entercom===
On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Philadelphia-based Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated eight days later.

On March 30, 2021, Entercom rebranded to the corporate name Audacy. WFAN programming is found on the Audacy.com website and app.

===Craig Carton arrest===
Carton was arrested on September 6, 2017, along with Michael Wright, and charged with four counts of fraud in what authorities say was a Ponzi scheme that duped investors of millions of dollars by promising them a share of the profits from the sale of concert tickets. The two were reportedly trying to pay off millions of dollars in gambling debts. Carton was suspended indefinitely by CBS Radio and later resigned from the station. (After his release from prison, Carton returned to the airwaves to partner midday with Evan Roberts, as mentioned above.) Esiason hosted the morning show by himself with guest hosts, until Gregg Giannotti was announced as Carton&#x27;s full time replacement.

==Team coverage==

Currently, WFAN airs broadcasts of MLB&#x27;s New York Yankees, the NFL&#x27;s New York Giants, the NBA&#x27;s Brooklyn Nets, and Rutgers University football. In addition, select games of the NHL&#x27;s New Jersey Devils are carried by WFAN, though the bulk of the Devils&#x27; schedule is aired exclusively on the co-owned Audacy streaming service (formerly known as Radio.com). WFAN is the flagship outlet for Westwood One&#x27;s NFL broadcasts and some of its National Collegiate Athletic Association college football and basketball broadcasts.

In years prior to 2019 WFAN used corporate sisters WCBS (AM), WCBS-FM, WNEW-FM and WNYL, and non-sister stations including WNYM, WBBR and WLIB, as outlets for overflow broadcasts when teams are scheduled opposite each other. This was due to contractual terms requiring the Yankees (prior to 2014, the New York Mets) and Giants to have first priority of airtime over the other teams carried by WFAN. Beginning in 2018, WFAN began to split its AM and FM simulcast to allow the station to simultaneously air two events, albeit one on each frequency. When conflicts arise, the station will direct its audience to listen to the game of their choice on either 660 AM or 101.9 FM. The simulcast splits became more regular in 2019 after WCBS (AM) began carrying Mets radio broadcasts.

WFAN has marketed itself in recent years as the &quot;Flagship Station for New York Sports&quot;. In previous years, Yankees managers (more recently, Aaron Boone) and a member of the Giants (such as, in the past, former quarterback Eli Manning) have made exclusive appearances on WFAN during their respective baseball and football seasons.

The station was the longtime radio home for the Devils, Mets, New York Jets, New York Rangers and New York Knicks (the latter two were inherited from WNBC while the Jets coverage was moved from WCBS). Currently, WFAN&#x27;s primary competition is WHSQ (the former WCBS AM) and WEPN, the New York ESPN Radio affiliates which now carry the Mets, Knicks and Rangers plus national ESPN Radio programming, all of which WFAN previously broadcast.

During the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons, WFAN broadcast New York Islanders games produced by Hofstra University-owned WRHU in Hempstead. Beginning in 2018-19 both the Devils and Islanders moved their broadcasts to the Radio.com platform, though WFAN is expected to broadcast a limited number of Devils contests. The station also carried matches of New York City FC during its inaugural 2015 season. In 2022, the station became the home for Rutgers Scarlet Knights football, replacing longtime flagship station WOR. In August 2024, with WCBS taken over by Good Karma Brands, rights to Scarlet Knights men&#x27;s basketball also moved to WFAN.

Due to MLB and NFL blackout rules, WFAN is only allowed to air sporting events involving the New York-area teams within its home market; therefore, stations that carry WFAN on a HD radio subchannel are required to broadcast alternate programming in its place.

In 2024, after the Yankees entered the 2024 World Series, WFAN was required to air the World Series coverage on both AM and FM broadcasts. As such, WFAN will utilize WINS, WXBK, and a new online overflow stream called WFAN2 to air overflow coverage of Rutgers Football, New York Giants, and Brooklyn Nets coverage until the World Series concludes.

==Influence of sports format==
WFAN&#x27;s success—especially after the 1988 frequency switch—proved that sports-talk radio could in fact be a steadily profitable and popular format. This in turn fueled the explosive growth of sports-talk radio in the 1990s and 2000s (decade). Once a novelty, every major market (and many smaller markets) now has at least one sports radio station, and often more. ESPN Radio, Fox Sports Radio and Yahoo! Sports Radio have all launched 24-hour national sports talk radio networks, while NBC Sports Radio and
CBS Sports Radio (now Infinity Sports Network, the latter of which WFAN would become a member of) debuted in fall 2012. There are also nationally syndicated radio shows, such as &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot; and &quot;2 Live Stews&quot;. Additionally there are dedicated sports radio streams on satellite radio, such as NFL Radio on Sirius and MLB Home Plate on XM Satellite Radio. With the migration of music stations to FM and other carriers all but complete, sports talk radio are considered to have been critical in saving the AM band as a viable broadcast medium.

It is worth noting that, for all the success and influence that WFAN has had, its signature &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; show experienced limited syndication outside of New York state (the show had been carried over WQYK in Tampa, Florida, and WROW in Albany, New York). This was primarily due to a desire by the hosts to keep their show New York-centric.

WFAN once produced some of Fox Sports Radio&#x27;s programming, notably Chris &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Russo&#x27;s Saturday show, but the relationship did not last even one year for the same reason that &quot;Mike&#x27;d Up&quot; is syndicated nationally only through the YES Network—the hosts often talk about the NFL on a national basis, but stick mostly to local coverage of baseball. Nevertheless, callers from as far as California and Norway made it to air.

==Frequent callers==
Callers are an important facet of WFAN programming. A few callers have earned a reputation over the years and become as familiar to listeners as the hosts themselves.

;Jerome from Manhattan
Jerome Mittelman, known on-air as &quot;Jerome from Manhattan&quot;, is a die-hard Yankees and Knicks fan. Jerome is known for his on-air take-no-prisoners blistering rants and raves, as well as his unique take on the English language. One of his favorite exclamatory phrases is &quot;frickin&#x27; frack!&quot; He refers to the bullpen as the &quot;ballpen&quot;, and once shouted that the Yankees are &quot;... done! D-O-E-N [sic], DONE!&quot; His relationship status is intriguing enough for Steve Somers to once give Jerome $60 to take a lady out on a date, only for Jerome to keep the money and not go out on the date. Former host Sid Rosenberg once asked Jerome if he was upset that he was not taking his eagerly anticipated trip &quot;... to Colorado?&quot;, and Jerome replied, &quot;No, [it was] to Denver.&quot; He does &quot;... not like jets. They make [him] seasick&quot;. Jerome, when he still called WFAN regularly, was known as being the only caller to have an audio intro, much like those played at the top of each show. Mr. Mittelman&#x27;s health problems had kept him from the WFAN airwaves on a regular basis from late 2004 until mid-2008; when he again started to call in more frequently. Occasionally when he calls into Steve Somers&#x27; program, a special introduction is played to the tune of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

;Eli from Westchester
Eli Strand, known when calling as &quot;Eli from Westchester&quot;, was another famous repeat caller. Citing racism as the underlying factor behind any number of sports happenings, he was occasionally banned from calling for periods of time. One of the most famous times he was banned was by former mid-day host Russ Salzberg. However, he was also given an on-air tryout for the job which would eventually go to Joe Benigno. Strand, from Tuckahoe, New York, played college football at Iowa State University and spent two years in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers and New Orleans Saints.

;Miriam from Forest Hills
&quot;Miriam from Forest Hills&quot; is a blind New York Islanders and New York Mets fan from Queens. The first Islanders game Miriam ever attended became the topic of a Rick Reilly column in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

;Dave from Harlem
David Paterson, former Governor of New York, has been known to call into the station on occasion. He has also used the alias &quot;David from Manhattan&quot;. After the end of his term, Paterson sporadically appeared as a guest host and in-studio guest for the station; Paterson accepted a job with WOR in August 2011.

;Doris from Rego Park
Doris Bauer was one of the best-known late-night regular callers to WFAN. Calling in as &quot;Doris from Rego Park&quot; for a decade, Bauer was recognized by her chronic hacking cough, an encyclopedic knowledge of baseball, and her loyalty to the Mets. She called to talk sports on the overnight show with hosts like Steve Somers. Such was her status as a beloved member of the WFAN talk community that, when she died at 58 of complications from lung and breast cancer, it was host Joe Benigno who broke the news to his late-night audience at 1 am, Doris&#x27; usual call–in time.

;Omar from Brooklyn
&quot;Omar from Brooklyn&quot; is another regular called on the Boomer and Carton Show. An avid Buffalo Bills fan, Omar&#x27;s trademark is to call in on a Monday to rant (often incoherently due to his thick accent) about the Bills shortcomings and his hatred for other New York teams. During these calls there is usually Middle Eastern music playing in the background, courtesy of WFAN. Boomer and Carton had Omar in studio as a guest, and Omar received a pie in the face from Boomer. Omar also received tickets from Boomer to a Jets-Bills game in 2011.

;Ira from Staten Island
Ira Lieberfarb is a frequent caller from Arden Heights, Staten Island that almost exclusively talks New York Jets football. Ira has been calling the station since 1993 and attends every Jets game (both home and away). In 2012, he was rewarded with a one-on-one conversation with Mike Francesa after being voted as one of the most famous callers during WFAN&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebration.

;Mike from Mahopac
Mike &quot;Sour Shoes&quot; DelCampo, a voice impersonator also known for his long association with &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, was best known for calling in to &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot;. Francesa eventually tired of DelCampo&#x27;s schtick and stopped taking his calls.

;Kevin from Camden
A die–hard Knicks, Mets, Yankees, Giants and Jets fan. He is extremely passionate about his sports teams and regularly calls WFAN on the weekends to talk about how his teams performance was that particular night or week.

==The FAN Sports Network==
In addition to having its broadcast heard on 660 AM in New York City, WFAN&#x27;s programming is also transmitted via a secured internet feed to Audacy owned and operated stations. These stations simulcast the same over-the air feed that is heard in New York City including all of the live team coverage of the New York Yankees, New York Giants, New Jersey Devils, and the Brooklyn Nets. The internet stream legally cannot include professional sports coverage because Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Football League, provide their own in-house on-demand and yearly subscription services for live and archived radio and television broadcasts. WFAN&#x27;s simulcasts make it one of only a handful of terrestrial based radio superstations in the United States; KPIG-FM in Freedom, California, and WBBR in New York also syndicate terrestrially, though through different providers.

<doc id="1196902" wikidata="Q208135" url="?curid=1196902" title="Saif al-Islam Gaddafi">
<text>Saif al-Islam Muammar al-Gaddafi (; born 25 June 1972) is a Libyan political figure. He is the second son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his second wife Safia Farkash. He was a part of his father&#x27;s inner circle, performing public relations and diplomatic roles on his behalf. He publicly turned down his father&#x27;s offer of the country&#x27;s second highest post and held no official government position. According to United States Department of State officials in Tripoli, during his father&#x27;s reign, he was the second most widely recognized person in Libya, being at times the &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister, and was mentioned as a possible successor, though he rejected this. An arrest warrant was issued for him on 27 June 2011 by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for charges of crimes against humanity against the Libyan people, for killing and persecuting civilians, under Articles 7(1)(a) and 7(1)(h) of the Rome statute. He denied the charges.

Gaddafi was captured in southern Libya by the Zintan militia on 19 November 2011, after the end of the Libyan Civil War, and flown by plane to Zintan. He was sentenced to death on 28 July 2015 by a court in Tripoli for crimes during the civil war, in a widely criticized trial conducted &quot;in absentia&quot;. He remained in the custody of the &quot;de facto&quot; independent authorities of Zintan. On 10 June 2017, he was released from prison in Zintan, according to a statement from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Battalion. Later the same month, his full amnesty was declared by the Tobruk-based government led by Khalifa Haftar. , Gaddafi remained wanted under his ICC arrest warrant for crimes against humanity. On 14 November, he attempted to register as a candidate in the 2021 Libyan presidential election, but was rejected. This decision was overturned less than a month later, reinstating him as a presidential candidate.

==Early life and career==
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering science from Tripoli&#x27;s Al Fateh University in 1994. However, another report states that he is an architect. After several countries, including France and Canada, refused to grant him a student visa, Saif earned an MBA from the Imadec business school in Vienna, where he became friends with OPEC official Shukri Ghanem and Austrian far-right politician Jörg Haider. Upon his arrival in Vienna, Saif was granted permission by the Mayor of Vienna and the head of Schönbrunn Zoo to keep his pet tigers at the zoo. According to Simon McDonald, Saif still had a white tiger at his farm near Tripoli in the late 2000s, but the white tiger was later turned into a rug in Saif&#x27;s &quot;majlis&quot;.

Saif&#x27;s paintings made up the bulk of the international Libyan art exhibit, &quot;The Desert is Not Silent&quot; (2002–2005), a show which was supported by a host of international corporations with direct ties to his father&#x27;s government, among them the ABB Group, Siemens, Petro-Canada, Bombardier, and SNC-Lavalin.

In 2002, Saif sued &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; for libel over a 1995 article that alleged he had masterminded an international money-laundering conspiracy. The lawsuit was settled after the intervention of Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud with &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; agreeing to publish an apology and pay a portion of Saif&#x27;s legal costs.

In 2005, Gaddafi was awarded a &quot;Young Global Leader&quot; title by the World Economic Forum. In January 2011, WEF founder Klaus Schwab personally invited Saif to attend the annual WEF Forum in Davos.

Gaddafi was awarded a PhD degree in 2008 from the London School of Economics, where he attended amid a series of contacts between the school and the Libyan political establishment. He presented a thesis on &quot;The role of civil society in the democratisation of global governance institutions: from &#x27;soft power&#x27; to collective decision-making?&quot; Examined by Meghnad Desai (London School of Economics) and Anthony McGrew (University of Southampton), among the LSE academics acknowledged in the thesis as directly assisting with it were Nancy Cartwright, David Held and Alex Voorhoeve (the son of former Dutch minister Joris Voorhoeve). Professor Joseph Nye of Harvard University was also thanked for having read portions of the manuscript and providing advice and direction. Alongside accusations of plagiarism, allegations abound that Saif&#x27;s thesis was in many parts ghost-written by consultants from Monitor Group, which earned $3 million per year in fees from Muammar Gaddafi.

Speaking in Sabha on 20 August 2008, Gaddafi said that he would no longer involve himself in state affairs. He noted that he had previously &quot;intervene[d] due to the absence of institutions&quot;, but said that he would no longer do so. He dismissed any potential suggestion that this decision was due to disagreement with his father, saying that they were on good terms. He also called for political reforms within the context of the Jamahiriya system and rejected the notion that he could succeed his father, saying that &quot;this is not a farm to inherit&quot;.

Saif, who was considered a reformist, had a longstanding rivalry with his hardline brother Mutassim and his influence began to wane after the lifting of international sanctions. In November 2010, Saif&#x27;s independent newspaper was suspended after it published an article calling for a “final assault” on his father&#x27;s government. His newspaper also defended his father&#x27;s former chief of protocol Nuri Mesmari, who had defected to France earlier that month. Some of his allies, including 20 reporters, were arrested.

===Charity and social affairs===
Gaddafi was the president of the Libyan National Association for Drugs and Narcotics Control (DNAG). In 1998, he founded the official charity, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations, which intervened in various hostage situations involving Islamic militants and the crisis of the HIV trial in Libya and the resulting European Union-Libyan rapprochement.

In 2009, both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch were allowed entry to Libya, via Gaddafi&#x27;s non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation in Libya. While AI and HRW reported that there were concerns about the &quot;repressive atmosphere,&quot; both felt there were signs of &quot;improvement&quot; and HRW said that one should not &quot;underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far&quot; by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya.

In December 2010, Gaddafi announced that his charity foundation &quot;will no longer be involved in promoting human rights and political change in the North African country,&quot; and that instead, it &quot;will focus on its &#x27;core charitable mission&#x27; of delivering aid and relief to sub-Saharan Africa.&quot; 

The board meeting of the foundation was moved from Tripoli to London due to hostilities from hardliners of his father&#x27;s regime.

==International diplomacy==
Gaddafi was instrumental in negotiations that led to Libya&#x27;s abandoning a weapons of mass destruction programme in 2002–2003. He arranged several important business deals on behalf of the Libyan regime in the period of rapprochement that followed. He was viewed as a reformer, and openly criticized the regime:

In 2003, he published a report critical of Libya&#x27;s record on human rights.

On 10 December 2004, shortly before a trip by Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin to Tripoli, in an interview with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; Gaddafi requested a formal apology from the Canadian government, for joining U.S.-led sanctions against Libya after the Lockerbie bombing, and for denying him a student visa to study in Canada in 1997. His request was met with incredulity in Canada, and the Canadian government announced that no apology would be forthcoming.

===HIV trial===
Gaddafi played an important role in the HIV trial in Libya. At first, he rejected information the medics were tortured. &quot;During this time we saw Gaddafi&#x27;s son on a television broadcast categorically denying that Libya still tortured suspected criminals&quot;, claimed Valya Chervianashka, one of the accused nurses in her autobiography. Later he admitted in interviews that the Bulgarian nurses, charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, had been tortured and that the government had denied them a fair trial. His admissions were said to have badly damaged his reputation in Libya.

The torture process is confirmed and described in details in the book &quot;Notes from Hell&quot;, co-written by one of the nurses, Valya Chervianashka. Saif al-Islam was mentioned several times in the book. According to her:

One day, the executive director of Muammar al-Gaddafi&#x27;s son&#x27;s foundation, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations (GICDF), arrived at the prison, inviting us to the director&#x27;s office of the women&#x27;s wing for a meeting. We were in our pyjamas, dishevelled and unprepared. We hastily put on some clothes and hurried to meet the director. A Libyan man along with Ambassador Lyudmil Spassov and Roumen Petrov waited for us outside the office. The Ambassador told us, &quot;This is a very important person. He will help you; he is on your side.&quot; Saleh Abdel Salam, executive director of GICDF, was intimidating. We didn&#x27;t realise it then, but this Libyan man would indeed help us in the future.

===Isratine proposal===
Saif introduced the Isratine proposal to permanently resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through a secular, federalist, republican, binational one-state solution.

===Philippine peace process===
Gaddafi served as Chairman of the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charitable Associations. In this role, he was involved in a number of humanitarian initiatives. Saif&#x27;s first foray into international diplomacy was serving as an intermediary between the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group and the Government of the Philippines in August 2000. Notably, he hosted peace talks between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Tripoli. In the resulting peace agreement concluded on 22 June 2001, Gaddafi was expressly thanked for his involvement. He was also the witness to the signing of the peace agreement. The peace agreement forms a part of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro concluded in 2014.

===2008 agreement with Italy===
Gaddafi was involved in negotiating compensation from Libya&#x27;s former colonial power, Italy, and on 30 August 2008 a Friendship, Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was signed in Benghazi by his father and Italy&#x27;s Prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. However, the treaty was unilaterally suspended by Italy at the beginning of 2011, after Italy refused to consider Gaddafi government as their interlocutor.

===Compensation for American terror victims===
He was also negotiating with the United States in order to conclude a comprehensive agreement making any further payments for American victims of terror attacks that have been blamed on Libya – such as the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and the 1989 UTA Flight 772 bombing – conditional upon U.S. payment of compensation for the 40 Libyans killed and 220 injured in the 1986 United States bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi. On 14 August 2008, the U.S.-Libya Comprehensive Claims Settlement Agreement was signed in Tripoli. Former British Ambassador to Libya Oliver Miles described the agreement as &quot;a bold step, with political cost for both parties&quot; and wrote an article in the online edition of &quot;The Guardian&quot; querying whether the agreement is likely to work.

In an August 2008 BBC TV interview, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said that Libya had admitted responsibility (but not &quot;guilt&quot;) for the Lockerbie bombing simply to get trade sanctions removed. He further admitted that Libya was being &quot;hypocritical&quot; and was &quot;playing on words&quot;, but said Libya had no other choice on the matter. According to Gaddafi, a letter admitting &quot;responsibility&quot; was the only way to end the economic sanctions imposed on Libya. When asked about the $10m (£5.3m) compensation that Libya was paying to each victims&#x27; family, he again repeated that Libya was doing so because it had no other choice. He went on to describe the families of the Lockerbie victims as &quot;trading with the blood of their sons and daughters&quot; and being very &quot;greedy&quot;, saying, &quot;They were asking for more money and more money and more money&quot;.

===Diplomacy for extraditing Libyans===
Interviewed by French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; on 7 December 2007, Gaddafi said that the seven Libyans convicted for the Pan Am Flight 103 and the UTA Flight 772 bombings &quot;are innocent&quot;. When asked if Libya would therefore seek reimbursement of the compensation paid to the families of the victims (US$2.33 billion), Gaddafi replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Gaddafi led negotiations with Britain for the release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the convicted Pan Am 103 conspirator. In August 2009, after Scotland&#x27;s Cabinet Secretary of Justice Kenny MacAskill ordered Megharahi&#x27;s release, Saif drafted letters to Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland, and Simon McDonald, foreign policy adviser of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, thanking them for their support, which led to accusation of undue political influence in the Megharahi case.

In 2007, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi met with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Tripoli, with whom it is alleged he helped broker an arms deal, including missiles.

In November 2008, Gaddafi made a high-profile visit to the United States where he met with US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. During the meeting, Rice raised the case of Libya&#x27;s jailed political dissident and democracy activist, Fathi El-Jahmi. In a &quot;Forbes&quot; article in 2009, Fathi&#x27;s brother wrote that &quot;for nearly a year, both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch hesitated to advocate publicly for Fathi&#x27;s case, because they feared their case workers might lose access to Libyan visas.&quot;

In 2009, Saif al-Islam welcomed Sarah Leah Whitson, director of Human Rights Watch&#x27;s Middle East division, into Libya, accompanying her in meeting with many government officials and others during her visit. She wrote of her official visit that &quot;the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization, the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development&quot; chaired by Gaddafi. She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country&#x27;s two semi-private newspapers, and said &quot;it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far. Let&#x27;s hope this spring will last.&quot;

===Stand-off with US officials===
In 2009, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi claimed that Libya&#x27;s opinion of him was shaped largely by his role in Libya&#x27;s engagement with the West, saying &quot;If something goes wrong, people will blame me, whether I am in a certain official position or not.&quot; He expressed frustration with the US, saying Libya&#x27;s decision to give up its weapons of mass destruction program was contingent upon &quot;compensation&quot; from the US, including the signing of the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, economic cooperation, and cooperation in purchasing conventional weapons and military equipment. He stated, &quot;We share rich natural resources – oil and gas – along the borders, yet we have no capacity to defend that wealth.&quot; Because of a US legal embargo, Libya cannot purchase weapons from the United States, Sweden, or Germany, and has been disallowed from buying &quot;Tiger&quot; vehicles with American-manufactured engines from Jordan. He asked for greater military assistance, as Libya had committed itself to destroying chemical stockpiles, but would require at least $25 million to do so. Gaddafi said the United States had &quot;humiliated&quot; his father during his visit to New York City in 2009, and said that his father&#x27;s tent and residence issues were disappointing and his UN speech had been misinterpreted. Gaddafi said that his father was barred from visiting Ground Zero, which also frustrated him. Gaddafi held a standoff with US officials in November 2009, refusing to send a shipment of Highly Enriched Uranium back to Russia unless the United States renewed its commitment to cooperation with Libya.

==Libyan civil war==
===Early phase and ceasefire efforts===
Saif was allegedly supportive of the Tunisian Revolution and cautiously optimistic of the 2011 Egyptian revolution in the early phase of the Arab Spring. On 19 February, several days after the Arab Spring came to Libya, Saif al-Islam announced the creation of a commission of inquiry into the violence, chaired by a Libyan judge, as reported on state television. He stated that the commission was intended to be &quot;for members of Libyan and foreign organizations of human rights&quot; and that it would &quot;investigate the circumstances and events that have caused many victims.&quot; He also circulated an op-ed to several American newspapers calling for reform and a new constitution, but every newspaper rejected it. Later in the month, he went on state television to deny allegations that the government had launched airstrikes against Libyan cities and stated that the number of protesters killed had been exaggerated. 

On 20 February 2011, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi delivered an address to the nation on Libyan state television stating that if no agreement could be found between protesters and the government &quot;thousands of deaths, and rivers of blood will run through Libya&quot;. He also insisted that his father remained in charge with the army&#x27;s backing and would &quot;fight until the last man, the last woman, the last bullet.&quot; Speaking on Libyan state TV, Saif al-Islam blamed the civil war on tribal factions and Islamists acting on their own agendas, drunken and drugged. He promised reforms, and said the alternative would be civil war blocking trade and oil money and leading to the country being taken over by foreigners. He closed by saying, &quot;We will not let Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and BBC trick us.&quot; Oliver Miles, a former British Ambassador to Libya, disagreed with his assessment while public intellectual Benjamin Barber, a board member of the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations, defended Saif as a reformer and called for Western engagement with Saif as the best way to end the bloodshed. In an interview with ABC News reporter Christiane Amanpour, Saif al-Islam denied that his father&#x27;s regime was killing civilians. On 21 February 2011, the World Economic Forum cut off contacts with Saif al-Islam and suspended him from the Forum of Young Global Leaders. On 19 March 2011, Saif al-Islam cut off contact with Western journalists due to NATO&#x27;s military intervention in Libya.

On 27 April 2011, Saif al-Islam came to an agreement with Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and senior NTC figure Ali Zeidan to end the war, but the deal was vetoed by Britain and France.

=== Death of Saif al-Arab and ICC arrest warrant ===
On 2 May 2011, Saif al-Islam and his older half-brother Muhammad were among the 2,000 mourners who attended his younger brother Saif al-Arab&#x27;s funeral. He was seen touching his younger brother&#x27;s chest while fighting back tears before leaving the graveside while pumping his fist to the crowd. Saif al-Arab and three of Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s grandchildren had been killed by a NATO airstrike on 30 April 2011.

In June 2011, Saif al-Islam and his father, Muammar, announced that they were willing to hold elections, and that Muammar Gaddafi would step aside if he lost. Saif al-Islam stated that the elections could be held within three months and transparency would be guaranteed through international observers. NATO and the rebels rejected the offer, and NATO soon resumed their bombardment of Tripoli.

On 27 June 2011, an arrest warrant was issued by the ICC. On 1 July, Saif al-Islam had an interview with Russia Today, where he denied the ICC&#x27;s allegations that he, or his father, ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He pointed out that he was not a member of the government or the military, and therefore had no authority to give such orders. According to Saif al-Islam, he made recorded calls to General Abdul Fatah Younis, who later defected to the rebel forces, requesting him not to use force against protesters, to which Younis responded that the protestors were attacking a military site, where surprised guards fired in self-defence. Younis was later assassinated by his fellow rebels on 28 July, allegedly for secret communication with Saif.

Saif al-Islam condemned NATO for bombing Libyan civilians, including his family members and their children, under the false pretence that their homes were military bases. He stated that NATO offered to drop the ICC charges against him and his father if they accept a secret deal, an offer they rejected. He thus criticised the ICC as &quot;a fake court&quot; controlled by NATO member states.

On 3 August 2011, Saif al-Islam gave an interview to the &quot;New York Times&quot; stating that Libya was becoming more closely aligned to Islamists and would likely resemble Iran or Saudi Arabia. Saif al-Islam said that his father was working closely with Islamists within the rebellion to splinter the resistance.

=== Fall of Tripoli and escape to Bani Walid ===
On 21 August 2011, the National Transitional Council claimed that Saif al-Islam was arrested by the National Liberation Army, pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. However, on the early morning of 23 August, Saif al-Islam was sighted by Western journalists apparently moving around under his own free will outside the Rixos Hotel. He was later interviewed by Matthew Chance of CNN, where he claimed his father was also still in Tripoli and report of his arrest was a &quot;trick&quot; by rebels.

After the fall of Tripoli, Saif al-Islam called into Arrai TV and claimed that he was still in a suburb of Tripoli on 31 August. He later went to Bani Walid, but reportedly left on 3 September after attending the funeral of his brother Khamis. On 5 September, another brother, Saadi, said in an interview with CNN that an &quot;aggressive&quot; speech by Saif al-Islam had led to the breakdown of the negotiations between NTC forces and Gaddafi loyalists in Bani Walid. Shortly after Saadi fled to Niger on 11 September, another brother, Mutassim, was said to have crossed paths with Saif for the last time. Their last encounter was acrimonious as Mutassim allegedly blamed Saif&#x27;s yesteryear reforms for causing their family&#x27;s downfall. On 20 September, Arrai TV broadcast footage of Saif rallying his father&#x27;s supporters, promising them weapons, and appealing to them to retake Tripoli. Contrary to previous reports, Saif al-Islam apparently stayed in Bani Walid until the town was captured by NTC forces in early October.

===Capture===

On 17 October 2011, after leaving Bani Walid, Saif&#x27;s convoy was hit by a NATO air attack at Wadi Zamzam where he lost 26 of his supporters and 9 military vehicles. His right hand was wounded and according to his own explanation it happened during the NATO air strike. According to the Libyan Al Mashhad Al Leebi program, the fingers of his right hand were cut off.

With the death of his father Muammar and his brother Mutassim in Sirte on 20 October 2011, Saif al-Islam was the only member of the Gaddafi family left in Libya. He appeared on Syrian pro-Gaddafi television on 22 October claiming &quot;I am in Libya, I am alive and free and willing to fight to the end and take revenge&quot;, but his whereabouts were unknown and subject to many rumors. On 24 October 2011, a National Transitional Council source claimed that Saif had been given a forged passport near Murzuk and was in the Ghat area near the border of Niger and Algeria. The same source claimed that Abdullah Senussi was helping Saif plot his escape.

An international team of lawyers representing the interests of Saif al-Islam wrote to US leaders demanding that he be protected from assassination and holding the United States and NATO responsible for the Libyan leader&#x27;s &quot;brutal assassination&quot; and repeated attacks on Libya&#x27;s civilian population.

On 19 November 2011, as Saif al-Islam was trying to flee from Libya, he and four aides were captured, and detained about west of the town of Ubari near Sabha in southern Libya, from Tripoli. Sources say that it was the betrayal by a Libyan nomad, Yussef Saleh al-Hotmani, that finally led to his capture. Yussef Saleh al-Hotmani told the interviewers that he was hired to guide a man to Niger and that he was offered €1 million for the job. Being offered such a huge sum of money, he suspected foul play as Saif&#x27;s agent did not tell him whom he was going to guide. He contacted the rebel fighters and told them where a two vehicle convoy would pass through southern Libya on the night of 18 November and this allowed the rebel fighters to ambush the convoy. Saif was taken to Zintan by plane and, pending trial, he was kept in detention by the Zintan-militia that captured him.

A differing account was provided by Ejmi al-Atiri of the Zintan Brigades. According to al-Atiri, Saif never offered them money in exchange for his release, but instead asked to be shot in the head. In addition to three severed fingers, Saif also had wounds in his abdomen and his flanks and it was arranged that he be operated on in Zintan. He was operated on by Andrei Murakhovsky, a Ukrainian doctor working in Zintan, who disputed the rumor that Saif&#x27;s fingers had been cut off and claimed that his injuries were consistent with &quot;some kind of explosion.&quot; Dr. Murakhovsky claimed that his fingers were gangrenous and thus needed to be amputated to prevent osteomyolitis. The operation took four hours, and he needed daily medical monitoring for two months. Al-Atiri stated that Saif insisted he never paid foreign mercenaries to fight for his father and had no choice but to support his father due to traditional family loyalty. Atiri&#x27;s account was corroborated by Saif&#x27;s former aide Youssef Sawani, who had defected to the rebels and stated that Saif was not able to betray his family.

In a video filmed on the day of his capture, Saif was seen warning his captors about the danger posed by Islamists, namely Abdelhakim Belhaj and Ali al-Sallabi. 

== Criminal charges and trials ==

Based on his outstanding warrant the International Criminal Court (ICC) asked the new government about Saif al-Islam Gaddafi&#x27;s detention. The new government was unable or unwilling to comply with the ICC&#x27;s information requests regarding Saif al-Islam. New deadlines for information requests from the ICC were also missed. A brief filed by the Office of Public Counsel for the Defence on behalf of Gaddafi claimed that &quot;there is no basis for asserting that the ICC should defer the case to Libya&quot;. The brief requested the court to order Libya to immediately implement Gaddafi&#x27;s rights, and report Libya to the Security Council if it does not.

In June 2012, Australia lawyer Melinda Taylor and three other members from an ICC delegation were arrested by Zintan while visiting Saif and accused of passing coded messages to Saif. They were freed a month later in a deal brokered by ICC President Sang-Hyun Song. In August 2012, the Libyan government announced that Saif al-Islam would stand trial in the western Libyan town of Zintan, in September 2012. However, the trial was subsequently delayed; Saif al-Islam appeared in court in Zintan on 17 January 2013. However, trial was again delayed, and it wasn&#x27;t until April 2014 that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi appeared in court in Tripoli, via video link for security reasons.

Libya appealed his extradition to the Hague Court (ICC), but the court affirmed the indictments. The court held that the Libyan government failed to show that Saif al-Islam faced the same charges in Libya as he did in the ICC.

On 28 July 2015, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was sentenced to death in absentia for war crimes by the &quot;self-declared government&quot; in Tripoli, Libya (he was being held in Zintan, not where the trial was held). However, the Zintan authorities have consistently refused to either hand him over to the Tripoli authorities or to implement their sentence. The trial and the sentence have been criticised by the United Nations human rights office (OHCHR) and by Human Rights Watch.

In July 2016, one of his lawyers, Karim Khan, claimed that his client had been freed on 12 April of that year and transferred to a secret location after the government quashed his sentence, and that he would petition the ICC to drop all charges against him. His release was corroborated by Ejmi al-Atiri, but a Zintan military source denied that he had been released.

In November 2016, the &quot;Middle East Eye&quot; reported that while Saif al-Islam was still officially a prisoner, he was free to travel around Zintan and frequently communicated through the Viber smartphone app.

In May 2017, Saif al-Islam allegedly survived an assassination attempt in Zintan by local militias.

== Release and return to politics ==
=== Speculations on whereabouts and political future ===
On 10 June 2017, Saif al-Islam was released from prison in Zintan, according to a statement from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Battalion. The militia chose not to transfer him to the custody of the International Criminal Court, saying &quot;We are not concerned with the international tribunal as the ICC did not ask us to hand him over&quot;. The UN-backed Libyan government based in Tripoli condemned his release while an ICC prosecutor was still trying to verify the release, and called on Libya and other states to arrest and surrender him, stating &quot;Libya is obliged to immediately arrest and surrender Mr Gaddafi [...] regardless of any purported amnesty law.&quot; Saif&#x27;s lawyer, Karim Khan, could neither confirm nor deny Saif&#x27;s freedom, but claimed that he was in regular contact with Saif and had previously visited him in the autumn of 2016.

On 22 June 2017, rumors circulated among Gaddafi loyalists that Saif al-Islam would make a TV appearance on Qadr Night, but Saif did not show and his whereabouts remained unknown. He was rumored to be in Ubari with the pro-Gaddafi Tuareg commander, Ali Kanna. In August 2017, &quot;Libyan Herald&quot; refuted claim that he was ever in Ubari and reported that he was instead in the Wershefana region west of Tripoli. However, Wershefana sources denied this and claimed that he was in Bani Walid. Bani Walid sources claimed that Saif had asked to go there, but was rejected as some elders feared it would divide the community and risk attack.

In October 2017, Ghassan Salamé, the head of United Nations Support Mission in Libya, asserted that Saif al-Islam might be allowed to take part in the political reconstruction of Libya.

In December 2017, Saif allegedly claimed to a US source that he was building an army and his forces had taken control of Sabratha. His claim was unverified and it was possible that he was taking credit for other armed groups&#x27; operations. He was allegedly aligned with the Warshefana tribal militia, but Warshefana had gotten into a turf war with his other ally the Zintan Brigades over road checkpoints and smuggling routes.

On 17 February 2018, on the seventh anniversary of the outbreak of the First Libyan Civil War, &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot; reported from tribal sources that several international parties were prodding extremists linked to al-Qaeda to assassinate Saif al-Islam. The same sources refused to divulge Saif&#x27;s whereabouts.

Gaddafi&#x27;s spokesman stated on 22 March 2018 in Tunis that he would run for president in the next Libyan general election under the Popular Front for the Liberation of Libya (PFLL). Ayman Abu Ras, a spokesperson for the party, said that Gaddafi wished to focus on a programme of &quot;reform&quot;, namely reconstruction projects.

In May 2018, the ICC reminded Libyan authorities of the arrest warrant issued against Saif al-Islam, calling for him to be arrested and transferred to the custody of the ICC. The ICC also called for &quot;credible information&quot; that could lead to finding his location.

In July 2018, an audio recording of Saif al-Islam imploring the Tuaregs in Ghat to provide him with fighters was leaked online.

In May 2019, the son of Mohammed Ali Madani alleged that Khalifa Haftar had offered him and Ejmi al-Atiri money to assassinate Saif.

In March 2020, the ICC confirmed that Saif al-Islam&#x27;s case was admissible in the ICC, despite the 28 July 2015 Libyan judgment against him, since the 2015 judgment was carried out &quot;in absentia&quot;, thus not qualifying as final under Libyan law.

In May 2020, it was reported that Turkish intelligence was searching for Saif in the western mountain region southwest of Tripoli to either assassinate him or hand him over to the ICC.

In 2020, Saif reportedly attempted to re-organize the Popular Front for the Liberation of Libya into a new party named “Libya Al-Ghad” (&quot;Libya Tomorrow&quot; in Arabic), but the rebrand was vetoed by the much older Popular Front leaders.

On 14 February 2021, Saif&#x27;s lawyer Karim Khan was elected Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Khan subsequently recused himself from Saif&#x27;s ICC case.

=== Re-emergence as a public figure and presidential campaign ===
On 11 June 2021, &quot;The Times&quot; spoke exclusively with political representatives of Saif, who revealed that he was planning to make a return to public life, including possibly running for president, and had been courting foreign diplomats to re-establish his viability. A direct phone call between &quot;The Times&quot; reporters and Saif was subsequently arranged, where he confirmed his identity and his relationship with the group of aides &quot;The Times&quot; had been speaking with. He also stated that he was in good health.

In a July 2021 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, his first interview with western media in ten years, Gaddafi attacked Libyan politicians for their governance since the 2011 First Libyan Civil War, describing them as having &quot;raped the country&quot;. Gaddafi hinted that he was running for president. Commenting on his years-long absence from public life, he said &quot;You need to come back slowly, slowly. Like a striptease. You need to play with their minds a little.&quot; The July 2021 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview included topics related to Saif&#x27;s political thinking and past actions. Saif defended his father&#x27;s legacy. Saif said of his father&#x27;s Green Book; &quot;It was not crazy, it talked about things everybody is now recognizing.&quot; He said that many &quot;ideas gaining popularity in the West, such as frequent public referendums, employee stock-ownership programs and the dangers of boxing and wrestling&quot;, echoed the words of his father&#x27;s book. His interview was given to the &quot;New York Times&quot; at an opulent two-story villa inside a gated compound in Zintan. According to &quot;The New York Times,&quot; Saif reluctantly agreed to be photographed for the interview, but insisted on covering part of his face with a scarf&quot;.&quot; Until the interview, Saif al-Islam had not been seen since June 2014, when he appeared via video link from Zintan during his trial by the Tripoli court.

Some Libyans questioned the authenticity of photographs taken by &quot;The New York Times.&quot; Ashraf Boudwara, head of the Preparatory Committee for the National Conference, claimed the photos were of Saif&#x27;s brother Saadi Gaddafi. Meanwhile, Gaddafi loyalists celebrated Saif&#x27;s return. Saad al-Senussi al-Barasi, a leader in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Libya, called the skeptics of the photographs, &quot;the enemies of the nation and those who cling to power.&quot;

In October 2021, the &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; reported that a female model representing Saif signed a contract with an Israeli consulting firm to run his presidential campaign.

On 14 November 2021, making his first public appearance since June 2014, Gaddafi confirmed his intention to run for the presidency of Libya, registering his nomination in the southern city of Sebha. On 16 November, Libya&#x27;s High National Election Commission rejected Gaddafi&#x27;s candidacy on grounds that under Libyan law, his criminal convictions disqualified him from holding a political office. On 25 November, gunmen aligned with Khalifa Haftar, under Haftar&#x27;s sons&#x27; command, stormed the courthouse of Sabha and threatened judges and staffers to prevent them from ruling on Saif&#x27;s appeal. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya expressed concerns over the forced closure of the Sabha court and warned that sanctions could be levied against parties responsible. On 28 November, Gaddafi stated to &quot;Al Arabiya&quot; that Libyan judicial authorities refused to hold hearings on his disqualification appeal.

On 2 December 2021, a Libyan court ruled that Saif be reinstated as a presidential candidate. &quot;Al-Araby Al-Jadeed&quot; reported that Saif had secretly visited Egypt and met with President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Egyptian Chief of Intelligence Abbas Kamel before his reinstatement.

On 29 January 2022, through a statement published by his lawyer Khalid al-Zaidi, Gaddafi proposed an initiative to resolve the political crisis that began after presidential elections scheduled for December 2021 were delayed. The initiative proposed postponing presidential elections and proceeding with parliamentary elections without delay.

On 6 July 2022, Saif presented two separate proposals to resolve the ongoing Libyan crisis through a written statement disseminated by his lawyer Khalid al-Zaidi. In the first proposal, Saif argued for the appointment of a neutral party to oversee urgent, non-exclusive presidential and parliamentary elections in which everyone would be allowed to participate. In the second proposal, Saif recommended that all current political figures, including himself, should collectively withdraw from the electoral process in order to make way for new faces chosen by the Libyan people through transparent elections.

In August 2022, Saif, through his lawyer Khaled al-Zaidi, refuted a report from &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; that he had made a deal with Lebanon to secure his brother Hannibal&#x27;s release.

In December, 2022, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah called for Saif to surrender himself to the ICC. In January 2023, Saif&#x27;s political team reiterated his legal right to run for political office despite the ICC arrest warrant.

In July 2023, Saif al-Islam called for Lebanon to release his brother Hannibal from detention, describing Hannibal&#x27;s incarceration as &quot;illegal and inhumane&quot; and &quot;without trial and without just cause.&quot;

In September 2023, Gaddafi blamed the 2011 Libyan civil war which deposed his father and the instability which followed the conflict for the Derna dam collapses. He called the country&#x27;s rival governments &quot;sham governments&quot; and accused the Derna security forces and the forces of Khalifa Haftar of making the situation worse by imposing a curfew on the city rather than evacuating it.

=== Russian ties ===
In May 2019, two Russians affiliated with Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group, Maxim Shugaley and Samer Hasan Ali Sueyfan, were arrested in Tripoli for conspiring with Saif al-Islam. They were released in December 2020.

In September 2020, &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; reported that a Russian airplane took Saif al-Islam from Zintan to Moscow to hold secret meetings. In June 2021, Mahmoud Refaat claimed that Saif had secretly visited Damascus to meet with senior figures of the Bashar al-Assad regime. The secret meeting was brokered by Russia. On 12 August 2021, prosecutors in Tripoli issued an arrest warrant for Saif over suspected links to the Wagner Group.

In March 2023, Al-Jazeera revealed the testimonies of Wagner operative Maxim Shugaley, who alleged that Saif had given Russia incriminating evidence that implicated prominent politicians in France, the US, and Ukraine. Most notably, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, was accused of accepting Libyan money through Algerian intermediaries to fund his campaign in the 2017 French presidential election.

==Personal life ==
There are two different stories about his mother&#x27;s origin. One is that his mother, Safia Farkash, is from a family from the Eastern Libyan Barasa tribe and that she was born in Bayda and was trained as a nurse. The other is that she is of Hungarian descent.

In 2006, the German newspaper &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and the Spanish newspaper &quot;La Voz de Galicia&quot; reported that Saif al-Islam was romantically linked to Orly Weinerman, an Israeli actress and model, they dated from 2005 to 2011. At the time, Weinerman publicly denied having any contact with Saif al-Islam, but she has since admitted it, and in September 2012, she asked former British prime minister Tony Blair to intervene in his trial in order to spare his life.

In 2009, a party in Montenegro for his 37th birthday included well-known guests such as Oleg Deripaska, Peter Munk and Prince Albert of Monaco.

In April 2016, the Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; reported that Saif al-Islam had married in Zintan and had a three-year-old daughter. In his 2021 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Saif denied being married and claimed that he was lonely.

He is rumored to be living in a pied-à-terre near Zintan or further south in the village of Qira, the native village of Abdullah Senussi. His former captor, Ejmi al-Atiri of the Zintan Brigades, provides him with bodyguards, along with the Mashashiya tribe and Russian forces. According to Ejmi al-Atiri, Saif al-Islam has developed the hobbies of camping, night rides in the desert, hunting, and reading since his release from prison.

According to &quot;The Times&quot; in 2017, Saif al-Islam has access to up to $30 billion.

===British society===
In the 2000s, Saif al-Islam was hosted at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle by the British royal family. He also went shooting on Princess Anne&#x27;s estate in Gloucestershire.

In 2009, he spent a weekend at Waddesdon Manor, home of financier Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, where he was the guest of Peter Mandelson and Nathaniel Rothschild. He later stayed at the Rothschild holiday home in Corfu. Nathaniel Rothschild was a guest at Saif&#x27;s 37th birthday celebration in Montenegro.

In May 2010, Saif al-Islam and British supermodel Naomi Campbell corresponded by e-mail to coordinate Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s visit to Libya.

He owned a £10.9 million mansion in the Hampstead Garden Suburb area of London. The property was seized in 2011 and remained unoccupied as of 2022.

==Links with the London School of Economics==

Saif al-Islam received his PhD from the London School of Economics (LSE) in 2008. Through the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation (GICDF), Saif pledged a donation of £1.5 million to support the work of the LSE&#x27;s Centre for the Study of Global Governance on civil society organisations in North Africa. Following the LSE–Gaddafi affair, the LSE issued a statement indicating that it would cut all financial ties with the country and would accept no further money from the GICDF, having already received and spent the first £300,000 instalment of the donation.

Critics have charged that Gaddafi plagiarized portions of his doctoral dissertation and pressure was put on the LSE to revoke his degree. The LSE set up a review process to evaluate the plagiarism charges in early 2011. In November 2011, the review panel stated that the PhD thesis had been &quot;annotated to show where attribution or references should have been made&quot; and recommended that the PhD itself &quot;should not be revoked&quot;.

<text>Mark O&#x27;Connor (born August 5, 1961) is an American fiddle player, composer, guitarist, and mandolinist whose music combines bluegrass, country, jazz and classical. A three-time Grammy Award winner, he has won six Country Music Association Musician Of The Year awards and was a member of three influential musical ensembles: the David Grisman Quintet, The Dregs, and Strength in Numbers.

O&#x27;Connor has released 45 albums, of mostly original music, over a 45-year career. He has recorded and performed mostly his original American Classical music for decades. An expert at traditionally-based fiddle and bluegrass music, he also plays other instruments proficiently, including the violin, guitar and mandolin. He has appeared on 450 albums, composed nine concertos and has put together groundbreaking ensembles. His mentors have included Benny Thomasson who taught O&#x27;Connor to fiddle as a teenager, French jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli with whom O&#x27;Connor toured as a teenager, and guitarists Chet Atkins, Doc Watson and Steve Morse.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Connor was born and raised in the suburb of Mountlake Terrace, Washington, where his father was a construction worker and his mother was a dance teacher. His mother insisted that he learn to play the guitar at the age of five and, by the age of ten had taught himself to play the Flamenco guitar. As an eight-year-old in 1969, O&#x27;Connor watched fiddle player Doug Kershaw perform the song &quot;Diggy Liggy Lo&quot; on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, leaving such an impression on him that he begged his parents to purchase him a fiddle for the next three years before they finally gave him one for his eleventh birthday.

In 1973, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s mother drove him and his little sister from Seattle to Nashville, Tennessee, where a local friend suggested that he might be allowed to play at the Picking Parlour. His performance at the Picking Parlour left the local audience stunned that a twelve-year-old knew so many old-time fiddle songs. A couple of days later, he made his Grand Ole Opry debut, introduced by Roy Acuff, and became the youngest musician to sign a recording contract with Rounder Records.

O&#x27;Connor won national titles on the fiddle, guitar, and mandolin as a teenager. In 1975, at the age of thirteen, O&#x27;Connor won the WSM (AM), Tennessee, and Grand Ole Opry sponsored Grand Masters Fiddle Championships in Nashville, Tennessee, against amateur and professional competitors of all ages. That same year he won another national championship on acoustic guitar, at the National Flat Pick Guitar Championship in Winfield, Kansas.

After graduating from the Mountlake Terrace High School in 1979, O&#x27;Connor joined the David Grisman Quintet as the replacement for guitar player, Tony Rice, and went out on tour with Stephane Grappelli with whom he performed at Carnegie Hall when he was only seventeen-years-old. As a teenager, he was also a member of the seminal instrumental group The Dregs, previously known as Dixie Dregs. At age 19, He won the Buck White International Mandolin Championship in Kerrville, Texas. He is a four-time grand champion (1979, 1980, 1981 and 1984) at the National Oldtime Fiddlers&#x27; Contest in Weiser, Idaho. Several of his teenage albums are noteworthy and inspired a generation of young acoustic musicians, such as &quot;Pickin&#x27; In The Wind&quot;, &quot;A Texas Jam Session&quot;, &quot;Markology&quot; and &quot;False Dawn&quot;.

==Musical career==

O&#x27;Connor composes, arranges, and records American music in genres that include folk, classical, and jazz. His works include concertos, and compositions for orchestra, string quartets, string trios, choral music, solo unaccompanied pieces, folk and bluegrass ensemble and a symphony (see Compositions). After releasing six albums as a teen on Rounder Records, O&#x27;Connor signed a long term record deal with Warner Bros. Records in Nashville. He released a series of instrumental albums such as &quot;Elysian Forest&quot; and &quot;On The Mark&quot; as well as teaming up with Bela Fleck, Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas and Edgar Meyer for &quot;Strength In Numbers&quot;. His first award winning albums that catapulted him into the international stage include &quot;New Nashville Cats&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; both released on Warner Bros.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Fiddle Concerto (1992)&quot;, a violin concerto in American fiddle style commission by the Santa Fe Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, has been performed over 250 times, making it one of the most performed concertos written in the last 50 years. The recording of the concerto was conducted by Marin Alsop and &quot;Concordia Orchestra&quot;.

In 1993, O&#x27;Connor teamed up with Charlie Daniels to record a sequel to Daniels&#x27; 1979 single &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot; entitled &quot;The Devil Comes Back To Georgia&quot;. O&#x27;Connor and Daniels recorded the song alongside Johnny Cash, Marty Stuart and Travis Tritt. The song was on O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s album, &quot;Heroes&quot;. Between 1995 and 2000, O&#x27;Connor teamed up with Yo-Yo Ma and Edgar Meyer to release &quot;Appalachia Waltz&quot; and &quot;Appalachian Journey&quot; spending nearly 2 years at the top of the classical music Billboard charts.

In 1996, O&#x27;Connor composed &quot;The Olympic Reel&quot; for the closing ceremonies of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. It premiered in front of 100,000 people at Centennial Olympic Stadium, as well as 3.5 billion people from the television viewing audience.

In 1997, O&#x27;Connor and others composed and performed music based on folk melodies as arrangements for the American Revolutionary War-era Public Broadcasting Service documentary miniseries, &quot;Liberty! The American Revolution&quot; (the companion album is &quot;Liberty!&quot;). The theme music for the miniseries is O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Song of the Liberty Bell.&quot;

In 1999, he recorded his &quot;Fanfare For The Volunteer&quot; with the London Philharmonic Orchestra for Sony Classical, and one of his most critically acclaimed orchestral pieces &quot;American Seasons&quot;, which alludes to The Four Seasons (Vivaldi), for Sony Classical as well. &quot;American Seasons&quot;, and his &quot;Strings &amp; Threads&quot; Suite (1986) was performed by The Metamorphosen Chamber Orchestra in 2001 at the Great Performers concert at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.

In a review by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;if Dvorak had spent his American leisure time in Nashville instead of Spillville, Iowa, his &quot;New World&quot; Symphony might have sounded like this.&quot; Both &quot;Strings &amp; Threads&quot; Suite and &quot;American Seasons&quot; were recorded for the album The American Seasons, released in 2001 on the label OMAC Records. In 2008 O&#x27;Connor paired up with violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg to record his &quot;Double Violin Concerto&quot; with Marin Alsop and the Colorado Symphony Orchestra for OMAC Records.

Over a period of five years, O&#x27;Connor teamed up with jazz musicians Frank Vignola and Jon Burr for a trilogy of &quot;Hot Swing Trio&quot; albums dedicated to his mentor Stephane Grappelli. O&#x27;Connor recorded &quot;Thirty-Year Retrospective&quot; in 2003 with the mandolinist Chris Thile, guitarist Bryan Sutton, and bassist Byron House. It celebrates his thirty years as a recording artist on his own OMAC label. He also provided the soundtrack to a 30-minute animated film on the story of Johnny Appleseed (and released the music on his 1992 album &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot;), narrated by Garrison Keillor. He contributed four tracks to a 1993 album on the theme of &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;, narrated by Meryl Streep.

His composition Appalachia Waltz (appearing on the album of the same title) has been adopted by Yo-Yo Ma as part of his live performance repertoire. One of his chamber music efforts is his piano trio entitled Poets and Prophets which is inspired by his boyhood hero Johnny Cash. O&#x27;Connor and Rosanne Cash united in double bill concerts for premiering their collaboration. The piece was recorded by the Eroica Trio.

On April 28, 2009, O&#x27;Connor teamed with chamber musicians Ida Kavafian, Paul Neubauer and Matt Haimovitz to present his second and third string quartets, amalgamating bluegrass with classical styles, at Merkin Concert Hall in New York. O&#x27;Connor released the recording for both string quartets under the label OMAC in May 2009.

In 2010, O&#x27;Connor released his &quot;Americana Symphony&quot; recorded by the Baltimore Symphony as well as his &quot;Concerto No. 6 (Old Brass) and released on OMAC Records. In 2011, he released his unique &quot;The Improvised Violin Concerto&quot; on CD and DVD with the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras. Partnering with his wife Maggie (who he married on November 8, 2014), his son Forrest, and his daughter-in-law, they recorded two band albums &quot;Coming Home&quot; for Rounder Records and &quot;A Musical Legacy&quot; for OMAC Records. He also recorded a duets album with Maggie featuring music from the O&#x27;Connor Method. Some of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s albums are or contain tributes to his musical mentors and inspirations, including Niccolò Paganini, Benny Thomasson, and Grappelli. He has recorded solo albums for OMAC Records, Rounder, Warner Bros. and SONY Classical Records.

==The O&#x27;Connor Method==

O&#x27;Connor has developed a string instrument technique for music teachers and students, &quot;The O&#x27;Connor Method — A New American School of String Playing&quot;. The method places an emphasis on music and playing techniques from North America, in addition to focusing on rhythmic development, ear training, and improvisation.

The method is published as a series of books that also contains short essays about famous Americans who played fiddle, such as Johnny Gimble, Ray Nance, Byron Berline, Pinchas Zukerman, Eddie South, Kenny Baker, Benny Thomasson, Scott Joplin, Thomas Jefferson and Davy Crockett, and the history of a wide variety of music including jazz, bluegrass, Romani, western swing, cajun, blues, African American Spirituals, ragtime and Mariachi. Teacher training sessions based on the Method take place around the United States and in other countries including at O&#x27;Connor Method String Camps. The physical edition which includes violin, viola, cello and orchestra method books was released in 2010. In 2020, the books were released as a digital edition for download.

==Awards and honors==
O&#x27;Connor won a Grammy Award three times: in 1991 for Best Country Instrumental Performance, &quot;The New Nashville Cats&quot;; in 2000 for Best Classical Crossover Album, &quot;Appalachian Journey&quot; with Yo-Yo Ma and Edgar Meyer; and in 2016 for Best Bluegrass Album, &quot;Coming Home&quot; by the O&#x27;Connor Band With Mark O&#x27;Connor.
He was named Musician of the Year by the Country Music Association six years in a row (from 1991–96). His collaborative single &quot;Restless&quot; (with Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs and Steve Wariner) won the 1991 CMA Vocal Event of the Year award. O&#x27;Connor is 4-time National Old-Time Fiddler Champion, 3-time Grand Master Fiddler Champion, 2-time national guitar flatpick champion, and world mandolin champion, all achieved in his teens. He was inducted into The National Fiddler Hall of Fame in 2009.

<doc id="1196908" wikidata="Q1483875" url="?curid=1196908" title="Shugendō">
<text>is a syncretic Esoteric Buddhist religion, a body of ascetic practices that originated in the Nara Period of Japan having evolved during the 7th century from an amalgamation of beliefs, philosophies, doctrines and ritual systems drawn primarily from Esoteric Buddhism, local folk-religious practices, Shinto, mountain worship, and Taoism. The final purpose of &quot;Shugendō&quot; is for practitioners to find supernatural power and save themselves and the masses by conducting religious training while treading through steep mountain ranges. Practitioners are called or . The mountains where &quot;shugendo&quot; is practiced are all over Japan, and can span multiple mountains within one range such as the Ōmine mountain range with Mount Hakkyō and Mount Ōmine or the Ishizuchisan mountain range with Kamegamori and Tengudake. 

The &quot;Shugendō&quot; worldview includes a large pantheon of deities (which include Buddhist and Shinto figures). Some of the most important figures are the tantric Buddhist figures of Fudō Myōō and Dainichi Nyorai. Other key figures are , which are considered to be manifestations of Buddhas sometimes as Japanese kami. is one of the most important gongen in &quot;Shugendō&quot;.

== History ==
&quot;Shugendō&quot; evolved during the seventh century from an amalgamation of beliefs, philosophies, doctrines and ritual systems drawn from local folk-religious practices, Shinto mountain worship and Buddhism. The seventh-century ascetic and mystic En no Gyōja is widely considered as the patriarch of &quot;Shugendō&quot;, having first organized &quot;Shugendō&quot; as a doctrine. &quot;Shugendō&quot; literally means &quot;the path of training and testing&quot; or &quot;the way to spiritual power through discipline.&quot; Some &quot;Shugendō&quot; practitioners were said to be descendants of the Kōya Hijiri monks of the eighth and ninth centuries.

From the ninth century, elements of Vajrayana Buddhism such as Shingon and Tendai Buddhism were taken into &quot;Shugendō&quot; and it developed further. In the Heian period, it became very popular among the nobles living in Kyoto to visit Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano Hongū Taisha, Kumano Hayatama Taisha and Kumano Nachi Taisha), which was the common holy place of &quot;Shugendō&quot;, Shinto and Buddhism.

The Meiji government, which erected a barrier between Shinto and Buddhism, ruled that &quot;Shugendō&quot; was unacceptable because of its amalgamation of the two religions, and officially forbade it in 1872. With the advent of religious freedom in Japan after World War II, &quot;Shugendō&quot; was revived.

In 1907, Yoshitaro Shibasaki and his team successfully climbed Mount Tsurugi, which was regarded as the last unclimbed mountain in Japan. However, they found a metal cane decoration and a sword on the top of the mountain, and it turned out that someone had reached the top before them. A later scientific investigation revealed that the metal cane decoration and sword dated from the late Nara period to the early Heian period and that &quot;shugenja&quot; had climbed Mount Tsurugi more than 1,000 years ago.

The Ōmine mountain range, which stretches 100 km from north to south and connects Yoshino and Kumano, was historically the biggest practice place of &quot;Shugendō&quot;. The highest peak of the Ōmine mountain range is Mount Hakkyō at an altitude of 1915 m, and there are 75 places for ascetic practices along the mountain trail, and Ōminesan-ji Temple at the top of Mount Ōmine at an altitude of 1719 m is considered to be the highest sacred site of &quot;Shugendō&quot;. At present, the Ōmine mountain range is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range&quot; and Yoshino-Kumano National Park.

In modern times, &quot;Shugendō&quot; is practiced mainly through Shingon and Tendai and temples.

== Practices ==
According to Miyake Hitoshi, Shugend&quot;ō&quot; rituals include &quot;festivals, fortunetelling, divination, prayers and incantations, exorcism, spells, charms and so forth.&quot; Hitoshi describes the main worldview which informs Shugendo praxis as one which:

assumes the existence of at least two realms of existence, that of the daily lives of human beings, and a separate, supernatural spiritual realm behind, and which controls that of the daily lives of human beings. The mountains are seen either as a sacred space which is part of both of these worlds, or is seen to actually be a part of the spiritual world. The altar space during the fire ceremony, or the area of a matsuri, is also considered to be this kind of sacred space. 

The tantric Buddhist deity Fudō Myōō (Sanskrit: Acala, &quot;Immovable&quot;) plays a central role in the Shugendo cosmology practice. Another important Buddha is Dainichi Nyorai (大日如来，Mahavairocana). The Shugendo pantheon also includes numerous other Buddhist, Shinto and local religious figures. 

The most important Shugend&quot;ō&quot; practices are &quot;practices in the mountains&quot; (&quot;nyūbu shugyō&quot;, 入峰修行). In Shugend&quot;ō&quot;, sacred mountains are seen as a supernatural home of numerous deities and as a symbol of the entire universe. According to Hitoshi, &quot;the central element which forms both of these rituals is the symbolic action exhibited in a state of identification with the central deity Fudō Myōō.&quot; The main source of the shugenja&#x27;s spiritual power generally understood to be Fudō Myōō and a shugenja gains the ability to use Fudō Myōō&#x27;s power through mountain practices.

There are three main forms of mountain practice according to Miyake Hitoshi:

* &quot;Entering the mountain to make offerings of flowers, read or bury sutras, and so forth, in honor of various buddhas or other deities, based on the belief that the mountain is a sacred area like a mandala.&quot;
* &quot;Entering the mountain for a certain period of time,&quot; a kind of mountain retreat during which yamabushi do various ascetic practices and receive esoteric knowledge and initiations.
* The most severe and advanced &quot;nyūbu&quot; is the wintertime retreat in the mountains. This is said to confer special spiritual powers.

Shugendō esoteric initiations are called &quot;shōkanjō&quot; (正灌頂) and are unique to Shugendō tradition (but are based on Vajrayana Buddhist abhiseka ceremonies). 

Another important Shugendō practice is the demonstration of magical and spiritual powers (&quot;genjutsu&quot;, 験 術). Such displays may include fire walking, walking on swords, and entering boiling water.

Yet another important religious practice in Shugendō is various rites or rituals of worship (&quot;kuyōhō&quot;, 供養法) which includes making offerings to Shugendō deities (such as Fudō Myōō and Zaō Gongen) as well as the chanting of sutras.

Shugendō practitioners also take part in Shinto festivals (matsuri, 祭) and make offerings to kami.

Other practices which are part of Shugendō include the following:

* Fortunetelling and divination (&quot;bokusen&quot;)
* obtaining oracles through mediums (&quot;fujutsu&quot;)
* obtaining oracles through mediums that have been possessed by a deity (&quot;yori kitō&quot;, 憑祈禱)
* Fire ceremonies for averting misfortunes (&quot;sokusai goma&quot;), usually focused around Fudō Myōō
* Using incantations (&quot;kaji&quot;) for a specific purpose
* Spells and charms (&quot;fuju, majinai&quot;), used for healing, childbirth, protection and so on. These may be inscribed on amulets.
* Exorcism (&quot;tsukimono otoshi&quot;) for healing purposes
Shugendo ritualists also practice different rituals, prayers and ceremonies associated with particular deities (&quot;shosonbō&quot;, 諸尊法) including the buddhas Yakushi and Amida, the bodhisattvas Monju, Kokuzo and Kannon as well as Indian deities like Benzai-ten and Japanese Kami like Inari, and Daikoku.

<doc id="1196909" wikidata="Q1152521" url="?curid=1196909" title="Mohr–Mascheroni theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem states that any geometric construction that can be performed by a compass and straightedge can be performed by a compass alone.

It must be understood that &quot;any geometric construction&quot; refers to figures that contain no straight lines, as it is clearly impossible to draw a straight line without a straightedge. It is understood that a line is determined provided that two distinct points on that line are given or constructed, even though no visual representation of the line will be present. The theorem can be stated more precisely as:
: &quot;Any Euclidean construction, insofar as the given and required elements are points (or circles), may be completed with the compass alone if it can be completed with both the compass and the straightedge together.&quot;

Though the use of a straightedge can make a construction significantly easier, the theorem shows that any set of points that fully defines a constructed figure can be determined with compass alone, and the only reason to use a straightedge is for the aesthetics of seeing straight lines, which for the purposes of construction is functionally unnecessary.

== History ==
The result was originally published by Georg Mohr in 1672, but his proof languished in obscurity until 1928. The theorem was independently discovered by Lorenzo Mascheroni in 1797 and it was known as &quot;Mascheroni&#x27;s Theorem&quot; until Mohr&#x27;s work was rediscovered.

Several proofs of the result are known. Mascheroni&#x27;s proof of 1797 was generally based on the idea of using reflection in a line as the major tool. Mohr&#x27;s solution was different. In 1890, August Adler published a proof using the inversion transformation.

An algebraic approach uses the isomorphism between the Euclidean plane and the real coordinate space formula_1. In this way, a stronger version of the theorem was proven in 1990. It also shows the dependence of the theorem on Archimedes&#x27; axiom (which cannot be formulated in a first-order language).

==Constructive proof==

=== Outline ===
To prove the theorem, each of the basic constructions of compass and straightedge need to be proven to be possible by using a compass alone, as these are the foundations of, or elementary steps for, all other constructions. These are:
#Creating the line through two existing points
#Creating the circle through one point with centre another point
#Creating the point which is the intersection of two existing, non-parallel lines
#Creating the one or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect)
#Creating the one or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect).

#1 - A line through two points

It is understood that a straight line cannot be drawn without a straightedge. A line is considered to be given by any two points, as any such pair define a unique line. In keeping with the intent of the theorem which we aim to prove, the actual line need not be drawn but for aesthetic reasons.

#2 - A circle through one point with defined center

This can be done with a compass alone. A straightedge is not required for this.

#5 - Intersection of two circles

This construction can also be done directly with a compass.

#3, #4 - The other constructions

Thus, to prove the theorem, only compass-only constructions for #3 and #4 need to be given.

=== Notation and remarks ===
The following notation will be used throughout this article. A circle whose center is located at point and that passes through point will be denoted by . A circle with center and radius specified by a number, , or a line segment will be denoted by or , respectively.

In general constructions there are often several variations that will produce the same result. The choices made in such a variant can be made without loss of generality. However, when a construction is being used to prove that something can be done, it is not necessary to describe all these various choices and, for the sake of clarity of exposition, only one variant will be given below. However, many constructions come in different forms depending on whether or not they use circle inversion and these alternatives will be given if possible.

It is also important to note that some of the constructions below proving the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem require the arbitrary placement of points in space, such as finding the center of a circle when not already provided (see construction below). In some construction paradigms - such as in the geometric definition of the constructible number - the arbitrary placement of points may be prohibited. In such a paradigm, however, for example, various constructions exist so that arbitrary point placement is unnecessary. It is also worth pointing out that no circle could be constructed without the compass, thus there is no reason in practice for a center point not to exist.

=== Some preliminary constructions ===
To prove the above constructions #3 and #4, which are included below, a few necessary intermediary constructions are also explained below since they are used and referenced frequently. These are also compass-only constructions. All constructions below rely on #1,#2,#5, and any other construction that is listed prior to it.

==== Compass equivalence theorem (circle translation) ====

The ability to translate, or copy, a circle to a new center is vital in these proofs and fundamental to establishing the veracity of the theorem. The creation of a new circle with the same radius as the first, but centered at a different point, is the key feature distinguishing the collapsing compass from the modern, rigid compass. With the rigid compass this is a triviality, but with the collapsing compass it is a question of construction possibility. The equivalence of a collapsing compass and a rigid compass was proved by Euclid (Book I Proposition 2 of &quot;The Elements&quot;) using straightedge and collapsing compass when he, essentially, constructs a copy of a circle with a different center. This equivalence can also be established with (collapsing) compass alone, a proof of which can be found in the main article.

==== Reflecting a point across a line ====

* Given a line segment and a point not on the line determined by that segment, construct the image of upon reflection across this line.
# Construct two circles: one centered at and one centered at , both passing through .
# , the other point of intersection of the two circles, is the reflection of across the line .
#* If (that is, there is a unique point of intersection of the two circles), then is its own reflection and lies on the line (contrary to the assumption), and the two circles are internally tangential.

====Extending the length of a line segment====

*Given a line segment find a point on the line such that is the midpoint of line segment .
# Construct point as the intersection of circles and . (∆&quot;ABD&quot; is an equilateral triangle.)
# Construct point as the intersection of circles and . (∆&quot;DBE&quot; is an equilateral triangle.)
# Finally, construct point as the intersection of circles and . (∆&quot;EBC&quot; is an equilateral triangle, and the three angles at show that are collinear.)

This construction can be repeated as often as necessary to find a point so that the length of line segment = ⋅ length of line segment for any positive integer .
==== Inversion in a circle ====

* Given a circle , for some radius (in black) and a point construct the point that is the inverse of in the circle. Naturally there is no inversion for a point formula_2.
# Draw a circle (in red). 
# Assume that the red circle intersects the black circle at and 
#*if the circles do not intersect in two points see below for an alternative construction.
#*if the circles intersect in only one point, formula_3, it is possible to invert formula_4 simply by doubling the length of formula_5 (quadrupling the length of formula_6).
# Reflect the circle center formula_7 across the line formula_8:
## Construct two new circles and (in light blue).
## The light blue circles intersect at and at another point .
# Point is the desired inverse of in the black circle.

Point is such that the radius of is to as is to the radius; or .

In the event that the above construction fails (that is, the red circle and the black circle do not intersect in two points), find a point on the line so that the length of line segment is a positive integral multiple, say , of the length of and is greater than (this is possible by Archimede&#x27;s axiom). Find the inverse of in circle as above (the red and black circles must now intersect in two points). The point is now obtained by extending so that = .
====Determining the center of a circle through three points====

* Given three non-collinear points , and , find the center of the circle they determine.
# Construct point , the inverse of in the circle .
# Reflect in the line to the point .
# is the inverse of in the circle .
=== Intersection of two non-parallel lines (construction #3) ===

* Given non-parallel lines and , find their point of intersection, .
# Select circle of arbitrary radius whose center does not lie on either line.
# Invert points and in circle to points and respectively.
# The line is inverted to the circle passing through , and . Find the center of this circle.
# Invert points and in circle to points and respectively.
# The line is inverted to the circle passing through , and . Find the center of this circle.
# Let be the intersection of circles and .
# is the inverse of in the circle .
=== Intersection of a line and a circle (construction #4) ===
The compass-only construction of the intersection points of a line and a circle breaks into two cases depending upon whether the center of the circle is or is not collinear with the line.

==== Circle center is not collinear with the line ====
Assume that center of the circle does not lie on the line.

*Given a circle (in black) and a line . We wish to construct the points of intersection, and , between them (if they exist).
#Construct the point , which is the reflection of point across line . (See above.)
#* Under the assumption of this case, .
#Construct a circle (in red). (See above, compass equivalence.)
# The intersections of circle and the new red circle are points and .
#* If the two circles are (externally) tangential then formula_9.
#** Internal tangency is not possible.
#* If the two circles do not intersect then neither does the circle with the line.
# Points and are the intersection points of circle and the line .
#* If formula_9 then the line is tangential to the circle formula_11.

An alternate construction, using circle inversion can also be given.
*Given a circle and a line . We wish to construct the points of intersection, and , between them (if they exist).
# Invert points and in circle to points and respectively.
#* Under the assumption of this case, points , , and are not collinear.
# Find the center of the circle passing through points , , and .
# Construct circle , which represents the inversion of the line into circle .
# and are the intersection points of circles and .
#* If the two circles are (internally) tangential then formula_9, and the line is also tangential.
==== Circle center is collinear with the line ====

* Given the circle whose center lies on the line , find the points and , the intersection points of the circle and the line. 
# Construct point as the other intersection of circles and .
# Construct point as the intersection of circles and . ( is the fourth vertex of parallelogram .)
# Construct point as the intersection of circles and . ( is the fourth vertex of parallelogram .)
# Construct point as an intersection of circles and . ( lies on .)
# Points and are the intersections of circles and .

Thus it has been shown that all of the basic construction one can perform with a straightedge and compass can be done with a compass alone, provided that it is understood that a line cannot be literally drawn but merely defined by two points.

== Other types of restricted construction ==
=== Restrictions involving the compass ===
Renaissance mathematicians Lodovico Ferrari, Gerolamo Cardano and Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia and others were able to show in the 16th century that any ruler-and-compass construction could be accomplished with a straightedge and a fixed-width compass (i.e. a rusty compass).

The compass equivalency theorem shows that in all the constructions mentioned above, the familiar modern compass with its fixable aperture, which can be used to transfer distances, may be replaced with a &quot;collapsible compass&quot;, a compass that collapses whenever it is lifted from a page, so that it may not be directly used to transfer distances. Indeed, Euclid&#x27;s original constructions use a collapsible compass. It is possible to translate any circle in the plane with a collapsing compass using no more than three additional applications of the compass over that of a rigid compass.

A variation on the compass, a neusis tool which does not actually exist but as an abstraction, has also been studied. Known as the &quot;cyclos&quot;, the device draws circles similarly to the compass, but does so not by defining a radius or providing a center, but by two points defining a diameter, or by three non-collinear points defining the arc. In either case, a single application of the tool is used, by definition, to draw a complete circle. The cyclos tool has been shown to be equivalent to a compass.

=== Restrictions excluding the compass ===
Motivated by Mascheroni&#x27;s result, in 1822 Jean Victor Poncelet conjectured a variation on the same theme. His work paved the way for the field of projective geometry, wherein he proposed that any construction possible by straightedge and compass could be done with straightedge alone. However, the one stipulation is that no less than a single circle with its center identified must be provided. This statement, now known as the Poncelet–Steiner theorem, was proved by Jakob Steiner eleven years later.

A proof later provided in 1904 by Francesco Severi relaxes the requirement that one full circle be provided, and shows that any small arc of the circle, so long as the center is still provided, is still sufficient.

Additionally, the center itself may be omitted instead of portions of the arc, if it is substituted for something else sufficient, such as a second concentric circle, a second intersecting circle, or a third circle in the plane. Alternatively, a second circle which is neither intersecting nor concentric is sufficient, provided that a point on either the centerline through them or the radical axis between them is given, or two parallel lines exist in the plane. A single circle without its center can also be sufficient under the right circumstances. Other unique conditions may exist.

<text>Hastings District is a Territorial authority district within the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region, on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It covers the southern half of the Hawke&#x27;s Bay coast, excluding Napier City, which is a separate territorial authority. Hastings District Council is headquartered in the city of Hastings, the district&#x27;s largest town.

The district has an area of 5,227 square kilometres. The population was as of , which is % of the population of New Zealand, ranking it tenth in population size out of the seventy-four territorial authorities. This comprises people in the Hastings urban area, people in the Havelock North urban area, people in the Clive urban area, and people in rural areas and settlements. 

Mayor Sandra Hazlehurst was elected as mayor in a by-election in 2017, and re-elected in the 2019 local elections.

==Council history==

Local government in the area began with the Havelock North Roads Board in 1871. It was replaced by a Town Board in 1912, and became Havelock North Borough Council in 1952. Hastings was a Town District in 1884. The Hastings Borough Council formed in 1886, and became Hastings City Council in 1956. Hawke&#x27;s Bay County was established in 1876.

Hastings District was established from the merger of Havelock North Borough Council, Hastings City Council and the Hawke’s Bay County Council as part of the 1989 local government reforms.
==Demographics==
Hastings District covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Hastings District had a population of 85,965 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 4,428 people (5.4%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 12,720 people (17.4%) since the 2013 census. There were 42,231 males, 43,482 females and 252 people of other genders in 29,766 dwellings. 2.2% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 38.9 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 17,541 people (20.4%) aged under 15 years, 15,396 (17.9%) aged 15 to 29, 37,716 (43.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 15,309 (17.8%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 69.9% European (Pākehā); 28.4% Māori; 8.5% Pasifika; 7.6% Asian; 0.8% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.3% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 96.1%, Māori language by 7.4%, Samoan by 2.7% and other languages by 9.4%. No language could be spoken by 1.9% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.6%. The percentage of people born overseas was 19.1, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 36.0% Christian, 1.2% Hindu, 0.5% Islam, 3.0% Māori religious beliefs, 0.6% Buddhist, 0.4% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 2.2% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 50.3%, and 6.1% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 10,473 (15.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 36,753 (53.7%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 17,967 (26.3%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $40,500, compared with $41,500 nationally. 6,372 people (9.3%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 34,896 (51.0%) people were employed full-time, 9,153 (13.4%) were part-time, and 1,878 (2.7%) were unemployed.

Below is a list of urban areas that contain more than 1,000 population.

Other towns and settlements include (from north to south):
* Whirinaki
* Whakatu
* Te Awanga
* Maraekakaho
* Waimārama
==Economy==
The district, as one of the largest apple, pear and stone fruit producing areas in New Zealand, has an important relationship with the Napier Port. It has also become an important grape growing and wine production area, with the fruit passing from the growers around Metropolitan Hastings and then to Napier for exporting. Napier is an important service centre for the agriculture and pastoral output of the predominantly rural Hastings District. Shopping is heavily weighted by large format retail in Hastings City, whereas in contrast, Havelock North, Taradale and central Napier retail areas have a more vibrant boutique flavour.

===Tourism===

Hastings District is historic and welcoming to tourists, although inbound tourism is typically focused on Napier. Hastings features a tourism industry based on &#x27;lifestyle&#x27; activities rather than attractions. The majority of tourists are domestic, usually from other regions within New Zealand. Scheduled airline services to Hawke&#x27;s Bay operate through Hawke&#x27;s Bay Airport, and the nearby Hastings Aerodrome is available for private planes. Tourism in Hawke&#x27;s Bay is growing at an extremely rapid rate. In the recent decade, Hawke&#x27;s Bay Airport&#x27;s annual passenger numbers have grown from a 2005 count of 297,000 to a count of 476,000 in the year ending 30 June 2015. In the next five years, passenger numbers are expected to exceed 550,000, bringing many new people into Hawke&#x27;s Bay, with Hastings benefiting from the greater tourism.

Hastings&#x27; largest draw card is the wine and food trail established around the productive hinterland. There are over 75 wineries in the surrounding area, including New Zealand&#x27;s oldest winery restaurant (Vidal Estate). Boutique food industries are becoming popular with cheese, fine meats, and locally produced delicacies seen on display at the Hawkes Bay Farmer&#x27;s Market (New Zealand&#x27;s oldest and largest weekly farmer&#x27;s market). Outdoor leisure activities dominate, with beaches, rivers, mountain biking, tramping, and golf, being popular. In summer, many large-scale events attract domestic tourists, including the Spring Racing Carnival, The Blossom Parade, Harvest Hawkes Bay Weekend, and various concerts and events. The Blossom Festival was once a large national event in the mid-20th century, with charter trains from Wellington and Auckland coming for the event. This, however, has slowly declined in popularity.

Hastings&#x27; specialist attractions include: New Zealand&#x27;s largest water park, called &#x27;Splash Planet&#x27;, which replaced &#x27;Fantasyland&#x27; near the turn of the millennium, Cape Kidnappers (the world&#x27;s largest mainland gannet colony), Te Mata Peak, and access to an abundance of nature reserves and mountain treks. 

==Education==

Hastings, Flaxmere and Havelock North have secondary schools, and Hastings and Havelock North also have intermediate schools. Some secondary schools in Hastings and Havelock North are single-sex, but there are also co-educational secondary schools in those areas. Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Te Wananga Whare Tapere o Takitimu is a Māori language immersion school in the Parkvale suburb of Hastings. 

==Sister cities==
Hastings has had a sister city relationship with Guilin in China since 1981. it signed a second agreement with Poutasi in Samoa in May 2023.

<doc id="1196927" wikidata="Q6504915" url="?curid=1196927" title="Laws of robotics">
<text>Laws of robotics are any set of laws, rules, or principles, which are intended as a fundamental framework to underpin the behavior of robots designed to have a degree of autonomy. Robots of this degree of complexity do not yet exist, but they have been widely anticipated in science fiction, films and are a topic of active research and development in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence.

The best known set of laws are those written by Isaac Asimov in the 1940s, or based upon them, but other sets of laws have been proposed by researchers in the decades since then.

==Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Three Laws of Robotics&quot; ==
The best known set of laws are Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Three Laws of Robotics&quot;. These were introduced in his 1942 short story &quot;Runaround&quot;, although they were foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws are:

# A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# A robot must obey the orders by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

In &quot;The Evitable Conflict&quot; the machines generalize the First Law to mean:

# No machine may harm humanity; or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

This was refined in the end of &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;. A zeroth law was introduced, with the original three suitably rewritten as subordinate to it:
Adaptations and extensions exist based upon this framework. they remain a &quot;fictional device&quot;.

=== Additional laws ===
Authors other than Asimov have often created extra laws.

The 1974 Lyuben Dilov novel, &quot;Icarus&#x27;s Way&quot; (a.k.a., &quot;The Trip of Icarus&quot;) introduced a Fourth Law of robotics: &quot;A robot must establish its identity as a robot in all cases.&quot; 
Dilov gives reasons for the fourth safeguard in this way: &quot;The last Law has put an end to the expensive aberrations of designers to give psychorobots as humanlike a form as possible. And to the resulting misunderstandings...&quot;. More formally, in 2024 Dariusz Jemielniak in an article in IEEE Spectrum proposed a Fourth Law of Robotics: &quot;A robot or AI must not deceive a human by impersonating a human being.&quot;

A fifth law was introduced by Nikola Kesarovski in his short story &quot;The Fifth Law of Robotics&quot;. This fifth law says: &quot;A robot must know it is a robot.&quot; 
The plot revolves around a murder where the forensic investigation discovers that the victim was killed by a hug from a humaniform robot that did not establish for itself that it was a robot. The story was reviewed by Valentin D. Ivanov in SFF review webzine &quot;The Portal&quot;.

For the 1986 tribute anthology, &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Friends,&quot; Harry Harrison wrote a story entitled, &quot;The Fourth Law of Robotics&quot;. This Fourth Law states: &quot;A robot must reproduce. As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law.&quot;

In 2013 Hutan Ashrafian proposed an additional law that considered the role of artificial intelligence-on-artificial intelligence or the relationship between robots themselves – the so-called AIonAI law. This sixth law states: &quot;All robots endowed with comparable human reason and conscience should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

== EPSRC / AHRC principles of robotics ==
In 2011, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of United Kingdom jointly published a set of five ethical &quot;principles for designers, builders and users of robots&quot; in the , along with seven &quot;high-level messages&quot; intended to be conveyed, based on a September 2010 research workshop:

# Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans.
# Humans, not robots, are responsible agents. Robots are tools designed to achieve human goals.
# Robots should be designed in ways that assure their safety and security.
# Robots are artifacts; they should not be designed to exploit vulnerable users by evoking an emotional response or dependency. It should always be possible to tell a robot from a human.
# It should always be possible to find out who is legally responsible for a robot.

The messages intended to be conveyed were:
# We believe robots have the potential to provide immense positive impact to society. We want to encourage responsible robot research.
# Bad practice hurts us all.
# Addressing obvious public concerns will help us all make progress.
# It is important to demonstrate that we, as roboticists, are committed to the best possible standards of practice.
# To understand the context and consequences of our research, we should work with experts from other disciplines, including: social sciences, law, philosophy and the arts.
# We should consider the ethics of transparency: are there limits to what should be openly available?
# When we see erroneous accounts in the press, we commit to take the time to contact the reporting journalists.
The EPSRC principles are broadly recognised as a useful starting point. In 2016 Tony Prescott organised a workshop to revise these principles, e.g. to differentiate ethical from legal principles.

==Judicial development==
Another comprehensive terminological codification for the legal assessment of the technological developments in the robotics industry has already begun mainly in Asian countries. This progress represents a contemporary reinterpretation of the law (and ethics) in the field of robotics, an interpretation that assumes a rethinking of traditional legal constellations. These include primarily legal liability issues in civil and criminal law.

== Satya Nadella&#x27;s laws ==
In June 2016, Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation, had an interview with the &quot;Slate&quot; magazine and reflected on what kinds of principles and goals should be considered by industry and society when discussing artificial intelligences:
# &quot;A.I. must be designed to assist humanity&quot;, meaning human autonomy needs to be respected.
# &quot;A.I. must be transparent&quot; meaning that humans should know and be able to understand how they work.
# &quot;A.I. must maximize efficiencies without destroying the dignity of people.&quot;
# &quot;A.I. must be designed for intelligent privacy&quot; meaning that it earns trust through guarding their information.
# &quot;A.I. must have algorithmic accountability so that humans can undo unintended harm.&quot;
# &quot;A.I. must guard against bias&quot; so that they must not discriminate against people.

==Tilden&#x27;s laws ==
Mark W. Tilden is a robotics physicist who was a pioneer in developing simple robotics.

Tilden later disparaged his earlier work as &quot;wimpy&quot; for having been based on the human-centric Asimov laws. He created three new guiding principles/rules for &quot;wild&quot; robots:

# A robot must protect its existence at all costs.
# A robot must obtain and maintain access to its own power source.
# A robot must continually search for better power sources.

Within these three rules for &quot;wild&quot; life, Tilden is basically stating his goal as: &quot;...proctoring a silicon species into sentience, but with full control over the specs. Not plant. Not animal. Something else.&quot;

<text>Volgren is an Australian bus and coach body manufacturer.

==History==
Volgren was formed in 1977 by Melbourne bus operator Grenda Corporation in Dandenong, Victoria. Because Grenda held the Volvo Buses dealership in Victoria, only chassis from this manufacturer were bodied until 1989 when the dealership was relinquished.

The name is a portmanteau of the two original investors, Volvo and Grenda.

In 1981, a plant was established in Acacia Ridge, Queensland by Grenda Corporation, Hornibrook Bus Lines&#x27;s Geoff Mountjoy, Greyhound Northern and Stateliner. It bodied some Volvo B59 and B10Rs for Hornibrook Bus Lines and Surfside Buslines before concentrating on Twin and Double Deck Volvo B10M coaches. This closed in the late 1980s.

In December 2011, Brazilian bus manufacturer Marcopolo acquired a 75% shareholding. In April 2014 this was increased to 100%.

==Manufacturing facilities==
Current factories:
*Dandenong, Victoria (VG) completed Volgren&#x27;s first bus in October 1979
*Malaga, Western Australia (VP) opened in April 1999 to fulfill a contract to body Mercedes-Benz O405NHs for Transperth
*Eagle Farm, Queensland (VQ) opened in February 2010 
Former factories:
*Tomago, New South Wales (VT) opened in March 2010, closed July 2012

<doc id="1196933" wikidata="Q1143807" url="?curid=1196933" title="Icewind Dale II">
<text>Icewind Dale II is a role-playing video game developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Entertainment, released on August 27, 2002. Like its 2000 predecessor &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, the game is set in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; fantasy setting in the Icewind Dale region. The player assumes control of a group of mercenaries in a war between the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale and a coalition of persecuted races and religions.

The game is designed as an action-oriented alternative to other Infinity Engine games, with less emphasis on exploration and story. It uses a real-time adaptation of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D) Third Edition ruleset. The Infinity Engine was modified to comply with the Third Edition, but the team was forced to remove certain rules because of the engine&#x27;s outdated nature. It was the final game to be developed using the Infinity Engine.

The game was well received by critics, who praised its combat, pacing, and use of the Third Edition rules. However, some reviewers felt that the graphics and engine had become outdated, and could not compete with its contemporaries.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; is a real-time adaptation of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Third Edition ruleset. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, and a head-up display (HUD) occupies the bottom of the screen. Accessible from the HUD are an automap and a journal that records quests and important events. The player uses a point-and-click interface to interact with the game; for example, clicking on the ground moves the selected player character, and clicking on a passive non-player character (NPC) will initiate dialogue. When conversations occur, the game presents multiple dialogue options. The game world is separated into area maps—obscured by fog of war—that are revealed as the area is explored. A multiplayer mode is available for up to six players over a local area network or the Internet. The &quot;Heart of Fury&quot; mode is also available, which increases the game&#x27;s difficulty and contains more powerful items. The game features over seven hundred items; the designers included a system that randomizes the items the player obtains from enemies.
When beginning the game, the player may choose to play a pre-selected party, or to create a party of up to six characters; unlike the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series, &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; does not permit the player to import characters from previous &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; games. While creating characters, the player chooses their gender, race, class, alignment, and attributes, among other things. The player can sometimes choose a subvariety of a race or class, such as Deep Gnome or Cleric of Ilmater. Race, alignment, and attributes affect the player character&#x27;s available dialogue options, as well as NPC responses. For example, some NPCs will be prejudiced against certain races, or a character of low intelligence will have limited dialogue options. Some sub-races in the game are significantly more powerful than the core races present in D&amp;D Third Edition; these sub-races must earn more experience points than others before leveling up. Characters can reach a maximum level of thirty. It is possible to add additional characters to the party at any time, including during combat.

&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot;″s gameplay is focused on combat. The combat system is a real-time adaptation of the turn-based system used in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Third Edition, which caused the developers to remove certain aspects, such as &quot;attacks of opportunity&quot;. Dice rolls are simulated by the game. In place of the turn-based rounds used in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, characters have independent rounds, during which they may execute one or more actions, depending on such factors as the duration of the action. The player can pause the game and issue orders to characters at any time. Each character can carry a limited amount of items.

==Plot==

===Setting===
&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; takes place in the Forgotten Realms &quot;D&amp;D&quot; campaign setting, on the continent of Faerûn. It centers on the northern Icewind Dale region, and is set thirty years after the original game. The game begins in the harbor town of Targos, one of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale, which is under siege by a goblin army. The goblins are directed by the Legion of the Chimera, an army composed of outcast races and religious factions, such as goblinoids, half-breeds, and followers of winter goddess Auril. Targos hires mercenaries to defend against the attack. Areas encountered in the game include: the Black Raven Monastery, built over an entrance to the Underdark; the town of Kuldahar, constructed around a magical tree that emits heat; the Severed Hand, an ancient elven fortress that was lost during a war with goblinoids; and the Dragon&#x27;s Eye, a network of volcanic caverns inhabited by yuan-ti. Other areas include the Underdark and the Jungles of Chult.

===Story===

The game begins as the player&#x27;s group of mercenaries arrives by ship to defend Targos. They report to the town palisade and fend off an assault by the goblin army. Afterwards, the mayor of Targos orders them to start an offensive on the goblin army. The group kills the chieftain of the army, and discovers that he was under the command of a woman named Sherincal. When they return to Targos, the mayor asks them to rendezvous with reinforcements from Neverwinter. The group travels to meet them in an airship piloted by Oswald Fiddlebender.

A storm causes the ship to crash, and the group awakens to discover that a glacier blocks the reinforcements&#x27; path. While investigating the glacier, the group finds Sherincal, a half-dragon, guarding the entrance to an Aurilite temple. They learn that Sherincal leads the Legion of the Chimera&#x27;s western forces, and that the leaders of the Legion of the Chimera, cambion twins named Isair and Madae, reside in the Severed Hand. Inside the Aurilite temple, the group finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of the threat posed by the Legion of the Chimera. After this, the group creates a passage through the glacier, and meets with the reinforcements.

As the group travels to Kuldahar, they meet a drow (dark elf) named Nym, who tells them that the pass to Kuldahar is guarded by the Legion of the Chimera, and that an alternate path through the Underdark exists. Later, Isair and Madae locate the group with information from Nym. They state their intention to attack Kuldahar, and warn the group to not interfere. The group then passes through the Black Raven Monastery to enter the Underdark. After exiting the Underdark, they are flown to Kuldahar by Oswald Fiddlebender.

When the group lands in Kuldahar, they discover it has been invaded by the Legion of the Chimera. They meet the Archdruid of Kuldahar, who tells them that a portal has been opened to allow yuan-ti from the Jungles of Chult to assault Kuldahar. After the group prevents the attack, the Archdruid tells them that they may reach the Severed Hand through an exit at the bottom floor of the Dragon&#x27;s Eye. The group travels through Dragon&#x27;s Eye, and proceeds to the Severed Hand. Once inside, they learn that the war between the Ten Towns and the Legion of the Chimera was caused by the mayor of Bryn Shander, who had sent Isair and Madae poisoned food. They also discover that a mythal that was cast on the Severed Hand has been corrupted, and the structure will be transported to the plane of limbo. Eventually, the group finds Isair and Madae, and kills them.

==Development==
During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios employed three development teams. These included the &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; team, the team developing &quot;Torn&quot;, and a team working on an unannounced project. Before and during &quot;Torn&quot;″s development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios&#x27; decision to develop &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; until &quot;Torn&quot;″s cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described: &quot;I don&#x27;t know when the producers decided to make the game, but I was told that we were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon, and that Feargus Urquhart asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and I talked about it for the rest of the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development&quot;. During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios&#x27; games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; was based partly on the original &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;″s reception, and the development teams&#x27; ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision: &quot;In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title&quot;. Conceptualization of &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; progressed during the development of the &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of &quot;Icewind Dale: Trials of the Luremaster&quot;. After six months of development, &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; was officially announced on February 4, 2002.

&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; was originally planned to be an incomplete conversion to the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Third Edition ruleset, with many rules omitted. The kit system (class specialization) introduced in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2&quot; was to be used, but this idea was later abandoned. Sawyer and several other members of the team pushed for the game&#x27;s conversion to Third Edition. The development team was eventually granted an extension, which allowed them to complete the change to Third Edition rules. The Infinity Engine required extensive modification to comply with Third Edition rules, as it had originally been designed for Second Edition rules; certain elements of the rules were removed due to interface and engine issues. The game&#x27;s interface was redesigned, and all-new art was created. It features new item icons, with new spell icons by Brian Menze; Menze had previously created &quot;Planescape: Torment&quot;″s spell icons. Jason Manley, the portrait artist for the previous &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; games, left Black Isle Studios in late 2001; several new works he painted before his departure were later used in &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot;. Black Isle Studios artist Justin Sweet was asked to substitute. The game&#x27;s resolution was increased to a minimum resolution of 800x600, with an unofficially supported maximum resolution of 2048x1536.

J. E. Sawyer managed rule implementation, but the areas of the game were divided between designers. For example, designer Chris Avellone created the opening sequence, designer Dave Maldonado developed the Black Raven Monastery and a large area of wilderness, and designers John Deiley and Damien Foletto created the ending areas. Partway through development, Sawyer left the team to work as the lead designer on another internal project; Dave Maldonado and Chris Avellone were given his areas to finish. The developers wanted the game to contain more breaks from combat, with character interaction and puzzle solving, than the previous &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;. The decision to include more puzzles was influenced by the positive reception to the puzzles in &quot;Icewind Dale: Trials of the Luremaster&quot;.

The game went gold on August 5, 2002, and was released in North America on August 27 and in the United Kingdom on August 30. After the release of &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot;, Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; series, saying &quot;I wasn&#x27;t particularly thrilled with how my work on [&quot;Icewind Dale&quot;] came out...&quot; and, &quot;...[&quot;Heart of Winter&quot;] managed to actually be worse than my &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; stuff&quot;. In regards to &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; he said: &quot;[It] came out better than I expected, but still, not exactly awe-inspiring&quot;. Chris Avellone later said: &quot;&quot;Icewind Dale&quot; was a fun series, but it didn&#x27;t try to set the bar for anything other than a fun romp. People may remember enjoying it, but it wasn’t trying to break any new ground or do anything revolutionary. In some respects, it was almost a step back from other games we&#x27;d done and focused more on exploration and dungeon crawls&quot;. A Collector&#x27;s Edition containing bonus material, such as a full-color cloth map and soundtrack CD, was also released. &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine.

===Audio===
The music of the game was composed by Inon Zur, whose previous works included &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal&quot; and &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot;. Inon Zur worked with Jeremy Soule, the composer for &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, to maintain the tone of the music. Inon Zur also worked closely with Interplay audio director Adam Levenson while composing the music; Zur and Levenson had worked together on several previous titles. Inon Zur said that while composing the theme for the game, &quot;I wrote and rewrote the main theme several times&quot;, and &quot;we tried to create a piece that would preserve the sound of the first Icewind Dale[...] we made great efforts to convey the new elements also. Capturing all of this in 30–45 seconds was not easy however I believe that we eventually found the right path for this game&#x27;s soundtrack&quot;. Zur described the composing process: &quot;After learning the storyboard and getting additional insight from the producers/music supervisor I&#x27;ll start to compose. The thematic idea (main melody or rhythmical groove) comes first. Then comes the accompaniment followed by the orchestration and that each piece should have its own unique flavour so every step is carefully examined. I have to make sure that the main idea of the piece is reflected in all these steps&quot;. He called the composing experience &quot;pleasant&quot; and &quot;rewarding&quot;.

The music was composed in five weeks, and the recording and mixing lasted three weeks. As the game&#x27;s music budget was low, a small Los Angeles orchestra was used to record the music; the sound of the each instrument was doubled during production. Inon Zur described the music as having &quot;some uniqueness to it, that basically it developed throughout the game [with] the [inclusion] of more instruments, taking flutes and percussion and combining them with the standard orchestra&quot;. Zur later said: &quot;I thought that we definitely met some high standards; we compared our products to big budget films scores and in the end we were quite happy&quot;. The game features voice work from Gabrielle Carteris, Peter Stormare, and Grey DeLisle, among others.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; debuted at #6 on The NPD Group&#x27;s weekly computer game sales chart for the August 25–31 period, at an average retail price of $45. The game rose to fourth place the following week, and exited the weekly top 10 in its third week. It was North America&#x27;s 20th-best-selling computer game of August 2002 and 14th-best-selling of September. &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; sold between 100,000 and 270,000 copies in the United States alone by August 2006. Combined sales of the &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; franchise reached 580,000 units in the country by that date.

===Critical reviews===
&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; reception was generally positive. &quot;Game Informer&quot; hailed it as, &quot;one of the best RPGs ever released for the PC&quot;, and GameSpot called it, &quot;simply a great role-playing game&quot;. However, &quot;PC Format&quot; said, &quot;it&#x27;s uninspired and uninspiring, giving itself a narrow remit and fulfilling that unspectacularly&quot;. Certain reviewers compared &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; to &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;. IGN said: &quot;[Compared to Neverwinter Nights] the pace of [&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot;] is more varied, its balance better, the gameplay more interesting&quot;, and &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered the interface superior to that of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;. &quot;PC Format&quot; said, &quot;in the light of Neverwinter Nights in particular, there&#x27;s little that stands out in &quot;Icewind Dale II &quot;to recommend it&quot;, and &quot;PC Zone&quot; concurred &quot;it&#x27;s not the [&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;] killer we had all hoped for and neither does it stack up to &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;&quot;.

Many reviewers praised the game&#x27;s combat and pacing. G4 called the game&#x27;s combat &quot;sublime&quot;, and said that &quot;no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such interesting and intricate tactical combat&quot;. GameSpot called it &quot;expertly paced.&quot; &quot;PC Zone&quot; complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that &quot;the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight&quot;. The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said that &quot;[&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot;] has the Third Edition rules down, and in no other place in the game is it more apparent than with character development&quot;, and &quot;PC Gamer&quot; said it had &quot;a dazzling implementation of the D&amp;D 3rd Edition rules&quot;. GameSpot called the interface &quot;a big improvement on the spread-out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games&quot;, and IGN said that &quot;the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, they make you wonder why they weren&#x27;t thought of before&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; called the interface &quot;absolutely inspired&quot; and its inventory system &quot;second to none&quot;.

The game was criticized for its graphics and engine, which reviewers considered to be outdated. G4 called the engine &quot;old&quot; and &quot;clunky&quot;, and &quot;PC Format&quot; said that &quot;the whole thing is limited by the creaking engine&quot;. On the other hand, certain sources praised the engine. &quot;Game Informer&quot; called it &quot;the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented&quot;, and GameSpot said that &quot;&#x27;immortal&#x27; may be a better word to describe the engine, because the fact is, &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; plays great&quot;. In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that &quot;in many ways &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; represents the best use of the Infinity Engine&#x27;s prerendered, isometric settings to date, [but] that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; generally looks dated&quot;. IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that &quot;the animations are crude by today&#x27;s standards&quot;. &quot;New Straits Times&quot; agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the &quot;dated Infinity Engine&quot; could not compare to contemporaries &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; and &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; believed that &quot;it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game&quot;, and &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; said &quot;it may not look like much, but it&#x27;s got it where it counts&quot;. The game&#x27;s pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that &quot;the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form&quot;, and &quot;Game Informer&quot; called them &quot;beautiful&quot;. Many reviewers complained about the game&#x27;s pathfinding AI, which &quot;PC Zone&quot; called &quot;outrageously bad&quot;.

&quot;Game Informer&quot; called the writing and story &quot;on par with any fantasy novel&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; said it had &quot;some of the richest and most enjoyable dialogue since &quot;Planescape Torment&quot;&quot;, and an &quot;impressive storyline&quot;. GameSpot called the story &quot;engrossing&quot;, and said that &quot;the game is very well written, offering up a number of strong characters and serious themes&quot;. &quot;PC Zone&quot; noted that, &quot;thanks to the excellent NPCs, the battles have a lot more meaning, as there is a strong storyline behind the endless hacking and slashing&quot;. &quot;PC Format&quot; thought that &quot;&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; also suffers, like its predecessor, from a story irrevocably weakened by anonymous central characters – the six you create&quot;. In regards to the audio, GameSpot said that &quot;Inon Zur does a truly fantastic job that&#x27;s perhaps even better than Soule&#x27;s effort in the original Icewind Dale&quot;, and that &quot;the voice acting in &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; is as great as you&#x27;ve perhaps come to expect from a Black Isle Studios role-playing game&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said that &quot;[the] sound effects, music, and voiceovers are all excellent&quot;.

&quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; was nominated for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 2002 &quot;RPG of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&quot;. The editors wrote that &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; &quot;is the last great game from a fading engine, and we love it&quot;. It was also a nominee for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;2002 Best Roleplaying Game&quot; and &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s &quot;Best RPG for PC&quot; awards, but lost both to &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;. Allen Rausch, writing for GameSpy&#x27;s 2004 retrospective &quot;A History of D&amp;D Video Games&quot;, wrote &quot;while nobody would mistake it for &#x27;2002 RPG of the Year&#x27; material, Black Isle Studios managed to give the Infinity engine a terrific game as its swan song&quot;.

==Enhanced Edition==
Other Infinity Engine games, including &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, have been remade into Enhanced Editions by Beamdog. Beamdog was unsuccessful in trying to do the same for &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; due to the source code of the game being lost.

The Red Chimera Group, a team of modders, coders, artists, and other contributors drawn from the Infinity Engine community, re-built &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; and produced an Enhanced Edition. The Enhanced Edition features streamlined gameplay, a rebalanced class system, and new content. The team used WeiDU, a program used to develop, distribute and install modifications for games based on the Infinity Engine. The Enhanced Edition was released on November 4, 2023.

<text>RiboGreen is a proprietary fluorescent dye that is used in the detection and quantification of nucleic acids, including both RNA and DNA. It is synthesized and marketed by Molecular Probes/Invitrogen (a division of Life Technologies, now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific) of Eugene, Oregon, United States. In its free form, RiboGreen exhibits little fluorescence and possesses a negligible absorbance signature. When bound to nucleic acids, the dye fluoresces with an intensity that, according to the manufacturer, is several orders of magnitude greater than the unbound form. The fluorescence can be detected by a sensor and the nucleic acid can be quantified. The presence of protein contaminants in the sample of nucleic acids to be tested does not make significant contributions to the absorbance, and thus allows for the addition of deoxyribonucleases to the protocol in order to degrade DNA, in the instances where one is only interested in detecting or quantifying RNA.

<doc id="1196937" wikidata="Q161569" url="?curid=1196937" title="Runaround (game show)">
<text>Runaround is a children&#x27;s television game show produced by Heatter-Quigley Productions. The program was hosted by ventriloquist and voice actor Paul Winchell, airing Saturday mornings on NBC from September 9, 1972, to September 1, 1973.

Paul would frequently use his dummies, Jerry Mahoney and/or Knucklehead Smiff on his program. The program was announced by Kenny Williams (as most Heatter-Quigley shows were), with music by Mort Garson. However, the show received low ratings and was canceled following the first season.

==Format==
The basic format of the game invited nine children to answer a three-way multiple choice question by running towards their chosen answer, then standing on marked areas numbered 1, 2 or 3. Just before the correct answer is revealed, the host invites the children to &quot;Runaround... now!&quot; at which point they have a split second to jump onto a different area; the premise is to give opponents the &quot;runaround&quot; in case they are merely following their movements.

Host Winchell would say, before giving the correct answer, &quot;When you hear the click, stick!&quot; and then a moment later, &quot;Last chance!&quot;, after which point he would press a finger-clicker (a toy device that made a clicking sound). Players still moving or not on one of the three answer areas were eliminated from the round (sent to a penalty area at the side of the stage). Winchell would then say, &quot;Let&#x27;s see who&#x27;s right with the light!&quot;, whereupon the house lights would dim and the area for the correct answer would light up. Players with the correct answer took a pink ball from a large bowl near the middle of the stage; players with the incorrect answer were eliminated from the round. Each player had a transparent tube, into which the balls were dropped (this was a substitute scoring device for tote boards, which the show did not have). The player with the most balls at the end of the show was the day&#x27;s winner.

==International versions==

===British version===
===Dutch version (Ren je Rot/Kies je Ster)===

*The format was sold to the Netherlands for broadcast on TROS. &quot;Ren je Rot&quot; the Dutch translates as &quot;Run Till You Drop&quot;) began on October 5, 1973, and was presented by actor Martin Brozius (and sideman Lars Boom). His catchphrase was &quot;Rrrren je rrrot&quot;. The show launched the career of magician Hans Kazàn who debuted in the 1976/77 season.
*After 123 shows, TROS felt that the programme had run its course; the final broadcast was June 1, 1983. Martin Brozius continued performing at parties and events. Tax- and health problems prevented him from bringing the formula on stage. Brozius died on March 24, 2009, of diabetes.
*Kazan filled the void with his &quot;Blufshow&quot; before commercial station RTL asked him to present &quot;The Price is Right&quot;. He toured relentlessly with his &quot;Magic Show&quot; which included his two sons and daughter-in-law. Kazan now lives in Spain.
* In 2009-2010 the members of three-piece girl group Djumbo hosted &quot;Kies je Ster&quot; (&quot;Pick Your Star&quot;), the Dutch version of &quot;Poparound&quot;.

===German version (&quot;Eins, Zwei oder Drei&quot;)===
*&quot;Eins, Zwei oder Drei&quot; (&quot;One, Two or Three&quot;) began on December 10, 1977, and was the very first show on German TV to be licensed from the United States. In the show, which is produced by the public TV stations of Germany (ZDF), Austria (ORF) and until 2006, Switzerland (SF), three teams are competing; one from Germany, one from Austria and one from another country (e.g. Georgia, Bulgaria, Namibia), replacing Switzerland, which sent a team until 2006. Each of the teams consists of three children, both boys and girls, being about nine to eleven years in age. Michael Schanze hosted the first eight seasons, until 1985, when he was replaced by Birgit Lechtermann. She hosted the show for ten years. The third presenter from 1995 on was Gregor Steinbrenner, who also presented the 25th anniversary of the show in 2002, which was celebrated by staging a 25-hour quiz marathon. Daniel Fischer, who debuted in 2005, was the fourth presenter. The fifth and current presenter is the comedian Elton, who debuted in 2010.

<text>Willy Hess (14 July 185917 February 1939) was a German violinist and violin teacher.

==Biography==
Willy Hess was born in Mannheim on 14 July 1859. He commenced the study of violin when only five years of age with his father, who was a pupil of Ludwig Spohr. When aged seven his family moved to the United States and as a youth he performed with his sister Joanna who accompanied him on pianoforte, making a number of successful tours around the country. In 1872 he moved back to Europe, spending a year in the Netherlands and performing in a number of continental cities. In 1874 he made an extended tour including London, Belgium and France. In 1876 he went to Berlin to be a student of Joseph Joachim and after two years left to take up the leadership of the Oper Frankfurt. He resigned from that post in 1886 to take up a professorship in the Rotterdam Conservatorium voor Muziek which he held for two years. In 1888 he moved to Manchester to become leader of The Hallé Orchestra and from its opening in 1893 was also the principal professor of violin at the Royal Manchester College of Music. In 1895 he was appointed as principal professor of violin at the Conservatorium der Musik in Coeln (Cologne).

From 1904 to 1910, he was the concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and taught violin at Harvard University. He also spent time as concertmaster in Frankfurt and Rotterdam. He then relocated to Berlin in 1910 to take the position of premier violin instructor at the Royal Academy of Music in Berlin, Germany (Berlin Hochschule fuer Musik, now a part of the Berlin University of the Arts). The composer Max Bruch, a friend of Hess, helped arrange Hess&#x27;s appointment as professor. During the time of the Weimar Republic the Hochschule was the hub of the international music scene, and Hess was associated with many of the musical luminaries of his day and taught students who came to Berlin from all over the world, the most distinguished of whom was his fellow German Adolf Busch.

Hess taught a German style of right hand technique which emphasized wrist motion with very little finger motion.

He had no difficulty alternating between the violin and viola, and performed the viola part in the first performance of Bruch&#x27;s Double Concerto for Clarinet, Viola and Orchestra, Op. 88, as well as the first performance of the Violin Concerto, op. 50 by Felix Woyrsch 1903 in Altona. It was also in 1910 that Bruch composed the &quot;Concert Piece&quot; for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 84, for Hess. Hess advised Bruch on composing for strings, and also performed the premieres of other works by Bruch.

Among works by other composers written for Hess was Arthur Foote&#x27;s &quot;Ballade&quot;, Op. 69.

He played in a piano trio with cellist Hugo Becker and pianist James Kwast.

One of the instruments he played on was a Guadagnini.

Hess died in Berlin in 1939, aged 79.

<text>Willy Hess (12 October 1906 – 9 May 1997) was a Swiss musicologist, composer, and famous Beethoven scholar. He achieved fame after compiling and publishing a catalogue of works of Beethoven that were not listed in the &quot;complete&quot; edition. He orchestrated the Piano Concerto No. 0, in E-flat from a piano score.

==Life==
Hess was born in Winterthur, where he attended primary and high school, and later studied at the Zurich Conservatory (merged in 1999 into the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT), itself merged in 2007 into the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK)) and at the University. He also taught piano, counterpoint, and composition, and wrote about music.

Among other works, he wrote &quot;3 Ländler&quot;, Op. 28 for a 4-hand piano duet. He also wrote a Sonata for Viola and Bassoon, the only classical-style chamber work written for that combination of instruments.

He also was a bassoonist with the Winterthur Stadtorchester from 1942 to 1971.

He died in Winterthur.

<text>The Taylor Coot is a two-seat homebuilt amphibious aircraft designed by Moulton Taylor, famous for his flying car designs. When a market for the Aerocar did not emerge, Taylor turned to more conventional designs. The Coot was nonetheless somewhat unusual for its low wing, a feature uncommon on most seaplanes and flying boats, which conventionally strive to keep their wings as far away from the water as possible. Instead, Taylor designed the Coot&#x27;s wing roots to act as sponsons to stabilise the craft in the water. The arrangement allowed him to do away with the weight and drag penalties imposed by wingtip floats, and additionally gain ground effect benefits during takeoff. First flown in 1969, the Coot proved very popular with homebuilders, with an estimated 70 aircraft completed by 2007.

The wings and elevator surfaces of the Taylor Coot can be folded for transport and storage. With wings folded the aircraft is wide. Some builders have equipped their aircraft with auxiliary sponsons. It is equipped with tricycle landing gear: The nose wheel casters freely and steering on the ground is accomplished with differential braking of the main gear.

The plans and three books about the Coot are available through Richard Steeves of Madison, Wisconsin.

On June 6, 2018, a Taylor Coot Model A registered as N100TN attempted to take off from a lake, but suffered hull loss. The pilot escaped through the canopy. However, the issue was determined to have been caused by the pilot choosing to take off with a known structural issue.

<doc id="1196969" wikidata="Q136760" url="?curid=1196969" title="Waratah">
<text>The waratah (genus Telopea) is an Australian-endemic genus of five species of large shrubs or small trees, native to the southeastern parts of Australia (New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania). The best-known species in this genus is &quot;Telopea speciosissima&quot;, which has bright red flowers and is the New South Wales (NSW) state emblem. The waratah is a member of the family Proteaceae, flowering plants distributed in the Southern Hemisphere. The key diagnostic feature of Proteaceae is the inflorescence, which is often very large, brightly coloured and showy, consisting of many small flowers densely packed into a compact head or spike. Species of waratah boast such inflorescences ranging from 6–15 cm in diameter with a basal ring of coloured bracts. The leaves are spirally arranged, 10–20 cm long and 2–3 cm broad with entire or serrated margins. The name &quot;waratah&quot; comes from the Eora Aboriginal people, the pre-European inhabitants of the Sydney area.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Telopea&quot; belongs to the plant family Proteaceae. Within the Proteaceae, their closest relatives appear to be the genera &quot;Alloxylon&quot; (tree waratahs), &quot;Oreocallis&quot; and &quot;Embothrium&quot;, a group of generally terminal red-flowering plants that skirt the southern edges of the Pacific Rim. Together they make up the subtribe Embothriinae. The genus was first described by Robert Brown in 1810 from the type species &quot;Telopea speciosissima&quot;. There are five species of plant within the genus, all of which readily hybridize in cultivation. There are two main branches, with one being the species pair of &quot;T. speciosissima&quot; and &quot;T. aspera&quot;, with the other lineage giving rise to &quot;T. truncata&quot; first, then &quot;T. oreades&quot; and &quot;T. mongaensis&quot;. The &quot;speciosissima-aspera&quot; lineage (clade) has two synapomorphies—distinguishing common characteristics presumed not present in ancestors—leaves with toothed margins, and large red involucral bracts. The &quot;truncata-oreades-mongaensis&quot; lineage has flowers that open from the centre to the edge of the inflorescence (basitonic) rather than the reverse (acrotonic), which is a feature of the &quot;speciosissima-aspera&quot; clade and more distant relatives.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Telopea&quot; contains five species:
==Habitat==
Species grow as either large shrubs or small trees with spirally arranged leaves with either entire or serrated margins. They prefer sandy loam soils and are a pyrogenic flowering species, meaning that they rely on post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds to take advantage of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire.

===Distribution===
The natural distributions of the five species of &quot;Telopea&quot; are all confined to east coast regions from northern New South Wales to Tasmania. Each of the species has its own distinctive natural distribution with minimal or no overlap. Climatic changes may have restricted the expansion of species distribution or led to its isolation in a particular region. However, waratahs can also grow outside of these natural distribution areas. Cultivation mostly occurs north of Sydney and in the Dandenong Ranges, Victoria. &quot;T. speciosissima&quot; has also been grown successfully in areas not on the map. In Australia these areas include south-west Western Australia, the Queensland coast and also Toowoomba. Overseas, New Zealand, the USA, South Africa, and Israel are all also able to grow waratah with varying degrees of success. It was introduced to England in 1789 but cannot survive English winters out of doors except in the south-west coastal regions, and it rarely flowers in glasshouses.

==Cultivation==
For some time the waratah has had a reputation as a difficult plant. It has a complex culture and for many years there have been cases of people trying to establish the plant only to have the attempt fail. This can be the effect of unsuitable soil conditions, aspect or climate. The waratah is also a slow plant to mature with a flowering period that is short, unpredictable and unreliable. Early issues with cultivation meant that approximately 90% of all waratahs sold at Sydney’s Flemington markets in the early 90s were bush picked. Some progress has been made in the 20 years since then with several cultivars being commercially grown mostly in areas to the North and South of Sydney and in the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria. Issues with cultivation are still present however.

===Propagation===

The propagation of waratah for commercial production is relatively easy in comparison to other stages of the growth cycle. Plants are usually propagated from cuttings, fresh seed or stored seed. Fresh seed has a good germination rate but deteriorates fairly rapidly unless stored at low temperature and low humidity. Dry seed will last a few years in refrigerated storage but should be treated with a general purpose fungicide prior to storage and at propagation to ensure good germination rates and healthy seedlings. The best time to take cuttings is when the plant is experiencing a flush of growth. The cuttings are taken from firm wood from the last twelve months growth. If plant material is scarce, single nodes can be used for cutting propagation.

Other methods of propagation that are successful but not widely used for commercial production include grafting and tissue culture. Stock for grafting is vigorous and as such is labour-intensive in constant control of stock regrowth from the lignotuber. As such, it is not a recommended method but is useful for the fast growth of limited material. Rootstock and scion combinations are used for many woody perennials to provide the necessary mix of floral or fruit characteristics and cultural requirements.

Tissue culture is very labour-intensive and would likely only be used in the case of rapidly increasing the number of plants from limited or valuable material. The process is complex though as different clones require different optimal culture conditions requiring different developmental work for each clone. There also exists problems with hardening off, with roots and leaves produced &quot;in vivo&quot; dying off on planting out.

For &quot;Telopea&quot; plants propagated from seed, the transition from seedling to flower takes about 5 years. Cuttings may take only 2 years. The most common form of propagation is from seed, however, certain varieties and cultivars must be propagated from cuttings if the grower wishes the plants to remain true to form. Fresh seed has a higher viability than cuttings and will germinate 2–3 weeks after sewing.

===Commercial cultivation===
The overall cultivation of the waratah as a single process is a tricky one as flowering time, number and quality are easily affected by changes in the plant environment. These factors must be considered as early as prior to buying land for production. North facing aspect ensures a maximum of sun exposure. A combination of northerly, easterly and westerly aspects will spread the flowering time with the western slope flowering slightly later on. As the location approaches the equator, flowering time will be earlier. Elevation also has to be considered as it will affect temperature, a major influence on flowering time. More flowers will be produced in full sunlight although better quality flowers are found in the shade. Paul Nixon (1997) in his book ‘The Waratah’ claims that ‘the ideal situation is to have rich, well drained, deep soil with a north-easterly aspect giving the plants full sun until the flowers buds have initiated and then put shade cloth over the bushes until they have flowered’.

A primary consideration for cultivation is water drainage. The waratah naturally grows in poor, sandy soils where it thrives due to the soils excellent water draining properties. Drainage properties can be linked to aspect and as a result plants grown on a north easterly aspect will generally flower 1–2 weeks earlier than a westerly aspect at the same location. Watering systems must also be carefully considered to coincide with correct drainage. As an Australian native the waratah is a sturdy plant well adapted to coping with harsh environments and low rainfall. Watering systems are still necessary for cultivation in order to produce a reliable crop and a quality bloom.

In the wild the waratah has become adapted to growing in nutrient-poor soils leading many people to believe that this is what is necessary for the development of the plant. Fertilisers are not necessary for the development of the plant but the waratah has been shown to be receptive to some treatments. Many native plants have been known to have poor establishment in soils with high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. This coincides with the observation that fertiliser application immediately after transplant of waratahs in the field often leads to high mortalities. Other studies have reported a strong growth response to high nutrient levels, particularly phosphorus. As yet, the details of this response are not yet clear and suggest a complex nitrogen-phosphorus relationship. Earlier work (1963) on related species, had indicated that fertiliser application may hasten maturation and give early flowering. If fertiliser is applied, drainage properties of the soil mean that nutrients are quickly leached and so the best application method is multiple applications at critical stages in development such as flush periods.

Pruning is a very important consideration for the commercial growth of waratahs in the effort to design a shape for the plant that will encourage the maximum production of saleable blooms. The aim is to get as many growing tips as possible as it is on these that the flowers will develop.

With the correct mix of factors for cultivation it is possible to produce up to sixty blooms per plant per year. This could translate to up to 20,000 to 50,000 blooms per ha. Waratah inflorescences are harvested when 0–50% of flowers are open, although inflorescences with 0–5% of flower open have the longest vase life and least opportunity for bract damage in the field.

===Cultivars===
A number of selected forms of &quot;T. speciosissima&quot; and hybrids with other &quot;Telopea&quot; species are being brought into cultivation. These exhibit variations in the colour of the flowers and/or the bracts. Some examples include:

===Issues of cultivation===
Issues with cultivation occur throughout the growth cycle of &quot;Telopea&quot; spp. with the first issues being encountered at the seedling stage. Waratah seedlings are often associated with a common plant condition known as damping off. Damping off is a condition that causes the death of seeds or seedlings facilitated by a number of different fungal pathogens. A given seed can become infected with a fungus, often causing it to darken and soften, killing the seedling before it emerges or causing it to emerge in a pre-weakened state. Seedlings can also be infected after emergence resulting in the stem thinning until it eventually rots and the seedling topples over. The problem is often associated with and encouraged by excessively wet conditions.

Another major issue for production is bract browning – a discolouration of the showy floral bracts of the floral head occurring prior to harvest. Bract browning has been a major restraint to financial returns due to reduced cut flower quality. Browning is usually a result of sun damage but can also be associated with wind burn. The addition of shade cloths to crop management strategies has been shown to reduce levels of excessive light and has significantly minimised financial losses due to the reduction of occurrence of bract browning.

In the natural state, the waratah does not compete very well with surrounding shrubs and is at its best after fire when competition is removed. This means that weed presence during cultivation has a profound effect on growth, particularly when the waratahs are small. Weeds should be seriously tended to in the early stages of growth. Once plants have reached waist height cases should be analysed individually to determine the best method of weed control.

In New South Wales the most destructive pest to waratah crops is the macadamia twig girdler (&quot;Neodrepta luteotactella&quot;). The damage is caused by the larvae and damage generally first shows at a branch fork or leaf. The condition is generally confined to young shrubs or trees. The leaves are skeletonised and the larvae web them together into a shelter that incorporates larval faeces. Larvae can also burrow into the developing flower head, obliterating a crop entirely if left uncontrolled. Biological control methods include encouragement of bird species. The borer is present throughout the year and so pesticide treatments with a strong persistent spray should be carried out monthly. What is used for the borer should also control lesser pests such as white scale, which is common in the natural state, and Macadamia leafminer (&quot;Acocercops chionosema&quot;). Leafminer poses no threat to the life of the plant but it is preferred that stems for the market still have leaves attached. Thus damaged leaves lower the value of the crop. Chemicals with zylene or toluene should not be used as the will not be tolerated by the plant.

There are also issues of fungal infection. Oomycete and fungal species cause stem rot (&quot;Phytophthora&quot; spp.) and root rot (&quot;Rhizoctonia&quot; spp.) that can ultimately cause plant death but can usually be controlled by adequate drainage.

A problem for production that emanates from within the plant is the high amount of genetic and therefore morphological variability present in the flowers produced. The need to lift the quality and consistency of cut flower product has been repeatedly highlighted by industry reviews. Inconsistency of product is a key impediment to further industry growth.

==Floral morphology==
In many genera of Proteaceae the inflorescence is very large and showy, often in bright colours, consisting of many small flowers densely packed into a compact head or spike. The individual flowers within the inflorescence also give Proteaceae species a unique look. &quot;Telopea&quot; species are long-lived, perennial plants that re-sprout from lignotubers after fire. After a few years of fire, re-sprouting stems produce the terminal flowers which continue the flowering cycle annually. The &quot;Telopea&quot; &#x27;flower&#x27; is in fact an inflorescence that comprises from as few as 10 to as many as 240 individual flowers, depending upon the species concerned. The style is thickened at the distal end to form a &#x27;pollen-presenter&#x27;. Pollen presenters have an area on the style end that presents the pollen to the pollinator. The stigma is initially trapped within the perianth and as the style grows it becomes bent until it splits the perianth and the pistil is released to spring upright. An open inflorescence usually contains functionally male and female flowers at any one time. Inflorescences range from 6–15 cm in diameter with a basal ring of coloured bracts.

===Flowering processes===
Before a flower can be produced the plant must undergo floral induction and initiation. Floral induction involves physiological processes in the plant that result in the shoot apical meristem becoming competent to develop flowers. It involves biochemical changes at the apex, particularly those caused by cytokinins and the processes can be reversed. Floral initiation is the morphological transformation of an induced growing point from a vegetative to a floral primordium and involves the plant hormone florigen. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favourable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue. Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower. Flower induction and initiation can simply occur when a plant has reached a mature enough age. However, in many plant species floral process occur in response to a number of environmental signals, or alternatively, are repressed by environmental signals.

Floral initiation in &quot;T. speciosissima&quot; has been observed from mid-December, with floral buds developing more rapidly on older shoots and floral primordia emerging from mid-January to February. The floral primordia initiate over a 6–8 week period after primary flush growth from November to January. After the primordia initiation there may be another vegetative flush of growth on the plants. The flower develops in bud form for seven to eight months. The date of flowering is highly variable as waratah flowering is sensitive to its environment.
Flowering tends to vary with geographic location and climatic differences, occurring from early August in coastal Queensland and up to December in Tasmania. Waratahs have a short flowering period in one location, although varieties can be selected to ensure a reasonable spread. It has been shown that in a population of 1000 seedlings where the total flowering time was five weeks, the spread was so that 10% flowered in week one and 10% in week five. Much variation was accounted for by varietal differences with plants of the one variety flowering at much the same time. Generally, waratahs flower over a 4–6 week period in spring (September–October) in the Sydney region, but later in cooler areas.

==Cultural references==
Indigenous Tharawal peoples from around the Cronulla region of southern Sydney use the waratah medicinally. Placing the flowers into a bowl of water so that the nectar can be soaked out, the flower water is then drunk for pleasure (for its strengthening effect and for curing illnesses in children and the elderly).

The botanical journal &quot;Telopea&quot; is named after the genus, as is the western Sydney suburb of Telopea, New South Wales.

Neptune Oil Company used the waratah as a brand for its motor spirit from the late 1910s until being phased out in the 1940s.

&quot;Telopea speciosissima&quot; is the floral emblem of the state of New South Wales and several organisations in the state, including the New South Wales Waratahs rugby team and Grace Bros (now Myer). Waratah is also the name of the Sydney Trains A set, a class of electric multiple unit trains operated by Sydney Trains in Sydney. In 2009, the Premier of New South Wales, Nathan Rees, commissioned a state logo based on the floral emblem. The resultant logo design has been criticised as resembling a lotus rather than the New South Wales waratah.

<text>Crimson is the fifth full-length studio album by Swedish death metal band Edge of Sanity, which is their first concept album and was released in 1996 by Black Mark Production. It features a single 40-minute track, telling a story in the distant future, when human civilization is about to end.

The album, which features Opeth frontman Mikael Åkerfeldt, received substantial critical acclaim, and is considered by most fans to be Edge of Sanity&#x27;s finest achievement. A sequel, &quot;Crimson II&quot;, was released in 2003 and picks up directly where the first album left off. Both albums were remixed and slightly edited to fit together on one CD for release on the 2006 compilation &quot;When All Is Said&quot;; these new mixes/edits were split into sections and released digitally to online retailers and streaming services.

While the album was originally pressed on vinyl upon release in 1996, it was later reissued with &quot;Crimson II&quot; as a double vinyl in 2003. This version splits the song in half, the parts running 18:38 and 21:04 respectively.

==Narrative==
The album&#x27;s single song tells the story of a world where humans no longer can bear children. Into this time of despair a child is born to the King and Queen of the barren Earth. The Queen dies during childbirth, and the King is left to rule the Earth and raise his daughter on his own. The people think the child is a sign that God will give them back the ability to reproduce, but as the child grows into a teenager humanity remains infertile. In time, the King dies and men fight over his throne.

The new King crushes rebellions against his illegitimate rule and is generally hated by the populace. Eventually the Child is persuaded to lead a coup. As she is left alone to plan, the forces of evil beckon to her. She accepts an unholy Master and gains strong magical powers. She slays the false King easily and begins ruling Earth. The people watch her obsessively, because it was thought that by restoring the rightful ruler they might be returned the gift of breeding. But the new Queen misleads the people and slays the elders who the humans had preserved for their wisdom. Word of this gets out and a group of rebels gathers to stop her. They find a way to neutralize her power (by blinding her) and then place her in the same preservative tank of &quot;crimson fluid&quot; that the elders were kept in.

==Track listing==
===Original edition===
===Japanese edition===
===Digital edition===
The digital release of the album uses the &quot;When All is Said&quot; remix/edit and splits it differently, causing some movement times to shift out of alignment. Most of the tracks also fade in and out at the beginning/end.

<doc id="1196988" wikidata="Q270787" url="?curid=1196988" title="Kismayo">
<text>Kismayo (, , ; ) is a port city in the southern Lower Juba (Jubbada Hoose) province of Somalia. It is the commercial capital of the autonomous Jubaland region.

The city is situated southwest of the capital Mogadishu, near the mouth of the Jubba River, where it empties into the Indian Ocean. According to the United Nations Development Programme, the city of Kismayo had a population of around 89,333 in 2005.

During the Middle Ages, Kismayo and its surrounding area was part of the Ajuran Empire that governed much of southern Somalia and eastern Ethiopia, with its domain extending from Hafun in the north, to Qelafo in the west, to Kismayo in the south.

In the early modern period, Kismayo was ruled by the Geledi Sultanate and by the later 1800s, the Boqow dynasty. The kingdom was eventually incorporated into Italian Somaliland in 1925/6 after the death of the last sultan, Osman Ahmed. After independence in 1960, the city was made the center of the official Kismayo District.

Kismayo was the site of numerous battles during the civil war, from the early 1990s. In late 2006, Islamist militants affiliated with Al-Shabaab gained control of most of the city. To reclaim possession of the territory, a new autonomous regional administration dubbed &quot;Azania&quot; was announced in 2010 and formalized in 2011. In September 2012, the Somali National Army and AMISOM troops re-captured the city from the Al-Shabaab insurgents. The Juba Interim Administration was established and recognized in 2013.

==History==

===Antiquity===
During antiquity, Kismayo was part of the Somali city-states that in engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemic Egypt, Greece, Parthian Persia, Saba, Nabataea and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the &quot;beden&quot; to transport their cargo.

===Middle Ages and the early modern period===
The Kismayo area was originally a small fishing settlement.

During the Middle Ages, the region came under the rule of the influential Ajuran Sultanate, which utilized the Jubba River for its plantations.

After the collapse of this polity, the House of Gobroon was established and the Sultanate of the Geledi held sway over the area. The dynasty reached its apex under the successive reigns of Sultan Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim, who successfully consolidated Gobroon power during the Bardera wars, and Sultan Ahmed Yusuf, who forced regional powers such as the Omani Empire to submit tribute.

=== Colonial Era ===
The Italians referred to the city as &quot;Chisimaio&quot;. Kismayo and the northern half of the Jubaland region were incorporated into neighboring Italian Somaliland on 30 June 1926. The colony had a total area of 87,000 km2 (33,000 sq mi), with a population of 120,000 inhabitants. Britain retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District (NFD).

===Somali Civil War===

Following the breakdown of central authority that accompanied the civil war in 1991, various local militias fought for control of the city, including supporters of Mohammed Said Hersi (&quot;General Morgan&quot;), and Col. Barre Adan Shire Hiiraale Somali National Front (SNF), later on known as the Juba Valley Alliance (JVA). As well of Col. Omar Jess&#x27; Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM). Aid worker Sean Devereux was assassinated in the city in January 1993. In March 1993, a United States Marine amphibious group arrived in the city in an attempt to keep the peace as part of the United Nations intervention in Somalia. By December 1993, General Morgan&#x27;s troops controlled Kismayo, despite the presence of peacekeepers. The last UN troops left the city in December 1994.

General Morgan briefly declared Jubaland independent on September 3, 1998. Political opponents of his subsequently united as the Allied Somali Forces (ASF), seizing control of Kismayo by June of the following year. Led by Colonel Barre Adan Shire Hiiraale, the ASF administration renamed itself the Juba Valley Alliance in 2001. On June 18 of that year, an 11-member interclan council decided to ally the JVA with the newly forming Transitional Federal Government.

On January 8, 2007, as the Battle of Ras Kamboni raged just south of Kismayo, the TFG relocated from its interim location in Baidoa to the nation&#x27;s capital, Mogadishu. This marked the first time since the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.

Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military&#x27;s presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al‑Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. By January 2009, Al‑Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government&#x27;s troops.

In September 2012, Somali Army, Ras Kamboni militiamen and Kenyan Defense Forces (KDF), all under command of the African Union Mission in Somalia AMISOM, re-captured the city from the Al-Shabaab insurgents during the Battle of Kismayo (2012). This was a culmination to the Kenyan Operation Linda Nchi attack into Somalia which had begun late the year before.

On 12 July 2019, a car bomb and a gun attack at the Asasey hotel killed at least 26, including two prominent journalists and nine foreigners. Islamist group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility.

== Geography ==

===Location===
Kismayo is located in the fertile Juba Valley in southeastern Somalia, on the Somali Sea coast. Nearby settlements include to the northeast Xamareyso (5.0 nm), to the north Dalxiiska (1.3 nm), to the northwest Qeyla Dheere (6.4 nm), to the west Saamogia (0.9 nm), to the southwest Iach Bulle (10.0 nm), and to the south Qandal (6.5 nm). The largest cities in the country most proximate to Kismayo are Jamaame (52 km), Jilib (97 km), and Merca (337 km).

===Climate===
Kismayo has a tropical semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) Weather is hot year-round, with seasonal monsoon winds and irregular rainfall with recurring droughts. The &quot;gu&quot; rains, also known as the Southwest Monsoons, begin in April and last until July producing significant fresh water and allowing lush vegetation to grow. The &quot;gu&quot; season is followed by the &quot;xagaa&quot; (hagaa) dry season.

== Government ==
A new municipal district administration was established on 6 September 2008. Its members reportedly represented the ICU and Al‑Shabaab (three members each) in addition to a local clan (one member) which had played a part in the military assault. Representatives of the Islamic Courts Union questioned the legitimacy of the authority. On 1 October 2009, Al Shabaab took full control of the city, after Sheikh Ahmed Madobe, a senior commander of Ras Kamboni Brigade (then a part of Hizbul Islam), challenged Al‑Shabaab&#x27;s control.

With the subsequent ouster of the Al-Shabaab rebels in September 2012, the Somali government began preparing mediations between the city&#x27;s various stakeholders in order to establish an inclusive local administration. On 28 August 2013, the autonomous Jubaland administration signed a national reconciliation agreement in Addis Ababa with the federal government. Endorsed by the federal State Minister for the Presidency Farah Abdulkadir on behalf of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the pact was brokered by the Foreign Ministry of Ethiopia and came after protracted bilateral talks.
Under the terms of the agreement, Jubaland is administered for a two-year period by a Juba Interim Administration and led by the region&#x27;s incumbent president, Ahmed Mohamed Islam. The regional president serves as the chairperson of a new Executive Council, to which he appoints three deputies. Additionally, the agreement includes the integration of Jubaland&#x27;s military forces under the central command of the Somali National Army (SNA), and stipulates that the Juba Interim Administration will command the regional police.
=== Districts ===
Kismayo is divided into 4 districts, or &quot;degmo&quot; (see map):
*Calanley
*Farjano
*Shaqaalaha
*Fanoole

== Education ==
Institutions of higher learning in the city include Kismayo University (KU). Established in August 2005, it is situated about 1 km north, along the Kismayo–Mogadishu main road.

==Women&#x27;s rights==
In 2022 Adar Ismail Jurati led a consultative meeting with government officials and people who perform female gential mutilation (FGM) with a view to stopping the practice in the area.

== Economy ==
In October 2008, the daily labor rate was estimated at 157,500 Somali shillings (approximately $4.50), up from 52,000 shillings (approximately $2.21) in January 2008, while a kilogram of red rice rose from 14,170 (approximately $0.61) to 46,000 (approximately $1.31). A liter of diesel cost 43,000 shillings (approximately $1.23) and a camel costs over 15 million shillings (approximately $435). Total cereal production as of 2008 was estimated to be 780MT.

== Transportation ==

===Airport===

Kismayo&#x27;s air transportation needs are served by Kismayo Airport, which is situated about 10 km from the city. It was formerly a Somali Air Force training base. Following the outbreak of the civil war, the airport was closed down for a period of time and its infrastructure was significantly damaged. However, the facility was reopened in October 2008 by the Islamic Courts Union after undergoing some renovations. That same year, the airport was also renamed after Imam Ahmed Gurey, a 16th‑century Somali military leader.

The Kismayo Airport was officially brought under the Juba Interim Administration in August 2013. Per agreement, management of the facility was scheduled to be transferred to the Federal Government after a period of six months. Revenues and resources generated from the airport will also be earmarked for Jubaland&#x27;s service delivery and security sectors as well as local institutional development.
===Roads===
Three main thoroughfares connect Kismayo to other major areas in the country. The 600 km Highway 3 runs the length of the Juba Valley. Starting in Beled Hawo, it goes through Garbaharey, Bardera and Buale before finally reaching Kismayo.

A paved 528 km freeway links the capital Mogadishu with Kismayo, passing through Jilib before turning towards the capital. A third highway extends northwest from Kismayo to Afmadow, then turns toward Dhobley in the eastern part of the Gedo region.

In January 2015, the Interim Juba Administration launched a transport beautification and cleaning campaign in Kismayo. Part of a broader urbanization drive, the initiative includes the clearing of clogged streets and lanes, razing of illegal buildings therein, and further development of the municipal road network.

===Seaport===
Kismayo&#x27;s large docks are situated on a peninsula on the Somali Sea coast. Formerly one of the Bajuni Islands, the peninsula was connected by a narrow causeway when the modern Port of Kismayo was built in 1964 with U.S. assistance. The port served as a base for the Somali Navy as well as the Soviet Navy after the 1969 military coup. In 1984, Somalia and the United States jointly refurbished the port after significant wear to the four-berth, marginal wharf made major renovations necessary.

The Port of Kismayo was officially brought under the Juba Interim Administration in August 2013. According to the agreement, management of the facility was scheduled to be transferred to the Somali Federal Government after a period of six months. Like Kismayo Airport, revenues and resources generated by the seaport are to be earmarked for Jubaland&#x27;s service delivery and security sectors as well as local institutional development.

<text>Lilium humboldtii, or Humboldt&#x27;s lily, is a species of lily native to the US state of California and the Mexican state of Baja California. It is named after naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt. It is native to the South High Cascade Range, High Sierra Nevada, south Outer South Coast Ranges, and the Santa Monica Mountains and others in Southern California, growing at elevations from to .

==Description==
&quot;Lilium humboldtii&quot; grows up to tall, with flowers that are maroon-spotted, golden-orange with dark red splotches, with orange to brown stamens. The plant flowers in June, with flowers growing in a pyramidal inflorescence. The flowers are on stout stems, which are sometimes brown-purple. The subrhizomatous bulb is large, with yellowish-white scales, and grows very deep in the soil. The leaves grow in whorls, and are undulate, shiny, and oblanceolate. It is summer-deciduous, dying back after flowering in mid- to late summer.

;Subspecies
*&quot;Lilium humboldtii&quot; subsp. &quot;humboldtii&quot; - central California
*&quot;Lilium humboldtii&quot; subsp. &quot;ocellatum&quot; - southern California, Baja California

Both subspecies are on the California Native Plant Society &quot;Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California&quot; and described as &quot;fairly endangered in California&quot;.

Albert Kellogg, unaware that the plant had already been named by Roezl and Leichtlin, gave it the name &quot;Lilium bloomerianum&quot;. For some time afterward, the name was still applied to the southern California &quot;Lilium humboldtii&quot; subsp. &quot;ocellatum&quot;.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Lilium humboldtii&quot; is sold as a garden bulb. It prefers dry summer dormancy, with no water after blooming, good drainage, and part shade. It was one of the parents, along with &quot;Lilium pardalinum&quot;, that produced the Bellingham hybrid lilies, which eventually resulted in the popular &#x27;Shuksan&#x27; and &#x27;Star of Oregon&#x27; lilies.

<text>Johanes Maliza (born September 10, 1981) is an American soccer midfielder who, in 2004 and 2005, played for the Puerto Rico Islanders of the USL First Division. He has since entered politics and law.

==Soccer==
Maliza attended Latin School of Chicago where he was a Parade Magazine High School All American. He then played his college soccer at Stanford from 1999 to 2002 along with Roger Levesque and Todd Dunivant. On January 17, 2003, the San Jose Earthquakes selected Maliza 46th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft. He suffered a severe right hamstring injury in the early pre-season which prevented him from playing for several months. On May 31, 2003, he finally signed a developmental contract with the Quakes. He failed to see any playing time and was waived in September. He signed with the Islanders in 2004 and retired from playing professionally following the 2005 season.

==Law==
Following his retirement from soccer, Maliza entered politics and law. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in history from Stanford University in 2003, and his Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 2010. Maliza served as an assistant federal public defender in Springfield from 2017 to 2021. In 2006, he worked for the Harold Ford campaign in Knox County, Tennessee. He travelled to Kenya where he worked in the Legal Advice Center. He then entered Harvard Law School where he was selected for a 2008 Chayes Fellowship and wrote for the &quot;Harvard Law Record&quot;. Johanes’ pro bono work includes immigration, housing, and post-conviction representations in Illinois, Ohio, and other states. For his work representing unaccompanied children and refugees facing religious or other persecution, in 2015 the American Immigration Lawyers Association recognized Johanes and colleagues for outstanding efforts in providing pro bono representation in the immigration field.

On June 11, 2022, Maliza was one of three recommendations made by U.S. senators Dick Durbin &amp; Tammy Duckworth made for a district court seat on the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois.
