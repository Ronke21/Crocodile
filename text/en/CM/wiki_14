<text>Environmental studies (EVS or EVST) is a multidisciplinary academic field which systematically studies human interaction with the environment. Environmental studies connects principles from the physical sciences, commerce/economics, the humanities, and social sciences to address complex contemporary environmental issues. It is a broad field of study that includes the natural environment, the built environment, and the relationship between them. The field encompasses study in basic principles of ecology and environmental science, as well as associated subjects such as ethics, geography, anthropology, public policy (environmental policy), education, political science (environmental politics), urban planning, law, economics, philosophy, sociology and social justice, planning, pollution control, and natural resource management. There are many Environmental Studies degree programs, including a Master&#x27;s degree and a Bachelor&#x27;s degree. Environmental Studies degree programs provide a wide range of skills and analytical tools needed to face the environmental issues of our world head on. Students in Environmental Studies gain the intellectual and methodological tools to understand and address the crucial environmental issues of our time and the impact of individuals, society, and the planet. Environmental education&#x27;s main goal is to instill in all members of society a pro-environmental thinking and attitude. This will help to create environmental ethics and raise people&#x27;s awareness of the importance of environmental protection and biodiversity.

==History==
The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University established a BS in environmental studies degree in the 1950s, awarding its first degree in 1956. Middlebury College established the major there in 1965.

The Environmental Studies Association of Canada (ESAC) was established in 1993 &quot;to further research and teaching activities in areas related to environmental studies in Canada&quot;. ESAC was officially integrated in 1994, and the first convention for ESAC was held at the Learned Societies Conference in Calgary the same year. ESAC&#x27;s magazine, &quot;A\J: Alternatives Journal&quot; was first published by Robert A. Paehlke on 4 July 1971.

In 2008, The Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences (AESS) was founded as the first professional association in the interdisciplinary field of environmental studies in the United States. The AESS is also the publisher for the &quot;Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences&quot; (JESS), which aims to allow researchers in various disciplinarians related to environmental sciences to have base for researchers to use and publish new information related to environmental studies. In 2010, the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) agreed to advise and support the association. In March 2011, The association&#x27;s scholarly journal, the &quot;Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences&quot; (JESS), commenced publication.

Environmental Studies in U.S. Universities

In the United States, many high school students are able to take environmental science as a college-level course. Over 500 colleges and universities in the United States offer environmental studies as a degree. The University of California, Berkeley has awarded the most degrees in environmental studies for U.S. universities, with 409 degrees awarded in 2019. The universities in the United States that have the highest percentage of degrees awarded is Antioch University-New England, where nearly 35% of degrees awarded in 2019 were in environmental studies.

== Education ==

Worldwide, programs in environmental studies may be offered through colleges of liberal arts, life science, social science, or agriculture. Students of environmental studies use what they learn from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities to better understand environmental problems and potentially offer solutions to them. Students look at how we interact with the natural world and come up with ideas to prevent its destruction.

In the 1960s, the word &quot;environment&quot; became one of the most commonly used in educational discourse in the United Kingdom. Educationists were becoming increasingly worried about the influence of the environment on children as well as the school&#x27;s usage of the environment. The attempt to define the field of environmental studies has resulted in a discussion over its role in the curriculum. The use of the environment is one of the teaching approaches used in today&#x27;s schools to carry on the legacy of educational philosophy known as &#x27;Progressive education&#x27; or &#x27;New education&#x27; in the first part of the twentieth century. The primary goal of environmental studies is to assist children in understanding the processes that influence their surroundings so that they do not stay a passive, and often befuddled, observer of the environment, but rather become knowledgeable active mediators of it. The study of the environment can be considered to offer unique chances for the development and exercise of the general cognitive skills that Piaget&#x27;s work has made educators aware of. Environmental studies are increasingly being viewed as a long-term preparation for higher environmental studies such as Sociology, Archaeology, or Historical Geography.

<doc id="1195475" wikidata="Q303308" url="?curid=1195475" title="Fujitsu VP">
<text>The Fujitsu FACOM VP is a series of vector supercomputers designed, manufactured, and marketed by Fujitsu. Announced in July 1982, the FACOM VP were the first of the three initial Japanese commercial supercomputers, followed by the Hitachi HITAC S-810 in August 1982 and the NEC SX-2 in April 1983.

==Context in the supercomputer market==
The FACOM VP were sold until they were replaced by the VP2000 family in 1990. Developed with funding from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the FACOM VP was part of an effort designed to wrest control of the supercomputer market from the collection of small US-based companies like Cray Research. The FACOM VP was marketed in Japan by Fujitsu, where the majority of installations were located. Amdahl marketed the systems in the US and Siemens in Europe. The ending of the Cold War during this period made the market for supercomputers dry up almost overnight, and the Japanese firms decided that their mass-production capabilities were better spent elsewhere.

==Development==
Fujitsu had built a prototype vector co-processor known as the F230-75, which was installed attached to their own mainframe machines in the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission and National Aerospace Laboratory in 1977. The processor was similar in most ways to the famed Cray-1, but did not have vector chaining capabilities and was therefore somewhat slower. Nevertheless, the machines were rather inexpensive, and during the late 1970s supercomputers were seen as a source of national pride, and an effort started to commercialize the design by combining it with a scalar processor to create an all-in-one design.

The result was the VP-100 and VP-200, announced in July 1982. These two models differed primarily in clock rates. Lower-end models were spun off as the VP-30 and VP-50. In 1986 a two-pipeline version was released as the VP-400. The next year the entire series was updated with the addition of a new vector unit that supported a multiply-and-add unit that could retire two results per clock cycle. This resulted in the &quot;E series&quot;, VP-30E through VP-400E.

==Issues with the design==
One problem with the design was the limited memory bandwidth as a result of having only one load-store unit. Even on the top-end VP-400E it could drive only 4.57 GB/s peak, limiting the maximum performance to only 0.5 GFLOPS for 64-bit operands. US designs focused on this problem in the early 1980s, and the contemporary Cray-2 could drive about 2 GB/s per processor, with up to four processors.

<doc id="1195477" wikidata="Q212479" url="?curid=1195477" title="Shades of Deep Purple">
<text>Shades of Deep Purple is the debut album by the English rock band Deep Purple, released in July 1968 on Tetragrammaton in the United States and in September 1968 on Parlophone in the United Kingdom. The band, initially called Roundabout, was the idea of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968.

After about two months of rehearsals, &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot; was recorded in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically, the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.

The album was not well received in the UK, where it sold very few copies and did not chart. In the US, on the other hand, it was a success and the single &quot;Hush&quot;, an energetic rock track written by Joe South and originally recorded by Billy Joe Royal, became very popular at the time, reaching number 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would get in their early US tours and also during the 1970s. Modern reviews of the album are generally positive and consider &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot; an important piece in the history of Deep Purple.

==Background==
When Deep Purple&#x27;s first line-up came together in 1967, there was a moment of transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, in line with the hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.

During this time of great creativity for the British musical scene in the summer of 1967, Chris Curtis, former drummer of the beat band The Searchers, contacted London businessman Tony Edwards to find financing for a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. The name meant that the group would contain a revolving cast of non-permanent members getting on and off the stage like a musical roundabout, with only Curtis as mainstay and singer. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance and manage the venture with two business partners, Ron Hire and John Coletta, and the three of them founded Hire-Edwards-Coletta (HEC) Enterprises.

In September 1967, the first successful Roundabout recruitment was Curtis&#x27; flatmate, the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord; he had most notably played with The Artwoods, a band led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley. At that time, Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden, which also included bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement. They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany. Blackmore had been a member of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat, pop and rock acts, including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, where he had met Little. Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg, where he was hanging out in local clubs. The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967. Meanwhile, Curtis&#x27; erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development, forcing his financiers, HEC Enterprises, to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of filling out the rest of the band.

Lord signed up as bassist his friend Simper, whose fame at the time came from his membership in the rock and roll group Johnny Kidd &amp; The Pirates and for having survived the car crash in 1966 that killed Kidd. The line-up of Roundabout was completed by drummer Bobby Woodman, recruited by Blackmore. Dave Curtiss, an acquaintance of Woodman, was at first considered as singer, but he left to fulfill previous commitments. According to Simper, Ian Gillan, the singer of the band Episode Six, was also contacted for an audition, but declined the offer.

==Early development==

Roundabout moved into Deeves Hall, a rented old farmhouse near the village of South Mimms, Hertfordshire in late February 1968. There, while waiting for the arrival of new musical instruments and equipment, they continued the search for a singer through an advertisement in the British music paper &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Rod Stewart was among the dozens of aspiring vocalists that were considered for the auditions, but was not up to the standards the band required. They chose Rod Evans instead, who was already the singer of the club band The Maze. Evans brought along after the audition his 19-year-old bandmate Ian Paice, a drummer whom Blackmore recognised from his days in Hamburg. They quickly improvised an audition for Paice and he was chosen on the spot to replace Woodman behind the drum kit. Woodman was unhappy with the direction the band was heading and the other members thought that he was not suited for their sound.

The first rehearsals of what would be known as the Mk. I line-up of Deep Purple involved mostly jamming and some work on the instrumentals &quot;And the Address&quot; and &quot;Mandrake Root&quot;, which Blackmore and Lord had written earlier that year. Mandrake Root was also the name of an earlier band that Blackmore had been trying to form in Germany, before being contacted by Roundabout&#x27;s management. After the two instrumentals, the first proper song to be arranged was &quot;Help!&quot;, a Beatles cover that Chris Curtis wanted to include in an eventual album. Evans wrote some lyrics for &quot;Mandrake Root&quot; and reduced to one the number of instrumental tracks. Having arranged and rehearsed the first three songs, the musicians focused their attention on &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot;, a song by Skip James which had earlier been covered by Cream and The Maze. The next addition during rehearsals was &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, a song originally, but disputably, written by Billy Roberts and mistakenly credited to Deep Purple on original releases of the album. The main inspiration for the new arrangement of the song was the 1966 hit version by American guitarist Jimi Hendrix, but the track length was stretched with the inclusion of classical-influenced instrumental sections. The band also selected a pop rock song called &quot;Hush&quot;, written by Joe South for Billy Joe Royal the previous year, which Blackmore had heard while in Germany.

==Recording==
With a possible set list shaping up during rehearsals, Blackmore convinced a friend of his, Derek Lawrence, to be the band&#x27;s producer. They had met years before, when both worked for producer Joe Meek and Lawrence ran an independent production company that recorded singles for release in the United States. Lawrence had many contacts in the US and was present at some of Roundabout&#x27;s sessions, remaining impressed.

Through Lawrence, HEC Enterprises contacted the new American record label Tetragrammaton Records, which was looking for a British band to work with. HEC arranged for the band to cut some demos for the American label in late March and early April at Trident Studios in London. They taped two of their previously developed songs, &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;, as well as two new songs: &quot;Love Help Me&quot; had already been developed before Evans and Paice joined, while &quot;Shadows&quot; was quickly written and arranged by the band for those recording sessions. Lawrence also played the demo of &quot;Help!&quot; to the British recording company EMI, which offered a deal for distribution in Europe with its sub-label Parlophone. All the demos, with the exception of &quot;Shadows&quot;, were sent to Tetragrammaton for approval.

The recording of the demos was followed by a short promotional tour of eight dates in Denmark and Sweden through April and May, booked as Roundabout by a friend of Lord. The band name was changed at this time, after Blackmore suggested the title of his grandmother&#x27;s favourite song, &quot;Deep Purple&quot; by Peter DeRose. Deep Purple played their first gig at the venue of Vestpoppen - a club set up on Parkskolen - a school and youthclub on 76 Parkvej in Taastrup, Denmark on 20 April 1968 and the live set comprised all the new songs and the cover of &quot;Little Girl&quot;, originally by John Mayall and Eric Clapton. When they returned to England, Tetragrammaton confirmed the decision to sign the band. This was a saving grace, because HEC had spent nearly all their budget for promotion and equipment. The band relocated to Highleigh Manor, in Balcombe, West Sussex, because Deeves Hall was no longer available.

While the band was on tour, some studio time had been booked and on Saturday, 11 May 1968, Deep Purple went into Pye Studios at ATV House in London. There, with Lawrence producing and Barry Ainsworth acting as engineer, they recorded the recently gigged material using a four-track tape machine. It was custom in those years, especially for debut bands, to have small production budgets, which allowed very limited time in the recording studio. Under these conditions it was difficult to do many overdubs and the songs were recorded live in one or two takes. &quot;And the Address&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe&quot; were cut first, followed by &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot; later the first day. On Sunday, &quot;Love Help Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot; (with a classical music prelude entitled &quot;Happiness&quot;) and &quot;Mandrake Root&quot; were recorded. Finally, on Monday, 13 May, &quot;One More Rainy Day&quot; was cut, completing the recording of the album. Sound effects extracted from a BBC album were added as transitions between songs during mixing, which was completed later the same day.

==Release==
The finished album was taken to Tetragrammaton&#x27;s representatives in London, who approved its release. After the final approval, the band members were dressed in fashionable costumes at the Mr. Fish Emporium, where they did a photo-shoot. The resulting shots were shipped with the master tapes to America where Tetragrammaton began production and distribution of the album. The cover design by Les Weisbrich allegedly cost half a million dollars.

The single &quot;Hush&quot; was released overseas in June 1968 and it turned out to be a huge success, garnering the band considerable attention and peaking at No. 4 on the US charts and at No. 2 on the Canadian charts. The label&#x27;s reluctance to release &quot;Help!&quot; as the promotional single and instead go for &quot;Hush&quot;, proved ingenious. Widely distributed and hyped, the song was played on radios all over the US, particularly the West Coast, and the band&#x27;s fame grew considerably. The album was released in the United States in July 1968 and reached No. 24 on the Billboard Pop Chart.

&quot;Hush&quot; was released in the UK in late July, but it did not attract much interest. In August, an appearance on British TV at the &quot;David Frost Show&quot; to lip-sync the song was shot with the roadie Mick Angus standing in for an unavailable Blackmore. However, their presence on TV did not help the sales of the single in the UK and made Parlophone postpone the release of the album.

The band recorded some radio sessions for the John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; radio show on BBC, but otherwise, England in general was not their priority. Those recordings recently resurfaced and are included in the compilation album &quot;BBC Sessions 1968–1970&quot;. &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot; was finally released in the United Kingdom with much simpler cover art in September 1968 and went almost unnoticed there. Jon Lord, in an interview with the magazine &quot;Beat Instrumental&quot;, reflected on the scarce receptivity of England to his group and on how lucky the band was to be signed to an American label that gave Deep Purple &quot;far greater freedom both financially and artistically&quot; than they &quot;could ever have got with a British company&quot;, which &quot;as a rule won&#x27;t spend any time or effort with you until you&#x27;re an established name&quot;.

A monaural pressing of the album was released in the UK and Europe, which was simply a fold-down of the stereo mix.

&quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot; was reissued many times all over the world, often in a set with the two following albums recorded by the Mk. I line-up. Besides the original issues, the most significant version of the album is the Remastered CD edition released in 2000 by EMI, which contains as bonus tracks previously unreleased recordings from the first demos in April 1968 and from TV show appearances. All the songs were digitally remastered and restored by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London. In 2004, several tracks were remixed from the 4-track masters, cutting off the sound effects used as transitions in the original edition. These were released on a CD called &quot;The Early Years&quot;.

==Musical style ==
Deep Purple&#x27;s members were experienced musicians with different musical backgrounds: Lord had trained in classical music and had played in jazz and blues rock ensembles, Blackmore and Simper came from session work in pop rock, Paice and Evans from beat bands. However, no one was an accomplished songwriter. The only one with experience in musical composition was Lord, who wrote the arrangements and the bulk of the music for the first album, with some guitar riffs added by Blackmore. The album shows the potential of the band but does not focus on a distinct sound. Clearly identifiable on the album are the musical styles which were developing in the UK in that period and that influenced the young musicians in Deep Purple, a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock, pop rock and hard rock, the latter mostly evident in Blackmore&#x27;s guitar parts.

Traces of the heavy sound that would mark the production of Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Mk. II&quot; line-up (when Evans and Simper were replaced by Gillan and Roger Glover) can already be heard in the opening instrumental &quot;And the Address&quot; and in &quot;Mandrake Root&quot;. The main riff of the latter is very similar to the one in the song &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, a testimony of Blackmore&#x27;s admiration for Jimi Hendrix. The other original compositions, the ballad &quot;One More Rainy Day&quot; and &quot;Love Help Me&quot;, are pop rock songs that enhance the commercial appeal of the album, but are considered by critics less interesting than the cover songs.

The use of so many cover songs to fill up the album was a common feature at the time, because of the short time given to bands for songwriting and for the rushed schedules of production. The songs covered in the album were all treated with new arrangements to be considerably longer and sound more grandiose than the originals, in an attempt to emulate the American rock band Vanilla Fudge, which many Deep Purple members admired. &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot; are clear examples of the &quot;Vanilla Fudge style of slowing a song down and bluesing it up&quot; to get a more psychedelic sound. The sound of the band was also heavily influenced by classical music: &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot; is introduced by &quot;Prelude: Happiness&quot;, featuring an electric arrangement inspired by the first movement of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s symphonic suite &quot;Scheherazade&quot;; the cover of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; was arranged inserting parts taken from the Miller&#x27;s Dance, suite no. 2, part 2 of &quot;El sombrero de tres picos&quot; ballet by Manuel de Falla, on a rhythm reminiscent of the &quot;Boléro&quot; by Maurice Ravel.

==Touring==
Deep Purple&#x27;s live shows were from the start very loud and hard rocking and their stage set included stacks of custom purple vinyl Marshall amps and fancy dresses. The dualism between Blackmore&#x27;s flamboyant guitar playing, which he had honed in many years of daily practice and experimented on tour with Sutch, and Lord&#x27;s rocking Hammond solos was still in an embryonic stage, but it would soon become an integral part of the band&#x27;s dynamics.

Deep Purple debuted at The Roundhouse Theatre in London on 6 July 1968, opening for The Byrds, before The Gun and The Deviants. Their performance was badly received by the audience and by other attending musicians, including Mick Jagger. In spite of this, the band went on playing their live set in local pubs and festivals, but were received coldly and ignored by the press. In an interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Ian Paice explained that their lack of touring and promotion in England was due to the low wages they were offered and to the fact that they had very few danceable numbers to attract audience. He stressed that &quot;we make a point of warning promoters that we are not a dancing group.&quot;

Waiting to start their first US tour and in need of new material to be offered on the American market and to beef up their live show, the band returned to the studio with producer Derek Lawrence to record their second album, &quot;The Book of Taliesyn&quot;, in August 1968. The new album was recorded before the release of &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot; in the UK.

By October, Deep Purple set off to the States to start their US tour. The success of &quot;Hush&quot; was a giant boost in America and from their first gigs they received all the attention they had not been given in England. The first dates were at The Inglewood Forum on 18 and 19 October 1968, supporting Cream in their farewell tour. A recording of those live performances was released in 2002 with the title &quot;Inglewood – Live in California&quot;. The band played at many different locations, including festivals and bars, and made several TV appearances, including &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot; and even &quot;The Dating Game&quot; where, in addition to the band performing, Jon Lord appeared as a contestant. While the &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot; episode has survived in the archives, the &quot;Dating Game&quot; episode is now lost.

The songs of this album were performed regularly by the Mk. I formation of Deep Purple, but only &quot;Hush&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe&quot; found space for a limited time in the live shows of the Mk. II line-up in 1969. However, &quot;Mandrake Root&quot;, in an expanded and mainly instrumental version, was a staple in Mk. II live shows up until 1972, and the instrumental sections of the song survived even longer, being annexed to live versions of the &quot;Machine Head&quot; recording &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot;. The opening chords of &quot;And the Address&quot; were used into the Mk. II era as an introduction to the song &quot;Speed King&quot;. &quot;Hush&quot; was re-recorded in 1988 and is still an integral part of the live set of the current formation of the band.

==Critical reception==

Reception of the album and the band in their home country was generally negative. 
Despite being presented as a &quot;polished commercial group&quot; in their radio appearances, Deep Purple&#x27;s stage excesses and success in the US did not make a good impression on British audiences. The Deviants frontman and later journalist Mick Farren described Deep Purple&#x27;s music as &quot;a slow and pompous din, somewhere between bad Tchaikovsky and a B-52 taking off on a bombing run&quot;. They were also criticised for being too American and the &quot;poor man&#x27;s Vanilla Fudge&quot;. As Brian Connolly of Sweet recalled, &quot;they were so out of place that you really felt sorry for them.&quot;

By contrast, in the US the band was often introduced as &quot;the English Vanilla Fudge&quot; and massive radio coverage of their songs granted success for both the album and tour. Ian Paice said of their success in the US versus their lack of it back home, &quot;We have been given proper exposure over there. The Americans really know how to push records.&quot;

Decades later, modern critical reviews of the album are generally positive. Bruce Eder of AllMusic considers &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot;, despite some flaws, &quot;a hell of an album&quot; and praises the &quot;infectious ... spirit of fun&quot; of the disc, which has &quot;much more of a &#x27;60s feel than we&#x27;re accustomed to hearing from this band&quot;. Blogcritics contributor David Bowling states that &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot; &quot;was a creative and very good debut album&quot;, which combines &quot;psychedelic music with hard rock and early progressive rock into a pleasant but disjointed whole&quot;. PopMatters review of the three albums of the Mk. I line-up considers them &quot;both respectable and consistent&quot;, although Evans&#x27; voice is &quot;perhaps more suited to heavy pop rather than heavy rock&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described this early incarnation of Deep Purple as a &quot;hard psych band&quot;, more committed to the music than other contemporaries and already capable of creating &quot;a noise that definitetly foretold of things to come.&quot;

In an &quot;Observer Music Monthly&quot; Greatest British Albums poll, keyboard player Rick Wakeman chose &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot; as his favourite British record of all time.

<doc id="1195479" wikidata="Q5451996" url="?curid=1195479" title="Firestone and Ford tire controversy">
<text>The Firestone and Ford tire controversy of the 1990s saw hundreds of people die in automobile crashes caused by the failure of Firestone tires installed on light trucks and SUVs made by Ford Motor Company.

Unusually high failure rates of P235/75R15 ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT tires installed on the first-generation Ford Explorer and similar vehicles caused crashes that killed 238 people and injured around 500 others in the United States alone; more died in other countries.

The revelations halved the market value of Firestone parent company Bridgestone, which fired or accepted the resignation of several executives and closed the Decatur, Illinois, factory where the tires were manufactured. Ford also fired or accepted the resignation of executives. Each company publicly blamed the other for the defects, a disagreement that ended the companies&#x27; nearly 100-year relationship.

Congressional inquiry into the scandal led to the enactment of the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation (TREAD) Act in October 2000.

==Problem detection==
As early as 1996, personal injury lawyers were aware of accidents, injuries, and deaths caused when the tread separated from Firestone tires at high speeds. Lawyers and traffic safety researchers decided not to contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) because they lacked confidence in the agency and feared that an investigation might conclude that there were no defects, thereby compromising existing personal injury lawsuits. All but 13 of the 271 known deaths from these tires took place after 1996.

In 1996, the Arizona state government told Firestone that the treads on its tires were separating in high temperatures. Firestone sent several engineers to inspect the tires and concluded that normal passenger tires were being used in heavy conditions, on dirt roads, off-road, and under heavy loads. Firestone replaced those tires with heavier-duty tires.

As early as 1997, internal Firestone documents showed a rise in injury claims for the ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT tires.

In July 1998, Samuel Boyden, a researcher for State Farm Insurance, received a call from a claims handler asking for information about tread separation in Firestone tires. Boyden subsequently found 21 crashes caused by tread separation and forwarded the information to NHTSA. In 1999, he found an additional 30 cases which he also forwarded to NHTSA.

In 1998, Ford began replacing Firestone tires in Venezuela, where 46 deaths had occurred, according to documents uncovered by Sean Kane, a researcher at Strategic Safety Consulting. Firestone was aware of tire defects in Venezuela as early as 1999.

A Ford dealer in Saudi Arabia noticed high failure rates of Firestone tires in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait starting in 1997 and in July 1999 began replacing Firestone tires on unsold Ford Explorers and to offer a 75% discount for replacement tires when customers came in for maintenance. Ford and Firestone began testing tires in late 1997 or 1998 and began a limited recall in the Middle East, Venezuela, Malaysia, and Thailand in 1999 and the spring of 2000 but did not notify NHTSA.

On February 7, 2000, KHOU-TV in Houston Texas ran a 9-minute story about high-speed Firestone tire failures on Ford Explorers that led to 30 deaths. KHOU was overwhelmed by phone calls from concerned citizens and started directing callers to NHTSA.

In 2000, Clarence Ditlow, executive director for the Center for Auto Safety, told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, &quot;Emerging information shows that both Ford and Firestone had early knowledge of tread separation in Firestone Tires fitted to Ford Explorer vehicles but at no point informed NHTSA of their findings&quot;.

Firestone had more information about tire failures than Ford did because of warranty claims, but Firestone never acted on this information because it always blamed consumers for not maintaining their tires correctly or operating their vehicles in extreme environments, leading to these failures. When Ford and NHTSA looked into concerns about tire failures or rollovers, they consulted consumer complaints to NHTSA&#x27;s toll-free hotline. The consumer complaints did not reflect the size of the problem because attorneys and their clients had almost completely stopped using the hotline to report tire failures or other complaints.

==Investigation and possible causes==
On March 6, 2000, NHTSA began a preliminary inquiry into the high incidence of tire failures and accidents of Ford Explorers and other light trucks and SUVs fitted with Firestone Radial ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness tires. This became a formal investigation on May 2 (PE00020). On August 9, Firestone recalled all ATX and ATX II tires and all Wilderness AT tires manufactured in Decatur. On August 31, 2000, the Office of Defect Investigation (ODI) upgraded the investigation to an Engineering Analysis (EA00023) to determine whether Firestone&#x27;s recall covered all the defective tires.

Ford and Firestone both sent root-cause analyses to NHTSA. Firestone argued that vehicle weight, tire design, low recommended inflation pressure, and lower tire adhesion for tires manufactured at the Decatur factory contributed to the tire failures. Ford argued that the tire design led to higher operating temperatures than similar tires manufactured by Goodyear; that Firestone tires&#x27; relatively small wedge, a strip of rubber between the first and second belts, made them weaker and more failure-prone than comparable Michelin tires; and that there were manufacturing problems at the Decatur factory.

Publicly, Firestone argued that Ford&#x27;s recommended 26 psi inflation pressure should have been 30 psi. Firestone also argued that the Explorer was abnormally dangerous and prone to rollovers after a tire failure, leading to more injuries and deaths. Firestone CEO John Lampe said, &quot;When a driver of a vehicle has something happen such as a tread separation, they should be able to pull over, not rollover.&quot;

Ford argued that the Explorer was no more dangerous than any other SUV and that the accident rate for Explorers with Goodyear tires was far lower than for Explorers with Firestone tires.

Some outside observers argued that both parties were to blame: Firestone&#x27;s tires were prone to tread separation and failure, and the Explorer was especially prone to rolling over if a tire fails at speed compared to other vehicles.

=== Ford Explorer ===

Ford designed the first-generation Explorer by mounting an SUV cabin on a Ford Ranger undercarriage. This cut production costs because Ford could use existing facilities, parts, and robots. But the extra upper cabin weight on the pickup chassis created a vehicle with a higher center of gravity that was more likely to roll over in an accident. It was also more likely to sway during sharp turns because it used the same leaf spring suspension as the Ranger. The likelihood of a crash and likelihood of injuries and death from a crash were greater in an SUV experiencing a tread separation than on a pickup truck.

Ford came up with three options for correcting this problem: use shorter suspension springs to lower the vehicle half an inch in the front and one inch in the back, lower the tire pressure to give the Explorer a more car-like ride, or widen the wheelbase by two inches. After the Explorer rolled over in company pre-production tests, Ford decided to lower the suspension and remove air from the tires to 26 psi compared to 35 psi for the same tires on the Ranger. They did not widen the wheelbase, which would have required a substantial redesign. One consequence of lowering the tire pressure is increased tire temperatures which could lead to a tire failure. Firestone warrantied these tires at 26 psi for 11 years.

First offered for sale in March 1990, the first-generation Explorer had one of the lowest fuel-economy ratings of any SUV sold in the United States, due at least in part to Ford&#x27;s recommended tire pressure. While designing the second-generation Explorer, Ford made two changes to reduce weight and improve fuel economy. First, Ford replaced the Twin I-Beam suspension with a lighter-weight short- and long-arm suspension, but did not lower the engine. This raised the Explorer&#x27;s center of gravity, making it more prone to rolling in an accident or sharp turn. Second, Ford reduced the amount of material in the roof. When the new model went on sale in 1995, it was discovered that this lighter roof was so weak that it would collapse under the weight of an overturned Explorer if the windshield were smashed in, as often happened in rollover accidents.

After Ford Motor Company voluntarily recalled 13 million Firestone tires on May 21, 2001, Firestone requested that NHTSA investigate the handling and safety of Ford Explorers following a tread separation. Firestone argued that the Explorer is poorly designed and exhibits dangerous oversteer in the foreseeable event that a tire fails while driving. Firestone hired a consulting engineer to analyze the performance of the Ford Explorer and other SUVs during a tread separation, this report showed that the Explorer had a greater tendency to oversteer following a tread separation than other SUVs. NHTSA examined this report as well as real-world accident data and data provided by Ford concerning the design of the Explorer and denied Firestone&#x27;s request. NHTSA stated that &quot;[t]he many crashes following tread separations of tires on these vehicles that are documented in the Firestone claims database and that have been reported to ODI by consumers and others demonstrate that such a tire failure can lead to loss of control, particularly when it is a rear tire that fails and the vehicle is being driven at high speed. However, the fact that a vehicle exhibits linear range oversteer characteristics following a rear tire tread separation does not, in itself, indicate that the vehicle contains a safety-related defect. Moreover, the data available to ODI does not indicate that Explorers... are more likely to exhibit linear range oversteer characteristics following a rear tire tread separation than many of their peers.&quot;

The Explorer was redesigned for the 2002 model year. The tire pressure was raised to 30 psi, it was widened by 2.5 inches, the suspension was lowered, and independent rear suspension and electronic stability control were added.

=== Firestone tires ===
The tires that were involved in these accidents were P235/75R15 ATX and ATX II tires and P235/75R15 and P255/70R16 Wilderness AT tires. These tires were installed as OEM equipment on the Ford Explorer, Mercury Mountaineer, Ford Bronco, Ford Ranger, Ford F-series pickup trucks, Mazda B-series pickup trucks, and Mazda Navajo between 1991 and 2000.

ATX tires were originally developed in the late 1980s for use on Ford light trucks and SUVs and were first installed on Ford trucks and SUVs in 1991. The ATX II was designed to improve the ATX&#x27;s ride and the fuel economy of the Explorer. The Explorer had one of the lowest fuel economy ratings for any SUV under production at that time, due at least in part to Ford&#x27;s decision to lower the tire pressure to 26 psi. Ford asked Firestone to reduce the weight of the ATX tires so that it could improve the fuel economy of the Explorer. Firestone created the ATX II by removing material from the tire which lowered the weight by 10%. Removing material from the ATX design also improved the profitability of the tire for Firestone.

The Wilderness AT tire was developed in 1993 and was designed to have better snow handling and &quot;irregular wear targets&quot; and had a different tread design than the ATX tires. The Wilderness AT was sold and installed on Ford trucks from 1996 to 2000 and had a temperature and heat resistance rating of &quot;C&quot; which is the lowest rating allowed by the NHTSA&#x27;s Uniform Tire Quality Grading System. Many of the features of the ATX tires were identical to the Wilderness AT tires. In May 1998 the Wilderness AT tires were redesigned with a thicker belt wedge (see tire design below) although the name of the tire was not changed.

The defective ATX and ATX II tires were primarily manufactured at Firestone&#x27;s Decatur, Illinois factory which produced tires with a significantly higher failure rate than the other two factories that manufactured these same tire models, Wilson, North Carolina and Joliette, Quebec. Wilderness AT tires manufactured before May 1998 had higher failure rates regardless of where they were manufactured and had a safety-related design defect according to NHTSA.

==== Tread separation ====
The failures all involved tread separation where the tire tread peeled off from the body of the tire. Tread separation, due to the interaction of steel and rubber tire elements, has been a challenge in radial tire design since their development by Michelin in 1946.

The failure of the subject tires &quot;begin as belt-edge separation at the edge of the second belt. This is the area of highest strain in a steel-belted radial tire, primarily due to the structural discontinuity created by the abrupt change in modulus from steel to rubber.&quot; Once a tread separation begins it can grow along the circumference of the tire or laterally across the width of the tire leading to cracks that grow between the belts. As separation progressed it could grow to form large crescent-shaped areas along one or both sides of the tire. If those areas grew large enough they could separate catastrophically, especially at high speeds where the separation was aided by the centrifugal force of the spinning tire.

Vehicles with tread-separating tires were difficult to control especially when the failing tire was on a rear wheel and when the vehicle was moving fast.

A vehicle with a tread-separating rear tire will pull towards the side of the vehicle with the failed tire. The longer it takes the tread to separate the more the vehicle pulls in that direction. While the tread is separating the vehicle will oversteer while the tread-separating tire is on the outside of a turn. Once the tread separation has completed the vehicle will cease pulling in any direction.

Tread separations for Firestone ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT tires were significantly worse than for comparable tires manufactured by other companies including the Goodyear Wrangler RT/S which was also installed on new Ford Explorers.

The tread-separating tire was most frequently the left-rear wheel of the vehicle. Reasons suggested include additional heat from the exhaust, higher weight on the driver&#x27;s side because vehicles are often driven without any passengers or higher temperatures in the middle of the road than on the shoulders.

==== Causes ====
There were several primary causes for the tread separations: tire age, manufacturing facility, operating temperature, tire design, as well as labor and management problems in Bridgestone/Firestone and at the Decatur, Illinois factory.

===== Tire age =====
The belt wedge and skim rubber compounds change as they age. Skim rubber is a thin strip of rubber sandwiched between the inner and outer belts and the belt wedge is a thin strip of rubber installed along the outer edge of the tire between the two steel belts and in the area of highest stress on the tire. These changes reduce the ability of the tire to resist crack growth and belt separation. Most of the tread separations occurred on tires that had been in service for at least three years. ATX and Wilderness AT tires manufactured in Decatur started to fail between one and two years after production, but between two and three years for tires from Wilson and between three and four years for tires from Joliette. Tire aging for Wilderness AT tires, regardless of the factory that produced them, was similar to other tires manufactured at Decatur and was worse than comparable tires manufactured by Goodyear.

===== Manufacturing facility =====

The failure rates for ATX and ATX II tires manufactured at the Decatur, Illinois, factory were higher than for the other factories that also manufactured these same tire models, Wilson, North Carolina, and Joliette, Quebec. Tires manufactured in Decatur had &quot;reduced fracture resistance&quot; compared to tires manufactured at Joliette or Wilson. That is, once a crack formed within the tire, the crack would spread more readily than on comparable tires from the Joliette or Wilson factories. Researchers also tested belt adhesion strength by measuring the force that it would take to peel a strip of the second belt from the rest of the tire. ATX and ATX II tires manufactured at Decatur had lower belt adhesion strength than the same tires manufactured at Joliette or Wilson.

The only manufacturing difference in the Decatur factory was in &quot;the early material mixing stages which results in the production of materials with differing weight percentages of processing lubricant.&quot; However, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that this would weaken a tire or lead to a premature failure.

===== Operating temperature =====
A tire&#x27;s operating temperature will increase with higher vehicle load, speed, air temperature, and with lower tire inflation pressure. The combination of inflation pressure, speed, and vehicle load could increase the tire temperature as much as above the ambient air temperature. Higher operating temperatures will increase the rate of oxidative aging. Tires that were used in southern climates were less ductile and stiffer than tires that operated in northern climates. Tires in warmer climates also showed higher levels of cure and had somewhat lower peel strength. The role of air temperature would explain why geographic regions with higher air temperatures had the highest tire failure rates. These results held up even for tires that had zero percent tread wear.

Higher vehicle loads increased belt crack growth rates. Of the four factors involved in the growth of cracks in the tires, vehicle load was the single most important factor.

The Explorer weighs more than the Ford Ranger and has a higher Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) while also having a lower recommended tire pressure. This difference in weight and tire pressure explains why Ford Explorers had far more tire failures than Ford Rangers even though they used the same tire models. Despite these differences, investigators were concerned that Ford Rangers would also see an increase in tire failures if those tires were not recalled.

===== Tire design =====
Before May 1998, the belt wedge gauge for ATX and Wilderness AT tires was less than for comparable tires from other manufacturers. The wedge gauge on completed tires was also less than Firestone&#x27;s minimum standards. The wedge on these tires was not large enough to resist crack formation and growth. The design of the belt wedge changed in May 1998 making it larger and comparable in size to tires manufactured by other companies.

On Wilderness AT tires, the inter-belt gauge, or a strip of rubber between the two steel belts, was often thinner than Firestone&#x27;s minimum specification and the design was thinner than comparable tires from other manufacturers.

The design of the shoulder pocket, a &quot;cavity between the heavy ribs, or lugs, along the shoulders of the tire&quot; on the Wilderness AT tires, could lead to high stresses along the tire edge, allowing cracks to form in the belt wedge.

Peel adhesion tests, where a strip of the second belt was pulled off the body of the tire, showed that Wilderness AT tires were weaker than similar tire models manufactured by other companies. Wilderness AT tires were comparable in strength to tires manufactured at the Decatur, Illinois factory, regardless of which factory the Wilderness AT were manufactured in.

Wilderness AT tires had similar shearography results regardless of which factory produced them. Cracks and separations were more frequent than similar tires produced by other manufacturers.

In 2000, Firestone added a nylon cap to reduce the problem of tread separation in all of its tire models installed on SUVs.

===== Labor and management problems =====
Bridgestone purchased Firestone in 1988 to compete with other large multinational tire companies and took on a considerable amount of debt to complete the purchase and upgrade Firestone&#x27;s manufacturing facilities. At that time Firestone was losing a considerable amount of money each year which put a drain on Bridgestone&#x27;s profits. Bridgestone pressured Firestone to cut manufacturing and labor costs to improve revenues. Critics and workers claim that this led Firestone to cut corners on production and to allow substandard tires to pass inspection that should have been rejected. This also led Firestone to pressure workers to accept new labor contracts that reduced pay and benefits and increased the hours that its factories were operating.

In a deposition retired Firestone workers testified that quality control problems at the Decatur factory could have led workers to manufacture defective tires. One worker stated that, despite getting a company discount, he&#x27;d stopped purchasing Firestone tires years before the crisis developed because of quality control problems. Others stated that they had to inspect as many as 100 tires per hour which they believed were far too many tires to do an adequate job; that they were told to sign off on tires that they did not actually inspect; that they rolled unvulcanized tire carcasses, also called a &quot;green tire&quot;, across the factory floor which could allow debris from the floor to end up inside a completed tire; that they used an awl to puncture bubbles in tires; and that they were told to use a solvent similar to benzene on tire adhesives that had lost its tack from sitting too long in a humid factory. Organic solvents are commonly used in the tire industry as an ingredient in adhesives used to bond rubber components together. Industry observers, lawyers and workers claimed that too much of the solvent could damage the rubber in a tire and could lead to premature tire failures. Firestone claimed that these were disgruntled workers who quit after a bitter strike. &quot;The comments of these former employees should be evaluated with a critical eye, given that they were carefully selected out of the thousands of current and former employees of the Decatur plant by plaintiffs&#x27; personal injury lawyers.&quot;

Yoichiro Kaizaki, CEO and president of Bridgestone, stated that there were two different standards for quality control within Bridgestone. If a problem developed in a Bridgestone factory, &quot;our technology staff would rush to the site [overseas]. But if a problem arose with a Firestone tire, they wouldn&#x27;t do anything.&quot; &quot;We let the U.S. unit use its own culture. There was an element of mistake in that.&quot;

===== United Rubber Workers strike =====
The tires that failed were primarily manufactured at Firestone&#x27;s Decatur, Illinois, factory during a time of labor unrest and a strike against Firestone carried out by the United Rubber Workers (URW) and the United Steel Workers (USW).

In January 1994, Firestone and the URW entered into new contract negotiations. Firestone demanded considerable concessions from the union. These concessions included switching from an 8-hour workday to 12-hour alternating shifts so the factory could remain in operation 24 hours a day, a pay cut by 30 percent for new hires, a seven-day workweek instead of five days, hourly workers would contribute to their healthcare plan, a switch from a piece-rate system to a performance based system, and senior workers were to lose two weeks of vacation time.

By April 1994, the existing labor contract ended and workers continued to work at the factory until the URW called a general strike in July at Decatur and four other Firestone facilities. Almost immediately Firestone began hiring replacement workers at all their facilities and by January 1995 Firestone had hired 2,300 replacement workers who were paid thirty percent less. Over time union workers started to cross the picket line and by May 1995 there were 1,048 replacement workers and 371 permanent workers at Decatur. At that time the URW voted to unconditionally end the strike to block Firestone from hiring even more replacement workers and then holding a union decertification election. While the strike ended the labor negotiations continued. In July 1995 the URW had run out of money and was absorbed by the USW. During the time period from May 1995 and December 1996 union workers worked alongside non-union replacements. Labor negotiations between Firestone and the USW continued but many union workers could not return to work because their jobs had been replaced. The union described that time period as &quot;brutal.&quot; The USW continued to negotiate specifically trying to get Firestone to allow all union workers to return to their jobs. In December 1996, the USW finally reached an agreement and all union workers were allowed to return to work.

Tires with the highest rates of failure were manufactured in the months right before the union went on strike but after labor negotiations had begun, and later after union workers began to cross the picket line and work without a contract alongside replacement workers. Other Firestone factories (Joliette, Quebec and Wilson, North Carolina) also produced the same tire models but had far lower failure rates. Failure rates at the Decatur plant before the labor negotiations began, while the replacement workers worked without union workers, and after the labor negotiations ended, were comparable to the failure rate of tires manufactured at the Joliette and Wilson plants.

Other studies have found that labor unrest reduces the quality of work by union members, suggesting that there should be additional inspections and heightened scrutiny by regulators during strikes.

==Recall==
On August 17, 1999, Ford in Saudi Arabia began replacing Firestone tires on unsold Ford Explorers and to offer steep discounts on replacement tires to customers who returned to Ford dealers for regular maintenance. While this was not officially a recall Ford still replaced Firestone tires on 6,800 Ford Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers.

In February 2000, Ford began to recall Firestone tires in Malaysia and Thailand.

In May 2000, Ford recalled 150,000 Firestone tires on Explorers in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. In August 2000 Bridgestone/Firestone issued a recall in Venezuela of 62,000 Venezuelan made Firestone tires. The recall was estimated to cost $6 million.

On August 9, 2000, Firestone issued a recall covering 6.5 million P235/75R15 Firestone ATX and ATX II tires and P235/75R15 Wilderness AT tires manufactured after 1991 and 1996 respectively. The recall covered all ATX and ATX II tires regardless of which plant they originated from but only covered Wilderness AT tires from Firestone&#x27;s Decatur plant. Firestone had produced 14.4 million tires that were covered by this recall but it was estimated that only 6.5 million remained in service. Wilderness AT tires manufactured in Joliette, Quebec and Wilson, North Carolina were not included in the recall. On August 21, 2000, Ford halted production at three truck assembly plants so that 70,000 tires could be diverted towards the recall effort. P235/75R15 tires became scarce and Ford authorized dealers to install replacement tires from companies other than Firestone. Both Ford and Firestone looked for replacement tires internationally.

On May 22, 2001, Ford announced a voluntary recall of all Wilderness AT tires of 15, 16, and 17 inches installed on all Ford trucks and SUVs. This covered an additional 13 million Firestone tires and cost Ford $3 billion.

On October 4, 2001, NHTSA issued a mandatory recall of 3.5 million P235/75R15 and P255/70R16 Wilderness AT tires manufactured prior to May 1998 that were assembled in either the Joliette, Quebec or Wilson, North Carolina factories. This recall removed all remaining Wilderness AT tires that were manufactured prior to May, 1998. NHTSA concluded that the rubber wedge between the outer edge of the two belts was not thick enough on Wilderness AT tires and not strong enough to resist crack formation and growth. Wilderness AT tires manufactured after May 1998 had a thicker wedge making them more robust.

In November 2013, two recalled Wilderness AT tires were found in Atlanta, Georgia. One of the tires was offered for sale as new at a used tire retail shop.

==Fallout==

=== Injuries and fatalities ===
As of September 2001, NHTSA had reported that 271 people were killed, and more than 500 people were injured in the United States as a result of tire failures. Of the Firestone models under investigation, 192 fatalities could be attributed to tread separation, and 33 fatalities could be attributed to blowouts. 33 fatalities were caused by unknown tire failure modes. The large majority of accidents took place in California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida. An additional 46 people were killed in Venezuela.

=== Lawsuits ===
Many lawsuits were filed against both Ford and Firestone. The outcomes of most lawsuits were kept confidential, but one attorney estimated that Ford settled 1,500 cases regarding the safety of the Explorer. Ford&#x27;s own financial statements indicate that it spent $590 million to settle personal injury and class action lawsuits. Firestone set aside $800 million to handle lawsuits related to the recalled tires.

By February 2000, when KHOU-TV in Texas ran a story about tire failures on Ford Explorers, Firestone had recorded 193 personal injury claims, 2,288 property damage claims, and was a defendant in 66 lawsuits. In 2000 Firestone was served with 413 individual lawsuits in state and federal courts. By July 2002 Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone had settled more than 600 cases. By late 2003 Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford had settled 1,300 cases.

In November 2001, Firestone agreed to pay $41.5 million to end state lawsuits against Firestone. In 2003, Firestone settled a class action lawsuit by agreeing to pay $15.5 million for consumer education focusing on tire safety and $19 million in legal fees and $2,500 each to 45 plaintiffs. In 2005 Firestone paid Ford $240 million to settle claims related to the recall.

Ford and Firestone worked to settle cases out of court to avoid punitive damages and were paying between $4 million and $8 million to settle cases involving fatalities and between $12 million to $16 million to settle cases of paralysis.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that both Ford and Firestone knew of the dangers but did nothing, and that Ford knew that the Explorer was highly prone to rollovers. Firestone argued that Ford&#x27;s recommended inflation pressure of 26 psi was too low and should have been 30 psi, and that the Explorer was an especially dangerous vehicle prone to rollovers.

=== Congressional investigation ===
Congress began hearings in September 2000 to find out why it took so long for NHTSA to discover these tire defects and why Ford and Firestone were aware of tire failures as early as 1996 but never reported the information to NHTSA. The investigation led Congress to pass the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act or TREAD Act on October 11, 2000 which was signed into law on November 1.

=== Ford/Firestone corporate relations ===
Relations between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone deteriorated after NHTSA began investigating the tire failures in May 2000. Ford first accused Firestone of withholding data that Ford needed to determine which tires might be unsafe. Firestone then accused Ford of withholding safety data concerning the design of the Explorer. After Firestone agreed to the initial recall of 14.4 million tires on August 9, 2000, NHTSA continued to push Firestone to recall all ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT tires regardless of where they were manufactured. Ford executives were concerned that NHTSA might decide that the Wilderness AT tires would not meet future safety standards and decided to recall these tires on their own. Before Ford could publicly announce this decision John T. Lampe (Chairman &amp; CEO of Bridgestone/Firestone) announced on May 21, 2001 in a public letter to Jacques Nasser (Ford Motor Company chief executive) that Bridgestone/Firestone would no longer enter into new contracts with Ford Motor Company, effectively ending a 100-year supply relationship. The letter included accusations that the Ford Explorer was unsafe and called on NHTSA to investigate design flaws in the SUV. On May 22, 2001, angry that Firestone would not expand the recall, Jacques Nasser at Ford announced a voluntary recall of all Wilderness AT tires that were not subject to the original recall.

===Corporate firings and resignations===
The chairman and CEO of Bridgestone/Firestone, Masatoshi Ono, resigned in October 2000 and was replaced by John Lampe. In January 2001, the CEO and president of Bridgestone, Yoichiro Kaizaki, resigned and was replaced by Shigeo Watanabe. The bitter public fight between Ford and Firestone was also a contributing factor in Ford&#x27;s decision to fire Jacques Nasser in November 2001. Nasser was replaced by William Clay Ford, Jr., the great-grandson of Henry Ford, and Harvey S. Firestone, the founder of Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.

=== Firestone&#x27;s Decatur plant ===
Firestone&#x27;s Decatur plant was closed in December 2001 and all 1,500 employees were laid off. Firestone cited a decline in consumer demand for Firestone tires and the age of the Decatur plant as the reasons for closing that facility. It is estimated that closing the Decatur plant cost Bridgestone/Firestone $210 million.

=== Financial cost ===
It is estimated that these tire failures and rollovers cost Bridgestone/Firestone $1.67 billion and Ford Motor Company $530 million. Bridgestone&#x27;s market price dropped by 50% and the resulting restructuring cost Bridgestone $2 billion. In 2001, Ford recorded a loss of $5.5 billion.

<doc id="1195484" wikidata="Q979559" url="?curid=1195484" title="Honda Ballade">
<text>The is a subcompact automobile built by Honda of Japan. It began as a four-door higher equipment content version of the Civic in 1980. The Ballade was developed at the same time the Honda Vigor appeared, which was a higher content Honda Accord. In Japan, the Ballade was sold exclusively at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; dealerships alongside the Vigor, Prelude, CR-X, and Quint. In the UK it was launched at the same time as the very similar Triumph Acclaim with which it shared a Honda-built engine.

== History ==

The name of the car was taken from &quot;ballade&quot;, the French word for a ballad. Because both the four-door Ballade sedan and the five-door hatchback Quintet were both high luxury content vehicles derived from the Honda Civic, the Ballade represented a type of music, and the Quintet represented a musical group. The Ballade competed in Japan with the Toyota Sprinter, and the Nissan Laurel Spirit as the Civic competed with the Corolla, and the Sunny.

It was launched in September 1980, nine months after the agreement between Honda and British Leyland to produce their own versions of the car and work on future cars together. Although the original Ballade was never sold in Europe, British Leyland produced its own version of the Ballade - the Triumph Acclaim - from 1981 to 1984. In North America the Ballade nameplate was never used, the model instead being sold as the Civic Sedan.

A second generation Ballade from 1985 shared most of its body panels with the Civic, except for a sportier front end, and formed the basis of the CR-X sports car and the Rover 200. The top model - the EX-i - featured a 1.5L naturally aspirated 12-valve all-aluminium engine with multi-point fuel injection (using Honda&#x27;s PGM-FI system) developing , the same engine was used in the CR-X. Other features of the EX-i included electric windows all-round, electric and heated wing mirrors, metallic paint, vented front disc brakes and hydraulic power-assisted steering. Lower specification models featured the same 1.5L engine but with fueling provided via a carburetor, producing .

In keeping with the styling trend shared with other &quot;Honda Verno&quot; products, the second generation car adopted partially concealed headlights starting in 1983, shared with the Vigor, Quint Integra, Ballade Sports CR-X, and the Prelude.

The Ballade in Japan was replaced in September 1987, with the Honda Concerto 5-door hatchback and sedan as the luxury Civic offering at newly established &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealerships in Japan. As the Ballade was essentially a luxury version of the Civic sedan, Honda repositioned the Ballade from &quot;Honda Verno&quot;, first with the Concerto name, then renamed again as the Honda Domani at &quot;Honda Clio&quot;, and introduced it with the Honda Accord, the Honda Inspire, and the Honda Legend in 1992, with the Civic now headlining at &quot;Honda Primo&quot; stores. The sport-oriented version of the Civic loosely held by the Ballade evolved into the Honda Integra in 1985, and assumed the market position originally held by the Ballade at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; dealership locations.

In South Africa, the nameplate was revived in 2011 for the Honda City sold in other markets.

In 1996 the Ballade and Civic got a facelift with a total of 12 changes. Honda &amp; Colt(Mitsubishi) Division of Mercedes-Benz of South Africa marketing manager Guy Franken says: &quot;With a total 12 derivatives in the range we believe that we have the entire small/intermediate car market covered and offer value in performance, specification, safety and affordability.&quot;

These changes include:

D-series engines and B-series engines

== Ballade (South Africa) reintroduction ==

The Ballade name continued to be used for a Civic-based model in South Africa, where it was used instead of Civic on locally produced versions until 2001. South African Ballades were assembled by the local subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, which wanted to market a smaller and cheaper car in addition to its Mercedes-Benz models. The Ballade name was adopted because it was perceived to have more luxury and upmarket connotations than the Civic name. This was important because the Ballade was sold through the Mercedes-Benz dealership channel.

Since March 2011, the City is sold as the Ballade in South Africa.

<doc id="1195488" wikidata="Q2715189" url="?curid=1195488" title="Jane's Addiction (album)">
<text>Jane&#x27;s Addiction is a live album by American rock band Jane&#x27;s Addiction, released on May 15, 1987. Its basic tracks were recorded live at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles on January 26, 1987, with additional overdubs and corrections recorded at The Edge Studio in Los Angeles. An audience applause dub from a Los Lobos concert was overlaid onto the final mix.

== Music ==
The basic tracks were recorded live over a single night in Los Angeles, with additional in-studio recording and overdubs done later. Several songs would be rerecorded for other releases. Of the band-written songs, only &quot;Trip Away&quot;, &quot;1%&quot;, &quot;I Would for You&quot;, and &quot;My Time&quot; have not been rerecorded and rereleased. (A demo of &quot;I Would For You&quot; was released on the 1991 compilation &quot;Live and Rare&quot;; however, this was recorded in 1986, predating the &quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; album.)

Of the original recording, Perry Farrell recalled: &quot;There was a lot of heat in that room. Heat from brains and bodies that were fully charged up. I knew it was important to speak to the artisans, but I really felt I was addressing the powers that be, too.&quot;

&quot;Jane Says&quot; and &quot;Pigs in Zen&quot; were rerecorded for &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;, the band&#x27;s major label debut. &quot;Whores&quot; and &quot;Chip Away&quot; were rerecorded in 2009 by the reunited Jane&#x27;s Addiction for the &quot;NINJA EP&quot;, a collaboration with Nine Inch Nails to promote the joint NINJA tour.

The album included two covers: &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; by The Velvet Underground, and &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; by The Rolling Stones, the latter retitled &quot;Sympathy&quot;.

At least one other song, &quot;Slow Divers&quot;, was recorded for the album but left off for unknown reasons. &quot;Slow Divers&quot; would eventually be released ten years later on the band&#x27;s 1997 outtake/alternate/live/new compilation &quot;Kettle Whistle&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Here is proof that Jane&#x27;s Addiction surpassed puberty before they came of age&quot;, wrote Nick Griffiths in a review of a CD reissue for &quot;Select&quot;. &quot;&quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; is sex, obsession, tortured-soul food – a rape of the senses. It&#x27;s no Immaculate Conception, but it&#x27;s immaculate.&quot;

== Packaging ==
&quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; has a large number of packaging variations. There are at least four distinct variations of the CD artwork, and seven variations of the vinyl.

The variations all deal with disc color and art; the album cover and liner notes remain consistent across all variations in most cases. The very first CD pressing of the album, which is just a standard silver disc with track names and other info in black typeface, contains a typo in the track list on the disc itself; &quot;Pigs in Zen&quot; is listed as &quot;Pigs in Ten&quot;. This typo was corrected on all subsequent pressings.

Later versions of the CD album include a blue colored disc with rounded, stylized text for the track list as well as a version that has the actual cover artwork silkscreened on the disc itself.

<text>Harry Alistair Ellis (born 17 May 1982) is an English former rugby union footballer who played scrum half for Leicester Tigers, England and the British &amp; Irish Lions.

In July 2010, Ellis announced his retirement from the game as a result of a persistent knee injury. He now works at his former school, Leicester Grammar School, teaching PE to A-Level and GCSE students, and contributing to the coaching of its 1st XV and other sporting teams.

==Club career==

Ellis first played rugby union as a 6-year-old with the South Leicester club. He studied at Bushloe High School and later Leicester Grammar School, where he represented Leicester Schools and the Midlands at every age level. He also became a teacher for a short period of time.

He spent a year with the Wigston club South Leicester RUFC before he finally joined the Leicester Tigers Academy where he combined playing with further education at De Montfort University. He worked his way through the Tigers lower teams and continued his representative career, playing for both the England U19 and U21 sides. He has also featured in the England Sevens squad along with his teammate Louis Deacon.

In August 2001, he made his first team Tigers debut in the Orange Cup game in Toulouse. In Leicester&#x27;s 2002 Heineken Cup quarter final, Ellis scored the only try of the game, breaking away from a ruck and sliding over on the wet ground. Ellis went on to score a superb individual try that helped defeat Llanelli in the Heineken Cup semi-final at Nottingham. In the final itself Ellis came on as a replacement as Leicester emerged victorious. He was named Tigers&#x27; Players Young Player of the Year for the 2001–2 season.

He finally established himself as a regular in the No. 9 spot during the 2003–04 season, making 19 appearances and helping Tigers come back from a poor start and a turbulent mid-season to reach the Zurich Wild Card final.

Ellis suffered knee ligament damage against Bristol on 5 May 2007 in the Guinness Premiership semi-final play-off. He played an influential role in the Tigers&#x27; domestic double success, but the injury meant him missing out on the Premiership and Heineken Cup finals.

The Heineken Cup semi-final against Cardiff Blues resulted in a historic sudden death kicking competition. The shoot-out ended before Ellis&#x27;s turn came up – though it was a close run thing, as either he or Tom Croft were to follow Jordan Crane. Although the Tigers fell at the final hurdle of the Heineken Cup, they won the 2008–09 Guinness Premiership final, which Ellis did not feature in but was an unused replacement.

Ellis started the 2009/10 season as first-choice scrum-half for Leicester, but suffered an injury in training, which left him out of the game for a significant part of the season. He returned to play in the Guinness A league, and helped the Tigers A team to victory.

His last game for the senior side came against Northampton Saints in the LV= Cup.

==International career==

Ellis played for the England A, Under 16 Group and Under 18 Group schools sides. In fact, he played for the England Under 18 side when he was only 16.

Ellis was selected on England&#x27;s 2004 summer tour as third choice scrum half behind Matt Dawson and Andy Gomarsall and did not play, however he made his England debut from the bench in their 32–16 win over the Springboks in autumn 2004. He also made an appearance as a replacement in the game against Australia.

He subsequently became a regular fixture in the England side, rotating with Matt Dawson during the 2005 Six Nations. Ellis scored his debut try for England in the 2005 Calcutta Cup win over Scotland. He lost out to Matt Dawson for the opening two Autumn tests in 2005 but took his chance superbly against Samoa, scoring an outstanding solo try in what was comfortably his best test match performance. This helped secured him the no 9 shirt for four games of the 2006 6 Nations.

He was left out of the Summer development tour to Australia, but was chosen again for the Elite Player England Squad for the 2006/2007 season. Ellis was not included in the 2006 Autumn internationals that saw England head coach Andy Robinson lose his job, but when Brian Ashton was appointed as his successor Ellis was named in the team to start England&#x27;s 2007 Six Nations opener against Scotland. In this game Ellis came of age and it was arguably one of his best performances in an England shirt. He consistently retained his place throughout the 2007 Six Nations, starting in every game and scoring a try in the loss to Wales.

Ellis was ruled out of the 2007 Rugby World Cup due to the knee injury suffered in the Premiership.

He had a very successful 2009 Six Nations tournament, starting for England as a result of the ankle injury to Danny Care, and went on to score two tries in a man-of-the-match performance against , where his opposite number was, unusually, Mauro Bergamasco. He started all subsequent Six Nations matches, where he played scrum-half to former teammate Andy Goode, and then current teammate Toby Flood&#x27;s fly-half. His last game for England came in the Calcutta Cup win over .

He was picked for the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour, where he played as a substitute in the final Test win against the Springboks in Ellis Park.

<text>Brent Spar, known as Brent &quot;E&quot;, was a North Sea oil storage and tanker loading buoy in the Brent oilfield, operated by Shell UK. With the completion of a pipeline connection to the oil terminal at Sullom Voe in Shetland, the storage facility had continued in use, but by 1991, was considered to be of no further value. Brent Spar became an issue of public concern in 1995, when the British government announced its support for Shell&#x27;s application for its disposal in deep Atlantic waters at North Feni Ridge (approximately from the west coast of Scotland, at a depth of around ).

Greenpeace organized a worldwide, high-profile media campaign against this plan occupying Brent Spar for more than three weeks. In the face of public and political opposition in northern Europe (including a widespread boycott of Shell service stations, some physical attacks and an arson attack on a service station in Germany), Shell abandoned its plans to dispose of Brent Spar at sea  — whilst continuing to stand by its claim that this was the safest option, both from an environmental and an industrial health and safety perspective. Greenpeace&#x27;s own reputation also suffered during the campaign, when it had to acknowledge that its assessment of the oil remaining in Brent Spar&#x27;s storage tanks had been grossly overestimated. Following Shell&#x27;s decision to pursue only on-shore disposal options, as favoured by Greenpeace and its supporters, Brent Spar was given temporary moorings in a Norwegian fjord. In January 1998, Shell announced its decision to re-use much of the main structure in the construction of new harbour facilities near Stavanger, Norway.

==Technical information==
Brent &quot;E&quot; was a floating oil storage facility constructed in 1976 and moored approximately from the Brent &quot;A&quot; oil rig. It was jointly owned by Shell and Esso, and operated wholly by Shell, which gave them responsibility for decommissioning the structure. Brent Spar was high and in diameter, and displaced 66,000 tonnes. The draft of the platform was such that manoeuvring in the North Sea south of Orkney was not possible. The storage tank section had a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil. This section was built from thick steel plate, reinforced by ribs and cross-braces. It was known that this section had been stressed and damaged on installation. This led to doubts on whether the facility would retain its structural integrity if it was re-floated into a horizontal position.

Shell based its decommissioning decisions on estimates of the quantities of various pollutants, including PCBs, crude oil, heavy metals, and scale, which it had calculated based on the operating activities of the platform, and metal that would remain in the structure after decommissioning. &quot;Scale&quot; is a by-product of oil production and, because of the radioactivity found in the rocks from which the oil is extracted, is considered to be low-level radioactive waste. It is regularly dealt with on-shore by workers wearing breathing masks to prevent inhalation of dust.

==Disposal options==
Shell examined a number of options for disposing of the Brent Spar, and took two of these forward for serious consideration.

===On-shore dismantling===
The first option involved towing the Brent Spar to a shallow water harbour to decontaminate it and reuse the materials used in its construction. Any unusable waste could be disposed of on land. Technically, this option was more complex and presented a greater hazard to the workforce. This option was estimated to cost £41M. There was some concern that the facility would disintegrate in shallow coastal water, having a much more economically and environmentally significant effect.

===Deep sea disposal===
The second option involved towing the decommissioned platform into deep water in the North Atlantic, positioning explosives around the waterline, then detonating them, in order to breach the hull and sink the platform. The facility would then fall to the seabed and release its contents over a restricted area. Due to the uncertainty associated with detonating explosives, a number of possible scenarios were envisaged. First, the structure would fall to the seabed in one piece, releasing its contaminants slowly, and affecting the seabed for around &quot;down-current&quot;. Second, the structure might disintegrate as it fell through the water column. This would release contaminants in a single burst, and have an effect for &quot;down current&quot; of the final resting place, although this would last for a shorter time than in the first instance. Third, the structure could fail catastrophically when the explosives detonated, releasing its contaminants into the surface waters. This would affect sea birds and the fishing industry in that area. The cost of this option was estimated at between £17M and £20M.

Shell proposed that deep sea disposal was the best option for Brent Spar, arguing that their decision had been made on sound scientific principles and data. Dismantling the platform on-shore was more complex from an engineering point of view than disposal at sea. Shell also cited the lower risk to the health and safety of the workforce with deep sea disposal. Environmentally, Shell considered that sinking would have only a localised effect in a remote deep sea region which had little resource value. It was considered that this option would be acceptable to the public, to Her Majesty&#x27;s Government and to regional authorities. Shell acknowledged that sinking the Brent Spar at sea was also the cheaper option.

Having decided on a preferred method of disposal, Shell contracted Fisheries Research Services (FRS) to investigate possible sites for sinking the facility. There were two stipulations to this search: firstly, that the site was within the UK exclusive economic zone,and secondly, that the site be deep enough that the sunken buoy would present no hazard to shipping. FRS identified three sites as squares, which were considered suitable; the Maury Channel, the North Feni Ridge and the Rockall Trough.

At these three sites, FRS carried out:
* seabed visualisation surveys using a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) to confirm the topography in each area
* sediment sample collection using a box core sampler to analyse for heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), oil-related hydrocarbons and radionuclides
* investigations into particle size distribution, and total organic carbon levels of the sediment
* box core sampling to count the numbers of animals living in the sediment of the seabed
* beam trawl sampling to determine the different animals living on the seabed

The North Feni Ridge was found to include a narrow channel. The Rockall Trough area was found to be a gently sloping basin between the Anton Dohrn Seamount and the Wyville-Thomsom Ridge. The Maury Channel area was found to be a flat, gently sloping area.

Infaunal communities were found to be high in diversity and low in abundance, characteristic of unimpacted sediments. These communities were thought to have a limited food supply, which is also normal in deep water communities.

The final conclusions of FRS were that abundance and diversity were greater than had been expected, especially in the North Feni Ridge area, however the limited extent of sampling precluded detailed analysis of data for the entire area. On the basis of the data which FRS gathered, there was little to choose between the three potential disposal areas. Analysis of the North Feni Ridge area may indicate that this area may have been accumulative, but that this would not preclude deep-sea disposal of the platform.

Having received these conclusions, Shell opted for the North Feni Ridge site, and applied to the British government for a licence to dispose of the rig at sea. This was approved in December 1994.

==Greenpeace involvement==
Greenpeace became aware of the plan to sink the Brent Spar at sea on 16 February 1995. The organization had been campaigning against ocean dumping in the North Sea since the early 1980s, monitoring the dumping of radioactive waste and waste from titanium dioxide production and on occasion using high-seas civil disobedience tactics to physically hinder the perpetrators, and lobbying for a comprehensive ban on ocean dumping through the OSPAR convention.

Greenpeace objected to the plan to dispose of the Brent Spar at sea on a number of issues:

# That there was a lack of understanding of the deep sea environment, and therefore no way to predict the effects of the proposed dumping on deep sea ecosystems.
# The documents which supported Shell&#x27;s licence application were &quot;highly conjectural in nature&quot;, containing unsubstantiated assumptions, minimal data and extrapolations from unnamed studies.
# That dumping the Brent Spar at sea would create a precedent for dumping other contaminated structures in the sea and would undermine current international agreements. The environmental effects of further dumping would be cumulative.
# Dismantling of the Brent Spar was technically feasible and offshore engineering firms believed they could do it safely and effectively. The necessary facilities were already routinely in use and decommissioning of many other oil installations had already been carried out elsewhere in the world.
# To protect the environment, the principle of minimizing the generation of wastes should be upheld and harmful materials always recycled, treated or contained.

Greenpeace claimed that the scientific arguments for ocean dumping were being used as a way of disguising Shell&#x27;s primary aim, which was to cut costs.

==The &quot;battle&quot; of Brent Spar==
Four Greenpeace activists first occupied Brent Spar on 30 April 1995. In total, 25 activists, photographers and journalists were involved in this stage of occupation. They decided to cover up the Exxon logos on the platform. At this time, activists collected a sample of the contents of the Spar and sent it for testing, to determine the nature of the pollutants which the platform contained. This sample was collected incorrectly, leading to a large overestimate in the contents of the facility. Although Greenpeace quoted Shell&#x27;s own estimate of the amount of heavy metals and other chemicals on board, they also claimed there were more than 5,500 tonnes of oil on the Spar – while Shell&#x27;s estimate was 50 tonnes. For context, the Exxon Valdez oil spill involved around 42,000 tonnes.

Greenpeace mounted an energetic media campaign that influenced public opinion against Shell&#x27;s preferred option. It disputed Shell&#x27;s estimates of the contaminants on the Brent Spar, saying that these were much more than initially estimated. On 9 May, the German government issued a formal objection to the British government, with respect to the dumping plan. On 23 May, after several attempts, Shell obtained legal permission to evict the Greenpeace protesters from the Brent Spar, and they were eventually taken by helicopter to Aberdeen, Scotland, where they held a press conference.

Towing of the platform to its final position began on 11 June. By this time, the call for a boycott of Shell products was being heeded across much of continental northern Europe, damaging Shell&#x27;s profitability as well as brand image. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl protested to the British Prime Minister, John Major at a G7 conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Support from within the oil industry was not unanimous. Although oil production companies supported Shell&#x27;s position, influential companies in the offshore construction sector stood to make money from onshore dismantling if a precedent could be set, and consequently supported the Greenpeace point of view.

On 20 June, Shell had decided that their position was no longer tenable, and withdrew their plan to sink the Brent Spar. They released the following statement:

&quot;Shell&#x27;s position as a major European enterprise has become untenable. The Spar had gained a symbolic significance out of all proportion to its environmental effect. In consequence, Shell companies were faced with increasingly intense public criticism, mostly in Continental northern Europe. Many politicians and ministers were openly hostile and several called for consumer boycotts. There was violence against Shell service stations, accompanied by threats to Shell staff.&quot;
In early July, the Norwegian government gave Shell permission to mothball the Brent Spar in Erfjord. It remained there for several years while other options for disposal were considered.

==Aftermath==

Having moored the Brent Spar in Erfjord, Shell commissioned the independent Norwegian consultancy Det Norske Veritas (DNV) to conduct an audit of Spar&#x27;s contents and investigate Greenpeace&#x27;s allegations. Greenpeace admitted that its claims that the Spar contained 5500 tonnes of oil were inaccurate and apologized to Shell on 5 September. This preempted the publication of DNV&#x27;s report, which endorsed Shell&#x27;s initial estimates for many pollutants. Greenpeace noted that its opposition to the dumping had never been solely based on the presence or absence of oil, however, and that opposition to the disposal plan was part of a larger campaign opposing the dumping of all waste into the North Sea.

Shell received over 200 individual suggestions for what could be done with the Brent Spar. One of these came from the Stavanger Port Authority. They were planning a quay extension at Mekjarvik, to provide new Roll-On/Roll-Off ferry facilities. It was hoped that using slices of the Spar&#x27;s hull would save both money and energy that would otherwise have been spent in new steel construction. The Spar was raised vertically in the water by building a lifting cradle, placed underneath the Spar and connected by cables to jacks on board heavy barges. Jacking the cables upwards raised the Spar so that its hull could be cut into &#x27;rings&#x27; and slid onto a barge.

After cleaning, the rings were placed in the sea beside the existing quay at Mekjarvik and filled with ballast. The construction of the quay extension was completed by placing a concrete slab across the rings. The Spar&#x27;s living quarters and operations module were removed and scrapped onshore at a Norwegian landfill site.

While the Brent Spar was being dismantled, quantities of the endangered cold-water coral &quot;Lophelia pertusa&quot; were found growing on the legs of the platform. At the time, this was considered unusual, although recent studies have shown this to be a common occurrence, with 13 of 14 North Sea oil rigs examined having &quot;L. pertusa&quot; colonies. The authors of the original work suggested that it may be better to leave the lower parts of such structures in place — a suggestion opposed by Greenpeace campaigner Simon Reddy, who compared it to &quot;[dumping] a car in a wood – moss would grow on it, and if I was lucky a bird may even nest in it. But this is not justification to fill our forests with disused cars&quot;.

==Effect of Brent Spar==
According to a poll of 1000 adults carried out by Opinion Leader Research on 26 January 1996 on behalf of Greenpeace, a majority of the British public were aware of the Brent Spar (57%). Of these, 57% were opposed to the dumping of Brent Spar in the Atlantic, and 32% were in favour of it.

Although Shell had carried out an environmental impact assessment in full accordance with existing legislation, they had severely underestimated strength of public opinion. Shell were particularly criticised for having thought of this as a &quot;Scottish&quot;, or &quot;UK&quot; problem, and neglecting to think of the effect which it would have on their image in the wider world. The final cost of the Brent Spar operation to Shell was between £60M and £100M, when loss of sales were considered. Although Shell and the offshore industry consider that Brent Spar did not set a precedent for disposal of facilities in the future, signatory nations of the OSPAR conventions have since agreed that oil facilities should be disposed of onshore, so it is difficult to see how this does not set a precedent.
Shell claimed that spending such an amount to protect a small area of remote, low resource value, deep sea was pointless and this money could be much more constructively spent.

The overestimation of the contents of the Brent Spar damaged the credibility of Greenpeace in their wider campaigns. They were criticised in an editorial column in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; for their lack of interest in facts. Greenpeace moved to distance itself from its &quot;5500 tonnes&quot; claim, after the Brent Spar argument was won.

<text>Teresópolis () is a Brazilian municipality located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in a mountainous region known as &quot;Região Serrana&quot;. The Serra dos Órgãos National Park lies partly within the city limits. The city is known as the home of the Brazil national football team, since it hosts CBF&#x27;s training ground at Granja Comary.

==History==

Before the arrival of the Portuguese to the area where Teresópolis lies today, in the 16th century, it was inhabited by indigenous Brazilians. In the following centuries, Portuguese started buying land there. The region was also occupied by a quilombo, formed by runaway slaves coming from sugar cane plantations near Rio de Janeiro.

In 1821, English citizen George March (born and raised in Portugal) established a farm there, which later became the most important settlement along the way between the court, in Rio de Janeiro, and the territory of Gerais (nowadays, the state of Minas Gerais), which led to the great improvement of agriculture and cattle raising.

The Brazilian imperial family was much impressed by the natural beauty and the climate of the region, which developed slowly so that in 1855 the settlement became a village that was named Freguesia de Santo Antonio de Paquequer.

The further development of the village was due to the traders that came from Minas Gerais in the way to Rio de Janeiro, and used the region as a resting stop. Finally, on July 6, 1891, the village became a municipality that was named Teresópolis (&quot;city of Teresa&quot;), after Empress Teresa Cristina, wife of Emperor Pedro II.

The uncontrolled growth of Teresópolis and other cities of the mountainous region near Rio de Janeiro led to the construction of a great number of houses in mountainous terrain or on the banks of rivers. This fact, together with a 24-hour rainfall that exceeded what was expected for the entire month, caused a series of floods and mudslides in January 2011. More than 400 people died and thousands lost their houses in the event, which is considered the worst weather-related tragedy in Brazilian history. .

==Geography==

According to the 2010 Brazilian Census, the city has a population of 163,746 within a land area of 770,6 km2. The Serra dos Órgãos National Park is in the vicinity. Its predominant vegetation belongs to the Atlantic Forest type. The city is surrounded by forests and by well-known summits or peaks, because of which the city is known as the national capital of mountaineering. The most famous peaks are:
* Peak of Pedra do Sino – 
* Peak of Pedra do Açu – 
* Peak of Agulha do Diabo – 
* Peak of Nariz do Frade – 
* Peak of Dedo de Deus – 
* Peak of Pedra da Ermitage – 
* Peak of Dedo de Nossa Senhora – 
Of these, Dedo de Deus (&quot;God&#x27;s finger&quot;) is the most famous.

The municipality contains the Montanhas de Teresópolis Municipal Nature Park, created in 2009 to protect a large area of Atlantic Forest.
The municipality contained the Floresta do Jacarandá Environmental Protection Area, but this was extinguished in 2013.
It contains the Bacia dos Frades Environmental Protection Area, created in 1990.
The municipality contains 20% of the Três Picos State Park, created in 2002.
It contains part of the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic of conservation units, created in 2006.

===Climate===

Teresópolis features a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb), with relatively cold and dry winters and mild and wet summers. The annual average temperature is 16 °C/60.8 °F.

Teresópolis has one of the mildest climates in Brazil and this is one reason why the area has been chosen as Brazilian Football Confederation&#x27;s training headquarters, hosting the Brazil national football team, located in Granja Comary.

<text>Embryoid bodies (EBs) are three-dimensional aggregates formed by pluripotent stem cells. These include embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)

EBs are differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies comprising the three embryonic germ layers. They mimic the characteristics seen in early-stage embryos. They are often used as a model system to conduct research on various aspects of developmental biology. They can also contribute to research focused on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

The pluripotent cell types that comprise embryoid bodies include embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the blastocyst stage of embryos from mouse (mESC), primate, and human (hESC) sources. Additionally, EBs can be formed from embryonic stem cells derived through alternative techniques, including somatic cell nuclear transfer or the reprogramming of somatic cells to yield induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). Similar to ESCs cultured in monolayer formats, ESCs within embryoid bodies undergo differentiation and cell specification along the three germ lineages – endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm – which comprise all somatic cell types.

In contrast to monolayer cultures, however, the spheroid structures that are formed when ESCs aggregate enables the non-adherent culture of EBs in suspension, making EB cultures inherently scalable, which is useful for bioprocessing approaches, whereby large yields of cells can be produced for potential clinical applications. Additionally, although EBs largely exhibit heterogeneous patterns of differentiated cell types, ESCs are capable of responding to similar cues that direct embryonic development. Therefore, the three-dimensional structure, including the establishment of complex cell adhesions and paracrine signaling within the EB microenvironment, enables differentiation and morphogenesis which yields microtissues that are similar to native tissue structures. Such microtissues are promising to directly or indirectly repair damaged or diseased tissue in regenerative medicine applications, as well as for in vitro testing in the pharmaceutical industry and as a model of embryonic development.

==Formation==
EBs are formed by the homophilic binding of the Ca2+ dependent adhesion molecule E-cadherin, which is highly expressed on undifferentiated ESCs. When cultured as single cells in the absence of anti-differentiation factors, ESCs spontaneously aggregate to form EBs. Such spontaneous formation is often accomplished in bulk suspension cultures whereby the dish is coated with non-adhesive materials, such as agar or hydrophilic polymers, to promote the preferential adhesion between single cells, rather than to the culture substrate. As hESC undergo apoptosis when cultured as single cells, EB formation often necessitates the use of inhibitors of the rho associated kinase (ROCK) pathway, including the small molecules Y-27632 and 2,4 disubstituted thiazole (Thiazovivin/Tzv). Alternatively, to avoid dissociation into single cells, EBs can be formed from hESCs by manual separation of adherent colonies (or regions of colonies) and subsequently cultured in suspension. Formation of EBs in suspension is amenable to the formation of large quantities of EBs, but provides little control over the size of the resulting aggregates, often leading to large, irregularly shaped EBs. As an alternative, the hydrodynamic forces imparted in mixed culture platforms increase the homogeneity of EB sizes when ESCs are inoculated within bulk suspensions.

Formation of EBs can also be more precisely controlled by the inoculation of known cell densities within single drops (10-20 μL) suspended from the lid of a Petri dish, known as hanging drops. While this method enables control of EB size by altering the number of cells per drop, the formation of hanging drops is labor-intensive and not easily amenable to scalable cultures. Additionally, the media can not be easily exchanged within the traditional hanging drop format, necessitating the transfer of hanging drops into bulk suspension cultures after 2–3 days of formation, whereby individual EBs tend to agglomerate. Recently, new technologies have been developed to enable media exchange within a modified hanging drop format. In addition, technologies have also been developed to physically separate cells by forced aggregation of ESCs within individual wells or confined on adhesive substrates, which enables increased throughput, controlled formation of EBs. Ultimately, the methods used for EB formation may impact the heterogeneity of EB populations, in terms of aggregation kinetics, EB size and yield, as well as differentiation trajectories.

==Differentiation within EBs==
Within the context of ESC differentiation protocols, EB formation is often used as a method for initiating spontaneous differentiation toward the three germ lineages. EB differentiation begins with the specification of the exterior cells toward the primitive endoderm phenotype. The cells at the exterior then deposit extracellular matrix (ECM), containing collagen IV and laminin, similar to the composition and structure of basement membrane. In response to the ECM deposition, EBs often form a cystic cavity, whereby the cells in contact with the basement membrane remain viable and those at the interior undergo apoptosis, resulting in a fluid-filled cavity surrounded by cells. Subsequent differentiation proceeds to form derivatives of the three germ lineages. In the absence of supplements, the “default” differentiation of ESCs is largely toward ectoderm, and subsequent neural lineages. However, alternative media compositions, including the use of fetal bovine serum as well as defined growth factor additives, have been developed to promote the differentiation toward mesoderm and endoderm lineages.

As a result of the three-dimensional EB structure, complex morphogenesis occurs during EB differentiation, including the appearance of both epithelial- and mesenchymal-like cell populations, as well as the appearance of markers associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, the inductive effects resulting from signaling between cell populations in EBs results in spatially and temporally defined changes, which promote complex morphogenesis. Tissue-like structures are often exhibited within EBs, including the appearance of blood islands reminiscent of early blood vessel structures in the developing embryo, as well as the patterning of neurite extensions (indicative of neuron organization) and spontaneous contractile activity (indicative of cardiomyocyte differentiation) when EBs are plated onto adhesive substrates such as gelatin. More recently, complex structures, including optic cup-like structures were created in vitro resulting from EB differentiation.

==Parallels with embryonic development==
Much of the research central to embryonic stem cell differentiation and morphogenesis is derived from studies in developmental biology and mammalian embryogenesis. For example, immediately after the blastocyst stage of development (from which ESCs are derived), the embryo undergoes differentiation, whereby cell specification of the inner cell mass results in the formation of the hypoblast and epiblast. Later on in postimplantation development, the anterior-posterior axis is formed and the embryo develops a transient structure known as the primitive streak. Much of the spatial patterning that occurs during the formation and migration of the primitive streak results from the secretion of agonists and antagonists by various cell populations, including the growth factors from the Wnt and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) families (Lefty 1, Nodal), as well as repressors of the same molecules (Dkk-1, Sfrp1, Sfrp5). Due to the similarities between embryogenesis and ESC differentiation, many of the same growth factors are central to directed differentiation approaches.

In addition, advancements of EB culture resulted in the development of embryonic organoids (Gastruloids) which show remarkable parallels to embryonic development such as symmetry-breaking, localised brachyury expression, the formation of the embryonic axes (anteroposterior, dorsoventral and Left-Right) and gastrulation-like movements.

==Challenges to directing differentiation==
In contrast to the differentiation of ESCs in monolayer cultures, whereby the addition of soluble morphogens and the extracellular microenvironment can be precisely and homogeneously controlled, the three-dimensional structure of EBs poses challenges to directed differentiation. For example, the visceral endoderm population which forms the exterior of EBs, creates an exterior “shell” consisting of tightly connected epithelial-like cells, as well as a dense ECM. Due to such physical restrictions, in combination with EB size, transport limitations occur within EBs, creating gradients of morphogens, metabolites, and nutrients. It has been estimated that oxygen transport is limited in cell aggregates larger than approximately 300 μm in diameter; however, the development of such gradients are also impacted by molecule size and cell uptake rates. Therefore, the delivery of morphogens to EBs results in increased heterogeneity and decreased efficiency of differentiated cell populations compared to monolayer cultures. One method of addressing transport limitations within EBs has been through polymeric delivery of morphogens from within the EB structure. Additionally, EBs can be cultured as individual microtissues and subsequently assembled into larger structures for tissue engineering applications. Although the complexity resulting from the three-dimensional adhesions and signaling may recapitulate more native tissue structures, it also creates challenges for understanding the relative contributions of mechanical, chemical, and physical signals to the resulting cell phenotypes and morphogenesis.

<text>The Oddballs are a British comedy act formed in 1980 by Danny Blue and Richard Welsh.

Television appearances include &quot;EastEnders&quot;, &quot;Taggart&quot;, &quot;The Des O&#x27;Connor Show&quot;, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, &quot;The Salon&quot;, &quot;Sextasy&quot;, &quot;Trisha Goddard&quot; (formerly &quot;Trisha&quot;), &quot;Vanessa&quot;, &quot;The Broker&#x27;s Man&quot;, and Portugal&#x27;s top television comedy show, &quot;Levanta-te e Ri&quot;.

They have also appeared theaters in the London&#x27;s West End theatre and across the country touring with Jim Davidson in the adult pantomimes &quot;Sinderella&quot; and &quot;Sinderella Comes Again&quot;. The current line-up is Blue, Mark Gale, and Doughty.

They are best known for their &quot;Naked Balloon Dance&quot;. They have also caused controversy, including an attempt to ban the show from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Saved only by Robert Everitt, Conservative councillor for the Risbygate Ward, who called it &quot;extremely funny - not at all rude, just risqué.&quot; During the 1980s, Blue introduced the outrageous sport of Dwarf Throwing and later went on to win the World Title in Australia in 1986.

Adrian Doughty, from the Oddballs, comments &quot;It never ceases to amaze me the bizarre to the ridiculous places we are booked to perform this, so very funny act. A good example I will never forget was a guy in East London whose mother always wished for a toy boy. So it came to pass whilst lying in her coffin, in the crematorium, the Oddballs were confronted with all her loving family, tears and all. As the last beat of the famous instrumental &quot;Wheels&quot; came to an end, so I pushed the button, the curtain closed and to my amazement the tears before me had turned to smile&#x27;s...&quot;

<doc id="1195525" wikidata="Q5600798" url="?curid=1195525" title="Greater Vancouver">
<text>Greater Vancouver, also known as Metro Vancouver, is the metropolitan area with its major urban centre being the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The term &quot;Greater Vancouver&quot; describes an area that is roughly coterminous with the region governed by the Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD), though it predates the 1966 creation of the regional district. It is often used to include areas beyond the boundaries of the regional district but does not generally include wilderness and agricultural areas that are included within the MVRD.

Usage of the term &quot;Greater Vancouver&quot; is not consistent. In local use, it tends to refer to urban and suburban areas only and does not include parts of the regional district such as Bowen Island, although industries such as the film industry even include Squamish, Whistler and Hope as being in &quot;the Vancouver area&quot; or &quot;in Greater Vancouver&quot;. The business community often includes adjoining towns and cities such as Mission, Chilliwack, Abbotsford and Squamish within their use of the term &quot;Greater Vancouver&quot;, though since the creation of the term &quot;Metro Vancouver&quot;, that has come to be used in the media interchangeably with the name of the region and regional district.

As a geographic region, Greater Vancouver is part of the Lower Mainland, one of British Columbia&#x27;s three main geospatial/cultural divisions, and overlaps with the Lower Fraser Valley, with the Central and Upper Fraser Valley areas to the east being in the Fraser Valley Regional District, which was created from two others upon the expansion of the Greater Vancouver Regional District to include Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows. Other forms of regional governance and administration whose jurisdiction Greater Vancouver is in are the North Vancouver and Coquitlam Forests Districts, and the Ministry of Environment&#x27;s Lower Mainland Region (which includes the Sunshine Coast, the Fraser Health Authority and the New Westminster Land District, among others).

== Geography ==
Greater Vancouver occupies the southwest corner of mainland British Columbia. It comprises roughly the western half of the Lower Mainland and sits astride the lower reaches of the Fraser River and both banks of Burrard Inlet.

Thirteen of the province&#x27;s thirty most populous municipalities are located in Greater Vancouver. The official land area of the district is . It is the most densely populated region in British Columbia.

The University of British Columbia campus and the University Endowment Lands, both located to the west of the City of Vancouver&#x27;s limits, are not subject to governance by any municipality.

There are also seventeen Indian reserves within the geographical area that are not subject to governance by the municipalities or the Regional District; they have a combined population of 7,550 (2006) and are governed by the Squamish Nation, Musqueam Nation, Tsleil-waututh First Nation, Tsawwassen First Nation, Semiahmoo First Nation, Kwikwetlem First Nation, Katzie First Nation and Kwantlen First Nation.
The cities of Abbotsford, Chilliwack, and Mission, located to the region&#x27;s east, are often linked to Vancouver in promotions and tourism and in various non-official usages, as are Squamish and Whistler to the region&#x27;s north.

==Demographics==
The 2016 census indicates a population of 2,463,431 in Greater Vancouver, representing a 6.5 percent increase from the 2011 census.

The population of Metro Vancouver is of diverse origin. In 1981, approximately 14 percent of Greater Vancouver&#x27;s population belonged to a visible minority group. The 2016 census showed that 48.6 percent of the population was of European heritage, 2.5 percent was of Indigenous heritage, and the remaining 48.9 percent of the population were of visible minority origin, the largest group being Chinese followed by South Asians. Other prominent groups include Filipinos, Koreans, Japanese, Southeast Asian, West Asian, and Latin Americans. British Columbia is Canada&#x27;s most ethnically diverse province.


==Politics and government==

=== Federal ===

Federally, the electorates in the Greater Vancouver region elect Conservative, New Democratic, and Liberal members of Parliamentsthe region is an important bedrock of left-of-centre support in conservative-leaning Western Canada; along with the NDP&#x27;s strength on Vancouver Island, coastal BC often accounts for over half of left-of-center MPs west of Ontario in most parliaments.

After the 2011 election, the Conservatives and NDP emerged as the two strongest parties in the region, with Conservative support concentrated in the suburbs around Vancouver (e.g. North Vancouver, West Vancouver, and Richmond), and NDP support strongest on the east side of Vancouver, Burnaby, Coquitlam, and New Westminster.

In 2011, the Liberals were reduced to two seats, both located in Vancouver. However, in the 2015 election, a reversal of fortunes led to the Liberals taking most of the seats in the region away from the Conservatives; the 2019 election had the Conservatives gain some seats back in Richmond, Langley and southern Surrey; many of these swung back to the Liberals in the 2021 election.

=== Provincial ===
Greater Vancouver, like the rest of British Columbia, is divided between BC United and the BC NDP. While BC United are not formally affiliated with any federal party, they tend to draw support from those who vote for either the Liberal Party of Canada or the Conservative Party of Canada, while the BC NDP provide a centre-left alternative, and is formally affiliated with the New Democratic Party of Canada. Polling from the 2013 provincial election showed that supporters of the BC Liberals were almost evenly split between federal Liberals and federal Conservatives. Despite this trend, former NDP premier Ujjal Dosanjh ran federally for the Liberals in the 2004 election, and some NDP supporters have drifted to the Greens in recent years.

In terms of political geography, Greater Vancouver is not as polarized between urban core and suburban areas as metropolitan areas in other parts of the country are. However, the BC NDP tends to draw greater support from ridings on the east side of Vancouver, Burnaby, the Tri-Cities, and parts of Surrey. By contrast, the BC Liberals are stronger on the west side of Vancouver, the North Shore, the Fraser Valley, and held every seat in Richmond from 1991 to 2020. Ridings in Central Vancouver, like Vancouver-Fairview and Vancouver-Point Grey, and Surrey tend to be swing ridings, with close races between the two parties. Vicki Huntington, an Independent member of the Legislative Assembly, has represented the riding of Delta South since 2009.

Between 1986 and 2013, every premier of British Columbia (other than Dan Miller from August 25, 1999, to February 24, 2000) represented a riding from within Greater Vancouver. After Christy Clark lost her seat in Vancouver-Point Grey in the 2013 provincial election, and until David Eby succeeded John Horgan in 2022, premiers represented ridings outside Greater Vancouver. Premier Eby is the MLA for Vancouver-Point Grey.

=== Minority representation ===

Due to the region&#x27;s ethnically diverse population, there is also diverse government representation. Federally, there are five MPs of visible minority origin: three of South Asian descent, one of Chinese descent, and one of Trinidadian descent. Provincially, there are six South Asian, three Chinese, one Japanese, and one Filipino MLAs.

The Greater Vancouver region has many &quot;electoral firsts&quot;. Rosemary Brown was the first black woman elected to political office, becoming an MLA in 1972, and the first woman and first black person to run for a party leadership in 1975. Emery Barnes, a football player elected to the Legislature alongside Rosemary Brown in 1972, and stayed in that capacity until 1996, serving as the Speaker from 1994. Former Indo-Canadian premier Ujjal Dosanjh was the first non-white premier of the province, while Douglas Jung was the first Chinese-Canadian to become a Member of Parliament. Yonah Martin is the first Korean-Canadian to hold federal public office. Jenny Kwan was the first Chinese-Canadian provincial cabinet minister in Canada. Naomi Yamamoto and Mable Elmore are respectively the first Japanese and Filipino MLAs in the province. Furthermore, Stephanie Cadieux is the first quadriplegic MLA, while Svend Robinson was the first openly gay Canadian MP. James Atebe was the first black mayor in Mission, British Columbia.

<text>Nixa Record Company Ltd. was founded in 1950 by Hilton Nixon. Nixa was the second company, after Decca, to release LP records in Britain (at the time, EMI was attempting to promote 45 rpm records over 33 LP records). The record label, which traded as Nixa Records, was acquired by Pye Records in 1953.

Nixon&#x27;s stepson, John M. Reid (then also known as Nixon), was manager from 1950 until the company was sold to Pye in 1953. Nixa Records was set up principally to market the catalogue of Compagnie Générale du Disque, Paris, in Commonwealth of Nations countries. The artists included Dany Dauberson, André Claveau, and other continental cabaret and jazz artists. The shellac records were pressed for Nixa by the Decca Record Company. Later, Nixa made licensing arrangements with a number of US classical music record companies, including Westminster Records, Period Records, Concert Hall Records, Haydn Society and Vanguard Records, to manufacture and market their catalogues in the UK and British Commonwealth. Nixa also made original recordings in England at the Walthamstow Assembly Hall of Sir Adrian Boult conducting Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets Suite&quot;, Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;English Folk Song Suite&quot;, and others.

Their primary artist was Petula Clark, who recorded for the label in both English and French from 1955 to 1962. Many of her releases for the label were top ten hits in both the UK and France, with three of them charting at number one.

In 1987, the Nixa name was used again as a classical imprint by PRT Records.

<doc id="1195528" wikidata="Q1800955" url="?curid=1195528" title="Whitehawk">
<text>Whitehawk is a suburb in the east of Brighton, England, south of Bevendean and north of Brighton Marina. The area is a large, modern housing estate built in a downland dry valley historically known as Whitehawk Bottom. The estate was originally developed by the local council between 1933 and 1937 and included nearly 1,200 residences. Subsequently, the Swanborough flats were built in 1967, and in the 1970s and 1980s much of the estate was rebuilt by altering the road layouts and increasing the number of houses. Whitehawk is part of the East Brighton ward of Brighton and Hove City Council.

==History==

=== Pre-development ===
Before being developed, Whitehawk was chalk downland. At the top of Whitehawk Hill, Whitehawk Camp was a Neolithic causewayed camp of the Windmill Hill culture inhabited around 5500 years ago. It is now a scheduled ancient monument and is one of three causewayed camps known to have existed in the South Downs. The name Whitehawk is believed to be a corruption of &quot;Vied Ac&quot;, the Saxon for &quot;holy oak&quot;, named after a wooden pole which stood on the hill.

Horse racing started on Whitehawk Down in the late 18th century next to the causewayed camp and connected to the White Hawk Fair. Brighton Race Course is still on the site, which became known as Race Hill. By 1870, the neighbouring Sheepcote Valley was being used as a rifle range to train volunteer soldiers. By 1916 it had begun to be used as a refuse tip. A site at Sheepcote close to the edge of the Whitehawk housing is still used as a Council waste centre for domestic users.

Whitehawk Road, as it then was, came to demarcate the eastern parish boundary of Brighton. In 1818 gas works were built at Black Rock, between Whitehawk and the sea. By virtue of being built there, the works avoided paying taxes in Brighton.

===1920 to World War II===
By the beginning of the 1920s, the Whitehawk area consisted mainly of pig farms, smallholdings and allotments. This would all change between 1920 and 1931 when Brighton Corporation, in common with local government authorities all over the country, began a program of slum clearances. Alongside Manor Farm, Whitehawk was one of the areas used for new homes to house the residents. The homes were designed to have &quot;all modern conveniences&quot; including electricity, gas and running water. They also had gardens. This was a huge contrast to the small, back to back terraces in the town centre, which they replaced. Some people found it very difficult to adjust. This was partly because many of those moved earned their living as rag and bone men, conducting their business by horse and cart. This was hard to do from so far out of town.

Between 1933 and 1937 the council estate was built. By 1937 there were nearly 1,200 houses in Whitehawk, all with gardens.

East Brighton Park, at the Eastern extremity of Whitehawk, was home to the first Municipal Camping Ground, opened by the mayor of Brighton, Herbert Hone, in May 1938. It utilised buildings already at the site, formerly belonging to the Newhouse Farm. These buildings are thought to date from the late 18th century.

The first Whitehawk Library opened in 1934 in front of the Primary School. In 1935 a lido was built on the seafront at Black Rock, a short distance from Whitehawk (via the eastern extremities of Brighton&#x27;s Kemp Town seafront development).

===1950s and 1960s===

Post-war Brighton suffered a housing shortage and so further building work was carried out in the Whitehawk area. New low- and high-rise flats were built to the west of Whitehawk (known as the Bristol Estate) and private housing was also started, most notably a large self-build scheme in Wilson Avenue at the far east of the estate. The high rise Swanborough Flats were built by Brighton Corporation at the northern tip of Whitehawk in 1967. By 1969 the library site was needed by the school for classrooms and so a temporary library was opened in Rugby House, Rugby Place.

===1970s to 2000s===
The Community Centre, along with a new library, including a toy library for children was opened by Princess Alexandra in November 1973 in Whitehawk Road. At the time it was the largest in Brighton.

From 1975, the Council started a remodelling exercise in Whitehawk. Initially, houses were left empty as they became vacant, and were boarded up. Many of the long roads in Whitehawk were removed and replaced with smaller cul-de-sacs. This allowed larger numbers of houses to fit into the same space and by the end of the scheme the number of houses in Whitehawk had increased to over 1,400. The last part of the scheme, Lintott Avenue (South) was completed in 1988.

In 1979, the Black Rock lido was demolished in conjunction with the development of Brighton Marina. Construction of the marina had already started in 1971.

The population of Whitehawk (and Manor Farm) was nearly 8,000 in 1981.

In April 2000, The East Brighton New Deal for Communities (EBNDC) Partnership was awarded £47.2m from the government&#x27;s pilot NDC programme aimed at social regeneration of the area covering Bate&#x27;s Estate, Higher Bevendean, Manor Farm, Moulsecoomb, Saunders Park and Whitehawk. Money was spent in Whitehawk on various community projects, the most notable being the Crew Club youth centre and The Whitehawk Inn Community Hub. 41 pedestrian alleys were remodelled because they were seen as &quot;havens for anti-social behaviour&quot;.

Whitehawk is overlooked by the White Hawk, a chalk carving in the hill at Sheepcote Valley. The White Hawk was carved in 2001 by local artists with support from the Friends of Sheepcote Valley (FSV) and Whitehawk residents. It was recently renovated by the FSV, local scouts, community workers, council rangers and residents.

== 2010s ==
Whitehawk was noted in 2010 to be in the 5% of most deprived areas in Great Britain. Funding of £7.4m was provided by the state and the local council to create a &#x27;community hub&#x27;.

After a consultation by two groups not based in Whitehawk, Racehill Community Orchard was built at the top of Whitehawk in 2012. Over 60 fruit trees and 1000 native hedgerow plants were installed. In 2018, the orchard won a Britain in Bloom award.
Over 100 people attended a protest on Whitehawk Hill in 2018, to beat the bounds of the common land. They were angered by plans to build 217 homes on the conservation area. Local environmentalist Dave Bangs said &quot;Whitehawk Hill is more precious than the Brighton Pavilion because of its public value, its ancient history.&quot; The plans were definitively discarded by the Council in January 2019.

Following local elections in May 2019, Whitehawk is part of the East Brighton ward represented at Brighton and Hove City Council by Nancy Platts (Labour), Nichole Brennan (Labour) and Gill Williams (Labour).

==Places of worship==

St. Cuthman&#x27;s (Church of England) Church was built in the 1930s and completely destroyed by bombing in World War II. It was rebuilt after the war, being completed in 1952 to the design of local architect John Leopold Denman. It is sometimes called &quot;the Children&#x27;s Church&quot; because local children famously saved their pennies to help fund the rebuilding. The church hall was sold to the local Community Association in 1982. St. Cuthmans (Church of England) is situated on Whitehawk Way next door to the Valley Social Centre. The church also runs a drop-in centre.

The Valley Social Centre, previously known as St. David&#x27;s Mission Hall (also Church of England) is now used as a community centre, and also runs a drop-in centre.

The Roman Catholic Church of St. Louis, King of France opened in 1964 and was demolished in 1982 after being declared unsafe. A block of flats now stands on the site.

==Education==

===Primary===
Whitehawk Primary School caters for children aged between 3 and 11 years old. It was formed by the amalgamation of the old separate Infant and Junior Schools. In May 2006, the 3- and 4-year-olds separated from the primary school and became part of Roundabout Children&#x27;s Centre for 0- to 5-year-olds which was visited by the Queen in March 2007. Despite its best ever SATS results in 2012 it is going to be the first primary Academy school in the city run by City College.

St. John the Baptist Catholic School caters for children aged between 4 and 11 years old.

St. Mark&#x27;s Primary School is situated on Manor Road and serves the Whitehawk, Manor and Bristol estates, originally situated by the gasworks, it was moved to its present location in the 1970s. It is a one form of entry school and well known for its nurturing approach and partnership working with families

===Secondary===
Stanley Deason Secondary School was opened in 1976. The name was changed to Marina High in September 1997 and East Brighton College of Media Arts (often abbreviated to COMART) in September 1999. It closed in August 2005. It catered for children aged between 11 and 16 years old. When the school closed the pupils were enrolled in the various other schools in Brighton and Hove.

===Post 16 and adult===
Whitehawk Inn is a community learning centre in South Whitehawk, occupying a former pub. It was founded in 2001. It provides various long and short term, full- and part-time courses in a wide range of subjects as well as providing advice on gaining employment.

The buildings of the former secondary school are leased to Greater Brighton Metropolitan College, which runs courses in construction skills and in media studies in them.

===Class Divide (Campaign Group)===
Class Divide is a grassroots campaign group based in Brighton and Hove, England, focused on addressing educational inequalities in the city, particularly in the East Brighton communities of Whitehawk, Manor Farm, and Bristol Estate. Initially started as an offshoot of The Crew Club, a youth and community centre, Class Divide aims to create a more socially inclusive education system by challenging stereotypes, building a movement for change, and advocating for policy reforms.

===Background===
Brighton and Hove, despite its reputation as an inclusive and progressive city, faces significant educational disparities. Data obtained by Class Divide through Freedom of Information requests revealed stark contrasts in educational outcomes between different areas of the city. For example:

In 2019, Only 37% of students in Whitehawk, Manor Farm, and Bristol Estate achieved GCSE English and Maths, compared to the city average of 69%.

Children from these communities are twice as likely to be excluded from school and three times more likely to be placed in non-mainstream schools, including pupil referral units.

===Mission and Objectives===
The primary goals of Class Divide include:

Highlighting persistent educational inequalities in Brighton &amp; Hove
Challenging unjust stereotypes
Building a broad movement for change
Changing policies and structures that maintain the status quo

The group is independent of political affiliations and works with various stakeholders to improve educational opportunities for low-income children.

===Achievements===
Class Divide has made several notable achievements since its inception:

Raising awareness about the educational divide in Brighton &amp; Hove
Influencing local education policies
Improving affordability of school uniforms and travel
Implementing policies to give children on Free School Meals (FSM) more choice in secondary education
Supporting community participation in democratic processes

===Free School Meals Priority Proposal===
In a significant development, Class Divide supported a proposal to create a new priority category for FSM children in secondary school admissions, which was approved by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council&#x27;s Children, Young People and Schools committee. The proposal aims to:

Provide more school choice for FSM-eligible children
Ensure all secondary schools in the city teach at least the average percentage of FSM-eligible pupils
Promote socio-economic integration in schools

The proposal has garnered support from various stakeholders, including headteachers, policymakers, and researchers.

===Podcast Series===
In 2023, Class Divide released a documentary podcast series following the lives of a family from Whitehawk. The series explores the impact of education on life chances and features discussions with experts on the UK&#x27;s education system, segregation, and attainment gaps. Notable guests include Darren McGarvey, Professor Diane Reay, and Fiona Millar.

===Future Plans===
Class Divide continues to build on its success in Brighton and Hove, with plans to focus on:

Catchment areas
Published Admission Numbers (PANs)
Promoting their ideas across the UK

==Transport==

The Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company maintains a depot at the south end of Whitehawk. As of 2019, Whitehawk was served by buses 1, 1A, 21, 21A, 21E and night bus N21, as well as School buses 71,72, 72A and 73.

==Sport==
Whitehawk F.C. is a semi-professional football club playing in the Isthmian League Premier Division, the seventh tier of English football. Founded in 1945, The Hawks reached National League South having won promotion three times in the space of four years between 2009 and 2013 as well as the second round of the FA Cup in 2015. Whitehawk play their games at The Enclosed Ground, a stadium in East Brighton Park.

<doc id="1195535" wikidata="Q89684563" url="?curid=1195535" title="Polygon Records">
<text>Polygon Records was a British independent record labels.

==History==
The label was started in 1949 as the Polygon Record Company Ltd. by Alan A. Freeman and Leslie Clark, who was anxious to control distribution of his daughter Petula Clark&#x27;s recordings. (Those associated with it fondly referred to the company as &quot;Dead Parrot Records&quot;.) The two opened offices on Grosvenor Place in the Sloane Square section of London, and arranged Clark&#x27;s first recording session with Ron Goodwin and his orchestra and a vocal backing group called the Stargazers. Since Polygon&#x27;s UK distribution was not yet in existence, the first 78rpm single - &quot;You Go to My Head&quot; backed with &quot;Out of a Clear Blue Sky&quot; - was released in Australia, followed by a cover of Teresa Brewer&#x27;s &quot;Music! Music! Music!&quot; backed with &quot;Blossoms on the Bough&quot;, both on the Esquire label.

In fact, the first Polygon release in the UK was not by Clark but by Louis Prima and his orchestra. Clark&#x27;s first official Polygon release was &quot;You Are My True Love&quot;/&quot;You&#x27;re the Sweetest in the Land&quot; in 1950. Her first big hit came in June 1954 with &#x27;The Little Shoemaker&#x27; (Polygon P1117). In all, she recorded more than fifty songs for the label, including a few duets with its other major artist, Jimmy Young, then best known as a singer. Jimmy Young recorded his big hit &#x27;Too Young&#x27; for the Polygon label (P1013) in 1951, but this was before the days of UK record charts which started in November 1952.

Near the end of 1955, Polygon was sold to Nixa Records, then part of Pye Records, which led to the establishment of Pye Nixa Records. Nixa utilized a selection of Clark&#x27;s Polygon tapes to release her first LP, &quot;Petula Clark Sings&quot;.

Clark&#x27;s complete Polygon catalogue is available on CD - originally re-issued as &quot;The Polygon Years, Volume One (1950–1952)&quot; and &quot;The Polygon Years, Volume Two (1952–1955&quot;). However, when Polygon was first merged with Nixa, one of the two Nissen huts used for storing the label&#x27;s master tapes was demolished with the contents still inside. Thus, as a consequence, the only source for around half of Polygon&#x27;s masters is original 78rpm discs. The first CD reissues of these recordings therefore suffered from poor sound, which was not improved until 2007 on the compilation &quot;It Had to Be You - The Complete Early Singles&quot;.

She is surprised to find strangers living in her mother&#x27;s dilapidated home: Bobby Long, a former professor of literature at Auburn University, and his protégé and former teaching assistant, Lawson Pines, a struggling writer. Both heavy drinkers and smokers, pass time quoting poets, playing chess, and spending time with the neighbors; Long also sings country-folk songs. The two convince Pursy that her mother left the house to all three of them. More exactly, the truth is that Pursy is the sole heir, and her mother&#x27;s will limits how long the other two can stay in the house.

Pursy moves in, acting as the most responsible member of the evolving dysfunctional family. The men&#x27;s efforts to drive her away decline as they grow more fond of her. Bobby - slovenly and suffering from ailments he prefers to ignore - tries to improve Pursy by introducing her to the novel &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot;; he also encourages her to return to high school and get her degree. Lawson is attracted to her but hesitates to become involved. The three have memories of Lorraine, especially Pursy, who feels that her mother ignored her to pursue her jazz career.

==Critical reception==
Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;[I]t dawdles along aimlessly for nearly two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise.&quot; He felt John Travolta was playing &quot;a hammed-up, scenery-chewing variation of the brainy good ol&#x27; boy he played in &quot;Primary Colors&quot;,&quot; and thought Gabriel Macht&#x27;s &quot;understated performance&quot; was &quot;the deepest and subtlest of the three.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote &quot;What can be said is that the three actors inhabit this material with ease and gratitude: It is good to act on a simmer sometimes, instead of at a fast boil. It&#x27;s unusual to find an American movie that takes its time. It&#x27;s remarkable to listen to dialogue that assumes the audience is well-read. It is refreshing to hear the literate conversation. These are modest pleasures, but real enough.&quot;

Carina Chocano of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film 
is, deep-down, a redemptive makeover story drenched in alcohol, Southern literature, and the damp romanticism of the bohemian lush life in New Orleans. A lovely noble rot pervades the film in much the same way that it does the city, a longtime repository of lost-cause romanticism. If there&#x27;s something a little bit moldy about the setup (drunken literary types, hope on the doorstep, healing from beyond the grave), the movie is no less charming or involving for it, and it&#x27;s no less pleasant to succumb to its wayward allure and wastrel lyricism. Among other things, the characters... really know how to turn a phrase, in itself a pleasure so rare it all but demands any flaws be forgiven.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated the film two out of four stars, calling it &quot;an elegant mess.&quot; He added &quot;The actors labor to perform a rescue operation... It&#x27;s the stunning location photography of camera ace Elliot Davis that provides what the movie itself lacks: authenticity.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==

Bonus features include commentary with screenwriter/director Shainee Gabel and cinematographer Elliot Davis, deleted scenes, and &quot;Behind the Scenes of A Love Song for Bobby Long&quot; with cast and crew interviews.

<text>Otago Boys&#x27; High School (OBHS) is a secondary school in Dunedin, New Zealand. It is one of New Zealand&#x27;s oldest boys&#x27; secondary schools. Originally known as Dunedin High School, it was founded on 3 August 1863 and moved to its present site in 1885. The main building was designed by Robert Lawson and is regarded as one of the finest Gothic revival structures in the country. Situated on high ground above central Dunedin it commands excellent views of the city and is a prominent landmark.

Otago Girls&#x27; High School now occupies the original site in Tennyson Street, closer to the centre of the city and is Otago Boys&#x27; sister school.

The school owns a lodge in Mount Aspiring National Park, and has regular field trips for students.
On 24 November 1864, a petition bearing 54 signatures was presented to the New Zealand House of Representatives, seeking official recognition for Dunedin High School&#x27;s cadet corps (the ‘memorialists’) as members of the colonial Volunteer Force. The petition was received by William Reynolds on behalf of the House.

==Building history==
The school opened on its present site in Arthur Street in 1885. The Main Tower Block was designed by Robert Lawson and built for £14,800 in blue stone, Port Chalmers breccia and Oamaru stone by W A Carlton. It has long been regarded as a fine design and is listed as a Category I Historic Place.

The foundation rector, Thomas Campbell, was a graduate of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and headmaster of Wolverhampton Grammar School. He arrived with his family in Deborah Bay on 3 July 1863, and took the steamer &quot;Pride of Yarra&quot; for Dunedin the following day. The steamer collided with the &quot;Favorite&quot; off Kilgour Point, and sank with the loss of 13 lives, among them the entire Campbell party, consisting of Thomas Campbell, his wife, five children aged 5 weeks to 5 years, and their two servants.

Two other masters were appointed at the same time as Campbell. The English master was George P. Abram, a Senior Scholar and Prizeman of Clare College, Cambridge, and Second Master of Wolverhampton Grammar School. Daniel Brent, a Senior Scholar and Prizeman of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, and a Mathematical master of Tonbridge School, was appointed Mathematical Master. After Mr Campbell&#x27;s death, Abram filled in as principal until another appointment could be made.

The school opened 3 August 1863 with Abram as principal and a roll of 80 pupils. In May 1864, the Reverend F. C. Simmons, of Lincoln College, Oxford, and Head-master of the Dundee Proprietary School, arrived to take up the position of Rector.

Increasing roll numbers from 1903 led to the opening of the Shand Building in 1914, designed by Edmund Anscombe. He was also responsible for the Rectory, 1913, the principal&#x27;s onsite residence. The Shand Building, originally called &quot;Shand Hall&quot; cost 3,600 pounds. The following year it was extended to a design by Harry Mandeno (1879–1972). A memorial arch at the entrance to the grounds, built in blue stone and Oamaru stone and designed by Leslie Coombs (1885–1952) was unveiled in 1923. In 1920 the Fulton Building provided six additional classrooms, but this has since been replaced with the gymnasium complex and rehoused swimming pool designed by E.J. Ted McCoy as part of the later major restoration and redevelopment of the school&#x27;s buildings.
There is a teaching block, named after a former Rector, Mr. W.J. Morrell, which was erected in 1961 to a standard Ministry of Works design, though contextualised with blue stone fascias by the architect Ian R McAllum. A grandstand with similar fascias on its rearward elevation forms part of a quadrangle, with the Morrell building, behind the Lawson building. This was also designed by McAllum and built from 1962 to 1963. It has a cantilevered, multiple-gabled canopy added in 1964. Specialist science laboratories designed by Angus Black were constructed in 1967 and were named after the pioneering plastic surgeon Sir Archibald McIndoe, an Old Boy of the school. Mr D J MacLachlan, Rector from 1963 to 1985, worked tirelessly for the construction of the main teaching block which now bears his name.

This is part of the major restoration and redevelopment which saw the refurbishment of the Main Tower Block, the central feature of which is the Maurice Joel Theatre. It also involved the construction of several large new buildings, forming a new quadrangle around the former Green in the greatest expansion of the complex since the 1880s. This considerable undertaking, designed by E.J. Ted McCoy was completed in 1983.

The new buildings, though unmistakably Modernist, nevertheless sit very comfortably with the old. Where Lawson&#x27;s tower block is an exemplary composition in the Scottish Baronial style, taking its inspiration from the 16th-century tower houses and reading something like a toy fort or a castle to a modern eye, McCoy&#x27;s blue stone aggregate and fair face concrete echo its materials while the new complex&#x27;s gun slot windows are a playful reference to the Maginot line which echoes the old building&#x27;s military theme. The new buildings are also very modestly set below the old so the latter take visual pre-eminence from a distance. The project won the architect a National Award from the New Zealand Institute of Architects. It has also been pointed to as an example of his unusual ability to mix the emphatically old with the unashamedly new.

<doc id="1195558" wikidata="Q265910" url="?curid=1195558" title="Hype!">
<text>Hype! (1996) is a documentary directed by Doug Pray about the popularity of grunge rock in the early to mid-1990s United States. It incorporates interviews and rare concert footage to trace the development of the grunge scene from its early beginning in neighborhood basements to its emergence as an explosive pop culture phenomenon. &quot;Hype!&quot; attempts to dispel some of the myths of the genre promulgated by media hype by depicting the grunge subculture from the point of view of people who were active in the scene. The film generally portrays this mythos in a satirical way while acknowledging that it was media hype that helped propel some of these obscure bands to fame.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1996. It opened in two theaters (one in New York and one in Seattle) on November 8.

==Reception==
The film holds a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews with an average rating of 7.5/10.

==Appearances==
&quot;Hype!&quot; includes interviews and performances from bands (primarily oriented with the Sub Pop Records axis) such as TAD, Blood Circus, Mudhoney, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Coffin Break, The Gits, Love Battery, Flop, The Melvins, Some Velvet Sidewalk, Mono Men, Supersuckers, Zipgun, Seaweed, Pearl Jam, 7 Year Bitch, Hovercraft, Gas Huffer, and Fastbacks. It also features interviews with band manager Susan Silver, record producers Jack Endino and Steve Fisk, and photographer Charles Peterson.

Along with the DVD that comes with Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, it is one of the few films to contain video footage of Nirvana&#x27;s first performance of their breakthrough hit, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.

In the film, Seattle producer/engineer Jack Endino is humorously referred to as &quot;the godfather of grunge.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

Sub Pop released a soundtrack to the film in 1996 on CD and a limited box set on colored 7&quot; vinyl. [ AMG entry]

<text>is a Japanese singer. As a teenager under the Sony Music Japan label, she had four top-ten albums, two of which reached number one. Her singles were used as theme songs for animated shows such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Seed&quot;, &quot;Gundam Seed Destiny&quot;, and &quot;D. Gray-man&quot;, as well as being representative of the J-Pop music trend. She has various commercial tie-ins with the anime and games industry, and has also performed in stage musicals and a movie.

== Career ==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1999, Tamaki attended dance school and learned how to perform on stage. She auditioned for Sony Music Japan in 2001 when she was thirteen years old where she performed cover songs of the Destiny&#x27;s Child hit &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Full Moon Prayer&quot; by Core of Soul. She was selected out of 1,000 applicants and started her career in 2003 with her debut single &quot;Believe&quot; which was an opening song for the anime &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Seed&quot;. Her follow-up single, &quot;Realize&quot;, was also used in the series. The popularity of the Gundam franchise, and the inclusion of her work within it, helped her gain immediate popularity as a singer. Her first concert performance was opening for T.M.Revolution at the Pacific Media Expo in 2004. She released her first studio album, &quot;Greeting&quot;, and was hailed as a J-pop princess.

She graduated from high school in March 2007. Her first greatest hits album was released on November 29, 2006 to mark the event, and she soon began an acting and stage performing career. Her first Japanese tour, &quot;Nami Tamaki Best Concert &#x27;My Graduation&#x27;&quot; took place in March 2007.

=== Record label transfer &amp; &quot;nami&quot; ===
In 2008, Nami&#x27;s live events were in full motion. Nami&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stay&quot;, was released on April 23, 2008, containing songs from her singles &quot;Brightdown&quot;, &quot;Cross Season&quot;, and &quot;Winter Ballades&quot;, as well as some new tracks. The album did not chart or sell as well as her previous albums. Coinciding with the release, Nami held a special live tour &quot;Anniversary Live 5,&quot; which took place in Tokyo and Osaka. A lengthy period with a lack of new material followed after the album&#x27;s release, although Nami remained occupied with various concerts. Speculation and rumors surfaced about Nami leaving Sony Music Japan to join another record label. During a live performance on September 22, 2008 at &quot;Girls Entertainment vol.1&quot;, Nami confirmed the transfer but could not give further details.

The September 2008 monthly issue of her fanclub magazine, &quot;Amour Fan Club&quot;, released an official confirmation about the transfer, stating that Nami would be transferring to Universal Music Japan.

Amour Fan Club Manager states:

Debut 5th Year Anniversary was welcomed, Nami moves forward with a jump for her record company transfer to UNIVERSAL-J from Sony Music Records. Currently, we are earnestly working with the new system. Release time is undecided, but until settlement of assurance we will notify you.

Please continue to support Nami chan !! 

On January 15, 2009, Nami&#x27;s official website announced the release of &quot;Give Me Up&quot;, her first single under the Universal-J label and her 16th career single. The single features a more positive upbeat sound compared to her previous singles.

After the somewhat successful release of &quot;Give Me Up&quot; in January 2009, Nami continued to release new music with the singles &quot;Friends!&quot;, &quot;Moshimo Negai ga...&quot;, and &quot;Omoide ni naru no?&quot;. Universal-J also gave Nami Tamaki the stage name &quot;nami&quot;, as opposed to using her full name in kanji. Her first album under Universal-J, &quot;Step&quot;, was released on February 24, 2010.

In late 2011, Nami made her second record label transfer to Teichiku Records, a sublabel of Victor Entertainment. Her first two singles with Teichiku Records, &quot;Lady Mind&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot;, were produced by Shinichi Osawa. Her third single with the label, &quot;Real&quot;, was released on April 17, 2013. The single included a remake of &quot;Believe&quot; in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of her debut. The title song was produced by nishi-ken, who collaborated with Nami previously for her albums &quot;Speciality&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stay&quot;.

=== Anime and game industry ===
Nami has a relatively close relationship with the ACG (Anime, Comics, Game) industry, as she contributed to several ACG franchises with her music. Well-known examples of her contributions include those in the &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; franchise (&quot;Realize&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;Reason&quot;, &quot;Result&quot; and &quot;IDentity&quot;), &quot;Brightdown&quot;, an opening song for the anime series &quot;D.Gray-man&quot;, and &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, an opening song for the anime series &quot;Kiba&quot;.

She also performed the song &quot;Fortune&quot; as the main theme for the PS2 role-playing game &quot;Radiata Stories&quot; (as well as having a cameo appearance in the Japanese version of the game itself), and &quot;CASTAWAY&quot; as the theme song for a GBA turn-based strategy game, &quot;Super Robot Wars J&quot;. The release of &quot;CASTAWAY&quot; also featured a cover of the famous theme song &quot;Get Wild&quot; from the anime &quot;City Hunter&quot;, originally performed by TM Network.

Nami&#x27;s 16th single, &quot;Give Me Up&quot;, was used as the theme song for the anime &quot;Yatterman&quot;. Another song, &quot;Negai Hoshi&quot;, which is included in her 17th single, is the theme song for the new Wii RPG, &quot;Arc Rise Fantasia&quot;, while her 18th single, &quot;Moshimo Negai ga...&quot; is also the theme song for another Wii RPG, &quot;Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga&quot;. Both games were released by Marvelous Entertainment.

=== Health ===

In 2014, Nami announced that she had become frustrated as she was having trouble singing her songs. She then went on to state that she had been struggling with sinitus since a young age and had regularly been receiving treatment, but decided to get surgery to fix the problem. Once recovered, she said that she felt good and no longer had problems. However, in 2015 she was diagnosed with vocal nodules as she had been having pain while singing once again. Tamaki stated that she would be receiving treatment during her current activities and that her plans for her upcoming musical would continue as planned. Due to her condition, she had to cut back her performance set-list while promoting for Everlasting Love.

<text>Kleinwelka (Sorbian: &quot;Mały Wjelkow&quot;) is a subdivision of the city of Bautzen, Germany. It was first mentioned in 1345. Since the mid-18th century it has been the site of a settlement congregation of the Moravian Church, the Herrnhuter Brüdergemeinde; for many years it was the seat of a boarding school for the children of missionaries from all over the world.

Kleinwelka is a station of the Osterreiten, a regional Easter procession on horseback, from Bautzen to Radibor.

Its main sites of interest are the Saurierpark Kleinwelka and the adjacent &quot;Irrgarten&quot; (hedge maze).

<doc id="1195577" wikidata="Q913628" url="?curid=1195577" title="Lacrimal gland">
<text>The lacrimal glands are paired exocrine glands, one for each eye, found in most terrestrial vertebrates and some marine mammals, that secrete the aqueous layer of the tear film. In humans, they are situated in the upper lateral region of each orbit, in the lacrimal fossa of the orbit formed by the frontal bone. Inflammation of the lacrimal glands is called dacryoadenitis. The lacrimal gland produces tears which are secreted by the lacrimal ducts, and flow over the ocular surface, and then into canals that connect to the lacrimal sac. From that sac, the tears drain through the lacrimal duct into the nose.

Anatomists divide the gland into two sections, a palpebral lobe, or portion, and an orbital lobe or portion. The smaller &quot;palpebral lobe&quot; lies close to the eye, along the inner surface of the eyelid; if the upper eyelid is everted, the palpebral portion can be seen.

The orbital lobe of the gland, contains fine interlobular ducts that connect the orbital lobe and the palpebral lobe. They unite to form three to five main secretory ducts, joining five to seven ducts in the palpebral portion before the secreted fluid may enter on the surface of the eye. Tears secreted collect in the fornix conjunctiva of the upper lid, and pass over the eye surface to the lacrimal puncta, small holes found at the inner corner of the eyelids. These pass the tears through the lacrimal canaliculi on to the lacrimal sac, in turn to the nasolacrimal duct, which dumps them out into the nose.

Lacrimal glands are also present in other mammals, including horses.

==Structure==
===Histology===
The lacrimal gland is a compound tubuloacinar gland, it is made up of many lobules separated by connective tissue, each lobule contains many acini. The acini composed of large serous cells which, produce a watery serous secretion, serous cells are filled with lightly stained secretory granules and surrounded by well-developed myoepithelial cells and a sparse, vascular stroma.
Each acinus consists of a grape-like mass of &quot;lacrimal gland cells&quot; with their apices pointed to a central lumen.

The central lumen of many of the units converge to form intralobular ducts, and then they unite to form interlobular ducts. The gland lacks striated ducts.

===Blood supply===
The lacrimal gland receives blood from the lacrimal artery, which is a branch of the ophthalmic artery. Blood from the gland drains to the superior ophthalmic vein.

===Lymphatic drainage===
No lymphatic vessels have been observed draining the lacrimal gland.

===Nerve supply===
The lacrimal gland is innervated by the lacrimal nerve, which is the smallest branch of the ophthalmic nerve, itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). After the lacrimal nerve branches from the ophthalmic nerve it receives a communicating branch from the zygomatic nerve. This communicating branch carries postganglionic parasympathetic axons from the pterygopalatine ganglion. The lacrimal nerve passes anteriorly in the orbit and through the lacrimal gland providing parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation to it. 

==== Parasympathetic innervation ====
The parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland is a complex pathway which traverses through numerous structures in the head. Ultimately this two-neuron pathway involving both a preganglionic and postganglionic parasympathetic neuron increases the secretion of lacrimal fluid from the lacrimal gland. The preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are located in the superior salivatory nucleus. They project axons which exit the brainstem as part of the facial nerve (CN VII). Within the facial canal at the geniculate ganglion the axons branch from the facial nerve forming the greater petrosal nerve. This nerve exits the facial canal through the hiatus for the greater petrosal nerve in the petrous part of the temporal bone. It emerges to the middle cranial fossa and travels anteromedially to enter the foramen lacerum. Within the foramen lacerum it joins to the deep petrosal nerve to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal and then passes through this canal. It emerges in the pterygopalatine fossa and enters the pterygopalatine ganglion where the preganglionic parasympathetic axons synapse with the postganglionic parasympathetic neurons. The postganglionic neurons then send axons which travel with the zygomatic nerve to enter the inferior orbital fissure. As the zygomatic nerve travels anteriorly in the orbit it sends a communicating branch to the lacrimal nerve which carries the postganglionic parasympathetic axons. The lacrimal nerve completes this long pathway by travelling through the lacrimal gland and sending branches to which it provides parasympathetic innervation to increase the secretion of lacrimal fluid.
==== Sympathetic innervation ====
Sympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland is of less physiologic importance than the parasympathetic innervation, however there are noradrenergic axons found within the lacrimal gland. Their cell bodies are located in the superior cervical ganglion.

==Clinical significance==
In contrast to the normal moisture of the eyes or even crying, there can be persistent dryness, scratching, itchiness and burning in the eyes, which are signs of dry eye syndrome (DES) or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). With this syndrome, the lacrimal glands produce less lacrimal fluid, which mainly occurs with aging or certain medications. The Schirmer test, conducted by placing a thin strip of filter paper at the edge of the eye, can be used to determine the level of dryness of the eye. Many medications or diseases that cause dry eye syndrome can also cause hyposalivation with xerostomia. Treatment varies according to aetiology and includes avoidance of exacerbating factors, tear stimulation and supplementation, increasing tear retention, eyelid cleansing, and treatment of eye inflammation.

In addition, the following can be associated with lacrimal gland pathology:
* Dacryoadenitis
*Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome

<doc id="1195581" wikidata="Q4876990" url="?curid=1195581" title="Beat the Geeks">
<text>Beat the Geeks is an American television game show that aired on Comedy Central from 2001 to 2002. The show was rerun on The Comedy Network in Canada.

On the show, contestants face off in trivia matches against a panel of three resident &quot;geeks&quot; who are well-versed in music, movies, and television, as well as a fourth guest geek with an alternate area of expertise which varies from episode to episode. The object is to outsmart the geek at their own subject; as a handicap, the geeks are given questions of considerably greater difficulty than the contestants. &quot;Beat the Geeks&quot; was taped at the Hollywood Center Studios in Hollywood, California.

==Rules==
===First round===
In the first season, the three contestants competed against each other to answer eight toss-up questions, two from each category; the geeks did not play in this round. The first four questions (one per category) were worth 5 points each, and the second four were worth 10 points each. Occasionally, the geeks would give a fact after the question.

In the second season, four pairs of questions were asked, one in each geek&#x27;s category. The first question of each pair was a toss-up among the contestants, worth 10 points. The contestant who answered correctly then played the second toss-up against the relevant Geek. If the contestant answered correctly or if the Geek missed, the contestant scored 10 points; if the contestant missed or if the geek answered correctly, the contestant lost 5 points.

In both seasons, the lowest scorer at the end of the round was eliminated. In the event of a tie for low score, a question with a numerical answer was asked and the contestants wrote down their guesses. The one who came closer to the correct answer without going over remained in the game; if both were over, the closer guess won.

===Second round===
The remaining two contestants each play a head-to-head challenge against the geek of their choice in order to win the geek&#x27;s medal. In season 1, if the contestants begin the round tied, they are asked a toss-up question to determine who plays first. In season 2, the winner of a coin toss during a commercial break determined who plays first. Otherwise, the player with the most points started. Once a geek has lost that medal to a contestant, that geek cannot be challenged again until the final round.

====Season 1====
In the first season, four questions are asked, alternating between the contestant and the geek, whose questions are much more difficult. If the geek gives a wrong answer, the contestant wins the challenge, scores points, and gets to wear the geek&#x27;s medal for the rest of the game. If the contestant misses a question, the challenge ends and the opponent may score 10 points by giving the correct answer. On occasion, if a challenge ends due to the contestant missing the question, the challenged geek will be asked the more difficult question to show off.

If all four questions are answered correctly, a &quot;geek-off&quot; is played to decide the challenge. The player must name as many items in a given category as possible in 15 seconds; the geek must then do the same in a much harder category. If the geek cannot come up with more answers, the contestant wins the challenge, with ties going to the contestant.

Resident geeks&#x27; medals are worth 20 points each, while a guest geek&#x27;s medal awards 30.

====Season 2====
A maximum of four questions were asked, as in season 1, but when the contestant missed a question the geek must answer it correctly to win the challenge; the opponent does not get a chance to score from a missed question. A miss by the geek still results in a victory for the contestant. If both sides miss the same questions or if all four questions are asked, a &quot;geek-off&quot; is played. On occasion, if the geek ends the challenge by answering the contestant&#x27;s question correctly, they are given the harder question to show off.

Resident and guest geek medals award 20 and 40 points, respectively.

===Third round===
The third round starts with two more head-to-head challenges, and the trailing player, or the coin toss winner in the event of a tie starts. Gameplay is the same as in the second round, with all medals worth 20 more points (40/50 in season 1, 40/60 in season 2).

After these challenges are over, the &quot;geek-qualizer&quot; is played to decide a winner with the trailing contestant going first; in the event of a tie, the coin toss winner decides to go first or second. A list of titles is read to the contestant, who must decide whether each is related to movies, music, or TV. The list continues until the contestant gives an incorrect answer, fails to answer within two seconds, or exhausts the list. Then, if they have tied or exceeded their opponent&#x27;s score, their opponent plays their own geek-qualizer round with the same rules. The player with the most points after the geek-qualizer advances to the final round. If there is a tie, a numerical tiebreaker question is asked; the winner is the player who comes closer to the correct answer without going over. When a contestant&#x27;s turn is over, the geek that relates to the last title read explains it. Correct answers are worth 10 points each, with a maximum of 15 items in season 1, and 16 in season 2.

===Final round===
In the final round, the contestant chooses one of the four geeks to challenge. The contestant and geek alternate questions, beginning with the contestant. Each turn, the host gives a category, then the player chooses whether to answer a 1-point (easiest), 2-point (harder), or 3-point (hardest) question; the Geek may not choose a point value lower than the contestant&#x27;s previous question. If answered correctly, they earn the number of points chosen; otherwise there is no penalty. The first player to reach 7 points wins; if the contestant wins they are awarded $5,000 worth of prizes related to the category of geek they challenged for the final round.

<text>Staverton is a village and civil parish in the south-west of Northamptonshire, England. It is 2.3 miles west of Daventry, 7.9 miles east of Southam and 15.3 miles east of Leamington Spa. It straddles the A425 road from Daventry to Leamington. The Jurassic Way long-distance footpath between Banbury and Stamford passes through the village.

The village sits on the edge of an escarpment and has views westward across the valley of the River Leam into the neighbouring county of Warwickshire. Both the Malvern and Shropshire hills are visible on fine days.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Stake farm/settlement&#x27;, either set apart by such or where they were made or acquired.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Staverton is mentioned as &quot;Stavertone&quot;.

Before the early part of the 18th century, the original village was located behind the church. However, in 1720 a fire broke out which caused damage, destroying many haystacks, stables, grain stores and 22 houses. The total loss was thought to be around £3,000. The result of this was that the village received, via a bequest from Elizabeth Darby, a fire engine. This came into commission in 1767, was kept in the village until quite recently and was later housed at the Daventry museum. A plaque can be seen on a door opposite the village green to this effect.

The village has a manor house, situated at the end of Manor Road and thought to have parts originating possibly from Anglo-Saxon times. It is only one of many examples of vernacular architecture in the village. There is an interesting window detail at &quot;The Stables&quot; in Manor Road. A datestone above the window reads R.R. 1684.

Within the village, Well Lane runs parallel to the main A425. It has been conjectured that this was a much earlier approach to the village. The deeply banked sides to the lane bear testimony to it being an ancient right of way. Possibly, with the increase in coaching traffic from the west, the present A425 route was chosen in preference.

Along the western boundary of the parish runs the now-disused railway, the last mainline railway to be built in Britain. It was constructed by the Great Central Railway Company between 1894 and 1899 and ran from Nottingham Victoria to London Marylebone. A mission was established for the navvies in the village in a barn situated on the corner of Manor Road and Glebe Lane. This is now part of a private residence.

==Geography==
The average elevation of the parish is 700 ft above sea level, and approximately 1.5 miles south of the village is Arbury Hill, which, at 225 m (738 ft), is the highest point in Northamptonshire. On the summit, evidence of an Iron Age hill fort of an unusually square shape is plainly seen. The River Nene rises nearby. The Jurassic Way and the Three Rivers Circular Walk pass through the parish.

==Demography==
Staverton parish had a population of 468 at the 2001 census, reducing slightly to 458 at the 2011 Census.

==Landmarks==
 St Mary the Virgin has been a site of Christian worship for well over a thousand years, although the first recorded vicar appears in records started in 1220. A board inside the church lists all subsequent vicars up to the present incumbent. The present church dates from about 1300 with some older parts. For hundreds of years before this, possibly dating back to before 800 AD, a burial ground existed on the site - as evidenced by the raised churchyard. The main structure that can be seen today dates mainly from the 14th century, although traces of older architecture still remain, such as the lancet window in the north-west corner, which is from the Norman period.

The church has many original architectural and historic features. From the top of the tower, sitting on top of one of the highest points in Northamptonshire, it is said that if one were able to travel eastwards maintaining the same altitude, one would not touch land again until reaching the Urals. The ‘new’ north porch, used as the main entrance into the church, dates back 600 years, whereas the south porch is 100 years older. The original door and roof timbers remain. The church has a peal of six bells cast in 1938 by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough. The vicar from 1933 to 1946, Rev. E.S. Powell, initiated the bell restoration; he and his wife were active bellringers.

==Transport==
There is a bus service 65 between Leamington-Southam-Banbury, operated by Stagecoach in Warwickshire from Monday to Saturday. The closest railway is the West Midlands Trains service from Long Buckby station on the Northampton loop of the West Coast Main Line. Nearby Northampton and Rugby stations are served by Avanti West Coast services, while Chiltern Railways. CrossCountry and West Midlands Trains trains can be joined at Leamington Spa or Banbury.

==Amenities==
There is one public house, &quot;The Countryman&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;New Inn&quot;. Former Staverton pubs included &quot;The Windmill&quot; in Windmill Lane and &quot;The Crown&quot;, now a private house, opposite The Green. Across the road from the pub, there is a garage. There is a garden centre on the Badby Road out of the village. East of the village on the Daventry road is De Vere Staverton Estate, a hotel where the facilities include an indoor leisure complex and an 18-hole golf course and driving range.

The first mention of a post office in the village was in 1864, but the post office closed in March 2008.

<doc id="1195607" wikidata="Q8792" url="?curid=1195607" title="Strehla">
<text>Strehla (, ) is a small town in the district of Meißen, Saxony, Germany. It is located on the river Elbe, north of Riesa. This place name means &quot;arrow&quot; in Sorbian. Strehla includes the following subdivisions: 
*Forberge
*Görzig/Trebnitz
*Großrügeln
*Lößnig
*Oppitzsch
*Paußnitz
*Unterreußen

==History==
Strehla was first mentioned in 1002, when its castle was set on fire by Polish King Boleslaw I, on his way back to Poland from a meeting with German King Henry; starting the German-Polish War of 1002–1018. During this war, Strehla went back and forth between Polish and German rule. It is situated on the Via Regia Lusatiae Superioris (Royal road of Upper Lusatia), which connected Görlitz to Leipzig. The castle of Strehla belonged to the Pflugk family from the 14th century until 1945. The Battle of Strehla between Austria and Prussia took place around the town during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

Strehla is also regarded as the point towards the end of World War II where troops of the Western Allies heading East first encountered Soviet troops heading West, at 11:30am on April 25, 1945, when Lieutenant Albert Kotzebue of the 69th Infantry Division (United States) encountered a Russian on horseback at nearby Leckwitz, later identified as a trooper of a Soviet Guards rifle regiment.

The later encounter on the same day at 4:40 p.m. in Torgau, about twenty miles to the north, would go into history books as the official link-up.

<doc id="1195622" wikidata="Q2321038" url="?curid=1195622" title="Spratton">
<text>Spratton is a village and civil parish in the English county of Northamptonshire. The local government authority is West Northamptonshire. Before changes in 2021 it was governed by Daventry District Council. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 1,099 people, increasing to 1,150 at the 2011 Census. Spratton is 7.1 miles north of Northampton, 6.5 miles from Long Buckby and 11.4 miles from Daventry. The village is situated on the A5199 road.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Pole farm/settlement&#x27;, either made of poles or perhaps a place where they were made or acquired.

==Landmarks==

===Parish Church===
The parish church of Spratton is dedicated to St Andrew and stands on Brixworth Road. It is over 900 years old and is a Grade I listed building. Parts of the west wall of the church date from the Norman period, along with one of the windows in the church tower and the south door. The ecclesiastical parish is part of the diocese of Peterborough. The church, built from ironstone, stands on high ground in the centre of the village and has a tower with a spire. The chancel is 29 feet long by 15 feet wide. The earliest church built on the site dated from 1120, but it has been altered and remodelled considerably over the centuries. The interior of the church was restored in 1847 by Sir George Gilbert Scott, and the north porch rebuilt. The spire was taken down nearly to the base in 1870 and rebuilt. In the chancel is a fine alabaster effigy of Sir John Swinford who fought alongside the Black Prince and John of Gaunt in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He died in 1371. The great-great-grandmother of George Washington was baptised in the church in 1602. There is a plaque saying this in the church.

===Spratton Hall School===
Spratton Hall is a Grade II listed building. The hall was built in the late 18th century. The hall is now used as an independent co-educational school called Spratton Hall School and was founded by K.C. Hunter and his wife Joan in 1951. There are currently over 400 pupils at the school aged 4–13 years old. Spratton Hall, the largest house in the village, is a Grade II listed building with grounds extending to 50 acres. The house was probably built in 1760 on the site of an earlier farmhouse. Constructed primarily with limestone from Kingsthorpe, it is a plain three-storey structure with a slate roof. Actor Tenniel Evans taught English and drama there for a short time in the early 1950s before returning to theatre. English international rugby union player Matt Dawson was a gap student at Spratton Hall from 1996 to 1997. Michael Ellis MP was educated there. Harry Mallinder (rugby union player) first played rugby there.

==Amenities==
The village has one public house, the &quot;King&#x27;s Head&quot; on Brixworth Road which also operates as a restaurant under the name of &quot;Brasserie 23&quot;. The well-known &quot;Saul&#x27;s the butcher&#x27;s,&quot; established in 1926 on Brixworth Road has now closed and has moved its premises to the farm shop near Chapel Brampton. &quot;Spratton Village Store&quot; is situated on Brixworth Road as is &quot;Dawn Mallard&quot;, Hairdresser.

==Events==
Spratton used to host a folk music festival in July every year but stopped because they lost money 0 years in a row. Bands that have appeared include Capercaillie, Show of Hands, Oysterband and Peatbog Faeries. In addition to the music, there were craft stalls, food, children&#x27;s entertainment and a bar serving real ales and ciders.

==Notable people==
*The Victorian cricketer Charles Studd was born in the village in 1860.
*Amphillis Twigden, the great-great-grandmother of George Washington, first President of the United States, was born in the parish of Spratton at Little Creaton; she was baptised in Spratton Church on 2 February 1602.

<doc id="1195624" wikidata="Q1538063" url="?curid=1195624" title="My Own Prison">
<text>My Own Prison is the debut studio album by American rock band Creed, released in 1997. The album was issued independently by the band&#x27;s record label, Blue Collar Records, on April 14, 1997, and re-released by Wind-up Records on August 26, 1997. Manager Jeff Hanson matched Creed up with John Kurzweg, and &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was recorded for $6,000, funded by Hanson. The band wrote several songs, trying to discover their own identity, and in their early days, the members had jobs, while bassist Brian Marshall got a degree. Creed began recording music and released the album on their own, distributing it to radio stations in Florida. The band later got a record deal with Wind-up.

At the time of &quot;My Own Prison&quot; publication, Creed were compared to several bands, including Soundgarden (especially the &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; era), Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Tool, and Metallica. Influenced by heavy metal and 1970s stadium rock, &quot;My Own Prison&quot; music has been described as grunge, and &quot;slightly heavy metal, slightly alternative&quot;. The album is a lot more heavy and grunge-oriented than Creed&#x27;s subsequent work. Its lyrics include topics like emerging adulthood, Christianity and faith, sinning, suicide, unity, struggling to prosper in life, and race relations in America. Vocalist Scott Stapp and guitarist Mark Tremonti said their early adulthood inspired lyrics to songs like the title track and &quot;Torn&quot;. Stapp was inspired by music by U2 (particularly &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;), Led Zeppelin, and the Doors. Influenced by thrash metal bands like Metallica, Slayer, Exodus, and Forbidden, Tremonti brought heavy metal musical elements into Creed&#x27;s music.

Creed released four singles from the album: the title track, &quot;Torn&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s This Life For&quot;, and &quot;One&quot;. Despite only peaking at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, strong radio airplay propelled &quot;My Own Prison&quot; to become a commercial success. All singles were successful on rock radio in the United States and, with the exception of &quot;One&quot;, had music videos that received airplay on MTV. &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was eventually certified sextuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and, as of 2009, sold over 6,000,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album received reviews ranging from positive to negative, complimenting its guitar riffs and music but criticizing its similarity to 1990s grunge bands.

==Background, writing, recording, and production==
For the band&#x27;s debut release, manager Jeff Hanson matched them up with John Kurzweg, a producer friend who, with his unobtrusive production style and talents as a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, he felt was a great fit. The album, funded by Hanson, was recorded for $6,000. &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was originally released independently on the band&#x27;s own label, Blue Collar Records, in 1997. It was distributed to Florida radio stations, and their enthusiasm for the record helped it sell 6,000 copies in the first two months in Florida alone. Vocalist Scott Stapp said that even though the band was trying to find their creative stride, it took a while for them to discover their musical style. He said in August 2017: &quot;I remember after Mark and I and the guys wrote our first five or seven songs and we hadn&#x27;t found our identity yet. Then we wrote a song called &#x27;Grip My Soul&#x27;, which we never recorded or put out but I remember leaving band rehearsal and all of us felt the same way. Like, alright, we found ourselves. We found out who we are and then right after that is when &#x27;My Own Prison&#x27; poured out of us&quot;. He added: &quot;If I&#x27;m remembering correctly, those were essentially the next 10 out of 13 songs that we wrote after that initial &#x27;find your identity&#x27; moment that I think every band has&quot;. Guitarist Mark Tremonti said that in the band&#x27;s early days, he was working as a cook at Chili&#x27;s and Stapp was a cook at Ruby Tuesday&#x27;s. Drummer Scott Phillips was managing a knife store at a mall and bassist Brian Marshall was the only one without a job, and, according to Tremonti, Marshall &quot;was also the only one who ended up getting his degree before it was all said and done&quot;. When Creed got a record deal, the band got an advance, and Tremonti quit his job and started working for about three weeks at the local guitar shop and then after that, Creed began touring. &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was originally released through Blue Collar Records but was remixed by Wind-up Records and then reissued. Creed recorded the original version of the album in Kurzweg&#x27;s house in Tallahassee, Florida. To record the rest of the album, they went to Long View Farm in North Brookfield, Massachusetts.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;My Own Prison&quot; is a lot heavier and more grunge-oriented than other Creed albums. Its lyrical themes include Christianity, faith, sinning, and The music has been described as grunge, alternative metal, and heavy metal. Jon Parales of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the album to the &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; era of Soundgarden. He also likened the music to Hootie &amp; the Blowfish and the song &quot;Unforgiven&quot; to Metallica. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Creed don&#x27;t have an original or distinctive sound—they basically fall into the category of post-Seattle bands who temper their grunge with a dose of Live earnestness&quot;. In 1997, when &quot;My Own Prison&quot; first brought the band attention from the mainstream, Bradley Bambarger of &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote in December that Creed sound &quot;disconcertingly reminiscent of Alice in Chains&quot;. Justin Seremet of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; wrote in 1998 that Creed &quot;is essentially Alice in Chains without the bite&quot;, comparing singer Stapp&#x27;s vocals to that of the deceased AIC vocalist, Layne Staley. He described the album as &quot;scrunge&quot;, which he defined as &quot;the adopted name for groups that rode the Seattle wave with a couple of hits and subsequently vanished—bands like Silverchair, Sponge, Candlebox, and so on.&quot; In a review of &quot;My Own Prison&quot; from January 1998, &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; described Creed as &quot;slightly heavy metal, slightly alternative&quot;. &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; described the record as being influenced by 1970s stadium rock and wrote that it includes &quot;thundering metallic tracks and sweeping ballads&quot;. In August 2017, Phil Freeman of &quot;Stereogum&quot; wrote:

Stapp was heavily influenced by U2&#x27;s 1987 album, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, as well as by the Doors and Led Zeppelin. The band was frequently compared to Tool, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam, in response to which, Stapp said: &quot;It could be worse. They could be comparing us to some shitty band that no one has ever heard of, rather than the biggest band of the decade.&quot; Likewise, Tremonti stated, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t bother me so much. They&#x27;re one of the best bands to come out in the past 10 years.&quot;

The track &quot;What&#x27;s This Life For&quot; is about a best friend of Tremonti&#x27;s who committed suicide, and the guitarist has described it as &quot;a song about suicide and kids searching for that meaning of life&quot;. &quot;One&quot;, a more catchy and upbeat-sounding track, criticizes society&#x27;s alleged lack of unity. &quot;Torn&quot;, written by Tremonti, is autobiographical. Prior to Creed&#x27;s success, the guitarist held various jobs to pay for college, including washing cars and working as a cook. &quot;One day, I came home from work at about 3 in the morning,&quot; he said. &quot;I was all dirty and stinky and hating my life, so I just wrote a song about what it&#x27;s like being a kid in between 18 and 23, when you haven&#x27;t graduated from school yet and you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing with your life.&quot; He added: &quot;It&#x27;s about how hard that period of time is, when you&#x27;re broke, you have to work two jobs to go to school. I was at a hard point in my life, so I wrote a song about it&quot;.

==Artwork and packaging==
Prior to releasing the album on their own independent label, Creed recruited Daniel Tremonti, Mark&#x27;s brother, to become their creative director. Stapp described Daniel as a &quot;super soulful guy with the heart and talent of a true artist&quot;. They picked a photo that Daniel had taken for a photography class as the cover for the record. The image was of a man named Justin Brown, a friend of the band, depicting him kneeling shirtless in a corner with his hands on top of his head. Stapp claimed the artwork &quot;captured him to the core&quot; and that it reflected the isolation, conflict, and torture that was driving him as well as seeing hope and feeling that he was like the man in the artwork, &quot;who had been beaten down but could now get up&quot;. Looking to have a professional-looking final product, the band acquired a loan from bassist Brian Marshall&#x27;s father and went to a one-stop company to package and manufacture the record. They ordered five thousand copies and took them to major outlets in Tallahassee. All five thousand were sold within the first month.

The original Blue Collar Records version featured the band&#x27;s original logo, a wordmark inside a roundel, situated to the top right just over Justin Brown, with the album title at the bottom. The Wind-up version featured an updated band wordmark logo in a Mason Serif Regular font, now situated on the top left, with the album title just below that, to the right. The band&#x27;s updated logo would go on to become their permanent logo, although the font would eventually become slightly more extended on future releases.

==Promotion, release, and commercial performance==
Creed released four singles from &quot;My Own Prison&quot;: the title track in 1997, &quot;Torn&quot; in early 1998, &quot;What&#x27;s This Life For&quot; later that year, and &quot;One&quot; in early 1999. All four singles had success on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, with all except &quot;Torn&quot; also performing well on Modern Rock Tracks. Because they were not initially sold in the United States, the singles were ineligible for the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. However, by the time &quot;One&quot; was released, that restriction was lifted, and the song became Creed&#x27;s first to chart, reaching number seventy. &quot;My Own Prison&quot; and &quot;One&quot; also managed to peak at numbers 54 and 49 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay, respectively. The videos for the singles also received airplay on MTV. The Blue Collar Records version of &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was released on April 14, 1997, and the Wind-up reissue came out on August 26, 1997. In October 2022, a remaster of &quot;My Own Prison&quot; on vinyl was announced in celebration of the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary. It was issued through Craft Recordings on December 2, 2022.

&quot;My Own Prison&quot; peaked at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on May 2, 1998, staying on the chart for 112 weeks. The album also peaked at number one on the Heatseekers Albums chart on November 8, 1997. On January 22, 2000, the album reached number one on the Catalog Albums chart, remaining there for 157 weeks. &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on August 25, 1998. It went triple platinum on February 26, 1999, 4× platinum on November 3, 1999, 5× platinum on December 4, 2000, and on August 26, 2002. On January 2, 1998, MTV reported that the album had sold 175,000 copies in the United States. On September 18, 1998, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;My Own Prison&quot; had sold 2,200,000 copies nationally. &quot;Time&quot; reported on October 18, 1999, that the record had sold nearly 4,000,000 copies. On January 3, 2002, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that, according to Nielsen SoundScan, &quot;My Own Prison&quot; sold 5,700,000 copies in the US. &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was certified sextuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on August 26, 2002, for selling 6,000,000 copies. As of 2009, the album had sold more than 6,000,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. &quot;My Own Prison&quot; sold 15,000,000 copies worldwide, making it one of the most successful debut albums of all time.

==Critical reception==
&quot;My Own Prison&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. AllMusic wrote: &quot;Creed don&#x27;t have an original or distinctive sound—they basically fall into the category of post-Seattle bands who temper their grunge with a dose of Live earnestness—but they work well within their boundaries. At their best, they are a solid post-grunge band, grinding their riffs out with muscle; at their worst, they are simply faceless. The best moments of &quot;My Own Prison&quot; suggest they&#x27;ll be able to leave post-grunge anonymity behind and develop their own signature sound.&quot; Trevor Miller of Music Critic described the album as &quot;overall, an excellent first album&quot;.

Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, with an article entitled &quot;Grunge Gets Religion, and It&#x27;s Not Pretty&quot;, criticized &quot;My Own Prison&quot; and wrote: &quot;Convictions aside, Creed&#x27;s weakness is its music. The band&#x27;s imitation of Soundgarden circa 1991 is a clumsy one.&quot; &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; wrote: &quot;I like the CD. I like the band, but there is room for improvement.&quot; Justin Seremet of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; panned &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, stating: &quot;Just as the Warrants and Slaughters of the world hung around long after their brand of music had gone to the grave, so will Creed. Let&#x27;s move on, folks.&quot;

<text>Scaldwell is a village and civil parish in the West, Northamptonshire, England.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;spring/stream which is shallow&#x27;.
Scaldwell is tiny and has neither shops nor pubs; at the time of the 2001 census the parish had a population of 271 living in 113 households, increasing to 302 in 2011 and 304 in 2020. It has an ageing population. The nearest place for school, shop or pub is Brixworth. Scaldwell has a church dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul.

It has a Norman tower and some 13th century-features and was restored in 1863. The village has a traditional green and was mentioned in the Domesday Book.

== Ironstone quarrying and the Scaldwell Tramway ==
The Staveley Coal and Iron Company operated a number of ironstone quarries around the villages of Brixworth, Hanging Houghton and Scaldwell from 1912 until 1963. The first pits lay to the east of the Scaldwell to Brixworth Road close to Scaldwell, and began producing ore in April 1913.

Two separate gauge tramways transported ore from the quarries, one serving the Hanging Houghton pits. The second, longer tramway ran from pits east of Scaldwell to a depot north of the village. An aerial ropeway connected the two tramways to sidings on the Market Harborough to Northampton railway line. The pits were originally hand-worked, but in 1933 steam dragline excavators were introduced, which made the quarrying faster and more efficient.

In 1914, new pits were opened near Grange Farm, a mile south of Scaldwell and the Scaldwell tramway was extended to serve them. New ore fields were leased south of Brixworth in 1939 and the tramway was further extended to reach them. The Brixworth pits continued in production until 1949 when they were abandoned and the tramway extension removed.

During the Second World War, a new standard gauge branch line was laid to the Hanging Houghton quarries. Ore from those quarries was no longer carried by the aerial ropeway. The branch was extended to Scaldwell in 1954, and the aerial ropeway was abandoned. Ore was tipped from narrow to standard gauge wagons at Scaldwell. The final ironstone pits in use were a mile and a half southeast of Scaldwell at New Grange Farm. These ceased working in December 1962 and the entire system was abandoned. The narrow-gauge tramway and standard-gauge branch were removed by 1964, and the remaining pits were landscaped and returned to agricultural use.

The final ironstone quarrying near Scaldwell was in the northern pit close to Lamport village. Diesel and electric quarrying machines were used and it was served by the standard-gauge tramway. It closed in 1963.

The narrow-gauge tramways used steam locomotives throughout the time they operated. The Peckett locomotive &quot;Scaldwell&quot; was purchased by the Narrow Gauge Railway Society when the tramway closed and moved to the Brockham Railway Museum for preservation.

<doc id="1195631" wikidata="Q402145" url="?curid=1195631" title="Mataram Sultanate">
<text>The Sultanate of Mataram () was the last major independent Javanese kingdom on the island of Java before it was colonised by the Dutch. It was the dominant political force radiating from the interior of Central Java from the late 16th century until the beginning of the 18th century.

Mataram reached its peak of power during the reign of Sultan Agung Anyokrokusumo (), and began to decline after his death in 1645. By the mid-18th century, Mataram lost both power and territory to the Dutch East India Company (Dutch: &quot;Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie&quot;; &quot;VOC&quot;). It had become a vassal state of the company by 1749.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Mataram&quot; itself was never the official name of any polity, as the Javanese often refer to their realm simply as &quot;Bhumi Jawa&quot; or &quot;Tanah Jawi&quot; (). &quot;Mataram&quot; refers to the historical areas of plains south of Mount Merapi around present-day Muntilan, Sleman, Yogyakarta, and Prambanan. More precisely, it refers to the Kota Gede area, the capital of the Sultanate on the outskirts of southern Yogyakarta.

A common practice in Java is to refer to their kingdom by metonymy, specifically by the location of its capital. Historically, there were two kingdoms that have existed in this region and both are called &quot;Mataram&quot;. The later kingdom, however, is often called &quot;Mataram Islam&quot; or &quot;Mataram Sultanate&quot; to distinguish it from the Hindu-Buddhist 9th-century Kingdom of Mataram.

==Historiography==
The key sources to uncover the history of the Mataram Sultanate are local Javanese historical accounts called &quot;Babad&quot;, and Dutch accounts by the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The problems with traditional Javanese &quot;Babad&quot;, are that they are often undated, obscure and incorporate non-historic, mythological and fantastic elements because these Javanese historical accounts were used as a tool to legitimize the authority of the ruler. An example of a mythical element is the sacred bonds between Panembahan Senapati with mythical Ratu Kidul, the ruler of Java&#x27;s Southern Seas as his spiritual consort, as claimed in the Babad Tanah Jawi.

The dates for events before the Siege of Batavia during the reign of Sultan Agung, the third king of Mataram, are difficult to determine. There are several annals used by H.J. de Graaf in his histories such as Babad Sangkala and Babad Momana which contain list of events and dates from the Javanese calendar (A.J., Anno Javanicus), but besides de Graaf&#x27;s questionable practice of simply adding 78 to Javanese years to obtain corresponding Christian years, the agreement between Javanese sources themselves is also less than perfect.

The Javanese sources are very selective in putting dates to events. Events such as the rise and fall of &quot;kratons&quot; (palaces), the deaths of important princes, great wars, etc. are the only kind of events deemed important enough to be dated, by using a poetic formula chronogram called &quot;candrasengkala&quot;, which can be expressed verbally and pictorially, the rest being simply described in narrative succession without dates. Again these &quot;candrasengkalas&quot; do not always match the annals.

Therefore, the following rule of thumb is suggested: the dates from de Graaf and Ricklefs for the period before the Siege of Batavia can be accepted as best-guesses. For the period after the Siege of Batavia (1628–29) until the first War of Succession (1704), the years of events in which foreigners participated can be accepted as certain, but – again – are not always consistent with Javanese versions of the story. The events in the period 1704–1755 can be dated with greater certainty since, in this period, the Dutch interfered deeply in Mataram affairs but events behind kraton walls are, in general, difficult to date precisely.

==History==

===Formation and Growth===
====Establishment of the Kingdom====
Details in Javanese sources about the early years of the kingdom are limited, and the line is unclear between the historical record and myths since there are indications of the efforts by later rulers, especially Agung, to establish a long line of legitimate descent by inventing predecessors. However, by the time more reliable records begin in the mid-17th century the kingdom was so large and powerful that most historians concur it had already been established for several generations.

According to Javanese records, the kings of Mataram were descended from one Ki Ageng Sela (Sela is a village near the present-day Demak). In the 1570s, one of Ki Ageng Sela&#x27;s descendants, &quot;Kyai&quot; Gedhe Pamanahan was awarded rule of the land of Mataram by the King of Pajang, Sultan Hadiwijaya, as the reward for his service of defeating Arya Panangsang, Hadiwijaya&#x27;s enemy. Pajang was located near the current site of Surakarta, and Mataram was originally a vassal of Pajang. Pamanahan was often referred to as Kyai Gedhe Mataram. A &quot;kyai&quot; is a Muslim cleric who is well educated and tend to be well-respected.

Meanwhile, in Pajang, there were major power struggles that took place after the death of Sultan Hadiwijaya in 1582. Hadiwijaya&#x27;s heir, &quot;Pangeran&quot; (Prince) Benowo, was ousted by Arya Pangiri of Demak, and was removed to Jipang. Pamanahan&#x27;s son, Sutawijaya or Panembahan Senapati Ingalaga, replaced his father around 1584, and he began to release Mataram from Pajang&#x27;s control. Under Sutawijaya, Mataram grew substantially through military campaigns against Mataram&#x27;s overlord of Pajang and Pajang&#x27;s former overlord, Demak. The new Pajang Sultan, Arya Pangiri, was an unpopular ruler, and Benowo quickly rallied support to regain his throne and recruited Sutawijaya&#x27;s support against Pajang. Subsequently, Pajang was attacked from two directions: by Prince Benowo from Jipang and by Sutawijaya from Mataram, and was finally defeated. After the defeat of Pajang, Prince Benowo did not dare to stand against Senapati and agreed to bow down to him and submit Pajang to Mataram&#x27;s rule. This event in 1586, marked the end of Pajang kingdom and the rise of its former vassal, the Mataram Sultanate.

====The rise of Mataram====
Senapati assumed royal status by wearing the title &quot;Panembahan&quot; (literally &quot;one who is worshipped/&quot;sembah&quot;&quot;). He revealed the expansive nature of his reign and began the fateful campaign to the East along the course of Solo River that would bring endless conflicts. In 1586, the wealthy port city of Surabaya rose against Panembahan Senapati. Senapati however was unable to penetrate Surabayan defence. He then conquered Madiun in 1590-1 instead, and turned east from Madiun to conquer Kediri in 1591 and Ponorogo. Perhaps during the same time he also conquered Jipang (present day Bojonegoro) and Jagaraga (north of present-day Magetan). He reached east as far as Pasuruan, who may have used his threat to reduce pressure from the then powerful Surabaya. After his campaign in Central and East Java, Panembahan Senapati turned his attention to the West, as he forced Cirebon and Galuh in West Java to acknowledge Mataram&#x27;s overlordship in 1595. His effort to conquer Banten in West Java in 1597  — witnessed by Dutch sailors  — failed, perhaps due to lack of water transport. Later, Demak and Pati revolted and their forces almost reach the Mataram capital, before Senapati&#x27;s cavalry manage to destroy them. Panembahan Senapati died in 1601 and entombed in Kota Gede, he succeed on establishing a firm foundation of a new state. His successor, Mas Jolang or later known as Susuhunan Anyokrawati or Panembahan Sedo ing Krapyak, would face further rebellion.

The reign of Panembahan Anyokrowati (&quot;circa&quot; 1601–1613), the son of Senapati, was dominated by further warfare, especially against powerful Surabaya, already a major centre of power in East Java. He faced rebellion from his relatives who were installed in the newly conquered Demak (1601–4), Ponorogo (1607–8) and Kediri (1608). In 1612 Surabaya, again, rose against Mataram, as the response Anyokrowati conquered Mojokerto, destroyed Gresik and burned villages around Surabaya. Surabaya however, was still indomitable.

The first contact between Mataram and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) occurred under Susuhunan Anyokrowati. Dutch activities at the time were limited to trading from limited coastal settlements, so their interactions with the inland Mataram kingdom were limited, although they did form an alliance against Surabaya in 1613. Susuhunan Anyokrowati died accidentally that year when he was in Krapyak forest, hunting for deer. He was given posthumous title &quot;Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak&quot; (His Majesty who Died in Krapyak).

===Golden age===

Susuhunan Anyokrowati was succeeded by his son, Adipati Martapura. Adipati Martapura, however, was of poor health and quickly replaced by his brother, Raden Mas Rangsang in 1613, who assumed the title Panembahan ing Alaga, and later in 1641 took the title of Sultan Agung Anyokrokusumo (&quot;Great Sultan&quot;). The Mataram Sultanate under the reign of Sultan Agung is popularly remembered as the apogee of Mataram&#x27;s rule on Java, and the golden age of native Javanese power prior to European colonisation in the following century.

====Surabaya campaign and eastern conquests====

Panembahan ing Alaga was an able military general and also a warlike ambitious leader, and he aspired to unite Java under Mataram&#x27;s banner. He responsible for the great expansion and lasting historical legacy of Mataram due to the extensive military conquests of his long reign from 1613 to 1646. Under Sultan Agung, Mataram was able to expand its territory to include most of Java after capturing several port cities of northern Java. Surabaya with its strong fortification and surrounded by swamps, was still the most formidable enemy of Mataram. In 1614, Surabaya forged an alliance with Kediri, Tuban and Pasuruan, and launched invasion against Mataram. In the following year, Sultan Agung managed to repel allied Surabaya forces in Wirasaba (present day Mojoagung, near Mojokerto). He also conquered Malang, south of Surabaya. In 1616, Surabaya tried to attack Mataram but this army was crushed by Sultan Agung&#x27;s forces in Siwalan, Pajang (near Solo). The coastal city of Lasem, near Rembang, was conquered in 1616 and Pasuruan, southeast of Surabaya, was taken in 1617. Tuban, one of the oldest and largest port cities on the coast of Java, was taken in 1619.

Surabaya was Mataram&#x27;s most difficult enemy. Senapati was not strong enough to attack this powerful city and Anyokrowati attacked it to no avail. Sultan Agung tried to weakened Surabaya by launching a naval campaign across Java Sea and capturing Sukadana, Surabaya&#x27;s ally in southwest Kalimantan in 1622, and the island of Madura, another ally of Surabaya, was taken in 1624 after a fierce battle. Soon Madura&#x27;s fortifications in Sumenep and Pamekasan fell, Agung installed Adipati of Sampang as the Adipati of Madura, stylised as Prince Cakraningrat I.

After five years of war, Agung finally conquered Surabaya in 1625. The city was taken not through outright military invasion, but instead through a siege; Agung installed a tight blockade from the land and sea, starving Surabaya into submission. With Surabaya brought into the empire, the Mataram kingdom encompassed all of central and eastern Java, also Madura and Sukadana on southwest Borneo, except for the west and east end of the island and its mountainous south (except for Mataram — of course). Sultan Agung consolidated his political unity by forging marriage alliance of his Adipati to the Princesses of Mataram. Agung himself took the hand of Cirebon Princess as his consort, in an effort to sealed Cirebon as Mataram&#x27;s loyal ally. By 1625, Mataram was undisputed ruler of Java. Such a mighty feat of arms, however, did not deter Mataram&#x27;s former overlords from rebellion. Pajang rebelled in 1617, and Pati rebelled in 1627. After the capture of Surabaya in 1625, expansion stopped while the empire was busied by rebellions.

====Batavia campaign and western conquests====
Along western Java, Banten and the Dutch settlement in Batavia remained outside of Agung&#x27;s control. In his effort to unite Java, Agung claimed Mataram as the successor state of Demak, which historically held Banten as a vassal state. However, the Banten Sultanate opposed Agung&#x27;s claim, preferring to remain as a sovereign state. Agung therefore considered military conquest as a means to coerce Banten into Mataram&#x27;s hegemony. However, if Agung were march his armies to Banten, the port city of Batavia would stand as a potential opponent too near to the proximity of the Banten region. This did not deter Agung from pursuing his claim as he already perceived Dutch rule of Batavia as a threat to the Mataram hegemony, thereby inciting further reason to march upon Batavia whilst en route to Banten.

In 1628, Agung and his armies began the siege of Batavia. The initial stages of the campaign against Batavia proved difficult due to a lack of logistical support for Agung&#x27;s troops. To avoid a repeat of such inadequacy, Agung established farming settlements along the northern coast of West Java. This saw support from constructed rice barns and Javanese ships filled with rice rations to support Mataram troops. Upon discovery from Dutch ships and spies however, operations of these Javanese ships and rice barns were eventually put to a stop or burned down. As a result, large numbers of Mataram troops again suffered from ill-adequate logistical support and eventually, starvation. Agung&#x27;s attempt to invade Batavia ultimately ended in failure.

====Cracking down rebellions and eastern campaign====
In 1630, Mataram crushed a rebellion in Tembayat (southeast of Klaten) and in 1631–36, Mataram had to suppress rebellion of Sumedang and Ukur in West Java. Ricklefs and de Graaf argued that these rebellions in the later part of Sultan Agung&#x27;s reign was mainly due to his inability to capture Batavia in 1628–29, which shattered his reputation of invincibility and inspired Mataram&#x27;s vassal to rebel. This argument seems untenable due to two reason: first, rebellions against Sultan Agung already began as far back as 1617 and occurred in Pati even during his peak of invincibility after taking Surabaya in 1625. The second, and more importantly, the military failure to capture Batavia was not seen as political failure by Javanese point of view. After the failed Batavia campaign, Gresik tried to regain power in East Java and led a revolt that quickly cracked down completely in 1635.

The sultan also launched a &quot;holy war&quot; against the still-Hindu Blambangan in the extreme eastern Java. At that time Blambangan kingdom was supported by Kingdom of Gelgel in Bali that treated it as a buffer against the Islamic expansion of Muslim Mataram. Blambangan surrendered in 1639, but quickly regained their independence in 1659 and rejoined Bali in 1697, after the Mataram troops withdrew.
In 1641, Javanese envoys sent by Agung to Arabia have arrived home after obtaining permission to wear the title &quot;Sultan&quot; from Mecca. Mecca also sent numbers of ulama to Agung&#x27;s court. His Islamic name and title gained from Mecca is &quot;Sultan Abdul Muhammad Maulana Matarami&quot;.

In 1645 Sultan Agung began building Imogiri, his burial place, about fifteen kilometres south of Yogyakarta. Imogiri remains the resting place of most of the royalty of Yogyakarta and Surakarta to this day. Agung died in the spring of 1646, leaving behind an empire that covered most of Java and stretched to its neighbouring islands.

===Decline===
====Struggles for power====

Upon taking the throne, Agung&#x27;s son Susuhunan Amangkurat I tried to bring long-term stability to Mataram&#x27;s realm, by murdering local leaders that were insufficiently deferential to him, including the still-powerful noble from Surabaya, Pangeran Pekik, his father-in-law, and executed Panembahan Adiningkusuma (posthumous: Panembahan Girilaya), king of Cirebon, his son in-law. He also closed ports and destroyed ships in Javanese coastal cities to prevent them from getting too powerful from their wealth. This action devastated the Javanese coastal economy and crippled the Javanese maritime prowess that had been nurtured since the Singhasari and Majapahit era. This thus turned Mataram into a mainly agricultural inland kingdom for the next centuries. Because of this, Amangkurat I was notarized as a ruthless king. He even massacred 5,000–6,000 ulema and their family members due to their alleged involvement in a coup plot. Despite his political ruthlessness, unlike his father, Amangkurat I was not an accomplished military leader and dare not to pursue confrontation against the Dutch, as in 1646 he signed peace agreement with them. To further his glory, the new king abandoned Karta, Sultan Agung&#x27;s capital, and moved to a grander red-brick palace in Plered (formerly the palace was built of wood).

By the mid-1670s dissatisfaction with the king was turning into open revolt, beginning from the recalcitrant Eastern Java and creeping inward. The Crown Prince (future Amangkurat II) felt that his life was not safe in the court after he took his father&#x27;s concubine with the help of his maternal grandfather, Pangeran Pekik of Surabaya, making Amangkurat I suspicious of a conspiracy among Surabayan factions to grab power in the capital by using Pekiks’ grandson&#x27;s powerful position as the Crown Prince. He conspired with Panembahan Rama from Kajoran, west of Magelang, who proposed a stratagem in which the Crown Prince financed Rama&#x27;s son-in-law, Trunajaya, to begin a rebellion in the East Java. Raden Trunajaya, a prince from Arosbaya, Madura, led a revolt supported by itinerant fighters from faraway Makassar led by Kraeng Galesong. The Trunajaya rebellion moved swiftly and strong, and captured the king&#x27;s court at Plered in Mataram in mid-1677. The king escaped to the north coast with his eldest son, the future king Amangkurat II, leaving his younger son Pangeran Puger in Mataram. Apparently more interested in profit and revenge than in running a struggling empire, the rebel Trunajaya looted the court and withdrew to his stronghold in Kediri, East Java, leaving Prince Puger in control of a weak court. Seizing this opportunity, Puger assumed the throne in the ruins of Plered with the title Susuhanan ing Alaga.

====Amangkurat II and the beginning of foreign involvement====
On his way to Batavia to ask for Dutch&#x27;s help, Amangkurat I died in the village of Tegalarum near Tegal just after his expulsion, making Amangkurat II king in 1677. He too was nearly helpless, having fled without an army nor treasury to build one. In an attempt to regain his kingdom, he made substantial concessions to the Dutch East India Company (VOC), who then went to war to reinstate him. He promised to give the VOC the port town of Semarang if they lend him some troops. For the Dutch, a stable Mataram empire that was deeply indebted to them would help ensure continued trade on favourable terms. They were willing to lend their military might to keep the kingdom together.

The multinational Dutch forces, consisting of light-armed troops from Makasar and Ambon, in addition to heavily equipped European soldiers, first defeated Trunajaya in Kediri in November 1678 and Trunajaya himself was captured in 1679 near Ngantang west of Malang, then in 1681, the alliance of the VOC and Amangkurat II forced Susuhunan ing Alaga (Puger) to relinquish the throne in favour of his elder brother Amangkurat II. In 1680, Amangkurat II ascended as the king of Mataram by receiving his crown from the Dutch. As the compensation for Dutch supports, other than Semarang, Mataram has to hand over Bogor, Karawang and Priangan to the VOC. Cirebon too was forced to shift allegiance from Mataram to the Dutch, and becomes Dutch&#x27;s protectorate state. Since the fallen Plered was considered inauspicious, Amangkurat II move the capital to Kartasura in the land of Pajang (northern part of the stretch of land between Mount Merapi and Mount Lawu, the southern part being Mataram). The Dutch also erected a fort in Kartasura in an effort to control as well as protect the new capital.

By providing help in regaining his throne, the Dutch brought Amangkurat II under their tight control. Amangkurat II was apparently unhappy with the situation, especially the increasing Dutch control of the coast, but he was helpless in the face of a crippling financial debt and the threat of Dutch military power. The king engaged in a series of intrigues to try to weaken the Dutch position without confronting them head on; for example, by trying to co-operate with other kingdoms such as Cirebon and Johor and the court sheltered people wanted by the Dutch for attacking colonial offices or disrupting shipping such as Untung Surapati. In 1685, Batavia sent Captain Tack, the officer who captured Trunojoyo, to capture Surapati and negotiate further details into the agreement between the VOC and Amangkurat II but the king arranged a ruse in which he pretended to help Tack. Tack was killed when pursuing Surapati in Kartasura, then capital of Mataram (present day Kartasura near Solo), but Batavia decided to do nothing since the situation in Batavia itself was far from stable, such as the insurrection of Captain Jonker, native commander of Ambonese settlement in Batavia, in 1689. Mainly due to this incident, by the end of his reign, Amangkurat II was deeply distrusted by the Dutch, but Batavia were similarly uninterested in provoking another costly war on Java.

====Wars of succession====
Amangkurat II died in 1703 and was briefly succeeded by his son, Amangkurat III. However, this time the Dutch believed they had found a more reliable client, and hence supported his uncle Pangeran Puger, formerly Susuhunan ing Alaga, who had previously been defeated by the VOC and Amangkurat II. Before the Dutch, he accused Amangkurat III of planning an uprising in East Java. Unlike Pangeran Puger, Amangkurat III inherited family connection with Surabayan ruler, Jangrana II, from Amangkurat II and this lent credibility to the allegation that he cooperated with the now powerful Untung Suropati in Pasuruan. Panembahan Cakraningrat II of Madura, the VOC&#x27;s most trusted ally, persuaded the Dutch to support Pangeran Puger. Though Cakraningrat II harboured personal hatred towards Puger, this move is understandable since alliance between Amangkurat III and his Surabaya relatives and Surapati in Bangil would be a great threat to Madura&#x27;s position, even though Jangrana II&#x27;s father was Cakraningrat II&#x27;s son-in-law.

Pangeran Puger took the title of Pakubuwana I upon his accession in June 1704. The conflict between Amangkurat III and Pakubuwana I, the latter allied with the Dutch, usually termed First Javanese War of Succession, dragged on for five years before the Dutch managed to install Pakubuwana. In August 1705, Pakubuwono I&#x27;s retainers and VOC forces captured Kartasura without resistance from Amangkurat III, whose forces cowardly turned back when the enemy reached Ungaran. Surapati&#x27;s forces in Bangil, near Pasuruan, was crushed by the alliance of the VOC, Kartasura and Madura in 1706. Jangrana II, who tended to side with Amangkurat III and did not venture any assistance to the capture of Bangil, was called to present himself before Pakubuwana I and murdered there by the VOC&#x27;s request in the same year. Amangkurat III ran away to Malang with Surapati&#x27;s descendants and his remnant forces but Malang was then a no-man&#x27;s-land who offered no glory fit for a king. Therefore, though allied operations to the eastern interior of Java in 1706–08 did not gain much success in military terms, the fallen king surrendered in 1708 after being lured with the promises of household (lungguh) and land, but he was banished to Ceylon along with his wives and children. This is the end of Surabayan faction in Mataram, and – as we shall see later – this situation would ignite the political time bomb planted by Sultan Agung with his capture of Surabaya in 1625.

With the installation of Pakubuwana, the Dutch substantially increased their control over the interior of Central Java. Pakubuwana I was more than willing to agree to anything the VOC asked of him. In 1705 he agreed to cede the regions of Cirebon and eastern part of Madura (under Cakraningrat II), in which Mataram had no real control anyway, to the VOC. The VOC was given Semarang as new headquarters, the right to build fortresses anywhere in Java, a garrison in the kraton in Kartasura, monopoly over opium and textiles, and the right to buy as much rice as they wanted. Mataram would pay an annual tribute of 1300 metric tons of rice. Any debt made before 1705 was cancelled. In 1709, Pakubuwana I made another agreement with the VOC in which Mataram would pay annual tribute of wood, indigo and coffee (planted since 1696 by the VOC&#x27;s request) in addition to rice. These tributes, more than anything else, made Pakubuwana I the first genuine puppet of the Dutch. On paper, these terms seemed very advantageous to the Dutch, since the VOC itself was in financial difficulties during the period of 1683–1710. But the ability of the king to fulfil the terms of agreement depended largely on the stability of Java, for which the VOC has made a guarantee. It turned out later that the VOC&#x27;s military might was incapable of such a huge task.

The last years of Pakubuwana&#x27;s reign, from 1717 to 1719, were dominated by rebellion in East Java against the kingdom and its foreign patrons. The murder of Jangrana II in 1706 incited his three brothers, regents of Surabaya, Jangrana III, Jayapuspita and Surengrana, to raise a rebellion with the help of Balinese mercenaries in 1717. Pakubuwana I&#x27;s tributes to the VOC secured him a power which was feared by his subjects in Central Java, but this is for the first time since 1646 that Mataram was ruled by a king without any eastern connection. Surabaya had no reason to submit any more and thirst for vengeance made the brother regents openly contest Mataram&#x27;s power in Eastern Java. Cakraningkrat III who ruled Madura after ousting the VOC&#x27;s loyal ally Cakraningrat II, had every reason to side with his cousins this time. The VOC managed to capture Surabaya after a bloody war in 1718 and Madura was pacified when Cakraningrat III was killed in a fight on board of the VOC&#x27;s ship in Surabaya in the same year though the Balinese mercenaries plundered eastern Madura and was repulsed by the VOC in the same year. However, similar to the situation after Trunajaya&#x27;s uprising in 1675, the interior regencies in East Java (Ponorogo, Madiun, Magetan, Jogorogo) joined the rebellion en masse. Pakubuwana I sent his son, Pangeran Dipanagara (not to be confused with another prince with the same title who fought the Dutch in 1825–1830) to suppress the rebellion in the eastern interior but instead Dipanagara joined the rebel and assumed the messianic title of Panembahan Herucakra.

In 1719, Pakubuwana I died and his son Amangkurat IV took the throne in 1719, but his brothers, Pangeran Blitar and Purbaya, contested the succession. They attacked the kraton in June 1719. When they were repulsed by the cannons in the VOC&#x27;s fort, they retreated south to the land of Mataram. Another royal brother, Pangeran Arya Mataram, ran to Japara and proclaimed himself king, thus began the Second War of Succession. Before the year ended, Arya Mataram surrendered and was strangled in Japara by king&#x27;s order, and Blitar and Purbaya was dislodged from their stronghold in Mataram in November. In 1720, these two princes ran away to the still rebellious interior of East Java. Luckily for the VOC and the young king, the rebellious regents of Surabaya, Jangrana III and Jayapuspita died in 1718–20 and Pangeran Blitar died in 1721. In May and June 1723, the remnants of the rebels and their leaders surrendered, including Surengrana of Surabaya, Pangeran Purbaya and Dipanagara, all of whom were banished to Ceylon, except Purbaya, who was taken to Batavia to serve as &quot;backup&quot; to replace Amangkurat IV in case of any disruption in the relationship between the king and VOC since Purbaya was seen to have equal &quot;legitimacy&quot; by the VOC. It is obvious from these two Wars of Succession that even though the VOC was virtually invincible in the field, mere military prowess was not sufficient to pacify Java.

====Court intrigues in 1723–1741====
After 1723, the situation seemed to stabilise, much to the delight of the Dutch. Javanese nobility had learned that the alliance of the VOC&#x27;s military with any Javanese faction made them nearly invincible. It seemed that the VOC&#x27;s plan to reap the profit from a stable Java under a kingdom which was deeply indebted to the VOC would soon be realised. In 1726, Amangkurat IV fell to an illness that resembled poisoning. His son assumed the throne as Pakubuwana II, this time without any serious resistance from anybody. The history for the period of 1723 until 1741 was dominated by a series of intrigues which further showed the fragile nature of Javanese politics, held together by Dutch&#x27;s effort. In this relatively peaceful situation, the king could not gather the support of his &quot;subjects&quot; and instead was swayed by short-term ends siding with this faction for a moment and then to another. The king never seemed to lack challenges to his &quot;legitimacy&quot;.

The descendants of Amangkurat III, who were allowed to return from Ceylon, and the royal brothers, especially Pangeran Ngabehi Loring Pasar and the banished Pangeran Arya Mangkunegara, tried to gain the support of the Dutch by spreading gossips of rebellion against the king and the patih (vizier), Danureja. At the same time, the patih tried to strengthen his position by installing his relatives and clients in the regencies, sometimes without king&#x27;s consent, at the expense of other nobles’ interests, including the powerful queens dowager, Ratu Amangkurat (Amangkurat IV&#x27;s wife) and Ratu Pakubuwana (Pakubuwana I&#x27;s wife), much to the confusion of the Dutch.

The king tried to break the dominance of this Danureja by asking the help of the Dutch to banish him, but Danureja&#x27;s successor, Natakusuma, was influenced heavily by the Queen&#x27;s brother, Arya Purbaya, son of the rebel Pangeran Purbaya, who was also Natakusuma&#x27;s brother-in-law. Arya Purbaya&#x27;s erratic behaviour in court, his alleged homosexuality which was abhorred by the pious king and rumours of his planning a rebellion against the &quot;heathen&quot; (the Dutch) caused unrest in Kartasura and hatred from the nobles. After his sister, the Queen, died of miscarriage in 1738, the king asked the Dutch to banish him, to which the Dutch complied gladly. Despite these faction struggles, the situation in general did not show any signs of developing into full-scale war. Eastern Java was quiet: though Cakraningrat IV refused to pay homage to the court with various excuses, Madura was held under firm control by the VOC and Surabaya did not stir. But dark clouds were forming. This time, the explosion came from the west: Batavia itself.

====Chinese War 1741–1743====
In the meantime, the Dutch were contending with other problems. The excessive use of land for sugar cane plantation in the interior of West Java reduced the flow of water in Ciliwung River (which flows through the city of Batavia) and made the city canals an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, resulting in a series of malaria outbreaks in 1733–1795. This was aggravated by the fall of sugar price in European market, bringing bankruptcy to sugar factories in the areas around Batavia (the Ommelanden), which were mostly operated by Chinese labour. The unrest prompted the VOC authorities to reduce the number of unlicensed Chinese settlers, who had been smuggled into Batavia by Chinese sugar factory owners. These labourers were loaded onto ships out of Batavia but the rumour that these people were thrown into the sea as soon as the ship was beyond the horizon caused panic among the remaining Chinese. On 7 October 1740, several Chinese mobs attacked Europeans outside the city and incited the Dutch to order a massacre two days later. The Chinese settlement in Batavia was looted for several days, in which 10,000 Chinese were killed. The Chinese ran away and captured Bekasi, which was dislodged by the VOC in June 1741.

In 1741, Chinese rebels were present in Central Java, particularly around Welahan, Pati, Grobogan, and Kaliwungu. In May 1741 Juwana was captured by the Chinese. The Javanese at first sided with the Dutch and reinforced Demak on 10 June 1741. Two days later, a detachment of Javanese forces together with the VOC forces of Europeans, Balinese and Buginese in Semarang to defend Tugu, west of Semarang. The Chinese rebel lured them into their main forces&#x27;s position in Mount Bergota through narrow road and ambushed them. The allied forces were dispersed and ran as fast as they could back to Semarang. The Chinese pursued them but were repulsed by Dutch cannons in the fortress. Semarang was seized by panic. By July 1741, the Chinese occupied Kaligawe, south of Semarang, Rembang, and besieged Jepara. This is the most dangerous time for the VOC. Military superiority would enable the VOC to hold Semarang without any support from Mataram forces, but it would mean nothing since a turbulent interior would disrupt trade and therefore profit, the VOC&#x27;s main objective. One VOC high official, Abraham Roos, suggested that the VOC assumed royal function in Java by denying Pakubuwana II&#x27;s &quot;legitimacy&quot; and asking the regents to take an oath of loyalty to the VOC&#x27;s sovereignty. This was turned down by the Council of Indies (Raad van Indie) in Batavia, since even if the VOC managed to conquer the coast, it would not be strong enough to conquer the mountainous interior of Java, which do not provide much level plain required by Western method of warfare. Therefore, the Dutch East India Company must support its superior but inadequate military by picking the right allies. One such ally had presented itself, that is Cakraningkrat IV of Madura who could be relied on to hold the eastern coast against the Chinese, but the interior of Eastern and Central Java was beyond the reach of this quarrelsome prince. Therefore, the VOC had no choice but to side with Pakubuwana II.

The VOC&#x27;s dire situation after the Battle of Tugu in July 1741 did not escape the king&#x27;s attention, but – like Amangkurat II – he avoided any open breach with the VOC since his own kraton was not lacking of factions against him. He ordered Patih Natakusuma to do all the dirty work, such as ordering the Arch-Regent (Adipati) of Jipang (Bojonegoro), one Tumenggung Mataun, to join the Chinese. In September 1741, the king ordered Patih Natakusuma and several regents to help the Chinese besiege Semarang and let Natakusuma attack the VOC garrison in Kartasura, who were starved into submission in August. However, reinforcement from the VOC&#x27;s posts in Outer Islands were arriving since August and they were all wisely concentrated to repel the Chinese around Semarang. In the beginning of November, the Dutch attacked Kaligawe, Torbaya around Semarang, and repulsed the alliance of Javanese and Chinese forces who were stationed in four separate fortress and did not co-ordinate with each other. At the end of November, Cakraningrat IV had controlled the stretch of east coast from Tuban to Sedayu and the Dutch relieved Tegal of Chinese rebels. This caused Pakubuwana II to change sides and open negotiations with the Dutch.

In the next year 1742, the alliance of Javanese and Chinese let Semarang alone and captured Kudus and Pati in February. In March, Pakubuwana II sent a messenger to negotiate with the Dutch in Semarang and offered them absolute control over all northern coasts of Java and the privilege to appoint patih. The VOC promptly sent van Hohendorff with a small force to observe the situation in Kartasura. Things began to get worse for Pakubuwana II. In April, the rebels set up Raden Mas Garendi, a descendant of Amangkurat III, as king with the title of Sunan Kuning.

In May, the Dutch agreed to support Pakubuwana II after considering that after all, the regencies in eastern interior were still loyal to this weak king but the Javano-Chinese rebel alliance had occupied the only road from Semarang to Kartasura and captured Salatiga. The princes in Mataram tried to attack the Javano-Chinese alliance but they were repulsed. On 30 June 1742, the rebels captured Kartasura and van Hohendorff had to run away from a hole in kraton wall with the helpless Pakubuwana II on his back. The Dutch, however, ignored Kartasura&#x27;s fate in rebel hands and concentrated its forces under Captain Gerrit mother and Nathaniel Steinmets to repulse the rebels around Demak, Welahan, Jepara, Kudus and Rembang. By October 1742, the northern coast of Central Java was cleaned of the rebels, who seemed to disperse into the traditional rebel hideout in Malang to the east and the Dutch forces returned to Semarang in November. Cakraningrat IV, who wished to free the eastern coast of Java from Mataram influence, could not deter the Dutch from supporting Pakubuwana II but he managed to capture and plunder Kartasura in November 1742. In December 1742, the VOC negotiated with Cakraningrat and managed to persuade him to relieve Kartasura of Madurese and Balinese troops under his pay. The treasures, however, remained in Cakraningrat&#x27;s hand.

The reinstatement of Pakubuwana II in Kartasura on 14 December 1742 marked the end of the Chinese war. It showed who was in control of the situation. Accordingly, Sunan Kuning surrendered in October 1743, followed by other rebel leaders. In the mid-18th century, Mataram lost much of their lands, by 1743 Mataram only consists of areas around Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Kedu and Bagelen. Cakraningrat IV was definitely not pleased with this situation and he began to make alliance with Surabaya, the descendants of Untung Surapati, and hired more Balinese mercenaries. He stopped paying tribute to the VOC in 1744, and after a failed attempt to negotiate, the Dutch attacked Madura in 1745 and ousted Cakraningrat, who was banished to the Cape in 1746.

===Division of Mataram===

The fall of Kartasura made the palace inauspicious for the king and Pakubuwana II built a new kraton in Surakarta or Solo and moved there in 1746. However, Pakubuwana II was far from secure in this throne. Raden Mas Said, or Pangeran Sambernyawa (meaning &quot;Soul Reaper&quot;), son of banished Arya Mangkunegara, who later would establish the princely house of Mangkunagara in Solo, and several other princes of the royal blood still maintained rebellion. Pakubuwana II declared that anyone who can suppress the rebellion in Sukawati, areas around present day Sragen, would be rewarded with 3000 households. Pangeran Mangkubumi, Pakuwana II&#x27;s brother, who would later establish the royal house of Yogyakarta took the challenge and defeated Mas Said in 1746. But when he claimed his prize, his old enemy, patih Pringgalaya, advised the king against it. In the middle of this problem, the VOC&#x27;s governor general, van Imhoff, paid a visit to the kraton, the first one to do so during the whole history of the relation between Mataram and the VOC, to confirm the de facto Dutch possession of coastal and several interior regions. Pakubuwana II hesitantly accepted the cession in lieu of 20,000 real per year. Mangkubumi was dissatisfied with his brother&#x27;s decision to yield to van Imhoff&#x27;s insistence, which was made without consulting the other members of royal family and great nobles. van Imhoff had neither experience nor tactfulness to understand the delicate situation in Mataram and he rebuked Mangkubumi as &quot;too ambitious&quot; before the whole court when Mangkubumi claimed the 3000 households. This shameful treatment from a foreigner who had wrested the most prosperous lands of Mataram from his weak brother led him to raise his followers into rebellion in May 1746, this time with the help of Mas Said.

In the midst of Mangkubumi rebellion in 1749, Pakubuwana II fell ill and called van Hohendorff, his trusted friend who saved his life during the fall of Kartasura in 1742. He asked Hohendorff to assume control over the kingdom. Hohendorff was naturally surprised and refused, thinking that he would be made king of Mataram, but when the king insisted on it, he asked his sick friend to confirm it in writing. On 11 December 1749, Pakubuwana II signed an agreement in which the &quot;sovereignty&quot; of Mataram was given to the VOC.

On 15 December 1749, Hohendorff announced the accession of Pakubuwana II&#x27;s son as the new king of Mataram with the title Pakubuwana III. However, three days earlier, Mangkubumi in his stronghold in Yogyakarta also announced his accession with the title Mangkubumi, with Mas Said as his patih. This rebellion got stronger day by day and even in 1753 the Crown Prince of Surakarta joined the rebels. The VOC decided that it did have not the military capability to suppress this rebellion, though in 1752, Mas Said broke away from Hamengkubuwana. By 1754, all parties were tired of war and ready to negotiate.

The kingdom of Mataram was divided in 1755 under an agreement signed in Giyanti between the Dutch under the Governor General Nicolaas Hartingh and rebellious prince Mangkubumi. The treaty divided nominal control over central Java between the Yogyakarta Sultanate, under Mangkubumi, and Surakarta, under Pakubuwana. Mas Said, however, proved to be stronger than the combined forces of Solo, Yogya and the VOC. In 1756, he even almost captured Yogyakarta, but he realised that he could not defeat the three powers all by himself. In February 1757 he surrendered to Pakubuwana III and was given 4000 households, all taken from Pakubuwana III&#x27;s own lungguh, and a parcel of land near Solo, the present day Mangkunegaran Palace, and the title of &quot;Pangeran Arya Adipati Mangkunegara&quot;. This settlement proved successful in that political struggle was again confined to palace or inter-palace intrigues and peace was maintained until 1812.

==Culture==

Despite being an Islamic Sultanate, Mataram had never adopted Islamic culture, systems and institutions thoroughly. Its political system was more like a syncretism of earlier Javanese Hindu civilisation merged with Islamic elements. The major formation took place during Sultan Agung&#x27;s reign as he adapted Islam to the Hindu-Javanese tradition and introduced a new calendar in 1633 based on Islamic and Javanese practice. The arts during Sultan Agung&#x27;s reign were a mixture of Islamic and Hindu-Javanese elements. The mainstream belief system was the Kejawen tradition, while the Islamic beliefs was held by a handful of kiyai or ulama religious elite clustering around &quot;Kauman&quot; area near court&#x27;s mosque. The Javanese court ceremonies, culture and rituals of Mataram still bears Hindu-Buddhist elements. Javanese cultural elements, such as gamelan, batik, kris, wayang kulit and Javanese dance were formulated, codified and took its present form during this period, and inherited by its successors, the courts of Surakarta and Yogyakarta, and the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman.
Islam is presented in Java adaptively to the original Javanese culture. This cultural adaptation was acceptable to the Javanese community, so the indigenousization of Islam was considered successful because Islam developed rapidly in Java naturally and through the cultural process of the Javanese community itself.

==Javanese kingship==
Javanese kingship varies from Western kingship, which is essentially based on the idea of legitimacy from the people (Democracy), or from God (divine authority), or both. The Javanese language does not include words with these meanings. The concept of the Javanese kingdom is a mandala, or a centre of the world, in the sense of both a central location and a central being, focused on the person of the king (variously called &quot;Sri Bupati, Sri Narendra, Sang Aji, Prabu&quot;). The king is regarded as a semi-divine being, a union of divine and human aspects (&quot;binathara&quot;, the passive form of &quot;bathara&quot;, god). Javanese kingship is a matter of royal-divine presence, not a specific territory or population. People may come and go without interrupting the identity of a kingdom which lies in the succession of semi-divine kings. Power, including royal power is not qualitatively different from the power of dukuns or shamans, but it is much stronger. Javanese kingship is not based on the legitimacy of a single individual, since anyone can contest power by tapa or asceticism, and many did contest the kings of Mataram.

==List of Susuhunan (Kings) of Mataram==
The kings of Mataram initially held the title &quot;panembahan&quot; and then the &quot;susuhunan&quot;, the title of &quot;sultan&quot; was only used in 1641-1645 during the reign of Anyokrokusumo.

# Danang Sutawijaya (Panembahan Senopati) : 1586–1601
# Raden Mas Jolang (Susuhunan Anyokrowati / Sunan Krapyak) : 1601–1613
# Raden Mas Jatmika (Susuhunan Anyokrokusumo / Sultan Agung) : 1613–1645) 
# Raden Mas Sayyidin (Susuhunan Amangkurat I / Sunan Tegalarum) : 1646–1677
# Raden Mas Rahmat (Susuhunan Amangkurat II / Sunan Amral) : 1677–1703
# Raden Mas Sutikna (Susuhunan Amangkurat III / Sunan Mas) : 1703–1704
# Raden Mas Darajat (Susuhunan Pakubuwono I / Sunan Ngalaga) : 1704–1719
# Raden Mas Suryaputra (Susuhunan Amangkurat IV / Sunan Jawi) : 1719–1726
# Raden Mas Prabasuyasa (Susuhunan Pakubuwono II / Sunan Kumbul) : 1726–1742
# Raden Mas Garendi (Susuhunan Amangkurat V / Sunan Kuning) : 1742–1743 
# Raden Mas Prabasuyasa (Susuhunan Pakubuwono II / Sunan Kumbul) : 1743–1749 
# Raden Mas Gustisuriyakusuma (Susuhunan Pakubuwono III / Sunan Prabhu) :1749-1755 

Mataram was divided in 1755, as a result of the Third Javanese War of Succession. The incident is referred to in Javanese as &#x27;Palihan Nagari&#x27;.

==Legacy==

The Mataram Sultanate was the last major native polity in Java prior the kingdom broke into of courts of Surakarta and Yogyakarta, and the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman, and prior the island was completely ruled by the Dutch. For some Central Javanese, especially those hailed from Yogyakarta and Surakarta city, the Mataram Sultanate, especially Sultan Agung&#x27;s era, was remembered with pride as a glorious past, as Mataram become the regional hegemon after Majapahit, almost completely unified Java island, and almost succeed to drive the Dutch out of Java. However, for those of former Mataram&#x27;s rivals or vassals; East Javanese Surabayan, Madurese and Blambangan, also Priangan and Cirebon of West Java, Mataram era is remembered as the era of Central Javanese overlordship over them, marked with authoritarianism and arbitrariness of feudal Javanese regime. In the future this would lead to interregional Madura – Central Java animosity. Also to some degree, Priangan–Mataraman rivalry. Within Mataraman realm, the disintegration of the Mataram Sultanate into several competing &quot;Keratons&quot;, also would lead to Surakarta–Yogyakarta rivalry.

In art and culture, the Mataram Sultanate has left an everlasting mark in Javanese culture, as many of Javanese cultural elements, such as gamelan, batik, kris, wayang kulit and Javanese dance were formulated, codified and took its present form during this period, inherited and preserved diligently by its successor &quot;s&quot;. During the height of the Mataram Sultanate in the first half of the 17th century, Javanese culture expanded, much of Western and East Java region are being Javanized. Mataram&#x27;s campaign on Eastern Javanese principalities such as Surabaya and Pasuruan expanded Mataraman influences on Java. Mataram expansion includes Sundanese principalities of Priangan highlands; from Galuh Ciamis, Sumedang, Bandung and Cianjur. It was during this period that Sundanese people were exposed and assimilated further into Javanese &quot;Kejawen&quot; culture. Wayang Golek are Sundanese taking on Javanese Wayang Kulit culture, similar shared culture such as gamelan and batik also flourished. It is probably during this times that Sundanese language began to adopt the stratified degree of term and vocabulary to denote politeness, as reflected in Javanese language. In addition, Javanese scripts also used to write Sundanese as &quot;cacarakan&quot;.

In political aspect, the incessant war of succession, treason, rebellion and court intrigue of Javanese Mataram &quot;&quot; during the last period of its history, has made Mataram being remembered in quite unflattering way. Combined with Javanese behaviour, such as obsession with elegance and refinements (Javanese: &quot;alus&quot;), subtleness, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one&#x27;s social stature, has made Mataram politics quite complicated, intricate and deceitful. As the result the negative aspects of Javanisation of contemporary Indonesian politics, such as dishonesty, deceptive, treacherousness, rigidity of social hierarchy, authoritarianism and arbitrariness, accompanied by fondness of status display and arrogance, is often attributed to and called as &quot;Mataramization&quot;. A typical negative description of priyayi behaving like the member of Javanese upper class.

==Catur Sagotra==
Catur Sagotra means four entities that still have a single root kinship, referring to the royal families who succeeded the Islamic Mataram dynasty. These kingdoms are Kasunanan Surakarta, Kasultanan Yogyakarta, Kadipaten Mangkunagaran, and Kadipaten Pakualaman.
The formation of Catur Sagotra began in 2004. King of Surakarta Sri Susuhunan Paku Buwono XII (before he died) once gave the mandate to Mrs. Nani Soedarsono to continue the noble ideals of Catur Sagotra. Catur Sagotra is a joint idea of the four Javanese kings at that time, namely Sri Susuhunan Paku Buwono XII, Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono IX, Sri Paku Alam VIII and Sri Mangku Nagoro VIII. The purpose of Catur Sagotra is to unite the four breeds in the bonds of the same cultural philosophy and historical linkages of Mataram&#x27;s ancestors.

<doc id="1195635" wikidata="Q7095513" url="?curid=1195635" title="Opacifier">
<text>An opacifier is a substance added to a material in order to make the ensuing system opaque. An example of a chemical opacifier is titanium dioxide (TiO2), which is used as an opacifier in paints, in paper, and in plastics. It has very high refraction index (rutile modification 2.7 and anatase modification 2.55) and optimum refraction is obtained with crystals about 225 nanometers. Impurities in the crystal alter the optical properties. It is also used to opacify ceramic glazes and milk glass; bone ash is also used.

Opacifiers must have a refractive index (RI) substantially different from the system. Conversely, clarity may be achieved in a system by choosing components with very similar refractive indices.

==Glasses==
Ancient milk glasses used crystals of calcium antimonate, formed in the melt from calcium present in the glass and an antimony additive. Opaque yellow glasses contained crystals of lead antimonate; bindheimite mineral may have been used as the additive. Under oxidizing condition, lead also forms incompletely dissolved lead pyroantimonate (Pb2Sb2O7). From 2nd century BC tin oxide appears in use as opacifier, likely in the form of cassiterite mineral. Opaque yellow can be produced as lead stannate; the color is paler than the lead antimonate one. Later calcium and sodium phosphates became used; bone ash contains calcium phosphate in a high proportion. Calcium fluoride was also used, especially in China.

For dental ceramics, several approaches are in use. Spodumene or mica crystals can be precipitated. Fluorides of aluminium, calcium, barium, and magnesium can be used with suitable heat treatment. Tin oxide can be used, but zirconia and titania give better results; for titania, the appropriate resulting particle size is between submicron to 20 μm. Another desirable opacifier is zinc oxide.

Opacifiers must also form small particles in the system. Opacifiers are generally inert.

==X-ray opacifiers==
In context of x-rays, opacifiers are additives with high absorption of x-rays; typically these are particles or compounds of lead, barium (often barium sulfate), tungsten, or other high atomic weight elements. Sometimes opacifiers are added to medical implants to make them visible under X-ray imaging. This is especially true in the case of most polymers which are often unrecognizable in the body when viewed using X-rays.

==Rocket propellants==
In solid rocket propellants and some translucent smokeless powders, the primary method of heat transfer into the propellant grain from the combustion process is by radiation, and opacifiers such as &quot;lamp black&quot; may be added to the propellant mixture to ensure the heat does not penetrate far below the surface of the grain, which could cause detonation. The opacifiers also prevent sub-surface overheating and localized premature ignition in the grains where imperfections absorbing the thermal radiation are present. Carbon black is commonly used for this purpose; other possible additives are nigrosin, Prussian blue, methylene blue, etc. in amounts ranging commonly between 0.1 and 0.5%.

<doc id="1195648" wikidata="Q4685665" url="?curid=1195648" title="Adrien de Noailles, 8th Duke of Noailles">
<text>&quot;Adrien&quot; Maurice Victurnien Mathieu de Noailles, 8th Duke of Noailles (22 September 1869 – 23 October 1953), was a French aristocrat and Olympian. 

==Early life==
He was the eldest son of Jules Charles Victurnien de Noailles, 7th Duke of Noailles, and Clotilde Caroline Antoinette de La Ferté-Meun Molé de Champlâtreux. Among his younger brothers was Count Mathieu Fernand Frédéric Pascal de Noailles, who married the writer Princess Anna Elisabeth Bibesco-Bassaraba de Brancovan (a daughter of Prince Grégoire Bibesco-Bassaraba).

His paternal grandparents were Paul de Noailles, 6th Duke of Noailles (who succeeded his grand-uncle Jean de Noailles, 5th Duke of Noailles, as Duke of Noailles in 1824), and Alice de Rochechouart-Mortemart (a daughter of Victurnien de Rochechouart, 8th Duke of Mortemart). His maternal grandparents were Count Hubert de La Ferté-Meun and Elisabeth Françoise Molé de Champlâtreux.

==Career==
Upon on his father&#x27;s death in 1895, he succeeded to the dukedom of Noailles, and inherited his father&#x27;s estate, including the Château de Maintenon in the Eure-et-Loir &quot;département&quot; of France (best known today as the private residence of Louis XIV&#x27;s second wife, Madame de Maintenon).

===Olympic career===
A noted equestrian, the Duke competed in the mail coach event at the 1900 Summer Olympics, one of five equestrian competitions held in late May and early June 1900 at the International Horse Show in Paris. The event was part of the Exposition Universelle, and later classified as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==
On 5 December 1892, he married Yolande Louise Marie Valentine d&#x27;Albert de Luynes (1870–1952), a daughter of Charles Honoré Emmanuel d&#x27;Albert de Luynes, 9th Duke of Luynes, and Yolande Françoise Marie Julienne de La Rochefoucauld (a daughter of Sosthène II de La Rochefoucauld, 4th Duke of Doudeauville). Together, they were the parents of three children:

* Jean Maurice Paul Jules de Noailles (1893–1945), &quot;styled&quot; Duke of Ayen, a member of the French Resistance who was killed in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945.
* Yolande Marie Clothilde Charlotte (1896–1976)
* Élisabeth Pauline Sabine Marie (1898–1969), a tennis player who competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics, winning a bronze medal.

The Duchess died in Cannes on 18 October 1952. The Duke died on 23 October 1953. As his only son (and his son) predeceased him during World War II, he was succeeded by his nephew, François de Noailles.

<doc id="1195649" wikidata="Q6831918" url="?curid=1195649" title="Michael Klonsky">
<text>Michael Klonsky (born 1943) is an American educator, author, and political activist. He is known for his work with the Students for a Democratic Society, the New Communist Movement, and, later, the small schools movement.

==Political activism==
Klonsky&#x27;s father, Robert Klonsky, a World War II veteran who fought as a volunteer against the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War, had been arrested and convicted of &quot;conspiring to advocate Marxist views&quot; in violation of the Smith Act during the McCarthy period. The Supreme Court later overturned the case.

In the late 1960s Klonsky became the national secretary of the Students for a Democratic Society, which he joined as a student at San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge). He was one of five S.D.S. members arrested on May 12, 1969, when &quot;anonymous false reports of fire and a shooting&quot; sent police and firefighters to the S.D.S. offices in Chicago.

In the 1970s he became a leader of the New Communist Movement which broke with the older Communist Party USA and its allegiance to the Soviet Union. He headed the Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist), in which role he was one of the first U.S. political activists to visit the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Klonsky later became critical of Marxist dogma but stayed active in civil rights, anti-war and educational reform politics.

==Education research==
Klonsky became one of the leaders of the modern small schools movement. His academic work focused on small school size as a solution to the problems of inner city schools; his early research on issues of school size and its impact on student achievement, school violence, and dropout rates, helped pave the way towards the development of thousands of new small and charter schools across the country. By 1996, he was the director of the Small Schools Workshop at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and in 1999, he was named by president Bill Clinton to the Academic Advisory Council of the National Campaign Against Youth Violence, where he advocated small schools as a mechanism for violence reduction. Klonsky is now a retired professor of education after teaching at several universities, including UIC and the Fischler School of Education at Nova Southeastern University.

<text>The Oregon–Oregon State football rivalry (informally known as the Civil War) is an American college football rivalry game played annually in the state of Oregon between the Ducks of the University of Oregon in Eugene and the Beavers of Oregon State University in Corvallis.

First played in 1894, it is the fifth-most played college football rivalry game in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Oregon State is still a member of the Pac-12 Conference while Oregon moved to the Big Ten Conference on August 1, 2024. The campuses are less than apart in the Willamette Valley. The series has now been played continuously since 1945. Though not officially recognized by the universities, the Platypus Trophy is awarded annually to the winning team’s alumni association.

==Series history==
The game was first played in 1894 and has been contested 127 times through 2023, as well as continuously since 1945. Oregon leads the series The game was not held in 1900, 1901, 1911, 1943, and 1944; two games were played in 1896 and 1945. The first reference to the &quot;Civil War&quot; name was in 1929 and came into common use in 1937. Prior to that, it was called the &quot;Oregon Classic&quot; or the &quot;State Championship Game.&quot; With athletes, alumni, and boosters questioning the name, usage of the &quot;Civil War&quot; name was discontinued in 2020 amid a wave of name changes sparked by the George Floyd protests.
The game is usually played in even-numbered years at the home field of Oregon State in Corvallis (Reser Stadium, formerly Parker Stadium, beginning in 1954) and in odd-numbered years at the home field of Oregon in Eugene (since 1967, Autzen Stadium). Seven games were played at Multnomah Field/Stadium (now Providence Park) in Portland: in 1908, 1917, 1933, 1934, 1938, 1950, and 1952. In an effort to mitigate rioting, the 1912 and 1913 games were played at a neutral site in Albany following riots after the 1910 game that led to the 1911 game&#x27;s cancellation.

From 1997 through 2006, the home team won the game. The streak was snapped in 2007, when Oregon State beat Oregon at Autzen Stadium 38–31 in double overtime. In 2008, the Ducks returned the favor in Corvallis by beating OSU 65–38. The streak of visiting teams winning was snapped at two games in 2009 when the Ducks won 37–33 in Eugene.

From 1959 to 1961, the Platypus Trophy was awarded to the winner; it was lost for over forty years and finally found in 2005. Beginning with the 2007 game, it is awarded to the winning school&#x27;s alumni association. A different trophy was awarded following the game in 1980.

Both share the longest winning streak in the series at eight games, but the Ducks had an undefeated run of thirteen games (1975–1987), with twelve wins and a scoreless tie in 1983.

In 2023, Oregon announced it would move from the Pac-12 Conference to the Big Ten Conference beginning with the 2024 season, turning the rivalry with Oregon State into a nonconference game and putting continuation of the series in jeopardy. Following the conclusion of the 2023 season, the teams announced the series would continue for at least two more years.

==Memorable games==

1933: In a game played before 32,183 spectators at Multnomah Stadium in Portland, both teams came into the game undefeated: the Beavers were and the Ducks The Beavers scored first, but the rest was all Oregon, with fullback (and future Chicago Cardinal) &quot;Iron Mike&quot; Mikulak rushing for 89 yards on the way to a 13–3 victory. The Webfoots won a share of the PCC championship, but Stanford got the bid to the Rose Bowl.

1957: The Ducks had a 6–1 conference record and the Beavers were 5–2. A Beaver win at Hayward Field would give them a share of the conference title, but since the Beavers had been to the previous season&#x27;s Rose Bowl, the Pacific Coast Conference&#x27;s no-repeat rule meant that no matter what, the Ducks were headed for Pasadena on New Year&#x27;s Day, their first Rose Bowl appearance since January 1920. Both teams scored on their first possession, but that ended the scoring until late in the third quarter, when Beaver kicker Ted Searle put Oregon State on top, 10–7. A late fumble by the Ducks&#x27; Jim Shanley secured the win—but not the Rose Bowl—for Oregon State.

1959: The Ducks came into the game with just one loss. An Oregon win, coupled with a Washington loss, could have earned the Ducks a Rose Bowl invitation. Meanwhile, Oregon State was 2–6, its first losing record in five years. The Beavers started shakily, fumbling on their first two possessions and falling behind 7–0 in the first quarter. The rest was all Beavers as they salvaged their season with two touchdowns and a field goal to upset the Ducks, 15–7.

1969: With the score tied at seven and less than a minute left, Oregon State placekicker Mike Nehl attempted a 29-yard field goal to put the Beavers ahead. Nehl had already had one field goal blocked and missed one field goal on the day, and this one was blocked by Oregon&#x27;s Jim Franklin, hit an official, bounced off the foot of Oregon linebacker Don Graham, and was recovered by Oregon State tight end Bill Plumeau at the Duck four-yard line. Nehl again came on to try his fourth field goal, and this time, connected on a 21-yard kick to give the Beavers a 10–7 win—the sixth on the way to what would be eight straight OSU wins in the series. This was the first game played on artificial turf.

1983: Played during a torrential rainstorm and pitting two mediocre squads against each other, the game ended in a scoreless tie, and is commonly known as the &quot;Toilet Bowl&quot; due to the very poor standard of play in the game, which featured eleven fumbles (six for turnovers), five interceptions, and four missed field goals. It was also the last Division I football game to end in a scoreless tie, with the NCAA instituting overtime rules in 1996. This was also the tenth and final tie in the series, six of which were scoreless.

1987: Oregon earned what was at the time the most lopsided victory in the series, a 44–0 drubbing led by Ducks quarterback Bill Musgrave.

1988: The Beavers last win was fourteen years earlier, and Oregon head coach Rich Brooks had not lost a game in the series in 21 attempts (18–0–3) as either a Ducks coach or Beavers coach or player. Both streaks ended on this day, as the Beavers scored two fourth quarter touchdowns for a 

1994: Oregon needed a win at hostile Parker Stadium to secure a bid to the Rose Bowl, but trailed in the fourth quarter. Quarterback Danny O&#x27;Neil took the Ducks on a 70-yard drive that culminated in a 19-yard pass to Dino Philyaw for a win and their first Rose Bowl in 37 years.

1998: Oregon State prevails in double overtime (the first ever overtime game in the series), 44–41. Beaver fans rushed the field after the first overtime after the Ducks failed to score on fourth down, but a pass interference penalty gave the Ducks another chance. It took officials 15 minutes to clear the field, after which the Ducks scored to send the game to a second overtime. The Ducks managed a field goal in their possession, but Beavers running back Ken Simonton scored to give the Beavers an upset win, their fifth win of the season, and their best record since 1971.

2000: Oregon came into the game ranked #5 in the country with Oregon State at #8, the first time both teams have been ranked in the top 10 simultaneously. With a win, Oregon would go to the Rose Bowl; the Beavers needed a win to force a tie between the two teams, and keep alive hopes of going to the Rose Bowl. Oregon State won the game 23–13, but was denied a Rose Bowl bid when Washington beat Washington State later the same day. Oregon State was extended an at-large invitation to BCS&#x27; Fiesta Bowl, where they defeated Notre Dame 41–9.

2001: Oregon came into the game needing only a victory over their arch-rival for the team&#x27;s first outright Pacific-10 Conference championship since 1994 and a trip to the Fiesta Bowl; the Beavers needed a win to secure a winning season. After OSU initially took a 6–3 lead into halftime, Oregon rallied behind a Keenan Howry punt return for a touchdown to give the Ducks a lead they would not relinquish, amidst a driving rainstorm. Final score: Ducks 17, Beavers 14.

2007: Oregon State wins 38–31 in double overtime at Autzen, the first road team to win the game in 10 attempts. The game featured a blocked Oregon State field goal with 1:01 remaining, followed by a missed Oregon field goal as regulation expired.

2008: Oregon State needed a victory to get a bid to the 2009 Rose Bowl, their first Rose Bowl in 44 years. Instead, Oregon ran away with a 65–38 blowout, setting series records for the most points scored by one team and the most total points scored.

2009: Called the &quot;War for the Roses&quot;, because it was the first time a win guaranteed a Rose Bowl berth. In a back-and-forth game, Oregon won, 37–33. The Ducks represented the Pac-10 in the 2010 Rose Bowl, their first appearance since 1995.

2010: Oregon, coming into the game second in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings, needed to win the game to secure a spot in the BCS championship game. Oregon State, at 5–6, needed a win to become bowl eligible. With ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College GameDay&quot; staged in Corvallis for the first time, the Ducks won 37–20 to secure a spot against Auburn in the national title game.

2016: Oregon State RB Ryan Nall rushed for 155 yards and 4 touchdowns, as Oregon State beat Oregon 34–24, after the Beavers outscored the Ducks 13–0 in the 4th quarter to take the lead, and snap the Ducks&#x27; 8-game win streak in the rivalry from 2008 to 2015, which was tied for the longest ever in the rivalry. After the game, the Corvallis crowd stormed the field in celebration.

2017: Both the Ducks and Beavers entered this game carrying sub-par seasons. The Ducks stood at 6–5, while the Beavers were riding a nine-game losing streak at The game was one for the history books, with Oregon rolling to a 69–10 win, setting records for the series in both points scored and margin of victory. It was Oregon&#x27;s ninth win in the last ten meetings, and it offered a sense of revenge for the Ducks after dropping the prior year&#x27;s meeting in Corvallis. Royce Freeman scored two rushing TDs in the first half of to break OSU&#x27;s Ken Simonton&#x27;s all-time Pac-12 rushing touchdown record, which stood at 59 for 16 years. It would mark Royce&#x27;s 60th rushing touchdown for the Ducks. He also piled up 122 rushing yards which moved him into seventh all-time in NCAA history.

2020: In the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened 2020 season, No. 15 Oregon entered the game with a 3–0 record to Oregon State&#x27;s 1–2. In the game Jermar Jefferson rushed for 226 yards which is the most rushing yards ever in a game in the rivalry. After dropping behind by 12 entering the fourth quarter, Jermar Jefferson led the Beavers to an improbable 41–38 win on a foggy night in Corvallis in front of an empty stadium, knocking the Ducks out of playoff contention and notching the Beavers&#x27; first victory over a ranked opponent since 2014.

2022: In the 2022 edition of the rivalry, Oregon entered the game ranked No. 9 in the country and Oregon State entered the game ranked No. 21 in the country. The Ducks stormed out to a 31–10 lead by the third quarter, but the Beavers, behind a potent rushing attack, scored touchdowns on all of their next four drives to take a 38–34 lead. The Ducks then went on a time-consuming drive, but failed to convert a fourth and goal at the Oregon State 3 yard line, thus allowing Oregon State to take possession. The Beavers then picked up a first down and ran out the clock to complete an improbable comeback.

2023: In the last matchup as Pac-12 conference opponents, Oregon won their 8th consecutive game of the series at home by a score of 31-7. The victory clinched a spot for the Ducks in the Pac-12 Championship Game.

==Notable game-related incidents==

1910: Following a 12–0 Oregon victory in Corvallis, fans of both teams began a verbal argument that escalated into exceedingly rowdy behavior as Webfoots fans returned to the train station to leave. The UO&#x27;s public relations department spread stories of Oregon Agricultural College hooliganism to the statewide press, offending students of OAC and causing the rivalry to be suspended for 1911.

1937: After defeating Oregon 14–0 in Corvallis, Oregon State fans had a large rally the next evening that lasted for six hours. Approximately 2,000 Oregon State students decided to caravan the following day to Eugene and have another celebration. State police initially halted the group, then agreed to lead them through the town if they agreed to behave. However, once Oregon students got out of class, the situation escalated with Webfoots pelting Beavers with tomatoes and water balloons, some Oregon State students were thrown into the millrace, and other OSU students taken to Skinner Butte, stripped and forced to repaint the &quot;O&quot; hillside letter yellow and slide down the painted surface.

1954: Approximately 50 UO students infiltrated Corvallis and lit the traditional OSU homecoming bonfire early. While it had been done before, this time OSU students were able to capture 25 UO students and hold them &quot;prisoner&quot;. The captured students had their heads shaved, were painted orange and black and some were forced to do menial labor for OSU fraternities. One captured UO student was marched through the OSU campus with a sign that said &quot;I&#x27;m a dumb Duck&quot;. Meanwhile, the UO raiding party kidnapped a single OSU student and paraded him around the UO campus.

1960: A UO student (LH) and a friend (FF) abducted the Oregon State Homecoming queen Ardis Henry from in front of her sorority house while the front yard was being decorated by 20+ fraternity guys.  The Oregon State student body president was served a ransom note, asking him to ride a bicyle or scooter to UofO and invite the Ducks to the Civil War game. Unfortunately, he was not in the same spirit, and refused. Ardis was a sweetheart, and went along with it as long as she made it back for dinner. She was returned with time to spare.

1972: After a 30–3 UO victory at Corvallis which ended an eight-game win streak in the series by the Beavers, Ducks fans stormed the OSU field to take down goal posts; after taking down the south goalposts, Beavers fans attempted to defend the north goalposts, resulting in a large brawl.

2010: After a 37–20 victory which sent the Ducks to the 2011 Tostitos BCS National Championship Game, a group of Duck fans lit on fire a t-shirt with the phrase &quot;I hate your Ducks&quot; over the Beavers logo on the field. The resulting fire caused significant damage to the artificial turf. Police used a photo of the incident from the &quot;Portland Tribune&quot; to arrest a University of Oregon student and charge him with riot and several misdemeanors.

2022: Following Oregon State&#x27;s 38–34 win at Reser Stadium, UO linebacker DJ Johnson punched an Oregon State fan after what appeared to be some arguing between the two. No action has yet been taken on the altercation.

<doc id="1195660" wikidata="Q5415872" url="?curid=1195660" title="Evans &amp; Sutherland ES-1">
<text>The ES-1 was Evans &amp; Sutherland&#x27;s abortive attempt to enter the supercomputer market. It was aimed at technical and scientific users who would normally buy a machine like a Cray-1 but did not need that level of power or throughput for graphics-heavy workloads. About to be released just as the market was drying up in the post-Cold War military wind-down, only a handful were built and only two sold.

==Background==
Jean-Yves Leclerc was a computer designer who was unable to find funding in Europe for a high-performance server design. In 1985 he visited Dave Evans, his former PhD. adviser, looking for advice. After some discussion he eventually convinced him that since most of their customers were running E&amp;S graphics hardware on Cray Research machines and other supercomputers, it would make sense if E&amp;S could offer their own low-cost platform instead.

Eventually a new Evans &amp; Sutherland Computer Division, or ESCD, was set up in 1986 to work on the design. Unlike the rest of E&amp;S&#x27;s operations which are headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, it was felt that the computer design would need to be in the &quot;heart of things&quot; in Silicon Valley, and the new division was set up in Mountain View, California.

==Basic design==
Instead of batch mode number crunching, the design would be tailored specifically to interactive use. This would include a built-in graphics engine and 2 GB of RAM, running BSD Unix 4.2. The machine would offer performance on par with contemporary Cray and ETA Systems.

===8 × 8 crossbar===
The basic idea of Leclerc&#x27;s system was to use an 8×8 crossbar switch to connect eight custom CMOS CPUs together at high speed. An extra channel on the crossbar allowed it to be connected to another crossbar, forming a single 16-processor unit. The units were 16-sized (instead of 8) in order to fully utilize a 16-bank high-speed memory that had been designed along with the rest of the system. Since memory was logically organized on the &quot;far side&quot; of the crossbars, the memory controller handled many of the tasks that would normally be left to the processors, including interrupt handling and virtual memory translation, avoiding a trip through the crossbar for these housekeeping tasks.

The resulting 16-unit processor/memory blocks could then be connected using another 8×8 crossbar, creating a 128-processor machine. Although the delays between the 16-unit blocks would be high, if the task could be cleanly separated into units the delay would not have a huge effect on performance. When data did have to be shared across the banks the system balanced the requests; first the &quot;leftmost&quot; processor in the queue would get access, then the &quot;rightmost&quot;. Processors added their requests onto the proper end of the queue based on their physical location in the machine. It was felt that the simplicity and speed of this algorithm would make up for the potential gains of a more complex load-balancing system.

===Instruction pipeline===
In order to allow the system to work even with the high inter-unit latencies, each processor used an 8-deep instruction pipeline. Branches used a variable delay slot, the end of which was signaled by a bit in the next instruction. The bit indicated that the results of the branch had to be re-merged at this point, stalling the processor until this took place. Each processor also included a floating point unit from Weitek. For marketing purposes, each processor was called a &quot;computational unit&quot;, and a card-cage populated with 16 was referred to as a &quot;processor&quot;. This allowed favorable per-processor performance comparisons with other supercomputers of the era.

The processors ran at 20 MHz in the integer units and 40 MHz for the FPUs, with the intention being to increase this to 50 MHz by the time it shipped. At about 12 Mflops peak per CU, the machine as a whole would deliver up to 1.5 Gflops, although due to the memory latencies this was typically closer to 250 Mflops. While this was fast for a CMOS machine processor of the time, it was hardly competitive for a supercomputer. Nevertheless, the machine was air cooled, and would have been the fastest such machine on the market.

The machine ran an early version of the Mach kernel for multi-processor support. The compilers were designed to keep the processors as full as possible by reducing the number of branch delay slots, and did a particularly good job of it.

==Fatal flaw==
When it was introduced in 1989, configurations ran from $2 to $8 million, with the largest claimed to run at 1.6 Gflops. In trying to position the machine, Ivan Sutherland noted that their flight simulation systems actually ran at higher speeds, and that the ES-1 was &quot;a step down for us&quot;.

When the machine was first announced it was notable for its price/performance ratio. It completely outperformed most competitors machines, at least in theory. With peak performance of 1600 MIPS and a price $2.2 million, it was $1375/MIPS, compared to a contemporary Alliant FX/40 minicomputer at $4650/MIPS. A 1989 &quot;Computerworld&quot; review of the market for mid-range high-performance machines showed only one machine in the same class, the Connection Machine CM-2.

The new leftmost-rightmost algorithm had a fatal flaw. In high-contention cases the &quot;middle&quot; units would never be serviced, and could stall for thousands of cycles. By 1989, it was clear this was going to need a redesign, but by this point other machines with similar price/performance ratios were coming on the market and the pressure was on to ship immediately. The first two machines were shipped to Caltech in October 1989 and the University of Colorado at Boulder in November, but there were no other immediate sales. One sample ES-1 is in storage at the Computer History Museum.

Evans resigned from the E&amp;S board in 1989, and suddenly the votes turned against continuing the project. E&amp;S looked for a buyer who was interested in continuing the effort, but finding none they instead closed the division in January 1990.

<text>C. Clark Kissinger (born 1940) was the National Secretary of Students for a Democratic Society in 1964–1965. He visited the People&#x27;s Republic of China twice during the Cultural Revolution, and is a devoted Maoist. His writings frequently appear in &quot;Revolution&quot;, journal of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA. He was an activist for Refuse and Resist and Not in Our Name, and is an activist for World Can&#x27;t Wait.

==Early life and education==

Kissinger graduated from the University of Chicago in 1960. He had previously attended Shimer College, a Great Books college then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Subsequently, Kissinger became a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin.

==1960s activism==

As National Secretary of SDS, Kissinger was the principal organizer of the first March on Washington against the war on Vietnam in April, 1965. He faced heavy pressure from the League for Industrial Democracy to incorporate opposition to North Vietnam, but kept the motto of the march as simply &quot;End the War in Vietnam&quot;, focusing on the need for immediate US withdrawal. He hoped to build SDS by being the first organization to hold a national march against the war.

In 1968, the Chicago Peace Council hired Kissinger to organize a march against the Vietnam War on April 27. Later in the year, he helped organize demonstrations against the Democratic Party National Convention, and testified at the trial of the Chicago Seven.

==Subsequent activism==

In the early 1970s, Kissinger was a founder and national officer of the US China Peoples Friendship Association.

In 1987, Kissinger co-founded the human rights activist group Refuse &amp; Resist!. He became head of the group&#x27;s operations in support of Mumia Abu-Jamal. In that capacity, he became particularly known for successfully lobbying the City Council of Santa Cruz, California to adopt a resolution supporting a new trial for Abu-Jamal. In 2000, Kissinger served 90 days in jail after being convicted of violating his probation by speaking at a rally against the death penalty in Philadelphia. The probation had been imposed based on Kissinger&#x27;s conviction for participating in a peaceful protest in support of Abu-Jamal in Philadelphia. Kissinger had requested permission from the court to speak at the rally, but it was denied.

In the 1990s, Kissinger also drew attention for his position that the participants in the 1992 Los Angeles riots were social revolutionaries rather than rioters as portrayed in the media.

In 2002, Kissinger was the coordinator of the Not In Our Name statement of conscience against the impending war on Iraq. Pro-war commentators such as Christopher Hitchens and Laura Ingraham pointed to Kissinger&#x27;s involvement as indicating that opposition to the war was being organized by the far left. Subsequently, he was also the convener of the International Commission of Inquiry on Crimes Against Humanity Committed by the Bush Administration. When the commission released its findings, he was quoted as saying &quot;We want this to be a step in the building of mass resistance to war, to torture, to the destruction of the earth.&quot;

Kissinger is currently the manager of Revolution Books in New York City.

<text>Bernardine Rae Dohrn (née Ohrnstein; born January 12, 1942) is a retired American law professor and a former leader of the far-left militant organization Weather Underground in the United States. As a leader of the Weather Underground in the early 1970s, Dohrn was on the FBI&#x27;s 10 Most Wanted list for several years. She remained a fugitive, even though she was removed from the list. After coming out of hiding in 1980, Dohrn pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of aggravated battery and bail jumping.

Dohrn had graduated from the University of Chicago Law School in 1967. During the 1980s, she was employed by the Sidley &amp; Austin law firm. From 1991 to 2013, Dohrn was a Clinical Associate Professor of Law at the Children and Family Justice Center at Northwestern University School of Law. She is married to Bill Ayers, a co-founder of the Weather Underground.

==Early life==
Bernardine Dohrn was born Bernardine Ohrnstein in Chicago, Illinois, in 1942, and moved to Whitefish Bay, an upper-middle-class suburb of Milwaukee as a young child, where she was raised the majority of her childhood. Her father, Bernard D. Ohrnstein, changed the family surname to Dohrn (his middle initial plus the first letters of his last name) when Bernardine was in high school. Her father was Jewish, although the name change was intended to obscure that, and her mother, Dorothy (née Soderberg), was of Swedish background and a Christian Scientist. Dohrn graduated from Whitefish Bay High School, where she was a cheerleader, treasurer of the Modern Dance Club, a member of the National Honor Society, and editor of the school newspaper.

She attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, for one year before transferring to the University of Chicago, where she graduated with honors with a B.A. in political science in 1963. Dohrn received her J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School in 1967. While attending law school, Dohrn began working in support of civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. and became the first law student organizer for the National Lawyers Guild.
==Activist career==

===Students for a Democratic Society involvement===

Dohrn became one of the leaders of the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM), a radical wing of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), in the late 1960s. Dohrn with ten other SDS members associated with the RYM issued, on June 18, 1969, a sixteen-thousand-word manifesto entitled &quot;You Don&#x27;t Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows&quot;, in &quot;New Left Notes&quot;. The title came from Bob Dylan&#x27;s song, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues.&quot; The manifesto stated that &quot;the goal [of revolution] is the destruction of US imperialism and the achievement of a classless world: world communism.&quot;

The manifesto concludes with the following:

The RYM must also lead to the effective organization needed to survive and to create another battlefield of the revolution. A revolution is a war; when the Movement in this country can defend itself militarily against total repression it will be part of the revolutionary war. This will require a cadre organization, effective secrecy, self-reliance among the cadres ...

The manifesto also asserted that African-Americans were a &quot;black colony&quot; within a U.S. government that was doomed to overextend itself. And the RYM was needed to quicken this process. Dohrn said, &quot;The best thing that we can be doing for ourselves, as well as for the [Black] Panthers and the revolutionary black liberation struggle, is to build a fucking white revolutionary movement.&quot;

The ninth annual national SDS conference was held at the Chicago Coliseum on June 18–22, 1969, and the SDS collapsed in a Revolutionary Youth Movement-led upheaval. Soon after the Revolutionary Youth Movement became known as the Weathermen. Dohrn led the Weatherman faction in the SDS fight and continued to be a leader afterward. Larry Grathwohl, an FBI informant who was with the Weathermen from autumn 1969 through spring 1970, considered her one of the two top leaders of the organization, along with Bill Ayers.
On May 26, 1968, as a speaker for the National Lawyers Guild, Dohrn said she was filing a motion in federal court asking for an injunction to halt any disciplinary action that was being taken against student activists and represented students from Columbia University who were striking and protesting. On June 14, 1968, Dohrn was elected the Inter-organizational Secretary of SDS, and, once elected, was asked if she was a socialist. She replied, &quot;I consider myself a revolutionary communist.&quot; From August 30 to September 1, 1968, Dohrn visited Yugoslavia. Her involvement with SDS and political advocacy stretch beyond the United States as well, as she and other SDS leaders had met with representatives from North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in Budapest, Hungary to discuss peace talks. She and a delegation from the SDS also traveled to Cuba via Mexico City, Mexico on July 4, 1969, and later arrived in Canada via a Cuban vessel on August 16, 1969.

On the night of October 1, 1968, Dohrn spoke at a meeting in Chicago to condemn Chicago&#x27;s Mayor Daley&#x27;s orders to attack protesters during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Then, from October 11 to 13, she and SDS held a national meeting at the University of Colorado Boulder wherein Dohrn was a speaker addressing concerns about where the movement was headed and what involvement they could expect as governmental tensions mounted and the student movement splintered into factions. On October 11, 1968, Dohrn suggested she would expand the movement to non-students and do all that was necessary to complete the job of &quot;attack, expose, destroy.&quot; Dohrn continued to give speeches on behalf of SDS and Weather Underground and attend leadership conferences for both organizations. On January 29 and 30, 1969, in recognition of the tenth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, the University of Washington held a Cuba teach-in where Dohrn was a speaker on campus. A month later at a press conference at the regional headquarters of SDS in Chicago, Dohrn spoke of the plans that were under way to &quot;attack&quot; college graduation ceremonies across the country, saying, &quot;Our presence will be known at the graduation ceremonies where the big people will come as speakers.&quot; By that time, Dohrn was known as a National Interim Committee member of the SDS and a member of the Weatherman group.

===Weather Underground involvement===
The Weather Underground was a radical left militant organization responsible for bombings of the United States Capitol, the Pentagon, and several police stations in New York, as well as the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion that killed three of its members.

Dohrn was a principal signatory on the Weather Underground&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of a State of War&quot; in May 1970 that formally declared &quot;war&quot; on the U.S. Government, and completed the group&#x27;s transformation from political advocacy to violent action. She recorded the declaration and sent a transcript of a tape recording to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Dohrn also co-wrote (with Bill Ayers) and published the subversive manifesto &quot;Prairie Fire&quot; in 1974 and participated in the covertly filmed &quot;Underground&quot; in 1976. In late 1975, the Weather Underground put out an issue of a magazine, &quot;Osawatomie&quot;, which carried an article by Dohrn entitled &quot;Our Class Struggle&quot;; the article was described as a speech given to the organization&#x27;s cadres on September 2 of that year. In the article, Dohrn clearly stated support for communist ideology:

We are building a communist organization to be part of the forces which build a revolutionary communist party to lead the working class to seize power and build socialism. ... We must further the study of Marxism-Leninism within the WUO [Weather Underground Organization]. The struggle for Marxism-Leninism is the most significant development in our recent history. ... We discovered thru our own experiences what revolutionaries all over the world have found — that Marxism-Leninism is the science of revolution, the revolutionary ideology of the working class, our guide to the struggle ...

According to a 1974 FBI study of the group, Dohrn&#x27;s article signaled a developing commitment to Marxism-Leninism that had not been clear in the group&#x27;s previous statements, despite their trips to Cuba and contact with Vietnamese communists there.

===Statements about Tate-LaBianca murders===
Dohrn was criticized for comments she made about the murders of actress Sharon Tate and retail store owners Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by the Charles Manson clan. In a speech during the December 1969 &quot;War Council&quot; meeting organized by the Weathermen, attended by about 400 people in Flint, Michigan, Dohrn said, &quot;First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, then they even shoved a fork into the pig Tate&#x27;s stomach! Wild!&quot; In greeting each other, delegates to the war council often spread their fingers to signify the fork.

==Arrests and trials==
On August 22, 1969, Dohrn was arrested in Chicago and charged with possession of drugs. The defense argued that Chicago Police had conducted an illegal search of the car in which she was a passenger, which led Judge Kenneth R. Wendt of the Narcotics Court of Chicago to dismiss the charges. On September 20, 1969, at an anti-Vietnam War rally at the Davis Cup tennis tournament in Cleveland, police arrested Dohrn and twenty other persons on charges of disorderly conduct. On September 26, 1969, Dohrn was arrested again in Chicago during a rally in support of the eight men accused of conspiracy concerning protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, who were on trial for riot conspiracy charges. Dohrn was next arrested on October 9, 1969, by the Chicago police during a rally for the women&#x27;s faction of the Weathermen group and was later released on a $1,000 bond. On October 31, 1969, a grand jury indicted 22 people, including Dohrn, for their involvement with the trial of the Chicago Eight, and she was again indicted on April 2, 1970, when a Federal Grand Jury indicted twelve members of the Weatherman group on conspiracy charges in violation of anti-riot acts during the &quot;Days of Rage.&quot; However, all of these convictions were reversed on November 21, 1972, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on the basis the judge was biased in his refusal to permit defense attorneys to screen prospective jurors for cultural and racial bias.

Due to the increasing volatility of the Weather Underground led by Dohrn, on October 14, 1970, Dohrn was added to the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. She was removed in December 1973, after District Court Judge Damon Keith dismissed the case against the Weathermen. That dismissal was followed shortly by another, when, on January 3, 1974, Judge Julius Hoffman dismissed a 4-year-old case against twelve members of the Weatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic Society, including Dohrn. She had been charged with leading the riotous &quot;Days of Rage&quot;.

===Coming out of hiding===
While on the run from police, Dohrn used many aliases (including Bernardine Rae Ohrnstein, H.T. Smith, and Marion Del Gado) and married another Weatherman leader, Bill Ayers, with whom she has two children. During the last years of their underground life, Dohrn and Ayers resided in Chicago, where they used the aliases Christine Louise Douglas and Anthony J. Lee. In the late 1970s, the Weatherman group split into two factions, the &quot;May 19 Coalition&quot; and the &quot;Prairie Fire Collective&quot;, with Dohrn and Ayers in the latter. The Prairie Fire Collective favored coming out of hiding, with members facing the criminal charges against them, while the May 19 Coalition remained in hiding. A decisive factor in Dohrn&#x27;s decision to come out of hiding were her concerns about her children.

The couple turned themselves in to authorities in 1980. While some charges relating to their activities with the Weathermen were dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct (see COINTELPRO), Dohrn pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of aggravated battery and bail jumping for which she was put on probation. After refusing to testify against ex-Weatherman Susan Rosenberg in an armed robbery case, Dohrn was held in contempt of a grand jury and served seven months in prison. Shortly after turning themselves in, Dohrn and Ayers became legal guardians of future San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin, the son of former members of the Weather Underground Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, after the couple were convicted of murder for their roles in a 1981 armored car robbery.

==Later life and professional career==

From 1984 to 1988, Dohrn was employed by the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin, where she was hired by Howard Trienens, the head of the firm, who knew Thomas G. Ayers, Dohrn&#x27;s father-in-law. &quot;We often hire friends,&quot; Trienens told a reporter for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. However, Dohrn had not been admitted to the New York or Illinois bar even though she had passed both bar exams; she did not submit an application to the New York Supreme Court&#x27;s Committee on Character and Fitness, and she was turned down by the Illinois ethics committee because of her criminal record. Trienens said of the Illinois rejection, &quot;Dohrn didn&#x27;t get a [law] license because she&#x27;s stubborn. She wouldn&#x27;t say she&#x27;s sorry.&quot;

In 1991, Dohrn was hired by Northwestern University School of Law as an adjunct professor. Her title was &quot;Clinical Associate Professor of Law&quot;. She was one of the founders of the Children and Family Justice Center in the Bluhm Legal Clinic at Northwestern Law. Because Dohrn was hired as an adjunct (a temporary assignment), her appointment did not require faculty approval. When law school officials were asked whether or not the dean or the board of trustees approved the hiring, the school responded as follows: &quot;While many would take issue with views Ms. Dohrn espoused during the 1960s, her career at the law school is an example of a person&#x27;s ability to make a difference in the legal system.&quot; She retired from Northwestern Law in 2013.

===Later politics===
In 1994, Dohrn said, &quot;I still see myself as a radical.&quot;

In 2008, Dohrn and Ayers resurfaced into news headlines as presidential candidate John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin publicly denounced the ties between Ayers and then-presidential candidate Barack Obama.

In a November 4, 2010, interview, Dohrn described the political &quot;right&quot; in the U.S. as racist, armed, hostile, and &quot;unspeakable&quot;. Referring to the August 28, 2010 Restoring Honor rally which was promoted by Glenn Beck and held at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., Dorhn said, &quot;You have white people armed, demanding the end to the [Obama] presidency.&quot; She has also asserted that &quot;the real terrorist is the American government, state terrorism unleashed against the world.&quot;

=== Personal life and family ===
Dohrn&#x27;s son, Zayd Ayers Dohrn, is married to actress and writer Rachel DeWoskin.

<text>Rubem Fonseca (May 11, 1925 – April 15, 2020) was a Brazilian writer.

==Life and career==

He was born in Juiz de Fora, in the state of Minas Gerais, but he lived most of his life in Rio de Janeiro. In 1952, he started his career as a low-level cop and, later became a police commissioner, one of the highest ranks in the civil police of Brazil. Following the steps of American novelist Thomas Pynchon, a close friend of Fonseca, he refused to give interviews and felt strongly about maintaining his privacy.

His stories are dark and gritty, filled with violence and sexual content, and usually set in an urban environment. He claimed a writer should have the courage to show what most people are afraid to say. Authors from the rising generation of Brazilian writers, such as Patrícia Melo or Luiz Ruffato, have stated that Fonseca&#x27;s writing has influenced their work.

He started his career by writing short stories, while first popular novel was &quot;A Grande Arte&quot; (&quot;High Art&quot;), followed by &quot;Agosto&quot;. One recurring character in Fonseca&#x27;s books is the lawyer-detective Mandrake.

In 2003, he won the Camões Prize, considered the most important award in the Portuguese language.

In 2012, he became the first recipient of Chile&#x27;s Manuel Rojas Ibero-American Narrative Award.

He died in Rio de Janeiro in April 2020 at the age of 94.

<text>Santa Monica College (SMC) is a public community college in Santa Monica, California. Founded as a junior college in 1929, SMC enrolls over 30,000 students in more than 90 fields of study. The college initially served pre-college high school students, eventually expanding its enrollment to educate college-age and non-traditional students with the intention to transfer to a four-year university. The college has high transfer rates to four-year universities such as the University of California and California State University campuses, being a leader among state community colleges in transfers to the former.

==History==
===20th century===
Santa Monica Junior College was established in September 1929 with 7 faculty members and 153 students in classes held on the second floor of Santa Monica High School. Attended primarily by high school students, it was originally part of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. Despite the ensuing Wall Street Crash of 1929 and Great Depression, the school&#x27;s enrollment increased to 355 in 1930 and 600 in 1931. In 1932, the college moved to the vacant brick Garfield Elementary School building on Michigan Avenue. The building was declared unsafe following the 1933 Long Beach earthquake and classes moved to tents and bungalows on the Garfield site, which students nicknamed Splinterville.

In 1940, following a number of failed attempts to relocate to a larger property, the school purchased 6.18 acres on Pico Boulevard for $10,197. In 1945, the junior college changed its name to Santa Monica City College. The Pico Boulevard and 17th Street campus opened on January 18, 1952, to 1,200 students. The college&#x27;s first bond measure was passed in 1946 for the construction of Corsair Stadium, which began in 1946 and was completed in 1948. In 1969, the college secured its own governing board under the creation of the Santa Monica Junior College District. In 1970, the school changed its name from Santa Monica City College to Santa Monica College.

====Financial crisis====
Santa Monica College experienced a financial crisis in 1972 when the state of California changed the age of majority from 21 to 18. Since the state paid $40 more per unit of attendance of minors than adults, the change cut SMC&#x27;s budget in half. Additionally, state funding for community college students in California went to the student&#x27;s home district and not the college&#x27;s district. SMC had a contract with the City of Los Angeles to finance students from Los Angeles but since one-third of SMC students were from districts outside of Los Angeles the city would lose even more funding. As a result, Los Angeles planned to cancel its financial compensation contract with SMC. The college consequently sent termination letters to all faculty and staff, effective September 1972. The crisis was halted on March 8, 1972, when the California State Senate passed a bill temporarily exempting community colleges from the financial effects of the change in the age of adulthood. On March 21, 1972, the college renegotiated its contract with the City of Los Angeles and rehired its faculty and staff.

In 1980, the college built a new library and transformed the previous library building into the Letters and Science Building.

===21st century===

In 2012 Santa Monica College received national attention due to a controversial plan to create a two-tier system of education in which more &quot;popular&quot; courses would be offered at higher costs. Protests at a board meeting immediately following the plan&#x27;s proposal led to several students being pepper sprayed. A report on the event resulted in an officer&#x27;s dismissal. The report also faulted several members of the protest for provoking officers. Some people exclaimed &quot;We got pepper sprayed! We won&quot; after the incident.

====2013 shooting====

On June 7, 2013, a killing spree occurred in Santa Monica that left a total of five people dead, including the gunman and injured five others. The incident started several miles off-campus before the gunman traveled to SMC and entered the college&#x27;s library, where he was later fatally shot by police. School officials put the campus on lockdown as Los Angeles Police Department officers, including SWAT, cleared the campus. Local law enforcement stated that they did not view the incident as a &quot;school shooting&quot; because the incident started off-campus.

====2024 shooting====
On October 14, 2024, a tragic shooting occurred at the Santa Monica College Center for Media and Design, where a custodial operations manager, Felicia Hudson, was critically injured. The incident took place just before 10:00 PM, leading to her immediate hospitalization. She succumbed to her injuries and died two days later, on October 16. The shooting has been classified as a case of workplace violence, with the suspect identified as Davon Durell Dean, also an SMC employee. After an extensive manhunt, Dean was found deceased in his vehicle in Hawthorne, having died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The college closed all campuses the remainder of the week to prioritize safety and support for the community. Classes resumed and the campus reopened again on Monday, October 21st.

<doc id="1195679" wikidata="Q161363" url="?curid=1195679" title="Zbigniew Herbert">
<text>Zbigniew Herbert (; 29 October 1924 – 28 July 1998) was a Polish poet, essayist, drama writer and moralist. He is one of the best known and the most translated post-war Polish writers. While he was first published in the 1950s (a volume titled &quot;Chord of Light&quot; was issued in 1956), soon after he voluntarily ceased submitting most of his works to official Polish government publications. He resumed publication in the 1980s, initially in the underground press. Since the 1960s, he has been nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in Literature. His books have been translated into 38 languages.

Herbert was educated as an economist and a lawyer. Herbert was one of the main poets of the Polish opposition to communism. Starting in 1986, he lived in Paris, where he cooperated with the journal &quot;Zeszyty Literackie&quot;. He came back to Poland in 1992.
On 1 July 2007 the Polish Government instituted 2008 as the Year of Zbigniew Herbert. In 2013, the Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award was established in honour of the poet and his literary legacy. He received the 1963 Kościelski Prize (Geneva), 1965 Jurzykowski Prize, 1965 Austrian State Prize for European Literature, 1973 Herder Prize (Austria), 1979 Petrarca-Preis (Germany), and 1991 Jerusalem Prize (Israel).

Herbert claimed to be a distant relative of the 17th-century Anglo-Welsh poet George Herbert.

==Biography==

===1924–1956===

Herbert&#x27;s Austrian ancestor came to Galicia from Vienna around the turn of the 18th and 19th century. The poet&#x27;s father, Bolesław (half-blooded Armenian), was a soldier in the Polish Legions during World War I and a defender of Lwów; he was a lawyer and worked as a bank manager. Herbert&#x27;s grandfather was an English language teacher. Zbigniew&#x27;s mother, Maria, came from the Kaniak family.

Before the war Zbigniew Herbert attended the &quot;Państwowe VIII Gimnazjum i Liceum im. Króla Kazimierza Wielkiego we Lwowie&quot; (during the Soviet occupation the name was changed to &quot;High School nr 14&quot;). After the German and Soviet invasion and subsequent occupation of Lwów, he continued his studies at the secret meetings organized by the Polish underground, where he graduated and passed the A-level exam (matura) in January 1944. At the same time, (following the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939) he got involved in conspiratorial action with the AK. During the occupation, he worked as a feeder of lice in the Rudolf Weigl Institute that produced anti-typhus vaccines; he also worked as a salesman in a shop with metal articles. After his A-level exam, he began Polish philology studies at the secret University of Jan Kazimierz in Lwów but had to break them off as a result of moving to Kraków (spring 1944, before the invasion of the Soviet Red Army in Lwów). Lwów after the war became a Ukrainian Soviet city, no longer within Polish borders. Its previous Polish population had been expelled. The loss of his beloved hometown, and the following feeling of being uprooted, were important motifs in his later works.

At first, he lived in Proszowice, near Kraków (May 1944 – January 1945). Herbert studied economics in Kraków and attended lectures at the Jagiellonian University and at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1947, after three years of study, he got his Trade Academy diploma. He lived in Sopot (from 1948), where his parents moved in 1946. He worked different jobs; in the Polish National Bank (NBP) in Gdynia (1 March – 30 June 1948), as a sub-editor of the journal &quot;Przegląd Kupiecki&quot;, and in Gdańsk department of the &quot;Polish Writers&#x27; Union&quot; (ZLP). He met Halina Misiołkowa there (their relationship lasted until 1957). In 1948 he became a member-candidate of the ZLP but resigned in 1951; however, he joined the union again in 1955.

While living in Sopot, he continued his law studies at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, where he received a Master of Law. In the same year he was carried on the list on the second year of Philosophy at NCU in Toruń, where he was inter alia a student of his later master, Henryk Elzenberg. In 1949 Herbert moved to Toruń, and worked in the District Museum and in primary school as a teacher.

In Autumn 1951 the poet moved to the University of Warsaw, where he continued studying philosophy for some time. At first, he lived alone in very poor conditions in suburban Warsaw, Brwinów, but then (December 1952 – January 1957), he lived in Warsaw itself on Wiejska Street in a room rented by 12 people. Subsequently, Herbert moved to an official flat on Aleje Jerozolimskie.

He tried to live from his writing. However, since he did not follow the official socrealistic style of literature and was unwilling to write political propaganda this proved to be unsuccessful. He published theatrical and musical criticisms and reports from exhibits which ignored the criteria of socrealistic art. In 1948 the weekly magazine &quot;Tygodnik Wybrzeża&quot; published his cycle &quot;Poetyka dla Laików&quot; (Poetry for Lay People). Herbert also published a few of his reviews in the journal &quot;Słowo Powszechne&quot; in 1949 under his real name and a year later under a pen name, Patryk. The same happened with his publishing in &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot;. In 1952 &quot;Przegląd Powszechny&quot;, published a few of his reviews under a pen name – Bolesław Hertyński.

He published under the pen name Stefan Martha in &quot;Dziś i Jutro&quot;, the PAX Association magazine (1950–1953). These periodicals represented a different styles of Catholicism. Pax sought to &#x27;collaborate&#x27; with the communist government, while &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; took a more oppositional stance (it was legal but its circulation was limited). Herbert definitely finished his cooperation with PAX in 1953. &quot;Przegląd Powszechny&quot; was closed and &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; was transferred to PAX after it refused to publish an obituary of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death. In this situation Herbert decided that his cooperation with PAX was impossible.

During this time, he also earned money from biographies and librarian registrations. From January until July 1952, he was a salaried blood donor. He also had to undertake a job not connected with writing again. He worked as a timekeeper in &quot;Inwalidzka Spółdzielnia Emerytów Nauczycieli &#x27;Wspólna Sprawa&quot;&#x27; (from 1 October 1953 till 15 January 1954), and also as a senior assistant in &quot;Centralne Biuro Studiów i Projektów Przemysłu Torfowego Projekt Torf&quot; (19 January – 31 November). Thanks to the help of Stefan Kisielewski, Herbert worked as a manager of the office of the Chief Management in &quot;the Union of Socialist Composers&quot; (ZKP) from September 1956 till March 1957.

===1956–1981===

The year 1956 in Poland marked the end of Stalinism and as a result also of social realism as the only and obligatory style in art and literature. This enabled Herbert&#x27;s debut as a poet. Thanks to this, his material position also improved. 
In 1957 supported by Jerzy Zawieyski he received a small studio to live in (in Warsaw) one of the flats distributed for young writers by the Polish Union of Writers (ZLP). He also was granted a scholarship (US$100) that allowed him to go on his first trip abroad.

Herbert was attached to his homeland, but at the same time was deeply disgusted by all effects (political, economical, cultural etc.) of the communist rules enforced by the Soviet Union on Poland (arguably the best artistic expression of this disgust is contained in his poem &quot;The Power of Taste&quot;). Therefore, a will to escape from this gloomy reality and see &quot;a better world&quot; was one of important driving forces behind his passion for traveling.
Even though he spent a great deal of time abroad he never wanted to choose the life of an émigré. Despite administrative difficulties imposed by the communist regime with regard to longer stays abroad he always tried to extend his Polish passport while abroad so that the possibility of coming back home was always open. 
His first lively impressions from his trips and reflections triggered by the direct contact with the cultural heritage of the Western Europe were enclosed in the essay &quot;The Barbarian in the Garden&quot; (Barbarzyńca w Ogrodzie, 1962). He also says in his poem &quot;The Prayer of Mr. Cogito – The Traveller&quot; (&quot;Modlitwa Pana Cogito – podróżnika&quot;) travelling allowed him to get to know better &quot;the world beautiful and of such variety&quot;.

Herbert&#x27;s trips cost as little as possible, as a poet&#x27;s finances (from not stable sources: prizes, honorariums for the readings etc.) were very limited. This way of life contributed to his weak health condition in the future; however, 
he traveled through Vienna to France (May 1958 – January 1959), he visited England (January – March 1959), Italy (June – July 1959) and then France again. He came to Poland in May 1960. The result of that journey was the essay &quot;Barbarzyńca w ogrodzie&quot; (&quot;The Barbarian in the Garden&quot;).

In Autumn 1960 Herbert travelled to England and Scotland. In December 1963 he went to Paris. In January 1964 he was given the Kościelski Prize in the Polish Library in Paris, which allowed him to extend his stay in the West. In 1964 he spent the summer in Italy (July – August) and in Greece (October 1964). Then he came back to France and at the end of that year he returned to Poland.

From 1965 till 1968 he was a member of the editorial team at the monthly magazine &quot;Poetry&quot;. In 1965-1966 he was a literary manager of the Juliusz Osterwa Theatre in Gorzów Wielkopolski.

In October 1965 he was awarded with The Lenau Prize, and he went Vienna to receive it. This period also marks a growing international esteem for Herbert as a man of culture. He becomes a member of Academy of Arts in West Berlin and Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. He stayed in Austria till spring 1966.

Herbert traveled across Germany, and then stayed longer in France (June 1966 – September 1967). He then went back to Germany, visiting the Netherlands and Belgium. On 29 March 1968, he married Katarzyna Dzieduszycka at a Polish consulate in France. At the end of April, the Herberts returned to Berlin. In the summer of 1968, Herbert visited the US (invited by the Poetry Center). He went to New York, California, The Grand Canyon, New Mexico, New Orleans, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. At that time, the translation of his works was published in the U.S., which made Herbert one of the most popular contemporary poets in English literary circles. While traveling across the country, he gave several talks in New York, Berkeley and Los Angeles. After visiting the U.S., Herbert went back to Berlin, where he lived until September 1970 (with some short breaks to Poland and a holiday in Italy). In 1969, he took part in &quot;Dei Duo Mundi&quot; – The Festival of Two Worlds. From September 1970 to June 1971, the Herberts again stayed in the U.S., where the poet gave lectures as a visiting professor at California State University, Los Angeles.

From autumn 1971 to spring 1973, not having his own flat, he lived in Artur Międzyrzecki&#x27;s flat in Warsaw. In 1972, he became a member of the board of the Polish Literary Association (ZLP). At that time, he got involved in pro-democracy actions initiated by writer circles – he was one of the signatories of &#x27;List 17&#x27; (&#x27;Letter of 17&#x27;) which supported civil rights of the members of an openly anti-communist organization, The Movement (Ruch). He was also an organizer of protests against censorship. In 1972 he joined the Pen Club.
In 1973, he received the Herder&#x27;s Prize in Vienna. The summer of that year he spent together with Magdalena and Zbigniew Czajkowscy in Greece. He came back to Poland in autumn 1973. He spent the academic year of 1973–74 giving lectures at the University of Gdansk. In 1974, he wrote the &#x27;Letter of 15&#x27; (&#x27;List 15&#x27;) which was about the laws of the Polish Community in the Soviet Union. In December 1975, he signed &#x27;Letter of 59&#x27; (&#x27;Memoriał 59&#x27;) against the changes in the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland forced by the communist party introducing mostly declarations of eternal loyalty of Poland to the Soviet Union. In 1974, he settled on Promenade Street in Warsaw.

From 1975 to 1981, Herbert lived abroad, mainly in Germany, Austria and Italy.

===1981–1998===

Herbert came back to Poland at the beginning of 1981 – in the short period of the legal existence of Solidarity, the only independent mass organization in the Soviet bloc. At that time he joined the editorial team of the underground journal &quot;Zapis&quot; (&quot;Record&quot;). At the time of the martial law he supported the opposition personally, under his own name – he attended the secret meetings and published in &#x27;second circulation&#x27;. His writings have become the manifesto of freedom, the expression of the resistance and the poet himself has become the symbol of uncompromised objection, especially for the young people. Przemysław Gintrowski played a huge role in presenting Herbert to the contemporary audience. Together with Jacek Kaczmarski and Zbigniew Łapiński, he composed the music to the poet&#x27;s writings and performed it on stage. Herbert himself wasn&#x27;t pleased with these doings at the beginning. However, later he accepted them and joked that he &quot;writes lyrics for Gintrowski&quot;.

In 1986 Herbert moved to Paris. In 1989 he joined the &quot;Polish Writers&#x27; Association&quot; (Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich). A year later he became a member of the &quot;American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters&quot;. In 1991, receiving the Jerusalem Prize gave Herbert another reason to travel to Israel for a while. There he befriended Yehuda Amichai and wrote a poem about him. 
&quot;To Yehuda Amichai,
 Because you are a king and I&#x27;m only a prince&quot;...

In 1992 the seriously ill poet returned to Warsaw. The fierce anti-communist journalism of &quot;Tygodnik Solidarność&quot; (1994, # 41) and supporting the statement of the editorial office of &quot;Arka&quot; magazine about the decommunisation of the elites stoked the controversy among Herbert&#x27;s opposition friends. He praised the Cold War anti-communist spy Colonel Ryszard Kukliński in an open letter to then president Lech Wałęsa in 1994, and later also expressed support for the Chechen Dzjochar Dudajev. He also organized the financial aid for Chechnya. This wasn&#x27;t his only initiative. Earlier in an open letter to U.S. President George H. W. Bush he criticized the indifference towards the situation of Kurds. What is more, he supported the investigation of Liga Republikańska (Republican League) in the case of assassination of Stanisław Pyjas and advocated revealing the UB (Office of Security) files from 1956. In 1994 in the interview for &quot;Tygodnik Solidarność&quot; he criticized not only the Round Table Agreement and the politics of the Third Polish Republic (III Rzeczpospolita), but also accused some prominent public figures, such as Czesław Miłosz and Adam Michnik as being personally responsible for the country&#x27;s difficulties. These controversial opinions prompted counter-polemics that would continue even after Herbert&#x27;s death. This conflict has its roots in different judgments on the communist regime in Poland at the time of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland.

In 1993 Herbert became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1994, already in a wheelchair, he traveled to the Netherlands and visited an exhibition about the 17th century tulip mania in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad invited Herbert to visit this exhibition because he wrote a book with essays about the &quot;Golden age&quot; of the Netherlands.

The last years of his life he spent in bed fighting with severe asthma. Despite that he never stopped working – &quot;Epilog burzy&quot; (&quot;Epilogue to a Storm&quot;) was published shortly before his death.

Zbigniew Herbert died on 28 July 1998, in Warsaw. He was buried in Powązki Cemetery. President Aleksander Kwaśniewski sought posthumously to honor Herbert with the Order of the White Eagle, but his widow Katarzyna declined to accept the honor. On 3 May 2007, Herbert was posthumously awarded with the Order of the White Eagle by President Lech Kaczyński; Herbert&#x27;s widow Katarzyna and sister Halina Herbert-Żebrowska accepted the Order.

==Writing==

===Poetry===

The first poems by Zbigniew Herbert were published in &quot;Dziś i jutro&quot; (#37, 1950). Poems entitled: &quot;Napis&quot; (&quot;Inscription&quot;), &quot;Pożegnanie września&quot; and &quot;Złoty środek&quot; were printed, however, without the permission of the author. The real debut occurred at the end of the same year with the publishing of a poem without a title (&quot;Palce wrzeciona dźwięków…&quot;) in &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; (#51). Prior to 1955 the poet published some of his works in that newspaper; however, he kept out of the literary environment. Not having the opportunity to publish his own volume of poetry, he decided to publish 22 poems in an anthology of modern Catholic poetry, &quot;…każdej chwili wybierać muszę…&quot; (Warsaw, 1954).

Herbert was introduced to a wider audience in &quot;Premiera pięciu poetów&quot; (&quot;The debut of five poets&quot;) in the magazine &quot;Życie Literackie&quot; (#51, December 1955). He was presented together with other young poets, such as Miron Białoszewski, Bohdan Drozdowski, Stanisław Czycz and Jerzy Harasymowicz. In 1956 he published his debut book of poetry &quot;Struna światła&quot; (&quot;Chord of Light&quot;) and a year later a further volume &quot;Hermes, pies i gwiazda&quot; (&quot;Hermes, Dog and Star&quot;). Herbert&#x27;s relatively late debut meant that he belonged to the modern generation in literature which appeared after 1956, whereas biographically he belonged to the same generation as Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński and Tadeusz Różewicz.

Another two books of poetry: &quot;Studium przedmiotu&quot; (&quot;Study of the Object&quot;) and &quot;Napis&quot; (&quot;Inscription&quot;) were published in 1961 and 1969. In 1974 the main character from another book of poetry &quot;Pan Cogito&quot; (&quot;Mr. Cogito&quot;) appeared in Polish culture. The character of Pan Cogito also appeared in later works of the author. Herbert liked to use poetic personae (which cannot be identified with the author) and multistage irony – the introduction of a character favoured the game played by the author between himself and the reader.

In 1983 the Literary Institute in Paris published another book of poetry by Herbert entitled &quot;Raport z oblężonego Miasta i inne wiersze&quot; (&quot;Report from a Besieged City and Other Poems&quot;). In Poland it was reprinted by underground publishing houses. The time and the circumstances favored a literal understanding of the poem&#x27;s title, which led to simplistic interpretations of the poem. Another book of poems &quot;Elegia na odejście&quot; (&quot;Elegy for the Departure&quot;) (1990) was also published in Paris. In 1992, back in Poland, Herbert published &quot;Rovigo&quot; (Wrocław). Finally, the poet&#x27;s last work, &quot;Epilog burzy&quot; (&quot;Epilogue to a Storm&quot;), came out shortly before his death.

Herbert often uses elements of mythology, medieval heroes and works of art in his writing, which attracted the attention of the critics. Those elements, however, are not the dead parts of literary convention. Herbert uses the mechanism of special demythologization – he tries to get rid of any cultural layers (if possible) and reach the prototypes, face the antique heroes. In his literary output the past is not treated as something distant or closed – revived characters and events make possible an attempt at understanding not only history but also the current moment. The past is a measure of the present.

In Herbert&#x27;s poetry there is no consistent historiosophic conception. Quite the opposite – there is a clear rejection of systems which clarify everything, which explain a course of events as the inevitable logic of history. Everything that can be said about history is a result of a simple observation – namely, that history is (or at least has been so far) an area where evil is rife, which is accompanied by a handful of indomitable people constantly opposed to it. An individual is not able to change the course of history, but is obliged to put up a hopeless resistance despite everything. The ethical base of Herbert&#x27;s artistic work constitutes the conviction that the justice of a particular matter, and the actions taken in its defence, do not depend on the chance of victory. This pathetic message is accompanied by an ironic consciousness of the fact that it is delivered in a not very heroic period – a period in which a potential hero is exposed not so much to martyrdom as to ridicule. Characteristic of the contemporary world is a fuzzy borderline between good and evil, the degeneration of language, which deprives words of their clear-cut nature, and the common debasement of values. Contemporary evil is not demonic and cannot be easily defined. The hero, being aware of his own ridiculousness, provokes critical situations not only to preserve the faithfulness of the message but also in order to provoke and force evil to reveal its real nature.

But this hard assessment of the present does not mean idealizing history. The experiences of the last war have put an end to the naïve perception of the past. The exposer&#x27;s suspicion arises because visions of history are created usually by the winners&#x27; chroniclers. Therefore, what is under the fresco &quot;Przemiany Liwiusza&quot; (&quot;Transformations of Livy&quot;) should be diligently analyzed. The monumental picture of ancient heroes may be false, or in other ways – it can be based on judging criteria, which should not be acknowledged uncritically. It may be the vanquished who are entitled to our solidarity.

In Herbert&#x27;s view the field of history, although perhaps the easiest one on which to make observations, is not the only one in which evil reveals itself. The presence of evil entails the question of life&#x27;s meaning and order, and of the presence of God in the world. The history of literature has not yet settled the dispute over the sacred in Herbert&#x27;s poetry. In his earliest volumes one can see two completely different images of God: at one point he is almighty, cold, perfect and remote, at another rendered powerless by descending from heaven &quot;Kapłan&quot; (&quot;Priest&quot;), &quot;Rozmyślania Pana Cogito o odkupieniu&quot; (&quot;Mr. Cogito&#x27;s Reflections on Redemption&quot;). The first God is rather disliked, like all abstractions; everything that is valued in this poetry is small, tangible and close. After all, it is nothing else but the senses, especially the most unerring touch, which give us the most reliable support in everyday life. Moreover, in this poetry, one has never reconciled oneself to the collapse of the sacred, or to the world of chaos. Against everything, being loyal – even to the dead God – make sense. For want of any other refuge, we are supposed to seek the power within us to save the world from chaos and nothingness &quot;Napis&quot; (&quot;Inscription&quot;).

In his later works, there are fewer such pagan declarations, yet the need for reconciliation is articulated more and more clearly. Compared to the poems from &quot;Epilog Burzy&quot; (&quot;Epilogue to the Storm&quot;) and his previous works, &quot;Puste Niebo Pana Cogito&quot; was not well received by critics.

====Poetic style====

In his works he presents a perspective of &#x27;intellectual reflection&#x27;, with a stress on human beings and their dignity, on the background of history, where people are almost irrelevant cogs in the machine of fate. He often used elements of Mediterranean culture in his works.
&quot;Herbert&#x27;s steadily detached, ironic and historically minded style represents, I suppose, a form of classicism. But it is a one-sided classicism (...) In a way, Herbert&#x27;s poetry is typical of the whole Polish attitude to their position within the communist bloc; independent, brilliant, ironic, wary, a bit contemptuous, pained.&quot; – A. Alvarez, Under Pressure (1965)

&quot;If the key to contemporary Polish poetry is the selective experience of the last decades, Herbert is perhaps the most skillful in expressing it and can be called a poet of historical irony. He achieves a sort of precarious equilibrium by endowing the patterns of civilization with meanings, in spite of all its horrors.&quot; – Czesław Miłosz, Postwar Polish Poetry (3rd ed., 1983)

&quot;There is little doubt that at this writing Zbigniew Herbert is the most admired and respected poet now living in Poland. (...) Polish readers have always revered poets who succeed in defining the nation&#x27;s spiritual dilemma; what is exceptional in Herbert is that his popularity at home is matched by a wide acclaim abroad.&quot; – Stanisław Barańczak, A Fugitive from Utopia (1987)

In modern poetry, Herbert advocated semantic transparency. In a talk given at a conference organized by the journal &quot;Odra&quot; he said:
&quot;So not having pretensions to infallibility, but stating only my predilections, I would like to say that in contemporary poetry the poems that appeal to me the most are those in which I discern something I would call a quality of semantic transparency (a term borrowed from Husserl&#x27;s logic). This semantic transparency is the characteristic of a sign consisting in this: that during the time when the sign is used, attention is directed towards the object denoted, and the sign itself does not hold the attention. The word is a window onto reality.&quot;

===Essays===

&quot;Barbarzyńca w ogrodzie&quot; (&quot;Barbarian in the Garden&quot;), the result of Herbert&#x27;s first trip abroad, was published in 1962. It is composed of essays which describe particular places and things that have been seen by the poet, as well as two historical essays – accounts of the Albigensians and the persecution of the Templar order. The journey takes place in two dimensions simultaneously – it is both contemporary travel and time travel. The latter starts with prehistory, in the Lascaux caves, and travels through the age of Greek and Roman antiquity, the days of Gothic cathedrals, Renaissance painting and sentimental gardens. The journey becomes fascinating because the traveler shares with his readers the knowledge of both the less and the more serious history of the places, items and people portrayed in the essays. Herbert himself defined it as a journey not only to places, but also to books.

The Albigensian crusade and the collapse of the Knights Templars absorbed Herbert not because of their peculiarity, but quite the opposite, namely because of their ubiquity in history. Both are described by the poet with proper respect for historical detail and the drama of the individuals involved, thereby revealing the timeless mechanisms of crime.

Another collection of essays, &quot;Martwa natura z wędzidłem&quot; (&quot;Still Life with a Bridle&quot;), published in 1993, is devoted to seventeenth-century Dutch painting. Just as in &quot;Barbarzyńca w ogrodzie&quot;, here widely accepted assessments have no impact on the author&#x27;s personal preferences. Among Dutch painters, the one who fascinates Herbert the most is the hardly known Torrentius, whose work &quot;Martwa natura z wędzidłem&quot; is the only one to be preserved. In this volume of essays the figure of the traveler is less noticeable than previously. But people still arouse Herbert&#x27;s interest – not only painters, but also those who were buying and often ordering their works – since Dutch painting is typical of a certain civilization and could not exist in any other place or time.

Although written much earlier than &quot;Martwa natura z wędzidłem&quot;, the last volume of essays &quot;Labirynt nad morzem&quot; (&quot;Labyrinth on the Sea-Shore&quot;) was published only after the poet&#x27;s death. Herbert gave this volume to the &quot;Czytelnik&quot; publishing house in 1968, but later withdrew it. &quot;Labirynt nad morzem&quot; consists mainly of essays devoted to ancient Greek culture and history, as well as in a lesser degree to the Etruscans and the Roman legionnaires from Hadrian&#x27;s wall. This time, however, the traveler seems not to be seeking his own way – he deals with cultural monuments such as the Acropolis of Athens or Knossos. Yet when addressing the history of Greece, Herbert focuses on episodes which occupy few pages in textbooks, and subverts established patterns. He shows how Pericles&#x27; policy towards Samos became the beginning of the end of not only the union of Greek cities but also of Athenian democracy. The assessments of history are reviewed in the same way as in the poetry – by changing the perspective, rejecting the winners&#x27; point of view. It is in &quot;Labirynt nad morzem&quot; where this is most visible.

===Dramas===

All Herbert&#x27;s dramas were written relatively early. The first four dramas were written between the years 1956 and 1961; the last one, the monodrama &quot;Listy naszych czytelników&quot; (&quot;Letters from Our Readers&quot;), was written in 1972. Some of these works were created as radio plays, or later, adapted for radio. We can observe this in their structure as tension is produced mainly by means of sound (main characters&#x27; voices, sounds in the background, or silence); other theatrical devices appear to a lesser degree. The poet himself used the term &quot;drama for voices&quot;.

&quot;Jaskinia filozofów&quot; (&quot;Cave of Philosophers&quot;), probably the most valued among all Herbert&#x27;s dramas, and &quot;Rekonstrukcja poety&quot; (&quot;The Reconstruction of the Poet&quot;), deal with antiquity. The plot of &quot;Jaskinia filozofów&quot; is set in an Athenian prison cell, where the main character, Socrates, waits for his death sentence. Conversations held with his students, wife and warder let him conduct an examination of his life. However, this is not the only theme brought up in the drama. Socrates could easily escape if he wants, as the death penalty was intended to be token. Those by whom he was sentenced presume that he will escape, and they see to it that he has that possibility. Yet the philosopher does not reconcile himself to the hypocrisy of freedom without actual freedom – he goes to extremes and finally resigns himself to death. &quot;Rekonstrukcja poety&quot; refers to Homer. The author of great epics, being already blind, alters his view into something vital and worthy of interest – he no longer deals with the clamor of battle, but with detail, that which is considered to be most personal and fragile.

The remaining three dramas deal with more contemporary themes. The way of showing the ordinariness and triviality of situations in which evil reveals itself is extremely convincing. One can crave another&#x27;s room so much as to wish a neighbour&#x27;s death or even to contribute to it (&quot;Drugi pokój&quot; (&quot;The Other Room&quot;)). One can be deprived of everything that matters in life, as a result of inhuman regulations and human stupidity (&quot;Listy naszych czytelników&quot; (&quot;Letters From Our Readers&quot;)). In a small normal town, among respectable people, a murder can happen which no one is able to explain, and which no one attempted to stop (&quot;Lalek&quot;).

==Awards and prizes==

According to a note made by the secret police (SB) agent in the Polish Union of Writers (&quot;Związek Literatów Polskich&quot;) Herbert was a candidate for the 1968 Nobel Prize in Literature along with another Polish writer Witold Gombrowicz. This information was provided by the Nobel committee secretary who was visiting Poland at that time. A historian from the Instytut Pamięci Narodowej Rafał Sierchuła speculates that the communist government in Poland may have made active attempts to prevent them from receiving the prize, due to their anti-communist opinions.

==Legacy==
In 2000, an annual cultural festival, known as Herbertiada, was established in the port city of Kołobrzeg, northern Poland. It is dedicated to the memory of Zbigniew Herbert and his literary legacy. Various events, competitions and performances are organized, including two days that are devoted to workshops for young poets and recitations. The same year, Herbert was the subject of a documentary film &quot;Obywatel Poeta&quot; (Poet Citizen) directed by Jerzy Zalewski for TVP.

The Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award is an award for lifetime achievement given to a living poet writing in any language. It was established in 2012 in honor of Zbigniew Herbert by his widow, Katarzyna Dzieduszycka-Herbert. The award has been given to W.S. Merwin, Charles Simic, Ryszard Krynicki, and Lars Gustafsson.

The Parliament of Poland declared the &quot;Year of Zbigniew Herbert&quot; on two occasions: 2008 and 2018.

From May 2024, some Herbert′s manuscripts (poems &quot;The Message of Mr Cogito&quot;, &quot;Nike Who Hesitates&quot; and &quot;Elegy of Fortinbras&quot;) are presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth.

<text>Ravensthorpe is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in England. The village lies approximately midway between Northampton and Rugby. The M1 motorway is six miles west and the nearest railway station is at Long Buckby. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 656 people, including Coton but falling slightly to 646 at the 2011 census.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;outlying farm/settlement (&quot;thorpe&quot;) of Hrafn&#x27;.
Services within the village include a shop, the &#x27;Chequers&#x27; pub, a playing field, a small park and a woodland maintained by the Woodland Trust.

==History==
Iron Age and Roman pottery have been found around the village, indicating a possible settlement. By the time of the Domesday Survey, a settlement of either Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian origin was recorded.

The St Denys Church was built in the 13th Century on a site believed to have been in use since the time of William the Conqueror.

Mother Rhodes, who lived just outside the village, was alleged to be a witch during the Northamptonshire Witch Trials. During the trial, testimonies against Joan Vaughn and Agnes Brown alleged that they were seen with other ‘witches’, Katherine Gardiner and Joan Lucus, visiting Mother Rhodes, who was found dying according to &quot;The Witches of Northamptonshire&quot;: &quot;It was credthly reported that some fort-night before their apprehension, this Agnes Browne, one Ratherine Gardiner, and one Ioane Lucas, all birds of a winge, and all abyding in the Towne of Gilsborough did ride one night to a place (not aboue a mile off) called Rauenstrop, all vpon a Sowes backe, to sée one mother Rhoades, an old Witch that dwelt there, but before they came to her house the old Witch died, and in her last cast cried out, that there were three of her old friends coming to sée her, but they came too late, Howbeit shee would méete with them in another place within a month after. And thus much concerning Agnes Browne, and her daughter&quot;. Vaughn and Brown were executed on 22 July 1612.

==Geography==
The civil parish of Ravensthorpe includes nearby Coton. Nearby tourist attractions include Coton Manor Garden, Althorp House, and Holdenby House.

==In popular culture==
A village of the same name is present in the 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot; which features prominently as the protagonist&#x27;s home, although the fictionalised Ravensthorpe is in a different location of Ledecestrescire, meaning Leicestershire. According to the game&#x27;s narrative director, Darby McDevitt, the fictional version was created without knowledge of the real location and the development team only found out about the similarity a few months before the game&#x27;s launch. Lord of the Manor Charlie Reeve declared a week-long commemorative event for the release of an in-game Yuletide festival, coinciding with local pub &quot;The Chequers&quot; releasing a special takeaway menu. By comparing in-game maps with actual geography, the real-life village is in the immediate proximity of the fictional one.

==Notable people==
*John Mason (1600 – 1672), Deputy Governor of the Connecticut Colony, led the 1637 Mystic massacre during the Pequot War.

<doc id="1195691" wikidata="Q27709" url="?curid=1195691" title="Adamorobe Sign Language">
<text>Adamorobe Sign Language or AdaSL is a village sign language used in Adamorobe, an Akan village in eastern Ghana. It is used by about 30 deaf and 1370 hearing people (2003). 

The Adamorobe community is notable for its unusually high incidence of hereditary deafness (genetic recessive autosome). As of 2012, about 1.1% of the total population is deaf, but the percentage was as high as 11% in 1961 before the local chief instituted a policy prohibiting deaf people to marry other deaf. Deaf people are fully incorporated into the community.

Under these circumstances, AdaSL has developed as an indigenous sign language, fully independent from the country&#x27;s standard Ghanaian Sign Language (which is related to American Sign Language). AdaSL is a shared sign language which differs from urban sign languages such as Ghanaian Sign Language because the majority of speakers of a shared sign language aren&#x27;t actually deaf. National sign languages usually emerge for the purpose of use by deaf individuals such as those attending schools specifically for the deaf. This important feature of shared sign languages alters the way it is maintained, developed, and shared. A historical example of a shared signing community is the island Martha&#x27;s Vineyard (Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language).

AdaSL shares signs and prosodic features with some other sign languages in the region, such as Bura Sign Language, but it has been suggested these similarities are due to culturally shared gestures rather than a genetic relationship. AdaSL has features that set it apart from the sign languages of large deaf communities studied so far, including the absence of the type of classifier construction that expresses motion or location (sometimes called &quot;entity classifiers&quot;). Instead, AdaSL uses several types of serial verb constructions also found in the surrounding spoken language, Akan. Frishberg suggests that AdaSL may be related to the &quot;gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa&quot;. Thus AdaSL provides an interesting domain for research on cross-linguistic sign languages.

For over a decade, the deaf children of the village have attended a boarding school in Mampong-Akuapem, where the ASL based Ghanaian Sign Language is used. As a consequence, this language has become the first language of these children and their command of AdaSL is decreasing. This is likely to lead to a complete shift of the deaf community in Adamorobe to Ghanaian Sign Language. As such, AdaSL is an endangered sign language.

<text>Pitsford is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in the United Kingdom. According to 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 636 people, increasing to 671 at the 2011 census.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Peoht&#x27;s ford&#x27;.

Pitsford Water, which is used for fishing and sailing as well as storing water for the local area, is north-west of the village, but only part of it lies within the parish. Pitsford Airstrip is at Moulton Grange Farm.

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains details of a total of 15 entries for listed buildings in the parish of Pitsford, all of which are Grade II except for All Saints&#x27; Church which is Grade II*. These include:

*All Saints&#x27; Church, Church Lane. The church has a Norman doorway. The other parts are later. the Church was restored and the chancel rebuilt in 1867. 
*Griffin Inn, High Street, old coaching inn where during the battle of Naseby King Charles 1st stayed and was informed of the defeat before retreating to London.
*Pitsford Hall, Moulton Road, which is now used by Pitsford School. The Hall was originally built before 1785 to the design of John Johnson who also designed Kingsthorpe Hall and the County (or City) Rooms in Leicester. Pitsford Hall has been altered since 1945.
*Sedgebrook Hall which was built in 1861 and is now a venue for special events.

== Quarrying ==
Ironstone is quarried at Pitsford and was formerly transported by rail; the railway line is now part of the preserved Northampton &amp; Lamport Railway which has its headquarters at Pitsford and Brampton railway station. From 1925 to 1965 the quarrying was to obtain iron ore. It began to the south of the road from the A508 to Pitsford and Brampton Station and worked its way eastward to the A508. From 1959 the quarry was on the east side of the A508. The stone was transported to the main railway by a standard gauge branch operated by steam locomotives. From 1925 to 1939 gannister was also obtained and this was taken from the western part of the quarry to the standard gauge branch by a short 2 foot gauge tramway with its own steam locomotive. Quarrying for the iron industry ceased in 1965 The quarry to the west of the main road was smoothed over as was the route of the branch railway by Spring 1967 but the quarry to the east of the A508 was later reopened for the obtaining of stone for road building, the stone being taken away by lorry. Steam quarrying machines were used at first but diesel machines were introduced from 1927 onwards. The steam machines were scrapped in 1958. Electric machines were also used from 1955.

20,000 trees have been planted on the later quarried area since 2002.

==Notable inhabitants==
*Judy Carne, TV actress, lived here from the late 1980s until her death in 2015.
*Stanisław Kościałkowski, Polish historian, lived here from 1950 until his death in 1960.
*Bishop Robert Skinner (Bishop of Bristol, Oxford and Worcester) was born in the village on 10 February 1591

<text>Marguerite Monnot (28 May 1903 – 12 October 1961), was a French songwriter and composer best known for having written many of the songs performed by Édith Piaf (&quot;Milord&quot;, &quot;Hymne à l&#x27;amour&quot;) and the music for the stage musical &quot;Irma La Douce&quot;.

==Career==

She was classically trained by her father and at the Paris Conservatory (her teachers included Nadia Boulanger, Vincent d’Indy, and Alfred Cortot). Monnot made the unusual switch to composing popular music after poor health ended her career as a concert pianist at the age of eighteen. Soon after, she wrote her first commercially successful song, &quot;L&#x27;Étranger&quot;. In 1935, she met Édith Piaf, and in 1940, they became a female songwriting team, remaining friends and collaborators throughout most of their lives.

Monnot worked with lyricists such as Raymond Asso, Henri Contet, Georges Moustaki, and collaborated with musicians and writers including Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, Boris Vian, and Marlene Dietrich, who gathered in Piaf&#x27;s living room regularly to play and sing. In 1955, she achieved major success with her setting of Alexandre Breffort&#x27;s book, &quot;Irma la Douce&quot;, which was translated into English and had long runs in London and on Broadway under the direction of Peter Brook.

==Early years==

Marguerite Monnot was born in Decize, Nièvre, a small city on the river Loire. Her father, Gabriel Monnot, who had lost his sight at the age of three, was a musician and composer of religious music. He was the organist at the Saint-Aré church in Decize and gave piano and harmonium lessons. Monnot&#x27;s mother, Marie, also gave music lessons and was a teacher of French literature and a writer. Every evening, pupils and friends gathered in their home to play and sing, and the Monnots sometimes invited well-known musicians to join them. She rarely attended school; her mother taught her at home and she practiced piano several hours a day.

At the age of three, she composed her first little song, &quot;Bluette&quot;. At three and a half, she accompanied a singer at a Paris performance of a Mozart berceuse, receiving a toy stuffed cat as compensation. In 1911, at the Salle des Agriculteurs in Paris, she played Liszt, Chopin, and Mozart, and received her first press reviews. From twelve to fifteen years of age, she performed in several different cities, including Paris, where Camille Saint-Saëns is said to have remarked of her, &quot;I have just heard the best pianist in the world.&quot; At age fifteen, she was sent to study in Paris. She had lessons from Vincent d’Indy in harmony and fugue, studied piano with Alfred Cortot, and learned harmony from Nadia Boulanger. The latter helped her to prepare for the Prix de Rome, although it is unclear whether she actually entered the competition formally. She toured the capitals of Europe when she was sixteen, and accompanied the dancer Vincente Escuderro in Madrid. There, she became interested in Spanish folklore. She was offered the opportunity to become an official musician at the Spanish royal court, but her parents sent her back to Paris instead for further study.

Her concert career was interrupted in 1921, on the eve of a United States tour, by a bout of ill health and what the French call &quot;le trac&quot;, or an attack of nerves. She became noticeably shy when she had to show Piaf a new song, even after years of collaboration.

Her second vocation, songwriting, was just a pastime at first. A fan of popular music on the radio in the early 1920s, including jazz and dance music, she began writing songs because a family friend encouraged her to write a waltz for a film based on a play by Tristan Bernard. This song, written with Bernard in 1931, was entitled &quot;Ah! les mots d’amour!&quot; and sung by Jane Marny. Lyricist Marc Hély then asked her to compose the music for &quot;Viens dans mes bras&quot;, sung by Lucienne Boyer and published by Salabert. She was encouraged to continue. She persevered, and in 1935, the song &quot;L’Étranger&quot; was born out of her collaboration with the journalist-lyricist Robert Malleron and the accordionist-composer Robert Juel, who co-authored the music. The song was awarded the Grand Prix de l&#x27;Académie Charles Cros that year.

==Piaf years==
&quot;L&#x27;Étranger&quot; played a key role in Monnot&#x27;s first encounter with Édith Piaf in 1936. Annette Lajon had sung the song originally, and Piaf wanted to acquire the rights to perform it. The publisher, Maurice Decruck, denied her request, however, because a singer had exclusive rights to a song for a six-month period, Piaf learned it and sang it at Le Gerny&#x27;s, the nightclub where she was performing at the time. When Annette Lajon appeared in the audience at Le Gerny&#x27;s one night, Piaf is said to have apologized to her for &quot;stealing&quot; her song. Lajon apparently accepted the apology and introduced Piaf to its composer, Marguerite Monnot, who had accompanied her to the nightclub.

The same year, Monnot met the lyricist Raymond Asso. He was a former Foreign Legionnaire, and he cut a romantic and exotic figure with his cape and boots. The first of Asso&#x27;s songs for which Monnot wrote the music was &quot;Mon légionnaire&quot;. Some years later, during a trip to Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, Monnot and Asso were awarded decorations by the Foreign Legion.

Monnot and Piaf became close friends and began collaborating on songs in the early 1940s. Their songs were performed by Piaf, and many famous female singers at the time, including Damia, Mona Goya, and Line Viala. These include the songs from the film Montmartre-sur-Seine (&quot;Tu es partout&quot;, &quot;Un coin tout bleu&quot;, &quot;Y’en a un de trop&quot;, &quot;Où sont-ils mes petits copains?&quot;), &quot;Mon amour vient de finir&quot; (Damia), and &quot;C’était un jour de fête.&quot; Monnot devoted the next twenty-five years writing songs for Piaf.

In her biography, Piaf calls Monnot her best friend and the woman she most admired in the whole world. She also refers to her pride in having collaborated with Monnot. Piaf paid tribute to Monnot for encouraging her interest in classical music and in learning to play the piano. During the war years, from 1939 to 1945, Monnot collaborated with Henri Contet, writing such songs as &quot;Y’a pas de printemps&quot;, &quot;Histoire de coeur&quot;, &quot;Le ciel est fermé&quot;, and &quot;Le brun et le blond&quot;. They also worked together on the songs for the film Etoile sans lumière, for Piaf, and &quot;Ma môme, ma p’tite môme [or gosse]&quot; for Yves Montand.

In those years, Piaf rehearsed a few songs by Monnot that were never recorded, including &quot;Le chant du monde&quot; (lyric by Asso), &quot;Mon amour vient de finir&quot;, &quot;Les rues du monde&quot; and &quot;Le diable est près de moi&quot; (lyrics by Piaf), and &quot;L’hôtel d’en face&quot; (lyric by Gine Money). This was also the period when Piaf recorded a number of songs which were never released, such as &quot;Je ne veux plus faire la vaisselle&quot; (&quot;I Don’t Want To Wash Dishes Anymore&quot;).

During Piaf&#x27;s tour of the stalags in Germany during the war, one of the famous Monnot-Asso songs, &quot;Le fanion de la Légion&quot;, was banned because it had supposedly created a patriotic fervor in Parisian audiences. Meanwhile, Monnot remained in Paris, making occasional trips home to Decize to see her mother (her father had died in 1939) and bring provisions from the countryside back to Paris.

On 11 July 1950, Monnot married the singer Étienne Giannesini, whose stage name was Paul Péri. The couple had no children. They reportedly made many trips to Decize to visit Monnot&#x27;s mother, and Monnot wrote songs for Péri, including the music for a detective film, &quot;Les Pépées font la loi&quot;, in which Péri starred in 1954.

In the 1950s, Monnot also collaborated with a few new lyricists, including Michel Emer, Luiguy, Norbert Glanzberg, Philippe-Gérard, Florence Véran, and Hubert Giraud, and with the orchestra of Robert Chauvigny. She continued to write for Piaf with another songwriter, René Rouzaud, who had already composed for Damia, Georges Guétary, and Lys Gauty. They wrote the popular &quot;La goualante du pauvre Jean&quot; (&quot;Poor John&#x27;s Song/Complaint&quot;) – translated as &quot;The Poor People of Paris&quot; due to confusion between &quot;pauvre Jean&quot; and &quot;pauvre gens&quot; – which became the first French song to hit number one on the American and British record charts.

==&quot;Irma La Douce&quot; and beyond==
&quot;Irma La Douce&quot; was opened on 12 November 1956, at the Théâtre Gramont in Paris, where it ran for four years. The book and lyrics were by Alexandre Breffort; it was directed by René Dupuy and starred Colette Renard and Miche Roux. A year and a half into the Paris run, the show opened in London. It was directed by Peter Brook and starred Elizabeth Seal and Keith Michell. Eventually, the English-language &quot;Irma&quot; went on to become more popular than the original French one. The musical opened on 17 July 1958, at the Lyric Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, where it ran for 1,512 performances. The show opened in New York on Broadway at the Plymouth Theater on 29 September 1960, and ran for 524 performances.

It played simultaneously in France, the UK, the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Brazil and Argentina. It was recorded under the Sony label and starred Elizabeth Seal and Keith Michell, who had both been part of the London cast. 

In 1963, Billy Wilder directed the movie version, starring Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon. The film&#x27;s opening credits say, &quot;Based on the Play by Alexandre Breffort and the Music by Marguerite Monnot.&quot; Andre Previn won the Academy Award for Scoring of Music — Adaptation or Treatment, and thanked Wilder, writer I. A. L. Diamond, the orchestra, and the Academy, failing to acknowledge Monnot. 

Shortly after the success of &quot;Irma&quot;, Disney Studios reportedly asked Monnot to come to Hollywood and compose for American films, but she refused to leave her settled life in France. From then, she collaborated regularly with Marcel Blistène, including writing some songs for the film &quot;Les amants de demain&quot; in 1959. (She had already worked with him on the film &quot;Etoile sans lumière&quot; in 1946.) She composed other songs for Péri, a singer of &quot;realistic&quot; songs, such as &quot;Encore un verre&quot; and &quot;Ma rue et moi&quot;. She also composed the music for &quot;Méphisto&quot; and &quot;Le sentier de la guerre&quot;, written by Claude Nougaro.

Her songs were also sung by singers such as, Damia, Josephine Baker, Suzy Solidor, and Yves Montand.

These songs were a synthesis between the first years of the Monnot–Piaf collaboration and the post-war song, between the time of the legionnaires and the end of the dream of colonialism. In 1957, Monnot met the lyricist Michel Rivgauche, with whom she was to write &quot;Salle d’attente&quot;, &quot;Fais comme si&quot;, &quot;Tant qu’il y aura des jours&quot; and &quot;Les blouses blanches&quot;, at Piaf&#x27;s apartment .
In 1959, Edith Piaf recorded Milord, which became an international hit.

As many of Piaf&#x27;s biographers wrote, the friendship between the singer and Monnot &#x27;suffered a serious setback&#x27; after Piaf met the composer Charles Dumont in the late 1950s. Dumont composed Piaf&#x27;s significant signature tunes, &quot;Je ne regrette rien&quot;, whereupon Piaf took 11 of Monnot&#x27;s songs out of her repertoire for her upcoming performance at the Olympia to make room for more Dumont songs.

Monnot became ill with symptoms of appendicitis during her last year of life, 1961. She seems to have had a premonition that her illness was life-threatening, yet she failed to follow medical advice and have the operation. She wrote to her friend, Madame Niaudet:

On 12 October 1961, at the age of 58, Marguerite Monnot died in a Paris hospital from a ruptured appendix and the resulting peritonitis. She was buried with her father and mother in the cemetery of her hometown. Piaf – who used to call her &quot;&quot; – as well as Monnot&#x27;s many friends and colleagues paid tribute to her. In 1963, the city of Decize renamed the street where she had lived (rue des Écoles) &quot;rue Marguerite Monnot&quot;. It also unveiled a commemorative plaque on the façade of Decize. In 1989, the nursery school in the center of town was also named after her. In 1991, on the thirtieth anniversary of her death, a mass, concert, and exhibition were held in Decize in her memory. Her true memorial is to be found in her .

<text>Morris Isaac &quot;Moose&quot; Charlap (; December 19, 1928 – July 8, 1974) was an American Broadway composer best known for &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1954), for which Carolyn Leigh wrote the lyrics. The idea for the show came from Jerome Robbins, who planned to have a few songs by Charlap and Leigh. It evolved into a full musical, with additional songs by Jule Styne and Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The original run of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; on Broadway starred Mary Martin as Peter Pan and Cyril Ritchard as Captain Hook.

==Career==
Charlap was also the composer for the 1969 television movie musical &quot;Hans Brinker,&quot; which had lyrics by Alvin Cooperman and starred Eleanor Parker (her singing voice was her own), Richard Basehart, John Gregson, Robin Askwith, Roberta Tovey, Sheila Whitmill, and Cyril Ritchard. It was based on the novel by Mary Mapes Dodge. Charlap also wrote the song &quot;First Impression&quot; with lyrics by Carolyn Leigh. The song was dropped from the original 1954 production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; but was recorded by Eydie Gorme in 1956. Other songs Charlap wrote that were not included in musicals include &quot;English Muffins and Irish Stew,&quot; &quot;Mademoiselle,&quot; &quot;Great Day in the Morning,&quot; &quot;My Favorite Song,&quot; and &quot;Young Ideas.&quot; Ella Fitzgerald recorded his &quot;My Favorite Song&quot; for Decca Records with an orchestra directed by Leroy Kirkland. Charlap was also a recording artist and had a single, &quot;Good Old Fashioned Lovin&#x27;/It Was My Father&#x27;s Habit,&quot; released on ABC in 1956.

==Family==
Born Morris Isaac Charlip to a Jewish family in Philadelphia, he married singer Sandy Stewart, whose biggest hit was &quot;My Coloring Book&quot; in 1962. Jazz pianist Bill Charlap is their son. They also had a daughter, Katherine. He and his first wife, Elizabeth, were the parents of a daughter, Anne, and son, Tom, a bass player.

Charlap, who lived with his wife and children on Manhattan&#x27;s East Side, died at Lenox Hill Hospital in 1974 at the age of 45.

<text>Overstone is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 650 people, increasing to 741 at the 2011 Census.

The villages name means &#x27;Ufic&#x27;s/Ofe&#x27;s farm/settlement&#x27;.

== The Church of St Nicholas Overstone ==

This church is now a chapel of ease in the parish of Sywell with Overstone.

Overstone, about four miles from Northampton and just off the A43 road to Kettering is a long linear village with the church of St Nicholas, built in 1807 and remodelled in 1903, standing in a field in Overstone Park a short walk from the village. The church constructed of Kingsthorpe Stone (grey sandstone with streaks of silty clay) was built by John Kipling and replaced the old dilapidated earlier one built at the beginning of the 13th century and situated further into the park in the deserted village of Overstone. During the medieval period of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries Overstone village was a little further into the park beyond the current church. It was a village of ‘modest size’ and continued throughout the following centuries to be a small village owned by the resident Lord of the Manor. In 1672 the manor is described as having 14 farms and 15 cottages. It is likely that Henry Stratford, Lord of the Manor of Overstone moved the village into its current position sometime around the middle of the 18th century – Eyre&#x27;s map of 1775 shows the village having moved with only the church and rectory standing in front of the manor house. There are no traces of this first church which during the fifteenth century had four altars dedicated to the saints, Mary, Anne, Thomas and John the Baptist, whilst the manor house has had a variety of owners and a horrible fire in the late 20th century. The north wall of St Nicholas&#x27; holds the &#x27;Wantage Window&#x27;. Lady Wantage once owned the manor and gave the window in memory of her husband who fought in the Crimean War, winning one of the first VC crosses to be awarded. He is also remembered as being one of the founders of the British Red Cross. There are also several monuments from the old church.

The church has been reordered and the pews were removed it is now used for a lunch club, children&#x27;s and family worship.

<text>Old (previously Wold and before that Wolde) is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 308 people, and the population increased to 490 at the 2011 Census.

Old is near the village of Walgrave, and has a church, village hall, pub and park. It was once home to the haulage company Knights of Old, but they were later based in Kettering. As with many villages, the number of farms has decreased; two shops, a blacksmith, a butcher and a second pub also disappeared.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;High forest&#x27;.

Old is an ancient community, known in 1086 as &quot;Walda&quot; in the ancient domesday hundred of Mawsley.

The village was the beneficiary of a large legacy left to it by the Rev. John Tounson, a previous rector of the parish several hundred years ago, and each year various needy residents of the village receive supplements. In 1971, it was reported that the small plot of land bequeathed by the Rev. Tounson had been sold for £238,000.

Robert Woodford, the noted 17th-century diarist, was born in Old in 1606, a son of Robert Woodford and his wife Jane Dexter. He appears to have grown up in the parish.

== Notable buildings ==
The Historic England website contains details of a total of 19 listed buildings (all Grade II, apart from St Andrew&#x27;s Church which is Grade I) and one scheduled monument at or in the vicinity of Old. Amongst them are:
*St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Church Lane

<text>Norton is a village in West Northamptonshire. The population including Brokhall and Norton at the 2011 census was 434. The village is about east of Daventry, west of Northampton. Junction 16 of the M1 motorway is about south-east and the nearest railway station is at Long Buckby to the east. Near the village, on Watling Street, is the Roman settlement of Bannaventa.

==History==
The villages name means &#x27;North farm/settlement&#x27;.

Some of the earliest residents of the village were the Romans, who built the Roman settlement of Bannaventa, a Romano-British fortified town on the eastern outskirts of the village located on the Roman road of Watling Street (A5 London to Holyhead road). Material representing the remains of the Roman settlement of Bannaventa has been recovered from a strip around wide on either side of a length of Watling Street, in agricultural land north-west of the village, at Whilton Lodge. The settlement&#x27;s defences were in the form of a trapezium, not aligned with Watling Street, and the enclosure was deeper on the east side of the street than it was on the west.

The four sides of the enclosure were , measured clockwise from north, and enclosed an area of about . The defences were built in two – possibly three – phases. First: a large ditch 7.6 metres wide and 3.1 metres deep () backed by a clay and turf rampart was constructed after the end of the first century; second: the primary ditch was filled in with gravel early in the fourth century to provide a firm base for a stone wall with foundations wide and fronted by two newly-cut, parallel ditches; the inner 5.2 metres wide and 2.4 metres deep () and the outer 4.3 metres wide and 1.8 metres deep (); and thirdly: The inner ditch was filled with gravel shortly after the second phase was completed, perhaps intended as the firm base for external towers, though none have been discovered. The outer ditch was allowed to silt up by the end of the fourth century. Occupation of the site, which may have begun before the Roman conquest, continued into the fourth century.

There is a Roman villa site at the nearby village of Nether Heyford to the south east.

==Possible association with Saint Patrick==

It is possible, but unsubstantiated, that Bannaventa was the birthplace of St Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. In his &quot;Confessio&quot;, Patrick writes:

This could possibly be an alternative name for Bannaventa. In around 405 AD when he was aged 16 he was kidnapped by &quot;pirates&quot; who were raiding the imperial highways, and taken to Ireland as a slave. This view is backed by the fact that the Watling Street ran indirectly to north Wales and thus offered easy passage to Ireland.

<text>Abbot Beyne School is a comprehensive school in Burton upon Trent in east Staffordshire, England. It was created after the Burton Grammar School was abolished and initially educated the remaining pupils from Burton Grammar School and Burton Girls&#x27; High School who had been selected at the age of 11 as pupils likely to benefit from a highly academic education. It inhabited the Grammar School site but as a newly created comprehensive school, did not inherit its educational pedagogy. 

==Location==
It is situated in Winshill, on the other side of the River Trent to the town centre, east of the B5008, near the junction of the A511 and A444 at Burton Bridge.

==History==
===Grammar school===
William Beyne, Abbot of Burton Abbey, endowed a grammar school in the early 16th century, functioning sometime around 1531. The boys&#x27; Grammar School moved to Winshill in 1957. It was administered by the county borough of Burton upon Trent, and known as The Grammar School with about 600 boys. The girls&#x27; high school opened in 1928. From April 1974 it was administered by Staffordshire County Council.

Another similar nearby school was the Dovecliff Grammar School, formerly Burton Technical School, on St Mary&#x27;s Drive in Horninglow, which became Wulfric Comprehensive School in 1975, then De Ferrers High School in 1985.

===Comprehensive===
In 1975 the Burton Grammar school was merged with the Burton on Trent Girls&#x27; High School and Ada Chadwick Secondary Modern School to become Abbot Beyne mixed Comprehensive School on Mill Hill Lane but it was a newly created school. Other than using the name of the founder of the Grammar School, Abbot Beyne and using the site in Winshill, it did not inherit any of the previous school&#x27;s traditions or educational practices. Pupils were no longer selected on ability.
==Academic performance==
The school achieves GCSE and A-level results around the England average, with the A-level results being slightly better than the GCSE results.

==Sport==
Abbot Beyne has an array of sporting facilities, including; two gymnasiums, rugby pitches, two athletic tracks, two football pitches and numerous tennis courts.

<doc id="1195757" wikidata="Q144521" url="?curid=1195757" title="Titicut Follies">
<text>Titicut Follies is a 1967 American direct cinema documentary film produced, written, and directed by Frederick Wiseman and filmed by John Marshall. It deals with the patient-inmates of Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, a Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. The title is taken from that of a talent show put on by the hospital staff. &quot;Titicut&quot; is the Wampanoag name for the nearby Taunton River.

The film won accolades in Germany and Italy. Wiseman went on to produce many more such films examining social institutions (e.g. hospitals, police, schools, etc.) in the United States.

In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Titicut Follies&quot; portrays the occupants of Bridgewater State Hospital, who are often kept in barren cells and infrequently bathed. It also depicts inmates/patients required to strip naked publicly, force feeding, and the indifference and bullying by many of the hospital&#x27;s staff.

The film employs methods of direct cinema, which emphasizes observation, limited stylization, and non-intervention by filmmakers.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Titicut Follies&quot; was the beginning of the documentary career of Frederick Wiseman, a Boston-born lawyer turned filmmaker. He had taken his law classes from Boston University to the institution for educational purposes and had &quot;wanted to do a film there&quot;. He began calling the facility superintendent, seeking permission to film a year prior to production. Wiseman had previously produced &quot;The Cool World&quot; (1964), based on Warren Miller’s novel of the same name, an experience that informed his desire to direct.

===Filming===
Wiseman drafted a proposal that was verbally agreed to by the superintendent, which later came into question when the film began distribution. Following that agreement, filming began, with corrections staff following Wiseman at all times and determining on the spot whether the subjects filmed were mentally competent, adding further confusion to an already fraught process. While on location, Wiseman recorded the sound and directed the established ethnographic filmmaker John Marshall⁠via microphone or by hand.

===Post-production===
Twenty-nine days were spent documenting the conditions at Bridgewater and 80,000 feet of film were shot. Wiseman spent approximately a year editing the footage into the final 84-minute narrative. Wiseman edited the film in secret, working after hours in the editing rooms at WGBH-TV.

==Release==
===Censorship===
Just before the film was to be shown at the 1967 New York Film Festival, the Massachusetts government tried to procure an injunction banning its release, claiming that the film violated the patients&#x27; privacy and dignity. Despite Wiseman having received permission from all the people portrayed or that of the hospital superintendent (the inmates&#x27; legal guardian), Massachusetts claimed that this permission could not take the place of release forms from the inmates. Wiseman was also accused of breaching an &quot;oral contract&quot;, giving the state government editorial control over the film. A New York state court allowed the screening, but in 1968, Massachusetts Superior Court judge Harry Kalus ordered the film to be recalled from distribution and all copies destroyed, once more citing the state&#x27;s concerns about violations of the patients&#x27; privacy and dignity.

Wiseman appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which in 1969 allowed it to be shown only to doctors, lawyers, judges, health-care professionals, social workers, and students in these and related fields. Wiseman appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case.

Wiseman believes that the government of Massachusetts (concerned that the film portrayed a state institution in a bad light) intervened to protect its reputation. The state intervened after a social worker in Minnesota wrote to Massachusetts governor John Volpe, expressing shock at a scene involving a naked man being taunted by a guard.

The dispute was the first known instance of a film being banned from general American distribution for reasons other than obscenity, immorality, or national security. It was also the first time that Massachusetts recognized a right to privacy at the state level. Wiseman has said, &quot;The obvious point that I was making was that the restriction of the court was a greater infringement of civil liberties than the film was an infringement on the liberties of the inmates.&quot;

Little changed until 1987, when the families of seven inmates who had died at the hospital sued the hospital and state. Steven Schwartz represented one of the inmates, who was &quot;restrained for 2½ months and given six psychiatric drugs at vastly unsafe levels—choked to death because he could not swallow his food.&quot; Schwartz has said &quot;There is a direct connection between the decision not to show that film publicly and my client dying 20 years later, and a whole host of other people dying in between,&quot; &quot;... in the years since Mr. Wiseman made &quot;Titicut Follies&quot;, most of the nation&#x27;s big mental institutions have been closed or cut back by court orders&quot; and &quot;the film may have also influenced the closing of the institution featured in the film.&quot;

In 1991, Superior Court judge Andrew Meyer allowed the film&#x27;s release to the general public, saying that as time had passed, privacy concerns had become less important than First Amendment concerns. He also said that many of the former patients had died, so there was little risk of a violation of their dignity. The state Supreme Court ordered that &quot;A brief explanation shall be included in the film that changes and improvements have taken place at Massachusetts Correctional Institution Bridgewater since 1966.&quot; The film was shown on PBS on September 4, 1992, its first American television airing. Before, a narrative warning and an introduction by Charlie Rose were played. Following the broadcast, a message was shown stating that improvements had been made since the time of production.

The film is now legally available through its distributor, Zipporah Films Inc., for purchase or rental on DVD and for educational and individual license. Zipporah released the DVD to the home market in December 2007.

In 2020, the film was shown on Turner Classic Movies.

In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Khalid bin Sultan Al Saud (; born 24 September 1949) is the former deputy minister of defense, a member of the House of Saud, and a grandson of King Abdulaziz.

==Early life and education==
Prince Khalid was born on 24 September 1949. He is the oldest son of Prince Sultan and full brother of Fahd bin Sultan, Faisal bin Sultan and Turki bin Sultan. Their mother is Munira bint Abdulaziz bin Musaed bin Jiluwi who died in Paris on 24 August 2011. Moneera bint Abdulaziz was a sister of Alanoud, spouse of King Fahd. She was also cousin of King Khalid and Prince Muhammed.

Khalid bin Sultan is a graduate of King Saud University. He attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst from January 1967, where he was a corporal in the cadet government, and graduated in 1968. He also studied at the US Army&#x27;s Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. He graduated from the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. He also holds a master&#x27;s degree in political science which he received from Auburn University at Montgomery in 1980.

==Career==
In the first years as a soldier, despite his choice to be selected for special forces personnel, Khalid bin Sultan was given a command of an artillery platoon in Tabuk province. Later, his position advanced as he was given a task for conducting contract and purchasing of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s first guided missile with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. For this prominent role, he was given an honorary title &quot;Father of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Missile&quot;.

After years in the army, thinking that air defense should be given more important role in the national defense, he established the Saudi air defense force, and became its first commander. Shortly after occupation of Iraq to Kuwait in the first Persian Gulf War, he was chosen as the commander of the joint Arab forces, and shared an equal position and responsibility with general Norman Schwarzkopf of US Army. King Fahd promoted Prince Khalid to field marshal afterward. In 1991, he retired from the military to focus on business. In January 2001, he was brought back into the military as assistant defense minister for military affairs.

In early 2011, Prince Khalid announced that “more than 70 percent of military equipment can be produced locally&quot; and the future creation of a government branch for domestic military growth. He was regarded as a likely candidate to replace his father as defense minister in 2011. However, he was appointed deputy defense minister in November 2011. His term lasted until 20 April 2013 when he was replaced by Fahd bin Abdullah, another member of the royal family. Traditionally, the decision follows exemption &quot;based on his request,&quot; but the royal order issued exempting Khalid bin Sultan from office, did not include this phrase.

==2009 Yemen bombing==
In November 2009, Khalid bin Sultan led a Saudi military intervention in Yemen. The campaign had various tactical mistakes, and Khalid was heavily criticized. The Saudis had 130 casualties and Yemen lost over 1000.

In December 2009, Khalid gave a 48-hour ultimatum for Houthi withdrawal from Al Jabri. Soon, he declared that the campaign had ended after the Houthi promised through &quot;Al-Quds Al-Arabi&quot; they would withdraw from the border in exchange for a ceasefire. The Houthi also stated that the Yemen government had used Saudi territory to bomb targets.

In February 2010, Ambassador Smith met with Khalid. Smith brought attention to Saudi airstrikes on Yemeni hospitals. Khalid admitted that the event occurred because Yemen had designated the area as a Houthi military base. He also stated that this event occurred because of inaccurate military equipment and the U.S. refusal to provide Predators. He went on to state that Saudi strategy was to force the Houthis to reconcile with the Yemeni government by a strong show of military force. He complained that it was difficult to avoid civilian casualties. The Saudi-Yemeni joint committee granted clearances to Khalid bin Sultan for attacks to be conducted. He also stated that Yemeni intelligence was unreliable and politically motivated. Yemen data claimed terrorist positions in a place when in actuality the place was the office of General Ali Mohsen Al Ahmar, a political adversary to President Saleh.

===Controversy===
King Abdullah was not pleased by Khalid&#x27;s leadership when Saudi troops could not quickly push back Houthis who had seized Saudi territory in late 2009. King Abdullah specifically expressed his concerns over the long duration of the conflict, large number of casualties, and Saudi incompetence. Therefore, this situation led to decrease in his potential succession of his father as defense minister. Joseph A. Kéchichian, a Middle East analyst, argued after Khalid&#x27;s removal from office on 20 April 2013 that there are three potential reasons for his dismissal, one of which is about his activity in 2009 mentioned above. The others were related to his involvement in procurement of arms in 2010 and 2013.

====Wealth and Paradise Papers====

Leaked US cables dated November 1996 cited the wealth of Prince Khalid as $2 billion.

In November 2017 an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism cited his name in the list of politicians named in Paradise Papers allegations.

==Other positions==
At the end of the 1990s, Prince Khalid had business contacts with French electronics group Thomson-CSF.

Khalid is the chairman for the committee of the Prince Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz International Prize for Water. He is chair of board of trustees of Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud Foundation. He is also a member of the board of trustees of the Arab Thought Foundation that is a Saudi think-tank group, attempting to improve the relations between Arab nations and the Western nations.

He owned the newspaper &quot;Al-Hayat&quot;. It is said that he did not interfere in its articles as long as no royal criticism is published.

==Views==
===Turkish-Arab relations===
In the late 1990s, Khalid expressed an opinion concerning the Turkish-Arab relations. According to him, Arabs should ask themselves what brought about this crisis. After criticizing Arab politics for an inability to &quot;cope with rapid changes on the ground,&quot; he states how they &quot;assumed Turkey would be on their side forever, even if it gained no benefit thereby.&quot; The Arab side, on the other hand, &quot;did not comprehend the complexities of the internal situation in Turkey, or that country&#x27;s regional and international considerations. This created a climate that could push Turkey ever further into the camp of unfriendly countries.&quot; Finally, he proposed improving Turkish-Arab ties &quot;[s]olely by granting supreme importance to mutual economic interests. It is vital to find a form of economic integration between the Arabs and Turks, even if it is a gradual process.&quot; And he proposes Turkish-Arab cultural collaboration, calling on Arabs and Turks to &quot;start purging history books and textbooks of mutual insults.&quot; He also encouraged military cooperation between Turkey, Pakistan, and Arab states of the Persian Gulf.

===Ethiopia===
In February 2013, Khalid made a statement about Ethiopia&#x27;s right to use the Nile waters, which was officially denounced by the Saudi government. His remarks were as follows: &quot;The Ethiopian Renaissance dam is for political plotting rather than for economic gain and constitutes a threat to Egyptian and Sudanese national security.&quot;

==Personal life==
Khalid&#x27;s first marriage was to his first cousin, Lulua, King Fahd&#x27;s daughter. They divorced in 1978. They have three children. Their first child, Reema, died four months old. His other children from his first marriage are Faisal (born 1973) and Sara (born 1976). Later, he married the daughter of Turki bin Abdulaziz, another full uncle, Abeer bint Turki bin Abdulaziz. They have five children: Hala, Fahd (born 1985), Abdullah (born 1988), Salman (born 1993) and Mishail.

One of his daughters, Princess Hala, is the former wife of Turki bin Abdullah, who was then a pilot in the Royal Saudi Air Force, and they married on 13 January 2010.

His son, Faisal bin Khalid, is the governor of the Northern Borders Region. Another son, Abdullah bin Khalid, was the permanent representative of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations in Vienna. He was assigned to the post in September 2019, and his tenure lasted until January 2020 when he was made nonresident ambassador of Saudi Arabia to Slovakia and Slovenia.

<doc id="1195759" wikidata="Q2232061" url="?curid=1195759" title="Newnham, Northamptonshire">
<text>Newnham is a village in West Northamptonshire in England. The village is south of Daventry, west from Weedon Bec, west of junction 16 of the M1 motorway and west of Northampton. The A45 road runs a mile northwest of the village. The nearest railway station is at Long Buckby, northeast.

The villages name means &#x27;At the new homestead/village&#x27; or &#x27;at the new hemmed-in land&#x27;.

To find out more about the village you can visit www.newnhamvillage.co.uk

The village nestles below a large hill in the valley of the River Nene. The village name is thought to derive from the nearby River Nene. The hill, called Newnham Hill, is topped by an ancient disused windmill, and has commanding views over the nearby town of Daventry. Also on the hill is a large aerial which is part of the air traffic control system of the British Isles.

==The parish church==

The parish church, called St Michael and all Angels, is a former chapel of a parent church at Badby. The benefice has always been Badby-cum-Newnham, with the vicarage of Badby. As the church is perched high on a bank, the churchyard descends steeply east and south. The chancel, the north aisle and the present nave were built in the early 14th century, on the site of a 12th-century chapel. The western tower was built in the late 14th or early 15th century abutting the west wall and standing on three open arches. The tower has contained six bells since 1660. They were rehung on a new iron frame by John Taylor &amp; Co in 1940.

==Other village amenities==
On the green is the Romer Arms, a public house which was originally called the Bakers Arms. It was bought by a man named Romer Williams, who was a hunting man and a lawyer by profession. He renamed it the Romer Arms and it is his family coat of arms that is depicted on the sign. Translated, the Latin inscription on the coat of arms is, &#x27;To do and to suffer is the better way for the Roman&#x27;. This is also &quot;Maria&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; a Portuguese restaurant.

The village had another public house called the New Inn which is now a private residence. This former pub, cafe and hand-pumped petrol station, was on School Hill. A former proprietor, a Mr Howard, displayed a notice that read
:You can have tea at teatime
:— you can have beer at beer time
:— you can have petrol at any time.

==Other prominent buildings==
Newnham Hall dates from 1820 and is set in of Northamptonshire Parkland. Newnham Hall was the home of the former Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire, Lieutenant Colonel John Walkelyne Chandos-Pole OBE, who died in 1993.

Another fine residence is The Grove. Located in the grounds of The Grove, which was owned by the Marriott Family, is the Nuttery which is the site of a hazel orchard. The Nuttery was planted by the Marriotts of Newnham House. Hazel nuts are still picked, sorted in the house and then sent to Covent Garden. Daffodils and snowdrops grow underneath the trees and are picked in the spring for market. The orchard is open to the public.

==Prominent residents==
Newnham was the home of Thomas Randolph, a lesser-known 17th century poet. He was born, 15 June 1605, in Newnham at the brown stone gabled house in Poets Way. He was a poet and dramatist as well as a writer of English and Latin verse. He was an author of six plays including &quot;The Jovial Philosopher&quot; (1630); &quot;The Jealous Lovers&quot; (1632); &quot;The Muses&#x27; Looking-Glass&quot; (1638), and &quot;Amyntas&quot; (1638). It was recorded that Randolph was one of Ben Jonson’s cleverest disciples. Pleasant anecdotes are recorded of their relationship and one of Randolph&#x27;s best poems is his, Gratulatory. Thomas Randolph died in 1634 at the age of 29.

===Nigel Lawson===
The former Chancellor of the Exchequer of Margaret Thatcher, Nigel Lawson lived close to the village for some years. On 1 July 1992 he was created a life peer as Baron Lawson of Blaby, of Newnham in the County of Northamptonshire. Lawson is the father of journalist and food writer Nigella Lawson, Dominic Lawson, the former editor of The Sunday Telegraph and Tom Lawson, housemaster of Chernocke House at Winchester College.

==Newnham Windmill==
At the summit of Newnham Hill near the edge of Beggars Bank is the village&#x27;s most complete and prominent reminder of the rural industries. It is believed that a windmill has stood at this location as far back as 1661, when it was first recorded in an inventory of the then miller, John Bignell. The current building dates back to the early 19th century and was three floors high. The building was in a state of disrepair until the 1980s when a group was formed to repair and reconstruct the damaged building. Keys can be obtained to view the windmill by appointment through Daventry Tourist Information Centre.

<text>Joaquín Almunia Amann (born 17 June 1948) is a Spanish politician and formerly, prominent member of the European Commission. During his tenure in the two Barroso Commissions, he was European commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs (2004–2009) and, subsequently, vice-president and the European Commissioner for Competition (2009–2014). Previously, he had been Spanish Minister for Employment (1982–1986) and Public Administrations (1986–1991). From 1997 to 2000, he was the leader of the opposition as secretary general of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, standing in and losing the 2000 Spanish general election against the then incumbent Spanish prime minister, José María Aznar.

==Early life and education==
Born in Bilbao on 17 June 1948 to a bourgeois family, son to an engineer (father) of Valencian origin and a cultivated mother, daughter of a German physician of Jewish ancestry. His grandfather Isaac Amann was one of the promoters of the Bilbao–Getxo railway. Almunia attended the Jesuit School of Indautxu in Bilbao. He graduated with degrees in economics and law in 1971 and 1972, respectively, from the also Jesuit University of Deusto in Bilbao, and completed follow-up studies at the École pratique des hautes études in Paris, from 1970 to 1971. He also completed a program at the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University for senior managers in government in 1991. He was an associate lecturer on employment and social security law at the University of Alcalá de Henares from 1991 to 1994.

==Career==
=== Parliamentary and government posts ===

Almunia was chief economist of the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT), a trade union linked to the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), from 1976 to 1979. He was economist at the Council Bureau of the Spanish Chambers of Commerce in Brussels from 1972 to 1975.

Almunia was a member of the Congress of Deputies from 1979 to 2004, representing Madrid. He served as Minister of Employment and Social Security of the Government of Spain from 1982 to 1986 and as Minister of Public Administration from 1986 to 1991. He was replaced by Juan Manuel Eguiagaray in the latter post. He was also the PSOE spokesperson from 1994 to 1997.

=== Socialist party leader ===
Upon the resignation of Felipe González after being defeated in the 1996 elections, the PSOE Convention (&quot;Congreso federal&quot;) appointed Almunia as the party leader (Secretary-General), a position he held from 1997 to 2000.

In 1998, fellow party member and former minister Josep Borrell decided to run against Almunia, in the first national primary election ever held in the PSOE since the Second Republic, intended to determine who the party would nominate as its prime ministerial candidate vis-à-vis the 2000 general election. Borrell ran as the underdog, campaigning as the candidate of the socialist base against the party establishment, which largely supported Almunia, including former Prime Minister González. Unexpectedly, Borrell won the primary election, commanding 114,254 of the member&#x27;s votes (54.99%), versus the 92,860 (44.67%) obtained by Almunia. Thus began an uneasy relationship and power-sharing —the &quot;bicefalia&quot; (&quot;duumvirate&quot;)— between the official party leader, Almunia, and the prime ministerial candidate elected by the members in the primaries, Borrell. However, in May 1999, a fraud investigation affecting two former officials appointed by Borrell several years earlier while he was at the Ministry of Finance, led to his resignation as Prime Ministerial candidate.

In 2000, Almunia was therefore the PSOE candidate for prime minister. The party was again defeated by incumbent Prime Minister José María Aznar of the conservative PP, suffering its worst result in a general election since the Spanish transition to democracy, which resulted in an absolute majority for Aznar. As a result, Almunia resigned as PSOE leader.

Almunia was the director of the research program on &quot;equality and redistribution of income&quot; at the Fundación Argentaria from 1991 to 1994. In 2002 he founded and served as director of a progressive think tank called Laboratorio de Alternativas (Fundación Alternativas).

=== European Commissioner ===

He first joined the Prodi Commission on 26 April 2004 as a successor to Pedro Solbes (who had resigned to join the new Zapatero government) and was reappointed by Barroso in November 2004.

As EU Commissioner for Competition, Almunia was in charge of state aid and antitrust investigations relating to Google and to the tax planning practices of Apple, Starbucks and Fiat, as well as Amazon. The cases were wrapped up in 2016 by his successor Vestager and eventually closed by the CJEU in 2024, which upheld the Commission&#x27;s decision.

He is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

<doc id="1195777" wikidata="Q461309" url="?curid=1195777" title="Doug Jones (actor)">
<text>Douglas Jones (born May 24, 1960) is an American actor, contortionist, and mime artist. He is best known for portraying non-human creatures, usually via heavy make-up and visual effects. He has most notably collaborated with acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, appearing in the films &quot;Mimic&quot; (1997), &quot;Hellboy&quot; (2004), &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; (2006), &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; (2008), &quot;Crimson Peak&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Shape of Water&quot; (2017). 

Jones has also had roles in other films including &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1993) and its sequel (2022), &quot;Tank Girl&quot; (1995), &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (2005), &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot; (2007), &quot;Absentia&quot; (2011), &quot;&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Bye Bye Man&quot; (2017). He has appeared in the science fiction series &quot;Falling Skies&quot; (2013–15) and del Toro&#x27;s horror series &quot;The Strain&quot; (2014–16). From 2017 to 2024, he portrayed Saru in the science fiction series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. From 2019 to 2024, he portrayed Baron Afanas in vampire comedy show &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot;, appearing both with and without creature makeup.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Indianapolis, the youngest of four brothers, and attended Bishop Chatard High School. He graduated from Ball State University, where he parlayed his background as a mime into portraying the school mascot &quot;Charlie Cardinal.&quot; 

==Career==

Jones started his career in the television and movie industry as a 1980s advertising character, &quot;Mac Tonight&quot;. He worked as a contortionist, saying, &quot;You&#x27;d be surprised how many times that comes into play in commercials. They&#x27;ll want somebody to hold a box of Tide funny or something. I once squished into a box for a commercial for relaxed fit jeans.&quot; In 1994, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; as Gordon Page, Jr., a young man with autism who disappeared from a treatment center in 1991. 

Although known mostly for his work under prosthetic makeup, such as the zombie William &quot;Billy&quot; Butcherson in the Walt Disney Pictures Halloween film &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, or the lead spy Morlock in the 2002 remake of the 1960 film &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, he has also performed without prosthetics in such films as &quot;Adaptation&quot;, &quot;Mystery Men&quot;, and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, and indie projects such as Stefan Haves&#x27; &quot;Stalled&quot;, AntiKaiser Productions&#x27; &quot;Three Lives&quot;, Phil Donlon&#x27;s &quot;A Series of Small Things&quot;, and as Cesare in David Fisher&#x27;s 2005 remake of the 1920 silent classic &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;.

Jones played Abe Sapien in &quot;Hellboy&quot;; the voice was performed by an uncredited David Hyde Pierce in the first film, but Jones&#x27;s voice was used in the sequel. Explaining the challenge of working so often in rubber suits and prosthetics, he notes, &quot;I have to make that a part of my being and my physicality and again, acting is a full-body experience and that&#x27;s a part of it when you&#x27;re doing a costumed character.&quot; 

In 2005, he worked again with Mexican director Guillermo del Toro, starring as the Faun in del Toro&#x27;s multiple-Academy Award-winning Spanish-language fantasy/horror project &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;. He also has a secondary role in the film as the Pale Man, a gruesome creature with a penchant for eating children. Working once more under heavy prosthetics in both roles, he was also required to learn large amounts of dialogue in Spanish, although ultimately his voice was redubbed by Pablo Adan. That same year also brought success for &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;, the film receiving three awards at the Screamfest Horror Festival in Los Angeles, including the Audience Choice Award. 

In 2006, Jones appeared in the feature films &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot; and &quot;Lady in the Water&quot;, and reprised his role as Abe Sapien by voicing the character in the new &quot;Hellboy Animated&quot; television project, recording two 75-minute animated films.

In February 2007, Jones&#x27;s likeness was used for Nvidia&#x27;s &quot;Human Head&quot; tech demo. In June 2007, he appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot; as the Silver Surfer, though Laurence Fishburne provided the character&#x27;s voice. He reprised his role as Abe Sapien in &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;, once more under the direction of del Toro, for which he provided both the voice and body performance. He played two other roles in the film: the Angel of Death and the Chamberlain, both under heavy prosthetics. In 2009, del Toro announced on BBC Radio that Jones would be playing the monster in his upcoming version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. 

In 2007, Jones was disappointed to learn that his voice part of the Silver Surfer had been dubbed by another actor (Fishburne) when the film was released. Upon inquiry, he determined that studio pressure had been imposed in order to add more &quot;names&quot; to the movie. As Jones gained greater clout in the industry, he eventually was able to add a clause to his contracts ensuring that no English dialogue of his characters would be dubbed. Roles that include other languages may be dubbed, however. This came into play in &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; – Jones learned enough Spanish to voice his characters. Still, the decision was made to use a native speaker in order to access the language&#x27;s nuances adequately.

Jones starred as himself in &quot;Sockbaby 4&quot;, the fourth installment of the Internet martial arts comedy series &quot;Sockbaby&quot;.

Jones appeared in the French-language film &quot;Gainsbourg (Vie héroïque)&quot;, written and directed by French comic book author Joann Sfar and produced by Universal Europe. Jones played La Gueule (&quot;The Mug&quot;), the grotesque fantasy muse and malicious doppelganger who teases, guides, and accompanies Serge Gainsbourg throughout his life. He was fitted with prosthetics designed and created by the Academy Award-winning Spanish FX shop DDT Efectos Especiales, with whom he had already worked on &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;; the FX technicians requested specifically that Jones be given the role of the Mug creature, due to his ability to perform (without complaining) with heavy prosthetics and elaborate special effects. As in &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;, Jones performed his lines phonetically, this time speaking in French; his voice was redubbed by Éric Elmosnino, who also played Gainsbourg. Director Joann Sfar liked Jones&#x27;s speech patterns so much that he asked Elmosnino to mimic them when he performed the creature&#x27;s lines. The film was released in France on January 20, 2010.

In January 2010, Jones signed a book deal with Medallion Press to model a nonfiction comedic coffee table book called &quot;Mime Very Own Book&quot;, co-authored by Adam Mock and Scott Allen Perry and photographed by Eric Curtis. The book was due for publication in December 2011.

Jones plays Dr. Henry Vataber in the web series &quot;Universal Dead&quot;. In late June 2010, it was announced that &quot;Universal Dead&quot; would be made into a feature film. He appeared in the independent film &quot;The Candy Shop&quot;, a &quot;modern fairy tale&quot; shedding light upon child sex trafficking, created by the American film studio Whitestone Pictures. 

Jones played the &quot;Operator&quot;, a fictional entity based on the Internet myth known as the &quot;Slender Man&quot;, in &quot;Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story&quot;, a 2015 film adaptation of the popular &quot;Marble Hornets&quot; YouTube series.

Jones was cast as Commander Saru, a non-human Kelpien in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, which premiered September 24, 2017. That same year, Jones reunited with Guillermo del Toro, this time in a romantic lead role, the Amphibian Man (the &quot;asset&quot;) in the Academy Award-winning &quot;The Shape of Water&quot;.

In 2014, Aurelio Voltaire released the song &quot;The Devil and Mr. Jones&quot; on his album &quot;Raised by Bats&quot; which is a tribute to the life and career of Doug Jones.

In 2022, Jones reprised his role as Billy Butcherson in &quot;Hocus Pocus 2&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jones describes himself as a &quot;dyed-in-the-wool Christian from the Midwest&quot;, to the point that he was initially apprehensive about his role in &quot;Hellboy&quot; due to the titular character&#x27;s demonic nature. 

In 1984, Jones married his college sweetheart, Laurie Pontoni. They relocated to Los Angeles in 1985 to further his acting career.

<doc id="1195790" wikidata="Q912997" url="?curid=1195790" title="Duel Masters">
<text>is a multimedia franchise consisting of multiple manga and anime series, a trading card game, and several video games. It began as a manga adaptation of &quot;&quot; before branching off in 2002.

==Plot==
The story centers around the card game &quot;Duel Masters&quot;, which revolves around five civilizations consisting of Fire, Water, Light, Darkness and Nature. The original storyline follows Shobu Kirifuda, a young boy who likes to play &quot;Duel Masters&quot;. He and a few duelists are known to bring the monsters on the cards to life in their duels. Shobu engages in this card game so that he can be the best duelist like his father was.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
:
:He aspires to become a great duelist like his father, Shori Kirifuda. Shobu keeps a positive attitude throughout the series, insisting on dueling for fun as opposed to simply winning. In the first season, Shobu takes on the challenge of defeating the temple champion, Hakuoh, who he feels has become corrupt with power. Throughout this portion of the series, Shobu must defeat Hakuoh&#x27;s underlings while he struggles to understand the true spirit of dueling. All in all Shobu is brave, strong, and has the guts never to give up, just like his favorite creatures.
:He uses a Fire Civilization deck which later becomes a Dragon Deck and even later evolves into a Dragon/Angel Command deck. After being defeated in a later season he loses most of his deck but is guided to his father&#x27;s deck by the spirits of Bolmeteus Samurai Dragon and Bolbalzak &quot;Sword Flash&quot; Dragon. Soon after he combined elements from the 2 decks and created a Samurai Dragon/Angel Command deck (Fire, Light &amp; Nature civilizations).
:As of Duel Masters Cross his main cards are: Bolmeteus &quot;Kensei&quot; Dragon, Bolshack Yamato Dragon, Bolbalzak &quot;Sword Flash&quot; Dragon and Saint Bolshack, Spiritual Dragon. After losing Saint Bolshack, Valkiryas Musashi, Ultimate Battle Dragon and Sword Flash Galaxy, Super Champ became his trump cards as well. Later, his trump card becomes Bolshack NEX. He defeated Zakira with Bolpheaus Heaven in the manga.
:Shobu also appeared in the anime movie &quot;Rockman.EXE: Program Between Light and Darkness.&quot; In the Versus anime season, he appears as an adult.
: (Japanese); Joe Ochman (English)
:Hakuoh is the archrival of Shobu Kirifuda. Hakuoh came from a prominent dueling family, and specialized in Light civilization from a young age. At that time, he was a reflection of Shobu, a young kid who loved the game above all else. This changed, however, when a mysterious duelist appeared and challenged Hakuoh to his first Kaijudo duel. Unaware of the dangers involved in a Kaijudo duel, Hakuoh became overconfident and was nearly killed as a result. Instead of being crushed by his opponent&#x27;s attack, however, Hakuoh was pushed out of the way by his mother, who was fatally wounded. Since then, Hakuoh has become a cold-hearted villain and Shobu&#x27;s main rival. Hakuoh no longer sees any fun in dueling and decides that one&#x27;s value as a human being is determined by their ability to win and will rest at nothing to &quot;be the best&quot;. As a result, Hakuoh becomes a dueling champion and the leader of the White Soldiers. Later in the series, he is challenged by Shobu Kirifuda (who Hakuoh recognizes as a reflection of his former self). As he is consumed with power, Hakuoh not only desires to defeat Shobu, but to crush him entirely and destroy his dreams of dueling. Hakuoh is finally defeated by Shobu and later he befriends him for showing him the true nature of dueling.
:In Duel Masters Charge, Hakuoh is brainwashed into becoming Zakira&#x27;s pawn, &quot;White&quot;. In Duel Masters Zero, he becomes similar to his old self and appears to be working with Professor March (a mad scientist who lures duelists to a deserted island). In Duel Masters Cross, he tries to stop Zakira by challenging him to a duel, but was defeated. Afterwards, his &quot;White&quot; personality overtook him once again. However, after beating Mimi in a duel, he was able to return to his old self after seeing the damage he had caused.
:Hakuoh uses a Light Civilization deck. In Season one, it is a mono-civilization deck focusing on a combination of Urth, Purifying Elemental, Szubs Kin Twighlight Guardian, and Dia Nork, Moonlight Guardian, with his intent on evolving Urth into Alcadeias, Lord of Spirits. This first deck relies heavily on blockers, which leaves him vulnerable to Shobu&#x27;s &quot;Scralet Skyterror.&quot; Later, in Duel Masters Cross, he is given a Light/Darkness Knight deck by Zakira. His main cards are Urth Purifying Elemental, Hanusa Radiance Elemental, Alcadies Lord of Spirits, Alphadios Lord of Spirits, King Alcadeias, Holy Gaia; Perfect Galaxy, Spirit of Immortality; and Nero Gryphis, Mystic Light Emperor.
:A self-proclaimed &quot;evil genius&quot; and another of Shobu&#x27;s main rivals throughout the series. He uses a Darkness Civilization Deck, but later on in the subsequent series, it becomes a Darkness/Water deck. He has earned the nickname &quot;Black Death&quot;, because of his relentless tactics and masterful use of Darkness civilization.
:In later episodes, he helps Shobu to defeat P.L.O.O.P. (once again using a mono-Darkness deck). In &quot;Charge&quot;, he defeated Mimi in the Battle Arena tournament but lost to Yuu. He works on his own to defeat the Fua Duelists, who are responsible for destroying his former home. His ultimate cards are Dorballom, Lord of Demons, Ballom, Master of Death, Ballom Emperor, Lord of Demons, Ballom Monarch, the Dark Reaper King, XENOM, the Reaper King, Dark Strike, Reaper Beast, Bell Hell De Gaul, Footprint of the Reaper and most recently added, Black Ganveet, Legion of Darkness.

===Shobu&#x27;s family===
:
:Shobu&#x27;s father and a world famous duelist. Shori left home to continue his training, but he continued to miss his family every day. He reappeared in later episodes but disappeared again after the defeat of P.L.O.O.P. He makes an appearance in &quot;Duel Masters: Curse of the Death Phoenix&quot; to assist Shobu, only to disappear at its end. In Duel Masters Charge he was believed to have been killed in a duel against Zakira.
:Shori is primarily seen in flashbacks, and whether he is believed to be alive or dead varies from season to season. However, he is seen to be alive at the end of the &quot;SX&quot; manga and all media following it. He plays with a deck similar to, but more advanced than Shobu&#x27;s, with Bolberg Cross Dragon acting his trump card.
:
:Shobu&#x27;s mother and Shori&#x27;s wife. To help Shobu on different occasions, she has occasionally taken on the persona of a second &quot;Dragon Mask&quot; (the persona being first used by Knight) and challenged him.
:
:Shobu&#x27;s younger brother and the protagonist of the Versus and Victory seasons. He was in a coma as a young child during the events of Shobu&#x27;s season. He initially has an aversion to Duel Masters but quickly learns to enjoy dueling against people. He has a strong obsession with curry bread.
:
:Katta&#x27;s son and the protagonist of the 2017-2019 and King seasons. He lives with his mother Lulu. Joe has the power to bring his creature drawings to life with the help of his friend, the talking deck case Deckie. His favorite food is ramen.

===Shobu&#x27;s friends===
:
:Shobu&#x27;s best friend and loyal sidekick. Even though he is an expert at the rules Rekuta is a terrible duelist, often going without a single win during a tournament. He&#x27;s often seen with his portable laptop to keep track of important duels. As a running joke, he is often accidentally sent flying into the air.
:He has almost every card ever released (since his father owns a card shop) but cannot correctly use the cards. His card knowledge often helps Shobu during duels.
:
:Another of Shobu&#x27;s friends. Mimi first appeared to be both ditzy, but was later revealed to be the second of the Four Temple Guardians at the Junior Duelist Center and an expert player. Mimi also has super-strength and excellent martial arts abilities which enable her to bring down any walls and other obstacles. Her personality sometimes switches to a &quot;serious mode&quot; while dueling. Near the end of the first season, Mimi reveals that Hakuoh was not always a heartless duelist and her personal connection to Hakuoh has developed into a slight crush throughout the series. She mostly uses Nature Civilization cards, but tends to use Shield Triggers from all 5 civilizations.
; / Boy George
:A baby in a pink bear suit who is always seen sucking a pacifier. He rides around in a motor baby carriage and uses a Water Civilization deck, he is a skillful duelist and has even defeated Mimi (a powerful duelist in her own right) fairly easily. In &quot;Charge&quot;, he uses a Darkness/Water deck and withdraws from the tournament after losing to Yuu.
:
:Dr. Root is a mad scientist who is George&#x27;s boss and an expert duelist. Outside of that, he also a human-resembling robot named Mr. Perfect and a pilotable giant robot. His eccentric methods always have some hidden lesson to help Shobu and his friends. In &quot;Duel Masters Zero&quot;, he takes charge of training Shobu and his friends. He has a deck of Survivors in season 1, and in &quot;Charge&quot;, he has a Darkness/Water deck similar to George&#x27;s deck.
:
:Appearing only in the anime, Sayuki Manaka is another one of Shobu&#x27;s friends and classmates. A kind girl with a usually soft-spoken disposition, she cares deeply for Shobu and is always ready to help him when he&#x27;s down. In addition, she is always present to see Shobu&#x27;s matches and constantly cheers him on. Sayuki is shown to participate in duels on occasion. In the English version, Sayuki has an attitude despite being soft-spoken, and is very critical.
:
:Knight is Shobu&#x27;s mysterious and soft-spoken mentor. In the English dub, his inner monologue is a source of much of the show&#x27;s mature and subtle humor. Despite being Shobu&#x27;s mentor, he is usually unable to assist his student in times of need due to either Shobu&#x27;s stubborn attitude or Knight being unable to show up at the scene. On one occasion, Dr. Root had Knight take on a &quot;Dragon Mask&quot; persona to duel Shobu in order for him to reclaim his tournament pass. Knight, who only appears in the early anime, is loosely adapted from the manga-only character NAC.
:NAC is a manga-only character. This character is loosely based on , a Japanese card game player who became one of the top players in Asia. He was involved in the making of &quot;Duel Masters&quot;, assisting Dai Matsumoto (the manga author&#x27;s nickname) as a technical advisor (the manga&#x27;s plot is based around Magic: The Gathering). He has appeared in the manga both as NAC and as a more realistic cameo of himself known as &quot;Nakamura-san&quot;. According to one of Dai Matsumoto&#x27;s &quot;omake&quot; sections in the manga, NAC was also involved in the development of the Duel Masters card game.
; / Extreme Bucketman
:A short duelist who wears a bucket on his head. He first appears in the Battle Arena tournament in &quot;Charge&quot;. He lost to Yuu by surrendering, and later, under Zakira&#x27;s mind control, duels against Shobu. His Deck is Fire and Nature, mostly involving Earth Dragons and Firebirds. His trump card is Soul Phoenix, Avatar of Unity. He gives the card to Shobu to use in the final duel against Yuu. In Duel Masters Cross, he plays a Snow Faerie and Initiate deck.
; &quot;(マスター Masutā) in the manga&quot;
:Very little is known about the leader of the &quot;Temple&quot; (an organization within the Junior Duelist&#x27;s Center). Throughout the first season he appears in a long black, hooded robe with his face half concealed by his long blond hair. &quot;The Master&quot; appears as Hakuoh&#x27;s teacher and dueling coach. Knight suggests that the Master has only taken an interest in Hakuoh because he plans to use the young duelist in obtaining his &quot;revenge&quot; against the creature world who defeated him in a duel causing him to never duel again. &quot;Master&quot; seems to be responsible for Hakuoh&#x27;s brainwashing and even pushes Hakuoh to attack Shobu with Alcadeias after his defeat. Master disappears after Hakuoh&#x27;s defeat in Season 1 and hasn&#x27;t reappeared since.
; / Fritz the Goblin
:A goblin who works at the Junior Duelist&#x27;s Center. In the dub, he is often mistakenly called a squirrel. Anyone who wants to enroll in the Junior Duelist&#x27;s Center has to answer his riddles.

Kintaro returned in &quot;Charge&quot;, having regained Hakuoh&#x27;s friendship. He lost to Great Bucketsman in the Battle Arena tournament.

====Temple Guardians====
The are the elite members of the White Soldiers that work under Hakuoh.
; / Johnny Coolburns
:The first of the Temple Guardians. He uses a Fire deck, and during his duel with Shobu he purposely mimicked everything he did in order to throw him off. Mikuni managed to defeat Shobu, but Mimi managed to convince the Master to invite Shobu to try again in a duel against Mikuni. He is defeated by Shobu the second time around and thus he quickly befriends him. Due to his defeat at the hands of Shobu, Hakuoh ends up discharging Mikuni. He returns in &quot;Charge&quot;, having regained Hakouh&#x27;s friendship.
;Temple Guardian 2
:See Mimi Tasogare
; / Benny Haha
:The third of the Four Temple Guardians. In the English dub, he is Mimi&#x27;s &quot;twin brother&quot; where he had different plastic surgeries to look older where he claims that he is one minute older than Mimi. In the original version, he has no familial ties to other characters. Gyuujirou is often seen piloting a robot suit and first appears where he destroys Mimi&#x27;s access card upon her defeat and wrecks her deck. He often cheats and relies on deceit in his duels. His constant defeat at the hands of the series&#x27; heroes has led him to hate both Shobu and Hakuoh.
:Gyuujirou returns in &quot;Charge&quot; claiming to have turned over a new leaf, but this is quickly revealed to be an act. He forces Hakuoh into dueling before their match in a self-made Duel Masters Battle Arena by taking Aizen and Mikuni as hostage. Hakuoh manages to complete the &quot;perfect duel&quot; and defeat Gyuujirou despite his many attempts to cheat. Afterward, Gyuujirou detonates a bomb beneath the stadium and seriously injures Hakuoh so that he is unable to duel him the next morning. With Hakuoh eliminated, he ends up dueling Shobu again and loses. It is revealed that he is also working with Yuu.

==== Overview ====
====Episodes (Season 1)====
====English version====
The English-language version of the series was produced by Hasbro Entertainment and Plastic Cow Productions. It made a truncated four-episode preview premiere on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami block on February 27, 2004. The series then made its official premiere on March 13, 2004, as part of the Saturday Video Entertainment System block, with fewer edits. When Toonami was moved to Saturdays, the block premiered the rest of the series. It was also aired in a 6:00 AM timeslot on early Weekday mornings, as part of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Early Prime&quot; block, which was aimed at kids who were getting ready to go to school during this time on October 4 to December 31, 2004 and it returns once again on June 20 to December 30, 2005. 

A second batch of 26 episodes was produced by Hasbro Studios and Elastic Media Corporation and premiered on Cartoon Network on March 26, 2005. Despite being aired some months later, these episodes were considered part of the first season and featured an original storyline not adapted from the manga. While the original animation studio and staff remained the same as the first season, these episodes were never broadcast or acknowledged in Japan.

&quot;Duel Masters 2.0&quot; was later produced by Hasbro and Howling Cat Studios. It was adapted from the first half of &quot;Duel Masters Charge&quot;, compressing 26 episodes into 13. The final three episodes were scheduled but never aired.

Episodes of the English version are currently available for streaming on The Roku Channel, Tubi TV and Amazon Prime.

<doc id="1195796" wikidata="Q7874269" url="?curid=1195796" title="USS Southfield">
<text>USS &quot;Southfield&quot; was a double-ended, sidewheel steam gunboat of the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was sunk in action against the Confederate ironclad ram CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot; during the Battle of Plymouth (1864).

&quot;Southfield&quot; was built in 1857 at Brooklyn, New York by John English, and served as a ferry between South Ferry, New York, and St. George, Staten Island, until she was purchased by the U.S. Navy at New York City on December 16, 1861 from the New York Ferry Company. She was commissioned late in December 1861, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Charles F. W. Behm in command.

==Service history==
===Battle of Roanoke Island, 1862===
The double-ended gunboat joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Hampton Roads on the afternoon of January 2, 1862. On January 11, Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough ordered &quot;Southfield&quot; to proceed to Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, the staging area for an expedition against Roanoke Island, which controlled navigation in the North Carolina sounds. The gunboat was detained at Hampton Roads awaiting troops to fill out her complement until about sunset on January 16 when she got underway south. She reached Hatteras Inlet the next day.

Great labor was required to get Goldsborough&#x27;s ships and the U.S. Army transports over Hatteras bar. The last vessel entered the sounds on February 5, enabling the expedition to get underway.

The next morning, February 6, Goldsborough shifted his flag from the deep draft to &quot;Southfield&quot; since the double-ender was more nimble in shallow water. From her deck, he directed the attack on Confederate defenses, which began on the morning of February 7 with a heavy bombardment of Fort Bartow and was continued until dark. Late in the afternoon, Army troops under Brigadier General Ambrose Burnside landed under the cover of the naval gunfire.

The attack was resumed on the morning of February 8 and pressed until about midafternoon, when the Union flag flew over Fort Bartow. Shortly thereafter, the Union ships managed to break through the Confederate obstruction and enter Albemarle Sound.

The capture of Roanoke Island assured the Union forces free access to North Carolina&#x27;s vast system of inland waterways and endangered the South&#x27;s hold on much of North Carolina and Virginia. Norfolk, Virginia, a Southern strong point of special strategic importance, was flanked; and, in a few months, it was abandoned.

Goldsborough was vigorous in exploiting the opening he had created by the conquest of Roanoke Island. Two days later, Elizabeth City, North Carolina was in Union hands. New Bern, North Carolina fell on March 14. Beaufort, North Carolina was captured by the end of April. &quot;Southfield&quot; played a major role in these Union conquests.

===Peninsula Campaign, 1862===
Late in May, her effort in behalf of the Union cause in North Carolina was interrupted by General George McClellan&#x27;s request for more naval assistance in his drive up the peninsula from Fort Monroe toward Richmond, Virginia. &quot;Southfield&quot; arrived at Hampton Roads on June 2 and devoted most of the summer to operations on the York and James Rivers which form the peninsula. At the end of August, after McClellan had evacuated his army, the double-ender was sent to the Norfolk Navy Yard for badly needed repairs before returning to the North Carolina sounds.

===Battle of Washington, 1863===
Back in fighting trim, &quot;Southfield&quot; departed Hampton Roads on December 2, arrived at Hatteras Inlet the next day, and proceeded to Plymouth, North Carolina. On the morning of December 10, she engaged a Confederate land force which attacked that city. A Southern shot pierced her steam chest, disabling her engine and filling the ship with hot steam. The scalding vapor prevented the gunboat&#x27;s crew from reaching her magazine and thus made it impossible for her guns to continue their fire. Boats were lowered to pull the disabled ship downstream; but , hearing the firing, steamed up, took &quot;Southfield&quot; in tow, and returned with her to Plymouth. By that time, the Confederate raiders had withdrawn.

On the last day of March 1863, Confederate troops attacked and besieged the Union garrison at Washington, North Carolina. &quot;Southfield&quot; was ordered from Plymouth to the scene of the action where she engaged the investing forces. She and other Union gunboats also carried supplies through the blockade to sustain the beleaguered Northern troops, finally forcing the Southern attackers to withdraw on April 16.

The next day, &quot;Southfield&quot; headed back for Plymouth and, for the following year of relative quiet in the sounds of North Carolina, labored to protect the Union&#x27;s tenuous hold on the region.

===Battle of Plymouth, 1864===
In February 1864, Confederate forces attacked New Bern and captured the gunboat . On the first day of March, &quot;Southfield&quot; and tinclad ascended the Chowan River to assist Army steamer USS &quot;Bombshell&quot;, which had been cut off by Confederates above Petty Shore. On March 2, they shelled the Southern batteries, enabling &quot;Bombshell&quot; to dash down to safety.

The air was rife with rumors that Rebel ironclad ram CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot; was ready to descend the Roanoke River to destroy the Union warships in the sounds. On the afternoon of April 17, Confederate ground forces attacked Plymouth with artillery and musketry. The Union gunboats in the vicinity helped to defend the town for the remainder of the day and throughout the next.

That night, in anticipation of an attack by &quot;Albemarle&quot;, &quot;Southfield&quot; was brought alongside , and the two ships were lashed together for mutual protection and concentration of firepower. Before dawn on the morning of April 19, &quot;Albemarle&quot; emerged from the Roanoke. &quot;Miami&quot; and &quot;Southfield&quot; raced toward her. When the three ships collided, the ram scraped across &quot;Miami&#x27;s&quot; bow, smashed through &quot;Southfield&#x27;s&quot; starboard side, and pierced the wooden gunboat&#x27;s boiler. For a moment, both &quot;Miami&quot; and &quot;Albemarle&quot; were entangled with the fatally wounded double-ender. The forward ropes which had lashed &quot;Southfield&quot; to &quot;Miami&quot; were snapped by the collision, and the aft lines were cut by &quot;Miami&quot;&#x27;s crew. &quot;Albemarle&quot; had a harder time extricating herself from her bested and rapidly sinking adversary.

Before she could pull free from the wreck by backing her engines, the ram had taken on so much water that her forward deck was too far depressed to permit her to overtake &quot;Miami&quot; or to let her guns open fire on the departing side-wheeler. Thus, in sinking, &quot;Southfield&quot; saved her consort.

<text>Michael Louis Diamond (born November 20, 1965), better known as Mike D, is an American rapper, musician, and music producer. He is a founding member of the hip hop group Beastie Boys.

==Early life==
Diamond was born in New York City to Harold Diamond, an art dealer, and Hester (née Klein) Diamond, an interior designer and art collector. He grew up on the Upper West Side surrounded by artwork, including pieces by Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman. He attended the arts-oriented Saint Ann&#x27;s School and Walden School.

==Career==

In 1979, Diamond co-founded the band The Young Aborigines. In 1981, Adam Yauch, (known professionally as MCA), a friend and follower of the band, became their bass player, and on the suggestion of their then-guitar player, John Berry, the band changed their name to the Beastie Boys. By 1983, Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) joined, and their sound began to shift away from punk to hip hop.

In 1986, the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; was released on Def Jam Records and became a huge success. Though it spawned several singles, only one would reach the top twenty of the US Hot 100, the number 7 &quot;(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)&quot;. Sales of &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; were extremely strong, going multi-platinum during the time of its run. Several years later, it would be certified diamond status. The group would release several albums, some attaining platinum or multi-platinum status.

In 1992, Diamond had founded the Beastie Boys&#x27; now-defunct record label Grand Royal Records. He is also interested in interior design, and designed Brooklyn-themed toile wallpaper; it was used in the renovation of the Marquee nightclub in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City, which reopened in January 2013.

A year after the death of Yauch in 2012, Diamond told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; he was &quot;excited about making new stuff again&quot; and released &quot;Humberto Vs the New Reactionaries (Christine and the Queens Remix)&quot; in July 2013. A remix of Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band&#x27;s &quot;Bad Dancer&quot; by Diamond and Adam Horovitz was streamed online in August 2013. The pair is credited with &quot;additional beats, programming and other curve balls&quot;. In October 2014, Diamond stated that he had been working in the studio with American rock band Portugal. The Man as a producer. He has also produced English punk duo Soft Play&#x27;s (formerly Slaves) second studio album, &quot;Take Control&quot;, which was released on September 30, 2016.

He hosts the Apple Music podcast &quot;The Echo Chamber&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1993, Diamond married film, television and music video director Tamra Davis; they have since legally separated. They have two children, Davis Diamond and Skyler Diamond who formed the group Very Nice Person. They lived in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.

He grew up on Central Park West. He later lived in Brooklyn and Tribeca, and as of 2016 was living in Malibu, California.

<text>Raymond Moore (1920–1987) was a post-war English art photographer.

Born in Wallasey, then part of Cheshire, he served in the RAF and then trained as a painter at the Royal College of Art. After graduating, he was asked to set up a photography department at Watford College. Moore became interested in photography at a time when photography was still viewed in Britain as an undistinguished craft rather than a serious art form. Influenced by some of the images in Hugo van Wadenoyen&#x27;s seminal 1947 &quot;Wayside Snapshots&quot; book - a book which marked the start of the decisive British break with Pictorialism - Moore began to see fresh possibilities in the composition &amp; framing of everyday English landscapes. Moore went on to create black &amp; white fine art photographs; having his first solo gallery show in 1959. He continued teaching for most of his life, and he is widely regarded as one of the great teachers. Visiting the U.S. in 1968, he worked with photographer Minor White at MIT and was influenced by Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind. He had his first major solo show in 1970 at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1974 he became a lecturer at the influential Trent Polytechnic, Nottingham, but left in 1978 to pursue his own creative work in Cumbria. From around 1976 the climate in England slowly began to change in favour of art photography; and so Moore finally saw acclaim in his own country with a major London retrospective show at the Hayward Gallery, the publication of a strong book collection of his photography, and a BBC television documentary about his work. Moore&#x27;s influential work has now been out-of-print for more than twenty years.

==Quotes from Moore==

&quot;If we did but know it, the weather we so revile in these islands is about as perfect for photographic purposes as it could be made... To this vile weather we owe our most charming effects. If there was no bad weather, there would be no clouds and no gales, no rain and no snow. If there is one time more than another when the country smiles the most, it is during rain.&quot;—Raymond Moore.

&quot;Photography is a means of sifting or extracting visual phenomena - it can be solely concerned with conveying factual information about objects in a particular position in time and space - or it can convey an awareness or revelation of the marvellous.&quot;—Raymond Moore.

&quot;I&#x27;m just a go-between, things discover me, I don&#x27;t discover them. But in them I can find myself and grow&quot;—Raymond Moore.

<doc id="1195803" wikidata="Q5464478" url="?curid=1195803" title="Folk science">
<text>Folk science (also known as &quot;folk knowledge&quot; or &quot;folk classification&quot; (not to be confused with Folk classification, a method of classifying sedimentary rocks named after Robert L. Folk) describes ways of understanding and predicting the natural and social world, without the use of formalized, rigorous, methodologies (see Scientific method). One could label all understanding of nature predating the Greeks as &quot;folk science&quot;. Folk science is often positioned in contrast to mechanistic or “clockwork” understandings of the world, where the function of each part and the relationship of all parts to each other is known in detail.

It is unclear how folk science develops in humans. However, even children as young as 8 months old have been shown to understand some root concepts of folk biology. Children&#x27;s understanding does shift as they age, with the system of inferences they use developing as they grow. 

Folk science is often accepted as &quot;common wisdom&quot; in a given culture, and people often don’t realize that their explanations and understandings rely on folk science. While this is common in children, even adults tend to believe they have a more complete understanding of mechanisms than they really do. Because folk science is something people, even children, do naturally, scientists are not exempt. Folk science makes appearances in the theories of professional scientists. Anthropological studies of scientists show that their theories often stem from models with gaps, deductions, and analogies. While these simplifications and gaps are not part of the scientific method, they do often work and scientific advances continue to use folk scientific methods. In some cases, researchers might look deliberately to folk methods to augment or improve their own. Several notable of folk science intuition (such as the world being flat, or the sun revolving around the Earth, clarify why it is important to continue to use the scientific method to gather data to confirm or deny folk scientific theories. 

Formal sciences, due to their thorough permeation of society, can ultimately influence folk sciences. An example would be the concept of genetics, which is familiar to most adults in the 21st century, but at the level of a layperson. This leads to different inferences and folk scientific conclusions than those that would have been reached by a population without that knowledge. However, some kinds of folk science exist in all cultures. Folk biology, for example, is similar in all human societies. These similarities include what groups plants and animals are grouped into, and the hierarchies of these groups (such as “oaks” being a group of plants which is within the “tree” group). It also includes the ability to make inferences about some organisms based on other, similarly categorized, organisms.

* Folk history
* Folk linguistics

* Folk taxonomy

<doc id="1195804" wikidata="Q8022573" url="?curid=1195804" title="Willy Loman">
<text>William &quot;Willy&quot; Loman is a fictional character and the protagonist of Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, which debuted on Broadway with Lee J. Cobb playing Loman at the Morosco Theatre on February 10, 1949. Loman is a 63-year-old travelling salesman from Brooklyn with 34 years of experience with the same company who endures a pay cut and a firing during the play. He has difficulty dealing with his current state and has created a fantasy world to cope with his situation. This does not keep him from multiple suicide attempts.

==Description==
===Decline===
Willy Loman is an aging Brooklyn, New York salesman whose less than spectacular career is on the decline. He has lost the youthful verve of his past and his camaraderie has faded away. His business acumen is still at its peak, but he is no longer able to leverage his personality to get by. Time has caught up with him. The play presents Loman&#x27;s struggle &quot;to maintain a foothold in the upward-striving American middle class&quot; while combating his own self-doubt that plagues him in reminders from the past that his life rests on unsolid ground. According to Charles Isherwood, Loman is the play&#x27;s dominant character because &quot;It is his losing battle against spiritual and economic defeat that provides the narrative spine of the play.&quot; Loman is a symbolic representation of millions of white collar employees who outlived their corporate usefulness. He lives in a world with delusions about how popular, famous, influential and successful he is and about the prospects for the success of his sons. His wife not only allows these delusions, but also buys into them, somewhat. His misplaced values of importance and popularity are shaken to the core by his declining ability to leverage those self-perceived traits successfully as he grows older.
Loman&#x27;s world crumbles around him during the play. According to Associated Press correspondent Cynthia Lowry&#x27;s review of the drama, &quot;we watched an aging, defeated traveling salesman move inexorably toward self-destruction, clinging desperately to fantasies&quot;. The play begins with the 63-year-old Loman dealing with a recent pay cut after 34 years on the job at a time when he is having difficulty meeting his financial responsibilities. In the second act, he deals with being fired. He is fired by the son of the man who had hired him 36 years prior. In the play, Loman reveals his past in scenes from his memory that the audience is challenged to judge for accuracy. Loman had succeeded in large part due to his ability to ingratiate himself with his bosses and appeal to his potential clients; thus, he continually impresses upon his sons the importance of popularity.

===Reviews===

Although the play was performed earlier in Philadelphia, the February 10, 1949 Broadway opening is considered the debut and on February 11, Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the following: &quot;Mr. Cobb&#x27;s tragic portrait of the defeated salesman is acting of the first rank. Although it is familiar and folksy in the details, it has something of the grand manner in the big size and the deep tone.&quot; While reviewing a touring production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Laurie Winer described Loman as &quot;...the saddest, self-centeredest soul in American drama, a character who will continue to haunt the landscape as long as there are fathers and sons.&quot; United Press International critic Rick Du Brow described Loman as &quot;...the aging failure of a salesman who has wasted his life by living in a world of delusions and shallow values...&quot; Willy is described as a &quot;suffering. . .middle-aged man at the end of his emotional rope&quot;. Lowry described the production as depicting &quot;the end of a man when his dream world is shattered&quot;.

The play&#x27;s author, Arthur Miller, described the role of Willy Loman as one for a large character in a small physical body, and noted he had difficulty finding the right actor at first. The part was originally written for a physically small man, with Willy at one point saying to his wife, &quot;I&#x27;m short. I&#x27;m very foolish to look at.&quot; When Cobb was cast, the line was changed to &quot;I&#x27;m fat. I&#x27;m very foolish to look at,&quot; and a reference to Willy being called a &quot;shrimp&quot; was changed to a &quot;walrus.&quot; Subsequent productions used whichever version was appropriate to the actor playing Willy; Dustin Hoffman, for example, used the original. Loman&#x27;s Brooklyn accent is part of the challenge of the role. In 1950, Miller described Loman as a man who upon hearing society&#x27;s &quot;thundering command to succeed&quot; found himself staring at a failure in the mirror. The Amazon.com editorial review by Ali Davis states that &quot;Willy Loman is a salesman desperately hustling for a living even as he slides into old age.&quot; Rovi Corporation&#x27;s Matthew Tobey describes him as an everyman who has to cope with the sudden realization that he is over the hill, and retreats into a fantasy world in which he remains important. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;″s theater critic, Wilborn Hampton, describes the role as &quot;one of the most complicated characters in dramatic literature&quot;.

The play is a statement on the idea that a man is valued by his position in life. Loman never matures enough to realize that being popular without any substance or skill is meaningless in the end, and Miller uses Loman to make a point against anti-intellectualism. In the end, Loman gives way to the belief that his inability to be a successful man and father means that his life has been a failure.

==Family==
Willy&#x27;s marriage to his wife Linda is described as &quot;symbolic&quot;. Linda is a devoted wife who understands her husband&#x27;s needs, dreams and shortcomings. Linda has emotional scenes as she attempts to manage Willy&#x27;s emotional collapse and deals with her two adult sons, who have both wasted their lives following the easy road of pursuing popularity, as guided by their father. She breaks down as she confides in her sons about Willy&#x27;s disintegration and reveals that he has attempted suicide before.

Willy has always made the point to his sons that being popular and having contacts is the key to success. His older, less successful son, Biff, causes &quot;old hopes and boiling resentments&quot; to return by visiting home after losing yet another job. Biff and Willy love each other, but do not get along; Biff resents Willy for insisting he pursue a life he doesn&#x27;t want, while Willy thinks Biff has failed on purpose to spite him. Their relationship is the emotional lynchpin of the production. Biff attempts to help his father see what has become of him. In the end, Biff decides that he must force his father to see the truth rather than his fanciful images, for his own good, regardless of its toll on his father. This is the emotional climax of the show as he bares his soul, saying, &quot;Pop, I&#x27;m nothing! I&#x27;m nothing, Pop! Can&#x27;t you understand that? There&#x27;s no spite in it any more. I&#x27;m just what I am, that&#x27;s all.&quot; At Willy&#x27;s funeral, Biff states that &quot;He had the wrong dreams...He never knew who he was.&quot;

Although Willy&#x27;s younger son, Happy, is self-absorbed, he attempts to humor his father. He views his Uncle Ben (his father&#x27;s dead brother) as his role model rather than his father because Ben went out to the world as a teenager and was rich by the age of 21. He repeatedly reminds Willy of this. In the end, he is determined to not only adopt his father&#x27;s dream (even when it killed him), but to surpass him as he states &quot;It&#x27;s the only dream you can have—to come out No. 1 man.&quot;

Besides interacting with his wife and his sons, Willy spends much time during the play in fantasy conversations with his long-dead brother Ben, whom Willy still idolizes, calling on him for guidance, for instance, when he is fired from his job. Toward the end of the play—when Willy has dreamed up a scheme to kill himself so that Biff can receive the money from his insurance policy and finally become successful—he &quot;debates&quot; the merits of his plan with Ben, finally deciding to go ahead with it after Ben (in his mind) comes to agree with him that it&#x27;s a good idea.

==Critical history==
Loman is the central role of the only play that has won a Tony Award for Best Broadway Production four times (Best Play, Best Revival and twice Best Revival of a Play).

Each of the four Broadway revivals has brought critical acclaim to the role. In addition, the role has been reprised in film with six English-language film portrayals of this character, at least four of which received critical acclaim. Three actors have won Golden Globe Awards playing the role, two have won Drama Desk Awards playing the role and actors playing the role have also won a Primetime Emmy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Tony Award. The role has been nominated for an Oscar Award, a BAFTA Award, a Grammy Award, three Tony Awards and three Primetime Emmy Awards. At least two West End productions have earned Olivier Awards for this role.

Although Cobb did not earn critical acclaim when he originated the role, he did when he reprised it for television. Other actors who have played the role on Broadway or in English-language cinema or television have almost all received critical acclaim. On Broadway, the role was reprised by George C. Scott (1975, Tony nomination), Dustin Hoffman (1984, Drama Desk award), Brian Dennehy (1999, Tony and Drama Desk awards), Philip Seymour Hoffman (2012, Tony nomination), and Wendell Pierce (2022). In cinema and on television, the role has also been highly acclaimed: Fredric March (1951, Golden Globe award and both Oscar and BAFTA nominations), Cobb (1966, Emmy and Grammy nominations), Rod Steiger (1966), D. Hoffman (1985, Golden Globe and Emmy awards), Warren Mitchell (1996) and Dennehy (2000, Golden Globe and SAG awards and Emmy nomination).

===Awards===
Fredric March won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama at the 9th Golden Globe Awards and was nominated for Academy Award for Best Actor at the 24th Academy Awards and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Foreign) at the 6th British Academy Film Awards.

Brian Dennehy won Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play at the 53rd Tony Awards in 1999, while Philip Seymour Hoffman was nominated for the same award at the 66th Tony Awards in 2012 and George C. Scott was nominated for the award at the 30th Tony Awards in 1976.

Dennehy also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film at the 58th Golden Globe Awards in 2001 and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie at the 7th Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2001 and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie at the 52nd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2000.

Dustin Hoffman and Brian Dennehy won Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play at the 1984 and 1999 Drama Desk Awards.

Hoffman also won both the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film at the 43rd Golden Globe Awards in 1986 and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie at the 38th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1986.

Lee J. Cobb was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Drama at the 19th Primetime Emmy Awards as well as a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word, Documentary or Drama Recording at the 9th Grammy Awards in 1967.

Warren Mitchell earned the Laurence Olivier Award for Actor of the Year in a Revival in 1979 for his West End theatre performance of the role. Dennehy earned a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in 2006 for his reprisal of the role in the West End.

===Commentary===
&quot;Time&quot; described Scott&#x27;s performance as &quot;...a performance of staggering impact...When his head is bowed, it is not in resignation but rather like that of a bull bloodied by the picador yet ready to charge again.&quot; Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s performance came at a time when the Occupy Wall Street movement echoed the play while its actors could not afford the $120 ticket price. The March version of Loman presented him as more mentally unstable than other versions.

==Influences==
Miller noted that although he wrote the play in 1947 and 1948, the play grew out of his life experiences, that included his father losing everything in the 1929 stock market crash. Miller claims that the role was actually modeled on one of his uncles.

Dustin Hoffman says that the play was the first one he ever read and predated his interest in becoming an actor. He noted that the play resonated with him because his father was a travelling salesman and he had an older brother. Hoffman eventually played the role in a high-school production. In 1965, Hoffman served as the assistant director in an off-Broadway revival of &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; at the Sheridan Square Playhouse with a cast that included Robert Duvall and Jon Voight. The show&#x27;s director Ulu Grosbard suggested to Miller that Hoffman had the potential to make a great Willy Loman. Miller was unimpressed and later wrote that &quot;My estimate of Grosbard all but collapsed as, observing Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s awkwardness and his big nose that never seemed to get unstuffy, I wondered how the poor fellow imagined himself a candidate for any kind of acting career.&quot;

<text>Walking with Dinosaurs is a 1999 six-part nature documentary television miniseries created by Tim Haines and produced by the BBC Science Unit, the Discovery Channel and BBC Worldwide, in association with TV Asahi, ProSieben and France 3. Envisioned as the first &quot;Natural History of Dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; depicts dinosaurs and other Mesozoic animals as living animals in the style of a traditional nature documentary. The series first aired on the BBC in the United Kingdom in 1999 with narration by Kenneth Branagh. The series was subsequently aired in North America on the Discovery Channel in 2000, with Avery Brooks replacing Branagh.

&quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; recreated extinct species through the combined use of computer-generated imagery and animatronics that were incorporated with live action footage shot at various locations, the techniques being inspired by the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993). At a cost of £6.1 million ($9.9 million), &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; cost over £37,654 ($61,112) per minute to produce, making it the most expensive documentary series per minute ever made. The visual effects of the series were initially believed to be far too expensive to produce, but innovative techniques by the award-winning graphics company Framestore made it possible to bring down costs sufficiently to produce the three-hour series.

With 15 million people viewing the first airing of the first episode, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was by far the most watched science programme in British television during the 20th century. The series received critical acclaim and won numerous awards, including two BAFTA Awards, three Emmy Awards and a Peabody Award. Most scientists applauded &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; for its use of scientific research and for its portrayal of dinosaurs as animals and not movie monsters. Some scientific criticism was leveled at the narration not making clear what was speculation and what was not, and a handful of specific scientific errors.

The success of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; spawned an entirely new genre of documentaries that similarly recreated past life with computer graphics and were made in the style of traditional nature documentaries. It also led to the creation of an entire media franchise of similar sequel documentary series, the &quot;Walking with...&quot; franchise produced by the BBC Studios Science Unit, which included &quot;Walking with Beasts&quot; (2001), &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; (2003), &quot;Sea Monsters&quot; (2003) and &quot;Walking with Monsters&quot; (2005). The series was accompanied by companion books and an innovative companion website. Additionally, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; inspired the creation of exhibitions, the live theatrical show &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs − The Arena Spectacular&quot;, video games, and a 2013 film adaptation. Along with &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; is often cited as among the most influential media depictions of dinosaurs.

In 2024, the BBC and PBS announced a new reinvention of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; is in production.

== Premise ==
Envisioned as the first &quot;Natural History of Dinosaurs&quot; and a series that would provide viewers with &quot;a window into a lost world&quot;, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; explores life in the Mesozoic era, particularly dinosaurs, in the format of a traditional nature documentary.

== Production ==

=== Background and concept ===
&quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was the brainchild of Tim Haines, who came with the idea in 1996 while he was working as a science television producer at the BBC. Then-head of BBC Science Jana Bennett had at the time started a policy of encouraging producers to pitch possible future landmark series, with the goal of increasing the science output of the BBC and raising the bar of science programming. Bennett had mainly asked for suggestions for series on geology, medicine and natural history. The idea for &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was devised in the aftermath of the release of the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in 1993, which had set a new benchmark for dinosaur entertainment. Initially, Haines idea revolved around a history of palaeontology with some reconstructions but this was deemed to not be ambitious enough, shortly thereafter he devised the idea of a dinosaur series made with the look and feel of a natural history programme.

Haines suggested that the same techniques employed in the production of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; could be used to create a series of nature documentary programmes. According to Haines, the aim of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was to &quot;create an immersive experience that was both spectacular and informative&quot;. Haines investigated the costs that would be involved in the project. He first initially approached Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), the company responsible for creating the visual effects in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, which projected a cost of $10,000 per second of dinosaur footage, far too expensive for a television series. Though &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; had only nine minutes of dinosaur footage, the series envisioned by Haines would require three hours. As a result, Haines initially changed his idea to the programme mainly consisting of footage of plants, insects and landscapes with dinosaurs appearing only occasionally.

The concept for the series changed back to frequent CGI creatures after Haines spoke with the UK-based graphics company Framestore. Framestore had previously won Emmy Awards for their work on films such as &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1999) and miniseries such as &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1996). The head of Framestore, Mike Milne, at first turned down the project owing to its projected cost but later accepted since he realised that he would later regret it if another company took it up. Milne understood the concept of the programme and was able to bring down the cost of the animation considerably through flexibility and imagination. With Milne&#x27;s assurance that making the programme would be possible, Haines pitched the idea to Bennett as a 6-episode series of 30-minute episodes and he called it &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, at this time only intended to be a working title and deriving from Haines misremembering the title of the 1990 film &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;.

=== Pilot episode and funding ===

The BBC liked the concept of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; but were nervous whether a series of its scale was actually achievable. After also pitching the idea to BBC Worldwide, Haines was granted £100,000 to produce a short pilot episode. In the spring of 1997, Haines, accompanied by a single cameraman, travelled to a national park near Paphos in Cyprus to shoot footage for the pilot. Milne then gathered a small team to produce models and animations. The resulting proof-of-concept pilot, finished by the summer of 1997, was six minutes long. The only consultant so far brought in for the project was the palaeontologist David Martill, who offered his services on the pilot for free if he could then stay on as a consultant should the pilot succeed and a series be made.

The pilot episode was marine-themed, revolving around a beached giant pliosaur, and based on the fossils of the Jurassic Oxford Clay in England (a setting later used for the episode &quot;Cruel Sea&quot;), a setting suggested by Martill. After concerns that the marine episode might not have enough &quot;superstar&quot; animals, Martill suggested the inclusion of the theropod dinosaur &quot;Eustreptospondylus&quot;. One of the major differences between the pilot and the later series was that it included partial x-rays of the inner workings of the animals so that they could be better explained. In the later series this was abandoned in favour of a more standard &quot;natural history&quot; aesthetic. In addition to the pilot, Framestore also produced stills and a shorter trailer with a group of plesiosaurs hunting fish to sell the idea of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;.

There was already considerable interest in the series by the time the pilot was shown owing to the trailer and stills produced by Framestore. Jana Bennett also championed the idea of the series to both Michael Jackson, controller of BBC One, and Mike Quattrone of the Discovery Channel. The pilot was then enough to persuade the BBC, BBC Worldwide, and the Discovery Channel to fund the production of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;. Approximately third of the &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; budget came from BBC One, a third from the Discovery Channel, and a third from BBC Worldwide. There were also major investments from TV Asahi in Japan and ProSieben in Germany.

&quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was considered a high-risk production due to being highly expensive and using &quot;Hollywood technology&quot; to educate rather than just entertain. In total, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; cost £6.1 million ($9.9 million) to make. It cost over £37,654 ($61,112) per minute to produce, making it the most expensive documentary series per minute ever made. It was during production billed as one of the most ambitious series ever produced. Together with Haines, the series was also created by the acclaimed programme maker Susan Spindler, who had previously worked on the BBC series &quot;The Human Body&quot;. The team grew to encompass producer Jasper James (who produced and directed the third and fourth episodes and also directed the sixth; Haines handled the rest), production manager Alison Woolnough and executive producer John Lynch.

=== Pre-production and filming ===

Haines spent two years speaking with scientists and reading both primary and secondary palaeontological sources to create the stories for &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;. Though the goal was to make the programme feel as if it was just relaying natural events without intervention, as actual nature documentaries, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; required Haines to plot out narratives and create storyboards.

Production of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; took 18 months. It was essential to the vision of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; that the age of the dinosaurs be represented as accurately as possible based on current scientific understanding. In addition to Haines&#x27;s own research, the production team for the first six months devoted all their time to research and carefully chose particular moments during the Mesozoic that were most well-studied and well-understood by scientists and which would be representative of the era and showcase interesting animals. In addition to the producers doing their own research, over a hundred experts were consulted for every aspect of the series.

Slowly, the production team focused in on animals about whom sufficient information was known to create larger narratives. As an example, &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was selected for &quot;New Blood&quot; (the first episode) because it was a typical early dinosaur which scientists knew a lot about. Since the series also aimed to showcase the environment and other animals around the &quot;star&quot; dinosaurs, &quot;Coelophysis&quot; also presented an opportunity since it had been found at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, one of the world&#x27;s richest fossil beds. The behaviour of the animals depicted was primarily based on fossil evidence when possible (such as bite marks and fossil gut contents) and on behaviours in modern animals. Sometimes, behaviour was just reasoned guesses. For instance, the small pterosaur &quot;Anurognathus&quot; is shown in &quot;Time of the Titans&quot; (the second episode) to use the massive sauropod &quot;Diplodocus&quot; as a feeding platform to hunt insects. This was based on certain modern birds; there is no evidence of such behaviour in pterosaurs and it would be difficult to prove with fossil evidence.

In the summer of 1997 and in the winter of 1998, Haines and fellow producer Jasper James took a small crew of eight people to travel around the world to places where ancient plant life reminiscent of plants during the Mesozoic still existed; locations that could be used as backdrops for the series. Of particular importance was an absence of grass, which at the time was believed to not have existed during the Mesozoic. Filming took several weeks and locations included the Labyrinth in Tasmania, the beech gap on South Island in New Zealand, the redwood forests of California, the araucaria forests in New Caledonia and southern Chile and the Bahamas. Shooting at a single location usually lasted for about four weeks. New Caledonia was particularly difficult to shoot in since the French Army were doing exercises there simultaneously and the film crew kept bumping into soldiers and tanks.

=== Special effects ===
==== Computer graphics ====

Mike Milne and Framestore, consisting of fifteen designers, began working on animating the dinosaurs at the same time as Haines and James were shooting footage for the series. Production of several hours of high quality photoreal animation had never been done before, not even for feature films. The process of making the computer models began with creating clay maquettes, highly detailed small-scale physical models. Several palaeontologists were consulted during the process of making the maquettes. In addition to David Martill, the consultants of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; included, among others, Kent Stevens, Thomas R. Holtz, David Norman, David Unwin, Ken Carpenter, Jo Wright and Michael J. Benton. At times, details changed during production. For instance, the sauropod necks of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; were at first fully erect before being altered on the advice of the sauropod neck expert Kent Stevens. In September 1998, Milne held a talk at the 46th Symposium on Vertebrate Palaeontology and Comparative Anatomy (SVPCA) at the University of Bournemouth, showcasing early renderings from the pilot and the series and gathering feedback from the palaeontologists in attendance.

After the maquettes were completed, Framestore scanned them into their computers using both a high resolution laser and a set of software tools developed together with Soho-CyberScan specifically for &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;. The models were then imported into Softimage 3D, where they could be digitally manipulated and animated. The animations were made by hand one frame at a time, an extremely time-consuming process, since it quickly became evident that any other method would have resulted in unconvincing animation. Since no one had ever seen a moving non-avian dinosaur, the animators based their animations on both footage of living animals, particularly elephants, and on information provided by palaeontologists. Palaeontologists provided information on the dynamics of dinosaur muscles, tendons and joints. In numerous cases, the animals in &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; had never before been animated with this level of scientific rigour. Many movements, such as the movement of pterosaurs on the ground, were educated guesses made based on scientific advice.

The textures for the models were created through a process of science-based guessing, deriving from the inferred life behaviour of the animals, their diet and their size (larger animals in real life tend to have duller colours). The digital artist Daren Horley was responsible for creating the textures and patterns of the animals and was during production sent actual fossil examples of dinosaur skin impressions. Despite the fossils available, Horley found that there had to in some cases be some informed compromise between strict accuracy and what looked best on screen; the scales of some species were too small to be visible on television screens.

The CGI shots were rendered by Framestore using eight twin-processor NT boxes, at times augmented with the SGI workstations (single R10K processors) of the animators. The computer effects for the first episode took around a year to make, though the process could be significantly sped up afterwards; the five other episodes together took only six months. Initially, Framestore produced 24 different computer-generated animals, but as the concept of the series grew they had made 40 different species by the end of production. Compositing (adding the CGI together with the live footage) was done using five Quantel Henrys and five Discreet Logic Infernos.

==== Animatronics ====
Though most of the animal shots in &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; are CGI, the series also made extensive use of animatronics and puppets. Haines explained in behind-the-scenes material that animatronics, despite advances in CGI, still played an important role, particularly in close-up shots; &quot;The computer can fool the eye making a dinosaur run through a puddle and splashing but if you want a close-up of him dipping his nose into water and moving it back and forth, a computer-generated nose wouldn&#x27;t look right.&quot;

The animatronics and puppets of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; were made by the special effects company Crawley Creatures. Over 80 animatronic models were made for the series, mostly for close-ups of heads or other body parts. In some cases full body versions were made, mostly for corpses but also for some animals, such as &quot;Ophthalmosaurus&quot;. The greatest challenge for the artist at Crawley Creatures was working against time, since they only had six weeks between location shoots to put together animatronics and puppets for the next episode. The most challenging animal to model was the large pterosaur &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot;, which had to be able to work in different positions for the purposes of the series and had to be extremely light-weight for purposes of transportation.

After filming, several of the models used in &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, including those of &quot;Ophthalmosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot; and &quot;Koolasuchus,&quot; were given to David Martill and then used by him for educational purposes at the University of Portsmouth. The &quot;Ophthalmosaurus&quot; model, having been dragged through water, had to be repaired and repainted and is today displayed for the public; the &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot; and &quot;Koolasuchus&quot; models were later sold. Numerous models also made their way to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History due to an association between Crawley Creatures and the museum.

=== Music ===
Ben Bartlett composed the score for &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;. Bartlett was then working with the BBC, having produced some station ident themes for BBC Radio 3. Bartlett was encouraged to accept the duties of composing the series&#x27; music at the behest of Haines and James. Bartlett wrote different leitmotifs in separate styles for each episode, citing the different themes and settings presented in each episode as inspiration, elaborating, &quot;I tried to create a different sound world for each episode of &quot;Walking With Dinosaurs&quot;. That was easy, as they all had different moods. The first episode is all about heat and bloodlust, parched deserts and so on, while the second one was pastoral, peaceful, and beautiful, about dinosaurs living in symbiosis with the forests. And so on.&quot; The process of creating the score was that Bartlett would first watch the unscored episodes together with the directors, discussing with them possible music, and then write the music and produce a sample for approval. At times, this was difficult since the production of the computer graphics fell behind and some scenes were not finished in time for the recording sessions.

The recording process took place at Angel Recording Studios in Islington, with four sessions scattered over the early months of 1999. The score was recorded by the BBC Concert Orchestra. During these sessions, Bartlett admitted to being enriched with experience by the task, stating, &quot;It was the biggest orchestral endeavour I&#x27;ve ever undertaken, and I learnt so much from the first session. Practical things, like handing out the parts to the players &quot;before&quot; the session, numbering pages... tiny logistical things that can really screw up a session.&quot; The BBC were early on impressed with the soundtrack and requested Bartlett and the orchestra to also produce tracks for a CD of the soundtrack.

== Episodes ==

=== &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; (1999) ===
BBC One aired the series weekly on Monday nights, with regular repeats the following Sunday. In 2010, the series was repeated on BBC Three in omnibus format, as three hour-long episodes.

=== Specials (2000–2003) ===
Three special episodes of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; have been produced since the end of the original series. The first special was &quot;The Ballad of Big Al&quot; (2000), which closely followed the format of the original series but mostly focused on a single individual animal, an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimen nicknamed &quot;Big Al&quot;.&quot;&quot; In response to complaints from scientists that many details in the original series seemed speculative, &quot;The Ballad of Big Al&quot; explained virtually every decision in detail and how it was based on fossil evidence. The two succeeding specials, &quot;The Giant Claw&quot; (2002) and &quot;Land of Giants&quot; (2003), starred wildlife presenter Nigel Marven as a &quot;time-travelling zoologist&quot;, traveling back in time and interacting with various dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals.

== Reception ==
&quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was broadcast to record audiences and is sometimes considered the biggest science documentary series ever created. With 15 million viewers viewing the first episode on 4 October 1999 and another 3.91 million viewing it on its repeat the Sunday afterwards, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; is by far the most watched science programme in British television history. By late 2000, 200 million people worldwide had seen the &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;. By 2005 the number had increased to almost 400 million and by 2009 it was around 700 million; unprecedented numbers for a palaeontology programme. In the BFI TV 100, a list compiled by the British Film Institute in 2000 of the greatest British TV programmes of all time and of any genre, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was placed 72nd.

=== Reviews ===
&quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was released to critical acclaim. Most scientists applauded &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; for its use of scientific research and for its portrayal of dinosaurs as animals and not movie monsters. Some reviews were dismissive and contemptuous. &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was praised in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;. Negative reviews were mostly founded on the series in some cases appearing to present speculation as fact. Nancy Banks-Smith in her review of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; also worried that the success of the series would lead to the BBC exploiting its appeal to younger viewers and launching merchandise, writing that &quot;I begin to think that the whole thing is geared to selling chocolate dinosaur eggs to five-year-olds&quot;.

Online reviewers were largely positive. Common Sense Media praised the program, giving it five stars out of five and saying that, &quot;Somebody had a great idea, which was to make a documentary series about dinosaurs, but with a twist. The ageing &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot; on a desperate final flight to his mating grounds, the sauropod hatchlings struggling for survival in the late Jurassic, the migrating herds and the undersea life of 150 million years ago would all seem as real as a nature program about polar bears or snow monkeys.&quot; &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was also praised by IGN, which referred to it as a fascinating documentary with excellent narratives, video quality and audio quality. The score of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was praised in the music technology magazine &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, &quot;strikingly cinematic&quot; and &quot;head and shoulders above previous efforts in the same genre&quot;.

=== Awards ===
== In other media ==

=== Books ===
A companion book, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs: A Natural History&quot;, was written by Tim Haines to accompany the first screening of the series in 1999. The settings of some of the six episodes were changed between the time the book was written and the screening of the television series, and some of their names were changed: &quot;New Blood&quot; is set at Ghost Ranch, and &quot;Cruel Sea&quot; is set at or near Solnhofen in Germany near what then were the Vindelicisch Islands. The book elaborated on the background for each story, went further in explaining the science on which much of the program is based, and included descriptions of several animals not identified or featured in the series. &quot;A Natural History&quot; received a positive review in the book review magazine &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, where it was called &quot;magnificent&quot; and &quot;marvelously illustrated&quot;.

A companion volume to the first book, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs: The Evidence&quot;, by David Martill and Darren Naish was published in 2000. It went into more detail about the research and suppositions that went into making the series. Michael J. Benton also wrote an accompanying book on the science of the series, titled &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs: The Facts&quot;. In addition to these larger volumes, there were also numerous children&#x27;s books released to accompany &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, including 3D albums, sticker albums, photo journals as well as shorter science books geared towards children.

=== Exhibition ===
The success of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; resulted in the creation of both exhibits and traveling exhibitions. Only a few months after the series had aired, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs: The Exhibition&quot; was put up in the summer of 2000 at the Yorkshire Museum in York, England. The exhibition featured an assortment of different animal exhibits, each having some connection to the series, including props, maquettes, newly made models and actual fossil material. Among the fossils on display was a skeleton of a &quot;Plateosaurus&quot;. Also included in the exhibition were a video and TV monitor playing &quot;The Making Of Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;. The opening of the exhibition was attended by consultants of the series, such as David Martill. The guest of honour was Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

=== Live theatrical show ===
In 2007, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was adapted as the live stage show &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs − The Arena Spectacular&quot; by the Australian-based company The Creature Technology Company. The production cost $20 million to stage and used puppetry, suits, and animatronics to create 16 Mesozoic era creatures representing 10 species. Each large dinosaur weighed several tons, and was operated by two &quot;voodoo puppeteers&quot; and a driver beneath the dinosaur who also monitors the hydraulics and batteries. The smaller dinosaurs were suits operated by the person in it, each weighing from 20–30 kg (44–66 lbs). After debuting in Sydney in 2007, &quot;The Arena Spectacular&quot; toured the world for twelve years; over 250 cities were visited and almost 10 million people in total watched the show live. The final show was held at the Taipei Arena in Taiwan on 22 December 2019.

=== Film adaptation ===

Released in 2013, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; is a feature-length film about dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous period years ago. The production features computer-animated dinosaurs in live-action settings with actors Justin Long, John Leguizamo, Tiya Sircar, and Skyler Stone providing voiceovers for the main characters. It was directed by Neil Nightingale and Barry Cook from a screenplay by John Collee.

The film was produced by BBC Earth and Evergreen Films and was named after the original BBC miniseries. The film, with a budget of , was one of the largest independent productions to date; it was financed by Reliance Entertainment and IM Global, with 20th Century Fox handling distribution. The crew filmed footage on location in the U.S. state of Alaska and in New Zealand, which were chosen for their similarities to the dinosaurs&#x27; surroundings millions of years ago, and on locations in Humboldt County, California. Animal Logic designed computer-animated dinosaurs and added them to the live-action backdrop. Though the film was originally going to have a narrator like in the miniseries, Fox executives wanted to add voiceovers to connect audiences to the characters.

&quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; premiered on 2013 at the Dubai International Film Festival. It was released in cinemas in 2D and 3D on 2013. Critical reception was largely negative, with praise towards film&#x27;s visual effects but criticism for its story and voice acting. The film grossed in the United States and Canada and in other territories for a worldwide total of . &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said the film&#x27;s global box office performance was disappointing in context of the production budget and marketing spend.

In 2014, the film was rereleased in theatres and museums under the title &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs: Prehistoric Planet 3D&quot;. This version shortens the running time to 45 minutes and replaces the voiceovers with narration provided by Benedict Cumberbatch. Compared to its predecessor, this version received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics.

=== Video games ===
&quot;Dinosaur World&quot; is a freeware video game developed by Asylum Entertainment and published by the BBC Imagineering in June 2001. It is a spin-off of Episode 2 of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; (&quot;Time of the Titans&quot;) and the special &quot;The Ballad of Big Al&quot;. The main point of the game is to find all the animals and plants, including several location features, that are distributed in five different zones. The game was available on the BBC website as an alpha, as it was never fully developed.

In 2013, an augmented reality video game, titled simply &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, was developed by Supermassive Games in collaboration with the BBC, as part of the resurgence of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, accompanying the release of the 2013 film adaptation. It was released in Europe on 13 November 2013, and in North America on 12 November 2013, alongside &quot;Diggs Nightcrawler&quot; and &quot;Book of Potions&quot;.

=== Website ===
To accompany &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, the BBC launched a website filled with both palaeontological information, behind-the-scenes information on the series, games and puzzles, glossaries, and a section where visitors could ask questions and make comments. The creation of a companion website, which went online in September 1999, was considered innovative for the time. Before the release of the series, the website included a trailer, still a new concept for a website in 1999. The website was updated weekly as new episodes were released, eventually becoming a large resource with educational material.

== Legacy and influence ==

=== Scientific response ===
Scientists largely applauded &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, some going so far as heralding it as the &quot;most credibly accurate depiction of dinosaur life ever produced.&quot; Despite some complaints of scientific inaccuracies, the series was seen, and continues to be remembered, as mostly a &quot;force for good&quot;, showing both the possibility of producing documentaries of its scale and for portraying dinosaurs and other Mesozoic animals as animals and not movie monsters. Michael J. Benton, who worked as a consultant on the series, praised &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; as a progression in both reconstructions of prehistoric life and in the promotion of the public understanding of science; Benton in a 2001 article referred to the series as not just a documentary but also a &quot;powerful piece of palaeobiological research&quot;, showing to the public what the &quot;best minds in palaeobiology have been able to achieve.&quot; Numerous scientific journal articles have been written on &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; and the phenomenon it created.

==== Scientific errors ====

Although the academic response to &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was largely positive, the series was criticised by some palaeontologists for its speculative storylines and the boldness of some of its claims, noting that some aspects presented as fact were very much speculative and possible to be challenged in the future. In the companion book of the series, Haines admitted that speculating about dinosaur behaviour in of itself is unscientific since the theories cannot be tested, but maintained that it &quot;seems well worth trying to find out more about how [the dinosaurs] may have lived&quot;, using both science and reasoned speculation. A handful of decisions and sequences in the series came under particular palaeontological criticism. Several supposed errors identified in the first weeks after the series aired fizzled out after a while, as critics found points about which they disagreed with one another and were unable to definitively prove their views. Most of the errors or otherwise questionable decisions of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; were not the fault of the production team since they worked based on the advice of their consultants.

&quot;New Blood&quot; shows a male &quot;Postosuchus&quot; urinating to mark a female&#x27;s territory as his own after she is driven away from it. A number of critics pointed out that birds and crocodiles, the closest living relatives of the dinosaurs, do not urinate; they shed waste chemicals as more solid uric acid. However, Michael J. Benton, a consultant of the series, noted that nobody could prove that this was a real mistake: copious urination is the primitive state for tetrapods (seen in fish, amphibians, turtles, and mammals), and perhaps basal archosaurs did the same. &quot;New Blood&quot; also depicts &quot;Plateosaurus&quot; as a quadruped, but more recent studies suggest that it was an obligate biped due to its inability to pronate its manus.

&quot;Diplodocus&quot; was reconstructed with mostly horizontal necks in &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, an idea consistent with what was thought of their biology at the time, and thus pushed by the palaeontological consultants of the series, but challenged by new research in 2009.

The pterosaur identified as &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot; in &quot;Giant of the Skies&quot; was actually based on fossils of the pterosaur &quot;Tropeognathus&quot;, the two having been considered synonyms by David Unwin, one of the consulting palaeontologists. Additionally, it is depicted as far larger than it actually was. In the companion book, it was claimed that several large bone fragments from the Romualdo Formation of Brazil possibly indicate that &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot; may have had a wingspan reaching almost 12 metres and a weight of a hundred kilograms, making it one of the largest known pterosaurs. However, the largest definite &quot;Tropeognathus&quot; specimens described at the time measured , in terms of wingspan. The specimens which the producers of the program used to justify such a large size estimate were described in 2012 (with the designation MN 6594-V) and were under study by Dave Martill and David Unwin at the time of the production of the series. The final description of the remains found a maximum estimated wingspan of for this large specimen. Unwin stated that he did not believe the higher estimate used by the BBC was likely, and that the producers likely chose the highest possible estimate because it was more &quot;spectacular.&quot; Another famously &quot;super-sized&quot; animal in &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; is the pliosaur &quot;Liopleurodon&quot;, described as reaching lengths of 25 metres in the series (but in reality probably only reaching 6.4 metres); the extreme size was based on fragmentary specimens, and the estimate was at the time justifiable extrapolation provided by some of the consultants, who pushed it as scientifically supported.

=== Television and popular culture ===
&quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was recognised by several commentators as marking a watershed in television imagery and a scientifically and technologically significant benchmark in television history. &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; is often credited for inspiring modern interest in the distant geological past. Scientific papers have credited &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; as the two major productions inspiring increasing public interest in dinosaurs and other Mesozoic life in the 1990s and 2000s. The success of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; led to the inception of an entirely new genre of documentaries that like &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; also recreated past life with computer graphics and were envisioned in the style of nature documentaries.

=== Sequel series ===
The success of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; led to the creation of an entire nature documentary media franchise on prehistoric life, commonly referred to as the &quot;Walking with...&quot; series. The first sequel series to &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was &quot;Walking with Beasts&quot; (2001), made by largely the same production team (now organised as the production company Impossible Pictures) and focusing on life in the Cenozoic, after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. Next was &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; (2003), which was created without Haines and Impossible Pictures and focused on human evolution. The last series to be made was &quot;Walking with Monsters&quot; (2005), once again involving much of the original team and focused on life in the Paleozoic, before the time of the dinosaurs. During the production of &quot;Walking with Monsters&quot;, the production team considered the series to complete the &quot;Trilogy of Life&quot;, previously began with &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; and continued with &quot;Beasts&quot;.

The success of the two special episodes &quot;The Giant Claw&quot; and &quot;Land of Giants&quot; led to the creation of the three-part miniseries &quot;Sea Monsters&quot; (2003), once again starring Marven traveling back to prehistoric times, this time exploring the &quot;seven deadliest seas of all time&quot;.

=== Reboot ===
On June 4, 2024, it was announced that a reboot of the series would be produced by BBC, along with PBS, ZDF and France Télévisions, which will be released in 2025.

<doc id="1195815" wikidata="Q310846" url="?curid=1195815" title="Homo antecessor">
<text>Homo antecessor (Latin &quot;pioneer man&quot;) is an extinct species of archaic human recorded in the Spanish Sierra de Atapuerca, a productive archaeological site, from 1.2 to 0.8 million years ago during the Early Pleistocene. Populations of this species may have been present elsewhere in Western Europe, and were among the first to settle that region of the world, hence the name. The first fossils were found in the Gran Dolina cave in 1994, and the species was formally described in 1997 as the last common ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthals, supplanting the more conventional &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; in this position. &quot;H. antecessor&quot; has since been reinterpreted as an offshoot from the modern human line, although probably one branching off just before the modern human/Neanderthal split.

Despite being so ancient, the face is unexpectedly similar to that of modern humans rather than other archaic humans—namely in its overall flatness as well as the curving of the cheekbone as it merges into the upper jaw—although these elements are known only from a juvenile specimen. Brain volume could have been or more, but no intact braincase has been discovered. This is within the range of variation for modern humans. Stature estimates range from . &quot;H. antecessor&quot; may have been broad-chested and rather heavy, much like Neanderthals, although the limbs were proportionally long, a trait more frequent in tropical populations. The kneecaps are thin and have poorly developed tendon attachments. The feet indicate &quot;H. antecessor&quot; walked differently than modern humans.

&quot;H. antecessor&quot; was predominantly manufacturing simple pebble and flake stone tools out of quartz and chert, although they used a variety of materials. This industry has some similarities with the more complex Acheulean, an industry which is characteristic of contemporary African and later European sites. Groups may have been dispatching hunting parties, which mainly targeted deer in their savannah and mixed woodland environment. Many of the &quot;H. antecessor&quot; specimens were cannibalised, perhaps as a cultural practice. There is no evidence they were using fire, and they similarly only inhabited inland Iberia during warm periods, presumably retreating to the coast otherwise.

===Research history===

The Sierra de Atapuerca in northern Spain had long been known to be abundant in fossil remains. The Gran Dolina (&quot;great sinkhole&quot;) was first explored for fossils by archaeologist in a short field trip to the region in 1966, where he recovered a few animal fossils and stone tools. He lacked the resources and manpower to continue any further. In 1976, Spanish palaeontologist Trinidad Torres investigated the Gran Dolina for bear fossils (he recovered &quot;Ursus&quot; remains), but was advised by the Edelweiss Speleological Club to continue at the nearby Sima de los Huesos (&quot;bone pit&quot;). Here, in addition to a wealth of bear fossils, he also recovered archaic human fossils, which prompted a massive exploration of the Sierra de Atapuerca, at first headed by Spanish palaeontologist Emiliano Aguirre but quickly taken over by José María Bermúdez de Castro, Eudald Carbonell, and Juan Luis Arsuaga. They restarted excavation of the Gran Dolina in 1992, and found archaic human remains two years later; in 1997, they formally described these as a new species, &quot;Homo antecessor&quot;. The holotype is specimen ATD6-5, a right mandibular fragment retaining the molars and recovered with some isolated teeth. In their original description Castro and colleagues posited that the species was the first human to colonise Europe, hence the name &quot;antecessor&quot; (Latin for &quot;explorer&quot;, &quot;pioneer&quot;, or &quot;early settler&quot;).

The of Pleistocene sediments at the Gran Dolina are divided into eleven units, TD1 to TD11 (&quot;trinchera dolina&quot; or &quot;sinkhole trench&quot;). &quot;H. antecessor&quot; was recovered from TD6, which has consequently become the most well-researched unit of the site. In the first field seasons from 1994 to 1995, the dig team excavated a small test pit (to see if the unit warranted further investigation) in the southeast section measuring . Human fossils were discovered first by Aurora Martín Nájera; the layer they were found in is nicknamed the &quot;Aurora Stratum&quot; after her. A triangular section was excavated in the central section starting in the early 2000s. Human fossils were also found in the northern section. In sum, about 170 &quot;H. antecessor&quot; specimens were recovered. The best preserved are ATD6-15 and ATD6-69 (possibly belonging to the same individual) that most clearly elucidate facial anatomy. Subsequent field seasons have yielded about sixty more specimens. The discovered parts of the &quot;H. antecessor&quot; skeleton are: elements of the face, clavicle, forearm, digits, knees, and a few vertebrae and ribs.
In 2007, a mandibular fragment with some teeth, ATE9-1, provisionally assigned to &quot;H. antecessor&quot; by Carbonell, was recovered from the nearby Sima del Elefante (&quot;elephant pit&quot;) in unit TE9 (&quot;trinchera elefante&quot;), belonging to a 20– to 25-year-old individual. The site additionally yielded stone flakes and evidence of butchery. In 2011, after providing a much more in depth analysis of the Sima del Elefante material, Castro and colleagues were unsure of the species classification, opting to leave it at &quot;Homo&quot; sp. (making no opinion on species designation) pending further discoveries.

The stone tool assemblage at the Gran Dolina is broadly similar to several other contemporary ones across Western Europe, which may represent the work of the same species, although this is unconfirmable because many of these sites have not produced human fossils. In 2014 fifty footprints dating to between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago were discovered in Happisburgh, England, which could potentially be attributed to an &quot;H. antecessor&quot; group given it is the only human species identified during that time in Western Europe.

===Classification===
The face of &quot;H. antecessor&quot; is unexpectedly similar to that of modern humans compared to other archaic groups, so in their original description, Castro and colleagues classified it as the last common ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthals, supplanting &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; in this capacity. The facial anatomy came under close scrutiny in subsequent years.

In 2001 French palaeoanthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin postulated that the Gran Dolina remains and the contemporaneous Tighennif remains from Algeria (usually classified as &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; [=? &quot;Homo erectus&quot;], originally &quot;&quot;Atlantanthropus mauritanicus&quot;) represent the same population, because fourteen of the fifteen dental features Castro and colleagues listed for &quot;H. antecessor&quot; have also been identified in the Middle Pleistocene of North Africa; this would mean &quot;H. antecessor&quot; is a junior synonym of &quot;Homo mauritanicus&quot;, i. e., the Gran Dolina and Tighennif humans should be classified into the latter. In 2007 Castro and colleagues studied the fossils, and found the Tighennif remains to be much larger than &quot;H. antecessor&quot; and dentally similar to other African populations. Nonetheless, they still recommended reviving &quot;mauritanicus&quot; to house all Early Pleistocene North African specimens as &quot;H. ergaster mauritanicus&quot;&quot;.

In 2007 primatologist Esteban Sarmiento and colleagues questioned the legitimacy of &quot;H. antecessor&quot; as a separate species because much of the skull anatomy is unknown; &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; is known from roughly the same time and region; and because the type specimen was a child (the supposedly characteristic features could have disappeared with maturity.) Such restructuring of the face, they argued, can also be caused by regional climatic adaptation rather than speciation. In 2009 American palaeoanthropologist Richard Klein stated he was skeptical that &quot;H. antecessor&quot; was ancestral to &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;, interpreting &quot;H. antecessor&quot; as &quot;an offshoot of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; [from Africa] that disappeared after a failed attempt to colonize southern Europe&quot;. Similarly, in 2012, British physical anthropologist Chris Stringer considered &quot;H. antecessor&quot; and &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; to be two different lineages rather than them having an ancestor/descendant relationship. In 2013, anthropologist Sarah Freidline and colleagues suggested the modern humanlike face evolved independently several times among &quot;Homo&quot;. In 2017 Castro and colleagues conceded that &quot;H. antecessor&quot; may or may not be a modern human ancestor, although if it was not then it probably split quite shortly before the modern human/Neanderthal split. In 2020 Dutch molecular palaeoanthropologist Frido Welker and colleagues concluded &quot;H. antecessor&quot; is not a modern human ancestor by analysing ancient proteins collected from the tooth ATD6-92.

===Age and taphonomy===

The 2003 to 2007 excavations revealed a much more intricate stratigraphy than previously thought, and TD6 was divided into three subunits spanning thirteen layers and nine sedimentary facies (bodies of rock distinctive from adjacent bodies). Human presence is recorded in subunits 1and 2, and in facies A, D1, and F. Randomly orientated scattered bones were deposited in Facies D1 of layer TD6.2.2 (TD6 subunit 2, layer 2) and Facies F of layers TD6.2.2 and TD6.2.3, but in Facies D they seem to have been conspicuously clumped into the northwest area. This might indicate they were dragged into the cave via a debris flow. As for Facies F, which contains the most human remains, they may have been deposited by a low energy debris flow (consistent with floodplain behaviour) from the main entrance to the northwest, as well as a stronger debris flow from another entrance to the south. Fluvially deposited fossils (dragged in by a stream of water) were also recovered from Facies A in layers TD6.2.2, TD6.2.1 and TD6.1.2, indicated by limestone gravel within the size range of the remains. Thus, &quot;H. antecessor&quot; may not have inhabited the cave, although was at least active nearby. Only 5.6% of the fossils bear any evidence of weathering from open air, roots, and soil, which could mean they were deposited deep into the cave relatively soon after death.

Human occupation seems to have occurred in waves corresponding to timespans featuring a warm, humid savannah habitat (although riversides likely supported woodlands). These conditions were only present during transitions from cool glacial to warm interglacial periods, after the climate warmed and before the forests could expand to dominate the landscape. The dating attempts of &quot;H. antecessor&quot; remains are:
*In 1999 two ungulate teeth from TD6 were dated using uranium–thorium dating to 794 to 668 thousand years ago, and further constrained palaeomagnetically to over 780,000 years ago.
*In 2008 TE9 of the Sima del Elefante was constrained to 1.2–1.1 million years ago using palaeomagnetism and cosmogenic dating.
*In 2013 TD6 was dated to about 930 to 780 thousand years ago using palaeomagnetism, in addition to uranium–thorium and electron spin resonance dating (ESR) on more teeth.
*In 2018 ESR dating of the &quot;H. antecessor&quot; specimen ATD6-92 resulted in an age of 949 to 624 thousand years ago, further constrained palaeomagnetically to before 772,000 years ago.
*In 2022 ESR and single grain thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (SG TT-OSL) dated the opening of the Gran Dolina to roughly 900,000 years ago, and the sediments from TD4 to TD6 to between 890,000 and 770,000 years ago. These three units were probably deposited within a period of less than 100,000 years.

Until 2013 with the discovery of the 1.4-million-year-old infant tooth from Barranco León, Orce, Spain, these were the oldest human fossils known from Europe, although human activity on the continent stretches back as early as 1.6 million years ago in Eastern Europe and Spain indicated by stone tools.

==Anatomy==
===Skull===
The facial anatomy of &quot;H. antecessor&quot; is predominantly known from the 10–11.5-year-old &quot;H. antecessor&quot; child ATD6-69, as the few other facial specimens are fragmentary. ATD6-69 is strikingly similar to modern humans (as well as East Asian Middle Pleistocene archaic humans) as opposed to West Eurasian or African Middle Pleistocene archaic humans including Neanderthals. The most notable traits are a completely flat face and a curved zygomaticoalveolar crest (the bar of bone connecting the cheek to the part of the maxilla that holds the teeth). In 2013 anthropologist Sarah Freidline and colleagues statistically determined that these features would not disappear with maturity. &quot;H. antecessor&quot; suggests the modern human face evolved and disappeared multiple times in the past, which is not unlikely as facial anatomy is strongly influenced by diet and thus the environment. The nasal bones are like those of modern humans. The mandible (lower jaw) is quite gracile unlike most other archaic humans. It exhibits several archaic features, but the shape of the mandibular notch is modern humanlike, and the alveolar part (adjacent to the teeth) is completely vertical as in modern humans. Like many Neanderthals, the medial pterygoid tubercle is large. Unlike most Neanderthals, there is no retromolar space (a large gap between the last molar and the end of the body of the mandible).

The upper incisors are shovel-shaped (the lingual, or tongue, side is distinctly concave), a feature characteristic of other Eurasian human populations, including modern. The canines bear the cingulum (a protuberance toward the base) and the essential ridge (toward the midline) like more derived species, but retain the cuspules (small bumps) near the tip and bordering incisor like more archaic species. Compared to later hominins, the lower canines of H. antecessor bear fewer perikymata. The upper premolar crowns are rather derived, being nearly symmetrical and bearing a lingual cusp (on the tongue side), and a cingulum and longitudinal grooves on the cheekward side. The upper molars feature several traits typically seen in Neanderthals. The mandibular teeth, on the other hand, are quite archaic. The P3 (the first lower premolar) has a strongly asymmetrical crown and complex tooth root system. P3 is smaller than P4 like in more derived species, but like other early &quot;Homo&quot;, M1 (the first lower molar) is smaller than M2 and the cusps of the molar crowns make a Y shape. The distribution of enamel is Neanderthal-like, with thicker layers at the periphery than at the cusps. Based on two canine teeth (ATD6- 69 and ATD6-13), the thickness of the enamel and the proportion of the tooth covered by the gums vary to the same degree as for males and females of modern humans and many other apes, so this may be due to sexual dimorphism, with females having smaller teeth, relatively thicker enamel, and smaller proportion of gum coverage.

The parietal bones (each being one side of the back part of the top of the skull) are flattened, and conjoin at a peak at the midline. This &quot;tent-like&quot; profile is also exhibited in more archaic African &quot;H. ergaster&quot; and Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Like &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, the temporal styloid process just below the ear is fused to the base of the skull. The brow ridges are prominent. The upper margin of the squamous part of temporal bones (on the side of the skull) is convex, like in more derived species. The brain volume of ATD6-15, perhaps belonging to an 11-year-old, may have been or more based on frontal bone measurements. This is within the range of variation for modern humans.

===Torso===
The notably large adult clavicle specimen ATD6-50, assumed male based on absolute size, was estimated to have stood , mean of , based on the correlation among modern Indian people between clavicle length and stature. An adult radius (a forearm bone), ATD6-43, which could be male based on absolute size or female based on gracility, was estimated to have belonged to a tall individual based on the average of equations among several modern populations relating radial length to stature. Based on metatarsal (foot bone) length, a male is estimated to have stood and a female . These are all rather similar values. For comparison, Western European Neanderthal estimates average , and early European modern humans . The ankle joint is adapted for handling high stress, which may indicate a heavy, robust body plan, much like Neanderthals. Based on the relationship between human footprint length and body size, twelve Happisburgh prints that are preserved well enough to measure are consistent with individuals ranging from in stature, which may mean some of the trackmakers were children. By this logic, the three biggest footprints—equating to statures of , , and —ranged from in weight. Stature estimates for &quot;H. antecessor&quot;, &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;, and Neanderthals are roughly consistent with each other.
Two atlases (the first neck vertebra) are known, which is exceptional as this bone is rarely discovered for archaic humans. They are indistinguishable from those of modern humans. For the axis (the second neck vertebra), the angle of the spinous process (jutting out from the vertebra) is about 19 degrees, comparable with Neanderthals and modern humans, diverging from &quot;H. ergaster&quot; with a low angle of about 8°. The vertebral foramen (that houses the spinal cord) is on the narrow side compared to modern humans. The spine as a whole otherwise aligns with modern humans.

There is one known (and incomplete) clavicle, ATD6-50, which is thick compared to those of modern humans. This may indicate &quot;H. antecessor&quot; had long and flattish (platycleidic) clavicles like other archaic humans. This would point to a broad chest. The proximal curvature (twisting of the bone on the side nearest the neck) in front view is on par with that of Neanderthals, but the distal curvature (on the shoulder side) is much more pronounced. The sternum is narrow. The acromion (that extends over the shoulder joint) is small compared to those of modern humans. The shoulder blade is similar to all &quot;Homo&quot; with a typical human body plan, indicating &quot;H. antecessor&quot; was not as skilled a climber as non-human apes or pre-&quot;erectus&quot; species, but was capable of efficiently launching projectiles such as stones or spears.

===Limbs===
The incomplete radius, ATD6-43, was estimated to have measured . It is oddly long and straight for someone from so far north, reminiscent of the proportions seen in early modern humans and many people from tropical populations. This could be explained as retention of the ancestral long limbed tropical form, as opposed to Neanderthals who evolved shorter limbs. This could also indicate a high brachial index (radial to humeral length ratio). Compared to more recent human species, the cross section of the radial shaft is rather round and gracile throughout its length. Like archaic humans, the radial neck (near the elbow) is long, giving more leverage to the biceps brachii. Like modern humans and &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;, but unlike Neanderthals and more archaic hominins, the radial tuberosity (a bony knob jutting out just below the radial neck) is anteriorly placed (toward the front side when the arm is facing out).

Like those of other archaic humans, the femur features a developed trochanteric fossa and posterior crest. These traits are highly variable among modern human populations. The two known kneecaps, ATD6-22 and ATD6-56, are subrectangular in shape as opposed to the more common subtriangular, although rather narrow like those of modern humans. They are quite small and thin, falling at the lower end for modern human females. The apex of the kneecap (the area that does not join to another bone) is not well developed, leaving little attachment for the patellar tendon. The medial (toward the midline) facet and lateral (toward the sides) facet for the knee joint are roughly the same size as each other in ATD6-56 and the medial is larger in ATD6-22, whereas the lateral is commonly larger in modern humans. The lateral facet encroaches onto a straight flat area as opposed to being limited to a defined vastus notch, an infrequent condition among any human species.

The phalanges and metatarsals of the foot are comparable to those of later humans, but the big toe bone is rather robust, which could be related to how &quot;H. antecessor&quot; pushed off the ground. The ankle bone (talus) is exceptionally long and high as well as the facet where it connects with the leg (the trochlea), which may be related to how &quot;H. antecessor&quot; walked. The long trochlea caused a short neck of the talus, which bridges the head of the talus connecting to the toes, and the body of the talus connecting to the leg. This somewhat converges with the condition exhibited in Neanderthals, which is generally explained as a response to a heavy and robust body, to alleviate the consequently higher stress to the articular cartilage in the ankle joint. This would also have permitted greater flexion.

===Growth rate===
In 2010 Castro and colleagues estimated that ATD6-112, represented by a permanent upper and lower first molar, died between 5.3 and 6.6 years of age based on the tooth formation rates in chimpanzees (lower estimate) and modern humans (upper). The molars are hardly worn at all, which means the individual died soon after the tooth erupted, and that first molar eruption occurred at roughly this age. The age is within the range of variation of modern humans, and this developmental landmark can debatably be correlated with life history. If the relation is true, &quot;H. antecessor&quot; had a prolonged childhood, a characteristic of modern humans in which significant cognitive development takes place.

===Pathology===
The partial face ATD6-69 has an ectopic M3 (upper left third molar), where it erupted improperly, and this caused the impaction of M2, where it was blocked from erupting at all. Although impaction of M3 is rather common in modern humans, as high as fifty percent in some populations, impaction of M2 is rare, as little as 0.08 to 2.3%. Impaction can lead to secondary lesions, such as dental cavities, root resorption, keratocysts and dentigerous cysts.

The mandible ATE9-1 exhibits severe dental attrition and abrasion of the tooth crowns and bone resorption at the root, so much so that the root canals (the sensitive interior) of the canines are exposed. The trauma is consistent with gum disease due to overloading the teeth, such as by using the mouth as a third hand to carry around items. A similar condition was also reported for the later Sima de los Huesos remains also at the Sierra de Atapuerca site.

The left knee bone ATD6-56 has a height x breadth osteophyte (bone spur) on the inferior (lower) margin. Osteophytes normally form as a response to stress due to osteoarthritis, which can result from old age or improper loading of the joint as a consequence of bone misalignment or ligament laxity. In the case of ATD6-56, improper loading was likely the causal factor. Frequent squatting and kneeling can lead to this condition, but if the right knee bone ATD6-22 (that has no such trauma) belongs to the same individual, then this is unlikely to be the reason. If so, the lesion was caused by a local trauma, such as strain on the soft tissue around the joint due to high intensity activity, or a fracture of the left femur and/or tibia (that is unconfirmable since neither bone is associated with this individual).

The right fourth metatarsal ATD6-124 has a length x width lesion on the medial (toward the midline of the bone) side consistent with a march fracture. This condition is most often encountered by soldiers, long-distance runners, and potentially flatfooted people whose foot bones failed under repeated, high intensity activity. Later Neanderthals would evolve a much more robust lower skeleton possibly to withstand such taxing movement across uneven terrain. Although only one other example of the condition has been identified (at Sima de los Huesos) among archaic humans, march fractures were probably a common injury for them given that the healed fracture leaves no visible mark, as well as their presumed high intensity lifestyle.

==Culture==
===Technology===
&quot;H. antecessor&quot; was producing simple stone tools at Gran Dolina. This industry is found elsewhere in Early Pleistocene Spain—notably in Barranc de la Boella and the nearby Galería—distinguished by the preparation and sharpening of cores before flaking, the presence of (crude) bifaces, and some degree of standardisation of tool types. This bears some resemblance to the much more complex Acheulean industry, characteristic of African and later European sites. The earliest evidence of typical Acheulean toolsets comes from Africa 1.75 million years ago, but the typical Acheulean toolset pops up in Western Europe nearly a million years later. It is debated if these early European sites evolved into the European Acheulean industry independently from African counterparts, or if the Acheulean was brought up from Africa and diffused across Europe. In 2020 French anthropologist Marie-Hélène Moncel argued the appearance of typical Acheulean bifaces 700,000 years ago in Europe was too sudden to be the result of completely independent evolution from local technologies, so there must have been influence from Africa. Wearing on the TD6 stone tools is consistent with repeated abrasion against flesh, so they were probably used as butchering implements.

====TD6.3====
In the lower part of TD6.3 (TD6 subunit 3), 84 stone tools were recovered, predominantly small, unmodified quartzite pebbles with percussive damage—probably inflicted from pounding items such as bone—as opposed to manufacturing more specialised implements.

Although 41% of the section&#x27;s assemblage consists of flakes, they are rather crude and large—averaging —either resulting from rudimentary knapping (stoneworking) skills or difficulty working such poor quality materials. They made use of the unipolar longitudinal method, flaking off only one side of a core, probably to compensate for the lack of preplanning, opting to knap irregularly shaped and thus poorer quality pebbles.

====TD6.2====
Most of the stone tools resided in the lower (older) half of TD6.2, with 831 stone tools. The knappers made use of a much more diverse array of materials (although most commonly chert), which indicates they were moving farther out in search of better raw materials. The Sierra de Atapuerca features an abundance and diversity of mineral outcroppings suitable for stone tool manufacturing, in addition to chert and quartz namely quartzite, sandstone, and limestone, which could all be collected within only of the Gran Dolina.

They produced far fewer pebbles and spent more time knapping off flakes, but they were not particularly economic with their materials, and about half of the cores could have produced more flakes. They additionally modified irregular blanks into more workable shapes before flaking off pieces. This preplanning allowed them to use other techniques: the centripetal method (flaking off only the edges of the core) and the bipolar method (laying the core on an anvil and slamming it with a hammerstone). There are 62 flakes measuring below in height, and 28 above . There are three conspicuously higher quality flakes, thinner and longer than the others, which may have been produced by the same person. There are also retouched tools: notches, spines, denticulates, points, scrapers, and a single chopper. These small retouched tools are rare in the European Early Pleistocene.

====TD6.1====
TD6.1 yielded 124 stone tools, but they are badly preserved as the area was also used by hyenas as a latrine, the urine corroding the area. The layer lacks pebbles and cores, and 44 of the stone tools are indeterminate. Flakes are much smaller with an average of , with ten measuring below , and only three exceeding .

They seem to have been using the same methods as the people who manufactured the TD6.2 tools. They were only retouching larger flakes, the fourteen such tools averaging : one marginally retouched flake, one notch, three spines, seven denticulate sidescrapers, and one denticulate point.

===Fire and palaeoclimate===
Only a few charcoal particles have been collected from TD6, which probably originated from a fire well outside the cave. There is no evidence of any fire use or burnt bones (cooking) in the occupation sequences of the Gran Dolina. In other parts of the world, reliable evidence of fire usage does not surface in the archaeological record until roughly 400,000 years ago. In 2016, small mammal bones burned in fires exceeding were identified from 780- to 980-thousand-year-old deposits at in southern Spain, which potentially could have come from a human source as such a high temperature is usually (though not always) recorded in campfires as opposed to natural bushfires.
Instead of using fire, these early Europeans probably physiologically withstood the cold, such as by eating a high protein diet to support a heightened metabolism. Despite glacial cycles, the climate was probably similar or a few degrees warmer compared to that of today&#x27;s, with the coldest average temperature reaching sometime in December and January, and the hottest in July and August . Freezing temperatures could have been reached from November to March, but the presence of olive and oak suggests subfreezing was an infrequent occurrence. TE9 similarly indicates a generally warm climate. The Happisburgh footprints were lain in estuarine mudflats with open forests dominated by pine, spruce, birch, and in wetter areas alder, with patches of heath and grasslands; the vegetation is consistent with the cooler beginning or end of an interglacial.

&quot;H. antecessor&quot; probably migrated from the Mediterranean shore into inland Iberia when colder glacial periods were transitioning to warmer interglacials, and warm grasslands dominated, vacating the region at any other time. They may have followed water bodies while migrating, in the case of Sierra de Atapuerca, most likely the Ebro River.

===Food===
The fossils of sixteen animal species were recovered randomly mixed with the &quot;H. antecessor&quot; material at the Gran Dolina, including the extinct bush-antlered deer, the extinct species of fallow deer &quot;Dama vallonetensi&quot;, the extinct subspecies of red deer &quot;Cervus elaphus acoronatus&quot;, the extinct bison &quot;Bison voigstedtensi&quot;, the extinct rhino &quot;Stephanorhinus etruscus&quot;, the extinct horse &quot;Equus stenonis&quot;, the extinct fox &quot;Vulpes praeglacialis&quot;, the extinct bear &quot;Ursus dolinensis&quot;, the extinct wolf &quot;Canis mosbachensis&quot;, the spotted hyena, the wild boar, and undetermined species of mammoth, monkey, and lynx. Some specimens of the former eight species and the monkey exhibit cut marks consistent with butchery, with about 13% of all Gran Dolina remains bearing some evidence of human modification. Deer are the most commonly butchered animal, with 106 specimens. The inhabitants seem to have carried carcasses back whole when feasible, and only the limbs and skulls of larger quarries. This indicates the Gran Dolina &quot;H. antecessor&quot; were dispatching hunting parties who killed and hauled back prey to share with the entire group rather than each individual foraging entirely for themselves, which evinces social cooperation and division of labour. Less than 5% of all the remains retain animal carnivore damage, in two instances toothmarks overlapping cutmarks from an unidentified animal, which could indicate animals were sometimes scavenging &quot;H. antecessor&quot; leftovers.
The Sima del Elefante site records the fallow deer, the bush-antlered deer, rhinos, &quot;E. stenonis&quot;, &quot;C. mosbachensis&quot;, &quot;U. dolinensis&quot;, the extinct big cat &quot;Panthera gombaszoegensis&quot;, the extinct lynx &quot;Lynx issiodorensis&quot;, the extinct fox &quot;Vulpes alopecoides&quot;, several rats, shrews, and rabbits, and undetermined species of macaques, boar, bison, and beaver. The large mammals are most commonly represented by long bones, a few of which are cracked open, presumably to access the bone marrow. Some others bear evidence of percussion and defleshing. They were also butchering Hermann&#x27;s tortoise, an easily obtainable source of meat considering how slowly tortoises move.

The cool and humid montane environment encouraged the growth of olive, mastic, beech, hazelnut, and chestnut trees, which &quot;H. antecessor&quot; may have used as food sources, although they become more common in TD7 and TD8 as the interglacial progresses and the environment becomes wetter. In the &quot;H. antecessor&quot; unit TD6, pollen predominantly derives from juniper and oak. Trees probably grew along rivers and streams, while the rest of the hills and ridges were dominated by grasses. The TD6 individuals also seem to have been consuming hackberries, which in historical times have been used for their medicinal properties more than satiating hunger because these berries provide very little flesh.

There is no evidence &quot;H. antecessor&quot; could wield fire and cook, and similarly the wearing on the molars indicates the more frequent consumption of grittier and more mechanically challenging foods than later European species, such as raw rather than cooked meat and underground storage organs.

===Cannibalism===
Eighty young adult and child &quot;H. antecessor&quot; specimens from the Gran Dolina exhibit cut marks and fracturing indicative of cannibalism, and &quot;H. antecessor&quot; is the second-most common species bearing evidence of butchering. Human bodies were efficiently utilised, and may be the reason why most bones are smashed or otherwise badly damaged. There are no complete skulls, elements from the face and back of the skull are usually percussed, and the muscle attachments on the face and the base of the skull were cut off. The intense modification of the face was probably to access the brain. The crown of the head was probably struck, resulting in the impact scars on the teeth at the gum line. Several skull fragments exhibit peeling.

The ribs also bear cut marks along the muscle attachments consistent with defleshing, and ATD6-39 has cuts along the length of the rib, which may be related to disembowelment. The nape muscles were sliced off, and the head and neck were probably detached from the body. The vertebrae were often cut, peeled, and percussed. The muscles on all of the clavicles were sawed off to disconnect the shoulder. One radius, ATD6-43, was cut up and peeled. The femur was shattered, probably to extract the bone marrow. The hands and feet variably exhibit percussion, cutting, or peeling, likely a result of dismemberment.

In sum, mainly the meatier areas were prepared, and the rest discarded. This suggests they were butchering humans for nutritional purposes, but the face generally exhibits significantly more cutmarks than the faces of animals. When this is seen in prehistoric modern human specimens, it is typically interpreted as evidence of exocannibalism, a form of ritual cannibalism where one eats someone from beyond their social group, such as an enemy from a neighbouring tribe. But, when overviewing the evidence of &quot;H. antecessor&quot; cannibalism in 1999, Spanish palaeontologist Yolanda Fernandez-Jalvo and colleagues instead ascribed the relative abundance of facial cut marks in the &quot;H. antecessor&quot; sample to the strongly contrasting structure of the muscle attachments between humans and typical animal prey items (that is, defleshing the human face simply required more cuts, or the butcherers were less familiar with defleshing humans).

Nonetheless, the assemblage had a lack of older individuals, and was composed entirely of young adults and juveniles. In 2010 Carbonell hypothesised that they were practising exocannibalism and hunting down neighbouring tribesmen. While not rejecting this hypothesis, Spanish palaeoanthropologist Jesús Rodríguez and colleagues suggested as an alternative explanation that the eaten people may have been fellow tribesmen who had died of unrelated reasons (such as natural causes, war, or accidents), eaten in funerary rites or possibly simply to avoid wasting food. They consider this explanation as better fitting the demographic distribution of the eaten due to the high youth mortality rates in hunter-gatherer groups, while also granting that the high number of young individuals among the eaten may have been due to a &quot;low-risk hunting strategy&quot; (juveniles of foreign groups were easier to catch and kill) or a &quot;deliberate cultural strategy aimed to defend the territory and eliminate competitors&quot; by targeting their offspring.

<text>An electoral wipeout occurs when a major party wins no seats in an election - &quot;wiped out&quot; means no one left, from that party, in the body that has had an election. It is the opposite of a landslide victory; the two frequently go hand in hand.

A use of the phrase generally assumes that the returns were the product of a legitimate election; show elections to fraudulent legislatures regularly produce incredibly strong majorities for the ruling party (or parties).

== Australia ==
=== Federal elections ===
Between 1901 and 1949, the federal upper house, the Australian Senate, was elected by a system of majoritarian or &quot;winner-take-all&quot; voting. Each state had three of its six Senators retiring at each half-senate election. Each voter had three votes at each election, whether by first-past-the-post (FPTP) 1901–1918, or the alternative vote. It was often the case that the three seats all went the same way, leading to lopsided results in the six states such as or 

In 1948, the Single Transferable Vote (STV) was introduced. At the same time, the number of senators per state was increased from 6 to 10, with 5 instead of 3 retiring at each triennial election.

Since the introduction of STV in the Senate, the parties have generally been evenly balanced, with minor parties and independents holding the balance of power.

In the 2004 election, the Howard government reached 57% of the senate vote in Queensland after the distribution of preferences under the then-used Group Ticket Voting system. It thereby obtained a majority in its own right in the senate from July 2005, when the new senators took up their seats. The number of quotas required to win a majority (four) of six seats, at 57% (four-sevenths of the votes), is so high because there are an even number of seats.

In the lower house, FPTP was changed to preferential voting in 1918.

=== State and territory elections ===
* At the 1974 Queensland state election, using single-member electorates and full-preferential voting, the Labor opposition was reduced to a &quot;cricket team&quot; of eleven MPs, against the National Country Party/ Liberal Party Coalition government with 69 seats (and 2 independents). Labor recorded an even worse result in the 2012 Queensland state election when it lost office and was reduced to seven seats, with the Liberal National Party of Queensland winning 78, the Katter&#x27;s Australian Party winning 2 and 2 independents.
* At the 2016 Northern Territory general election, the one-term incumbent Country Liberal government, led by Adam Giles (who replaced Terry Mills), was defeated by the Labor opposition, led by Michael Gunner. The CLP lost all but two seats. Although it was outnumbered by independents (and later on by the new Territory Alliance party due to defections), the CLP remained the official opposition and regained several seats at the next election.
* At the 2021 Western Australian state election, the WA Liberal opposition was reduced to only two seats against Labor&#x27;s 53. This made them one of the only instances of one of the major parties having less seats than a third party (the Nationals received 4 seats in the election). This election had already been conceded by the Liberal leader Zak Kirkup before election day, but even Kirkup lost his seat, making him the first major party leader in 88 years in Western Australia to do so.

== Barbados ==
* In the 2018 Barbadian general election, the governing Democratic Labour Party was reduced from a majority of 16 seats to 0 seats, with the opposition (Barbados Labour Party) picking up all of the DLP&#x27;s seats to have a 30–0 majority. Under first past the post, the DLP had received only 33,985 votes, out of 154,193, compared to the BLP&#x27;s 111,968 votes. The DLP later on then failed to gain a single seat in the 2022 Barbadian general election leading to another BLP landslide of 30-0.

== Canada ==
Canadian politics has seen electoral wipeouts at both provincial and federal level.

* Alberta has seen electoral wipeouts in which political dynasties would never regain power after their defeat: the 1935 election resulted in the incumbent United Farmers of Alberta losing all of its 36 seats to the Alberta Social Credit Party. The Alberta Social Credit Party would lose to the formerly moribund Progressive Conservatives in the 1971 election, dropping from 55 seats to 25 seats. The Progressive Conservatives would fall after 44 years to the Alberta New Democratic Party dropping from 70 seats to 9. The 2015 election would be the final election the Progressive Conservatives contested as a party before merging with the Wildrose Party to form the United Conservatives in its first leadership election in 2017.
* Saskatchewan has witnessed electoral wipeouts on four separate occasions: the 1934 election resulted in the incumbent Conservatives lose all of their seats; the 1944 election saw the governing Liberals reduced to 5 seats from 38; the 1982 election resulted in the incumbent NDP losing 35 of their 44 seats; and in 1991 the Conservatives were ousted with a 28-seat drop to 10 seats.
* The 1935 Prince Edward Island general election resulted in the incumbent Conservatives lose all 18 of their seats to the Liberals, who won every seat in the legislature. 
* The 1987 New Brunswick general election saw the ruling Progressive Conservatives lose all 39 of their seats, with the Liberal Party winning every seat in the legislature.
* In the 1987 Ontario general election, 42 years of Progressive Conservative rule ended as the party lost 36 of its 52 seats and fell to third place.
* In the 1993 Canadian federal election, the governing Progressive Conservative Party, which had been in office for nearly a decade, was reduced from an overall majority of 156 seats to only two and suffered an almost 27% drop in their vote. The Progressive Conservatives never recovered from the loss and, ten years later, merged with the Canadian Alliance into the Conservative Party of Canada.
* In the 2011 Canadian federal election, the Bloc Québécois was reduced from 47 to 4 seats.
* In the 2001 British Columbia general election, the governing NDP was reduced from 37 to two seats, with the other 77 being won by the Liberals.
* In the 2018 Ontario general election, the Ontario Liberal Party lost 48 seats, falling from 58 in 2014 to 7 seats.

==Fiji==
* At the 1999 Fijian general election, the incumbent Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) government, led by Sitiveni Rabuka, was defeated by the Labour opposition, led by Mahendra Chaudhry. Labour won 37 seats (an increase of 30), the Fijian Association Party (FAP) won 10, SVT won eight, the Party of National Unity (PANU) won four, the Christian Democratic Alliance (VLV) won three, the Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party (NVTLP) won two the United General Party (UGP) won two and independents won five. The election resulted in Chaudhry became the country&#x27;s first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister.

==Germany==
The use of an electoral threshold in German elections means that sometimes a major party can fail to win seats in the Bundestag or a state parliament, either because their vote share falls below 5% or because the number of directly-elected seats drops below 3. Post-war examples include:

* 1957 West German federal election: The All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights lost all 27 seats.
* 2002 German federal election: The Party of Democratic Socialism went from 36 seats to just 2 (both directly-elected).
* 2013 German federal election: The Free Democratic Party lost all 93 seats.
* 2025 German federal election: The Free Democratic Party lost all 91 seats, with Christian Lindner resigning as party leader.

==India==

==Malaysia==

*In the 1990 Kelantan state election, the ruling Barisan Nasional state government went from 29 to 0 seats out of 39 in the Kelantan State Legislative Assembly and were ousted from power, thus made Malaysian Islamic Party became the state government continuously since then.

==New Zealand==
Until it moved to a proportional representation system in 1996, general elections in New Zealand were also prone to the possibility of wipeouts, though these in general involved the likelihood of third parties getting few or no seats rather than one of the two major parties being massively underrepresented. This former circumstance occurred most starkly in the 1981 general election, in which the Social Credit Party gained 20.6% of the vote yet gained only two seats in the 92-seat parliament.

The 1935 general election did, however, see a major party wipeout, and led to the creation of a new major party. In the 1935 election, the Labour Party gained 46.1% of the vote to the United/Reform Coalition&#x27;s 32.9%, but won 53 seats to the United/Reform&#x27;s 19. As a result of this election the two coalition parties merged to form the National Party, which remains a major force in New Zealand politics to the present day.

== Philippines ==
In the Philippines, the House of Representatives (and its predecessors) are, for the most part, elected under first-past-the-post (FPTP) system; in 1998, parallel voting was instituted, where 20% of the seats are contested in a party-list system, with the 80% of the seats still being elected via FPTP. The Senate since 1941 has been elected under multiple non-transferable vote. From 1941 to 1951, voters can vote under general ticket, which can lead to wipeouts for any party that wins the election. In 1978, this was also the electoral system for the Interim Batasang Pambansa (parliament).

*1949 Philippine Senate election: The Liberal Party won all 8 seats disputed in the election. The Nacionalista Party were almost wiped out, only retaining 4 seats.
*1951 Philippine Senate election: The Nacionalista Party won all 9 (8 seats in the general election and 1 seat in a special election held concurrently) seats disputed.
*1955 Philippine Senate election: The Nacionalista Party won all 9 (8 seats in the general election and 1 seat in a special election held concurrently) seats disputed. The Liberal Party were wiped out in the Senate.

*2019 Philippine Senate election: The Hugpong ng Pagbabago won 9 seats disputed in the election. The other 3 seats were won by other parties. The primary opposition, Otso Diretso, were wiped out.

== Poland ==
The chaotic emergence of a democratic political scene following the fall of communism and the often-changing electoral system caused many wipeouts in Polish electoral history:
*In the 1993 Polish parliamentary election, Centre Agreement, Liberal Democratic Congress, Peasants&#x27; Agreement, Solidarity, Polish Beer-Lovers&#x27; Party, Real Politics Union and Party X, which held a total of 158 seats, all failed to pass the newly introduced 5% electoral threshold, losing all seats.
*In the 1997 Polish parliamentary election, the Polish People&#x27;s Party which was part of the ruling coalition won 27 seats, down from 132 in the previous election, while Labour Union failed to pass electoral threshold and lost all 41 seats.
*In the 2001 Polish parliamentary election, the ruling Solidarity Electoral Action-Freedom Union coalition failed to enter parliament, losing all 261 seats. Solidarity Electoral Action dissolved soon after, while Freedom Union was succeeded by Democratic Party – demokraci.pl in 2005.
*In the 2005 Polish parliamentary election, the ruling Democratic Left Alliance won 55 seats, down from 216 in the previous election and lost all 70 seats in the Senate.
*In the 2007 Polish parliamentary election, Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland and League of Polish Families, both part of the ruling coalition, lost all 56 and 34 seats respectively. Both parties never appeared in the Sejm again.
*In the 2015 Polish parliamentary election, the United Left lost all 67 seats due to not passing the 8% threshold for electoral coalitions. The coalition reappeared in the Sejm in the 2019 election as The Left.
== Spain ==
*In the 1982 Spanish general election, ruling Union of the Democratic Centre went down from 168 to 11 seats, out of 350, and were ousted from government.
* In the April 2019 Spanish general election, the People&#x27;s Party went from holding 127 of the 208 directly elected senate seats to just 54, falling from a comfortable overall majority of 61% of seats to holding just over 27% of the total, despite the fact that the Spanish electoral system for the Senate all but guarantees at least one seat for the runner-up party in 47 of the 50 provinces. Meanwhile, in the Congress of Deputies, the PP lost all their seats in the Basque Country (down from 2) and were reduced to a single one in Catalonia (down from 5).
*In the November 2019 Spanish general election the Citizens party lost 47 of their 57 seats in Congress.

<text>Louis Antoine de Noailles, &quot;Cardinal de Noailles&quot; (27 May 16514 May 1729), second son of Anne de Noailles, 1st Duke of Noailles, was a French bishop and cardinal. His signing of the Unigenitus bull in 1728 would end the formal Jansenist controversy.

==Biography==
Louis-Antoine de Noailles was born at the Château of Teyssiére in Auvergne, France, on 27 May 1651 to Anne, 1st duc de Noailles and captain- general of Roussillon, and his wife, Louise Boyer, a former lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne of Austria.

Noailles received his doctorate in theology from the Sorbonne on 14 March 1676. He was appointed bishop of Cahors in March 1679 but served only briefly before Pope Innocent XI ordered him transferred in 1680 to head the diocese of Châlons-sur-Marne, which made him a peer of France. On 19 August 1695, in recognition of Noailles&#x27;s family connections, King Louis XIV made him archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud, and in 1700 Pope Innocent XII made him a cardinal.

According to Antoine Degert, writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia,&quot; although Noailles was not brilliant, &quot;he was possessed of piety, zeal, and activity.&quot; He is noted for having raised money to feed famine victims by selling his silver tableware in 1709, and for having spent a considerable part of his inheritance on redecorating Notre Dame.

Noailles was a friend of François Fénelon, with whom he had studied at the Collège du Plessis before entering the Sorbonne. Nonetheless, he was among the bishops who condemned Fénelon&#x27;s &quot;Maximes des Saints,&quot; ending the theologian&#x27;s career.

Noailles came to know the controversial young Lutheran Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf in 1719 during the young man&#x27;s Grand Tour. The two found great spiritual connection despite their historic denominational differences. They maintained a relationship and correspondence the rest of Noailles&#x27; life; and Noailles became a member of Zinzendorf&#x27;s Order of the Grain of Mustard Seed, a secret society where nobles and church leaders committed to work together to build the spiritual Kingdom of God. The Cardinal also served as Godfather to Zinzendorf&#x27;s son Christian Renatus (1727–1756).

Noailles acted as a staunch moralist when at the end of March 1719 he firmly stood behind the curé of Saint-Sulpice. who refused to administer the sacraments to the Regent&#x27;s daughter, Louise Élisabeth, Duchess of Berry, who was in a critical condition giving birth to an illegitimate child in the Palais de Luxembourg. Despite all the pleas of the Regent, Philip II, Duke of Orleans, Noailles refused categorically to overturn the decision of the parish priest.

Noailles had a complex relationship with the Jansenists; while he condemned their propositions, more orthodox theologians saw in his own teachings hints of Jansenism, and Noailles was an opponent of the Jesuits in their attacks on the sect. His position on Pope Clement XI&#x27;s 1713 bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot; was also controversial; he opposed it, despite papal disapproval, up to 1728 but then abruptly reversed himself shortly before his death.

He was succeeded as archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud by Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc.
