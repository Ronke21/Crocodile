<text>Rafael &quot;Raful&quot; Eitan (; 11 January 1929 – 23 November 2004) was an Israeli general, former Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (Ramatkal) and later a politician, a Knesset member, and government minister.

==Early life==
Rafael Eitan was born Rafael Kaminsky in the moshav of Tel Adashim near Nazareth in 1929, to Eliyahu and Miriam Eitan, Ukrainian Jewish immigrants to Palestine. His father was one of the founders of the Jewish defense organization Hashomer. Rafael was raised in the community of Tel Adashim. Zvi Nishri (Orloff), a pioneer in modern physical education in Israel, was his uncle. Late in life he reportedly said that he was descended from a Subbotnik family that had served as guards to the tsar. According to Nahum Barnea, a genealogical search indicated that he had Jewish parentage on both sides.

His father gave Rafael and his brothers and sisters a strict education. Rafael later married Miriam, with whom he had five children. They ultimately divorced and he married Ofra Meirson.

==Military career==
===Early battles===

Eitan was a junior officer in the Palmach, the Haganah&#x27;s elite strike force, and took part in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He fought in Jerusalem and received a head wound in the battle for the San Simon Monastery in April 1948. Later he served with the 10th Infantry Battalion in the Lachish-Negev region.

In 1954, Captain Eitan became commander of a Paratroops company in Unit 101. During Operation Olive Leaves in 1955 he received a machine gun wound to his chest, while participating in a military raid into Syria. For this action he was decorated with the Medal of Courage.

In the 1956 Suez Crisis, Major Eitan was the commander of the 890 Paratroopers battalion and participated in the 29 October parachute attack on the Mitla Pass.

During the Six-Day War in early June 1967, as a Colonel he commanded the Paratroopers Brigade on the Gaza front. He received a severe head wound in combat while approaching the Suez Canal.

On the evening of 28 December 1968, he commanded the commando raid on Beirut airport. According to a legend which circulated among Israeli special forces soldiers, at one point during the raid, he entered the airport terminal, and finding it in a state of disorder with no security guards present, walked to a coffee shop, ordered a coffee, and paid for it in Israeli currency before leaving.

In 1969 he was appointed head of infantry forces and later served as a division commander. As a division commander, of 36th Ugda, Brigadier General Eitan stopped the Syrian attack into the Golan Heights during the October 1973 Yom Kippur War. After the war, he was appointed to commander of the northern command and promoted to the rank of Major General.

=== Chief of Staff ===
On 1 April 1978, Eitan was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and was appointed by Ezer Weizman to be the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces.

Eitan opened his term with symbolic steps to increase discipline and efficiency in the IDF. He required soldiers to wear the military beret and to collect spent cartridges after rifle range practice.

Eitan oversaw the redeployment of the IDF outside of the Sinai Peninsula after the peninsula was handed back to Egypt. He and Sharon demolished the Israeli town of Yamit in Sinai in April 1982 after the Egyptians refused to pay for its infrastructure.

As chief of staff, Eitan initiated a project that was known as &quot;Raful Youth&quot; (Na&#x27;arei Raful), in which young persons from low socio-economic background were integrated into the IDF and were trained for professions that allowed them to come out of poverty and avoid getting involved in crime. The IDF also helped those youth to complete their high school studies.

He was chief of staff at the time of the Israeli air attack on Iraq&#x27;s Osirak nuclear reactor complex on 7 June 1981.

In April 1982 he initiated a new policy in the Occupied Territories which in Israeli army slang became known by the Hebrew word &quot;tertur&quot;. One document from his office stated:

After the trial of seven members of the Israeli army in December 1982, an Israeli operations officer was quoted as described &quot;tertur&quot;: &quot;In addition to this business where you work to discover the provocateurs, you &quot;tertur&quot; the population. Population &quot;tertur&quot; does not mean that you punish those who did something, but you simply round up everyone, just like that.&quot;

=== Lebanon War ===
In 1981 it became public knowledge the Israel was arming and forming an alliance with the Lebanese Phalangist militia. In May it was revealed that Eitan had recently visited Jounieh several times and met with the militia leadership. The previous month, at a meeting in Damascus, the Lebanese government had come to an agreement with UNIFIL to deploy Lebanese Army soldiers into the areas that the UN forces were stationed in Southern Lebanon. This was followed by an increase of IDF activity in Lebanon which culminated in a crisis over the positioning Syrian antiaircraft missiles. Operations included a nighttime commando raid on five Palestinian targets in Southern Lebanon, 9–10 April; the shooting down of two Syrian Army helicopters in the Beqaa valley, 28 April; a commando raid near Damour in which four Libyan and two Syrian soldiers were killed, 27 May.

On 3 June 1982, Abu Nidal&#x27;s militant group gravely wounded Israel&#x27;s ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov, in an assassination attempt. In response, the Israeli Air Force bombed Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. The Palestinian militants shelled Israel&#x27;s northern settlements in retaliation and resulted in the Israeli government&#x27;s 4 June order to begin the 1982 Lebanon War. The operation was launched on 6 June and soon became a full-scale invasion. The Israeli plan was to drive the PLO away from the Israeli border and help Bachir Gemayel&#x27;s Phalangist militia take control of south Lebanon. During the war, the IDF faced the Syrian military, Palestinian militants and various militias. The IDF engaged in urban warfare and shelled Beirut to hit PLO headquarters.

The IDF achieved some impressive military results – such as wiping out the entire Syrian air defense system in the first days of the war, under the command of IAF Major general David Ivri. But it also had some failures, such as the Battle of Sultan Yacoub.

The operation was designed to be limited – both in time and area – but the IDF advanced far beyond the planned &quot;40 kilometers&quot; under the command of Defense Minister Ariel Sharon. The mounting Israeli casualties in Lebanon, combined with the Sabra and Shatila massacre, resulted in mass protests by the Israeli public against the war – which resulted in a cease-fire agreements and the establishment of the Kahan Commission to investigate the massacre.

====Kahan Commission====
In concluding that Eitan was &quot;in breach of duty that was incumbent on the Chief of Staff&quot; the Commission focused on two points:

Firstly, that he did not take into consideration the &quot;danger of acts of vengeance and bloodshed&quot; when he, with the Minister of Defence, decided to send the Phalangist
militia into the refugee camps. The commission argued that it was &quot;common knowledge ... that there was a possibility of harm to the population in the camps at the hands of the Phalangists&quot;, particularly in the aftermath of the assassination of their leader, the newly elected President of Lebanon, Bashir Gemayel.

Secondly they found that he was in dereliction of duty for not following up reports of acts of killings which had become known within hours of the Phalangist entry into Shatila camp. They record that he had a meeting with the Phalangist leaders on the following day in Beirut and did not raise the issue. At this meeting he expressed satisfaction with the Phalangist operation and agreed to provide further support.

In its recommendations the commission noted that Eitan was due to retire in April 1983 and therefore resolved &quot;that it is sufficient to determine responsibility without making any further recommendation.&quot;

In a book co-authored by Ze&#x27;ev Schiff, military correspondent of &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;, and Ehud Ya&#x27;ari, Middle East Affairs correspondent for Israeli television, published a year after the Kahan Report, new information came to light, that suggested that Eitan was aware of the feelings of the Phalangists before he and Sharon decided to send the militia into the refugee camps.

During a minuted meeting at the Defense Minister&#x27;s office at 5 pm on Thursday 16 September 1982 between US diplomats including Morris Draper and Sharon, Eitan, Saguy, and two other senior Defense Ministry staff, Draper was informed of the Israeli plan to send the Phalangists into the camps. A heated exchange followed, centering on which Lebanese force was to enter the camps. Draper insisted that it should be the regular Lebanese army. At this point Eitan broke into the discussion:
They&#x27;re not up to it. Let me explain to you. Lebanon is at a point of exploding into a frenzy of revenge. No one can stop them. Yesterday we spoke with the Phalange about their plans. They don&#x27;t have a strong command... They&#x27;re obsessed with the idea of revenge. You have to know the Arabs well to sense something like that. If Amin tells the Phalangists to wreak their vengeance, he&#x27;ll legitimize what&#x27;s going to happen. I&#x27;m telling you that some of their commanders visited me, and I could see in their eyes that it&#x27;s going to be a relentless slaughter. A number of incidents already happened today, and it&#x27;s a good thing we were there, rather than the Lebanese army, to prevent it from going further.
Schiff and Ya&#x27;ari continue: &quot;To hear Eitan tell it, the IDF was the last obstacle to a bloodthirsty rampage by the Phalange. Of course, he neglected to state that the Phalange forces were waiting outside Shatila at that very moment, because he, among others, had encouraged them to fight in the camps&quot;.

==Political career==

After his retirement from the army in April 1983, Eitan entered politics. He had the image of the sabra Israeli who connected to his roots and to the land. His background in agriculture and hobbies such as wood work and flight contributed to this image, which attracted many in the Israeli public.

Eitan was considered to be a conservative advocating tough policies towards the Palestinians. On 12 April 1983 Eitan said in a Knesset committee meeting: &quot;The Arabs will never defeat us by throwing stones. Our answer will be a nationalist Zionist solution. For every stone throwing – we&#x27;ll establish ten settlements. If there will be – and there will be – a hundred settlements between Nablus and Jerusalem, no stones will be thrown.&quot; On another occasion, in an address to the Knesset, he remarked &quot;When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle&quot;.

Eitan initially joined the Tehiya party and was first elected to the Knesset in 1984. Later he established an ultra-nationalist party called Tzomet, which had conservative views on defense and foreign policy but a liberal and secular domestic platform. He was elected to the 11th Knesset and served as Minister of Agriculture between 1988 and 1991, when Tzomet left the government. In the 1992 elections, Tzomet achieved a record of eight seats, but Eitan refused to join Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s coalition.

Eitan was a supporter of the Israeli alliance with Apartheid-era South Africa. Eitan has been accused of expressing racist sentiments towards Arabs. Blacks in South Africa, he claimed, &quot;want to gain control over the white minority just like the Arabs here want to gain control over us. And we, like the white minority in South Africa, must act to prevent them from taking over&quot;.

Eitan had troubles in controlling his party, resulting in some Knesset members splitting from Tzomet to join other parties. When Rabin presented the Oslo II Accords to the Knesset, it managed to pass only with the support of Alex Goldfarb and Gonen Segev – two Tzomet members who were promised ministries by Rabin in return for their support.

On 1996, Tzomet joined an alliance of Likud and Gesher headed by Benjamin Netanyahu. Although the triumvirate lost the Knesset election to Labour, Netanyahu won the election for Prime Minister, allowing him to form the government. Eitan was promised the ministry of internal security, but a criminal investigation against him blocked his nomination. The investigation eventually cleared Eitan and the case was closed on 1998 due to &quot;lack of evidence&quot;. In the meantime, Eitan served as Agriculture and Environment Minister and also as a Deputy Prime Minister (1998–99).

In 1999 Tzomet failed to win any Knesset seats and Eitan retired from politics.

==Death==
On 23 November 2004, Eitan arrived at the Mediterranean sea port of Ashdod, where he was overseeing a port expansion project. A large wave swept him from a breakwater into the sea and he drowned. He was lost in rough waters for over an hour before his body was recovered by the Israeli Navy. He was pronounced dead after efforts to revive him failed.

<text>&quot;Murder Mysteries&quot; is a fantasy short story by Neil Gaiman first published in the 1992 anthology &quot;Midnight Graffiti&quot; and later collected in his collections &quot;Angels and Visitations&quot; and &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot;.

==Plot==
The narrator, a young Englishman, visits Los Angeles for the first time, and has an upsetting encounter with an ex-girlfriend, Tink, and her child, that ends ambiguously. Rattled from the meeting, he sits on a park bench next to a man claiming to be the angel Raguel, once the very first detective, who was called upon to solve a mystery in the Silver City— another angel has been murdered and he has to find the killer, who ultimately turns out to have been the Creator himself, through influencing another angel. The murdered angel was the designer of love, and his co-worker fell in love with him, only to be scorned when the pair moved on to designing death. This sequence of events angers Raguel&#x27;s by-the-book superior, Lucifer, ultimately prompting his doubt and subsequent fall. Raguel has since fallen himself, and become something akin to a grizzled noir detective. In discussion with Raguel, the narrator learns he likely murdered Tink and her child, and so Raguel uses the remnants of his angelic powers to wipe the atrocity away from his mind, setting him on a path towards a stable happy life. On his flight home to England, he reflects on the imagery in Raguel&#x27;s story.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Murder Mysteries&quot; was adapted by the author into an audio drama, which was produced by Seeing Ear Theater in 2000, starring Brian Dennehy and narrated by Michael Emerson. Gaiman and Seeing Ear Theatre went on to collaborate on an adaptation of another story, &quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot;, and the two adaptations have been released together on CD under the title &quot;Two Plays for Voices&quot;.

Hollywood scriptwriter David S. Goyer wrote a script for a potential film. Although it was never made, according to him, Gaiman himself still refers to it as being one of the best adaptations of his work.

In 2002, it was adapted into a comic book by P. Craig Russell, and published by Dark Horse Books.

==Reception==
Reception to the various incarnations of the story have been positive, with Publishers Weekly saying that the graphic novel&#x27;s &quot;crisp&quot; and &quot;vividly rendered&quot; drawings capture the haunting sense of loss and isolation in the mythic tale of love and jealousy. Valentinelli of FlamesRising.com praised the casting for the audio drama, but considered the plot &quot;too vague&quot;.

==Connection to other works==
The angels and their city are also depicted in Gaiman&#x27;s earlier &quot;Sandman&quot; series. S. T. Joshi suggests the events of this story provide a rationale for Lucifer&#x27;s eventual revolt against the Presence. At the end of the story Lucifer leaves, dissatisfied with the justice of the conclusion.

<text>The forcing notrump is a bidding convention in the card game of bridge.

In Standard American bidding, the response of 1NT to an opening bid of 1 or 1 shows 6 to 9 high card points (HCP) and is &quot;non-forcing&quot;. Opener, with a balanced minimum, may pass the 1NT response and, if the opponents also pass, that will become the contract.

A partnership may agree that this bid is &quot;forcing&quot; for one round; if the intervening opponent passes, opener must bid at least once more. This guarantees the responder at least one more opportunity to bid or pass. This mechanism allows the partnership to use the 1NT response for a greater variety of hands: in particular, &quot;invitational&quot; as well as &quot;minimum&quot; responder holdings. The forcing notrump is used over major suits only; 1NT is always standard and non-forcing over the minor suits.

The forcing 1NT bid shows 6 to 12 HCP, denies the ability to make a single raise (but not necessarily an invitational raise), and denies holding four spades if the opening bid was 1; it must be as &quot;forcing&quot; by partner.

As the forcing notrump creates problems of its own, a popular variation that overcomes these is the forcing next step.

==Opener&#x27;s rebid==
Opener is forced to bid again:
*two of original major shows a six-card suit
*two of a lower-ranking suit shows a second suit (which of necessity may be short - see below)
*2NT is natural and invitational (showing about 18 HCP)
*three of a new suit (jump shift) is natural, normally agreed to be game-forcing, and shows about 19 points or more

When opener does not have a six-card original suit nor a four-card lower-ranking second suit, she will have to bid a short suit. Normally, she bids her three-card minor. If she has three cards in both minors, she bids 2.

If opener holds exactly four spades, five hearts, two diamonds and two clubs (and thus originally opened 1), she bids 2, a two-card suit. There is no point in showing the spades, because responder has denied holding four spades (having skipped the 1 response to bid 1NT). After a 1 opening, however, there is no distribution that would compel opener to rebid a two-card suit.

Some partnerships agree not to rebid a two-card suit, preferring to promise a minimum of three cards. This allows responder to pass with zero or one hearts and four or more clubs. Instead, these partnerships rebid 2 (violating rule #1), or pass (if playing Semi-forcing notrump.)

The forcing next step variation (discussed below) overcomes these problems by allowing opener to show a balanced hand, or any second suit and guarantee four cards in it, yet still offer the option of playing in two of the major.

==Responder&#x27;s rebid==
Responder categorizes her hand as either &quot;minimum&quot; (6-9 HCP) or &quot;invitational&quot; (10-12 HCP).

The minimum responder rebids are:
*two of opener&#x27;s original major (shows two-card support)
*two of a new suit (shows a five-card or longer suit; some play a six-card or longer suit)
*pass denies either of the above (shows a distinct preference for opener&#x27;s second-bid suit)

The invitational responder rebids are:
*three of opener&#x27;s original major (shows exactly a three-card limit raise)
*three of a new suit (shows a six-card or longer suit)
*2NT (natural)
*three of opener&#x27;s second suit (shows at least four-card support)
*over a first suit of hearts unusual 2 may apply (see below)

Variation. There is more than one school of thought for responder&#x27;s second call. The above text represents only one theory. Another widely utilized theory is:

With a minimum (6-9 support points):
*pass (or raise) holding five or more cards in the suit bid: exception - see false preference.
*bid openers first suit with two-card support: exception see false preference.
*pass holding four or more cards in the current suit bid
*with a six-card or longer suit with reasonable top-cards in the suit, bid that if it is between the current suit and two of openers suit. Example: (opponents passing) 1 – 1NT; 2 – ?. 2 would fit this bid, but 2 would not (as the responder would have bid 1 the first time, see Unusual two spades below)
*if none of these options work, usually pass with three in the current suit, otherwise bid openers first suit false preference (see below) may apply.

==Further bidding==
When responder rebids two of a new suit, opener should pass with a minimum and two or more cards in the suit. With a singleton or void in responder&#x27;s suit, opener should rebid her original major. Responder may yet have a doubleton there and pass, or will be able correct to three of opener&#x27;s second suit or her own good six-card (or longer) suit. In this way, the partnership is normally assured of at least a seven-card fit.

After an invitational responder rebid, opener is expected to pass (or sign off below game) with a minimum opening hand, or to bid game with extra values.

In line with the above Variation, when responder bids their own suit it is &#x27;drop-dead&#x27;, and Pass should be the expected response. However, with a good hand and three-card or more support, a raise may be appropriate. Otherwise, the only reason to bid should be a good hand with no cards in the bid suit, and extra length in one of the first two suits, as partner has at most one card in our major and three cards in our minor.

==Tactical raise==
When responder has a very weak hand (0-4 points), but yet support for opener&#x27;s major (three or more cards), standard bidding dictates a pass (because opener may have a very good hand and get over-enthused after a single raise). This may allow the opponents to get into the bidding at a low level. Playing the forcing notrump, however, it is sometimes tactically advantageous to bid 1NT with this hand and then correct to 2 of opener&#x27;s major. The 1NT bid tends to shut out the opponents and make partner cautious at the same time.

==System implications==
The forcing notrump is generally used by players using the 2/1 game forcing system, but may be used to advantage by other players as well.

==False preference==
When in the maxi-minimum range (8-9 support points), and holding two cards in opener&#x27;s major and five cards in opener&#x27;s minor, you are worried about passing and missing game when partner has some extra-values. So you take &#x27;preference&#x27; to two of opener&#x27;s major. This keeps the bidding alive and allows partner to take another call even though your preference would in fact be for the minor.

When in the mini-minimum range (6-7 support points) and holding two cards in opener&#x27;s major and four cards in opener&#x27;s minor, you Pass. Even though the &#x27;rule&#x27; says to prefer the major, the last thing you need is for partner to take another bid with extra values. By passing in a known fit, you hope to ensure the partnership a plus score.

==Unusual two spades==
Specific to the auctions: 1 – 1NT - 2 and 1 – 1NT - 2. In these auctions responder is known to have fewer than 4 spades. Thus, a call of 2 would have no sensible meaning. In these situations the raise of partner&#x27;s minor is a slightly weaker hand, and the 2 bid is a &#x27;power&#x27; raise to opener&#x27;s minor, usually based on five or more of partners minor and invitational values.

==Semi-forcing notrump==
As a variation, some partnerships choose to play their 1NT response as &quot;semi-forcing&quot;. The rebids and subsequent auctions are the same as with the forcing notrump, except that the opener is allowed to pass with a 5-3-3-2 minimum and no interest in game opposite a limit raise (including three-card support for opener&#x27;s major).

This changes follow-up auctions in that opener is assumed to either have four or more cards in any new suit bid, or some extra values when holding only three cards in a newly bid minor.

==Forcing next step==
With this approach, the next step bid over the major open is forcing and unspecified. &quot;Forcing next step,&quot; also known as the &quot;Kaplan Inversion&quot;, is a mid-chart convention in the ACBL.

*1 - 1NT is forcing, unspecified
*1 - 1 is forcing, with responder having 0-4 spades
*1 - 1NT is forcing with responder showing 5+ spades.

One immediate benefit of this is that the correct major fit can be found. In standard forcing notrump, responder with five spades bids 1 over opener&#x27;s 1 but if she also has 2 hearts she does not then know whether to rebid 2 or 2. In forcing next step, opener will raise 1 - 1NT to 2 if she has support, so if she makes another bid, responder can happily give preference to 2.

The forcing next step approach has the further benefit over the classic forcing notrump of allowing an opener with a balanced hand to define his point count range more tightly.

Here is a simple approach. Assuming the use of strong 1NT openings, the sequence 1 - 1 - 1NT would show a balanced 12-14 HCP with five hearts and 1 - 1 - 2NT would show 18-19 HCP with five hearts.

Here is a more complex approach: Over a sequence of 1 - 1NT, opener rebids:
*2 = 12-16, four clubs, or balanced. (2 from responder finds out which, as well as the strength range.)
*2/ = 12-16, four-card suit
*2 = 12-16, six-card or longer suit
*2NT = 17-18 balanced
*3 any = 17+ natural

If responder wishes to know further about the 2 bid, she asks with 2. Opener rebids 2 = 12-14 balanced, 2 = 12-14 club suit, 2NT = 15-16 balanced, 3 = 15-16 clubs.

Similarly with a sequence starting 1 - 1, opener rebids:
*1NT = 12-16, balanced, or four spades. (2 from partner finds out which, as well as the strength range.)
*2/ = 12-16, four-card suit
*2 = 12-16, six-card or longer suit
*2NT = 17-18 balanced
*3 any = 17+ natural

If responder wishes to know further about the 1NT bid, she asks with 2. Opener rebids 2 = 12-14 balanced, 2 = 12-14 spade suit, 2 = 15-16 spade suit, 2NT = 15-16 balanced. Note that if responder and opener both have four spades, they can still play in 2 in spite of the artificial response.</text><links>

<text>Enantiodromia ( – &quot;opposite&quot; and δρόμος, &quot;dromos&quot; – &quot;running course&quot;) is a principle introduced in the West by psychiatrist Carl Jung. In &quot;Psychological Types&quot;, Jung defines enantiodromia as &quot;the emergence of the unconscious opposite in the course of time.&quot; It is similar to the principle of equilibrium in the natural world, in that any extreme is opposed by the system in order to restore balance. When things get to their extreme, they turn into their opposite. Jung adds that &quot;this characteristic phenomenon practically always occurs when an extreme, one-sided tendency dominates conscious life; in time an equally powerful counterposition is built up which first inhibits the conscious performance and subsequently breaks through the conscious control.&quot;

This principle was explicitly understood and discussed in the principles of traditional Chinese religion, as in Taoism and yin-yang. A central premise of the I Ching is that yang lines become yin when they have reached their extreme, and vice versa. However, in Jungian terms, a thing psychically transmogrifies into its shadow opposite, in the repression of psychic forces that are thereby cathected into something powerful and threatening.

==Overview==
Jung was heavily influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche, and Nietzsche discusses this idea in several areas of his works: &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; Aphorism 1, 2 and 3; &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; Aphorism 2.

The word &quot;enantiodromia&quot; was apparently coined by Stobaeus but the concept is implied also in Heraclitus&#x27;s writings. In DK fragment 126 for example, Heraclitus says &quot;cold things warm, warm things cool, wet things dry and parched things get wet.&quot; It also seems implicit in other of his sayings, like &quot;war is father of all, king of all&quot; (fr. 53), &quot;they do not know that the differing/opposed thing agrees with itself; harmony is reflexive (παλίντροπος &quot;palintropos&quot;, used of a compound bow, or &quot;in reflexive tension&quot;), like the bow and the lyre&quot; (fr. 51). In these passages and others the idea of the coincidence of opposites is clearly articulated in Heraclitus&#x27; characteristic riddling style, as well as the dynamic motion back and forth between the two, generated especially by opposition and conflict.

Jung himself wrote: &quot;Old Heraclitus, who was indeed a very great sage, discovered the most marvellous of all psychological laws: the regulative function of opposites. He called it enantiodromia, a running contrariwise, by which he meant that sooner or later everything runs into its opposite.&quot;

Roughly a generation later, Plato in the &quot;Phaedo&quot; articulated the principle clearly: &quot;Everything arises in this way, opposites from their opposites.&quot; (sect. 71a).

Since Jung&#x27;s modern recognition of it many centuries later, it has been actively portrayed in modern culture. For example, it has been applied to the subject of the film &quot;The Lives of Others&quot;, to show how one devoted to a communist regime breaks through his loyalty and emerges a humanist.

In particular, Jung used the term to refer to the unconscious acting against the wishes of the conscious mind, updating the Greek concept of akrasia in modern psychological terms. (&quot;Aspects of the Masculine&quot;, chapter 7, paragraph 294).

Enantiodromia. Literally, &quot;running counter to,&quot; referring to the emergence of the unconscious opposite in the course of time.

This characteristic phenomenon practically always occurs when an extreme, one-sided tendency dominates conscious life; in time an equally powerful counterposition is built up, which first inhibits the conscious performance and subsequently breaks through the conscious control. (&quot;Definitions,&quot; &quot;ibid.&quot;, par. 709)

Enantiodromia is typically experienced in conjunction with symptoms associated with acute neurosis, and often foreshadows a rebirth of the personality.

The grand plan on which the unconscious life of the psyche is constructed is so inaccessible to our understanding that we can never know what evil may not be necessary in order to produce good by enantiodromia, and what good may very possibly lead to evil. (&quot;The Phenomenology of the Spirit in Fairytales&quot;, &quot;Collected Works 9i&quot;, par. 397)

Enantiodromia also refers to the process whereby one seeks out and embraces an opposing quality from within, internalizing it in a way that results in individual wholeness. This process is the crux of Jung&#x27;s notion called the &quot;path of individuation.&quot; One must incorporate an opposing archetype into their psyche to obtain a state of internal &#x27;completion.&#x27;

<text>Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff (6 March 1912 – 17 May 1994) was an Austrian anthropologist and archaeologist. He is known for his fieldwork among many different Amerindian cultures such as in the Amazonian tropical rainforests (e.g. Desana Tucano), and also among dozens of other indigenous groups in Colombia in the Caribbean Coast (such as the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta), as well as others living in the Pacific Coast, Llanos Orientales, and in the Andean and inter-Andean regions (Muisca) as well as in other areas of Colombia, and he also did research on campesino societies. For nearly six decades he advanced ethnographic and anthropological studies, as well as archeological research, and as a scholar was a prolific writer and public figure renowned as a staunch defender of indigenous peoples. Reichel-Dolmatoff has worked with other archaeologists and anthropologists such as Marianne Cardale de Schrimpff, Ana María Groot, Gonzalo Correal Urrego and others. He died 17 May 1994 in Colombia.

== Personal life ==
Reichel was born in 1912 in Salzburg, then part of Austria-Hungary, as son of the artist Carl Anton Reichel and Hilde Constance Dolmatoff. Oriented in the classics (Latin and Greek) he did most of his high school at the Benedictine school of Kremsmunster in Austria. He attended classes at the Faculté des Lettres of the Sorbonne and in the École du Louvre from late 1937 to 1938. Reichel emigrated to Colombia in 1939, where he became a Colombian citizen in 1942. Reichel became member and was the Secretary to the Free France Movement (1942-1943) with the help of his colleague and friend the French ethnologist Paul Rivet who was the Delegate of the Resistance of France Libre and living in Colombia. General Charles De Gaulle later awarded Reichel-Dolmatoff with the medal of the Ordre national du Mérite. Reichel-Dolmatoff spent the rest of his life in research in the fields of anthropology, archaeology, ethnoecology, ethnohistory, ethnoastronomy, material culture, art, and vernacular architecture, among others.

== Career ==
Reichel-Dolmatoff developed a keen interest for conducting fieldwork which would take him and his studies throughout the country, the Caribbean area, La Guajira desert, the Chocó rainforests, the Llanos Orientales, to the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Amazon rainforests.

Some of Reichel-Dolmatoff&#x27;s archeological research was essential in creating the basic chronological framework for most of the Colombian area, and is still used today. In a trip to the upper Meta River in the Orinoco plains in 1940, he conducted research and later published the earliest studies done on the Guahibo Indians. In 1943 Gerardo wrote his first article on the Muisca settlement of Soacha. That same year, together with his wife anthropologist and archeologist Alicia Dussán, he conducted an analysis on pre-Columbian burial urns of the Magdalena River. Working in the Tolima region inhabited by Amerindians and the renowned indigenous leader Quintin Lame, they also published a study indicating the indigenous culture of the local populations and also indicated the blood type variations among the indigenous groups of the Pijao in the Department of Tolima as further proof of their Amerindian identity as these tribes were arguing over rights to their ancestral territories.

Switching residency to the city of Santa Marta in 1946, the Reichel-Dolmatoffs created and headed the Instituto Etnologico del Magdalena in 1945 and created also a small museum about the anthropology and archeology of the Sierra Nevada region. Reichel-Dolmatoff wrote a two volume monography of the Kogi Indians in the 1940s which to this day is considered a classic reference. For the next five years, Gerardo and his colleague and wife conducted research throughout the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta region, focusing particularly on the Tairona descendants, the Kogui, also known as the Kogi or Kaggaba, and also worked with the Arhuaco and Wiwa indigenous groups, as well as ethnography of a peasant community among the people of Aritama (Kankuamo). Reichel-Dolmatoff carried out a regional study of the area covering archeology, ethnohistory and anthropology, making it one of the first such regional studies made in Colombia. Reichel also did research in the Pacific coast and studied amongst others the Kuna of the Caiman Nuevo River, west of the Gulf of Urabá. Several years later, Reichel published ethnohistorical studies and anthropological research related to the Kogi, demonstrating their connections to ancestral Tairona chiefdoms.

In the late 1950s, Reichel and his family moved to the coastal city of Cartagena. Reichel taught classes in medical anthropology at the university there and engaged in programs of public health with an anthropological perspective. Actively involved in archeological excavations in the Caribbean region around Cartagena, in 1954, the Reichel-Dolmatoffs located and also excavated, amongst others, the Barlovento site, which was the first early Formative shell-midden site found in Colombia. At Momil, they conducted the first study of societies engaged in a subsistence change from shifting cultivation (manioc) to corn agriculturalists. After returning to live in Bogotá in 1960 Reichel was the founder, professor, and first Chair the first Department of Anthropology in Colombia. Reichel did archeological excavations at the site of Puerto Hormiga where they discovered the earliest dated pottery in all of the New World (at that time), -dated over 5 thousand years old- which indicated that pottery had been first developed in the Caribbean coast of Colombia and then spread elsewhere to the rest of the Americas (and hence was not brought through diffusion from the Old World as had been formerly suggested by other archeologists) .(Reichel see biblio). Reichel also excavated in other sites including in San Agustin, Huila. He published his analyses of the Puerto Hormiga site regarding early Formative cultures, and of the San Agustin site regarding chiefdoms. Reichel also produced one of the first overviews of Colombian archeology and proposed an interpretive framework of its millenarian pre-historic past.

In 1963, Reichel and his wife taught courses in anthropology at the Universidad de los Andes, and then in 1964 formally created the first Department of Anthropology in Colombia at the university in Bogotá. Reichel-Dolmatoff worked for 5 years at the Department and left together with his wife and several other professors due to changes in the Department.

Reichel received a short visiting fellowship to Cambridge University in 1970 and became an adjunct professor at the Anthropology Department of the University of California in Los Angeles. During the 1960s and until the mid-1990s Reichel-Dolmatoff advanced research on Amerindian shamanism, indigenous modes of life, ethnoecology, and on cosmologies and worldviews, and he also did research on hallucinogens related to shamanism, entheogens, ethnoastronomy, ethnobotany, ethnozoology, and on the vernacular architecture of temples and of the Amazonian &#x27;maloca&#x27; longhouses; additionally he did research on the shamanic symbolism of pre-Columbian goldwork, as well as other Amerindian artifacts and material culture, including basketry.

Reichel-Dolmatoff was a member of the Colombian Academy of Sciences, and a Foreign Associate Member of the NAS National Academy of Sciences of the United States and he was also a member of the Academia Real Española de Ciencias. He was awarded the Thomas H. Huxley medal by the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland in 1975. Reichel-Dolmatoff was the single author of 40 books and of over 400 articles, all dedicated to the archeology and anthropology of Colombia and specifically highlighting the relevance of indigenous peoples of the past and present.

In 1983, Reichel-Dolmatoff was one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), which was created and headed by dr. Abdus Salam (Nobel Prize in Physics) with renowned scientists of the Third World who sought to focus differently on the issues of science and technology for the interests of the developing countries themselves.

=== International recognition ===
While living in Colombia for over half a century, Reichel-Dolmatoff provided his professional services to the national and departmental governments, and as university professor, researcher and author to public and private universities. In 1945 he founded in Santa Marta the &quot;Instituto Ethnologico Nacional del Magdalena&quot; and in the early 1950s he became professor of Medical Anthropology at the University of Cartagena. He occupied, amongst other positions, those of researcher and lecturer of the Instituto Etnologico Nacional and the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and he was Chair and professor of the Department of Anthropology of the Universidad de los Andes. He was visiting professor of the National Museum of Ethnology in Japan. Reichel-Dolmatoff participated in academic congresses and seminars and wrote conference papers in universities and international or national academic events in South America, North America and Central America as well as in Europe, Japan. In the field of archaeology, Reichel-Dolmatoff helped define the early archeological evidence of the Formative stage in Colombia, based on sites excavated which provided the then most ancient site in all the Americas where pottery had originated over 6,000 years ago, and this research was tied also to new interpretations of the meaning and connections of the cultural evolution of Colombia with other regions of the Americas. Reichel-Dolmatoff researched origins of early chiefdoms and explained the millenarian evolution of Amerindian cultures and their links to contemporary indigenous groups. His excavations focused mainly on living spaces and garbage heaps, where the archaeologist avoided exploring or excavating monumental sculptures, monumental architecture and indigenous burial sites. In the field of anthropology, Reichel-Dolmatoff focused on investigating and celebrating Colombia&#x27;s ethnic and cultural diversity and especially of indigenous peoples. The scope and extent of his work and dedication to understanding, acknowledging and disseminating the importance and value of Colombia&#x27;s contemporary indigenous peoples was significant.

At a conference in 1987, Reichel-Dolmatoff spoke the following words:

&quot;Today I must acknowledge that since the beginning of the 1940s, it has been for me a real privilege to live with, and also try to understand in depth, diverse indigenous groups. I noted among them particular mental structures and value systems that seemed to be beyond any of the typologies and categories held then by Anthropology. I did not find the ‘noble savage’ nor the so-called ‘primitive’. I did not find the so-called degenerate or brutish Indian nor even less the inferior beings as were generally described by the rulers, missionaries, historians, politicians and writers. What I did find was a world with a philosophy so coherent, with morals so high, with social and political organizations of great complexity, and with sound environmental management based on well-founded knowledge. In effect, I saw that the indigenous cultures offered unsuspected options that offered strategies of cultural development that simply we should not ignore because they contain valid solutions and are applicable to a variety of human problems. All of this more and more made my admiration grow for the dignity, the intelligence and the wisdom of these aborigines, who not least have developed wondrous dynamics and forms of resistance thanks to which so-called ‘civilization’ has not been able to exterminate them.

I have tried to contribute to the recuperation of the dignity of the Indians, that dignity that since the arrival of the Spaniards has been denied to them; in effect, for five hundred years there has been an open tendency to malign and try to ignore the millenary experience of the population of a whole continent. But humankind is one; human intelligence is a gift so precious that it can not be despised in any part of the world, and this country is in arrears in recognizing the great intellectual capacity of the indigenous peoples and their great achievements due to their knowledge systems, which do not lose validity for the mere fact they do not adjust to the logic of Western thinking.

I hope my conceptualizations and works have had a certain influence beyond anthropological circles. Maybe I am too optimistic, but I think that anthropologists of the older and new generations, according to their epochs and the changing roles of the Social Sciences, have contributed to revealing new dimensions of the Colombian people and of nationhood. I also have trust that our anthropological work constitutes an input to the indigenous communities themselves, and to their persistent effort to attain the respect, in the largest sense of the term, that is owed to them within Colombian society. I think that the country must highlight the indigenous legacy and guarantee fully the survival of the contemporary ethnic groups. I think that the county should be proud to be mestizo. I do not think that it is possible to advance towards the future without building upon the knowledge of the proper millenarian history, nor overlook what occurred to the indigenous peoples nor the black populations (Afrodescendants) during the Conquest and the Colonies, and also during the Republic and to this day. These are, in sum, some of the ideas that have guided me through almost half a century. They have given sense to my life.&quot;

<doc id="1201310" wikidata="Q339687" url="?curid=1201310" title="Accumulated cyclone energy">
<text>Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) is a metric used to compare overall activity of tropical cyclones, utilizing the available records of windspeeds at six-hour intervals to synthesize storm duration and strength into a single index value. The ACE index may refer to a single storm or to groups of storms such as those within a particular month, a full season or combined seasons. It is calculated by summing the square of tropical cyclones&#x27; maximum sustained winds, as recorded every six hours, but only for windspeeds of at least tropical storm strength (≥ 34 kn; 63 km/h; 39 mph); the resulting figure is divided by 10,000 to place it on a more manageable scale.

The calculation originated as the Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP) index, which sums the squares of tropical cyclones&#x27; maximum sustained winds while at hurricane strength, at least 64 knots (≥ 119 km/h; 74 mph) at six-hour recorded intervals across an entire season. The HDP index was later modified to further include tropical storms, that is, all wind speeds of at least 34 knots (≥ 63 km/h; 39 mph), to become the &quot;accumulated cyclone energy&quot; index.

The highest ACE calculated for a single tropical cyclone on record worldwide is 87.01, set by Cyclone Freddy in 2023.

==History==
The ACE index is an offshoot of Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP), an index created in 1988 by William Gray and his associates at Colorado State University who argued the destructiveness of a hurricane&#x27;s wind and storm surge is better related to the square of the maximum wind speed (formula_1)
than simply to the maximum wind speed (formula_2). The HDP index is calculated by squaring the estimated maximum sustained wind speeds for tropical cyclones while at hurricane strength, that is, wind speeds of at least 64 knots (≥ 119 km/h; 74 mph). The squared windspeeds from six-hourly recorded intervals are then summed across an entire season. This scale was subsequently modified in 1999 by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to include not only hurricanes but also tropical storms, that is, all cyclones while windspeeds are at least 34 knots (≥ 63 km/h; 39 mph). Since the calculation was more broadly adjusted by NOAA, the index has been used in a number of different ways such as to compare individual storms, and by various agencies and researchers including the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department. The purposes of the ACE index include to categorize how active tropical cyclone seasons were as well as to identify possible long-term trends in a certain area such as the Lesser Antilles.

==Calculation==
&quot;Accumulated cyclone energy&quot; is calculated by summing the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of tropical cyclones when wind speeds are at least tropical storm strength (≥ 34 kn; 63 km/h; 39 mph) at recorded six-hour intervals. The sums are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable. One unit of ACE equals and for use as an index the unit is assumed. Thus:

: formula_3 (for formula_2 ≥ 34 kn),

where formula_2 is estimated sustained wind speed in knots at six-hour intervals.

Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity. However, unlike the measure defined above, kinetic energy is also proportional to the mass formula_6(corresponding to the size of the storm) and represents an integral of force equal to mass times acceleration, formula_7, where acceleration is the antiderivative of velocity, or formula_2. The integral is a difference at the limits of the square antiderivative, rather than a sum of squares at regular intervals. Thus, the term applied to the index, &quot;accumulated cyclone energy&quot;, is a misnomer since the index is neither a measure of kinetic energy nor &quot;accumulated energy.&quot;

==Atlantic Ocean==
Within the Atlantic Ocean, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and others use the ACE index of a season to classify the season into one of four categories. These four categories are extremely active, above-normal, near-normal, and below-normal, and are worked out using an approximate quartile partitioning of seasons based on the ACE index over the 70 years between 1951 and 2020. The median value of the ACE index from 1951 to 2020 is 96.7 x 104 kt2


===Individual storms in the Atlantic===
The highest ever ACE estimated for a single storm in the Atlantic is 73.6, for the San Ciriaco hurricane in 1899. A Category 4 hurricane which lasted for four weeks, this single storm had an ACE higher than many whole Atlantic storm seasons. Other Atlantic storms with high ACEs include Hurricane Ivan in 2004, with an ACE of 70.4, Hurricane Irma in 2017, with an ACE of 64.9, the Great Charleston Hurricane in 1893, with an ACE of 63.5, Hurricane Isabel in 2003, with an ACE of 63.3, and the 1932 Cuba hurricane, with an ACE of 59.8.

Since 1950, the highest ACE of a tropical storm was Tropical Storm Philippe in 2023, which attained an ACE of 9.4. The highest ACE of a Category 1 hurricane was Hurricane Nadine in 2012, which attained an ACE of 26.3. The record for lowest ACE of a tropical storm is jointly held by Tropical Storm Chris in 2000 and Tropical Storm Philippe in 2017, both of which were tropical storms for only six hours and had an ACE of just 0.1225. The lowest ACE of any hurricane was 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Cindy, which was only a hurricane for six hours, and 2007&#x27;s Hurricane Lorenzo, which was a hurricane for twelve hours; Cindy had an ACE of just 1.5175 and Lorenzo had a lower ACE of only 1.475. The lowest ACE of a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher), was Hurricane Gerda in 1969, with an ACE of 5.3.
The following table shows those storms in the Atlantic basin from 1851–2021 that have attained over 50 points of ACE.

===Historical ACE in recorded Atlantic hurricane history===

There is an undercount bias of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes before the satellite era (prior to the mid–1960s), due to the difficulty in identifying storms.

Classification criteria


==Eastern Pacific==
Within the Eastern Pacific Ocean, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and others use the ACE index of a season to classify the season into one of three categories. These four categories are extremely active, above-, near-, and below-normal and are worked out using an approximate tercile partitioning of seasons based on the ACE index and the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes over the 30 years between 1991 and 2020.

For a season to be defined as above-normal, the ACE index criterion and two or more of the other criteria given in the table below must be satisfied.

The mean value of the ACE index from 1991 to 2020 is 108.7 × 104 kt2, while the median value is 97.2 × 104 kt2.

===Individual storms in the Pacific===
The highest ever ACE estimated for a single storm in the Eastern or Central Pacific, while located east of the International Date Line is 62.8, for Hurricane Fico of 1978. Other Eastern Pacific storms with high ACEs include Hurricane John in 1994, with an ACE of 54.0, Hurricane Kevin in 1991, with an ACE of 52.1, and Hurricane Hector of 2018, with an ACE of 50.5.&lt;ref name=&quot;HURDAT2 - EPAC/CPAC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows those storms in the Eastern and Central Pacific basins from 1971 through 2023 that have attained over 30 points of ACE.
 – Indicates that the storm formed in the Eastern/Central Pacific, but crossed 180°W at least once; therefore, only the ACE and number of days spent in the Eastern/Central Pacific are included.

===Historical ACE in recorded Pacific hurricane history===

Data on ACE is considered reliable starting with the 1971 season.

Classification criteria


== Western Pacific ==

===Historical ACE in recorded Western Pacific typhoon history===
There is an undercount bias of tropical storms, typhoons, and super typhoon before the satellite era (prior to the mid–1950s), due to the difficulty in identifying storms.

Classification criteria



==North Indian==

There are various agencies over the North Indian Ocean that monitor and forecast tropical cyclones, including the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center, as well as the Bangladesh, Pakistan and India Meteorological Department. As a result, the track and intensity of tropical cyclones differ from each other, and as a result, the accumulated cyclone energy also varies over the region. However, the India Meteorological Department has been designated as the official Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre by the WMO for the region and has worked out the ACE for all cyclonic systems above based on their best track analysis which goes back to 1982.

<text>Mickey Leroy Gilley (March 9, 1936 – May 7, 2022) was an American country music singer and musician. Although he started out singing straight-up country and western material in the 1970s, Gilley moved towards a more pop-friendly sound in the 1980s, bringing him further success on not just the country charts, but the pop charts as well.

Among his biggest hits are &quot;Room Full of Roses&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time&quot;, and the remake of the Soul hit &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. Gilley charted 42 singles in the top 40 on the US Country chart. He was a cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl McVoy, and Jimmy Swaggart.

==Biography==
===Early life and the rise to fame===
Gilley was born to Arthur Fillmore Gilley (November 27, 1897 – February 2, 1982) and Irene Gilley ( Lewis; September 11, 1900 – August 14, 1985) in Natchez, Mississippi.

For many years, Gilley lived in the shadow of his well-known cousin, Jerry Lee Lewis, a successful rock and roll singer and musician in the 1950s and early 1960s. Gilley grew up in Louisiana, just across the Mississippi River from where Lewis grew up. Gilley&#x27;s family moved to the east side of Houston, Texas, in the 1940s, where he attended Galena Park High School. He was primarily a guitarist at the time and took his guitar to school to entertain classmates.

They sang both boogie-woogie and gospel music, but Gilley did not become a professional singer until Lewis hit the top of the charts in the 1950s. Gilley then cut a few singles and played sessions in New Orleans with producer Huey P. Meaux. His record &quot;Call Me Shorty&quot; on the Dot label sold well in 1958. In the 1960s, he played at many clubs and bars, gaining a following at the Nesadel Club in Pasadena, Texas. Paula Records released Gilley&#x27;s first album, &quot;Down the Line&quot;, in 1967. He had a minor hit from the album called &quot;Now I Can Live Again&quot;.

In 1970, Gilley joined in a partnership with Sherwood Cryer. Sherwood owned the club under the name Shelly&#x27;s. His first nightclub in Pasadena, Texas, called Gilley&#x27;s Club. It later became known as the &quot;world&#x27;s biggest honky-tonk&quot;. Gilley&#x27;s Club and its mechanical bull were portrayed in the 1980 film, &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. He shared Gilley&#x27;s Club with Sherwood Cryer, who asked Gilley to re-open his former bar with him. The club portion of Gilley&#x27;s burned in 1990.

===Recording career in the 1970s before &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;===
In 1974, Gilley recorded a song that originally was only supposed to be recorded for fun, titled &quot;Room Full of Roses&quot;, written by Tim Spencer of the Sons of the Pioneers, which was a one-time hit for George Morgan. The song was released by Astro Records that year, and then Playboy Records got a hold of the single and obtained national distribution for &quot;Room Full of Roses&quot;. From then on, Gilley was signed to Playboy Records, working with his long-time friend Eddie Kilroy. &quot;Room Full of Roses&quot; became the song that put Gilley on national radar, hitting the very top of the Country charts that year, as well as making it to No. 50 on the pop music chart.

He had a string of top tens and No. 1s throughout the 1970s. Some of these hits were cover versions of songs, including the Bill Anderson song &quot;City Lights&quot;, George Jones&#x27; &quot;The Window Up Above&quot;, and Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Bring It On Home to Me&quot;. He remained a popular country act for the rest of the 1970s. Other hits in the 1970s include &quot;Chains of Love&quot; (1977), &quot;Honky Tonk Memories&quot; (1977), &quot;She&#x27;s Pulling Me Back Again&quot; (1977), and &quot;Here Comes the Hurt Again&quot; (1978).

In 1978, Gilley signed on with Epic Records, when Playboy Records was bought by Epic. By 1979, his success was fading slightly. Songs like &quot;The Power of Positive Drinkin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Just Long Enough to Say Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;My Silver Lining&quot; just made the Top Ten.

===Recording career in the 1980s with the success of &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;===
By 1980, Gilley decided to come up with a new sound, to bring him the country crossover success that so many other country singers (including Eddie Rabbitt, Juice Newton, Kenny Rogers, and Dolly Parton) were experiencing at the time. His career was given a second go-around when one of his recordings was featured in the box-office-selling film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. The song was the country remake of the soul standard &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. As the movie was becoming successful, so was &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. The song rose to the top of the country charts in 1980, and hit the Top 5 of the Adult Contemporary charts, and in addition made the Pop Top 40.

&quot;Room Full of Roses&quot;, &quot;True Love Ways&quot;, and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; also hit the Billboard Hot 100; additionally, &quot;Bring It On Home To Me&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s All That Matters&quot;, and &quot;Talk to Me&quot; bubbled under (at 101, 101 and 106, respectively). A string of six number-ones on the country chart followed the success of &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. Gilley&#x27;s other country No. 1s include &quot;True Love Ways&quot;, &quot;A Headache Tomorrow (Or a Heartache Tonight)&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;, and &quot;Lonely Nights&quot;. He never had any other pop hits though. In 1983, he had other country hits, like &quot;Fool For Your Love&quot;; &quot;Paradise Tonight&quot;, a duet with Charly McClain; and &quot;Talk to Me&quot; (not to be confused with the Stevie Nicks hit of the same name). All of these songs from 1983 were No. 1 country hits for Gilley. In 1984, he had a single, which just missed topping the country chart called &quot;You&#x27;ve Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;. Another hit followed in the form of a duet with Charly McClain, &quot;Candy Man&quot;, and a solo hit with &quot;Too Good To Stop Now&quot;, both of which made the Top 5 that year.

The year 1985 brought Top 10s with &quot;I&#x27;m the One Mama Warned You About&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Something on Your Mind&quot;, followed by a Top 5 with &quot;Your Memory Ain&#x27;t What It Used To Be&quot;, and a Top 10 with &quot;Doo-Wah Days&quot; in 1986. &quot;Doo-Wah Days&quot; was Gilley&#x27;s last Top 10 hit on the country charts, as a new breed of George Strait-inspired Country singers called the &quot;Traditionalists&quot; were moving into Nashville, like Clint Black, Patty Loveless, Reba McEntire, and Randy Travis. Not only was his chart success fading, but Gilley had a series of financial problems that led to the closing of his club in Pasadena, Texas.

In 1988, Gilley signed with Airborne Records and released an album, &quot;Chasin&#x27; Rainbows,&quot; which resulted in his last Top 40 country hit in &quot;She Reminded Me of You&quot;, which made No. 23 that year.

In a career that included 15 years of chart success, Gilley had 17 No. 1 country hits.

===Later career===
Gilley turned his attention to Branson, Missouri, where he built a theater, which was a soon-to-be boomtown for the country music industry.

Gilley also appeared on &quot;Urban Cowboys&quot;, episode 9 in the third season of &quot;American Pickers&quot;, which aired originally on September 5, 2011. In 2012, Gilley signed a Branson-based vocal group, Six, to a three-year lease to perform in his theater, with an option to buy it when the contract expired.

Gilley returned to the studio in 2017 and released &quot;Kickin&#x27; It Down the Road&quot; the same year. The CD contains several new recordings and several remakes of classic songs originally recorded by him.

In 2018, Gilley teamed up with longtime friend Troy Payne to record his last studio album &quot;Two Old Cats&quot;, a CD containing 13 classic country duets.

===Personal life===
Gilley&#x27;s first wife was Geraldine Garrett, whom he married in 1953 (when he was 17 years old); they divorced in 1961. She was the mother of three of his four children (Keith Ray, Michael, and Kathy). She died on March 6, 2010. Gilley&#x27;s second wife, whom he married in 1962, was Vivian McDonald. Together they had a son, Gregory (1966–2022). She died in 2019. Mickey and Cindy Loeb, his longtime friend and business associate, were married in June 2020. Gilley was double first cousins with both Jerry Lee Lewis and evangelist Jimmy Swaggart of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

In July 2009, Gilley was helping a neighbor move some furniture when he fell with the love seat falling on top of him, crushing four vertebrae. The incident left him temporarily paralyzed from the neck down, but after intense physical therapy he was able to walk again and return to the stage a year later. However, he still lacked the hand-eye coordination necessary to play the piano.

Gilley died on May 7, 2022, of complications from bone cancer.

==Honors==
For his contribution to the recording industry, Mickey Gilley has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6930 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.

On March 2, 2002, Gilley, along with his two famous cousins Lewis and Swaggart, was inducted into the Delta Music Museum Hall of Fame in Ferriday, Louisiana.

In 2017, Gilley was awarded the Key to the City of Winchester, Virginia, by the Hon. David Smith at the Shenandoah Conservatory of Music&#x27;s Ohrstrom-Bryant Theatre at Bonnie Blue&#x27;s Roadhouse Classic Concert.

In 2020, a road in Pasadena, Texas, was renamed in his honor as Mickey Gilley Boulevard.

Gilley&#x27;s Dallas, an entertainment complex in Dallas, Texas, is named for Gilley.

==Other==
Gilley was a licensed pilot, holding an instrument rating with commercial pilot privileges for multi-engine airplanes, as well as private pilot privileges for single engine aircraft.

==The Mickey Gilley Golf Classic==
The &quot;Gilley&quot; was first organized in 2009 by a group of urban cowboys brought together by their love for golf, country music, and rhinestone shirts. After stints in Branson, Missouri (also known as &quot;The Town that Mickey Built&quot;) and Northwest Arkansas (moved due to legal issues), in 2014 the Gilley settled at its current location at Old Kinderhook Resort, Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri.

<doc id="1201315" wikidata="Q713393" url="?curid=1201315" title="Okjeo">
<text>Okjeo () was an ancient Korean tribal state which arose in the northern Korean peninsula from perhaps the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE.

Dong-okjeo (Eastern Okjeo) occupied roughly the area of the Hamgyŏng provinces of North Korea, and Buk-okjeo (Northern Okjeo) occupied the Duman River region.

Dong-okjeo was often simply called Okjeo, while Buk-okjeo was also sometimes referred to as Chiguru (置溝婁, 치구루) or Guru (구루), the latter name being also applied to Goguryeo. Okjeo bordered the other minor state of Dongye on the south, and shared a similar fate.

==History==
In its early history, Okjeo oscillated between domination by the Chinese commanderies and by Goguryeo. From the 3rd century BCE to 108 BCE, it was controlled by Gojoseon. At 107 BCE, it became part of the Xuantu Commandery. As the Xuantu Commandery retreated towards the liadong peninsula as a result of expansion of Goguryeo, East okjeo became part of the eastern part of the Lelang Commandery. Due to the constant interference of its neighbours, Okjeo never grew into a fully centralised kingdom. In 28 BCE, King Dongmyeong sent Bu Wiyeom to attack the Northern Okjeo. In the 1st or 2nd century CE, King Taejo of Goguryeo reduced Okjeo to a tributary, which delivered local products to Goguryeo. During the 244 Wei Invasion of Goguryeo, Goguryeo&#x27;s King Dongcheon briefly retreated to North Okjeo, and in 285, the Buyeo court also temporarily escaped to Okjeo under northern nomadic attacks.

In early 5th century, Okjeo was completely conquered by Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo.

==Culture==
Knowledge of Okjeo culture is fragmentary. As with the Dongye and Okjeo&#x27;s language, food, clothing, architecture, and customs were similar to that of Goguryeo. The Okjeo people practised arranged marriage by which the child-bride lived with the child-groom&#x27;s family until adulthood, and they interred the dead of a family in a single coffin.

<text>Chris Lawler (born 20 October 1943) is a former footballer who enjoyed much of Liverpool&#x27;s success of the mid 1960s to early 1970s.

==Life and playing career==

A right-sided defender, Lawler joined his local club when he turned 17 in October 1960, and made his debut at the age of 19 in a 2–2 league draw with West Bromwich Albion at Anfield on 20 March 1963. For two seasons his progression into first team regular was gradual, playing just six matches in each of the seasons, but by 1965 he was the first choice right back. He scored the first of his many goals (for a right-back) during that season in a 5–1 defeat of Burnley at Turf Moor on 5 December 1964. Lawler&#x27;s timing and anticipation, enabling him to turn up in the right place at the right time to score vital goals, earned him the nickname &#x27;The Silent Knight&#x27;. The 1964–65 season culminated in him being selected in the team which beat Leeds United in the FA Cup final at Wembley, winning the trophy for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

Lawler missed just three games in the next seven seasons. During this period, he helped Liverpool win the League championship in 1966, ahead of Leeds by six points (in the old two points for a win system). This was followed by Liverpool being beaten 2–1 by Borussia Dortmund in the Cup Winners Cup at Hampden Park, Glasgow, in the Reds&#x27; first ever appearance in a major European final.

Lawler was an automatic starter on the team that finished second to Leeds for the 1968–69 league championship. He survived manager Bill Shankly&#x27;s massive cull of 1970 which saw many of the older 1960s stars replaced by younger talent; this was perhaps due to Lawler being only 26 years-old at the time and hence younger than many who did get culled. Other than Lawler, only Emlyn Hughes, Ian Callaghan and Tommy Smith were retained.

Lawler again tasted defeat when he played in the 1971 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal. Liverpool won a League title and UEFA Cup double in 1973. Liverpool finished three points ahead of Arsenal in the league, while in the UEFA Cup final Liverpool defeated Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–2 on aggregate (won the first leg 3–0 at Anfield, lost the second leg 2–0 in West Germany).

It was during this period that Lawler won his four England caps. He scored on his debut, in the 5–0 defeat of Malta in a UEFA European Football Championship qualifier at Wembley on 12 May 1971.

He was on the bench, after a spell out injured, as Liverpool reached the FA Cup final again in 1974. As the 12th man, he received a winner&#x27;s medal when Liverpool beat Newcastle United 3–0, but he did not see any action.

Bill Shankly&#x27;s sudden departure from the club in the summer of 1974 marked the downturn of Lawler&#x27;s Liverpool career, in addition to an injury suffered against Queens Park Rangers in 1973. New manager Bob Paisley purchased specialist right back Phil Neal from Northampton Town at the end of the year, and thereafter Lawler played only sporadically. He made his final Liverpool appearance against Hibernian in a UEFA Cup tie on 17 September 1975.

Lawler joined Portsmouth in October 1975, who were managed by former Liverpool teammate Ian St John. Lawler later joined Stockport County in 1978. He also played for Welsh League side Bangor City. In 1976, he played the summer on loan to the Miami Toros of the North American Soccer League. In 1980–81 Chris Lawler played and coached second-level club Raufoss I.L. in the Norwegian league system.

Lawler became a coach at Liverpool FC after his playing days were over until he was acrimoniously released from his duties in 1986.
Lawler has kept a low profile since then, though has done some work for Liverpool, scouting for players.

Lawler was voted in at No.51 in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop poll on the Liverpool FC Club website.

<doc id="1201319" wikidata="Q5658681" url="?curid=1201319" title="Harlequin Valentine">
<text>Harlequin Valentine is a bloody and romantic short story (1999) and graphic novel (2001) based on the old Commedia dell&#x27;arte and Harlequinade pantomime.

Both the short story and the graphic novel were written by Neil Gaiman. The latter was drawn by John Bolton, and published by Dark Horse Books. The short story has been republished in &quot;Fragile Things&quot;.

==Overview==
The story takes place on February 14 with the harlequin giving Missy his heart, literally, by nailing it to her door. The story follows the unflappable Missy as she tries to discover who gave her this gift, and what she does with it. The merry harlequin follows her the whole time, wondering what this &quot;Columbina&quot;, as he calls his various loves he has given his heart to, will do with it. True to his classic trickster ways, in the same vein as Puck, he&#x27;s constantly meddling with other people&#x27;s lives and causing mischief as he goes, which often get blamed on Pierrot. The story concludes with Missy eating the raw heart (with a side of hash browns and ketchup) at a diner; she is transformed into a new harlequin, while the old harlequin is transformed into a kitchen helper named Pete, who has no memories of ever being the harlequin.

The story includes many of the classic characters from the Harlequinade in modern forms. Most obviously is Harlequin and his sought-after love Columbina, who is named Missy in this modern version. Pantaloon, the third person in the love triangle, also exists here in full.

The artwork is a mixture of digitally enhanced photographs overlaid with painting. This serves the story very well as the fantastic Harlequin follows and interacts with the sensible Missy in her normal world. The backgrounds are made very drab, compared to the colorful characters which almost vibrate on top of them.

At the back of the book is Gaiman&#x27;s essay, &quot;Notes on a Harlequinade&quot;, which tells us a little about the old harlequin stories of the Italian Commedia dell&#x27;arte and the English Harlequinade.

==Stage adaptation==
A stage adaptation of this graphic novel has been produced by Metatron&#x27;s Men () group made of members of Śląski Klub Fantastyki (Polish: &quot;Silesian Science Fiction Club&quot;), starring Jakub Ćwiek as the harlequin and Klaudia Heintze as Missy.

<text>The superposition principle, also known as superposition property, states that, for all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually. So that if input &quot;A&quot; produces response &quot;X&quot;, and input &quot;B&quot; produces response &quot;Y&quot;, then input (&quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot;) produces response (&quot;X&quot; + &quot;Y&quot;).

A function formula_1 that satisfies the superposition principle is called a linear function. Superposition can be defined by two simpler properties: additivity 
formula_2
and homogeneity
formula_3
for scalar .

This principle has many applications in physics and engineering because many physical systems can be modeled as linear systems. For example, a beam can be modeled as a linear system where the input stimulus is the load on the beam and the output response is the deflection of the beam. The importance of linear systems is that they are easier to analyze mathematically; there is a large body of mathematical techniques, frequency-domain linear transform methods such as Fourier and Laplace transforms, and linear operator theory, that are applicable. Because physical systems are generally only approximately linear, the superposition principle is only an approximation of the true physical behavior.

The superposition principle applies to &quot;any&quot; linear system, including algebraic equations, linear differential equations, and systems of equations of those forms. The stimuli and responses could be numbers, functions, vectors, vector fields, time-varying signals, or any other object that satisfies certain axioms. Note that when vectors or vector fields are involved, a superposition is interpreted as a vector sum. If the superposition holds, then it automatically also holds for all linear operations applied on these functions (due to definition), such as gradients, differentials or integrals (if they exist).

==Relation to Fourier analysis and similar methods==
By writing a very general stimulus (in a linear system) as the superposition of stimuli of a specific and simple form, often the response becomes easier to compute.

For example, in Fourier analysis, the stimulus is written as the superposition of infinitely many sinusoids. Due to the superposition principle, each of these sinusoids can be analyzed separately, and its individual response can be computed. (The response is itself a sinusoid, with the same frequency as the stimulus, but generally a different amplitude and phase.) According to the superposition principle, the response to the original stimulus is the sum (or integral) of all the individual sinusoidal responses.

As another common example, in Green&#x27;s function analysis, the stimulus is written as the superposition of infinitely many impulse functions, and the response is then a superposition of impulse responses.

Fourier analysis is particularly common for waves. For example, in electromagnetic theory, ordinary light is described as a superposition of plane waves (waves of fixed frequency, polarization, and direction). As long as the superposition principle holds (which is often but not always; see nonlinear optics), the behavior of any light wave can be understood as a superposition of the behavior of these simpler plane waves.

==Wave superposition==
 
Waves are usually described by variations in some parameters through space and time—for example, height in a water wave, pressure in a sound wave, or the electromagnetic field in a light wave. The value of this parameter is called the amplitude of the wave and the wave itself is a function specifying the amplitude at each point.

In any system with waves, the waveform at a given time is a function of the sources (i.e., external forces, if any, that create or affect the wave) and initial conditions of the system. In many cases (for example, in the classic wave equation), the equation describing the wave is linear. When this is true, the superposition principle can be applied. That means that the net amplitude caused by two or more waves traversing the same space is the sum of the amplitudes that would have been produced by the individual waves separately. For example, two waves traveling towards each other will pass right through each other without any distortion on the other side. (See image at the top.)

===Wave diffraction vs. wave interference===
With regard to wave superposition, Richard Feynman wrote:
Other authors elaborate:
Yet another source concurs:
===Wave interference===
The phenomenon of interference between waves is based on this idea. When two or more waves traverse the same space, the net amplitude at each point is the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves. In some cases, such as in noise-canceling headphones, the summed variation has a smaller amplitude than the component variations; this is called &quot;destructive interference&quot;. In other cases, such as in a line array, the summed variation will have a bigger amplitude than any of the components individually; this is called &quot;constructive interference&quot;.


===Departures from linearity===
In most realistic physical situations, the equation governing the wave is only approximately linear. In these situations, the superposition principle only approximately holds. As a rule, the accuracy of the approximation tends to improve as the amplitude of the wave gets smaller. For examples of phenomena that arise when the superposition principle does not exactly hold, see the articles nonlinear optics and nonlinear acoustics.

===Quantum superposition===
In quantum mechanics, a principal task is to compute how a certain type of wave propagates and behaves. The wave is described by a wave function, and the equation governing its behavior is called the Schrödinger equation. A primary approach to computing the behavior of a wave function is to write it as a superposition (called &quot;quantum superposition&quot;) of (possibly infinitely many) other wave functions of a certain type—stationary states whose behavior is particularly simple. Since the Schrödinger equation is linear, the behavior of the original wave function can be computed through the superposition principle this way.

The projective nature of quantum-mechanical-state space causes some confusion, because a quantum mechanical state is a &quot;ray&quot; in projective Hilbert space, not a &quot;vector&quot;.
According to Dirac: &quot;&quot;if the ket vector corresponding to a state is multiplied by any complex number, not zero, the resulting ket vector will correspond to the same state&quot; [italics in original].&quot;
However, the sum of two rays to compose a superpositioned ray is undefined. As a result, Dirac himself
uses ket vector representations of states to decompose or split,
for example, a ket vector formula_4
into superposition of component ket vectors formula_5 as:
formula_6
where the formula_7.
The equivalence class of the formula_4 allows a well-defined meaning to be given to the relative phases of the formula_9., but an absolute (same amount
for all the formula_9) phase change on the formula_9
does not affect the equivalence class of the formula_4.

There are exact correspondences between the superposition presented in the main on this page and the quantum superposition.
For example, the Bloch sphere to represent pure state of a two-level quantum mechanical system
(qubit) is also known as the Poincaré sphere representing different types of classical
pure polarization states.

Nevertheless, on the topic of quantum superposition, Kramers writes: &quot;The principle of [quantum] superposition ... has no analogy in classical physics&quot;.
According to Dirac: &quot;&quot;the superposition that occurs in quantum mechanics is of an essentially different nature from any occurring in the classical theory&quot; [italics in original].&quot;
Though reasoning by Dirac includes atomicity of observation, which is valid, as for phase,
they actually mean phase translation symmetry derived from time translation symmetry, which is also
applicable to classical states, as shown above with classical polarization states.

==Boundary-value problems==
A common type of boundary value problem is (to put it abstractly) finding a function &quot;y&quot; that satisfies some equation
formula_13
with some boundary specification
formula_14
For example, in Laplace&#x27;s equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, &quot;F&quot; would be the Laplacian operator in a region &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot; would be an operator that restricts &quot;y&quot; to the boundary of &quot;R&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; would be the function that &quot;y&quot; is required to equal on the boundary of &quot;R&quot;.

In the case that &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are both linear operators, then the superposition principle says that a superposition of solutions to the first equation is another solution to the first equation:
formula_15
while the boundary values superpose:
formula_16
Using these facts, if a list can be compiled of solutions to the first equation, then these solutions can be carefully put into a superposition such that it will satisfy the second equation. This is one common method of approaching boundary-value problems.

==Additive state decomposition==

Consider a simple linear system:
formula_17

By superposition principle, the system can be decomposed into
formula_18
with
formula_19

Superposition principle is only available for linear systems. However, the additive state decomposition can be applied to both linear and nonlinear systems. Next, consider a nonlinear system
formula_20
where formula_21 is a nonlinear function. By the additive state decomposition, the system can be additively decomposed into
formula_22
with
formula_19

This decomposition can help to simplify controller design.

==Other example applications==
* In electrical engineering, in a linear circuit, the input (an applied time-varying voltage signal) is related to the output (a current or voltage anywhere in the circuit) by a linear transformation. Thus, a superposition (i.e., sum) of input signals will yield the superposition of the responses.
* In physics, Maxwell&#x27;s equations imply that the (possibly time-varying) distributions of charges and currents are related to the electric and magnetic fields by a linear transformation. Thus, the superposition principle can be used to simplify the computation of fields that arise from a given charge and current distribution. The principle also applies to other linear differential equations arising in physics, such as the heat equation.
* In engineering, superposition is used to solve for beam and structure deflections of combined loads when the effects are linear (i.e., each load does not affect the results of the other loads, and the effect of each load does not significantly alter the geometry of the structural system). Mode superposition method uses the natural frequencies and mode shapes to characterize the dynamic response of a linear structure.
* In hydrogeology, the superposition principle is applied to the drawdown of two or more water wells pumping in an ideal aquifer. This principle is used in the analytic element method to develop analytical elements capable of being combined in a single model.
* In process control, the superposition principle is used in model predictive control.
* The superposition principle can be applied when small deviations from a known solution to a nonlinear system are analyzed by linearization.

==History==

According to Léon Brillouin, the principle of superposition was first stated by Daniel Bernoulli in 1753: &quot;The general motion of a vibrating system is given by a superposition of its proper vibrations.&quot; The principle was rejected by Leonhard Euler and then by Joseph Lagrange. Bernoulli argued that any sonorous body could vibrate in a series of simple modes with a well-defined frequency of oscillation. As he had earlier indicated, these modes could be superposed to produce more complex vibrations. In his reaction to Bernoulli&#x27;s memoirs, Euler praised his colleague for having best developed the physical part of the problem of vibrating strings, but denied the generality and superiority of the multi-modes solution.

Later it became accepted, largely through the work of Joseph Fourier.

<doc id="1201324" wikidata="Q3002754" url="?curid=1201324" title="Shell Crisis of 1915">
<text>The Shell Crisis of 1915 was a shortage of artillery shells on the front lines in the First World War that led to a political crisis in the United Kingdom. Previous military experience led to an over-reliance on shrapnel to attack infantry in the open, which was negated by the resort to trench warfare, for which high-explosive shells were better suited. At the start of the war there was a revolution in doctrine: instead of the idea that artillery was a useful support for infantry attacks, the new doctrine held that heavy guns alone would control the battlefield. Because of the stable lines on the Western Front, it was easy to build railway lines that delivered all the shells the factories could produce. The &#x27;shell scandal&#x27; emerged in 1915 because the high rate of fire over a long period was not anticipated and the stock of shells became depleted. The inciting incident was the disastrous Battle of Aubers, which reportedly had been stymied by a lack of shells.

The shortage was widely publicised in the press. &quot;The Times&quot;, in cooperation with David Lloyd George and Lord Northcliffe, sought to force Parliament to adopt a national munitions policy with centralised control. This resulted in a transfer of the Munitions Department from the War Office to a cabinet level position in government, and a coalition government with Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions. In 1916 the long-term effects included the fall of the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and his replacement by Lloyd George in December 1916.

== &quot;The Times&quot; attacks Kitchener ==
Shortage of ammunition had been a serious problem since the autumn of 1914 and the British Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Sir John French gave an interview to &quot;The Times&quot; (27 March) calling for more ammunition. On the basis of an assurance from Kitchener, Asquith stated in a speech at Newcastle (20 April) that the army had sufficient ammunition.

After the failed attack at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915, &quot;The Times&quot; war correspondent, Colonel Charles à Court Repington, sent a telegram to his newspaper blaming lack of high-explosive shells. French had, despite Repington’s denial of his prior knowledge at the time, supplied him with information and sent Brinsley Fitzgerald and Freddie Guest to London to show the same documents to Lloyd George and senior Conservatives Bonar Law and Arthur Balfour.

&quot;The Times&quot; headline on 14 May 1915, was: &quot;Need for shells: British attacks checked: Limited supply the cause: A Lesson From France&quot;. It commented &quot;We had not sufficient high explosives to lower the enemy&#x27;s parapets to the ground ... The want of an unlimited supply of high explosives was a fatal bar to our success&quot;, blaming the government for the battle&#x27;s failure. However, due to his reputation, the British public were hesitant to question Kitchener, leading to the subsequent circulation decline of the newspapers despite the growing consensus that the political role was ill-suited.

== Coalition government ==
As the crisis continued, the immediate catalyst for a change in government was the resignation on 15 May of Admiral Fisher as First Sea Lord, owing to disagreements with his ministerial chief, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, over the naval attack on the Dardanelles (a precursor to the subsequent stalemated landings at Gallipoli). Churchill was detested by the Conservatives as he had defected from their party over a decade earlier. Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George and Conservative Leader Bonar Law visited Asquith on 17 May 1915, and after a very brief meeting Asquith wrote to his ministers demanding their resignations, then formed a new coalition government in which he appointed Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions, heading a newly-created government department.

The Shells Crisis had allowed Lloyd George to push for a coalition in which the Liberal Party relinquished their full control while the Conservatives remained in a subordinate position.

Since then no purely Liberal government has held office in the UK, although Liberal politicians have held office in subsequent coalitions.

== &quot;Daily Mail&quot; attacks Kitchener ==
Whilst Asquith was still forming his new government, a sensational version of the press criticism was printed in the popular &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 21 May, blaming Kitchener, under the headline &quot;The Shells Scandal: Lord Kitchener’s Tragic Blunder&quot;. Lloyd George had to warn Northcliffe that the campaign was counterproductive and creating sympathy for Kitchener. Kitchener wanted to let the Shells Scandal drop. Stanley Brenton von Donop, Master-General of the Ordnance, demanded an Inquiry to clear his name but Kitchener persuaded him to withdraw the request as it would have led to French’s dismissal.

Kitchener, popular with the public, remained in office as Secretary of State for War, responsible for training and equipping the volunteer New Armies, but lost control over munitions production and was increasingly sidelined from control of military strategy. French was also tarnished by his blatant meddling in politics, a factor which contributed to his enforced resignation in December 1915.

==Ministry of Munitions==

The Munitions of War Act 1915 ended the shell crisis and guaranteed a supply of munitions that the Germans were unable to match. The government policy, according to J. A. R. Marriott, was that,

No private interest was to be permitted to obstruct the service, or imperil the safety, of the State. Trade Union regulations must be suspended; employers&#x27; profits must be limited, skilled men must fight, if not in the trenches, in the factories; man-power must be economised by the dilution of labour and the employment of women; private factories must pass under the control of the State, and new national factories be set up. Results justified the new policy: the output was prodigious; the goods were at last delivered.

Following the creation of the Ministry of Munitions, new factories began to be built for the mass production of war materiel. The construction of these factories took time and to ensure that there was no delay in the production of munitions to deal with the Shell Crisis, the Government turned to railway companies to manufacture materials of war. Railway companies were well placed to manufacture munitions and other war materials, with their large locomotive, carriage works and skilled labourers; by the end of 1915 the railway companies were producing between 1,000 and 5,000 6-inch high explosive shells per week.

As well as the components for a number of different types of shell, the railway companies, under the direction of the Railway War Manufactures Sub-Committee of the Railway Executive Committee, produced mountings for larger artillery, water-tank carts, miners&#x27; trucks, heavy-capacity wagons, machinery for howitzer carriages, armoured trains and ambulances. In 1916, when the many factories being constructed by the Ministry of Munitions began producing large volumes of munitions, the work of the railway companies in producing war materials actually increased and they continued to produce high volumes of munitions throughout the war. The official record, presented to the government in May 1920, of the munitions work done throughout the war by the various railway companies ran to a total of 121 pages, giving some idea of the scale of what was undertaken by the railway companies across the country. Many of the companies undertook this vital war work to the detriment of the maintenance of their locomotives, carriages and wagons.

The Munitions of War Act 1915 prevented the resignation of munitions workers without their employer&#x27;s consent. It was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be mobilised for the war effort if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front. Supplies and factories in British Commonwealth countries, particularly Canada, were reorganised under the Imperial Munitions Board, to supply adequate shells and other materiel for the remainder of the war. The Health of Munitions Workers Committee, one of the first investigations into occupational safety and health, was set up in 1915 to improve productivity in factories.
 A huge munitions factory, HM Factory, Gretna was built on the English-Scottish border to produce cordite. There were at least three major explosions in such factories:

# An explosion at Faversham involving 200 tons of TNT killed 105 in 1916.
# The National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell exploded in 1918, killing 137.
# The Silvertown explosion occurred in Silvertown (now part of the London Borough of Newham, in Greater London) killing 73 and injuring 400 on Friday, 19 January 1917 at 6.52 pm.

<doc id="1201325" wikidata="Q2165600" url="?curid=1201325" title="Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing">
<text>Ronald Ernest Dearing, Baron Dearing, (27 July 1930 – 19 February 2009) was a senior civil servant before becoming chairman and chief executive of the Post Office Ltd.

==Early life==
Dearing attended Willerby Carr Lane County Primary School before going on to Malet Lambert Grammar School. At the University of Hull, he gained a BSc in Economics in 1954 during a two-year break from the Ministry of Power.

==Career==
Dearing joined the civil service as a 16-year-old clerical officer in 1946. By 1967, aged 37, he was one of the two deputy heads of the coal division of the Ministry of Power, with the rank of assistant secretary. 

In 1967 Dearing had responsibility for two major issues arising from the 1966 Aberfan disaster, in which a huge coal waste tip collapsed onto the town of Aberfan in Wales, killing 144 people including 116 school children. Dearing briefed the then Minister, Richard Marsh on the question of the possible removal of Lord Robens as chair of the National Coal Board in the wake of the damning Davies Report, which found the Coal Board wholly responsible for the disaster, and on the issue of the removal of the remaining tips above the town. He became North East regional director of the Department of Trade and Industry in 1972.

He was chairman and chief executive of the Post Office Board from 1980 and 1987 and chairman of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) from 1987 to 1988.

He was chairman of Ufi Ltd between 1998 and 2001, and their Sheffield based head office is named Dearing House after him.

In 2009, just before his death, Dearing co-founded with Kenneth Baker the Baker Dearing Educational Trust, a charity made to support university technical colleges in England.

==University of Nottingham==
He was later the fifth Chancellor of the University of Nottingham (1993–2000) and the author of the Dearing Report into Higher Education. The annual teaching awards at Nottingham (initiated in 1999) are named after Lord Dearing, as is a more recent series of teaching fellowships. The main education building on the Jubilee Campus is also named after him. The name &quot;Dearing Report&quot; is also applied to the 2001 report which he chaired: &quot;The Way Ahead: Church of England schools in the new millennium&quot;.

==Personal life==
He married Margaret Patricia Riley in 1954.

==Recognition==
In the 1979 New Year Honours, Dearing was appointed to the Order of the Bath as a Companion (CB) and in the 1984 Birthday Honours, Dearing was knighted and the Queen conferred the honour upon him on 21 August 1984. In 1992 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

In the 1998 New Year Honours, he was announced to be a life peer and was raised to the peerage as Baron Dearing, of Kingston upon Hull in the County of the East Riding of Yorkshire.

In 2000, Lord Dearing visited Malet Lambert School Language College, Kingston upon Hull, to open a new building constructed for the use of science and geography, it being named the Dearing Centre. Similarly, in 2004, he visited Hymers College, Kingston upon Hull, whereupon he opened the new science block with the purpose of educating the children in the areas of physics and chemistry. The Dearing Building on the University of Nottingham&#x27;s Jubilee Campus is named after this former chancellor of the university.

<text>Paul John Weitz (; born November 19, 1965) is an American screenwriter, director and producer. He is the older brother of filmmaker Chris Weitz. Together they worked on the comedy films &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;About a Boy&quot;; for the latter, they were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Weitz is also a writer, executive producer, and director of the Amazon Prime Video dramedy series &quot;Mozart in the Jungle&quot;.

== Early life ==
Weitz was born in New York City, the son of actress Susan Kohner and Berlin-born novelist/menswear designer John Weitz. His brother is filmmaker Chris Weitz. Weitz is the grandson of Czech-born agent and producer Paul Kohner and actress Lupita Tovar on his maternal side. Tovar, who was from Oaxaca City, Mexico, starred in &quot;Santa&quot;, Mexico&#x27;s first talkie, in 1932, as well as a Mexican version of &quot;Drácula&quot;. Weitz&#x27; paternal grandparents escaped Nazi Germany, where his grandfather had been a successful textile manufacturer, and family intimates of Christopher Isherwood and Marlene Dietrich.

Weitz&#x27;s father and maternal grandfather were Jewish, whereas his maternal grandmother was Catholic. He was raised in a nonreligious household.

Weitz attended the Allen-Stevenson School with his brother and Collegiate. In 1988, he graduated from Wesleyan University. While at Wesleyan, Weitz studied under film instructor Jeanine Basinger.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Weitz&#x27; early career involved many collaborations with his brother. Some of the work they have done as screenwriters has been both credited and uncredited.

Weitz began his film career as a co-writer on the 1998 animated film &quot;Antz&quot;. He followed this with work on various sitcoms such as &quot;Off Centre&quot; and the 1998 revival of the 1977 series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. In 1999, he and Chris directed and produced &quot;American Pie&quot;, which was written by Adam Herz, and became a major box office success. Weitz returned as executive producer on the film&#x27;s two theatrical sequels.

In 2002, the Weitz brothers co-wrote and co-directed &quot;About a Boy&quot;, the Hugh Grant film based on the book by Nick Hornby. The film was originally set up at New Line Cinema with Robert De Niro producing, and the main character as an American. The brothers felt that it was important that the character is British. Inspiration came from the film &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1960). They were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Weitz has written and directed the well-received romantic comedy &quot;In Good Company&quot; and the political satire &quot;American Dreamz&quot;, which faced mixed reviews. Additional writing credits include the television show &quot;Cracking Up&quot;.

He has also directed an adaptation of Darren Shan&#x27;s young adult novel &quot;Cirque du Freak&quot; called &quot;The Vampire&#x27;s Assistant&quot;. He directed the film &quot;Little Fockers&quot; (2010), the sequel to &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;.

Subsequently he wrote and directed &quot;Being Flynn&quot;, an adaptation of Nick Flynn&#x27;s memoir &quot;Another Bullshit Night in Suck City&quot;, starring Robert De Niro. Weitz said he worked collaboratively with Flynn to translate the dense original source material into its film adaptation.

Weitz also directed the movie &quot;Admission&quot;, starring Tina Fey.

=== &quot;Grandma&quot; ===
In 2015, Weitz directed the film, &quot;Grandma&quot;, which starred Lily Tomlin. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival on January 30, as the closing night film. The film was Tomlin&#x27;s first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the comedy film &quot;Big Business&quot; (1988). It is the second collaboration between Tomlin and Weitz, who previously directed her in his film &quot;Admission&quot; (2013). The film was released on August 21, 2015, by Sony Pictures Classics.

Weitz had the story idea for many years, but it never fully formed until he met and worked with Tomlin on &quot;Admission&quot;, saying that &quot;After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had thought about it for years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand.&quot;

Weitz said the film cost under $600,000 to make. It was well received.

=== In development ===
Weitz has a production company with his brother Chris Weitz and producer Andrew Miano called Depth of Field. In March 2016, Weitz and his brother signed a two-year first look deal with Amazon Studios.
* A live-action adaptation Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric saga, which his brother Chris said he enjoyed as a child. Weitz&#x27;s Depth of Field production company was meant to create the films as a potential trilogy for Universal Pictures. In a May 2007 interview with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine Weitz&#x27;s brother announced that he had met with Moorcock, who trusted him with the films, and described his wish for Paul to direct the film.
* &quot;Shield of Straw&quot; – producing an English remake of the 2013 Japanese action thriller, &quot;Shield of Straw&quot;
* &quot;Ghost Train&quot; – producing a remake of the 2006 Japanese horror film, &quot;Soul Reviver&quot;
* &quot;Birthright&quot; – producing a remake of the 2010 Japanese thriller
* &quot;Sinatoro&quot; – producing TV series with Grant Morrison for Universal Television

== Playwright ==
While in college at Wesleyan, Weitz wrote the play &quot;Mango Tea&quot;, which was performed Off-Broadway.

Weitz has written a number of plays, including &quot;Roulette&quot;, &quot;Privilege&quot;, &quot;Show People&quot; and &quot;Trust&quot;, all of which have been produced Off-Broadway in New York City. &quot;Trust&quot; starred Zach Braff, Bobby Cannavale, Sutton Foster, and Ari Graynor, and was directed by Peter DuBois at Second Stage Theatre. It will be produced in Brazil, Germany and Greece in 2013. Second Stage previously produced &quot;Privilege&quot; and &quot;Show People&quot; and produced &quot;Lonely, I&#x27;m Not&quot;, starring Topher Grace and Olivia Thirlby a new comedy by Weitz in 2012. &quot;Lonely, I&#x27;m Not&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; critics pick.

As a writer, Weitz has discussed semi-jokingly the fact that he avoids the discomfort in his life by turning to the act of writing. He sees a good play structure as being very different from a good film structure, and thinks that it is rare for plays as source material to be easily adapted into film.

== Personal life ==
In 2001, Weitz married novelist Patricia Brown, with whom he has three children.

<doc id="1201336" wikidata="Q704836" url="?curid=1201336" title="Jens Hundseid">
<text>Jens Valentinsen Hundseid (6 May 1883 – 2 April 1965) was a Norwegian politician from the Agrarian Party. He was a member of the Norwegian parliament from 1924 to 1940 and the prime minister of Norway from 1932 to 1933.

Hundseid felt forced to join Nasjonal Samling who supported the Nazis in 1940, a choice he later called &quot;cowardly&quot;. In the legal purge in Norway following World War II he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Pardoned in 1949 he lived a recluse in Oslo until his death in 1965.

==Early life, education and civil career==
Hundseid was born at the farm Hundseid in Vikedal which had belonged to his mother&#x27;s family for generations. He studies at a local agricultural school and later at the Agricultural University of Norway. where he was together with Jon Sundby and Håkon Five was among the top students. After he finished his studies in 1905, he worked at lower secondary schools to 1908 when he became a research fellow at the Agricultural University and he briefly studied agriculture in England and Scotland in 1911. He worked as a teacher at Sem Agricultural school 1910-1912 and Telemark Agricultural School 1912-1913. He was editor of Eidsvold Blad 1916-1918 and combined this with working as a teacher at Eidsvoll folk high school. He became head of Telemark Agricultural School in 1918. Having married a farmer&#x27;s daughter in 1912, he also ran his wife&#x27;s family farm after 1913.

==Politics==
According to Halvdan Koht who knew Kolseid when he was young, he was initially conservative and later sympathized with the Liberal Party. He became a member of the Farmer&#x27;s Party when it was formed in 1920.

He candidated for the Norwegian Agrarian Association in the 1918 Norwegian parliamentary election and for the Farmer&#x27;s Party in the 1921 election, both times without getting elected. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway for the Centre Party from Telemark in the 1924 parliamentary election.

In the Parliament he served as member of the Committee on Social Affairs from 1924 to 1931. Later he would become member of the Committee on Forestry and Watercourses and in 1937 a member of the Committee on University and Higher Education.

He became a member of the Executive Board of the Farmer&#x27;s Party in 1926 and the same year elected deputy leader under Kristoffer Høgset. In 1929, he became leader of the party, a position he held to 1938. He also served as parliamentarian leader of the Farmer&#x27;s Party from 1931 to 1940, with the exception of the period 1932-1933 when he served as prime minister. He was credited within the party for being a good administrator.

As a member of the Social Committee, Hundseid came in opposition to the Labour Party on unemployment issues, where he often argued that the unemployed could do more to get a job and believed economic support for them should mostly be restricted to food stations. His relationship with the Liberal Party and its leader Johan Ludwig Mowinckel was also often tense.

==Prime minister and return to parliament==

When the Farmer&#x27;s Party formed its first cabinet in 1931, Peder Kolstad was chosen as prime minister instead of Jens Hundseid who was seen as too controversial for the role. He wasn&#x27;t included in the cabinet either. However, when Kolstad died the following year, Hundseid was appointed prime minister in March 1932 and formed the Hundseid&#x27;s Cabinet, mostly with the same ministers as in the preceding Kolstad Cabinet. In addition to the position as prime minister, Hundseid also served as Minister of Agriculture. Hundseid didn&#x27;t want Minister of Defence Vidkun Quisling to continue in the cabinet but Quisling argued hard to keep it and was supported by many other ministers. He was included in the cabinet, but had a difficult relationship to Hundseid from the start.

In April 1932, Quisling strongly attacked the Labour Party in the trontale (opening secession debate) in the Parliament. The Labour Party responded by a motion of no-confidence against the cabinet, but did not gain majority for the motion.

In summer 1932, diplomat Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg secretly gave authorization from Hundseid to negotiate the Eastern Greenland dispute with Denmark. In October, he returned to Norway with a proposal to a treaty where Norway gave up the claim of sovereignty of Eastern Greenland, but was granted economic rights to fishing and trapping in the area. The negotiations was not publicly known before the Summer 1933 when Norway lost the dispute in the International Court of Justice and Hundseid who then had resigned as Prime Minister was sharply criticized in the Parliament for having permitted the negotiations.

The Hundseid cabinet fell in March 1933 when the Labour Party and the Liberal Party both supported a motion of no-confidence over the cabinet&#x27;s economic politics. It was replaced by Mowinckel&#x27;s Third Cabinet. Hundseid went back to his prior role as parliamentarian leader in the Parliament in addition to being the party&#x27;s leader.

==Nasjonal Samling membership and conviction after WWII==
After the German occupation of Norway in April 1940, Hundseid was approached during the summer by a representative from Reichskommissariat Norwegen who wanted Hundseid to lead a new organization for farmers which was meant to replace the Norwegian Agrarian Association. Hudseid declined the offer. In the autumn, he was called to a meeting with Nasjonal Samling councillor of state Sverre Riisnæs. In a follow-up meeting, Riisnæs gave Hundseid a declaration written by Quisling which he wanted Hundseid to sign. Hundseid signed a somewhat moderated statement where he declared he would become a member of Nasjonal Samling and be writing newspaper contributions in favour of NS. While Hudseid distanced himself from Nasjonal Samling and fascism after the war, he also had a track record of stark, antisemitic statements, including claims that jews were &quot;not real Norwegians&quot;

After the liberation of Norway on 8 May 1945, Hundseid was arrested the following day. During the legal purge he was charged with five crimes:
*Treason, for having joined Nasjonal Samling after the occupation.
*Tried to pressure members of the administration in Buskerud to become members of Nasjonal Samling.
*Written two articles in &quot;Buskerud Blad&quot; and &quot;Fritt Folk&quot; which was published in 1940 where he encouraged people generally to become members of Nasjonal Samling
*In a circular to mayors in Buskerud encouraged them to collaborate with Nasjonal Samling.
*Granted 5,000 Norwegian kroner to the surviving family members of Norwegians who had fought for Germany on the Eastern Front.

Despite his record of antisemtism, some historians regard him as a mostly passive member of Nasjonal Samling.

In the &quot;lagmannsrett&quot;, he was found guilty and sentenced to twelve years of penal labour, confiscation of ca. 54,000 Nkr and to pay a compensation of 25,000 Nkr to the government. The Supreme court reduced the sentence to ten years of penal labour and also reduced the confiscation amount.

He was released in 1949, having been imprisoned for four years.

==Later years==
Hundseid died in Oslo on 2 April 1965. He was buried at Komnes churchyard in Sandsvær, now part of Kongsberg.

<text>Ivar Lykke (9 January 1872, Trondheim – 4 December 1949, Trondheim) was a Norwegian politician from the Conservative Party, who served as the prime minister of Norway from 1926 to 1928. He was also president of the Storting from 1919 to 1927.

==World War Two==
Lykke was a member of the parliament&#x27;s presidium in 1940; he stepped in (according to mandate) for president in exile, C. J. Hambro.

On 27 June 1940 Lykke, and others of parliament&#x27;s presidium, signed an appeal to King Haakon VII, about [the desire for] his abdication. (The presidium back then consisted of the presidents and vicepresidents of parliament, Odelstinget and Lagtinget.)

==1945==
After World War Two, he and others were criticized (for actions in 1940) by a parliamentary fact-finding commission.

==Visit by King Haakon==
By 1947 he was still being treated for cancer.

During King Haakon&#x27;s visit that year to Trondheim, he diverged from his official program to visit Lykke. Lykke said &quot;Thou can believe that we had it difficult here in Norway in the summer of 1940&quot;. The king replied, &quot;That is exactly why I am coming to You, dear Ivar Lykke&quot;, and stretched forward his hand&quot; [for greeting].

<text>Abraham Theodor Berge (20 August 1851 – 10 July 1936) was the prime minister of Norway from 1923 to 1924. He was a teacher and civil servant who represented the Liberal Party, the social liberal party, and later Free-minded Liberal Party, a right-of-centre party.

==Biography==
Berge was born at Lyngdal in Lister og Mandals amt (present-day Vest-Agder), Norway . He was the son of Johan Tobias Johnsen Berge (1813–1883) and Helene Andreasdatter Kvalsvig. He attended the teacher&#x27;s course offered by Reinert Rødland in Lyngdal. In 1867, Berge became teacher at the Nordbygda skole in Vanse. He also served as sheriff in Vanse from 1904 to 1908. In 1908, Berge was appointed County Governor of Jarlsberg og Larvik amt, a position he held until 1924.

Berge started his political career in Lista in the present-day municipality of Farsund, where he was in 1882 elected mayor. From here he went on to the Norwegian Parliament in 1891. He served, in different periods, as both Minister of Culture and Church Affairs and Minister of Finance. Then, after a 10-year absence from politics, he became again Minister of Finance, and later also Prime Minister, when sitting Prime Minister Otto Bahr Halvorsen died. He resigned this post as the result of the defeat in a vote to lift prohibition.

In 1926 he became the only Norwegian prime minister to ever be impeached. The charge was withholding information relating to the government rescue of a bank threatened by bankruptcy. However, he was acquitted in 1927, along with the six ministers who stood trial alongside him.

<doc id="1201340" wikidata="Q1565745" url="?curid=1201340" title="Shakti (band)">
<text>Shakti is a fusion band formed by English guitarist John McLaughlin and Indian violinist L. Shankar with percussionists Zakir Hussain (on tabla) and T. H. &quot;Vikku&quot; Vinayakram (on ghatam). The original lineup, formed in 1973, consisted of John McLaughlin on guitar, L. Shankar on violin and R. Raghavan on mridangam, initially under the name &quot;Turiyananda Sangit&quot; (which translates in English to &quot;The pinnacle delight in music&quot;). Zakir Hussain was later added on tabla and the name was changed to Shakti (meaning &quot;creative intelligence, beauty, and power.&quot;) as the band members wanted a name that “listeners in the West could relate to”. Raghavan didn&#x27;t stay with the project and TH Vikku Vinayakaram was added on ghatam for the remainder of those Shakti days. The band played acoustic fusion music which combined Indian music with elements of jazz. 

In addition to fusing Western and Eastern music, Shakti also represented a fusion of the Hindustani and Carnatic music traditions, since Hussain was from the north region of India while L. Shankar and T. H. &quot;Vikku&quot; Vinayakram are from the South.

The group came together in 1973, after the dissolution of the first incarnation of the Mahavishnu Orchestra, and toured fairly extensively during the period 1975-1977. After 1977, the albums which L. Shankar recorded with Z. Hussain and T. H. &quot;Vikku&quot; Vinayakram stayed close to the music made popular by Shakti.

Two concerts at the Montreux Jazz Festival (July 6, 1976 and July 8, 1977) are included among the 17 CDs of the box set &quot;Montreux Concerts&quot; by John McLaughlin.

Between 1982 - 1984, Shakti regrouped for a reunion tour in India, this time with Shankar performing on the double violin. 

In 1997, McLaughlin and Hussain put together another band with the same concept, called Remember Shakti, including V. Selvaganesh (son of T. H. &quot;Vikku&quot; Vinayakram ), mandolin player U. Shrinivas and eventually Shankar Mahadevan.

The band reformed in 2020, and released their first album as Shakti in 46 years, &quot;This Moment&quot;, on 23 June 2023. The album will be supported by a world tour including India, Europe, and United States under the name Shakti50. Violinist Ganesh Rajagopalan joined the band as a full time member. The band also performed a live set for the Tiny Desk Concert. 

In 2024, Shakti won the &quot;Grammy Award&quot; for the Best Global Music Album for the album &quot;This Moment&quot;.

<text>Gunnar Knudsen (19 September 1848 – 1 December 1928), born Aanon Gunerius Knudsen, was a Norwegian politician from the Liberal Party who served as the prime minister of Norway twice from 1908 to 1910 and from 1913 to 1920. He also inherited a shipping company, and founded the shipping company Borgestad ASA.
== Early life and education ==
Knudsen was born in 1848 at the medium-sized farm Saltrød at Stokken (now Arendal) in Aust-Agder. Norway. His father Christen Knudsen (1813–1888) was a sea captain and ship-owner, whose ancestors had lived at the farm for several generations. His mother Guro Aadnesdatter (1808–1900) had grown up at one of the smaller farms in Saltrød which her father which hailed from Vegusdal had bought. A brother of Gunnar died in 1855, his two living siblings were Jørgen Christian Knudsen (born 1843) and Ellen Serine (born 1846) who married Johan Jeremiassen (he also had four sisters ).

Christen Knudsen established a shipyard in Arendal in 1851, but in 1855 he and the family moved to Frednes in Porsgrunn.
Gunnar Knudsen started studying at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1865 where he got a degree as engineer in 1867.

==Business career==
Returning to Norway, he started working at Aker&#x27;s Mechanical Workshop and then went to England where he studied ship building technics at Piles Shipyard in Sunderland. The first ship he designed for the family&#x27;s shipyard was &quot;Gambetta&quot;, named after the French politician Léon Gambetta. It was launched in 1871. The stay in England convinced Knudsen that the days of sail ships would soon be over and that the family business needed to start building steam ships in the future.

Gunnar and his brother Jørgen Christian took over the shipyard from their father in 1872. In the following years they would also take over ships their father owned and the brothers formed a shipyard and shipping company together: J.C. og G. Knudsen. In the period until 1879, Knudsen designed five ships for the company. He named the fifth &quot;Crossroad&quot;; it was the last sail ship he designed. In 1904, he merged his interests in three steam ship companies into Borgestad Shipping AS.
==Political career==
In 1886, he became the mayor of Gjerpen and in 1891 elected governor of Telemark. In 1891 Knudsen was elected to the Storting, becoming parliamentary leader in 1908 and party leader from 1909 to 1927. He was elected Prime Minister in 1908 and 1913. In social policy, Knudsen&#x27;s time as prime minister saw the passage of the Sickness insurance Law of September 1909, which provided compulsory coverage for employees and workers below a certain income limit, representing approximately 45% of all wage earners. That same year, the state approved free midwife services for unmarried mothers. In 1915, free midwife services were extended to the wives of men included under the national health insurance scheme.

==Personal life==
Gunnar Knudsen married Anna Sofie Cappelen (1854–1915) in 1880, and together they had five children, born between 1882 and 1893; Erik, Christen, Gudrun, Margit and Rolf. Margit, married Schiøtt, was elected to the national parliament in 1945. Christen Knudsen had a son Knut Andreas Knudsen who became a politician as well.

<text>Jens Kristian Meinich Bratlie (17 January 1856 – 15 September 1939) was a Norwegian attorney and military officer. He served as an elected official representing the Conservative Party. He was the prime minister of Norway from 1912 to 1913.

==Biography==
Jens Bratlie was born at Nordre Land in Oppland, Norway. Bratlie came from a family of leading businessmen and civil servant. He was the son of Erik Bratlie (1814-1890) and wife Bolette Sofie Meinich (1821-1870). Following the death of his mother, he was adopted by the industrialist Jørgen Meinich.

Bratlie graduated from the Military High School in 1880 and was trained as an army officer (eventually rising to the level of Major General). He also earned a law degree allowing him to work as a high-ranking civil servant (1886). He served several years as expedition secretary in the Department of Defense. He became Captain (1893), General Commission Commissioner (1898) and General Attorney for the Armenian Judiciary from 1906.

Bratlie held several offices such as leader of the Conservative Party (1910–11) and president of the Storting (1910–12). He was in the Storting representing Kristiania (now Oslo) 1900-12 and 1916–18. He served as Norwegian Minister of Defence and Minister of Auditing from 1912 to 1913.
In the 1927 Norwegian parliamentary election he was the fourth ballot candidate for the party National Legion, behind Karl Meyer, Frøis Frøisland and Thorvald Aadahl. In a press release, the National Legion (led by Meyer) stated that it had cherry picked &quot;strong&quot; personalities to combat the hardships in Norwegian politics. Frøisland denounced the ballot in an &quot;Aftenposten&quot; piece, stating that himself, Aadahl and Bratlie was unwilling and unaware of the nomination. He stated that a vote for the National Legion would be a wasted vote in the struggle against the &quot;communists&quot;. However, according to Norwegian election law the people who were listed on the ballot had no legal grounds to avoid being nominated.

He served as chairman of the Conservative Party from 1911 to 1919. Following his death in 1939, his interment was at Vår Frelsers gravlund.

<doc id="1201345" wikidata="Q470964" url="?curid=1201345" title="Wollert Konow (prime minister)">
<text>Wollert Konow (16 August 1845 – 15 March 1924) was the prime minister of Norway from 1910 to 1912. He was the leader of a coalition cabinet. Konow&#x27;s time as prime minister saw the extension of accident insurance to seamen in 1911.

==Background==
Konow was born in the borough of Fana in the city of Bergen, Norway. He was the son of Wollert Konow (1809–1881) and Marie Louise Oehlenschläger (1818–1910). His father was a writer and elected official. In 1842 his parents had purchased the historic Stend Manor in Fana where Wollert Konow was born. 
Wollert Konow was a grandson of the noted Danish poet and playwright Adam Oehlenschlager (1779–1850).

He was a student at Bergen Cathedral School. After graduating in 1864, Konow went to the Royal Frederick University in Christiania. He began to study law which he never completed. In 1868, he started a school at Halsnøy in Sunnhordland where he was both teacher and head manager until 1872. In 1873 Konow took over operation of the mill at Stend and expanded the estate by acquiring neighboring properties.

==Career==
Wollert Konow was mayor of Fana most of the time between 1880 and 1901, and was in 1877–1879 Deputy to the Parliament for Søndre Bergenhus amt (now Hordaland). He served as Minister of Agriculture in 1910 and Minister of Auditing 1910-1912. He was Odelsting president 1884–1887 and President of the Storting in 1888 and again from 1897 to 1899. He was a central board member of the Liberal Left Party from 1909 to 1912. Wollert Konow served as Prime Minister over a two-year period as leader of a coalition which combined elements of two competing parties; &quot;Høgre&quot; and &quot;Frisindede Venstre&quot;. Konow&#x27;s coalition government came to an end in 1912 after he declared his sympathies for the rural language form &quot;Landsmål&quot; during the height of the Norwegian language conflict causing conflict with &quot;Riksmål&quot; supporters.
After loss in the election in 1912, Konow was out of politics for good, and he spent the remainder of his life at Stend.

He was commonly referred to as Wollert Konow (SB) to differentiate him from Wollert Konow (H) who was his cousin and contemporary politician from Hedemark. The initials &quot;SB&quot; stood for &quot;Søndre Bergenhus,&quot; the now-defunct constituency Konow represented in national politics.

==Personal life==
In 1875, he married Fredrikke Wilhelmine Kooter (1854-1935), who was the daughter of Jacob Blaauw Kooter (1818-1887) and Marie Frederikke Balchen (1817-1883).
Konow was alternate member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, 1913 to 1922 and Member of the Committee from 1922 until he died at Stend in Fana during 1924.

==Stend Manor==
Stend Manor (&quot;Stend hovedgård&quot;) was a historic estate which had belonged to Nonneseter Abbey of Bergen during the Middle Ages. 
Around 1682, the main building was built in timber as a single-story with three wings.
In 1842, Dr. Wollert Konow acquired Stend.
In 1861, Stend was bought by Søndre Bergenhus (now Hordaland) county.
Since then, it has housed an agricultural school.
Under the direction of architect Erlend Tryti (1885-1962) extensive renovation and restoration work was carried out in the years 1921-1922.
The main building were restored in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

<text>The repertory grid is an interviewing technique which uses nonparametric factor analysis to determine an idiographic measure of personality. It was devised by George Kelly in around 1955 and is based on his personal construct theory of personality.

== Introduction ==

The repertory grid is a technique for identifying the ways that a person construes (interprets or gives meaning to) his or her experience. It provides information from which inferences about personality can be made, but it is not a personality test in the conventional sense. It is underpinned by the personal construct theory developed by George Kelly, first published in 1955.

A grid consists of four parts:
# A &quot;topic&quot;: it is about some part of the person&#x27;s experience.
# A set of &quot;elements&quot;, which are examples or instances of the &quot;topic&quot;. Working as a clinical psychologist, Kelly was interested in how his clients construed people in the roles they adopted towards the client, and so, originally, such terms as &quot;my father&quot;, &quot;my mother&quot;, &quot;an admired friend&quot; and so forth were used. Since then, the grid has been used in much wider settings (educational, occupational, organisational) and so any well-defined set of words, phrases, or even brief behavioral vignettes can be used as elements. For example, to see how a person construes the purchase of a car, a list of vehicles within that person&#x27;s price range could be a set of elements.
# A set of &quot;constructs&quot;. These are the basic terms that the client uses to make sense of the elements, and are always expressed as a contrast. Thus the meaning of &quot;good&quot; depends on whether you intend to say &quot;&quot;good&quot; versus &quot;poor&quot;, as if you were construing a theatrical performance, or &quot;good&quot; versus &quot;evil&quot;&quot;, as if you were construing the moral or ontological status of some more fundamental experience.
# A set of ratings of &quot;elements&quot; on &quot;constructs&quot;. Each element is positioned between the two extremes of the construct using a 5- or 7-point rating scale system; this is done repeatedly for all the constructs that apply; and thus its meaning to the client is modeled, and statistical analysis varying from simple counting, to more complex multivariate analysis of meaning, is made possible.

Constructs are regarded as personal to the client, who is psychologically similar to other people depending on the extent to which they would tend to use similar constructs, and similar ratings, in relating to a particular set of elements.

The client is asked to consider the elements three at a time, and to identify a way in which two of the elements might be seen as alike, but distinct from, contrasted to, the third. For example, in considering a set of people as part of a topic dealing with personal relationships, a client might say that the element &quot;my father&quot; and the element &quot;my boss&quot; are similar because they are both fairly tense individuals, whereas the element &quot;my wife&quot; is different because she is &quot;relaxed&quot;. And so we identify one construct that the individual uses when thinking about people: whether they are &quot;&quot;tense&quot; as distinct from &quot;relaxed&quot;. In practice, good grid interview technique would delve a little deeper and identify some more behaviorally explicit description of &quot;tense&quot; versus &quot;relaxed&quot;. All the elements are rated on the construct, further triads of elements are compared and further constructs elicited, and the interview would continue until no further constructs are obtained.

== Using the repertory grid ==

Careful interviewing to identify what the individual means by the words initially proposed, using a 5-point rating system could be used to characterize the way in which a group of fellow-employees are viewed on the construct &quot;keen and committed&quot; versus &quot;energies elsewhere&quot;&quot;, a 1 indicating that the left pole of the construct applies (&quot;keen and committed&quot;) and a 5 indicating that the right pole of the construct applies (&quot;energies elsewhere&quot;). On being asked to rate all of the elements, our interviewee might reply that Tom merits a 2 (fairly keen and committed), Mary a 1 (very keen and committed), and Peter a 5 (his energies are very much outside the place of employment). The remaining elements (another five people, for example) are then rated on this construct.

Typically (and depending on the topic) people have a limited number of genuinely different constructs for any one topic: 6 to 16 are common when they talk about their job or their occupation, for example. The richness of people&#x27;s meaning structures comes from the many different ways in which a limited number of constructs can be applied to individual elements. A person may indicate that Tom is fairly keen, very experienced, lacks social skills, is a good technical supervisor, can be trusted to follow complex instructions accurately, has no sense of humour, will always return a favour but only sometimes help his co-workers, while Mary is very keen, fairly experienced, has good social and technical supervisory skills, needs complex instructions explained to her, appreciates a joke, always returns favours, and is very helpful to her co-workers: these are two very different and complex pictures, using just 8 constructs about a person&#x27;s co-workers.

Important information can be obtained by including self-elements such as &quot;Myself as I am now&quot;; &quot;Myself as I would like to be&quot; among other elements, where the topic permits.

== Analysis of results ==

A single grid can be analysed for both content (eyeball inspection) and structure (cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and a variety of structural indices relating to the complexity and range of the ratings being the chief techniques used). Sets of grids are dealt with using one or other of a variety of content analysis techniques. A range of associated techniques can be used to provide precise, operationally defined expressions of an interviewee&#x27;s constructs, or a detailed expression of the interviewee&#x27;s personal values, and all of these techniques are used in a collaborative way. The repertory grid is emphatically not a standardized &quot;psychological test&quot;; it is an exercise in the mutual negotiation of a person&#x27;s meanings.

The repertory grid has found favour among both academics and practitioners in a great variety of fields because it provides a way of describing people&#x27;s construct systems (loosely, understanding people&#x27;s perceptions) without prejudging the terms of reference—a kind of personalized grounded theory.

Unlike a conventional rating-scale questionnaire, it is not the investigator but the interviewee who provides the constructs on which a topic is rated. Market researchers, trainers, teachers, guidance counsellors, new product developers, sports scientists, and knowledge capture specialists are among the users who find the technique (originally developed for use in clinical psychology) helpful.

== Relationship to other tools ==

In the book &quot;Personal Construct Methodology&quot;, researchers Brian R. Gaines and Mildred L.G. Shaw noted that they &quot;have also found concept mapping and semantic network tools to be complementary to repertory grid tools and generally use both in most studies&quot; but that they &quot;see less use of network representations in PCP [personal construct psychology] studies than is appropriate&quot;. They encouraged practitioners to use semantic network techniques in addition to the repertory grid.

<text>Sir Gordon Ivan Hobday (1 February 1916 – 27 May 2015) was a British scientist who worked on penicillin with Alexander Fleming and is noted for his role as director of the Boots research team that developed ibuprofen. He later became chairman of Boots.

==Biography==
Hobday was born in New Sawley, Derbyshire on 1 February 1916. His father, Alexander Thomas Hobday was a lace card punch operator and his mother was Frances Cassandra, née Meads. He attended Long Eaton Grammar School as a child and then studied Chemistry at University College, Nottingham. He continued his post graduate education at the university, under a scholarship and gained a PhD in 1940.

Hobday married Margaret Jean Joule on 5 October 1940 and they had one daughter together. In 1995, Margaret died and he remarried on 1 July 2002 to author Patricia Cooper, née Birge. He was the 4th Chancellor of the University of Nottingham, of which university he was a graduate. He was Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire 1983–1991. He was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1979 Birthday Honours.

He died on 27 May 2015, in King&#x27;s Mill Hospital, Sutton in Ashfield at the age of 99.

==Career==
Hobday joined Boots &amp; Co as a research assistant after completing his PhD in 1940 and worked his way up through promotions. In 1952, he became head of the research department when the previous head, Jack Drummond was murdered, and re-purposed the department to find treatments for &quot;diseases of civilisation&quot;. It was under this mindset that the department looked for an alternative treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, due to the toxicity of aspirin. The programme came up with ibuprofen, which was patented in 1961. In the 1970s, it became an over-the-counter pain killer and the World Health Organization put it on its list of &quot;essential medicines&quot;.

In 1968, Hobday was appointed the deputy managing director for Boots, and in 1970, he became the managing director. By 1973, he had become chairman, where he attempted a merger with Glaxo and to buy House of Fraser, but the Monopolies Commission stopped both.

<doc id="1201368" wikidata="Q2613729" url="?curid=1201368" title="Fort Brown">
<text>Fort Brown (originally Fort Texas) was a military post of the United States Army in Cameron County, Texas, during the latter half of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. Established in 1846, it was the first US Army military outpost of the recently annexed state. Confederate Army troops stationed there saw action during the American Civil War. In the early 20th century, it was garrisoned in relation to military activity over border conflicts with Mexico. Surviving elements of the fort were designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1960.

==Early years==
In 1846, Captain Joseph K. Mansfield directed the construction of a star-shaped earthwork for 800 men called &quot;Fort Texas&quot; on the northern side of the Rio Grande &quot;by the order from General [Zachary] Taylor to command the city of Matamoros&quot; south of the river.

The next year, the fort was besieged during the opening of the Mexican–American War. During the Siege of Fort Texas, two Americans were killed, including Major Jacob Brown and George Oakes Stevens (of Vermont) of the 2nd Dragoons. In honor of the fallen major, General Taylor renamed the post as Fort Brown. In 1849, the city of Brownsville, Texas, was established not far from the fort&#x27;s grounds, after the United States had acquired Texas following the war.

==Cortina==
While in command at the fort, Major Samuel P. Heintzelman coordinated with John Salmon Ford in the Cortina Troubles, culminating in the Battle of Rio Grande City in 1859.

==Civil War==
In 1861, Confederate Colonel John &quot;Rip&quot; Ford occupied the fort, with a garrison there until 1863. The Confederate forces were finally driven out by Union forces under General Nathaniel P. Banks, who had his troops camped in tents erected at the fort site. This Union occupation ended in 1864, when Confederate forces under General James E. Slaughter and Colonel Ford took control of the area. They held the post until the end of the war, when it was occupied again by Union forces under General Egbert Brown.

==Postbellum==
From 1867–1869, a permanent US Army fort was constructed under the supervision of Captain William A. Wainwright.

In 1882, Dr. William Crawford Gorgas was assigned to the hospital at Fort Brown during the height of a yellow fever outbreak. Using Fort Brown as his base of operations, Gorgas studied the disease for several years. He was sent to Cuba during the Spanish–American War.

==Brownsville raid==
A unit of African-American soldiers, known as Buffalo Soldiers, was stationed at Fort Brown. White residents of town resented the presence of the Black soldiers, and tensions rose. On August 13 and 14, 1906, unknown persons &quot;raided&quot; Brownsville, indiscriminately shooting bystanders. They wounded one White man and killed White resident Frank Natus. The townspeople of Brownsville quickly blamed the Black soldiers for the incident. The Army investigated the matter and concluded that the Black soldiers were guilty although their supervising officers supported them and said that they had been at the fort. William H. Taft, then President [[Theodore Roosevelt [[United States] Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] and soon to be elected as president, ordered all 168 Black soldiers to be discharged &quot;without honor.&quot;

In 1972, the Army conducted another investigation, led by Lt. Col. William Baker. The government concluded that the Black soldiers had not been responsible. They were given posthumous honorable discharges, but only two of the original 168 men were still alive. The two men received compensation, but the Army did not restore the dead soldiers&#x27; pensions to which their descendants would have been entitled.

Since the late 20th century, historians have speculated about the incident. [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]&#x27;s program &quot;[[History&#x27;s Mysteries]]&quot; attributed the incident to Brownsville residents&#x27; shooting up the town with rifles using the same caliber ammunition ([[.45-70]] ?) as the soldiers and then framing the soldiers. (Academic press books about the [[Brownsville Affair|Brownsville Raid]] include &quot;The Brownsville Raid&quot; (1970/1992) and &quot;The Senator and the Sharecropper&#x27;s Son: Exoneration of the Brownsville Soldiers&quot; (1997) by John D. Weaver, and &quot;Racial Borders: Black Soldiers along the Rio Grande&quot; (2010) by James Leiker.)

==First airplane to be attacked by hostile fire==
On April 20, 1915, [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps|U.S. Signal Corps]] Officers Byron Q. Jones and Thomas Millings flew a [[Martin T]] over the fort to spot movements of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] revolutionary leader [[Pancho Villa|Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa]]. The plane reached an altitude of 2,600 ft. and was up for 20 minutes. It did not cross the border into Mexico although it was fired upon by machine guns and small arms. Thesfrequent patrols lasted for six weeks and were used more effectively in 1916.

==124th Cavalry==
The troopers stationed at Fort Brown from 1929 to 1945 were from the [[124th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|124th Cavalry Regiment]], Texas [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], which was one of the last mounted cavalry regiments in the United States Army. On November 18, 1940, they went into active military training. After the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], the division served with distinction, dismounted, in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]], where a member of the unit from Fort Brown earned the theater&#x27;s only [[Medal of Honor]] (awarded to [[Jack L. Knight]], commanding F Troop).

==United States Army Air Forces use==
During World War II, Fort Brown was transferred to the USAAF Training Command on July 7, 1943. The USAAF Gulf Coast Training Center (later the Central Flying Training Command) used the fort for flexible gunnery training until the fort was inactivated on February 1, 1946.

==Decommission==
On February 1, 1946, Fort Brown was decommissioned and turned over to the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] on April 25, 1946. It was acquired by the City of Brownsville and [[Texas Southmost College]] in 1948.

Three areas that were once part of the post were designated a discontiguous [[National Historic Landmark District]] in 1960 in recognition of its historic importance. They include earthworks built in 1846; a cavalry barracks built in 1848; and a collection of buildings erected mainly between 1868 and 1870, including a hospital, morgue, barracks, commissary, colonel&#x27;s house, and officers&#x27; quarters.

The [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023]] authorized the addition of Fort Brown (166 acres) to [[Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park]].

<doc id="1201374" wikidata="Q150132" url="?curid=1201374" title="Kyŏn Hwŏn">
<text>Kyŏn Hwŏn (; 867 – 27 September 936, ruled from 892 – March 935) was the king and founder of Later Baekje, one of the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea, and reigned from 892 to 935. Some records render his name as Chin Hwŏn (). He was also the progenitor of the Hwanggan Kyŏn clan. Substantial accounts of his life are preserved in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, which presents a single narrative, and the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, which presents excerpts about him from various sources.

==Background==
Records say that Kyŏn Hwŏn was born with the surname Yi, not Kyŏn. Most accounts agree that Kyŏn Hwŏn&#x27;s father was Ajagae, a farmer and rebel leader surnamed Yi, and that he was born in what is today Gaeun-eup in Mungyeong, South Korea, as the oldest of six children. However, Kyŏn Hwŏn later changed his family name to Kyon. Some argue that he changed his surname to start afresh as the founder of the new state of Later Baekje. Kyŏn Hwŏn is considered the progenitor of the Hwanggan Kyŏn clan. His sons, Sin-gŏm, Yang-gŏm, Yong-gŏm and Kŭm-gang, used the surname Kyŏn (or Chin), not Yi.

His mother was from the Gwangju area, but her exact identity is not known; Ajagae had two wives, Lady Sangwon and Lady Namwon, and Kyŏn Hwŏn was born to his first wife. Legends state that his mother was from Gwangju and gave birth to her firstborn son after having physical contact with a worm disguised as a man, and that Kyŏn Hwŏn grew up drinking the milk of a tiger.

The Silla court of Queen Jinseong was heavily corrupt and embroiled with political confusion. Widespread famine ravaged the country, driving many of the people into rebel forces. Village headmen, and new military forces arose and created power bases all over the country. The government who had tried to implement a forceful taxation plan found itself in the face of rebellions led by bandits, local nobles, and rebel leaders. It was during this time that Kyŏn Hwŏn&#x27;s father Ajagae led a local peasant revolt and set up base in Sangju.

==Early life and founding of Later Baekje==
Kyŏn Hwŏn is said to have left home at 15 to join the Silla army and became the commander of Silla forces in the Jeolla region. While his father grabbed power in the Sangju region, he independently marshalled local peasants to his cause, and soon gathered many followers. In 892, Kyŏn Hwŏn seized the cities of Wansanju and Mujinju, taking over the old territory of Baekje and winning the support of the people in the area who were hostile to Silla.

Kyŏn Hwŏn declared himself the king of Later Baekje and established his capital at Wansanju in 900. He established government, made diplomatic ties with Tang China, and continuously pursued the expansion of his kingdom amidst much conflict with Kung Ye of Later Goguryeo.

==Reign==
After crowning himself as ruler of Later Baekje, Kyŏn Hwŏn sent his army to present-day Hapcheon, southwest of the Silla capital Gyeongju, but the campaign failed and the army retreated. Then in 910, when Wang Kŏn, the general of the rival kingdom of Majin, attacked and captured the city of Naju, the very city in which Kyŏn Hwŏn had started his rebellion, he made an attempt to retake the city from Wang but failed.

In 918, Kung Ye, who had been maintaining his rule by acts of terror, was dethroned and murdered by his own army commanders. His general and chief minister Wang Kŏn was crowned as their new ruler, marking the beginning point of Goryeo.

Kyŏn Hwŏn sent another major expedition to Hapcheon in 920 and finally succeeded in taking over the region, forcing King Gyeongmyeong into an alliance with Goryeo. Then he invaded the present-day Andong area, but his troops were defeated by local Silla guards. Kyŏn Hwŏn was forced to make peace with Goryeo after the battle, through a hostage exchange of royal family members. However, when his nephew Chin Ho died, he killed the Goryeo hostage Wang Shin, cousin of Wang Kon, and resumed war against Goryeo.

In 927, Kyŏn Hwŏn led his army himself and directly attacked the Silla capital of Gyeongju. King Gyeongae was unprepared for this attack, and he chose suicide over capture by the invading army of Later Baekje. Kyŏn Hwŏn then established Kim Pu (who became King Gyeongsun) as the next Silla king. On his way back, he was met by the forces led by Wang Kŏn, and easily defeated the Goryeo army, killing many of Wang&#x27;s notable generals and warriors, with Wang barely escaping through the daring self-sacrifice of his general Sin Sung-gyŏm and Kim Nak. One year later he took over the city of Jinju from Silla.

==Decline and fall==
Later Baekje and Goryeo were in constant state of hostilities without one being completely dominant over the other. However, in 930, the Later Baekje troops faced a heavy defeat at the Battle of Gochang (present-day Andong) and was unable to recover from the loss. Kyŏn Hwŏn attempted to reverse the current by sacking the Goryeo capital of Gaeseong, but his army suffered another defeat in 934.

Not only was Later Baekje reeling from military defeats, the kingdom was in internal disarray. In 935, Kyŏn Hwŏn&#x27;s eldest son Kyŏn Sin-gŏm, who had been slighted as heir to the throne in favor of his younger brother Kŭm-gang, overthrew Kyŏn Hwŏn with the aid of his brothers Yang-gŏm and Yong-gŏm. Sin-gŏm killed Kŭm-gang and confined Kyŏn Hwŏn to the temple Geumsansa, but Kyŏn Hwŏn escaped and fled to Goryeo and his old enemy Wang Kŏn, who welcomed him and provided him with land and slaves.

King Gyeongsun of Silla formally surrendered to Goryeo in 935. The following year, at Kyŏn Hwŏn&#x27;s request, he and Wang Kŏn led a massive Goryeo army to Later Baekje and the kingdom fell.

Kyŏn Hwŏn died the same year of an inflamed tumor.

==Diplomacy==
Unlike his rival Kung Ye, Kyŏn Hwŏn was active in diplomacy; he was formally confirmed by the Chinese kingdoms of Wuyue and Later Tang as the legitimate ruler of Later Baekje. In addition, he sought an alliance with the newly formed and rising Liao Dynasty in the north, which was founded by the Khitans, in order to surround Goryeo from both north and south, respectively. Kyŏn Hwŏn also sent envoys to Heian Japan during his reign for mainly commercial reasons; the Jeolla region, where Kyŏn Hwŏn began his kingdom, was the center of trade in East Asia during the period and had already served as the base for traders such as Chang Pogo.

However, despite all of his diplomatic, military and trade abilities Kyŏn Hwŏn lacked the political astuteness to found a viable state; his Later Baekje government system was not very much different from the one of Silla, which had been proven to be ineffective in centralizing the power of the local landlords and merchants. In the end, Later Baekje was not able to exercise influence over many of its people, paving the way for Goryeo to incorporate the kingdom and unify the Korean peninsula.

<doc id="1201381" wikidata="Q620565" url="?curid=1201381" title="Apothecaries' system">
<text>The apothecaries&#x27; system, or apothecaries&#x27; weights and measures, is a historical system of mass and volume units that were used by physicians and apothecaries for medical prescriptions and also sometimes by scientists. The English version of the system is closely related to the English troy system of weights, the pound and grain being exactly the same in both. It divides a pound into 12 ounces, an ounce into 8 drachms, and a drachm into 3 scruples of 20 grains each. This exact form of the system was used in the United Kingdom; in some of its former colonies, it survived well into the 20th century. The apothecaries&#x27; system of measures is a similar system of volume units based on the fluid ounce. For a long time, medical recipes were written in Latin, often using special symbols to denote weights and measures.

The use of different measure and weight systems depending on the purpose was an almost universal phenomenon in Europe between the decline of the Roman Empire and metrication. This was connected with international commerce, especially with the need to use the standards of the target market and to compensate for a common weighing practice that caused a difference between actual and nominal weight. In the 19th century, most European countries or cities still had at least a &quot;commercial&quot; or &quot;civil&quot; system (such as the English avoirdupois system) for general trading, and a second system (such as the troy system) for precious metals such as gold and silver. The system for precious metals was usually divided in a different way from the commercial system, often using special units such as the carat. More significantly, it was often based on different weight standards.

The apothecaries&#x27; system often used the same ounces as the precious metals system, although even then the number of ounces in a pound could be different. The apothecaries&#x27; pound was divided into its own special units, which were inherited (via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as Dioscorides and Galen, 1st and 2nd century) from the general-purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries&#x27; weights and the normal commercial weights were different, it was not always clear which of the two systems was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries, or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it. In old merchants&#x27; handbooks, the former system is sometimes referred to as the pharmaceutical system and distinguished from the apothecaries&#x27; system.

From pound down to the scruple, the units of the traditional English apothecaries&#x27; system were a subset of the units of the Roman weight system, although the troy pound and its subdivisions were slightly heavier than the Roman pound and its subdivisions. Similar systems were used all over Europe, but with considerable local variation described below under Variants. The traditional English apothecaries&#x27; system of weights is shown in the first table in this section: the pound, ounce and grain were identical to the troy pound, ounce and grain (also used to measure weights of precious metals; distinct from the avoirdupois pounds and ounces that were used for measurements of other goods.) The confusing variety of definitions and conversions for pounds and ounces is covered elsewhere in a table of pound definitions. 

To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 introduced a new variant of the apothecaries&#x27; system which subdivided a new apothecaries&#x27; pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35 g, the proposed system was very similar to that in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled the value of the avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.

The Irish proposal was not widely adopted, but British legislation, in the form of the Medical Act 1858 (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. 90), was more radical: it prescribed the use of the avoirdupois system for the United Kingdom (then including Ireland), with none of the traditional subdivisions. This innovation was first used in the United British pharmacopœia of 1864, which recommended the adoption in pharmacy of the imperial avoirdupois pound of 7000 grains and ounce of 437.5 grains, and discontinuation of the drachm and scruple. In practice, however, the old apothecaries&#x27; system based on divisions of the troy pound, or of the troy ounce of 480 grains, was still widely used until it was abolished by the Weights and Measures Act 1976 (c. 77), since when it may only be used to measure precious metals and stones. (The troy pound had already been declared illegal for most other uses by the Weights and Measures Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 49), but this act allowed the sale of drugs by apothecaries&#x27; weight as an exception.)

Apothecaries&#x27; units of any kind became obsolete in the UK with the mandatory use of metric drug measurements from January 1, 1971.

In the United States, the apothecaries&#x27; system remained official until it was abolished in 1971 in favour of the metric system.

===Volume===

English-speaking countries also used a system of units of fluid measure, or in modern terminology volume units, based on the apothecaries&#x27; system. Originally, the terms and symbols used to describe the volume measurements of liquids were the same as or similar to those used to describe weight measurements of solids (for example, the pound by weight and the fluid pint were both referred to with Latin &quot;libra,&quot; symbol ). A volume of liquid that was approximately that of an apothecaries&#x27; ounce of water was called a fluid ounce, and was divided into fluid drachms and sometimes also fluid scruples. The smallest unit of liquid volume was traditionally a drop (Latin &quot;gutta&quot;). Although nominally defined as a sixtieth of the fluid drachm, in practice the drop was a not a standardized unit of volume but was measured by means of releasing literal drops of liquid from the lip of a bottle or vial. 

The 1809 London &quot;Pharmacopoeia&quot; introduced modified terminology for apothecaries&#x27; measurements of liquid volume. New terms and symbols introduced by the London College of Physicians (&quot;octarius, minim&quot;) were subsequently adopted by the Pharmacopoeias of the United States and Dublin. The pint was given the Latin name &quot;octarius&quot; and represented by the symbol O, thus distinguishing its Latin name and symbol from that of the pound. The terms for fluid ounce and fluid drachm were distinguished from weight measures by the prefix &quot;fluid-&quot; (Latin &quot;Fluiduncia, Fluidrachma&quot;, English &quot;fluidounce&quot; and &quot;fluidrachm&quot;) or in abbreviations by the prefixed letter f (f℥, fʒ). (However, even in the 20th century the f of the symbols f℥, fʒ was sometimes omitted by physicians in the United States, with fluid ounces and fluid drams represented instead simply by the symbols ℥, ʒ.) The smallest unit of volume was standardized as precisely a sixtieth of a fluidrachm (1/61,440 of a wine gallon) and given the name minim. (Subsequently, the old term &quot;drop&quot; was sometimes viewed as an approximate equivalent of the new &quot;minim&quot;, based on their nominally equivalent definitions. In fact, the units were qualitatively different because the traditional drop, by the nature of how it was measured, did not actually correspond to a single definite volume.) Along with the new name of &quot;minim,&quot; the London &quot;Pharmacopoeia&quot; of 1809 prescribed a new method of measuring the smallest unit of volume using a graduated glass tube. 

Before introduction of the imperial units in the U.K., all apothecaries&#x27; fluid measures were based on the unit of the wine gallon, which survived in the US under the name &quot;liquid gallon&quot; or &quot;wet gallon&quot;. The wine gallon was abolished in Britain in 1826, and this system was replaced by a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon. Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, the same is true for the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. Accordingly, in the new imperial system, the number of fluid ounces per pint was adjusted from 16 to 20 so that the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern U.K. fluid ounce is 4% &quot;less&quot; than the US fluid ounce, and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the U.K.

As a result, the Imperial and U.S. systems differ in the size of the basic unit (the gallon or the pint, one gallon being equal to eight pints), and in the number of fluid ounces per pint. 

Apothecaries&#x27; systems for volumes were internationally much less common than those for weights. 

There were also commonly used, but unofficial divisions of the Apothecaries&#x27; system, consisting of:
*Glass-tumbler 8 fl. oz.
*Breakfast-cup about 8 fl. oz.
*Tea-cup 5 fl. oz.
*Wine-glass 2 fl. oz.
*Table-spoon fl. oz.
*Dessert-spoon 2 fl. dr. (same as fl. oz.)
*Tea-spoon 1 fl. dr. (same as fl. oz.)

In the United States, similar measures in use were once: 
*Tumblerful — ƒ℥ viii (8 fl oz/ 1 cup/ 240 mL)
*Teacupful — ƒ℥ iv (4 fl oz/ 1 gill/ 120 mL)
*Wineglassful — ƒ℥ ij (2 fl oz/ 60 mL)
*Tablespoonful — ƒ℥ ss ( fl oz/ 3 tsp/ 1 Tbsp; 15 mL as once codified in the ninth edition of the United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P. IX))
*Dessertspoonful — ƒʒ ij (≡ ƒ℈ viij or ƒʒ/ 2 tsp; 10 mL as once codified in the U.S.P. IX)
*Teaspoonful — ƒʒ j (≡ ƒ℈ iv or ƒʒ/ 1 tsp; 5 mL as once codified in the U.S.P. IX)

The cited book states, &quot;In almost all cases the modern teacups, tablespoons, dessertspoons, and teaspoons, after careful test by the author, were found to average 25 percent greater capacity than the theoretical quantities given above, and thus the use of accurately graduated medicine glasses, which may be had now at a trifling cost, should be insisted upon.&quot;

Apothecaries&#x27; measures eventually fell out of use in the U.K. and were officially abolished in 1971. In the U.S., they are still occasionally used, for example with prescribed medicine being sold in four-ounce (℥ iv) bottles.

==Medical prescriptions==

Until around 1900, medical prescriptions and most European pharmacopoeias were written in Latin. Here is a typical example from the middle of the 19th century.

The use of Latin ensured that the prescriptions could be read by an international audience. There was a technical reason why &quot;3 ʒ&quot; was written &quot;ʒiij,&quot; and &quot; ʒ&quot; as &quot;ʒss&quot;: Writing &quot;iii&quot; as &quot;iij&quot; would prevent tampering with or misinterpretation of a number after it is written. The letters &quot;ss&quot; are an abbreviation for the Latin &quot;semis&quot; meaning &quot;half&quot;, which were sometimes written with a ß. In Apothecaries&#x27; Latin, numbers were generally written in Roman numerals, immediately following the symbol. Since only the units of the apothecaries&#x27; system were used in this way, this made it clear that the civil weight system was not meant.

==Variants==

===Diversity of local standards===
The basic form of the apothecaries&#x27; system is essentially a subset of the Roman weight system. An apothecaries&#x27; pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain, the customary unit was the , a mark of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform than that of a pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the weight of a physical grain.
It is most convenient to compare the various local weight standards by the metric weights of their ounces. The actual mass of an ounce varied by ±17% (5 g) around the typical value of 30 g. The table only shows approximate values for the most important standards; even the same nominal standard could vary slightly between one city and its neighbour. The range from 25 g to 31 g is filled with numerous variants, especially the Italian range up to 28 g. But there is a relatively large gap between the troy ounces of 31 g and the Habsburg ounce of 35 g. The latter is the product of an 18th-century weight reform.

Even in Turkey a system of weights similar to the European apothecaries&#x27; system was used for the same purpose. For medical purposes the tcheky (approx. 320 g) was divided in 100 drachms, and the drachm in (16 kilos or) 64 grains. This is close to the classical Greek weight system, where a &quot;mina&quot; (corresponding roughly to a Roman &quot;libra&quot;) was also divided into 100 drachms.

With the beginning of metrication, some countries standardized their apothecaries&#x27; pound to an easily remembered multiple of the French gramme. E.g. in the Netherlands the Dutch troy pound of 369.1 g was standardized in 1820 to 375.000 g, to match a similar reform in France. The British troy pound retained its value of 373.202 g until in 2000 it was legally defined in metric terms, as 373.2417216 g. (At this time its use was mainly confined to trading precious metals.)

===Basic variants===
In the Romance speaking part of Europe the scruple was divided in 24 grains, in the rest of Europe in 20 grains. Notable exceptions were Venice and Sicily, where the scruple was also divided in 20 grains.

The Sicilian apothecaries ounce was divided into 10 drachms. Since the scruple was divided into only 20 grains, like in the northern countries, an ounce consisted of 600 grains. This was not too different from the situation in most of the other Mediterranean countries, where an ounce consisted of 576 grains.

In France, at some stage the apothecaries&#x27; pound of 12 ounces was replaced by the larger civil pound of 16 ounces. The subdivisions of the apothecaries ounce were the same as in the other Romance countries, however, and were different from the subdivisions of the otherwise identical civil ounce.

==Origins==

===Roman weight system===


The basic apothecaries&#x27; system consists of the units pound, ounce, and scruple from the classical Roman weight system, together with the originally Greek drachm and a new subdivision of the scruple into either 20 (&quot;barley&quot;) or 24 (&quot;wheat&quot;) grains (). In some countries other units of the original system remained in use, for example in Spain the and . In some cases the apothecaries&#x27; and civil weight systems had the same ounces (&quot;an ounce is an ounce&quot;), but the civil pound consisted of 16 ounces. is Latin for the seed of the carob tree.

Many attempts were made to reconstruct the exact mass of the Roman pound. One method for doing this consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similar to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45 g, but one should keep in mind that (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman weight standard is unlikely to have remained constant to such a precision over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the Holy Roman Empire were reformed by Charlemagne, but in the Byzantine Empire it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to Scandinavia, the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.

===Weight system of Salerno===

The history of mediaeval medicine started roughly around the year 1000 with the school of medicine in Salerno, which combined elements of Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Jewish medicine. Galen and Dioscorides (who had used the Graeco-Roman weight system) were among the most important authorities, but also Arabic physicians, whose works were systematically translated into Latin.

According to , a famous 13th-century text that exists in numerous variations and is often ascribed to Dino di Garbo, the system of weights used in Salerno was different from the systems used in Padua and Bologna. As can be seen from the table, it was also different from the Roman weight system used by Galenus and Dioscorides and from all modern apothecaries&#x27; systems: The ounce was divided into 9 drachms, rather than 8 drachms.

Centuries later, the region around Salerno was the only exception to the rule that (except for skipping units that had regionally fallen out of use) the apothecaries&#x27; ounce was subdivided down to the scruple in exactly the same way as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10 drachms.

==Romance countries==
While there will naturally have been some changes throughout the centuries, this section only tries to give a general overview of the situation that was recorded in detail in numerous 19th-century merchants&#x27; handbooks.

;Iberian Peninsula
On the Iberian Peninsula, apothecaries&#x27; weights in the 19th century were relatively uniform, with 24 grains per scruple (576 grains per ounce), the standard in Romance countries. The weight of an apothecaries&#x27; pound was 345.1 g in Spain and 344.2 g in Portugal. As in Italy, some of the additional subdivisions of the Roman system, such as the , were still in use there. It was standard to use the , defined as 8 ounces, instead of the pound.

;France
In 18th century France, there was a national weight standard, the of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, and it was also used as the apothecaries&#x27; pound. With 30.6 g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise, the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.

;Italy
Due in part to the political conditions in what would become a united Kingdom of Italy only in 1861, the variation of apothecaries&#x27; systems and standard weights in this region was enormous. (For background information, see History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification.) The (pound) generally consisted of the standard twelve ounces, however.

The civil weight systems were generally very similar to the apothecaries&#x27; system, and since the (or the , where different systems were in use for light and heavy goods) generally had a suitable weight for an apothecaries&#x27; pound it was often used for this purpose. Extreme cases were Rome and Genoa, where the same system was used for everything, including medicine. On the other hand, there were relatively large differences even between two cities in the same state. E.g. Bologna (in the Papal States) had an apothecaries pound that was less than the local civil pound, and 4% lighter than the pound used in Rome.

The weight of an apothecaries&#x27; pound ranged generally between 300 g and 320 g, slightly less than that of a pound in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this rule is that the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries&#x27; pound of 420 g. (See below under Habsburg standard.) E.g. in the large city of Milan the apothecaries&#x27; system based on a pound of 326.8 g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic Italian Republic. Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time when even in France the had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries&#x27; system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries&#x27; pound, which weighed almost 30% more.
The apothecaries&#x27; pound in Venice had exactly the same subdivisions as those in the non-Romance countries, but its total weight of 301 g was at the bottom of the range. During the Habsburg reign of 1814–1859 an exception was made for Venice; as a result, the extreme weights of 301 g and 420 g coexisted within one state and in immediate proximity. The Venice standard was also used elsewhere, for example in Udine. In Dubrovnik (called &quot;Ragusa&quot; until 1909) its use was partially continued for a long time in spite of the official Habsburg weight reform.

The measure and weight systems for the large mainland part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the Italian Peninsula and included Naples and Salerno. The subdivision of apothecaries&#x27; weight in the unified system was essentially the same as that for gold, silver, coins, and silk. It was the most excentric variant in that the ounce was divided in 10 drachms, rather than the usual 8. The scruple, like in Venice but unlike in the rest of the Romance region, was divided into 20 grains. The existence of a unit called , the equivalent of , is interesting because 6 were 9 . In the original Salerno weight system an ounce was divided into 9 drachms, and so an would have been of an ounce.

==Troyes, Nuremberg, and Habsburg==

===Weight standards named after Troyes===
As early as 1147 in Troyes in Champagne (in the Middle Ages an important trading town) a unit of weight called was used.

The national French standard until 1799 was based on a famous artifact called the , which probably dates back to the second half of the 15th century. It is an elaborate set of nesting weight pieces, with a total metric weight of 12.238 &quot;kg&quot;. The set is now shown in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. The total nominal value of the set is 50 or , a mark being 8 ounces. The ounce had therefore a metric equivalent of 30.59 g. The was used as a national French standard for trading, for gold, silver, and jewels, and for weighing medicine. It was also used in international communications between scientists. In the time before the French Revolution, the civil pound also played the role of the apothecaries&#x27; pound in the French apothecaries&#x27; system, which otherwise remained a standard system of the Romance (24 grains per scruple) type.

In Bruges, Amsterdam, Antwerp and other Flemish cities, a &quot;troy&quot; unit (&quot;&quot;) was also in use as a standard for valuable materials and medicine. As in France, the way in which the Flemish troy ounce was subdivided depended on what was weighed. Unlike the French, the Flemish apothecaries divided the scruple into 20 grains. The Flemish troy pound became the standard for the gold and apothecaries&#x27; system in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands; it was also used in this way in Lübeck. (The London troy pound was referred to as the &quot;, after metrification.)

The Dutch troy mark consisted of 8 Flemish troy ounces, with each ounce of 20 engels, and each engel divided into 32 assen. The Amsterdam Pound of two marks, used in commerce, weighed 10,280 assen, while the Amsterdam Troy pound weighed 10,240 assen, i.e. exactly two troy marks.

In 1414, six years before the Treaty of Troyes, a statute of Henry V of England gave directions to the goldsmiths in terms of the troy pound. (In 1304 it had apparently not yet been introduced, since it did not appear in the statute of weights and measures.) There is evidence from the 15th century that the troy pound was used for weighing metals and spices. After the abolishment of the Tower pound in 1527 by Henry VIII of England, the troy pound was the official basis for English coin weights. The British apothecaries&#x27; system was based on the troy pound until metrication, and it survived in the United States and Australia well into the 20th century.

Since the modern (English, American and Imperial) troy ounces are roughly 1.5% heavier than the late Paris ounce, the exact historical relations between the original , the French , the Flemish and the English troy pound are unclear. It is known, however, that the numerical relation between the English and French troy ounces was &quot;exactly&quot; 64:63 in the 14th century.

===Nuremberg standard===

In the Middle Ages the Imperial Free City of Nuremberg, an important trading place in the south of Germany, produced large amounts of nesting weight pieces to various European standards. In the 1540s, the first pharmacopoeia in the modern sense was also printed there. In 1555, a weight standard for the apothecaries&#x27; pound of 12 ounces was set in Nuremberg. Under the name &quot;Nuremberg pharmaceutical weight&quot; () it would become the standard for most of the north-east of Europe. However, some cities kept local copies of the standard.

As of 1800 all German states and cities except Lübeck (which had the Dutch troy standard) followed the Nuremberg standard. It was also the standard for Denmark, Norway, the Russian Empire, and most cantons of Switzerland. Poland and Sweden had their own variants of the standard, which differed from each other by 0.6%.

In 1811, Bavaria legally defined the apothecaries&#x27; pound as 360.00 g (an ounce of 30.00 g). In 1815, Nuremberg lost its status as a free city and became part of Bavaria. From now on the Nuremberg apothecaries&#x27; pound was no longer the official apothecaries&#x27; pound in Nuremberg; but the difference was only 0.6%. In 1836 the Greek apothecaries&#x27; pound was officially defined by this standard, four years after Otto, the son of the king of Bavaria, became the first king of Greece. But only few German states followed the example of Bavaria, and with a long delay. The apothecaries&#x27; pound of 360 g was also adopted in Lübeck, where it was official as of 1861.

Austria and the states of the Habsburg monarchy officially had a different standard since 1761, and Prussia, followed by its neighbours Anhalt, Lippe and Mecklenburg, would diverge in the opposite direction with a reform in 1816. But in both cases apothecaries continued to use the Nuremberg standard unofficially for a long time after it became illegal.

In Russia the apothecaries&#x27; system survived well into the 20th century. The Soviet Union officially abolished it only in January 1927.

===Habsburg standard===
Empress Maria Theresia of Austria reformed the measures and weights of the Habsburg monarchy in 1761. The weight of an apothecaries&#x27; pound of 12 ounces was increased to a value that was later (after the kilogramme was defined) found to be 420.009 g; this was called the . It was defined as of the unusually heavy Habsburg civil pound (defined as of the civil pound of Cologne) and corresponded to a record ounce weight of 35 g.

Before the reform, in the north of the empire, the Nuremberg standard had been in effect, and in Italy, the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase of 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia still used the Nuremberg standard , indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries&#x27; weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.

Venice was not part of these reforms and kept its standard of approximately 25 g per ounce.

When Austria started producing scales and weight pieces to the new standard with an excellent quality/price ratio, these were occasionally used by German apothecaries as well.

==Metrication==

===Early metrication===
At the time of the Industrial Revolution, the fact that each state had its own system of weights and measures became increasingly problematic. Serious work on a &quot;scientific&quot; system was started in France under Louis XVI, and completed in 1799 (after the French Revolution) with its implementation. The French population, however, was initially unhappy with the new system. In 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte reintroduced some of the old measurements, but in a modified form that was defined with respect to the metric system. This was finally abolished in 1837 and became illegal in 1840.

Due to the large expansion of the First French Empire under Napoleon I, French metrication also affected what would be (parts of) France&#x27;s neighbour countries after the Congress of Vienna.

The Netherlands were partially metricated when they were French, in the years 1810–1813. With full metrication, effective January 1821, the Netherlands reformed the . The apothecaries&#x27; new pound was 375.00 g. Apart from rounding issues concerning the subdivisions, this corresponded exactly to the French . (The reform was not followed in the north German city of Lübeck, which continued to use the .) In Belgium, apothecaries&#x27; weight was metricated effective 1856.

From 1803 to 1815, all German regions west of the River Rhine were French, organised in the Roer, Sarre, Rhin-et-Moselle, and Mont-Tonnerre. As a result of the Congress of Vienna these became part of various German states. A large part of the Palatinate fell to Bavaria, but having the metric system it was excepted from the Bavarian reform of weights and measures.

===Prussia&#x27;s path to metrication===
In Prussia, a reform in 1816 defined the Prussian civil pound in terms of the Prussian foot and distilled water. It also redefined the apothecaries&#x27; pound as 12 ounces, i.e. of the civil pound: 350.78 g. This reform was not popular with apothecaries, because it broke the uniformity of the apothecaries&#x27; pound in Germany at a time when a German national state was beginning to form. It seems that many apothecaries did not follow this reduction by 2%.

Another reform in 1856 increased the civil pound from 467.711 g to 500.000 g (the German civil pound defined by the Zollverein), as a first step towards metrication. As a consequence the official apothecaries&#x27; pound was now 375.000 g, i.e. it was increased by 7%, and it was now very close to the troy standards. §4 of the law that introduced this reform said: &quot;Further, a pharmaceutical weight deviating from the civil weight does not take place.&quot; But this paragraph was suspended until further notice.

The abolishment of the apothecaries&#x27; system meant that doctors&#x27; prescriptions had to take place in terms of the current civil weight: grammes and kilograms. This was considered unfeasible by many, and the state received numerous protests and asked for expertises. Nevertheless, by 1868 §4 of the earlier reform was finally put into force.

===Metrication in countries using the troy and avoirdupois systems===

Britain was initially involved in the development of the metric system, and the US was among the 17 initial signatories of the Metre Convention in 1875. Yet in spite of enthusiastic support for the new system by intellectuals such as Charles Dickens, these two countries were particularly slow to implement it.

In the US, the metric system replaced the apothecaries&#x27; system in the United States Pharmacopeia of 1971.

In the UK, metric drug measurements were required for dealings in drugs from January 1, 1971.

<text>Aurelio Lampredi (16 June 1917 – 1 June 1989) was an Italian automobile and aircraft engine designer.

==Early career==
Lampredi was born in Livorno, Tuscany. He studied mechanical engineering at the Institut Technique Supérieur in Fribourg. A classical music lover, he had wanted to study piano but was persuaded by his father to choose a more secure career path. After a brief apprentice at the Livorno Shipyard, he started working at Piaggio in 1937, where he was supervised by Corradino D&#x27;Ascanio. At the outbreak of World War II, he was drafted and moved to Reggiane, where he designed military aircraft engines.

==Ferrari==
Reggiane&#x27;s chief designer Carlo Ruini was impressed with Lampredi&#x27;s work and recommended him to Enzo Ferrari, who at the time was in the process of building his own racing team. Lampredi&#x27;s first interlude with Ferrari only lasted one year as he didn&#x27;t feel there was enough space for professional growth with Giuseppe Busso and Gioacchino Colombo already covering senior positions. He moved to Milan to work at Isotta Fraschini. In 1951 he was hired back by Ferrari once Busso has left for Alfa Romeo and Colombo moved to an advisorial role. Lampredi&#x27;s first Ferrari engine was a large 3.3, 4.1 and 4.5 L displacement V12, which was first used in the 275 S, 275 F1, 340 F1 and 375 F1 race cars. Lampredi&#x27;s engines were used as naturally aspirated alternatives to the diminutive Colombo-designed V12s used in most Ferrari cars until that time. After the lack of success of Colombo&#x27;s supercharged Formula One engine, Lampredi&#x27;s design began to find favor within the company. Lampredi&#x27;s engine gave Ferrari its first Formula One win when José Froilán González won the British Grand Prix in Silverstone in 1951. 
In 1951, Enzo Ferrari saw a good opportunity to make a competitive Formula Two racing car, when rules made it possible for Formula Two cars to compete in Formula One until new engine regulations would come into effect in 1954. He suggested to Lampredi that he&#x27;d design a twin-cam four-cylinder racing engine. The power unit proved to be very successful in Formula Two, Formula One and sports racing cars, with Alberto Ascari securing back-to-back Formula One World Championships in 1952 and 1953.

Lampredi&#x27;s tenure at Ferrari ended in 1955 when Ferrari bought Lancia&#x27;s racing division and famed engine designer Vittorio Jano, formerly of Alfa Romeo, joined the team. Though Lampredi&#x27;s engine designs continued to be used in Ferrari road cars, Jano&#x27;s V6 and V12 engines eventually replaced Lampredi&#x27;s V12s for racing use, with Juan-Manuel Fangio winning the Formula One title in 1956 and Mike Hawthorn in 1958.

==Fiat==
After Ferrari, Lampredi went to Fiat, where he oversaw that company&#x27;s engine design efforts until 1977. He designed the Fiat Twin-Cam and SOHC engines, which powered most Fiat and Lancia cars for over 32 years. He managed Fiat&#x27;s Abarth factory rally racing group from 1973 through 1982.

The Lampredi Twin Cam (Fiat Twin Cam) remains the most successful engine ever on the World Rally Championship circuit, garnering the most wins overall and 10 manufacturer championships for Fiat and Lancia.

In 1976 Lampredi designed the engine that would put Fiat on the Brazilian market – the FIASA (acronym of Portuguese &quot;Fiat Automóveis S.A). The engine equipped the Fiat 147, a Brazilian derivation of the European Fiat 127. The 147 was the first national vehicle to have a transversely mounted engine with a belt driven overhead camshaft. It was also the first large scale-engine to be powered by ethanol, when such version was made available in the 1979 Fiat 147. The FIASA engine remained in production until 2001 (25 years) until it was superseded by the new FIRE engine.

Lampredi died in Livorno in 1989.

<text>1G refers to the first generation of mobile telecommunications standards, introduced in the 1980s. This generation was characterized by the use of analog audio transmissions, a major distinction from the subsequent 2G networks, which were fully digital. The term &quot;1G&quot; itself was not used at the time, but has since been retroactively applied to describe the early era of cellular networks.

During the 1G era, various regional standards were developed and deployed in different countries, rather than a single global system. Among the most prominent were the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system and the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), which were widely adopted in their respective regions. The lack of a unified global standard resulted in a fragmented landscape, with different countries and regions utilizing different technologies for mobile communication.

As digital technology advanced, the inherent advantages of digital systems over analog led to the eventual replacement of 1G by 2G networks. While many 1G networks were phased out by the early 2000s, some continued to operate into the 2010s, particularly in less developed regions.

The antecedent to 1G technology is the mobile radio telephone (i.e. &quot;0G&quot;), where portable phones would connect to a centralised operator. 1G refers to the very first generation of cellular networks. Cellular technology employ a network of cells throughout a geographical area using low-power radio transmitters.

== History ==

The first commercial cellular network was launched in Japan by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1979, initially in the metropolitan area of Tokyo. The first phone that used this network was called TZ-801 built by Panasonic. Within five years, the NTT network had been expanded to cover the whole population of Japan and became the first nationwide 1G/cellular network. Before the network in Japan, Bell Laboratories built the first cellular network around Chicago in 1977 and trialled it in 1978.

As in the pre-cellular era, the Nordic countries were among the pioneers in wireless technologies. These countries together designed the NMT standard which first launched in Sweden in 1981. NMT was the first mobile phone network to feature international roaming. In 1983, the first 1G cellular network launched in the United States, which was Chicago-based Ameritech using the Motorola DynaTAC mobile phone.

In the early to mid 1990s, 1G was superseded by newer 2G (second generation) cellular technologies such as GSM and cdmaOne. Although 1G also used digital signaling to connect the radio towers (which listen to the handsets) to the rest of the telephone system, the voice itself during a call is encoded to digital signals in 2G whereas 1G uses analog FM modulation for the voice transmission, much like a 2-way land mobile radio. Most 1G networks had been discontinued by the early 2000s. Some regions especially Eastern Europe continued running these networks for much longer. The last operating 1G network was closed down in Russia in 2017.

===Adoption===

After Japan, the earliest commercial cellular networks launched in 1981 in Sweden, Norway and Saudi Arabia, followed by Denmark, Finland and Spain in 1982, the U.S. in 1983 and Hong Kong, South Korea, Austria and Canada in 1984. By 1986 networks had also launched in Tunisia, Malaysia, Oman, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom, West Germany, France, South Africa, Israel, Thailand, Indonesia, Iceland, Turkey, the Virgin Islands and Australia. Generally, African countries were slower to take up 1G networks, while Eastern European were among the last due to the political situation.

In Europe, the United Kingdom had the largest number of cellular subscribers as of 1990 numbering 1.1 million, while the second largest market was Sweden with 482 thousand. Although Japan was the first country with a nationwide cellular network, the number of users was significantly lower than other developed economies with a penetration rate of only 0.15 percent in 1989. As of January 1991, the highest penetration rates were in Sweden and Finland with both countries above 50 percent closely followed by Norway and Iceland. The United States had a rate of 21.2 percent. In most other European countries it was below 10 percent.

==1G standards==
Analog cellular technologies that were used were:
*Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS)
*Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT)
*Total Access Communication System (TACS) developed in the United Kingdom and also some other parts of the world
*C-450 developed in West Germany and also adopted in Portugal and South Africa
*Radiocom 2000 in France (France Telecom only)
*RTMI in Italy
*MCS-L1 and MCS-L2 (developed by NTT) in Japan
*JTACS (a variant of TACS operated by Daini Denden Planning, Inc. (DDI)) in Japan

<text>Krishnadevaraya (17 January 1471 – 17 October 1529) was emperor of the Vijayanagara Empire from 1509 to 1529. He was the third monarch of the Tuluva dynasty, and is considered to be one of the greatest rulers in Indian history. He ruled the largest empire in India after the fall of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate. Presiding over the empire at its zenith, he is regarded as an icon by many Indians. Krishnadevaraya earned the titles &quot;Andhra Bhoja&quot; (lit. &quot;Bhoja of Andhra&quot;), &quot;Karnatakaratna Simhasanadeeshwara&quot; (lit. &quot;Lord of the Jewelled Throne of Karnataka&quot;), &quot;Yavana Rajya Pratistapanacharya&quot; (lit. &quot;Establishment of the King to Bahmani Throne&quot;), &quot;Kannada Rajya Rama Ramana&quot; (lit. &quot;Lord of the Kannada Empire), &quot;Gaubrahmana Pratipalaka&quot; (lit. &quot;Protector of Brahmins and Cows&quot;) and &quot;Mooru Rayara Ganda&quot; (lit. &quot;Lord of Three Kings&quot;). He became the dominant ruler of the peninsula by defeating the sultans of Bijapur, Golconda, the Bahmani Sultanate and the Gajapatis of Odisha, and was one of the most powerful Hindu rulers in India.

Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s rule was characterised by expansion and consolidation. This was the time when the land between the Tungabhadra and Krishna river (the Raichur doab) was acquired (1512), ruler of Odisha were subdued (1514) and severe defeats were inflicted on the Sultan of Bijapur (1520).

When the Mughal Emperor Babur was taking stock of the potentates of north India, he rated Krishnadevaraya the most powerful, with the most extensive empire in the subcontinent. The Portuguese travellers Domingo Paes and Duarte Barbosa visited the Vijayanagara Empire during his reign, and their travelogues indicate that the king was not only an able administrator but also an excellent general, leading from the front in battle and even attending to the wounded. On many occasions, the king changed battle plans abruptly, turning a losing battle into victory. The poet Mukku Timmanna praised him as the &#x27;Destroyer of the Turks.&#x27; Krishnadevaraya benefited from the counsel of his prime minister Timmarusu, whom he regarded as the father figure responsible for his coronation. Krishnadevaraya was also advised by the witty Tenali Ramakrishna, who was employed in his court.

==Early life==
Krishnadevaraya was the son of Tuluva Narasa Nayaka and his queen Nagamamba. Tuluva Narasa Nayaka was an army commander under Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya, who later took control to prevent the disintegration of the empire and established the Tuluva dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire. He accessed the throne after the death of his brother Viranarasimha. He was married to Srirangapatna&#x27;s princess Tirumala Devi and his royal dancer from Kodagu, Chinna Devi. He was father to Tirumalamba (from Tirumala Devi), Vengalamba (from Chinna Devi) and Tirumala Raya (from Tirumala Devi). His daughters were married to Prince Rama Raya of Vijayanagara and his brother Prince Tirumala Deva Raya.

==Military career==
His main enemies were the Bahamani Sultans (who, though divided into five small kingdoms, remained a constant threat), the Gajapatis of Odisha, who had been involved in constant conflict since the rule of Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya, and Portugal, a rising maritime power which controlled much of the sea trade.

===Success in Deccan===
The raid and plunder of Vijayanagara towns and villages by the Deccan sultans came to an end during the Raya&#x27;s rule. In 1509, Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s armies clashed with them and Sultan Mahmud was severely injured and defeated. Yusuf Adil Shah was killed and the Raichur Doab was annexed. Taking advantage of the victory, the Raya reunited Bidar, Gulbarga, and Bijapur into Vijayanagara and earned the title &quot;establisher of the Yavana kingdom&quot; when he released Sultan Mahmud and made him de facto ruler. The Sultan of Golconda Sultan Quli Qutb Shah was defeated by Timmarusu, the prime minister of Krishnadevaraya. In 1513, Krishnadevaraya personally engaged in battle with Golconda Sultan Quli Qutb Shah at Pangal. The Vijayanagar army suffered defeat at the hands of the Golconda forces, resulting in the capture of the Pangal fort from Vijayanagar. As a consequence, Raya was compelled to retreat.

===War with Kalinga===

The Gajapatis of Odisha ruled a vast land comprising parts of Bengal, Andhra, and Odisha. Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s success at Ummatur provided the necessary impetus to carry his campaign into the coastal Andhra region, which was under the control of the Gajapati king Prataparudra Deva. The Vijayanagara army laid siege to the Udayagiri fort in 1512. The campaign lasted for a year before the Gajapati army disintegrated due to starvation. Krishnadevaraya offered prayers at Tirupati thereafter, along with his wives Tirumala Devi and Chinnama Devi. The Gajapati army was then met at Kondaveedu. The armies of Vijayanagara, after establishing a siege for a few months, began to retreat due to heavy casualties. Timmarusu discovered a secret entrance to the unguarded eastern gate of the fort and launched a night attack. This culminated with the capture of the fort and the imprisonment of Prince Virabhadra, the son of Prataparudra Deva. Vasireddy Mallikharjuna Nayaka took over as governor of Kondaveedu thereafter.

Krishnadevaraya planned an invasion of Kalinga, but Prataparudra learned of this plan and formulated his own plan to defeat the former at the fort of Kalinganagar. Timmarusu discovered Prataparudra&#x27;s plan by bribing a Telugu deserter from the service of Prataparudra. When the Vijayanagara Empire did invade, Prataprudra was driven to Cuttack, the capital of the Gajapati Kingdom. Prataparudra eventually surrendered to the Vijayanagara Empire, and gave his daughter, Princess Jaganmohini, in marriage to Krishnadevaraya. Krishnadevaraya returned all the lands that the Vijayanagara Empire had captured north of the Krishna River; this made the Krishna river the boundary between the Vijayanagara and Gajapati Kingdoms.

Krishnadevaraya established friendly relations with the Portuguese in Goa in 1510. The Emperor obtained guns and Arabian horses from the Portuguese merchants. He also utilized Portuguese expertise to improve the water supply to the Vijayanagara capital.

===Final conflict and death===
The complicated alliances of the empire and the five Deccan sultanates meant that he was continually at war. In one campaign, he defeated Golconda and captured its commander Madurul-Mulk, crushed Bijapur and its sultan Ismail Adil Shah, and restored the Bahmani sultanate to the son of .

The highlight of his conquests occurred on 19 May 1520 where he secured Raichur Fort from Ismail Adil Shah after a difficult siege in which 16,000 Vijayanagara soldiers were killed. The exploits of the military commander, Pemmasani Ramalinga Nayudu of the Pemmasani Nayaks, during the Battle of Raichur were distinguished and lauded by Krishnadevaraya. It is said that 700,000 foot soldiers, 32,600 cavalry, and 550 elephants were used. A Portuguese contingent commanded by Cristovão de Figueiredo with the use of fireweapons helped to conquer the fortress.

Krishnadevaraya was brutal towards Bahmani Generals of Raichur. Many Bahmani generals lost their lands. The other Muslim kings sent envoys to the emperor on hearing of his success and received a haughty reply. The king conveyed that if Adil Shah would come to him, do obeisance, and kiss his foot, his lands would be restored to him. The submission never took place. Krishnadevaraya then led his army as far north as Bijapur and occupied it. He imprisoned three sons of a former king of the Bahmani dynasty, who had been held captive by the Adil Shah and he proclaimed the eldest as king of the Deccan.

Finally, in his last battle, he razed to the ground the fortress of Gulburga, the early capital of the Bahmani sultanate.

In 1524, Krishnadevaraya made his son Tirumala Raya the &quot;Yuvaraja&quot; (crown prince). The prince did not survive for long: he was poisoned. Suspecting Timmarusu, Krishnadevaraya had him blinded. At the same time, Krishnadevaraya was preparing for an attack on Belgaum, which was in the Adil Shah&#x27;s possession. Around this time, Krishnadevaraya fell ill and eventually died in 1529, succeeded by his brother, Achyuta Deva Raya.

==Internal affairs==

During his reign he kept strict control over his ministers, and dealt severely with any minister who committed misdeeds. He abolished obnoxious taxes such as the marriage fee. To increase revenues, he brought new lands under cultivation, ordering the deforestation of some areas and undertook a large-scale work to obtain water for irrigation around Vijayanagara. Foreign travellers such as Paes, Nunez and Barbosa who visited Vijayanagara spoke highly of the efficiency of his administration and the prosperity of the people during his reign.

The administration of the empire was carried along the lines indicated in his Amuktamalyada. He was of the opinion that the King should always rule with an eye towards Dharma. His concern for the welfare of the people is amply proved by his extensive annual tours all over the empire, during which he studied everything personally and tried to redress the grievances of the people and punish evildoers. With regard to the promotion of the economic progress of his people, Krishnadevaraya says: &quot;the extent of the kingdom is the means for the acquisition of wealth. Therefore even if the land is limited in extent, excavate tanks and canals and increase the prosperity of the poor by leasing him the land for low ari and koru, so that you may obtain wealth as well as religious merit.&quot;

==Art and literature==
Krishnadevaraya was noted to be linguistically neutral as he ruled a multilingual empire. He is known to have patronised poets and issued inscriptions in languages as varied as Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu and Tamil. Krishnadevaraya himself was a polyglot, fluent in Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu and Tamil. The official language of the Vijayanagara court was Kannada.

Krishnadevaraya patronized literature in various languages. The rule of Krishnadevaraya was an age of prolific literature in many languages, although it is particularly known as a golden age of Telugu literature. Many Telugu, Kannada, Sanskrit, and Tamil poets enjoyed the patronage of the emperor, who was fluent in many languages. The king himself composed an epic Telugu poem Amuktamalyada. His Sanskrit works include ‘Madalasa Charita’, ‘Satyavadu Parinaya’, ‘Rasamanjari’ and ‘Jambavati Kalyana’.

The Telugu poet Mukku Timmanna praised him as a great general and stated: &quot;O Krishnaraya, you Man-Lion. You destroyed the Turks from far away with just your great name&#x27;s power. Oh Lord of the elephant king, just from seeing you the multitude of elephants ran away in horror.&quot;

===Telugu literature===
The rule of Krishnadevaraya is known as golden age of Telugu
literature. Eight Telugu poets were regarded as eight pillars of his literary assembly and known as Ashtadiggajas. Krishna Dev Raya himself composed an epic Telugu poem Amuktamalyada.

During the reign of Krishnadevaraya Telugu culture and literature flourished and reached their heyday. The great emperor was himself a celebrated poet having composed Amuktamalyada. In the olden days, it was believed that eight elephants were holding the earth in eight different directions. The title Ashtadiggajas celebrates this belief and hence the court was also called Bhuvana Vijayam (Conquest of the World). This period of the Empire is known as the &quot;Prabandha Period,&quot; because of the quality of the prabandha literature it produced.
* Allasani Peddana is considered to be the greatest and given the title of &quot;Andhra Kavita Pitamaha&quot; (the father of Telugu poetry). &quot;Svarocisha Sambhava&quot; or &quot;Manucharita&quot;, his popular prabandha work, was dedicated to Krishnadevaraya
* Nandi Thimmana wrote Parijathapaharanam
* Madayyagari Mallana wrote &quot;Rajasekhara Charitramu&quot;
* Dhurjati wrote &quot;Kalahasti Mahatyamu&quot; and &quot;Kalahastisvara Satakamu&quot;
* Ayyalaraju Ramabhadrudu wrote &quot;Sakalakatha Sangraha&quot; and &quot;Ramaabhyudayamu&quot;
* Pingali Surana wrote &quot;Raghava Pandaviyamu&quot;, &quot;Kalapurnodayam&quot; and &quot;Prabhavate Pradyamana&quot;
::– &quot;Raghavapandaveeyamu&quot; is a dual work with double meaning built into the text, describing both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
::– &quot;Kalapurnodayam&quot; (&quot;full bloom of art&quot;) has been considered the first original poetic novel in Telugu literature
* Battumurthy, alias Ramarajabhushanudu, wrote &quot;Kavyalankarasangrahamu&quot;, &quot;Vasucharitra&quot;, &quot;Narasabhupaliyam&quot; and &quot;Harischandranalopakhyanamu&quot;, a dual work which tells simultaneously the story of King Harishchandra and Nala and Damayanti
* Tenali Ramakrishna first wrote &quot;Udbhataradhya Charitramu,&quot; a Shaivite work. However, he later converted to Vaishnavism and wrote the Vaishnava devotional texts &quot;Panduranga Mahatmyamu&quot;, and &quot;Ghatikachala Mahatmyamu.&quot; Tenali Rama remains one of the most popular folk figures in India today, a quick-witted courtier ready even to outwit the all-powerful emperor.

Other well-known poets were Sankusala Nrisimha Kavi, who wrote &quot;Kavikarna Rasayana&quot;, Chintalapudi Ellaya, who wrote &quot;Radhamadhavavilasa&quot; and &quot;Vishnumayavilasa&quot;, the poet Molla, who wrote a version of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Kamsali Rudrakavi, who wrote &quot;Nirankusopakhyana&quot;, and Addamki Gangadhara, who wrote &quot;Tapatlsamvarana&quot; and &quot;Basavapurana&quot;. Manumanchi Bhatta wrote a scientific work on veterinary science called &quot;Haya lakshanasara&quot;.

===Kannada literature===
He patronised several Kannada poets. Among them Mallanarya, who wrote &quot;Veera-shaivamruta&quot;, &quot;Bhava-chinta-ratna&quot; and &quot;Satyendra Chola-kathe&quot;; Chatu Vittalanatha who wrote &quot;Bhagavatha&quot; and Timmanna Kavi wrote a eulogy of his king in &quot;Krishna Raya Bharata&quot;. Vyasatirtha, the noted Dvaita saint from Mysore (of the Madhva tradition) was the emperor&#x27;s &quot;Rajaguru&quot; (&quot;royal guru&quot;). The writing &quot;Krishna Deva Rayana Dinachari&quot; in Kannada is a recently discovered work. The record highlights the contemporary society during Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s time in his personal diary. However, it is not yet clear if the record was written by the king himself.

Purandara Dasa, &quot;widely considered the father of Carnatic music&quot; was closely associated with the empire. He extolled the Madhwa philosophy in his compositions and was a disciple of the &quot;Rajaguru&quot; of the emperor. According to Sambamoorthy, he was born as Srinivasa and had his formal initiation by Vyasatirtha took place around 1525 when he was about 40 years of age, when he was given the name Purandara Dasa. Purandara Daasa traveled extensively in southern India composing and rendering them in praise of his god Purandara Vittala. He spent his last years in Hampi where he rendered his compositions in Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s court.

===Tamil literature===

Krishnadevaraya patronised the Tamil poet Haridasa, and Tamil literature soon began to flourish as the years passed by.

===Sanskrit literature===
In Sanskrit, Vyasatirtha wrote &quot;Bhedojjivana&quot;, &quot;Tatparyachandrika&quot;, &quot;Nyayamrita&quot; (a work directed against the Advaita philosophy) and &quot;Tarkatandava&quot;. Krishnadevaraya, himself an accomplished scholar, wrote &quot;Madalasa Charita&quot;, &quot;Satyavadu Parinaya&quot; and &quot;Rasamanjari&quot; and &quot;Jambavati Kalyana&quot;.

==Religion and culture==
Krishnadevaraya respected all sects of Hinduism. He is known to have encouraged and supported various sects and their places of worship. He rebuilt the Virupaksha Temple and other Shiva shrines. He gave land grants to the temples of Tirumala, Srisailam, Amaravati, Chidambaram, Ahobilam, and Tiruvannamalai. He lavished on the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple numerous objects of priceless value, ranging from diamond studded crowns to golden swords to nine kinds of precious gems. Krishnadevaraya made Venkateshwara his patron deity. He visited the temple seven times. Out of the around 1,250 temple epigraphs published by the Tirumala Devasthanam, 229 are attributed to Krishnadevaraya. A statue of Krishnadevaraya with two of his wives is found at the temple complex of Tirumala. These statues are still visible at the temple at the exit. He also contributed in building parts of the Srisailam temple complex where he had rows of mandapas built.

Sri Vaishnavas claim that Krishnadevaraya himself was formally initiated into the Sri Vaishnava tradition and that&#x27;s why he wrote a Telugu work on Andal, a Tamil Sri Vaishnava female saint, called the Amuktamalyada. They claim that Venkata Tathacharya of the Sri Vaishnava sect was Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s &quot;rajaguru,&quot; and he was considered influential. But the Madhva text &quot;Vyasayogicarita&quot; the biography of Madhva seer Vyasatirtha says that the &quot;kulaguru&quot; of Krishnadevaraya. A manuscript from Madras Oriental Manuscript Library which is from a book written by Krishnadevaya himself in which Krishnadevaraya himself wrote that Vyasatirtha is his Rajaguru.&quot;

<text>Mobile radio telephone systems were mobile telephony systems that preceded modern cellular network technology. Since they were the predecessors of the first generation of cellular telephones, these systems are sometimes retroactively referred to as pre-cellular (or sometimes zero generation, that is, 0G) systems. Technologies used in pre-cellular systems included the Push-to-talk (PTT or manual), Mobile Telephone Service (MTS), Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS), and Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMTS) systems. These early mobile telephone systems can be distinguished from earlier closed radiotelephone systems in that they were available as a commercial service that was part of the public switched telephone network, with their own telephone numbers, rather than part of a closed network such as a police radio or taxi dispatching system.

These mobile telephones were usually mounted in cars or trucks (thus called &quot;car phones&quot;), although portable briefcase models were also made. Typically, the transceiver (transmitter-receiver) was mounted in the vehicle trunk and attached to the &quot;head&quot; (dial, display, and handset) mounted near the driver seat. They were sold through WCCs (Wireline Common Carriers, a.k.a. telephone companies), RCCs (Radio Common Carriers), and two-way radio dealers.

== Origins ==
Early examples of this technology include:
*Motorola, in conjunction with the Bell System, operated the first commercial mobile telephone service (MTS) in the US in 1946, as a service of the wireline telephone company. 
*The A-Netz launched in 1952 in West Germany as the country&#x27;s first public commercial mobile phone network. 
*System 1, launched in 1959 in the United Kingdom as the &#x27;Post Office South Lancashire Radiophone Service&#x27;, covering South Lancashire and operated from a telephone exchange in Manchester, is cited as the country&#x27;s first mobile phone network. However, it was manual (needed to be connected via an operator) and for several decades exercised very little coverage.
*The first automatic system was the Bell System&#x27;s IMTS which became available in 1964, offering automatic dialing to and from the mobile.
*The &quot;Altai&quot; mobile telephone system launched into experimental service in 1963 in the Soviet Union, becoming fully operational in 1965; the first automatic mobile phone system in Europe.
*Televerket opened its first manual mobile telephone system in Norway in 1966. Norway was later the first country in Europe to get an automatic mobile telephone system.
*The Autoradiopuhelin (ARP) launched in 1971 in Finland as the country&#x27;s first public commercial mobile phone network.
*The Automatizovaný městský radiotelefon (AMR) launched in 1978, fully operational in 1983, in Czechoslovakia as the first analog mobile radio telephone in the whole Eastern Bloc.
*The B-Netz launched in 1972 in West Germany as the country&#x27;s second public commercial mobile phone network (albeit the first one that did not require human operators to connect calls).

== Radio Common Carrier ==
Parallel to Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) in the US until the rollout of cellular AMPS systems, a competing mobile telephone technology was called Radio Common Carrier (RCC). The service was provided from the 1960s until the 1980s when cellular AMPS systems made RCC equipment obsolete. These systems operated in a regulated environment in competition with the Bell System&#x27;s MTS and IMTS. RCCs handled telephone calls and were operated by private companies and individuals. Some systems were designed to allow customers of adjacent RCCs to use their facilities, but the universe of RCCs did not comply with any single interoperable technical standard (a capability known in modern systems as &quot;roaming&quot;). For example, the phone of an Omaha, Nebraska-based RCC service would not be likely to work in Phoenix, Arizona. At the end of RCC&#x27;s existence, industry associations were working on a technical standard that would potentially have allowed roaming, and some mobile users had multiple decoders to enable operation with more than one of the common signaling formats (600/1500, 2805, and Reach). Manual operation was often a fallback for RCC roamers.

Roaming was not encouraged, in part because there was no centralized industry billing database for RCCs. Signaling formats were not standardized. For example, some systems used two-tone sequential paging to alert a mobile or handheld that a wired phone was trying to call them. Other systems used DTMF. Some used a system called &quot;Secode 2805&quot; which transmitted an interrupted 2805 Hz tone (in a manner similar to IMTS signaling) to alert mobiles of an offered call. Some radio equipment used with RCC systems was half-duplex, push-to-talk equipment such as Motorola hand-helds or RCA 700-series conventional two-way radios. Other vehicular equipment had telephone handsets, rotary or push-button dialing, and operated full duplex like a conventional wired telephone. A few users had full-duplex briefcase telephones (which were radically advanced for their day).

RCCs used paired UHF 454/459 MHz and VHF 152/158 MHz frequencies near those used by IMTS.

<text>Gioacchino Colombo (9 January 1903 – 24 April 1988) was an Italian automobile engine designer. 


==Biography==
Born in Legnano, Colombo began work as an apprentice to Vittorio Jano at Alfa Romeo. In 1937, he designed the 158 engine for the Alfetta and caught the attention of Enzo Ferrari, who asked Colombo to design a small V12 for his Ferrari marque&#x27;s racing and road cars. The first Ferrari-Colombo engine appeared on 11 May 1947. Colombo&#x27;s most successful work for Ferrari was a tiny 1.5 litre V12, first used in the Tipo 125, 159, and then 166 sports cars. This engine, also known as the &quot;Colombo engine&quot;, was produced for road cars and endurance racing cars for more than 40 years in displacements up to 4.8 L. These included the 3.0 litre Ferrari 250 racing, sports, and GT cars.

Colombo&#x27;s engine was not as successful in Formula One racing. After stunning early success in the 166, the engine was supercharged for use in Formula One but failed to perform well. Unsatisfied with the results, Ferrari brought in fellow designer Aurelio Lampredi to create a large naturally aspirated V12, which replaced Colombo&#x27;s. 

Colombo left Ferrari in 1950 and returned to Alfa Romeo, where he oversaw that company&#x27;s racing efforts - including the Formula One World Championship success that year of Nino Farina and, in 1951, of Juan-Manuel Fangio. In late 1952, Colombo moved on to Maserati where he created the 250F Grand Prix car. Two years later, Colombo headed to newly restarted Bugatti to work on the 251. He then worked for MV Agusta in 1957–1970.

Colombo died in Milan in 1988.

<doc id="1201420" wikidata="Q6649800" url="?curid=1201420" title="Little Dixie (Oklahoma)">
<text>Little Dixie is a name given to southeast Oklahoma, which in the past was strongly influenced by Southern (&quot;Dixie&quot;) culture, as its white settlers were chiefly Southerners seeking a start in new lands following the American Civil War. In addition, it incorporated lands of some of the Five Civilized Tribes, which had been removed from the Southeast. A number were slaveholders, and they generally allied with the Confederacy during the Civil War.

The Oklahoma tourism department also refers to this area as &quot;Choctaw Country,&quot; formerly &quot;Kiamichi Country,&quot; but the Little Dixie region is not clearly defined: Its exact boundaries vary by source. It falls mostly within the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma&#x27;s tribal area, as well as some Chickasaw and Muscogee Creek lands. During the tenure of U.S. Representative Carl Albert (Speaker of the House for most of the 1970s), it was still the 3rd Congressional district of Oklahoma. Redistricting has since changed the district&#x27;s geographical boundaries.

Several towns and cities in southeast Oklahoma use the &quot;Little Dixie&quot; name, and that helps to define the boundaries. A radio station in McAlester is owned by &quot;Little Dixie Radio, Inc.&quot; The band at the public high school in Tishomingo, former capital of the Chickasaw Nation, is called &quot;The Pride of Little Dixie&quot;. When President Harry Truman visited Marietta in Love County in 1948, he gave a speech saying it was a pleasure to be in the Little Dixie region of Oklahoma.

<doc id="1201423" wikidata="Q1980593" url="?curid=1201423" title="Road Fighter">
<text>is a racing arcade video game developed by Konami and released in 1984, and was the first racing game from the company. The goal is to reach the finish line within the stages without running out of time, hitting other cars or running out of fuel (which is refilled by hitting a special type of car). The game spawned a spiritual successor, &quot;Konami GT&quot; (1986), and two sequels, &quot;Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2&quot; (1995) and &quot;Winding Heat&quot; (1996). A Japan-only sequel was also released 14 years later, &quot;Road Fighters&quot; (2010).

==Gameplay==
The first two levels contain four courses, ranging from grassy plains to an over-water bridge to a seashore, mountains and finally a forest area. In the arcade version, six stages were contained. The player controls a red Chevrolet Corvette and pressing the B accelerates the car to around 224 km/h while the A button increases it to 400. The player has a limited amount of fuel points (equal to about 100 seconds) and can earn more by touching special multi-colored cars. If the player collides into any other car or slips on occasionally appearing patches of oil, the car will spin out and if not corrected, may crash into the side barriers, causing a loss of five to six fuel points. The NES and Famicom versions have a total of six types of opponents, one yellow and red, three blue and one truck. Yellow cars travel along a straight line and occur in large numbers. Red cars are less likely to appear, but they will change the lane they are travelling in once to get in the way of the player. Blue cars are the game&#x27;s main &quot;enemies&quot;; they vary in the way they change their lane and attempts to hit the player. Trucks go on a straight way, but colliding with them instantly destroys the player&#x27;s car. Konami Man will make a cameo appearance, flying by the side of the road if the player progresses to a certain point in the level without crashing (not included on course two in NES and Famicom versions).

==Ports==
The game was later released for the MSX home computer system in 1985 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan the same year and in Europe in 1992, and followed the same format as the original. The game was included on &quot;Konami Arcade Classics&quot; in 1999 and on &quot;Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits&quot; for the Nintendo DS. The arcade game was released for i-mode phones in Japan in 2005.

&quot;Road Fighter&quot; was made available on Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Game Room&quot; service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on March 24, 2010. It was also released through Hamster&#x27;s &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; lineup for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on July 25, 2019.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Road Fighter&quot; on their January 1, 1985 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

In Europe, &quot;Computer Gamer&quot; magazine reported in 1985 that the &quot;Street Fighter game&quot; was a commercial success in arcades.

==Legacy==
===&quot;Konami GT&quot;===
===&quot;Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2&quot;===

&quot;Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Road Fighter&quot;, released in arcades in March 1996, and on the PlayStation in 1997. While the arcade version was released worldwide, the PlayStation version was only released in Japan and Europe. In Europe, the PlayStation version is just titled &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, removing the &quot;Road Fighter&quot; connection. Its main selling point was that it allows the player to shift back and forth between manual and automatic transmission during races. Although different from the 2-D &quot;Road Fighter&quot;, the scenery is similar to other racing games set in Japan such as &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage&quot; and &quot;Wangan Midnight&quot;, except the cars are not licensed. The player also has a unique selection of normal cars and tuned cars.

====Car list====
* Honda NSX
* Toyota Supra
* Mazda RX-7
* Nissan Skyline GT-R
* Porsche 911 (non-playable)
* Mercedes-Benz SL500 (non-playable)

====Reception====
Reviewing the arcade version, &quot;Next Generation&quot; praised the support for up to four players, challenging AI, multiple tracks, ability to switch between manual and automatic mid-race, tight controls, powerslides, car selection, and generally fast-paced racing, but nonetheless concluded the game to be only slightly above average, and scored it three out of five stars.

===&quot;Winding Heat&quot;===

&quot;Winding Heat&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Road Fighter&quot; and &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, released in arcades in 1996. It first appeared in arcades in September, though most arcades did not receive their units until later. It is an improved version of &quot;Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2&quot;, though it has more of the normal or tuned cars, and the rules remain the same. Unlike &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, it takes place on touge roads.

The cabinet came in two configurations: a sitdown version with a 50-inch monitor and an upright version with a 25-inch monitor. Cabinets can be linked to support up to four players.

* &quot;Butlins&quot; (1999) 
* &quot;Trecco Bay&quot; (1999–2005)

===&quot;Road Fighters&quot; (2010)===
&quot;Road Fighters&quot; is the Japan-only sequel to the original &quot;Road Fighter&quot;, released in arcades in 2010. The game features 3D-enhanced graphics, with a mounted pair of goggles used to view the effect. Tracks are set in real-life locations and are all based on race courses from previous Konami racing titles, including &quot;Enthusia Professional Racing&quot; and the &quot;GTI Club&quot; series. The game includes numerous licensed vehicles, which can be saved using Konami&#x27;s e-AMUSEMENT Pass containing tuning and customization data. This game is Konami&#x27;s answer to Sega&#x27;s &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 4&quot; and Namco&#x27;s &quot;Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune&quot; in terms of card-based games, or Taito&#x27;s &quot;Chase H.Q. 2&quot; in terms of sequels.

Its opening theme &quot;Take Me Higher&quot; was composed (together with the system music) by Sota Fujimori and it was included on beatmania IIDX 18 Resort Anthem as a playable song.

<text>Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel (13 January 1690 – 27 November 1749) was a German composer of the Baroque era.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Stölzel was born in Grünstädtel in Saxony on 13 January 1690. His father, organist in Grünstädtel, gave him his first music education. When he was thirteen, he was sent to study in Schneeberg, where he was taught music, including thoroughbass, by cantor Christian Umlaufft, a former student of Johann Kuhnau. A few years later he was admitted to the gymnasium in Gera, where he further practiced music under Emanuel Kegel, the director of the court chapel. Some of his educators took a dim view of music, and tried to divert his attention from it: apart from engaging in poetry and oratory, Stölzel nonetheless continued to develop his interest in music.

In 1707 he became a student of theology in Leipzig. The city had a lot to offer from a musical point of view: its opera had been reopened shortly before, which Stölzel liked to visit. He became acquainted with Melchior Hoffmann, at the time music director of the Neukirche and conductor of the Collegium Musicum, both in succession of Georg Philipp Telemann, who had left Leipzig in 1705. Perfecting his art under Hoffmann, Stölzel also acted as his copyist, and started composing: initially Hoffmann performed these compositions as his own, Stölzel gradually coming to the open as their composer.

===As a composer===
In 1710 Stölzel went to Breslau in Silesia, where his first opera, &quot;Narcissus&quot;, on his own libretto, was performed in 1711. Returning to Halle after over two years in Silesia, he composed the operas &quot;Valeria&quot;, instigated by Johann Theile, for Naumburg, and &quot;Rosen und Dornen der Liebe&quot; for Gera. In 1713 he composed two further operas on his own librettos, &quot;Artemisia&quot; and &quot;Orion&quot;, both premiered in Naumburg.

Late in 1713 he travelled to Italy, where he met composers like Johann David Heinichen and Antonio Vivaldi in Venice, Francesco Gasparini in Florence and Domenico Scarlatti and Antonio Bononcini in Rome. Returning after more than a year, he spent some time in Innsbruck, and travelled over Linz to Prague where he worked for nearly three years (1715–17).

In 1715 the post of Kapellmeister at the court of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen became vacant. Stölzel applied, but Prince Christian William I promoted Johann Balthasar Christian Freißlich, the court organist, to Kapellmeister in 1716. Court musicians such as Johann Christoph Rödiger felt disappointed with their master&#x27;s choice.

In Prague Stölzel premiered three more operas, several oratorios, masses, and many instrumental compositions. Stölzel was for a short time court Kapellmeister in Bayreuth (1717–18) and in Gera (1719). His opera &quot;Diomedes&quot; was premiered in 1718 in Bayreuth. Stölzel married Christiana Dorothea Knauer on 25 May 1719. They had nine sons and one daughter. Three sons died at a young age.

On 24 November 1719 Stölzel assumed the position of Kapellmeister at the court in Gotha, where he worked under the dukes Frederick II and Frederick III of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg until his death in 1749.

Stölzel wrote several theoretical works about music, but only one of these was published during his lifetime: a treatise on the composition of canons, of which 400 copies were printed in 1725.

In 1720 Prince Günther I succeeded his father in Sondershausen. He too regretted his father&#x27;s choice for the court Kapellmeister. He asked Stölzel to provide music for the court chapel. However, Stölzel did not comply with this request until 1730, when Freißlich was leaving for Danzig (where he was appointed in 1731). Until Günther&#x27;s death in 1740 Stölzel provided music for the Sondershausen court, which included four cycles of church cantatas, other sacred music, and secular music such as serenatas.

In 1739 Stölzel became a member of Lorenz Christoph Mizler&#x27;s . As a member of this Society he composed a cantata and wrote a treatise on the recitative, which was published as &quot;Abhandlung vom Recitativ&quot; in the 20th century.

===Final years===
The last two years of his life Stölzel suffered from ill health, becoming feeble-minded (&quot;im Haupte schwach&quot;). Some of Stölzel&#x27;s manuscripts were sold to cover expenses. He died 27 November 1749 in Gotha, less than 60 years old. Mizler printed Stölzel&#x27;s obituary as second of three (of which Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s was the third), in the fourth volume of his &quot;&quot;, the organ of the Society of Musical Sciences.

==Compositions==

According to an 18th-century source Stölzel would have composed eight double cantata cycles.

Stölzel composed twelve complete annual cycles of sacred cantatas, which amounts to 1,358 cantatas. 1,215 of these are at least partially extant, 605 surviving with music. Additionally, Stölzel set cantatas to secular texts.

Among his extant compositions are a Brockes Passion of 1725, two &quot;Christmas Oratorios&quot;, made of cantatas, and a &quot;Deutsche Messe&quot; (German Mass), a Lutheran Mass consisting of Kyrie and Gloria, in German, set for four-part choir, strings and basso continuo. Extant instrumental works include four concerti grossi, many sinfonias, and a concerto for oboe d&#x27;amore. He also wrote for organ and harpsichord.

His five operas, &quot;Diomedes&quot; (1718), &quot;Narcissus&quot;, &quot;Valeria&quot;, &quot;Artemisia&quot;, and &quot;Orion&quot;, have not survived. Stölzel is reputed to have composed over 18 orchestral suites alone (none survive), as well as 90 serenatas (vocal pieces performed as &quot;table music&quot;).

Half of Stölzel&#x27;s output, never engraved, is lost. Out of what had to have been thousands of compositions in Gotha, only twelve manuscripts survive there today. The archive at Schloss Sondershausen retains many of his manuscripts, found in a box behind the organ in 1870.

==Reception==
Stölzel enjoyed an outstanding reputation in his lifetime. Shortly after his death some of his compositions were still performed, and Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg rated him slightly above Bach in his list of prominent composers of the 18th century. By the 19th century he was largely forgotten. From the second half of the 20th century there was an increase of musicological research about the composer, and recordings of his work.
===Contemporaries===
Before he settled in Gotha for the last thirty years of his life Stölzel had already seen his music performed from Germany to Italy. His operas had been staged in several major cities in the 1710s. His sacred music was performed from Catholic Prague to the Protestant German principalities. Even after his music production became concentrated on Gotha and Sondershausen, his music was still performed outside these places. One of his operas was performed in Altenburg in 1722, the Saitenspiel cantata cycle was performed under Johann Friedrich Fasch in Zerbst in 1724–25, and the first Passion he had composed for Gotha, and reworked around 1730, was taken up in several German cities:
* Johann Sebastian Bach performed &quot;Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld&quot; on Good Friday in Leipzig.
* In 1736 the Passion was performed as &quot;Geistliche Und Heilige Betrachtungen der Gläubigen Seele über Ihren Leidenden und Sterbenden Jesum&quot; in Rudolstadt, and in a similar version (&quot;Der Glaubigen Seele geistliche Betrachtungen Ihres leidenden Jesu&quot;) in Nürnberg.
Bach didn&#x27;t only perform the work: around 1742–43 he reworked the aria &quot;Dein Kreuz, o Bräutgam meiner Seelen&quot; from &quot;Die leidende und am Kreuz sterbende Liebe Jesu&quot; into &quot;Bekennen will ich seinen Namen&quot;, BWV 200. The music of this work had originally been believed to have been Bach&#x27;s own.

Before that, Bach and his family had shown their interest in various genres of Stölzel&#x27;s music:
* Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach: in the 1720s Bach copied a four-movement harpsichord suite &quot;Partia di Signore Steltzeln&quot; (Partita by Mr. Stölzel) as 48th piece in the Klavierbüchlein (keyboard-booklet) of his eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann, adding a Trio (BWV 929) of his own hand to its last movement, a Minuet.
* Possibly in the period 1732–35 Bach performed cantatas of Stölzel&#x27;s Namebook cycle in Leipzig.
* From the first Sunday after Trinity 1735 to Trinity Sunday the next year Bach probably performed Stölzel&#x27;s entire String-Music cantata cycle in Leipzig&#x27;s churches. Text booklets containing Schmolck&#x27;s librettos and the chorales Stölzel had added to his settings of these librettos, were printed for the Leipzig church services in that period.
* &quot;Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach&quot;: some time after 1733–34 Anna Magdalena Bach noted &quot;Bist du bei mir&quot;, BWV 508, based on the aria &quot;Bist du bei mir geh ich mit Freuden&quot; from Stölzel&#x27;s opera &quot;Diomedes&quot;, in her notebook. For a long time the music of this aria was misattributed to her husband Johann Sebastian.

Johann Mattheson reckoned Stölzel among &quot;the level-headed, learned, and great music masters&quot; of his century. Lorenz Christoph Mizler rated Stölzel as great as Johann Sebastian Bach.

===Next generation===

Georg Benda, Stölzel&#x27;s immediate successor at the court in Gotha, restaged church music of his predecessor, sometimes with score revisions, until 1768: Passion settings and many cantatas such as the 1728–29 double cantata cycle (restaged in the liturgical years 1752–53, 1763–64 and 1765–66) were included in such repeat performances. Stölzel&#x27;s legacy was however disintegrating through sales of manuscripts, which court musicians had continued after the composer&#x27;s death. In 1778 Benda wrote: &quot;... Only the best works of my predecessor, which could be used even today for church music, are saved, because already a long time ago I separated them from useless junk and kept them in my own house.&quot;

Through Benda&#x27;s neglect manuscripts of Stölzel&#x27;s works in Gotha were lost. In Sondershausen Stölzel&#x27;s works were copied, performed and conserved. Surprisingly Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf did not list any church cantatas by Stölzel in his catalogues of 1761, 1764 and 1770. Johann Kirnberger considered Stölzel to be one of the greatest contrapuntists, and illustrated his &quot;Die Kunst des reinen Satzes&quot; with music by Stölzel. C. P. E. Bach adopted several movements of Stölzel&#x27;s &quot;Sechs geistlichen Betrachtungen des leidenden und sterbenden Jesus&quot; in his 1771 &quot;Lukas-Passion&quot; and his 1772 &quot;Johannes-Passion&quot; pasticcios. After C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s death in 1788 three of Stölzel&#x27;s cantata cycles were found in his legacy.

Reference works by Johann Adam Hiller (1784) and Ernst Ludwig Gerber (early 1790s) contain biographies of Stölzel. Hiller describes part of Stölzel&#x27;s music production as &quot;heard today and forgotten tomorrow&quot;: over-all light in spirit and, according to the standards of the time when these pieces originated, with pleasurable singing lines over a sparse instrumental accompaniment. Hiller qualifies Stölzel&#x27;s choral music as full in texture and rich in harmony, and names the &quot;Canonic Mass in thirteen real voices&quot; and the German Te Deum as examples of Stölzel&#x27;s accomplished style, fully mastering the composition of canons and fugues. Gerber largely repeats Hiller&#x27;s biographical notes and judgement about Stölzel&#x27;s music, adding descriptions of Stölzel&#x27;s 1736 double cantata cycle and vocal chamber music, where the singing voice is treated as an instrumental part, in some passages rather an accompaniment than the leading voice. Gerber praises Stölzel for his art of composing recitatives and summarizes the content of the then still unpublished &quot;Abhandlung vom Recitative&quot;.

===Manuscript conservation and publications===
 collected manuscripts of Stölzel&#x27;s music, many of these ending up in the Berlin State Library. Pölchau edited Stölzel&#x27;s &quot;Missa canonica for thirteen real voices&quot; for publication in 1818. Pölchau offered a copy of this edition to Carl Friedrich Zelter, leader of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. In 1832 Pölchau published a selection of Stölzel&#x27;s choral music. In the first half of the 19th century one of Stölzel&#x27;s masses was copied by Johann Gottfried Schicht, and, with the orchestral part arranged for organ by Carl Ferdinand Becker, performed in Leipzig. Becker also arranged some of Stölzel&#x27;s music for organ solo.

The pieces from the Anna Magdalena and Wilhelm Friedemann Bach notebooks, &quot;Bist du bei mir&quot; and &quot;Partita di Signore Steltzeln&quot;, were published by the Bach Gesellschaft in the second half of the 19th century. Stölzel&#x27;s solo cantata &quot;Die Rose bleibt der Blumen Königin&quot; was published in 1884. Arnold Schering published Stölzel&#x27;s &quot;Concerto Grosso a quattro Chori&quot; in 1907. The aria BWV 200 was first published, as a composition by Johann Sebastian Bach, in 1935. The trio sonata in F minor for 2 violins or oboes and basso continuo was published in 1937. In 1938 Wolfgang Schmidt-Weiss wrote a thesis about Stölzel&#x27;s instrumental music, which was published as a book in 1939.

The 1940s and 1950s saw a number of score publications:
* In 1942 a trio sonata for flute, violin and continuo was published.
* In 1948 Merseburger published the cantata &quot;Aus der Tiefe rufe ich&quot; (H. 442).
* A Sonata for oboe, horn, violin and continuo was published around 1952.
* The Concerto for Oboe, strings &amp; continuo in D major was published in 1953, with a piano reduction by G. Müller.
* Hans Albrecht prepared the Christmas cantata &quot;Kündlich gross ist das gottselige Geheimnis&quot; for publication in 1953, and edited the chorale and aria &quot;Lob und Dank&quot; for publication in 1954.
* A trio sonata for Flute, Violin and Harpsichord was published in 1955.
* Around the mid-1950s Josef Bachmair edited two trio sonatas for two violins and continuo: the Sonata V and the Sonata in B-flat major.
* Around the same time Gotthold Frotscher published the trio sonatas in D major for flute, violin and continuo, and in G major for two flutes and continuo.

The New Bach Edition republished the three Bach-related pieces in the second half of the 20th century. The Concerto for Oboe and Violin in F major was published in 1963. In the 1970s Jean Thilde published, in a series named after Maurice André, several compositions of the baroque era in an arrangement for trumpet, including, by Stölzel, the D major oboe concerto (1972), the F major double concerto (in 1975 with a piano reduction of the orchestral material and in 1976 with the orchestral score), a sonata in D major after the &quot;Sonata V&quot; for two violins (1976), a concertino in E minor (1976), a concerto in C (1976), and a concerto in B-flat (1976).

In 1965 Fritz Hennenberg wrote a two-volume thesis about Stölzel&#x27;s cantatas. In 1976 an updated version of that thesis was published in one volume as &quot;Das Kantatenschaffen von Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel&quot;. An Urtext edition of the G minor Oboe Concerto was published in 1979. The cantata &quot;Ich bin beide&quot; was published in 1981. Stölzel&#x27;s &quot;O wie ist die Barmherzigkeit des Herrn so groß&quot; was published in 1989. Two sonatas, Nos. 3 and 4 of the eight sonatas à quattro for oboe, violin, horn and basso continuo collection, were published in 1993. Hofmeister published the fifth Sonata à Quattro for oboe, violin, horn and basso continuo in 2001.

Stölzel&#x27;s Ave Regina, &quot;Sind wir denn Kinder&quot;, &quot;Ehre sei Gott&quot;, and a new edition of the 1725 cantata &quot;Kündlich groß ist das gottselige Geheimnis&quot; were published in 2003. Stölzel&#x27;s 1725 setting of the &quot;Brockes-Passion&quot; was also published in the first decade of the 21st century. The 1772 &quot;St. John Passion&quot; pasticcio which included four movements by Stölzel was published as Vol. 7.1 in Series IV of C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s complete works. The &quot;German Te Deum&quot; was published in 2010.

In the 21st century facsimiles of large portions of Stölzel&#x27;s work became available on websites such as those of the Berlin State Library and the Saxon State and University Library Dresden.

===Recordings===

The vocal music that was published as part of the Bach legacy is frequently recorded:
* &quot;Bist du bei mir&quot; is by far Stölzel&#x27;s most often recorded piece of music.
* BWV 200 has been recorded over 20 times since 1951.

Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau recorded the cantata &quot;Aus der Tiefe rufe ich, Herr, zu Dir&quot;, H. 442, in the early 1950s, and again, for Deutsche Grammophon, in 1965. Erik van Nevel, conducting the Ricercar Consort, recorded this cantata in 1991. Günter Wand recorded the Concerto grosso a quattro chori in 1956. Carl Schuricht&#x27;s performance of the work at the Salzburger Festspiele was recorded in 1961.

Maurice André performed the D major Oboe Concerto as a trumpet concerto, and recorded it several times, for example in the 1960s for Philips, in 1977 with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Charles Mackerras, and in 1983 with the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields conducted by Neville Marriner. In 1971 he recorded Stölzel&#x27;s Concerto Grosso a Quatri Chori with five other trumpetists, Pierre Pierlot on the oboe and the Jean-François Paillard Chamber Orchestra conducted by Philippe Caillard. In 1980 André recorded the Sonata in D major, reconstructed and orchestrated by Thilde after Stölzel.

André Bernard&#x27;s recording of the D major trumpet concerto appeared in 1973. The Ricercar Consort recorded and released the of the Brussels Conservatory in 1988.

Stölzel&#x27;s Brockes Passion, in a performance conducted by Ludger Rémy, was recorded in 1997.

Rémy also recorded ten (half) cantatas from the Christmas season 1736–37 in Sondershausen, released as &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; on two CDs:
* CD 1 (recorded May 1999):
** for the first day of Christmas:
*** &quot;Ach, dass die Hülfe aus Zion über Israel käme&quot;
*** &quot;Ehre sei Gott in der Höhe&quot;
** for the second day of Christmas:
*** &quot;Ich sehe den Himmel offen&quot;
*** &quot;Ihr sollt nicht wähnen&quot;
** for the third day of Christmas:
*** &quot;Kündlich gross ist das gottselige Geheimnis&quot;
* CD 2 (recorded January 2000):
** for the Sunday after Christmas:
*** &quot;Das Alte is vergangen&quot;
*** &quot;Das Ende eines Dinges ist besser denn sein Anfang&quot;
** for New Year&#x27;s Day:
*** &quot;Alles, was ihr tut mit Worten oder Werken&quot;
** for Epiphany:
*** &quot;Danksaget dem Vater&quot;
*** &quot;Wir haben ein festes prophetisches Wort&quot;

Rémy&#x27;s recordings of the 16 chamber cantatas were released on two CDs, in 2002 and 2004 respectively.

C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s 1772 &quot;Johannes-Passion&quot; pasticcio, containing some movements by Stölzel, was recorded in 2003.

Rémy&#x27;s &quot;Cantatas for Pentecost&quot; CD was released in 2004, containing:
* Three double cantatas for the Pentecost season of 1737:
*# &quot;Werdet voll Geistes&quot;
*# &quot;Siehe da, eine Hütte&quot;
*# &quot;Wollte Gott, dass alle das Volk&quot;
*# &quot;Daran ist erschienen die Liebe&quot;
*# &quot;So denn ihr, die ihr arg seid&quot;

<text>Women&#x27;s Aid Federation of England, commonly called Women&#x27;s Aid within England, is one of a group of charities across the United Kingdom. There are four main Women&#x27;s Aid Federations, 3 for each of the countries of the United Kingdom, and one for the Republic of Ireland (not being part of the UK). Its aim is to end domestic violence against women and children. The charity works at both local and national levels to ensure women&#x27;s safety from domestic violence and promotes policies and practices to prevent domestic violence.

Women&#x27;s Aid Federation of England is the sole national co-ordinating body for the England-wide network of over 370 local domestic violence organisations, providing over 500 refuges, outreach, advocacy and children&#x27;s support services. Women&#x27;s Aid campaigns for better legal protection and services and in partnership with its national network, runs public awareness and education campaigns. Any woman can stay at a refuge (and take their children) and proof of abuse is not needed to stay at a refuge.

Women&#x27;s Aid provides services through its publications and website, and runs a Freephone 24-Hour National Domestic Violence Helpline in partnership with Refuge. Former Spice Girl Melanie Brown became a patron of the charity in 2018 after leaving what she described as an abusive relationship and was made an MBE in 2022 for services to charitable causes and vulnerable women.

Women&#x27;s Aid has faced criticism for uncritically accepting all untested women&#x27;s claims, including false allegations for financial gain or custody advantages, despite the significant repercussions for innocent men, children, benevolent individuals, and taxpayers.

==History==

===Origins===

Women&#x27;s Aid was set up as a national United Kingdom federation to co-ordinate almost 40 services that had been established over the country. It was originally known as the National Women&#x27;s Aid Federation, before the launch of Scottish Women&#x27;s Aid in 1976, and both Welsh Women&#x27;s Aid and the Women&#x27;s Aid Federation Northern Ireland in 1978. The first Women&#x27;s Aid federation was set up in 1974, shortly after the founding of the first refuge for women experiencing domestic violence. The organisation provided practical and emotional support as part of a range of services to women and children experiencing violence. The charity was instrumental in lobbying for the 1976 Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act, and for having women and children at risk of domestic violence to count as homeless under the 1977 Housing Act.

During the 1980s, Women&#x27;s Aid established the first ever National Domestic Violence Helpline service to meet the increasing number of calls to Women&#x27;s Aid national office. The Helpline not only provided help and support for abused women and children, as well as agency professionals seeking advice, it also became a national referral point for access to the national network of refuge and support services. The charity continued to lobby for greater consideration and support for women and children experiencing domestic violence.

Through the 1990s, Women&#x27;s Aid continued its lobbying work, as well as increasing its public campaigning. In 1994, the charity released the first ever domestic violence cinema advert, and supported the television soap opera Brookside in a long-running, high-profile storyline on a family affected by domestic violence. In 1999, Women&#x27;s Aid launched the first comprehensive domestic violence website in the UK and The Gold Book, the first ever UK-wide public directory of local refuge and helpline services.

Since 2000, Women&#x27;s Aid has run a number of high-profile campaigns, continued its work lobbying government, and launched a number of educational resources aimed at schools and teachers to encourage the teaching of healthy relationships as a preventative measure against domestic violence. Katie Ghose was the CEO of Women&#x27;s Aid, having started in July 2017. She took over the post from Polly Neate, and stepped down in February 2019, after complaints from a number of women groups after her public praise of UKIP.

==Research==
In 1978, Women&#x27;s Aid carried out a study of 1,000 women living in refuges, in light of statistics demonstrating that 1 in 4 crimes in Scotland was &#x27;wife assault.&#x27; This was the beginning of significant amounts of research performed by Women&#x27;s Aid and a number of partners into issues around domestic violence, which has developed into the release of Women&#x27;s Aid&#x27;s &#x27;Annual Survey of Members&#x27;, which gives details of the services in England working to support women experiencing domestic violence, and the women who use them.

==Criticism==

Women&#x27;s Aid has faced criticism for its approach to handling unverified claims made by women. Critics argue that the organization uncritically accepts all allegations without sufficient investigation, which can include false accusations made for financial gain or to obtain custody advantages. This practice is said to have severe repercussions, not only for innocent men who may be wrongly accused but also for the children involved, who may suffer from disrupted family relationships. Furthermore, this approach can negatively impact benevolent individuals who support the cause, as well as taxpayers who ultimately fund the legal and social services involved in these cases. The lack of rigorous verification processes is seen as a significant flaw, undermining the credibility of genuine cases and potentially leading to miscarriages of justice and the misuse of resources.

<text>In physical chemistry, the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory explains the aggregation and kinetic stability of aqueous dispersions quantitatively and describes the force between charged surfaces interacting through a liquid medium.
It combines the effects of the van der Waals attraction and the electrostatic repulsion due to the so-called double layer of counterions.
The electrostatic part of the DLVO interaction is computed in the mean field approximation in the limit of low surface potentials - that is when the potential energy of an elementary charge on the surface is much smaller than the thermal energy scale, formula_1. For two spheres of radius formula_2 each having a charge formula_3 (expressed in units of the elementary charge) separated by a center-to-center distance formula_4 in a fluid of dielectric constant formula_5 containing a concentration formula_6 of monovalent ions, the electrostatic potential takes the form of a screened-Coulomb or Yukawa potential,

formula_7

where 
*formula_8 is the Bjerrum length,
*formula_9 is the potential energy,
*formula_10 ≈ 2.71828 is Euler&#x27;s number,
*formula_11 is the inverse of the Debye–Hückel screening length (formula_12); formula_11 is given by formula_14, and
*formula_15 is the thermal energy scale at absolute temperature formula_16

The DLVO theory is named after Boris Derjaguin and Lev Landau, Evert Verwey and Theodoor Overbeek who developed it between 1941 and 1948.

== Overview ==
DLVO theory is a theory of colloidal dispersion stability in which zeta potential is used to explain that as two particles approach one another their ionic atmospheres begin to overlap and a repulsion force is developed. In this theory, two forces are considered to impact on colloidal stability: Van der Waals forces and electrical double layer forces.

The total potential energy is described as the sum of the attraction potential and the repulsion potential. When two particles approach each other, electrostatic repulsion increases and the interference between their electrical double layers increases. However, the Van der Waals attraction also increases as they get closer. At each distance, the net potential energy of the smaller value is subtracted from the larger value.

At very close distances, the combination of these forces results in a deep attractive well, which is referred to as the primary minimum. At larger distances, the energy profile goes through a maximum, or energy barrier, and subsequently passes through a shallow minimum, which is referred to as the secondary minimum.

At the maximum of the energy barrier, repulsion is greater than attraction. Particles rebound after interparticle contact, and remain dispersed throughout the medium. The maximum energy needs to be greater than the thermal energy. Otherwise, particles will aggregate due to the attraction potential. The height of the barrier indicates how stable the system is. Since particles have to overcome this barrier in order to aggregate, two particles on a collision course must have sufficient kinetic energy due to their velocity and mass. If the barrier is cleared, then the net interaction is all attractive, and as a result the particles aggregate. This inner region is often referred to as an energy trap since the colloids can be considered to be trapped together by Van der Waals forces.

For a colloidal system, the thermodynamic equilibrium state may be reached when the particles are in deep primary minimum. At primary minimum, attractive forces overpower the repulsive forces at low molecular distances. Particles coagulate and this process is not reversible. However, when the maximum energy barrier is too high to overcome, the colloid particles may stay in the secondary minimum, where particles are held together but more weakly than in the primary minimum. Particles form weak attractions but are easily redispersed. Thus, the adhesion at secondary minimum can be reversible.

==History==
In 1923, Peter Debye and Erich Hückel reported the first successful theory for the distribution of charges in ionic solutions.
The framework of linearized Debye–Hückel theory subsequently was applied to colloidal dispersions by S. Levine and G. P. Dube
who found that charged colloidal particles should experience a strong medium-range repulsion and a weaker long-range attraction.
This theory did not explain the observed instability of colloidal dispersions against irreversible aggregation in solutions of high ionic strength.
In 1941, Boris Derjaguin and Lev Landau introduced a theory for the stability of colloidal dispersions that invoked a fundamental instability driven by strong but short-ranged van der Waals attractions countered by the stabilizing influence of electrostatic repulsions.
In 1948, Evert Verwey and Theodor Overbeek independently arrived at the same result.
This so-called DLVO theory resolved the failure of the Levine–Dube theory to account for the dependence of colloidal dispersions&#x27; stability on the ionic strength of the electrolyte.

==Derivation==
DLVO theory is the combined effect of van der Waals and double layer force. For the derivation, different conditions must be taken into account and different equations can be obtained. But some useful assumptions can effectively simplify the process, which are suitable for ordinary conditions. The simplified way to derive it is to add the two parts together.

===van der Waals attraction===

van der Waals force is actually the total name of dipole-dipole force, dipole-induced dipole force and dispersion forces, in which dispersion forces are the most important part because they are always present.
Assume that the pair potential between two atoms or small molecules is purely attractive and of the form w = −C/rn, where C is a constant for interaction energy, decided by the molecule&#x27;s property and n = 6 for van der Waals attraction. With another assumption of additivity, the net interaction energy between a molecule and planar surface made up of like molecules will be the sum of the interaction energy between the molecule and every molecule in the surface body. So the net interaction energy for a molecule at a distance D away from the surface will therefore be
formula_17

where 
* is the interaction energy between the molecule and the surface,
* formula_18 is the number density of the surface,
* is the axis perpendicular to the surface and passesding across the molecule, with at the point where the molecule is, and at the surface,
* is the axis perpendicular to the axis, with at the intersection.

Then the interaction energy of a large sphere of radius &quot;R&quot; and a flat surface can be calculated as
formula_19

where
* &quot;W&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) is the interaction energy between the sphere and the surface,
* formula_20 is the number density of the sphere.

For convenience, Hamaker constant &quot;A&quot; is given as
formula_21
and the equation becomes
formula_22

With a similar method and according to Derjaguin approximation, the van der Waals interaction energy between particles with different shapes can be calculated, such as energy between

* two spheres: formula_23
* sphere and surface: formula_24
* two surfaces: formula_25 per unit area.

===Double layer force===

A surface in a liquid may be charged by dissociation of surface groups (e.g. silanol groups for glass or silica surfaces) or by adsorption of charged molecules such as polyelectrolyte from the surrounding solution. This results in the development of a wall surface potential which will attract counterions from the surrounding solution and repel co-ions. In equilibrium, the surface charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions in solution. The region near the surface of enhanced
counterion concentration is called the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL can be approximated by a sub-division into two regions. Ions in the region closest to the charged wall surface are strongly bound to the surface. This immobile layer is called the Stern or Helmholtz layer. The region adjacent to the Stern layer is called the diffuse layer and contains loosely associated ions that are comparatively mobile. The total electrical double layer due to the formation of the counterion layers results in electrostatic screening of the wall charge and minimizes the Gibbs free energy of EDL formation.

The thickness of the diffuse electric double layer is known as the Debye screening length formula_26. At a distance of two Debye screening lengths the electrical potential energy is reduced to 2 percent of the value at the surface wall.

formula_27

with unit of , where
* formula_28 is the number density of ion i in the bulk solution,
* is the valency of the ion (for example, H+ has a valency of +1, and Ca2+ has a valency of +2),
* formula_29 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_5 is the relative static permittivity,
* is the Boltzmann constant.

The repulsive free energy per unit area between two planar surfaces is shown as
formula_31
where
* formula_32 is the reduced surface potential, formula_33,
* formula_34 is the potential on the surface.

The interaction free energy between two spheres of radius &quot;R&quot; is
formula_35

Combining the van der Waals interaction energy and the double layer interaction energy, the interaction between two particles or two surfaces in a liquid can be expressed as
formula_36
where &quot;W&quot;(&quot;D&quot;)R is the repulsive interaction energy due to electric repulsion, and &quot;W&quot;(&quot;D&quot;)A is the attractive interaction energy due to van der Waals interaction.

==Effect of shear flows==
Alessio Zaccone and collaborators investigated the effects of shear-flow on particle aggregation which can play an important role in applications e.g. microfluidics, chemical reactors, atmospheric and environmental flows. Their work showed a characteristic lag-time in the shear-induced aggregation of the particles, which decreases exponentially with the shear rate.

==Application==
Since the 1940s, the DLVO theory has been used to explain phenomena found in colloidal science, adsorption and many other fields. Due to the more recent popularity of nanoparticle research, DLVO theory has become even more popular because it can be used to explain behavior of both material nanoparticles such as fullerene particles and microorganisms. For example, DLVO theory has been widely applied to assess the degree of particle-particle interactions at controlled chemical conditions. For example, it has been used to investigate the colloidal stability of BaSO4 (barium sulfate). and particle-particle interactions between magnesite, dolomite, quartz and serpentine.

==Shortcomings==
Additional forces beyond the DLVO construct have been reported to also play a major role in determining colloid stability.
DLVO theory is not effective in describing ordering processes such as the evolution of colloidal crystals in dilute dispersions with low salt concentrations. It also cannot explain the relation between the formation of colloidal crystals and salt concentrations.

<text>Tirit, also known as trit, is a Turkish dish prepared by soaking broken-up stale bread in a broth prepared from offal, and then seasoned with ground pepper and onion. Some variants add cheese or yogurt.Tirit is based on cooking techniques from Central Asia, where similar dishes were prepared using lamb and leftovers of various kinds, often including stale bread; see kuurdak.

Tirit is sometimes found in the cuisine of Mecca, where the story is told that the morale of a community hungry from famine brought about by a drought was boosted by being sustained by this dish until the return of times of greater plenty.

Khash is a similar offal-based dish eaten in many countries in Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and the southern Caucasus.

Similar combinations of offal and grain are found in haggis and some kinds of white pudding, which use oatmeal as the starch.

The forms of tirit involving cheese are similar to the barley-based Tibetan staple tsampa.

<text>Welsh poetry refers to poetry of the Welsh people or nation. This includes poetry written in Welsh, poetry written in English by Welsh or Wales-based poets, poetry written in Wales in other languages or poetry by Welsh poets around the world.

==History==
Wales has one of the earliest literary traditions in Northern Europe, stretching back to the days of Aneirin (fl. 550) and Taliesin (second half of the 6th century), and the haunting &quot;Stafell Cynddylan&quot;, which is the oldest recorded literary work by a woman in northern Europe.

The 9th-century &quot;Canu Llywarch Hen&quot; and &quot;Canu Heledd&quot; are both associated with the earlier prince Llywarch Hen.

Welsh poetry is connected directly to the bardic tradition, and is historically divided into four periods. The first period, before 1100, is known as the period of &quot;Y Cynfeirdd&quot; (&quot;The earliest poets&quot;) or &quot;Yr Hengerdd&quot; (&quot;The old poetry&quot;). It roughly dates from the emergence of the Welsh language from Common Brittonic in the sixth century to the arrival of the Normans in Wales towards 1100. The second period, the period of the &quot;Poets of the Princes&quot; (&quot;Beirdd y Tywysogion&quot;, also called &quot;Y Gogynfeirdd&quot;), lasted from about 1100 until 1350, or until 1282, the date of the overthrow of Llywelyn. The final classical period of Welsh poetry, referred to as the period of the Poets of the Nobility (&quot;Beirdd yr Uchelwyr&quot;) or simply &quot;Cywyddwyr&quot;, lasted from 1350 to 1600. These included Dafydd ap Gwilym and Iolo Goch, and they produced many &quot;cywyddau&quot;. There was a lull in the production of poetry after the union with England in the 16th century. The year 1600 is generally taken to mark the beginning of modern Welsh poetry.

Throughout this time, serving as a bard was one of the few ways that one might better oneself socially, by becoming either a chief poet or a household poet. Both of these categories of bards could achieve status through a grading system, with the lowest being a minstrel (who was technically an ungraded bard), the lowest graded status of a disciple, a graduated disciple of poetry, a disciplined disciple, a disciple of chief-poet-craft, and finally a chief poet.

The earliest poem in English by a Welsh poet dates from about 1470. More recently, Anglo-Welsh poetry has become an important aspect of Welsh literary culture, as well as influencing English literature.

The works of the great hymn writers of the 18th and 19th centuries are also poetic: in particular William Williams Pantycelyn and Ann Griffiths. Around 1900, there was a renaissance with poets such as T. Gwynn Jones. Other notable writers were T. H. Parry-Williams and D. Gwenallt Jones; and around 1950 others such as Waldo Williams. Many poets in the late 20th century produced work of a high standard, many of them in cynghanedd.

Welsh poets often write under bardic names to conceal their identity in Eisteddfod competitions.

<doc id="1201458" wikidata="Q7253" url="?curid=1201458" title="Padang">
<text>Padang () is the capital and largest city of the Indonesian province of West Sumatra. It had a population of 833,562 at the 2010 Census and 909,040 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 942,938 - comprising 473,089 males and 469,849 females. It is the 16th most populous city in Indonesia and the most populous city on the west coast of Sumatra. The Padang metropolitan area is the third most populous metropolitan area in Sumatra with a population of over 1.7 million. Padang is widely known for its Minangkabau culture, cuisine, and sunset beaches.

The city had historically been a trading center since the pre-colonial era, in both pepper and gold. The Dutch made contact with the city in the mid 17th century, eventually constructing a fortress and taking over control of the city from the Pagaruyung Kingdom. Save for several interruptions of British rule, Padang remained part of the Dutch East Indies as one of its major cities until Indonesian independence. In 1906, Padang, along with Palembang, became the first populated places in Sumatra to achieve city status (&quot;gemeente&quot;).

==History==

Padang has been a trade centre since the 16th century, having been controlled by the Pagaruyung Kingdom and the Aceh Sultanate. During the 16th and 17th centuries, pepper was cultivated and traded with India, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. In 1663, the city came under the authority of the Dutch and a trading post was built in 1680. The city came under the British Empire twice, firstly from 1781 to 1784 during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War and again from 1795 to 1819 during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1819 the city was transferred back to the Netherlands. Up to circa 1780 the most important trade product was gold originating from gold mines in the region. When the mines were exhausted, the focus turned to other products such as coffee, salts, and textiles.

In 1797 Padang was inundated by a tsunami with an estimated flow depth of 5–10 metres, following an earthquake, estimated to be 8.5–8.7 Mw, which occurred off the coast. The shaking caused considerable damage and the deaths of two people, while the tsunami resulted in several houses being washed away and several deaths at the village of Air Manis. Boats moored in the Arau river ended up on dry land, including a 200-ton sailing ship which was deposited about 1 kilometre upstream. In 1833 another tsunami inundated Padang with an estimated flow depth of 3–4 metres as a result of an earthquake, estimated to be 8.6–8.9 Mw, which occurred off Bengkulu. The shaking caused considerable damage in Padang, and due to the tsunami boats moored in the Arau river broke their anchors and were scattered.

In 1837, the Dutch East Indies government made Padang the seat of government of the West Coast of Sumatra (Sumatra&#x27;s Westkust) which included present-day West Sumatra and Tapanuli. Subsequently the city became a &quot;gemeente&quot; area since 1 April 1906 after the issuance of an ordinance (STAL 1906 No.151) on 1 March 1906. Until World War II, Padang was one of the five largest port cities in Indonesia, apart from Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, and Makassar.
The population of Padang in 1920 was 28,754, making it the second largest city in Sumatra after Palembang. At the time of independence in the 1940s, the city had around 50,000 inhabitants. Coffee was still important, but copra was also a major item produced by farmers in its hinterland. Since then, the population growth has been partly a result of growth in the area of the city, but largely a result of the migration to major cities seen in so many developing nations. From 1950 the Ombilin coal field developed with Padang as its outlet port. This was seen by some observers as reflecting the economic and political colonisation of Indonesia.

Upon the entry of the Japanese army on 17 March 1942, Padang was abandoned by the Dutch due to their panic. At the same time, Sukarno was detained in the city because the Dutch at that time wanted to take him with them to escape to Australia. Then the commander of the Japanese Army for Sumatra met him to negotiate the fate of Indonesia. After the Japanese were able to control the situation, the city was then used as an administrative city for development and public works during their occupation of West Sumatra.

On 30 September 2009, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake hit about 50 kilometres off the coast of Padang. There were more than 1,100 fatalities, 313 of which occurred within Padang.

==Geography==
The city of Padang is located on the west coast of the island of Sumatra, with a total area of 694.96 km2, equivalent to 1.65% of the area of West Sumatra. More than 60% of the area of Padang is in the form of hills covered by protection forests. Only around 205.007 km2 of the territory is an urban area. The hills stretch in the east and south of the city. The notable hills in Padang include Lampu Hill, Mount Padang, Gado-Gado Hill, and Pegambiran Hill. The city of Padang has a coastline of 68.126 km on the mainland of Sumatra. In addition, there are also 19 small islands, including Sikuai Island with an area of 4.4 ha in Bungus Teluk Kabung District, and Toran Island covering 25 ha and Pisang Gadang Island in Padang Selatan District.

===Climate===
Padang features a tropical rainforest climate under Köppen&#x27;s climate classification. Since this tropical rainforest climate is more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and cyclones are very rare, it is equatorial. Padang is one of Indonesia&#x27;s wettest cities, with frequent rainfall throughout the course of the year. The city averages roughly 4300 mm of rain per year. Padang&#x27;s driest month is February, where 250 mm of precipitation on average is observed. The city temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, with an average of 26 degrees Celsius. Padang has 21 rivers, with the longest being Batang Kandis with a length of 20 km. In 1980 two-thirds of the city was flooded because the city&#x27;s drainage which primarily empties to Batang Arau could not contain the water.

==Governance==
By 2007 the city government began a number of religiously motivated policies. One requires females of all religious backgrounds who are municipal employees and students in government schools to wear &quot;jilbab&quot; (hijab), and high school students now take classes on reading the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;. Municipal employees are required to pay &quot;zakat&quot;.

===Administrative districts===

The city of Padang is divided into eleven districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census together with the official estimates as of mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;) in each district, and its post codes.

===Adipura award===
As of 2017, Padang had received the &quot;Adipura&quot; (cleanest and greenest city) award in the category of large city 18 times and the &quot;Adipura Kencana&quot; award three times.

==Culture==
===Cuisine===

The cuisine of the Minangkabau people is commonly called Padang cuisine. Padang restaurants are common throughout the country and are famous for their spicy food. Padang food is usually cooked once per day, and all customers choose from those dishes, which are left out on display until no food is left. It is served in small portions of various dishes, but constituting, with rice, a complete meal. Customers take – and pay for – only what they want from this array of dishes. The best known Padang dish is rendang, a spicy meat stew. &quot;Soto Padang&quot; (crispy beef in spicy soup) is local residents&#x27; breakfast favourite, meanwhile &quot;sate&quot; (beef satay in curry sauce served with ketupat) is a treat in the evening.

==Tourism==

Padang is a common transit point for surfers travelling to Batu Islands and Mentawai Islands, and for tourists visiting the West Sumatran highlands.

<doc id="1201462" wikidata="Q805148" url="?curid=1201462" title="Ballance (video game)">
<text>Ballance is a 3D puzzle video game for Microsoft Windows. It was developed by German studio Cyparade, published by Atari Europe, and first released in Europe on 2 April 2004. The gameplay is similar to &quot;Marble Madness&quot;, in that the player controls a ball via keyboard, moving it along a course while trying not to fall off the screen.

==Gameplay==

In the game, the player controls a rolling ball and must guide it throughout the game&#x27;s 13 levels (12 levels originally; another downloadable level, level 13 &quot;Speed&quot;, is available on the developer&#x27;s homepage). It can be transformed into a wood, stone, or paper ball via specialized transformer pads, which give the ball varying weights, affecting gameplay.

The wooden ball is very stable and can be used for several puzzles in the game. The player initially launches into and leaves all levels with a wooden ball.

The stone ball is extremely heavy, and can be accidentally rolled off an edge very easily, but can easily push down specific objects like boxes and bridges. Furthermore, rolling a stone ball through a bridge made of planks will make the bridge collapse.

The paper ball is very light. Its surface is not smooth, unlike the wooden and stone balls, and so its movement is slightly variable. A paper ball can be blown into the air by ventilators and can roll up steep hills easily.

Two power-ups are available. If the ball rolls into them they provide either an extra ball or extra points. Checkpoints are scattered evenly across levels so that if a player falls off the course they only have to restart the game from the last checkpoint reached.

There are 12 levels, which progress in difficulty throughout the runtime. On occasion, the player has to push other balls down slopes and holes or onto rails to continue rolling along the path. Each level requires the player to complete physical challenges, which often involve puzzles about physics or routing. The side-rail is introduced in level 3, requiring the player&#x27;s ball to roll on its side along two rails which are aligned vertically one above the other. In level 12, the player&#x27;s ball has to balance on the center of the mono-rail, which is composed of only one rail. 

==Reception==

&quot;Ballance&quot; was met with positive reviews from critics upon release. An Adrenaline Vault review by Bob Mandel described the game&#x27;s graphics as &quot;heavenly&quot;, particularly admiring the &quot;exquisite detail&quot;. Mandel thought the sounds were &quot;absolutely outstanding&quot;, enjoyed the music and thought the gameplay was exciting and intense.

In the late 2010s, the game achieved renewed popularity among users of Bilibili. Concurrently, several studios in China published and marketed copies of the program under different names, including &quot;Ballance: The Return&quot;.

On January 5, 2024, the game was re-released on Steam and GOG, this time published by Ziggurat Interactive.

<doc id="1201469" wikidata="Q279200" url="?curid=1201469" title="Vittorio Jano">
<text>Vittorio Jano (; 22 April 1891 – 13 March 1965) was an Italian automobile designer of Hungarian descent from the 1920s through 1960s.

Jano was born &quot;Viktor János&quot; in San Giorgio Canavese, in Piedmont, to Hungarian immigrants, who arrived there several years earlier. He began at the car and truck company Società Torinese Automobili Rapid owned by G.B. Ceirano. In 1911 he moved to Fiat under Luigi Bazzi. 

== With Alfa Romeo ==
He moved with Bazzi to Alfa Romeo in 1923 to replace Giuseppe Merosi as chief engineer. At Alfa Romeo his first design was the 8-cylinder in-line mounted Alfa Romeo P2 Grand Prix car, which won Alfa Romeo the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. In 1932, he produced the sensational Alfa Romeo P3 model which later was raced with great success by Enzo Ferrari and his Scuderia Ferrari in 1933.

For Alfa road cars Jano developed a series of small-to-medium-displacement 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder inline power plants based on the P2 unit that established the classic architecture of Alfa engines, with light alloy construction, hemispherical combustion chambers, centrally located plugs, two rows of overhead valves per cylinder bank and dual overhead cams. In 1936 he designed the Alfa Romeo 12C using a V12 engine. The car was not successful and this is given as the reason for Vittorio Jano&#x27;s resignation from Alfa Romeo at the end of 1937.

== Lancia years ==

That same year, Jano moved to Lancia. Among his designs at Lancia was the Grand Prix effort. The car, the Lancia D50, was introduced in 1954, but 1955&#x27;s loss of Alberto Ascari and the 1955 Le Mans disaster soured the company on GP racing. Ferrari took over the effort and inherited Jano that same year.

== Ferrari period ==

Jano&#x27;s contribution to Ferrari was significant. Immediately he began work on a new V12 engine to replace the existing inline-4-engined sports cars. In 1956 his new &quot;Jano V12&quot; engine was introduced in the Ferrari 290 MM. The new series of the Jano-engined sports cars helped secure two World Sportscar Championship titles. With the encouragement of Enzo&#x27;s son, Alfredo, the Jano&#x27;s V6 engines pushed the bigger Lampredi and Colombo engines aside in some races. After Dino&#x27;s death, Jano&#x27;s &quot;Dino&quot; V6 became the basis for the company&#x27;s Formula Two and Tasman Series efforts. Later, with experience in both Ferrari and Dino mid-engine sports prototypes it laid the groundwork for their first mid-engined road car, the 1967 Dino 206 GT. The V6 and V8 went on to displace Ferrari&#x27;s V12 focus and their descendants continue to be used today.

== Personal life ==
Like Enzo Ferrari, Jano lost his own son in 1965. He became gravely ill that same year and committed suicide in Turin.

<text>George Harry Mullin (15 August 1891 – 5 April 1963) was an American-Canadian soldier in the Canadian army. Mullin was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Mullin was born in Portland, Oregon, and his parents brought him to Moosomin in the North-West Territories&#x27; District of Assiniboia at the age of two. He enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in December 1914.

==Action==
He was 26 years old, and a sergeant in Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 30 October 1917 at Passchendaele, Belgium, Sergeant Mullin single-handedly captured a pill-box which had withstood heavy bombardment and was causing heavy casualties and holding up the attack. He rushed the snipers&#x27; post in front, destroyed the garrison with bombs, shot two gunners and then compelled the remaining 10 men to surrender. All the time rapid fire was directed on him and his clothes were riddled with bullets, but he never faltered in his purpose and he not only helped to save the situation but indirectly saved many lives.

==Further Information==
Mullin had earlier received the Military Medal and finished the war as a lieutenant. In 1934 he was appointed as Sergeant at Arms of the Saskatchewan legislature. Mullin served as a captain in the Veterans Guard during the Second World War. He was also a father of 4 and a loving husband.

Mullin is commemorated with the two-block long residential street &#x27;Mullin Avenue&#x27; in the south central part of Regina, Saskatchewan.

<doc id="1201474" wikidata="Q5376965" url="?curid=1201474" title="Energy Policy Act of 1992">
<text>The Energy Policy Act of 1992, effective October 24, 1992, (102nd Congress H.R.776.ENR, abbreviated as EPACT92) is a United States government act. It was passed by Congress and set goals, created mandates, and amended utility laws to increase clean energy use and improve overall energy efficiency in the United States. The Act consists of twenty-seven titles detailing various measures designed to lessen the nation&#x27;s dependence on imported energy, provide incentives for clean and renewable energy, and promote energy conservation in buildings.

==Amendment of prior energy acts==
It reformed the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) to help small utility companies stay competitive with larger utilities and amended the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, broadening the range of resource choices for utility companies and outlined new rate-making standards. It also amended parts of the Federal Power Act of 1935 (Title VII).

==Titles==
The act addressed:
*Energy efficiency, energy conservation and energy management (Title I),
*Natural gas imports and exports (Title II),
*Alternative fuels and requiring certain fleets to acquire alternative fuel vehicles, which are capable of operating on nonpetroleum fuels (Title III-V), 
*Electric motor vehicles (Title VI),
*Radioactive waste (Title VIII), 
*Coal power and clean coal (Title XIII),
*Renewable energy (Title XII), and
*Other issues.

===Title I--Energy efficiency===
Title I established a comprehensive energy efficiency program that included incentives for energy conservation in buildings and created efficiency standards for appliances.

The EPAct directed the federal government to decrease energy consumption in federal buildings when feasible, and to integrate the use of alternative fuel vehicles in federal and state fleets. 
There are separate sections dedicated to coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy detailing clean energy incentives, research &amp; development strategies, conservation goals, and responsible management practices.

====Energy efficiency provisions====
*Buildings - Requires states to establish minimum commercial building energy codes and to consider minimum residential codes based on current voluntary codes. This gave impetus to the creation and modification of ASHRAE 90.1/1999, 2001, ASHRAE 90.2, the Model Energy Code etc.
*Utilities - Requires states to consider new regulatory standards that would require utilities to undertake integrated resource planning; allow the energy efficiency programs to be at least as profitable as new supply options; and encourage improvements in supply system efficiency.
*Equipment Standards - Establishes efficiency standards for: Commercial heating and air-conditioning equipment; electric motors; and lamps.
*Renewable Energy - Establishes a program for providing federal support on a competitive basis for renewable energy technologies
*Alternative Fuels
*Electric Vehicles
*Electricity - Removes obstacles to wholesale power competition in the Public Utilities Holding Company Act (PUHCA).

=== Title III--Alternative fuels ===
Title III of the 1992 Energy Policy Act addresses alternative fuels. It gave the U.S. Department of Energy administrative power to regulate the minimum number of light duty alternative fuel vehicles required in certain federal fleets beginning in fiscal year 1993. Title III includes:

*Federal Fleet Requirements.
*State and Alternative Fuel Provider Rule.
*Private and Local Government Fleet Rule.
*Alternative Fuel Designation Authority.

=== Title VI--Electric motor vehicles ===
The United States Department of Energy, which has EPACT92 implementation authority, ruled that diesel-electric or gasoline-electric hybrids are not &quot;alternative fuel vehicles.&quot;

===Title VIII--Radioactive waste===
Section 801 directed the United States Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate radiation protection standards for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which had been designated by the Federal government to serve as the permanent disposal site for used nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials from commercial nuclear power plants and U.S. Department of Defense activities.

===Title XII--Renewable energy===
Title XXII in the EPAct authorized tax incentives and marketing strategies for renewable energy technologies in an effort to encourage commercial sales and production.

===Title XX--Reduction of oil vulnerability===
Section 2026 known as Renewable Hydrogen Energy establishes a five year program in accordance with the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 for the distribution, production, storage, and utilization of hydrogen.

==Impact==
EPACT92 was far reaching in the impacting electric power deregulation, building codes and new energy efficient products.
The act was also responsible for the mandate of low flush toilets and outlawing the installation of toilets that flushed more than 1.6 gallons (6 liters) of water.

<doc id="1201486" wikidata="Q514197" url="?curid=1201486" title="Gene Hoglan">
<text>Eugene Victor Hoglan II (born August 31, 1967) is an American drummer, acclaimed for his creativity in drum arrangements, including use of abstract devices for percussion effects and his trademark lengthy double-kick drum rhythms. Though his playing style is very technically demanding, he retains high accuracy at extreme tempos, earning him the nicknames &quot;The Atomic Clock&quot; and &quot;Human Drum Machine&quot;.

Hoglan has played for numerous metal bands across his career. He first established himself as the drummer of Dark Angel in the 1980s, and began to expand his repertoire in the early 1990s after that band split up. Since then, he has played for Death, Strapping Young Lad and the solo projects of its frontman Devin Townsend, Fear Factory, Dethklok and Testament, amid two Dark Angel reunions and participation in several other side projects. He released his own album, the &quot;Gene Hoglan: The Atomic Clock&quot; DVD, and served as Testament&#x27;s longest-serving drummer.

Hoglan was featured on the cover of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine in November 2010. He also won &quot;Terrorizer&quot; magazine&#x27;s Reader&#x27;s Poll for Best Drummer 2010, and &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine nominated Hoglan for Best Metal Drummer, and Best Recorded Performance (for Dethklok&#x27;s &quot;Dethalbum II&quot;) on their 2011 ballot. He was nominated for Best Drummer in &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2010 Reader&#x27;s Poll.

==Early life and influences==

Hoglan got his first drum kit when he was 13 and is completely self-taught. He started jamming along to his Kiss and Rush records, with Peter Criss and Neil Peart being his early influences.
Later Cozy Powell, Tommy Aldridge, Robb Reiner of Anvil, Rob &quot;Wacko&quot; Hunter of Raven and Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor got him into double bass drumming. 

==Career==

In 1983, Hoglan began his music career as a roadie (lighting engineer) for the thrash metal band Slayer, where he also played the drums during concert soundchecks. He also did backing vocals on the song &quot;Evil Has No Boundaries&quot;, from the first Slayer album &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;. He contributed in the recording of &quot;Haunting the Chapel&quot;, holding Dave Lombardo&#x27;s drum kit together while recording &quot;Chemical Warfare&quot; because there was no carpet in the studio, said drum kit including a china cymbal owned by Hoglan. He became an influence in Lombardo&#x27;s drumming style and speed. Lombardo had just had the double bass added to his kit and it was the first double bass Hoglan ever played. Lombardo was impressed with Hoglan&#x27;s playing, and Hoglan gave Lombardo tips regarding the use of the double kick drum.

In 1984, Hoglan was part of the band &quot;War God&quot; with Michelle Meldrum. At the end of the same year he was asked to join the thrash metal band Dark Angel as the drummer. He penned most of the lyrics for Dark Angel&#x27;s next three albums. He achieved greater fame during the mid-1990s playing with Death, at the same time that bandleader Chuck Schuldiner was taking that group into a more progressive style. Subsequently, he recorded one album with the thrash metal band Testament, and made the acquaintance of Canadian multi-instrumentalist Devin Townsend, forging a lasting friendship. Around this time, coming off of the final tour he performed with Death, Hoglan was approached by Slayer to replace a departing Paul Bostaph. Jon Dette, however, took the position, much to Hoglan&#x27;s approval. He would go on to record several albums with Townsend, both as part of the speed/industrial/death metal band Strapping Young Lad and under Devin Townsend&#x27;s name.

Hoglan was also part of thrash metal band Tenet, a side project of Strapping Young Lad guitarist Jed Simon, from 2003 to 2007. Hoglan left the band on amicable terms in January 2007. He was replaced by Adrian Erlandsson only to return to the group in June of the same year. Hoglan recorded his drum parts for the entirety of the following album in a mere two days.

On the Vancouver stop of Opeth&#x27;s 2004 Lamentations tour, Hoglan stood in for drummer Martin Lopez, who was said to be having panic attacks. Opeth&#x27;s drum tech had filled in for the two previous dates on the tour and Lopez rejoined the band for the Seattle, Washington, show.

In 2005, Hoglan stood in for Lopez for the majority of the Sounds of the Underground tour when Lopez began having more panic attacks. Hoglan played double duty by playing a set with Strapping Young Lad then performing with Opeth later in the evening. It was later announced Lopez had a rare blood disorder and was seeking treatment. Hoglan also appeared in Opeth&#x27;s music video &quot;The Grand Conjuration&quot; as they filmed it on the tour while in Los Angeles, California.

Other bands have also recruited Hoglan as a session drummer. He has recorded albums with the Norwegian black metal band Old Man&#x27;s Child and the Danish death metal band Daemon. Additionally he has done production and engineering work for other albums and demos. Hoglan also was recruited by Vancouver thrash metal band The Almighty Punchdrunk, and appeared as a band member for their only album to date, &quot;Music for Them Asses&quot;, released in 2001.

Hoglan is working with Dethklok, the band from the animated TV show &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;. The show was co-created by stand-up comedian/actor/musician Brendon Small, who also composes or performs all of the music. Hoglan features in Dethklok&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Dethalbum&quot;, which was released on September 25, 2007. He toured with Brendon Small and the live band during the summer of 2008. Besides working with Dethklok, Hoglan is also a guest star by voicing a health inspector in one episode of the series. He later performed on &quot;Dethalbum II&quot;, the sequel album released on September 29, 2009, and again toured with Dethklok. The two later collaborated to make Brendon Small&#x27;s Galaktikon using extra studio time from the Dethklok studio sessions.

Hoglan filled in as the drummer for Unearth when their then drummer, Mike Justian, quit while on tour. He has also joined the metal band Pitch Black Forecast, with Mushroomhead singer Jason Popson, as the band&#x27;s permanent drummer. Even more recently, Hoglan was announced as the drummer for the reunited Bay Area Thrash metal band Forbidden&#x27;s reunion tour, replacing original drummer Paul Bostaph.

Hoglan played drums on Zimmers Hole&#x27;s third studio album &quot;When You Were Shouting at the Devil...We Were in League With Satan&quot; in 2008.
In June 2011, he reunited with Testament, to record their eleventh studio album &quot;Dark Roots of Earth&quot;. On that album, he filled in for Paul Bostaph, who was unable to participate in the recording sessions because of a &quot;serious injury&quot;. In 2012, he began touring with Testament, and on January 27 filled in for Charlie Benante of Anthrax. Although Hoglan was initially brought back to the band as a temporary drummer (in a fashion similar to his initial tenure when he recorded the &quot;Demonic&quot; album), he had since rejoined as a permanent member of Testament, recording two more albums with the band – &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot; (2016) and &quot;Titans of Creation&quot; (2020) – and surpassing original drummer Louie Clemente as their longest-serving drummer. In 2018, Hoglan played with both Anthrax and Testament on the same nights during the Slayer farewell tour while Charlie Benante was recovering from carpal tunnel syndrome. Hoglan announced his second departure from Testament on January 21, 2022.

Gene was the drummer for Fear Factory from 2009 to 2012 and played on their release &quot;Mechanize&quot;; his association with the band ended when he was &quot;no longer needed&quot;, and he expressed both a reluctance to join and a disappointment in the ultimate resolution of his tenure. He also participated in the recording sessions of Viking&#x27;s reunion album, &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; (2015).

Hoglan participated in the 2013 reunion of Dark Angel, who still play live occasionally to this day. The band announced in late March 2023 that it would continue on after the death of band member Jim Durkin and was planning to release a new album sometime in 2023 or 2024.

==Other ventures==
In 2017, Hoglan released an art collection consisting of long-exposure photography of him playing with colorful glowing drumsticks, resulting in psychedelic imagery.

Hoglan made a guest appearance in the season 2 finale of &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot; on Adult Swim.

<text>Kyŏn Sin-gŏm (; ? – September 936, r. 15 November 935 – 936) was the second and final king of Later Baekje, one of the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea. He came to the throne after conspiring with his two brothers, Yang-gŏm and Yong-gŏm, to overthrow their father Kyŏn Hwŏn and kill the anointed heir, their younger half-brother Kŭm-gang.

The brothers placed Kyŏn Hwŏn in prison, but he was able to escape. Kyŏn Hwŏn led the Goryeo army against them in 936 AD at present-day Seonsan in Gumi, destroying Kyŏn Sin-gŏm&#x27;s army.

King Taejo of Goryeo deemed that the plot was the work of Kyŏn Sin-gŏm&#x27;s brothers, and granted Kyŏn Sin-gŏm a noble title. Accounts vary as to whether Yang-gŏm and Yong-gŏm were sent into exile or slain.

<text>George Herbert Walker III (March 16, 1931 – January 18, 2020) was an American businessman, diplomat and philanthropist. Walker served as the United States Ambassador to Hungary from 2003 to 2006. He was a first cousin of President George H. W. Bush as well as first cousin once removed of President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.

==Early life==
Walker was born in St. Louis on March 16, 1931. His paternal grandfather, George Herbert Walker, was the founder of G. H. Walker &amp; Co., which is now part of the Merrill Lynch conglomerate; he also served as the President of W.A. Harriman Co. (1916-1929), which is now known as Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. Walker III was the son of Mary (Carter) and George Herbert Walker Jr., the cofounder of the New York Mets baseball team with Joan Whitney Payson. His first cousin, George Herbert Walker Bush, served as the President of the United States.

Walker graduated from Yale University in 1953, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He received a law degree from the Harvard Law School in 1955. He served in the U. S. Air Force for two years as staff judge advocate at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

==Career==
Walker then returned to St. Louis and worked first with his grandfather&#x27;s company, G. H. Walker &amp; company, then with Stifel Nicolaus in 1977. During his term as CEO, Stifel Nicolaus became a publicly traded firm on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1992, Walker was a candidate for the U.S. House seat representing Missouri&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District, but was defeated by then-State Rep. Jim Talent in the Republican primary by a margin of 58% to 32%.

Walker served as the United States Ambassador to Hungary under his cousin from 2003 to 2006.

In 2007, Walker became the general partner at the Danube Fund.

==Philanthropy==
Walker served on the Board of Directors of Webster University from 1974 on. Following a significant donation to Webster University in 2005, the business school was renamed the George Herbert Walker School of Business and Technology.

In 2016 Ambassador Walker and his wife Dr. Carol Walker made the founding gift to launch The Walker Leadership Institute at Eden Theological Seminary. The Institute focuses on Common Good leadership at the intersection of business and faith. The founding director of the Walker Leadership Institute, the Rev Steve Lawler, previously served as rector of St. Stephen&#x27;s &amp; The Vine Episcopal Church in Ferguson, Missouri and as a member of faculty and a program coordinator for University College of Washington University in St. Louis. 

==Personal life==
Walker was married to the former Carol Banta and they had eight children between them and fifteen grandchildren. His son, George Herbert Walker IV, is the Chief Executive Officer of investment management firm Neuberger Berman. Walker died on January 19, 2020, aged 88.

<text>Illinois Route 72 is an east–west state highway in northern Illinois. It runs from the intersection with Illinois Route 73 north of Lanark east to Illinois Route 43 (Harlem Avenue) in Chicago. This is a distance of .

== Route description ==

Illinois 72 is called Higgins Road for most of its length in the Chicago area, and has been redirected in parts of the area to accommodate for new features. Near Rosemont, the road has been shifted to make way for O&#x27;Hare International Airport — further east, parts of the road have been moved to make room for the Northwest Tollway (Interstate 90). The road serves as a major six-lane thoroughfare for several western suburbs, including Schaumburg, Elk Grove Village, and Hoffman Estates.

Illinois 72 runs concurrently for one block with Illinois Route 83 in Elk Grove Township, and Illinois Route 47 and U.S. Highway 20 by Starks, an unincorporated village approximately from Chicago. The latter is a Wrong-way concurrency, where one can be driving both west on Illinois 72 and east on U.S. 20 at the same time. West from Chicago, Illinois 72 largely parallels Interstate 90 until Starks, crossing over and under the highway six times without an intersection. On a larger scale, it is the main east–west artery to Chicago between Interstate 90 and Illinois Route 64.

It serves the towns and cities of, from west to east, Lanark, Shannon, Forreston, Leaf River, Byron, Stillman Valley, Kirkland, Kingston, Genoa, Hampshire, Gilberts, Sleepy Hollow, West Dundee, East Dundee, South Barrington, Hoffman Estates, Schaumburg, Elk Grove Village, Des Plaines, Rosemont, and Chicago. Higgins Road/Higgins Avenue continues east-southeast from Harlem Avenue in Chicago to Milwaukee Avenue near Lawrence Avenue.

Route 72 is one of seven state roads to enter the city of Chicago. It was once part of the Galena-Chicago Stagecoach Trail.

== History ==
SBI Route 72 originally ran from Lanark to Starks. It was extended east in 1937 and 1938 to East Dundee, and then to Chicago. In 1968, the designation of IL 72 was truncated back to IL 43 (Harlem Avenue), lopping off . In 1982, it was shortened again, this time to Illinois Route 73.

The crash site of American Airlines Flight 191 is located along the road as Touhy Avenue, just north of the road and north of O&#x27;Hare International Airport near a trailer park.

<doc id="1201510" wikidata="Q7711685" url="?curid=1201510" title="The $1.98 Beauty Show">
<text>The $1.98 Beauty Show is an American game show that aired in syndication from September 1978 to September 1980.

Hosted by Rip Taylor, the series is a parody of beauty contests, and featured six female contestants (including the occasional overweight ones), as well as celebrities Sandra Bernhard, Rhonda Shear, and actress Teresa Ganzel, and on at least one occasion a male dressed in drag) competing for the title of &quot;$1.98 Beauty Queen&quot;.

Chuck Barris created the series and was executive producer. Johnny Jacobs was the announcer.

==Format==
Although &quot;The $1.98 Beauty Show&quot; was staged and played broadly, the format was really a subtle satire where the traditional roles were reversed. The comedian did the announcing, and the announcer told the jokes. The celebrity judges, introduced with great ceremony, contributed nothing during the proceedings and did not speak, even when it came time to announce the winner. The judge seated nearest Rip Taylor would silently hand Taylor an envelope containing the (prearranged) winner&#x27;s name.

The show consisted of three rounds, during which each contestant was judged by three celebrity panelists. These included Jaye P. Morgan, Jamie Farr, Steve Garvey, Rosey Grier, Patty Andrews, Louis Nye, Peter Lawford, Dorothy Lamour, Marty Allen, Trini Lopez, and the Unknown Comic (all of whom had also served as panelists on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;). Emcee Taylor introduced the contestants one at a time.

Round 2 featured each contestant showcasing their &quot;abilities&quot;. Round 3 was a swimsuit competition, in which Taylor ushered the contestants on stage and announcer Jacobs cracked jokes about their vital statistics and hobbies.

At the end of each show, Taylor announced the &quot;$1.98 Beauty of The Week&quot;. That contestant was presented with a tacky plastic crown, a bouquet of rotten vegetables, and the titular cash prize of $1.98, which Taylor dispensed from a coin holder on his belt.

The outcome was previously arranged, as was noted in the introductory monologue by the announcer and the fine print of the closing credits of each episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;1.98 Beauty Show w/host Rip Taylor Part 3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Rip Taylor reported that the show was doing well in syndication, but was abruptly canceled by Chuck Barris. &quot;Chuck was at a party one night,&quot; recalled Taylor, &quot;and someone said, &#x27;Gee, he has a lot of trash on the air.&#x27; He had 17 hours a week of trash, and he got mad and said, &#x27;I&#x27;ll take it all off the air.&#x27; [&quot;The $1.98 Beauty Show&quot;] was number three in the country before he took it off the air.&quot;

==Music==
Music cues used on this show include &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s theme song), &quot;Oh You Beautiful Doll&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot;. In addition, Taylor serenades the winning contestant as a parody of Bert Parks having done the same on the &quot;Miss America Pageant&quot;.

The show&#x27;s bandleader, Milton DeLugg, used all the same musicians from the band heard on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, plus two additional saxophone players for the first season only.

<text>Clay Morgan Shepherd (born October 12, 1941) is an American former professional stock car racing driver and current team owner. He last competed part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 89 Chevrolet Camaro for Shepherd Racing Ventures. He is a born again Christian who serves as a lay minister to the racing community. He competed in NASCAR for over 50 years, having one of the longest careers in the sport.

Shepherd became the second-oldest race winner (after Harry Gant) in 1993, when he won the spring race at Atlanta at the age of 51 years, 4 months, and 27 days. He holds the record for oldest driver to start a race in NASCAR&#x27;s top three series at age 77, as well as oldest starter in the NASCAR Cup Series race at the 2014 Camping World RV Sales 301 at age 72.

==Racing career==

===Career before NASCAR===
Shepherd&#x27;s racing career began in 1967 when he started racing Late models at Hickory Motor Speedway nearby his home. Shepherd proved to be fast but he crashed out quite often in his early days. In 1968, Shepherd started racing full-time at a Hobby division in Hickory, driving a 1955 Chevy. That year Shepherd won 21 out of 29 races. The next year Shepherd drove the same car this time with a 1957 Chevy body on the car. After winning seven races early in the year he wrecked, which almost destroyed his car. Shepherd did not win another race that year after putting a 1966 Chevy body on the car. Shepherd later sold this car to Harry Gant.

Shepherd&#x27;s career was on its way in 1970. He built his own cars and raced at several different racetracks in the Southeast. Personal problems during the seventies slowed down Shepherd&#x27;s career. In a religious experience, Shepherd accepted Christ as his personal savior. He was looking to get control of his life, and his career got back on track in 1975. Shepherd took every racing opportunity he was offered and drove for 17 different car owners during 1975. He finished second in the NASCAR Sportsman national championship to L. D. Ottinger. At last, Shepherd got his big break in 1978 after he met Cliff Stewart, who owned a western North Carolina furniture factory. With Stewart as his owner, Shepherd won the 1980 NASCAR Sportsman Series (now known as the Xfinity Series). During this year, Shepherd won 9 races and finished second 21 times. The Shepherd-Stewart combo moved to what was then the Winston Cup Series for the 1981 season.

===Winston Cup Series===

====Early days====
Shepherd made his Winston Cup Series debut in 1970 at Hickory Motor Speedway, driving the No. 93 Chevy for Bill Flowers. He started tenth but finished nineteenth out of twenty-two cars due to rear-end failure. Shepherd made two more starts for Flowers that year but failed to finish in both of them. His best finish that year was a fourteenth place at Hickory.

Shepherd would not return to the Cup Series until 1977, driving a Mercury for Jim Makar. He first attempted the Daytona 500 that year but he failed to make the race. Later that year Shepherd took his first top-ten finish at Dover International Speedway. He also ran two additional races at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway. Shepherd stayed with Makar for the 1978 season, qualifying for his first Daytona 500. Shepherd started the race in 37th place but only finished 40th when his engine failed after only eight laps. He only ran one additional race that season, finishing twelfth at Charlotte. Shepherd only attempted the Daytona 500 with Makar in 1979, but failed to make the race.

====Full-time Cup Series switch====
Shepherd moved to the Winston Cup Series full-time in 1981, driving the No. 5 Pontiac for Cliff Stewart. They missed the first two races of the season, Riverside and the Daytona 500. Shepherd took pole position in his first race for Stewart at Richmond, finishing the race in fourth position. A few races later Shepherd won his first Winston Cup race at Martinsville. The win marked the first win for Pontiac in 18 years. Shepherd dominated the race and led a total of 203 laps. Shepherd left Stewart&#x27;s team after the Talladega 500 after he had a falling out with his team. For the next race at Michigan Shepherd drove for Bud Reeder his team. Shepherd qualified in the fourteenth position but retired from the race after he crashed on lap twenty. For the next couple of races Shepherd drove for Cecil Gordon and his team, finishing in the top ten at North Wilkesboro and Charlotte. During the last part of the season, Shepherd also drove some races for Ron Benfield. Shepherd finished thirteenth in points with ten top-ten finishes.
Shepherd moved to Benfield&#x27;s team full-time in 1982, driving the No. 98 Buick. Although Shepherd did not win a race that season, he scored six top-five finishes with a best finish of third at Bristol early in the season. Shepherd also won the pole at Nashville and Atlanta, respectively, but retired from both those races with engine troubles. Shepherd finished tenth in points that season with a total of thirteen top-ten finishes.

Shepherd started the 1983 season without a full-time ride. He tried to qualify for the Daytona 500 driving for Bud Reeder; however, he failed to make the race. Shepherd then drove the Richmond 400 for Wayne Beahr but did not finish the race. Shepherd returned to Cecil Gordon for the TranSouth 500 and later drove the Virginia National Bank 500 for Emanuel Zervakis. After that race, Shepherd drove for Jim Stacy&#x27;s team for the rest of the season. Shepherd scored thirteen top-ten finishes during the rest of the season, with a best finish of second at Firecracker 400. His abbreviated season dropped Shepherd to twentieth in the final points standings.

====Going from ride to ride====
For the next couple of years, Shepherd did not have a full-time ride and practically picked up whatever he could find. Shepherd started off his 1984 season at Richmond driving the No. 2 Buick for Robert Harrington. Shepherd drove two races for Charlie Henderson early in the season. He also drove four races for Dick Bahre his team, with a best finish of seventeenth at the 1984 World 600. Shepherd made one start for Phil Barkdoll at Michigan finishing the race in the 22nd position. After driving the No. 6 Buick for D. K. Ulrich and the No. 52 Chevy for Jimmy Means, Shepherd drove six races for Roger Hamby. Shepherd had two top twenty finished for Hamby, with a best finish of twelfth at Richmond. Shepherd made another start for Ulrich at Charlotte, before rounding off the season driving the No. 98 Chevy for Ron Benfield. Shepherd scored his only top ten finish that season at Rockingham, finishing in sixth position.

Shepherd finished his first Daytona 500 in 1985, driving the No. 67 Chrysler for Buddy Arrington. Shepherd spent the rest of the season going from ride to ride. He returned to the team of Dick Bahre, driving the No. 23 Chevy at Rockingham. He also made a start for Petty Enterprises at the TranSouth 500. Shepherd fielded his own car at Talladega, finishing the race in thirteenth place. Shepherd made four races for Bobby Hawkins, with a best finish of fifth at Atlanta. He made most of his starts that season for Helen Rae Smith, but failed to finish all of those seven races.

Shepherd moved to the team of Jack Beebe in 1986, driving on a part-time basis. He had a good start to the season, finishing fourth at the 1986 Goodwrench 500. At the next race in Atlanta, Shepherd led 97 laps and held off Dale Earnhardt to win his second career Winston Cup race. Shepherd got very emotional at the final laps of the race. &quot;I was trying not to cry. I knew I had to keep my self-control because we were so close to finally winning a big one, a major race. My racing career was nearly gone just a year before, and I was getting ready to win a big one.&quot; Shepherd made ten more starts for Beebe that season, scoring four top-ten finishes. After making several starts for RahMoc Enterprises mid-season, he moved to the team full-time after the Southern 500. Shepherd scored two additional top-ten finishes for RahMoc Enterprises and finished the season eighteenth in points.

====Late 1980s and early 1990s====
Shepherd joined King Racing for the 1987 season, driving the No. 26 Quaker State Buick Lesabre owned by drag racing legend Kenny Bernstein. It was the first time in Shepherd&#x27;s Cup career that he competed in every scheduled event. Shepherd scored eleven top-ten finishes; seven of those were in the top five. He also scored his fourth career pole st Martinsville. He led the early part of that race but retired after engine problems. His best finish of the season was at the Coca-Cola 600, where Shepherd finished second to Kyle Petty.

Shepherd switched to Tom Winkle&#x27;s team for the 1988 season. Shepherd had a good start to the season, with a pole at Richmond and a top-ten at Rockingham. However, after that race Shepherd started racing for his own team, driving a Buick. After failing to finish a race with his own team he moved to Mach 1 Racing, replacing the injured Harry Gant. Shepherd led 110 laps at Dover, eventually finishing second to Bill Elliott. After Gant returned Shepherd again replaced an injured driver, this time Neil Bonnett at RahMoc Enterprises. In his first race for this team, at Pocono, Shepherd took his second pole of the year. After posting two top-tens in the No. 88 Oldsmobile for Buddy Baker, Shepherd finished out the year in his own No. 57, before his team was purchased by RahMoc for the season finale.

He returned to RahMoc for the 1989 season. Shepherd scored thirteen top-ten finishes during the season. He led the most laps at the Talladega DieHard 500 but eventually finished the race in sixth place. Shepherd took his final career pole at Watkins Glen. He led the early parts of that race but lost his chance of winning the race after contact with Geoff Bodine. Shepherd&#x27;s best finish of the season was two second-place finishes at the Pepsi 400 and the Champion Spark Plug 400. It was only the second time in his career Shepherd competed in every scheduled event. He finished thirteenth in the final points standings.

Shepherd moved to Bud Moore Engineering for the 1990 season, driving the No. 15 Ford. He had a great start to the season finishing in the top ten in each of the first eleven races. Shepherd took the championship lead for the first (and only) time in his career after the Budweiser 500. He had a difficult midseason, losing the points lead and dropping to tenth in the standings after the Tyson Holly Farms 400. Shepherd ended his season on a high after winning his third career race at the season finale at Atlanta. He finished fifth in the final points standings, which would turn out to be a career-high.

He stayed with Bud Moore for the 1991 season, but had a more up and down season than the year before. Although Shepherd scored fourteen top-ten finishes he could not compete for regular top-five finishes during the season. His best finish of the season was two third-place finishes late in the season. He had his best run of the season at North Wilkesboro, where Shepherd led a total of 41 laps and just missed out on the win. Shepherd dropped to twelfth in the final points standings. After the season Shepherd left Bud Moore Engineering and moved to the Wood Brothers for the 1992 season.

====Wood Brothers Racing====
Shepherd joined Wood Brothers Racing in 1992, driving the No. 21 Citgo Ford. He came short of winning the Daytona 500, finishing second to Davey Allison. Even though Shepherd scored eleven top-ten finishes during the season he dropped to fourteenth in the final points standings. Shepherd had a good run at Dover early in the season, where he led 52 laps, but he dropped back at the end of the race.

Shepherd improved to seventh in points in 1993. Shepherd scored a total of fifteen top-ten finishes during the season. He became the second-oldest race winner when he won the spring race at Atlanta at the age of 51 years, 4 months, and 27 days. Shepherd took the race lead with 12 laps to go and cruised across the finish line. It turned out to be Shepherd&#x27;s final Winston Cup Series win. The Wood Brothers would not return to Victory Lane until Elliott Sadler won the Food City 500 in 2001.

Shepherd continued his good run for the Wood Brothers in 1994. He equaled his career-best top-tens in one season with sixteen, nine of those were top-five finishes. Shepherd came close to winning his fourth race at Atlanta, but just came short and finished second to Ernie Irvan. Shepherd also came close to winning the Mello Yello 500 at the end of the season but was passed by Dale Jarrett during the last four laps of the race. Shepherd finished sixth in the final points standings with a career-best 4029 points in a season.

Shepherd stayed with the Wood Brothers for the 1995 season. He had a decent season but dropped to eleventh in the points standings. Shepherd scored ten top-ten finishes during the season. He had his best run at Loudon, where Shepherd finished second to Jeff Gordon. After the 1995 season, Shepherd was replaced by Michael Waltrip, as Citgo wanted a younger driver. At that time Shepherd was 53 years old.

====Late 1990s and career decline====

Shepherd signed for Butch Mock Motorsports to drive for them in the 1996 season, driving their No. 75 Ford with sponsorship from Remington Arms. Shepherd scored five top-tens during the season, with a best finish of fifth at the Brickyard 400. He also had a good run going at the Miller 400, where Shepherd led 44 laps in the early part of the race. Shepherd finished nineteenth in the final points standings. Despite a solid season, Shepherd decided to leave the No. 75 team at the end of the season. 1996 would also turn out to be Shepherd&#x27;s last season where he competed in every scheduled event.

Shepherd moved to Precision Products Racing for the 1997 season, driving the No. 1 Pontiac. Shepherd finished tenth at the Goodwrench Service 400, scoring his first top-ten of the year. He had his best run of the season in Atlanta. Shepherd looked strong all race and was a contender for the win, but eventually he finished the race in third place. This was Shepherd&#x27;s last top-five finish in Winston Cup competition. Shepherd finished ninth at the Coca-Cola 600. This would turn out to be Shepherd&#x27;s last top ten finish in Cup racing. After the Pocono 500, Shepherd left Precision Products Racing and switched to Jasper Motorsports, driving their No. 77 Ford. Shepherd struggled at Jasper Motorsports and only managed to qualify for five of the eleven races he entered with the team. After failing to qualify for the Exide NASCAR Select Batteries 400, he departed and rejoined PPR, now with R+L Carriers sponsorship. His best finish for the rest of the season was a twelfth place at Talladega Superspeedway.

After beginning 1998 without a ride, Shepherd brought out his own team to attempt the races at Rockingham, Atlanta and Darlington, but his No. 05 Pontiac failed to qualify in all three races. In the following race at Bristol, Shepherd drove the No. 46 First Union Chevy for Team SABCO, finishing 24th, before substituting for Mike Skinner for two races, finishing eleventh at Martinsville. Shepherd also had a good run at Talladega, where he qualified in fifth place. After another race for SABCO and a one-off deal for Stavola Brothers Racing at Michigan International Speedway, where he finished 43rd, Shepherd spent most of the season with LJ Racing, his best finish 15th at the Brickyard 400. He left the team late in the season and closed the year in the No. 8 Chevy for the Stavola Brothers. Shepherd had a good run and was running in the top ten, until he made contact with Jeff Gordon and wrecked, finishing 39th.

Shepherd attempted the 1999 Daytona 500 for Pinnacle Motorsports, but he failed to make the race. He made his only Cup start that season the following week at North Carolina in the No. 90 Ford Taurus for Donlavey Racing, where he started 39th and finished 32nd, five laps down. In May 1999, Shepherd announced he was partnering with Rhea Fain to field the No. 05 Wendy&#x27;s Pontiac. After the team failed to qualify for the Coca-Cola 600, the partnership dissolved, and Shepherd failed in each of his attempts to qualify for a Cup race that season.

Shepherd only attempted one race in 2000, driving the No. 80 Ford for Hover Motorsports in the season finale at Atlanta. He failed to make the race as Shepherd set the 49th-fastest time in qualifying. Shepherd returned to Hover Motorsports for the 2001 Daytona 500, but failed to qualify. Shepherd also attempted the season finale at Loudon driving for his own team, but he failed to make the race.

====Cup return with his own team====
Shepherd started racing for his own team on a part-time basis in 2002, driving the No. 89 Ford. He attempted his first race at Loudon, qualifying in 43rd position. Shepherd finished the race in 40th position. As his team practically received no sponsorship money, Shepherd was unable to compete for full races and he often had to park early to save money and resources. At the next race in Pocono, Shepherd qualified 43rd and finished 42nd, after leading during a rain delay. He made six more attempts in the No. 89 and qualified for three of them, with his best finish of 40th at Kansas. Shepherd also made two additional starts for Ware Racing Enterprises, but he failed to make the race at Dover and Talladega.

Shepherd had to cut back on his Cup schedule in 2003 and only attempted seven races that year. He started his season at the Pocono 500, but was the slowest car in qualifying and did not make the race. Shepherd did make the race at the New England 300 where he parked after 43 laps and finished in last position. He qualified in 42nd-place at the next race in Pocono, but only run for 44 laps and finished in 43rd. Shepherd attempted four additional races that season but failed to make any of those races.
For the 2004 season Shepherd Racing Ventures switched to Dodge. The team increased their schedule, attempting 32 of the 36 races. Shepherd had a good start to the season, qualifying for the first race he attempted at Las Vegas. The No. 89 team did not have sufficient sponsorship money to complete the races, so Shepherd sometimes had to park his car early to save money. Shepherd had his best run at the spring race of Martinsville, finishing in 32nd position. Shepherd last finished a Cup race in 1999. Shepherd also ran the full race at the summer Daytona race, finishing in 33rd place. Shepherd qualified for 19 races that year. Shepherd started his 500th Cup start at the Siemens 300 at the New Hampshire International Speedway. He qualified in 41st position and finished in 40th place after running 192 of the 300 laps. He finished 42nd in the final points standings.

As Shepherd and his team received almost no money from sponsors whatsoever, they had to cut back on their 2005 schedule. Shepherd attempted to qualify for the 2005 Daytona 500 but missed the race after he was caught up in a wreck during the Gatorade Duels. This was a big blow to Shepherd&#x27;s season as he needed the prize money to compete in all the races. Shepherd qualified for the next race he entered at Las Vegas. This was a much-needed break as his team needed the prize money to keep racing. Shepherd eventually managed to qualify for four of the 21 races he entered that season. He finished 63rd in the 2005 points standings.

Shepherd&#x27;s struggles continued in 2006. His team had to cut on their schedule and only entered 15 races that year. Shepherd failed to qualify for the first 9 races he entered in 2006. He made his first race of the year at the Chevy Rock &amp; Roll 400, where he finished 43rd. The following week, he qualified for the Sylvania 300 and finished 42nd. Shepherd failed to make any additional races for the rest of the year. He finished 66th in the final points standings. Shepherd shut down his cup team after the season and moved to the Busch Series for 2007.

====Oldest driver to start Sprint Cup race====

Shepherd ran the Camping World RV Sales 301 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway for Brian Keselowski Motorsports, his first Sprint Cup race since 2006, becoming the oldest driver to race in the Sprint Cup at an age of 71 years, nine months and two days, and breaking the previous record held by Jim Fitzgerald, who ran at Riverside International Raceway in 1987 at age 65. Shepherd started 41st and finished in the same spot in a start-and-park effort, completing 92 of 301 laps.

Shepherd attempted to make the 2014 Daytona 500 in the No. 93 for BK Racing in collaboration with MacDonald Motorsports, but failed to qualify. Had he made the race, he would have been the oldest driver in Daytona 500 history. At the following race at Phoenix, Shepherd drove Joe Nemechek&#x27;s No. 87 Toyota, extending his record as the oldest driver to compete in a Cup Series race.

Shepherd also ran the 2014 Camping World RV Sales 301 for Circle Sport Racing. He was the subject of a Joey Logano complaint when the 24-year old Logano was involved in an accident with Shepherd. Logano argued, &quot;I feel like there should be a driving test before you get out in a Cup car to make sure you know how to drive before you drive one ... If you&#x27;re 10 laps down, what are you even doing?&quot; NASCAR defended Shepherd, saying his speed was monitored and he ran at a reasonable pace. Logano was credited with a 40th-place finish while Shepherd, who was the last car running, albeit 27 laps behind the leaders, finished 39th. Shepherd had last finished a Cup race at the 2004 Pepsi 400.

===Xfinity Series===

====Driving for Ed Whitaker and Lindy White====

Shepherd made his Busch Series debut at Hickory Motor Speedway in 1982, the series&#x27; inaugural season. That year, he drove twelve races for Ed Whitaker. At Hickory, Shepherd won his first race in only his second start in the series. Later that season, he won at Indianapolis Raceway Park. Shepherd scored a total of eight top-five finishes that season, also earning the pole position twice. Despite only starting twelve of the twenty-nine races in the schedule, Shepherd finished eleventh in the final points standings for that year.

In 1983 Shepherd drove 18 races for Whitaker, winning at Bristol and Richmond International Raceway, but dropping to eighteenth in the final standings. Additionally, Shepherd started from the pole at Charlotte. For 1984 Shepherd moved to Lindy White Racing. Shepherd finished in the top-ten six times that season, winning a total of three races at Bristol, Indianapolis Raceway Park, and Martinsville. He stayed with Lindy White for 1985 but had a difficult season. Due to mechanical problems Shepherd only finished three of the eleven races he started that season.

Shepherd had his best Busch series season in 1986, winning four races, all of them for Whitaker. He won at Martinsville, Bristol, Dover and Rockingham. Shepherd also made his first start for his own team at Martinsville, but retired at lap 133 due to steering problems.

====Driving for his own team====
Shepherd continued to enter his own car for the 1987 season, driving the No. 97 Buick. He started the year with a fifth-place finish at Daytona. A few races later at Bristol, Shepherd won his first race of the season. At Oxford he drove the No. 68 Pontiac for Dale Shaw. Shepherd dominated the early part of the race but retired from the race on 101 after an axle broke on the car. At Road Atlanta Shepherd scored his second win of the season. It was the only time in his career that he won on a road course. At Darlington Shepherd led 42 laps but finished second to Harry Gant. Shepherd won final race of the season at Rockingham after a photo finish with Geoff Bodine.
Shepherd struggled in the 1988 season as his team was afflicted by mechanical issues and crashes throughout the year; An engine failure at Daytona after Shepherd led the early laps, retiring from the lead at Darlington after transmission problems, a crash at Nazareth after leading 31 laps and another engine failure at Dover after Shepherd had led the early part of that race. The highlight of the season was a lone win at Indianapolis Raceway Park after Shepherd took the lead with 7 laps to go. It was the final Busch win of Shepherd&#x27;s career.

Shepherd cut back on his Busch schedule in 1989, only running two races in his No. 97. He also made two starts for David Pearson, winning the pole at Bristol. Shepherd dominated the early part of that race but retired halfway through the race after having handling issues. In 1990 Shepherd made three starts in his No. 97 Ford with a best finish of third at Rockingham. He also made nine starts for Mike Swaim finishing fourth at Nazareth and Loudon. For 1991 Shepherd increased his schedule to sixteen races with sponsorship from Texas Pete Sauces. His season, however, was plagued by mechanical problems and Shepherd only finished four races, with a best of fifth at Richmond.

After he ran three races in his No. 97 Ford in 1992, Shepherd renumbered his car to match the No. 21 he drove for the Wood Brothers in the Cup series. Shepherd had a good run going at Loudon but retired after 203 laps. His best finish of the season was a third-place at Charlotte. Shepherd continued to race his No. 21 Ford till the 1995 season. He struggled to get results and could only score three top-ten finishes in sixteen races.

====Substitute driver====
Shepherd made two starts for Bobby Jones Racing in the 1996 season, but he failed to finish any of those races. Shepherd returned to Jones for two races in 1997 with a best finish of sixteenth at Bristol. Shepherd also entered his own car for two races but only managed to qualify for the race at Michigan. In 1998 Shepherd made one start for Mac Martin at Fort Worth. Shepherd also entered his own car for two races but failed to qualify for both of those races.

For 1999 partnered with Bruce Hanusosky to form High Tech Performance. The team planned to run at least fifteen races but after Shepherd failed to qualify for the first two attempts the partnership dissolved. Later that season Shepherd made two attempts for Ed Whitaker but he failed to qualify for those races as well. Shepherd joined Xpress Motorsports for the race at Rockingham and qualified in the eleventh position. In the race, Shepherd scored his most recent top-ten finish with a 10th-place finish. For the next two seasons, Shepherd attempted occasional races with different owners but he failed to make any of those races.

Shepherd joined Davis Motorsports for the 2003 season, driving their No. 0 and No. 70 Chevy. Shepherd qualified for 10 of 12 races he entered with the team. His best finish was an 11th-place finish at Talladega. Later in the season, Shepherd partnered with Dayne Miller. Shepherd only qualified for 4 of the 10 races he entered with Miller. In 2004 Shepherd made 9 attempts with a bunch of different teams. Shepherd only qualified for two races and he failed to finish any of those. In 2006 Shepherd returned to Davis Motorsports and made five starts in a start and park effort.

====Forming his own team====
After several years of competing part-time for several teams, Shepherd began fielding his No. 89 in 2007. Shepherd would start and park the majority of the schedule but did qualify for 16 of the 20 races he attempted in his self owned Dodge. He also ran 5 races for JD Motorsports. For 2008, Shepherd announced intentions to run the full Nationwide Series schedule for the first time in his career. While he would miss the opening race at Daytona, Shepherd would rebound, making the next 7 races before missing the race at Mexico City. The following week at Talladega, Shepherd would finish 13th, his best finish in the series since 2003. It would also elevate the 89 team to the top 30 in points, locking them into the races. Unfortunately, 2007 would end on a sour note, with Shepherd and team missing 4 of the final 5 races of the season. 2009 would see a big change come to the team, with Shepherd leaving Dodge, who he had been with primarily since 2004, and joining Chevrolet. At Daytona, Shepherd would secure a starting spot in the race, his first Daytona February start in the series since 1994. The first half of 2009 would see Shepherd only miss races, and score a best finish of 13th at Las Vegas. The second half of the season would once again prove difficult, missing 11 races. 2010 would start with mixed results, a strong showing at Daytona was followed by two straight DNQs. Shepherd and his team would receive a big break. Following the release of John Wes Townley from Richard Childress Racing, Zaxby&#x27;s, which is owned by Townley&#x27;s father, cut back sponsorship of the 21 team. Childress would make a deal with Shepherd and his team, Faith Motorsports. The alliance would run as Shepherd Racing Ventures and would allow Shepherd to drive the 21 car to keep it up in owner points, as well as run full-time with limited sponsorship from Zaxby&#x27;s. The 89 Faith Motorsports Chevy would run as a start and park effort when Shepherd was behind the 21.

For 2011, the 89 would return full-time under the Shepherd Racing Ventures moniker, with the RCR/SVR 21 becoming the 89. This would guarantee the 89 into the first 5 races of the season. 2011 would be one of his strongest seasons, running all 33 races, as well as having sponsorship for the majority of the season. However, Shepherd and team&#x27;s success would turn sour late in the season, as mechanical failures and accidents would plague Shepherd. During the 2011 Wypall 200 at Phoenix, Shepherd was en route to his best finish of the season. However, he was caught up in a late incident.

The 2012 season turned out to be a real struggle for Shepherd. The team lacked owner points and Shepherd had to qualify on time for the races. Because of that, they missed ten races. The team also lacked sponsorship and in most races the team only had one set of tires and could only run the race for as long as that set of tires lasted. Shepherd only finished 2 races that season. He did become the oldest driver to lead a Nationwide Series race when he led 3 laps at Richmond. Shepherd dropped to 29th in the final point standings.

Shepherd&#x27;s struggles continued in 2013. Before the start of the season NASCAR cut the Nationwide field to 40 cars. This was a big blow to Shepherd and his team as it was now even harder to qualify for the races. After failing to qualify for the first two races he attempted that season, Shepherd announced that the lack of sponsorship forced him to scale back on his schedule. He stated that he did not know if or when he would be attending another race event in 2013 due to non-funding. Shepherd returned at Richmond, but again failed to make the race. Shepherd did qualify for the next race at Talladega, but retired on lap 72 because of a fuel pressure problem. He would qualify for seven additional races that season, finishing only once at the fall race at Dover.

Shepherd became the oldest driver to lead a Nationwide Series race at the age of 70 when he led 3 laps in the 2012 Virginia 529 College Savings 250 at Richmond International Raceway. Shepherd extended this record when he led one lap in the 2016 Sparks Energy 300 at Talladega Superspeedway. Shepherd was 74 during this race, he again extended the record when he led during the 2016 Subway Firecracker 250 at Daytona. The record was extended once more during the 2017 VFW Sport Clips Help a Hero 200 at the Darlington Raceway at age 75.

==Personal life==
According to Shepherd, he had a spiritual awakening on February 23, 1975. After years of extramarital affairs and excessive drinking, he was returning from Speedweeks when he discovered that his third wife had left him. Following a week of partying, Shepherd awoke that Sunday and vowed to change his life for the better, explaining in a 2005 interview, &quot;When I got done praying, I&#x27;m not kidding you, I felt like I could jump straight through the roof. It was like a load was taken off of me and life has not been the same since.&quot;

Shepherd has been married to his sixth wife, Cindy since 1994. He has six children and ten grandchildren. When not at the race track, Shepherd is involved in several religious causes, and also hosts a charity event for disabled Americans during the offseason.

In 2008, one of his sons, Clay Morgan Shepherd Jr., was arrested and charged for indecent behavior toward children and showing child pornography to young children. According to the prosecution, Clay had sexually exposed himself to four girls between the ages of seven and 11, along with fondling an eight-year-old girl. Two of the victims were related to Clay. He would take a plea deal, serving six months in jail and having to be labeled a sex offender for the next 10 years. In response, Morgan would say that the punishment was deserved and that he advocated for more prison time for Clay, saying that &quot;He needs to face God&#x27;s vengeance and justice, too. I feel like some justice has been done here, but I feel like he should have been given more jail time.&quot;

In November 2020, Shepherd revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>George Herbert Walker IV (born April 1969) is an American investment manager. He is the chairman and CEO of Neuberger Berman, one of the largest independent, employee-owned investment management firms. During Walker&#x27;s tenure, the firm survived the implosion of its corporate parent, Lehman Brothers, and was repurchased by the employees and has since been amongst the industry&#x27;s best performers. Walker is the first cousin once removed of 41st U.S. president George H. W. Bush, and the second cousin of 43rd president George W. Bush and Florida governor Jeb Bush.

==Early life and education ==
Walker was raised in St. Louis, Missouri. His parents are Kimberly Gedge and George Herbert Walker III, an investment brokerage executive and U.S. Ambassador to Hungary.

He comes from a family of industrialists and financiers, originally from St. Louis, Missouri. Walker&#x27;s great-grandfather, George Herbert Walker, was the founder of G. H. Walker &amp; Co., a securities firm, which eventually became part of Merrill Lynch. His grandfather, George Herbert Walker Jr., was a co-founder of the New York Mets. His grand-aunt, Dorothy, married Senator Prescott Bush, father of U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush and grandfather of U.S. President George Walker Bush.

He went to high school at St. Louis Country Day School. In 1986, he received a scholarship from the U.S. Congress and the German Bundestag to study in Germany for the 1986-87 school year.

Walker went to the University of Pennsylvania where he received the Harry S. Truman Scholarship and was a Benjamin Franklin Scholar. He was also a member of St. Anthony Hall. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and received a B.S. in Economics and a B.A. in European History, both &quot;&quot;.

He also received his MBA as a Palmer Scholar from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

== Career ==
Walker began his career on Wall Street when he joined Goldman Sachs in the Merger Department in 1992. Six years later, in 1998, Walker became one of the youngest partners in the firm&#x27;s history. He held several senior positions at Goldman, including co-head of the firm&#x27;s Wealth Management business / &quot;gs.com&quot;, and head of Alternative Investment Strategies.

President George Herbert Walker Bush appointed Walker to the Jacob Javits and Presidential Scholar Boards for the Department of Education.

Walker was recruited to a rival investment bank, Lehman Brothers, to head its Investment Management Division, of which Neuberger Berman was a part. Following Lehman&#x27;s bankruptcy, Walker led a management buyout and assumed his present position of chairman and CEO of Neuberger Berman. Neuberger Berman has been named as a Best Place to Work by Pensions and Investments for the last 10 years, finishing first or second.

In October 2023, Walker was elected to serve as Chair of the Investment Company Institute (ICI) Board of Governors.

== Community Service ==
Walker&#x27;s current board service includes the Partnership for New York City (Vice Chair), the Ford Foundation, Memorial Sloan Kettering Center and the Trinity School.

He served on the board of the New School University, Parsons School of Design (Chair), the University of Pennsylvania Arts &amp; Sciences’ Board of Advisors, and Youth EnterNet. He also served on the Mayor&#x27;s Fund to Advance New York City. In 2003, he funded the Alan Charles Kors Term Associate Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania in honor of a former professor.

== Personal life ==
He is married to the former Nancy Dorn.

<text>The Wyandotte Constitution is the constitution of the U.S. state of Kansas. Amended many times (including a universal suffrage amendment in 1912), the Wyandotte Constitution is still the .

==Background==

The Kansas Territory was created in 1854. The largest issue by far in territorial Kansas was whether slavery was to be permitted or prohibited; aside from the moral question, which at the time was seen as a religious question, the admission of Kansas to the highly polarized Union would help either the pro- or anti-slavery faction in Congress. As a procedure for resolving the issue, Congress accepted the proposal of Senator Stephen A. Douglas, that the question be settled by popular sovereignty: the residents of the territory would decide the question by vote. This did not work, because there was no accepted definition of who was a resident of the territory and could therefore vote. Hoping to make Kansas a slave state, thousands of &quot;Border Ruffians&quot; from the neighboring slave state of Missouri poured into Kansas, some with the intent to live in Kansas, but more planning to return to Missouri as soon as they had voted. The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society and similar groups sponsored free-state farmers who would move to Kansas. The most famous of these was John Brown, who told the free-state Kansans that violence was unfortunately necessary if Kansas were to be a free state. He put this into practice himself at the Pottawatomie massacre of 1856. As it was put later by his son John Brown, Jr., &quot;only force and fire-arms kept slavery out of Kansas&quot;.

The upshot was that there were sizeable pro- and anti-slavery factions in Kansas, although the former were more numerous, if one accepted at face value their claim to be genuine Kansas residents. The result was duelling constitutions: for several years Kansas had two governments, in two different cities (Lecompton and Lawrence), with two constitutions, one pro- and one anti-slavery, each claiming to be the only legitimate government of the entire territory.

==Duelling constitutions==
The convention drafting the Wyandotte Constitution was held between July 5, 1859 and on July 29, 1859, at Lipman Meyer&#x27;s Hall just north of Kaw Point in the former community of Wyandotte (which is now part of Kansas City, Kansas, in Wyandotte County, Kansas).

However, there were also three other constitutions made for Kansans to vote on: the Topeka Constitution, the Leavenworth Constitution, and the Lecompton Constitution. After voting took place in a climate of intimidation and open violence, the Lecompton Constitution was voted to be the constitution of Kansas, and would have made Kansas a slave state. All that was left to do was send it to Washington D.C. After a rigorous national debate over the topic, it was overruled, and the people of Kansas were set to vote on the four constitutions again.

The Wyandotte Constitution was approved in a referendum by a vote of 10,421 to 5,530 on October 4, 1859. In April, 1860, the United States House of Representatives voted 134 to 73 to admit Kansas under the Wyandotte Constitution; however, there was resistance in the United States Senate. As 11 slave states seceded from the Union, their senators left their seats and on January 21, 1861, the Senate passed the Kansas bill. The admission of Kansas as a free state became effective January 29, 1861.

==Contents==
The constitution settled the terms of Kansas&#x27; admission to the United States, particularly establishing that it would be a free state rather than a slave state. The constitution represented a pragmatic compromise over hotly contested issues: it rejected slavery and affirmed separate property rights for married women and their right to participate in school elections, but also denied universal suffrage for women, blacks, and Indians.

Solon O. Thacher of Lawrence gave a rousing speech opposing the exclusion of African-Americans from Kansas. The motion to exclude African-Americans was subsequently defeated, despite the fact that previously, &quot;all the Democrats and a few of the Republicans favored the exclusion.&quot;

Another issue delegates considered was that of women&#x27;s rights. Clarina Nichols, social activist and associated editor of &quot;Quindaro Chindowan&quot;, an abolitionist newspaper, was asked to address the convention. As a result of her efforts, women gained the rights to own property and to participate in school district elections. In addition, the constitution assured that the state would provide for women&#x27;s equal rights &quot;in the possession of their children.&quot;

The constitution dramatically reduced the size of the state so its western border did not extend as far as the Rocky Mountains which was part of Kansas Territory and at the time was the height of the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush. The three earlier constitutions had set the western border as the Rockies. The land that was given up became part of Colorado Territory.

<doc id="1201522" wikidata="Q194141" url="?curid=1201522" title="Draguignan">
<text>Draguignan (; ) is a commune in the Var department in the administrative region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur (formerly Provence), southeastern France.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department and self-proclaimed &quot;capital of Artillery&quot; and &quot;Porte du Verdon&quot;.

The city is from Saint-Tropez, and from Nice.

== Name and motto ==

According to legend, the name of the city is derived from the Latin name &quot;Draco/Draconem&quot; (&quot;dragon&quot;): a bishop, called Saint Hermentaire, killed a dragon and saved people.

The Latin motto of Draguignan is &quot;Alios nutrio, meos devoro&quot; (I nourish others, I devour my own).

== Geography ==

The elevation is 200 m. The highest hill near Draguignan is Malmont (551 m). The main river near Draguignan is the Nartuby.

The city is set in a valley NW-SE, about wide.

=== Climate ===

Draguignan&#x27;s climate is the same as the normal conditions of the Mediterranean climate. The nights of frost are rare and the negative temperatures occur only a few days a year. Thus the winters are mild and wet, and the summers warm and dry, the town is protected from the winds by the Malmont and the western massif of the Selves. During the summer the precipitation is extremely low whereas autumn is subjected to frequent rains.



=== Geology ===

The hills downstream of Draguignan date from the Middle Triassic, while those that rise upstream belong to the Upper Triassic.

Up North, we can see a long bar of stony plateau, with summits made of Jurassic limestones, sometimes intersected by deep canyons. This northern region of the &quot;baous&quot; or also called massive mountainous barriers, deeply wrinkled and fractured, reveals successive basins in the east–west direction.

Draguignan is in a zone of moderate risk of seismicity.

=== Communication routes ===

==== Roads ====

There is no highway going through the city of Draguignan but the town is directly connected by the D 1555 to a major highway, the A8.

A bypass route makes it possible to avoid the city center from the south when arriving from Trans-en-Provence and to get to the hospital in the north of the city more quickly.

The city is located 869 km away from Paris, 141 km from Marseille, 89 km from Nice, 86 km from Toulon, 30 km from Fréjus, 105 km from Digne-les-Bains and about 35 km from the Gulf of Saint-Tropez.

==== Rail transport ====
Since 1981, the closest railway station is Les Arcs–Draguignan, which is served by the TGV and is located twelve kilometers from the city center. Bus shuttles have been set by the agglomeration community of Draguignan from the former railway station of Draguignan, which was converted into a bus station. Draguignan train station features two turnstiles: one for SNCF and another for the transport of the agglomeration.

==== Public transport services ====
Urban transports are managed by the TED community, which offers three urban lines as well as lines to other municipalities such as Les Arcs-Draguignan, Ampus, Flayosc, Le Muy and Lorgues. The buses of the General Council of the Var serve from Draguignan the cities of Toulon, Brignoles, Aups, Fayence, Fréjus and Le Luc.

A project by BHNS is being studied, to connect Draguignan city center to Les Arcs-Draguignan station in 17 minutes instead of 25 minutes currently.

== History ==

The name of Draguignan (&quot;Draconianum&quot;) appeared for the first time in 909. During the Middle-Ages, Draguignan was a small village whose people lived from olive and grape cultivation. Draguignan became the &quot;prefecture&quot; of the Var in 1790, at the beginning of the French Revolution. This was despite the town by far not being the biggest city in the department. It remained the seat of the prefecture until 1974. In the 19th century and during a large part of the 20th century, the people of Draguignan (in French: &quot;Dracénois&quot;, in English: &quot;Draceners&quot;) voted for liberal parties (Radical-Socialist Party, Socialist Party).

The town was occupied by the Wehrmacht in 1942-44 and freed in August 1944, after Operation Dragoon. The city welcomed the &quot;Ecole nationale d&#x27;artillerie&quot; (Artillery School) in 1976, then the &quot;Ecole nationale d&#x27;infanterie&quot; (Infantry School) in 2010. The arrival of the military involved the development of the city : the small town became a city in the second part of the 20th century : 13,400 citizens in 1954, 33,000 in 2000, 38,000 in 2010. On June 15, 2010, the city was flooded. Torrential rain caused the deaths of 12 people in the town and 25 in the neighborhoods.

<doc id="1201525" wikidata="Q5498202" url="?curid=1201525" title="Frederick Keys">
<text>The Frederick Keys are a collegiate summer baseball team of the MLB Draft League. The Keys are based in Frederick, Maryland. The franchise is named for the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; writer Francis Scott Key, a native of Frederick County. A new team mascot &quot;Frank Key&quot;, short for Francis Scott Key, joined the current mascot, a coyote named &quot;Keyote&quot;, at the beginning of the 2011 baseball season. The Keys were purchased from Maryland Baseball Holding, LLC by Attain Sports and Entertainment in January 2022. Home games are played at Harry Grove Stadium.

Prior to Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues following the 2020 season, the Keys were a Minor League Baseball team that served as the Class A-Advanced affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles from 1989 to 2020.

== History ==

=== Early professional baseball in Frederick ===
Frederick was one of the founding members of the Blue Ridge League, which existed from 1915 to 1930. The team, which went by the names of Hustlers, Champs and Warriors, won league championships in 1915 and 1921. Games were played at the Frederick Fairgrounds until 1924 when McCurdy Field was built. With the collapse of the Blue Ridge League in 1931, it would be several decades before professional baseball returned to Frederick.

Frederick players from this era who were major leaguers:

* Clyde Barnhart: 1915, 1916, 1917
* Tom Connolly: 1915
* Bill Lamar: 1915
* Leo Meyer: 1916
* Tom Crooke: 1917
* Clarence Blethen: 1920, 1921, 1922, 1923
* Ray Gardner: 1920, 1922, 1923, 1925
* Ray Hartranft: 1920
* Duke Sedgwick: 1922
* Jim Keesey: 1923
* Norm McNeil: 1923
* Bobby Schang: 1923
* Chick Fullis: 1924, 1925, 1926
* Karl Kolseth: 1924
* Bill Hohman: 1924
* Rollie Hemsley: 1925, 1926, 1927
* Larry Boerner:1926
* Jimmie DeShong:1928
* Joe Vosmik: 1929
* Milt Galatzer: 1930
* Bill Perrin: 1930
=== Minor League Baseball (1989–2020) ===
The team was founded in 1989 when the Baltimore Orioles decided to move their Class A Carolina League affiliate from Hagerstown, Maryland. The city of Frederick convinced the owners of the then-Hagerstown Suns to move the team to Frederick and promised a 4,000-seat stadium to be built for the 1990 season. For the 1989 season, the Keys played at McCurdy Field, a Babe Ruth League stadium, while waiting for the construction of the new stadium to be completed. The Keys opened by losing both ends of a doubleheader (including a seven-inning perfect game by Dennis Burlingame) against the Durham Bulls. Their first win came on April 11, 1989, with a 3–1 victory over the Kinston Indians in the Keys&#x27; first-ever home game.

Only two players in Keys history have been transferred directly from Frederick to the Baltimore Orioles (excluding rehab related transfers). On September 3, 1996, Eugene Kingsale&#x27;s contract was purchased by the Orioles. On June 11, 2005, Jeff Fiorentino&#x27;s contract was purchased by the Orioles in order to replace the injured Luis Matos.

The 2020 Minor League Baseball season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Keys did not receive an invitation to remain in affiliated baseball as part of the 2021 reorganization of Minor League Baseball, and instead joined the newly-formed MLB Draft League.

<text>Illinois Route 62 (IL 62) is a east–west state highway in northeast Illinois. It runs from western Algonquin at IL 31 (Western Algonquin Bypass) to the intersection with IL 83 (Elmhurst Road) by industrial Mount Prospect.

==Route description==
IL 62 is called Algonquin Road for its entire length, and it is a northern parallel to Interstate 90 (I-90). It is one of the few state roads in Illinois to be shorter than the name of the road that it marks, as Algonquin Road continues westward as McHenry CR A48 to IL 47 (about ), eastward as a local road to Oakton Street and Riverside Drive by I-294 (about ), and northward as a local road to U.S. Route 14 (US 14, about ) in Fox River Grove. The eastward extent of Algonquin Road is mainly residential, however. It is a four lane street through downtown Algonquin and then shifts to a two lane rural road east of IL 25. It returns to a four lane urban artery east of IL 59.

In 2017, IL 62 had an average daily traffic (ADT) of 35,000 on the segment between in Algonquin west of IL 25; 27,000 on the segment between IL 25 and Helm Road; and 39,000 on the segment east of IL 68.

==History==
SBI Route 62 was Algonquin to Chicago along the current IL 62. It followed Oakton Street and Talcott Road (in Park Ridge) to reach IL 43. By 1979, IL 62 was dropped east of IL 83. In 2014, the western terminus of IL 62 was extended west from Main Street to Western Algonquin Bypass.

The Western Algonquin Bypass opened to traffic in September 2014. The bypass has a diamond interchange with Algonquin Road. The bypass removes through north–south traffic on IL-31 from Main Street at the intersection of Main Street and Algonquin Road/IL 62 in downtown Algonquin.

==Future==
The Western Algonquin Bypass is not the only limited access bypass on the table anymore as of 2015. A southern Algonquin bypass is also being constructed as the Longmeadow Parkway which terminates at IL 62 in Barrington Hills.

Starting in 2017, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) conducted a study of IL 62 from IL 25 to IL 68. The recommended alternative is to convert this section of IL 62 into a four-lane divided highway with a separate multi-use trail. When this is completed, IL 62 will be four lanes for substantially its entire length.

<text>The Delmarva Shorebirds are a Minor League Baseball team based in Salisbury, Maryland. They are members of the Carolina League and the Single-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. Their home games are played at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium. The Shorebirds were members of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) from 1996 to 2020 and the Low-A East in 2021, though this was renamed the Carolina League and reclassified as Single-A in 2022. They won two SAL championships, in 1997 and 2000. Also in 1997, the Shorebirds received &quot;Baseball America&#x27;s&quot; Bob Freitas Award for Class A baseball.

==History==
Frank Perdue&#x27;s desire for a professional baseball team based in Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore was the driving force in bringing a franchise to Salisbury. Joining the Maryland Baseball Limited Partnership, owners of the Bowie Baysox and Frederick Keys, set the concept in motion. By Autumn 1995 Maryland Baseball purchased the Albany Polecats from Richard M. Holtzman, relocated the franchise to Salisbury and renamed it the Delmarva Shorebirds. The name &quot;Shorebirds&quot; refers to the marine waterfowl of the Delmarva Peninsula. The team name was chosen by 7-year-old Katie Duffy of Newark, Delaware. The team&#x27;s geographic appellation is a portmanteau of the states that govern counties on the peninsula: Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia (abbreviated VA).

The Shorebirds&#x27; first-ever game at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium was a 4–2 win over the Columbus RedStixx before a crowd of 5,787 on April 17, 1996. After fulfilling its two-year Player Development Contract with the Montreal Expos, it officially became an affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles on September 26, 1996.

The Shorebirds hosted the 2011 South Atlantic League &quot;Strike Out Hunger&quot; All-Star Game on June 21, 2011. The Shorebirds partnered with Perdue Farms, the Community Foundation of the Eastern Shore and Delmarva&#x27;s three food banks: Eastern Shore Branch of the Maryland Food Bank, the Food Bank of Delaware, and the Eastern Shore Branch of the Food Bank of Southeastern Virginia; to help &quot;Strike Out Hunger&quot;. Perdue and the Community Foundation of the Eastern Shore donated $20 to the food banks for each strike out by a Shorebirds pitcher during the Shorebirds 2011 season.

The Kyle Moore-managed Shorebirds in 2019 clinched their first postseason berth since 2005 by winning the SAL Northern Division first-half title with the minors&#x27; best midseason record at 48–21. A franchise-best 90–48 finish made them the 14th SAL team since 1980 to reach 90 wins in a regular season and the first since the Augusta GreenJackets in 2006. The season ended when the Shorebirds were swept by the Hickory Crawdads in the best-of-three SAL Northern Division Championship Series.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Shorebirds were organized into the Low-A East at the Low-A classification. In 2022, the Low-A East became known as the Carolina League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

==Radio==
The Shorebirds can be found on Fox Sports 960 AM, the Shorebirds&#x27; Flagship Station since 2005. Will DeBoer has been the radio voice of the Shorebirds since 2017 but is being replaced for the 2021 season by Sam Jellinek. Mitchell Speltz is the current voice of the Shorebirds. Former announcers include Randy Scott, Bret Lasky and Brendan Gulick.

<text>Thomas Richard Christy Jr. (born April 1, 1974) is an American drummer and radio personality, best known for being the former drummer for several heavy metal bands since the early 1990s, most notably Death, and his tenure on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. Born and raised in Kansas, Christy took an interest in rock and heavy metal music in his youth, and started playing the drums at age ten. He played in several bands while at school.

Christy&#x27;s music career began in 1992 when he joined the Springfield, Missouri group Public Assassin, and also worked as an electrician. In 1996, Christy formed Burning Inside and relocated to Orlando, Florida, where he joined and toured with several popular heavy metal bands until 2004, including Acheron, Death, Control Denied, Iced Earth, and Leash Law.

In 2004, Christy took a break from music and relocated to New York City to join &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. He has written, directed, and acted in several home made independent films and has performed as a stand-up comedian. He returned to music in 2009 when he formed his own metal band, Charred Walls of the Damned.

== Early life ==
Thomas Richard Christy was born in Fort Scott, Kansas on April 1, 1974. His father is a Vietnam veteran. Christy grew up in the nearby town of Redfield, on a &quot;farm in the middle of nowhere&quot;. According to the 2020 census, the town has a population of 90. He became a fan of Kiss and Meat Loaf from four years old when his aunt introduced him to them and bought him their albums a year later. His elder neighbor, a fan of heavy metal music, introduced him to &quot;Metal Health&quot; (1983) by Quiet Riot which had a considerable effect on Christy. He recalled, &quot;I heard those drums and that music and was just blown away. I was new to that whole sound ... Quiet Riot felt like the next step up in terms of heaviness&quot;. He proceeded to save up his pocket money to purchase the album on audio cassette. Albums that influenced him during this time included &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; (1984) by Twisted Sister and &quot;Powerslave&quot; (1984) by Iron Maiden. In 1992, he started playing the guitar.

Christy wished to learn the drums after he heard &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; by Van Halen, in 1984. His parents had no issue with his decision, and to this day, they remain supportive of his career. When he turned ten, his parents bought him his first drum pad and sticks, practicing on it before they purchased his first full professional kit at a junkyard for $100. Christy bought instructional videos to improve his technique, including tapes from Terry Bozzio. Later in his development, drummers Dave Lombardo and Pete Sandoval inspired him to play fast. He was also influenced by drummers Frankie Banali, Mikkey Dee, Bobby Jarzombek, Sean Reinert, and Gene Hoglan. At fourteen, Christy attended his first concert, seeing Stryper and White Lion.

Christy&#x27;s first group was playing in a school band in the mid-1980s which included a position in the school&#x27;s marching band, playing the snare drum and tympani, which he particularly enjoyed, and wrote a song dedicated to the experience and his teachers named &quot;Forever Marching On&quot;. He passed his school music exams, and played in his first &quot;legitimate&quot; rock group, Syzygy, at around fifteen which involved live gigs in local bars. Around this time, Christy formed a short lived &quot;joke band&quot;, Bung Dizeez, along with Paul Brewer, Gary White, and sometimes Les Henderson. Their first gig took place &quot;on a hay wagon at a keg party.&quot; The three wore jock straps over their clothes and performing parody songs and Judas Priest covers. In 1992, Christy graduated from Uniontown High School in Uniontown, Kansas, where he also lettered in baseball.

== Career ==
=== Music ===
In 1992, the 18-year-old Christy decided to pursue music in college in Kansas. In the week before he was set to begin, he heard one of his favorite bands, Public Assassin from Springfield, Missouri, were looking for a new drummer. After a successful audition in August 1992, he chose to join them rather than study. He then moved from his Fort Scott home and into &quot;an old warehouse&quot; in Springfield, and played on &quot;Raw as Fuck&quot;, a same-titled mini-CD, and a demo titled &quot;Murdered&quot;. They toured the midwest across 1993, playing covers. As he needed further income to support himself, Christy learned to become a residential electrician. In December 1993, Christy and Public Assassin guitarist Steve Childers formed a comical group, Skip Skiffington and The Elite, with Skiffington on vocals and Rick Granberg on keyboards. During this time, Christy played in a &quot;joke punk band&quot; with several friends named Pisser, playing GG Allin and Cocknoose covers. In 1995, Public Assassin disbanded after Christy and Childers had several differences with singer/bassist Greg Ponder.

In late 1995, Christy and Childers formed Burning Inside new recruits Jamie Prim on vocals/bass and, later on, Michael Estes on guitar. To increase their potential, the group relocated in February 1996 to Orlando, Florida, an area favorable for the metal scene. Christy arrived by car, carrying everything he owned. They toured, recorded songs for five metal tribute albums, and produced a six-song demo tape of new material released as &quot;The Eve of the Entities&quot; (2000). Christy stayed in Florida for eight years. His income from music and electric work was limited, so he could only afford accommodation in a storage unit where he also kept and practiced his drums for as much as six hours each day. With only an outside garden hose to shower with, he later wrote a song about his appreciation for more comfortable living named &quot;The Beast Outside My Window&quot;. Christy joined local metal group Acheron, touring and playing on &quot;Anti-God, Anti-Christ&quot; (1996) and &quot;Necromanteion Communion&quot; (1998). His boss at his electrical company allowed him to spend time away to record and tour with his bands.

In 1997, Christy met fellow Orlando resident, singer and guitarist Chuck Schuldiner, in a chance encounter at a Florida book store in Altamonte Mall. Schuldiner was, and remains, an influential figure in Christy&#x27;s career. Christy was a big fan of Schuldiner&#x27;s metal band Death, so when he learned the group needed a drummer his friends suggested his name and he was offered an audition. Christy knew &quot;all of their albums ... back and forth&quot;, and auditioned in July 1997 with only Schuldiner and himself present. The audition was a success, and Christy played on &quot;The Sound of Perseverance&quot; (1998), an album he called &quot;the album I&#x27;m most proud of&quot;. In May 1998, Christy toured Europe for four months with Death, which included a spot at the Dynamo Open Air festival in the Netherlands in front of 35,000 people. A friendship and musical camaraderie with Schuldiner also brought Christy into the line-up of Schuldiner&#x27;s progressive metal group, the more melodic Control Denied. Christy played drums on their debut album, &quot;The Fragile Art of Existence&quot; (1999) and &quot;When Man and Machine Collide&quot;, an incomplete album that is yet to be released. The two became close friends, and Christy would spend several Thanksgiving holidays with Schuldiner&#x27;s family. In December 2001, Schuldiner died from brain cancer. Christy remains close with the family.

Between 1999 and 2004, Christy became a member of Iced Earth and Leash Law, timing his schedule in order to perform in multiple bands at once. In April 2000, he played with Incantation on their tour in support of &quot;The Infernal Storm&quot; (2000), playing to audiences of several hundred at each show. Afterwards, he toured Europe with Demons and Wizards, playing festivals of up to 20,000 people in attendance. He landed the gig in Iced Earth through contacts he knew at Century Media Records, a prominent heavy metal label. His first live gigs with them followed in August 2000, playing festivals including the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany.

In 2004, Christy began a five-and-a-half year hiatus as an active musician, but kept in touch with the metal scene by practicing his drums, attending local concerts, and writing articles for several publications. By 2008, he started to write new material, playing the guitar more than he had done previously, and ended up with an entire album in demo form. He signed a recording deal with Metal Blade Records in 2009 to release an album with his metal supergroup, Charred Walls of the Damned. He asked his first choice of musicians to take part in the project: bassist Steve Di Giorgio, vocalist Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens and guitarist Jason Suecof. It took roughly three months for Christy to settle on the band&#x27;s name, and had around 200 possible names as &quot;every good band name has been taken&quot;. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2010. Their second, &quot;Cold Winds on Timeless Days&quot;, followed in 2011. Christy named the latter as the first letter of each word matched the band&#x27;s initials.

Christy has performed live with Dream Theater, &quot;A Favor House Atlantic&quot; with Coheed and Cambria, Tiwanaku, Rick Renstrom, and Wykked Wytch.

Sometime after 2011, Christy put together music that featured his three guinea pigs. Three of the songs were released under the band name Boar Glue as part of a split EP with Hatebeak, another band that features an African grey parrot.

=== &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; ===
Christy became an avid listener of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in 1996 when he moved to Florida, listening to the program &quot;every morning religiously&quot; with headphones while he worked as an electrician. After he obtained the number to reach the show&#x27;s answering machine from the Internet, he began to submit comical voicemail messages in 1999, that were played frequently on the air. From 2001, Christy began to send in song parodies and bits about staffers Robin Quivers and K.C. Armstrong. He made his debut appearance on April 24, 2003, when the show was broadcast from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Christy lost a round of blackjack in hope of winning a date with a porn star.

Following the departure of &quot;Stuttering John&quot; Melendez in February 2004, Stern announced the Get John&#x27;s Job contest a month later, pitting ten listeners who had contributed to the show against each other in competition for the vacated position. Each contestant was given a week to display their talents they could bring to the show, after which the listeners voted online for their favorite. Christy produced a required demo CD of his bits, and was selected to compete for the prize of an initial three-month contract and $25,000. Leaving Iced Earth was a difficult decision for Christy, but felt he could not waste the opportunity to pursue his &quot;dream job&quot; and work for Stern. He had also grown tired of living in Florida, and wished to move. On July 1, 2004, Christy won the contest with 30% of the vote; Sal Governale was second with 24%. By September 2004, both had joined the show as full-time staff members. Christy then relocated from Florida to New York City, where the show is based.

Christy has become known on the show for his prank calls, song parodies, and outrageous stunts, usually performed with Governale. He faced challengers in porn trivia in Stump the Perv, vomited on guests, received a bikini wax, and painted his genitals. From 2005, Christy performed nationwide as a stand-up comedian as part of the Killers of Comedy Tour with other show cast members.

In 2006, the show relocated to Sirius XM Radio. Christy hosted a semi-regular metal show on the Liquid Metal channel named &quot;Richard Christy&#x27;s Heavy Metal Hoedown&quot;. Christy also hosted &quot;Inside the Porn Actors Studio&quot; on Howard 101, an interview series that parodied the television series &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; with porn actresses, with Christy filling the role of host James Lipton.

=== Film and television ===
Christy once dreamed of a career in film after he saw Brad Pitt, from nearby Springfield, Missouri, in &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;. He hung up posters of Pitt in his New York City apartment, and once worked at a computer store owned by Pitt&#x27;s parents. He has been a fan of horror films since his youth, and rates &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978) as his &quot;faaavorite&quot;. In the mid-1990s, while living in Missouri, he started to make his own independent, low budget films. His first, &quot;Evil Ned 2&quot;, a horror comedy was made in 1994. This was followed by its sequel, &quot;Evil Ned 3: The Return of Evil Ned 2 – Electric Boogaloo&quot;, in 1995, with a plot involving &quot;dirty magazines, huge hog testicles, gay monsters, Amish erotica, and evil talking ducks&quot;. The film was produced for $250, &quot;200 of which was spent on beer&quot;. The film premiered at a Missouri hotel, and was made available online in 2007. In 2001, Christy released his feature-length film, &quot;Leaving Grunion County&quot;. Its premiere was held at the Enzian Theater in Maitland, Florida that April.

In 2006, Christy and Governale wrote, directed, and starred in the 30-minute comedy film &quot;Supertwink&quot; for Stern&#x27;s on-demand digital cable service Howard Stern On Demand. It premiered at the Pioneer Theater in New York City on January 4, 2006. The film was reviewed by critic Richard Roeper, who panned it. In 2007, Christy appeared in &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot; playing the role of a Ku Klux Klansman named Kenny. In the same year, he landed his first television role &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, portraying a &quot;really creepy guy at end of bar&quot;. In 2009, he appeared as Caleb in the horror film &quot;Albino Farm&quot;. Also in 2009, Christy and Governale appeared in the 2009 horror novel &quot;Castaways&quot;, written by horror and crime novelist Brian Keene. Christy has recorded voiceovers for the Adult Swim shows &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;. He guest appeared on the Cartoon Network series &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot;, playing Ric. Christy later made a cameo in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; as a character simply named &quot;Down There!&quot;.

Christy has written articles for &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine about his love for horror films, named &quot;Richard Christy&#x27;s Horrorscope&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Christy married Kristin Jenco on July 30, 2011, in New York City. They have one son, Carson Cain Christy, born in 2017, and affectionately known as &quot;Bubby&quot;. Carson is named after former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, Carson Wentz. The Eagles are Kristin&#x27;s favorite team. If they have another son, they plan to name him Patrick after Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, Patrick Mahomes. The Chiefs are Richard&#x27;s favorite team. Prior to Super Bowl LIV, on the &quot;Howard Stern Wrap Up Show&quot;, Christy met Patrick Mahomes and tearfully told him that he loved him and explained his intention to name his next son after him. He later named his second son Cameron instead. He is also a Kansas City Royals fan and attended the 2015 World Series between the Royals and New York Mets with fellow &quot;Howard Stern Show&quot; co-worker Gary Dell&#x27;Abate (who is an avid Mets fan).

<text>Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED; ; ) is a department of the Government of Canada. ISED is responsible for a number of the federal government&#x27;s functions in regulating industry and commerce, promoting science and innovation, and supporting economic development. The department was known as Industry Canada (IC) prior to 2015.

The department is led by the minister of innovation, science and industry (currently François-Philippe Champagne), who also serves as the registrar general of Canada and is responsible for the department to Parliament. Several other ministerial portfolios are associated with the department. While the minister is head of the department, and provides policy/political direction, the day-to-day operations of the department are managed by the deputy minister, who is a public servant. The department headquarters are located at the C.D. Howe Building at 235 Queen Street in Ottawa, Ontario.

==History==

The Department of Trade and Commerce was created in statute on 23 June 1887 and proclaimed into force on 3 December 1892. In 1969, the department was replaced by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce, which itself was replaced in 1990 by Industry, Science and Technology. This new department also absorbed the offices of Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion and Minister of State for Science and Technology, marking the inclusion of regional approaches and scientific emphasis in the development of Canadian industries. In 1993, the department expanded its portfolio further to include Consumer and Corporate Affairs. In March 1995, the department was renamed Industry Canada.

Upon the November 2015 installation of the 29th Canadian Ministry led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the position &quot;Minister of Industry&quot; was renamed &quot;Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development&quot;. Subsequently, applied title under the Federal Identity Program was changed from &quot;Industry Canada&quot; to &quot;Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada&quot;.

==Officials and structure==

<text>A compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), also called compact fluorescent light, energy-saving light and compact fluorescent tube, is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent light bulb; some types fit into light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs. The lamps use a tube that is curved or folded to fit into the space of an incandescent bulb, and a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp.

Compared to general-service incandescent lamps giving the same amount of visible light, CFLs use one-fifth to one-third the electric power, and last eight to fifteen times longer. A CFL has a higher purchase price than an incandescent lamp, but can save over five times its purchase price in electricity costs over the lamp&#x27;s lifetime. Like all fluorescent lamps, CFLs contain toxic mercury, which complicates their disposal. In many countries, governments have banned the disposal of CFLs together with regular garbage. These countries have established special collection systems for CFLs and other hazardous waste.

The principle of operation remains the same as in other fluorescent lighting: electrons that are bound to mercury atoms are excited to states where they will radiate ultraviolet light as they return to a lower energy level; this emitted ultraviolet light is converted into visible light as it strikes the fluorescent coating.

CFLs radiate a spectral power distribution that is different from that of incandescent lamps. Improved phosphor formulations have improved the perceived color of the light emitted by CFLs, so that some sources rate the best &quot;soft white&quot; CFLs as subjectively similar in color to standard incandescent lamps.

White LED lamps compete with CFLs for high-efficiency lighting. General Electric has since stopped production of domestic CFL lamps in the United States in favour of LEDs.

== History ==
The parent to the modern fluorescent lamp was invented in the 1890s by Peter Cooper Hewitt. The Cooper Hewitt lamps were used for photographic studios and industries.

Edmund Germer, Friedrich Meyer, and Hans Spanner patented a high-pressure vapor lamp in 1927. George Inman later teamed with General Electric to create a practical fluorescent lamp, sold in 1938 and patented in 1941. Circular and U-shaped lamps were devised to reduce the length of fluorescent light fixtures. The first fluorescent light bulb and fixture were displayed to the general public at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

The spiral CFL was invented in 1976 by Edward E. Hammer, an engineer with General Electric, in response to the 1973 oil crisis. Although the design met its goals, it would have cost GE about $25 million to build new factories to produce the lamps, and thus the invention was shelved. The design was eventually copied by others.

In 1980, Philips introduced its model SL*18, which was a screw-in or bayonet mount lamp with integral magnetic ballast. The lamp used a folded T4 tube, stable tri-color phosphors, and a mercury amalgam. This was the first successful screw-in replacement for an incandescent lamp, using new rare earth aluminum lattice phosphors to solve the problem of lumen depreciation that would normally occur quickly in such a thin tube; however, it was not widely adopted, because of its large size, weight (over half a kilogram), pronounced 50 Hz flicker and 3-minute warm up time. It was based on the SL1000 prototype from 1976. In 1985, Osram started selling its model Dulux EL, which was the first CFL to include an electronic ballast.

Volume was an issue in CFL development, since the fluorescent lamps had to fit in the same volume as comparable incandescent lamps. This required the development of new, high-efficacy phosphors that could withstand more power per unit area than the phosphors used in older, larger fluorescent tubes.

In 1995, helical CFLs, manufactured in China by Shanghai Xiangshan, became commercially available. They were first proposed by General Electric, who saw difficulties bending glass tubes into spirals using automated machinery. Xiangshan solved this problem by bending the tubes by hand, made possible by the then-low labor costs in China. Since that time, sales steadily increased. The phosphor coating in spiral CFLs is uneven, being thicker at the bottom than at the top, owing to the effect of gravity during the coating process. Although their popularity varied across countries, in China CFLs were the &quot;dominant technology in the residential segment&quot; in 2011.

Philips Lighting ceased research on compact fluorescent in 2008 and began devoting the bulk of its research and development budget to solid-state lighting such as LED lighting.

The rise of LED lighting, however, significantly affected CFL sales and production. As a result of decreasing cost and better features, customers increasingly migrated toward LEDs. In India, &quot;nearly 60 per cent of the lighting market ... has been taken over by LEDs&quot; by 2018. LED prices fell well below US$5 for a basic bulb in 2015. In the United States, CFLs were also facing the possibility of proposed regulations for 2017 that would create difficulty qualifying for the Energy Star rating. In early 2016, General Electric announced it would phase out CFL production in the US.

On September 1, 2021, the EU banned the export, import, manufacture and sale of all compact fluorescent lamps with integrated ballasts. 


== Pattern ==
There are two types of CFLs — integrated and non-integrated lamps, where CFL-i denotes an integrated ballast and CFL-ni denotes a non-integrated ballast. Integrated lamps combine the tube and ballast in a single unit. These lamps allow consumers to replace incandescent lamps easily with CFLs. Integrated CFLs work well in many standard incandescent light fixtures, reducing the cost of converting to fluorescent. 3-way lamps and dimmable models with standard bases are available.

Non-integrated CFLs have the ballast permanently installed in the luminaire, and usually only the fluorescent tube is changed at its end of life. Since the ballasts are placed in the light fixture, they are larger and last longer compared to the integrated ones, and they do not need to be replaced when the tube reaches its end-of-life. Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more expensive and sophisticated. They have two types of tubes: a bi-pin tube designed for conventional ballast, e.g. with G23 or G24d plug-in base, and a quad-pin tube designed for an electronic ballast or a conventional ballast with an external starter. A bi-pin tube contains an integrated starter, which obviates the need for external heating pins but causes incompatibility with electronic ballasts.
Non-integrated CFLs can also be installed in a conventional light fixture using an adapter containing a built-in magnetic ballast. The adapter consists of a regular bulb screw, the ballast itself and a clip for the lamp&#x27;s connector.

CFLs have two main components: a magnetic or electronic ballast and a gas-filled tube (also called bulb or burner). Replacement of magnetic ballasts with electronic ballasts has removed most of the flickering and slow starting traditionally associated with fluorescent lighting, and has allowed the development of smaller lamps directly interchangeable with more sizes of incandescent light bulb.

Electronic ballasts contain a small circuit board with a bridge rectifier, a filter capacitor and usually two switching transistors, which are often insulated-gate bipolar transistors. The incoming AC current is first rectified to DC, then converted to high frequency AC by the transistors, connected as a resonant series DC to AC inverter. The resulting high frequency is applied to the lamp tube. Since the resonant converter tends to stabilize lamp current (and light emitted) over a range of input voltages, standard CFLs respond poorly in dimming applications and will experience a shorter lifespan and sometimes catastrophic failure. Special electronic ballasts (integrated or separate) are required for dimming service.

CFL light output is roughly proportional to phosphor surface area, and high output CFLs are often larger than their incandescent equivalents. This means that the CFL may not fit well in existing light fixtures.
To fit enough phosphor coated area within the approximate overall dimensions of an incandescent lamp, standard shapes of CFL tube are a helix with one or more turns, multiple parallel tubes, circular arc, or a butterfly.

Some CFLs are labeled not to be run base up, since heat will shorten the ballast&#x27;s life. Such CFLs are unsuitable for use in pendant lights and especially unsuitable for recessed light fixtures. CFLs designed for use in such fixtures are available. Current recommendations for fully enclosed, unventilated light fixtures (such as those recessed into insulated ceilings), are either to use &quot;reflector CFLs&quot; (R-CFL), cold-cathode CFLs or to replace such fixtures with those designed for CFLs. A CFL will thrive in areas that have good airflow, such as in a table lamp.

==Characteristics==
===Spectrum of light===

CFLs emit light from a mix of phosphors, each emitting one band of color with some bands still in the ultraviolet range as can be seen on the light spectrum. Modern phosphor designs balance the emitted light color, energy efficiency, and cost. Every extra phosphor added to the coating mix improves color rendering but decreases efficiency and increases cost. Good quality consumer CFLs use three or four phosphors to achieve a &quot;white&quot; light with a color rendering index (CRI) of about 80, where the maximum 100 represents the appearance of colors under daylight or other sources of black-body radiation such as an incandescent light bulb (depending on the correlated color temperature).

Color temperature can be indicated in kelvins or mireds (1 million divided by the color temperature in kelvins). The color temperature of a light source is the temperature of a black body that has the same chromaticity (i.e. color) as the light source. A notional temperature, the correlated color temperature, the temperature of a black body that emits light of a hue that to human color perception most closely matches the light from the lamp, is assigned.

The color temperature is characteristic of black-body radiation; practical white light sources approximate the radiation of a black body at a given temperature, but will not have an identical spectrum. In particular, narrow bands of shorter-wavelength radiation are usually present even for lamps of low color temperature (&quot;warm&quot; light).

As color temperature increases, the shading of the white light changes from red to yellow to white to blue. Color names used for modern CFLs and other tri-phosphor lamps vary between manufacturers, unlike the standardized names used with older halophosphate fluorescent lamps. For example, Sylvania&#x27;s Daylight CFLs have a color temperature of 3500 K, while most other lamps called &quot;daylight&quot; have color temperatures of at least 5000 K. In United States, Energy Star&#x27;s specification provides a set of named color temperatures for certified luminaries.

===Lifespan===
CFLs typically have a rated service life of 6000–15,000 hours, whereas standard incandescent lamps have a service life of 750 or 1000 hours. However, the actual lifetime of any lamp depends on many factors, including operating voltage, manufacturing defects, exposure to voltage spikes, mechanical shock, frequency of cycling on and off, lamp orientation, and ambient operating temperature, among other factors.

The life of a CFL is significantly shorter if it is turned on and off frequently or is used in a totally enclosed fixture. This happens because the electrodes in a CFL undergo sputtering every time it is turned on; this also happens in fluorescent tubes. Material from the electrodes is ejected every time sputtering occurs and it is deposited on the fluorescent tube&#x27;s walls, showing as lamp end darkening. In the case of a 5-minute on/off cycle the lifespan of some CFLs may be reduced to that of incandescent light bulbs. The US Energy Star program suggests that fluorescent lamps be left on when leaving a room for less than 15 minutes to mitigate this problem. CFLs emit less light later in their lives than when they are new. The light output decay is exponential, with the fastest losses being soon after the lamp is first used. By the end of their lives, CFLs can be expected to emit 70–80% of their original light output. The response of the human eye to light is logarithmic. That is, while the human eye is highly sensitive to changes in the intensity of faint light sources, it is less sensitive to changes in the intensity of brighter light sources since the pupils compensate by dilating or constricting. So, presuming the illumination provided by the lamp was ample at the beginning of its life, and the light output of a bulb gradually decreases by 25%, viewers will perceive a much smaller change in light intensity.

Fluorescent lamps get dimmer over their lifetime, so what starts out as an adequate luminosity may become inadequate. In one test by the U.S. Department of Energy, of &quot;Energy Star&quot; products in 2003–04, one quarter of tested CFLs no longer met their rated output after 40% of their rated service life.

===Energy efficiency===
Because the eye&#x27;s sensitivity changes with the wavelength, the output of lamps is commonly measured in lumens, a measure of the power of light as perceived by the human eye. The luminous efficacy of lamps is the number of lumens emitted for each watt of electric power used. The luminous efficacy of a typical CFL is 50–70 lumens per watt (lm/W) and that of a typical incandescent lamp is . Compared to a theoretical 100%-efficient lamp (), CFL lamps have lighting efficiency ranges of 7–10%, versus 1.5–2.5% for incandescents.

Because of their higher efficacy, CFLs use between one-seventh and one-third of the power of equivalent incandescent lamps. Of 2010 world total lighting sales, 50 to 70 percent were incandescent. Replacing all inefficient lighting with CFLs would save per year, 2.5% of world electricity use. In the US, it is estimated that replacing all incandescents would save 80 TWh yearly. Since CFLs use much less energy than incandescent lamps (ILs), a phase-out of ILs would result in less carbon dioxide () being emitted into the atmosphere. Exchanging ILs for efficient CFLs on a global scale would achieve annual reductions of 230 Mt (million tons), more than the combined yearly emissions of the Netherlands and Portugal.

If a building&#x27;s indoor incandescent lamps are replaced by CFLs, the heat emitted due to lighting is significantly reduced. In warm climates, or in office or industrial buildings where air conditioning is often required, CFLs reduce the load on the cooling system when compared to the use of incandescent lamps, resulting in savings in electricity in addition to the energy efficiency savings of the lamps. However, in cooler climates in which buildings require heating, the heating system must replace the reduced heat from lighting fixtures. In Winnipeg, Canada, it was estimated that CFLs would only generate 17% savings in energy compared to incandescent bulbs, as opposed to the 75% savings that could have been expected without space heating considerations.

===Cost===
While the purchase price of a CFL is typically 3–10 times greater than that of an equivalent incandescent lamp, a CFL lasts 8–15 times longer and uses two-thirds to three-quarters less energy. A US article stated &quot;A household that invested $90 in changing 30 fixtures to CFLs would save $440 to $1,500 over the five-year life of the bulbs, depending on your cost of electricity. Look at your utility bill and imagine a 12% discount to estimate the savings.&quot;

CFLs are extremely cost-effective in commercial buildings when used to replace incandescent lamps. Using average U.S. commercial electricity and gas rates for 2006, a 2008 article found that replacing each 75 W incandescent lamp with a CFL resulted in yearly savings of $22 in energy usage, reduced HVAC cost, and reduced labour to change lamps. The incremental capital investment of $2 per fixture is typically paid back in about one month. Savings are greater and payback periods shorter in regions with higher electric rates and, to a lesser extent, also in regions with higher than U.S. average cooling requirements. However, frequent on-off cycling (turning on and off) of CFLs greatly reduces their lifespan.

The current price of CFLs reflects the manufacturing of nearly all CFLs in China, where labour costs less. In September 2010, the Winchester, Virginia, General Electric plant closed, leaving Osram Sylvania and the tiny American Light Bulb Manufacturing Inc. the last companies to make standard incandescent bulbs in the United States. At that time, Ellis Yan, whose Chinese company made the majority of CFLs sold in the United States, said he was interested in building a United States factory to make CFL bulbs, but wanted $12.5 million from the U.S. government to do so. General Electric had considered changing one of its bulb plants to make CFLs, but said that even after a $40 million investment in converting a plant, wage differences would mean costs would be 50% higher.

According to an August 2009 newspaper report, some manufacturers claimed that CFLs could be used to replace higher-power incandescent lamps than justified by their light output. Equivalent wattage claims can be replaced by comparison of actual light output emitted by the lamp, which is measured in lumens and marked on the packaging.
===Failure===
In addition to the wear-out failure modes common to all fluorescent lamps, the electronic ballast may fail, since it has a number of component parts. Ballast failures are usually due to overheating and may be accompanied by discoloration or distortion of the ballast enclosure, odors, or smoke. The lamps are internally protected and are meant to fail safely at the end of their lives. Industry associations are working toward advising consumers of the different failure modes of CFLs compared to incandescent lamps, and to develop lamps with inoffensive failure modes. New North American technical standards aim to eliminate smoke or excess heat at the end of lamp life.

===Dimming===

Only some CFLs are labeled for dimming control. Using a dimmer with a standard CFL is ineffective and can shorten bulb life and void the warranty. Dimmable CFLs are available. The dimmer switch used in conjunction with a dimmable CFL must be matched to its power consumption range; many dimmers installed for use with incandescent bulbs do not function acceptably below 40 W, whereas CFL applications commonly draw power in the range 7–20 W. Dimmable CFLs have been marketed before suitable dimmers are available. The dimming range of CFLs is usually between 20% and 90%, but many modern CFLs have a dimmable range of 2% to 100%, more akin to that of incandescent lights. There are two types of dimmable CFL on the market: Standard dimmable CFLs, and &quot;switch-dimmable&quot; CFLs. The latter use a standard light switch, and the on-board electronics chooses the light output level based on the number of times the switch is turned on and off quickly. Dimmable CFLs are not a 100% replacement for incandescent fixtures that are dimmed for &quot;mood scenes&quot; such as wall sconces in a dining area. Below the 20% limit, the lamp may remain at 20% or flicker or the starter circuitry may stop and restart. Above 80%, the bulb may operate at 100%. However, recent products have solved these problems so that they perform more like incandescent lamps. Dimmable CFLs are more expensive than standard CFLs due to the additional circuitry.

Cold-cathode CFLs can be dimmed to low levels, making them popular replacements for incandescent bulbs on dimmer circuits.

When a CFL is dimmed, its color temperature (warmth) stays the same. This is counter to incandescent light sources, where color gets redder as the light source gets dimmer. The Kruithof curve from 1934 described an empirical relationship between intensity and color temperature of visually pleasing light sources.

===Power factor===

The input stage of a CFL is a rectifier, which presents a non-linear load to the power supply and introduces harmonic distortion on the current drawn from the supply. The use of CFLs in homes has no appreciable effect on power quality, but significant quantities of them in a large facility can have an adverse effect. The power factor of CFLs does not significantly affect their energy-saving benefits for individual consumers, but their use in large numbers, such as in commercial applications or across millions of homes in a distribution system, could require infrastructure upgrades. In such cases, CFLs with low (below 30 percent) total harmonic distortion (THD) and power factors greater than 0.9 should be selected.

===Infrared signals===
Electronic devices operated by infrared remote control can interpret the infrared light emitted by CFLs as a signal; this may limit the use of CFLs near televisions, radios, remote controls, or mobile phones. Energy Star certified CFLs must meet FCC standards, and so are required to list all known incompatibilities on the package.

===Outdoor use===

CFLs are generally not designed or rated for outdoor use and some will not start in cold weather. CFLs are available with cold-weather ballasts, which may be rated to as low as −28.8 °C (−20 °F). Light output during the first few minutes of operation is limited at low temperatures before reaching full brightness. Cold-cathode CFLs will start and perform in a wide range of temperatures due to their different design.

===Starting time===
Incandescent lamps reach full brightness a fraction of a second after being switched on. , CFLs turn on within a second, but many still take time to achieve full brightness. The light color may be slightly different immediately after being turned on. Some CFLs are marketed as &quot;instant on&quot; and have no noticeable warm-up period, but others can take up to a minute to reach full brightness, or longer in very cold temperatures. Some that use a mercury amalgam can take up to three minutes to reach full output. This and the shorter life of CFLs when turned on and off for short periods may make CFLs less suitable for applications such as motion-activated lighting. Hybrid lamps, combining a halogen lamp with a CFL, are available where warm up time is unacceptable. The halogen lamp lights immediately, and is switched off once the CFL has reached full brightness.

== Health and environmental impact ==

=== General ===
According to the European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in 2008, CFLs may pose an added health risk due to the ultraviolet and blue light emitted. This radiation could aggravate symptoms in people who already suffer skin conditions that make them exceptionally sensitive to light. The light emitted by some single-envelope CFLs at distances of less than could lead to ultraviolet exposures approaching the current workplace limit set to protect workers from skin and retinal damage. However, industry sources claim the UV radiation received from CFLs is too small to contribute to skin cancer and the use of double-envelope CFLs &quot;largely or entirely&quot; mitigates any other risks.

Tests have shown that radiation exposure from CFLs is negligible at 150 centimeter distance from the source. At closer distances, comparisons show that CFLs emit less UVA (long wavelength) radiation than incandescent light bulbs. They do, however, emit higher levels of UVB (short wavelength) radiation. UVB can penetrate deep into the skin while sufficient levels of UVA can burn superficial layers. Closed (double-envelope) CFLs are shielded and emit a lower total UV radiation compared to incandescent or halogen bulbs of a similar wattage.

For the average user, UV radiation from indoor lights does not appear to be a concern. For those with skin sensitivity long term indoor exposure may be a concern, in which case they may want to use a bulb with lower UV radiation output. There seems to be more variability within bulb types than between them, but the best option is shielded CFLs.

A 2012 study comparing cellular health effects of CFL light and incandescent light found statistically significant cell damage in cultures exposed to CFL light. Spectroscopic analysis confirmed the presence of significant UVA and UVC radiation, which the study&#x27;s authors conjectured was attributable to damage in the bulbs&#x27; internal phosphor coatings. No cellular damage was observed following exposure to incandescent light of equivalent intensity. The study&#x27;s authors suggest that the ultraviolet exposure could be limited by the use of &quot;double-walled&quot; bulbs manufactured with an additional glass covering surrounding the phosphor-coated layer.

When the base of the bulb is not made to be flame-retardant, as required in the voluntary standard for CFLs, overheating of the electrical components in the bulb may create a fire hazard.

=== Mercury content ===

CFLs, like all fluorescent lamps, contain mercury as vapor inside the glass tubing. Most CFLs contain 3–5 mg per bulb, with the bulbs labeled &quot;eco-friendly&quot; containing as little as 1 mg. Because mercury is poisonous, even these small amounts are a concern for landfills and waste incinerators where the mercury from lamps may be released and contribute to air and water pollution. In the U.S., lighting manufacturer members of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) have voluntarily capped the amount of mercury used in CFLs. In the EU the same cap is required by the RoHS law.

In areas where electric power is mostly generated in coal-fired stations, replacing incandescent bulbs by CFLs actually reduces mercury emissions. This is because the reduced electric power demand, reducing in turn the amount of mercury released by coal as it is burned, more than offsets the amount of mercury released from broken and discarded CFL bulbs. In July 2008 the U.S. EPA published a data sheet stating that the net system emission of mercury for CFL lighting was lower than for incandescent lighting of comparable lumen output. This was based on the average rate of mercury emission for U.S. electricity production and average estimated escape of mercury from a CFL put into a landfill. Coal-fired plants also emit other heavy metals, sulfur, and carbon dioxide.

In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that if all 270 million CFLs sold in 2007 were sent to landfill sites, around 0.13 metric tons of mercury would be released, 0.1% of all U.S. emissions of mercury (around 104 metric tons that year).
The graph assumes that CFLs last an average of 8,000 hours regardless of manufacturer and premature breakage. In areas where coal is not used to produce energy, the emissions would be less for both types of bulb.

Special handling instructions for breakage are not printed on the packaging of household CFL bulbs in many countries. The amount of mercury released by one bulb can temporarily exceed U.S. federal guidelines for chronic exposure. &quot;Chronic&quot;, however, implies exposure for a significant time, and it remains unclear what the health risks are from short-term exposure to low levels of elemental mercury. Despite following EPA best-practice clean-up guidelines on broken CFLs, researchers were unable to remove mercury from carpet, and agitation of the carpet — such as by young children playing — created localized concentrations as high as 0.025 mg/m3 in air close to the carpet, even weeks after the initial breakage.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published best practices for cleanup of broken CFLs, and ways to avoid breakage, on its web site. It recommends airing out the room and carefully disposing of broken pieces in a jar. A Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) study of 2008 comparing clean-up methods warns that using plastic bags to store broken CFL bulbs is dangerous, because vapors well above safe levels continue to leak from the bags. The EPA and the Maine DEP recommend a sealed glass jar as the best repository for a broken bulb.

Since the end of 2018, the export, import and manufacture of CFLs within the European Union has been prohibited under the EU Mercury Regulation.

=== Recycling ===

Health and environmental concerns about mercury have prompted many jurisdictions to require spent lamps to be properly disposed of or recycled, rather than being included in the general waste stream sent to landfills. Safe disposal requires storing the bulbs unbroken until they can be processed.

In the United States, most states have adopted and currently implement the federal Universal Waste Rule (UWR). Several states, including Vermont, New Hampshire, California, Minnesota, New York, Maine, Connecticut and Rhode Island, have regulations that are more stringent than the federal UWR. Home-supply chain stores make free CFL recycling widely available.

In the European Union, CFLs are one of many products subject to the WEEE recycling scheme. The retail price includes an amount to pay for recycling, and manufacturers and importers have an obligation to collect and recycle CFLs.

According to the Northwest Compact Fluorescent Lamp Recycling Project, because household users in the U.S. Northwest have the option of disposing of these products in the same way they dispose of other solid waste, in Oregon &quot;a large majority of household CFLs are going to municipal solid waste&quot;. They also note the EPA&#x27;s estimates for the percentage of fluorescent lamps&#x27; total mercury released when they are disposed of in the following ways: municipal waste landfill 3.2%, recycling 3%, municipal waste incineration 17.55% and hazardous waste disposal 0.2%.

The first step of processing CFLs involves crushing the bulbs in a machine that uses negative pressure ventilation and a mercury-absorbing filter or cold trap to contain mercury vapor. Many municipalities are purchasing such machines. The crushed glass and metal is stored in drums, ready for shipping to recycling factories.

=== Greenhouse gases ===
In some places, such as Quebec and British Columbia in 2007, central heating for homes was provided mostly by the burning of natural gas, whereas electricity was primarily provided by hydroelectric power. An analysis of the impacts of a ban on incandescent light bulbs at that time introduced the notion that in such areas, heat generated by conventional electric light bulbs may have been significantly reducing the release of greenhouse gases from natural gas heating. Ivanco, Karney, and Waher estimated that &quot;If all homes in Quebec were required to switch from (incandescent) bulbs to CFLs, there would be an increase of almost 220,000 tonnes in CO2 emissions in the province, equivalent to the annual emissions from more than 40,000 automobiles.&quot;

== Use and adoption ==
CFLs are produced for both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) input. DC CFLs are popular for use in recreational vehicles and off-the-grid housing. Various aid agency initiatives exist in developing countries to replace kerosene lamps, which have associated health and safety hazards, with CFLs powered by batteries, solar panels or wind power generators.

Due to the potential to reduce electric consumption and pollution, various organizations have encouraged the adoption of CFLs and other efficient lighting. Efforts range from publicity to encourage awareness, to direct handouts of CFLs to the public. Some electric utilities and local governments have subsidized CFLs or provided them free to customers as a means to reduce electric demand; and so delay further investments in generation.

In the United States, the &quot;Program for the Evaluation and Analysis of Residential Lighting&quot; (PEARL) was created to be a watchdog program. PEARL has evaluated the performance and Energy Star compliance of more than 150 models of CFL bulbs.

The UN Environment Programme (UNEP)/Global Environment Facility (GEF) initiative has developed &quot;The Global Efficient Partnership Program&quot;, which focuses on country-led policies and approaches to enable the implementation of energy-efficient lighting, including CFLs, quickly and cost-effectively in developing and emerging countries.

In the United States and Canada, the Energy Star program labels lamps that meet a set of standards for efficiency, starting time, life expectancy, color, and consistency of performance. The intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns due to variable quality of products. Those CFLs with a recent Energy Star certification start in less than one second and do not flicker. &quot;Energy Star Light Bulbs for Consumers&quot; is a resource for finding and comparing Energy Star qualified lamps. There is ongoing work in improving the &quot;quality&quot; (color rendering index) of the light.

In the United States, new standards proposed by the United States Department of Energy could result in LED lamps replacing CFLs. In the opinion of Noah Horowitz of the Natural Resources Defense Council, most CFL bulbs would not meet the standards.

In the United Kingdom, a similar program is run by the Energy Saving Trust to identify lighting products that meet energy conservation and performance guidelines.

The G24 (624Q2) and GU24 lamp fitting socket systems were designed to replace the traditional lamp sockets, so that incandescent bulbs are not installed in fixtures intended for energy efficient lamps only.

<doc id="1201556" wikidata="Q275150" url="?curid=1201556" title="Rectus abdominis muscle">
<text>The rectus abdominis muscle, () also known as the &quot;abdominal muscle&quot; or simply the &quot;abs&quot;, is a pair of segmented skeletal muscle on the ventral aspect of a person&#x27;s abdomen (or &quot;midriff&quot;). The paired muscle is separated at the midline by a band of dense connective tissue called the linea alba, and the connective tissue defining each lateral margin of the rectus abdominus is the linea semilunaris. The muscle extends from the pubic symphysis, pubic crest and pubic tubercle inferiorly, to the xiphoid process and costal cartilages of the 5th–7th ribs superiorly.

The rectus abdominis muscle is contained in the rectus sheath, which consists of the aponeuroses of the lateral abdominal muscles. Each rectus abdominus is traversed by bands of connective tissue called the tendinous intersections, which interrupt it into distinct muscle bellies. In people with low body fat, these muscle bellies can be viewed externally in sets from as few as two to as many as twelve, although six is the most common.

==Structure==
The rectus abdominis is a very long flat muscle, which extends along the whole length of the front of the abdomen, and is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the linea alba. Tendinous intersections (intersectiones tendineae) further subdivide each rectus abdominis muscle into a series of smaller muscle bellies. Tensing of the rectus abdominis causes the muscle to expand between each tendinous intersection.

The upper portion, attached principally to the cartilage of the fifth rib, usually has some fibers of insertion into the anterior extremity of the rib itself.

===Size===

It is typically around 10 mm thick, although, some athletes can have a rectus up to 20 mm thick.
Typical volume is around 300 cm3 in non-active individuals and 500 cm3 in athletes.

===Blood supply===
The rectus abdominis has many sources of arterial blood supply. Classification of the vascular anatomy of muscles: First, the inferior epigastric artery and vein (or veins) run superiorly on the posterior surface of the rectus abdominis, enter the rectus fascia at the arcuate line, and serve the lower part of the muscle. Second, the superior epigastric artery, a terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery, supplies blood to the upper portion. Finally, numerous small segmental contributions come from the lower six intercostal arteries as well.

===Nerve supply===
The muscles are innervated by thoraco-abdominal nerves, these are continuations of the T7-T11 intercostal nerves and pierce the anterior layer of the rectus sheath. Sensory supply is from the 7-12 thoracic nerves.

===Variation===
The sternalis muscle may be a variant form of the pectoralis major or the rectus abdominis. Some fibers are occasionally connected with the costoxiphoid ligaments, and the side of the xiphoid process.

==Function==
The rectus abdominis is an important postural muscle. It is responsible for flexing the lumbar spine, as when doing a crunch. The rib cage is brought up to where the pelvis is when the pelvis is fixed, or the pelvis can be brought towards the rib cage (posterior pelvic tilt) when the rib cage is fixed, such as in a leg-hip raise. The two can also be brought together simultaneously when neither is fixed in space.

The rectus abdominis assists with breathing and plays an important role in respiration when forcefully exhaling, as seen after exercise as well as in conditions where exhalation is difficult such as emphysema. It also helps in keeping the internal organs intact and in creating intra-abdominal pressure, such as when exercising or lifting heavy weights, during forceful defecation or parturition (childbirth).

==Clinical significance==
An abdominal muscle strain, also called a pulled abdominal muscle, is an injury to one of the muscles of the abdominal wall. A muscle strain occurs when the muscle is stretched too far. When this occurs the muscle fibers are torn. Most commonly, a strain causes microscopic tears within the muscle, but occasionally, in severe injuries, the muscle can rupture from its attachment.

A rectus sheath hematoma is an accumulation of blood in the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle. It causes abdominal pain with or without a mass. The hematoma may be caused by either rupture of the epigastric artery or by a muscular tear. Causes of this include anticoagulation, coughing, pregnancy, abdominal surgery and trauma. With an ageing population and the widespread use of anticoagulant medications, there is evidence that this historically benign condition is becoming more common and more serious.

On abdominal examination, people may have a positive Carnett&#x27;s sign.

Most hematomas resolve without treatment, but they may take several months to resolve.

==Other animals==
The rectus abdominis is similar in most vertebrates. The most obvious difference between animal and human abdominal musculature is that in animals, there are a different number of tendinous intersections.

<doc id="1201560" wikidata="Q4666935" url="?curid=1201560" title="Aberdeen IronBirds">
<text>The Aberdeen IronBirds are a Minor League Baseball team based in the city of Aberdeen in Harford County, Maryland. They are the High-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles and compete in the South Atlantic League. They were previously members of the New York–Penn League from 1977 to 2020, and of the High-A East in 2021.

The team is owned by Attain Sports with retired Orioles player Cal Ripken Jr maintaining a minority stake in the team after having purchased the team, then known as the Utica Blue Sox, and moved them to his hometown of Aberdeen in time for the 2002 season. The IronBirds play their home games at Leidos Field at Ripken Stadium, which is visible from I-95. On August 16, 2006, the IronBirds played host to the New York–Penn League All-Star Game. They also hosted the New York-Penn League All-Star Game on August 18, 2015. Leidos Field at Ripken Stadium was also used for the Cal Ripken World Series in 2003 and 2004, forcing the team to go on extended road trips, 20 or more games, during the youth competition. The Cal Ripken World Series moved across the street to Cal Sr.&#x27;s Yard in 2005.

The name &quot;IronBirds&quot; was chosen for two reasons: Cal Ripken&#x27;s &quot;Ironman&quot; streak of 2,632 consecutive baseball games played and the team&#x27;s affiliation with the Orioles (the Baltimore team is often referred to as &quot;The Birds&quot;). The former team logo featured a silver airplane marked with Ripken&#x27;s number 8, which also refers to the nearby Aberdeen Proving Ground U.S. Army installation. The team mascots are gray birds named Ferrous and Ripcord.

The record of most RBIs in a single month was set by Robbie Widlansky in July 2008. On August 26, 2013, Conor Bierfeldt hit his 12th home run of the season, setting a new IronBirds single-season record. He broke the previous record held by David Anderson set in the 2010 season. On September 2, 2013, The IronBirds clinched their first McNamara Division Title.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the IronBirds were organized into the 12-team High-A East. In 2022, the High-A East became known as the South Atlantic League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

The IronBirds&#x27; 2012 and 2013 seasons were the subject of a book written by the team&#x27;s former clubhouse attendant, Greg Larson. &quot;Clubbie: A Minor League Baseball Memoir&quot; was released in 2021.

In October 2024, Cal Ripken Jr. and his brother Billy Ripken sold their majority stake to Attain Sports Partners, owners of the Chesapeake Baysox, the Orioles’ Double-A affiliate, and the Frederick Keys of the MLB Draft League.

==Playoffs==
*2013 season: Lost to Tri-City 2–0 in semifinals.

<text>Philip Smith (born 1952) is an American classical trumpet player. He is former Principal Trumpet with the New York Philharmonic and played with the orchestra from 1978 to 2014. Smith, born in the United Kingdom, is from a Salvation Army background. He assumed the co-principal position in the New York Philharmonic in June 1978 and the principal position in 1988. He also is a supporter of brass bands, performing with various groups of distinction.

In 2013, Smith was announced as the William F. and Pamela P. Prokasy Professor of trumpet at the University of Georgia, where he will teach alongside Brandon Craswell. Before Smith, this position had been occupied by Fred Mills, former trumpeter with the Canadian Brass, and David Bilger, Principal Trumpet of the Philadelphia Orchestra.

==Education==
Smith began cornet lessons at the age of 8 under his father, cornet virtuoso Derek Smith, who was a renowned cornet player in his own right. Smith entered the Juilliard School in 1970, where he was introduced to orchestral playing and studied under teachers Edward Treutel and William Vacchiano. While in his final year at Juilliard, Smith was accepted as Fourth Trumpet of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Sir Georg Solti. For three years, Smith performed alongside Principal Trumpet Adolph Herseth.

<text>Philip Smith VC (1829 – 16 January 1906) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

He was 26 years old, and a corporal in the 17th Regiment (later the Leicestershire Regiment), British Army during the Siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

For repeatedly going out in the front of the advanced trenches against the Great Redan, on the 18th June, 1855, under a very heavy fire, after the column had retired from the assault, and bringing in wounded comrades.

==Further information==
Having achieved the rank of lance sergeant, he was later reduced to the ranks and when discharged he was a private. He died at Harolds Cross, Dublin on 16 January 1906 and was buried at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of the Royal Leicestershire Regiment now housed in the Newarke Houses Museum, Leicester, England.

<doc id="1201591" wikidata="Q1329946" url="?curid=1201591" title="Interior architecture">
<text>Interior architecture is the design of a building or shelter from inside out, or the design of a new interior for a type of home that can be fixed. It can refer to the initial design and plan used for a building&#x27;s interior, to that interior&#x27;s later redesign made to accommodate a changed purpose, or to the significant revision of an original design for the adaptive reuse of the shell of the building concerned. The latter is often part of sustainable architecture practices, whereby resources are conserved by &quot;recycling&quot; a structure through adaptive redesign.

Generally referred to as the spatial art of environmental design, interior architecture also refers to the process by which the interiors of buildings are designed to address all aspects of the human use of their structural spaces. Put simply, interior architecture is the design of an interior in architectural terms.

Interior architecture may refer to:
* the art and science of designing and erecting buildings and their interiors, along with other related physical features, by a licensed architect.
* the practice of an interior architect, where architecture means to offer or render professional services in connection with the design and construction of a building&#x27;s interior that has as its principal purpose relating interiors&#x27; design to human occupancy or use.
* a general term to describe building interiors and related physical features.
* a style or method of design and construction for a building&#x27;s interiors and related physical features.
* the practice engaging work on already existing interior environments, where adaptive re-use and a knowledge of architectural strategies are necessary for re-designing existing space.

==Evolution==
===Adaptive reuse===


Although the original spatial hierarchy of a building is always established by its first architect, subsequent iterations of the interior may not be, and for obvious reasons, older structures are often modified by designers of a different generation according to society’s changing needs as our cities evolve. This process often re-semanticizes the building as a consequence, and is predicated on the notion that buildings can never really be complete and unalterable.

An altered building may look the same on the exterior, but its interior may be completely different spatially. The interior architect must therefore be sensitive not only to the place of the building in its physical and socio-political context, but to the temporal requirements of changing owners and users. In this sense, if the building has “good bones” the original architectural idea is therefore the first iteration of an internal spatial hierarchy for that structure, after which others are bound to follow

Cities are now dense with such buildings, perhaps originally built as banks that are now restaurants, perhaps industrial mills 
that are now loft apartments, or even railway stations that have become art galleries. In each case the collective memory of the shape and character of the city is generally held to be more desirable than the possibility of a new building on the same site, although clearly economic forces apply. It is also possible to speculate that there might well be further new interiors for these structures in future years, but for each alteration the technical and technological expertise of the era will determine the extent to which the building is modified in its building life cycle.

Certain structure&#x27;s interiors remain unaltered over time due to historic preservation, unchanged use, or financial limitations. Nevertheless, most buildings have only three possible long-range internal futures: First, designated significantly important to maintain visually unchanged, only accommodating unseen modern utilities, access, and structural stabilization, and restoration needs. Second, demolished to make way for a new building on the same site, or abandoned, becoming ruins. Finally, redesigned and altered to accommodate new uses.

There are many different degrees of alteration – a minor one to enable the building to conform to new legal codes is likely to prolong the first (or indeed later) iteration of interior space, but a major alteration, such as the retention of only the facade, is to all intents and purposes a new building. All possibilities within and between the two extremes are the domain of the interior architect.

If the practice of architecture is concerned with the art and science of new building, then the practice of Interior architecture is concerned with the alteration of existing buildings for new uses.

=== Sustainability ===
A critical part in the evolution of interior architecture and design is the central theme of sustainability and consciously thinking of the environment and the materials being sourced- energy use, site selection, water usage, and material selection (Leigh Bacon). This sub-category of Interior Architecture focuses on finding creative and holistic ways of building new or retro fitting existing structures that have little to no impact on the environment. The eco-friendly movement became an important issue around the 1970s when the major energy crisis struck, making individuals aware of their contributions and what can be done to help lighten the impacts (BStone). Sustainability in Interior Architecture has really taken off in the last few decades with the help and advancements of technology, discovering new materials and efficient concepts that still lend the aesthetically pleasing aspect of a design. In past years, when it came to eco-design it had a stale and lack of luxury, elegance, and overall design; which inevitably received the reputation of being a &quot;hippies&quot; style or way of living. This is far from the case today with the overall known importance of being environmentally responsible, having an abundant amount of material options, and wanting to withhold an aesthetic design. Sustainable design is now a preferred and desired way of thinking and building that has and will be an ever-expanding and growing field.
Some people confuse interior architecture with interior design. Because interior renovation will touch the change of the internal structure of the house, ceiling construction, circuit configuration and partition walls, etc., such work related to the structure of the house, of course, also includes renovation of wallpaper posting, furniture settings, lighting, etc. It is worth noting The thing is, the decoration construction team must be approved by the established interior design company to guarantee.
==Earnings==

===Statistics===
In the United States, median annual wages of wage-and-salary architects were $70,320 in May 2008. The middle 50 percent earned between $53,480 and $91,870. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $41,320, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $119,220. Those just starting their internships can expect to earn considerably less.

Earnings of partners in established architectural firms may fluctuate because of changing business conditions. Some architects may have difficulty establishing their own practices and may go through a period when their expenses are greater than their income, requiring substantial financial resources.

Many firms pay tuition and fees toward continuing education requirements for their employees.

==Education==

===Purpose===
Education in interior architecture should include the study of historic architectural and interior decoration styles, building codes and safety, preserving and restoring old buildings, drawing plans of original designs, and building physical and virtual (computer-based) models. The field of interior architecture has a lot in common with interior design and decorating; however, it typically focuses on architecture and construction. Students of both fields learn to design comfortable, safe, and useful indoor spaces, from downtown penthouses to high school classrooms. A student of interior architecture will learn about much more than artistic concerns, such as choosing which style of furnishings works well in an open, loft-like apartment. Study will also include information on technical issues, such as seismic retrofitting (making old buildings safe from earthquakes).

===Degree programs===
Interior architecture stands at the intersection of architecture, design of the built environment, and conservation. Interior architecture programs address the design issues intrinsic to the re-use and transformation of existing structures through both an innovative and progressive approach.

The National Center for Education Statistics states that the definition of a degree program in interior architecture is: &quot;A program that prepares individuals to apply architectural principles in the design of structural interiors for living, recreational, and business purposes and to function as professional interior architects. Study includes instruction in architecture, occupational and safety standards, structural systems design, heating and cooling systems design, interior design, specific end-use applications, and professional responsibilities and standards.&quot;

In addition to earning a degree in interior architecture, general licensure is required to work within the United States and some states have further licensing requirements. In many European countries and in Australia the use of the title &quot;Interior Architect&quot; is legally regulated. This means that a practicing professional cannot use the title of &quot;Interior Architect&quot; unless they complete the requirements for becoming a registered or licensed architect as well as completing a degree program.

===Difference between an Interior Architect and Designer===
Interior architects focus on building interiors, space planning, and exteriors. This included planning a space to be functional, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing. They notate the appearance of the building, safety, and usability of the users in the building. They will create site plans, building sections, energy calculations, exterior elevations, window &amp; door schedules, and more.

An Interior designer focuses more on the furnishings that will be included in the space and the decorations associated with the interior. This is not to be confused with an Interior decorator who purely focuses on design aesthetics and furnishings. They will select furniture, soft goods, drapery &amp; window coverings, and wall coverings. They focus on the harmony felt in a space which relates to room placement, size, and layout.

Both professions have a middle gray area where both perform the same tasks. This includes the selection of interior finishes, creating drawings of interior elevations/details, and space planning around furniture placement.

=== Associations of Interior Architects and Designers ===
Experienced and trained Interior architecture and Interior design professionals are often represented by national, European or international professional organizations and federations. These associations represent and advocate on behalf of its members to ensure that the expertise of the built environment professionals is recognized and respected.

European Council of Interior Architects (ECIA) is the representative body for the European professional organisations in Interior Architecture and Design. Founded in 1992, ECIA currently represents 22 members-national organisations, with approximately 18000 professionals Interior Architects/Designers.

==Styles==

===Gothic Architecture===
Gothic Architecture was introduced at the beginning of the 12th century. It was used to bring heaven to Earth essentially. According to Abbot Suger, earthly light contained divine light, and the church was responsible for making this concept concrete through the church&#x27;s architecture. The design concept combined Byzantine, Romanesque, and Islamic architecture styles, making the style so eccentric and internationally spread. Popular colors such as ruby, gold, forest green, and plum were used in this period.

The famous paintings used as decoration were Unicorn paintings. These paintings represented the importance of marriage and happiness within the union. They were also stated to promote fertility for women and the marriage&#x27;s overall success. The most recognized sculpture of the gothic era is gargoyles. These carved/formed grotesques were used to lead water off roofs away from the sides of buildings. They removed the problem of rainwater damaging and eroding the mortar. They also were prominent in religion at the time. Gargoyles were used as a defense on buildings against demons.

The favored architectural features were pointed gothic arches, stained glass windows, and tracery. Pointed Gothic arches served a purpose for both decoration and structural purposes. For decorative reasoning, it is theorized that this idea was inspired by Islamic architecture. Structurally, it relieved stress from other elements in the building and directed most of the weight downwards. This helped support taller and thinner walls hence the immense structures present in this time. Stained glass windows were associated with High Gothic cathedrals. They reflected many colors of light and signified the Holy Spirit. For some, the artwork displayed was the only way they learned stories in the Bible as they could not read. Lastly, tracery is seen as bar or ribs used around openings such as windows.

===Victorian Architecture===
This era was named after Queen Victoria. Victorian architecture featured gothic features such as spires, buttresses, and pointed arches. The era began in the 1830s as design went through the Gothic Revival and transitioned into the Victorian era, which ended around 1901 with Queen Victoria&#x27;s death.

Buildings were changed due to the creation of the architect profession and the now easier access to materials. Railways introduced access to materials, and the building production time decreased. Other notable progressions during this time were iron-framed construction, plate glass, terracotta, and polished granite.

Victorian architecture seems to be the opposite of today&#x27;s popular minimalistic design style. Victorian design is referred to as maximalist, overwhelming, and eccentric. Wealth became a cultural value that was demonstrated through design. This ostentatious display of ornamentation and detailing in furniture was to display class. Not only was this seen within the architecture and furniture, but it also appeared through graphic design and clothing. A bare room was equivalent to a lack of taste and wealth. The unique features that showcase the Victorian era are layered drapery, patterned wallpaper, and carved furniture. This era was during the Industrial Revolution, and these new materials were used in the interior designs.

===Modern Architecture===
Modern Architecture, also known as modernist architecture, is created off the invention of new technologies within construction. This would include reinforced concrete, steel frames, curtain walls, and ribbon window. Some of its most notable features are the elimination of ornamentation and the minimalist aspects of the design. This style of architecture focuses on improving buildings&#x27; functionality, using new materials, and moving away from common structural shapes such as square or rectangular buildings.

During World War II, research created new products and applications between 1940 and 1960. There were heavy influences of Scandinavian design inspired by Arne Jacobsen Scandinavia. Other notable pioneers of this movement were Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier. This transformed modern furniture from feeling cold and austere to warm and inviting. This was done using many textures such as wood, hemp, and leather and soft hues of popular colors. Also, within the design itself, Scandinavian design focused on the functionality and simplicity of furniture. This includes mid-century modernism, modernism, and contemporary. Most attraction to these styles would be to those born during this period, but since the recent reinvention of these design styles, it has become more widespread in current architecture and interior design.

As of current, modern architecture is taking a turn toward a more abstract-looking design, but this showcases how it was before this progression. These design styles have influenced modern architects and designers by providing alternatives to modern design&#x27;s common problem of feeling cold, too simple, and uninviting. Introducing more textures, warmer colors, and curvilinear lines have transformed modern architecture into a more usable style. It also influences incorporating sustainable materials into design in the 21st century. We have reinvented the style with sustainable materials and finishes without altering the original basis.

These styles have influenced the design process by emphasizing art usage to highlight a room rather than many embellishments. This includes but is not limited to paintings, sculptures, and wallpapers in almost every room to capture your eye. It also captures the importance of craftsmanship by highlighting how things are made and leaving it shown in rooms. This includes wood beams, room framework, and tiling, for example.

<doc id="1201595" wikidata="Q2076869" url="?curid=1201595" title="Yu-Gi-Oh! R">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written by Akira Itō, based on Kazuki Takahashi&#x27;s &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; manga. The series, which is a spin-off to the original manga, was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;V Jump&quot; magazine between April 2004 and December 2007, with its chapters collected in five volumes. It was published in North America by Viz Media.

==Plot==
&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh R&quot; takes place following Yugi Mutou&#x27;s victory in the Battle City tournament. Yako Tenma, the protégé and adopted son of Maximillion Pegasus, decides to avenge his teacher&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Yugi, believing him to be responsible for Pegasus&#x27; alleged death. After taking over KaibaCorp while Seto Kaiba is in the United States, Tenma kidnaps Anzu Mazaki, prompting Yugi and his friend Katsuya Jonouchi to face Tenma&#x27;s RA Project and the duel professors. Seto Kaiba and his brother Mokuba also come to the scene to rescue the company.

==Characters==

Many of the characters that are exclusive to &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! R&quot; have names that are also Intel codenames. Intel codenames in turn are frequently taken from names of cities and towns near Intel factories in Oregon, Washington, and other locations.
:The protégé and adopted son (often mistaken, or mistranslated as younger brother) of Maximillion Pegasus (Pegasus J. Crawford in the Japanese version) who wants revenge for Pegasus&#x27; defeat.
:The first professor. Yugi defeats him. He is named after the Deschutes River and Deschutes County, Oregon. &quot;Deschutes&quot; is also a pre-release codename for the 333 MHz P6 Intel Pentium II chip.
:The second professor, who plays a vampire-themed deck. Yugi defeats her. She is named after Tillamook, Oregon. &quot;Tillamook&quot; is also a pre-release codename for the Embedded 266 MHz Intel Pentium MMX chip.
:The third professor, who has such bad luck. Jonouchi defeats him. He is named after Klamath Falls, Oregon. &quot;Klamath&quot; is also a pre-release codename for the 300 MHz Intel Pentium II chip.
:The fourth professor, who plays a machine-themed deck. Yugi defeats him. &quot;Dixon&quot; is also a pre-release codename for the 333 MHz 1.6V Intel Pentium II chip. His key card Commander Covington (督戦官コヴィントン &quot;Tokusenkan Covinton&quot;) originates from &quot;Covington&quot; codenamed for the 266 MHz P6 Intel Pentium II chip.
:The fifth professor, who plays a mutant-themed deck. Jonouchi defeats him. He is named after the Coppermine River in Oregon. The name of that river was used as a codename for the 866 MHz Flip Chip Pin Grid Array (FCPGA) Pentium III (P3-850) microprocessor, which was released by Intel.
:The sixth professor, who is an old woman in a wheelchair that plays a forest-themed deck. Yugi defeats her. &quot;Maico&quot; is an alternate romanization of the name &quot;Maiko&quot;, but it also refers to a brand of motorcycle. Kato Engineering is a company associated with motorcycles. The name also originates from the &quot;KatMai&quot; chip.
:Yako Tenma&#x27;s older brother (although only slightly older, since they are identical twins). Gekko wants to stop the RA project. He uses an elf deck. &quot;Gekko&quot; is the name of the microprocessor chip in the GameCube.
:Mendo, the seventh professor, uses an insect deck. Jonouchi defeats him. &quot;Mendocino&quot; is also a pre-release codename for the 300 MHz P6 Intel Pentium II Centrino chip.
:Willa, the eighth professor, plays a White Horns Dragon deck. Kaiba defeats him. Willamette is a river in Oregon and a codename for Intel&#x27;s 1.5 GHz P7 Pentium IV.
:Tedd, the ninth professor, duels Gekko. Gekko defeats Tedd. Uses a Beast Deck. Banias is the codename for Intel&#x27;s first x86 Pentium M chip.
:Reiko, the tenth professor, duels Jonouchi. Jonouchi defeats Reiko. Uses a Chess/Deck Destruction Deck. Kitamori means northwood in Japanese. &quot;Northwood&quot; was the codename for the 130 nm version of Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4 microprocessor.
:Scott is the eleventh professor, and another of Pegasus&#x27; adopted sons. Yugi defeats Depre. He duels against Yugi using a Universe Deck. &quot;Prescott&quot; was the codename for the 90 nm version of Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4 microprocessor.
:Richie is the twelfth professor, and another of Pegasus&#x27; adopted sons. He duels Gekkou and wins. &quot;Merced&quot; was the codename for Itanium, an IA-64 microprocessor developed jointly by Intel and Hewlett-Packard.
:Cedar is the thirteenth professor and, although he is not actually named in the actual manga, dispatched almost offhandedly in a single panel by Yugi&#x27;s Osiris the Heaven Dragon (Slifer the Sky Dragon in the English version), Cedar is identified in a sketch in the 4th volume of the collected manga. &quot;Cedar Mill&quot; was the codename for the 65 nm version of Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4 microprocessor. It is also a play on &quot;Cedar Mills&quot;, which is an area in Beaverton, Oregon.
:Appears in a special chapter of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! R&quot;. Momono tries to take over the Kame Game Shop owned by Sugoroku Mutou. His key card originates from &quot;Tualatin&quot; codename for the 1.266 GHz Flip Chip Pin Grid Array (FCPGA2) Pentium III (P3-850) microprocessor, which was released by Intel.

<doc id="1201602" wikidata="Q7166195" url="?curid=1201602" title="Pep rally">
<text>A pep rally, pep assembly or pep session is a gathering of people, typically students of middle school, high school, and college age, before a school sporting event. The purpose of such a gathering is to encourage school spirit and to support members of the team. This is often done by wearing school colors or chanting school cheers. It is generally seen as an American and Canadian phenomenon, used to create hype before a sporting event. 

A pep rally often occurs before homecoming, prom, or even regional or national games for the school. It is usually held inside a school gym or other large sporting arena in the area. In an attempt to boost enthusiasm before an event, pep rallies are usually very loud and energetic. They are used to encourage the team, enhance their spirits, and help them gain the confidence to perform their best. A pep rally helps a school team to know that they have their schools absolute support.

Often, businesses or speakers such a town mayor, law enforcement, or motivational speaker will come to promote their business or event happening in their field. A pep rally may also be held after a sporting event, perhaps to celebrate the success or win of a championship game. 

During a pep rally, school sporting teams will make an appearance or participate in student-engaging activities. The school football team or cheerleaders may partner up to perform a dance or skit to make the audience laugh. These school sporting teams often wear their jerseys or uniforms to proudly represent the team they are a part of. Fun games to create laughter and joy during the pep rally take place to create a fun, enjoyable environment. 

Pep rallies may also include flashy lights such as a strobe light or disco lights to draw the attention of the crowd. The students in attendance may be given t-shirts, pom poms, air horns, or any type of school promotional item to wave or use during the pep rally.

These school gathering can allow students feel included, have a sense of belonging, and even feel appreciated.

<text>Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC; ), formerly Public Works and Government Services Canada, is the department of the Government of Canada with responsibility for the government&#x27;s internal servicing and administration.

The department is responsible for the procurement for other government departments and serves as the central purchasing agent, real property manager, treasurer, accountant, pay and pension administrator, integrity adviser and linguistic authority; it was recognized in 2018 as one of Canada&#x27;s Best Diversity Employers. It is also the custodian of a large real estate portfolio and as well infrastructure such as bridges, dams and highways.

The department is responsible to Parliament through the minister of public services and procurement and receiver general for Canada – presently Jean-Yves Duclos. Day-to-day operations and leadership of the department is overseen by the deputy minister, a senior civil servant.

<text>Idris Davies (6 January 1905 – 6 April 1953) was a Welsh poet. Born in Rhymney, near Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales, he became a poet, originally writing in Welsh, but later writing exclusively in English.

Davies was the only poet to cover the significant political events of the early 20th century in the South Wales Valleys and the South Wales Coalfield, which was informed from his experience of having worked at the coalface. He is best known for the verses &quot;Bells of Rhymney&quot;, from his 1938 &quot;Gwalia Deserta&quot; (meaning literally &quot;Wasteland of Wales&quot;), which were adapted into a popular folk song.

==Early life and education==
Davies was born at 16 Field Street, Rhymney, Monmouthshire, the Welsh-speaking son of colliery chief winderman (mine lift operator) Evan Davies and his wife Elizabeth Ann. He learned English at school. After leaving school at the age of fourteen, for the next seven years Davies worked underground as a miner in the nearby McLaren Pit at Abertysswg and later at the Maerdy Pit in Pontlottyn.

In the autumn of 1925, Davies enrolled in three series of evening classes. First he enrolled in continuation classes in English, arithmetic, drawing and science. Then he enrolled in commercial classes in English and bookkeeping, the latter for a Royal Society of Arts examination, which he passed at elementary level. Finally he enrolled, albeit without any conviction, in another set of evening classes in arithmetic and English grammar, during which he became interested in English literature, in particular the Romantics. He rejected Welsh literature outright because of his accusation of what &#x27;the parsons&#x27;, as he called them, had done to it. 

At the time, interest in the Labour Party was at &#x27;white heat&#x27;. Consequently, Davies became extremely interested in politics, attending a series of weekly lectures in the local Workmen&#x27;s Library on the application of Marxism to recent economic history which was taught by a graduate of Ruskin College, Oxford. As elsewhere, the political temperature in Rhymney rose considerably in the winter of 1925. However, before the year was out Davies experienced a serious accident underground, his second accident, as a result of which he lost a little finger. In the following year the much-vaunted General Strike of 1926 occurred, the local pit closed and he became unemployed. He spent the next four years following what he called &#x27;the long and lonely self-tuition game&#x27;.

==Teaching career==
In 1929, having passed the Oxford Local Examination at his second attempt, Davies became a pupil-teacher, an honorary post, in his old school, working with his old headmaster. The following year a new teacher training course started at Loughborough College. He enrolled in the September with handicraft as his main subject. However, it became clear that he didn&#x27;t have any aptitude for handicraft. Consequently, it was decided that he should also enrol on a course in advanced English literature that was held two days a week at the nearby University of Nottingham and that he should not have one main subject, but two, English and History. He passed the course at advanced level and qualified as a teacher in August 1932.

Davies started teaching in that year in &quot;Laysterne Junior Mixed Primary School&quot; in Hoxton in Hackney, London, during which he became friends with Dylan Thomas. Also he became acquainted with a group of Welsh litterateurs who frequented &quot;Griff&#x27;s Bookshop&quot;, a Welsh bookshop in Cecil Court, off Charing Cross Road, which was kept by the Griffiths brothers.

After the end of the Second World War, Davies was transferred to &quot;Wordsworth School&quot; (which perhaps was in Stoke Newington, London). However, he had become nostalgic for Wales. Consequently, in 1947, with the help of a local councillor, he returned to the Rhymney Valley to teach at the junior school in &quot;Cwmsyfiog Schools&quot;, New Tredegar. He taught there until 1951 when the abdominal cancer that was to cost him his life began. He died, aged 48, at his mother&#x27;s house at 7, Victoria Road, Rhymney on Easter Monday, 6 April 1953 and was buried in Rhymney Public Cemetery.

==Poetry==
Davies was introduced to poetry in the autumn of 1925, after having enrolled in a set of evening classes in arithmetic and English grammar, following which, at the behest of the teacher, he bought a book of poetry by Keats. Then, in the spring, he read Shelley, to whom a friend had introduced him and borrowed a book of poems from him to read, which he followed by reading Wordsworth. 

Davies had his first book &quot;Gwalia Deserta&quot; published in 1938. His work had earlier appeared in the &quot;Western Mail&quot;, the &quot;Merthyr Express&quot;, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, the &quot;Left Review&quot; and &quot;Comment&quot; (a weekly periodical of poetry, criticism and short stories, edited by Victor Neuburg and Sheila Macleod).

Davies had his second book, an anthology of poems, published (by Faber &amp; Faber) in 1945, the poems having been chosen by T. S. Eliot. Eliot thought that Davies&#x27; poems had a claim to permanence, describing them as &quot;the best poetic document I know about a particular epoch in a particular place&quot;.

Davies&#x27; final volume, &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, was published shortly before his death. Around this time Dylan Thomas wrote him a surprisingly touching letter. Thomas had read &quot;Bells of Rhymney&quot; as part of a Saint David&#x27;s Day radio broadcast, but told Davies that he did not feel the poem was particularly representative of Davies&#x27; work, as it was &quot;not angry enough&quot;.

==Legacy==

There are memorial plaques to Davies at Victoria Road and at the town library.

After his death over two hundred of his manuscript poems and a short verse-play, together with the typescripts of his comprehensive wartime diaries, were deposited at the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth. Later, more of his unpublished poems and most of his prose – an unfinished novel, essays, lecture notes and some of his letters – were found. Some of this later material appeared posthumously in &quot;The Collected Poems of Idris Davies&quot; (1972); &quot;Idris Davies&quot; (1972), and &quot;Argo Record No. ZPL.1181: Idris Davies&quot; (1972).

There is a modern memorial sculpture for Davies in Rhymney, with an inscription reading &quot;When April came to Rhymney with shower and sun and shower&quot; – the opening line of his poem &quot;Rhymney&quot;.

In September 2006 a refurbished grave memorial was unveiled, at a re-dedication service, in the town&#x27;s cemetery.

==Views==
The editor&#x27;s frontispiece from &quot;Gwalia Deserta&quot; provides a useful summary of Davies&#x27; outlook.

In a diary entry Davies wrote: &quot;I am a socialist. That is why I want as much beauty as possible in our everyday lives, and so I am an enemy of pseudo-poetry and pseudo-art of all kinds. Too many &#x27;poets of the Left&#x27;, as they call themselves, are badly in need of instruction as to the difference between poetry and propaganda ... These people should read William Blake on Imagination until they show signs of understanding him. Then the air will be clear again, and the land be, if not full of, fit for song.&quot;

== Work ==
Davies&#x27; first published volume was the 1938 extended poetical work &quot;Gwalia Deserta&quot;. The verses it contained were inspired partly by such mining disasters as that at Marine Colliery at Cwm near Ebbw Vale in 1927, and by the failure of the 1926 UK General Strike, the Great Depression in the United Kingdom and their combined effects on the South Wales valleys.

The &quot;Bells of Rhymney&quot; verses, perhaps Davies&#x27; most widely known work, appear as Part XV of the book. The stanzas follow the pattern of the well known nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;. In the late 1950s the verses were adapted into a folk song by Pete Seeger and became a folk rock standard. The song, entitled &quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot;, has been covered by many others since. More recently some of the other stanzas from Davies&#x27; &quot;Gwalia Deserta&quot; have also been set to music by Welsh performer Max Boyce as the song &quot;When We Walked to Merthyr Tydfil in the Moonlight Long Ago&quot;.

In February 2010 Davies&#x27; work was mentioned, by Conservative MP David Davies and Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams, in a Parliamentary debate concerning health-care in Wales.

The 2017 album &quot;Every Valley&quot;, by London-based alternative band Public Service Broadcasting, includes a version of &quot;Gwalia Deserta XXXVI&quot; set to music and re-titled &quot;Turn No More&quot;. It is sung by Manic Street Preachers&#x27; singer James Dean Bradfield.

<doc id="1201619" wikidata="Q265163" url="?curid=1201619" title="Subaru Justy">
<text>The Subaru Justy is a subcompact hatchback manufactured and marketed by Subaru for model years 1984-1994. The company has marketed a rebadged variant Daihatsu Boon (second generation), at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show with a 1.0 or 1.2-litre straight-three engine, front/four wheel drive, electronically controlled continuously variable transaxle, or a 5-speed manual transaxle. For the 2010 model year, the Justy was replaced with the Subaru Trezia. The Justy nameplate was revived in November 2016 as a rebadged Toyota Tank and its twin counterpart the Toyota Roomy and Daihatsu Thor.


==First generation==
Originally designed and manufactured in Japan, the Justy was introduced in Japan for model year 1984, as a widened and stretched version of the Rex kei car, using the same doors and other pressings. To Japanese buyers, it was longer and wider and had an engine larger than kei car dimension regulations outlined, while keeping the engine displacement just under 1000 cc to minimize the annual road tax obligation. The electronically controlled, continuously variable &quot;ECVT&quot; transmission was introduced in February 1987. Production of this model was limited to 500 per month due to limited supplies of steel bands from Van Doorne transmission, but as the Justy ECVT was not an unqualified success this was not a real problem. When supplies later increased, Subaru chose to use them for the smaller Rex instead. The Justy was originally available with a low or a high roof, the flat roofed version gradually leaving production.

European and American versions followed in 1987 and all models received a restyling in 1989. In some countries, such as Sweden, the Justy was marketed as the &quot;Subaru Trendy&quot;. In some regions, it was also simply marketed as the &#x27;J-series&#x27; in early years, J10 for 1.0 L versions and J12 for the later 1.2 L versions. In many markets the Justy was only sold with four-wheel-drive, as with much of the Subaru lineup. Intended to compete with Daihatsu&#x27;s one-litre Charade, the Justy was presented with a one-litre engine. Somewhat underpowered, this was later complemented by a larger 1.2-litre which eventually became the only engine installed. In European catalyzed trim, this engine offered at 5200 rpm.

In Taiwan, Subaru marketed a version of the Justy with a sedan-style body and an uprated fuel injected EF12 engine called the Tutto. Taiwanese Subarus were assembled by their local partner Ta Ching.

===United States===
Justy models manufactured in Japan were marketed for model years 1987-1994 with the 1.2 engine. Early models featured a low-roof, and beginning with model year 1989, featured a high roof. The Justy received 4WD as an option in 1988, and all models were equipped with Multi Port Fuel Injection late in 1991. For 1990, the automatic front two-point motorized passive seat belts were introduced for 3-door FWD models in the United States market only, while manual front seat belts were retained on the 4WD models. A five-door model was available from 1990 to 1994, only with 4WD. A 1995 model was offered in Canada.

===Norway===
The Subaru Justy (they were registered as &quot;Justy/Trendy&quot; in Norway) was available from late 1984 with optional 4×4 and the EF10 engine. The 4×4 version came with a version of the engine with a two barrel carburetor, while the FWD version only produced with a single barrel carburetor. The 4×4 version had a factory top speed of and could accelerate in 16 seconds. Gear ratios were identical on the 1.0- and 1.2-litre versions. Stock tire dimensions on the 1.0-litre version where 145-SR-12 and the 1.2-litre version had 165-65-R-13. The turning circle was of and the fuel tank was 35 litres.

===Taiwan===

Fuji Heavy Industries signed a long-term contract with Ta Ching Motor Co. in 1989 in Taiwan right after the Justy hatchback started production. Ta Ching Motor Co. later developed the Subaru Tutto notchback sedan unique to Taiwan based on the Justy hatchback.
===Drivetrain===
Initially, the Justy was equipped with a 1.0 or 1.2 litre EF three-cylinder engine and either a manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission with either front wheel drive or on-demand four wheel drive. The CVT technology (a pushbelt system) was employed because with a conventional automatic transmission, performance would have been unacceptable due to the small 3-cylinder engine and due to driving conditions in Japan, where the speed limits realistically don&#x27;t exceed in urban areas, the Justy was an affordable choice. In North America, because of the long distances, the CVT was considered unreliable, but this has not been the case in other countries.

In 1989, the gear ratios changed, front brakes and outer axle shafts were made larger, the rear differential was reinforced and the front axle shafts were identical lengths thanks to an intermediate extension shaft.

The European Justy sold from 1994 to 2001 was a rebadged second generation Suzuki Cultus built in Hungary. It used a 1.3 SOHC 8V, G13BA Suzuki engine with a Suzuki 5-speed manual transmission and AWD via a viscous clutch as standard.

===Gear ratios===
1987–1988

1989–1994
==Rebadged models==
After 1994, rebadged models from other manufacturers carried the Justy nameplate:

* In 1994, Subaru introduced to the Europe market a rebadged second generation Suzuki Cultus carrying the Justy nameplate. Manufactured at Suzuki&#x27;s Esztergom, Hungary plant, these were available in 3 and 5 door models, both with full-time all wheel drive as standard.
* In 2004, a rebadged Suzuki Ignis carried the G3X Justy nameplate in Europe, this model is available with a Suzuki M13A or M15A engine, and also equipped as standard with AWD.
* In model year 2007 a rebadged Toyota Passo/Daihatsu Boon revived the Justy nameplate with the Toyota 1KR-FE 1.0 L engine. It was only available with front wheel drive, unlike previous Justy models since the first one in 1984 that had either optional or standard 4WD/AWD.
* In late 2016 a rebadged Toyota Roomy/Tank/Daihatsu Thor revived the Justy nameplate with the Toyota 1KR-FE 1.0 L engine.

<text>The receiver general for Canada () is responsible for making payments to the Government of Canada each fiscal year, accepting payments from financial institutions and preparing the Public Accounts of Canada, containing annual audited financial statements of the Government of Canada. The receiver general deposits and withdraws funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada.

The minister of public services and procurement is the receiver general for Canada. The &quot;Department of Public Works and Government Services Act, 1996&quot; states: &quot;In the Minister&#x27;s capacity as Receiver General, the Minister shall exercise all the powers and perform all the duties and functions assigned to the receiver general by law.&quot;

==Receivers General== 
The first holder was Walter Murray, who was related to then Governor of Quebec James Murray from 1764. Murray was succeeded by Sir Thomas Mills from 1765 to 1777. Mills was often absent thus his office was held in acting by subordinates: Hector Theophilus Cramahe from 1766 to 1770 and Thomas Dunn from 1770 to 1777). Mills was returned to the post from 1777 until he was forced out in 1789 The office was replaced by the division of Quebec into Upper Canada and Lower Canada in 1791.

Pre-Confederation colonies of Lower Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Upper Canada and the Province of Canada each had this post.

From 1867 to 1879 it was a standalone position with minister of finance as &quot;ex officio&quot;. R.B. Bennett (1926, 1930–32) and Mackenzie Bowell (1896) are the only Prime Ministers to hold the title (Tupper held post before becoming a Prime Minister as Minister of Finance). From 1879 to 1968 it was held mainly by the minister of finance. Reverting as standalone in 1968 and transferred to the minister of supply and services in 1979. From 1980 to 1984 there was no cabinet title but under the authority of the minister of supply and services before reappearing in 1984. In 1996 the role was merged into the minister of public works with new title as minister of public works and government services and then as minister of public services and procurement since 2015.

<doc id="1201641" wikidata="Q3509564" url="?curid=1201641" title="Pulse generator">
<text>A pulse generator is either an electronic circuit &quot;or&quot; a piece of electronic test equipment used to generate rectangular pulses. Pulse generators are used primarily for working with digital circuits; related function generators are used primarily for analog circuits.

==Bench pulse generators==

Simple bench pulse generators usually allow control of the pulse repetition rate (frequency), pulse width, delay with respect to an internal or external trigger and the high- and low-voltage levels of the pulses. More sophisticated pulse generators may allow control over the rise time and fall time of the pulses. Pulse generators are available for generating output pulses having widths (duration) ranging from minutes to under 1 picosecond.

Pulse generators are generally voltage sources, with true current pulse generators being available only from a few suppliers.

Pulse generators may use digital techniques, analog techniques, or a combination of both techniques to form the output pulses. For example, the pulse repetition rate and duration may be digitally controlled but the pulse amplitude and rise and fall times may be determined by analog circuitry in the output stage of the pulse generator. With correct adjustment, pulse generators can also produce a 50% duty cycle square wave. Pulse generators are generally single-channel, providing one frequency, delay, width and output.

===Optical pulse generators===
Light pulse generators are the optical equivalent to electrical pulse generators with rep rate, delay,width and amplitude control. The output in this case is light, typically from a LED or laser diode.

===Multiple-channels===

A new family of pulse generators can produce multiple channels of independent widths and delays and independent outputs and polarities. Often called digital delay/pulse generators, the newest designs even offer differing repetition rates with each channel. These digital delay generators are useful in synchronizing, delaying, gating and triggering multiple devices, usually with respect to one event. One is also able to multiplex the timing of several channels onto one channel in order to trigger or even gate the same device multiple times.

A new class of pulse generator offers both multiple input trigger connections and multiple output connections. Multiple input triggers allow experimenters to synchronize both trigger events and data acquisition events using the same timing controller.

In general, generators for pulses with widths over a few microseconds employ digital counters for timing these pulses, while widths between approximately 1 nanosecond and several microseconds are typically generated by analog techniques such as RC (resistor-capacitor) networks or switched delay lines.

==Microwave pulsers==
Pulse generators capable of generating pulses with widths under approximately 100 picoseconds are often termed as &quot;microwave pulsers&quot; and typically generate these ultra-short pulses using Step recovery diode (SRD) or Nonlinear Transmission Line (NLTL) methods (for example ). Step Recovery Diode pulse generators are inexpensive, but typically require several volts of input drive level and have a moderately high level of random jitter (usually undesirable variation in the time at which successive pulses occur).

NLTL-based pulse generators generally have lower jitter, but are more complex to manufacture and do not suit integration in low-cost monolithic ICs. A new class of microwave pulse generation architecture, the RACE (Rapid Automatic Cascode Exchange) pulse generation circuit is implemented using low-cost monolithic IC technology and can produce pulses as short as 1 picosecond and repetition rates exceeding 30 billion pulses per second. These pulsers are typically used in military communications applications and low-power microwave transceiver ICs. Such pulsers, if driven by a continuous frequency clock, will act as microwave comb generators, having output frequency components at integer multiples of the pulse repetition rate, and extending to well over 100 gigahertz (for example ).

==Applications==
Pulses can be injected into a device that is under test and used as a stimulus, clock signal, or analyzed as they progress through the device, confirming the proper operation of the device or
pinpointing a fault in the device. Pulse generators are also used to drive devices such as switches, lasers and optical components, modulators, intensifiers, and resistive loads. The output of a pulse generator may also be used as the modulation signal for a signal generator. Non-electronic applications include those in material science, medical, physics, and chemistry.

* Single channel pulse generators were in existence in the 1950s

<text>Echinopsis is a genus of cacti native to South America, sometimes known as hedgehog cactus, sea-urchin cactus or Easter lily cactus. , there are about 20 accepted species, ranging from large and treelike types to small globose cacti. The name derives from &quot;echinos&quot; hedgehog or sea urchin, and &quot;opsis&quot; appearance, a reference to these plants&#x27; dense coverings of spines.

They are remarkable for the great size, length of tube, and beauty of their flowers, borne upon generally small and dumpy stems.

== Taxonomy ==
Studies in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in several formerly separate genera being absorbed into &quot;Echinopsis&quot;. When very broadly circumscribed, &quot;Echinopsis&quot; sensu lato included over 100 species. Some genera have been absorbed and then accepted again. For example, the genus name &quot;Trichocereus&quot; was given to a number of columnar cacti in 1909 by Vincenzo Riccobono. The genus was subsumed into &quot;Echinopsis&quot; in 1974 by Friedrich, along with &quot;Lobivia&quot;. In 2011, it was argued that &quot;Trichocereus&quot; was distinct from &quot;Echinopsis&quot;, and a 2012 genetic and morphological study by Albesiano found &quot;Trichocereus&quot; to be monophyletic if it included three species of &quot;Harrisia&quot;.

A 2012 genetic analysis of chloroplast DNA indicated &quot;Echinopsis&quot; was made up of several divergent lineages. This was shown again in 2019. It was concluded that previous taxonomic confusion was due to convergent evolution: species in different lineages had evolved to have similar growth and/or to share pollinators.

, Plants of the World Online accepted &quot;Echinopsis&quot; more narrowly circumscribed to include only 20 species, the others being separated in &quot;Acanthocalycium&quot;, &quot;Chamaecereus&quot;, &quot;Leucostele&quot;, &quot;Lobivia&quot;, &quot;Reicheocactus&quot;, &quot;Setiechinopsis&quot;, &quot;Soehrensia&quot; and &quot;Trichocereus&quot;, and in one case (&quot;E. cephalomacrostibas &quot;) moved to &quot;Weberbauerocereus&quot;. , Caryophyllales.org accepted only 15 species, while noting the existence of 373 synonyms.

=== Species ===
Species of &quot;Echinopsis sensu stricto&quot; accepted by Plants of the World Online :

In addition, many hybrids exist, mostly between similar species but also between more distinct ones, such as the cross between &quot;Trichocereus pachanoi&quot; (now &quot;Trichocereus macrogonus&quot; var. &quot;pachanoi&quot;) and &quot;E. eyriesii&quot; (now &quot;E. oxygona&quot;) which was sold under the name &quot;Trichopsis pachaniesii&quot; by Sacred Succulents.

==Distribution==
&quot;Echinopsis&quot; species are native to South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). They thrive in desert grasslands, shrubland, and in situations where the soil is sandy or gravelly, such as the sides of hills in the crevices of rocks.

==Cultivation==

The growing and resting seasons for &quot;Echinopsis&quot; are the same as for &quot;Echinocactus&quot;. Research by J. Smith (former Curator at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew) showed that species like the Chilean &quot;Echinopsis cristata&quot; and its Mexican relatives thrive if potted in light loam, with a little leaf mould and a few nodules of limestone. The limestone keeps the soil open; it is important that the soil should be well drained.

<doc id="1201653" wikidata="Q4783340" url="?curid=1201653" title="Arabesk trilogy">
<text>The &quot;Arabesk&quot; [[trilogy]] is a sequence of alternate history novels by the British author Jon Courtenay Grimwood.

Starting with the 2001 novel &quot;Pashazade&quot; and continuing with &quot;Effendi&quot; (2002) and &quot;Felaheen&quot; (2003), the point of divergence occurs in 1915 by US President Woodrow Wilson brokering an earlier peace so that World War I never expanded outside the Balkans. The books are set in a liberal Islamic Ottoman North Africa in the 21st century, mainly centring on Alexandria, referred to as El Iskandriyah.

The central character, Raf, is an enigma. Genetically enhanced, frequently wired on various drugs, occasionally accompanied by the hallucinatory fox , and strongly conscientious in everything he does, Raf&#x27;s past is as much a mystery as his future.

==&quot;Pashazade&quot;==

 (shortlisted for the 2002 Arthur C. Clarke Award, BSFA award for Best Novel and John W. Campbell Memorial Award)

The first book centres on the arrival in Alexandria of Bey Ashraf al-Mansur, claimed to be the son of the Emir of Tunis. Shortly after his arrival, though, Raf&#x27;s tendency to do exactly what he thinks is right leads to unexpected consequences. Between caring for his niece, Hani, and attempting to understand Zara, the girl he was to marry, Raf ends up suspected of his Aunt Nafisa&#x27;s murder, running from the police as he tries desperately to work out who really killed her.

The main story is intercut with out-of-order flashbacks to Raf&#x27;s past as a schoolboy in Swiss and Scottish boarding schools and as &#x27;ZeeZee&#x27;, a low-ranking agent of Hu San, an influential Triad boss in Seattle.

==&quot;Effendi&quot;==

&quot;Effendi&quot; was shortlisted for the BSFA award for Best Novel.

The second book opens with the discovery of a body near the mansion of billionaire Hamzah Effendi, Zara&#x27;s father. As the new Chief of Detectives, Raf is obliged to investigate, he uncovers a past as a child soldier under the infamous Colonel Abad that Hamzah would rather forget. Meanwhile, as agents from Berlin, Washington, DC, and Paris battle diplomatically for influence over North Africa&#x27;s most influential port, its nominal ruler, the young Khedive, is sent on holiday by the Governor General Koenig Pasha, whose cryptic notes Raf is left struggling to understand. The whole city hangs in the balance, and this time, Raf will need help to save it.

This novel includes a second narrative dealing with the young Hamzah&#x27;s actions as a prepubescent soldier surviving famine and desert to carry out his lethal mission for the mysterious Abad.

==&quot;Felaheen&quot;==

&quot;Felaheen&quot; was the winner of the BSFA award for Best Novel and shortlisted for the British Fantasy Award.

The third book starts with the near-death of the Emir of Tunis, forcing Raf to investigate the biggest mystery of all, his own origins. As the 11-year-old Hani races to get to the Emir&#x27;s banquet, Raf is forced underground to discover the truth about his father. Kashif Pasha, the Emir&#x27;s other son, is intent on removing any threat Raf might pose to his own claim to the throne, but he could get more than he bargained for if Raf&#x27;s djinn-like abilities are as real as Hani thinks.

Frequent flashbacks tell the story of Sally Welham, Raf&#x27;s mother, from New York to Tunis via Thailand as she sets out to get what she wants.

<text>Douglas Valentine LePan (25 May 1914 – 27 November 1998) was a Canadian diplomat, poet, novelist and professor of literature.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, LePan was educated at the University of Toronto, at Harvard (where he also taught briefly in the late 1930s), and at Merton College, Oxford. During the Second World War, he was on staff at the Canadian High Commission in London and then served in the Canadian Army as an artilleryman during the Italian campaign. He joined the Canadian diplomatic service in 1946, and during his years as a diplomat served in London (as special assistant to Lester Pearson in the late 1940s) and in Washington, as well as in Ottawa. He was formally in the employ of the Department of External Affairs until 1959, though for several years during that time he was seconded by the Department of Finance to serve as Secretary for the Royal Commission on Canada&#x27;s Economic Prospects (the &quot;Gordon Commission&quot;); his work drafting the multi-volume Report of the commission was widely praised.

LePan left the diplomatic service in 1959 to return to academic life; he taught at Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Ontario, and at the University of Toronto, where he was Principal of University College (1964–1970) and then University Professor and Senior Fellow at Massey College.

LePan&#x27;s wartime experience with the Canadian Army in Italy inspired much of his poetry and one novel, &quot;The Deserter&quot; (1964). LePan is one of only a few people (Michael Ondaatje and George Bowering are two others) to have won the Governor General&#x27;s Award both for poetry (1953 for &quot;The Net and the Sword&quot;) and fiction (1964 for &quot;The Deserter&quot;, in a highly controversial win over Margaret Laurence&#x27;s &quot;The Stone Angel&quot;).

In 1982 LePan published his first volume of poetry in almost 30 years (&quot;Something Still to Find&quot;), and in 1990 he created something of a sensation with &quot;Far Voyages&quot;, a volume largely composed of gay love poetry.

LePan had married, in 1948 to the former Sarah Katharine Chambers; the two remained together until 1971, but the marriage was a difficult one, not least of all over issues relating to sexual orientation. The couple had two children; Nicholas Le Pan, the elder of the two, was for many years a senior civil servant in Canada&#x27;s Department of Finance and served from 2001 to 2006 as Superintendent of Financial Institutions, while the younger, Don LePan, is founder and CEO of academic publishing house Broadview Press and the author of several novels.

LePan&#x27;s 1989 book of memoirs &quot;Bright Glass of Memory&quot; recounts his involvement with several leading lights of the twentieth century, including John Maynard Keynes and T.S. Eliot. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1998; among his other awards were a Guggenheim Fellowship (1948), the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal (1976), and several honorary degrees. He remains well known for his war poetry (long poems from the post-war period such as &quot;Tuscan Villa&quot; and &quot;Elegy for the Romagna,&quot; as well as shorter, punchier 1980s poems such as &quot;Below Monte Cassino&quot; in which he recalled the events of a generation earlier); for his poems relating to the landscape of Georgian Bay in Ontario; for his love poems; and for lyric poems in which the poet&#x27;s passion for the natural world is infused with the suggestion of homoerotic passion (&quot;Coureurs de Bois,&quot; &quot;A Country Without a Mythology&quot;). His work has been included in many anthologies, including &quot;The Norton Anthology of Poetry&quot;, &quot;Canadian Literature in English: Texts and Contexts&quot;, &quot;The Harbrace Anthology of Poetry&quot;, &quot;The Broadview Anthology of Poetry&quot;, and &quot;Modern Canadian Poets&quot;.

<doc id="1201689" wikidata="Q2379266" url="?curid=1201689" title="Round number">
<text>A round number is an integer that ends with one or more &quot;0&quot;s (zero-digit) in a given base. So, 590 is rounder than 592, but 590 is less round than 600. In both technical and informal language, a round number is often interpreted to stand for a value or values near to the nominal value expressed. For instance, a round number such as 600 might be used to refer to a value whose magnitude is actually 592, because the actual value is more cumbersome to express exactly. Likewise, a round number may refer to a range of values near the nominal value that expresses imprecision about a quantity. Thus, a value reported as 600 might actually represent any value near 600, possibly as low as 550 or as high as 649, all of which would &quot;round&quot; to 600.

In decimal notation, a number ending in the digit &quot;5&quot; is also considered more round than one ending in another non-zero digit (but less round than any which ends with &quot;0&quot;). For example, the number 25 tends to be seen as more round than 24. Thus someone might say, upon turning 45, that their age is more round than when they turn 44 or 46. These notions of roundness are also often applied to non-integer numbers; so, in any given base, 2.3 is rounder than 2.297, because 2.3 can be written as 2.300. Thus, a number with fewer digits which are not trailing &quot;0&quot;s is considered to be rounder than others of the same or greater precision.

Numbers can also be considered &quot;round&quot; in numbering systems other than decimal (base 10). For example, the number 1024 would not be considered round in decimal, but the same number ends with a zero in several other numbering systems including binary (base 2: 10000000000), octal (base 8: 2000), and hexadecimal (base 16: 400). The previous discussion about the digit &quot;5&quot; generalizes to the digit representing &quot;b&quot;/2 for base-&quot;b&quot; notation, if &quot;b&quot; is even.

==Psychology and sociology==
Psychologically, round numbers form waypoints in pricing and negotiation. So, starting salaries are usually round numbers. Prices are often pitched just below round numbers to avoid breaking the psychological barrier of paying the price of the round number.

==Culture==
Round-number anniversaries are often especially celebrated. For example, a fiftieth birthday, the centenary of an event, or the millionth visitor or customer to a location or business.

On January 1, 2000, the round-number year 2000 was widely celebrated. Technically, the 3rd millennium did not begin until January 1, 2001, a year later, as there is no year zero in the Gregorian calendar.

== Round number bias ==
Round number bias is the psychological tendency to prefer round numbers over others, which is passed onto a person through socialization. Round numbers are also easier for a person to remember, process, and perform mathematical operations on.

Round number bias has been observed mainly in retail and grocery, where prices are often just slightly less than a rounded number (ex. $9.99 or $9.95), in investments, including crowdfunding, in the real estate market through mortgages, and number milestones.

Round numbers are often used when estimating the time taken to complete a task.

==Mathematics==

A round number is mathematically defined as an integer which is the product of a considerable number of comparatively small factors as compared to its neighboring numbers, such as 24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 (4 factors, as opposed to 3 factors for 27; 2 factors for 21, 22, 25, and 26; and 1 factor for 23).

<doc id="1201696" wikidata="Q1145932" url="?curid=1201696" title="King Rat (Clavell novel)">
<text>King Rat is a 1962 novel by James Clavell and the author&#x27;s literary debut. Set during World War II, the novel describes the struggle for survival of American, Australian, British, Dutch and New Zealander prisoners of war in a Japanese camp in Singapore. Clavell was a prisoner in the Changi Prison camp, where the novel is set. One of the three major characters, Peter Marlowe, is based upon Clavell.

&quot;King Rat&quot; was the first book published of Clavell&#x27;s sweeping series, the &quot;Asian Saga&quot;, and the fourth chronologically. Two characters from &quot;King Rat&quot; also appear in &quot;Noble House&quot; (1981).

==Plot summary==
The novel opens in early 1945. Peter Marlowe, a young British RAF Flight Lieutenant, has been a P.O.W. since 1942. Marlowe comes to the attention of the &quot;King&quot; - an American corporal who has become the most successful trader and black marketeer in Changi - when King sees him conversing in Malay. Marlowe&#x27;s languages, intelligence, honesty, and personality cause King to befriend him and attempt to involve him in black market deals, which bring Marlowe to the attention of Robin Grey, a British officer and Provost Marshal of the camp, who has developed a Javert-like obsession with King and hopes to arrest him for violating camp regulations. Grey is attempting to maintain military discipline among the prisoners and sees King as the antithesis of his beliefs. As the son of a working-class family, Grey follows the rules for their own sake, using his position as Provost Marshal to gain a status otherwise unavailable to him in British society.

Despite being an enlisted man and undistinguished in civilian life, King has become a major power in the closed society of the POW camp through his charisma and intelligence. Trading with Korean guards, local Malay villagers, and other prisoners for food, clothing, information, and what few luxuries are available, King keeps himself and his fellow American prisoners alive. Senior officers come to him for help in selling their valuables to buy food, and other officers are secretly on his payroll. Marlowe is initially put off by King&#x27;s perspective and behaviour, which clash with the British upper class ideals he has been taught. He turns down a lucrative business partnership with King because &quot;Marlowes aren&#x27;t tradesmen. It just isn&#x27;t done, old boy&quot;. Marlowe soon understands that King is not the thief and con artist that Grey would have him believe. Rather, King asks for the best of each man and rewards him accordingly, irrespective of class or position.

Through the experiences of Marlowe, King, and other characters, the novel offers a vivid, often disturbing portrayal of men brought to the edge of survival by a brutal environment. The P.O.W.s are given nothing by the Japanese other than filthy huts to live in and the bare minimum of food. Officers from various parts of Britain&#x27;s Asian empire, accustomed to having native servants provide them with freshly laundered uniforms daily, are reduced to wearing rags and homemade shoes. For most, the chief concern is obtaining enough food to stay alive from day to day and avoiding disease or injury, since almost no medical care is available. Some are degraded and come close to losing their humanity, while others display levels of courage and compassion beyond expectations. Some steal food out the mouths of their comrades, while others give away what they have or take terrible risks to help their friends.

King decides he and his friends should breed rats to sell for food. His comrades, though nearly starving themselves, are repelled by the idea of eating rat meat, so King comes up with the plan of only selling the meat to officers without telling them the true source. A group of officers who stole money from their underlings are later seen greedily enjoying a meal of what they are told is mouse deer (&quot;rusa tikus&quot; in Malay), not knowing they are actually eating rat meat. When the camp is ultimately liberated, most of the soldiers have trouble adjusting to freedom. King loses his power and is shunned by the others. Grey ironically thanks King on the grounds that his hatred of King was the only thing keeping him alive. At the end the rats are abandoned in their cages when the camp is abandoned. The final scene has the rats consuming each other one by one, with the final survivor becoming &quot;king of the rats&quot;.

==Characters in &quot;King Rat&quot;==
* The King – a shrewd American corporal; at the end of the novel he is sent back to the United States under an impending investigation for illegal profiteering in a prison camp and Marlowe never sees him again
* Peter Marlowe – the protagonist, a young upper class British fighter pilot who later becomes an author; based on James Clavell
* Robin Grey – a young British lieutenant from the lower classes, the Camp Provost Marshall [MP], and the antagonist to Marlowe
* Percy Smedly-Taylor - British Colonel, later appears as a director of Struan&#x27;s Holdings, MP, in Clavell&#x27;s subsequent novel &quot;Whirlwind&quot;.

Two characters from &quot;King Rat&quot; also appear in &quot;Noble House&quot; (published 1981), a novel set in Hong Kong in the early 1960s, when Marlowe is a writer visiting Hong Kong to conduct research about the great British trading companies there. Grey, embittered by his failure to obtain a commission in the postwar British Army despite his suffering during the war, has become a radical socialist Member of UK Parliament and is also in Hong Kong on an official visit. Unknown to Marlowe, Grey has become a secret Communist and a Soviet agent who tries to thwart efforts to improve relations between China and the West.

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation was released in 1965, the first of several of Clavell&#x27;s novels to be so adapted.

<text>King Rat is a 1965 American war film written and directed by Bryan Forbes and starring George Segal and James Fox. They play Corporal King and Flight Lieutenant Marlowe, respectively, two World War II prisoners of war in a squalid camp in Singapore. Among the supporting cast are John Mills and Tom Courtenay. The film was adapted from James Clavell&#x27;s novel &quot;King Rat&quot; (1962), which in turn is partly based on Clavell&#x27;s experiences as a POW at Changi Prison in Singapore in the latter part of the Second World War.

==Plot==
Corporal King is an anomaly in the Japanese prison camp. One of only a handful of Americans amongst the British and Australian inmates, he thrives through his conniving and black market enterprises, while others, nearly all of higher rank, struggle to survive sickness and starvation while trying to retain their civilized standards. King recruits upper class British RAF officer Flight Lieutenant Peter Marlowe to act as a translator. As they become acquainted, Marlowe comes to like the man and appreciate his cunning. King respects Marlowe, but his attitude is otherwise ambiguous; when Marlowe is injured, King obtains expensive medicines to save Marlowe&#x27;s gangrenous arm from amputation, but, despite the fact that he stays by the sick man&#x27;s bedside, it is unclear whether he does so out of friendship or because Marlowe is the only one who knows where the proceeds from King&#x27;s latest and most profitable venture are hidden.

However the lower-class, seemingly incorruptible, British Provost Lieutenant Grey has only contempt for the American, and does his best to bring him down. Then Grey has to deal with an unrelated dilemma when he accidentally discovers that the high-ranking officer in charge of the meagre food rations has been stealing. He rejects a bribe and zealously takes the matter to Colonel George Smedley-Taylor. To his dismay, Smedley-Taylor tells him the corrupt officer and his assistant have merely been relieved of their duties and orders him to forget all about it. Grey accuses Smedley-Taylor of being in on the scheme, but the tampered weight he presented to the Colonel as evidence has been replaced, so he no longer has proof of the crime. Smedley-Taylor offers to promote him to acting captain. When a troubled Grey does not respond, Smedley-Taylor takes his silence as consent.

King starts breeding rats and selling the meat to British officers, telling them it is mouse-deer. When a pet dog is put down for killing a chicken, King has it cooked and he and his friends secretly eat it. Although they protest when they discover the origin of the meat, they ultimately relish it. The stakes are raised when they acquire a diamond to sell. The Japanese commander reads a scroll while a junior officer translates for the senior British officers, informing them that the Japanese have surrendered and the war is over. The prisoners celebrate – all except King: he realizes he is no longer the de facto ruler of the camp. King manages to squelch a premature attempt by resentful underling First Sergeant Max to reassert his rank and authority, but that only delays the inevitable.

Weaver, a lone British paratrooper appears from seemingly nowhere, walks up to the prison gates and fires a revolver in the air; the guards surrender. When Weaver attempts to talk with the Prisoners of War, most of them are in almost a state of shock, with King being the only one who responds to him. Though King is polite and deferential, Weaver almost immediately becomes suspicious of his clean and healthy appearance compared to the other prisoners and promises not to forget him. When Marlowe speaks to him before King&#x27;s departure from the camp, King belittles their friendship, saying &quot;you worked for me, and I paid you.&quot; The Americans are put on a truck. Marlowe rushes to say goodbye to King, but is too late and the truck drives off. Grey remarks that it was &quot;our lot (the British working class) that threw Churchill out,&quot; and declares, &quot;We&#x27;ll be running things from now on,&quot; indicating that the end of the war marks the beginning of a new political order.

==Cast==
Richard Dawson appears near the end of the film as Captain Weaver, a paratrooper who is sent ahead to claim the prison from the Japanese, as the war has ended. An American sergeant (Mickey Simpson) rounds up the Americans to send them home.
==Production==
Bryan Forbes was offered the job of writing the script and directing by James Woolf. Forbes called Clavell&#x27;s novel &quot;stunning&quot; but said
Faced with the task of condensing its 400 pages into screenplay form, I stripped away those portions of the novel I did not wholeheartedly admire (mostly the introduction of native girls which, though possibly authentic, belonged to the realm of Dorothy Lamour) and posed one single question: how did men survive under such conditions? It is my most complex screenplay, with little action and mostly concerned with the interplay of character.
The film was shot in Los Angeles as new head of production Mike Frankovich wanted to show he was opposed to &quot;runaway productions&quot;. A ranch was discovered at Thousand Oaks that was turned into the camp.

Forbes said he and Woolf had a battle with Columbia &quot;who were adamant that we should employ a variety of middle-aged Americans&quot; in the film. He and Woolf arranged it that &quot;in return for employing every resident British actor in Hollywood on the SAG list, we were allowed to import a quota from England.&quot; Forbes said the British actors &quot;were selected for their slimness as well as their acting talents and asked to stay on a strict diet until their roles were completed.&quot;

Forbes said Columbia&#x27;s suggestions for the title role included Frank Sinatra, Robert Mitchum, James Garner, and Burt Lancaster, but he felt these would &quot;have made nonsense for Clavell&#x27;s novel&quot; and he insisted on George Segal. The director also insisted on black and white photography.
Forbes later called making the film:
A watershed in my professional life, a unique experience I am unlikely to repeat. I was being paid to create something I passionately believed in with the absolute minimum of interference and the maximum loyalty and co-operation of studio, cast and crew alike. I learnt a great deal from that American crew and however fortunate I am in the future, the situation will never be quite as perfect again. It was a hard, physical film to make, not without its moments of despair and indeed desperation, but at the end of the sixty-two shooting days I was so affected I could scarcely talk for fear of breaking down.

The movie previewed poorly and led to Forbes deleting some scenes, and toning down anti-religious passages.

==Awards==
Burnett Guffey was nominated for Academy Awards for Cinematography, and Robert Emmet Smith and Frank Tuttle for Art Direction.

==Reception==
Forbes was unhappy with what he felt was a misleading ad campaign. He said the film &quot;made little or no impression in America, although it was given long and impressive reviews by the top-line critics — but I remain convinced that whatever chance it had was thrown away by run-of-the-mill and basically dishonest exploitation. Now it has become a cult film on the university campuses, but in 1965 when it was first shown Vietnam was still a clean war, and the American mass audiences were unlikely to take kindly to such a cynical view of human behaviour. It had no happy or heroic ending and said some unpopular things about the American dream. The real audience, the audience for whom it was intended, stayed away.&quot;

He later clarified the film &quot;proved to be a success everywhere but in America, at one time playing in four cinemas simultaneously on the Champs-Elysées. &quot;

John Mills wrote the film &quot;showed how unpredictable this funny old business can be. It was a wonderful script, a great cast and one of the best directorial jobs Bryan Forbes has ever done... Everybody loved the picture but it wasn’t a success. The only thing I can put it down to is that there was no gorgeous, glamorous girl, no love interest.&quot;

The film has been praised for its realism and cinematography. Moreover, Segal&#x27;s performance has been cited as one of the strongest of his career.

Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote &quot;The film (King Rat) is dexterously made. It is also meretricious, imitative, thematically muddy&#x27;. Kauffmann went on to praise the performances in the movie, especially James Fox&#x27;s.

However, Clavell later said &quot;my feeling is the film failed because Forbes took away the story thread and made it a composite of character studies&quot;.

<doc id="1201718" wikidata="Q12031711" url="?curid=1201718" title="King Rat (Miéville novel)">
<text>King Rat is an urban fantasy novel by British writer China Miéville, published in 1998. Unlike his Bas-Lag novels, it is set in London during the late 1990s. It follows the life of Saul Garamond after the death of his father and his meeting with King Rat. As King Rat takes Saul under his wing, the young man is quickly embroiled in a centuries-old rivalry. &quot;King Rat&quot; was Miéville&#x27;s debut novel.

==Plot summary==
Saul Garamond returns to the flat he shares with his father in London late one evening, skipping on greetings and heading straight to bed. In the morning he is awakened by police pounding on the door, come to arrest him. It appears he is the lone suspect in his father&#x27;s murder case. After spending most of a day being interrogated and in a holding cell, Saul finds he has a mysterious visitor, who introduces himself as King Rat. The two begin a one sided rooftop escape as King Rat carries Saul along. At the end of this journey, King Rat reveals to Saul that he is his uncle by way of Saul&#x27;s mother being a rat and also that Saul has been set up to take the fall for his father&#x27;s death.

Saul follows King Rat exploring the secrets of London, from the rooftops to the sewers. Being half rat, his two primary abilities are being able to eat anything, even garbage, and squeezing into holes and shadows too small for other creatures. Meanwhile, Saul&#x27;s friend Natasha Karadjian, a drum and bass musician, begins to write and record new music with a flautist named Pete. Two of their other mutual friends, Fabian and Kay, are unnerved by this stranger but find it hard not to like the music the two are making. These friends are also being pursued by the police for any information on Saul&#x27;s whereabouts. After spending several days with King Rat, Saul hears whispers of the return of the Ratcatcher.

This prompts King Rat to gather allies, Anansi, the spider king, and Loplop, the bird king; they are prompted to join him for their own reasons—the Ratcatcher is also after the Spidercatcher and Birdcatcher, their enemy as well. So, King Rat relates the story of living in Hamelin, the last time he really was king. But he was displaced, of course, by the Pied Piper of Hamelin and his flute. It is revealed that now the Piper travels the world seeking pests so he may kill for the fun of it. The three animal kings end the story by swearing revenge.

Even with his newfound powers, Saul is forced to stay in the shadows with King Rat, but cannot forget his own friends and past. He visits Kay but the two no longer understand each other. This visit leads to Pete, being revealed as the returned Piper, finding and murdering Kay. Meanwhile, the animal kings&#x27; plans begin to fall short and they drift apart. Saul begins to push his new boundaries and explore London on his own. During this time, he meets Deborah, a vagrant. Together they return to Saul&#x27;s former flat, where he finds his father&#x27;s old notebook. Here finds an entry about an attack on his mother nine months before his own birth. He realises he is not King Rat&#x27;s nephew but his son, by way of rape and that everything since his father&#x27;s death has been a set up by King Rat, who must therefore be the murderer of the man Saul considers his father.

As they discover these facts, the Piper confronts Saul and Deborah. He kills Deborah but Loplop saves Saul. The piper reveals that he cannot control Saul as he can the others, as the Piper can only play one song at a time and as such a tune that controls rats will be ignored by Saul&#x27;s human side and vice versa.
Saul returns to the sewers to confront King Rat, leading to a falling-out. He wants to go his own way and leave the Piper to the animal kings. Natasha and Pete have set up an act at a club, Jungle, to debut their music. Fabian is interrogated by the police again and he realises that the flute left behind when Saul was attacked belongs to Pete. He calls the police to meet him at Natasha&#x27;s home but arriving ahead of them he is wounded and both he and Natasha are taken by the Piper.

After wandering for a few days, Saul meets up with Anansi, who informs him of Kay&#x27;s death by the Piper. He begins to notice something is wrong in the sewer as well, as the rats have disappeared, their scratching replaced by a new sound, music. He traces the sound back to King Rat&#x27;s throne room, now filled with dancing and dead rats; who along with King Rat are mesmerised by the music playing on a ghetto blaster. Saul realises the title on the tape within is written in Natasha&#x27;s handwriting. He finds a poster for Natasha and the Piper&#x27;s show, and despite knowing it is a trap, he goes to save his friends.

Saul sneaks into the club with his new rat allies and Anansi leading the spiders. Loplop, left deaf by Saul during the Piper&#x27;s first attack is unable to rally his birds. However, when Natasha takes the stage to spin her records, Pete throws her a DAT, which has his flute samples on it. The layering of tracks allows the Piper to play several tunes at once, controlling the rats, clubbers and spiders all at once.

Unable to defend himself Anansi is killed by the Piper and Saul is overwhelmed. However, King Rat bursts from under the stage and attacks the Piper, but proves to be only a momentary distraction. With the musical fusion playing, the entire club is under the Piper&#x27;s control and all he wants to kill Saul, who will not dance for him. The music does not mesh: instead of one solo flute, two flutes compete for the overlying sound. This dissonance causes Saul to regain control just as the Piper attempts to kill him; he dodges the blow and resists the Piper. The Piper knows he cannot win a physical fight, so he tears a hole in reality by playing his flute through which he can escape, just as he tore a hole in the mountain to hide the children of Hamelin. King Rat attacks the Piper with the Piper&#x27;s own flute; they both fall into the rent but King Rat jumps away, and suddenly the hole closes, the Piper on the other side.

Saul and King Rat are unsung heroes of the club but they both know they can never be a part of the world they just saved. King Rat still wants his kingdom back from Saul. Saul refuses to give in and knows that if the Piper returns, King Rat will still need him, so he can&#x27;t be killed to restore complete order to the rat kingdom. Saul then gathers his own band of rats and lies about King Rat&#x27;s contribution, painting him as a coward and ensuring the rats will never again follow him. Saul makes the declaration that King Rat is not the one true leader of all rats and he is not Prince Rat, but he is one of them, Citizen Rat.
