<text>Samuel Anthony Alito Jr. ( ; born April 1, 1950) is an American jurist who serves as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He was nominated to the high court by President George W. Bush on October 31, 2005, and has served on it since January 31, 2006. After Antonin Scalia, Alito is the second Italian American justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.

Alito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and graduated from Princeton University and Yale Law School. After law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a &quot;practical originalist&quot; and is a member of the Supreme Court&#x27;s conservative bloc.

Alito has written majority opinions in the landmark cases &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot; (2010) on firearm rights, &quot;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby&quot; (2014) on insurance coverage, &quot;Janus v. AFSCME&quot; (2018) on public-sector union security agreements, and &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; (2022) on abortion.

== Early life and education ==
Alito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., a Calabrian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata. Alito&#x27;s father earned a master&#x27;s degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito&#x27;s mother was a schoolteacher.

Alito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton. He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian, subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled &quot;An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court&quot;.

At Princeton, Alito chaired a student conference in 1971 called &quot;The Boundaries of Privacy in American Society&quot;, which supported curbs on domestic intelligence gathering and anticipated the need for a statute and a court to oversee national security surveillance. The conference report itself also called for the decriminalization of sodomy, and urged for an end to discrimination against homosexual people in hiring by employers. Alito also led the American Whig-Cliosophic Society&#x27;s Debate Panel during his time at Princeton. He avoided Princeton&#x27;s eating clubs, joining Stevenson Hall instead.

In December 1969, while a sophomore at Princeton, Alito received a low lottery number of 32 in the Selective Service drawing. He became a member of the school&#x27;s Army ROTC program. Alito was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1972. He began his military duty after graduating from law school in 1975 and served on active duty from September to December while attending the Signal Officer Basic Course at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Alito was promoted to first lieutenant and captain, and completed his service obligation as a member of the inactive reserve before being honorably discharged in 1980.

At Princeton, Alito was &quot;almost alone&quot; in his familiarity with the writings of John Marshall Harlan II and was much influenced by the course on constitutional interpretation taught by Walter F. Murphy, also his faculty adviser. During his senior year at Princeton, Alito moved out of New Jersey for the first time to study in Italy, where he wrote his thesis on the Italian legal system. Graduating in 1972, Alito left a sign of his aspirations in his yearbook, which said that he hoped to &quot;eventually warm a seat on the Supreme Court&quot;.

Alito then attended Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; and earned a Juris Doctor in 1975.

== Early legal career ==
After graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977. He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired. Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey. There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry, the eldest sister of Donald Trump, later became a federal judge). While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.

From 1981 to 1985, Alito was Assistant to U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee. In that capacity he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court for the federal government. In &quot;Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists&quot; (1986), the Supreme Court ruled against Charles Fried after he rejected a memo by Alito urging the Solicitor General to avoid directly attacking the constitutional right to an abortion. Alito lost only two of the cases he argued before the Supreme Court.

From 1985 to 1987, Alito was Deputy Assistant Attorney General under Charles J. Cooper in the Office of Legal Counsel during the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese. John F. Manning worked under Alito there. Between 1986 and 1987, Alito authored nearly 470 pages of memoranda, in which he argued for expanding his client&#x27;s law enforcement and personnel authorities. In his 1985 application for Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Alito espoused conservative views, naming William F. Buckley, Jr., the &quot;National Review&quot;, Alexander Bickel, and Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign as major influences. He also expressed concern about Warren Court decisions in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.

From 1987 to 1990, Alito was the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. When he arrived, the office had begun the prosecution of 20 defendants accused of being mob affiliates of Anthony Accetturo. In August 1988, the two-year trial, then the longest federal criminal trial in history, ended in the acquittal of all 20 after less than two days of jury deliberations. Alito soon hired Michael Chertoff as his chief deputy.

After an FBI agent was shot in the line of duty in 1988, Alito personally handled the trial, assigning himself the then-novice Stuart Rabner as an assistant, and securing the shooter&#x27;s conviction. In March 1988, Alito sought a rehearing of extradition proceedings against two Indian men, represented by Ron Kuby, who were accused of being terrorist assassins, after Alito discovered that the death threats his prosecutor, Judy G. Russell, had received had been sent to her by herself. The prosecutor was later found not guilty of obstruction of justice by reason of insanity, after psychiatrists found she may have suffered from schizophrenia, with up to four distinct personalities. In 1989, Alito prosecuted a member of the Japanese Red Army for planning a terrorist bombing in Manhattan.

Alito is a member of the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers and legal students interested in conservative legal theory.

==Court of Appeals judge==
===Nomination and confirmation===
Third Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito&#x27;s judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush. On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito &quot;Well Qualified&quot; at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990, and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.

===Notable opinions===

;Abortion
* On a Third Circuit panel, the majority in &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; overturned one part of a law regulating abortion, the provision mandating that married women first inform their husbands if they sought an abortion. Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.

;Federalism
* A dissenting opinion in &quot;United States v. Rybar&quot;, 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning submachine guns was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; and thus outside the authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
* A majority opinion in &quot;Chittister v. Department of Community &amp; Economic Development&quot;, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee&#x27;s claim of wrongful termination under the Family and Medical Leave Act against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court&#x27;s dismissal of the employee&#x27;s claims.

;First Amendment
* A majority opinion in &quot;Saxe v. State College Area School District&quot;, 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district&#x27;s anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated First Amendment guarantees of free speech.
* A majority opinion in &quot;ACLU v. Schundler&quot;, 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.
* A dissenting opinion in &quot;C. H. v. Oliva&quot; (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in &quot;a less conspicuous spot&quot; of a kindergartener&#x27;s religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.

;Fourth and Eighth Amendments
*A dissenting opinion in &quot;Doe v. Groody&quot;, arguing that qualified immunity should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they strip-searched a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a search warrant that authorized the search of a residence.
*A unanimous opinion in &quot;Chadwick v. Janecka&quot; (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was &quot;no federal constitutional bar&quot; to the &quot;indefinite confinement&quot; of a man imprisoned for civil contempt because he would not pay his $2.5 million debt to his wife.

;Civil rights
*A unanimous opinion in &quot;Williams v. Price&quot;, 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of habeas corpus to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about black people during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.
* A dissenting opinion in &quot;Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Company&quot;, 34 F.3d 188 (3rd Cir. 1994), arguing that a lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence of past conduct that defendant had created a hostile and racist work environment.
* A majority opinion in &quot;Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh&quot;, 120 F.3d 1286 (3rd Cir. 1997), rejecting a female police officer&#x27;s Equal Protection-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the city and certain police officials and rejecting her Title VII-based retaliation claim against the city, but allowing her Title VII-based sexual harassment claim against the city.

==U.S. Supreme Court==

===Nomination and confirmation===


On July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts&#x27;s nomination to fill O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O&#x27;Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.

On October 31, Bush announced that he was nominating Alito to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s seat, and he submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10. Alito was unanimously rated &quot;well qualified&quot; to fill the Associate Justice post by the American Bar Association&#x27;s Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which measures the professional qualifications of a nominee. The committee rates judges as &quot;not qualified&quot;, &quot;qualified&quot;, or &quot;well qualified&quot;. Leonard Leo was selected to play a role in shepherding Alito&#x27;s appointment through the Senate.

Alito&#x27;s confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica, testified in Alito&#x27;s confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges. Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.

On January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; if that decision were to be challenged.

Democrats on the committee asked Alito about his past association with the conservative group Concerned Alumni of Princeton. Alito said that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Justice Department in order to establish his conservative credentials: &quot;You have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position.&quot; But during the confirmation hearings, he disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: &quot;I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can&#x27;t express too strongly.&quot;

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally opposed Alito&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court. The ACLU has only taken this step three other times in its entire history, opposing the nominations of William Rehnquist, Robert Bork, and Brett Kavanaugh. In releasing its report on Alito, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, &quot;At a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on Americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely, America needs a Supreme Court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties. Alito&#x27;s record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms.&quot;
Debate on the nomination began in the full Senate on January 25. After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58–42. All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation. Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day. He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American, the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office, and one of six on the Court as of 2024.

Because Alito joined the Court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the Court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases – &quot;Garcetti v. Ceballos&quot;, &quot;Hudson v. Michigan&quot;, and &quot;Kansas v. Marsh&quot; – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.

===Tenure===
Alito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in &quot;Holmes v. South Carolina&quot;, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help &quot;break in&quot; new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt. Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina&#x27;s rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution&#x27;s case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in &quot;Zedner v. United States&quot;, &quot;Woodford v. Ngo&quot;, and &quot;Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy&quot;.

In his first term, Alito compiled a fairly conservative record. For example, in the three reargued cases (&quot;Garcetti v. Ceballos&quot;, &quot;Hudson v. Michigan&quot; and &quot;Kansas v. Marsh&quot;), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on &quot;Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon&quot; and &quot;Rapanos v. United States&quot;. Alito also dissented in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; alongside Justices Scalia and Thomas.

Alito delivered the Supreme Court Historical Society&#x27;s 2008 Annual Lecture, &quot;The Origin of the Baseball Antitrust Exemption&quot;. The lecture was published in two journals.

In 2013, political scientists Alito &quot;one of the most conservative justices on the Court&quot;. While his voting record is conservative, he does not always join the opinions of the Court&#x27;s other conservative justices. On February 1, 2006, in Alito&#x27;s first decision on the Supreme Court, he voted with the majority (6–3) to refuse Missouri&#x27;s request to vacate the stay of execution issued by the Eighth Circuit for death-row inmate Michael Taylor. Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution. Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed &quot;Scalito&quot;, Alito&#x27;s views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term. A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation, Scalia was the only member of the Court in &quot;Zedner v. United States&quot; not to join a section of Alito&#x27;s opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question. In two higher-profile cases, one involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and one involving campaign finance reform (&quot;LULAC v. Perry&quot; and &quot;Randall v. Sorrell&quot;), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court. According to a SCOTUSblog analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions in which both participated, and concurred in full in 75%. Alito also differed from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes &quot;with plodding consistency&quot;, rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.

Alito&#x27;s majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case &quot;Gomez-Perez v. Potter&quot; cleared the way for federal workers who experience retaliation after filing age discrimination complaints to sue for damages. He sided with the liberal bloc of the court, inferring protection against retaliation in the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act despite the lack of an explicit provision concerning retaliation.

Alito joined Thomas in writing a separate dissent in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;. In 2020, Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas to &quot;Bostock v. Clayton County&quot;, arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination by sexual orientation or gender identity and criticizing the majority&#x27;s interpretation of Title VII. In October 2020, Alito agreed with the other justices on the denial of an appeal filed by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

On November 12, 2020, Alito made headlines for comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to the Federalist Society, Alito criticized what he called the &quot;loss of individual liberties&quot;, saying, &quot;We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020&quot; and calling the pandemic &quot;a Constitutional stress test&quot;.

Alito has called himself a &quot;practical originalist&quot; and is a member of the Court&#x27;s conservative bloc. He has been described as one of the Court&#x27;s &quot;most conservative justices&quot;.

According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, since the 2020 appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Alito has become &quot;the embodiment of a conservative majority that is ambitious and extreme&quot;, overruling progressive precedents from the 1960s and &#x27;70s that were previously out of conservatives&#x27; reach. 

Alito drew controversy in June 2024 when a filmmaker who had been posing as a conservative posted a secret recording in which he could be heard agreeing with her assertion that Christians should win &quot;the moral argument&quot; against the Left and return the country to &quot;a place of godliness&quot;. When asked about political polarization in the United States, he responded, &quot;one side or the other is going to win&quot;.

==== Abortion jurisprudence ====

In 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;. The Court had previously ruled in &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot; that a state&#x27;s ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after &quot;Stenberg&quot;, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in &quot;Roe&quot;) and O&#x27;Connor (a supporter of &quot;Roe&quot;) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the &quot;Stenberg&quot; case.

On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court&#x27;s prior decisions in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, and &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot;.

Alito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court&#x27;s prior decisions in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.

On May 2, 2022, &quot;Politico&quot; published a leak of a first draft of a majority opinion by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;. The opinion would overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with trigger laws. On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that &quot;&quot;Roe&quot; was egregiously wrong from the start&quot;, that its reasoning was &quot;exceptionally weak&quot; and that, &quot;far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue&quot;, it had &quot;enflamed debate and deepened division&quot;. In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for Notre Dame Law School&#x27;s Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome. He mocked several foreign leaders for criticizing the decision, particularly U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, referencing his pending resignation, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who had compared the ruling to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. During an October 2022 talk at The Heritage Foundation, Alito said that the leaked opinion made some justices &quot;targets for assassination&quot;, referring to the assassination attempt on fellow Justice Brett Kavanaugh during that year. At the same event, he said that &quot;questioning [the Court&#x27;s] integrity crosses an important line&quot;, which many media commentators interpreted as criticism of Kagan&#x27;s recent statements on the court&#x27;s overturning of precedent during the past term.

In November 2022, as the investigation into who had leaked the draft opinion was still ongoing, it was revealed that Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister and former anti-abortion activist, had written Roberts a letter about an alleged previous leak of a Supreme Court decision. He wrote that he had been informed of the outcome of &quot;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby&quot; weeks before the June 2014 decision, authored by Alito and favorable to anti-abortion conservatives, was officially announced. Schenck claimed to have heard of the outcome from Gayle Wright, a conservative donor, shortly after she and her husband had lunch with Alito and his wife on June 3, 2014. &quot;The New York Times&quot; claims contemporaneous emails written by Schenck &quot;strongly suggested he knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.&quot; In a statement, Alito denied having revealed the outcome or authorship of any decision before its official announcement, but did not dispute that the June 3 lunch with Wright had occurred.

On April 21, 2023, Alito dissented when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have banned mifepristone (an emergency contraception medication) nationwide.

==== Free speech jurisprudence ====

Alito has also dissented from the opinions of the Court&#x27;s conservative justices on free speech cases, one of which, &quot;Snyder v. Phelps&quot;, had to do with Westboro Baptist Church members&#x27; right to protest a military funeral. Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters &quot;were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that.&quot;

In the 2007 landmark free speech case &quot;Morse v. Frederick&quot;, Alito joined Roberts&#x27;s majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed so as not to interfere with political speech, such as discussion of the medical marijuana debate.

==Personal life==

In 1985, Alito married Martha-Ann Bomgardner, a law librarian who met him during his trips to the library as a law clerk. They have two adult children, Laura and Philip; Martha-Ann left her profession to raise them. Alito resided with his family in West Caldwell, New Jersey, before his Supreme Court nomination. He has since moved to Alexandria, Virginia.

Since Stephen Breyer&#x27;s retirement in 2022, Alito has been the only military veteran on the Court. He is a baseball fan and a longtime fan of the Philadelphia Phillies. The Phillie Phanatic was a special guest at his Supreme Court welcome dinner.

In 2013, as part of the ongoing fallout from the Edward Snowden case, former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice revealed that, during 2002 and 2003, the National Security Agency targeted Alito&#x27;s phones, and those of his staff and his family, for surveillance.

=== Teaching ===
As an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school&#x27;s Saint Thomas More Medal &quot;in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law&quot;. On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law&#x27;s commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.

As a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.

== Ethical questions ==
===Accusations of accepting gifts===
On June 20, 2023, &quot;ProPublica&quot; published an investigation of Alito&#x27;s relationship with billionaire businessman Paul Singer, focusing on a trip Alito and Singer took to a luxury fishing resort in Alaska and suggesting Alito &quot;violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts&quot;, such as private jet travel. The article said he should have recused himself in cases involving Singer and that he was obligated to disclose certain benefits as gifts on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report. Legal ethics experts quoted in &quot;ProPublica&quot; called Alito&#x27;s behavior &quot;unacceptable&quot;. 

Shortly before publication of the Propublica article, Alito published an op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; challenging the article&#x27;s assertions and claiming that the source &quot;misleads its readers&quot;. His preemptory challenge maintained that &quot;ProPublica&quot;&#x27;s charges were invalid. Alito further contended that because of an exemption in the Court&#x27;s reporting rules for &quot;personal hospitality&quot;, he was not required to disclose private air transport for social trips. His unconventional decision to bypass reporters&#x27; questions and preempt the story via a separate publication took &quot;ProPublica&quot;&#x27;s reporters by surprise. The decision to publish the op-ed was criticized both within the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and by media critics, in part because it lacked fact-checking.

The &quot;ProPublica&quot; report on unreported gifts to both Alito and Thomas led several members of Congress to call for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. This included a Senate Judiciary Committee proposal to establish a code of ethics for the Court. In a July 2023 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; opinion column, Alito wrote, &quot;Congress did not create the Supreme Court [...] I know this is a controversial view, but I&#x27;m willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.&quot; This declaration led to further debate among lawmakers. Senator Chris Murphy said the Constitution gives Congress power to oversee the Court: &quot;It is just wrong on the facts to say that Congress doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the rules guiding the Supreme Court. In fact, from the very beginning, Congress has set those rules.&quot;

===Flag display controversy===
On January 17, 2021, an upside-down American flag was flown outside Alito&#x27;s residence in Alexandria, Virginia. The upside-down flag, traditionally a signal of distress, was displayed by supporters of former president Donald Trump during the January 6 Capitol attack and by members of the Stop the Steal movement, an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. In the summer of 2023, the Pine Tree Flag was flown at Alito&#x27;s beach house on Long Beach Island in New Jersey. It was one of the flags used during the American Revolution, and has been used by Christian nationalists; it was also carried during the Capitol attack. The flag displays, reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, caused controversy, including questions about judicial impartiality. During the flag&#x27;s presence, the Supreme Court was considering the appeal in &quot;United States v. Fischer&quot; (2023), a case involving the January 6 Capitol attack.

A secret recording by advocacy journalist Lauren Windsor captured Martha-Ann Alito discussing the event in June 2024. Martha-Ann Alito said, &quot;I want a Sacred Heart of Jesus flag because I have to look across the lagoon at the Pride flag for the next month&quot;, adding that she would be &quot;changing the flags&quot; when her husband was &quot;free of this nonsense&quot; and that she would come with her own flag, which would be white with yellow and orange flames and read &quot;vergogna&quot; (&quot;shame&quot; in Italian). She also told Windsor that she would &quot;get&quot; &quot;the media&quot;, adding: &quot;Look at me. Look at me. I&#x27;m German, from Germany. My heritage is German. You come after me, I&#x27;m going to give it back to you&quot;.

Reactions were mixed, with most Democrats condemning Alito and most Republicans defending him. Senate Committee on the Judiciary chairman Dick Durbin requested Alito&#x27;s recusal from cases involving the January 6 Capitol attack or the 2020 presidential election. House Committee on the Judiciary member Steve Cohen introduced a resolution to censure Alito. Forty-five representatives, joined by ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Hank Johnson, signed a letter requesting Alito&#x27;s recusal. Senator Tom Cotton called the controversy an intimidation attempt, while Senator Lindsey Graham said hoisting the upside-down flag was &quot;not good judgment&quot;.

Alito responded that he had no involvement in hoisting either flag, saying: &quot;I was not even aware of the upside-down flag until it was called to my attention&quot; and &quot;I was not familiar with the Appeal to Heaven flag when my wife flew it&quot;. In an interview with Fox News, he reiterated that the flag was flown in response to a dispute with a neighbor, clarifying that his wife was upset about a &quot;Fuck Trump&quot; sign. He told Fox News host Shannon Bream that the neighbor blamed him for the January 6 Capitol attack and called his wife a &quot;cunt&quot;.

Senior U.S. District Judge Michael Ponsor of Massachusetts called Alito&#x27;s flag-flying &quot;improper&quot; in an essay published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Ponsor later apologized after Chief Judge Albert Diaz of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that his remarks hurt public confidence in the courts by taking issue with Alito&#x27;s ethics.

<doc id="1199176" wikidata="Q1068389" url="?curid=1199176" title="Illinois Route 50">
<text>Illinois Route 50 (IL 50) is a north–south state highway in northeastern Illinois. It runs from the junction with U.S. Route 45 (US 45) and U.S. Route 52 (US 52) in West Kankakee north to US 41 in Skokie. In Chicago and the suburbs, it is known as Cicero Avenue. Before this, Cicero Avenue was previously known as 48th Avenue, owing to its City of Chicago address of 4800 West.

==Route description==
IL 50 begins in Kankakee at an intersection with Southeast Avenue (US 45/US 52) and heads north as Schuyler Avenue. The four-lane road crosses the Kankakee River and then turns east onto East River Street before turning north onto a one-way pair of Harrison Avenue northbound and Indiana Avenue southbound. While on this one-way pair, IL 50 crosses two railroads, then turns east onto Fair Street and crosses a third. After crossing the railroads, the roadway curves in a northerly direction and becomes Hobbie Avenue before it enters Bradley.

In Bradley, the road is known as Kinzie Avenue, and it continues due north, meeting a diamond interchange with Interstate 57 (I-57), then leaving the city. North of the city, IL 50 begins to parallel a railroad. It bends to the northeast, crosses the southern branch of Rock Creek, and passes through Manteno. Northeast of Manteno, the highway leaves Kankakee County and crosses into Will County. Still paralleling the railroad and I-57, IL 50 passes through Peotone and heads toward Monee. In Monee, the route dips to the north and crosses the railroad, then crosses into University Park. Here the route is known as Governors Highway. It curves north before leaving the city and Will County, crossing into urban Cook County.

Upon crossing into Cook County, IL 50 enters Richton Park. From here northward the road is known as Cicero Avenue. It passes straight through Richton Park and into Matteson. In Matteson, IL 50 meets Lincoln Highway (US 30). The route then continues due north through the remainder of Matteson, through the Southern Green Belt Forest Preserve, and into Country Club Hills. Continuing north through Country Club Hills, IL 50 crosses under I-80, then under I-57, without access to either highway. Just north of I-57, IL 50 curves slightly to the northwest, leaves Country Club Hills and enters Oak Forest. The route continues northward in Oak Forest, intersecting 159th Street (US 6). North of the US 6 intersection, the highway crosses into Midlothian, where it intersects IL 83 south at 149th Street.

IL 50 and IL 83 head north and enter Crestwood. In the northern part of this city, IL 83 splits off to the northwest at an intersection with Cal Sag Road, while IL 50 continues heading north and crosses the Little Calumet River into Alsip. Here, the highway shares an interchange with I-294 (Tri-State Tollway), then continues due north into Oak Lawn. In Oak Lawn, IL 50 meets US 12 and US 20 at 95th Street, then continues north and leaves the city. Around 79th street, It begins to parallel Illinois Route 171 and Illinois Route 43 to the west. It parallels Illinois 171 until its terminus at Illinois Route 72 and Illinois Route 43 for the duration of the route. Continuing north, the highway enters Chicago entirely and serves Chicago Midway International Airport, then meets I-55 (Stevenson Expressway) at a diamond interchange.

North of the interchange with I-55, IL 50 crosses the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal, leaving Chicago and entering Cicero. The route re-enters Chicago a short distance later, meeting I-290 (Dwight D. Eisenhower Expressway) just north of the boundary. Heading north through the western portion of the city, the highway intersects IL 64 and IL 19 before crossing under I-90 (Kennedy Expressway) without access. Continuing north, IL 50 meets I-94 (Edens Expressway) at an interchange in which IL 50 has no access to I-94, and only traffic travelling eastbound on I-94 can access IL 50 southbound. The route then crosses the north branch of the Chicago River and intersects US 14 at Peterson Avenue. North of this intersection, the highway leaves Chicago and passes through Lincolnwood. It then continues north to its northern terminus at Lincoln Avenue (US 41) in Skokie.

<text>The Panhard ERC (&quot;Engin à Roues, Canon&quot;; &quot;Wheeled vehicle, cannon&quot;) is a French six-wheeled armoured car which is highly mobile and amphibious with an option of being NBC-proof. Two versions of the ERC entered production in large numbers: the &quot;ERC-90 Lynx&quot; and the &quot;ERC-90 Sagaie&quot;. The main difference between the two versions is the type of turret and 90 mm gun fitted. &quot;Sagaie&quot; is French for assegai, a type of African spear.

==Background==
The ERC was originally a private venture aimed at the export market. It was developed by Panhard in the latter half of the 1970s as a heavier, six-wheeled successor to Panhard&#x27;s highly successful AML range of armoured vehicles.

===Design===
The ERC and VCR are a family of six wheel armoured reconnaissance vehicles. The ERC is the cannon-armed turret model. The VCR is the armoured personnel carrier version. ERC is the French abbreviation of term &quot;Engin à Roues, Canon&quot; or Gun-armed Wheeled Vehicle. The ERC shares many components of the VCR vehicles. Two main versions of the ERC were developed: first the ERC F1 90 &quot;Lynx&quot;, then the ERC F4 90 &quot;Sagaie&quot;. The &quot;Lynx&quot; appeared about 1977 and the &quot;Sagaie&quot; followed approximately two years later in 1979. The &quot;Lynx&quot; was developed primarily as an armoured reconnaissance vehicle. The &quot;Sagaie&quot; was also an armoured reconnaissance vehicle, with the added secondary role of tank-destroyer.

In 1977, Panhard offered the ERC and VCR to the French Army as an armoured personnel carrier (APC) and gun-armed reconnaissance vehicle. The Army instead chose the VAB four-wheeled armoured vehicle from Saviem for the larger APC contract, and the AMX 10 RC from GIAT for the reconnaissance requirement. Panhard also offered the vehicles to France&#x27;s Mobile Gendarmerie, a much smaller order, but the Gendarmerie chose the Saviem VBC-90. Panhard later found success for both the VRC and ERC in the world export market, and later with the ERC version with the French Army, entering service in 1984.

===Production history===

The first production order for the ERC 90 F1 &quot;Lynx&quot; was in October 1979 from Argentina, for 36 units, to be used by Argentine Marines to patrol the long border between Argentina and Chile. The second large order was from Mexico, for 42 units in early 1981. Both countries ordered the ERC &quot;Lynx&quot; version because it could elevate or depress its 90mm cannon over a wider range for operations in steep mountain terrain.

Further export orders followed. Both nations also appreciated the all-terrain mobility of the &quot;Lynx&quot; which is enhanced by the capability to raise or lower the central pair of wheels depending on terrain condition, especially in sandy or muddy ground. All versions of the ERC are also equipped with two hydrojets behind the rear wheels and require no preparation for amphibious operations.

===ERC 90 F4 &quot;Sagaie&quot;===
Shortly after the ERC 90 F1 Lynx had been built for export, Panhard recognized the need for a cost-effective light armoured vehicle that could defeat a more modern main battle tank (MBT), like the Russian T-72, which was being exported to many nations. The &quot;Lynx&quot; version could only fire medium-velocity HEAT rounds in the anti-tank role, which lacked the penetration to defeat the more modern MBTs. Panhard designed a turret which mounted the long barrel F4 90mm smooth bore-cannon developed by GIAT, and designated the vehicle the ERC 90 F4 &quot;Sagaie&quot;.

The F4 90mm could fire APFSDS (Armour Piercing Fin Stabilised Discarding Sabot) rounds at a much higher velocity than the Lynx&#x27;s F1 90mm. GIAT and Panhard both claimed it could penetrate heavy armour at 2,000 metres. For a while, GIAT engineers could not find a suitable muzzle brake for the &quot;Sagaie&quot; which would not interfere with the firing of APFSDS rounds, but found a suitable solution using a muzzle brake design from the older AMX-13 tank.

Ivory Coast was the first export customer, ordering five &quot;Sagaies&quot; to replace its aging AMX-13s in the light armour role. At the time, the French Army was organising the Fast Deployment Force (FDF) for overseas military missions, mainly in Africa or the Middle East. The main core of the FDF was the French Army&#x27;s 9th Marine Infantry Division and the 11th Parachute Division. To make the new FDF &quot;more muscular&quot; a new unit was activated, the 31st Heavy Half Brigade (31 DBL), with two regiments. One regiment was to be armed with vehicles mounting the HOT wire-guided missile, and the other with cannon-armed vehicles that could provide both reconnaissance and a limited tank-killing role.

The French Army had at first planned on equipping the second regiment with the AMX-10RC, but were told that this vehicle was not suitable for transport by the French Air Force Transall C-160 or its allies&#x27; Hercules C-130 aircraft, due to size and weight issues. In addition, most of the bridges in Africa had only a 6 to 8 ton load capacity. So instead of the larger AMX-10RC, which was already in service with the French Army, the French Army Staff took the surprise step in December 1980 of ordering the &quot;Sagaie&quot; for the future FDF. To date, the &quot;Sagaie&quot; has proved very useful for the French Army in its African bases and even in urban conditions during the Siege of Sarajevo. The last known combat uses of the &quot;Sagaie&quot; were with French troops stationed in Ivory Coast on a peace-keeping mission between two rival factions, and in Mali in 2013.

==== Sagaie upgrade ====
The French Army has upgraded 160 of its 192 ERC&#x27;s in service with a diesel MTU 4-cylinder 170 hp engine, coupled to an automatic gearbox made by Renk and have made enhancements to the turret to improve observation, fire control and command.

===ERC-90 &quot;Sagaie 2&quot; (twin-engine)===
A weakness of the Sagaie is its low power-to-weight ratio. The Sagaie 2 is an ERC, extended with two Peugeot XD 3T four-cylinder turbocharged diesel 98 hp engines, the same engine used on the VBL (Light Armoured Vehicle). Six were ordered by Gabon. A prototype equipped with two PRV V6 engines was built as a private venture, but none were ordered.

<doc id="1199196" wikidata="Q1014108" url="?curid=1199196" title="Mbala, Zambia">
<text>Mbala is Zambia&#x27;s most northerly large town and seat of Mbala District in Northern Province, occupying a strategic location close to the border with Tanzania and controlling the southern approaches to Lake Tanganyika, 40 km by road to the north-west, where the port of Mpulungu is located. It had a population of about 20,000 in 2006. Under the name Abercorn, Mbala was a key outpost in British colonial control of this part of south-central Africa.

== History ==
A number of archaeological sites in the area (such as at Kalambo Falls) provides a record of human activity in the Mbala area over the past 300,000 years.

Before colonial times, Mbala was the village of Chief Zombe on the Lucheche River. It became the focus of British interest as a result of travels by the explorer David Livingstone, the first European to visit the area, in the 1860s. He was followed some years later by Verney Lovett Cameron who surveyed Lake Tanganyika. Livingstone inspired missionaries of the London Missionary Society to come in the 1880s to Niamkolo on the lake and Fwambo and Kawimbe on the plateau. These missions had links to the African Lakes Company which later set up in Mbala and Mpulungu. The area was ravaged by the slave trade during much of the 19th Century, and the African Lakes Company devoted some efforts to trying to stamp it out. This activity drew in the representative of the British Government in the region, Harry Johnston in Nyasaland, and decisions were taken to strengthen the imperial presence south of the lake and prevent other colonial powers establishing a foothold there.
As a result, the colonial era began in Mbala in 1893, earlier than in most other areas of what would become Zambia, when Hugh Marshall was sent by Johnston as the British Consul for the area. Marshall built a well-fortified boma at Chief Zombe&#x27;s village and acted as Magistrate and Postmaster. In 1895 the British South Africa Company took over administration of the territory, called it North-Eastern Rhodesia, and the &#x27;Zombe boma&#x27; became known as Abercorn, named after the company chairman. The site was favoured by British administrators as being healthy and having a pleasant climate with plenty of hunting and fishing. Until German East Africa was taken over by Britain in 1919 as Tanganyika, Abercorn and the smaller Chiengi boma on Lake Mweru were the most northerly outposts of British southern Africa. During World War I Mbala was a focus of the unsuccessful British military effort to defeat German General von Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s German army, and British forces were concentrated there. After Germany&#x27;s surrender in Europe, von Lettow-Vorbeck formally surrendered at Mbala on 25 November 1918, though he had agreed a ceasefire at the Chambeshi River 250 km south nine days earlier. The Mbala War Memorial marks the spot of the formal surrender about 2 km south-west of the centre of town. Following the surrender ceremony, the German troops were ordered to throw their weapons into Lake Chila.

Polish refugees from General Anders&#x27; army arrived there during World War 2 and were housed in a camp. A cemetery with Polish tombstones testifies to their past presence.

After Zambia&#x27;s independence in 1964, the name of the town was changed back to Mbala.

Since its heyday as a colonial town in the 1950s and early 60s, Mbala has suffered some decline, and has lost out in development terms to the provincial capital, Kasama, and Mpika, which have better road and rail connections. Although the Mbala area has fertile soils and plenty of water, it is far from urban markets and transport costs limited the viability of most agricultural crops. Similarly, while it has tourist potential it is a bit too far off the main tourist routes and the poor state of the main highway and the lack of regular air services discourage visitors. There is one hotel but no resorts in the immediate area, the nearest being those in Nsumbu National Park such as Kasaba Bay, 100 km away, but there is no road link there − in fact the lack of a road serving the south-western side of the lake, which is mountainous, is a serious barrier to tourism or to any development there. Kalambo Falls is an attraction, but is not accessible throughout the rainy season. Wars and unrest on the eastern and northern shores of Lake Tanganyika have also hindered trade and tourism on the lake, which has not given Mbala and Mpulungu the advantages of their location. With recent steps towards resolution of those conflicts, the future may be brighter. The population was 16,963 in the 2000 census.

== Geography and transport ==
The town is at the edge of the plateau covering most of Zambia, at an elevation of 1670 m, about 900 m higher than Lake Tanganyika, which comes within 22 km (straight-line distance). The escarpment above the lake is the end of the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East Africa Rift, and the Mbala area experiences occasional earth tremors. It is also said that the tiny but picturesque Lake Chila within the town experiences inexplicable drying out, and sudden flooding from underground springs, but this may be just a legend.

The second highest waterfall in Africa, Kalambo Falls lies about 40 km (by road) north west, and is formed where the Kalambo River comes over the Rift Valley escarpment.

Mbala is on the old Great North Road (M1 road) 165 km north of Kasama, and at one time was the end of that road. It has been paved and as of late 2008 is in poor condition, with large patches of pavement missing, and stretches have reverted to a dirt road. However, work crews were patching the road in late 2008, with one crew starting in Kasama, and the other starting from Mbala. Since it is the only paved highway access to the town and district, as well as to the port of Mpulungu, its poor condition is a major barrier to development in the area. Buses run daily from Mbala to Kasama and Lusaka, the capital.

Mbala is 25 km from the border with Tanzania and connected by a dry-season road to one of only two road border crossings between the two countries. It is not much used, the road beyond the border is a dirt track impassable in the rainy season.

The paved road which winds down the escarpment to Mpulungu (the M2 road) affords scenic views and passes close to Lunzua Falls. From Mpulungu the MV Liemba provides a boat service to other ports and countries on the lake. In the 19th century the lake was an important entry point to the territory of northern Zambia, by boat from Ujiji, which was reached by an overland trade route from the Indian Ocean coast near the island of Zanzibar.

Mbala has an airport but does not currently receive scheduled services, though it has a 2.6 km runway and was once a Zambian Air Force Base.

=== Climate ===
Mbala features a climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;/&quot;Cwa&quot;) with consistently mild temperatures and clear wet and dry seasons. The wet season, from November to April, experiences high humidity and significant rainfall, whereas the dry season, from May to October, is marked by minimal precipitation.

<text>The Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (; KNIL, ; ) was the military force maintained by the Kingdom of the Netherlands in its colony of the Dutch East Indies, in areas that are now part of Indonesia. The KNIL&#x27;s air arm was the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force. Elements of the Royal Netherlands Navy and Government Navy were also stationed in the Netherlands East Indies.

==History==
===1814–1942===
The KNIL was formed by royal decree on 14 September 1814. It was not part of the Royal Netherlands Army, but a separate military arm specifically formed for service in the Netherlands East Indies. Its establishment coincided with the Dutch drive to expand colonial rule from the 17th century area of control to the far larger territories constituting the Dutch East Indies seventy years later.

The KNIL was involved in many campaigns against indigenous groups in the area including the Padri War (1821–1845), the Java War (1825–1830), crushing the final resistance of Bali inhabitants to colonial rule in 1849, and the prolonged Aceh War (1873–1904). In 1894, Lombok and Karangasem were annexed in response to reports of the local Balinese aristocracy oppressing the native Sasak people. Bali was finally taken under full control with the Dutch intervention in Bali (1906) and the final Dutch intervention in Bali (1908).

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the KNIL resumed the conquest of the Indonesian archipelago. After 1904 the Netherlands East Indies were considered pacified, with no large-scale armed opposition to Dutch rule until World War II, and the KNIL served a mainly defensive role protecting the Dutch East Indies from the possibility of foreign invasion.

Once the archipelago was considered pacified the KNIL was mainly involved with military policing tasks. To ensure a sizeable European military segment in the KNIL and reduce costly recruitment in Europe, the colonial government introduced obligatory military service for all resident male conscripts in the European legal class in 1917. In 1922 a supplemental legal enactment introduced the creation of the Home Guard () for European conscripts older than 32.

===World War II===

Dutch forces in the Netherlands East Indies were severely weakened by the defeat and occupation of the Netherlands itself, by Nazi Germany, in 1940. The KNIL was cut off from external Dutch assistance, except by Royal Netherlands Navy units. The KNIL, hastily and inadequately, attempted to transform into a modern military force able to protect the Dutch East Indies from foreign invasion. By December 1941, Dutch forces in Indonesia numbered around 85,000 personnel: regular troops consisted of about 1,000 officers and 34,000 enlisted soldiers, of whom 28,000 were indigenous. The remainder were made up of locally organised militia, territorial guard units and civilian auxiliaries. The KNIL air force, (Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force; ML-KNIL) numbered 389 planes of all types, but was largely outclassed by superior Japanese planes. The Royal Netherlands Navy Air Service, or MLD, also had significant forces in the NEI.

During the Dutch East Indies campaign of 1941–42, by forces of the Empire of Japan, most of the KNIL and other Allied forces were quickly defeated. Most European soldiers, which in practice included all able bodied Indo-European males, were interned by the Japanese as POWs. 25% of the POWs did not survive their internment.

A handful of soldiers, mostly indigenous personnel, mounted guerrilla campaigns against the Japanese. These were usually unknown to, and unassisted by, the Allies until the end of the war.

During early 1942, some KNIL personnel escaped to Australia. Some indigenous personnel were interned in Australia under suspicion of sympathies with the Japanese. The remainder began a long process of re-grouping. In late 1942, a failed attempt to land in East Timor, to reinforce Australian commandos waging a guerrilla campaign ended with the loss of 60 Dutch personnel.

Four &quot;Netherlands East Indies&quot; squadrons (the RAAF-NEI squadrons) were formed from ML-KNIL personnel, under the auspices of the Royal Australian Air Force, with Australian ground staff.

KNIL infantry forces (much like their counterparts in the UK), were augmented by recruitment among Dutch expatriates around the world and by colonial troops from as far away as the Dutch West Indies. During 1944–45, some small units saw action in the New Guinea campaign and Borneo campaign.

Just south of Casino, New South Wales, a camp was established in 1942 for a KNIL Technical Battalion. Upon the declaration of the Indonesian Republic, the Dutch soldiers in that battalion interned and imprisoned 500 of their Indonesian native comrades within the camp. Harsh treatment and penalties were issued out by the Dutch on any independence seeking soldiers. This led to the deaths of two KNIL native soldiers; one was a possible suicide and the other was a protest leader. This brought about condemnation from Australian locals, who forced the Australian authorities to repatriate all the imprisoned soldiers, despite being reluctant to heed earlier requests for assistance.

===1945–1950===
Following World War II, the KNIL was used in two large military campaigns in 1947 and 1948 to re-establish Dutch control of Indonesia. During the Indonesian War of Independence the KNIL trained the Dutch-born conscripts that arrived in the Dutch East Indies and made them familiar with the way how battles were fought in the colony. The KNIL and its Ambonese auxiliaries have been accused of committing war crimes during this &quot;police action&quot;. Dutch efforts to re-establish their colony failed and Netherlands recognition of Indonesian sovereignty came on 27 December 1949. On 26 January 1950, elements of the KNIL were involved in an abortive coup in Bandung planned by Raymond Westerling and Sultan Hamid II. The coup failed and only accelerated the dissolution of the federal Republic of the United States of Indonesia.

The KNIL was disbanded by 26 July 1950 with its indigenous personnel being given the option of demobilising or joining the newly formed Indonesian military. However, efforts to integrate former KNIL units were impeded by mutual distrust between the predominantly Ambonese KNIL troops and the Javanese-dominated Republican military, leading to clashes at Makassar in April and the attempted secession of an independent Republic of South Maluku (RMS) in July. These revolts were suppressed by November 1950 and approximately 12,500 Ambonese KNIL personnel and their families opted for temporary resettlement in the Netherlands. Following this, the KNIL ceased to exist but its traditions are maintained by the Regiment Van Heutsz of the modern Royal Netherlands Army. At the time of disbandment the KNIL numbered 65,000, of whom 26,000 were incorporated into the new Indonesian Army and should be received with the same rank. Some of them later in the 70s reached the rank of Major General in Indonesian Army. It is estimated that around 39,000 of the remaining KNIL troops who majority of whom came from Ambon, took the option of retiring or joining the Royal Dutch Armed Forces and serving in Papua or Suriname. Some of them were involved in the Dutch contingent in Korean War (1950–1953).

==Recruiting==

During its formation, it was stated that the KNIL would include both European and indigenous soldiers. In the beginning the KNIL was equally divided, which meant that half the army consisted of European soldiers, while the other half was made up of indigenous soldiers. However, starting from the late 1830s the ratio between European soldiers and indigenous soldiers went from 1:1 to 1:3. The reason for this was that there were not enough European volunteers to keep up with the recruitment of indigenous soldiers. Besides European volunteers and indigenous recruits the KNIL also recruited foreign mercenaries of several nationalities during the 19th century. During the protracted Aceh War the numbers of European troops were kept to 12,000 but continued Achenese resistance necessitated the deployment of up to 23,000 indigenous soldiers (mainly from Java, Ambon, and Manado). Even slaves of the Ashanti (Ivory Coast and Ghana) were recruited in limited numbers for service in the East Indies (see Belanda Hitam). The ratio of foreign and indigenous troops to those of Dutch origin was reported to be 60% to 40%. After the Aceh War, the enlistment of non-Dutch European troops ceased and the KNIL came to consist of Dutch regulars recruited in the Netherlands itself, Indonesians, Indos (Eurasians), and Dutch colonists living in the East Indies and undertaking their military service.

In 1884 personnel strength was numbered at 13,492 European, 14,982 Indonesian, 96 African (though some sources put the number of Africans much higher ) and at least 1,666 Eurasian recruits. The officer corps was wholly European and was probably close to 1,300. There were also about 1,300 horses. Recruitment was carried out in the Netherlands and Indonesia, with over 1,000 Dutch subjects and 500 foreigners enlisting annually. The foreign troops consisted of Flemish, German, Swiss, and French volunteers. Walloons, Arabs, and nationals of both the United Kingdom and United States were forbidden from serving. Other foreigners who could not prove fluency in either Dutch or German were also not accepted for service.

It was against the law to send Dutch conscripts from the Netherlands to the East Indies but Dutch volunteers continued to enlist for colonial service in the KNIL. In 1890 a Colonial Reserve Corps (Koloniale Reserve) was established in the Netherlands itself to recruit and train these volunteers and to re-integrate them into Dutch society upon the conclusion of their overseas service. On the eve of the Japanese invasion in December 1941, Dutch regular troops in the East Indies consisted of about 1,000 officers and 34,000 men, of whom 28,000 were indigenous. The largest proportion of these &quot;native troops&quot; had always consisted of Javanese and Sundanese soldiers. During the Japanese occupation, most of the Dutch and Ambonese personnel were interned in POW camps.

During the Indonesian National Revolution, the KNIL&#x27;s officers were still largely Dutch and Eurasians although most of its troops were recruited from predominantly Indonesian Christian ethnicities, particularly Batak, Moluccas, Timor and Manado. Although there were smaller numbers of Javanese, Sundanese, Sumatran and other Muslim troops in Dutch service, these received comparatively lower rates of pay than their Christian counterparts, leading to resentment and distrust. The Dutch sought to take advantage of these ethnic tensions by claiming that the Ambonese would lose their special privileges and pensions under a Javanese-dominated government. As noted above, these factors contributed to clashes between demobilised KNIL units and the Republic of Indonesia&#x27;s military throughout 1950.

<text>Bruce &quot;Tog&quot; Tognazzini (born 1945) is an American usability consultant and designer. He is a partner in the Nielsen Norman Group, which specializes in human-computer interaction. He was an early employee of Apple Computer, staying with the company for fourteen years, then he was with Sun Microsystems for four years, then WebMD for another four years. 

He has written two books, &quot;Tog on Interface&quot; and &quot;Tog on Software Design&quot;, published by Addison-Wesley, and he publishes the webzine &quot;Asktog&quot;, with the tagline &quot;Interaction Design Solutions for the Real World&quot;.

==Background==
Tog (as he is known in computer circles) built his first electro-mechanical computer in 1957, landing a job in 1959 working with the world&#x27;s first check-reading computer, NCR&#x27;s ERMA (Electronic Recording Method of Accounting), at Bank of America, in San Francisco.

Tog was an early employee of Apple Computer starting in 1978. In June 1978, Steve Jobs, having seen one of Tog&#x27;s early programs, The Great American Probability Machine, had Jef Raskin hire him as Apple&#x27;s first applications software engineer. He&#x27;s listed on the back of his book &quot;Tog on Interface&quot; (Addison Wesley, 1991) as &quot;Apple Employee #66&quot; (the same employee number he held later at WebMD).

In his early days at Apple, simultaneous with his developing Apple&#x27;s first human interface, for the Apple II computer, he published &quot;Super Hi-Res Chess&quot;, a novelty program for the Apple II that, despite its name, did not play chess or have any hi-res (high-resolution) graphics; instead, it seemed to crash to the Applesoft BASIC prompt with an error message, but was actually a parody of Apple&#x27;s BASIC command line interface that seemingly took over control of one&#x27;s computer, refusing to give it back until the magic word was discovered.

His work in user-interface testing and design, including publishing the first edition, in September, 1978, and seven subsequent editions of &quot;The Apple Human Interface Guidelines&quot;, played an important role in the direction of Apple&#x27;s product line from the early days of Apple into the 1990s. (Steve Smith and Chris Espinosa also played a key role, incorporating the initial material on the Lisa and Macintosh computers in the fourth and fifth editions in the early 1980s.) 

He and his partner, John David Eisenberg, wrote &quot;Apple Presents...Apple&quot;, the disk that taught new Apple II owners how to use the computer. This disk became a self-fulfilling prophecy: At the time of its authoring, there was no standard Apple II interface. Because new owners were all being taught Tog and David&#x27;s interface, developers soon began writing to it, aided by Tog&#x27;s Apple Human Interface Guidelines, and reinforced by AppleWorks, a suite of productivity applications for the Apple II into which Tog had also incorporated the same interface.

Others often report him as one of the fathers of the Macintosh interface, a claim he has always been careful to refute. Although he did consult with Jef Raskin in the early days of the Macintosh, during the later, critical development period of the Mac, he was assigned to scale down the Lisa interface, not for the Mac, but for the Apple II. Although he and James Batson were able to develop a viable interface for the Apple II that matched the mousing speed of the much faster Macintosh, the Apple executive staff elected not to ship a mouse with the Apple II for fear of cannibalizing Macintosh sales.

It was only after Steve Jobs&#x27; early departure from Apple, in 1985, that Tog came to oversee the interface for both machines. During this period, Tog was responsible for the design of the Macintosh&#x27;s hierarchical menus and invented time-out dialog boxes, which, after a visible countdown, carry out the default activity without the user explicitly clicking. He also invented the &quot;package&quot; illusion later used by Apple for Macintosh applications: Applications, along with all their supporting files, reside inside a &quot;package&quot; that, in turn, appears to be the application itself, appearing as an application icon, not as a folder. This illusion makes possible the simple drag-and-drop installation and deletion of Mac applications. Tog left Apple in 1992.

While working at Sun Microsystems, in 1992 and 1993, he produced the Starfire video prototype, in order to give an idea of a usability centered vision of the Office of the future. The video predicted the rise of a new technology that would become known as the World Wide Web. Popular Science Magazine reported, in March 2009, that Microsoft had just produced a new video showing life in the year 2019: &quot;The 2019 Microsoft details with this video is almost identical to the 2004 predicted in this video produced by Sun Microsystems in 1992.&quot;

While at Sun Microsystems, Tog also filed for 58 US patents, with 57 issued in the areas of aviation safety, GPS, and human-computer interaction. Among them is US Patent 6278660, the time-zone-tracking wristwatch with built-in GPS and simple time-zone maps that sets itself using the GPS satellite&#x27;s atomic clock and re-sets itself automatically whenever crossing into a new time zone.

In 2000, after his four-year stint at WebMD, Tog joined his colleagues as the third principal at the Nielsen Norman Group, along with Jakob Nielsen and Don Norman.

<text>Ndola is the third largest city in Zambia in terms of size and population, with a population of 627,503 (&quot;2022 census&quot;), after the capital, Lusaka, and Kitwe, and the second largest in terms of infrastructure development after Lusaka. It is the industrial and commercial center of the Copperbelt, Zambia&#x27;s copper-mining region, and capital of Copperbelt Province. It lies just from the border with DR Congo. It is also home to Zambia&#x27;s first modern stadium, the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium.
==History==

What is now Ndola was first inhabited by the Lamba people led by Senior Chief Chiwala, the Lamba people migrated from the Luba-Lunda kingdom around 1600 and the town of Ndola was under Chief Mushili for some time but now it is under Chief Chiwala who came to the Lambaland during the slave trade from Malawi. The name Ndola is derived from the river, which originates in the Kaloko Hills and drains in the Kafubu River.

The town of Ndola was founded in 1904 by John Edward &quot;Chiripula&quot; Stephenson. It was started as a boma and trading post, which laid its foundations as an administrative and trading centre today.

The Rhodesia Railways main line reached the town in 1907, providing passenger services as far south as Bulawayo, with connections to Cape Town.
The line was extended into DR Congo and from there eventually linked to the Benguela Railway to the Atlantic port of Lobito (which took some of Zambia&#x27;s copper exports for many years with recent interruptions by closures; the rail line is now back in service). The Ndola railhead was responsible for the town becoming the country&#x27;s centre of distribution. Before the road network was built up in the 1930s, a track from Ndola to Kapalala on the Luapula River, and boat transport from there to the Chambeshi River was the principal trade route for the Northern Province, which consequently formed part of Ndola&#x27;s hinterland.

In 1961, an aeroplane carrying key United Nations figures, including the organisation&#x27;s second Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, crashed on the outskirts of Ndola.

==Climate==
Ndola has a moderate humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa).

== Demography ==
==Industry==
===Legacy===
Once the largest industrial centre of Zambia, boasting, among many high-powered sites, company facilities including a Land Rover vehicle assembly plant, Dunlop Tire manufacture, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Unilever, Ndola&#x27;s economy shrank significantly between 1980 and 2000. Many closed factories and plants lie unoccupied in the town. A number of former industries such as clothing and vehicle assembly have disappeared completely. Even though the term &#x27;ghost town&#x27; can no longer apply to it, Ndola is yet to regain its economic glory of pre-1980 days.

===Refining===
There are no mines in Ndola itself, but the Bwana Mkubwa open-cast mine is only 10 km south-east of the city centre. Until their closure, copper and precious metals used to be brought from elsewhere in the Copperbelt for processing at the Ndola Copper Refinery and Precious Metals Refinery. Copper exports provide 70–80% of Zambia&#x27;s export earnings, making the city very important to the country&#x27;s economy.

The Indeni Oil Refinery in Ndola supplies the whole country with refined petroleum. It was repaired in 2001 after being severely damaged by fire in 1999. GL Africa Energy, through its subsidiary Ndola Energy Company Limited, provides 105MW of power to the National Grid of Zambia. Power is generated from heavy fuel oil supplied by the Indeni Petroleum refinery.

===Commercial===
Ndola is home to one of the country&#x27;s national newspapers, the &quot;Times of Zambia&quot;, as well as its printer, Printpak. These run as one company called &quot;TimesPrintpak&quot;. Catholic church run printing press, &quot;Mission Press&quot;, is also located in Ndola. Mission Press operates as a commercial entity.

===Limestone===
Ndola has huge limestone reserves which are believed to be among the most homogeneous of their kind in the world. Limestone has therefore become to Ndola&#x27;s economy what copper is to the rest of the country, providing much of the wealth and employment (Lime is a major component in the production of cement; a cement plant getting its lime from limestone and manufacturing a limestone cement will consume well over 80 kg limestone per 100 kg of cement produced).

Between 1974 and 2009, Ndola supplied over 50% of Zambia&#x27;s cement from a plant located some 5 km south-east of the heart of the city. This plant was called Chilanga Cement, Ndola Works. The parent company then was Chilanga Cement plc. Chilanga Cement ran two plants in Zambia: one built in 1949 at Chilanga (hence the parent company name) and the other built in 1969 at Ndola. In 2008, the new holding company, Lafarge Cement Zambia, completed construction of a brand new plant at Chilanga which would produce about double the volume of Ndola Works. By mid-2009, the new plant was still gathering momentum toward full production capacity, leaving Ndola still a significant player in the region&#x27;s cement industry. Nonetheless, the combination of huge limestone deposits and existing transport infrastructure passing through Ndola has kept the city a very attractive destination for investment into cement production and related activities.

A second cement works is under construction in 2008. In June 2009, countrywide advertisements were published to finalise staffing for this new cement plant.

Another important processing plant that is based on limestone in the area is Ndola Lime. It is Zambia&#x27;s sole producer of Lime. Ndola Lime is located near the two cement manufacturing facilities. It supplies the mining industry as well as farmers who require agricultural lime. Ndola Lime company is wholly owned by ZCCM Investment Holdings, a parastatal holdings company via which Zambia&#x27;s government maintains its active interest in the country&#x27;s mining and closely related heavy industry.

===Cultural interactions===
The four processing plants (the cement plants, the lime plant and Bwana Mkubwa) have mining rights on land located very close to the traditional Chiefdom of Chiwala. Chief Chiwala is therefore a significant interested party to Ndola industry and economics.

===Electrical engineering===
Egyptian company Elsewedy Electric joined a consortium of local companies led by ZESCO Ltd (Zambia&#x27;s electricity supply authority), and established a transformer manufacturing plant and an electrical meter manufacturing plant in Zambia in 2008. Both these facilities are located about 5 km south of Ndola city centre.

==Transport==
The city is served by the operating sections of the Cape to Cairo Railway. The railway operator Zambia Railways maintains a railway station in Ndola, with passenger and freight services to the city of Kitwe to the north-west and the cities of Kabwe, Lusaka and Livingstone to the south. Freight rail lines run to other Copperbelt towns and from Ndola to Lubumbashi in DR Congo via Sakania.

Ndola is on the T3 road, which connects to Kitwe in the north-west (as a dual carriageway) and to Kapiri Mposhi and Lusaka in the south. The M4 road connects Ndola to Mufulira (and the Congo Pedicle) in the north.

Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport, currently located 15 km west of the city centre (adjacent to the Dag Hammarskjöld Crash Site Memorial), has scheduled domestic services to Lusaka and international services to Addis Ababa, Johannesburg and Nairobi. It is one of the country&#x27;s four international airports, others being Livingstone, Lusaka and Mfuwe.

The Tazama Pipeline from Dar es Salaam terminates at the Indeni Petroleum Refinery in the town.

==Sport and recreation==
As with many towns on the Copperbelt, Ndola&#x27;s sports and recreation life was heavily supported by the now disbundled mining conglomerate, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd (ZCCM). With the demise of ZCCM, many facilities deteriorated fast. Nevertheless, significant sports places are Ndola Tennis Club (membership), Ndola Swimming Pool (public), the Kanini area (about 3 km from city centre and home to several sports clubs and playing fields like Ndola Wanderers Football Club, a rugby club, and others). About 10 km north-west of the city centre, there is a motor racing track popular with weekend motorbike enthusiasts. The city has several recreational green parks which enjoy a very basic level of maintenance and are open to the public. Of particular significance is the Dag Hammarskjöld Crash Site Memorial located some 10 km west-north-west of Ndola city centre. Dag Hammarskjöld Stadium, which was located on the banks of the Kafubu River south of the city, was razed in the 1980s. Its replacement, in the north-west of the city, is the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium with a seating capacity of 50,000. Ndola is home to Zesco United, a top-flight team in the Zambia Premier League. Zesco FC is nicknamed &quot;team ya ziko&quot;, or the national team in the Nyanja language.

<text>The Honda S600 is an automobile manufactured by Honda. It was launched in March 1964. Available as a roadster, bearing strong resemblance to the Honda S500, and as a fastback coupé, introduced in March 1965, the S600 was the first Honda available in two trim levels. During its production run up to 1966, the model styling would remain pretty much the same, with the most notable changes coming to the front grille, bumper, and headlights.

== Specifications ==
Powered by a DOHC, water-cooled, four-cylinder inline engine with four Keihin carburetors, the engine capacity was increased to 606 cc from the S500&#x27;s 531 cc. The engine produced at 8,500 rpm and had a top speed of . With the convertible weighing in at mere , the extra sheet metal of the coupe only added to the overall weight. A four speed manual transmission drove the rear wheels via a hypoid differential outputting to chain final drives for each rear wheel. Each wheel was driven by either single or dual chains (depending on production date), contained in a pivoting, sealed case with oil bath lubrication and adjustable tensioners. These pivoting chain cases functioned as trailing arms for the fully independent, coil-sprung rear suspension. The front suspension was also independent, with a-arms, longitudinal torsion bar springs and rack-and-pinion steering. The S600 was equipped with 13&quot; wheels and finned aluminum drum brakes.

== Production history ==
The S600 was the first mass-marketed Honda car. First offered only in right-hand drive, it soon became available in left-hand drive to appeal to export markets. There were a few pre-production S500s manufactured in left-hand drive, two or three even being shown in some early sales brochures. The S600 was the first Honda car sold in Europe. It was never officially sold in the United States, although a small number were imported by individual owners via Canada, Okinawa or Guam.

Both the S600 roadster and coupé were available in standard trim and a special, upgraded package called the SM600 which included, among other items, special paint colors, exclusive badging, a standard radio and speaker, a special antenna in the passenger side sun visor, standard reversing lights, a standard cigarette lighter, a standard heater, better-cushioned seats, and a detachable seat track for quick removal of the passenger seat.

Honda built 3,912 roadsters in 1964, with production climbing to 7,261 convertibles and 1,519 coupes in 1965. Production dropped off in 1966 (as they were shifting to the S800) with only 111 roadsters and 281 coupes, giving tallies of 11,284 convertibles and 1,800 coupes for the 3-year span.

<doc id="1199218" wikidata="Q751636" url="?curid=1199218" title="Yellow baboon">
<text>The yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) is a baboon in the family of Old World monkeys. The species epithet means &quot;dog-head&quot; in Greek, due to the dog-like shape of the muzzle and head. Yellow baboons have slim bodies with long arms and legs along with yellowish-brown hair. They resemble the chacma baboon, but are somewhat smaller and with a less elongated muzzle. Their hairless faces are black, framed with white sideburns. Males can grow to about 84 cm, females to about 60 cm. They have long tails which grow to be nearly as long as their bodies. The average life span of the yellow baboon in the wild is roughly 15–20 years; some may live up to 30 years.

Yellow baboons inhabit savannas and light forests in eastern Africa, from Kenya and Tanzania to Zimbabwe and Botswana. They are diurnal, terrestrial, and live in complex, mixed-gender social groups of 8 to 200 individuals per troop. Like all other baboon species, they are omnivorous, with a preference for fruits; they also eat plants, leaves, seeds, grasses, bulbs, bark, blossoms and fungi, as well as worms, grubs, insects, spiders, scorpions, birds, rodents and small mammals. All species of baboons are highly opportunistic feeders and will eat virtually any food they can find.

Baboons fulfill several functions in their ecosystem, not only serving as food for larger predators, but also dispersing seeds in their waste and through their messy foraging habits. They are also efficient predators of smaller animals and their young.

Baboons have been able to fill a variety of ecological niches, including places inhospitable to other animals, such as regions taken over by human settlement. Thus, they are one of the most successful African primates and are not listed as threatened or endangered. However, the same behavioral adaptations that make them so successful also cause them to be considered pests by humans in many areas. Raids on farmers&#x27; crops and livestock and other such intrusions into human settlements have made most baboons species subject to many organized extermination projects. However, continued habitat loss forces more and more baboons to migrate toward areas of human settlement.

The two subspecies of the yellow baboon are:
* &quot;Papio cynocephalus cynocephalus&quot; (typical yellow baboon)
* &quot;Papio cynocephalus ibeanus&quot; (Ibean baboon)

== Behavior ==
Yellow baboons use at least ten different vocalizations to communicate. When traveling as a group, males will lead, females and young stay safely in the middle, and less-dominant males bring up the rear. A baboon group&#x27;s hierarchy is a serious matter, and some subspecies have developed behaviors intended to avoid confrontation and retaliation. For example, males may use infants as a kind of &quot;passport&quot; or shield for safe approach toward another male. One male will pick up the infant and hold it up as it nears the other male. This action often calms the other male and allows the first male to approach safely.

An area of active research on yellow baboons is the role of their social habits in the composition of their gut microbiome. One group of researchers found that social group membership and interaction rates affected baboon microbiome composition, which they suggested could be due to accidental fecal-oral transmission during grooming periods, even though yellow baboons are not coprophagic. Accidental fecal-oral transmission during close contact may be especially important for the transmission of gut microbes that cannot survive long in the environment, such as those that are non-spore forming. Another group found evidence that male dispersal affected the gut microbiome of the immigrant individual. Immigrant males may acquire a similar gut microbiome to their new groups through dietary changes and being introduced to new microbes through social interactions such as grooming, which lead to more direct transmission of microbes.

<text>The 92nd United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 1971, to January 3, 1973, during the third and fourth years of Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency.

The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the 1960 census. Both chambers maintained a Democratic majority.
==Major events==

Passing legislation on revenue-sharing was a key event of the congress. President Richard Nixon had it listed on his list of top policies to cover for the year. Nixon signed the bill into law at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The law gained support from many state and local officials including: San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto whose city received $27 million in revenue-sharing money in the first year. Alioto said that many projects that would not have been possible could now be done, &quot;That will effectively enable us to meet those programs which up to now because of very tough budgeting we&#x27;ve had to trench.&quot;

<text>The Ford Endura-D engine is a inline-4 Diesel engine used in a variety of vehicles made by the Ford Motor Company, including the Ford Escort (Europe), Ford Focus, Ford Fiesta, Ford Mondeo, Ford Orion, Ford Sierra, Ford Transit Connect and Ford Ikon.
Originally branded Lynx it had 1.8 DIESEL stamped on its rocker cover. It was featured across the Ford range since the late 1980s in models such as the Mk 3 Fiesta, Mk 4 Ford Escort (Europe), Ford Sierra, and Mk 1 Ford Mondeo. The 1.8 itself was a development of the (then all-new) LT 1.6 Diesel unit, originally first featured in the Mk 3 Ford Escort and Mk 2 Fiesta.

Still branded Lynx, later engines had Endura-DE stamped on the rocker cover, and first featured in the Mk 4 Ford Fiesta, Mk 6 Ford Escort (Europe) and Mk 2 Ford Mondeo

The Endura-DE engine features a cast iron block and indirect injection style cylinder head, which means there is a combustion chamber built into the cylinder head. This engine makes use of aluminium for some other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening eight valves via shim-and-bucket followers. The camshaft is rotated by a toothed belt driven by a toothed sprocket on the Crankshaft, likewise the fuel injection pump is rotated by a second toothed belt driven from the crankshaft. The diesel injection pump is a rotary distributor type most typically made by Lucas CAV.

For Ford Fiesta and some Ford Escort (Europe) (typically commercial and base model applications) the Endura-DE engine was a normally aspirated engine producing . The naturally aspirated engine was also offered in the Indian Ford Ikon from 2003 to 2008. However, for other Ford Escort (Europe) the Endura-DE also featured a turbocharger producing and some models and the Ford Mondeo also had an intercooler and these produced .

==Endura-DI==

A redesign of the engine around 1998 saw it become the Endura-DI sometimes referred to as the TDDI Engine (not to be confused with the 2.0 TDDI used in the Mk.3 Ford Mondeo), it always features a turbocharger and produces when found in Mk.4 Ford Fiesta and Ford Transit Connect models. The addition of an intercooler increases power output to for use in the Ford Focus

The Endura-DI engine features a cast iron block and direct injection style cylinder head, which means the combustion chamber is in the top of the piston crown. This engine makes use of aluminium for many other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening 8 valves via shim-and-bucket followers, and the camshaft is driven by a toothed belt which is driven from a sprocket on the diesel injection pump; unusually this pump is driven via gemini (twin) chains from the crankshaft, until a redesign in 2007 saw these chains replaced with a &#x27;wet&#x27; belt system to coincide with the launch of the Mk4 Mondeo. The diesel injection pump is an electronically controlled rotary distributor type most typically made by Bosch.

It has a number of improvements over the previous generation of Ford diesel engines, including the electronically controlled fuel injection pump otherwise known as &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; In addition, the traditional oil sump is replaced with a cast aluminium lower crankcase and a shallow oil pan; there is an oil-to-water cooler, and a great many detail improvements to parts throughout. The engine has been a noted good performer and is a smoother, more powerful unit than the one it replaced.

<text>The Panhard Véhicule Blindé Léger (&quot;Light armoured vehicle&quot;), also known by its acronym Panhard VBL or simply VBL, is a French wheeled 4×4 all-terrain vehicle built by Panhard. The vehicle is offered in various configurations, and was designed to combine the agility of the Peugeot P4 liaison vehicle with adequate protection against small arms fire, artillery fragments, mines and NBC weapons. Produced between 1985 and 2010, the vehicle has been used by the French Army and other European, African and Central American armies in various conflicts since the 1980s.

== Design ==
The French VBL programme started in 1978. The French Army was looking for a light reconnaissance vehicle, intended to work with the AMX-10 RC &quot;wheeled tank&quot;, the Hotchkiss M201 jeep being obsolete when compared with the Soviet BRDM-2 armoured car. The new vehicle needed to be armed with a single machine gun for reconnaissance (recce) or with the MILAN missile for anti-tank combat, while being protected from NBC hazards and small arms fire. Both Renault and Panhard proposed a prototype, the trials beginning in 1982. Before its selection by the French armed forces in 1985, the Panhard model was ordered by the Mexican Army in 1984. In 1985, a preproduction of 15 vehicles for the French Army was launched while the VBL started its active operational service in the French Army in 1990. The French Army ordered 569 VBLs in 1990, 330 between 1994 and 1997, and 700 VB2L (lengthened variant) before 2004. The VBL, sold abroad as the ULTRAV M-11 has been produced at Marolles-en-Hurepoix, south of Paris. Around ten vehicles were produced each month in 2004. The 1,500th VBL was produced in 2001 and the last VBL of the 2,600 VBLs left the plant in 2010.
The VBL has two compartments: a motor bay, placed forward to protect the second compartment, which is for the crew. Its compact internal dimensions led to the design of a lengthened version of the VBL. The crew of the VBL is protected against NBC weapons. The recce versions have two crew members while the anti-tank versions have a crew of three.

The French Army version of the VBL is equipped with a Peugeot XD3T turbo-diesel engine. This engine is used on many civilian cars, such as the Peugeot 505, Peugeot 605 and Talbot Tagora. The VBL used many other standard civilian components, too. Its power and power ratio enable the VBL to drive at . It has a fuel consumption of . Its range of can be extended to by two external fuel tanks. Designed to be lighter than , the mass of the VBL has increased to due to the addition of more weapons, armour and systems.
The VBL is fully amphibious with a speed of in water; it is also air transportable by C-130, C-160, Il-76 and A400M. It can be transported underslung by larger helicopters, such as the AS332 Super Puma, and may also be para-dropped.
==Variants ==

== Service history ==
The VBL has been used in many peacekeeping operations of the French Army, notably in Lebanon, Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo. On 13 March 1985, the French contingent of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in Beirut received three VBLs: one used on a static post, another as a liaison vehicle and the last one kept in reserve. The VBL was also often seen in the Siege of Sarajevo, due to the contribution of the French Army to the Blue Helmets in Yugoslavia. It was used as a means of transport by the main commanders of the UN forces, including General Lewis MacKenzie, earning the nickname &quot;Sarajevo Taxi&quot;. Some were captured by the Army of Republika Srpska after the NATO bombings against Bosnian Serb Force. In other missions, a troop of three VBLs of the régiment d&#x27;infanterie-chars de marine in Rwanda was tasked to make contact with the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the civilian population during the Opération Turquoise, and in Kosovo, the operational requirements of the liaison mission led to the development of the Petit Véhicule Protégé program to supplement the VBL.

In the 2000s and 2010s, the VBL has also been used by French forces in Ivory Coast. Between 2002 and 2003, the VBLs and the ERC-90s armored cars opened fire on MPIGO rebels to block their incursions. They were later used in Abidjan during the operation to oust Laurent Gbagbo from power in April 2011. In Afghanistan, the VBL units protected Kabul Airport and logistics axes. In Mali, the VBLs were deployed in 2013 in the Operation Serval; in the subsequent Operation Barkhane, several soldiers crewing VBLs were killed by improvised explosive devices. The VBL was also used in the Central African Republic in 2013.

The other European VBL users also used their vehicles in peacekeeping missions. Portuguese VBLs have been deployed as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo, working alongside the old Bravia Chaimite for escorts, control missions or mobile checkpoints. In this operation, the Greek military police company, tasked with traffic regulation on the Pristina-Skopje road, was equipped with VBLs. The Greek Battalion of the KFOR fielded six VBLs for reconnaissance missions. The Greek VBLs were also used in North Macedonia in 2001 during Operation Essential Harvest, and in Afghanistan.

Besides the French, other VBLs were also deployed in Africa. In Rwanda, the Forces Armées Rwandaises used their VBLs against the Rwandan Patriotic Front during the Rwandan Civil War, with the country&#x27;s &quot;reconnaissance squadron&quot; (&quot;Escadron de Reconnaissance&quot;) having been trained by French advisors to use MILAN ATGMs as well as VBLs. Vehicles captured by the Rwandan Patriotic Army later saw action in the First and Second Congo Wars. In Nigeria, the Nigerian Army used the Panhard VBL as part of the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group during the Sierra Leone Civil War. They have seen further use during the Boko Haram insurgency, some being lost to Boko Haram. In the Horn of Africa, the Djiboutian VBLs served against the FRUD during the Djiboutian Civil War in the 1990s: in contrast to the better motorised Humvees, the armour of the VBLs enabled them to resist the rebels&#x27; ambushes.

Across the Atlantic, the Mexican VBLs faced the Zapatista Army of National Liberation during the Chiapas conflict.

==Operators ==
=== North America ===
The first user of the VBL was the Mexican Army, which ordered 40 in 1984. They were also the first ones to be delivered, in 1985. Three versions were bought: standard armed with a FN MAG, VBL PC (command post, on short chassis) and VBL MILAN.

=== Europe ===
Portugal ordered its first VBL in December 1987. Locally designated M-11 for the short version and M-11D 4x4 M/89-91 for the long version, they have been serving in the Recce squadrons of the Intervention and of the Rapid Reaction brigades. The M-11s are armed with a Browning M1919 machine gun or with a MILAN missile and the M-11Ds with M2 Browning machine gun or SB-40 grenade-launcher on a PL127 ring-mount or with a radar. Greece ordered six VBLs in 1997 to use them in Albania, where the Hummer was too large and too unstable in frozen roads. The success of the vehicles drove to ten more orders between 1997 and 2004. The Greek VBLs are similar to the ones of the French Army, with short and long chassis, some with PL-127 ring-mount or with MILAN missiles. Having received 1,621 VBLs, the French Army has 1,446 VBLs in service in 2019.

=== Africa ===

Niger ordered one VB2L and six short VBLs with 7.62 machine guns in 1985, all delivered in 1986. Gabon ordered in 1985 twelve VBLs for its presidential guard, one with an Elta radar, the others with a 12.7 machine gun on a CTM-105 mount or with an AA-52. Togo ordered and received in 1986 two standard VBLs. Rwanda ordered sixteen VBLs, including VBL PC, VBL standard and six VBL MILAN in 1986. Cameroon ordered in 1987 one VB2L PC and four short chassis others with a 12.7 machine gun on a CTM 105 ring-mount or with a 7.62 machine gun. The 1st squadron of the &quot;Guluf Battalion&quot; of the Djiboutian Army has been equipped with seven VBLs since 1987. Some of these VBLs are equipped with a NSV machine gun. A first order of 40 VBLs signed in 1985 by Nigeria was canceled but 72 were ordered in 1992 and delivered, including ten with CTM-105 ring-mount, ten VB2L PC and others with FN MAG machine guns. Around 30 were in operational service in 2004.

=== Arabian peninsula ===
The Kuwait National Guard received twelve VBL TOW and eight VBL with PL 127 in 1996. All these vehicles are armed with a secondary FN MAG machine gun. Qatar ordered sixteen VBLs, in three versions (standard with FN MAG, CTM-105 and MILAN) to equip a recce squadron. After intensive tests in 1994, the sultanate of Oman ordered more than 132 VBLs for its anti-tank and recce squadrons. Several versions have been ordered, such as the standard FN MAG version, the VBL TOW, the VBL CTM-105 and a version with Mistral SAMs. The Kuwait Ministry of Interior ordered twenty VBL Mk 2 for its special forces in 2008.

=== Asia ===
Indonesia ordered eighteen VBLs, armed with the FN MAG, in 1996. However, economic difficulties and the Timor Leste crisis prevented them from buying more.

<text>Copperbelt Province is a province in Zambia which covers the mineral-rich Copperbelt, and farming and bush areas to the south. It was the backbone of the Northern Rhodesian economy during British colonial rule and fuelled the hopes of the immediate post-independence period, but its economic importance was severely damaged by a crash in global copper prices in 1973. The province adjoins the Haut-Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is similarly mineral-rich.

The main cities and towns of the Copperbelt are Kitwe, Ndola, Mufulira, Luanshya, Chingola, Kalulushi and Chililabombwe. Roads and rail links extend north into the Congo to Lubumbashi, but the Second Congo War brought economic contact between the two countries to a standstill, now recovering.

It is informally referred to at times as &#x27;Copala&#x27; or &#x27;Kopala&#x27;, invoking the vernacular-like term of the mineral copper that is mined in the province.

==Demographics==

As per the 2010 Zambian census, Copperbelt Province had a population of 1,972,317 accounting to 15.21% of the total Zambian population of 13,092,666. There were 981,887 males and 990,430 females, making the sex ratio to 1,009 for every 1,000 males, compared to the national average of 1,028. The literacy rate stood at 83.10% against a national average of 70.2%. The rural population constituted 19.11%, while the urban population was 80.89%. The total area of the province was 31,328 km2 and the population density was 63.00 per km2. The population density during 2000 Zambian census stood at 63.00. The decadal population growth of the province was 2.20%. The median age in the province at the time of marriage was 21.7. The average household size was 5.3, with the families headed by females being 4.8 and 5.5 for families headed by men. The total eligible voters in the province was 66.10%. The unemployment rate of the province was 22.10%. The total fertility rate was 5.0, complete birth rate was 5.8, crude birth rate was 29.0, child women population at birth was 587, general fertility rate was 112, gross reproduction rate was 1.8 and net reproduction rate was 1.7. The total labour force constituted 50.40% of the total population. Out of the labour force, 63.2% were men and 37.7% women. The annual growth rate of labour force was 2.7%. Bemba was the most spoken language with 83.90% speaking it. The total population in the province with albinism stood at 2,912. The life expectancy at birth stood at 54 compared to the national average of 51.

==Administration==
Provincial administration is set up purely for administrative purposes. The province is headed by a minister appointed by the President and there are ministries of central government for each province. The administrative head of the province is the Permanent Secretary, appointed by the President. There is a Deputy Permanent Secretary, heads of government departments and civil servants at the provincial level. Copperbelt Province is divided into ten districts, namely, Chililabombwe District, Chingola District, Kalulushi District, Kitwe District, Luanshya District, Lufwanyama District, Masaiti District, Mpongwe District, Mufulira District and Ndola District. All the district headquarters are the same as the district names. There are ten councils in the province, each of which is headed by an elected representative, called councilor. Each councilor holds office for three years. The administrative staff of the council is selected based on Local Government Service Commission from within or outside the district. The office of the provincial government is located in each of the district headquarters and has provincial local government officers and auditors. Each council is responsible for raising and collecting local taxes and the budgets of the council are audited and submitted every year after the annual budget. The elected members of the council do not draw salaries, but are paid allowances from the council. The Copperbelt province is a predominantly urban district and has three city councils. The government stipulates 63 different functions for the councils with the majority of them being infrastructure management and local administration. Councils are mandated to maintain each of their community centres, zoos, local parks, drainage system, playgrounds, cemeteries, caravan sites, libraries, museums and art galleries. They also work along with specific government departments for helping in agriculture, conservation of natural resources, postal service, establishing and maintaining hospitals, schools and colleges. The councils prepare schemes that encourage community participation.

==Geography==

The Copperbelt region of Zambia and Congo D.R. is a 500 million year old mountain chain, the Lufilian Arc, which formed when two large pieces of continental crust, the Kalahari craton and the Congo craton, collided. This collision was one of the many that happened between 700 and 500 million years ago to form the Gondwana supercontinent.

This collision is thought to have remobilised base metals, largely already present in the sediments that had accumulated in the basin between the two cratons. These brines then concentrated the base metals either along stratigraphic boundaries, or along fractures, faults or within structurally controlled &#x27;traps&#x27; (such as the nose of a fold). The collision also produced crustal shortening, during which the stratigraphic sequence was tectonically pushed northwards on top of the Congo Craton.

The Lufilian Arc contains two diamictites, megaconglomerates of glacial origin. One of those is correlated with the Sturtian glaciation, while another correlates with the Marinoan Glaciation, both global glaciation events that had profound influence on the history of the planet.

The Lufilian Arc is correlated along trend to the west with the Damara Orogen in Namibia, which also hosts large mineral deposits.

Copperbelt Province is rich with mineral finds and mines. The name of the province is given by the rich finds of copper ore (e.g. Chingola, Konkola, Nchanga Mines), but notable are also emerald mines along Kafubu River, which in the first 6 months of 2011 yielded 3.74 tons of high quality emeralds.
===Wildlife areas===

There are no national parks in this most urban and industrial of Zambia&#x27;s provinces. Other parks with wildlife aspects:
*Chembe Bird Sanctuary west of Kitwe includes crocodiles and Sitatunga as well as plentiful bird life.
*Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage (established mainly to rescue captive non-indigenous chimpanzees).

==Economy and education==
As 2004, the province had 856 basic schools, 71 high schools and the number of school children out of school in ages between 7 and 15 stood at 856. The unemployment rate was 32 per cent and the general unemployment rate for youth stood at 55 per cent as of 2008. The province had 213 doctors as of 2005. There were 377 Malaria incidence for every 1,000 people in the province as of 2005 and there were 26,799 AIDS death as of 2010.

The total area of crops planted during the year 2014 in the province was 122,525.52 hectares which constituted 6.46% of the total area cultivated in Zambia. The net production stood at 315,153 metric tonnes, which formed 7.74% of the total agricultural production in the country. Maize was the major crop in the province with 37,610 metric tonnes, constituting 17.56% of the national output.

<text>Vended is an American nu metal band from Des Moines, Iowa, founded in 2018. The band features two members who are sons of members of Slipknot: singer Griffin Taylor is the son of Corey Taylor, and drummer Simon Crahan is the son of Shawn &quot;Clown&quot; Crahan. They are joined by bassist Jeremiah Pugh, and guitarists Cole Espeland and Connor Grodzicki. Vended released the EP &quot;What Is It//Kill It&quot; in 2021, as well as several stand-alone singles.

== History ==
Vended was formed in 2018 by Griffin Taylor and Simon Crahan when they were teenagers; the duo then recruited Jeremiah Pugh, Cole Espeland, and Connor Grodzicki. Their name is pronounced with emphasis on the second syllable: &quot;ven-DEAD&quot;, and is based on the word &quot;vendetta&quot;. The band avoided touring during their first few years due to their young age. 

The younger Taylor and Crahan resist comparisons of the band to Slipknot, maintaining that they are largely self-taught musicians and did not receive extensive instructions from their fathers. This assertion has been supported by the elder Taylor and Crahan.

Their first live performance was in Des Moines in March 2020, just before being forced to go on hiatus by the COVID-19 pandemic. They released their first recording, the single &quot;Asylum&quot;, on September 21, 2021. Vended released a second single, &quot;Burn My Misery&quot;, on October 19 and announced that they would be releasing the EP &quot;What Is It/Kill It&quot; the following month on November 12. The five-song EP &quot;What Is It//Kill It&quot; was released in November 2021. In late 2022 Vended toured the United States with Jinjer and P.O.D. Vended released several stand-alone singles starting in 2022.

<text>CSX Corporation is an American holding company focused on rail transportation and real estate in North America, among other industries. The company was established in 1980 as part of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries merger. The various railroads of the former Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries that are now owned by CSX Corporation were eventually merged into a single line in 1986 and it became known as CSX Transportation. CSX Corporation currently has a number of subsidiaries beyond CSX Transportation. Previously based in Richmond, Virginia after the merger, the corporation moved its headquarters to Jacksonville, Florida, in 2003. CSX is a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company.

==Subsidiaries and divisions==
===CSX Transportation===
CSX Transportation is a Class I railroad operating in the eastern United States and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The railroad operates approximately 21,000 route miles (34,000 km) of track.

As of December 30, 2016, CSX Transportation served population centers in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Also as of that date, it had access to over 70 ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway.

Following a successful merger application to the Surface Transportation Board, CSX Corporation and CSX Transportation acquired Pan Am Railways in 2022, including a 50 percent stake in Pan Am Southern.

===Conrail===
Conrail was the primary Class I railroad in the Northeastern United States between 1976 and 1999. The trade name Conrail is a portmanteau based on the company&#x27;s legal name (Consolidated Rail Corporation), and while it no longer operates trains it continues to do business as an asset management and network services provider in three Shared Assets Areas that were excluded from the division of its operations during its acquisition by CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Railway.

The federal government created Conrail to take over the lines of multiple bankrupt carriers, including the Penn Central Transportation Company and Erie Lackawanna Railway. After railroad regulations were lifted by the 4R Act and the Staggers Act, Conrail began to turn a profit in the 1980s and was privatized in 1987. The two remaining Class I railroads in the East, CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), agreed in 1997 to acquire the system and split it into two roughly-equal parts (alongside three residual shared-assets areas), returning rail freight competition to the Northeast by essentially undoing the 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad that created Penn Central. Following approval by the Surface Transportation Board, CSX and NS took control in August 1998, and on June 1, 1999, began operating their respective portions of Conrail.

The old company remains a jointly-owned subsidiary, with CSX and NS owning respectively 42 percent and 58 percent of its stock, corresponding to how much of Conrail&#x27;s assets they acquired. Each parent, however, has an equal voting interest. The primary asset retained by Conrail is ownership of the three Shared Assets Areas in New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Detroit. Both CSX and NS have the right to serve all shippers in these areas, paying Conrail for the cost of maintaining and improving trackage. They also make use of Conrail to perform switching and terminal services within the areas, but not as a common carrier, since contracts are signed between shippers and CSX or NS. Conrail also retains various support facilities including maintenance-of-way and training, as well as a 51 percent share in the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad.

===Winston-Salem Southbound Railway===
The Winston-Salem Southbound Railway is a short-line railroad jointly held by CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway, which provides it with equipment. It connects with Norfolk Southern at the north end in Winston-Salem, CSX at the south end in Wadesboro, and in between with NS at Lexington and Whitney, the subsidiary High Point, Thomasville and Denton Railroad at High Rock, and the Aberdeen, Carolina and Western Railway at Norwood. Originally owned jointly by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and Norfolk and Western Railway, predecessors to CSX and NS, it was completed in November 1910.

Commodities commonly carried by the railroad are grain, sand, gravel, stone, forest products, paper products, coal, coke, cement, clay fertilizer, aluminum, chemicals, iron, and steel. Its principal shippers are Corn Products Company of Winston-Salem, a manufacturer of corn syrup and related products, and Owens Brockway Glass Company of Eller, a manufacturer of glass products.

=== P&amp;L Transportation, Inc. ===
Formerly Four Rivers Transportation, Inc., P&amp;L is based in Wilmington, Delaware. It is a railroad holding company in the United States. It is jointly owned by the management of the P&amp;L Railway, as well as CSX Corporation, the latter of which holds a majority.

===Geographic divisions===
CSX is organized into two operating regions: the West Region and the East Region. Each primary region is divided into two sub-regions:

====East====
*Northeast Region, based in Baltimore, Maryland
*South Region, based in Waycross, Georgia

====West====
*Midwest Region, based in Cincinnati, Ohio
*Southwest Region, based in Nashville, Tennessee

===Other subsidiaries===
*Fruit Growers Express
*CSX Intermodal Terminals
*CSX Real Property
*CSX Technology
*Chessie Computer Service
*Cybernetics &amp; Services
*Total Distribution Services
*TRANSFLO Corporation
*CSX de Mexico
*Powerhouse Logistics

==History==

CSX Corporation was formed on November 1, 1980, by combining the railroads of the former Chessie System with Seaboard Coast Line Industries.

The name came about during merger talks between Chessie System and SCL, commonly called &quot;Chessie&quot; and &quot;Seaboard&quot;. The company chairmen said it was important for the new name to include neither of those names because it was a partnership. Employees were asked for suggestions, most of which consisted of combinations of the initials. At the same time, a temporary shorthand name was needed for discussions with the Interstate Commerce Commission. &quot;CSC&quot; was chosen but belonged to a trucking company in Virginia. &quot;CSM&quot; (for &quot;Chessie-Seaboard Merger&quot;) was also taken. The lawyers decided to use &quot;CSX&quot;, and the name stuck. In the public announcement, it was said that &quot;CSX is singularly appropriate. C can stand for Chessie, S for Seaboard, and X, which actually has no meaning.&quot; However, an August 9, 2016, article on the &quot;Railway Age&quot; website stated that &quot; ... the &#x27;X&#x27; was for &#x27;Consolidated&#x27; &quot;. The T had to be added to CSX when used as a reporting mark because reporting marks that end in X means that the car is owned by a leasing company or private car owner. The company introduced its current slogan, &quot;How Tomorrow Moves&quot;, in 2008.

CSX Corporation sold two-thirds of its control of water transport company American Commercial Barge Line in 1998, citing a desire to focus more on rail operations.

The founding chairman of CSX Corporation was Prime F. Osborn III of Seaboard, for whom Jacksonville&#x27;s Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center is named. The first CEO and second chairman was Hays T. Watkins Jr. of Chessie. Watkins was succeeded by John W. Snow as CEO in 1989 and as chairman in 1991. When Snow left the company in 2003 to become United States Secretary of the Treasury, Michael J. Ward, who then headed CSX Transportation, was promoted to succeed him. Overall in 2003, Ward took on the positions of chairman, president, and CEO. When president Oscar Munoz left CSX in September 2015 after obtaining the role earlier that year from Ward, the company underwent several management changes, with Clarence Gooden appointed president.

The company went through major leadership changes in 2017 when activist investor Mantle Ridge, a hedge fund that held 4.9% of CSX&#x27;s stock, demanded a change in the board, that Michael Ward step down as CEO, that the company cut middle management, and that the company hire Hunter Harrison, known for leading the turnaround three other railroads, as CEO. Within months of Harrison&#x27;s hiring in spring 2017, several members of CSX&#x27;s executive management team stepped down. Harrison died on December 16, 2017, and shortly thereafter Chief Operating Officer James M. Foote was named president and chief executive officer.

In March 2018, Foote, said CSX would follow-through on Harrison&#x27;s plans to transform the company and move it from a traditional railroad model to a scheduled railroad model in order to reduce costs and improve the quality of service. Part of this effort includes reducing the number of locomotives in service from 3,000 in late 2017 to between 2,370 and 2,420 in 2020. The company also plans to reduce the number of rail cars it owns from 136,000 in late 2017 to between 104,000 and 109,000 in 2020. In 2017, CSX cut its workforce by 3,300 employees. In 2018, roughly 2,200 jobs were cut. A further reduction of 4,000 positions is planned by 2020. CSX estimates that after these cuts it will have a workforce of about 21,000 people.

CSX is also trying to increase profits by monetizing some of its real estate. As of early 2018, the company planned to generate $800 million by 2020 by selling off some railroad lines and other real estate. As of the same date, CSX held real estate in 23 states, the District of Columbia, and two Canadian provinces.

<text>New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.S. 325 (1985), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which established the standards by which a public school official can search a student in a school environment without a search warrant, and to what extent.

The case centered around a student at Piscataway High School in Middlesex County, New Jersey, known then only by her initials T. L. O., who was searched for contraband after she was caught smoking in a school bathroom. She was sent to the principal&#x27;s office, where the assistant vice principal searched her purse and found marijuana, drug paraphernalia, and documentation of drug sales. She was suspended from the school and charged by police for the paraphernalia found in the search, but fought the charges on the basis that the search of her purse violated the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure.

The New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the constitutionality of the search, but the Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed, holding that the search of her purse was unreasonable. On appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school officials in a school setting. However, school officials do not need to have probable cause nor obtain a warrant before searching a student. Instead, in order for a search to be justified, school officials must have &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that the student has violated either the law or school rules. In a 6–3 decision delivered by Justice Byron White, the Court ruled that the school&#x27;s search of T. L. O.&#x27;s purse was constitutional, setting a new precedent for school searches and student privacy.

==Background==

=== Prior case law ===
The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by the federal government, which is enforceable against state governments and their agents through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

=== Facts of the case ===
On March 7, 1980, a teacher at Piscataway High School in Piscataway, New Jersey discovered two 14-year-old freshmen smoking in the girls&#x27; bathroom in violation of school rules. The teacher brought the two to the principal&#x27;s office, where they were questioned by assistant vice principal Theodore Choplick. One of the students admitted to smoking and was assigned to complete a three-day smoking clinic before being sent back to class, but the other student, whose initials were T. L. O., denied that she was smoking in the bathroom and said that she &quot;did not smoke at all&quot;.

Choplick brought T. L. O. into his private office and demanded to see her purse. Upon opening it, Choplick found a pack of Marlboro cigarettes and rolling paper on top of the purse, which he associated with marijuana use. Believing a more thorough search &quot;might yield further evidence of drug use&quot;, Choplick searched the rest of the purse, revealing a small amount of marijuana, a tobacco pipe, several empty plastic bags, an index card with the names of students who owed her money, and two letters implicating her in dealing marijuana. Choplick called T. L. O.&#x27;s mother and turned over the evidence found in T. L. O.&#x27;s purse to police. At the request of police, T. L. O.&#x27;s mother brought her to the police station for questioning, where T. L. O. admitted to selling marijuana at the school. T. L. O. elaborated that she had sold &quot;approximately 18 to 20 marijuana cigarettes for a price of one dollar each&quot; earlier that day.

T. L. O. received a three-day suspension from the school for smoking in a non-smoking area and an additional seven-day suspension for possessing marijuana on school property. The state brought delinquency charges against T. L. O. for the drugs and paraphernalia found in her purse.

=== Lower court proceedings ===
T. L. O. was tried in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Middlesex County, New Jersey. T. L. O. filed a motion to suppress the evidence found in her purse, arguing that the search of her purse violated the Fourth Amendment and that the evidence found as a result of it should be excluded from trial. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court denied the motion, finding that, while the Fourth Amendment does apply to searches by school officials, a school official is permitted to search a student&#x27;s belongings if there is &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that the student broke the law or school policy. The court found that the search of T. L. O.&#x27;s purse was acceptable because Choplick &quot;had reasonable cause to believe that smoking, a violation of school policy, had occurred&quot;. T. L. O. was found to be delinquent and was sentenced to one year of probation on January 8, 1982.

T. L. O. appealed the Juvenile Court&#x27;s decision to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court, which also found no violation of the Fourth Amendment. T. L. O. then appealed to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, which reversed the Superior Court&#x27;s decision, finding that Choplick did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion to search T. L. O.&#x27;s purse. The Supreme Court of New Jersey remanded the case and ordered the evidence found in T. L. O.&#x27;s purse to be suppressed. The state appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted &quot;certiorari&quot; on November 29, 1983.

==Opinion of the Court==
Oral arguments were initially heard on March 28, 1984. A rehearing was ordered by the Court and the case was reargued on October 2, 1984. The Supreme Court of the United States, in a 6–3 decision issued by Justice Byron White, balancing between the legitimate expectation of privacy of the individual, even a child, and the school&#x27;s interest in maintaining order and discipline, held for the appellant (the state). According to school officials, they do require a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; to perform a search.

Her possession of any cigarettes was relevant to whether or not she was being truthful, and since she had been caught in the bathroom and taken directly to the office, it was reasonable to assume she had the cigarettes in her purse. Thus, the vice-principal had reasonable cause to suspect a school rule had been broken, and more than just a &quot;hunch&quot; to search the purse. When the vice-principal was searching for the cigarettes, the drug-related evidence was in plain view. The plain view doctrine is an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the reasonable search for cigarettes led to some of the drug related material being discovered, which justified a search (including the zippered compartments inside the bag) resulting in the discovery of the cigarettes and other evidence including a small bag of marijuana and cigarette rolling papers.

=== Other opinions ===
In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. (joined by Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor) stated that while he agreed with the Court&#x27;s opinion, he felt that students in primary and secondary educational settings should not be afforded the same level of protection for search and seizures as adults and juveniles in non-school settings.

Justice William J. Brennan, joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall, agreed with the majority&#x27;s conclusions about the applicability of the Fourth Amendment to school teachers but dissented from the new standard set down by the Court, which he felt was a departure from the traditional &quot;probable cause&quot; approach.

Brennan went on to argue that for the government to justify a warrantless search, some &quot;special governmental interest&quot; outside of standard law enforcement interests was required. This idea was later adopted by the Court as the special needs exception.

<text>A legal release is a legal instrument that acts to terminate any legal liability between the releasor and the releasee(s), signed by the releasor. A release may also be made orally in some circumstances. Releases are routinely used by photographers, in film production, by documentary filmmakers, or by radio and music producers when they photograph, film, video or record the voice or performance of individuals to be sure that the person consents or will not later object to the material being used for whatever purpose the release (or anyone they may assign the release rights to) wishes, i.e. that the release wishes to use the images, sounds or any other rendering that is a result of the recording made of the releasor (or property owned by the releasor for which the releasor may claim some other right such as industrial design rights, trademark or trade dress rights). This will help in insuring the copyright owner has a clean chain of title for any work if it is later published, broadcast, shown in a public cinema or otherwise made public.

Releases are very often used to ensure that litigation is terminated when a settlement or compromise between the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) is reached. A general release may release any claims known or unknown that the releasor may have against the releasee. The release may also be very specific, i.e. dealing with specific acts between the parties and not applying to any other acts.

Generally a release is of the form: 

However, most releases are much more detailed in the recitation of what is being released and the extent of the release (where it is valid, when it become valid if there are conditions on its validity, the amount of consideration if it is substantial) and they are either copied and modified as necessary from various form books or drafting manuals used by lawyers or are preprinted forms that are purchased from legal form publishers.

Releases should be drafted by a lawyer, solicitor or civil law notary (not in the United States), except perhaps in the most routine of situations; if the release is not correctly drafted or does not recite any necessary limitations the releasee may find out later that the release did not cover all circumstances, and the releasor may find that the release was too general and released some claim, right or entitlement that the releasor should have retained.

<doc id="1199257" wikidata="Q7216565" url="?curid=1199257" title="Hana-Kimi (TV series)">
<text>, also known by the abbreviation IkePara, is a teen romantic-comedy Japanese television drama planned by Hiroyuki Gotō for Fuji TV and Kyodo TV, based on the &quot;shōjo&quot; manga series of the same title by Hisaya Nakajo. Filming locations include Ryutsu Keizai University. It premiered on Fuji TV on July 3, 2007, and concluded with its twelfth episode on September 18 the same year.

In addition, a television special with the regular cast reprising their roles was subsequently produced, and was broadcast on October 12, 2008.

A remake of this drama with an entirely different cast was broadcast on Fuji TV during the 2011 summer season.

== Cast ==

== Episode list ==

== Special ==

A television special with the regular cast reprising their roles was subsequently produced, and was broadcast on October 12, 2008.

The story starts off half a year after Mizuki&#x27;s secret of being a girl has revealed. It is near Valentine&#x27;s Day, and Sano and Nakatsu are talking about the last week of summer vacation. The story then flashes back to the last week of summer holidays, which is between episodes seven and eight.

The shooting started on March 19, 2008. A conference was held on September 18, 2008, announcing the completion of the special, subtitled .

== Differences ==

There are many differences between the manga and the television drama. Though the concept and characters are the same, the story is described differently. For example, in the comics Sano became injured from saving his friend, while in the drama he became injured from saving Mizuki. Genders are also different in the drama. Akiha is male in the comics, but portrayed as female in the drama. In the comes, Sano found out Mizuki&#x27;s true gender when he accidentally &quot;felt her up&quot;, but in the drama Sano finds out Mizuki is female when he overhears Mizuki talking to her brother. Nakatsu also finds out about Mizuki&#x27;s gender a lot earlier in the drama, while in the comics he finds out Mizuki&#x27;s true gender along with everyone else.

<text>Alí Rodríguez Araque (9 September 1937 – 19 November 2018) was a Venezuelan politician, lawyer, and diplomat. He was the leader of the political party Patria Para Todos (&quot;Fatherland for All&quot;) and occupied various positions in the government of President Hugo Chávez, such as oil advisor, General Secretary of OPEC, President of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Minister of External Relations and Ambassador to Cuba. He was appointed as Minister of Finance in June 2008. His last occupation was Ambassador of Venezuela in Cuba since 2014 until his death in 2018.

== Career ==
Born in Ejido, Mérida, he received his legal certification from Universidad Central de Venezuela in Caracas in 1961. He studied economics, specialising in crude oil; he wrote several works about the energy sector.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, he was active in the Marxist guerrilla movement operating in Venezuela. He was known as &quot;Commander Fausto&quot;, allegedly acting as an explosives expert. He was one of the last guerrilla fighters to put down arms, after the so-called &quot;appeasement&quot; policy (Pacificación) signaled the end of the armed insurgency. He was pardoned and became involved in parliamentary politics, and was elected to the then National Congress. He was minister of energy of Venezuela from 1999, when Chávez took office, until 2000.

In 2000 he was elected secretary-general of OPEC and served from January 2001 to July 2002. He then became president of Venezuela&#x27;s state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), where he masterminded the firing of more than 20,000 workers in response to their part in the company&#x27;s leading role in the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003. He remained in that position until November 2004 when Chávez appointed him foreign minister in a cabinet reshuffle. On 1 September 2006, Rodríguez was appointed as Ambassador of Venezuela to Cuba. Later he served some time as Vice President of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela for the Andean region in Venezuela before being appointed as Minister of Finance by Chávez on 15 June 2008. He died in Havana on 19 November 2018 at the age of 81.

<doc id="1199275" wikidata="Q3544593" url="?curid=1199275" title="USS Menhaden (SS-377)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Menhaden&quot; (SS-377) was United States Navy submarine. Launched in 1944, she operated out of Pearl Harbor until 1946, then continued in use out of various ports in the Pacific until the 1970s. She was then decommissioned and re-fitted as a remotely controlled, unmanned acoustic test vehicle known as the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, until she was scrapped in 1988.

==Name==
&quot;Menhaden&quot; was the first submarine and second vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the menhaden, a marine fish of the herring family which is abundant off the Atlantic coast from New England southward.

==Launch and deployment==

&quot;Menhaden&quot; was laid down by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisconsin, 21 June 1944; launched 20 December 1944; sponsored by Miss Mirium R. Johnson and commissioned at Manitowoc 22 June 1945.

&quot;Menhaden&quot; was skippered by Commander McClintock and manned by sailors from which had been lost by grounding during the Battle of Leyte Gulf the previous October. &quot;Menhaden&quot;, the last of the Manitowoc-built boats to have commissioned service during World War II, trained in Lake Michigan until 15 July. Thence, she was floated down the Mississippi River to New Orleans where she departed for the Canal Zone 27 July. She conducted extensive training out of Balboa during the closing days of the war against Japan, and between 1 September and 16 September cruised to Pearl Harbor for duty with SubRon 19.

==Flagship for Admiral Nimitz==

On 24 November 1945 &quot;Menhaden&quot; broke the flag of Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, CINCPAC and CINCPOA. Fleet Admiral Nimitz had selected &quot;Menhaden&quot; as his flagship during Change of Command ceremonies, for she combined the new with the old. Although untried in combat, she was one of the newest boats in the Submarine Service and incorporated the latest improvements in submarine design and equipment. Moreover her &quot;gallantly battle-tested&quot; crew epitomized the &quot;valor, skill, and dedicated service of submariners&quot; during the long Pacific war. Thus, on her deck that morning Fleet Admiral Nimitz read his orders assigning him to duty as Chief of Naval Operations, and his relief, Adm. Raymond A. Spruance, read orders making him CINCPAC and CINPOA.

&quot;Menhaden&quot; operated out of Pearl Harbor until 2 January 1946 when she sailed for the west coast, arriving San Francisco 8 January. Following inactivation overhaul at Mare Island, she decommissioned 31 May 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She recommissioned at Mare Island 7 August 1951, Lt. Comdr. Ralph G. Johns, Jr., in command. Assigned to SubRon 5, she operated along the west coast out of San Diego during the next year. She again decommissioned at Mare Island 13 August 1952 and began a GUPPY IIA overhaul and conversion to a snorkel submarine.

==Far East deployments==

&quot;Menhaden&quot; recommissioned 6 March 1953, Lt. Comdr. William R. Werner in command. She joined SubRon 3 at San Diego 12 June, and on 21 September she sailed for the Far East. Operating out of Yokosuka, she ranged the East and South China Seas until 11 February 1954; thence, she returned to San Diego 23 March. For the next year and a half she operated in the eastern Pacific where she participated in fleet readiness exercises and type training assignments. On 18 August 1955 she began her second deployment to WesPac where she joined and supported the ever-vigilant Taiwan patrol force. She returned to the west coast 17 February 1956.

&quot;Menhaden&quot; completed six more deployments in the troubled waters of the Far East. As a unit of SubDiv 32, she cruised the western Pacific from Japan and Taiwan to the Philippines and Australia. She carried out surveillance and reconnaissance patrols off past and present areas of Cold War conflict from Korea to Vietnam.

When not deployed in the western Pacific, &quot;Menhaden&quot; maintained a schedule of intensive readiness and alert exercises. Home ported at San Diego, she participated in numerous fleet and intertype exercises. In addition, she supported sonar school operations and provided at-sea training for members of the Navy&#x27;s Submarine Reserve Force.

==Vietnam service and fate==
Early in 1968 &quot;Menhaden&quot; returned to the western Pacific. During a 6-month deployment she concentrated her operations in the waters off Vietnam. Later in the year she returned to the west coast where she continued to prepare for future &quot;keeping-the-peace&quot; missions.

&quot;Menhaden&quot; was decommissioned, 13 August 1971, and struck from the Naval Register, 15 August 1973.

In 1976, ex-&quot;Menhaden&quot; was towed from California to Washington to begin a new career as the &quot;Yellow Submarine.&quot; The boat, stripped of her engines and painted yellow, was operated by the Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station in Keyport, Washington. Affectionately referred to as &quot;The Hulk&quot;, she served as a remotely controlled, unmanned acoustic test vehicle capable of submerging to moderate depths in support of undersea weapons testing, and as a target ship to train Trident missile submarine crews off the coast of Washington.

In 1988 she sank, due to a leaking main-ballast-tank vent-valve when she was being cut up for scrap. As the tide came in, she was not able to float fast enough to avoid being flooded through all of the holes cut through her pressure hull. The city of Everett eventually finished scrapping the abandoned hulk.

<doc id="1199287" wikidata="Q7126168" url="?curid=1199287" title="Palace Green">
<text>Palace Green is an area of grass in the centre of Durham, England, flanked by Durham Cathedral and Durham Castle. The Cathedral and Castle together form a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Although initially not part of the site itself, Palace Green was added to the UNESCO site in 2008.

It is situated on top of the narrow, high peninsula formed by a sharp bend in the River Wear. The Cathedral is on the southern side, facing the Castle across the Green on the north side. To the east are Durham University buildings including the law, theology, classics and history departments, with the music department and the university&#x27;s special collections library to the west.

From the north and east Palace Green is accessed by two cobbled streets called Owengate (formerly Queen&#x27;s Street) and Dun Cow Lane, the latter taking its name from a local legend involving a milkmaid and her cow. From the west a passageway, &#x27;Windy Gap&#x27;, leads down to the banks of the River Wear between two buildings which are now part of the university Music School. Early in the twentieth century one of the buildings had been the home of the novelist J. Meade Falkner, author of &quot;Moonfleet&quot;.

In summer, Palace Green is sometimes used by students of Durham University as a croquet lawn on permission from the groundsman of University College Durham.

&#x27;Palace Green&#x27; is also the name of a hymn tune written by Michael Fleming (1928-2006) while a music student at the university, for the hymn &#x27;Sing Praise to God Who Reigns Above&#x27;.

During the COVID-19 Pandemic, marquees on Palace Green were used as a testing centre run by the University. It was also the site of a student encampment for 43 days in May and June 2024 as part of the global pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses that year.

<doc id="1199289" wikidata="Q1070125" url="?curid=1199289" title="Abies bracteata">
<text>Abies bracteata, the Santa Lucia fir or bristlecone fir, is the rarest fir in North America, and according to some, the world. It is confined to steep-sided slopes and the bottoms of rocky canyons in the Santa Lucia Mountains, in the Big Sur region on the central coast of California, United States.

== Location ==

The species may have had a broader range in the Ice Age era, rendering it a possible paleoendemic, although some scientists say no fossil evidence of the tree has been conclusively identified. The tree is now confined, possibly due to long-term climatic changes, to a few, small locales that mimic those of the distant past.

=== Fire susceptibility ===

The fir tends to be concentrated in steep, rocky, fire-resistant spots at elevations from . Due to the tree&#x27;s thin bark, it is susceptible to fire, and large stands are always located near high cliffs or in steep, rugged canyons that prevent litter accumulation under the tree canopy and limit the strength of fires.

=== Known stands ===

The fir currently grows in a few scattered areas within the Santa Lucia Mountains along the Pacific Slope of California. Four concentrations are found in the vicinity of the Ventana Double Cone and Kandlbinder Peaks, Junipero Serra Peak, Cone Peak, and on the Monterey / San Luis Obispo County line, along San Carpóforo Creek within the Hearst Ranch. The most inland stand, from the Pacific Coast, was found in Anastasia Canyon in the vicinity of the Arroyo Seco River and Tassajara Hot Springs.

Most stands are found on north- and northeast-facing slopes. Trees are rarely found under elevation. When found at lower elevations, they are always located at the bottom of a large canyon, where cold air drainage enables it to thrive. The lowest stand is found at an elevation of near Ventana Camp on the Big Sur River. This camp is at the bottom of a -deep canyon, in the redwood belt, and is frequently foggy.

The northernmost tree was located in 1927 at elevation on Skinners Ridge to the east of the North Fork of the Little Sur River, but it&#x27;s not known if it survived subsequent fires.

=== First identified ===

The first known specimen was collected in 1831 or 1832 by either botanists Thomas Coulter or David Douglas. They likely collected specimens from Cone Peak to the west of Mission San Antonio. Both sent specimens to England, but Coulter&#x27;s specimen was first identified as &quot;bracteata&quot; and the name given his species has become the common use.

=== Cultivation ===

The tree is a popular ornamental and is found in many arboreta. It grows in an equable Mediterranean climate with considerable precipitation during the winter and very dry summers. No one has been able to introduce it successfully in the eastern United States, but numerous groves thrive in Europe.

== Description ==

The tall tree, has a slender, spire-like form. The thin bark is reddish-brown with wrinkles, lines and resin vesicles (&#x27;blisters&#x27;). The branches are downswept. The needle-like leaves are arranged spirally on the shoot, but twisted at the base to spread either side of the shoot in two moderately forward-pointing ranks with a &#x27;v&#x27; gap above the shoot. The leaves are hard and stiff with a sharply pointed tip, 3.5–6 cm long and 2.5–3 mm broad, with two bright white stomatal bands on the underside. The flowers bloom in early May, and the ovoid, 6–9 cm long (to 12 cm including the bracts) cones mature and release winged seeds from late August to October. The cones differ from other firs in that the bracts end in very long, spreading, yellow-brown bristles 3–5 cm long. The male (pollen) cones are 2 cm long, shedding pollen in spring.

==Historical uses==
Resin from the trunk was used as an incense by the early Spanish mission.

<doc id="1199301" wikidata="Q5606668" url="?curid=1199301" title="Gregor McGregor">
<text>Gregor McGregor (18 October 1848 – 13 August 1914) was an Australian politician who served as a Senator for South Australia from 1901 until his death in 1914, representing the Labor Party. He was the party&#x27;s inaugural Senate leader, and served three terms as Leader of the Government in the Senate.

==Early life==
McGregor was born on 18 October 1848 in Kilmun, Argyll, Scotland. He was the son of Jane and Malcolm McGregor. His father was a gardener, and in 1854 the family moved to County Tyrone, Ireland, where he became the chief gardener to Sir Gerald Aylmer (one of the Aylmer baronets). McGregor left school at a young age to join his father. He later spent two years working as an agricultural labourer in England, and then returned to Scotland to work in the Glasgow shipyards.

In 1877, McGregor immigrated to South Australia. He initially worked as an agricultural labourer, and for a period he was employed by Richard Baker, one of his future Senate colleagues. In 1885, McGregor moved to Victoria and found work as a stonemason. He returned to South Australia in 1891 and continued working in the construction industry. He was active in the United Builders&#x27; Labourers Society, and in 1892 was elected to the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia. He also became a justice of the peace.

==Early political involvement==
In 1893, McGregor became president of the United Political Labor League, a forerunner of the modern Labor Party. He was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council the following year, becoming one of the first members of his party in any Australian parliament. In the Legislative Council, McGregor advocated for new workers&#x27; rights, but was also known for his opposition to South Australian involvement in the Boer War and as &quot;a fervent protectionist who espoused the sanctity of White Australia&quot;.

==Senate==

At the inaugural 1901 federal election, McGregor was elected to the Senate as one of six South Australian senators, and the only one from the Labor Party. He was the final senator to be elected, recording only 644 more votes than his nearest opponent, Andrew Kirkpatrick. However, when he was re-elected in 1903 and 1910 he topped the poll, winning more votes than any other South Australian candidate.

When the Labor caucus met for the first time after the 1901 election, McGregor was elected as the party&#x27;s inaugural Senate leader. His party held the balance of power, and he soon told the Senate that &quot;we are for sale&quot;. Chris Watson, Labor&#x27;s first leader, described McGregor as &quot;a powerful force in our party because of his political sagacity and perfect loyalty&quot;. Hugh Mahon said &quot;his memory was phenomenal, his imagination rich and vivid&quot;. McGregor was Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council in each of the first three Labor governments – the short-lived Watson government of 1904 and Andrew Fisher&#x27;s first two governments (1908 to 1909 and 1910 to 1913). As Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1913 to 1914, McGregor had an unusual level of influence due to his party holding a majority in the Senate.

In mid-1914, McGregor took leave from parliament due to ill health. He died from a heart condition on 13 August, at his home in Unley. His death came during the 1914 election campaign, and after he had already nominated himself as a candidate. He was given a state funeral and buried at West Terrace Cemetery.

==Personal life==
McGregor married twice but had no children. His first wife, Julia Anna Steggall, died only a few months after their marriage in 1880. He remarried in 1882 to Sarah Ann Brock (née Ritchie), who was a widow.

McGregor was virtually blind by the time of his death. He experienced a gradual deterioration in his vision, which he attributed to an accident he had shortly after arriving in Australia. By the time he took his seat in the Senate, he could only read in the best lighting conditions, and eventually not at all. He compensated for his blindness with a memory described as &quot;astounding&quot;, able to recite lengthy passages perfectly after hearing them read out loud, usually by his mother-in law.

<text>The lotus tree (, &quot;lōtós&quot;) is a plant that is referred to in stories from Greek and Roman mythology.

The lotus tree is mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; as bearing a fruit that caused a pleasant drowsiness, and which was said to be the only food of an island people called the Lotophagi or lotus-eaters. When they ate of the lotus tree, they would forget their friends and homes and would lose their desire to return to their native land in favor of living in idleness. 

Botanical candidates for the lotus tree include the persimmon (&quot;Diospyros lotus&quot;), which is a sub-evergreen tree native to Southwest Asia and Southeast Europe that grows to about bearing yellowish green flowers, as well as &quot;Ziziphus lotus&quot;, a plant with an edible fruit closely related to the jujube, native to the Mediterranean region of Europe, Asia and North Africa.

In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, the nymph Lotis was the beautiful daughter of Neptune, the god of water and the sea. In order to flee the violent attention of Priapus, she invoked the assistance of the gods, who answered her prayers by turning her into a lotus tree.

The Quran has a legendary plant, the Lote tree, that marks the end of the seventh heaven. In the Bible, the Book of Job also has two lines (), with the Hebrew word צֶאֱלִים (&quot;tse&#x27;elim&quot;), which appears nowhere else in the Bible. A recent translation into English has been &quot;lotus trees&quot; since the publication of the Revised Version of the King James Bible of 1881. However, it is otherwise rendered simply as &quot;shady trees&quot;.

<text>Duncan Gordon Boyes VC (5 November 1846 – 26 January 1869) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The award was bestowed upon him for his actions during the Shimonoseki Expedition, Japan in 1864. He was later discharged from naval service as a result of ill-discipline and moved to New Zealand to work on his family&#x27;s sheep station. Suffering from depression and alcoholism, he committed suicide at the age of 22 in Dunedin.

==Early life==
Duncan Gordon Boyes was born on 5 November 1846 in Cheltenham, to John and Sabina Boyes, who had married in Hobart, Tasmania. His father was a merchant, and Boyes was one of nine children. 

In 1860, Boyes&#x27; sister, Louisa Mary, married Thomas James Young, who received a Victoria Cross for his actions at Lucknow, India, in 1857. At least one of his brothers also served in the Royal Navy. Boyes&#x27; sister Helen was the wife of M. A. Bayfield.

Boyes completed his schooling at Cheltenham College before joining the Royal Navy at the age of 14. He was assigned to HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot;, joining the ship in 1862 when it was serving as part of the East Indies station.
==Victoria Cross==
Boyes received his VC at the age of 17, for his part in action at Shimonoseki, Japan on 6 September 1864. During the fighting, he carried the Queen&#x27;s Colour as part of the company leading the assault on the Japanese stockade. Boyes was credited with keeping the colours flying despite heavy fire that inflicted numerous casualties. Along with Colour Sergeant Thomas Pride who was badly wounded, Boyes continued pressing forward and only stopped his advance when ordered to do so.

The citation was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 21 April 1865 and read:

Sir Ernest Satow mentioned Duncan Boyes in his memoirs entitled &quot;A Diplomat in Japan&quot; (London, 1921) in the following terms: &quot;Lieutenant Edwards and Crowdy of the Engineers were ahead with a middy [midshipman] named D.G. Boyes, who carried the colours most gallantly; he afterwards received the V.C. for conduct very plucky in one so young.&quot;

Boyes, William Seeley, and Thomas Pride were invested with their Victoria Crosses on 22 September 1865 by Admiral Sir Michael Seymour GCB (Commander-in-Chief to Portsmouth) on the Common at Southsea. 

==Later life==
After &quot;Euralyus&quot; was paid off, Boyes was reassigned to HMS &quot;Wolverine&quot;, a corvette serving in North American waters. On 9 February 1867, he and another midshipman, Marcus McCausland, were court-martialled for breaking into the Naval Yard at Bermuda. On the night of the incident, the two men had been ashore drinking and upon their return had been refused entry at the main gate as they did not have the required passes. Both men admitted they were guilty of the offence and were discharged from the Navy as a result of the incident.

Following this, Boyes suffered from depression and alcoholism. He subsequently moved to New Zealand to join two of his brothers on their sheep station at Kawarau Falls near Queenstown, but after his father died, he suffered a nervous breakdown. On 26 January 1869, Boyes committed suicide jumping to his death from the window of a house in Dunedin. He was aged 22 years and 2 months. The official cause of death was listed as delirium tremens.

He was buried locally in the Dunedin Southern Cemetery with a stone at his head and feet, though on 4 May 1954 the Dunedin branch of the Royal New Zealand Returned Services&#x27; Association (RSA), in consequence of his VC, reburied him in the servicemen&#x27;s section of Andersons Bay Cemetery in Anglican Southern Section, Block 6, Plot 24. 

== The medal ==
Between 1978 and 1998, the medal was held by Cheltenham College. The Boyes V.C. sold for 51,700 pounds at auction by Spink, the auctioneers in London, on behalf of Cheltenham College for the purpose of establishing a scholarship in Boyes&#x27; name.

Lord Michael Ashcroft bought the medal at the auction in 1998 for his collection. It is now in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum. 

== Commemoration ==
A series of posters of Duncan Boyes VC and other medal recipients was put on view on the Victoria line in London on 11 November 2004.

<doc id="1199315" wikidata="Q1057739" url="?curid=1199315" title="Mamoru Nagano">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist, animator, and mecha and character designer. Born in Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture, he is noted for his work with anime studio Sunrise. He is married to voice actress Maria Kawamura.

==Career==
Mamoru Nagano made his professional debut in 1984 working with Yoshiyuki Tomino on the TV series &quot;Heavy Metal L-Gaim&quot;. &quot;Fool for the City&quot;, his first manga, came out in 1985 but it was 1986 that brought &quot;The Five Star Stories&quot;, which is still in production today. Nagano founded Toys Press, Inc. to publish much of his work.

His work in &quot;Heavy Metal L-Gaim&quot; introducing mecha with armor plates that appeared to fit loosely over an internal skeleton. These detailed and somewhat plausible designs sparked a fresh wave of designs in mecha anime. From there, Nagano went on to design elegant and graceful mecha for his manga &quot;The Five Star Stories&quot; that displayed elongated lines, delicate curves and a degree of decoration and detail that appealed to the imaginations of a generation of mecha fans. Nagano can be called an innovator in the field of mecha design. He has also contributed to the mecha designs of &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;. Among his contributions were the Rick Dias and Hyaku Shiki.

Nagano is also the co-author (along with Kunihiko Ikuhara) and illustrator of &quot;Schell Bullet&quot;, a novel in two volumes. Later, he has worked on the anime &quot;Gothicmade&quot; with studio Automatic Flowers as the producer, director, chief writer, character and mechanical designer for the series.

Nagano is a very versatile man and has been a professional artist, manga writer, musician and fashion designer. Some of his art books show him dressed up as Minako Aino from &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; for cosplay.

<doc id="1199325" wikidata="Q189484" url="?curid=1199325" title="Hamadryas baboon">
<text>The hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas ; gawina; , Al Robah) is a species of baboon within the Old World monkey family. It is the northernmost of all the baboons, being native to the Horn of Africa and the southwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula. These regions provide habitats with the advantage for this species of fewer natural predators than central or southern Africa where other baboons reside. The hamadryas baboon was a sacred animal to the ancient Egyptians and appears in various roles in ancient Egyptian religion, hence its alternative name of &#x27;sacred baboon&#x27;.

==Description==
The hamadryas baboon shows differences in coloration among adults with males having a pronounced silver-white mane and mantle, which they develop at around the age of ten years, while the females are capeless and brown all over and have reddish to dark brown faces. They are also sexually dimorphic in size, and males are nearly twice as large as females. 
Males may have a body measurement of up to and weigh ; females weigh and have a body length of . The tail adds a further to the length, and ends in a small tuft. Infants are very dark brown or black in coloration and lighten after about one year. Hamadryas baboons reach sexual maturity at about four years for females and between five and seven years for males.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The hamadryas baboon&#x27;s range extends from the Red Sea in Eritrea to Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. It is also native to the Sarawat Mountains of southwestern Arabia, in both Yemen and Saudi Arabia. It is locally extinct in Egypt. The hamadryas baboon lives in arid areas, savannas, and rocky areas, requiring cliffs for sleeping and finding water. Like all baboons, the hamadryas baboon is omnivorous and is adapted to its relatively dry habitat. During the wet seasons, the baboon feeds on a variety of foods, including blossoms, seeds, grasses, wild roots, bark and leaves from acacia trees. During the dry season, the baboons eat leaves of the &quot;Dobera glabra&quot; and sisal leaves. Hamadryas baboons also eat insects, spiders, worms, scorpions, reptiles, birds, and small mammals, including antelope.

The baboon&#x27;s drinking activities also depend on the season. During the wet seasons, the baboon do not have to go far to find pools of water. During the dry seasons, they frequent up to three permanent waterholes. Baboons rest at the waterholes during midafternoon and also dig drinking holes only a short distance from natural waterholes.

===Group organization===

The hamadryas baboon has an unusual four-level social system called a multilevel society. Most social interaction occurs within small groups called one-male units or harems containing one male and up to 10 females, which the males lead and guard. A harem often includes a younger &quot;follower&quot; male that may be related to the leader. Two or more harems unite repeatedly to form clans. Within clans, males are close relatives of one another and have an age-related dominance hierarchy. Bands are the next level. Two to four clans form bands of up to 400 individuals which usually travel and sleep as a group. Males rarely leave their bands, and females are occasionally transferred or traded between bands by males. Bands may fight with one another over food or territory, and the adult male leaders of the units are the usual combatants. Bands also contain solitary males that are not harem leaders or followers and move freely within the band. Several bands may come together to form a troop, usually at sleeping cliffs.

===Group behavior===

The hamadryas baboon is unusual among baboon and macaque species in that its society is strictly patriarchal. The males limit the movements of the females, herding them with visual threats and grabbing or biting any that wander too far away. Males sometimes raid harems for females, resulting in aggressive fights. Many males succeed in taking a female from another&#x27;s harem, called a &quot;takeover&quot;. Visual threats are usually accompanied by these aggressive fights. This would include a quick flashing of the eyelids accompanied by a yawn to show off the teeth. As in many species, infant baboons are taken by the males as hostages during fights. However, males within the same clan tend to be related and respect the social bonds of their kin. In addition, females demonstrate definite preferences for certain males, and rival males heed these preferences. The less a female favors her harem males, the more likely she will be successfully taken by a rival. Young males, often &quot;follower&quot; males, may start their own harems by maneuvering immature females into following them. The male may also abduct a young female by force. Either way, the male will mate with the female when she matures. Aging males often lose their females to followers and soon lose weight and their hair color changes to brown like a female. While males in most other baboon species are transferred away from their male relatives and into different troops, male hamadryas baboons remain in their natal clans or bands and have associations with their male kin.

Hamadryas baboons have traditionally been thought of having a female transfer society with females being moved away from their relatives of the same sex. However, later studies show female baboons retain close associations with at least some female kin. Females can spend about as much time with other females as they do with the harem males, and some females will even interact with each other outside of their harems. In addition, it is not uncommon for females of the same natal group to end up in the same harem. Females can still associate and help their extended families despite their interactions being controlled by the harem males.

Females within a harem do not display any dominance relationships as seen in many other baboon and macaque species. The harem males suppress aggression between the females and prevent any dominance hierarchies from arising. Despite this, some social differences between the females occur. Some females are more socially active and have a stronger social bond with the harem male. These females, known as the &quot;central females&quot;, stay in closer proximity to the harem male than the other females. Females that spend most of their time farther from the harem male are called &quot;peripheral females&quot;.

===Reproduction and parenting===

Like other baboons, the hamadryas baboon breeds aseasonally. The dominant male of a one-male unit does most of the mating, though other males may occasionally sneak in copulations, as well. Females do most of the parenting. They nurse and groom the infant and one female in a unit may groom an infant that is not hers. Like all baboons, hamadryas baboons are intrigued by infants and give much attention to them. Dominant male baboons prevent other males from coming into close contact with their infants. They also protect the young from predators. The dominant male tolerates the young and will carry and play with them. When a new male takes over a female, she develops sexual swellings which may be an adaptation that functions to prevent the new male from killing the offspring of the previous male. When males reach puberty, they show a playful interest in young infants. They will kidnap the infants by luring them away from their harems and inviting them to ride on their backs. This is more often done by &quot;follower&quot; males. This kidnapping can lead to dehydration or starvation for the infant. The harem leader would retrieve the infants from their kidnappers, which is mostly an act to protect their offspring.

=== Thermoregulation ===
Because bipedalism is thought to help reduce thermoregulatory stress, research has investigated how baboons deal with water restriction and thermal loads as quadrupeds. Using implanted data loggers and simulated desert conditions, researchers found baboon internal temperatures increased significantly with water deprivation. When water was given to baboons, their internal temperatures dropped quickly. Therefore, it seems that access to water helps baboons maintain homeothermy and that water restrictions are a major threat to this species. However, baboons can maintain their plasma volume during water deprivation due to an increase in blood colloid osmotic pressure (COP). Hamadryas baboons do this by increasing albumin synthesis. This helps baboons retain fluids when their bodies are experiencing dehydration.

==In culture==

Hamadryas baboons often appear in ancient Egyptian art, as they were considered sacred to Thoth, a major and powerful deity with many roles that included being the scribe of the gods. Astennu, attendant to Thoth, is represented as a hamadryas in his roles as recorder of the result of the Weighing of the Heart and as one of the four hamadryas baboons guarding the lake of fire in Duat, the ancient Egyptian underworld. A predynastic precursor to Astennu was Babi, or &quot;Bull of the Baboons&quot;, a bloodthirsty god said to eat the entrails of the unrighteous dead. Babi was also said to give the righteous dead continued virility, and to use his penis as the mast of a boat to convey them to the Egyptian paradise.

Sometimes, Thoth himself appears in the form of a hamadryas (often shown carrying the moon on his head), as an alternative to his more common representation as an ibis-headed figure. Hapi, one of the Four Sons of Horus that guarded the organs of the deceased in ancient Egyptian religion, is also represented as hamadryas-headed; Hapi protected the lungs, hence the common sculpting of a stone or clay hamadryas head as the lid of the canopic jar that held the lungs and/or represented the protection of the lungs. Hamadryas baboons were revered because certain behaviors that they perform were seen as worshiping the sun.

===Modern art===
The &quot;Grand Babouin sacré &quot;hamadryas&quot;&quot; is among Rembrandt Bugatti&#x27;s most celebrated sculptures.

==Threats and conservation==
Transformation of field and pastureland represents the main threat to the hamadryas baboon; its only natural predators are the striped hyena, spotted hyena, and a diminishing number of African leopards that can still be found in the same area of distribution. The IUCN Red List listed this species as &quot;least concern&quot; in 2008. No major range-wide threats exist at present, although locally it may be at risk through loss of habitat due to major agricultural expansion and irrigation projects. The species occurs in the proposed Yangudi Rassa National Park, the Harar Wildlife Sanctuary, and a number of wildlife reserves in the lower Awash valley and in northern Eritrea.

<text>The English Mastiff, or simply the Mastiff, is a British breed of very large dog of mastiff type. It is likely descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century. Distinguished by its enormous size, massive head, short coat in a limited range of colours, and always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity. Throughout its history the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as mastiff-type dogs or, confusingly, just as &quot;mastiffs&quot;. It is the largest living canine, outweighing the wolf by up to 50 kg (110 lbs) on average.

== History ==


=== Ancient times to the early nineteenth century ===

There is a ceramic and paint sculpture of a mastiff-like dog from Mesopotamia region during the Kassite period (mid-2nd millennium B.C.).

These dogs may be related to the dogs that fought lions, tigers, bears, and gladiators in Roman arenas. Certainly an element in the formation of the English Mastiff was the Pugnaces Britanniae that existed at the time of the Roman conquest of Britain. The ancient Roman poet Grattius (or Grattius Faliscus) wrote of British dogs, describing them as superior to the ancient Greek Molossus, saying:

What if you choose to penetrate even among the Britons? How great your reward, how great your gain beyond any outlays! If you are not bent on looks and deceptive graces (this is the one defect of the British whelps), at any rate when serious work has come, when bravery must be shown, and the impetuous War-god calls in the utmost hazard, then you could not admire the renowned Molossians so much.

The turn-of-the-millennium Greek historian Strabo reported that dogs were exported from Britain for the purpose of game hunting, and that these dogs were also used by the Celts as war dogs. As far as the origin of the Pugnaces Britanniae is concerned, there is unproven speculation that they were descended from dogs brought to Britain by the Phoenicians in the 6th century BC. This breed&#x27;s first written accounts in England date back to 55 BC when Caesar noted them during his invasions. Many were sent to Italy and in the Roman Empire they became fighting dogs.

The Alaunt is likely to have been another genetic predecessor to the English Mastiff. Introduced by the Normans, these dogs were developed by the Alans, who had migrated into France (then known as Gaul) due to pressure by the Huns at the start of the 5th century. Intriguingly they were known from the Romans to live in a region (the Pontic-Caspian Steppe) about 700 km to the north of the region where the Assyrians once lived. Again, any canine connections are speculative.

The linguistic origin of the name &quot;Mastiff&quot; is unclear. Many claim that it evolved from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;masty&quot;, meaning &quot;powerful&quot;. Other sources, such as the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, say the word originated from the Old French word &quot;mastin&quot; (Modern French &quot;mâtin&quot;), the word being itself derived from Vulgar Latin &quot;*ma(n)suetinus&quot; &quot;tame&quot;, see Classical Latin &quot;mansuetus&quot; with same meaning. The first list of dog breed names in the English language, contained within &quot;The Book of Saint Albans&quot;, published in 1465, includes &quot;Mastiff &quot;. This work is attributed to Prioress Juliana Berners, but in part may be translated from the early 14th century Norman-French work &quot;Le Art de Venerie&quot;, by Edward II&#x27;s Huntmaster Guillaume Twici.
In 1570, Conrad Heresbach, in &quot;Rei Rusticae Libri Quatuor&quot;, referred to &quot;the Mastie that keepeth the house&quot;. Heresbach was writing in Latin; his work was translated a few years later into English by Barnabe Googe as &quot;Foure Bookes of Husbandrie&quot;. This work was originally adapted from &quot;De Re Rustica&quot; by 1st century Roman writer Columella, which highlights the Roman connection. Certainly from Roman to medieval times, Mastiff-like dogs were used in the blood sports of bull-baiting, bear-baiting, lion-baiting, and dog fighting, as well as for hunting and guarding. Dogs known as Bandogs, who were tied (bound) close to houses, were of the Mastiff type. They were described by John Caius in 1570 as vast, huge, stubborn, ugly, and eager, of a heavy and burdensome body—noted for their use as guard dogs on remote estates.

The naturalist Christopher Merret in his 1666 work &quot;Pinax Rerum Naturalium Brittanicarum&quot; has a list of British mammals, including 15 kinds of dog, one of which is &quot;Molossus, Canis bellicosus Anglicus, a Mastif&quot;. Literally, &quot;Molossus, warlike English dog, a Mastiff&quot;, and perhaps the first conflation of the breeds Molossus and Mastiff.

When in 1415 Sir Peers Legh was wounded in the Battle of Agincourt, his Mastiff stood over and protected him for many hours through the battle. The Mastiff was later returned to Legh&#x27;s home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall Mastiffs. Five centuries later this pedigree figured prominently in founding the modern breed. Other aristocratic seats where Mastiffs are known to have been kept are Elvaston Castle (Charles Stanhope, 4th Earl of Harrington and his ancestors) and Chatsworth House. The owner of the Chatsworth Mastiffs (which were said to be of Alpine Mastiff stock) was William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, known to his family as &quot;Canis&quot;. Mastiffs were also kept at Hadzor Hall, owned by members of the Galton family, famous for industrialists and scientists, including Charles Darwin. Some evidence exists that the Mastiff first came to America on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, but the breed&#x27;s further documented entry to America did not occur until the late 19th century.

=== Early nineteenth century to the First World War ===

In 1835, the Parliament of the United Kingdom implemented an Act called the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, which prohibited the baiting of animals. This may have led to decline in the aggressive Mastiffs used for this purpose, but Mastiffs continued to be used as guards for country estates and town businesses.

Systematic breeding began in the 19th century, when J.W. (John Wigglesworth) Thompson purchased a bitch, Dorah, from John Crabtree, the head gamekeeper of Kirklees Hall, whose dogs were often held in the name of his employer, Sir George Armitage. Dorah was descended in part from animals owned by Thompson&#x27;s grandfather Commissioner Thompson at the beginning of the century, as well as a Mastiff of the Bold Hall line (recorded from 1705), a bitch purchased from canal boat men, another caught by Crabtree in a fox trap, a dog from Nostal priory and another dog from Walton Hall, owned by the naturalist, Charles Waterton. J. W. Thompson&#x27;s first stud dog, Hector, came from crossing a bitch, Juno, bought from animal dealer Bill George, to a dog, Tiger, owned by a Captain Fenton. Neither of these had any pedigree, as was normal for the period. Between 1830 and 1850 he bred the descendants of these dogs and some others to produce a line with the short, broad head and massive build he favoured. In 1835, T.V.H. Lukey started his operations by breeding an Alpine Mastiff bitch of the Chatsworth line, Old Bob-Tailed Countess (bought from dog dealer Bill White), to Pluto, a large black Mastiff of unknown origin belonging to the Marquis of Hertford. The result was a bitch called Yarrow, who was mated to Couchez, another Alpine Mastiff belonging (at the time) to White and later mated to a brindle dog also in White&#x27;s possession. Lukey produced animals that were taller but less massive than Thompson&#x27;s. After 1850, Thompson and Lukey collaborated, and the modern Mastiff was created, though animals without pedigree or of dubious pedigree continued to be bred from into the 20th century.

Another important contribution to the breed was made by a dog called Lion, owned by Captain (later Colonel) John Garnier of The Royal Engineers. He bought two Mastiffs from the previously mentioned dealer Bill George. The bitch, Eve, bought by George at Leadenhall Market, was old enough to be grey-muzzled, but of good type. The dog, Adam, was of reputed Lyme Hall origin, but bought at Tattersalls and suspected by Garnier of containing a &quot;dash of Boarhound&quot;, an ancestral form of Great Dane. Garnier took them with him when he was posted to Canada and brought back their puppy, Lion. He was bred to Lukey&#x27;s Countess to produce Governor, the source of all existing male Mastiff lines (Lion was also mated to Lufra, a Scottish Deerhound, and their puppy Marquis appears in the pedigrees of both Deerhounds and Irish Wolfhounds). In the 1880s soundness was sacrificed for type, which was widely attributed to the short-headed, massive, but straight-stifled and chocolate-masked Ch. Crown Prince. This dog dominated all of his contemporaries in terms of the number of offspring. Subsequently, the Mastiff lost popularity but gained a consistency of type, with leaner, longer-headed specimens becoming relatively less common. Prominent among the breeders of this era who began to restore soundness were Edgar Hanbury and his relation, the politician and philanthropist Mark Hanbury Beaufoy, later Chairman of The Kennel Club, who reaching his peak as a breeder with the Crown Prince grandson, Ch. Beaufort, eventually exported to America.

AKC recognition occurred in 1885. Despite such imports, Mastiff numbers in the US declined steadily through the 1890s and the early 20th century. From 1906 to 1918, only 24 Mastiffs were registered in the United States. After 1910, none of these were bred in America. By the time World War I ended, other than a few exports to North America, the breed was extinct outside of Great Britain.

=== After the First World War ===

In 1918, a dog called Beowulf, bred in Canada from British imports Priam of Wingfied and Parkgate Duchess, was registered by the American Kennel Club, starting a slow re-establishment of the breed in North America. Priam and Duchess, along with fellow imports Ch Weland, Thor of the Isles, Caractacus of Hellingly and Brutus of Saxondale, ultimately contributed a total of only two descendants who would produce further offspring: Buster of Saxondale and Buddy. There were, however, a number of other imports in the period between the wars and in the early days of the Second World War Those who can still be found in modern pedigrees were 12 in number, meaning the North American contribution to the gene pool after 1945 (including Buster and Buddy) consisted of 14 Mastiffs.

Virtually all Mastiff breeding in the British Isles stopped during the Second World War, largely because of the rationing of meat. After the war, such puppies as were produced mostly succumbed to canine distemper, for which no vaccine was developed until 1950. Only a single bitch puppy produced by the elderly stock that survived the war reached maturity, Nydia of Frithend. Her sire had to be declared a Mastiff by the Kennel Club, as his parentage was unknown, and he was thought by some to be a Bullmastiff.

After the war, animals from North America (predominantly from Canada) were imported into Britain. Therefore, all Mastiffs in the late 1950s were descended from Nydia and the 14 Mastiffs previously mentioned, with each all-male bloodline going back to Ch. Crown Prince. It has been alleged that the Mastiff was bred with other more numerically significant giant breeds, such as Bullmastiffs and St. Bernards, with the justification that these were considered close relatives to the Mastiff. In 1959, a Dogue de Bordeaux, Fidelle de Fenelon, was imported from France to the U.S., registered as a Mastiff, and became the 16th animal in the post-war gene pool. Since that time, the breed has gradually been restored in Great Britain, has reached the 28th most popular breed in the U.S., and is now found worldwide.

== Characteristics ==

With a massive body, broad skull and head of generally square appearance, it is the largest dog breed in terms of mass. It is on average slightly heavier than the Saint Bernard, although there is a considerable mass overlap between these two breeds. Though the Irish Wolfhound and Great Dane can be more than six inches taller, they are not nearly as robust.

The body is large with great depth and breadth, especially between the forelegs, which causes these to be set wide apart. The length of the body taken from the point of the shoulder to the point of the buttock is greater than the height at the withers. Neither height at the withers nor body weight is specified in the breed standards; these are usually in the approximate ranges and respectively.

===Coat colour standards===
The former standard specified the coat should be short and close-lying. Long-haired Mastiffs, known as &quot;Fluffies&quot;, are caused by a recessive gene — they are occasionally seen. The AKC considers a long coat a fault but not cause for disqualification. English Mastiff colours are apricot-fawn, silver-fawn, fawn, or dark fawn-brindle, always with black on the muzzle, ears, and nose and around the eyes. 

The colours of the Mastiff coat are differently described by various kennel clubs, but are essentially fawn or apricot, or those colours as a base for black brindle. A black mask should occur in all cases. The fawn is generally a light &quot;silver&quot; shade, but may range up to a golden yellow. The apricot may be a slightly reddish hue up to a deep, rich red. The brindle markings should ideally be heavy, even and clear stripes, but may actually be light, uneven, patchy, faint or muddled. Piebald Mastiffs occur rarely. Other non-standard colours include black, blue brindle, and chocolate (brown) mask. Some Mastiffs have a heavy shading caused by dark hairs throughout the coat or primarily on the back and shoulders. This is not generally considered a fault. Brindle is dominant over solid colour, other than black, which may no longer exist as a Mastiff colour. Apricot is dominant over fawn, though that dominance may be incomplete. Most of the colour faults are recessive, though black is so rare in the Mastiff that it has never been determined whether the allele is recessive or a mutation that is dominant.
The genetic basis for the variability of coat in dogs has been much studied, but all the issues have not yet been resolved. On the basis of what is known (and remembering that, as dogs are diploid animals, each gene location (locus) appears twice in every animal, so questions of dominance also must be resolved), the gene possibilities allowed by the Mastiff standard are AyBDEmh(kbr_or_ky)mS. This describes a dog which is fawn with a dark nose, non-dilute, black-masked, non-harlequin, brindled or not brindled, non-merle, and non-spotted. To allow for the rare exceptions we must include &quot;b&quot; (brown mask and possible brown brindling), &quot;d&quot; (blue mask and possible blue brindling), &quot;sp&quot; (pied spotting), and perhaps &quot;a&quot; (recessive black). The possible combination of homozygous brown and homozygous blue is a pale brown referred to as Isabella in breeds where it is relatively common. On a Mastiff, this would appear on mask, ears, and any brindling that was present. Speculative gene locations may also exist, so a Mastiff may be &quot;I&quot; (apricot) or &quot;i&quot; (non-apricot) and perhaps &quot;cch&quot; (silver lightening) or &quot;C&quot; (without silver lightening). (Note that this &quot;C locus&quot; may not be the same as the one identified in other animals, SLC45A2.)

===Record size===
The greatest weight ever recorded for a dog, , was that of an English Mastiff
from England named Aicama Zorba of La Susa, although claims of larger dogs, including Saint Bernards, Tibetan Mastiffs, and Caucasian ovcharkas exist. According to the 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of Records, in March 1989, when he was 7 years old, Zorba stood at the shoulder and was 8 ft 3 in (251 cm) from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, about the size of a small donkey. After 2000, the Guinness Book of World Records stopped accepting largest or heaviest pet records.

The Mastiff breed has a desired temperament, which is reflected in all formal standards and historical descriptions. Sydenham Edwards wrote in 1800 in the &quot;Cynographia Britannica&quot;:
What the Lion is to the Cat the Mastiff is to the Dog, the noblest of the family; he stands alone, and all others sink before him. His courage does not exceed his temper and generosity, and in attachment he equals the kindest of his race. His docility is perfect; the teazing of the smaller kinds will hardly provoke him to resent, and I have seen him down with his paw the Terrier or cur that has bit him, without offering further injury. In a family he will permit the children to play with him, and suffer all their little pranks without offence. The blind ferocity of the Bull Dog will often wound the hand of the master who assists him to combat, but the Mastiff distinguishes perfectly, enters the field with temper, and engages in the attack as if confident of success: if he overpowers, or is beaten, his master may take him immediately in his arms and fear nothing. This ancient and faithful domestic, the pride of our island, uniting the useful, the brave and the docile, though sought by foreign nations and perpetuated on the continent, is nearly extinct where he probably was an aborigine, or is bastardized by numberless crosses, everyone of which degenerate from the invaluable character of the parent, who was deemed worthy to enter the Roman amphitheatre, and, in the presence of the masters of the worlds, encounter the pard, and assail even the lord of the savage tribes, whose courage was sublimed by torrid suns, and found none gallant enough to oppose him on the deserts of Zaara or the plains of Numidia.

The American Kennel Club sums up the Mastiff breed as:
:a combination of grandeur and good nature as well as courage and docility. Domesticated Mastiffs are powerful yet gentle and loyal dogs, but due to their physical size and need for space, are best suited for country or suburban life.

==Health==
At all stages of development, the Mastiff should show the breed characteristics of massiveness and sound, if cumbersome, movement.
The Mastiff is a particularly large dog demanding correct diet and exercise. Excessive running is not recommended for the first 2 years of the dog&#x27;s life, in order not to damage the growth plates in the joints of this heavy and fast-growing dog, which in some weeks may gain over 5 lb. However, regular exercise must be maintained throughout the dog&#x27;s life to discourage slothful behaviour and to prevent a number of health problems. A soft surface is recommended for the dog to sleep on to prevent the development of calluses, arthritis, and hygroma (an acute inflammatory swelling). Due to the breed&#x27;s large size, puppies may potentially be smothered or crushed by the mother during nursing. A whelping box, along with careful monitoring, can prevent such accidents.

A UK study found a life expectancy of 9 years for the breed.

Major problems can include hip dysplasia and gastric torsion. Other problems include obesity, osteosarcoma, and cystinuria. Problems only occasionally found include cardiomyopathy, allergies, vaginal hyperplasia, cruciate ligament rupture, hypothyroidism, OCD, entropion, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and persistent pupillary membranes (PPM).

When purchasing a purebred Mastiff, experts often suggest that the dog undergo tests for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, thyroid, and DNA for PRA.

A Mastiff may be kept in an apartment, but care must be taken to give it enough exercise. Mastiffs should be fed two or three times a day; it is believed that one large meal per day can increase the chance of gastric torsion.

<doc id="1199344" wikidata="Q16947432" url="?curid=1199344" title="Contour canal">
<text>A contour canal is an artificially-dug navigable canal which closely follows the contour line of the land it traverses, in order to avoid costly engineering works such as:

* Digging a cutting or tunnel through higher ground;
* Building an embankment or aqueduct over lower ground, or;
* Constructing a canal lock (or series of locks) to change the level of the canal.

Because of this, these canals are characterised by their meandering course.

In the United Kingdom, many of the canals built in the period from 1770 to 1800 were contour canals - for example, the Thames &amp; Severn Canal completed in 1789, and the Oxford Canal completed in 1790. Later canals tended to be much straighter and more direct - a good example is the Shropshire Union Canal engineered by Thomas Telford.

<doc id="1199348" wikidata="Q883789" url="?curid=1199348" title="Robert Y. Hayne">
<text>Robert Young Hayne (November 10, 1791 – September 24, 1839) was an American politician. He served in the United States Senate from 1823 to 1832, as Governor of South Carolina 1832–1834, and as Mayor of Charleston 1836–1837. As Senator and Governor, he was a leading figure in the Nullification Crisis and, along with John C. Calhoun and James Hamilton Jr., a vocal proponent of the doctrines of states&#x27; rights, compact theory, and nullification; his 1830 debate in the Senate with Daniel Webster is considered a defining episode in the constitutional crisis which precipitated the American Civil War.

==Early and family life==
Robert Y. Hayne was born on November 10, 1791, to Elizabeth Peronneau and her husband William Hayne, who owned plantations farmed by enslaved labor in St. Paul Parish, Hollywood, Colleton District, South Carolina. Robert Hayne had a younger brother, Paul Hamilton Hayne (1803-1830). Hayne received a private education suitable for his class, then studied law in the office of Langdon Cheves in Charleston.

On November 3, 1813, he married Frances Henrietta Pinckney (1790–1818), daughter of prominent lawyer and former governor Charles Pinckney. They had a daughter, Frances Henrietta Pinckney Sharpe (1818–1875). In 1820, after his first wife&#x27;s death from childbirth complications, Hayne married Rebecca Brewton Allston. Her father, William Alston, gave her a lot on lower King Street, where Hayne built a house (today&#x27;s 4 Ladson Street). Hayne would later give his daughter Frances a plantation in Tamassee, South Carolina, when she married the local Pendleton, South Carolina, court clerk, Elam Sharpe, shortly before Hayne&#x27;s unexpected death in 1839.

==Lawyer, officer, planter, railroad president==
Hayne was admitted to the bar in 1812 and practiced law in Charleston. During the War of 1812 against Great Britain, he was a Lieutenant in the Charleston Cadet Infantry. He rose to Captain in the Third South Carolina Regiment. Hayne later served as the Quartermaster General of the state militia. By 1836, he had risen in the state militia ranks to major general.

In the 1820 census, Hayne enslaved 118 people in Georgetown, South Carolina (half of them engaged in agriculture), another 50 enslaved people in Colleton County, South Carolina, and 19 more in Charleston, South Carolina. In the 1830 census, he enslaved 17 people in Charleston. Hayne was mentioned in &quot;American Slavery As It Is&quot;, an abolitionist book published in 1839. He is given as an example of slavers who disregard marriages of enslaved African Americans. The book reprinted a signed advertisement Hayne placed in a newspaper that sought help capturing an escaped man. Hayne&#x27;s advertisement suggested that the fugitive may be heading to a neighboring county where the enslaved man&#x27;s wife and children live.

Hayne actively promoted South Carolina&#x27;s industrial development, including the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company, which in 1835 expanded westward toward the Appalachian Mountains under Hayne&#x27;s plan to link Charleston&#x27;s port to Memphis, Tennessee, and the Mississippi River. Hayne was president of the Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad until his death and was succeeded as its president by James Gadsden. The LCCR bought the SCCRC&#x27;s stock in 1839. The two railroads merged in 1844 but never completed the track as expected, only finishing about 60 miles to Columbia, South Carolina, in addition to connections to Camden, South Carolina, in 1848 and Atlanta, Georgia, in 1853.

==Political career==
A Democrat, Hayne was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives and served from 1814 to 1818, including as Speaker of the House in 1818. Hayne was Attorney General of South Carolina from 1818 to 1822. During his tenure, the trial of Denmark Vesey occurred in Charleston after a purported slave rebellion was thwarted. Governor Thomas Bennett, unsupportive of the city-appointed court handling the trial, asked Hayne for his legal opinion. Hayne advised Bennett that the &quot;Magna Charta and Habeas Corpus and indeed all the provisions of our Constitution in favour of Liberty, are intended for freemen only&quot; and that the Governor of South Carolina could not examine &quot;judicial errors.&quot;

In 1822, South Carolina&#x27;s legislature elected Hayne to the United States Senate. He was reelected in 1828 and served from March 4, 1823, to December 13, 1832. From 1825 to 1832, he chaired the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. Martin Van Buren, a contemporary of Hayne&#x27;s in the Senate, commented on how Hayne&#x27;s demeanor there evolved from one of self-confident outspokenness at first to one of outward modesty more in line with the senatorial culture of respect for seniority:

In 1832, under James Hamilton Jr. as governor, Hayne served as Chairman of South Carolina&#x27;s nullification convention. Hamilton and Hayne argued that states could &quot;nullify&quot; federal laws with which they disagreed. Eighty percent of its 162 delegates voted to nullify federal tariffs of 1828 and 1832 and for the Ordinance of Nullification. A temporary compromise was reached between the federal government and South Carolina in 1833.

Hayne resigned from the Senate to accept election by the legislature as Governor of South Carolina in 1832, serving one term into 1834. He was succeeded in the senate by John C. Calhoun, who resigned his post as Vice President of the United States to take the seat.
From 1836 to 1837, he served as Mayor of Charleston, South Carolina.

==Death and legacy==

Hayne died in Asheville, North Carolina, on September 24, 1839. He is buried at St. Michael&#x27;s Church cemetery in Charleston.

His transcontinental railroad dreams never materialized. His son-in-law, Capt. Elam Sharpe Jr. fought for the Confederacy against the United States in the American Civil War as a member of the First South Carolina Cavalry, Hampton&#x27;s Legion, surviving the war. However, he and his family sold their plantations and invested the proceeds in Confederate bonds. After the war, the family&#x27;s finances were dire, and Sharpe moved to Tennessee, then Dallas, Texas, where he became a Presbyterian minister.

Hayne&#x27;s descendants sold the Ladson Street house in 1863, but it still exists today, albeit moved and renovated in 1890.

Hayne&#x27;s nephew, Paul Hamilton Hayne, was a poet and South Carolina&#x27;s poet laureate who moved to Georgia after the Civil War. In 1878, he published a biography of Hayne.

The World War II Liberty ship was named in his honor.

==Political views==
Hayne was an ardent free-trader and an uncompromising advocate of states&#x27; rights. He consistently argued that slavery was a domestic institution and should be dealt with only by the individual states. He opposed the federal government&#x27;s plan to send delegates to the Panama Congress, which was organized by Simón Bolívar to develop a united North and South American policy towards Spain, including the end of slavery in Spain&#x27;s former colonies. (After achieving independence, Mexico abolished slavery in 1824.) Objecting to any federal effort to curtail slavery, Hayne said, &quot;The moment the federal government shall make the unhallowed attempt to interfere with the domestic concerns of the states; those states will consider themselves driven from the Union.&quot;

He opposed 1824, 1828, and 1832 protectionist federal tariff bills. In 1828, in response to the changing economic landscape in Massachusetts (there was a shift from farming towards mass production in factories), Daniel Webster backed a bill to increase tariffs on imported goods, a measure that southern politicians opposed. Hayne spoke in opposition to the bill, Webster responded, and the ensuing series of back-and-forth Senate speeches became known as the Webster-Hayne debate.

The debate arose over the &quot;Foot resolution,&quot; introduced on December 29, 1829 by Senator Samuel A. Foot of Connecticut. Foot&#x27;s proposal called for a federal government study into restricting the sale of public lands to those lands already surveyed and available for sale, preventing states from conducting further land sales. Whether the federal government had the authority to take this action called into question the relationship between the powers of the federal government and the governments of the individual states.

Hayne contended that the United States Constitution was only a compact among the states and that any state could nullify any federal law which it considered to be in contradiction.

Webster argued for the supremacy of the federal government and the Constitution and against nullification and secession. He concluded his Second Reply to Hayne with the memorable phrases, &quot;Liberty &quot;and&quot; union, now &quot;and&quot; forever, one &quot;and&quot; inseparable.&quot;

<text>The BMW M1 (model code E26) is a mid-engined sports car produced by German automotive manufacturer BMW from 1978 until 1981.

In the late 1970s, Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini entered into an agreement with BMW to build a production racing car in sufficient quantity for homologation, but conflicts arose that prompted BMW to produce the car themselves. The resulting car was sold to the public, from 1978 until 1981, as the BMW M1.

It was the first mid-engine BMW automobile to be mass-produced; the second was the i8 plug-in hybrid sports car.

== Overview ==
=== Development history ===

The motorsport division of BMW, headed by Jochen Neerpasch, had been wanting to compete in motorsports using a car developed for competition racing, in order to compete with arch rival Porsche in Group-5 racing. Thus, the development of the M1 was initiated. Neerpasch, who was head of the development program, stressed that the car was to be strictly mid-engine in order to outclass its competitors. As BMW wasn&#x27;t able to build 400 road-going examples of the car in the required time period as stipulated by the rules, the company partnered with Lamborghini to work out the details of the car&#x27;s chassis, assemble prototypes and manufacture the vehicles. The tubular steel space frame chassis was the work of Gianpaolo Dallara, but soon Lamborghini&#x27;s financial position deteriorated and the possibility of the car&#x27;s production by the Italian manufacturer faded, so BMW reassumed control over the project in April 1978, after seven prototypes were built. The delay in production and the changes in Group 5 rules forced the company to compete in Group 4 racing with the car.

The M1 coupé was hand-built between 1978 and 1981 under the motorsport division of BMW, as a homologation special for sports car racing. The fibreglass body was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, taking inspiration from the 1972 BMW Turbo concept car. Since the engineering of the car was still incomplete, a group of former Lamborghini engineers had founded a company named Italengineering, which offered to complete the car&#x27;s design. Less than 10 miles away from the Lamborghini shop, the engineering for the M1 was finished.

=== Engine and transmission ===

The BMW M1 is the first car to be solely developed by BMW M and employs a M88/1 petrol straight-six engine with Kugelfischer-Bosch mechanical fuel injection and Magneti-Marelli ignition system. The engine was developed by Paul Rosche, who was also responsible for the S14 inline-four engine and the S70/2 V12 engine. A version of this engine was later used in the South African version of the 745i, of which 209 examples were built between 1984 and 1986, as well as the E24 M6/M635CSi and E28 M5. The engine has six separate throttle bodies, twin-cams, 4 valves per cylinder, and generates a power output of at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm in the road version, giving the car a top speed of . The engine was mated to a 5-speed manual transmission made by ZF Friedrichshafen equipped with a 40% locking limited slip differential.

=== Steering, suspension and brakes ===
The M1 has unassisted rack-and-pinion steering, and a double-wishbone suspension system with adjustable coil springs and Bilstein gas filled dampers. The road car had softer suspension bushings for better ride quality and tractability.

The ventilated steel brakes of the car measured at the front and at the rear. The M1 used special Campagnolo alloy wheels measuring 7×16 inches at the front and 8×6 inches at the rear, fitted with Pirelli P7 tyres (205/55 VR15 at the front and 225/50 VR15 at the rear).

=== Interior ===

Reflecting its motorsport roots, the M1 had a fairly basic leather and cloth interior, and used many parts sourced from other BMW models. It offered amenities such as air conditioning, power windows, and a stereo, but provided no seat adjustment, and only left-hand drive was available.

=== Production ===
The fibreglass body of the M1 was manufactured by Italian firm TIR (Trattamento Italiano Resina) which was located in Reggio Emilia, Italy. The chassis was manufactured by a Modenese firm, Marchesi. The body of the car was completed by Italdesign at their manufacturing facility located in Turin along with the interior.

The partly finished cars were then delivered to 
German specialist manufacturer Baur where final assembly took place by hand. The hand-built M88/1 engines were supplied by BMW from Munich to be installed in the cars. The completed cars were shipped to BMW Motorsport in Munich for final inspection and delivery. Only 453 production cars were built, making it one of BMW&#x27;s rarest models. Out of the 453, 399 were road going units while 53 were made for motorsport.

=== Accolades ===

The M1 had various successes in motorsports. In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; placed the car at number ten on their list of top sports cars of the 1970s.

== Motorsport ==
In 1979, the head of BMW Motorsport, Jochen Neerpasch, devised a one-make championship using racing modified M1s. The series was created to aid BMW in building enough cars to enter the group 4 classification in the World Championship for Makes. The new series, known as the &quot;Procar BMW M1 Championship&quot;, served as a support series for Formula One, and included many Formula One drivers in identical cars.

The series ran for two years, with Niki Lauda winning the 1979 season, and Nelson Piquet the 1980 season. After BMW met the standards for group 4, the Procars were used by various teams in the world championship as well as other national series.

The M1 was also campaigned at the 24 Hours of Le Mans from 1981 to 1986 where it proved competitive. The car was classified as a Group B car for Le Mans purposes, as Group B was also planned for GT class for road races, but were instead eclipsed by Group C prototypes.

A M1 Pro Car was also converted to Group B rally spec by BMW France for the 1982 season. The car was campaigned for the 1983 season as well before the car was entered solely by the Motul privateer racing team for the 1984 season. The 1984 season proved to be the most successful for the M1 as former ERC champion Bernard Béguin won back-to-back at Rallye de La Baule and Rallye de Lorraine that season, and even claimed an outright ERC podium at Rally d&#x27;Antibes four months later. The car was not campaigned further after 1984.

== Commemorative cars and spiritual successor ==
=== M1 Homage concept ===

In April 2008, BMW unveiled the M1 Homage concept, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the M1. The concept vehicle uses a mid-engine layout that borrows styling cues from both the original M1 and the BMW Turbo show car.

The M1 Homage concept was first shown to the public at the of 2008. The design was penned by BMW&#x27;s in-house design team, inspired by both the original M1 and the BMW Turbo concept designed by Paul Bracq. The BMW Turbo had many technical and advanced innovations from BMW that were part of the inspiration of the M1 Homage concept. The front of the car differs the most from the other parts of the car. The front sports double head lights which are not the same as pop-up type that are on the original M1, but the usual trademark of the kidney grilles is present. The M1 Homage also incorporates the double badge on the back of the car like the original M1. There are no photos of the interior of the car or of the car in action, nor have the specifications of the car been released as the car was meant only to be a design exercise.

=== Vision EfficientDynamics concept and the BMW i8 ===

After the M1, BMW designed some mid engined concept cars but none of them inspired a production car until 2013, when the Vision EfficientDynamics concept led to the production of the i8. The BMW i8 is based on the Vision EfficientDynamics concept, which is a range-extender electric car with a three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine. The production car was designed by Benoit Jacob. Series production of customer vehicles began in April 2014. It is also the first mass-produced mid-engine BMW automobile since the M1.

=== Vision M Next concept ===
The Vision M Next is a plug-in hybrid concept sports car that was showcased in June 2019. The design is partially inspired from the M1, such as louvered rear windows and BMW roundels positioned inside the taillamps. It is powered by the &quot;Power PHEV&quot; drivetrain system that offers the choice between all-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive, with either all-electric propulsion or the power of a turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine. The total system output is claimed at . It also has a claimed 0 to acceleration time of 3 seconds and top speed of . The maximum range when driving in all-electric mode is claimed to be .

==March-BMW M1/C prototype==
A highly modified version of the BMW M1, the March-BMW M1/C, also known as the BMW-March M1/C, or simply the March 81P, was an IMSA GTX/GTP sports prototype race car, designed, developed, and built by British constructor March Engineering, in collaboration with German manufacturer BMW, for sports car racing, in 1981.

<text>Tsarevna (, ) was a title given to the daughters of tsars in Russia before the 18th century. The male equivalent was &quot;tsarevich&quot;.

All of them died unmarried with the exception of the daughters of Ivan V. Notably, his daughter Catherine married Karl Leopold of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

Both &quot;tsarevna&quot; and &quot;tsarevich&quot; were replaced with &quot;grand duchess&quot; and &quot;grand duke&quot; (with &quot;tsesarevich&quot; given to the heir apparent).

<text>William Kitchiner (1778–1827) was an English optician, amateur musician and cook. A celebrity chef, he was a household name during the 19th century, and his 1817 cookbook, &quot;The Cook&#x27;s Oracle&quot;, was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and the United States. The origin of the crisp (also known as potato chip) is attributed to Kitchiner, with &quot;The Cook&#x27;s Oracle&quot; including the earliest known recipe.

Unlike most food writers of the time he cooked the food himself, washed up afterwards, and performed all the household tasks he wrote about. He travelled around with his &quot;portable cabinet of taste&quot;, a folding cabinet containing his mustards and sauces. He was also the creator of Wow-Wow sauce.

== The Cook&#x27;s Oracle ==
Kitchiner&#x27;s most well-known book &quot;The Cook&#x27;s Oracle&quot;, full title &quot;Apicius Redivivus, or the Cook&#x27;s Oracle&quot;, was first published in 1817. It is also known as &quot;The Cook&#x27;s Oracle: Containing receipts for plain cookery on the most economical plan for private families, etc.&quot; 

&quot;The Cook&#x27;s Oracle&quot; includes eleven ketchup recipes, including two each for mushroom, walnut and tomato ketchups, one each for cucumber, oyster, cockle and mussel ketchups, and also a recipe for Wow-Wow sauce.

The book contains what may be one of the earliest references to crisps, in a recipe for &quot;Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings&quot;, which instructs the reader to &quot;peel large potatoes, slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, or cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping&quot;.

== Life ==
Kitchiner was born in 1778, the son of a prosperous merchant. His father&#x27;s legacy meant he did not have to work, but instead was able to live on his own means. Although claiming to have been educated at Eton and Glasgow, he attended neither institution, but the link to Glasgow enabled him to claim to be a medical doctor (M.D.), a claim no-one checked.

His love life was chequered: he married, separated, and had an illegitimate son, whom he acknowledged and funded. He surrounded himself with like-minded individuals, setting up a &quot;committee of taste&quot; which revolved around dinners, hosted by himself or held elsewhere.

His dinners were renowned and made him something of a celebrity within a certain circle. He was very important for that reason. Unlike most food writers of the time he cooked the food himself (though not alone), washed up afterward, and performed all the household tasks he wrote about. In his writings he extolled the virtues of a &quot;magazine of taste&quot;, a &quot;pyramidical epergne&quot; which could also be made into a portable traveling case, and which contained 28 different ingredients including liqueurs, spice blends, and proprietary sauces.

He died in 1827 of an apparent heart attack, the day before he was due to change his will to remove his son, whom he had decided no longer merited the legacy.

<text>Colombes () is a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, France, from the centre of Paris. In 2019, Colombes was the 53rd largest city in France.

==Name==
The name Colombes comes from Latin &quot;columna&quot; (Old French &quot;colombe&quot;), meaning &quot;column&quot;. This is interpreted as referring either to a megalithic column used in ancient times by a druidic cult which stood in Colombes until its destruction during the French Revolution, or to the columns of an atrium in a ruined Gallo-Roman villa that also stood in Colombes.

==History==
On 13 March 1896, 17% of the territory of Colombes was detached and became the commune of Bois-Colombes (). On 2 May 1910, 19% of the (reduced) territory of Colombes was detached and became the commune of La Garenne-Colombes. Thus, the commune of Colombes is now only two-thirds the size of its territory before 1896. The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Colombes proper, in its geography at the given years. The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1923.

===Population===

==Geography==

The highest temperature ever recorded in Colombes was on 6 August 2003; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 17 January 1985.

==Administration==

The city is divided into two cantons: 
* Colombes-1 (north)
* Colombes-2 (south)

==Transport==
Colombes is served by four stations on the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare suburban rail line at Colombes, Le Stade, La Garenne-Colombes and Les Vallées.

==Education==
The commune has 21 preschools and 19 elementary schools.

==Sport==
The stadium was built in 1907. Officially named the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, the Olympic Stadium of Colombes was the site of the opening ceremony and several events of the 1924 Summer Olympics. The arena&#x27;s capacity was increased to 60,000 for the 1938 World Cup. The stadium lost its importance after the restoration in 1972 of Paris&#x27; 49,000-seat Parc des Princes. In the 1990s, three of the four grandstands were torn down due to decay and the stadium&#x27;s capacity was down to 7,000; later renovations have brought the current capacity to 14,000.

Through November 2017, it had been home to the Racing 92 rugby club, currently playing in France&#x27;s Top 14, but Racing has since moved to the new U Arena in Nanterre. The RCF Paris football club, which plays in the fourth division, remains at Yves-du-Manoir. The stadium will be the field hockey venue at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Kaye was born on 7 April 1941 in Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, the only child of Harold and Gracie Kaye; Gracie was 42 when she gave birth. Harold Kaye was a lorry driver in the ARP during the Second World War, and at other times worked as an engineering operative in a tractor factory.

When young, Kaye played rugby league for Moldgreen ARLFC before studying at King James&#x27;s Grammar School, Almondbury, Huddersfield. He worked in hospital radio in Huddersfield (interviewing Ken Dodd and then the Beatles in 1963 when they played the Ritz in the town), and worked in textile mills, a wine factory, and a tractor factory.

==Career==

Kaye had appeared in a radio play directed by Alan Ayckbourn and also in a television play from Manchester. Ayckbourn suggested that he audition for the Bolton Octagon Theatre; he was offered a contract and his roles there included Pishchik in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; followed by roles in &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot;, &quot;Luther,&quot; and a double-bill of &quot;Oedipus&quot; and &quot;Cyclops&quot;.

His first TV role was in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Champion House&quot; (1968). Having been seen by Pat Phoenix in &quot;Little Malcolm&quot; by David Halliwell at Bolton, he was cast as Bernard Butler, the nephew of Elsie Tanner (Phoenix), in the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1969. He later made an impression on producer/writer David Croft following guest roles in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; and &quot;Come Back Mrs. Noah&quot;, and also the comedy series &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; by John Sullivan.

He appeared in the 1978 comedy short &quot;The Waterloo Bridge Handicap&quot;, starring Leonard Rossiter, and featured as Dines in the feature film version of &quot;Porridge&quot; (1979) alongside Ronnie Barker. He also appeared in the TV show about a Yorkshire vet, &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; and in the private detective series &quot;Shoestring&quot;. In 1981, Kaye appeared as Frank Broadhurst in the children&#x27;s drama serial &quot;Codename Icarus&quot;.

Kaye appeared in three episodes of Croft&#x27;s British department store sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; and was later offered the lead role in a series he had written called &quot;Oh Happy Band!&quot;, but Kaye was unavailable and the part went to Harry Worth. &quot;Oh Happy Band!&quot; lasted one series.

Kaye had a small part in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s film &quot;Brazil&quot; as desk clerk M.O.I. Lobby Porter and appeared in Gilliam&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; as Sister Jessica.

He played Dr Grant in a television adaptation of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and Lymoges, Duke of Austria in the 1984 BBC production of &quot;King John&quot; by Shakespeare. He also toured in the National Theatre production of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, as Touchstone. The same year, he appeared as hard man Sammy, an enforcer employed by agoraphobic bookmaker Albert Wendle in the &quot;Minder&quot; episode &quot;Get Daley!&quot;

In 1990, Kaye played the fictional local television presenter Maynard Lavery in an edition of &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;.
In the early 1990s he made a guest appearance in a Christmas special of &quot;Family Fortunes&quot;, in which he served as team captain and placed host Les Dennis on a special &quot;Double Big Money&quot; round for Dennis to score more than one hundred points to double the charity prize money, which he did. In 1995 Kaye played Monsieur Pamplemousse in a BBC Radio three-part adaption of Michael Bond&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Monsieur Pamplemousse Investigates&quot;.

===&quot;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;===
In 1982, David Croft sent Kaye the script for the pilot episode of &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; inviting him to play the central character of René Artois. He accepted and appeared in all 85 episodes (the main series ran from 1984, two years after the pilot, until 1992) and 1,200 performances of the stage version.

Kaye was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1986 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the curtain call of the West End stage version of &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; at the Prince of Wales Theatre.

Kaye returned as René Artois in a 2007 one-off television revival of &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; and in a stage show in Brisbane, Australia, at the Twelfth Night Theatre in June and July, alongside Sue Hodge as Mimi Labonq and Guy Siner as Lieutenant Gruber. The other characters were portrayed by Australian actors, including Katy Manning, Steven Tandy, Chloe Dallimore, and Jason Gann.

==Personal life==
Kaye&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;René and Me: An Autobiography&quot; (co-written with Hilary Bonner), was published in 1989. In the book, he described his experiences as a shy, gay, overweight, typecast youth. The unusual spelling of his name (usually spelt &quot;Gordon&quot;) was the result of a British Actors&#x27; Equity Association typing error.

Kaye suffered serious life-threatening head injuries in a car accident while driving his Honda CRX, during the Burns&#x27; Day Storm in London on 25 January 1990. Although he could not remember any details of the incident, he retained a scar on his forehead from a piece of wooden advertising hoarding that had smashed through the car windscreen. He was rescued by the police and taken to Charing Cross Hospital.

Writing in his memoirs, &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; co-writer Jeremy Lloyd said he visited Kaye in hospital, adding, &quot;I believe part of his recovery was due to his agent getting a video and showing reruns of &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; to remind him who he was.&quot; While recovering in hospital from emergency brain surgery to treat injuries sustained in the accident, Kaye was photographed and interviewed by two &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; journalists, Gary Thompson and Ray Levine. On Kaye&#x27;s behalf, his agent Peter Froggatt, sued the newspaper, but the Court of Appeal held, in &quot;Kaye v Robertson&quot;, that there was no remedy in English law for an invasion of privacy.

==Death==
Kaye suffered from dementia and spent the last two years of his life in a care home in Knaresborough, where he died, on 23 January 2017, aged 75. His funeral was held at Huddersfield Parish Church on 17 February. His co-stars from &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; Vicki Michelle, Sue Hodge and Kim Hartman attended, as did Ken Morley, who gave a tribute. The unofficial Yorkshire anthem &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot; was sung at the service.

<text>William John Hunter (27 February 194021 May 2011) was an Australian actor of film, stage and television, who was also prominent as a voice-over artist. He appeared in more than 60 films and won two AFI Awards. He was also a recipient of the Centenary Medal.

==Early life==
William John Hunter was born on 27 February 1940 in Ballarat, Victoria, the son of William and Francie Hunter. He had a brother, John, and a sister, Marie Ann.

During his teens, Hunter was a champion swimmer, and briefly held a world record for the 100 yards freestyle until his record was broken by John Devitt in the very next heat 10 minutes later. Hunter qualified for the Australian swimming team for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia before a bout of meningitis ended his Olympic hopes.

==Career==
Hunter made his film debut as an extra in 1957 film &quot;The Shiralee&quot;. An introduction to Ava Gardner saw him gain a job as an extra and swimming double in the Hollywood film &quot;On the Beach&quot;, which was filming in Melbourne. Hunter claimed that he was inspired to take up acting after watching one of the leads (variously claimed to be either Gregory Peck or Fred Astaire) do 27 takes of a scene, and thinking he could do better. He took an intensive drama course in Melbourne and sailed aboard the RHMS Ellinis on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1964 for England. There he won a two-year scholarship to the prestigious Northampton Repertory Company in England. In 1966, Hunter made his first television appearance, two episodes in &quot;The Ark&quot;, a serial within the third season of the BBC television drama series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Hunter returned to Australia in 1967 and began working in television drama and feature films. He had interviewed with Gavrik Losey in London, making no great impression in that highly competitive atmosphere, but Losey was able to offer Hunter his first Australian film appearance in &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; in 1970 with Losey as production supervisor. Hunter often played characters who were the strong, opinionated, archetypal gruff Australian whose exterior belies a softer heart and sensibilities vulnerable to pressure.

Some of his most notable movie roles include &quot;Mad Dog Morgan&quot; (1976), &quot;Newsfront&quot; (1978), &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981), &quot;The Dismissal&quot;, &quot;Scales of Justice&quot; (1983), &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; (1992), &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1994), &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; (1994) and &quot;Australia&quot; (2008). In 2007, he reprised the role of Bob in the Australian touring stage production of &quot;Priscilla&quot;. He also provided the voice of the dentist in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003) and the voice of Bubo in &quot;Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga&#x27;Hoole&quot; (2010). He portrayed United Nations Secretary General Spencer Chartwell in the American science fiction series &quot;&quot;. His last film role was in &quot;The Cup&quot; (2011).

Of acting, Hunter said, &quot;As long as the director told me where to stand and what to say, I was happy. Anyone who says there&#x27;s any more to it than that, is full of bullshit. ... It&#x27;s a job. It is a craft, but there&#x27;s no art involved. What you need is common sense and a reasonably rough head. You put on the makeup and the wardrobe, and that is half the performance. That upsets the purists, but never mind, they don&#x27;t work as much as I do.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
Hunter won the 1978 AFI Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for &quot;Newsfront&quot;, and the 1981 Best Supporting Actor award for &quot;Gallipoli&quot;.

In 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal &quot;for service to acting, including the films &quot;Gallipoli&quot; and &quot;Frontline&quot;.

A painting of Hunter by artist Jason Benjamin won the Packing Room Prize in conjunction with the 2005 Archibald Prize.

==Personal life==
Hunter was a supporter of the Australian Labor Party, appearing in the party&#x27;s official 1996 Federal Election Campaign advertisement.

Hunter&#x27;s first marriage was to Robbie Anderson from 1963 to 1973, with whom he had a son, named James Hunter. His next marriage was to actress Pat Bishop, in 1976. According to writer Bob Ellis, the marriage was short-lived after Hunter ran off with their marriage celebrant.

His third marriage was to artist and television presenter Rhoda Roberts, in 1993. They lived together until 1999, when he suddenly announced that he wanted to leave the marriage. She did not know why until he visited her shortly before his death in 2011 and told her that he did not want her to have to nurse him. They did not, however, get divorced. She also said that, despite the common perception that he contracted liver cancer because he drank too much, he was in Alcoholics Anonymous when they met and was not a drunk.

==Death==
On 15 May 2011, Hunter was admitted to Caritas Christi hospice in Kew, after refusing to go to a hospital. Surrounded by family and friends, he died of liver cancer on 21 May 2011, aged 71.

A memorial service for Hunter was held at Melbourne&#x27;s Princess Theatre on 26 May 2011. Close friend and co-star Mick Molloy paid tribute to Bill Hunter on stage at the 54th Logie Awards in April 2012.

<doc id="1199405" wikidata="Q1094864" url="?curid=1199405" title="Cochin chicken">
<text>The Cochin is a breed of large domestic chicken. It derives from large feather-legged chickens brought from China to Europe and North America in the 1840s and 1850s. It is reared principally for exhibition. It was formerly known as the Cochin-China.

==History==

Like the Brahma, the Cochin derives from very large feather-legged chickens brought from China to Europe and North America in the 1840s and 1850s. These were at first known as &quot;Shanghai&quot; birds, and later as &quot;Cochin-Chinas&quot;. The large size and striking appearance of these birds contributed to a sudden large increase of interest in poultry-breeding in Western countries, sometimes described as &quot;hen fever&quot;.

The Cochin was included in the first edition of the &quot;Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry&quot;, prepared by William Bernhardt Tegetmeier for the first Poultry Club of Great Britain in 1865. The colours described are buff, black, cinnamon, grouse, lemon, partridge, silver buff, silver cinnamon, and white. Bantam Cochins were not listed.

The Cochin, both full-sized and bantam, was included in the first edition of the &quot;Standard of Excellence&quot; of the American Poultry Association in 1874. The original colours were white, partridge, buff and black; other colours were later added.

== Characteristics ==

The most distinctive feature of the Cochin is the excessive plumage that covers leg and foot. The skin beneath the feathers is yellow.

In the United Kingdom the recognised colour varieties, for large fowl only, are black, blue, buff, cuckoo, partridge and grouse, and white; Cochin bantams are not recognised by the Poultry Club of Great Britain. However, the Entente Européenne treats the Pekin Bantam as equivalent to the bantam Cochin. The Entente Européenne lists the same nine colours for large fowl, and twenty-four for the bantam; any of the bantam varieties may be frizzled, with the feathers curling outwards. The American Poultry Association recognises nine colours for the full-sized bird – barred, black, blue, brown, buff, golden-laced, partridge, silver-laced, and white; the same colours are recognised for the bantam, with the addition of four more: birchen, Columbian, mottled, and red.

== Use ==

The Cochin has been bred principally for exhibition, at the expense of productive characteristics. It is a good layer of very large tinted eggs, and lays well in winter. The hens are good sitters and good mothers, and may be used to hatch the eggs of turkeys and ducks. The meat tends to be coarse in texture and excessively dark; capons slaughtered at an age of 12–16 months provide a good large table bird.

<doc id="1199406" wikidata="Q1439409" url="?curid=1199406" title="JFK Reloaded">
<text>JFK Reloaded is a 2004 first-person shooter game developed and published by Traffic Games. It simulates the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, according to the report of the Warren Commission. The player, controlling Lee Harvey Oswald, is tasked with recreating the three shots fired at Kennedy and gains higher scores the more accurately they line up with the report. Shots can be reviewed in slow motion and from multiple viewpoints.

Traffic Games founder Kirk Ewing envisioned a small-scale simulation of a historical event after leaving VIS Entertainment. He chose Kennedy&#x27;s killing over the Apollo 11 Moon landing in part due to the high amount of public domain information available on the former. A team of ten people worked in the game engine of &quot;Carmageddon&quot; to accurately recreate the event, taking several months each for research and development. Released on November 22, 2004, the 41st anniversary of the assassination, &quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; was denounced by public figures, including the spokesman for Kennedy&#x27;s brother Ted Kennedy.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; is a first-person shooter. It recreates the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, as it occurred on November 22, 1963, according to the report of the Warren Commission. The player controls Lee Harvey Oswald from the sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas. As Kennedy&#x27;s motorcade passes by on Dealey Plaza, the player has to take three shots at the president with their sniper rifle. They gain points based on how closely these shots match the Warren Commission&#x27;s report: The first has to miss the car, the second hit Kennedy in the neck and John Connally (the governor of Texas) in the chest, and the third fatally wound Kennedy in the head. The perfect score is 1,000. While the game does not halt the player from pursuing alternative scenarios, the score is deducted from when the player deviates from the event, such as by hitting Jacqueline Kennedy, the first lady.

&quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; includes a &quot;Chaos Meter&quot; that controls how heavily the motorcade&#x27;s drivers are affected by panic. Following each game, individual shots can be replayed in slow motion and with a close-up on each bullet. The scene can be viewed from several angles, including from the grassy knoll, the location of the Zapruder film, and a virtual camera mounted to Kennedy&#x27;s limousine. The player can further enable blood splatter effects and exaggerated physics.

== Development and release ==
&quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; was developed by Traffic Management Limited (trade name: Traffic Games), a company based in Stirling, Scotland. The company&#x27;s founder and managing director, Kirk Ewing, had previously worked at VIS Entertainment as the creative director for the 2002 game &quot;State of Emergency&quot;, which had been criticized for replicating the 1999 Seattle WTO protests. Having worked on projects as large as &quot;State of Emergency&quot;, Ewing wanted to focus on smaller ventures. Establishing Traffic Games, he intended to create a game based on a historical event and initially considered modeling one after the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Ewing later settled on the assassination of Kennedy because there was a high amount of public domain information documenting the event. He also noted that ballistics simulations were a staple of video games and that many other forms of media had already covered the incident.

Ewing sought help from a friend at Stainless Games, the developer of &quot;Carmageddon&quot;. The friend was fond of the game idea and provided Traffic Games with &quot;Carmageddon&quot;″s game engine. Therein, the &quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; development team reconstructed the site of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination with accurate object placements and apt weather conditions. According to Ewing, one aim of the development was to disprove conspiracy theories surrounding the event by displaying that Oswald would have been capable to perform the shooting in the given conditions of that day. The ten-person development team, composed of former &quot;State of Emergency&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Killzone&quot; developers, took several months to research the matter, followed by six months of producing the game.

Before the game&#x27;s release, Ewing sent a letter to Ted Kennedy (John F. Kennedy&#x27;s brother and a United States senator for Massachusetts), who was informed of the game on November 19, 2004. Traffic Games announced &quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; on November 21 and released it on November 22, the 41st anniversary of the assassination. It was the company&#x27;s first release. Traffic Games distributed the game commercially and alongside a free demo via the game&#x27;s website. The site was set to remain available for three months. To boost the game&#x27;s commercial performance, the company held a month-long competition for players to replicate the shooting as accurately as possible. The reward was a cash prize of up to , depending on the game&#x27;s revenue. &quot;Major_Koenig&quot;, a 16-year-old boy from Paris, won with a score of 782 and received .

== Reception ==
&quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; was denounced by several public figures: David Smith, a spokesman for Ted Kennedy, stated simply that &quot;It&#x27;s despicable.&quot; Senator Joe Lieberman was &quot;sickened&quot; by the game, according to his spokesman Casey Aden-Wansbury. Politician John Kasich discussed the game in his book &quot;Stand for Something: The Battle for America&#x27;s Soul&quot; in a segment about graphic content in mainstream video games: &quot;I&#x27;m telling you, &quot;despicable&quot; doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe some of these things.&quot; The Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning it. Presidential historian G. Calvin Mackenzie considered &quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; to be &quot;in incredibly bad taste&quot; and noted that &quot;marketing it as an educational tool seems to stretch the notion of education beyond belief&quot;. The game was attacked by members of the public online, on television, and in print media. Ewing claimed to have received death threats. He responded that the controversy was &quot;understandable given the fact that many people were alive at that time and still have vivid memories of the event&quot; but stated that &quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; neither condoned nor glorified the event. In retrospect, Ewing said he regretted tying a cash prize to killing Kennedy, saying that he had been &quot;naïve&quot; and had &quot;underestimated the deepness of affection for Kennedy held by many American people&quot;.

&quot;Slate&quot;″s Clive Thompson lauded &quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; for its realistic bullet physics and labeled it a &quot;remarkable&quot; physics simulation. However, he stated that the game was a &quot;nauseating&quot; experience because it saw the player shoot and kill real people, some of whom still had living relatives, as opposed to other games. He further felt that &quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; did not aim at provoking the catharsis other works of art brought about. Jefferson Morley, in his editorial for &quot;Salon&quot;, cited an &quot;undeniable appeal&quot; to the game&#x27;s re-enactment of the assassination and the &quot;antisocial pleasure&quot; he associated with it. He cited the ability to give the killing a motive as part of this appeal. The review aggregator website Metacritic calculated a weighted average rating of 69/100, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, based on four critic reviews. Fans of &quot;JFK Reloaded&quot; asked Traffic Games to also produce a game that simulated the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.

<text>Dose is the second studio album by American rock band Gov&#x27;t Mule. It was released on February 24, 1998, by Capricorn Records and (on vinyl) by Evil Teen Records. It was produced, recorded and mixed by Michael Barbiero and is a much darker record than Gov&#x27;t Mule&#x27;s self-titled debut album. The songs &quot;Thelonius Beck&quot; and &quot;Birth of the Mule&quot; were tributes to jazz musicians Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis, respectively, whereas the subtitle &quot;Beck&quot; refers to Jeff Beck, who also recorded a song named &quot;Thelonius&quot;.

== Track listing ==
All songs written by Warren Haynes unless otherwise noted.

The bonus track appears on the limited edition vinyl version released by Evil Teen Records. It&#x27;s an acoustic version recorded at Outback Lodge, Charlottesville, in May 1998.

== Personnel ==
* Warren Haynes – vocals, guitar, percussion
* Matt Abts – drums, percussion
* Allen Woody – bass, mandolin
* Michael Barbiero – production, tambourine on &quot;John the Revelator&quot;

<text>&quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; is a song written by Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager.

It was first recorded in 1975 by The Stylistics, then covered by Rod Stewart in 1982 for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Night Shift&quot;, but it is best known for the 1985 version by Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Gladys Knight, and Stevie Wonder. This recording, billed as being by Dionne Warwick &amp; Friends, was released as a charity single for AIDS research and prevention. It was a massive hit, becoming the number-one single of 1986 in the United States, and winning the Grammy Awards for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Song of the Year. It raised more than $3 million for its cause.

==Rod Stewart version==
&quot;That’s What Friends Are For&quot; was included on the expanded edition of the 2008 remaster of the album &quot;Body Wishes&quot;.

===Personnel===
* Rod Stewart – vocals
* Jim Cregan – guitar, background vocals
* Jimmy &quot;Z&quot; Zavala – saxophone
* Kevin Savigar – keyboards
* Jay Davis – bass
* Tony Brock – drums, background vocals

==Dionne Warwick version==
Dionne Warwick&#x27;s recording of &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; marked the first time she had worked with Bacharach since the 1970s, when Warwick felt abandoned by Bacharach and Hal David dissolving their partnership. Warwick said of their reconciliation:

A one-off collaboration headed by Warwick and featuring Gladys Knight, Elton John, and Stevie Wonder, with a different second verse, was released as a charity single in the UK and the US in 1985. The song is in the key of E major. It was recorded as a benefit for the American Foundation for AIDS Research, and raised more than US$3 million for that cause. Warwick, who had previously raised money for blood-related diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, wanted to help combat the then-growing AIDS epidemic because she had seen friends die painfully of the disease. John plays piano and Wonder plays harmonica on the song; the two had previously worked together on 1983&#x27;s &quot;I Guess That&#x27;s Why They Call It the Blues&quot;.

In the US, the song held the number-one spot of the adult contemporary chart for two weeks, the number-one spot of the soul chart for three weeks, and the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four weeks. It became &quot;Billboard&quot;″s number one single of 1986. It was certified Gold on January 15, 1986, by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was the final US number one for all but John (John would have two more US number-ones during the 1990s). Due to Wonder&#x27;s involvement, it also holds the distinction of being the last number-one song for anyone who had topped the charts before the British Invasion (his first number-one hit, &quot;Fingertips&quot;, came in 1963).

Outside the United States, the song topped the charts in Canada and Australia and reached the top 10 in Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, and Sweden. On the UK Singles Chart, the song debuted at number 49 and climbed to its peak of number 16 three weeks later, staying at that position for another week before descending the chart. It remained in the UK top 100 for a further five weeks, totaling 10 weeks on the chart altogether.

The Dionne and Friends version of the song won the performers the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, as well as Song of the Year for its writers, Bacharach and Bayer Sager. This rendition is also listed at number 75 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s Greatest Songs of all time.&quot;

Warwick, John, Knight, and Wonder performed the song live together for the first time in 23 years at the 25th Anniversary amfAR gala in New York City on February 10, 2011.

== 1990 benefit concert ==
On March 17, 1990, an AIDS benefit titled &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For: Arista Records 15th Anniversary Concert&quot; was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. One month later, CBS aired a two-hour version of the concert on television. The celebrity guests and performers were: Luther Vandross, Air Supply, Lauren Bacall, Burt Bacharach, Eric Carmen, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Clive Davis, Taylor Dayne, Michael Douglas, Exposé, Whoopi Goldberg, Melanie Griffith, Hall &amp; Oates, Jennifer Holliday, Whitney Houston, Alan Jackson, Kenny G, Melissa Manchester, Barry Manilow, Milli Vanilli, Jeffrey Osborne, Carly Simon, Patti Smith, Lisa Stansfield, The Four Tops, and Dionne Warwick. &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; was the finale song sung by Warwick and cousin Houston before being joined on the stage by the other guests of the event. More than $2.5 million was raised that night for the Arista Foundation which gave the proceeds to various AIDS organizations.

== Other versions ==

In September 2023, British actor-singers Denise van Outen and Duncan James released a duet version in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support, which was recorded in tribute to their friend, singer Sarah Harding, who died from breast cancer in 2021.

In 2024, Warwick took part in a parody version of the song for a Capital One commercial celebrating the annual NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

<doc id="1199421" wikidata="Q1074289" url="?curid=1199421" title="Frequency multiplier">
<text>In electronics, a frequency multiplier is an electronic circuit that generates an output signal which has a frequency that is a harmonic (multiple) of its input frequency. 
Frequency multipliers consist of a nonlinear circuit that distorts the input signal and consequently generates harmonics of the input signal. A subsequent bandpass filter selects the desired harmonic frequency and removes the unwanted fundamental and other harmonics from the output.

Frequency multipliers are often used in frequency synthesizers and communications circuits. It can be more economical to develop a lower frequency signal with lower power and less expensive devices, and then use a frequency multiplier chain to generate an output frequency in the microwave or millimeter wave range. Some modulation schemes, such as frequency modulation, survive the nonlinear distortion without ill effect (but schemes such as amplitude modulation do not).

Frequency multiplication is also used in nonlinear optics. The nonlinear distortion in crystals can be used to generate harmonics of laser light.

==Theory==
A pure sine wave has a single frequency &quot;f&quot; 
:formula_1
If the sine wave is applied to a linear circuit, such as a non–distortion amplifier, the output is still a sine wave (but may acquire a phase shift).
However, if the sine wave is applied to a nonlinear circuit, the resulting distortion creates harmonics; frequency components at integer multiples &quot;nf&quot; of the fundamental frequency &quot;f&quot;. The distorted signal can be described by a Fourier series in &quot;f&quot;.

:formula_2

The nonzero &quot;ck&quot; represent the generated harmonics. The Fourier coefficients are given by integrating over the fundamental period &quot;T&quot;:

:formula_3

So a frequency multiplier can be built from a nonlinear electronic component which generates a series of harmonics, followed by a bandpass filter which passes one of the harmonics to the output and blocks the others.

From a conversion efficiency standpoint, the nonlinear circuit should maximize the coefficient for the desired harmonic and minimize the others. Consequently, the transcribing function is often specially chosen. Easy choices are to use an even function to generate even harmonics or an odd function for odd harmonics. See Even and odd functions#Harmonics. A full wave rectifier, for example, is good for making a doubler. To produce a times-3 multiplier, the original signal may be input to an amplifier that is over driven to produce nearly a square wave. This signal is high in 3rd order harmonics and can be filtered to produce the desired
x3 outcome.

YIG multipliers often want to select an arbitrary harmonic, so they use a stateful distortion circuit that converts the input sine wave into an approximate impulse train. The ideal (but impractical) impulse train generates an infinite number of (weak) harmonics. In practice, an impulse train generated by a monostable circuit will have many usable harmonics. YIG multipliers using step recovery diodes may, for example, take an input frequency of 1 to 2 GHz and produce outputs up to 18 GHz. Sometimes the frequency multiplier circuit will adjust the width of the impulses to improve conversion efficiency for a specific harmonic.

==Circuits==

===Diode===
Clipping circuits. Full wave bridge doubler.

===Class C amplifier and multiplier===
Efficiently generating power becomes more important at high power levels. Linear Class A amplifiers are at best 25 percent efficient. Push-pull Class B amplifiers are at best 50 percent efficient. The basic problem is the amplifying element is dissipating power. Switching Class C amplifiers are nonlinear, but they can be better than 50 percent efficient because an ideal switch does not dissipate any power.

A clever design can use the nonlinear Class C amplifier for both gain and as a frequency multiplier.

===Step recovery diode===
Generating a large number of useful harmonics requires a fast nonlinear device, such as a step recovery diode.

Microwave generators may use a step recovery diode impulse generator followed by a tunable YIG filter. The YIG filter has a yttrium iron garnet sphere that is tuned with a magnetic field. The step recovery diode impulse generator is driven at a subharmonic of the desired output frequency. An electromagnet then tunes the YIG filter to select the desired harmonic.

===Varactor diode===
Resistive loaded varactors. Regenerative varactors. Penfield.

Frequency multipliers have much in common with frequency mixers, and some of the same nonlinear devices are used for both: transistors operated in Class C and diodes. In transmitting circuits many of the amplifying devices (vacuum tubes or transistors) operate nonlinearly and create harmonics, so an amplifier stage can be made a multiplier by tuning the tuned circuit at the output to a multiple of the input frequency. Usually the power (gain) produced by the nonlinear device drops off rapidly at the higher harmonics, so most frequency multipliers just double or triple the frequency, and multiplication by higher factors is accomplished by cascading doubler and tripler stages.

===Previous uses===
Frequency multipliers use circuits tuned to a harmonic of the input frequency. Non-linear elements such as diodes may be added to enhance the production of harmonic frequencies. Since the power in the harmonics declines rapidly, usually a frequency multiplier is tuned to only a small multiple (twice, three times, or five times) of the input frequency. Usually amplifiers are inserted in a chain of frequency multipliers to ensure adequate signal level at the final frequency.

Since the tuned circuits have a limited bandwidth, if the base frequency is changed significantly (more than one percent or so), the multiplier stages may have to be adjusted; this can take significant time if there are many stages.

===Microelectromechanical (MEMS) frequency doubler===
An electric-field driven micromechanical cantilever resonator is one of the most fundamental and widely studied structures in MEMS, which can provide a high Q and narrow bandpass filtering function. The inherent square-law nonlinearity of the voltage-to-force transfer function of a cantilever resonator&#x27;s capacitive transducer can be employed for the realization of frequency doubling effect. Due to the low-loss attribute (or equivalently, a high Q) offered by MEMS devices, improved circuit performance can be expected from a micromechanical frequency doubler than semiconductor devices utilized for the same task.

===Graphene based frequency multipliers===
Graphene based FETs have also been employed for frequency doubling with more than 90% converting efficiency.

In fact, all ambipolar transistors can be used for designing frequency multiplier circuits. Graphene can work over a large frequency range due to its unique characteristics.

==Phase-locked loops with frequency dividers==

A phase-locked loop (PLL) uses a reference frequency to generate a multiple of that frequency. A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is initially tuned roughly to the range of the desired frequency multiple. The signal from the VCO is divided down using frequency dividers by the multiplication factor. The divided
signal and the reference frequency are fed into a phase comparator. The output of the phase comparator is
a voltage that is proportional to the phase difference. After passing through a low pass filter and being converted to the proper voltage range, this voltage is fed to the VCO to adjust the frequency. This adjustment increases the frequency as the phase of the VCO&#x27;s signal lags that of the reference signal and decreases the frequency as the lag decreases (or lead increases). The VCO will stabilize at the desired frequency multiple. This type of PLL is a type of frequency synthesizer.

===Fractional-N synthesizer===

In some PLLs the reference frequency may also be divided by an integer multiple before being input to the phase comparator. This allows the synthesis of frequencies that are N/M times the reference frequency.

This can be accomplished in a different manner by periodically changing the integer value of an integer-N frequency divider, effectively resulting in a multiplier with both whole number and fractional component. Such a multiplier is called a fractional-N synthesizer after its fractional component. Fractional-N synthesizers provide an effective means of achieving fine frequency resolution with lower values of N, allowing loop architectures with tens of thousands of times less phase noise than alternative designs with lower reference frequencies and higher integer N values. They also allow a faster settling time because of their higher reference frequencies, allowing wider closed and open loop bandwidths.

====Delta sigma synthesizer====
A delta sigma synthesizer adds a randomization to programmable-N frequency divider of the fractional-N synthesizer. This is done to shrink sidebands created by periodic changes of an integer-N frequency divider.

<doc id="1199424" wikidata="Q378291" url="?curid=1199424" title="Hotter than July">
<text>Hotter than July is the nineteenth studio album by American singer, songwriter, and musician Stevie Wonder, released on September 29, 1980, by Tamla, a subsidiary of Motown Records. Wonder primarily recorded the album in Los Angeles, California, at Wonderland Studios, which he had recently acquired. The album peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 3, 1981. It was Wonder&#x27;s most successful album in the UK, where it peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and produced four top-10 singles. Music videos were produced for the album&#x27;s first, third, and fourth singles.

The album was nominated for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album at the 1982 American Music Awards.

==Background==
The relative critical and commercial failure of Wonder&#x27;s previous album &quot;Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot; (1979), from which only one single (&quot;Send One Your Love&quot;) reached the top 5 of a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, left him struggling at the turn of the new decade, and he let the media know he felt Motown had not promoted that album very well. During this time of upheaval, Wonder co-wrote the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Serious&quot; with Lee Garrett for Jermaine Jackson&#x27;s 1980 album of the same name and the song &quot;You Are My Heaven&quot; with Eric Mercury, which became a success for Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway on Atlantic Records. Wonder was also in demand as a guest on the recordings of artists such as B.B. King, James Taylor, Quincy Jones, and Smokey Robinson.

In addition to performing, Wonder handled the writing, arranging, and producing of &quot;Hotter than July&quot;, which was primarily recorded in Los Angeles at his newly-acquired Wonderland Studios. &quot;Master Blaster (Jammin&#x27;)&quot; (US No. 5; R&amp;B No. 1), the album&#x27;s lead-off single, was inspired by the reggae music of Bob Marley, who Wonder had met in 1979 after their performance at the Black Music Association in Philadelphia. The country-tinged &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Stand for It&quot; (U.S. No. 11; R&amp;B No. 4), the ballad &quot;Lately&quot; (U.S. No. 64) and the upbeat &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; were other notable successes from the album. In the UK, all four singles reached the top 10, with the first and fourth releases peaking at No. 2.

&quot;All I Do&quot; had originally been written by a teenaged Wonder and collaborators Clarence Paul and Morris Broadnax in 1966. Tammi Terrell recorded the first version of the song that year, but it remained in the Motown vaults until it was included in the compilation &quot;A Cellarful of Motown!&quot; in the UK in 2002, 32 years after Terrell&#x27;s death. Brenda Holloway also recorded a version of the song, which was released in 2005 on her &quot;Motown Anthology&quot; set. Michael Jackson, Eddie Levert and Walter Williams of the O&#x27;Jays, and Betty Wright provided backing vocals for Wonder&#x27;s recording of the song for &quot;Hotter than July&quot;. The backing vocals for &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Stand for It&quot; were handled by Charlie and Ronnie Wilson of the GAP Band, and Wonder&#x27;s ex-wife Syreeta backed Wonder on &quot;As If You Read My Mind&quot;.

While a number of Wonder&#x27;s previous works, such as &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; and &quot;Innervisions&quot;, had received wide critical acclaim and had chart success, &quot;Hotter than July&quot; was his first album eligible to be certified Platinum by the RIAA, as Motown sales records before 1977 were not audited by the organization after they introduced the category.

==Sleeve liner design and Martin Luther King Jr. Day activism==
Wonder wrote &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to honor Martin Luther King Jr. and used the song to campaign for King&#x27;s birthday, January 15, to become a national holiday in the United States (Martin Luther King Jr. Day would be declared a federal holiday in 1983, and first be celebrated nationwide in 1986). The design of &quot;Hotter than July&quot;&#x27;s original record sleeve is also dedicated to these two purposes. Both sides of the sleeve are printed in a black-and-white semi-glossy photographic process. One side features a large square photographic portrait of King inset on a black background with white lettering above and below. Above the photo is printed &quot;Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot; &quot;January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968&quot; (on two lines, centered), and below it appears a passage of text written by Wonder, which reads:

It is believed that for a man to lay down his life for the love of others is the supreme sacrifice. Jesus Christ by his own example showed us that there is no greater love. For nearly two thousand years now we have been striving to have the strength to follow that example. Martin Luther King was a man who had that strength. He showed us, non-violently, a better way of life, a way of mutual respect, helping us to avoid much bitter confrontation and inevitable bloodshed. We still have a long road to travel until we reach the world that was his dream. We in the United States must not forget either his supreme sacrifice or that dream.

I and a growing number of people believe that it is time for our country to adopt legislation that will make January 15, Martin Luther King&#x27;s birthday, a national holiday, both in recognition of what he achieved and as a reminder of the distance which still has to be traveled.

Join me in the observance of January 15, 1981 as a national holiday.

Stevland Morris a/k/a Stevie Wonder

To the right of this text is a thumbprint, presumably Stevie Wonder&#x27;s (Stevland Morris&#x27;s), serving as his signature.

On the other side of the record sleeve is a collage of five historical photos: one filling the top third, three sharing the middle third, and one filling the bottom third. The top image is an aerial view of a low-lying urban area with a six-lane highway passing through it and thick smoke rising from many of the buildings on both sides of the highway—presumably a riot is taking place. The center three images consist of a central rectangular photo of a large peaceful demonstration march, with both black and white participants, being led by Martin Luther King Jr. and two square flanking photos of apparent police brutality: in the photo to the left, three officers in white helmets, one of whom is holding a club, are grabbing a male African-American youth by his arms and one leg, and, in the photo to the right, an officer in a white helmet stands in the foreground and looks toward an African-American man lying in a pool of blood on the sidewalk in front of an urban store, while another African-American man crouches with his back against the wall and looks away (King directly mentioned police brutality in his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech). The bottom image shows a confrontation in an urban street four or five lanes wide between a large group of African Americans standing in non-violent defiance and law enforcement officers in white helmets who appear to be advancing with weapons. These images contrast with the upbeat and positive mood of the music on most of the album—&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; included. Exceptions are the few songs about romantic turmoil (&quot;Rocket Love&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Stand for It&quot;, &quot;Lately&quot;) and the socially critical &quot;Cash in Your Face&quot;, which protests racial housing discrimination.

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Stephen Holden said &quot;Hotter than July&quot; proved Wonder was still &quot;our most gifted pop muralist&quot; because of his evocative, unique synthesis of pop and African elements. The album was voted the eighth best of 1980 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. Robert Christgau, that poll&#x27;s creator, ranked the album eighteenth on his own year-end list and wrote in a retrospective review that, while &quot;Master Blaster&quot; and perhaps &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; were the only &quot;great Stevie here&quot;, the pleasure with which Wonder performed the songs was evident in &quot;his free-floating melodicism and his rolling overdrive, his hope and his cynicism&quot;. In a review in &quot;(The New) Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, J. D. Considine called the album &quot;buoyantly tuneful&quot; and said fans viewed it as a return to form for Wonder after the commercial disappointment of &quot;Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants&quot;.

Rob Theakston of &quot;Allmusic&quot; claimed &quot;Solid songwriting, musicianship, and production are evident in the majority of Hotter Than July...While most definitely not on the same tier as Innervisions or Songs in the Key of Life, Hotter Than July is the portrait of an artist who still had the Midas touch, but stood at the crossroads of an illustrious career.&quot; Hanif Abdurraqib of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; also described Hotter than July as &quot;an album of seemingly endless abundance. An album that asks not only &#x27;How do you want to feel?&#x27; but also, &#x27;How do you want to survive?&#x27; and then turns us towards the expansive forest of ever-shifting answers.&quot;

<text>Whelks are any of several carnivorous sea snail species with a swirling, tapered shell. Many are eaten by humans, such as the common whelk of the North Atlantic. Most whelks belong to the family Buccinidae and are known as &quot;true whelks.&quot; Others, such as the dog whelk, belong to several sea snail families that are not closely related. 

True whelks (family Buccinidae) are carnivorous, and feed on annelids, crustaceans, mussels and other molluscs, drilling holes through shells to gain access to the soft tissues. Whelks use chemoreceptors to locate their prey.

Many have historically been used, or are still used, by humans and other animals as food. In a reference serving of whelk, there are of food energy, 24 g of protein, 0.34 g of fat, and 8 g of carbohydrates.

Dog whelk, a predatory species, was used in antiquity to make a rich red dye that improves in color as it ages.

==Usage==
The common name &quot;whelk&quot; is also spelled &quot;welk&quot; or even &quot;wilk&quot;.

The species, genera and families referred to by this common name vary a great deal from one geographic area to another.

===Asia===

In Japan, are frequently used in sashimi and sushi. In Vietnam, they are served in a dish called &quot;Bún ốc&quot; - vermicelli with sea snails. &quot;&quot; () is a Korean dish consisting of whelks and with chili sauce in a salad with cold noodles. It has been a very popular side dish with alcohol for many generations.

===Australia, New Zealand===
In Australia and New Zealand, species of the genus &quot;Cabestana&quot; (family Ranellidae) are called &quot;predatory whelks&quot;, and species of &quot;Penion&quot; (family Buccinidae) are called &quot;siphon whelks&quot;.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, there is a very popular Afro-Brazilian divination game practiced by older women of African ancestry called &quot;jogo de búzios&quot; (game of whelks), which uses empty shells of these gastropods.

=== United Kingdom and Ireland, Belgium, Netherlands===
In the British Isles, Belgium and the Netherlands (&quot;wulk&quot;/&quot;wullok&quot;), the word is used for a number of species in the family Buccinidae, especially &quot;Buccinum undatum&quot;, an edible European and Northern Atlantic species.

In the British Isles, the common name &quot;dog whelk&quot; is used for &quot;Nucella lapillus&quot; (family Muricidae) and for &quot;Nassarius&quot; species (family Nassariidae). Historically, they were a popular street food in Victorian London, typically located close to public houses and theatres.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, the word &quot;whelk&quot; is also used to mean the periwinkle (&quot;Littorina littorea&quot;), family Littorinidae.
===United States===
In the United States, &quot;whelk&quot; refers to several large edible species in the genera &quot;Busycon&quot; and &quot;Busycotypus&quot;, which are now classified in the family Buccinidae. These are sometimes called &quot;Busycon whelks&quot;.

In addition, the unrelated invasive murex &quot;Rapana venosa&quot; is referred to as the &quot;Veined rapa whelk&quot; or &quot;Asian rapa whelk&quot; in the family Muricidae.

===West Indies===
In the English-speaking islands of the West Indies, the word &quot;whelks&quot; or &quot;wilks&quot; (this word is both singular and plural) is applied to a large edible top shell, &quot;Cittarium pica&quot;, also known as the &quot;magpie&quot; or &quot;West Indian top shell&quot;, family Trochidae.

==Some common examples==
* Channeled whelk
* Common whelk
* Knobbed whelk, the state shell of Georgia and New Jersey
* Lightning whelk
* Red whelk
* Speckled whelk
* &quot;Wrinkled whelk&quot;, &quot;inflated whelk&quot;, and &quot;lyre whelk&quot;, common names for &quot;Neptunea lyrata&quot;

<doc id="1199443" wikidata="Q954671" url="?curid=1199443" title="Life Before Insanity">
<text>Life Before Insanity is the third studio album by Gov&#x27;t Mule. The album was released on February 15, 2000, by Capricorn Records.

The album peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Album Chart.

==Production==
The album was produced by Michael Barbiero. Unlike the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Life Before Insanity&quot; utilized both overdubbing and multiple guest musicians. It was the last album recorded with founding member Allen Woody, who died in August 2000.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; wrote that &quot;having Ben Harper cameo with Haynes on &#x27;Lay Your Burden Down&#x27; is a guitarist&#x27;s dream, but while the song rolls along, it never takes off—never reaches the pairing&#x27;s potential.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought that the album &quot;recalls the vintage blues-rock of the early Allman Brothers Band and Clapton&#x27;s Cream.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs by Warren Haynes unless otherwise noted.

<text>The Eliica (or the Electric Lithium-Ion Car) is a supercar or an battery electric vehicle prototype or concept car first shown in 2004 and designed by a team at Keio University in Tokyo, led by Professor Hiroshi Shimizu. The car runs on a lithium-ion battery and can accelerate from 0– in four seconds (faster than the Porsche 911 Turbo at the time). In 2004, the Eliica reached a speed of on Italy&#x27;s Nardò High Speed Track. The team&#x27;s goal is to exceed , breaking the record set by today&#x27;s street-legal gasoline-powered vehicles.

Shimizu&#x27;s new project is called &quot;SIM-Drive&quot; (シムドライブ), with wheel hub motors.

== KAZ ==
The Eliica is a refinement of the earlier KAZ (Keio Advanced Zero-emission vehicle), a limousine-sized 8-wheel 8-person electric vehicle prototype of 2003 that also set speed records.

== Design details ==
The Eliica weighs and seats the driver and three passengers. The body was tested in a wind tunnel. The front doors open forward and the rear doors open upward like gull wings. The car&#x27;s platform contains 4 tracks of 80 batteries, which make up one third of the vehicle&#x27;s cost. They currently require about 10 hours of recharging at 100 volts from empty to full charge, and can be easily charged off a residential power grid.

The car has eight wheels to improve traction, and they are smaller than normal passenger vehicles, so it can be lower to the ground for better aerodynamics and stability. Each of the wheels has a electric motor, giving a eight wheel drive which can tackle all kinds of road surfaces. The four front wheels steer. The electric motors mean that the Eliica can deliver a smooth acceleration free from gear shifts of about 0.8 &quot;g&quot;. Each wheel contains a disc brake and employs a regenerative brake system to recover energy.

There are currently (as of 2005) two versions of the Eliica: a &quot;Speed model&quot; and an &quot;Acceleration model&quot;. The Speed model is made to challenge gasoline-based records and has a top speed of with a range of . The Acceleration model is made for the street and has a top speed of with a range of .

The estimated cost of development was in excess of . Once the team receives corporate sponsorship, they plan to produce at least 200 units. As of early 2007, the projected price was (about ).

On December 19, 2005, then-Prime Minister of Japan Junichiro Koizumi tested this vehicle in a 10-minute ride to the Japanese Parliament. In 2006, the car was tested by Shintaro Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo, as well as by Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan.

<text>A widow&#x27;s walk, also known as a widow&#x27;s watch or roofwalk, is a railed rooftop platform often having an inner cupola/turret frequently found on 19th-century North American coastal houses. The name is said to come from the wives of mariners, who would watch for their spouses&#x27; return, often in vain as the ocean took their lives, leaving the women widows. In other coastal communities, the platforms were called captain&#x27;s walks, as they topped the homes of the more successful captains; supposedly, ship owners and captains would use them to search the horizon for ships due in port.

However, there is little or no evidence that widow&#x27;s walks were intended or regularly used to observe shipping. Widow&#x27;s walks are in fact a standard decorative feature of Italianate architecture, which was very popular during the height of the Age of Sail in many North American coastal communities. The widow&#x27;s walk is a variation of the Italianate cupola. The Italianate cupola, its larger instance being an archetypal belvedere, was an important ornate finish to this style, although it was often high maintenance and prone to leaks. 

Beyond their use as viewing platforms, they are frequently built around the chimney of the residence, thus creating access to the structure. This allows the residents of the home to pour sand down burning chimneys in the event of a chimney fire in the hope of preventing the house from burning down.

<doc id="1199468" wikidata="Q115475" url="?curid=1199468" title="Paul Hermann Müller">
<text>Paul Hermann Müller, also known as Pauly Mueller (12 January 1899 – 13 October 1965), was a Swiss chemist who received the 1948 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine for his 1939 discovery of insecticidal qualities and use of DDT in the control of vector diseases such as malaria and yellow fever.

==Early life and education==

Müller was born on 12 January 1899 in Olten, Solothurn, to Gottlieb and Fanny (née Leypoldt or Leypold) Müller. He was the oldest of four children. His father worked for the Swiss Federal Railways and the family first moved to Lenzburg in Aargau and then to Basel.

Müller went to the local primary school (volksschule) and later to the lower and upper &quot;realschule&quot;. In that time, he had a small laboratory where he developed photographic plates and built radio equipment.

In 1916 he left school due to bad grades and started to work as a laboratory assistant at Dreyfus. The next year he became an assistant chemist in the scientific-industrial laboratory of the electrical plant of Lonza A.G. Returning to school in 1918, he obtained his secondary school diploma in 1919 and entered Basel University in the same year.

At Basel University he studied chemistry (with a minor in botany and physics) and started to study inorganic chemistry under Friedrich Fichter. In 1922 he continued his studies in the organic chemistry lab of Hans Rupe. While working for Rupe as assistant, he received his PhD writing a dissertation entitled &quot;Die chemische und elektrochemische Oxidation des as. m-Xylidins und seines Mono- und Di-Methylderivates&quot; (&quot;The Chemical and Electrochemical Oxidation of Asymmetrical m-Xylidene and its Mono- and Di-methyl Derivatives&quot;) in 1925. He graduated summa cum laude.

==Early work at Geigy==

On 25 May 1925 Müller began working as a research chemist for the dye division of J. R. Geigy AG in Basel. His first research topics at Geigy concerned synthetic and plant-derived dyes and natural tanning agents. This work led to the production of the synthetic tanning agents Irgatan G, Irgatan FL and Irgatan FLT.

In 1935, Geigy began research on moth- and plant-protection agents and Müller was specifically interested in plant protection. He said that his love for plants and nature in general, which led him to choose botany as a minor subject at university, brought him to think about plant protection. Specifically, he wanted to start synthesizing chemical plant protection agents himself. In 1937, he patented a technique for synthesizing novel rhodanide- and cyanate-based compounds which showed bactericide and insecticide activity.
He then developed the product Graminone, a seed disinfectant which was safer than the mercury-based disinfectants at the time.

==Synthesis of DDT==
After his success with tanning agents and disinfectants, Müller was assigned to develop an insecticide. &quot;At that time,&quot; according to The World of Anatomy and Physiology, &quot;the only available insecticides were either expensive natural products or synthetics ineffective against insects; the only compounds that were both effective and inexpensive were arsenic compounds, which were just as poisonous to human beings and other mammals.&quot;

During the course of his research, Müller found that insects absorbed chemicals differently than mammals. This led him to believe it likely that there are chemicals toxic exclusively to insects. He sought to &quot;synthesize the ideal contact insecticide—one which would have a quick and powerful toxic effect upon the largest possible number of insect species while causing little or no harm to plants and warm-blooded animals.&quot; He also made it his goal to create an insecticide that was long-lasting and cheap to produce, along with a high degree of chemical stability.

In embracing this goal, Müller was motivated by two events. The first of these was a major food shortage in Switzerland, which underscored the need for a better way to control the infestation of crops by insects. The second was the typhus epidemic in Russia, which was the most extensive and lethal such epidemic in history. He began his search for his insecticide in 1935.

He studied all the data he could find on the subject of insecticides, decided which chemical properties the kind of insecticide he was in search of would exhibit, and set out to find a compound that would suit his purposes. Müller spent four years searching and failed 349 times before, in September 1939, he found the compound he was looking for. He placed a fly in a cage laced with one particular compound, and short while later, the fly died.

The compound he had placed in the cage was &quot;dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane&quot; (DDT), or, more precisely, &quot;1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane&quot;, which a Viennese pharmacologist named Othmar Zeidler had first synthesized in 1874. Zeidler, while publishing a paper about his synthesis, had not investigated the properties of the new compound, and had thus failed to recognize its extraordinary value as an insecticide.

Müller quickly realized that DDT was the chemical he had been searching for. Tests of DDT by the Swiss government and the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed its effectiveness against the Colorado potato beetle. Further tests demonstrated its astonishing effectiveness against a wide range of pests, including the mosquito, louse, flea, and sandfly, which, respectively, spread malaria, typhus, the plague, and various tropical diseases.

==Application of DDT==

After taking out a Swiss patent on DDT in 1940 (a U.K. patent followed in 1942 and patents in the U.S. and Australia in 1943), Geigy began to market two DDT-based products, a 5% dust called Gesarol spray insecticide and a 3% dust called Neocid dust insecticide. The name DDT was first employed by the British Ministry of Supply in 1943, and the product was added to U.S. Army supply lists in May of the same year. It was also in 1943 that the first practical tests of DDT as a residual insecticide against adult vector mosquitoes were carried out. The next year, in Italy, tests were performed in which residual DDT was applied to the interior surfaces of all habitations and outbuildings of a community to test its effect on Anopheles vectors and malaria incidence.

DDT saved the lives of millions during World War II. Between the 1950s and 1970s, DDT helped eradicate malaria entirely from many countries, the U.S. included.

==Later scientific career==
Müller became Geigy&#x27;s Deputy Director of Scientific Research on Substances for Plant Protection in 1946. In 1948 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine, &quot;for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods.&quot; The fact that he was accorded this honour even though he was neither a physician nor a medical researcher reflected the immense impact that DDT had had in the fight against human disease. The Nobel Committee said: &quot;DDT has been used in large quantities in the evacuation of concentration camps, of prisons and deportees. Without any doubt, the material has already preserved the life and health of hundreds of thousands.&quot; In 1951, Müller was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the 1st Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting.

In addition to the 1948 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, Müller received an honorary doctorate from the University of Thessalonica in Greece in recognition of DDT&#x27;s impact on the Mediterranean region. He retired from Geigy in 1961, continuing his research in a home laboratory.

==Personal life==

In high school, Müller was only an average student. His grades suffered because he spent all his free time in his little home laboratory performing elementary experiments. In high school and college, Müller was often mocked by his peers being called, &quot;The Ghost,&quot; due to his thin and pale appearance.

Müller married Friedel Rüegsegger in 1927 and had two sons, Heinrich (b. 1929) and Niklaus (b. 1933), and one daughter, Margaretha (b. 1934). His wife took charge of the household and raised their two sons and daughter so that Müller could concentrate on chemistry.

In his free time, Müller enjoyed the nature in the Swiss Alps and in the Swiss Jura where he owned a small holiday home, allowing him to resume his longtime interest in botany. Furthermore, he owned a small fruit farm that he regularly tended to. Müller often relaxed while gardening, photographing mountain wildflowers, and taking the children on early morning nature walks. Moreover, Müller and his wife often enjoyed playing flute and piano duets from Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;.

Reading on the weekends in the mountains, Müller immersed himself in the science of plant protection and pest control. This fascination resulted in his research on pesticides at Geigy, and sequentially the discovery of DDT&#x27;s pesticidal properties.

Müller was regarded as independent, a lone wolf. His daughter, Margaretha, called him an &quot;Eigenbrötler&quot;: one &quot;who makes his own bread&quot;. He was determined and persistent in all aspects of his life, having learned a great deal from his college mentor Fichter. 
Müller died in the early morning of 13 October 1965 in Basel, after a short illness, surrounded by family.

==Honors==

Müller received many honors in his life, among them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Specifically Greece honored him for the near elimination of malaria in the country as a result of his discovery. In 1963, he was invited to Greece and received with great sympathy and celebrated as national hero.

<text>The Blastolene Special, also known as the &quot;Tank Car&quot;, is a unique, specially built car, designed and built by American master craftsman Randy Grubb. The car is currently owned by American entertainer Jay Leno, who regularly drives it on public streets, and also has the car on display at various car shows and meets (such as Cars and Coffee events for example) in the greater Los Angeles area, and the Californian car culture enthusiast scene. Created from an American military tank engine and a custom-made aluminium body, it originally produced 810 bhp (600 kW) at 2,800 rpm and 1,560 ft lb (2,120 N·m) of torque at 2,400 rpm. The car weighs 9,500 pounds (4,300 kg) which is 1/11th the weight of the original tank from which the engine was used.

==History==
In 2001, the Blastolene Special was built by craftsman Randy Grubb. It is powered by a Continental AV1790-5B, a huge engine that weighs as much as a Volkswagen Beetle, which was previously used in the 51-ton M47 Patton Tank in the 1950s. It also features a Greyhound bus transmission and a retro designed sheet metal body. Jay Leno put it into the extensive collection of cars he owns —84 cars and 73 motorcycles . The car was built at Grubb&#x27;s shop in Grants Pass, Oregon.

After purchasing the car, Jay Leno made numerous enhancements to the roadworthiness of the vehicle, including a new six-speed Allison automatic gearbox, new rear brakes, new electrical system, and chassis work. The engine was later upgraded with fuel injection and twin turbochargers from Gale Banks and his company, Gale Banks Engineering. It is now estimated to produce and of torque.

==Facts==
* Introduced as &quot;The Jay Leno Tank Car&quot; on Gran Turismo 4, it ended up in the game &quot;by accident&quot; when the development team visited Jay&#x27;s garage to record some engine sounds. They noticed the car and put it in the game on behalf of their intrigue. it also Reappears in Gran Turismo 5 as &quot;Tank Car &#x27;03&quot;
* During one of the first freeway test drives an unsuitable oil line ruptured and dumped the entire 17 gallons of oil onto the road
* The car gets 5 miles per gallon (up from the original performance of 2–3 miles per gallon, after the transmission was replaced.)
* The engine red-lines at 2,900 rpm.
* Jay Leno brought the car on his show when interviewing Arnold Schwarzenegger and introduced it as &quot;The Terminator car&quot;.
* Jay Leno had a tuning company, Gale Banks Engineering, add twin turbochargers to the engine, not for higher power but to get better fuel economy.
Blastolene has since made a similar car styled after a 1950s-era Indy Car, called the Blastolene Indy Special.

==Specifications==
* Weight — 4,300 kg (9500 lb)
* Length — 6.40 metres (252 in)
* Transmission — 6-speed Allison automatic
* Quarter Mile — 14.7 seconds @

<doc id="1199483" wikidata="Q9825" url="?curid=1199483" title="Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (9th century)">
<text>Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (27 July 810 – 7 September 859) was an emperor of China&#x27;s Tang dynasty, reigning from 25 April 846 until his death. Personally named Li Yi, later renamed Li Chen (), and known before his reign as the Prince of Guang, he was considered the last capable emperor of Tang China. Succeeding emperors after Xuanzong would either be too young or be dominated by eunuchs or warlords. Emperor Xuanzong was the 13th son of Emperor Xianzong () and an uncle of the previous three emperors, Emperor Jingzong, Emperor Wenzong, and Emperor Wuzong.

To distinguish Emperor Xuanzong from his ancestor Emperor Xuánzong (personal name Li Longji), as their memorial names are rendered identically in Wade–Giles and when pinyin tonal marks are not used, Xuanzong is occasionally referred to as Xuanzong II in western sources; in Chinese, however, their memorial titles (宣宗 for him and 玄宗 for Li Longji) are clearly distinct and this device is not used.

== Background ==
Li Yi was born in 810, at Daming Palace (), as the 13th of 20 known sons of then-reigning Emperor Xianzong. His mother was Emperor Xianzong&#x27;s concubine Consort Zheng, who had previously been a concubine of the warlord Li Qi and who, after imperial forces defeated Li Qi in 807, was taken into Emperor Xianzong&#x27;s palace to be a servant girl to Emperor Xianzong&#x27;s wife Consort Guo, but who at some point bore Li Yi for Emperor Xianzong. After Emperor Xianzong died in 820, Li Yi&#x27;s older brother Li Heng, born of Consort Guo, became emperor (as Emperor Muzong), and in 821, when Emperor Muzong created a number of his sons and brothers to be imperial princes, Li Yi was created the Prince of Guang.

== As imperial prince ==
In Li Yi&#x27;s youth, he was said to be shy and a poor speaker, and (falsely) considered by others to be unintelligent. Later, during the reigns of Emperor Muzong&#x27;s sons Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Wuzong, Li Yi was said to try to hide himself from the political scene, and rarely spoke anything at all. When the emperors visited the imperial princes&#x27; residences, known as the Sixteen Mansions, they would, as a game, try to get Li Yi to speak, and they referred to him as &quot;Uncle Guang.&quot; It was said that Emperor Wuzong, who had an outgoing personality, particularly disrespected Li Yi.

In early 846, Emperor Wuzong became extremely ill and was himself rendered mute. The palace eunuchs gathered and decided on Li Yi as Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s successor, probably because they considered him simple-minded and therefore easier to control. They had an edict issued in Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s name creating Li Yi crown prince, changing his name to the more auspicious Li Chen, and investing him with authority over imperial affairs. It was said that when Li Chen met the officials in his new role as crown prince, they were astonished that the apparent simpleton exhibited punctilious adherence to the complex ritual expressions of grief for Wuzong, and immediate knowledgeable management of the court&#x27;s pending business. Apparently, Li Chen&#x27;s simple-mindedness had been an affectation, to make himself appear harmless during the dangerous intrigues of his predecessors&#x27; reigns. Soon thereafter, Emperor Wuzong died, and Li Chen took the throne (as Emperor Xuanzong).

== Early reign ==
Emperor Xuanzong honored his mother Consort Zheng as empress dowager. Immediately after taking the throne, Emperor Xuanzong acted against the powerful chancellor Li Deyu, who had dominated the court during Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s reign, as he despised Li Deyu for monopolizing power. Emperor Xuanzong removed Li Deyu from his chancellor position and sent him out of the capital Chang&#x27;an to serve as the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), and also removed Li Deyu&#x27;s fellow chancellor Zheng Su. Over the next few years, Emperor Xuanzong purged those officials he considered sympathetic to Li Deyu, and further pursued charges against Li Deyu based on Li Deyu having executed the minor official Wu Xiang () on charges that should not have warranted death (Li Deyu was resentful of Wu Xiang&#x27;s uncle Wu Wuling []). Li Deyu was repeatedly demoted and sent farther and farther away from Chang&#x27;an, eventually dying in exile around the new year 850 in Yai Prefecture (崖州, in modern Haikou, Hainan). These actions were considered to have largely ended the factionalism among imperial officials known as the Niu–Li factional strife, which had plagued the imperial government ever since the reign of Emperor Muzong.

A number of policies that Emperor Wuzong and Li Deyu had pursued, including persecution against Buddhism and alliance with the Yenisei Kirghiz, were reversed. In Li Deyu&#x27;s place, Emperor Xuanzong installed Bai Minzhong as the leading chancellor, and over the next few years, Bai recommended a number of other officials, including fellow chancellor Ma Zhi.

Meanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong also turned his attention to the Tibetan Empire, which had fallen into intense civil war after the death of its king Langdarma in 842. Starting in 848, and over a period of several years, Emperor Xuanzong commissioned border troops to recapture various prefectures lost to the Tibetan Empire since the An Lushan Rebellion, taking the region constituting modern eastern Gansu, southern Ningxia, and western Sichuan. Further, after the ethnic Han Chinese Zhang Yichao seized control of the Hexi Corridor from Tibetan officials and submitted to Emperor Xuanzong in 851, Tang had largely reversed the losses to the Tibetan Empire.

However, he initially had little success with rebellions by the Tanguts. After he came to realize that the Tanguts were repeatedly rebelling because of mistreatment by Tang officials, he modified the policies to install officials who were known for mild temper and honesty in the Tangut regions, and he further put Bai in charge of the operations against the Tanguts, giving him a large staff that included many well-known imperial government officials. With Bai overseeing the operations, the Tanguts largely submitted in 851. Bai, however, was not returned to chancellorship within Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s lifetime, and was effectively replaced by Linghu Tao.

Emperor Xuanzong was said to govern diligently, paying much attention to how his capable ancestor Emperor Taizong ruled and trying to follow Emperor Taizong&#x27;s examples. He also took the time and effort to familiarize himself with imperial officials&#x27; capabilities, as well as the customs of the various prefectures throughout the realm, such that he could properly commission officials based on their abilities and review whether they were governing capably. He also encouraged frugality, and tried to demonstrate it by reducing the expenditures for the wedding of his favorite daughter Princess Wanshou to the imperial official Zheng Hao (). It was said that throughout his reign, the imperial clan members and their relatives all carefully obeyed laws.

In 848, Emperor Muzong&#x27;s mother Grand Empress Dowager Guo—whom Empress Dowager Zheng had previously been a servant for—died. Traditional historians noted that popular perception at the time was that Emperor Xuanzong might have murdered her. (It had said that she was depressed over Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s disrespect toward her, because Empress Dowager Zheng had resented her, and also because he suspected her and Emperor Muzong of having instigated the death of Emperor Xianzong at the hands of the eunuch Chen Hongzhi ().) Initially, he would refuse to allow Grand Empress Dowager Guo to be buried with Emperor Xianzong or to be enshrined in Emperor Xianzong&#x27;s temple, but eventually allowed her to be buried with Emperor Xianzong. (He would still refuse to enshrine her, however, with Emperor Xianzong, during his lifetime.)

== Late reign ==

One of the major themes later in Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reign was the high-level officials&#x27; concerns that he was not creating a Crown Prince, as this refusal to do so left the imperial succession uncertain. The issue was raised repeatedly, including by chancellors Wei Mo, Pei Xiu (Tang dynasty), and Cui Shenyou, but he rebuffed all of them, leading to Pei&#x27;s resignation and Cui&#x27;s removal. (The reason why Emperor Xuanzong repeatedly refused to create a crown prince was said to be his disfavor for his oldest son Li Wen the Prince of Yun and favor for his third son Li Zi the Prince of Kui. He wanted Li Zi to be his heir, but was hesitant to create Li Zi crown prince because Li Zi was not the oldest.)

Emperor Xuanzong was said to be careful in promoting and rewarding officials, such that it was not often that he rewarded officials with the highly honorable red and purple uniforms, and was also said to be fair in his promotions such that he did not unjustly favor those who were close to him. Further, he punished those who were close to him when they deserved to be punished, and did not spare them on account of their closeness to him. In order to make sure that the prefects that he commissioned were suitable for the prefectures, he required that they report to Chang&#x27;an to meet with him before heading to their posts. It was also said that he was stern, even with the chancellors, such that even though Linghu Tao was chancellor for 10 years, he continued to fear the emperor.

Meanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong also considered curbing the eunuchs&#x27; power, but could not think of a good way of doing so. On one occasion, when he conferred with the imperial scholar Wei Ao (), Wei told him that he was already the emperor who had exerted the most power over the eunuchs within recent memory—to which Emperor Xuanzong, appearing stressed, stated, &quot;You are not correct. In reality, I am still fearful of them.&quot; He tried to promote eunuchs that he trusted such that they would wield power, but according to himself, this tactic was not particularly successful, as the eunuchs that he promoted, once they became highly ranked, joined with the less obedient powerful eunuchs as well. At one point, he discussed with Linghu the possibility of massacring the eunuchs, which Linghu opposed because Linghu feared that the innocent as well as the guilty would be harmed; Linghu instead suggested gradually reducing the eunuchs&#x27; numbers. Linghu&#x27;s proposal was leaked to the eunuchs, and the eunuchs were said to continue to despise the imperial officials because of this.

Late in Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reign, he came to favor certain alchemists who had promised him immortality, taking regularly the cinnabar-based pills which they manufactured and prescribed. It was said that as a result of poisoning by these pills, he became paranoid and easily angered, and by 859, as a further side effect of the consumption of these toxic, mercurial elixirs, he had developed a large ulcerous boil on his back, rendering him bedridden and unable to conduct meetings with his chancellors and other officials. He entrusted Li Zi to three high-level eunuchs that he favored—the directors of palace communications (&quot;Shumishi&quot;) Wang Guizhang () and Ma Gongru () and the director of the southern court affairs (宣徽南院使, &quot;Xuanhui Nanyuanshi&quot;) Wang Jufang (). After Emperor Xuanzong died, Wang Guizhang, Ma, and Wang Jufang did not initially announce his death, and were set to send one of the eunuch commanders of the Shence Armies (), Wang Zongshi (), who was not on good terms with them, out of Chang&#x27;an to Huai&#x27;nan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) to serve as the eunuch monitor for Huai&#x27;nan. Wang Zongshi, however, reacted by intruding into the palace; finding that Emperor Xuanzong had already died from Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning, he arrested Wang Guizhang, Ma, and Wang Jufang for falsely issuing edicts, and then put them to death. He welcomed Li Wen to the palace, and then issued an edict in Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s name creating Li Wen crown prince and changing his name to Li Cui. The next day, Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s death was announced, and Li Cui became emperor (as Emperor Yizong).

===Relations with Muslims===
During Sulaiman al-Tajir&#x27;s stay at the city of Guangzhou he noted that the Chinese used fingerprint records to maintain the identities of newly arrived foreigners and charged extortionate rates for imported goods, and that the route to China by sea was dangerous due to piracy and frequent rain. He mentioned that the local Muslim populace of Guangzhou had their own mosque and bazaars. He mentioned that the Muslim community had its own Imam and Judge (appointed by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang). He also observed the manufacturing of porcelain, the granary system of Guangzhou, and how its municipal administration functioned.

== Legacy ==
Because of the prosperity of Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reign, it was said that in subsequent years, including after Tang&#x27;s eventual fall in 907, the people missed him bitterly, referring to him as &quot;Little Taizong.&quot; The lead editor of the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;, the Later Jin chancellor Liu Xu, wrote of Emperor Xuanzong in glowing terms, while lamenting that much of the records from his reign had been lost by the time of Later Jin such that he could not write more. The lead editor of the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, Ouyang Xiu, however, commented that Emperor Xuanzong, while having good judgment, lacked kindness or grace.

During Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s reign, Chinese chemists first experimented with fireworks.

<doc id="1199507" wikidata="Q233444" url="?curid=1199507" title="Scribonia (wife of Octavian)">
<text>Scribonia (c. 70 BC – c. AD 16) was the second wife of Octavian, later the Roman Emperor Augustus, and the mother of his only biological child, Julia the Elder. Through this daughter, she was the mother-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, great-grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger, and great-great-grandmother of the Emperor Nero.

==Biography==

=== Parentage ===
Scribonia&#x27;s parentage is unclear. It is known for certain that the name of her mother was Sentia, whose ancestors had been directors of the mint. Her father is another matter; it is known that her father was a &quot;Lucius Scribonius Libo&quot;. The most commonly cited possibility was the praetor of that name in 80 BC. If this is so then she was the younger sister of a brother of the same name who was consul in 34 BC, whose daughter, another Scribonia, married Sextus Pompey. Another less common hypothesis was that she was a second daughter of the consul of 34 BC, rather than his sister.

=== First two marriages ===
According to Suetonius, Scribonia was married three times; her first two husbands were consuls. The name of the first is unknown, but a number of authorities—including Bartolomeo Borghesi, Hermann Dessau, Edmund Groag and Ronald Syme—have suggested that he was Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus, consul in 56 BC, because of the existence of an inscription that refers to freedmen of Scribonia and her son Cornelius Marcellinus after 39 BC. This indicates she had a son from her first marriage who was living with her after she was divorced from Octavian. Suetonius makes no mention of him, only acknowledging her children from her second and third marriages, leading these authorities to conclude the young Marcellinus had died young.

Since she was married a second time, this led to the need to identify her second husband, by whom she had Cornelia, the wife of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (suffect consul 34 BC), and who would die the year her brother ascended to the consulate. Since it had been assumed Cornelius Marcellinus had died young, another brother had to be found, and various candidates had been proposed, most recently Publius Cornelius Scipio, consul in 16 BC. This would provide the year that the young Cornelia died. However, no consular father could be identified for this Cornelia Scipio, which led Syme to remark that the problem of identifying the husbands of Scribonia &quot;appears insoluble&quot;.

However, as historian John Scheid has pointed out, all of them overlook the fact that Suetonius clearly states there were no children by her first marriage. This would mean Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus was her second husband, not her first. Cornelia&#x27;s brother was not the consul of 16 BC, but the consul of 18 BC, and that was the year Cornelia died. 
=== Octavian ===
In 40 BC, Scribonia was forced to divorce her second husband and marry Octavian, who had recently divorced his wife Claudia.

Octavian&#x27;s motive in marrying Scribonia was to cement a political alliance with Sextus Pompey, husband to Scribonia&#x27;s niece or sister. The marriage was brief and unhappy; he divorced her on the very same day as the birth of their daughter, Julia the Elder, his only natural child. He allegedly wrote that he was &quot;unable to put up with her shrewish disposition.&quot; He remarried to Livia Drusilla soon after. Scribonia herself never remarried and appears to have continued to be known as the wife of Caesar thereafter.

In 6 BC or 5 BC, Augustus arranged a marriage between their granddaughter, Julia the Younger, to Lucius Aemilius Paullus, Cornelia&#x27;s son and Scribonia&#x27;s grandson, demonstrating his desire to maintain connections with his second wife&#x27;s family.

Despite her reputation from some modern historians as being &quot;tiresome&quot; and &quot;morose&quot; based on Octavian&#x27;s reasons for divorce, she appears to have been a figure of some repute and standing. In 16 BC, the same year that her son rose to the consulship, her daughter Cornelia died and became the subject of an elegy by Propertius, in which Scribonia is mentioned.Nor have I wronged you, Scribonia, mother, my sweet origin: what do you wish changed in me, except my fate? My mother&#x27;s tears and the city&#x27;s grief exalt me, and my bones are protected by Caesar&#x27;s moans. He laments that living I was worthy sister to his daughter, and we have seen a god&#x27;s tears fall.Suetonius also notes Scribonia&#x27;s affiliation with Scribonius Aphrodisius, slave and pupil of Lucius Orbilius Pupillus. He was afterwards purchased by Scribonia, possibly to educate her children or even herself, and he was subsequently manumitted by her. Based on this, it is possible that she encouraged him and others as a patroness. Aphrodisius is known to have written a now lost treatise on orthography, in opposition to Verrius Flaccus.

=== Voluntary exile ===
In 2 BC, Julia was exiled to Pandateria for adultery and possible treason. Scribonia accompanied her voluntarily into exile. Around AD 4, Julia and Scribonia were allowed to return to the mainland and moved to Rhegium, where Augustus granted Julia property and a yearly income. Scribonia probably remained with her for the fifteen years Julia lived in exile. Julia died in AD 14, shortly after her father&#x27;s death. Contemporary historians are vague regarding the circumstances of her death; while Dio Cassius indicates Tiberius had her killed, Tacitus writes that after her youngest son, Agrippa Postumus, was murdered she succumbed to despair and her health slowly declined.

Scribonia survived her daughter and appears to have returned to the family mansion in Rome.

=== Last years ===
She was about 85 when she died. Scribonia&#x27;s last known activity was around AD 16; when her great-nephew, Marcus Scribonius Libo Drusus, conspired against Tiberius she encouraged him to face trial and punishment rather than commit suicide, telling him, &quot;What joy is there in doing another man&#x27;s job?&quot; Drusus did not listen and took his life shortly after. Although Seneca disapproves of Scribonia&#x27;s advice, referring to her as &quot;gravis femina; gravis&quot;, meaning &quot;dignified and severe&quot; in an old fashioned Roman manner, modern historians have praised her as an exemplary Roman matron with the composure to sustain her rejected daughter Julia and suicidal nephew Scribonius in their tragic misfortunes.

==Marriages and issue==
* An unknown consular; no children
* Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus, consul 56 BC, died c. 49 BC.
** Publius Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus, consul 18 BC.
**Cornelia (between 48 BC and 41 BC – 18 BC)
* Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (Augustus)
**Julia the Elder (39 BC – AD 14)

Her great-great-grandson, Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, was born during her lifetime.

==Cultural depictions==

*In the novel, &quot;I, Claudius,&quot; Robert Graves incorrectly places Scribonia&#x27;s death shortly before Augustus and Julia&#x27;s, rather than after.
*In Allan Massie&#x27;s novel &quot;Augustus&quot; she is portrayed stereotypically; ugly, gap-toothed and fat. The novel implies Julia&#x27;s behaviour is the result of her mother Scribonia rather than a perceived hypocrisy of her father Augustus.
*Scribonia is a main character in the novel &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Daughter&quot; by Edward Burton. She is a patroness of the arts, and enjoys popularity with the Roman people and Augustus&#x27; respect. Contrary to contemporary and modern historians accounts, she plays an active role in Julia&#x27;s life.
*In Elisabeth Dored&#x27;s novel &quot;I Loved Tiberius,&quot; Augustus&#x27; reign is portrayed as a dictatorship. Scribonia is portrayed as a motherly and steadfast woman forbidden any contact with Julia until her exile.
*She appears in the final novel in the &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra,&quot; by Colleen McCullough. Octavius initially finds her very attractive and agreeable, but difficulties with the alliance and their marriage overall leads to its breakdown. Contrary to contemporary historians, Scribonia is allowed to partake in Julia&#x27;s education.
*Scribonia appears briefly in &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2009), by Michelle Moran. She is at a theater, watching her daughter, Julia, from afar because after the divorce they were not allowed to see each other; she is shunned by affluent society who are afraid of angering Augustus and Livia.
*In &quot;Betray the Night: A Novel about Ovid&quot; by Benita Kane Jaro, Scribonia is portrayed as an elderly woman of great strength and personal distinction and courage, who all her life, in spite of the handicaps imposed on women, has been an important player in the factional and family politics of the Augustan period.
* In the TV series &quot;Domina&quot; (2021), Scribonia was played by Bailey Spalding and Christine Bottomley.

Her first play, &quot;We Happy Few&quot;, was produced in 2004. In 2008 she joined &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; as a contributing editor and writer of fiction.

==Early life==
Imogen Stubbs was born in Rothbury, Northumberland, lived briefly in Portsmouth, Hampshire, where her father was a naval officer, and then moved with her parents to London, where they lived on a vintage river barge on the Thames. She was educated at Cavendish Primary School, then at two independent schools: St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School and Westminster School, and then Exeter College, Oxford, gaining a First Class degree.

Her acting career started at Oxford, where she played Irina in a student production of &quot;Three Sisters&quot; at the Oxford Playhouse. She also appeared in a student review called &quot;Dinosaur Can-can&quot; at the same theatre. After graduating, she enrolled at RADA, and while there had her first professional work, playing Sally Bowles in &quot;Cabaret&quot; at the Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich. In 1982
she also appeared in her first film, &quot;Privileged&quot;.

Stubbs graduated from RADA in the same class as Jane Horrocks and Iain Glen, and later became an Associate Member of RADA.

==Career==
In the 1980s Stubbs achieved success on stage with the Royal Shakespeare Company, including playing Desdemona in &quot;Othello&quot;, directed by Trevor Nunn. Other stage work includes &quot;Saint Joan&quot; at the Strand Theatre and &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; at the Haymarket, and in 1997 she played in a London production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

In 1988, Stubbs was a notable Ursula Brangwen in a BBC serialization of &quot;The Rainbow&quot;, and in 1993 and 1994 had the title role in &quot;Anna Lee&quot;. She played Lucy Steele in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995).

In July 2004, Stubbs&#x27;s play &quot;We Happy Few&quot;, directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Juliet Stevenson and Marcia Warren, opened at the Gielgud Theatre, London, after a try-out in Malvern. In September 2008 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; announced that she had joined the magazine as a contributing editor and writer of adventure stories.

==Personal life==
In 1994, Stubbs married Trevor Nunn. The couple have two children: a son and a daughter, Ellie Nunn, who is also an actress. In April 2011, Stubbs announced that she and her husband were separating. Her partner is Jonathan Guy Lewis.

<text>An anomaly-based intrusion detection system, is an intrusion detection system for detecting both network and computer intrusions and misuse by monitoring system activity and classifying it as either &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;anomalous&quot;. The classification is based on heuristics or rules, rather than patterns or signatures, and attempts to detect any type of misuse that falls out of normal system operation. This is as opposed to signature-based systems, which can only detect attacks for which a signature has previously been created.

In order to positively identify attack traffic, the system must be taught to recognize normal system activity. The two phases of a majority of anomaly detection systems consist of the training phase (where a profile of normal behaviors is built) and testing phase (where current traffic is compared with the profile created in the training phase). Anomalies are detected in several ways, most often with artificial intelligence type techniques. Systems using artificial neural networks have been used to great effect. Another method is to define what normal usage of the system comprises using a strict mathematical model, and flag any deviation from this as an attack. This is known as strict anomaly detection. Other techniques used to detect anomalies include data mining methods, grammar based methods, and Artificial Immune System.

Network-based anomalous intrusion detection systems often provide a second line of defense to detect anomalous traffic at the physical and network layers after it has passed through a firewall or other security appliance on the border of a network. Host-based anomalous intrusion detection systems are one of the last layers of defense and reside on computer end points. They allow for fine-tuned, granular protection of end points at the application level.

Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection at both the network and host levels have a few shortcomings; namely a high false-positive rate and the ability to be fooled by a correctly delivered attack. Attempts have been made to address these issues through techniques used by PAYL and MCPAD.

<text>Yuegezhuang () is a part of the city of Beijing to the southwest.

Yuegezhuang is a transportational node; the 4th Ring Road and the Jingshi Expressway interconnect at Yuegezhuang.

Before the western 4th Ring Road was opened to traffic, Yuegezhuang Bridge was an elevated roundabout bridge, much like the bridges seen on the eastern stretch of the 2nd Ring Road. With the 4th Ring Road&#x27;s opening, however, multi-level flyovers were added to the original structure.

Between Yuegezhuang and Wanping (further west) lies an industrialised area known as Xidaokou.

<text>AP-7 is a selective NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that competitively inhibits the glutamate binding site and thus activation of NMDAR. It has anticonvulsant effects.

AP-7 functions specifically as a NMDA recognition site blocker, in contrast with 7-chlorokynurenate, which acts as a glycine site modulation blocker.

== Animal studies ==
AP-7 injected directly into the dorsal periaqueductal grey (DPAG) of rats produced an anxiolytic effect, whereas direct injection outside of the DPAG did not elicit anxiolytic effects, suggesting that the anxiolytic effect of NMDA antagonists in rats may depend on their action in the DPAG.

The DPAG of the brain is thought to deal with fear-like defensive behavior via NMDA and glycine B receptors. These excitatory glutamate receptors work with the inhibitory GABA receptors to achieve equilibrium in the DPAG of the brain.

AP-7 has been known to cause muscle rigidity and catalepsy in rats following bilateral microinjections (0.02-0.5 nmol) into the globus pallidus and ventral-posterior portions of the caudate-putamen.

The optically pure D-(−)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid [D-AP7], has also been examined. In groups of hypoxia-treated rats, D-AP7 enhanced motility, exhibited anxiogenic-like effect and impaired consolidation in passive avoidance. Both AP-7 and D-AP7 function as potent, specific antagonists of the NMDA receptor.

<doc id="1199531" wikidata="Q5429907" url="?curid=1199531" title="Fair Play for Cuba Committee">
<text>The Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) was an activist group set up in New York City by Robert Taber in April 1960. It was active in both the US and Canada.

==History==
The group was set up as a result of a reception in the Cuban Consulate General in New York City on 1 April 1960 for &quot;friends of Cuba&quot;. The Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party was involved in the organisation.

The FPCC&#x27;s purpose was to provide grassroots support for the Cuban Revolution against attacks by the United States government, once Fidel Castro began openly stating his commitment to Marxism and began the expropriation and nationalization of Cuban assets belonging to U.S. corporations. The FPCC opposed the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, the imposition of the United States embargo against Cuba, and was sympathetic to the Cuban view during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Its members were placed under surveillance by the FBI.

The group organised trips to Cuba and at one point had dozens of chapters across the USA. The committee was open to members of all races, and on the first anniversary of the Cuban Revolution a group of black civil rights activists, composed of Harold Cruse, Amiri Baraka, Julian Mayfield and John Henrik Clarke, travelled to Havana in a trip organised by the FPCC.

Subsidiary Fair Play for Cuba groups were set up throughout the United States and Canada.

In Canada the organisation had an office in Toronto, which obtained and distributed pro-Castro literature coming from Cuba itself. It also produced its own literature based upon testimonies from those who had travelled to Cuba and wanted to report their experiences on the island. The first Canadian chapter was founded by Vernel and Anne Olson, they held their first meeting in February 1961 at the First Unitarian Church in Toronto.

===Lee Harvey Oswald===
On May 26, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald wrote to the New York City headquarters of FPCC, proposing to rent &quot;a small office at my own expense for the purpose of forming a FPCC branch here in New Orleans&quot;. Three days later, the FPCC responded to Oswald&#x27;s letter advising against opening a New Orleans office &quot;at least not ... at the very beginning&quot;. In a follow-up letter, Oswald replied, &quot;Against your advice, I have decided to take an office from the very beginning.&quot; On May 29, Oswald ordered the following items from a local printer: 500 application forms, 300 membership cards, and 1,000 leaflets with the heading, &quot;Hands Off Cuba&quot;.

According to anti-Castro militant Carlos Bringuier, Oswald visited him on August 5 and 6 at a store he owned in New Orleans. Bringuier was the New Orleans delegate for the anti-Castro organization Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE). Bringuier would later tell the Warren Commission that he believed Oswald&#x27;s visits were an attempt by Oswald to infiltrate his group. On August 9, Oswald turned up in downtown New Orleans handing out Fair Play for Cuba leaflets. Bringuier confronted Oswald, claiming he was tipped off about Oswald&#x27;s leafleting by a friend. A scuffle ensued and Oswald, Bringuier, and two of Bringuier&#x27;s friends were arrested for disturbing the peace. Prior to leaving the police station, Oswald requested to speak with an FBI agent. Oswald told the agent that he was a member of the New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee which he claimed had 35 members and was led by A. J. Hidell. In fact, Oswald was the branch&#x27;s only member and it had never been chartered by the national organization.

===Surveillance and infiltration===
In 1961 the committee was the target of the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO program. In June 1961 FBI director J. Edgar Hoover approved &quot;establishing counterintelligence programs in Cuban field in an attempt to disillusion current members of such pro-Castro groups as July 26 Movement and Fair Play for Cuba Committee&quot;. Among these suggestions was a plot to get leaders arrested by luring them with prostitutes. In December 1961 the FBI mailed anonymous leaflets to select members of the organisation &quot;for [the] purpose of disrupting FPCC and causing split between FPCC and its Socialist Workers Party (SWP) supporters&quot;, a tactic they noted was &quot;very effective&quot;. Due to the help of an informant the FBI also possessed photographs of the FPCC financial records and the mailing list of the organisation.

The FBI had informers in the FPCC, such as Victor Thomas Vicente in the New York chapter, and its members and activities underwent surveillance by the Detroit Police Department. The committee was the subject of investigation from both the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security and the House Un-American Activities Committee. CIA interest in the FPCC was also documented by the Church Committee in 1975. It uncovered a memo dated to 16 September 1963 which stated that the CIA is &quot;giving some thought to planting deceptive information which might embarrass the Committee in areas where it does have some support&quot;.

By December 1963, the Fair Play for Cuba Committee was defunct, largely in part to the fallout from the assassination of John F. Kennedy by FPCC member, Lee Harvey Oswald. FBI investigations concluded in 1964.

<doc id="1199532" wikidata="Q2596131" url="?curid=1199532" title="Hawkins-class cruiser">
<text>The &quot;Hawkins&quot; class consisted of five heavy cruisers built for the Royal Navy during the First World War, although none of them saw service during the war. The first ship to be completed, , was renamed from HMS &quot;Cavendish&quot; and converted into an aircraft carrier while under construction. All ships were named after Elizabethan sea captains. The three ships remaining as cruisers in 1939 served in the Second World War, with &quot;Effingham&quot; being an early war loss through wreck; &quot;Raleigh&quot; had been lost in a similar shipwreck on uncharted rocks in 1922 (and &quot;Vindictive&quot; was nearly lost to grounding in 1919). &quot;Vindictive&quot;, though no longer a cruiser, also served throughout the War. This class formed the basis for the definition of the maximum cruiser type under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.

==Design==

Although the &quot;Hawkins&quot; class are sometimes named as the &quot;Improved &quot;Birminghams&quot;&quot;, referring to the &quot;Birmingham&quot; sub-class of the Town-class light cruisers, their design was based on a proposal by the Director of Naval Construction, Eustace Tennyson d&#x27;Eyncourt, in 1912–1913. Reacting to rumors of large German cruisers armed with guns for overseas service and the need to replace the elderly armoured cruisers deployed abroad, d&#x27;Eyncourt proposed an oil-fuelled and lightly armoured ship of capable of and armed with guns in turrets. Referring the design as a &quot;Light Cruiser for Atlantic Service&quot;, he optimized the design for good seakeeping performance for hunting down commerce raiders by giving it a deep draught and high freeboard.

Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, objected to the size and cost of the ship and asked for a smaller and faster design armed with a mix of and 7.5-inch guns, capable of using oil and a version of the new design using a mix of coal and oil as in the &quot;Birmingham&quot;s in August 1913. The oil-fuelled design was estimated to cost £550,000, compared to the original&#x27;s £700,000, while the mixed-fuel ship was priced at £590,000. Nothing further was done with the designs as the naval construction budget was already badly stretched.

In the early months of the First World War, German commerce-raiding warships and armed merchant cruisers seriously disrupted British seaborne trade as the need to form convoys or re-route ships to avoid areas that the raiders in which were operating seriously delayed sailings or lengthened voyages. Furthermore, the need to escort the convoys and to search for the raiders required large numbers of warships that were needed elsewhere, far out of proportion to numbers of raiders. On 12 October 1914 d&#x27;Eyncourt reiterated the arguments behind his &quot;Atlantic Cruiser&quot; proposal in a memo to the Board of Admiralty, adding that a fast mixed-fuel design with a large steaming radius would be very helpful for operations in remote areas where oil might not be available.

By early 1915 the threat had been neutralized or sunk, but the Royal Navy believed that further commerce-raiding operations were likely. On 9 June the board met to consider specifications for a large light cruiser capable of hunting down commerce raiders anywhere in the world. D&#x27;Eyncourt was subsequently requested to submit designs for a ship capable of with at least one-fifth power from coal-fired boilers and an armament of at least ten 6-inch guns. He submitted six sketch designs armed with various mixes of 6-, 7.5- and guns using and hulls. Based on several encounters where the raiders had attempted to flee as soon as they had spotted the cruisers, the board believed that the ship&#x27;s armament needed to be able to reach out to the visible horizon and be powerful enough to cripple the raider with a single hit. It therefore rejected the 6-inch gun as too short-ranged and lacking in power and the 9.2-inch gun as too few could be mounted on the hull; settling on the 7.5-inch gun in a new mount capable of 30° of elevation to maximise its range and carried on the larger of the two hulls proposed.

==Description==

The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of at deep load. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The shape of the hull was based on that of the large light cruiser with anti-torpedo bulges covering the engine and boiler rooms. Amidships, the hull had 10° of tumblehome, although the forward portion of the forecastle deck flared outwards to improve seakeeping. The ships had a metacentric height of at deep load. D&#x27;Eyncourt claimed that they were so subdivided that they could survive the flooding of two adjacent compartments. Their crew numbered 37 officers and 672 ratings.

The &quot;Hawkins&quot; class were equipped with four geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by a dozen Yarrow boilers at a pressure of , distributed between three boiler rooms. The fore and aft groups adopted a modern oil-fired design, but the four boilers in the middle compartment were coal-fired, so that cruising fuel could be easily obtained in foreign ports where oil was not available. The drawback being that they produced much less power, only generating one-sixth of the ships&#x27; total output. The steam from the boilers was ducted into two funnels, the uptakes from the coal-fired central group being split and trunked in with those from the oil-fired ones fore and aft. The turbines were rated at to give the ships a design speed of 30 knots. A fuel supply of of fuel oil and of coal was supposed to give a steaming range of at .

In the event, only &quot;Hawkins&quot; and &quot;Vindictive&quot; were completed with this engine installation. During her sea trials in 1919, &quot;Hawkins&quot; reached a speed of from about at deep load, a slightly disappointing figure as she had been designed for at this displacement.

In November 1917 the Admiralty decided to replace the coal-fired boilers in the three least-advanced ships with four oil-fired ones, but only &quot;Raleigh&quot; actually received this modification, which increased her power to for a theoretical . The following year, &quot;Raleigh&quot; reached her designed speed during her trials. &quot;Effingham&quot; and &quot;Frobisher&quot; exchanged their coal-fired boilers for a single pair of oil-fired boilers which gave them for a design speed of . These three ships stowed of oil which was designed to give them the same range of at .

The ships&#x27; machinery arrangements would be further modified in later refits and reconstructions.

===Armament===
The main armament of the &quot;Hawkins&quot;-class ships consisted of seven 45-calibre Mk VI guns in single mounts protected by gun shields. The guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of to their maximum range of . The ships stowed 150 rounds per gun. The mounts were initially hand-worked, but they were refitted with power-operated elevation and traverse motors after the war. Powered-loading gear was never fitted and the guns could only be hand-loaded up to 10° elevation. The requirements for long lines of ammunition-handlers, physically passing rounds and cartridges along the deck from the shell-hoist to each gun (and in the case of the superfiring forward gun, physically passing them up from one deck to the next) were particularly inconvenient, and in terms of manpower, were described as &quot;absurdly out of proportion&quot; to the ship&#x27;s cruiser role and firepower.

The ships were arranged with five guns on the centreline, four of which were in superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, the fifth gun was further aft on the quarterdeck, and the last two as wing guns abreast the aft funnel. To make room for her flight decks, HMS &quot;Vindictive&quot; was completed with just four guns, one forward, two in the wing positions, and one right aft. Further revisions to the number and layout of the main guns would be made subsequently.

, and &quot;Hawkins&quot; had their guns controlled by a mechanical Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Table. It used data provided by the coincidence rangefinder in the pedestal-type gunnery director positioned under the spotting top at the head of the tripod mast. The ships were also fitted with one and a rangefinder. &quot;Effingham&quot; and &quot;Frobisher&quot; were fitted with a Mark III Dreyer Fire-control Table and three 12-foot rangefinders.

The secondary armament of the class was intended to consist of ten 20 cwt Mk I guns. Six of these were in low-angle mounts to defend against torpedo boat attack, two in casemates between the forward 7.5-inch guns, another pair on platforms abreast the conning tower and two on a platform between the funnels. The last four served as anti-aircraft (AA) guns and were positioned further aft around the base of the mainmast. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . Each gun was provided with 300 rounds.

In practice, the secondary armament of each ship varied. At most, only &quot;Hawkins&quot; and &quot;Raleigh&quot; completed with the intended guns, and if so, they were promptly modified. No low-angle guns were fitted in &quot;Effingham&quot; or &quot;Frobisher&quot; and their high-angle guns were replaced by three Mk V guns on high-angle HA Mark III mountings. A pair of these were positioned at the base of the mainmast and the third gun was on the quarterdeck. At an elevation of +30°, their shells had a range of at a muzzle velocity of . The rest of their anti-aircraft suite consisted of a pair of 2-pounder () AA guns that were added during construction. The &quot;Hawkins&quot;-class ships were designed with a submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tube on each broadside, but two above-water torpedo tubes were added below the base of the mainmast during construction on each broadside.

===Armour===
The &quot;Hawkins&quot; class were protected by a full-length waterline armoured belt of high-tensile steel (HTS) that covered most of the ships&#x27; sides. It was thickest over the boiler and engine rooms, ranging from thick. Their magazines were protected by an additional of HTS. There was a 1-inch aft transverse bulkhead of mild steel and the conning tower was protected by 3-inch HTS plates. The ships&#x27; deck protection consisted of 1- to 1.5-inch HTS.

==&quot;Cavendish&quot; as an aircraft carrier==

In January 1917, the Admiralty reviewed the navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier requirements and decided to order two ships fitted with a flying-off deck as well as a landing deck aft. The initial order had to be cancelled in April 1917 for lack of building facilities, so the Admiralty decided to convert &quot;Cavendish&quot;, already under construction, in June 1917. She was renamed &quot;Vindictive&quot; to perpetuate the name of the cruiser sunk at the Second Ostend Raid and her construction was rushed to bring her into service before her cruiser sisters.

The forward superfiring 7.5-inch gun, two 3-inch guns and the conning tower were removed and the forward superstructure was remodelled into a hangar with a capacity for six reconnaissance aircraft. The hangar roof, with a small extension, formed the flying-off deck. The aircraft were hoisted up through a hatch at the aft end of the flying-off deck by two derricks. The landing deck required the removal of the aft superfiring pair of 7.5-inch guns and moving the four 3-inch AA guns to an elevated platform between the funnels, in lieu of the 3-inch guns intended for that position. A port side gangway wide connected the landing and flying-off decks to allow aircraft with their wings folded to be wheeled from one to the other. A crash barrier was hung from &quot;the gallows&quot; at the forward end of the landing on deck. To increase her stability after the addition of so much topweight, the upper portion of her anti-torpedo bulge was enlarged. She completed her sea trials on 21 September 1918 and reached a speed of from .

==Modifications==
The earliest modification related to the secondary armament. The low-angle guns were all gone by 1921, leaving &quot;Hawkins&quot; with only her four 12-pounder anti-aircraft (A/A) guns, while &quot;Raleigh&quot; seems to have obtained two QF 4-inch Mark V guns in their stead.

The first major refit to the class came in 1923, when &quot;Vindictive&quot; was converted back into a cruiser configuration - but the hangar beneath her bridge was retained, and in place of &#x27;B&#x27; gun, she had a prototype aircraft catapult, enabling her to carry six Fairey IIID floatplanes on active service. Her revised gun armament thus consisted of six rather than seven 7.5-inch guns (a single &#x27;A&#x27; gun forward, two on the wing mountings, and &#x27;X&#x27;, &#x27;Y&#x27; and &#x27;Z&#x27; aft - though only the &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; mountings were actually additions to her armament, the rest having been carried by her as a carrier), and a revised anti-aircraft configuration of three 4-inch guns like &quot;Frobisher&quot; and &quot;Effingham&quot;.

In 1925, it was suggested that &quot;Frobisher&quot; and &quot;Effingham&quot; could be rearmed to carry six guns in the same modern twin-turrets used on the new County-class cruisers then building, giving ships of comparable firepower for a fraction of the cost, and a similar reconstruction of the partially coal-fired &quot;Hawkins&quot; could also be used to upgrade her boilers (&quot;Vindictive&quot; was excluded as her aircraft catapult was considered a valuable asset); but the proposal was rejected - the existing turret design produced for the new cruisers could not be used in the aft position on the older ships, their protection against long-range gunfire was weak, there were concerns with staying within the 10,000-ton weight limit, and the Admiralty reported that it would be difficult and costly to find substitutes to take over their duties while they were being rebuilt.

Instead, &quot;Hawkins&quot; underwent a more limited refit in 1929, in which her coal-fired boilers were simply removed and her remaining eight boilers were uprated to , though this would have had the effect of reducing her top speed. She also had her anomalous secondary armament of four 12-pounder guns replaced by an equal number of the same Mark V guns used by her sisters.

In 1930, another modernisation plan was proposed, which would re-arm the class with eight guns in twin turrets, similar to the new &quot;Leander&quot;-class light cruiser. This would have been easier to achieve than the earlier proposal for twin 8-inch turrets, but again, nothing was done. The British government was placing a strong emphasis on establishing agreed limits on heavy cruiser numbers in the word&#x27;s major navies, and an offer to remove the &quot;Hawkins&quot; class from service was instrumental in obtaining the London Naval Treaty, which implicitly accepted that they would all be removed from service by 1936. Simply converting them into modern light cruisers would hardly have honoured the spirit of the agreement.

The &quot;Hawkins&quot; class were not scrapped, however. Instead, they were retained by the expedient of reclassifying them as training ships. As a first step, &quot;Frobisher&quot; was reclassified in 1932, and one of her aft guns and two of her 4-inch guns were removed; in 1935, the upper aft gun was replaced by an aircraft catapult, and in 1936, to conform more closely with the agreement, her armament was reduced to a single 4.7-inch (120 mm) gun. In 1937, &quot;Vindictive&quot; was specially demilitarised with a more substantial conversion; not only was her armament reduced to two 4.7-inch guns forward and a pom-pom aft, but her inboard propellers and the associated turbines were removed, along with the associated boilers and aft funnel, reducing her speed to 24 knots. A reworked superstructure provided cadet accommodation, while the empty aft boiler room became a laundry, and her fuel reserve dropped to . &quot;Hawkins&quot; was simply disarmed and laid up.

However, in 1937 &quot;Effingham&quot; began substantial reconstruction, which saw her converted into a light cruiser, albeit of a more old-fashioned configuration with nine BL 6-inch Mark XII guns on single mountings CP Mark XIV. This was achieved by rebuilding the superstructure to increase the number of superfiring positions fore and aft from two to three, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; and &#x27;W&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; respectively, while retaining the guns on either wing, and the one right astern on the quarterdeck in position &#x27;Z&#x27;. Secondary armament became eight QF 4-inch Mark XVI gun in four twin-gun HA/LA Mark XIX in mounting, eight QF 2-pounder Mark VIII guns in two quadruple mounts and twelve Vickers in three quadruple mounts. The submerged torpedo tubes and the after boiler rooms were removed, but they were replaced with extra fuel storage, and after modifications to her remaining machinery, her total output was only slightly reduced to . Externally, the remaining uptakes were trunked into a single large funnel. She had a new bridge, her original tripod mast and spotting top were replaced by a straight pole mast, and carried a crane amidships designed for a reconnaissance aircraft, although it is not clear if the associated catapult was ever been fitted, and probably no aircraft was ever carried.

In 1939, &quot;Vindictive&quot; entered dock for what was supposed to be a reconstruction into a similar configuration, but work proceeded slowly, and given the extensive modifications to her machinery, it was decided to simplify her reconstruction. By October 1939, she was considered for a modest rearmament with four 6-inch guns in &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; positions forward and &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; aft, with an option to add additional guns on the wing mountings later; an anti-aircraft armament of three 4-inch guns with destroyer-style fire-control and four single 2pdr guns was proposed, and although the extra topweight was expected to reduce her top speed to 23 knots, it was hoped that the laundry would be converted into fuel storage, which would increase her range. In the event, it was decided that she could be more usefully (and very quickly) refitted as a repair ship, eventually armed with six guns, two quadruple pom-poms, and a number of Oerlikon autocannons.

It had also been planned to rebuild &quot;Hawkins&quot; and &quot;Frobisher&quot; on similar lines to &quot;Effingham&quot;, but other priorities prevented this. They were simply re-armed for war with their original guns. &quot;Hawkins&quot; recommissioned in 1940 with her original main armament restored, and a revised secondary armament of four 4-inch AA guns, two quadruple 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mountings and eight 20mm Oerlikons on single mounts. In contrast, &quot;Frobisher&quot; never regained her wing guns, and this allowed the gun deck carrying her anti-aircraft guns to be extended out to the ship&#x27;s sides, and their number to be increased to five (two on each side amidships and the one aft on her quarterdeck); she was at one point supposed to get two quadruple pom-poms, two single 2-pounders, and three Oerlikon guns, but slow progress on her refit meant that these were revised to four quadruple pom-poms and seven Oerlikons before she emerged in 1942. The underwater torpedo tubes were removed, but she now had a quadruple mounting in the open-deck position.

&quot;Frobisher&quot; also lost the catapult-aircraft facilities she had been given in 1935. Both ships received an outfit of centimetric Radar Type 273 target indication on the bridge, Type 286 air warning at the mastheads, Type 275 on the HACS gun director for ranging and bearing and, in &quot;Frobisher&quot; only, a pair of Type 282 sets on the pom-pom directors on the bridge. Further wartime additions modified the anti-aircraft armament, generally strengthening the pom-pom arrangements and increasing the number of 20 mm guns.

A final refit was given to &quot;Frobisher&quot; in 1944–1945, when she was converted back into a training ship, with three 7.5-inch guns in &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;Y&#x27; and &#x27;Z&#x27; positions and a single 4-inch AA gun in the superfiring &#x27;B&#x27; position forward, plus a reduced number of Oerlikons and some machine guns, and her quadruple torpedo tubes.

== Ships ==
==Service==

* &quot;Raleigh&quot; had the shortest career of any ship of the class, spending just one year in commission before being wrecked and subsequently broken up.
* &quot;Effingham&quot; was an early war loss, during the Norwegian campaign; grounding on an uncharted shoal, she had to be destroyed by friendly forces.
* &quot;Hawkins&quot; served in World War II as a convoy escort in the Indian Ocean, and provided gunfire support during the Normandy landings.
* &quot;Frobisher&quot; served in World War II as a convoy escort and a depot ship for the Normandy landings. After torpedo damage in an E-boat attack, the ship was refitted in 1944-1945 for a training role, with a corresponding reduction in armament.
* &quot;Vindictive&quot; served in two World Wars, in a wide variety of roles, finally being scrapped in 1946.

<text>Charles Laban Abernethy (March 18, 1872 – February 23, 1955) was a Democratic U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1922 and 1935.

Born in Rutherford College, North Carolina, Abernethy attended local public schools in Rutherford College before moving to Beaufort, North Carolina in 1893. There, he founded the &quot;Beaufort Herald&quot; newspaper. Abernethy studied law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was admitted to the bar in 1895. Practicing law in Beaufort, he was solicitor of the third (later the fifth) judicial circuit for twelve years, and a member of the executive committee of the North Carolina Democratic Party between 1898 and 1900.

Abernethy moved to New Bern, North Carolina in 1913, and continued to practice law there. In 1922, he was chosen, in a special election, to fill the seat vacated by the death of Rep. Samuel M. Brinson; he was re-elected to five more terms, serving between November 7, 1922 and January 3, 1935, before being defeated for re-election in 1934. After leaving Congress, he resumed his law practice, retiring in 1938.

Abernethy died in 1955 in New Bern and is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery.

He was a cousin to North Carolina&#x27;s first Poet Laureate Arthur Talmage Abernethy.

<text>Evan Shelby Alexander (October 28, 1809) was a slave owner, lawyer, legislator from the Salisbury District of North Carolina, and United States Democratic-Republican Party Congressman from North Carolina between 1806 and 1809.

==Life story==
Born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina to his father, a Revolutionary War officer and slave owner around 1767, Alexander attended the common schools and then Princeton College, graduating in 1787, and was a member of the Whig society (later the Whig-Clio), and delivered a commencement address in Greek. He studied law and was admitted to the bar, practicing in Salisbury.

Alexander was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons from the Salisbury District, serving from 1796 to 1803, and was a trustee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1799 to 1809.

Following the resignation of Rep. Nathaniel Alexander, his cousin, Evan Shelby Alexander was chosen in a special election to fill the vacancy; he was elected to a term in regular Congressional elections in 1806, serving in the 9th and 10th Congresses and serving from February 24, 1806 to March 3, 1809. He died shortly after leaving Congress, on October 28, 1809.

Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, between the Edmonton Eskimos and the Montreal Alouettes, to decide the winner of the 2005 season of the Canadian Football League. The Eskimos prevailed over the Alouettes in a 38–35 overtime victory. It was the first time in 44 years that a Grey Cup went into overtime (it would happen again in 2016 and 2021). It was also the first Grey Cup to be presented in high-definition television.

==Festivities==
The Grey Cup Parade was held the day before the game. Pamela Anderson served as Grand Marshal of the parade.

The Black Eyed Peas, who also performed during halftime of the Grey Cup game, appeared on scene and performed, marking the culmination of a large celebration to welcome the Grey Cup to British Columbia.

The game opened with a ceremonial coin toss by Prime Minister Paul Martin to determine who would start the game with possession of the football. As Martin came out to toss the coin, he was greeted with a rousing chorus of boos from the crowd, to which the prime minister responded with a smile and a wave to the crowd. Martin, a Liberal, was at the time embroiled in the sponsorship scandal.

The game got off to a slow start, with Edmonton holding a 10–1 lead going into half-time, thanks to a Sean Fleming field goal and a Ricky Ray touchdown pass to Ed Hervey. A &quot;rouge&quot; by Montreal kicker Damon Duval accounted for the Alouettes&#x27; point.

The second half was a back-and-forth affair. The Alouettes came on strong in the third quarter, scoring on a pair of goal-line plunges by backup running back Éric Lapointe, with the Eskimos notching a Fleming field goal in reply. After an Edmonton turnover, the Alouettes scored a Duval field goal giving them an 18–13 lead. On the ensuing kickoff Edmonton returner Tony Tompkins scored a 96-yard touchdown, the longest kickoff return in Grey Cup history. The third quarter ended with the Eskimos leading 20–18.

Montreal quarterback Anthony Calvillo scored on a one-yard bootleg that caught Eskimos linebacker Marcus Winn out of position. With the Alouettes leading 25–20, the Eskimos had one last chance to take the lead. Facing third-and-four in Montreal territory, Ray hit Derrell Mitchell on a deep out pattern to get a first down, and a trio of penalties left the Eskimos first-and-goal at the Alouettes&#x27; one-yard line. Ricky Ray punched it in for his second touchdown of the night. Then he hooked up with Jason Tucker to score a two-point conversion creating a 28–25 Edmonton lead with only a minute left.

The Alouettes struck back with a Duval field goal as time expired, tying the game at 28–28.

Montreal went first in the overtime shootout, and Calvillo passed to Dave Stala in the right corner of the endzone to give Montreal a 35–28 lead. Edmonton replied with Ray hitting Jason Tucker on an 11-yard score.

In the second overtime, the Eskimos were unable to score a touchdown on second and four. The kicker Fleming converted a field goal to bring the score to 38–35, with Montreal&#x27;s turn in hand.

The second overtime featured an unusual if not illegal play. On first down, Calvillo faced a heavy Edmonton rush and tried to throw the ball away. Edmonton defensive end Joe Montford knocked the ball down at the line, but Calvillo was able to catch it. Calvillo then illegally threw the ball again into the endzone to wide receiver Kerry Watkins who, without an Eskimo within five yards, dropped the game winning (albeit illegal) pass. The play resulted in a 10-yard penalty against the Alouettes for an illegal forward pass, putting them on the 45-yard line. On 1st and 20, Calvillo was sacked by Charles Alston for a 13-yard loss, which pushed the ball out of Duval&#x27;s field goal range. An incomplete pass on second down and a long injury break set the stage for third and 33. An Eskimos blitz forced Calvillo to scramble ten yards down the left sideline. Anticipating a tackle, Calvillo kicked the ball forward in order to keep Montreal&#x27;s Grey Cup hopes alive, but the ball was recovered by Eskimo linebacker A. J. Gass.

==Most Valuable Players &amp; trivia==
In the presentation ceremony after the game, the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player award was given to Edmonton quarterback Ricky Ray, who completed 35 of 45 passes for 359 yards and two touchdowns. The Most Valuable Canadian was Edmonton backup fullback Maven Maurer (substituting for the injured Mathieu Bertrand), who picked up 41 receiving yards on four catches.

Montreal and Edmonton have met in 11 Grey Cup clashes. The Alouettes prevailed in 1974, the Ice Bowl of 1977, and 2002. The Eskimos have won in 1954, 1955, 1956, 1975, 1978, 1979, 2003 and 2005.

===Division Semi-finals===
&quot;November 13&quot;

====East Semi-Final====

MONTREAL – The perennial powerhouse Alouettes boasted four 1,000-yard receivers for the second consecutive season (and second time in CFL history). But they finished a mere second in the East Division behind the defending champion Toronto Argonauts. As a result, they were forced to defend the hard surface at Olympic Stadium against the fourth-place team in the West Division, the Saskatchewan Roughriders, who took the third spot in the East Division after finishing higher than the Ottawa Renegades.

A remarkably low crowd of 31,199 turned out to watch the Alouettes stomp on the Roughriders in the first half, leaping out to a 24–0 lead on three Anthony Calvillo touchdown passes to Terry Vaughn, Ben Cahoon, Thyron Anderson and a Damon Duval field goal. By contrast, Saskatchewan quarterback Marcus Crandell struggled badly in the first half, after getting the start over Nealon Greene. The Roughriders offense helped the Alouettes by producing three turnovers.

After the embarrassing first half, Saskatchewan head coach Danny Barrett opted to leave Crandell in to start the third quarter. Crandell began to get over his struggles as the Alouettes sat back on their big lead, and threw a touchdown pass to Jamel Richardson early in the third quarter to give Roughriders fans some hope. But another touchdown pass to Jason French in the fourth quarter was the only other scoring the Roughriders could produce, and Duval hit two more field goals to send Montreal to Toronto for the East Final.

====West Semi-Final====

CALGARY – Every advantage seemed to belong to the Calgary Stampeders in their Battle of Alberta playoff date against their fiercest rival, the Edmonton Eskimos. The Stampeders were playing at home and were on a roll, having won seven of their last eight games. Moreover, they had humiliated the Eskimos the previous week in a game that could have allowed the Eskimos to finish first in the West. As if that weren&#x27;t enough, Edmonton&#x27;s star quarterback Ricky Ray was ice cold, having gone six games without a touchdown pass.

Sure enough, in front of a rabid home crowd, Calgary began to beat on Edmonton early. Three field goals by Calgary&#x27;s leadfooted kicker Sandro DeAngelis put Calgary up 9–0 through the first quarter, while running back Joffrey Reynolds ate the Eskimos defense for lunch. The Eskimos allowed another fourteen points in the second quarter. In part, thanks to a massive 63-yard run by little-used Tony Stallings, who had 93 yards on only four carries. Reynolds scored the touchdown that Stallings set up, and quarterback Henry Burris added another on a goal-line plunge before the half.

The Eskimos would have been in deep trouble if not for kicker Sean Fleming, who nailed four field goals in the second quarter to give Edmonton a chance. But it was 23–12 Calgary at the break and things were not looking good for the Eskimos. Edmonton quarterback Ray had continued to struggle getting into the end zone, but the deficit was not his doing. The defense had let him down, he had not turned the ball over, and he had been victimized by dropped passes, particularly a would-be touchdown pass dropped by Trevor Gaylor. However, Edmonton coach Danny Maciocia tried to change the momentum by putting backup quarterback, and former starter, Jason Maas in for the second half (in contrast to Saskatchewan coach Barrett&#x27;s decision to leave his quarterback in during the previous game).

With Maas under centre, the Eskimos began to claw back into the game. Calgary was held off the scoresheet in the third quarter while Fleming pounded his fifth field goal and added a &quot;rouge&quot; punt into the endzone. In the fourth quarter, Edmonton completed the comeback. The Eskimos started the fourth quarter with a devastating 93-yard clock-killing drive, finishing it up with a one-yard touchdown from fullback Mathieu Bertrand to tie the game at 23. The Stampeders began to roll on the next drive, but a fumble by Reynolds broke Calgary&#x27;s back, and a touchdown pass from Maas to Jason Tucker gave the Eskimos their first lead. Deangelis and Fleming swapped field goals but Calgary could not come back, and the Eskimos advanced to the Western final.

===Division Finals===
&quot;November 20&quot;

====East Final====

TORONTO – During the 2004 CFL season, the Toronto Argonauts stunned Montreal at their own field, taking a 26–18 victory over the favoured Alouettes in the East final. The Argonauts went on to take the Grey Cup, and the Alouettes came into Toronto looking for revenge.

Early on, it looked like they would not get it. Toronto had come to party, as a team which has suffered attendance problems in recent seasons drew a near-sellout crowd of 44,211 through the turnstiles. The unusual fan attention may have motivated the Argonauts early, as their experienced quarterback Damon Allen started on a roll. First, Allen scored the first points of the game with a one-yard touchdown run. Then, he threw a strike to receiver R. Jay Soward, who went 43 yards to the endzone. He then went to the stands, grabbed a bag of popcorn, and shared it with teammate Robert Baker in a rather novel showboating touchdown celebration.

That would be the high-water mark of the game for the Argonauts. In the second quarter, Damon Duval hit two field goals to make the score 14–6 at the half. Devastatingly, for the Alouettes, starting running back Robert Edwards went down in the second quarter with a rib injury. Backup Éric Lapointe came into the game and would become the key cog of Montreal&#x27;s offence in the second half.

Montreal&#x27;s defence began to catch on to Allen in the second half and the Toronto quarterback began taking hits and throwing ill-advised passes. He ended up with two interceptions and a fumble, while the Argonauts added three other fumbles to make a total of six turnovers. Lapointe scored three second-half running touchdowns for Montreal while quarterback Anthony Calvillo put in a mediocre 190 yards for a team renowned for aerial pyrotechnics. Allen&#x27;s 273 yards left Calvillo in the dust, but Montreal did not commit a single turnover in the game. Only a single Noel Prefontaine field goal in the third quarter accounted for Toronto scoring after the first half. Damon Duval hit four field goals to add to Lapointe&#x27;s three touchdowns giving Montreal a Grey Cup berth and a 33–17 victory.

====West Final====

VANCOUVER – On the heels of his benching against Calgary, it seemed likely that Edmonton head coach Danny Maciocia would leave Ricky Ray as the backup for the West final against the British Columbia Lions. However, Maciocia said mid-week that Ray would start, leaving Jason Maas on the bench. In B.C., Dave Dickenson unsurprisingly got the start over former Most Outstanding Player Casey Printers, leading some to joke that four of the CFL&#x27;s best quarterbacks would be in this game.

In contrast to their previous game against Calgary, Edmonton started out strong against British Columbia. They racked up two Sean Fleming field goals, a &quot;rouge&quot; punt through the endzone, and a one-yard touchdown plunge by Ray to notch fourteen first-quarter points. This compared to a single Mark McLoughlin field goal for B.C. Another Ray touchdown run in the second quarter gave the Eskimos a 21–3 lead before Casey Printers, sent in on a short yardage situation, scored a one-yard touchdown run of his own to narrow the lead to 21–10 at the half.

Ray had looked good in the first half, but ran into trouble not always of his own making. He threw an interception to Barron Miles that bounced off Edmonton receiver Trevor Gaylor&#x27;s shoulder pads and lost a fumble on a bad exchange. Two turnovers that produced ten points for the Lions. Meanwhile, Dickenson briefly got in a groove, nailing Geroy Simon with a ninety-yard touchdown toss, the longest in Lions playoff history. After another McLoughlin field goal and a &quot;rouge&quot; punt by Duncan O&#x27;Mahony, all of a sudden the game was tied at 21 after the third quarter.

To start the fourth quarter, Maciocia decided to make a quarterback change for the third consecutive game. He sent in Jason Maas to replace Ray, whose 17 of 28 for 207 yards, along with two rushing touchdowns, a fumble, and an interception, were acceptable but not fantastic.

Maas&#x27;s arrival seemed to spur on the Edmonton defence, as they shut Dickenson down the rest of the way. Dickenson threw an interception directly into the hands of Edmonton linebacker Steven Marsh. It was only his sixth interception that season and set up a Maas 15-yard pass to Trevor Gaylor to make it 28–21. The far-from-sellout but boisterous crowd of 37,337 grew restless and British Columbia coach Wally Buono sent in &quot;his&quot; backup, Printers, to great applause.

However, aside from a dramatic 47-yard pass to Paris Jackson, Printers was ineffective. After the toss to Jackson, Printers promptly threw an interception to Keyou Craver at the goal line. The Eskimos went two-and-out and opted to have Derrell Mitchell concede a safety rather than have Sean Fleming punt out of his own endzone. This pulled the Lions to within five points. The game ended on a controversial non-call, in which Casey Printers threw the ball up for Geroy Simon, however, he was bumped on his way to the ball, and the pass ended up being incomplete. Some argue that the Edmonton defender was merely exercising his fair right to the ball. Others argue that he interfered with Simon, while some suggest that the ball was not catchable at all. Regardless, the referees did not throw a flag, and Edmonton went on to win the Grey Cup.

<text>Todd Daniel Snider (born October 11, 1966) is an American singer-songwriter whose music incorporates elements of folk, rock, blues, alt country, and funk.

==Early career==
Snider was born in Portland, Oregon and grew up in nearby Beaverton, where he lived until he graduated from Beaverton High School in 1985. After high school, he moved to Santa Rosa, California to attend Santa Rosa Junior College. He only lasted one semester, but while there, he learned to play the harmonica.

With help from his brother Mike who bought him a plane ticket, Snider moved to San Marcos, Texas northeast of San Antonio, after leaving SRJC in the late fall of 1985. Not long after arriving in San Marcos, Snider saw Jerry Jeff Walker perform solo at Gruene Hall, a legendary dance hall in New Braunfels, Texas southwest of Austin. When he saw Walker that night, he decided he wanted to become a songwriter and began writing songs the next day. He told &quot;Lone Star Music Magazine&quot; in 2004, &quot;I didn&#x27;t even know how to really play guitar yet, but I saw his show and went and got one.&quot;

Snider met Kent Finlay at his very first writer&#x27;s night, which was at Finlay&#x27;s San Marcos club, Cheatham Street Warehouse. Finlay, who was a songwriter in his own right, became an important mentor and introduced Snider to the songs of Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark, John Prine, and Shel Silverstein among others. Snider was soon packing small rooms in San Marcos and over the next few years began to draw enthusiastic crowds in Austin, as well.

Snider also discovered Memphis songwriter Keith Sykes while living in San Marcos when a friend at the local record store turned him on to a pair of albums Sykes made in the early ’70s. In 1989, Snider&#x27;s father moved to Memphis and happened to meet Sykes’ sister-in-law. Through that connection, Snider sent Sykes a demo tape of some of his songs. Sykes thought one of the songs had potential, so Snider moved to Memphis to try to work with Sykes. Not long after he arrived in Memphis, Snider landed a weekly residency at a local club The Daily Planet. He not only was soon packing the room, the audience knew the words to the songs and would sing along. Through Sykes, Snider met Prine in 1991 while assisting on pre-production work Prine was doing with Sykes in Memphis for his album &quot;The Missing Years&quot;. It was the beginning of a friendship Snider and Prine had until Prine&#x27;s death in 2020. In 1992, Sykes helped Snider land a development deal with Capitol Records. He recorded a number of sides in Nashville for the label, but they declined to pick up his option for a full album.

Around the time of the Capitol deal, Snider began performing with a small band backing him which he dubbed the Bootleggers. The band&#x27;s lineup fluctuated some over the first year or so, but by the end of 1994, the lineup was set with Will Kimbrough on guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, and Joe McLeary on drums. Snider also had changed the band&#x27;s name to the Nervous Wrecks.

Sykes was a one-time member of Jimmy Buffett’s Coral Reefer Band and Buffett had recorded a few of his songs, so when the Capitol deal fell through, he reached out on Snider&#x27;s behalf to Buffett&#x27;s label, Margaritaville Records, which was distributed by MCA. Not long after label exec Bob Mercer saw Snider perform at an industry showcase in Memphis in April 1993, Snider flew to California to open a show for Buffett. After seeing his set, Buffett offered Snider a deal with Margaritaville.

==Recordings==
===1990s===
====Margaritaville/MCA years====
Snider&#x27;s debut album for Margaritaville, &quot;Songs for the Daily Planet&quot;, was released in 1994 and reached number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart. Produced by Tony Brown and Mike Utley, the album was literally composed of songs he was playing at the Daily Planet nightclub in Memphis. Although there were a few guest musicians and singers on the record, the core lineup was Snider on acoustic guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, Joe McLeary on drums, Utley on keyboards, Eddie Shaver on electric guitar, and Peter Hyrka on mandolin, acoustic guitar, and violin. The record included a hidden track, &quot;Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues,&quot; which became a minor radio hit, reaching No. 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart. A talking blues for Gen-X, the song mocked the early ’90s grunge scene and featured a band that refused to play. The video for another single from the album, &quot;Alright Guy,&quot; was in rotation on VH1.

Snider&#x27;s second album for Margaritaville/MCA, &quot;Step Right Up&quot;, was released on April 23, 1996, and &quot;Billboard&quot; proclaimed it to be &quot;more stunning than his debut.&quot; Brown and Utley were coproducers with Snider, and Utley backed Snider and the Wrecks on keyboards.

Snider&#x27;s third album, &quot;Viva Satellite&quot;, represented a turning point in his career. Prior to making the record, Margaritaville left MCA and signed with Island Records for distribution. But MCA retained rights to Snider&#x27;s recordings, so they would release the album. No longer recording for Margaritaville or working with Brown and Utley, Snider produced some sides at engineer Justin Niebank&#x27;s studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with mixed success. Only one of the tracks he cut there would make the album, the finale &quot;Doublewide Blues.&quot; Snider recorded the rest of the album at Ardent Studios in Memphis with producer-engineer John Hampton. He was backed by Kimbrough on guitar, Mariencheck on bass, Paul Buchignani on drums, and Rick Steff playing keyboards, and the result was a more straight-ahead rock record than his first two. Shortly before the album was released in May 1998, there was trouble at a private performance in L.A. for MCA execs and their staffs. Snider, who was struggling with drugs at the time, insulted those in attendance early in the set and then left the stage. Not long thereafter, MCA released him from his contract.

===2000s===
====Oh Boy years====
After leaving MCA, Snider disbanded the Nervous Wrecks and signed with John Prine’s independent label, Oh Boy Records. Oh Boy released his fourth album, &quot;Happy To Be Here&quot;, on April 18, 2000. Working with producer Ray Kennedy, Snider recorded all the songs solo acoustic, then additional instrumentation was added to his guitar and vocal tracks. Besides Kennedy who played a variety of instruments on the record, guitarists Pat Buchanan and Will Kimbrough, bassists Joey Spampinato and Keith Christopher, keyboardist Johnny Neel, drummer Paul Buchignani, multi-instrumentalist Peter Holsapple, violinist Tammy Rogers, and horn players Jim Hoke and Wayne Jackson all contributed to the album.

Oh Boy released Snider&#x27;s second album for the label, &quot;New Connection&quot;, on May 14, 2002. Produced by R.S. Field, &quot;Billboard&quot; said of the album, &quot;Snider has settled into a groove of consistent quality and potent observation.&quot;

Snider&#x27;s third Oh Boy release was a live album, &quot;Near Truths and Hotel Rooms&quot;, which was released on May 13, 2003. The record, which was recorded at half a dozen venues, captured Snider&#x27;s live show post-Nervous Wrecks—just him solo with his acoustic guitar and harmonica. Robert Christgau gave the album an A− grade in his Consumer Guide.

Snider&#x27;s final studio album for Oh Boy, &quot;East Nashville Skyline&quot;, was released on July 20, 2004. For the first time, Snider took full creative control of his record-making process, and the result was an album that was both a musical and cultural breakthrough. It introduced East Nashville to the larger world, and its influence reverberates to this day. Snider co-produced the record with his old Nervous Wrecks bandmate Will Kimbrough at engineer Eric McCullough&#x27;s east Nashville studio. In addition to guitarist Kimbrough and multi-instrumentalist McCullough, he was backed on the sessions by a who&#x27;s who of east Nashville musicians including guitarist Tim Carroll, bassists Dave Jacques and Dave Roe, drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright, and pianist John Deadrick. &quot;East Nashville Skyline&quot; included two iconic songs that added to the songwriting canon: &quot;Play a Train Song&quot; pushed the boundaries of &quot;train&quot; songs with the story of a man who was known for always requesting that kind of song, and &quot;The Ballad of the Kingsmen&quot; took the talking blues to a more contemporary place musically while connecting the censorship of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; culturally to the Columbine shootings. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the album &quot;the wittiest and feistiest album of his career.&quot; Christgau gave it an A in his Consumer Guide and called it &quot;a slacker wakeup call.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked it the seventh-best album of 2004. &quot;East Nashville Skyline&quot; reached No. 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums chart.

After &quot;East Nashville Skyline&quot;, Snider moved to Bob Mercer&#x27;s New Door Records label which was distributed by Universal Music Group, but Oh Boy would issue one more album of his music. On April 3, 2007, the label released &quot;Peace, Love And Anarchy (Rarities, B-Sides And Demos, Vol. I)&quot;, a compilation of previously unreleased recordings. Notable among the collection&#x27;s fourteen tracks is the song &quot;East Nashville Skyline&quot; which was intended to be the title track of the album of the same name but Snider did not finish it in time to make the album.

====New Door years====
While Snider was working on his first record for New Door, UMG released a selection of his Margaritaville and MCA back catalog. The collection, &quot;That Was Me: 1994-1998&quot;, was released on August 30, 2005, through their reissue arm, Hip-O Records. The compilation included seventeen tracks from all three of the albums distributed by MCA, including &quot;Alright Guy&quot; and &quot;Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues,&quot; plus a previously unreleased cover of &quot;Margaritaville, a breakneck rendition on which he was backed by the Nervous Wrecks.

Snider&#x27;s first release for New Door was &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, the acclaimed follow-up to &quot;East Nashville Skyline&quot; released on August 8, 2006. Working again with co-producers Will Kimbrough and Eric McConnell, who both played multiple instruments on the album, Snider also was backed on the record by guitarist Tommy Womack, bassists Billy Mercer, Robert Kearns, and Dave Jacques, drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright, pianist Dave Zollo, violinist Molly Thomas, and legendary steel guitarist Lloyd Green. The record went to number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart. Christgau gave it an A in his Consumer Guide and called it &quot;better&quot; than its predecessor. The record was named to several critics&#x27; year-end &quot;best&quot; lists, including a number 33 ranking in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s top 50 albums of the year, a number 25 ranking by &quot;No Depression&quot; magazine, and number 14 by &quot;Blender&quot; magazine.

On October 20, 2006, Snider made a solo acoustic in-store appearance at Grimey&#x27;s New and Preloved Records in Nashville, performing material from &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;. The performance was recorded and released by New Door on April 3, 2007, as &quot;Live With The Devil You Know At Grimey&#x27;s Nashville 10.20.06&quot;. It was his final release on the New Door label.

====Launch of Aimless Records====
In 2008, Snider launched his own independent record label, Aimless Records. The label&#x27;s first release was his eight-song EP &quot;Peace Queer&quot;, the most political record of his career. The title was inspired by the ’60s avant garde rock band The Fugs who had a line about killing &quot;peace queers.&quot; As Snider tells it in the press bio for the album, he was kidnapped by an international league of peace queers who forced him to write the protest songs that appeared on the record. Three of the tracks on the EP were recorded at co-producer Eric McConnell&#x27;s studio with backing from some of the musicians who worked on Snider&#x27;s two previous albums, including guitarist Will Kimbrough, bassist Dave Jacques, keyboardist Dave Zollo, and drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright. The remainder of the EP was recorded with co-producer Doug Lancio at his studio with Lancio providing musical accompaniment and Patty Griffin contributing backing vocals to two of the tracks—&quot;Cape Henry&quot; and the cover of John Fogerty&#x27;s &quot;Fortunate Son.&quot; Released on October 14, 2008, the record went to number one on the Americana Airplay Chart and number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart.

====Yep Roc album====
Aimless did not release Snider&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Excitement Plan&quot;, because he had already committed it to Yep Roc Records, but it would be the last record he would make for another record label. Produced by Don Was and released on June 9, 2009, the album featured Snider with minimal backing: Was on upright bass, Jim Keltner on drums, and Greg Leisz on dobro and pedal steel. &quot;PopMatters&quot; called the record &quot;a masterwork of intimacy&quot; and said it &quot;solidified his place among the masters of the form.&quot; The Associated Press called it &quot;the finest album of his career.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it four stars. Robert Christgau gave it a B+ in his Consumer Guide. The album went to number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart, and number 31 on the magazine&#x27;s Independent Albums chart.

===2010s===
====Aimless label years====
On February 1, 2011, Aimless released a double-disc live album by Snider, &quot;Live: The Storyteller&quot;. The album featured performances of songs spanning much of Snider&#x27;s career along with some of the stories that have become a staple of his live shows. The performances were selected from recordings of concerts in 2010, primarily from shows in Nashville; Asheville, North Carolina; and Ann Arbor, Michigan, but also from his appearance that year at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. On some of the selections, Snider is backed by the jam band Great American Taxi. Christgau gave the album an A− in his Consumer Guide. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said the album &quot;does a magnificent job of capturing the onetime San Marcos scenester&#x27;s genius, a heady combo of post-folk punk and stoned comedian.&quot; The album went to number seven on &quot;Billboard&quot;’s Heatseekers Albums chart and reached number 36 on the magazine&#x27;s Independent Albums chart.

After working with them on the road in 2010, Snider produced an album on Great American Taxi in 2011, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. The record was released by the band&#x27;s own label on February 22, 2012.

Also in 2012, Aimless released a pair of albums by Snider. The first, &quot;Agnostic Hymns &amp; Stoner Fables&quot;, was released on March 6 and included nine original songs plus a cover of Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s &quot;West Nashville Grand Ballroom Gown.&quot; The album&#x27;s themes of economic inequality were widely noted. &quot;The East Nashvillian&quot; said Snider was a &quot;one-man Occupy Wall Street&quot; on the record. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;Occupy Nashville.&quot; Snider recorded the album at Eric McConnell&#x27;s studio with McConnell co-producing and engineering as well as playing bass. Snider, who played acoustic and electric guitar and harmonica, was also accompanied on the record by violinist/backing vocalist Amanda Shires, Great American Taxi keyboardist Chad Staehly, and drummer Paul Griffith. In addition, Jason Isbell contributed slide guitar and backing vocals to &quot;Digger Dave&#x27;s Crazy Woman Blues.&quot; The record earned an A grade in Robert Christgau’s Consumer Guide. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; gave it four-and-a-half stars. The album landed on three different &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It was number six on the Americana/Folk Albums chart, number 15 on the Independent Albums chart, and number 23 on the Top Rock Albums chart. It also made a number of year-end lists, most notably number five on Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Top 102 Albums of 2012.&quot; It also was ranked number 11 on &quot;American Songwriter&quot;’s &quot;Top 50 Albums of 2012,&quot; number 40 on both &quot;The Village Voice&quot;’s Pazz and Jop: Top 100 Albums of 2012, &quot;Paste&quot;’s &quot;50 Best Albums of 2012,&quot; and number 47 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;’s &quot;Top 50 Albums of 2012.&quot;

On April 24, 2012, Aimless released Snider&#x27;s tribute album honoring one of his early mentors, &quot;Time As We Know It: The Songs of Jerry Jeff Walker&quot;. Produced by Don Was, Snider was backed on the album by the members of Great American Taxi (Vince Herman, acoustic guitar, mandolin, backing vocals; Chad Staehly, keyboards; Brian Adams, bass, backing vocals; Jim Lewin, electric guitar, backing vocals; and Chris Sheldon, drums, backing vocals.) In addition, Kix Brooks, Elizabeth Cook, and Amy LaVere were guest vocalists on the album. &quot;PopMatters&quot; called the album &quot;Snider&#x27;s love letter to Jerry Jeff Walker.&quot; The album went to number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Americana/Folk Albums chart.

====Hard Working Americans====
In 2013, Snider cofounded the jam band supergroup Hard Working Americans with Widespread Panic bassist Dave Schools. The band&#x27;s lineup was Snider on vocals, Schools on bass, Neal Casal on guitar, Chad Staehly on keyboards, and Duane Trucks on drums. After they recorded their first album at Bob Weir’s TRI Studios, they added a sixth member, guitarist and lap steel player Jesse Aycock. The band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Hard Working Americans&quot;, was released by Melvin Records on January 21, 2014, and included 11 songs written by songwriters Snider admires, including Randy Newman, Dave Rawlings and Gillian Welch, Kevn Kinney, Hayes Carll, and Will Kimbrough. Later that same year on October 28, Melvin released &quot;The First Waltz&quot;, a two-disc set that included a CD featuring 11 live recordings by HWA plus a new studio recording with Rosanne Cash, &quot;Come From The Heart,&quot; and a full-length documentary film about the band directed by Justin Kreutzmann.

Melvin released Hard Working Americans’ second studio album, &quot;Rest in Chaos&quot;, on May 13, 2016. The record featured a dozen songs with lyrics by Snider and music by the entire band, plus a cover of Guy Clark’s &quot;The High Price of Inspiration.&quot; &quot;American Songwriter&quot; gave the record four stars out of five.

On August 4, 2017, Melvin Records released a live double album by Hard Working Americans, &quot;We’re All In This Together&quot;. Robert Christgau rated the album an A− in his Consumer Guide and called it &quot;the rock dream the hippies invented before they burned out.&quot; In the spring of 2017, the band went into Cash Cabin Studios and recorded more than an album&#x27;s worth of material written by Snider, but those recordings have yet to be released.

====Elmo Buzz and the Eastside Bulldogs====
In between his work with Hard Working Americans, Snider finished the album &quot;Eastside Bulldog&quot; which Aimless released on October 6, 2016. While it was released under Snider&#x27;s name, the material grew out of his side project/alter ego Elmo Buzz and the Eastside Bulldogs who specialize in ’50s and early ’60s rock and roll. Six of the ten songs originally appeared on an EP &quot;Shit Sandwich&quot; that Aimless released in 2011 as a free download under Elmo Buzz&#x27;s name. Snider was backed on those sides by Eric McConnell on bass, Jen Gunderman on piano, Mark Horn on drums, and Dennis Taylor on saxophone. In 2016, Snider cut four more sides to complete the album with backing from Aaron Lee Tasjan on guitar, Keith Christopher on bass, Paul Griffith on drums, Robbie Crowell on sax, and Rorey Carroll on percussion, among others. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; called &quot;Eastside Bulldog&quot; &quot;26 minutes of perfection that will rip your ears off.&quot; The record went to number 13 on &quot;Billboard&quot;’s Americana/Folk Albums chart, number 29 on the Independent Albums chart, and number 41 on the Top Rock Albums chart.

====Return to folk roots====
On March 15, 2019, Aimless Records released Snider&#x27;s 13th studio album, &quot;Cash Cabin Sessions, Vol. 3&quot;. Coproduced with Chad Staehly, Snider returned to his folk roots on the solo acoustic album, playing all the instruments on the 10 songs recorded at Cash Cabin Studio in the fall of 2018. Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires added backing vocals to two of the tracks, &quot;The Blues on Banjo&quot; and &quot;A Timeless Response to Current Events.&quot; Isbell also added a backing vocal to the single &quot;Like a Force of Nature.&quot; Half the songs on the record were among those he recorded with Hard Working Americans at the studio in 2017. Christgau graded the album an A in his Consumer Guide. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it four stars. The record went to number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;’s Independent Albums chart, number 11 on the Americana/Folk Albums chart, number 21 on the Vinyl Albums chart, and number 23 on the Album Sales chart.

===2020s===
With the release of &quot;First Agnostic Church of Hope and Wonder&quot; by Aimless on April 23, 2021, Snider fulfilled his longtime vision of combining funk with folk. He produced the record and played most of the instruments on it, including electric bass, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, banjo and piano. He also sang all the backing vocals. Robbie Crowell handled drums and percussion. Tchad Blake mixed the record, as well as contributed a few sonic and musical touches. &quot;No Depression&quot; said the record showed Snider &quot;in all his glory.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said it was &quot;a raw portrait of a world-class songwriter processing calamity and chaos in real time.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ in his Consumer Guide. The album reached number 21 on &quot;Billboard&quot;’s Americana/Folk Albums chart and number 36 on the Album Sales chart.

===Tribute recordings===
In addition to his own recordings, Snider has contributed covers to a number of tribute albums during his career beginning in 1996 when he teamed with Joe Ely on a cover of &quot;Oh Boy&quot; for the Buddy Holly tribute album, &quot;Not Fade Away (Remembering Buddy Holly)&quot;.

On August 16, 2004, Snider appeared at a tribute concert at the Paramount Theater in Austin, Texas, to honor Billy Joe Shaver on his 65th birthday. Snider&#x27;s performance of Shaver&#x27;s &quot;Waco Moon&quot; was included on &quot;A Tribute To Billy Joe Shaver - Live&quot;, an album documenting the concert which was released on May 17, 2005. In 2006, three tribute albums were released that included sides by Snider. He recorded &quot;Maybe You Heard&quot; for &quot;The Pilgrim: A Celebration of Kris Kristofferson&quot; released on June 27 of that year.

Snider contributed a cover of &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; to the 2010 album, &quot;Twistable Turnable Man: A Musical Tribute to the Songs of Shel Silverstein&quot;. The record also included covers by Kris Kristofferson, John Prine, Bobby Bare, Lucinda Williams, Nanci Griffith, and Black Francis. In 2017, Snider covered &quot;It Sure Was Better Back Then&quot; for the tribute album &quot;An American Troubadour: The Songs of Steve Forbert&quot; which was released on October 6 of that year.

During a break in the making of &quot;Tension: On the Road With Todd Snider&quot;, Snider composed and performed a short instrumental piece for the Barnes brothers’ comedic short, &quot;Long Road Home&quot;, released that same year. He also composed the music for their 2010 film, &quot;The Locksmith&quot;. Snider also has starred in two &quot;mockumentaries&quot; directed by brothers. The first was 2009&#x27;s &quot;Peace Queer: The Movie&quot;. The 42-minute film allegedly offering proof that peace queers had kidnapped Snider and made him write the anti-war protest songs that appeared on his &quot;Peace Queer&quot; EP. He also starred in the Barnes brothers’ 2013 feature-length, stoner musical mockumentary, &quot;East Nashville Tonight&quot;, alongside Elizabeth Cook.

==Songs covered by other artists==
Over the course of his career, Snider has written and cowritten a large number of songs which were covered by other artists.

===1990s===
His first cut was by Rick Trevino who recorded Snider&#x27;s &quot;She Just Left Me Lounge&quot; for his 1994 eponymous release. Then the following year, Mark Chesnutt covered &quot;Trouble&quot; for his album &quot;Wings&quot;. Terry McMillan covered &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Comin’,&quot; a spiritual number which Snider cowrote with Mark Marchetti and Shannon Hills, on his 1997 release &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Comin’ &quot;. Subsequently, that song was covered by numerous artists, including Russ Taff on his 1999 album, &quot;Right Here Right Now&quot;.

In 1997, Jack Ingram recorded &quot;Airways Motel,&quot; for the album &quot;Livin&#x27; or Dyin&#x27;&quot;, the first of several songs he would cowrite with Snider. Two years later, Ingram recorded a pair of songs they cowrote, &quot;Feel Like I&#x27;m Falling In Love&quot; and &quot;Barbie Doll,&quot; for 1999&#x27;s &quot;Hey You&quot;. Snider and Jason Ringenberg cowrote &quot;This Town Isn&#x27;t Keeping You Down,&quot; which appeared on Jason &amp; The Scorchers&#x27; 1998 release, &quot;Midnight Roads &amp; Stages Seen&quot;.

<text>Hugh Quincy Alexander (August 7, 1911 – September 17, 1989) was a Democratic U.S. Representative from North Carolina between 1953 and 1963.

Born on a farm near Glendon, North Carolina in Moore County in 1911, Alexander attended local public schools and then Duke University, graduating in 1932. He then studied law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was admitted to the bar in 1937. Practicing law in Kannapolis, North Carolina for several years, Alexander then served in the United States Navy during World War II from 1942 to 1946, including thirty-four months of duty overseas.

In 1947 and 1949, Alexander served in the North Carolina House of Representatives. He was a solicitor for the Cabarrus County Recorders Court from 1950 to 1952 and a state commander for the American Legion in 1951.

In 1952, Alexander was elected to the 83rd U.S. Congress, succeeding former Ways and Means chairman Robert Doughton. He was reelected four times, but never was able to establish a secure foothold in his district due to a somewhat liberal voting record and growing Republican influence in the district.

He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;.

North Carolina lost a congressional district after the 1960 census, and the state legislature saw a chance to get rid of Charlotte-area congressman Charles R. Jonas, then the only Republican in the North Carolina delegation. In the process, however, they added several Republican-leaning areas to Alexander&#x27;s district. The plan backfired disastrously in the 1962 elections, in which Jonas won easily in his new district and Alexander lost by less than a percentage point to Republican furniture executive Jim Broyhill. As of 2020; no Democrat has represented North Carolina&#x27;s 9th district since Alexander&#x27;s defeat.

After leaving Congress, he was chief counsel to the Senate Rules and Administration Committee from 1963 to 1976. Alexander died in Kannapolis in 1989.

<text>Sydenham Benoni Alexander (December 8, 1840June 14, 1921) was a Democratic U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1891 and 1895.

==Early life==
Alexander, born near Charlotte, North Carolina in 1840, attended preparatory schools in Rocky River and Wadesboro and graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1860. His uncle, William Graham, was Governor of North Carolina as well as Secretary of the Navy.

==Career==
At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, he enlisted in the Confederate Army as a private in the First Regiment, North Carolina Volunteer Infantry. He was elected captain of Company K, Forty-second North Carolina Regiment, in June 1862. He detached from his company in 1864 and served as inspector general on the staff of Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke.

After the Civil War, Alexander was a member of the North Carolina Senate in 1879, 1883, 1885, 1887, where he was instrumental in the establishment of the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (later North Carolina State University; Alexander served on its board of trustees), and was president of the North Carolina Railroad. He became the first president of the North Carolina Farmers Alliance around 1887. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of North Carolina in 1888. After his defeat at the state convention by Daniel Gould Fowle, Alexander was offered the nomination for Lieutenant Governor but declined.

A Democrat, Alexander was elected to the U.S. House in 1890 and served in the 52nd and 53rd Congresses. He did not run for a third term in 1894, but retired to his &quot;Enderly Plantation&quot; estate in Mecklenburg County. He served one additional term in the North Carolina Senate in 1901.

==Death and legacy ==
Alexander finally moved to Charlotte in 1906 and died there in 1921; he is buried in Elmwood Cemetery. His distant relatives include Vice President Adlai Stevenson and Senate Minority Leader John Sharp Williams.
