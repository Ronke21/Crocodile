<text>Masten Gregory (February 29, 1932 − November 8, 1985) was an American racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Nicknamed &quot;The [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] Flash&quot;, Gregory won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with NART.

Gregory participated in 43 Formula One Grands Prix, predominantly with privateer teams; he also competed in numerous non-championship races, winning the 1962 Kanonloppet with BRP. Gregory was also successful in sportscar racing, entering 16 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans between and , winning in alongside Jochen Rindt, driving the Ferrari 250LM.

==Career==
Known as the &quot;Kansas City Flash&quot;, Masten Gregory was born in Kansas City, Missouri, as the youngest of three children; his elder brother was Riddelle L. Gregory Jr., also a race car driver, and his elder sister Nancy Lee Gregory married, as her second husband, the Anglo-American fashion designer Charles James. An heir to an insurance company fortune, Gregory was well known for his youngish looks and thick eyeglasses, due to his &quot;terrible&quot; eyesight. Although he attended the Pembroke-Country Day School in Kansas City, he left school before completing his senior year, and married Luella Simpson at the age of 19. His parents divorced when he was very young, and his father died when he was three years old. As an adult, Gregory used his inheritance to buy a Mercury-powered Allard, which he drove in his first race, the SCCA race in Caddo Mills, Texas, in November 1952. He retired from that race due to head gasket failure, but installed a new Chrysler hemi-powered engine in his car to race at Sebring in 1953, where he again retired, this time due to a rear suspension failure. Gregory&#x27;s first win came in just his third race, in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Changing to a Jaguar, Gregory won several races in America, including the Guardsmans Trophy in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco and a race at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska. At the end of 1953, Gregory was invited to his first international sports car race - the 1954 1000 km Buenos Aires in Argentina, which he finished in 14th due to water pump problems.

===Coming to Europe===
Throughout 1954 and 1955, Gregory competed in European races, usually driving Ferraris. His record includes the Tourist Trophy at Dundrod and the 24 Hours of Le Mans (although his co-driver Mike Sparken retired before Gregory got a chance to drive). He also won the inaugural Nassau Trophy at the Bahamas Speed Week in 1954. Moving back to America in 1956, Gregory entered several SCCA races, often winning. In 1957, he had another attempt at the Argentine 1000 km race, this time winning. This performance got him a drive with Guglielmo Dei&#x27;s Scuderia Centro Sud, a privateer Formula One team using the Maserati 250F. His first race was the 1957 Monaco Grand Prix, where he scored an impressive third-place finish, the first podium for an American in an F1 Grand Prix. He followed this with a string of good results, coming eighth in the German Grand Prix, and fourth in both the Pescara and Italian Grands Prix. Despite only competing in half of the races, Gregory ended the 1957 season in sixth place in the championship.

Gregory only competed in four Grands Prix in the 1958 season, due to injuries sustained through one of his trademark bailouts when his car was set to crash, this time in a sports car race at Silverstone in England. He did manage a fourth place at the Italian Grand Prix, and a 6th in the last race of the year, this Moroccan Grand Prix. Moving to Cooper-Climax for the 1959 season alongside Jack Brabham and Bruce McLaren, he scored two podium finishes - a third place at the Dutch Grand Prix, and a career-best second at the Portuguese Grand Prix. However, he missed the final two races of the season, again due to injuries sustained jumping from a car moments before it crashed. He finished eighth in the Championship, and with teammate Brabham winning the World Championship, Cooper won their first Constructor&#x27;s Championship. Gregory scored a pole position and set a course record at the non-Championship race at Aintree, but his contract with Cooper was not renewed for the following year.

Gregory&#x27;s early years of competition were marked by many crashes, often the result of pushing sub-par machinery past its ability. He flipped a thankfully rollbar-equipped Maserati at the Venezuelan Grand Prix in 1957, totalled two sports cars in 1958, and another two in 1959 (a Lister-Jaguar and a Tojeiro-Jaguar). In the latter of these incidents he broke his leg and shoulder, keeping him away from his Formula 1 commitments. In 1960, trying to qualify an outdated Cooper-Maserati at Nürburgring he went off the track and was thrown clear of the car. After this period, however, his driving style matured and he began to develop a reputation as an elegant and careful driver.

Gregory continued in Formula One until 1965, but mainly with uncompetitive independent teams. He was unable to reproduce the results he obtained early in his career, his best being a sixth at the 1962 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen with the UDT Laystall team, in a Lotus 24. Running fourth, just behind eventual winner Dan Gurney at the French Grand Prix, Gregory retired with ignition problems, losing possibly his best chance at a maiden Grand Prix victory. Gregory did manage a win in the non-Championship 1962 Kanonloppet race at Karlskoga in Sweden, but this race did not feature any top teams.

===After Formula One===
After his release from Cooper, Gregory also went back to competing in sports car races, setting the overall fastest lap at the 1960 24 Hours of Le Mans. He won the 1961 1000 km Nürburgring, driving alongside Lloyd &quot;Lucky&quot; Casner in a Maserati Tipo 61 for the America Camoradi Racing Team. In the same year, Gregory finished fifth in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Porsche RS61 Spyder. 1962 saw Gregory win the Canadian Grand Prix sports car race at Mosport Park in a Lotus 19-Climax. In 1964, Gregory again competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, this time in a Ford GT40. He retired from the race in the fifth hour due to gearbox difficulties. The following year, Gregory teamed up with the man who was to become 1970 Formula One World Champion, Austrian Jochen Rindt, and the pair won the race in a North American Racing Team Ferrari 250 LM. 1965 was also the year in which Gregory raced in the Indianapolis 500, starting from the back of the grid and working his way up to 5th before being forced to retire due to an engine problem.

Gregory then began to wind down his motor racing career, continuing to compete in international sports car races with some good results including a second-place finish at the 1966 1000 km race at Monza alongside John Whitmore. Following his good friend Jo Bonnier&#x27;s death at the 1972 Le Mans race, Gregory stopped racing, and retired to Amsterdam, where he worked as a diamond merchant before operating a glassware business. On November 8, 1985, Gregory died in his sleep of a heart attack at his winter home in Porto Ercole, Italy. He had four children, Masten Jr., Debbie, Scott and Michael. Gregory was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 2005, the Kansas City C.A.R.B. (Central Auto Racing Boosters) Hall of Fame in 2007 and the Watkins Glen Walk of Fame in 2012. He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2013.

Gregory is in a distinct club of motorsport being only one of nineteen drivers to compete in all three legs of the Triple Crown of Motorsport (Indianapolis 500, 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Monaco Grand Prix) and to have won at least one of those events. The others are: Louis Chiron, Jack Brabham, Jim Clark, Graham Hill (who won all three), Dan Gurney, Jochen Rindt (who won two), Mario Andretti, Mark Donohue, Jackie Stewart, Denny Hulme, Danny Sullivan, Vern Schuppan, Stefan Johansson, Michele Alboreto, Eddie Cheever, Jacques Villeneuve, Juan Pablo Montoya (who has won two) and Fernando Alonso (who has won two).

<text>Maurício Gugelmin (born 20 April 1963) is a Brazilian former racing driver and businessman, who competed in Formula One from to . 

Born and raised in Joinville, Gugelmin began competitive kart racing aged seven, winning several regional and national titles. He progressed to Formula Ford in 1982, dominating the British and European championships. Gugelmin then won the 1985 British Formula Three Championship, further winning the Macau Grand Prix to emulate Ayrton Senna two years prior. Gugelmin signed for March in , making his Formula One debut at his home Grand Prix in Brazil. In his rookie season, he scored points finishes at the British and Hungarian Grands Prix, driving the Adrian Newey-designed 881. Retaining his seat for , Gugelmin achieved his only career podium finish at the season-opening . After two further seasons at the re-branded Leyton House—including a non-classified championship finish in —Gugelmin moved to Jordan for his campaign, but was unable to score points again and departed at the end of the season.

After exiting Formula One, Gugelmin competed in CART IndyCar from 1993 to 2001. Across 147 races, Gugelmin achieved eight podiums, including one victory at the Molson Indy Vancouver in 1997, finishing a career-best fourth in the standings that year. His best result at the Indianapolis 500 came in 1995, where he finished sixth after leading 59 laps. For a period, he held the world speed record for a closed race track, set at California Speedway in 1997 at a speed of . Gugelmin retired from motor racing at the end of 2001 following the death of his son.

== Personal and early life ==

Gugelmin was born to a wealthy family in Joinville, Brazil on 20 April 1963. His father is a timber merchant and a collector of antique cars. Gugelmin is married to Stella Maris, and they have two sons, Bernardo and Gabriel. Their third son, Giuliano, who was Bernardo&#x27;s twin, died from cerebral palsy in April 2001 at the age of six.

== Career ==

=== Before Formula One ===

Gugelmin started racing go-karts as a child in Brazil in 1971, winning his local championship nine years in a row from 1971 to 1979. He progressed to the Brazilian national championship in 1980, which he also won. He progressed to single-seater racing cars in 1981, when he won the Brazilian Formula Fiat Championship.

In 1982 Gugelmin, like many Brazilian drivers of his generation, moved to the United Kingdom to further his racing career. He was a longtime friend of future Formula One world champion Ayrton Senna, who was already racing in the country, and the two shared a house from 1982 to 1987. Senna, having previously been a Formula Ford driver with the Van Diemen team, used his influence within the organisation to secure Gugelmin a race seat with them for 1982. By the end of the year, Gugelmin was the British Formula Ford 1600 cc champion with 13 race wins and 90 points scored. He followed this up by finishing as runner-up in the British Formula Ford 2000 cc series the following year. He moved to the European Formula Ford series in 1984, and won the title at his first attempt. A progression to Formula Three followed in 1985 with West Surrey Racing, winning the British championship and the season-ending Macau Grand Prix. Gugelmin subsequently spent two years in International Formula 3000 (F3000), the final step before Formula One, competing with sponsorship backing for the 1986 season. He took one victory in F3000, at Silverstone in 1987 while driving for the Ralt factory team.

Gugelmin entered Formula One, the highest category of circuit racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), motorsport&#x27;s world governing body, with the March team in the 1988 season, as team-mate to Ivan Capelli. He had previously been in contention for a drive with Lotus in the 1986 championship at the request of his friend Ayrton Senna, however the British team could not promote two Brazilian drivers and he was overlooked in favour of Johnny Dumfries. Gugelmin began the season with five retirements from the first six races due to mechanical failure, but soon afterwards he took his first points scoring finish with fourth place at the . Gugelmin scored points in one other race with a fifth-place finish at the . He finished the season as the highest-scoring newcomer in the Formula One World Championship, ending the year in 13th position overall.

The 1989 championship was barren for the March team, and Gugelmin took their only points scoring finish of the year at the . He finished in third position; an excellent result given that March were financially troubled. At the , Gugelmin was involved in a large accident at the start of the race which resulted in a spectacular barrel roll. A photograph of the accident was later selected for a London Exhibition as one of Formula One&#x27;s most striking photographs. The race was stopped as a result; Gugelmin took the restart from the pit lane and set the race&#x27;s fastest lap, the only one of his F1 career.

In the March team was sold, and became known as Leyton House. Gugelmin was once again partnered by Capelli, but the team&#x27;s CG901 chassis proved troublesome, and between them they failed to qualify six times during the season, including at the . However, at the next race, the , modifications had been made to the car, which improved the performance. Running the whole race without changing their tyres, Capelli and Gugelmin ran first and second during the race. Gugelmin retired from fourth position mid-race with engine problems but he went on to score a single point for finishing in sixth place in the later in the season.

The 1991 championship saw internal turmoil at the team with several key staff leaving. The car lacked pace and both Gugelmin and Capelli struggled; the team scored just one point all season. Gugelmin&#x27;s best result amounted to three seventh-place finishes, although he retired from eight of the season&#x27;s sixteen races. In September, the team&#x27;s principal, Akira Akagi, was arrested on suspicion of fraud. Money was tight, and Gugelmin made the decision to leave the team at the end of the year. A switch to the Jordan team for the 1992 season did not improve Gugelmin&#x27;s fortunes. The team struggled with financial difficulties and scored only one point all year. The team&#x27;s Yamaha engine was underpowered, and the car was unreliable. Gugelmin failed to finish eleven out of the sixteen races, and scored no points.

=== Champ Car ===
Gugelmin signed with Dick Simon Racing to take part in the North American Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) racing series for the last three races of 1993. Although races at Mid Ohio and Nazareth resulted in non-finishes, Gugelmin finished 13th at Laguna Seca although this was not high enough to receive any points. Despite this, Gugelmin demonstrated promise. In the 1994 season, Gugelmin signed with Chip Ganassi Racing to partner Michael Andretti who returned to the series after a season in Formula One. Andretti was more successful than Gugelmin, and took two wins, including Reynard&#x27;s first win in Champ Car at Surfers Paradise. Gugelmin was hindered by a lack of cooperation between his and Andretti&#x27;s crews, and his first full-time year in the Champ Car World Series resulted in seven points finishes and 16th in the points standings.

The 1995 season commenced with Gugelmin finishing in second place to Jacques Villeneuve in the first round of the year at Miami. He went on to finish in sixth position at the Indianapolis 500 after leading the most laps of any driver. Eight additional points finishes, including a third place at the final round at Laguna Seca, meant he finished tenth in the final drivers&#x27; points standings, nine positions ahead of his experienced teammate and former series champion Danny Sullivan.

For the 1996 championship, Gugelmin was partnered at PacWest by the British driver Mark Blundell. He established a reputation for being quick at superspeedway tracks after taking a second and a third place at the two events at Michigan International Speedway. On top of this he took four other points finishes, finishing the season in 14th place. For the 1997 season, Gugelmin had lost under a fitness programme, and the PacWest team switched to using Firestone tyres and Mercedes-Benz engines. The package was competitive throughout the year and Gugelmin and Blundell finished fourth and sixth in the championship respectively. Gugelmin&#x27;s notable races of the year include the Detroit Indy Grand Prix, where Gugelmin was leading the race on the last lap when he ran out of fuel, and the Molson Indy Vancouver, where Gugelmin won his first Champ Car race. One of the most popular men in the championship, virtually the entire pit-lane was full of happiness for him. In qualifying for the final race of the season at the California Speedway, Gugelmin set a world record for the fastest ever lap of a closed race track at . This record stood until 2000 when Gil de Ferran surpassed it with a lap of , also at California Speedway. Gugelmin went on to finish the race in fourth place.

The 1998 championship proved not to be as successful. Setbacks plagued the team and they struggled to get to grips with the new chassis. Gugelmin showed determination, and scored nine points-scoring finishes. A highlight was Gugelmin leading 40 laps during the final event at California Speedway, en route to finishing in fifth place. Gugelmin was unable to reproduce his race-winning form, and finished no higher than 15th position in the final points standings over the next three years. In the 2000 season, Gugelmin was named as the chairman of the Championship Drivers Association, the organisation set up to represent the interests of the drivers in the CART series. That year, his best finish was a second place at Nazareth Speedway and was 17th in the points standings.

The 2001 season saw PacWest switch engine manufacturers from Mercedes to Toyota and Gugelmin would be partnered by Indy Lights champion Scott Dixon. During the practice session for the race at Texas Motor Speedway, Gugelmin crashed after he lost control in the second turn and hit the wall with the acceleration peaked at 66.2 g, before a second impact with the wall where acceleration peaked at 113.1 g. The event was eventually cancelled after drivers complained of dizziness, nausea and blurred vision, which were caused by the high g-forces experienced when driving at speed on the track. During the week before the race at Nazareth Speedway, Gugelmin&#x27;s son, Giuliano, died from respiratory complications. Giuliano was quadriplegic and a lifelong sufferer from cerebral palsy owing to complications at birth. As a result, he did not take part in the race after PacWest Racing withdrew his entry as a mark of respect. He qualified on pole position for the Grand Prix of Cleveland later in the season. At the end of 2001, Gugelmin decided to retire from the sport, stating &quot;I definitely want to spend more time with my family. After those two big accidents, and Alex [Zanardi]&#x27;s deal in Germany, I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s it. Forget it.&#x27; &quot;

=== After Champ Car ===
In 2003 Gugelmin was announced as a competitor by the organizers of the new Renault Megane Super Cup in his native Brazil. However, the series did not launch and since then Gugelmin has made no competitive appearances in motorsport. Following his retirement, Gugelmin put his Florida mansion in Coral Gables up for sale for $17 million, and moved back to live in Brazil full-time. He runs the family business along with his brother, Alceu, and has also done consultancy work for Mercedes-Benz subsidiary AMG. Both his surviving sons compete in go-kart events.

<text>Mauro Giuseppe Baldi (born 31 January 1954) is an Italian former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . In endurance racing, Baldi won the World Sportscar Championship in 1990 with Sauber, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Porsche; he won the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1998 and is a two-time winner of the 24 Hours of Daytona with Doran.

Baldi is one of 11 drivers to complete the informal Triple Crown of endurance racing, achieving the feat at the 1998 12 Hours of Sebring.

==Biography==
Mauro Giuseppe Baldi was born on 31 January 1954 in Reggio Emilia, Emilia-Romagna.

Baldi started his career in rallying in 1972 and turned to circuit racing in 1975 with the Italian Renault 5 Cup. By 1980 he had become a top Formula 3 driver, winning the Monaco F3 Grand Prix and the 1981 European Formula 3 Championship with eight victories. In 1982 he signed to drive for Arrows before moving to Alfa Romeo in 1983, scoring a fifth place in Zandvoort. When Benetton became Alfa Romeo&#x27;s team sponsor in 1984, Baldi lost his drive, and joined the underfunded Spirit team until 1985.

After retiring from Formula One he went to enjoy a successful career in sports car racing, driving for the works Martini-Lancia team in 1984 and 1985. In 1986, he switched to a Porsche 956 from Richard Lloyd Racing&#x27;s outfit, returning to a works drive in 1988 with the Sauber-Mercedes team, with whom Baldi won the 1990 FIA World Sports Prototype Championship for Drivers, sharing the car with Jean-Louis Schlesser. In 1991 and 1992 he was a driver for Peugeot. 

He came very close to making a return to F1 in 1989, when he agreed with Coloni to take over one of the team&#x27;s cars from Enrico Bertaggia for the Italian Grand Prix. The move was blocked by Jochen Neerpasch, the sporting director of Mercedes, his then sportscar team. Later he had a brief return to F1 in 1990, doing most of the test driving for the Modena Lambo project.

Returning to sports cars, he won the Le Mans 24 Hours race in 1994, sharing the Dauer 962 Le Mans (a modified Porsche 962) with Yannick Dalmas and Hurley Haywood. He also won the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1998 and 2002, and the 12 Hours of Sebring, again in 1998, with Arie Luyendyk and Didier Theys.

<text>Michael Simon Brindley Bream Beuttler (13 April 1940 – 29 December 1988) was a British Formula One driver who raced privately entered March cars. He was born in Cairo, Egypt, the son of Colonel Leslie Brindley Bream Beuttler, Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment, O.B.E., and a descendant on his mother&#x27;s side of the Scottish ornithologist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant, grandson of the 6th Earl of Seafield.

He was a talented Formula Three driver from the late 1960s, who then graduated to Formula Two and then to Formula One in 1971.

The finance for the team came from a group of stockbroker friends from whom the team took its name – at first &quot;Clarke-Mordaunt-Guthrie Racing&quot;, and in 1973 it became &quot;Clarke-Mordaunt-Guthrie-Durlacher Racing&quot;. This approach of funding the team earned his car the nickname of the &quot;Stockbroker Special&quot;.

He raced on one occasion, at the 1971 Canadian Grand Prix, for the works March team. Beuttler&#x27;s best result was a seventh place in the 1973 Spanish Grand Prix.

While Beuttler did not achieve a points-scoring finish during his career in Formula One, he did achieve six top-ten finishes in the 28 races in which he competed, results that would have delivered points by today&#x27;s championship regulations.

When his backers suffered amid the 1973 oil crisis, Beuttler retired from racing the following year, at the age of 34, after competing in the 1000 km of Brands Hatch.

==Personal life==
Beuttler is often described as the first openly gay Formula One driver, although former &quot;Autosport&quot; editor and friend Ian Phillips has described Beuttler as &quot;semi-closeted&quot;, adding &quot;I&#x27;m not sure anybody really knew. We all just kind of suspected it. Because people weren’t open about being gay in those days and he took this lovely girlfriend to all the races which I suspect was just to distract because people didn’t come out as being gay in those days.&quot; Beuttler remained the only known male LGBT+ driver to have raced at that level until 2024, when the German former Formula One driver Ralf Schumacher announced that he was in a same-sex relationship.

While little is known about Beuttler&#x27;s life after his career in motorsport, he eventually moved to the United States, where he died of complications resulting from AIDS in 1988, in Los Angeles, aged 48.

Beuttler was also the brother-in-law of politician Alan Clark, who had married Beuttler&#x27;s sister Jane.

<doc id="1226505" wikidata="Q173147" url="?curid=1226505" title="Mike Hailwood">
<text>Stanley Michael Bailey Hailwood (2 April 1940 – 23 March 1981) was a British racing driver and motorcycle road racer, who competed in Grand Prix motorcycle racing from to , and Formula One between and . Nicknamed &quot;The Bike&quot;, Hailwood was a nine-time Grand Prix motorcycle World Champion, with four titles in the premier 500cc class with MV Agusta, and won 76 motorcycle Grands Prix across 10 seasons.

Hailwood took 14 victories at the Isle of Man TT. After his motorcycle racing career concluded, he went on to compete in Formula One and other classes of car racing, becoming one of the few men to compete at Grand Prix level in both motorcycle and car racing. He returned to motorcycle racing at the age of 38, taking victory at the 1978 Isle of Man TT.

Hailwood died in 1981 following a road traffic collision in Warwickshire, England.

==Early life==
Hailwood was born at Langsmeade House, Great Milton in Oxfordshire, the only son and elder child of Stanley William Bailey Hailwood, a millionaire businessman and managing director of a motorcar sales company as well as successful motorcycle dealer. He had also raced, in the pre-World War II era. Hailwood had a comfortable upbringing; he learned to ride at a young age on a minibike as a small boy in a field near his home. He was educated at Purton Stoke Preparatory School, Kintbury, and Pangbourne Nautical College where he wore a RN cadet uniform, but left early and worked for a short time in the family business before his father sent him to work at Triumph motorcycles.

==Motorcycle racing career==
Hailwood saw his first race at age 10 with his father, and first spectated at the Isle of Man TT races in 1956.

He first raced on 22 April 1957, at Oulton Park, finishing in 11th place. In 1958 he won ACU Stars at 125 cc, 250 cc, and 350 cc classes, earning him the &quot;Pinhard Prize&quot;, an accolade awarded yearly to a young motorcyclist under 21, who is adjudged to have made the most meritorious achievement in motorcycle sport during the preceding year. He teamed with Dan Shorey to win the Thruxton 500 endurance race and finished in four classes of TT race with one podium.

 By 1961, Hailwood was racing for up-and-coming Japanese factory Honda. In June 1961, he became the first man in the history of the Isle of Man TT to win three races in one week when he won in the 125 cc, 250 cc and 500 cc categories. He lost the chance at winning a fourth race when his 350 AJS failed with a broken gudgeon pin whilst leading. Riding a four-stroke, four-cylinder 250 cc Honda, Hailwood won the 1961 250cc world championship.

In 1962, Hailwood signed with MV Agusta and went on to become the first rider to win four consecutive 500cc World Championships.

In February 1964 during preparations for the US Grand Prix, Hailwood set a new one-hour speed record on the MV 500 cc recording an average speed of on the oval-shaped, banked speed-bowl at the Daytona circuit. The previous record of was set by Bob McIntyre on a 350 cc Gilera at Monza in 1957. Hailwood then went on to win the GP race, which carried World Championship points, in the afternoon of the same day.

During 1965, Hailwood entered selected UK events riding for the Tom Kirby Team. In heavy rain, Hailwood won the 1965 Hutchinson 100 Production race at the Silverstone circuit on a BSA Lightning Clubman entered by dealer Tom Kirby, beating the Triumph Bonnevilles entered by Syd Lawton. The &#x27;Hutch&#x27; was a main production race of the season along with the Thruxton 500, so it was very important for manufacturers to establish the racing potential of their recent models. As this was production-based racing open to all entrants, &#x27;official&#x27; works teams were ineligible; instead, machines were prepared and entered through well-established factory dealers. BSA Lightning Clubmans were ridden by Hailwood (carrying number 1 on the fairing) and factory rider Tony Smith, whilst Triumph Bonnevilles were ridden by World Champion Phil Read and works employee Percy Tait. Conditions were poor and Smith retired from the race at slippery Stowe Corner. Hailwood lapped at to establish his winning lead.

After his successes with MV Agusta, Hailwood went back to Honda and won four more world titles in 1966 and 1967 in the 250 cc and 350 cc categories. At the &#x27;Motor Cycle&#x27; 500 race at Brands Hatch in 1966, Hailwood demonstrated a Honda CB450 Black Bomber fitted with a sports fairing. It was unable to compete in the 500cc category, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) deeming that it was not classified as a production machine as it had two overhead camshafts.

Hailwood enjoyed great success at the Isle of Man TT. By 1967, he had won 12 times on the island mountain course. He won what many historians consider to be the most dramatic Isle of Man race of all time, the 1967 Senior TT against his great rival, Giacomo Agostini. In that race he set a lap record of on the Honda RC181, that stood for the next eight years.

After suffering breakdowns in 1967, Hailwood had intended to re-sign for Honda provided the 1968 machinery was to his satisfaction, and had relocated to South Africa where he started a building business with former motorcycle Grand Prix rider Frank Perris, completing their first house in October 1967, also selling one to ex-racer Jim Redman. Hailwood stated to &quot;Motorcycle Mechanics&quot; that even without suitable machinery from Honda he would not go elsewhere, preferring to retire prematurely and he would in any case finish at the end of the 1968 season.

For 1968, Honda pulled out of Grand Prix racing, but paid Hailwood £50,000 (equivalent to over £870,000 at 2020 value) not to ride for another team, in expectation of keeping him as its rider upon return to competition.

Hailwood continued to ride Hondas during 1968 and 1969 in selected race meetings without World Championship status including European events in the &quot;Temporada Romagnola&quot; (&quot;Adriatic Season&quot; of street-circuits), sometimes wearing an unfamiliar plain-silver helmet, including on a 500 cc engined machine which used frames privately commissioned by Hailwood.

Hailwood also appeared in selected UK events, in 1968 appearing in the post-TT race at Mallory Park on a Honda, and in 1969 he participated in the Mallory Park Race of the Year riding a Seeley

He had already started to race cars and with no other factory racing teams available to compete against MV Agusta, Hailwood decided to pursue a career in car racing, placing third in the 1969 Le Mans 24-Hour race in France as a co-driver of a Ford GT40 with David Hobbs.
In 1970, Hailwood was again lured back into bike racing, this time by the BSA team riding a Rocket 3 at the Daytona 200 race in Florida, part of a strong BSA/Triumph team. Whilst placed at the head of the field the machine soon failed due to overheating. Hailwood again rode for BSA at the 1971 Daytona race, qualifying on the front row. He led the race but again broke down. Hailwood&#x27;s son David completed a demonstration lap of the Isle of Man TT course on 3 June 2002, riding his father&#x27;s Daytona 1971 BSA Rocket 3 carrying large letters &#x27;H&#x27; instead of a race number. He crashed at low speed when waving to the spectators at Governor&#x27;s Bridge, a tight hairpin bend close to the end of the 37-mile course.

==Car racing career==
During his car racing career, Hailwood raced in Formula One and World Sports Cars, but never achieved the same level of success that he had found on motorcycles. He participated in 50 Formula One Grands Prix, starting with an early phase between 1963 and 1965, debuting in the British Grand Prix on 20 July 1963, achieving two podium finishes and scoring a total of 29 championship points.

Hailwood entered the 1966 24 Hours of Daytona as co-driver to Innes Ireland using a Ferrari, but Ireland broke down with gearbox problems after hours, before Hailwood was scheduled to participate.

Hailwood was in contention for a victory at his first Formula One race in six years, the 1971 Italian Grand Prix. The first five finishers were covered by only 0.61 seconds, and Hailwood was fourth, 0.18s behind the winner Peter Gethin. He won the Formula Two European title and earned a podium finish at the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans. Hailwood ran three full seasons in the European Shellsport F5000 series 1969-71 and was 2nd in the 1972 Tasman F5000 series in which he drove a 5000 engined TS8 F1 chassis.
Hailwood was recognised for his bravery when in the 1973 South African Grand Prix he went to pull Clay Regazzoni from his burning car after the two collided on the third lap of the race. Hailwood&#x27;s driving suit caught fire, but after being extinguished by a fire marshal he returned to help rescue Regazzoni, an act for which he was awarded the George Medal, the second-highest gallantry award that a British civilian can be awarded.

In 1974 he drove a works Yardley-sponsored McLaren M23 and sometimes outpaced team leader Emerson Fittipaldi. He left Formula One after being injured badly at the 1974 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring and retired to New Zealand, where he was involved with a marine engineering business together with former McLaren manager Phil Kerr.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1975 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

==Comeback==
In 1977, Hailwood had travelled to Australia to ride large-capacity Ducatis in long-distance races and a 30-lap event on a Yamaha, together with historic race machines. Achieving some success, he entered a 3-hour long-distance event in April 1978, as before with Australian co-rider Jim Scaysbrook. Also in April, Hailwood rode at the Australian motorcycle Grand Prix, for the first time on a 750 Yamaha that he was later to ride in the Classic TT race.

In May 1978, Hailwood rode a demonstration to spectators at a Donington Park national motorcycle race day of the Yamaha XS1100 with full fairing in Martini colours, which he was to use to re-acquaint himself with the TT course, including any subsequent alterations since he raced at the Isle of Man in the late 1960s. Martini was to sponsor most of his TT race machines provided by the UK Yamaha importer Mitsui. He stayed on for the following Monday to test his Yamaha TZ750, TZ500 and TZ250 race machines together with his F1 TT Ducati which he had previously tested in the rain at Oulton Park.

On 3 June 1978, after an 11-year hiatus from mainstream motorcycling, Hailwood made a comeback at the Isle of Man TT in the Formula I race, a World Championship class based on large-capacity road machines first introduced for 1977.

Few observers believed that the 38-year-old would be competitive at the TT races after such a long absence, but riding a Ducati 900SS provided by Manchester (UK) dealership &quot;Sports Motorcycles&quot;, he won the F1 race. Machines for other race categories were provided by Yamaha NV (Netherlands); Hailwood finished 12th in the 250 cc Junior event, 28th in the 500 cc Senior race being affected by a faulty steering damper, and a DNF in the Classic (1000 cc) race.

Hailwood was awarded &#x27;Man of the Year&#x27; for 1978 after a public vote organised by &quot;Motorcycle News&quot; weekly newspaper. After the June 1978 TT races, he again rode in Australia with Scaysbrook in the Castrol Six Hour event, followed by the 1979 Adelaide Three Hour race.

Hailwood raced at the 1979 Isle of Man TT before retiring for good at the age of 39. In that final Isle of Man appearance, he rode a two-stroke Suzuki RG 500 to victory in the Senior TT. He then opted to use that same 500 cc bike in the Unlimited Classic and diced for the lead with Alex George (1100cc Honda) for all six laps. A minute or two apart on the road, they were rarely a few seconds apart on time each lap, Hailwood losing by two seconds.

==Death==

Following his retirement from motor sport, in late 1979 Hailwood established a Honda-based retail motorcycle dealership in Birmingham named &quot;Hailwood and Gould&quot;, in partnership with former motorcycle racer Rodney Gould.

On Saturday 21 March 1981, Hailwood set off in his Rover SD1 with his children Michelle and David to collect some fish and chips. As they returned along the A435 Alcester Road through Portway, Warwickshire, near their home in Tanworth-in-Arden, a lorry made an illegal turn through the barriers onto the central reservation, and their car collided with it. Michelle, aged nine, was killed instantly. Mike and David were taken to hospital, where Mike died two days later from severe internal injuries. He was 40 years old. David survived with minor injuries. The lorry driver was fined £100.

Hailwood claimed to have been told by a fortune teller in South Africa that he would not live to 40 and would be killed by a truck. The story was repeated by Elizabeth McCarthy in a 1981 memoir, while recounting her relationship with Hailwood, whom she had met at the Canadian Grand Prix in 1967. When he asked for her hand in marriage, she replied that she was hesitant to marry someone who could die at any weekend race. He then told her his story and said; &quot;...I will be killed by one of those damn lorries – so, you see, it won&#x27;t happen on a track&quot;.

==Legacy==

An annual &#x27;Mike Hailwood Memorial Run&#x27; was discontinued after the 2011 event. The starting point was the former Norton factory in Aston, Birmingham, then on to Portway, where the accident occurred, followed by a service at the church in Tanworth-in-Arden.

Hailwood retired with 76 Grand Prix victories, 112 Grand Prix podiums, 14 Isle of Man TT wins and 9 World Championships, including 37 Grand Prix wins, 48 Grand Prix podiums, 6 Isle of Man TT wins and 4 World Championships in 500cc.

He was awarded the Segrave Trophy for 1979 &quot;in recognition of his Isle of Man exploits in the Senior and Classic TTs&quot;, with his close friend &quot;Ted Macauley&quot; also awarded a special &quot;Seagrave Medal&quot;. Hailwood was the Patron of a small charity – &quot;The Joan Seeley Pain Relief Memorial Trust&quot; – named in tribute to Colin Seeley&#x27;s first wife Joan, who died in 1979.

The FIM named him a Grand Prix &quot;Legend&quot; in 2000. He was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2000 and the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2001.

After Hailwood&#x27;s victory at the 1978 Isle of Man Formula One motorcycle race, Ducati offered a 900SS-based Mike Hailwood Replica for sale. Approximately 7,000 were sold.

In 1981, a section of the Snaefell Mountain Course was named as Hailwood&#x27;s Rise leading to the highest point at Hailwood&#x27;s Height in his honour. In 1984, Pauline Hailwood officially opened the Mike Hailwood Centre, a multi-purpose building located at the TT Grandstand in Douglas run as a refreshment outlet during TT and Manx Grand Prix motorcycle race periods. Operated by the &quot;Mike Hailwood Foundation&quot;, an Isle of Man-based charity, it is staffed by volunteers and also promotes the races together with supporting new competitors. 
==Personal life==
Coming from a prosperous background, during his early career Hailwood had enjoyed a privileged lifestyle and even before his move from MV to Honda in 1966 was the world&#x27;s highest-paid rider. He lived a playboy lifestyle as a jet-setter covering 30,000 road miles and 160,000 air miles in a year travelling to circuits around the world whilst based in his bachelor-flat at Heston, West London, where he kept his high-powered sports cars.

In 1964, together with British commentator and journalist Murray Walker, he published a book, &quot;The Art of Motorcycle Racing&quot;. After relocating to South Africa in 1967, he confirmed to &quot;Motorcycle Mechanics&quot; in 1968 that he would only be spending the same length of time there as in the previous eight years when he spent two winter months staying at the farm of racer Paddy Driver near Johannesburg. Hailwood also stated &quot;And as far as marriage goes—that&#x27;s strictly for the birds!&quot;

He had two children: daughter Michelle in 1971 and son David. He married their mother, model Pauline, on 11 June 1975. Pauline Hailwood died in June 2020 following an illness.

<text>Michael Henderson Spence (30 December 1936 – 7 May 1968) was a British racing driver from Surrey in England. He participated in 37 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 8 September 1963. He achieved one podium, and scored a total of 27 championship points. He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races, as well as sports car racing.

==Early career==
Spence was born in Purley, Surrey, and began his motorsport career driving his father&#x27;s Turner and an AC Ace sports car. Spence moved into open-wheel racing in Formula Junior in 1960. Spence drove the Emeryson in two non-Championship Formula One races in , the Solitude Grand Prix near Stuttgart and the Lewis-Evans Trophy at Brands Hatch. He retired early from the Solitude race with a gearbox failure, but finished second behind Tony Marsh&#x27;s BRM in the Lewis-Evans Trophy. These results prompted moves to the privateer Ian Walker Racing FJ team for 1962, driving a Lotus 22, and then to the works Lotus Formula Junior squad in 1963.

Despite disappointing results in his first Formula Junior season with a major team, with fourth place in the British Grand Prix FJ support race his best result, towards the end of Spence was called up to the Lotus Formula One team, taking the place of the injured Trevor Taylor at the Italian Grand Prix. Driving the Lotus 25, Spence qualified ninth and was classified 13th in the race despite the car&#x27;s oil pressure fading near the end, while team-mate Jim Clark took the win and with it the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

==Formula One==
With Lotus signing Peter Arundell as Clark&#x27;s team-mate for , Spence spent most of the early season driving in Formula Two events. However, shortly before the British Grand Prix, Arundell suffered a severe accident in an F2 race at Reims-Gueux, and Spence was called up to replace him in the F1 team for the rest of the season. Driving both the Lotus 25 and the Lotus 33, Spence managed points finishes in two World Championship races, sixth in Italy and fourth at the season finale in Mexico. This gave him four points, placing him equal 12th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Staying with Lotus for , Spence finished fourth in the season opener in South Africa, then won the prestigious Race of Champions at Brands Hatch and finished third in the International Trophy at Silverstone. But over the rest of the Championship, while Clark won his second Drivers&#x27; title with ease, Spence could only record two more points finishes, coming fourth again in Britain and third in the season finale in Mexico, behind American duo Richie Ginther and Dan Gurney, in what would turn out to be his only podium finish in a Championship race. With ten points, he was eighth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

The season began with victory in another non-Championship race, in South Africa. However, Lotus boss Colin Chapman then took back the recovered Arundell, leaving Spence out of a drive. Before the Championship began in May at Monaco, Spence signed for the privateer Reg Parnell Racing team, but the BRM-powered Lotus 25 he drove was elderly and unreliable and he finished only twice, in the Netherlands and Italy, although he was fifth on both occasions. The four points thus earned placed him 13th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

At the end of 1966, Graham Hill left the works BRM team to join Lotus, and Spence was chosen as his replacement. Driving the BRM P83 over the course of the Championship, Spence achieved points finishes in five races, though these consisted of four fifths and a sixth. He thus finished tenth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with nine points. Continuing with BRM at the start of , Spence drove the P115 in the season opener in South Africa and the P126 in the Race of Champions and the International Trophy; he retired from all three races but performed strongly in the latter two, hinting at a great potential for the rest of the season.

==Sports car racing==

In 1967, Jim Hall hired Spence as part of his Chaparral sports car team. One of the most innovative engineers in 1960s motorsport, Hall pioneered many advances in racing technology. For 1967 the great advance was the addition of aerodynamic wings to the rear of his cars, generating extra downforce to improve grip levels and hence cornering speeds. Driving the Chaparral 2F with regular partner Phil Hill, Spence managed to make a great impression on the sports car scene. Fastest laps in the 12 Hours of Sebring and 1000km Spa races were just the prelude to a dominant win in the 1967 BOAC 500 race at Brands Hatch. Spence and Hill finished half a lap ahead of the Jackie Stewart/Chris Amon Ferrari 330P, who were themselves three laps ahead of everybody else.

For 1968 Spence moved to the Ford-backed Alan Mann Racing team. He became one of the few people ever to drive the ill-fated Ford P68 in competition, although an engine mount failure on his own entry, followed by a driveshaft failure on the team&#x27;s second car during the race, prevented Spence from reaching the chequered flag.

==Death==

Following Clark&#x27;s death at Hockenheim in early April 1968, Colin Chapman invited Spence back to Lotus as part of their Indianapolis 500 team, with the race in late May. Spence was due to race the revolutionary Lotus 56 gas turbine car. During practice at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Tuesday, 7 May, Spence, driving the #60 Lotus 56 turbocar (later qualified and driven by Joe Leonard), ran a lap of – fastest of the month and second-fastest in track history.

Later in the afternoon, Colin Chapman was asked by Andy Granatelli if Spence could take out turbocar #30 for a test run after driver Greg Weld had difficulty getting the car up to speed. Spence quickly got the car to a lap of , but early in the second lap, he misjudged his entry to turn one and collided heavily with the concrete wall. The right-front wheel of the Lotus swiveled backwards into the cockpit and struck Spence on the helmet; he died in the hospital later that evening at 9:45 pm from massive head injuries. His fastest lap speed set earlier that day was unsurpassed for the next five practice days.

<doc id="1226508" wikidata="Q432856" url="?curid=1226508" title="Saul Steinberg">
<text>Saul Steinberg (June 15, 1914, Rm. Sărat, Romania – May 12, 1999, New York City) was a Romanian-born American artist, best known for his work for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, most notably &quot;View of the World from 9th Avenue&quot;. He described himself as &quot;a writer who draws&quot;.

==Biography==
Steinberg was born in Râmnicu Sărat, Buzău County, Romania to a family of Jewish descent. In 1932, he entered the University of Bucharest. In 1933, he enrolled at the Polytechnic University of Milan to study architecture; he received his degree in 1940. In 1936, he began contributing cartoons to the humor newspaper Bertoldo. Two years later, the anti-Semitic racial laws promulgated by the Fascist government forced him to start seeking refuge in another country.

In 1941, he fled to the Dominican Republic, where he spent a year awaiting a US visa. By then, his drawings had appeared in several US periodicals; his first contribution to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was published in October 1941. Steinberg arrived in New York City in July 1942; within a few months he received a commission in the US Naval Reserve and was then seconded to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). He worked for the Morale Operations division in China, North Africa, and Italy. Shipped back to Washington in 1944, he married the Romanian-born painter Hedda Sterne.

After World War II, Steinberg continued to publish drawings in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and other periodicals, including &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. At the same time, he embarked on an exhibition career in galleries and museums. In 1946, he was included in the critically acclaimed &quot;Fourteen Americans&quot; show at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, exhibiting along with Arshile Gorky, Isamu Noguchi, and Robert Motherwell, among others. Steinberg went on to have more than 80 one-artist shows in galleries and museums throughout the US, Europe, and South America. He was affiliated with the Betty Parsons and Sidney Janis galleries in New York and the Galerie Maeght in Paris. A dozen museums and institutions have in-depth collections of his work, and examples are included in the holdings of more than eighty other public collections.
He and Sterne separated in 1960, but remained close friends. However, toward the end of Sterne&#x27;s life, she called their marriage license “the first of Saul’s phony documents, maybe.”

Steinberg&#x27;s long, multifaceted career encompassed works in many media and appeared in different contexts. In addition to magazine publications and gallery art, he produced advertising art, photoworks, textiles, stage sets, and murals. Given this many-leveled output, his work is difficult to position within the canons of postwar art history. He himself defined the problem: &quot;I don&#x27;t quite belong to the art, cartoon or magazine world, so the art world doesn&#x27;t quite know where to place me.&quot;

He is best described as a &quot;modernist without portfolio, constantly crossing boundaries into uncharted visual territory. In subject matter and styles, he made no distinction between high and low art, which he freely conflated in an oeuvre that is stylistically diverse yet consistent in depth and visual imagination.&quot;

After Steinberg&#x27;s death on May 12, 1999, The Saul Steinberg Foundation was established in accordance with the artist&#x27;s will. The Foundation&#x27;s mission is &quot;to facilitate the study and appreciation of Saul Steinberg&#x27;s contribution to 20th-century art&quot; and to &quot;serve as a resource for the international curatorial-scholarly community as well as the general public&quot;.

<doc id="1226510" wikidata="Q172970" url="?curid=1226510" title="Nicola Larini">
<text>Nicola Larini (born 19 March 1964) is an Italian former racing driver, who competed in Formula One between and . In touring car racing, Larini won the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft in 1993 and the Italian Superturismo Championship in 1992, both with Alfa Romeo.

Larini participated in 75 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting at the 1987 Italian Grand Prix. He finished second in the tragic 1994 San Marino Grand Prix as a substitute for Ferrari, but only scored points once more in his career. He enjoyed greater success in touring car racing, primarily for Alfa Romeo.

==Early career==
Born in Lido di Camaiore, Tuscany, Larini began car racing in Formula Italia in 1983, then moved up to Formula Abarth in 1984, placing third overall. He also started in Italian Formula Three the same season. In 1986 he won the title for Coloni in a Dallara, and briefly drove for the same team in Formula 3000 the following year.

==Formula One==
Larini&#x27;s rapid ascendancy in motorsport continued when Coloni entered the final two European rounds of the 1987 Formula One season. Larini failed to qualify for the Italian Grand Prix, but got into the Spanish Grand Prix, only to retire early on.

For the 1988 season he was signed by the Osella Formula One team, and drew good notices for his valiant performances in the hugely uncompetitive car, with a best result of 9th in the Monaco Grand Prix. He would continue with Osella in the 1989 season, their much-improved car suffering from the lottery of pre-qualifying. However, Larini continued to shine, running 6th at the San Marino Grand Prix until a hub failure, and running third at the Canadian Grand Prix until an electrical failure. He would also qualify 10th for the Japanese Grand Prix.

The 1990 Formula One season saw a move up the grid to the Ligier team, but the well-funded French team were at a creative dead-end and the car was a distinct midfielder. A brace of seventh places were Larini&#x27;s best results in a low-key year, although he easily outshone Philippe Alliot in the other Ligier.

Larini then moved to the new Modena team for the 1991 season, once again having to face pre-qualifying. He got through in the opening round, the United States Grand Prix, and held on for seventh place, but the team would develop acute financial difficulties, and were unable to progress. As a result, Larini would only qualify for four more races.

For the 1992 season, he was out of luck for a Grand Prix drive, but was signed by Ferrari to develop their active suspension system. Larini kept his racing instincts sharp by winning the Italian Touring Car Championship for Alfa Romeo, and was called up to the Ferrari Formula One team for the end of the year, replacing Ivan Capelli to race-test the active suspension car. He made a fair impression, but started both races from the back of the grid for technical reasons. However, 1993 saw more Ferrari testing and touring cars, this time taking the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft title in Germany for Alfa Romeo.

In 1994, he would have another chance with Ferrari in Formula One, replacing the injured Jean Alesi early in the season. He qualified seventh at the Pacific Grand Prix, but along with Ayrton Senna was eliminated at the first corner by Mika Häkkinen. Then at the San Marino Grand Prix he took second place, but his first points score was overshadowed by the tragic deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna. It was back to touring cars with Alfa for the rest of the year, with Larini placing third in the German series.

Alfa would drop off the pace for the next two years, with Larini placing sixth in the German series in 1995, and 11th in the ITC in 1996. However, 1997 would see his Ferrari connections land him a seat with Sauber, who were using rebranded Ferrari engines. Larini scored a point on his return at the Australian Grand Prix, but left after five races after a series of disagreements with Peter Sauber.

==Later career==

After that, Larini was a stalwart in touring cars, for Alfa Romeo for many years in the European Touring Car Championship, and between 2005 and 2009 for Chevrolet in the WTCC (World Touring Car Championship). On November 21, 2009, he announced that he would quit his professional racing driver career, but would not stop racing completely. For example, in 2016 he won Race 1 in Imola at the European Lotus Cup, in 2017, made his NASCAR Whelen Euro Series debut at Autodromo di Franciacorta, driving the No. 1 Ford Mustang for Alex Caffi Motorsport.

==Championships==

* 1992 – Italiano Superturismo Champion – Alfa Romeo 155 GTA turbo
* 1993 – DTM Champion – Alfa Romeo 155 V6 2.5 TI DTM

<doc id="1226512" wikidata="Q173307" url="?curid=1226512" title="Olivier Grouillard">
<text>Olivier Grouillard (born 2 September 1958) is a racing driver from France. He started racing go-karts from the age of fourteen competing in events such as the Volant Elf. He progressed to Formula Renault winning the title before Grouillard competed in F3000 from 1985 to 1988 taking two wins. He also participated in the Birmingham Superprix but did not start the race.

In 1989, Grouillard joined the Ligier Formula One team before joining the Osella team for 1990 and 1991 when the team was renamed Fondmetal. His last season came in 1992, when Grouillard drove for Tyrrell. He left the sport following the year without receiving offers for a drive in 1993. After leaving Formula One, Grouillard raced in the CART PPG World Series, competing in the Indianapolis 500 for which he did not qualify but showed consistency. Grouillard became well known for driving in Sports Cars between 1994 and 2001 having success. During his time in Sports Cars, he raced in the BPR Global GT Series, the FIA GT Championship, the Daytona 24 Hours, the Le Mans 24 Hours and the American Le Mans Series. He retired from motorsport at the end of 2001.

==Career==

===Before Formula One===
Grouillard was born, in Fenouillet. He started racing karts from the age of 14 and competed in the Volant Elf in 1981 and progressed to Formula Renault in 1982 and took the title. In 1983, Grouillard went into French F3 and drove for the ORECA team racing a Martini Mk39 Alfa Romeo to finish 4th scoring 33 points. Driving a Martini Mk42 in 1984 brought him the title and scored 108 points. For 1985, Grouillard competed in the inaugural season of F3000 spending the year mostly confined to qualifying in the midfield but delivered good races along with reliability. In 1986, he left ORECA to join Formula Team Ltd driving a Lola T86/50 Cosworth. At Mugello, Grouillard finished 4th despite taking an early lead. At the Osterrichring he took 6th and overall scored 4 points despite limited participation as the team was short on funding. Grouillard returned to ORECA for 1987 in a March 87B Cosworth. His performances dropped despite having impressive qualifying record throughout the season. For 1988, Grouillard moved to the GBDA Motorsport driving a Lola T88/50 Cosworth. He once again showed potential during qualifying and was regularly scoring points along with wins. Grouillard was slightly injured in a crash during the 1988 Birmingham Superprix sustaining bruised ankles although observers initially thought that Grouillard had broken both his legs. Grouillard was able to start the race but had to run to the pit lane for the spare car after his car suffered a failure with the engine. Grouillard however, did not start the race.

Olivier also raced a series of works and semi-works BMW M3&#x27;s for BMW in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship and the 1988 European Touring Car Championships

===Formula One===

====1989====
Grouillard joined Ligier to fill in the seat left by Stefan Johansson and was the team-mate to René Arnoux for 1989. He qualified 22nd in his first race in Brazil and finished 9th. At Imola, he overcame spinning his car to start in 10th, but was disqualified when mechanics worked on his car during a red flag stint, caused by the accident of Gerhard Berger at Tamburello. He started outside the top 10 at Monaco and Mexico, finishing 8th in the latter but was unable to qualify in Phoenix and Montréal. He started from 17th at his home race at the French Grand Prix and drove to 6th, despite having issues with the tyres and gearbox, scoring his only World Championship point. For the last six races, Grouillard failed to qualify higher than 20th and did not qualify in Portugal. In qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa, Grouillard impeded the Lotus of Nelson Piquet by staying on the racing line whilst the Brazilian was on his last flying lap. On the dirty line, Piquet spun off and shook his fist at Grouillard as he passed by. This cost the triple World Champion his chances in qualifying and the race, and it was to be the first of such incidents involving Grouillard&#x27;s misuse of his mirrors. At Adelaide, he spun which followed a heavy crash in the rain. In fact, for the season ending Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, he kept the Ligier mechanics busy by spinning off and hitting the concrete walls twice during practice and qualifying as well as in the race morning warm up session (which was wet) and the race.

During his last 2–3 seasons in Formula One, René Arnoux had gained the reputation of being a blocker, a driver who rarely used his mirrors and regularly held up others both in qualifying and races. Unfortunately this trait seemed to have been passed on to Grouillard who was fast gaining his own reputation of being a blocker.

====1990====
Grouillard joined the Italian Osella team, taking the seat of Nicola Larini, who in return took Grouillard&#x27;s seat at Ligier. He was not partnered for 1990 as the financially struggling Osella scaled back their operations, meaning Grouillard had to pre-qualify for the races. He managed to qualify in 8th in Phoenix ahead of Nigel Mansell and Alessandro Nannini which amazed many people in Formula One. During the race, Grouillard was hit by Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Williams at the second corner and eventually retired after a second collision with the Swiss driver Gregor Foitek. At Brazil, he retired after another collision involving Michele Alboreto. For Imola the car was upgraded, but that did not help the team as Grouillard retired (not before blocking Mansell in qualifying and ruining the Ferrari&#x27;s qualifying run, earning the Frenchman a fist wave from Mansell, and not for the last time). He also failed to qualify at Monaco. Two consecutive finishes outside the top 10 at Canada and Mexico were followed up with a poor run in pre-qualifying for France, ending up not qualifying for the race and at Silverstone and Hockenheim, where he also failed to qualify along with another failure to pre-qualify at Hungary. Grouillard finished 16th at Spa with retirements at Monza and Jerez with wheel bearing problems that plagued the Frenchman throughout the year.

At the season ending Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, Grouillard finished 13th and again held up Nigel Mansell during the race which led to the British driver shaking his fist at the Frenchman in front of the on-board camera.

====1991====
Grouillard remained with Osella, which had been bought out and renamed to Fondmetal. The team had to race with the car used for the two previous years, which led to Grouillard not being able to get past pre-qualifying at Phoenix and Interlagos. A new car was built, but this did not change Grouillard&#x27;s season, as he had further three failures to pre-qualify. A change of fortune did come at Mexico, where he qualified his season-best 10th, but was forced to start from the pit lane after suffering from mechanical problems in the car, and he eventually succumbed to an engine failure after 14 laps. He retired in his home race at France with an oil leak, and had further failures to pre-qualify at Silverstone and Hockenheim. In Hungary, Grouillard managed to get into the main qualifying event, but eventually failed to qualify. At Spa-Francorchamps, he finished a lap down in 10th and retired from an engine failure at Monza with just 7 laps to go. Grouillard failed to qualify in Portugal, and had to take a spare gearbox, with the old one failing to work. He refused to let the car use a new gearbox, and was sacked a few days later by team boss Gabriele Rumi. He managed to join AGS in the seat vacated by his replacement at Fondmetal, Gabriele Tarquini, for the next race at Catalunya. For the race, Grouillard was the slowest in pre-qualifying behind new team-mate Fabrizio Barbazza, with the AGS team folding before the pair could get to Japan and Australia.

====1992====
Grouillard was taken on by Ken Tyrrell to drive the Ilmor-powered Tyrrell 020B chassis and was partnered by Italian Andrea de Cesaris. He was learning from de Cesaris&#x27; experience, and often qualified in the midfield. His car had the share of mechanical problems, but managed to finish in San Marino, Canada, France and Britain. A collision with a wall in Spain, along with a collision with Karl Wendlinger&#x27;s March in Hungary, a spin on the opening lap at Spa, a collision with Pierluigi Martini&#x27;s Dallara in Adelaide had brought himself unrepentant about his manners whilst racing. He was eventually not wanted by other teams, and left Formula One at the end of the season. Grouillard and other French racing drivers lobbied for leading motorsport events, such as the French motorcycle Grand Prix to be saved, after they were put at risk by the new anti-tobacco laws in France brought in by health minister Claude Évin.

===CART===
Grouillard arranged to drive with the Indy Regency Team in a Lola T92/00 for 1993 in the CART PPG World Series following Nigel Mansell in the series. His first race was the Indianapolis 500, where he did not qualify. After the 500, Grouillard showed consistency and had a reliable car finishing in eight out of 11 events with only one mechanical retirement at Michigan and a collision with Arie Luyendyk at Vancouver. Overall, Grouillard finished 28th overall taking four points.

===Sports Car racing===

====1994–2001====

Unable to make a success in CART, he returned to Europe in 1994 and raced sports cars in the BPR Global GT series. He had previous experience in 1990 where he and co-drivers Martin Donnelly and Kenny Acheson qualified 5th at Le Mans but gearbox problems prevented the trio from starting. He came 16th in a Venturi 400 Trophy with Herve Pulain coming in 4th in GT5 class before driving five races in an Agusta Racing Team Venturi 600LM with Christophe Bouchut taking 2nd at Montlehry and 5th at Vallelunga and also raced at Le Mans in a Jacadi Racing Venturi 600Lm with Michel Ferté and Michel Neugarten with engine problems ending their race.

The Jacadi connection remained in 1995 with Grouillard joined by Fabien Giroix in a Giroix Racing Team Jacadi McLaren F1 GTR for 3 rounds in the BPR series with a 5th at Jarama and 2nd at the Nurburgring. The pair were joined by Jean-Denis Délétraz at Le Mans, where they finished 5th. Grouillard departed for Mach One Racing joining Andy Wallace winning all three rounds the new pairing entered. Grouillard scored 91 points and finished 14th overall. In the first qualifying race at Nogaro, Grouillard&#x27;s car suffered a faulty shock absorber.

He remained with Mach One, and Harrods came on board as sponsor. Retirements plagued the team for the first four rounds were remedied by victory at Silverstone and a 6th at Le Mans where they were joined by Derek Bell. Further finishes came at Anderstorp, Suzuka and Brands Hatch where he came 4th, 3rd and 2nd respectively. Grouillard failed to qualify at Spa in a Friesinger Motorsport Porsche 911 GT2 Evo shared with Wolfgang Kaufmann and at Nogaro driving a BBA Competition Mclaren F1 GTP with Jean-Luc Maury-Lariberre, he failed to finish. Grouillard finished 8th with 106 points. Throughout the season, he also competed in other events such as the Daytona 24 Hours with Derek Hill and Gildo Pastor Pallanca with a transmission problem forcing the trio out.

Grouillard entered the FIA GT Championship in 1997 in a Dave Price Racing Panoz GTP Ford, teamed up with David Brabham and Perry McCarthy and also competed in Japanese GT finishing 2nd at Suzuka in a Toyota Supra with Masami Kageyama. For that year&#x27;s Le Mans race, Grouillard drove in a Courage Compétition C36 Porsche with Mario Andretti and his son Michael, but retired after fifteen and a half hours.

He returned to the race in 1998, driving a La Filiere Courage C36 Porsche with Henri Pescarolo and Franck Montagny managing to finish 16th. Grouillard&#x27;s other entry was the International Sports Racing Series at Misano, but did not compete as his entrant failed to attend the race.

For 2000, Grouillard raced in the American Le Mans Series driving a Courage C52 Peugeot with Sébastien Bourdais coming 6th at Silverstone and entered the Nurburgring round but did not take part in practice. At Le Mans, he finished 4th.

In 2001, Grouillard looked to join Pescarolo Sport at Le Mans but was replaced by Boris Derichebourg ending Grouillard&#x27;s motorsport career.

<doc id="1226513" wikidata="Q82924" url="?curid=1226513" title="Pedro de la Rosa">
<text>Pedro Martínez de la Rosa (; born 24 February 1971) is a Spanish former racing driver, motorsport executive and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One between and . In Japanese motorsport, de la Rosa won the Formula Nippon Championship and the All-Japan GT Championship, both in 1997.

Born and raised in Barcelona, de la Rosa began his career in radio-controlled racing, winning several national and continental titles before moving into karting aged 17. He participated in 107 Grands Prix for the Arrows, Jaguar, McLaren, Sauber and HRT teams. He made his Formula One debut on 7 March 1999, becoming one of 79 drivers to score a point in his first race. He has scored a total of 35 championship points, which includes a podium finish at the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. He is the first Spanish racing driver to win a National Championship in Japan open-wheel racing history, won the Japanese Super Formula Championship (formerly Formula Nippon Championship) and the Super GT (formerly JGTC) in 1997.

Upon retiring from motor racing, de la Rosa became a commentator and pundit for La Sexta, Telecinco, Movistar and DAZN. He founded Drivex in 2005, and served as technical and sporting director of Techeetah in Formula E during the 2018–19 season, winning the Formula E Teams&#x27; Championship. He has also been an ambassador for Aston Martin since 2022.

==Early career==
De la Rosa was born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, and unlike most drivers, he started his career in radio-controlled cars, specialising in 1:8 off-road. He won three consecutive domestic championship titles between 1983 and 1985, he became the first multiple European radio controlled off-road championship twice in 1983 and 1984 and was runner up in the inaugural world championship in 1986. It was only after that when he started karting in a local Spanish championship in 1988 when he was 17. He then joined the Spanish Formula Fiat Uno and became champion in 1989.

==Professional career==
In 1990, De la Rosa raced in Spanish Formula Ford 1600 and became champion. He later drove in British Formula Ford 1600 and got two podiums out of six races. In 1991, De la Rosa achieved fourth place in the Spanish Formula Renault Championship with three podium finishes. In 1992 he was both European and British Formula Renault champion. He slipped down the order in the next two years. In 1995, he was champion of the Japanese Formula Three series and third in the Macau Grand Prix. In 1996, he finished 8th in both the Formula Nippon and All Japan GT Championship. The next year he was champion in Formula Nippon. He was also the All Japan GT Champion with Michael Krumm.

==Formula One (1999–2014)==

===Arrows (1999–2000)===

In , De la Rosa was a test driver for Jordan. The next year, he joined Arrows and scored one world championship point by finishing sixth in his debut race, the . He regularly out-paced his more experienced teammate Toranosuke Takagi. In 2000 he remained at Arrows alongside Dutchman Jos Verstappen. He scored two points, finishing sixth in the German Grand Prix and the European Grand Prix. Verstappen commented mid-season that he and De la Rosa &#x27;work well together and we have a good partnership&#x27;. During the 2000 season, the Arrows team took part in a 13-part TV series named &#x27;Racing Arrows&#x27; which followed the team and drivers throughout the year. It was shown on British TV channel ITV in 2001.

===Jaguar (2001–2002)===
He raced for two years with Jaguar Racing alongside Eddie Irvine, scoring 3 points in 2001 and none in 2002. At the end of the 2002 season Jaguar paid off his contract which was set to expire at the conclusion of 2003, replacing him with Antônio Pizzonia.

===McLaren (2003–2009)===
He became a test driver for McLaren but raced at the 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix when Juan Pablo Montoya injured his shoulder. He finished fifth and set a lap record which he still holds .

On 11 July 2006 it was announced that De la Rosa would take over the second McLaren race seat with immediate effect following Juan Pablo Montoya&#x27;s departure to NASCAR. It was initially unclear whether he would remain in the seat until the end of the season, but some successful results led to him being retained.

At the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix De la Rosa scored his first and only Formula One podium, finishing in second place behind Jenson Button.

After a long period of speculation as to who would be Fernando Alonso&#x27;s teammate in , Lewis Hamilton secured the seat. De la Rosa would carry on as the team&#x27;s test driver.

For the season he combined his testing duties with providing race commentary for Spanish broadcaster Telecinco. After his absence in 2006 he returned to the microphone in 2007.

Reports in 2007 consistently linked De la Rosa to a return to F1 racing with the new Prodrive team, which was set to make its debut in the season. Speculation suggested that Prodrive would run with support from the McLaren team, and that De la Rosa, along with fellow tester Gary Paffett, would race for them in their maiden season. However, the team failed to make the grid for the new season, and De la Rosa instead remained as a test driver for McLaren.

De la Rosa was also involved in the espionage controversy surrounding his team and rivals Ferrari. With evidence provided by him and teammate Fernando Alonso, the FIA excluded the team from the 2007 Constructors&#x27; Championship, and issued a record fine of $100 million. He was understood to have sent e-mails to Mike Coughlan and Fernando Alonso regarding the Ferrari cars&#x27; setup.

Before the Australian Grand Prix of 2008, De la Rosa was elected as the new chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association after a unanimous vote. De la Rosa was the preferred candidate for GPDA directors Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso. He replaced the retired Ralf Schumacher in the role. He remained at McLaren in 2009, and as of January 2010 was the fifth most experienced test driver in history, in terms of test days. He stated that he wished to step down from the role of GPDA chairman, following the completion of his deal to drive for Sauber in 2010, and was duly replaced in the role by Nick Heidfeld at the Australian Grand Prix.

===Sauber (2010–2011)===

In 2010 De la Rosa drove for the newly resurrected Sauber team. His teammate at Sauber was Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi who impressed at Toyota during the last two races of the 2009 Formula One season.

De la Rosa finished seven of the thirteen races he started in the season, and picked up six points from a single points-scoring finish, a seventh-place finish at the . These points would be the last of his Formula One career. De la Rosa qualified in the top ten on two occasions, at Silverstone and in Hungary as both he and teammate Kobayashi struggled with reliability problems for the majority of the season.

He was dropped from his race seat by Sauber in favour of Nick Heidfeld after the Italian Grand Prix. De la Rosa replaced Heidfeld as test driver for Pirelli, in anticipation for their return to Formula One for the season.

After Sergio Pérez&#x27;s accident in Monaco, De la Rosa replaced him for Sauber at the , after Pérez decided after the first free practice session on Friday, to sit out the rest of the weekend. De la Rosa managed to stay out of trouble throughout the first part of the race, affected by heavy rain, running as high as ninth before a red flag suspended the race. He eventually finished 12th after having some contact soon after the restart which required a new wing.

===McLaren (2011)===
On 9 March 2011, McLaren announced that De la Rosa had returned to the team as their test and reserve driver.

=== HRT (2012) ===
On 21 November 2011, it was announced that De la Rosa had signed for HRT F1 on a two-year contract. His teammate was Indian driver Narain Karthikeyan. Both drivers failed to qualify for the first race of the season in Australia, as De la Rosa was only able to complete seven timed laps during the race weekend. At the next race weekend in Malaysia, he was able to qualify and finish 22nd in the race after receiving a drive through penalty after the race was restarted, and he was later promoted to 21st place due to Karthikeyan&#x27;s 20-second penalty for an incident with Sebastian Vettel.

De la Rosa qualified ahead of Karthikeyan once again in China, and finished 21st, one lap down from the race winner. In Bahrain, he finished 20th after qualifying 22nd, although after the race he admitted that the team still needed &quot;to gain some speed per lap&quot; to fight their rivals on a consistent basis. Following on from this, De la Rosa finished his home race for the first time since 1999 in 19th place, the last of all classified drivers. However, he was unable to complete the Monaco Grand Prix due to a collision with Pastor Maldonado at the beginning of the race.

De la Rosa had a contract to compete in the 2013 season with HRT and was due to become team principal for 2014. The team folded at the end of the 2012 season, meaning de la Rosa was unable to take either position.
=== Ferrari (2013–2014) ===
On 16 January, Ferrari announced that De la Rosa had been signed in a developmental role for the team, aiding with its simulator resources.
On 24 January Ferrari announced that De la Rosa would share testing duties of their 2013 challenger, the F138, with Felipe Massa at the first test of the season, beginning on 5 February in Jerez.

== Other ventures ==
===Team management===
In 2005 de la Rosa founded feeder series outfit Drivex with Miguel Ángel de Castro. The team has been successful, with their biggest achievement being winning 2019 F4 Spanish Championship teams and drivers title with current Alpine Formula One reserve driver Franco Colapinto

De la Rosa served as the technical and sporting director of Techeetah in Formula E during the 2018–19 season.

De la Rosa also runs a driving school and racing team called Drivex.

In October 2022, De la Rosa was appointed ambassador for Aston Martin Formula One Team.

===Broadcasting===

De la Rosa has also worked as color analyst for Formula One broadcasts on La Sexta, Telecinco, Movistar and currently DAZN.

== Personal life ==
De la Rosa has one daughter. His nephew Bruno del Pino is also a racing driver, who previously drove for his Drivex team.

<text>Peter John Collins (6 November 1931 – 3 August 1958) was a British racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Collins won three Formula One Grands Prix across seven seasons. In endurance racing, Collins won the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1958 with Ferrari.

Born and raised in Kidderminster, Collins started his racing career aged 17 in a 500cc Cooper 500. The 500cc category became Formula Three in 1950, where he finished third in the 1951 Autosport National Formula 3 Championship. He then progressed to Formula Two with HWM in 1952, who promoted him to Formula One that season to replace Stirling Moss, making his debut at the . Collins made intermittent appearances over the next four seasons for HWM, Vanwall and Maserati; despite scoring no World Championship points, he took major wins at the 1953 RAC Tourist Trophy with Aston Martin and the non-championship 1955 BRDC International Trophy. Following his victory at the 1955 Targa Florio with Mercedes, Collins was signed by Ferrari in . He was immediately successful at Ferrari, taking his maiden wins at the Belgian and French Grands Prix amongst several podiums, and finishing third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. After a winless season, Collins died during the 1958 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, just weeks after winning the . He had achieved three wins and nine podiums—with four non-championship race wins—in Formula One.

Outside of Formula One, Collins was twice runner-up in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in and with Aston Martin, as well as in the 1956 Mille Miglia with Ferrari. In popular culture, Collins was portrayed by Jack O&#x27;Connell in the sports drama film &quot;Ferrari&quot; (2023).

==Early life and racing career==

Born on 6 November 1931, Collins grew up in Mustow Green, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, England. The son of a motor-garage owner and haulage merchant, Collins became interested in motor vehicles at a young age. He was expelled from school at 16 owing to spending time at a local fairground during school hours. He became an apprentice in his father&#x27;s garage and began competing in local trials races.

In common with many British drivers of the time, Collins began racing in the 500 cc category (adopted as Formula 3 at the end of 1950), when his parents bought him a Cooper 500 from the fledgling Cooper Car Company. Success for Collins started once he switched to the JBS-Norton in 1951. Those small vehicles, powered by Norton motorcycle engines, were also the proving ground of many of Collins&#x27;s F1 contemporaries, including Stirling Moss.

His breakthrough came, away from the track, when at a party hosted by the great pre-war lady racer, Kay Petre, Collins managed to inveigle himself with John Wyer, the team principal at Aston Martin, earning his test drive at Silverstone. During that test, Aston was joined by the Formula 2 team, HWM – and by the time the teams were preparing to leave, Collins had a contract with both.

At HWM Collins he became part of a three-car team with Lance Macklin and Moss, and they competed in most of the F2 races in Britain and in Europe. Collins showed in speed, but the underfinanced HWM-Alta rarely finished a race. His best result was second place in the Grand Prix des Sables d&#x27;Olonne. Collins got his Formula One break in 1952, with HWM when he replaced Moss. His best result in a World Championship event that year was sixth in the French Grand Prix at Rouen-Les-Essarts.

Success did not come the team&#x27;s way, and Collins left after the 1953 season. Not known for his technical knowledge, Collins was happy to have his mechanics set up his car, and he simply drove it with his consummate natural skill. This was evident in 1954, when Tony Vandervell signed Collins to drive the fearsome &quot;Thinwall Special&quot;. The potent machine was a crowd pleaser at Formula Libre events. He was also amongst the first to handle the &quot;Vanwall Special&quot; on the world stage, but he only finished seventh in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

After being a constant thorn in BRM&#x27;s side, he joined the team for the 1955 season. He raced a Maserati 250F belonging to team owner, Alfred Owen, winning the BRDC International Trophy and the London Trophy. These results led to a drive with the works Maserati in the Italian Grand Prix.

Meanwhile, he had better success in sportscars. Throughout the first half of the 1950s, Collins was a stalwart performer for the Aston Martin team, scoring a sensational victory at the 1952 Goodwood Nine Hours race. The following year he took the Aston Martin DB3S he shared with Pat Griffith to victory in the RAC Tourist Trophy at Dundrod. Further successes included second places in an Aston Martin DB3S at Le Mans in 1955 and 1956 with Paul Frère and Moss respectively.

==Later career==
For the 1956 season, Collins joined Ferrari on the strength of a superb drive in the previous year&#x27;s Targa Florio, in which he partnered Moss to victory in a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR. This proved to be a turning point, with a solid second-place finish behind Moss at the Monaco Grand Prix, and wins at the Belgian and French Grands Prix. In those early days at Ferrari, Collins earned the unstinting admiration of Enzo Ferrari, devastated by the untimely death from muscular dystrophy at age 24 of his son, Dino, and who turned to Collins for solace, treating him as a member of the family.

Collins was on the verge of becoming Britain&#x27;s first F1 World Champion when he handed his Lancia-Ferrari D50 over to team leader Juan Manuel Fangio after the latter suffered a steering-arm failure toward the end of the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Collins eventually finished second, but the advantage handed to Moss, and the extra points gained by Fangio&#x27;s finish, demoted Collins to third place in the championship. Collins&#x27;s selfless act gained him respect from Enzo Ferrari and high praise from Fangio: &quot;I was moved almost to tears by the gesture... Peter was one of the finest and greatest gentlemen I ever met in my racing career.&quot;

Meanwhile, in sports cars, he finished second in a Ferrari 860 Monza in the Mille Miglia and at the Swedish Sports Car GP in a Ferrari 290MM with Wolfgang von Trips in 1956; and then in 1957 finished second in the 1000km of Nürburgring with Olivier Gendebien and won the Venezuelan Grand Prix with Phil Hill, all in a Ferrari 335 S. Finally, in 1958 he won the 1000 km Buenos Aires and the 12 Hours of Sebring in a Ferrari 250 TR with Phil Hill. These three were back-to-back. His last World Sports Car Championship podium was another second place at the &#x27;Ring with Mike Hawthorn.

Also in 1956, Collins moved to Monaco to avoid compulsory military service in the British Army and thus continue his racing career.
In January 1957, Collins married American actress Louise King, daughter of the executive assistant to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, and the couple took up residence on a yacht in Monaco harbour. In the same year, Collins was joined at Ferrari by Hawthorn. The two became very close friends, even arranging to split their winnings between each other, and together engaged in a fierce rivalry with fellow Ferrari driver Luigi Musso. However, despite a third-place finish at the German Grand Prix, Ferrari were disadvantaged for much of the season as the 801 model (an evolution of the 1954 Lancia D50) was overweight and underpowered. However, Collins did score some wins that season, taking victory in the non-championship Syracuse&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.formula2.net/F157_5.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Naples Grands Prix.

1958 saw the introduction of the new, improved Ferrari Dino 246 and results started to improve for Scuderia Ferrari. Although achieving few results in the first half of the season, Collins improved and won the non-championship BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone, then finished third at the Monaco Grand Prix. However, Enzo Ferrari felt Collins was distracted by his supposed playboy lifestyle. The Monaco yacht where he lived was considered a perpetual party by Ferrari, who thought Collins was distracted and no longer focused on driving and developing sports cars.

Collins was sacked by Ferrari after deliberately damaging the clutch in his car, which he shared with Mike Hawthorn during the 24 Hours of Le Mans rather than race in a rainstorm, and was found drinking in a pub in England before the end of the race. Ferrari relented and allowed Collins to drive an F2 car until the end of the season. At the French Grand Prix at Reims, Hawthorn refused to start unless Collins was allowed to start in a F1 car. He did, and finished fifth. Ferrari immediately sacked Collins again. Hawthorn responded by flying to Italy and storming the Ferrari headquarters in Modena. Having smashed down locked doors, Hawthorn told Enzo Ferrari he would not drive for him again unless Collins was given his Formula One seat again; Ferrari relented.

Following Musso&#x27;s death at Reims, Ferrari was left without one of his top drivers, and so Collins&#x27;s position was for now safe. At the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Collins achieved perhaps his greatest drive. Under team orders and desiring to help his friend Hawthorn win the Championship, Collins led from the start, running flat out in an effort to beat the Vanwall of Moss. Although in an inferior car to the main contenders, by driving at the limit for 45 laps Collins gradually pulled away from Moss until his Vanwall expired and Collins won. The Ferrari team management decided not to slow Collins down and flag Hawthorn through to the win after Collins&#x27;s great drive. Moss&#x27;s future patron, Rob Walker, told Collins after the race that he found Collins&#x27;s driving frightening and he should never drive like that again. It was his third and final career victory.

==Death==
During the 1958 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, whilst chasing Tony Brooks&#x27;s Vanwall, Collins had a fatal crash. After pushing hard to keep pace, Collins went into the Pflanzgarten section of the circuit too quickly, which caused his Ferrari to run wide and encounter a ditch. Collins lost control of his car, as it flipped into the air and landed upside down. Collins was thrown from the car and struck a tree, sustaining critical head injuries. Despite treatment, Collins died later in the afternoon at a hospital in Bonn. His death was almost identical to the fate which his Ferrari teammate Luigi Musso suffered. Teammate Mike Hawthorn was so disturbed by Collins&#x27;s death that he retired from racing immediately after winning the 1958 Drivers&#x27; Championship. Hawthorn himself died during the following year after an automobile accident on the A3 bypass near Guildford, Surrey, England. In Tony Brooks&#x27;s autobiography, he recalled that he drove harder in that race, in the duel with Collins and Hawthorn, than at any other time in his life but, as in earlier duels with Fangio, the Ferrari pair were passing and repassing only on the safer North and South curves.

==Rivalry with Luigi Musso==
Many years after the death of Peter Collins, Fiamma Breschi, Luigi Musso&#x27;s girlfriend at the time of his death, revealed in a television documentary entitled &quot;The Secret Life of Enzo Ferrari&quot; the rivalry between teammates Collins, Hawthorn and Musso. Breschi recalled that the antagonism between Musso and the two English drivers encouraged all three to take risks. She said: &quot;The Englishmen (Hawthorn and Collins) had an agreement. Whichever of them won, they would share the winnings equally. It was the two of them against Luigi, who was not part of the agreement. Strength comes in numbers, and they were united against him. This antagonism was actually favourable rather than damaging to Ferrari. The faster the drivers went, the more likely it was that a Ferrari would win.&quot;

==Personal life==
Collins married Louise King in 1957, one week after they met in Miami, having proposed after two days. Louise was American, and her father was a US representative to the United Nations. She would be widowed in 1958 when Collins crashed at the Nürburgring. She was interviewed in the movie &quot;Ferrari: Race to Immortality&quot;.

<text>Peter Kenneth Gethin (21 February 1940 – 5 December 2011) was a British racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Gethin won the 1971 Italian Grand Prix with BRM.

Born and raised in Surrey, Gethin started his career in sportscar racing, competing in the British Sports Car Championship as a privateer until 1965. He progressed to Formula Three the following year, competing in the French and British Championships before graduating to Formula Two. Gethin won several titles in Formula 5000, prompting McLaren to sign him in to replace the recently-deceased Bruce McLaren. Despite retaining his seat for , Gethin moved to BRM from the onwards, winning the following race in Italy with an average speed of 242.615 km/h, a record which stood for 32 years. He remained at BRM in but was dropped at the end of the season, only making one-off appearances for BRM and Hill in and , respectively. In addition to his victory in Italy, Gethin had won two non-championship races, including the 1973 Race of Champions with Chevron. Gethin returned to European Formula 5000 upon his departure, twice finishing runner-up in 1974 and 1975, amongst winning the Tasman Series in the former. After competing in the 1974 World Sportscar Championship, driving the Chevron B26, Gethin further finished runner-up in the Canadian-American Challenge Cup and the Rothmans International Series in 1977, before retiring at the end of the season.

Upon retiring from motor racing, Gethin founded &quot;Peter Gethin Racing&quot; in 1986, a Formula 3000 team. He was the director of the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club from 2005 until 2008.

==Career==
===McLaren driver===
====1970====
Gethin made his debut in F1 for McLaren at the 1970 Dutch Grand Prix, replacing the team&#x27;s founder, Bruce McLaren, who had been killed at the Goodwood Circuit earlier in the month. He joined a three car team which also included Andrea de Adamich and Dan Gurney. He qualified strongly at Zandvoort, taking 11th, 2.110s behind Jochen Rindt&#x27;s pole time for Lotus. He was nine-tenths of a second ahead of his more illustrious but ageing teammate Gurney. He engaged in a good fight early in the race with Henri Pescarolo&#x27;s Matra, but soon got the better of the Frenchman and was still running in 10th when he had an accident on lap 19.

Gethin missed the French and British Grands Prix, as former McLaren legend and 1967 world champion Denny Hulme drove the car, but he returned for the German Grand Prix. He qualified less impressively, being only 17th, and a tenth of a second behind Hulme, who had remained with the team on Gethin&#x27;s return at the expense of Gurney. It was a disappointing race, as Gethin dropped to the back early on and retired after just 3 laps with a throttle failure.

The Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring was next, and it was another disappointing qualifying session for Gethin, who was down in 21st and comprehensively trounced by his teammates Hulme and de Adamich. As other drivers fell by the wayside in the race, however, Gethin climbed consistently up the order, and was running as high as 8th before he was passed by Ignazio Giunti&#x27;s Ferrari and Jo Siffert&#x27;s March late on, but it was his first grand prix finish as he came home 10th.

Gethin was again the rearmost of the McLaren cars at Monza for the Italian Grand Prix, but it was an improved performance, as he was 17th and as close as he had been to the pole time, 2.050 seconds behind Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari. He started well in the race and was quickly up to 13th after good passes on teammate de Adamich and Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s March. However, both Gethin and de Adamich soon suffered technical problems, and dropped to the back of the field, where they would stay until the end of the race, apart from brief periods ahead of Giunti and Tim Schenken&#x27;s De Tomaso when they were experiencing their own problems. Due to the sheer attrition of the race, de Adamich was 8th at the end and Gethin 9th, although the Englishman was 8 laps down and therefore not classified.

The Canadian Grand Prix at Mont-Tremblant saw the season leave Europe and head towards its finale in the Americas, and it saw a resurgence in Gethin&#x27;s form, as he out-qualified both de Adamich and Hulme, coming 11th just 1.7 seconds behind Jackie Stewart&#x27;s pole time. He played the race strategy well, and did not have to make any moves on the track, save one against Pescarolo. He was behind Hulme for a while, but the Kiwi retired with wheel problems. This left Gethin free to take 6th and his first points in F1.

Hoping to continue this form, they arrived in Watkins Glen for the United States Grand Prix. It appeared that Gethin&#x27;s Canada pace had not been carried over, as he was back behind Hulme and in 21st on the grid, 3.05 seconds behind Ickx on pole, although he was ahead of de Adamich. He raced strongly in the first half of the race, crucially getting ahead of the Brabhams of Jack Brabham and Rolf Stommelen, but both were able to pass him before too long. Tim Schenken and Clay Regazzoni, who was recovering from technical problems, also exposed his deficiencies in racecraft, leaving him 14th and last, and this was where he finished, 8 laps down on winner Emerson Fittipaldi in the Lotus.

The season concluded with the Mexican Grand Prix at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, and Gethin was back on form, qualifying a season best 10th, over half a second ahead of Hulme. He raced strongly again, keeping the faster car of 1964 world champion John Surtees, in the car bearing his name, behind for a number of laps. However, the McLaren&#x27;s reliability issues reared their ugly head again, and he slowed and finally stopped with engine failure on lap 28.

The season ended with Gethin in 23rd in the world championship, with just 1 solitary point earned in Canada.

====1971====
Gethin remained with McLaren for 1971, in a team now reduced to two cars, with Gethin partnering Hulme for another year. The first qualifying session at Kyalami went badly for the Englishman, who finished the session 11th, half a second behind his more illustrious teammate and 1.8 seconds behind pole man Jackie Stewart, driving for Tyrrell. In a race where Hulme was only denied victory by suspension problems four laps from the end, Gethin dropped back very quickly and retired just 7 laps in with a fuel leak.

The Montjuïc Circuit was the venue for the Spanish Grand Prix, which was next on the calendar. Gethin took a career best 7th, only 0.9 seconds behind Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari on pole and over three-tenths ahead of Hulme. He fast dropped behind Hulme and the second Ferrari of Mario Andretti, and when things straightened out he was down in 10th, behind François Cevert&#x27;s Tyrrell and the Lotus of Emerson Fittipaldi as well. However, the retirements of Andretti and Fittipaldi left him 8th, which is where he finished the race – depressingly he had been comfortably outperformed by Hulme, who had taken 5th.

Gethin&#x27;s first appearance at Monaco which was the next challenge, and Gethin did not impress in qualifying, being down in 14th, 1.6 seconds behind Hulme and almost four seconds behind Stewart&#x27;s pole time. He dropped a further place on the first lap, to Rolf Stommelen&#x27;s Surtees. He gradually gained places, however, due to others&#x27; retirements and a good overtake on John Surtees. He ran as high as 11th before he hit the barriers on lap 23.

He won the 1971 Italian Grand Prix with the fastest average speed in Formula One history (until the record was broken by Michael Schumacher in the same race in ), but this was his only podium finish. There was only 0.01 seconds between him and second placed Ronnie Peterson, also a record. Indeed, he never led an entire lap of Formula One racing, as he passed from fourth to first in the last lap.

==Death==
Gethin died at the age of 71 in December 2011 after a long illness.

<text>Philippe Pierre Streiff (26 June 1955 – 23 December 2022) was a French racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . 

==Early life and career==
Philippe Pierre Streiff was born on 26 June 1955 in La Tronche, Isère, France.

==Formula One career==
He participated in 55 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 21 October 1984. He achieved one podium, and scored a total of 11 championship points.

A pre-season testing crash at the Jacarepaguá circuit in Rio de Janeiro in with AGS left him a quadriplegic and thus using a wheelchair, with the quality of the care he received in the aftermath having been called into question, even if the accident itself was so serious the roll-bar broke on impact.

==Other ventures==

Streiff organised the Masters of Paris-Bercy, a kart racing competition held in collaboration with the FFSA, from 1993 to 2001.

In early 1994, Streiff made a bid to purchase Ligier in partnership with Hughes de Chaunac. The bid had the support of the similarly Renault-powered Williams F1 team, who intended to turn Ligier into a &#x27;junior&#x27; team. The bid was unsuccessful.

==Death==
Streiff died on 23 December 2022 aged 67 in Puteaux, Hauts-de-Seine, five miles from the centre of Paris.

==Legacy==
Belgian Luc Costermans, who had broken the World blind road speed record in late 2008, dedicated his record to Streiff.

<text>The Haig Fund (more properly the Earl Haig Fund, also called Haig&#x27;s Fund) is a charity set up in 1921 by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig.

==History==
In response to the poem &quot;In Flanders Field&quot; by John McCrae, Moina Michael started selling silk poppies in 1918 to raise funds for ex-servicemen. The &quot;Disabled Society&quot; was started in 1920 for disabled ex-servicemen and to raise funds for it Anna Guérin organised the production and sale of silk poppies. In 1921 Guérin persuaded Haig to adopt the poppy as the symbol of the Royal British Legion, however demand exceeded supply. In 1922 George Howson pledged that the disabled society could provide the poppies, which under the name of &quot;The Poppy Factory&quot; they continue to do.

On 1 January 1994 the words on the central black button were changed from &quot;Haig Fund&quot; to &quot;Poppy Appeal&quot;.

The Haig Fund continues to support veterans from all conflicts and other military actions involving British Armed Forces up to the present day. Its members sell remembrance poppies in the weeks before Remembrance Day/Armistice Day.

<doc id="1226523" wikidata="Q7126082" url="?curid=1226523" title="Pakuranga">
<text>Pakuranga is an eastern suburb of Auckland, in northern New Zealand. Pakuranga covers a series of low ridges and previously swampy flats, now drained, that lie between the Pakuranga Creek and Tamaki River, two estuarial arms of the Hauraki Gulf. It is located to the north of Manukau and 15 kilometres southeast of the Auckland CBD.

==Geography==
Pakuranga is located on the eastern shores of the Tāmaki River, on a peninsula formed between the river and the Pakuranga Creek to the south. In the 19th Century, inland Pakuranga was a peat wetland, dominated by &quot;Cordyline australis&quot; (tī kōuka / cabbage trees).

===Climate===
==Etymology==

The name Pakuranga is a contraction of (&quot;The Battle of the Sun&#x27;s Rays&quot;), a traditional Tāmaki Māori story involving a battle between the supernatural Tūrehu people of the Waitākere and Hunua ranges, where magic was used to turn warriors into stone using the sun&#x27;s rays. The gods Mataaho and Rūaumoko, after hearing of this battle, create the Auckland volcanic field in their rage. The name Pakuranga is a name that was also used for Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain, a volcano in Half Moon Bay.

The name Pakuranga was used by early European settlers from the 1840s to refer to the area between the Tāmaki River and Tūranga Creek. After the establishment of Howick, the name Pakuranga referred to the rural area to the west of the settlement as far as the Tāmaki River. The Pakuranga Highway District, defined in 1863, included areas to the north such as Bucklands Beach. The modern Pakuranga area was first formally defined in 1956, with the establishment of the Pakuranga County Town.

==History==
===Māori history===
The Pakuranga area is part of the rohe of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, who descend from the crew of the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory waka, who visited the area around the year 1300. The mouth of the Tāmaki River was traditionally known as (&quot;The Waters of Tāiki&quot;), named after the Ngāi Tai ancestor Tāiki. Tāiki settled with his followers along the eastern shores of the Tāmaki River, alongside the descendants of Huiārangi of the early iwi Te Tini ō Maruiwi. The upper reaches of the river near modern Pakuranga is traditionally known as , referring to Mokoikahikuwaru, a protector taniwha of the &quot;Tainui&quot; waka who is described in legends as taking up residence at the Panmure Basin.

Ngāi Tai created extensive cultivations along the eastern shores of the Tāmaki River. Ōhuiarangi / Pigeon Mountain was an important pā site for Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, named after ancestress Huiārangi, daughter of Tāmaki of Te Tini ō Maruiwi. The slopes of the mountain and surrounding areas were home to stonefield gardens, and the mountain was an important location for snaring kererū. In approximately the first half of the 18th century, Ngāriki, a rangatira of Ngāi Tai, built a fortified pā at Te Naupata (Musick Point), the headland at the end of the peninsula, called Te Waiārohia (a shortening of Te Waiārohia ō Ngāriki). The followers of Ngāriki also settled at the Ōhuiarangi pā.

By the mid-18th century, Ngāti Pāoa, a Hauraki Gulf tribe with close relationships to Ngāi Tai, established themselves on the western shores of the river at Panmure, at Mokoia pā and a kāinga called Mauināina. By the time missionaries Samuel Marsden and John Gare Butler visited the isthmus in 1820, there were thousands of inhabitants living along the shores of the Tāmaki River at Mokoia.

During the Musket Wars in the 1820s, Mokoia pā and Mauināina were attacked by a Ngāpuhi taua (war party), devastating the settlement. The wider area was evacuated by Ngāti Pāoa and Ngāi Tai, with most members of Ngāi Tai fleeing to the Waikato for temporary refuge during this time. When English missionary William Thomas Fairburn visited the area in 1833, it was mostly unoccupied. The land at Mokoia and Mauināina pā became tapu for Ngāti Pāoa due to the large number of deaths, and was not resettled.

In 1836, William Thomas Fairburn brokered a land sale between Tāmaki Māori chiefs covering the majority of modern-day South Auckland, East Auckland and the Pōhutukawa Coast. The sale was envisioned as a way to end hostilities in the area, but it is unclear what the chiefs understood or consented to. Māori continued to live in the area, unchanged by this sale. In 1854 when Fairburn&#x27;s purchase was investigated by the New Zealand Land Commission, a Ngāi Tai reserve was created around the Wairoa River and Umupuia areas, and as a part of the agreement, members of Ngāi Tai agreed to leave their traditional settlements to the west.

===European settlement===
The Pakuranga area was sold by Government auction in 1843. Much of the area was farmed by Hemi Pepene, a Ngāpuhi orphan who grew up at the Paihia Mission Station and was taken care of by the Fairburns, and by Joseph Hargreaves, who bought 82 acres in 1843 and constructed the first European house in Pakuranga. In 1847, Howick was established as a defensive outpost for Auckland, by fencibles (retired British Army soldiers) and their families. The first ferry services across the river to Panmure began in 1850. Many of the first European farmers in the area were fencibles from Howick, such as brothers Robert and Thomas Every Maclean in 1851 who developed extensive livestock farms, and Patrick and Ann Fitzpatrick who bought land in 1852. By the mid-1860s, wheat became the most significant crop in the area.

In September 1863 during the Invasion of the Waikato, the Ngāi Tai village of Ōtau near Clevedon was attacked by the British army, and the village was evacuated, with people moving to communities at the river&#x27;s mouth. While Māori of South Auckland such as Te Ākitai Waiohua were forced to leave, Ngāi Tai were designated as a &quot;friendly&quot; people by the Crown and remained neutral in the fighting. After the Native Lands Act of 1865, the Native Land Court confiscated many Ngāi Tai lands. The remaining land was individuated, slowly sold on to European farmers.

Pakuranga became more accessible after the opening of the Panmure Bridge, connecting Pakuranga to Panmure across the Tāmaki River in 1865. In the same year, the capital of New Zealand was moved from Auckland to Wellington, causing major financial problems for the area as land prices plummeted and demand for butter dropped. In 1869, Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (the Duke of Edinburgh) visited New Zealand, spending a month living at Pakuranga.

In 1874, the Pakuranga Hunt was established and by 1900 had become one of the largest social clubs in Auckland. The Hunt was based in East Tāmaki, organising hare hunts and county balls for the wider area. The name Pakuranga became synonymous with the hunt, and by 1960 the hunt had relocated south to Karaka.

By the later 19th Century, Pakuranga developed into an area similar to the English countryside, dominated by poplar, oak and willow trees. Over time, the wheat fields were gradually replaced with dairy farms, which dominated the area until the 1940s. The Pakuranga Hall was opened in 1921,

===Suburbanisation===

In the 1930s, the road to Howick was concreted, improving transport times for milk to Auckland, and for passengers into the area. In 1948, Pakuranga was considered as a potential site for the new international airport, which eventually opened in Māngere. Land in Pakuranga was subdivided into housing from the 1950s, and the Manukau County Council planned to leave a green belt separating Pakuranga from Howick, however lost a court case with a farmer who planned to subdivide his land. By 1956, the area had grown in size enough that the Pakuranga County Town was established within Manukau County. A new Panmure Bridge facilitated further growth after its construction in 1959.

In 1965, the Pakuranga Town Centre (now known as Pakuranga Plaza) was officially opened. It was the second modern American-style mall constructed in Auckland, and incorporated a number of major stores, such as Farmers and a George Court department store. By the mid-1970s, Pakuranga developed an image as a stereotypical location for busy housewives. The area acquired the nicknames &quot;Nappy Valley&quot; and &quot;Vim Valley&quot;, the latter referring to a popular advertisement for the cleaning product Vim, that featured Pakuranga housewives.

The Pakuranga Community Hall was opened in 1975, and in 1981 Lloyd Elsmore Park, a multi-purpose urban park, sporting facility and home to the Howick Historical Village, was officially opened.

The Eastern Busway, a project to link Botany to Panmure by rapid transport, began construction in 2019. The busway opened to Pakuranga in 2021, with the entire project scheduled to open by the mid-2020s.

==Local government==

The first local government in the area was the Borough of Auckland, which was established in 1851 and administered some areas of Pakuranga. In 1865, the Pakuranga Highway District was established, later becoming the Pakuranga Road Board. This was merged into the Manukau County in 1921. By 1956, the area had grown in size enough that the Pakuranga County Town was established within the Manukau County. This was merged into Manukau City in 1965. In November 2010, all cities and districts of the Auckland Region were amalgamated into a single body, governed by the Auckland Council.

Pakuranga is part of the Howick local board area, who elects members of the Howick Local Board. Residents of Howick also elect two Howick ward councillors, who sits on the Auckland Council.

<text>Piers Raymond Courage (27 May 1942 – 21 June 1970) was a British racing driver. He participated in 29 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 2 January 1967. He achieved two podium finishes, and scored 20 championship points.

==Biography==
Piers Courage was the eldest son of Richard Courage (1915-1994), Lord of the Manor of Edgcote whose aunt, Dorothy Courage (1877-1972, later De Zeote) is referenced in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot; having married another well-known sportsman, cricketer Herman de Zoete in July 1903. Piers was the heir to the Courage brewing dynasty of which his father was chairman. Educated at Eton College, Piers began his racing career in his own Lotus 7.

Following a brief stint touring the European F3 racing circuit in 1964 with a Lotus 22, along with Jonathan Williams, good results persuaded him to pursue a full season in 1965. It was in this season, driving a 1.0L F3 Brabham for Charles Lucas, that he first formed an alliance with Frank Williams, at that time Lucas&#x27;s other driver and sometime mechanic. A string of good results, including four high-profile wins, encouraged Colin Chapman to offer Courage a seat in a Lotus 41 for the 1966 F3 season. This car was inferior to the dominant Brabhams but Courage still managed to outperform them on occasion, earning him a step up to the F2 category for the 1966 German Grand Prix, where he crashed out.

Signed by the BRM works Formula 1 team for 1967, alongside Chris Irwin, his wild driving style caused him to repeatedly crash out of races and his tendency to spin at crucial moments led to the team dropping him after the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix. He completed the remainder of the season concentrating on his alternative drive, as was common in the 1960s, in John Coombs&#x27;s F2 McLaren M4A, finishing fourth in the unclassified drivers&#x27; championship. At the end of the season he purchased the car from Coombs. A good run in the McLaren during the winter Tasman Series, including a win at the last race, resulted in Tim Parnell offering a drive in his works-supported Reg Parnell Racing BRM team for 1968. In addition to a good run in F1 in 1968 – including points-scoring finishes in France and Italy – Courage also drove for old friend Frank Williams&#x27;s F2 team. When Frank Williams Racing Cars decided to make the step up to F1 in 1969, Courage was their first choice as driver.

In Courage&#x27;s hands, Williams&#x27;s dark-blue liveried Brabham BT26 was more than a match for many of the works teams. He finished second in both the Monaco Grand Prix and the US Grand Prix, at Watkins Glen. Perhaps his finest drive of the season, though, was during the 1969 Italian Grand Prix at the high-speed Monza circuit. Despite an older car, and a power deficit, he managed to stay with the leading pack for the majority of the race. Only fuel starvation caused his pace to slow near the end, and he finally finished in fifth. A second fifth place, in the British Grand Prix, saw Courage finish the season on sixteen points in eighth place in the drivers&#x27; championship.

==Accident and death==

Following a business arrangement with Alejandro de Tomaso, Williams switched to a newly designed De Tomaso chassis for the 1970 Formula One season. Unfortunately for Courage, the De Tomaso proved to be overweight and unreliable, and only a third place in the non-championship International Trophy alleviated a poor string of results in the early season. The Dutch Grand Prix seemed to be going slightly better, with Courage qualifying in ninth place around the Zandvoort Circuit. Running in the middle of the field, the De Tomaso&#x27;s front suspension or steering broke on the bump at Tunnel Oost, causing the car to suddenly go straight on instead of finishing the high-speed bend. It then rode up an embankment (one of the Zandvoort dunes) and disintegrated, with the engine breaking loose from the monocoque, upon which it burst into flames. To lighten the De Tomaso, magnesium was used in its chassis and suspension. The magnesium burned so intensely that many nearby trees and bushes were set alight.
During the impact, one of the front wheels broke off the car and hit Courage&#x27;s head, tearing away his helmet (both the wheel and the helmet came rolling out of the cloud of dust at the same time). It is assumed that this impact broke Courage&#x27;s neck or caused fatal head injuries and that he died instantly as a result. Courage was survived by his wife, Lady Sarah Marguerite Curzon (b. 1945), and his two sons, Jason Piers Courage (b. 10 February 1967) and Amos Edward Sebastian Courage (b. 26 February 1969).

Courage was buried in St Mary the Virgin churchyard, Shenfield, Essex.

Just three years later, Roger Williamson crashed fatally when his car came to rest upside down and burst into flames at the same spot, the Tunnel Oost bump, where Courage&#x27;s accident had started.

<text>Pastirma or Pasterma, also called pastarma, pastırma, pastrma, pastourma, basdirma, basterma, basturma, or aboukh is a highly seasoned, air-dried cured beef that is found in the cuisines of Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, Bulgaria, Egypt, Kurdish region,
Greece, Cyprus, Iraq, the Levant, North Macedonia, Turkey and Georgia.

==Etymology and history==
&quot;Basturma&quot; existed in ancient Armenian cuisine, where it was known as &quot;aboukh&quot;&#x27; (). The word &quot;abookhd&quot; (Classical Armenian &quot;apukht&quot;) was already used in the Armenian translation of the Bible, in the fifth century AD, meaning “salted and dried meat”.

&quot;Pastırma&quot; is mentioned in Mahmud of Kashgar″s Diwan Lughat al-Turk and Evliya Çelebi″s Seyahatname. According to Turkish scholar Biron Kiliç, the term is derived from the Turkic noun &quot;bastırma&quot;, which means &quot;pressing&quot;. The &quot;Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink&quot; writes that &quot;pastırma&quot; is the word the Ottomans used for a type of Byzantine cured beef that was called &quot;paston&quot; (παστόν). According to Johannes Koder, an expert in Byzantine studies, &quot;paston&quot; could mean either salted meat or salted fish, while &quot;akropaston&quot; (ἀκρόπαστον) means salted meat. Andrew Dalby gives the definition of &quot;paston&quot; as &quot;salted fish&quot; and &quot;akropaston apakin&quot; as &quot;well-salted fillet steak&quot;. Gregory Nagy gives the definition of &quot;akropaston&quot; as &quot;smoked&quot;, describing &quot;apakin&quot; as &quot;a kind of salami sausage, probably similar to pastourma&quot;. The &quot;Oxford Companion for Food&quot; says that a Byzantine dried meat delicacy was &quot;a forerunner of the pastirma of modern Turkey&quot;.

The English word &quot;pastrami&quot; came by way of Yiddish and perhaps combined with the word &quot;salami&quot;.

==Preparation and usage==
Pastirma is usually made from water buffalo or beef, but other meats can also be used. In Egypt, it is known as Basterma and is made not only with beef, but with the meat of water buffaloes as well. Some pastirmas are made with horsemeat. Different cuts of meat may be used; a single cow can produce 26 different &quot;types&quot; of pastirma. Fillet, shank, leg and shoulder cuts are used for the best quality pastirmas. It is usually made during the months of October and November.

To make pastirma, the meat is rinsed and salted before being dried and pressed. After the first drying period, the meat is cold pressed for up to 16 hours. This aids the process of removing moisture from the meat. After the first pressing, the meat is dried for several days, during which the fats melt and form a white layer. The second press is a &quot;hot press&quot;. Finally, the dried and pressed meat is covered with a spice paste called &quot;&quot;. &quot;Cemen&quot; is made from a paste consisting of caraway, paprika, blue fenugreek, fenugreek, black pepper, allspice, cumin, cayenne, salt and mashed garlic. The dried product is covered with the wet paste and left to dry again. The entire process takes approximately one full month. Pastirma is classified as an &quot;intermediate moisture food&quot;. Lowering the moisture level is a form of food preservation that hinders the growth of microorganisms, and the &quot;cemen&quot; paste &quot;is used to control surface mold growth during storage&quot;. Other functions of the &quot;cemen&quot; include improved flavor, characteristic red coloring, prevention of further drying, and antimicrobial effects.

==Cuisines==
Today, pastirma is present in the cuisines of Armenia, Egypt, Turkey, Bulgaria and the Levant.

===Armenia===

The cured meat, which resembles Italian bresaola, is called &quot;basturma&quot; (բաստուրմա) or &quot;aboukht&quot; (ապուխտ) by Armenians. Some Armenian pizzerias in cities like Yerevan, Boston and Los Angeles serve basturma topped pizza. Armenian restaurants also serve basturma topped burgers, basturma can be added to salads, and basturma with omelette is also a common breakfast item in Armenia. Basturma, or a basturma omelette can also be wrapped inside a lavash, alongside other ingredients like coriander, chechil cheese, and garlic matzoon.

According to Nigol Bezjian, Armenians who survived the 1915 genocide brought &quot;basturma&quot; with them to the Middle East. Bezjian recalls that his grandmother used to prepare &quot;basturma omelets fried in olive oil with pieces of lavash bread&quot;. He notes that Armenians from Kayseri were particularly renowned &quot;basturma&quot; producers.

Arabs mocked Armenians with phrases like &quot;It smells like there is &quot;basturma&quot; here&quot;, referring to the strong smell of &quot;basturma&quot; that is produced by the garlic and fenugreek mixture that the meat is coated in during preservation. Shoushou, a well-known Lebanese comedian of the 1960s–1970s, portrayed a caricature of an Armenian &quot;basturma&quot; seller; he retired the character after local Lebanese Armenians complained.

In Palestine, Armenian families gather on New Year&#x27;s Eve and eat traditional foods including &quot;basturma&quot;, çiğ köfte and a traditional Anatolian confection called kaghtsr sujukh ().

===Bulgaria===
Pastarma (as it is called in Bulgaria) arrived in Bulgaria in the 7th century. Specific products include Пастърма говежда / Pastarma Govezhda, which was registered as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed in the EU in 2017.

===Turkey===

In Turkish cuisine pastırma can be eaten as a breakfast dish, and it is a common ingredient in omelettes, &quot;menemen&quot; (Turkish-style &quot;shakshouka&quot;) or a variation of eggs benedict. 

&quot;Pastırma&quot; can be used as a topping for hummus, &quot;pide&quot; bread, hamburgers, and toasted sandwiches with either cheddar cheese or kasar cheese. It can be as a filling for a &quot;börek&quot; that is made with &quot;kadayıf&quot; instead of the traditional filo dough. It may be combined with potato to make a filling for traditional &quot;böreks&quot; as well.

It is also a common addition to many of the traditional vegetable dishes, especially the tomato and white bean stew called , but also cabbage (), chickpeas (), asparagus () and spinach (). It can also be used to make cheesy pull-apart bread.

==Production==
Turkey produces around 2041 tons of pastirma each year. The pastirma from Kayseri is particularly well known. In their 1893 report the British Foreign Office note that Kayseri, which they call Cesarea, &quot;is specially renowned for the preparation of &quot;basturma&quot; (pemmican)&quot;.

<text>Saint Isaac the Confessor, also Isaacius or Isaakios (; died May 30, 383 AD), founder of the Dalmatian Monastery in Constantinople, was a Christian monk who is honored as a saint and confessor. He is sometimes referred to as Isaac the Dalmatian, not because he came from Dalmatia, but because of the monastery which he founded.

==Life==
According to some accounts, Isaac was a Syrian, but this is uncertain. Certain details about his early life are unknown but history records that Isaac had been a hermit living in a small hut in the wilderness outside of Constantinople. In the year 378, when he heard that the Roman emperor Valens had fallen into the heresy of Arianism and was persecuting the Nicene Christians, deposing bishops, closing some churches, and turning others over to the Arians, Isaac went into the imperial city to confront the emperor. At the time, Valens was preparing a military campaign against the Goths. After several attempts to dissuade the emperor from his persecutions, Isaac prophesied that Valens would &quot;die in flames&quot; because of his actions. The emperor ordered that Isaac be thrown into prison, vowing that he would punish Isaac and put him to death upon his return from battle. Soon after, on August 9, 378, Valens was defeated at the Battle of Adrianople and died in a fire after taking refuge in a barn.

Valens&#x27; successor, the Emperor Theodosius I, released Isaac, outlawed Arianism and reopened the churches closed by Valens. Isaac wanted to return to monastic life in the wilderness, but a wealthy aristocrat named Saturninus built a monastery for Isaac in Constantinople, over which he became the first hegumen (abbot). Isaac is also known as a zealous defender of Christian orthodoxy at the Second Ecumenical Council, convened in Constantinople in 381.

At the end of his life, Isaac entrusted the leadership of the monastery to his closest disciple, Dalmatus, who was later himself glorified (canonized as a saint), and after whom the monastery came to be known as the &quot;Dalmatian Monastery&quot;. Isaac died in his monastery on May 30, 383, although others place his death around 396. The life of John Chrysostom includes mention of St. Isaac living into the fifth century.

Both the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic churches have glorified Isaac as a saint. Among the former, his feast day falls on May 30, and he is also commemorated together with other saints from his monastery on August 3.

Peter the Great of Russia (reigned 1682–1725), whose birthday fell on Saint Isaac&#x27;s feast day, May 30, adopted Isaac as the patron saint of the Romanov dynasty. Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral in the city of St Petersburg is consecrated to his honour.

<text>Raul de Mesquita Boesel (, born 4 December 1957) is a Brazilian former racing driver who raced for the March and Ligier Formula One teams and later raced in Champ Car and the Indy Racing League.

He won the 1987 World Sportscar Championship and the 1988 24 Hours of Daytona.

==Personal and early life==
Raul Boesel was born on 4 December 1957 in Curitiba, Brazil as the son of Jorny and Elizadea de Mesquita Boesel. Boesel had a brief career in equestrian show jumping winning state championships and other competitions.

Since 1988, he resides in Key Biscayne, Florida with his wife Vera and children Raul Boesel Jr and Gabriela. He owns a Cigarette 38 Top Gun boat.

==Career==

He studied engineering, gave up his degree and went on to motor racing. He entered into first ever season of the Brazilian Stock Car championship in 1979.

He moved to Britain in 1980 to race in Formula Ford 1600 and in 1981 entered Formula 3 and finished third in the championship. In November 1981 he tested for McLaren and entered the March team, only to switch in 1983 to Ligier. At the end of the year he went to the United States to race in CART.

In 1987 he switched to World Sportscar Championship with Jaguar and won the title with five victories. In 1988 he won the 24 Hours of Daytona in a Jaguar XJR-9, along with Martin Brundle and John Nielsen. That year he also returned to CART and finished third at Indianapolis in 1989. In 1991 he finished second in Le Mans 24 Hours with Jaguar and returned to CART, finishing fifth in the 1993 series, although never winning a race. He raced in CART until 1998, when he went to Indy Racing League. Because of this, he has multiple starts in the Indy 500. His last race in CART was at the 1999 Marlboro 500 at Fontana.

Autódromo Internacional de Curitiba, a racing circuit in Curitiba, is officially nicknamed &quot;Circuito Raul Boesel&quot; (Raul Boesel circuit) in honour of his success in Europe.

Boesel ended his professional racing career in 2005 after returning to Stock Car Brasil, although he still competes in some races after his retirement.

Afterwards, he often comments about various racing categories. In 2007, he started a career as a disc jockey.

<doc id="1226544" wikidata="Q171431" url="?curid=1226544" title="Ricardo Rosset">
<text>Ricardo Rosset (born 27 July 1968) is a Brazilian racing driver. Runner-up in the 1995 International Formula 3000 Championship, he later participated in 33 Formula One Grands Prix, making his debut at the 1996 Australian Grand Prix. He scored no championship points. He eventually quit Formula One to focus on developing a sportswear business in Brazil.

==Career==
===Formula Three===
After graduating from the Formula Opel Euroseries, Rosset competed in the British Formula 3 Championship in 1993 for Alan Docking Racing. He finished joint sixth in the standings, tied with Pedro de la Rosa, with his best finish being one second place at Silverstone. Rosset moved to the AJS team in 1994, and improved to fifth in the standings in a season dominated by Jan Magnussen. He won his first F3 race that year at Snetterton, albeit on an occasion where Magnussen retired.

===Formula 3000===
Rosset made his début in International Formula 3000 with the Super Nova Racing team in 1995. His teammate was the more experienced Vincenzo Sospiri, who won the drivers&#x27; championship that year. In 1995 Rosset came second to his teammate – winning two races, including his first ever F3000 race – and finished second in the championship.

===Formula One===
====Footwork (1996)====
Although he had an opportunity to join Minardi, Rosset was hired by Footwork in as teammate to Jos Verstappen. He never matched the Dutch driver&#x27;s pace (Verstappen was quicker in qualifying for all the races), although the team largely stopped development on the car when Tom Walkinshaw bought it. Rosset later stated that the cash-strapped team were unable to provide two identical cars, with a lack of spares, and they concentrated on the faster driver, Verstappen.

====Lola (1997)====

In Rosset&#x27;s only option in Formula One was to join MasterCard Lola, where he was partnered with his former F3000 teammate Vincenzo Sospiri. However, the team pulled out of Formula One after one failure to qualify at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix due to an uncompetitive and underdeveloped car, the Lola T97/30, and a breakdown in sponsorship from MasterCard. Rosset was left without a drive for the rest of the season.

====Tyrrell (1998)====
In 1998, Rosset was chosen by Craig Pollock to be Tyrrell&#x27;s second driver alongside Toranosuke Takagi, to the fury of Ken Tyrrell, whose first choice was Verstappen, although Rosset later stated Tyrrell&#x27;s choice was Norberto Fontana. Pollock had bought into the team with a view to establishing BAR, and saw Rosset&#x27;s superior sponsorship finance as essential in balancing the team&#x27;s budget. The decision led to Tyrrell leaving the team midway through the season.

The 1998 season was another unsuccessful one for Rosset, and led to increasing criticism of his abilities. Failing to qualify at Monaco, he spun towards the end of the qualifying session, and embarrassingly beached his car on the kerb when he tried to spin the car round to the face in the right direction. When Murray Walker suggested that people were debating whether Rosset was F1 quality, co-commentator and ex-F1 driver Martin Brundle replied, &quot;it&#x27;s a fairly short debate, Murray&quot;. Rosset has countered the criticism against him, claiming that, for journalists, making a driver look stupid is more lucrative than discovering the truth. He blamed a worn clutch for the incident: &quot;That&#x27;s why it looks so bad... the clutch wasn&#x27;t working.&quot; Even Rosset&#x27;s own mechanics were critical of him: after he damaged his car in a collision with Jacques Villeneuve at Monaco and received a warning from the stewards, his mechanics switched the first and last letters of his surname on his paddock scooter to form the word &quot;tosser&quot;. Rosset later said, &quot;I never saw that. Maybe behind the scenes, the mechanics, they were saying that. I remember something like that... I don&#x27;t doubt it.&quot;

Despite an eighth-place finish at the next race in Canada, which was ultimately the team&#x27;s best result of the season, Rosset was in danger of losing his seat to Danish driver Tom Kristensen. At a test at Magny-Cours, Rosset and Takagi posted almost equal times, with Kristensen around half a second slower, albeit with an older engine. Rosset said in 2019 that Kristensen drove the same car as he did, with only a change of seat and minor adjustments. Rosset went on to outqualify Takagi at the following race at the same circuit, the French Grand Prix.

Rosset&#x27;s problems included missing out on qualification for the Spanish Grand Prix by 0.06s, and an injury during practice for the German Grand Prix which prevented him from taking part in qualifying, while in Belgium he crashed into the carnage of the 14-car pile-up on the first lap after being unsighted by the heavy spray, and was unable to take the restart. A further failure to qualify at Tyrrell&#x27;s final race in Japan, where he was hindered by a neck injury caused by a crash in practice, marked the end of his Formula One career.

Rosset later stated his belief that Tyrrell concentrated heavily on his Honda-backed teammate Takagi, and gave the Japanese driver an advantage in order to win favour from Honda. &quot;They wanted him to look good... so I was somebody not very welcome,&quot; he said. &quot;For sure, they weren&#x27;t behind me.&quot;

===After Formula One===
After leaving the team at the end of the season, Rosset quit racing entirely to concentrate on his sportswear business in Brazil. However, he made a return to racing in the 2008 Brazilian GT3 Championship, partnering Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles. At the end of the season, the pair had won four times in their Ford GT and finished second in the overall standings.

Encouraged by this performance, Rosset bought the Footwork FA17 chassis that he raced in 1996, and planned to enter it in a historic F1 series in 2009, but ultimately did not. He later bought his 1998 Tyrrell 026 on eBay, and keeps both cars at his home. He has said of his Formula One career, &quot;I was very grateful I had the chance... I did my best, the best I could do. I pushed as hard as I could... What people say, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&quot;

Rosset went on to win the Porsche GT3 Cup Brasil in 2010, 2013, and 2015.

<text>Paul Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Ginther (5 August 1930 – 20 September 1989) was an American racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Ginther won the 1965 Mexican Grand Prix with Honda.

Born in Hollywood, Ginther competed in Formula One for Ferrari, Scarab, BRM, Honda, Cooper and Eagle, winning the in with Honda, when he became the first driver to win for Honda in Formula One. He finished third in the 1963 World Drivers&#x27; Championship with BRM, and scored 14 podiums across eight seasons.

Ginther was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2008.

==Early career==
Richie Ginther was born on 5 August 1930 in Hollywood. His family moved to Ohio for his father&#x27;s work before moving back to California and to Santa Monica, the same Californian town as future Formula One World Champion Phil Hill, and it was through Hill, a friend of Ginther&#x27;s older brother, George, that he first began to race. After finishing school in 1948, Ginther followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and went to work for Douglas Aircraft, initially in the tool and die shop. In his spare time he helped Hill to repair, maintain and race his collection of old cars and hot rods, as Hill&#x27;s racing career began to gather pace. Ginther made his race debut at Pebble Beach in 1951, driving a Ford-engined MG T-type sports car.

However, Ginther&#x27;s career was put on hold shortly after, when he was drafted for two years of national service during the Korean War. During this time he received training and experience working in aircraft and engine mechanics, skills which he would later put to good use during his driving career. On emergence from the military, Hill requested that Ginther join him, principally as a riding mechanic, in driving a privately entered 4.1-liter Ferrari in the 1953 Carrera Panamericana. The pair ran high in the rankings until Hill lost control, crashed, and wrote off the car. Both Ginther and Hill were unharmed and returned in 1954 to take second place, beaten only by the works Ferrari of Umberto Maglioli.

Nineteen fifty-four was also the year that Ginther returned to race driving himself, mostly in a self-prepared Austin-Healey. His results were impressive enough that the following year VW and Porsche dealer John von Neumann hired him to drive a Porsche in domestic competitions. When von Neumann started dealing in Ferrari cars in 1956, Ginther also got the chance to drive these. In between working in von Neumann&#x27;s Ferrari dealership — including trips to the Ferrari factory in Italy to sort customer problems — Ginther began to build an impressive racing reputation on the West Coast. This, and his choice of Ferrari mounts, brought him to the attention of the East Coast Ferrari franchise-holder, three-time 24 Hours of Le Mans-winner, Luigi Chinetti. Aside from importing Ferrari road cars, Chinetti also operated a successful race team, soon to metamorphose into Ferrari&#x27;s official motorsport presence in North America: NART. Ginther first raced for Chinetti in 1957 and with him made his first appearances in international-level events, first in the 12 Hours of Sebring and then driving a two-liter Ferrari 500 TR in the Le Mans race.

Also in 1957, Ginther was signed to drive the Aston Martin of Joe Lubin and over the next three years would continue to compete in many sports car racing events in both Aston and Ferrari machinery, with great success. That June, he won a 15-lap GT race at the new Lime Rock Park, and won the opening race of the national championship in his Ferrari. In early-1958, he piloted a two-liter Ferrari to victory at the County Fairgrounds in Pomona, California, averaging , and won in a three-liter GT in a five-lap qualifying preliminary for the SCCA Pacific Coast Championship. By the end of the year Ginther had captured the Pacific Coast Sports Car Championship outright. He triumphed by a wide margin at Pomona at the opening sports car race of 1959, in a von Neumann 4.1-liter Ferrari, and in June 1959, won in a three-liter Ferrari TR in the first Hourglass road races in San Diego, California. Throughout this period he continued to mix his race driving with a steady job at von Neumann&#x27;s dealership, and by late 1959 the strain was beginning to show.

==Formula One==

===Ferrari===

Ginther made his F1 debut at the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix driving for Ferrari, which he stayed with through . In the September 1960 Italian Grand Prix in Monza, he placed second to Hill. Ginther led from the start until the 25th lap when Hill passed him and led until the finish.

Following the season the Ferrari team gave up 1000 cc in engine size. The 2500 cc engine,
permitted the previous year, was replaced by a 1.5-liter rear-engine model, with 110 less horsepower. However, the newer engine was superior in both &quot;profiling&quot; and handling. The conservative Enzo Ferrari was the last major Formula 1 race car manufacturer to make the transition to cars with engines in the rear.
In 1961, Ginther was the No. 3 Ferrari driver, behind No. 1 Wolfgang Von Trips and No. 2 Hill. Giancarlo Baghetti occasionally piloted a fourth car. The team manager was Romulo Tavoni.

On May 14, 1961, Ginther finished second to Stirling Moss at the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix, 3.6 seconds behind, a few hundred feet. He was driving a new rear-engine Ferrari with a 120-degree V-6 which had a lower center of gravity. Ginther had qualified second, just ahead of Hill, with an average speed of , and a qualifying time of 1:39.3. He eclipsed the previous course record of 1:39.6, before Moss took pole position the day after.

In August 1961, Ginther and Baghetti were teammates at the Pescara Grand Prix, a world auto manufacturers&#x27; championship event. Their Ferrari was leading on the 10th lap when it stopped on a straight stretch with a flat tire. Ginther averaged more than on the Autodromo Nazionale Monza in September 1961, to lead the first day of qualifying for the 1961 Italian Grand Prix. Von Trips qualified first with Ginther taking the third starting position after Ricardo Rodriguez. Ginther retired in the race. Von Trips died in a spectacular crash on the second lap, which also killed eleven spectators, when his Ferrari climbed a earth embankment. 
It brushed a wire fence employed to restrain a portion of the crowd and struck the spectators. Some who were injured eventually succumbed and brought the total to 15 deaths. The Ferrari team ceased competition until January 1, 1962, as a mark of respect to Von Trips.

===BRM and Honda===

In , Ginther switched to the British-based BRM team to race alongside Graham Hill. The highlight of his time at BRM was finishing equal-second (with Hill) in the 1963 World Championship. Ginther scored more points than his British teammate over the whole season, but only a driver&#x27;s six best scores were counted towards the championship.

His reputation as a solid &quot;team player&quot; and excellent test and development driver earned him an invitation to join the works Honda F1 team for 1965, for whom he scored his one and only GP win, at the 1965 Mexican Grand Prix. The win was also Honda&#x27;s first in Formula 1. Ginther averaged over the curving track in the 65 lap Mexico City event. His speed eclipsed the previous course record of established by Dan Gurney in 1964. It was the first time Honda had entered the Mexican Grand Prix. Honda reentered international competition in the 1966 Italian Grand Prix. The team was three years old and had encountered difficulty in the preparation of a larger engine. Ginther led in Italy before his car crashed into a retaining wall and he broke his collarbone. He signed with the Eagle F1 team in 1967 and raced in the Race of Champions. His last race entered was the Monaco Grand Prix, but he failed to qualify.

Ginther won one race, achieved 14 podiums, and scored a total of 107 championship points.

He appeared in an uncredited role in the 1966 film &quot;Grand Prix&quot; as John Hogarth, a driver in the Japanese funded &quot;Yamura&quot; team. He also acted as one of the technical racing advisors for the movie.

While making an attempt to qualify for the 1967 Indianapolis 500, Ginther broke a fuel line in his American Eagle Indy Car. A mix of ethanol and gasoline, was sprayed down his back. This experience, along with the recent fiery death of close friend Lorenzo Bandini, along with other factors, led to his sudden retirement.

He participated in a rally with sixty-five other competitors, including actor James Garner, in June 1969. The California Sports Car Club event was three hours cross country from Los Angeles to Huntington Beach. It benefited students from the Braille Institute.
Ginther managed a Porsche 911S with two American drivers during the 39th 24 hours of Le Mans, in June 1971.

==Death==
Ginther died of a heart attack while on vacation with his family in France, in Touzac, near Bordeaux, on September 20, 1989.

==Awards==
He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2008.

==Biography==
In 2020, to mark what would have been Ginther&#x27;s 90th birthday, a biography was released about Richie&#x27;s life and career by Richard Jenkins, published by Performance Publishing. &quot;Richie Ginther: Motor Racing&#x27;s Free Thinker&quot; won the RAC Motoring Book of the Year Award for its depth of research and previously unpublished information

<text>Robert Jean Joseph Manzon (12 April 1917 – 19 January 2015) was a French racing driver. He participated in 29 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 21 May 1950. He achieved two podiums, and scored a total of 16 championship points. At the time of his death, Manzon was the last surviving driver to have taken part in the first Formula One World Championship in 1950.

==Career==
Manzon began his career as a mechanic and after World War II he started racing, initially with a Cisitalia D46. Earning a contract with the Gordini team for 1948, Manzon won some minor races although his machinery was not always reliable.

He continued with Gordini into the new Formula One era, scoring points at the 1950 French Grand Prix, and finishing sixth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1952, taking third place in the 1952 Belgian Grand Prix. He left Gordini in 1953 and joined Louis Rosier&#x27;s team, which was campaigning Ferraris. He subsequently achieved his second podium at the 1954 French Grand Prix at the wheel of a Ferrari 625.

Manzon then returned to the Gordini team, but found little success in World Championship events. Outside the Championship, he won the 1956 Naples Grand Prix and a sports car race at Pescara.

After racing, he later operated his own diesel equipment distribution business. 

Manzon died at his home in the south of France on 19 January 2015 aged 97. He was the last surviving entrant of the 1950 Formula One season.

<doc id="1226549" wikidata="Q126940" url="?curid=1226549" title="Roberto Guerrero">
<text>Roberto José Guerrero Isaza (born 16 November 1958) is a Colombian-American former race driver. He participated in 29 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 23 January 1982, becoming the first Colombian to start a Formula One Grand Prix.

With no championship points in Formula One and no prospects to drive for a competitive team, Guerrero left at the end of the 1983 season to race in the United States. He had an auspicious beginning to his Indycar racing career, winning both CART and Indianapolis 500 rookie of the year honors in 1984. His initial promise was never completely fulfilled, winning only two CART races, both in 1987. Later the same year he had a massive accident which left him in a coma for 17 days.

Of special note were Guerrero&#x27;s participations in the Indianapolis 500. He came very close to winning outright on two occasions, but bad luck always kept the victory out of his grasp. In 1992 he spun off on the pace lap after having qualified on the pole position. Guerrero finished runner up twice, in the top-five five times, and held the qualifying speed record from 1992 through 1996. Guerrero was also selected to participate in the 1988 International Race of Champions.

Guerrero became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1989. He and his wife have three children and reside in San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, California.

In recent years Guerrero has returned to racing, but of a different venue. He began off-road racing at the legendary Baja 2000. He has since continued to race in Baja 1000 events and guide tours of the Baja Peninsula with Wide Open Baja.

==Early racing==

===Karting===
Guerrero began his racing career in 1972 by competing in kart racing. From 1972 to 1977 he won two national championships in his native Colombia. He also finished third in the 1975 Pan American Karting Championship.

===Jim Russell Driving School===
Guerrero then joined the Jim Russell Racing School in 1977. In the school&#x27;s six events Guerrero managed to win 5 of the races and finished second in the other race.

==Open wheel racing==

===Formula car racing===

====British Formula Ford 1600====
Guerrero began competing in British Formula Ford 1600 in 1978. He took eight wins during the season.

====Formula Three====

=====British Formula 3=====
Guerrero competed in Vandervell British Formula 3 for Angila Cars in an Argo JM3-Toyota. He finished 9th in the standings with 15 points.

Guerrero returned to the series in 1980 with Argo Racing Cars in an Argo JM6-Toyota. During the season he scored five victories at Thruxton Circuit (twice), Cadwell Park, Brands Hatch and Oulton Park. He tied for second in the standings with Kenneth Acheson, each with 95 points.

=====European Formula Three=====
While competing in British Formula 3 Guerrero competed in European Formula Three. He again drove for Angila Cars in an Argo JM3-Toyota. At the end of the season he scored 2 points to finish in 25th place in the championship.

====European Formula Two====
In Guerrero began competing in European Formula Two for Maurer Motorsport in a Maurer MM81-BMW. He won the Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy at the Thruxton Circuit. His next best finishes were a pair of 4th-place finishes at the Gran Premio del Mediterraneo at Enna-Pergusa and the Gran Premio dell&#x27;Adriatico at the Misano Circuit and he finished 7th in the championship with 16 points.

====Formula One====

Guerrero began competing in Formula One in 1982 for Ensign Racing, beginning the season in a No. 14 Café de Colombia/Moda Caribu Ensign N180B-Ford Cosworth DFV at the season-opening South African Grand Prix. He failed to qualify for the event due to Guerrero&#x27;s Formula Two team Maurer Motorsport and its boss Willy Maurer filing an injunction to Ensign team boss Morris Nunn and as a result Guerrero was withdrawn from the race. An official press report from Nunn stated that Guerrero was &quot;in an inappropriate physical and mental condition to drive.&quot; Guerrero returned for the following race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, in a new Ensign N181. He again failed to qualify for the race. Guerrero qualified for the third race of the season, the United States Grand Prix West, starting 19th and finished 15th after crashing 27 laps into the race. Ensign skipped the San Marino Grand Prix due to the FISA–FOCA war and Guerrero then failed to qualify for the Belgian Grand Prix. At the Monaco Grand Prix Ensign&#x27;s tire supplier Avon withdrew from Formula One and that left the team tireless. The team got some older tires to use for the race, but Guerrero failed to qualify. Michelin started supplying tires to the team after Monaco and Guerrero qualified for Michelin&#x27;s first race for the team, the Detroit Grand Prix, starting in a respectable 11th place. In the race Guerrero was involved in a crash 6 laps into the race and was credited with a 19th-place finish. After that, Guerrero then only failed to qualify at the Dutch Grand Prix and the French Grand Prix. Guerrero scored his best finish of 1982 (and his entire Formula One career) at the German Grand Prix with an 8th-place finish. At the season-ending Caesars Palace Grand Prix Guerrero qualified in 15th place. The car&#x27;s engine then blew in the warm up and Guerrero missed the race. Guerrero was unranked in the championship standings due to the fact that he had scored no points.

In 1983 Ensign Racing merged with Theodore Racing and as a result Guerrero began driving the No. 33 Café de Colombia Theodore N183-Ford Cosworth DFV. Guerrero only failed to qualify at the Monaco Grand Prix and became more consistent in finishing races. Despite this Guerrero&#x27;s best finishes were a pair of 12th-place finishes at the Dutch Grand Prix and the European Grand Prix. At the end of the season Guerrero again failed to score points and was as a result unranked in the championship while rookie teammate Johnny Cecotto managed to get a 6th-place finish and with it 1 point towards the championship for himself and Theodore (although Cecotto failed to qualify four times to Guerrero&#x27;s single time).

===Indy car racing===

===CART Indycar World Series===
Guerrero made his Indy car debut in 1984 for Bignotti-Carter Racing in the No. 9 Master Mechanic March 84C-Cosworth DFX with legendary chief mechanic George Bignotti serving as Guerrero&#x27;s chief mechanic. The high point of Guerrero&#x27;s season was a 2nd-place finish at the Indianapolis 500 where he also shared the race&#x27;s rookie of the year award with Michael Andretti. Guerrero&#x27;s best finishes outside of Indianapolis were a pair of 5th-place finishes at the Budweiser Cleveland Grand Prix at Burke Lakefront Airport and the Michigan 500 at Michigan International Speedway. Guerrero finished out the season 11th in points with 52 points, only one point out of the top ten. Guerrero won the series&#x27; rookie of the year award.

In 1985 Bignotti went into retirement and the team was reorganized as Team Cotter with Guerrero driving their No. 9 Master Mechanic/True Value March 85C-Cosworth DFX. Compared to the previous season 1985 was a disappointment highlighted by a 3rd-place finish at the Indianapolis 500 and a 4th at the Stroh&#x27;s 300K at Laguna Seca Raceway. The season also saw Guerrero retire out of a race twice while leading, first at the Michigan 500 at Michigan International Speedway (due to gearbox issues) and then at the Molson Indy 300 at Sanair Super Speedway (due to Guerrero crashing). Guerrero finished the season 17th in points with 34 points.

Guerrero returned with Team Cotter in 1986 to drive their No. 2 True Value/Emerson Electronics March 86C-Cosworth DFX (numbered 5 at Indianapolis only). Guerrero continued his streak of impressive finishes with a 4th place in the race. Guerrero also scored a pair of 2nd-place finishes, first at the Escort Radar Warning 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and the Miami Indy Challenge 200 at Tamiami Park. In the latter Guerrero qualified on pole position and led every lap, except the final lap due to running out of fuel and handing the win to Al Unser Jr. Guerrero finished the season 9th in points with 87 points.

In 1987 Cotter sold the team to Vince Granatelli (son of former Indy car owner Andy Granatelli) to form Vince Granatelli Racing with Guerrero driving the No. 4 True Value/STP March 87C-Cosworth DFX. Guerrero scored his first Indy car win at the Checker 200 at Phoenix International Raceway. In the race Guerrero originally qualified 3rd, but the car was declared illegal and Guerrero started 22nd (last) to charge his way up through the field to win. At the Indianapolis 500 Guerrero and Granatelli were one of the few teams to have no issues with March 87C as several teams decided to use year-old 86C models instead. In the race Guerrero qualified 5th and was viewed as among the favorites, along with pole sitter Mario Andretti and defending winner Bobby Rahal. In the race Rahal retired after 57 laps due to ignition problems and Guerrero was in 2nd place to Andretti for much of the race. On the 130th lap a wheel came off of Tony Bettenhausen&#x27;s car and it hit the nose of Guerrero&#x27;s car and went flying into the grandstand and where it killed spectator Lyle Kurtenbach. On lap 177 Andretti started to have electrical troubles and Guerrero took the lead. On lap 182 Guerrero came in for his final pit stop and as he exited his pit stall the engine stalled. Third gear had been damaged earlier in the race by the Bettenhausen incident and the car began to get moving, only to stop just outside the pit lane. This caused Al Unser Sr. to take the lead and get a lap on Guerrero. Guerrero finally got going and unlapped himself on lap 191 and there was a caution on lap 192 for Andretti stopping on the track. On lap 196 the restart came out with six cars between Unser and Guerrero. Guerrero was unable to get by Unser and ended up finishing 2nd to one of the year-old March 86Cs to be pressed into race service.

===Near-fatal crash and recovery===

After his near-win in Indianapolis, subsequently, Guerrero scored four pole positions at the Miller American 200 in Honor of Rex Mays at the Milwaukee Mile, the Budweiser/G.I. Joe&#x27;s 200 presented by Texaco at Portland International Raceway, Budweiser Grand Prix of Cleveland at Burke Lakefront Airport, and the Escort Radar Warning 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. In the latter Guerrero scored his second (and unbeknownst at the time, last) IndyCar victory. Just days after his Mid-Ohio victory, Guerrero was testing at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, when he crashed and was hit by a tire off of his car. Guerrero was in a coma for seventeen days and did not compete in any more races in 1987. Guerrero finished a career-best 4th in points with 106 points, despite missing the final three races of the season.

Guerrero&#x27;s recovery from his near-fatal accident was documented by IndyCar Medical Director, Dr. Steve Olvey, who said in his biography, &quot;Rapid Response: My Inside-Story as a Motor-Racing Life-Saver&quot;, that he saved Guerrero&#x27;s life by lowering the pressure in his brain with injections of medicines that were brand-new to the medical field and were not widely practiced yet. Somehow, his treatment worked and Guerrero&#x27;s recovery, which only took less than 3 months, led to him studying traumatic brain injuries as his primary focus of study.

===Later career===

In 1988 Guerrero returned with Vince Granatelli Racing and originally drove the No. 2 STP/&quot;&quot; Lola T88/00-Cosworth DFX. At the season-opening Checker 200 at Phoenix International Raceway Guerrero qualified and finished in 2nd place. However, the remainder of the season was mostly a disappointment, such as the Indianapolis 500 where Guerrero qualified 12th and did not even make it through the first lap due to being collected by Scott Brayton. The team even attempted to use a year-old March 87C at select races to no avail. Guerrero&#x27;s only top tens after Indianapolis were the Quaker State 500 at Pocono International Raceway in the Lola and the Bosch Spark Plugs Grand Prix at Nazareth Speedway in the March. After starting 10th at Long Beach Guerrero&#x27;s best start was at Nazareth, where he started 11th. At the end of the season Guerrero finished 12th in points with 40 points, despite skipping two races.

Following the 1988 season Guerrero and Granatelli split for 1989. Guerrero joined Alex Morales Motorsports, who was at the time the factory (and only) team using Alfa Romeo engines. Guerrero drove the No. 21 Alfa Romeo March 89CE-Alfa Romeo Indy V8. The engine ended up being not ready for the start of the season and the team missed the first four races of the year, including the Indianapolis 500. Guerrero was even offered the chance to drive an extra car for Truesports. Guerrero had to decline due to his contract with Alfa Romeo. The team managed to first compete at the Valvoline Detroit Grand Prix on the Streets of Detroit. In the race Guerrero was able to finish 8th. The remainder of the season saw Guerrero score only one additional point due to a 12th-place finish at the Red Roof Inns 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. Guerrero would finish 23rd in points with 6 points.

Prior to 1990 Morales Motorsports closed down and Patrick Racing took over the Alfa Romeo project with Guerrero driving the No. 20 Miller Genuine Draft March 90CA-Alfa Romeo Indy V8. Guerrero managed to qualify for the Indianapolis 500, starting 28th and finishing 23rd due to suspension damage. The team then switched to using a Lola T90/00 starting at the Marlboro 500 at Michigan International Speedway. In the race Guerrero finished in 5th place. At the end of the season Guerrero finished 16th in the points with 24 points.

In 1991 Guerrero was replaced by Danny Sullivan and was left without a car to drive. At the Indianapolis 500 Guerrero drove a second car for Patrick Racing in the No. 40 Sharp&#x27;s Lola T91/00-Alfa Romeo Indy V8. He qualified 28th and finished 30th after being involved in a crash with Kevin Cogan on Guerrero&#x27;s 24th lap. Guerrero then drove three select races for King Racing in the No. 26 Quaker State Lola T91/00-Buick V6, scoring a best finish of 14th at the Valvoline Detroit Grand Prix on the Streets of Detroit and the Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of Denver at the Pepsi Center. Guerrero finally drove the No. 50 Fendi/Hawaiian Tropic Lola T91/00-Cosworth DFS at the Molson Indy Toronto at Exhibition Place, qualifying and finishing in 18th place. Guerrero scored no points for the first time in his CART career and finished 37th in the championship.

For 1992 Guerrero drove in a pair of races for the part-time team King Racing, first driving the No. 26 Quaker State Lola T91/00-Buick V6 at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on the Streets of Long Beach, starting 14th and finishing 13th. At the Indianapolis 500 King updated Guerrero to a Lola T92/00-Buick V6 and the number was changed to 36 (Jim Crawford began to drive the No. 26 car). During qualifying Guerrero set a new four-lap track record of 232.482 mph and a new one-lap record of 232.618 mph on the third lap. Guerrero qualified on pole position and became the first part-time driver to qualify on the pole since Pancho Carter in 1985. In the race Guerrero spun out and crashed on the backstretch during the second parade lap and did not even get to start the race, being credited with 33rd (last) place. Guerrero joined Cliff Woodbury in 1929 and Carter in 1985 as drivers who started first in the Indianapolis 500 and finished last; they were later joined by Greg Ray in 2000 and Scott Sharp in 2001. Guerrero finished 38th in the championship with 1 point.

In 1993 King Racing expanded to a full-time schedule with Guerrero driving their No. 40 Budweiser Lola T93/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8 265C. At the Indianapolis 500 Guerrero qualified 10th and finished 28th after being involved in a crash with Jeff Andretti after 125 laps. During the year Guerrero and King consistently qualified in the mid-pack, with a best start of 4th at the Valvoline 200 at Phoenix International Raceway. Guerrero&#x27;s best finish was also a 4th at the New England 200 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Following the Molson Indy Vancouver at Concord Pacific Place King released Guerrero. Guerrero finished 14th in the championship with 39 points (he was 13th in the championship at the time of his release).

In 1994 Guerrero could only get a car to drive at the Indianapolis 500 with Pagan Racing (the same team who owned the car that Jeff Andretti crashed into Guerrero the previous year) in their No. 21 Interstate Batteries Lola T92/00-Buick V6. The chassis was the same chassis that Guerrero drove in 1992. Guerrero qualified 20th and finished 33rd (last) due to a crash after 20 laps. He scored no points and tied for 54th in the championship.

In 1995 Guerrero returned with Pagan Racing in their No. 21 Upper Deck Reynard 94i-Ilmor-Mercedes-Benz IC108B. Guerrero first raced at the Slick 50 200 at Phoenix International Raceway, starting 25th and finishing 16th. The team then competed in the Indianapolis 500, where Guerrero qualified in a respectable 13th place and finished in 12th place. Guerrero finished the season 33rd in the championship with 1 point.

====Indy Racing League====
In 1996 Guerrero and Pagan Racing began competing full-time in the newly formed Indy Racing League with Guerrero driving the No. 21 WavePhore Reynard 94i-Ford Cosworth XB, with additional sponsorship coming from Johnny Lightning (at Disney), Newscast (at Phoenix) and Pennzoil (at Indianapolis). At the season-opening Indy 200 at Walt Disney World at Walt Disney World Speedway Guerrero qualified 2nd and finished 5th. At the Dura Lube 200 at Phoenix International Raceway Guerrero qualified 3rd and finished 16th due to a broken cv joint. At the Indianapolis 500 the team updated to a Reynard 95i and Guerrero qualified 6th and led for a race-high 47 laps and battled for the win with Tony Stewart, Arie Luyendyk, Davy Jones, Alessandro Zampedri and eventual winner Buddy Lazier. On Guerrero&#x27;s final pit stop on lap 167 he and Lazier came into the pits. While in the pits the nozzle was connected awkwardly and fuel began to spill out. The car then began to catch fire and Guerrero began to climb out of the car when it was determined to be okay to continue racing. Guerrero fell out of contention and went a lap down. On the final lap of the race, as Lazier and Jones crossed the finish line, Guerrero lost control of his car in turn 4 and took out 4th place Zampedri (who was on the lead lap) and 6th place Eliseo Salazar (who was two laps down) and caused Zampedri to get airborne and flip. Guerrero came to a rest inside the pit lane, just past the entrance. Guerrero finished 4th in the championship with 237 points.

During the 1996 portion of the 1996-1997 season Guerrero continued to drive for Pagan Racing in the No. 21 Pennzoil Reynard 95i-Ford Cosworth XB. At the season-opening True Value 200 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway Guerrero started 18th and finished 6th. Guerrero then drove a Reynard 94i at the Las Vegas 500K at Las Vegas Motor Speedway to start 9th and finish a season-best 4th. Starting at the Indy 200 at Walt Disney World Speedway the series began to use a different type of spec car with Guerrero driving the No. 21 Pennzoil Dallara IR7-Nissan Infiniti Q45 for Pagan Racing. The Infiniti engine was usually slower than the competing Oldsmobile engine and Guerrero&#x27;s best race with the engine was the Phoenix 200 at Phoenix International Raceway, where he started 10th and finished 7th. At the Indianapolis 500 Guerrero qualified in 19th place and finished 27th after retiring due to a suspension failure after 25 laps with Guerrero running as high as 11th place. Starting with the Samsonite 200 at Pikes Peak International Raceway the team switched to the Oldsmobile Aurora Indy V8. Guerrero&#x27;s best finish with the Oldsmobile engine came at the Pennzoil 200 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway with a 6th-place finish. At the season-ending Las Vegas 500K at Las Vegas Motor Speedway Guerrero suffered a major accident on lap 201 on the backstretch. Guerrero flipped coming off of turn 2 and flipped into the grass area next to the racetrack. He climbed out of his destroyed car just moments after the accident finished. Guerrero finished the season ranked 7th in points with 221 points.

In 1998 Pagan Racing was left without a sponsor when the team&#x27;s chief mechanic, John Barnes, formed his own team called Panther Racing using Pagan&#x27;s former Pennzoil sponsorship. Guerrero drove the No. 21 Pagan Racing Dallara IR8-Oldsmobile Aurora Indy V8. At the season-opening Indy 200 at Walt Disney World Speedway Guerrero qualified 6th and finished 26th after retiring due to a crash after 13 laps. At the Indianapolis 500 Guerrero won the Scott Brayton Award for best showing the spirit of the deceased driver. In the race Guerrero started 9th and finished 22nd, 75 laps down. Following the True Value 500 at Texas Motor Speedway Pagan released Guerrero. Guerrero then joined Cobb Racing to drive the No. 23 CBR G-Force IR01-Nissan Infiniti Q45. Guerrero finished 4th at the Lone Star 500 at Texas Motor Speedway. Guerrero finished 26th in the championship with 83 points.

In 1999 Guerrero returned with Cobb Racing in the No. 50 Cobb Racing G-Force IR01-Nissan Infiniti Q45. Guerrero&#x27;s best finish of the season was a 13th-place finish at the season-opening Transworld Diversified Services 200 at Walt Disney World Speedway. The team closed down following the Indianapolis 500 where Guerrero started and finished 25th. After Indianapolis Guerrero was ranked 17th in points. He eventually finished 30th in the championship with 36 points.

For 2000 Guerrero managed to get a one-off race for A. J. Foyt Enterprises in the No. 41 Harrah&#x27;s Dallara IR00-Oldsmobile Aurora Indy V8. Guerrero was unable to qualify for the race, making it the first time since 1989 that he failed to start the Indianapolis 500. Guerrero later competed in the Belterra Resort Indy 300 at Kentucky Speedway for Team Coulson in the No. 40 Team Coulson G-Force GF01-Oldsmobile Aurora Indy V8. In the race Guerrero started 25th and finished 23rd after retiring after 48 laps due to engine troubles in what would be his final Indy car race. Guerrero finished the season 44th in the championship with 7 points.

In 2001 Guerrero had no team at the beginning of practice for the Indianapolis 500. Dick Simon Racing then needed a driver for their No. 7 Yellow Transportation Dallara IR01-Oldsmobile Aurora Indy V8 after Stéphan Grégoire left the team. Guerrero eventually managed to qualify the car. On the final day of qualifying Grégoire began driving for Heritage Motorsports and bumped Guerrero from the field and Guerrero failed to qualify for the second consecutive year.

Guerrero was reported to be searching for a car to drive in the 2002 Indianapolis 500, although nothing materialized. He eventually retired from racing by 2003.

==Stock car racing==

===International Race of Champions===
In 1988 Guerrero was among the drivers chosen to compete in IROC XII (International Race of Champions) to be among the drivers to represent CART/PPG World Series (other drivers to represent CART were Al Unser Jr., Al Unser Sr. and Bobby Rahal) based on his performance in 1987. Guerrero drove an identical Chevrolet Camaro, like all other participants. He missed the season-opening race at Daytona International Speedway due to his injuries received the previous year at an Indianapolis Motor Speedway test. Guerrero qualified on the pole position for the second and third races of the season at Riverside International Raceway and Michigan International Speedway. At Riverside Guerrero crashed after 10 laps and finished in 11th place and at Michigan he finished 10th after leading for 4 laps. At the season-ending race at Watkins Glen International Guerrero started 12th and finished 11th, 10 laps down. At the end of the season Guerrero finished 12th (last) in the championship with 19 points, earning $30,400 for his efforts during the season.

===NASCAR===
Guerrero attempted to compete in the NASCAR Busch Series during the 2000 season at the Carquest Auto Parts 300 at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway for the Hispanic Racing Team in their No. 72 HRT Motorsports Chevrolet Monte Carlo but failed to qualify for the event. He returned during the 2002 season after his Indy car career was finished, again with the Hispanic Racing Team in their No. 09 Ciclon Energy Drink Chevrolet Monte Carlo at the Aaron&#x27;s 312 at Atlanta Motor Speedway but again failed to qualify for the race.

==Announcing==

<doc id="1226554" wikidata="Q171427" url="?curid=1226554" title="Roberto Moreno">
<text>Roberto Pupo Moreno (born 11 February 1959), usually known as Roberto Moreno and also as Pupo Moreno, is a Brazilian former racing driver. He participated in 75 Formula One Grands Prix, achieved 1 podium, and scored a total of 15 championship points. He raced in CART in 1986, and was Formula 3000 champion (in 1988) before joining Formula One full-time in 1989. He returned to CART in 1996 where he enjoyed an Indian summer in 2000 and 2001, and managed to extend his career in the series until 2008. He also raced in endurance events and GT&#x27;s in Brazil, but now works as a driver coach and consultant, and although this takes up a lot of his time, he is not officially retired yet, as he appears in historic events. Away from the sport, he enjoys building light aeroplanes.

Moreno was known as the &quot;Super Sub&quot; late in his career as he was used to replace injured drivers several times.

==Career==

===Early career===
After winning the 1976 Brazilian 125cc Karting championship, Moreno set his sights on getting to Europe. He arrived in England in 1979, to race in his first season in Formula Ford. He did some races with Marc Smith racing who was the works Royale driver for that year. Marc had a two car transporter to take his and Roberto&#x27;s car. Roberto was the driver and the mechanic for his Royale car. Ralt owner/designer Ron Tauranac lent Moreno an old shed to work out of as his home base. He had a couple of good results, and these convinced Ralph Firman Sr, to sign him as a works Van Diemen driver for the 1980 season. Whilst driving for Firman, he would win the Townsend Thoresen British Formula Ford title, winning eight races in the process. Meanwhile, in Europe, he drove the same car to three more victories, earning himself second place in the EFDA Townsend Thoresen Euroseries Formula Ford 1600 Championship. His also finished 4th in the RAC British series and 6th the P&amp;O Ferries series. He then rounded out the season by winning the Formula Ford Festival. Moreno would return to race at the Formula Ford Festival in the same car at the 50th anniversary of the Festival in 2021.

Moreno&#x27;s success alerted the attention of no lesser person than Colin Chapman, the successful owner and founder of Formula One&#x27;s Team Lotus. Roberto only returned to Europe in 1981, because Chapman had given him a F1 testing contract with enough money to continue racing. With these funds, he raced Formula Three, but money was tight. Despite that, paired with Barron Racing, he managed to win two races, however he was more successful across the Atlantic the following season, racing in the CASC North American Formula Atlantic Championship, defeating Al Unser Jr. in a supporting race at the 1982 United States Grand Prix West in Long Beach. Later in 1982, he made another big impression by winning the Grand Prix de Trois-Rivières. Prior to that victory, Moreno had found some money to do half a season in the British Formula 3 Championship with Ivens Lumar Racing, winning three races in the process, before he was given the opportunity to drive at the 1982 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort for Lotus, though he ultimately failed to qualify.

===Australian Grand Prix (1981–1984)===

In this period, Moreno (who like his friend Nelson Piquet was managed by Australian Greg &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Siddle) was a popular triple winner of the Australian Grand Prix in 1981, 1983 and 1984, before it became a Formula One World Championship race from 1985. These wins came in the days when the Grand Prix was a Formula Mondial race held at Melbourne&#x27;s 1.6 km (1.0 mi) Calder Park Raceway. He often defeated current or past World Drivers&#x27; Champions to win the AGP, including Piquet, Alan Jones, Niki Lauda and Keke Rosberg, as well as other F1 drivers such as Jacques Laffite, Andrea de Cesaris and François Hesnault. In the only Australian Grand Prix he competed in but did not win during the period (1982), he finished third behind future four time World Champion Alain Prost, and Ligier F1 driver Laffite. In all of his pre-F1 Australian Grand Prix drives, Moreno drove a Formula Pacific or Formula Mondial Ralt RT4 powered by a 1.6 litre Ford 4cyl engine.

===F1 substitute (1982 and 1987)===

Moreno was winning races in Formula Atlantic, Formula Mondial and Formula Three, when he received a call-up from Colin Chapman to stand in for Nigel Mansell at Lotus at the 1982 Dutch Grand Prix after Mansell broke his wrist in the previous Grand Prix in Canada. Prior to this, Theodore Racing&#x27;s Jan Lammers broke a thumb during the Detroit Grand Prix and team owner Teddy Yip wanted Moreno to take over the seat, however Chapman refused to release him. Then during the race in Montréal, Mansell injured his wrist, allowing for Moreno to stand in. This soon turned into a nightmare, as the Lotus 91 was a beast to handle, Moreno had barely driven the car, as regular drivers, Mansell and Elio de Angelis did most of the testing, with Moreno being restricted to the older Lotus 87B and Lotus 88 models. Moreno failed to come to grips with the Lotus 91, with his best qualifying lap over two seconds away from making the grid. At the end of 1982, Lotus released him from his duties as test driver and it took his reputation a while to recover from this poor showing.

He was to get another chance, but that Dutch race handicapped him for a number of years. At the end of the season he was called up to replace Pascal Fabre for the AGS team at the Japanese Grand Prix. Five years after the Lotus fiasco, Moreno was set to make his debut, except he was the slowest of all and once again did not qualify. However, Williams driver Nigel Mansell injured himself during practice and the team subsequently withdrew his entry, thus letting Moreno in for his debut Grand Prix. In the following race, the Australian Grand Prix, he drove the ungainly JH22 between the walls of the Adelaide Street Circuit to finish a fine 7th, while others hit the walls and broke their cars. Following post-race scrutineering, Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus-Honda was disqualified from 2nd for oversized brake ducts and Moreno was promoted to 6th place, scoring his, and the team&#x27;s, first-ever point in Formula One.

===In between years===

Moreno went back to North America with Siddle. A sponsor had been found for a whole season of Formula Atlantic, but the support race at Long Beach GP was changed to a Super Vee, then he lost his sponsor. Despite the set-back, his new team, Theodore Racing went off and won the first race at Willow Springs. With the prize money, he did two more races, before the team stopped racing. Luckily for Moreno, the team owner, Teddy Yip help finance a move to another team. He won four races, while championship rival, Michael Andretti won three. Moreno missed out on the title as every time he won, Andretti would finish second.

For 1984, Roberto decided to return to Europe to race F3. Whilst pre-season testing with West Surrey Racing, he got an invitation from Tauranac to join the works Ralt Formula Two team. Moreno finished runner-up to Mike Thackwell, the pair dominated the final European Formula Two Championship, in their Ralt-Hondas. He tasted victory at the Hockenheim and Donington Park races. Tauranac wanted Moreno to stay for the inaugural International Formula 3000 season (1985), but Moreno had been testing the Toleman at the end of 1984, with Senna&#x27;s car. He look set to get a drive with the team, only to be told that they did not have any tyres, and the deal fell through. A move to Indycars was next for Roberto with Rick Galles&#x27;s Galles Racing, as he had seen Moreno impress frequently. The deal was for Roberto to drive in the road race. He was invited to do a full campaign in 1986, however they had problems with the car and did not have any good results. When he was unable to find a full-time Indycar drive, he decided to try to get into F3000 driving with Ralt. During that season, he won Gran Premio del Mediterraneo, together with some consistent finishing saw him finished 3rd overall, before receiving the call to join up with AGS.

Moreno almost joined the Brabham Formula One team in . On the suggestion of his friend, Brabham lead driver and defending World Champion Nelson Piquet, Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone almost signed the young Brazilian to drive the team&#x27;s #2 car. However, this opportunity for Moreno came to nothing when Brabham&#x27;s Italian based sponsor Parmalat insisted on having an Italian driver as Piquet&#x27;s teammate. This led to the unique situation where Ecclestone signed brothers Teo and Corrado Fabi to share the drive in the car. Teo was the main driver, but as he was already contracted to race in the United States based CART/PPG World Series for Forsythe Racing, Corrado, who had driven for Osella in , substituted for him in 3 races where the respective F1 and CART schedules clashed.

His performance at AGS did not get him a seat in F1. He went to Bromley Motorsport in F3000. The team, owned by Ron Salt, had Gary Anderson as its Technical Director, with whom Roberto had worked with at Galles. With help from Reynard Motorsport, they began the season with virtually no money. Revenge was sweet, when Moreno took a sponsorless Reynard-Cosworth 88D to the title by winning three early-season races, at Pau, Silverstone and Monza in a row. A fourth win came in the Birmingham Superprix.

===F1 substitute (1989–1995)===

Not even winning the FIA International Formula 3000 Championship in 1988 in an unsponsored Reynard 88D made the impression needed for a big team to recruit him. Instead, he signed a testing contract with Ferrari, who helped him land a racing drive with the ambitious Coloni outfit. The car was never competitive and Moreno only made the grid four times out of 16 attempts.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://8w.forix.com/moreno.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, 1990 seemed to be even less promising, with Moreno signing for the nosediving EuroBrun outfit, qualifying for just 2 out of the first 14 races of the season. However, shortly after being informed the team would not be competing in the last two rounds of the season, he was contacted by Benetton to drive their second car, with Alessandro Nannini having almost lost a hand in a helicopter crash following the Spanish Grand Prix. After qualifying 8th, he then shadowed his teammate, Piquet, coming home an excellent 2nd on his Benetton debut in the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, although this result was helped by most other top cars dropping out, with Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna famously colliding at the first corner while their teammates Nigel Mansell (Ferrari) and Gerhard Berger (McLaren) would both retire. After then again qualifying 8th in the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide before going on to finish 7th (Piquet again won), Moreno got a full contract with Benetton for 1991 season.

However, the Benetton B191, on Pirelli tyres, was not as competitive as anticipated, and Moreno&#x27;s best results were 4th place at the Monaco Grand Prix and the Belgian Grand Prix. In the latter race, Moreno made the fastest lap, but this was overshadowed by F1 debutant Michael Schumacher (driving for the Jordan team); this would be Moreno&#x27;s last race for Benetton before he was controversially paid off and dropped in favour of Schumacher. Schumacher had qualified 7th, and was up to 5th after the start when his clutch failed. The Benetton management, led by Tom Walkinshaw and team manager Flavio Briatore, were after a driver to rebuild the team around, convinced that neither the aging Piquet or Moreno were that driver. Briatore and Walkinshaw engaged in some high-level dealing behind the scenes and managed to steal Schumacher from Jordan and Moreno was promptly fired. There are rumours to this day that Moreno was purposely driving within himself for the whole season in order to not show Piquet up (Piquet later admitted on Brazilian television in 2012 that after his qualifying accident at Imola in in which he lost around 80% of his depth perception, he only stayed in Formula One &quot;for the money&quot;). As it was, Moreno was offered the vacant Jordan drive for the 1991 Italian Grand Prix, where he qualified a very respectable 9th (ahead of teammate Andrea de Cesaris). Unfortunately he spun off on the second lap and retired. He would race the next race in Portugal, and then replaced Gianni Morbidelli in the Minardi, at the last race of the year in Adelaide, but Formula One seemed to have passed him by.

For the 1992 season, he found himself back with the minnows, signing for Andrea Moda. The outfit had risen from the ashes of Scuderia Coloni, and after two non-starting races with Alex Caffi and Enrico Bertaggia, decided to start over with Moreno and Perry McCarthy (who would later claim fame as the original Stig on the BBC motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot;). Moreno and McCarthy faced an uphill struggle, with the uncompetitive team scrambling to even get to most races. Moreno would only qualify the under-tested, under-funded car once, for the Monaco Grand Prix, before the team collapsed following team owner Andrea Sassetti&#x27;s arrest at the Belgian Grand Prix.

After the Andrea Moda disaster, he spent the next two seasons racing Italian and French Touring Cars, and also attempted to qualify for the 1994 Indianapolis 500. 1995 saw Moreno making a brief Formula One comeback, with the ambitious Forti team. Moreno&#x27;s Brazilian heritage helped him land the drive. Sadly, their car was comparatively slow, and Moreno&#x27;s best result was 14th in the Belgian Grand Prix. He would exit Formula One crashing into the pitlane wall at the Australian Grand Prix.

===IndyCar===

1996 would see Moreno resume his Champ Car career, as he raced a Payton-Coyne Racing Lola-Ford, finishing 3rd at Michigan. At the beginning of 1997, he quit Payton-Coyne for its lack of commitment. He drove for three teams during the 1997 season, earning the nickname &quot;Supersub&quot;, with his best result of 5th at Detroit in a Newman-Haas Swift-Ford. Here, he replaced an injured Christian Fittipaldi. He outqualified the team leader, Michael Andretti on several occasions, but still could not pick up a competitive drive for 1998, instead accepting a testing role with Penske.

1998 was more barren, with just three drives. The following season again saw him take two different cars (Newman/Haas and PacWest), with two 4th places his best. In 1999 he also made his first Indy Racing League start at Phoenix International Raceway finishing 6th and returned to the Indianapolis 500 after a 13 year absence finishing 20th for Truscelli Team Racing. Only in 2000, having subbed for Patrick Racing in the previous season, Roberto was granted a full-time seat in one of their Reynard Motorsport-Fords, and he led the series for much of the distance, before hitting a low patch, and losing out to Gil de Ferran, eventually ranking 3rd overall.

Moreno won his first Champ Car race at Cleveland, and in a scene scarcely seen in motor racing, the emotional Moreno wept openly. It had been his first race victory since his Formula 3000 victory twelve years earlier. He won again for Patrick Racing at Vancouver the following year, but was less consistent and dropped to 13th in the standings.

In 2003 he drove for Herdez Competition, taking his Lola-Cosworth to 2nd at Miami, and announced his retirement from motorsport at the end of the year.
In April 2006, after just one outing in a Brazilian Stock Car at Jacarepaguá, Moreno substituted for Ed Carpenter at Vision Racing, in the Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg.

In August of the same year, Moreno became the first driver to test the new Panoz-built Champ Car. According to former series champion Paul Tracy, &quot;[Moreno&#x27;s] a guy who&#x27;s not going to go out there and make mistakes and go off the road. They need to put miles on the car and run it fairly quickly, and he&#x27;s the perfect guy for the job.&quot;

After running thousands of miles of testing in the Panoz DP01, Moreno got a chance to race it at the 2007 Grand Prix of Houston, substituting for the injured Alex Figge at Pacific Coast Motorsports.

Roberto drove as a replacement for an injured Stéphan Grégoire at the 2007 Indianapolis 500 for Chastain Motorsports. He crashed the car early in the race and finished in last place.

==Helmet==
Moreno&#x27;s helmet has traditionally been yellow, with blue, red, and white wings adorning the visor, sides, and chin area. Written on the lower portion of the helmet is the name &quot;Moreno.&quot; Later versions of his helmet have included blue cylindrical designs along with the wings. His helmets are designed by Sid Mosca.

<text>Rolf Johann Stommelen (; 11 July 1943 – 24 April 1983) was a German racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . In endurance racing, Stommelen was a four-time winner of the 24 Hours of Daytona with Porsche.

Stommelen participated in 63 Formula One Grands Prix, achieving one podium and 14 championship points. He also participated in several non-championship Formula One races. He was widely successful in sports car racing from the mid-1960s until his death in 1983, winning the 24 Hours of Daytona four times: in 1968, 1978, 1980 and 1982. He also won the 1967 Targa Florio with Porsche.

==Early and personal life==
Rolf Johann Stommelen was born on 11 July 1943 in Siegen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Nazi Germany.

==Career==
Stommelen won the pole position for the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Porsche 917 a year after finishing third in a Porsche 908. In this year, he became the first man to reach speeds exceeding on the Le Mans circuit&#x27;s Mulsanne Straight in his Porsche 917 LH. In 1970, he made his Formula One debut with Brabham with sponsorship obtained from the German magazine &quot;Auto, Motor und Sport&quot; and raced both sportscars (Toj and Porsche works teams) and Formula 1 throughout the 1970s.

He inadvertently played a role in the end of the Spanish Grand Prix&#x27;s tenure at Montjuich Park in Barcelona when he crashed there in the 1975 race after the rear wing of his Hill GH1 failed which caused his car to fly into the crowd, resulting in the deaths of five spectators and him being seriously injured.

After his recovery, Stommelen returned to sports car racing, winning races for Alfa Romeo and also winning the 24 Hours of Daytona a further three times.

In 1976 Stommelen had the honour to drive the maiden race of the Porsche 936 at the 300 km Nürburgring race. With a black body and without the air-intake, the 936 of this race became known as the black widow. He qualified second, between the factory Renault Alpine A442 of Patrick Depailler and Jean-Pierre Jabouille in first and third. The Renault team was eager to win at Porsche&#x27;s home soil. On race-day in heavy rain, Stommelen managed to overtake the Renault in front right after the start. Now in the lead, he rushed towards the Nordkehre, braked and deliberately left room for the Renaults in pursuit to overtake. The Renaults, wanting to take back the lead after 2 of 300 km, rushed past Stommelen into the water puddles and crashed into the catch-fences in tandem, with Stommelen taking back the lead again. This led to the saying &quot;On the Nordschleife, you can never brake later than Rolf Stommelen!&quot;. After the sixth lap, the throttle cable of the 936 stuck in the &quot;open&quot; position. But instead of giving up, Stommelen continued the race by turning off the master switch at the bends to brake, and turning on the master switch again after the bends to accelerate throughout the rest of the race, taking second place at the end of the race.

In 1978 he was given the task by the Porsche factory to drive the Porsche 935 &quot;Moby Dick&quot; in Martini Colors. The 78 &quot;Moby Dick&quot; had a 3.2-litre Turbo Engine that produced 845 HP and Stommelen was, with 235 mph, (365 km/h) the fastest man on the Mulsanne Straight, faster than the prototypes like the Porsche 936 and the Renault Alpine A442B which won the race. Due to high fuel-consumption of the engine, Stommelen had to pit too often to battle for the win.

He continued at Le Mans with the Porsche 935, nearly winning the 24 hours of Le Mans with Dick Barbour and actor Paul Newman as co-drivers in 1979, only to be set back by a 23-minute-long pit stop caused by a stuck wheel nut. The team would not have come so far, if Stommelen had not been constantly seconds faster than his team mates each lap.

He also drove Toj SC320 prototype sportscars with some success against the works Alfa team (Toj was a small German manufacturer).

He also competed in one NASCAR Grand National series event in 1971 at Talladega Superspeedway in a former Holman-Moody Ford which Mario Andretti used to win the 1967 Daytona 500, which was rebuilt by Robert Gee (Dale Earnhardt Jr.&#x27;s grandfather) as a Mercury Cyclone, with Jake Elder as crew chief. That car eventually was sold to independent driver Darrell Waltrip to use a year later in his Cup Series debut in 1972, which is how it stands today in the latter&#x27;s museum.

He was also active in the German GT Championship Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft, winning the championship in 1977 for the Gelo Racing Team in a Porsche 935. A master at the Nürburgring, he was a constant winner of races held there.

In the 1980s he was still a sought after prototype pilot and achieved success driving the Kremer CK5, Lancia LC1 and Porsche 956 cars.

==Death==

Stommelen was killed in a crash during the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix 6 hour International Motor Sports Association GT Championship event at Riverside International Raceway on 24 April 1983. He was competing in a John Fitzpatrick entered Porsche 935 with co-driver Derek Bell. Stommelen had just taken over the car from Bell and was running in second place when the rear wing broke due to mechanical failure at 190 mph (306 km/h). The car became uncontrollable, slammed against a concrete wall, somersaulted and caught fire. Stommelen died of blunt force trauma, crushed chest and head injuries.

<doc id="1226559" wikidata="Q3147302" url="?curid=1226559" title="Ian Malcolm (politician)">
<text>Sir Ian Zachary Malcolm, 17th Laird of Poltalloch, KCMG (3 September 1868 – 28 December 1944) was a Conservative Member of Parliament and Chieftain of the Clan Malcolm/MacCallum.

==Background and early life==
Malcolm was born in 1868, the son of Colonel Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th of Poltalloch (1837–1930). His father&#x27;s elder brother was Conservative politician John Wingfield Malcolm, Baron Malcolm of Poltalloch (1833–1902), who died childless and left the Malcolm estate to his brother Edward, from whom it came to Sir Ian on his father&#x27;s death in 1930.

He was educated at St Peter&#x27;s School, York, Eton College and New College, Oxford.

==Career==
Malcolm served as a Justice of the Peace (Argyll, 1898) and as MP for Stowmarket from 1895 to 1906, Croydon from 1910 to 1918 and Croydon South from 1918 to 1919. His Labour opponent in the 1918 General Election was H.T. Muggeridge, the father of Malcolm Muggeridge.

Malcolm held many diplomatic and political appointments. He travelled extensively in British India in 1901 to 1902; visited the North-West Frontier Province and Rajputana! and accompanied Lord Curzon of Kedleston, Viceroy of India, on his tour through Burma in late 1901. He was a British Red Cross Officer during the First World War in France, Switzerland, Russia and the United States. In April to May 1917 he was a member of the Balfour Mission, which was intended to promote co-operation between the United States and the United Kingdom during the First World War. He was private secretary to Arthur Balfour at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, when he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG).

==Family==

On 30 June 1902 at St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, he married Jeanne Langtry, daughter of Lillie Langtry, the famous actress. Breaking all tradition, the bride was given away by her mother. Unfortunately, Malcolm&#x27;s family was far from impressed by their new daughter-in-law&#x27;s mother—it is likely they were highly aware that Jeanne Marie&#x27;s father was not Lillie Langtry&#x27;s first husband, Edward Langtry, but Prince Louis of Battenberg.

Lillie saw less and less of her daughter. Jeanne and Sir Ian lived alternately in a house in Belgravia, London, or at the Malcolm&#x27;s family seat at Poltalloch in Scotland.

They had four children: George Ian (who later succeeded as 18th Laird of Poltalloch) (1903–1976); Victor Neill (the first husband of the actress Ann Todd) (1905–1977) and Angus Christian Edward (1908–1971); and Helen Mary (1918–2010). Mary later became one of the first two female announcers on the BBC Television Service (now BBC One) from 1948 to 1956, during which time she became a household name in the UK. She died on 13 October 2010 at the age of 92.

==Publications==

Sir Ian was the author of a number of books, including: &quot;A Persian Pastoral&quot; (poetry), &quot;Highland Lore and Legend&quot;, Paraphrased by I. Malcolm (in verse), &quot;Indian Pictures and Problems&quot;, &quot;Lord Balfour&quot;, &quot;Poets at Play&quot; (parodies), &quot;Songs of the Clachan&quot;, &quot;Stuff and Nonsense: a book of war verses&quot;, &quot;The Calendar of Empire&quot;, other essays: &quot;Vacant Thrones&quot;, &quot;Verses for Music&quot;, and &quot;War Pictures behind the Lines&quot;.

He also edited &quot;Convicted&quot;, a record of disloyal speeches, resolutions, leaflets and posters, published in Ireland and the USA between 1880 and 1911.

<text>Roy Francesco Salvadori (12 May 1922 – 3 June 2012) was a British racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . In endurance racing, Salvadori won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Aston Martin.

Born in Dovercourt to parents of Italian descent, Salvadori began competing in Grand Prix motor racing after World War II. His early career successes at tracks such as Silverstone and Snetterton earned him the nickname &quot;King of the [[Class A airfield#Post-war motorsport use|Airfields]]&quot;. He graduated to Formula One by 1952 and competed regularly until 1962 for a succession of teams including Cooper, Vanwall, BRM, Aston Martin and Connaught. Also a competitor in other formulae, he won the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans in an Aston Martin with co-driver Carroll Shelby.

In 47 starts he achieved two F1 Championship podium finishes: third place at the 1958 British Grand Prix and second place at that year&#x27;s German Grand Prix, and won non-championship races in Australia, New Zealand and England. In 1961 he was lying second in the United States Grand Prix when his Cooper&#x27;s engine failed. At the end of 1962 he retired from F1, and stopped racing altogether a couple of years later to concentrate on the motor trade. He returned to the sport in 1966 to manage the Cooper-Maserati squad for two seasons, and eventually retired to Monaco.

==Racing career==

===Early career===
With his ambition thwarted by World War II, Salvadori began his career in 1946, racing purely for pleasure, in minor events, in a MG and an ex-Brooklands offset Riley racer before stepping up to an ex-Tazio Nuvolari Alfa Romeo P3 in 1947. It was with this car, he raced in the 1947 Grand Prix des Frontières, where late into the race, his Alfa would remain stuck in top gear. Despite this, Salvadori still cruised home to record an impressive fifth place. He then decided to become a professional racing driver, and drove a number of different makes as his career progressed.

In the May 1951 BRDC International Trophy race at Silverstone, Salvadori had a serious accident when his Frazer Nash Le Mans Replica somersaulted two and a half times, ejecting him into the hay bales. He was in a critical condition, suffering a fractured skull and other severe injuries which left him so close to death he was given the last rites.

===King of the Airfields===
Salvadori knew his limitations, and realized that chasing the likes of Stirling Moss at circuits like steeply cambered, high-banked Dundrod or Pescara, with its blind bends and flat-out blinds, was futile, verging on suicidal. Though he was not alone in that, he became known as &quot;King of the Airfields&quot;, accumulating wins at Silverstone, Snetterton and flat English airfield tracks.

Salvadori twice won the Oulton Park&#x27;s International Gold Cup where there were plenty of trees to hit and a lake to plunge into, which he did once driving a Jaguar Mk.II 3.8 saloon. Nor was the Le Mans Mulsanne Straight at night a place for the careless or nervous, nevertheless he scored his most notable success there in an Aston Martin DBR1/300 in 1959.

Salvadori&#x27;s association with tractor magnate David Brown and his Feltham-built Aston Martin sports cars, GTs and F1 underscored his career; he joined Brown&#x27;s team in mid-1953, and would label his 1963 defeat of Ferrari&#x27;s 250 GTO at Monza in its DP214 in the Inter-Europa Cup, as his favourite victory.

===Formula One===

Salvadori recovered sufficiently from his Silverstone accident to make his first entry into Grand Prix racing in 1952 when he drove a two-litre four cylinder Ferrari 500 in the British Grand Prix for G. Caprara, finishing eighth, three laps down. He would continue to race the Ferrari, winning the Joe Fry Memorial Trophy. For the 1953 season, Salvadori joined the Connaught team and competed in five Grands Prix with the Connaught &quot;A type&quot; but retired from all of them. However, he did secured a number of non-championship victories during the season.

Between 1954 and 1956 Salvadori drove a Maserati 250F in Formula One for Syd Greene&#x27;s Gilby Engineering team, taking a numerous good results in predominantly non-championship F1 races, with one entry for Officine Alfieri Maserati in the 1954 Swiss Grand Prix where he did not start and the car was driven by Sergio Mantovani. It was in the 1956 RAC British Grand Prix at Silverstone when only a similarly 250F mounted Moss shaded him and a possible victory was lost to a fuel line problem, marked him out as a potential top-level driver. However, he remained particularly active in domestic motor sport and in sports cars for Aston Martin.

Following his Championship debut in 1952, Salvadori would experience retirement after retirement. Out of the ten races contested between 1953 and 1956, he would retire early in every single one of them. But this all changed in 1957, when he signed with Cooper achieving only one fifth place at RAC British Grand Prix. However, 1958 (as teammate to Jack Brabham) was his most successful season, finishing fourth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship for Cooper, behind Mike Hawthorn, Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks. Over the course of the season, he would earn two podium finishes, including a second place in the German Grand Prix. However he was not retained by Cooper for 1959 (when Brabham would win the first of his titles) but drove a privately entered Cooper, as well as the works Aston Martin, in which he achieved two sixth-place finishes. The Aston Martin was a traditional front engined car, which was soon outclassed by the Cooper rear engined concept. He did, however, win the London Trophy at Crystal Palace with a Formula Two Cooper. The Aston Martin team continued into 1960 but again without success and Salvadori also continued with the privately entered Cooper.

For 1961, Salvadori moved to Reg Parnell&#x27;s Yeoman Credit Racing team as partner to John Surtees, competing in five Grands Prix and achieving three sixth-place finishes with the team&#x27;s 1.5-litre Cooper T53-Climax. The Cooper now had strong competition in the form of Colin Chapman&#x27;s Lotus cars, but Salvadori was catching Innes Ireland for the lead in the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen when the engine failed. He continued with Parnell for 1962, now under the Bowmaker Racing Team name with the Lola Mk4-Climax, but eight attempts yielded seven retirements and one failure to start (as John Surtees took the car). 1962 was Salvadori&#x27;s last season in Formula One. The season had begun with a nasty accident in a Cooper during qualifying for the Warwick Farm &#x27;100&#x27; in Australia, which left him with a temporary facial paralysis.

===Sports cars===
Throughout his Formula One career, Salvadori continued to participate in many other classes, particularly within the United Kingdom and became very well-known domestically as a result. Throughout 1951 and 1952 seasons, while taking part in sportscar races throughout England, he would become a regular on the podium and would win his first race at the BARC Goodwood in 1952. He would follow this victory up with another at Snetterton and Goodwood later on in the season. He would then sweep all of the events as part of the National meeting at Thruxton. 1953 would see Salvadori earn more podium finishes with a few victories. However, his first attempt at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, driving a works Aston Martin would not fare well. Co-driving with George Abecassis, the clutch failure would lead to the pair retiring early. He impressed with his aggressive press-on attitude, when he finished second in the Internationales ADAC-1000 km Rennen Weltmeisterschaftslauf Nürburgring in an Ecurie Ecosse Jaguar C-Type, shared with Ian Stewart

Ever since he started racing sportscars in the upper levels during the 1950s, he was usually a sure bet to finish in the top five, whether it was in national or international races. However, in 1959, he would achieve a run of success of which even the best would find themselves envious. Although he only finished one race in the year to March, over the next three months Salvadori would go on an incredible run of success. The run started with a second place in the British Empire Trophy race but followed that with two straight victories in the Aintree 200 and an International race at Silverstone. And then, a pair of second-place finishes and another victory, this time at the National Open race at Crystal Palace in the middle of May. It was on to the Circuit de la Sarthe for the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

===1959 24 Hours of Le Mans===
Salvadori was entered in the race by David Brown Racing Dept. in an Aston Martin DBR1/300, partnered by the same co-driver he had had at the 12 Hours of Sebring earlier on in the year, Texan Carroll Shelby. Attrition would be a constant participant and the field would be down to just 13 cars, heading the surviving cars was that of Salvadori and Shelby. The Englishman would bring the car across the finish line giving himself and Brown the Le Mans victory each had been longing for many years. This would be the high point of his sports car career, especially as Shelby was afflicted by dysentery, therefore Salvadori did the lion&#x27;s share of the driving. Before the end of the season, he would score four more victories to make it his best season.

He followed the &#x27;59 season with another successful season in 1960, scoring five victories, including a run of four wins in five races. While at Le Mans, he allowed his co-driver, Jim Clark sufficient scope to express himself, but provided enough wise counsel for the pairing to finish third in the Border Reivers&#x27; DBR1. 1961 would see him take two victories at Crystal Palace on the same day, plus a string of other podium finishes He returned to the winning ways at the Circuit de la Sarthe in 1962, when he shared a Jaguar E-Type with Briggs Cunningham. The pair finished fourth overall, but won their class. A year later, he spun on oil dropped by Bruce McLaren&#x27;s Aston Martin DP214 during the early stages of the race and flipped his E-Type onto its roof; the car then burst into flames. Jean-Pierre Manzon in his Aerodjet LM6 hit Salvadori and stopped in the middle of the track. Christian Heins was unable to avoid the wreckage; his car swerved out of control, hit another car, spun into a lamp car, and exploded in flames. Salvadori and Manzon were both injured; Heins died instantly. The accident ultimately led to Salvadori retiring from racing in early 1965, after finished second in the Whitsun Trophy race at Goodwood, abroad a Ford GT40. His last sportscar victory came the season before in the Scott-Brown Memorial at Snetterton.

Salvadori returned to Formula One as a team manager for the Cooper racing team in 1966 and 1967. However, after a disagreement with the team, he left and focussed on his own business. Away from the track, he was involved with a car dealership in Surrey between 1968-1969. Salvadori was also involved in the early stages of the Ford GT40 project but resigned, when the machine&#x27;s handling appeared problematic, without accepting a fee for his services.

Salvadori retired to Monaco in the late 1960s. He died in Monaco on 3 June 2012 at the age of 90, three weeks after the death of his co-driver at Le Mans in 1959, Carroll Shelby.

==Family life==
Salvadori married Susan Hindmarsh, one of the daughters of racing driver, long distance record breaker and &#x27;round the world&#x27; driver Violette Cordery and her husband, the racing driver and aviator John Stuart Hindmarsh.

<text>Rupert Keegan (26 February 1955 – 23 September 2024) was an English racing driver. He participated in 37 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 8 May 1977. He scored no championship points.

==Biography==
Keegan won the 1976 British Formula 3 Championship, which propelled him into Formula One. After seasons with Hesketh and Surtees, neither of them particularly competitive teams, he won the Aurora Formula One Championship in 1979. A return to the Formula One World Championship with RAM driving their Williams FW07B yielded little in the way of results, as did a few races with March. His best career result was 7th at the 1977 Austrian Grand Prix scored in Hesketh 308E/1.

After Formula One, Keegan raced in the United States in CART, and also in endurance racing. After his retirement, he pursued business interests and also worked as a racing instructor.

Keegan died in Portoferraio after a long battle with cancer on 23 September 2024, at the age of 69.

<doc id="1226566" wikidata="Q173221" url="?curid=1226566" title="Satoru Nakajima">
<text>is a Japanese former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to .

Born and raised in Okazaki, Aichi, Nakajima began his racing career at the Suzuka Circuit in 1973. He progressed to Japanese Formula Two in 1977, winning a then-record five titles between 1981 and 1986, with 21 victories across 10 seasons. After several appearances in sportscar racing via the World Sportscar Championship and the All Japan Endurance Championship—as well as a season in International Formula 3000—Nakajima signed for Lotus in to partner Ayrton Senna, becoming the first Japanese driver to compete full-time in Formula One at the . He scored his maiden points finish at the following round in San Marino, and achieved a career-best fourth place at the .

Across his remaining two seasons at Lotus, Nakajima scored points finishes at the 1988 Brazilian and 1989 Australian Grands Prix, setting the fastest lap and finishing fourth at the latter. Nakajima moved to Tyrrell in , scoring points finishes in the United States, Italy and his home Grand Prix in Japan. Retaining his seat for his campaign at Tyrrell under Honda power, Nakajima scored his final points at the season-opening , leaving at the end of the season to join Honda&#x27;s works team project. Nakajima tested the RC100 and related models until 1994, when Honda pulled out of Formula One following the Japanese asset price bubble.

Upon retiring from motor racing, Nakajima focused on his Nakajima Racing team, which he had founded in 1984 to privately enter March chassis into the Japanese Formula Two Championship, winning three consecutive titles until 1986. Nakajima won four Formula Nippon Teams&#x27; Championship titles between 1999 and 2009, still competing in the newly-formed Super Formula Championship, as well as the Super GT Series. Nakajima&#x27;s sons Kazuki and Daisuke both became racing drivers, the former also competing in Formula One for Williams from to .

==Early life==
Satoru Nakajima was born on 23 February 1953 to a farming family living just outside Okazaki, Japan. He began driving cars in his early teens in the family&#x27;s garden with his older brother giving him tips, careful that their father didn&#x27;t catch them. He felt exhilaration behind the wheel of a car, and from then on knew what he wanted to do.

==Career==
Nakajima started racing after he finished school and passed his driver&#x27;s licence. In 1973 he was a rookie in the Suzuka Circuit series, which he won. Five years later, he won his first race in Japanese Formula Two. In 1981 he won his first championship, thus beginning a period of domination in the series. He won five of the next six championships, all of them equipped with a Honda V6 engine.

Nakajima participated in 80 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting in the Brazilian Grand Prix on 12 April 1987, bringing Honda engines to the Lotus team. He was 34 years old in his debut race, making him one of Formula One&#x27;s oldest debutants of the modern era. He finished sixth, and so scored a point, in only his second race, the 1987 San Marino Grand Prix. During his debut season, Nakajima was outclassed by his teammate Ayrton Senna, and many questioned Nakajima&#x27;s place in F1, stating that if not for Honda he would not have been there on merit.

Honda had originally pushed for Nakajima to replace Nigel Mansell at Williams for the season (the Japanese company supplied their engines exclusively to Williams from 1984 to 1986). However, Williams owner Frank Williams refused to dump Mansell, who despite scoring only 7 points in the first 12 rounds, had finally won his first two races towards the end of the season. Frank Williams, who was always more interested in the Constructors&#x27; rather than the Drivers&#x27; Championship, reasoned that having race winner Mansell, and then dual World Champion Nelson Piquet, would give the team its best shot at the Constructors&#x27; title, and that the unproven (in F1) Nakajima would struggle (Williams was to be proven correct on this). Lotus were looking for a new engine partner for 1987 as Renault were pulling out of the sport at the end of 1986. Lotus agreed to take on Nakajima replacing Johnny Dumfries in the second seat as a part of the new engine deal with Honda.

 was another miserable year in F1 for both Nakajima and Lotus. In the final season for turbos and using the same V6 engines that propelled McLaren drivers Senna and Alain Prost to win 15 of the season&#x27;s 16 races, Nakajima scored only a single point during the season finishing sixth in the opening race in Brazil. He also failed to qualify the Lotus 100T at both Monaco and Detroit, the only times between its first race in and the end of the turbo era in 1988 that a Honda V6 turbo failed to qualify for any Grands Prix entered. Despite this, on occasions Nakajima was able to push his teammate, reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet who had replaced Senna.

Not normally the best of qualifiers or racers despite having equipment superior to most, including the same all-powerful Honda V6 turbo engine as the McLarens, Nakajima could have easily been excused for performing poorly at the 1988 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, if he chose to compete at all. Only 30 minutes before the start of the Friday morning&#x27;s practice session he was informed that his mother had died that morning (28 October). In the circumstances his effort in Saturday qualifying to equal his more illustrious teammate&#x27;s time right down to the thousandth of a second was exceptional. Piquet and Nakajima qualified 5th and 6th respectively, Piquet in front only for having set his time earlier in the last qualifying session. Nakajima was actually faster than the triple World Champion on the Friday, an effort that won the much-maligned Japanese driver new fans and much praise in the F1 paddock.

Despite most believing he did not truly deserve to be in F1, Lotus showed faith in Nakajima when they re-signed him for , even after Honda announced would not be supplying their engines to the team after the 1988 season. This left Nakajima and team-mate Piquet driving the Judd V8 powered Lotus 101 (Nakajima continued to wear Honda patches on his racing suit during the years he did not drive for a Honda-powered team). The pair had a very up-and-down season, with both failing to qualify for the 1989 Belgian Grand Prix, the first time in their 30-year history that Lotus had failed to make the grid, symbolically heralding the beginning of the end for the British team. A great upside to Nakajima&#x27;s 1989 was a fourth place and fastest lap in the rain-soaked Australian Grand Prix, scoring his only points of the year and also equaling his best career finish, from the 1987 British Grand Prix. Nakajima&#x27;s race in Adelaide, in which he was dead last at the end of the first lap after a spin soon after the start and only finished 4.648 seconds behind the 3rd placed Williams-Renault V10 of Riccardo Patrese, even drew praise from those who had criticised him in the past such as BBC television commentator and World Champion James Hunt.

Nakajima joined Tyrrell for the season (along with the promise of the team using the Honda V10 engine in ). He raced for them for two uneventful years at the back of the pack before ending his career. In 1990 he was teammate to young Frenchman Jean Alesi, who scored 13 points (including two second places) to Nakajima&#x27;s three. In 1991 with the Honda engines used by McLaren in 1990 (and serviced by Mugen Motorsports), he was joined by Italian Stefano Modena. Nakajima was again outscored by his teammate, with Modena scoring 10 points and Nakajima&#x27;s two points coming from finishing 5th in the opening race of the season in Phoenix.

Honda left Formula One a year later to lay the first bricks on a works team, one that they had been working on during the Formula One season, and that CEO Nobuhiko Kawamoto finally admitted to in October. The car, the Honda RC100 was unveiled to the media in February 1993, driven by Nakajima. Shortly afterwards, it passed the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) crash tests, meaning that the company could enter their team into F1 competition. In an attempt to improve on their previous chassis, Honda built two more, the RC101 and 101B, the latter intended for racing purposes, the former for crash testing. Nakajima had the first public testing of the 101B in Suzuka in January 1994. The company decided against entering its own cars in F1 at this time, instead opting to further their engine development in America with CART, and later, the IRL.

==Personal life==
Nakajima still lives in the family home near Okazaki. He owns the Nakajima Racing entry in Japanese Formula 3000 / Formula Nippon / Super Formula. Nakajima drivers have won the Formula Nippon championship three times, Tom Coronel doing so in 1999, Toranosuke Takagi in 2000, and Ralph Firman in 2002.

Nakajima&#x27;s son, Kazuki raced for the Williams team in Formula One in the 2008 and 2009 seasons. Nakajima&#x27;s younger son, Daisuke, is also a racing driver. He competed in the British Formula 3 Championship in 2009 and 2010. After their careers in open-wheel racing, both turned to sports car racing; Kazuki raced in the FIA World Endurance Championship with Toyota Gazoo Racing while Daisuke raced in Super GT; both have since retired from racing. Kazuki retired after the 2021 FIA World Endurance Championship to take up a managerial role with Toyota Gazoo Racing, while Daisuke retired at the end of the 2019 Super GT Series and has since maintained a low profile.

Nakajima&#x27;s helmet was white with two red lines forming a circular end on the chin area, with a wide line on the rear of the helmet with written NAKAJIMA on it. His son Kazuki Nakajima uses a slightly different version of this helmet.

==Video games==
Between 1988 and 1994, Nakajima endorsed many Formula One video games for various consoles like Family Computer, Sega Mega Drive, Game Boy and Super Famicom. While most of these games (released by Varie) were only released in Japan, one of the games Nakajima had endorsed for the Mega Drive was released internationally as &quot;Ferrari Grand Prix Challenge&quot;. He also appeared as a playable driver in his Lotus 100T in Codemasters&#x27; &quot;F1 2013&quot;.

<text>Shinji Nakano (中野 信治, born 1 April 1971) is a Japanese professional racing driver.

His father, Tsuneharu, was also a racing driver. He competed in the All-Japan Formula Three Championship.

==Racing career==

===Pre Formula One Career===
===Formula One Career===
Nakano made his debut at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne for the Prost Grand Prix team, owned by legendary four times Formula One World Champion Alain Prost. The season saw him score two world championship points with a pair of sixth places.

With his place at Prost heavily reliant on their engine partners Mugen-Honda, Nakano was dropped in favour of Jarno Trulli, with the second cockpit taken by Olivier Panis, when Prost switched to Peugeot engines. He subsequently joined Minardi for the season, alongside Esteban Tuero.

Nakano struggled in the under-powered, under-financed Italian team. He failed to score any points in 1998 and bowed out of Formula One racing for good at his home Grand Prix at Suzuka, Japan, having contested a total of 33 Grands Prix. He spent as an occasional test driver for the Jordan team, which also used Mugen-Honda engines.

===After Formula One===
After Formula One, Nakano went to race in CART for Walker Racing and Fernandez Racing. He made 56 starts from 2000 to 2002 with a best points finish of 17th in 2002 and a best race result of 4th at the 2002 Molson Indy Toronto. He also started 15th in the 2003 Indianapolis 500 for Beck Motorsports, finishing 14th. He competed in the 2006 and 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans races and returned to the event in 2011 with OAK Racing and 2012 with the Boutsen Ginon squad.

==Helmet==
Nakano&#x27;s helmet was black with a black circle on the top surrounded by a white halo, with a red and silver flame design surrounding the visor and a black and silver checkered flag behind of it, in CART he changed the black for white, the halo became blue, the black circle became red, the checkered flag disappeared and the flame became red with blue outline. in LeMans, he added more flames in the point where the checkered flag was.

== Media appearances ==
Since 2016, Nakano has served as a commentator on Formula One races for DAZN Japan. He was a guest on the TV Asahi variety programme &quot;Aruaru Gijido&quot; in March 2017.

This was the first international Grand Prix win for a British car since 1924 at the San Sebastián Grand Prix.
In 1957, Brooks claimed the first victory for a British-constructed car in a World Championship race in the British Grand Prix at Aintree, which he shared with Stirling Moss. Along with Moss, Brooks is considered one of the best drivers never to have been World Champion and both Moss and three-time World Champion Jack Brabham were known to have thought highly of his ability.

In 1959, Brooks, together with Brabham and Moss, had a chance to win the title due to the retirement and subsequent death in a road accident of Mike Hawthorn and the death in the previous season of Peter Collins. Brooks started well, with a second place at the Monaco Grand Prix, behind Brabham. He failed to finish at the Dutch Grand Prix but dominantly won the French Grand Prix at Reims. Having failed to finish in a Vanwall at the British Grand Prix, which he drove due to Ferrari workers in Italy being on strike, he won the only German Grand Prix of Formula One to be held at AVUS. The race was split unusually into two heats, and he won both. He had a slow car in Portugal, qualifying 10th and finishing five laps down. He retired shortly after the start at Monza but was still in contention to win the championship. At the first ever United States Grand Prix for Formula One at Sebring, he was hit by German teammate Wolfgang von Trips and pitted to check for any damage, losing two minutes. It proved to be a waste of time but still finished in third place. He finished second in the championship with 27 points, seven behind Brabham, and one-and-a-half ahead of Moss.
Brooks won six races for Vanwall and Ferrari, secured four pole positions, achieved ten podiums, and scored a total of 75 championship points. He drove for British Racing Motors but retired from the team at the end of 1961, just before their most successful season. He ended his career with a third place at the first ever United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. He was also an accomplished sports car driver, winning both the 1957 1000 km Nürburgring and the 1958 RAC Tourist Trophy, with co-driver, Moss, racing an Aston Martin DBR1. He was less successful at Le Mans in 1957 due again to an accident which occurred while racing an Aston Martin DBR1 at that year&#x27;s 24-hour race, which brought about a change in his racing philosophy. A crash in the 1956 British Grand Prix and the subsequent Le Mans crash both occurred in cars with mechanical problems, of which he was aware, and Brooks, being a devout Catholic, vowed he would never again risk his life in a car that was in less than sound condition. He had fewer qualms when it came to his own condition, saying: &quot;I was lucky in the Le Mans shunt in that I didn&#x27;t break anything, but I did have very severe abrasions – there was a hole in the side of my thigh I could literally have put my fist into.&quot; It was with these injuries that he went on to race in the 1957 British GP with Moss, and win. In 2007, Brooks was honoured by his home town. The Dukinfield District Assembly, part of Tameside Council, held a dinner in his honour and unveiled a plaque outside his former home on Park Lane.

Brooks died aged 90 on 3 May 2022. As a result, in addition to Brooks becoming the last surviving Grand Prix winner from the 1950s after the death of Moss in April 2020, three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart (who first raced in the 1960s) was now the oldest Formula One Grand Prix winner.

<text>Anthony Francis O&#x27;Connell Maggs (9 February 1937 – 2 June 2009) was a racing driver from South Africa. He participated in 27 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 15 July 1961. He achieved three podiums, and scored a total of 26 championship points. He was the first South African to take part in a Formula One Grand Prix.

The son of a wealthy farmer and businessman, Tony Maggs was part of Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s Formula Junior, Cooper-BMC team in 1961 and shared the European Championship with Jo Siffert. He was invited into the Cooper Formula One team for 1962–1963, finishing second in the French Grand Prix both years, but was dropped at the end of 1963.

Maggs then moved to Scuderia Centro Sud for 1964 and despite the fact that their BRM P57s were not current machinery achieved two points finishes out of three race starts. He also returned to Formula Two with an MRP Lola and with David Piper won the Kyalami 9 Hours race in the latter&#x27;s Ferrari GTO.

In 1965, Maggs raced only once in Formula One, for Reg Parnell Racing, in the South African Grand Prix at East London but continued with success in both Formula Two and sports cars. However, in a national race at Pietermaritzburg he crashed his Brabham and a young spectator standing in a restricted area was hit and killed. Maggs immediately retired from motor sport to concentrate on his business interests.

Maggs died on 2 June 2009, from cancer.

<doc id="1226576" wikidata="Q173442" url="?curid=1226576" title="Trevor Taylor (racing driver)">
<text>Trevor Patrick Taylor (26 December 1936 – 27 September 2010) was a British motor racing driver from England.

==Early career==
Trevor Taylor was born in Sheffield, the son of a garage owner from Rotherham. He began his racing career in Formula Three racing, initially in a Staride and later a Cooper-Norton. Ten victories in 1958 earned him the British Formula Three Championship. After a frustrating year in 1959 spent with his own Formula Two Cooper, he received an invitation to run his Lotus 18 as a second works car for 1960. He finished equal first in the Formula Junior championship with Jim Clark, although he competed in two more races that counted towards the championship than Clark who was already driving regularly for Team Lotus in Formula One. Taylor went on to win the title on his own account in 1961. At the end of 1961, Taylor got a regular Formula One drive with Team Lotus and proved competitive with Clark and Moss in the South African series in December 1961.

==Formula One career==
Taylor participated in 29 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, qualifying for 27 of them. He made his debut on 18 July 1959, in the British Grand Prix held that year at Aintree, driving a privately entered 1.5-litre Cooper T51 but did not qualify. In 1961, he was thirteenth at that year&#x27;s Dutch Grand Prix, his only World Championship drive that year. He was second in the 1962 Formula One season opening Dutch Grand Prix, his only World Championship podium finish. He led early in the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa and after his team leader Clark passed he engaged in a duel with Willy Mairesse who was driving before his home crowd. Following in Taylor&#x27;s slip steam, Mairesse clipped the extension of Taylor&#x27;s gearbox going uphill from Stavelot, the Ferrari 156 having more power uphill, and while neither suffered serious injury both were lucky to survive the high speed encounter. Taylor said that, while Mairesse generally tried too hard and was over-eager for Championship honours, on this occasion, Mairesse was driving well and with precision and it was not his fault.

At the end of 1962, Taylor shared with Jim Clark the car and victory in the non-championship Mexican Grand Prix had a win and a second place at two non-championship events in South Africa confirming his place with Team Lotus in 1963. However, after a handful of top-three-finishes in non-championship events, his best World Championship result was sixth place in the opening race at Monaco, and thereafter he was rarely competitive, although on the fast Reims circuit, in the French Grand Prix, he was running second when he retired at two-thirds distance. Taylor admitted his confidence was shaken by two serious accidents at Spa and Enna-Pergusa. Team owner Colin Chapman suggested Taylor take a sabbatical after the end of the 1963 season and then return to Lotus. Taylor differed and attempted to continue as an F1 driver. After an unsuccessful season with the British Racing Partnership in 1964, Taylor withdrew from Formula One competition.

During his career he achieved one podium finish, and scored a total of eight championship points. He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races during this time and won three, including one shared with Clark, in 1962 and 1963. Taylor is credited with inventing the yellow stripe that ran down the middle of Team Lotus cars during the 1960s.

After 1964 Taylor enjoyed lesser forms of racing, and tested a Cosworth Formula One car in 1969 which was entered for Grands Prix but did not race. In that, the opening year of F5000, Trevor Taylor was a strong contestant in the Guards Championship, winning F5000 rounds in a Surtees TS5 in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Ireland and finished runner up to Peter Gethin in the 1969 F5000 series.

Taylor died at the age of 73 after contracting cancer.

<text>Vittorio Brambilla (; 11 November 1937 – 26 May 2001) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Nicknamed &quot;The Monza Gorilla&quot;, Brambilla won the 1975 Austrian Grand Prix with March.

Born and raised in Monza, Brambilla competed in Formula One for March, Surtees and Alfa Romeo. A wet weather specialist, Brambilla won the curtailed in with a 27-second margin over James Hunt in only 29 laps.

==Career==

Born in the town of Monza itself, Brambilla began racing motorcycles in 1957 and won the Italian national 175cc title in 1958. He continued to race motorcycles on a casual basis throughout his career, finishing 12th in a guest appearance at the 1969 Italian 500cc motorcycle Grand Prix riding a Paton. Before becoming a mechanic he also raced go-karts. His older brother, Ernesto (&quot;Tino&quot;), was also a racing driver.

===Formula Three, Formula Two, Sports cars===

He returned to racing in 1968, in Formula 3 and won the Italian championship in 1972, by which time he was already racing Formula 2. Brambilla was 2nd to Jacky Ickx in a 1970 2-heat Formula Two race at the Salzburg Ring in Salzburg, Austria. He drove a March BMW to 4th place in Hockenheim, in a 1973 Formula Two race. There were two 10-lap heats covering . Brambilla won the City of Enna Cup, the 5th 1973 event in the European automaker&#x27;s championship for 2,000 cc cars. He averaged over . He drove an Abarth-Osella. Brambilla captured the pole for the Monza 4-hour auto race in a BMW 3.5 CSL.

===Formula One===

====March 1974–1976====

In his first year of Formula One, Brambilla was as quick as his teammate Stuck, although more accident-prone. In the Swedish GP he ran in fifth until an engine problem. Brambilla finished tied for 18th, last, in the Formula One World Championship standings. In 1975 he amazed many at the Belgian GP, where he led until encountering brakes problems after 54 laps, and at the 1975 Swedish Grand Prix, where he secured pole position until a transmission failure forced him to retire after 36 laps. His great day came at the Österreichring in 1975, when he won a wet Austrian Grand Prix. He spun off and wrecked the nose of his car as he took the chequered flag, and completed his slowing down lap with the front of the car destroyed while waving to the crowd. As the race was shortened, with 60% of it completed, he only received 4.5 points instead of 9 for the win. A more serious accident occurred that season when Brambilla crashed his March through a new curve at Watkins Glen during qualifying for the 1975 United States Grand Prix. He backed into a guard rail afterwards but was unhurt. The session ended at that point with Niki Lauda leading. Before his accident Brambilla was second fastest with a lap of . During 1976 he suffered several accidents and mechanical retirements, collecting only one point at the 1976 Dutch Grand Prix. He qualified his March in 8th position for the 1976 United States Grand Prix West. In the race Brambilla was tapped from behind by Carlos Reutemann before they reached the first turn. He lost the right rear wheel on his March on the 35th lap of the 1976 United States Grand Prix after holding fifth place for a time.

====Surtees (1977–1978)====

In 1977, Brambilla moved to the Surtees team, where he scored six points. At the same time he also drove for the Alfa Romeo sports car team, achieving the World Championship for the team. Brambilla finished 8th in the 1977 Monaco Grand Prix.

Brambilla continued with Surtees in 1978. At the 1978 United States Grand Prix West he placed 17th in qualifying, with a time of 1:23.212. His #19 Beta Surtees TS 19 finished 14th after experiencing engine failure on lap 50.

In a multiple pileup at Monza in the 1978 Italian Grand Prix, Brambilla suffered serious head injuries when he was hit by a flying wheel during a multiple car collision on the opening lap. In reaction to that race, in which Ronnie Peterson sustained fatal injuries, it was announced in October 1978 that the Italian Grand Prix would move to the Autodromo Dino Ferrari circuit in Imola for the next three years although this did not actually happen until 1980. The 1979 Italian Grand Prix was at Monza again, and Brambilla recovered and returned to participate in that race.

====Alfa Romeo (1979–1980)====
Brambilla drove briefly for the Alfa Romeo Formula One team in 1979 and 1980. On the first day of qualifying for the 1979 United States Grand Prix Brambilla was timed at . Heavy rain caused a slick track and slower times. In December 1979 Alfa Romeo revealed its Formula One race car for the 1980 season. The company named Patrick Depailler, Brambilla, and Bruno Giacomelli as its drivers. The racer was nearly identical to one driven by Giacomelli in the 1979 Italian Grand Prix. It was a &quot;wing car&quot; design with a V-12 engine that generated more than . Alfa Romeo announced that it was working on a 1,500 cubic centimeter turbocharged engine which was to begin track testing in a Formula One car in the summer of 1980.

==Retirement and death==
Brambilla retired at the end of the 1980 season. In the early 1990s he opened a Formula One memorabilia shop in Milan, occasionally driving the safety car during the Italian Grand Prix. He died at Lesmo, near Milan, of a heart attack at the age of 63 while gardening at his home. He reportedly collapsed while mowing the lawn.

<doc id="1226581" wikidata="Q173296" url="?curid=1226581" title="Wilson Fittipaldi Júnior">
<text>Wilson Fittipaldi Júnior (25 December 1943 – 23 February 2024) was a Brazilian racing driver and Formula One team owner. He participated in 38 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 1 May 1972, scoring a total of three championship points. He ran the Fittipaldi Formula One team between 1974 and 1982. He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races.

==Personal life==
Born on Christmas Day 1943, Wilson Fittipaldi Jr was the elder son of prominent motorsports journalist and radio commentator Wilson Sr and his wife Juzy, who both raced production cars shortly after the Second World War. Wilson Sr was also responsible for the first Mil Milhas race in 1956, in São Paulo, having been inspired by the 1949 Italian Mille Miglia. Wilson Jr is often referred to as &#x27;Wilsinho&#x27; (&quot;Little Wilson&quot;, cf. Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s occasional nickname of Rubinho or footballer Ronaldinho) or &#x27;Tigrão&#x27;. He unsurprisingly became a keen motorsports enthusiast from an early age.

Wilson Fittipaldi was the older brother of CART champion and double Formula One world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Like Jimmy Stewart and Ian Scheckter he remained in the shadow of his younger and more illustrious sibling in top-level motorsport. He married Suzy. He was the father of former CART, Formula One and NASCAR driver Christian Fittipaldi and has a daughter, Roberta.

Wilson Fittipaldi Júnior suffered a cardiac arrest on 25 December 2023, his 80th birthday. According to his wife, during dinner he choked on a piece of food and the resulting lack of oxygen resulted in the cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and subsequently admitted to a hospital where he was sedated and intubated. He died in São Paulo on 23 February 2024.

==Racing career==

Wilson Fittipaldi started racing the karts that he and his brother built in Brazil in the 1960s, before moving on to Formula Vee.

Fittipaldi made a brief trip to Europe in 1966 to race in Formula Three, but the opportunity fell through due to conflicts with the team he drove for in Brazil. He did not return to England until 1970, following his brother&#x27;s success in Formula Two. That year he raced a Jim Russell Driving School entered Lotus 59 in British Formula Three, beating Carlos Pace and works Lotus driver Dave Walker, among others, to a victory at a BARC Championship round at Silverstone. At various times during the year he was also competing with future Formula One champions Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Combined with some other good results, particularly in the latter part of the year, including wins in two non-championship rounds, this enabled him to move up to the European Formula Two championship for 1971.

Here he scored several more good results racing alongside his brother for Team Bardahl-Fittipaldi in Lotus and March chassis, including a podium at Hockenheim and fourth places at Rouen and Mantorp Park. These results were sufficient to gain him a deal with the Brabham Formula One team for the 1972 season as a pay driver.

His Formula One career started with a podium at the 1972 Brazilian Grand Prix; however, this was a non-championship race and he was unable to repeat the performance in the world championship. He was a moderately competitive midfield runner for Brabham in 1972 and 1973. He scored no points in the 1972 championship, but in 1973 he scored his only Formula One World Championship points with a sixth place in Buenos Aires and a fifth place at the Nürburgring. His best qualifying results were ninth in Monaco and tenth at Mosport also in 1973.

Fittipaldi, tired of both being a paying driver and being a second driver on the team, without being able to challenge the team&#x27;s first driver Carlos Reutemann under the boss&#x27;s orders Bernie Ecclestone, took a break from driving at the beginning of 1974 to set up a Brazilian Formula One team (although he took part in the Grande Premio Presidente Emilio Medici non-championship Formula One race that year with Brabham). The team, initially known as Copersucar-Fittipaldi, did not have great success in their first racing season in 1975. Wilson was the sole driver and managed only six finishes, the highest of which was 10th, and last, place at the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, and failed to qualify several times. Wilson stepped down from driving to look after the management of the team in 1976 when his brother, Emerson, joined the team from McLaren. His career total of three points, scored in 1972 and 1973 with Brabham, made him the most successful sibling of a Formula One World Champion until the arrival of Ralf Schumacher in 1997.

Fittipaldi occasionally returned to competitive driving. In the 1980s and early 1990s he drove in the Brazilian Stock Car championship, winning several rounds. In 1994 and 1995 he was victorious for Porsche in the classic Mil Milhas race founded by his father, on the former occasion sharing the car with his son Christian. In February 1998 he announced his return to competitive driving in the Brazilian Stock Car championship. In 2000 he was a guest driver for Mercedes-Benz at the Nürburgring round of the FIA European Truck Racing Cup, finishing 8th and 11th. In 2008, Wilson and Emerson entered the Brazilian GT3 Championship, driving a Porsche 997 GT3 for the WB Motorsports team.

; As Fittipaldi brothers
Before the Fittipaldis, three pairs of brothers had raced in Formula One: Jimmy and Jackie Stewart, Pedro and Ricardo Rodríguez, and Ernesto and Vittorio Brambilla. However, none of the siblings had competed in the same race. The Fittipaldi brothers were the first to compete in the same race, and also the first to score points in the same race: Wilson Fittipaldi only scored points in two Formula One races, (the 1973 Argentine Grand Prix and 1973 German Grand Prix), but on both occasions his younger brother, Emerson, also scored points (a win in Argentina and 6th in Germany).

Since the Fittipaldis, another six sets of brothers have competed in Formula One. Ian and Jody Scheckter, Gilles and Jacques Villeneuve Sr., Manfred and Joachim Winkelhock, Teo and Corrado Fabi, and Gary and David Brabham all failed to score points in the same race. Michael and Ralf Schumacher were the next to do so at the 1997 French Grand Prix.

; As the father of a Formula One driver
Fittipaldi&#x27;s son, Christian, made his debut in Formula One in and took his first point at the 1992 Japanese Grand Prix, making Wilson and Christian Fittipaldi the first parent and child to both score points in Formula One. They have since been followed by Graham and Damon Hill, Mario and Michael Andretti, Gilles and Jacques Villeneuve, Keke and Nico Rosberg, Satoru and Kazuki Nakajima, Nelson Piquet and Nelson Piquet Jr., Jan and Kevin Magnussen, Jos and Max Verstappen, Jonathan and Jolyon Palmer, and Michael and Mick Schumacher.

==Career in management and business==

Although their father was reluctant to fund racing careers for them, the Fittipaldi brothers were able to finance their early racing careers by setting up a successful custom car accessory business while still in their teens, and then businesses building karts and Formula Vee cars. There was also a Fittipaldi-Porsche project - a one-off sports car chassis with Porsche mechanicals that the brothers built and raced in 1968.

In mid-1974 Wilson had persuaded Brazilian sugar and alcohol conglomerate Copersucar to sponsor his Formula One team, and from 1976 he had retired from driving and to concentrate on the management of the team, which ran with occasional flashes of success in Formula One from 1975 until it shut down in 1982.

After then he involved himself with the family&#x27;s business interests, including a Mercedes-Benz dealership. He also carried out some television work, and was involved in the racing career of his son, Christian, managing him from 1996. In 2004 he became technical director of the WB motorsport team in Brazilian V8 stock cars. This led to the younger Fittipaldi testing one of the cars in 2004 before taking part in the championship in 2005 with a different team.

<text>Ernest George Horlock VC (also known as Ernest George Harlock) (24 October 1885 – 30 December 1917) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born on 24 October 1885 to John and Emily Horlock in Beech near Alton, Hampshire, Horlock married Ethel Hasted in 1917.

==Gallantry in battle==
Horlock was a 28 years old Bombardier in the 113th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, British Army during the First World War when he performed the service for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

As well as being recommended for the VC, Horlock was reprimanded by his officers for not obeying orders to go to the hospital after both his first and second wounds had been dressed. He stayed by his gun until the evening, despite a third wound. He was mentioned in despatches by Sir John French on 8 October 1914.

The award was presented by King George V on 3 December 1914 at Merris, France while his unit was refitting, by this time Horlock had been promoted to Sergeant. He later was promoted to Battery Sergeant Major.

Horlock joined the Royal Field Artillery as a regular soldier in 1904 and for an unknown reason served as Harlock, possibly due to a clerical error on enlistment papers and subsequent records. His Victoria Cross was actually correctly engraved Horlock. His grave at Hadra Military Cemetery, Alexandria, bore the name Harlock until corrected by the Commonwealth Graves Commission in the late 1970s.

==Death at sea==
In December 1917 Horlock was one of 2,500 troops who sailed from Marseille aboard the troop ship to join the Egyptian Expeditionary Force&#x27;s Southern Palestine Offensive against the Ottoman Empire. On the morning of 30 December &quot;Aragon&quot; was no more than from her destination at the Port of Alexandria in Egypt when the German submarine torpedoed her, sinking her within 20 minutes. &quot;Aragon&quot;″s escort, the destroyer , rescued 300 to 400 survivors, but then &quot;UC-34&quot; sank her as well.

Horlock was one of 610 personnel killed in the attack. His body was recovered and buried in Hadra War Memorial Cemetery, Alexandria.

==Monuments in Hampshire==

On 24 May 2001 (previously called Empire Day) a memorial to E.G. Horlock, VC was unveiled in St John&#x27;s parish church, Langrish, Hampshire. The event was attended by Horlock descendants from all over the World. A contingent from 10 (Assaye) Battery (the successor of 113th Battery and the holders of the medal) was also present, in addition to members of Portsmouth Branch of the Royal Artillery Association and the RA Artificers&#x27; Association. During the ceremony a tribute was given by the General Secretary, Lieutenant Colonel MG Felton, and the memorial was unveiled by Dame Mary Fagan, Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire.

On 15 September 2014 a memorial paving stone was unveiled near the War Memorial in Alton, Hampshire, to Bombardier Ernest Horlock on the hundredth anniversary of his VC service. There was a display in the nearby Assembly Rooms and, later in the day, the firing of an 18pdr field gun (similar to the type Horlock would have served with) in Anstey Park.

<doc id="1226611" wikidata="Q7892610" url="?curid=1226611" title="Non-profit organization laws in the U.S.">
<text>United States non-profit laws relate to taxation, the special problems of an organization which does not have profit as its primary motivation, and prevention of charitable fraud. Some non-profit organizations can broadly be described as &quot;charities&quot; — like the American Red Cross. Some are strictly for the private benefit of the members — like country clubs, or condominium associations. Others fall somewhere in between — like labor unions, chambers of commerce, or cooperative electric companies. Each presents unique legal issues.

==Taxation==

If an organization is to qualify for tax exempt status, the organization&#x27;s (a) &quot;charter&quot; — if a &quot;not-for-profit corporation&quot; — or (b) &quot;trust instrument&quot; — if a trust — or (c) &quot;articles of association&quot; — if an association — must specify that no part of its assets shall benefit any people who are members, directors, officers or agents (its principals). As well the organization must have a legal, charitable purpose, i.e. the organization must be created to support educational, religious, or charitable activities. These elements do not mean that the organization cannot pay employees or contractors for work or services they render to the organization. This limitation means that as long as the organization operates within its exempt purposes and it maintains an endowment or uses any excess revenue to further develop its activities it will not be taxed by the Internal Revenue Service.

Such a surplus — that is, whatever part of its income is left after its operating expenses are paid — which might be considered similar to &quot;profit&quot; — must be spent on the charitable or public purpose(s) for which it was organized, not paid as a dividend or benefit to anyone associated with running or organizing it.

===Federal taxes===

Not only must the organization meet the requirements that the state where it is organized sets for non-profits, but it must also meet complex IRS regulations. These regulations are used not only to determine if the organization is exempt from tax under the organization&#x27;s activities as a non-profit organization. If the organization purpose is one of those described in §501(c)(3) of the &quot;Internal Revenue Code&quot;, it may apply for a ruling that donations to it are tax deductible to the persons or business entities who make them. The organization itself will be exempt from taxation as long as it does not engage in unrelated business activities. Such organizations are then required to file Form 990.

As well the IRS has enacted intermediate sanctions should the members of the organization engage in practices that may excessively benefit any of the organization&#x27;s members (or officers, directors, etc.) rather than revoking the organization&#x27;s exempt status (which was the only option available before the adoption of intermediate sanctions) the IRS may now levy a penalty on the organization for engaging in a transaction that resulted in a private inurement or private benefit. See the entry on intermediate sanctions for more detailed information.

===Differing requirements at the state and federal levels===

The State Laws are organized to initiate the non-profit process which is required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to apply for non-profit status. Some States lack Laws that require non-profits that do not get approved for Federal tax exemption to amend their business type to for profit. It is clear that the https://www.usa.gov/start-nonprofit
states that United States non-profit laws relate to taxation, not just activities that benefit the public. Most States require the Federal tax exemption approval via a &quot;determination letter&quot; to apply to become State tax exempt. The steps required to become a nonprofit include applying for tax-exempt status. If States do not require the &quot;determination letter&quot; from the IRS to grant non-profit tax exemption to organizations, on a State level, claiming non-profit status without that Federal approval, then they have actually violated Federal United States Nonprofit Laws. Many State lawmakers do not have knowledge of these facts and therefore do not realize they are non-compliant.

==Organization==

Generally, non-profits and people operating non-profits must comply with all of the same laws which would apply to for-profit businesses. There are exceptions for taxes (noted above) and some exceptions related to First Amendment concerns, noted below. Directors and officers of non-profits owe a fiduciary duty to the non-profit and its beneficiaries similar to the duties owed by directors and officers of for-profit corporations. Non-profits can have vicarious liability for injuries caused by their employees or volunteers to third parties, such as by traffic accidents. For this reason it is prudent for any non-profit to obtain liability insurance. Non-profits which have paid staff must comply with minimum wage laws, and with the requirement in most states to obtain workers compensation insurance.

Churches and religious non-profits are something of a special case, because the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids the government making a law &quot;respecting an establishment of religion,&quot; and also forbids &quot;prohibiting the free exercise thereof [that is, of religion].&quot; The First Amendment originally bound only the U.S. Federal Government, but by incorporation through the 14th Amendment, also binds state and local governments. Under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act many generally applicable state laws regarding employment, zoning and the like are relaxed for churches.

Similarly, some non-profits, as private organizations, are not subject to the anti-discrimination laws which might apply to similar organizations serving the public for profit.

Charity non-profits face many of the same challenges of corporate governance which face large, publicly traded corporations. Fundamentally, the challenges arise from the &quot;agency problem&quot; - the fact that the management which controls the charity is necessarily different from the people who the charity is designed to benefit. In a non-profit corporation, the &quot;agency problem&quot; is even more difficult than in the for-profit sector, because the management of a non-profit is not even theoretically subject to removal by the charitable beneficiaries. The board of directors of most charities is self-perpetuating, with new members chosen by vote of the existing members.

==Business ethics in non-profits==
Non-profit organizations are presented with the same complex challenges that would be found in any other business. The organizations must maintain an image, and they do this by managing stakeholder relationships to retaining donors, particularly during times of environmental change. This places a premium on knowing which stakeholders really matter if an effective relationship marketing strategy is to be developed, according to the Journal of Business Ethics.

Marketing strategies within non-profit organizations differ from commercial businesses. For example, non-profits will often pursue multiple, non-financial marketing objectives; they market for social change, which Liao et al. (2001) referred to as a ‘societal orientation’; and they garner more public attention, both positive and negative, than the average business (Shapiro, 1973). Thus, appealing more towards the public opinion.

There are two fundamental tasks which senior management teams address prior to
articulating any new marketing strategy. These fundamental strategies are:

• Develop a rigorous approach to determining and agreeing on stakeholder saliencies across the
organization.

• Auditing their current marketing practices across each of these stakeholders and assess their ability to produce the desired result.

==Charitable fraud prevention==
In the United States, prevention of charitable fraud is mostly a function of state governments, and laws vary widely from state to state. Approximately 45 states have laws regulating charities and require registration before soliciting donations.

The Journal of Business Ethics reports that fraud losses affect not only small, local charities run by volunteers but also large, well-known charities with thousands of employees. Examples include $1.5 million of employee theft at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, $43 million of improper payments to grantees at The Global Fund, and a $26 million endowment write-off at New York University due to a fraudulent investment manager.

Many charities prefer to handle cases of fraud quietly because public disclosure can be costly. In addition to the direct cost of the diverted assets, disclosing a fraud may cause the charity to lose future donations or volunteers. Moreover, other charities and society at large can suffer from the spillover effects of diminished trust in the nonprofit sector as a whole (Bradley 2015).

<text>Balaena is a genus of cetacean (whale) in the family Balaenidae. &quot;Balaena&quot; is considered a monotypic genus, as it has only a single extant species, the bowhead whale (&quot;B. mysticetus&quot;). It was named in 1758 by Linnaeus, who at the time considered all of the right whales (and the bowhead) as a single species. Historically, both the family Balaenidae and genus &quot;Balaena&quot; were known by the common name, &quot;right whales&quot;, however &quot;Balaena&quot; are now known as bowhead whales.
Throughout history, the family Balaenidae has been the subject of great taxonomic debate. Authorities have repeatedly recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. In the early whaling days, they were all thought to be a single species, &quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot;. Eventually, it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were in fact different. Later, morphological factors such as differences in the skull shape of northern and southern right whales indicated at least two species of right whale—one in the Northern Hemisphere, the other in the Southern Ocean. As recently as 1998, Dale Rice, in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification, &quot;Marine mammals of the world: systematics and distribution&quot;, listed just two species: &quot;Balaena glacialis&quot; (the right whales) and &quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot; (the bowheads).

A DNA study by Rosenbaum in 2000, and another study by Churchill in 2007 finally provided clear evidence to conclude that the &quot;three&quot; living right whale species do comprise a phylogenetic lineage, &quot;distinct from the bowhead&quot;, and that the bowhead and the right whales are rightly classified into two separate genera. The right whales, therefore, are now officially in the genus &quot;Eubalaena&quot;.

The fossil record of &quot;Balaena&quot;, dating to the late Miocene, encompasses ten species known from finds in Europe, North America, and South America. Balena, described by Scopoli in 1777, and Leiobalaena, described by Eschricht in 1849, are junior synonyms of &quot;Balaena&quot;.

<text>Tina Ellen Hobley (born 20 May 1971) is an English actress and radio presenter, best known for her long-running role as Chrissie Williams in the BBC One medical drama series &quot;Holby City&quot;. Hobley left Holby City in November 2013 after 12 years.

==Early life==
Hobley was born in Hampstead. She was very shy as a child, and was sent to speech and drama classes in an attempt to counter her introversion. She grew up in the London suburb of Mill Hill and attended Bishop Douglass School in East Finchley. Hobley later transferred to the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art.

==Career==

===Television===
After graduating from the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where she trained from 1990 to 1993, Hobley had a number of roles in a variety of television dramas, including &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Samantha Failsworth, &quot;Harbour Lights&quot; as WPC Melanie Rush and &quot;The Bill&quot; as Sue Booker.

Hobley is best known for her role as ward sister Chrissie Williams in BBC medical drama &quot;Holby City&quot;.

===Radio===
On 3 October 2013, Smooth Radio announced that Hobley would become a presenter on the network, fronting a programme on Sunday mornings.

Hobley presented &quot;The Smooth Drive Home&quot; on Smooth London from January 2017 until July 2019.

===Theatre===
From January to July 2015 Hobley co-starred with Jamie Lomas, Rik Makarem, Michael McKell and Gray O&#x27;Brien in a touring production of Peter James&#x27;s &quot;Dead Simple&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hobley&#x27;s first marriage was to graphic designer Steve Wallington in 1998. Their daughter Isabella, &#x27;Bella&#x27;, was born in April 1999; the couple divorced in 2001.

On 22 April 2006, Hobley announced her engagement to Oliver Wheeler, and they married later that year. Hobley gave birth to their daughter Olivia on 18 April 2008, and on 1 March 2010 to son, Orson. 

Hobley is a supporter of the Starlight Foundation. She is also an Ambassador for Barnardo&#x27;s, and supports the Terrence Higgins Trust and the White Hat Rally.

In February 2016 she withdrew from competing in the reality show &quot;The Jump&quot; after dislocating her shoulder, breaking her arm and rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament. Seven months after sustaining these injuries she still had not fully recovered. The damage to her body had limited her movement to the point where she has been unable to perform basic daily tasks by herself.

<doc id="1226639" wikidata="Q2456233" url="?curid=1226639" title="Tom Lund">
<text>Tom Lund (born 10 September 1950) is a former Norwegian football coach and striker. He played his entire career at Norwegian club Lillestrøm, taking them from the third division to the first and winning the Double. He never played professionally, despite receiving offers from big international clubs. He is widely considered one of the greatest Norwegian football players of all time.

In all official competitions, he played 348 matches and scored 197 goals for Lillestrøm (of which 274 matches and 154 goals were recorded in league competition), helping his club win the Norwegian Cup in 1977, 1978 and 1981, and the Norwegian top division in 1976 and 1977. He retired from football in 1982 while still being regarded as one of the best players in Norwegian football.

He won 47 caps with the Norwegian national team.

== Club career ==
As a youth, Lund was talented in every sport he attempted. He played handball, bandy and ice hockey for the Lillestrøm first teams well into his football career. After winning a local track and field tournament in 1971, he briefly considered practicing decathlon, with the goal of qualifying for the 1976 Olympics. Nonetheless, football was always his main focus.

He debuted for the Lillestrøm first team on 7 May 1967 at the age of 16. They played in the third division, and were close to relegation. Lund quickly became considered by far the best player on the team, and one of the best in Norway. He made his debut on the national team in 1971, at the age of 20. Meanwhile, the club kept slowly improving, and spent several years close to promotion.

While in the third division, Lund struggled economically, and received offers from many top Norwegian clubs. But his biggest offer came in 1973 from Ajax, then the best club in Europe, who wanted him to fill the gap left by Johan Cruyff. The negotiations were national news in Norway and in the Netherlands. Lund was offered around 1 million kroner for a two-year contract (equivalent to around 8 million kroner, or €800,000, in 2024), the highest for any Norwegian player at the time. Lund was close to accepting, but eventually declined the offer, in large part because he thought the contract was too long. He later turned down offers from Real Madrid, Leeds United, Middlesbrough, Bayern Munich, and Feyenoord, among others.

In 1973, after seven seasons of playing, Lund and Lillestrøm finally promoted to the second division. They dominated the 1974 season, losing only a single game to secure promotion to the first division, while reaching the quarter finals in the cup. Lund scored 21 out of 44 goals for the team. They entered the 1975 season as the best team in Norway. After 10 out of 22 matches played, Lillestrøm was in first. However, in their tenth game, against Fredrikstad, Lund tore his ankle. He had to sit out several weeks to get surgery. The team lost every match without Lund. He struggled with injury for the rest of the season, and Lillestrøm placed seventh.

In 1976, when Lund was 26, after ten years at the club, Lillestrøm won the first division. It was the beginning of a golden age for the club. In the 1977 season, with manager Joe Hooley, they won the double, and beat Ajax 2–0 at home in the first round of the European Cup (though they lost 2–4 in the aggregate). Norwegian newspaper &quot;VG&quot; named Lund player of the year for 1977, together with Helge Karlsen. In 1978, they placed second in the league, but again won the cup, and reached the second round of the European Cup.

Lund spent most of 1979 and 1980 struggling with injury. There was real fear that Lillestrøm would face relegation without him, but the club still managed a fifth place finish in 1979. In 1980, he could play more games, primarily in the cup, where they reached the final before losing to Vålerenga 1–4, in addition to placing third in the league. Nonetheless, it was considered a dissappointing result for the club.

Lund returned in 1981 for arguably his best season. Lillestrøm won the cup, and &quot;VG&quot; named Lund player of the year. He was also named Norwegian Sportsperson of the Year, the first football player to receive the award. However, with these victories, he also lost the hunger to play. Norwegian football was still not professional, and Lund had a burgeoning business that he wanted to focus on. He remained on the team to help them transission through a relatively quiet 1982 season, placing fourth in the league, after which he retired at the age of 32.

== Managerial career ==
Lund coached Lillestrøm from 1985 to 1987, and again in 1990. He helped the team win the cup in 1985, and the league in 1986.

== International career ==
Lund was capped 47 times for the Norwegian national team, 5 as captain, and scored 12 goals. He made his national debut in 1971, while still in the third division, in a 2–1 victory against Iceland. He is widely thought to have scored the equalizing goal in Norway&#x27;s 2–1 win over England on 9 September 1981, although the goal was credited to Roger Albertsen. Norway did not qualify for any major tournament while Lund played.

Lund has a fear of flying, which was a problem for international games. He would travel by car to away games when he could—including to games played in Bulgaria, Hungary and Italy. If he had to fly, he would spend the match dreading the flight home.

== Style of play ==
Lund was thin, and fairly short, and was considered weak in the air. But he was renowned for his speed, dribling, and feints, and especially his first step, which he used to get past any defender. His goal against Mjøndalen in 1976, where he dribbled from the corner, along the edge of the field past five Mjøndalen defenders, before scoring, has been called the greatest goal in Norwegian history.

Lund was also renowned for his set-pieces. After manager Joe Hooley joined, Lund took every set-piece for Lillestrøm. When they took the Double in 1977, Lillestrøm scored 50 goals from set-pieces, all set by Lund.

Because Lund played his entire career as an amateur in Norway, speculations about his true skill and potential have been popular. He was consistently praised by international opponents: Scottish manager Willie Ormond and Northern-Irish manager Terry Neill both considered him to be good enough for any team in the world. Former Bayern Munich defender Einar Aas placed his skill below Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, but no worse than Kevin Keegan. Former Lillestrøm teammate and Hamburger SV midfielder Erik Solér opined that Lund&#x27;s set-pieces were no worse than David Beckham, and that he was better at everything else.

<text>Henry Dalziel, VC (18 February 1893 – 24 July 1965) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was awarded the VC while serving with the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War. Dalziel&#x27;s VC was the 1,000th awarded. After the war, Dalziel returned to Australia and tried to make a living by farming. Troubled by the injuries he sustained during the war, he left the land and took up factory work. He moved between jobs several times during the 1930s, and led something of a transient lifestyle, even at one stage turning to gold prospecting. In the mid-1930s he rejoined the army in a part-time capacity and during the Second World War served in a training role in Australia. He died in 1965 at the age of 72.

==Early life==
Henry Dalziel, the son of a Queensland miner, was born on 18 February 1893 in Irvinebank. After completing his education he began working as a fireman on the railway.

==First World War==
Dalziel volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in early 1915 and was posted to the 15th Battalion as a reinforcement. He served throughout the Gallipoli Campaign until he was evacuated, along with the rest of his battalion, to Egypt in December 1915. From July 1916, he served on the Western Front in France and fought in the Battles of the Somme, Pozières and Mouquet Farm. His service continued into 1917, including the Battle of Messines, but he was wounded at Polygon Wood during the Battle of Passchendaele. He returned to the front in June 1918.
It was during the Battle of Hamel that Dalziel performed the deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). Assigned to the battalion&#x27;s transport company as a driver, he volunteered to join the attack to make up for a manpower shortage that the battalion was experiencing at that time. On 4 July 1918 at Hamel Wood, when determined resistance was coming from an enemy strong-point which was also protected by strong wire entanglements, Dalziel, armed only with a revolver, attacked an enemy machine-gun. He killed or captured the entire crew and, although severely wounded in the hand, carried on until the final objective was captured. He twice went over open ground under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire to obtain ammunition and, although suffering from loss of blood, continued to fill magazines and serve his gun until wounded in the head. The citation for his VC, published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, read:

Dalziel&#x27;s VC was the 1,000th such medal to be awarded. His wounds were so severe that his brain was exposed and he was evacuated to England for medical treatment. It was not until January 1919 that he returned to Australia.

==Later life==
Discharged from the AIF in July 1919, the following year he married Ida Maude Ramsay, who had served as a nurse with the 17th Australian General Hospital. The couple took up a block of land for farming but his wife was primarily responsible for its running. After a few years, Dalziel tired of farming and moved to Sydney, where he took up factory work. His wife remained on the farm. He then tried his hand at gold mining in the Bathurst region before later returning to the farm when his wife became ill. By 1933, he was living in Brisbane but out of work. At this time, having maintained an interest in song writing since his time in hospital recuperating from his war wounds, he had some of his work published in England and the United States.

From 1933, Dalziel served in the Citizen Military Forces and was a sergeant in the 9th/15th Battalion. During the Second World War, he did not serve abroad. Instead he supported recruitment and funding drives. He also conducted talks for troops at training camps. His final posting before he was discharged from the Army in December 1943 was to the 11th Training Battalion. In 1956, he travelled to England for the VC centenary celebrations. In late life, Dalziel lived in Oxley.

On 24 July 1965, Dalziel had a stroke and died at the Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane. He was cremated with full military honours. A plaque in his memory is laid at Mount Thompson crematorium, Brisbane.

==Legacy==
On 25 November 2010, a group of Dalziel&#x27;s medals and associated documents were auctioned by Noble Numismatics in Sydney, fetching AUD $525,000.

<text>Cheadle Hulme School is a coeducational private day school in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, England, for pupils aged 3 to 18. It is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

Founded in 1855 as the Manchester Warehousemen and Clerks&#x27; Orphan Schools, it sent pupils to an existing school in Shaw Hall, Flixton, before it moved into its own premises in Park Place, Ardwick, in 1861, and to its current location Cheadle Hulme in 1869.

The school became independent in 1976 when the Labour government abolished the direct grant system.

The school grounds covers 83 acres, and has over 1,500 pupils. Its educational experience is built upon the three pillars of being &quot;Academic, Altruistic and Active&quot;.

The most recent inspection report commended the school for its inclusive, values-driven ethos and the diverse and enriching educational experiences it offers to all pupils. The report commented that &quot;the school&#x27;s &#x27;Waconian Values&#x27; of resilience, integrity, endeavour, contribution and compassion are central to how the school operates&quot;. It also highlighted the school&#x27;s co-curricular programme as a significant strength.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
In the early 1850s, life expectancy for those working in the inner-cities was extremely poor and Manchester was no exception. Many of these workers were worried about the fate of their children should they die. A school for the orphans of warehousemen and clerks, which later became the Royal Russell School, had already been set up in London in 1853. On 20 September 1854, a representative from the London school met with some Manchester men (one of whom was Ezekiel Browne) in the Albion Hotel to gather support for it. During the discussion, support for a local school became clear, and following this meeting a committee was formed to develop the idea. The school was to be called &quot;The Manchester District Schools for Orphans and Necessitous Children of Warehousemen and Clerks&quot;, and it was to be open to all children, regardless of gender or religious background.

The proposal was advertised to warehousemen and clerks across the north-west of England. The men were asked for one guinea or more per year, which would pay for their child&#x27;s education and well-being, should the father die and the family left &quot;necessitous&quot;. A set of rules was created, which outlined how the school should be run; these were adopted at the first meeting of the subscribers of 26 February 1855. The rules included the ages of admission (between 7 and 12 years old), with boys being taught until the age of 14, and girls until the age of 15, and that the school was for orphans and necessitous children of warehousemen and clerks only. Proposals for a complementary day school were discussed extensively, but this idea was postponed until the orphan school had been successfully set up.

In July 1855, the committee sent out advertisements for the election of the first children to the school. The earliest scholars were elected by subscribers to the institution. The condition of their election depended on a few factors, including how long the child&#x27;s father had subscribed and the family&#x27;s circumstances. Subscribers had a number of votes depending on how much money they had subscribed. Fifteen applications had been received by September, and on 29 October 1855, commonly referred to as the school&#x27;s founding date, six children were elected into the school at the Athenaeum in Manchester.

At this time there were no premises or staff since the committee wished for more time to plan for their own premises and staff. The children were instead sent to an existing boarding school in Shaw Hall, Flixton. However, six years later they moved to Park Place, Ardwick, in the centre of Manchester. By this time it had already been decided that a new school should be built and the foundation stone of the main building in Cheadle Hulme was laid in 1867. The school moved to its present site two years later.

=== Foundation scheme ===
Since the beginning, the school had been a boarding school, originally for the orphans (fatherless children) (known as &quot;Foundationers&quot;) for whom it was established. As early as 1862, it started to accept fee paying boarders and an increasing number of day pupils to help to support the &quot;Foundation Scheme&quot;.

From 1921 the school had also decided to become part of the government&#x27;s education programme, choosing in 1926 to become part of the Direct Grant system, with some of the day pupils funded by grants from the Board of Education. However, boarding remained the keystone of the school&#x27;s objects and the cornerstone of its pastoral and sporting activity (even as late as the 1960s), but the number of Foundationers was declining. In the 1950s the annual subscription to the Foundation Scheme was raised from one guinea to two guineas, but with the creation of the Welfare State joining the scheme became increasingly less popular. In 1955 there were 82 Foundationers and 44 paying Boarders. Seven years later, these figures had reversed.

=== War years ===
During World War I, the school hospital was used by the Red Cross for treating over 1,400 injured soldiers.

Students from Manchester High School for Girls and Fairfield High School for Girls Droylsden were evacuated to the school during World War II. 

Sixty Old Waconians lost their lives in World War I, and 46 in World War II.

An increasing number of day pupils were taken during the Second World War to help with the war effort as new schools in the areas could not be built.

At the part of the school called laundry hill (next to where food and nutrition is now), there are some steps that are now covered by bars but once used to lead to air raid shelters made during the Second World War. 

Girls from Manchester High School were evacuated to the school, so there had to be shelter for over 1000 people, and they put &#x27;dugouts&#x27; on the field to accommodate them.

The Broomefield (what used to be the headmaster&#x27;s house) was built in 1906 had additional air raid shelters put in the cellars during the Second World War.

=== Independent status and growth ===
By the 1950s and 1960s, Cheadle Hulme School had become a renowned direct grant grammar school, deciding to become, again, independent in 1976 when the Labour government abolished the Direct Grant Scheme.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the school continued to thrive. With the expansion of the junior school, the school roll topped 1,000 pupils for the first time and an anonymous donation allowed for a refurbishment of the boarding house, although the number of children choosing to board was steadily declining. By the beginning of the 1990s, the number of boarders had dropped to only 77 so the decision to close the boarding house was made by the new Head Mr Donald Wilkinson. The old dorms have since been converted into classrooms. The rest of the school was growing, however, as a new Infants Department opened in 1998, taking children from the age of 4. New buildings sprang up in the 1980s and 1990s including specialist buildings such as for the ICT and MFL departments.

On 26 October 1995, the school became a Grade II Listed Building.

== Junior School ==
Built in 1970, the main Junior School building houses ten classrooms. An Infant Department was opened in 1998 and expanded further in September 2002 to accommodate an extra class at Reception, Year 1 and Year 2. There are two classes in each year group from Reception to Year 4, increasing to three classes from Year 5 within the Junior School. Students progress to the next year group automatically in the Junior School, then all pupils are required to take our entrance exam into the Senior School with the vast majority of pupils moving up into the Senior School.

There are a wide range of clubs ranging from food club to tennis. Pupils have two sports lessons and one swimming lesson per week. Year 5 and 6 students take part in regular matches in football, netball, hockey, swimming, cricket and athletics. Music lessons are held once a week in the Infants and twice a week in the Juniors. Pupils have regular opportunities to perform in assemblies, concerts and dramatic productions. The Junior School has many facilities available to it including a library, swimming pool, field, astro-turf pitch and tennis and netball courts.

The current headteacher of the Junior School is Mr Vincent Weightman.

== Academics ==
The school offers a wide range of subjects, with students taking GCSEs (mostly Edexcel International GCSEs, with exceptions for a few subjects) at the age of 16 and A Levels in the sixth form. Sixth Form students are offered a variety of subjects which can be chosen in any combination alongside a range of extension ‘Plus 1’ options, through the Sixth Form Pathways programme. These are Extended Project Qualification, Core Maths, Arts Award, Elite Sport Programme, and Fourth A level subject.

== Co-curricular activities ==

=== Sport ===
CHS has a strong reputation for sport, the core sports being football, rugby, netball, hockey, and cricket. The school has a number of players who play at county and country level in a variety of sports. Pupils can earn school colours for good sporting performance. 

=== Music ===
The school offers a wide range of musical opportunities to students, including a choir and various bands (concert, wind, big band). The school has a record of ambitious music making, which was initiated by Geoffrey Keating, Director of Music during the 1960s. Keating went on to become Director of Music at Millfield School in Somerset, but left behind a thriving choral tradition. To this was added, during the 1970s, some equally ambitious orchestral activity. The school orchestra has tackled works such as symphonies by Beethoven and Dvořák, Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; and the &quot;Cello Concerto&quot; by Elgar. The department is currently headed up by Mr Andrew Petit (Director of Music).

Every year the school puts on two concerts, a Spring Concert and a Winter Concert. All students who take part in musical clubs/activities within the school are invited to attend. Past venues include Stockport Town Hall and the RNCM.

Every year there is a Music Festival, a competition in which instrumentalists and vocalists compete in different categories to be crowned &#x27;Young Musician of The Year&#x27;. Guest judges, usually well-esteemed musicians, help decide the winner. There are usually new judges every year.

=== Drama ===
CHS has a large Drama department which produces a number of annual plays involving wide areas of the school. In recent years the school has produced &quot;Billy Liar&quot;, &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, Guys and Dolls, &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;.

=== Politics ===
Regular mock elections and referendums are held, giving sixth-form students a chance to lead a campaign, followed by a school-wide vote.

The school Think Tank club has played host to guest speakers such as former pupil BBC political editor Nick Robinson, MPs Mark Hunter, Graham Brady and Kate Green and BBC North West political editor Arif Ansari.

=== Model United Nations ===
Model United Nations (MUN) is a popular student activity. The school has developed a fine reputation as a leading MUN school, with students having won numerous awards for the standard of their debate and research skills at conferences across the United Kingdom and in Europe. As well as attending many large international conferences, the school also plays host to Model United Nations Cheadle Hulme (MUNCH). MUNCH is a popular MUN conference attended by schools from across the United Kingdom and, increasingly, from around the world.

=== Trips ===
Cheadle Hulme School students have the opportunity to take part in a number of educational trips to enhance their understanding of the subjects that they are studying.

Students have enjoyed a number of trips in recent years, including:
* Washington D.C., where they have taken part in activities such as tours of the Pentagon, The White House and Congress, meetings with US interest groups such as Common Cause, and visits to the Smithsonian Institution.
* Westminster and Whitehall, where students have met with politicians such as shadow Chancellor George Osborne, Old Waconian Alf, Lord Dubs, local MP Mark Hunter and journalists from the Reuters news agency.
* Brussels, including visits to the European Commission and European Parliament.
* Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
* The Battlefields.
*Berlin
* Eyam.
* The Gambia. A geography trip to the Gambia to study ecosystems and visit the Gambia High School, a school linked to CHS. Social action aspects are also included in the trip with mosquito nets, books and pens etc. given to the young people of the linked school along with time spent with children of local refugee schools.
*Tokyo technology trip

And for Lower School, years 7 to 9
* Day trips to Chester, Manchester Jewish Museum and many other places.
* Brittany trip for Year 8s.
* Ski trip to the Swiss Alps.

=== Other activities ===
Other extracurricular activities include the business start-up scheme Young Enterprise, a philosophical society, Chess club, Go club, German club, Film club, Gourmet club, and participation in a local Mock Trial competition. Students are also encouraged to take part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. Students also have been taking part in F1 in Schools where they have won awards throughout the years. There are many more activities which cover a wide range of areas including cooking, building, and photography.

The school also holds the Future Self Convention every two years where people from different universities and occupations come to answer students&#x27; questions about certain career paths.

==Notable alumni==
Alumni of Cheadle Hulme School are known as &quot;Old Waconians&quot;, a remnant of the original name of the school (&quot;Warehousemen and Clerks&quot;).

<doc id="1226646" wikidata="Q1157975" url="?curid=1226646" title="Dallara">
<text>Dallara Group S.r.l. is the largest multi-national Italian race car manufacturer, founded by its current President, Giampaolo Dallara. After working for Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini and De Tomaso, in 1972 in his native village of Varano de&#x27; Melegari (Parma), he created Dallara Automobili. 

Dallara is the sole manufacturer of racing cars for the IndyCar Series, Indy NXT, FIA Formula 2, FIA Formula 3 and Super Formula Championships. The company also produces cars for endurance races such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 24 Hours of Daytona.

Dallara has also been involved in the development and production of both Formula E cars and Haas F1 Team cars.

==Early years==
The company was founded by designer Giampaolo Dallara in 1972 in Varano de&#x27; Melegari, near Parma, Italy, and started building chassis for sports car racing and hillclimbing, racing in the smaller engine classes. Dallara designed his first Formula Three car for Walter Wolf Racing in 1978. Dallara also had a brief involvement in Formula 3000 in the mid-1980s.

==Formula Three==
The first F3 car under the Dallara name came in 1981, and the cars became particularly successful in Italy. Since 1985 Dallara drivers have taken the Italian Formula Three Championship every year except 1990. The late 1980s and early 1990s also saw Dallara make inroads into the German and French markets, winning the German title in 1987 and the French in 1987 and 1992.

1993 was the first year that Dallaras were entered in the British Formula Three Championship and was the beginning of the company&#x27;s dominance of Formula Three. The new F393 featured major aerodynamic changes compared to its predecessor and introduced a monodamper front suspension layout. The F393 won every race in the Italian, French and German championships that year, while the British series saw numerous entrants – including champion Kelvin Burt – forced to switch from Reynard or Ralt chassis to Dallara in order to remain competitive. TOMS would win the Japanese championship with its own cars in 1993 and 1994 before switching to Dallara chassis. From then on Dallara would dominate the Formula Three market, although Martini had some success in France and Germany in the late 1990s, including Sébastien Bourdais winning the French title in 1999. Since then Dallara has won every major Formula Three title, although Ho-Pin Tung won the 2006 Recaro F3 Cup in a Lola against a field that included several current Dallaras. Dallaras have won the Macau Grand Prix since 1993.

==Formula One==
In the company became a Formula One constructor, after being hired by BMS Scuderia Italia to build their chassis. The relationship between the Italian constructor and Beppe Lucchini&#x27;s racing outfit endured until , with their best result being two third places: one at the 1989 Canadian Grand Prix with Andrea de Cesaris; the other at the 1991 San Marino Grand Prix, thanks to JJ Lehto. The Constructors&#x27; Championship results were: no classification in 1988, 8th in 1989 (with 8 points), 15th (with no points) in 1990, 8th in 1991 (with 5 points) and 10th in 1992 (with 2 points) by Pierluigi Martini.

Dallara returned briefly to F1 in 1999, building the test-chassis for Honda&#x27;s planned but aborted return to the series.

During 2004, Dallara recruited ex-Jordan, Stewart and Jaguar F1 designer Gary Anderson, leading to speculation that the Italian company was working on another F1 project. Late in 2004 the nascent Midland team announced that Dallara would be designing and building their Formula One chassis which was due to be entered for the 2006 season. Following Midland&#x27;s purchase of the Jordan team for early entry to F1 in 2005, Dallara continued co-operating with the team technically. However, the relationship fizzled out as Midland focussed its resources on developing the existing Jordan infrastructure, and a new Dallara F1 chassis never appeared.

Dallara built the cars for Hispania&#x27;s entry in the season. The Hispania team&#x27;s financial problems—which delayed payment of money owed to Dallara and the completion of the cars—and the alleged low quality of the F110 chassis resulted in the two parties officially ending their partnership in May 2010. The car was used in all 2010 races without any development except the graphics. They had only one aerodynamic configuration, used for all races, including Monte Carlo and Monza. Geoff Willis, who joined Hispania in March 2010, criticized the F110, saying that he was disappointed at the quality and level of engineering in the car and that the design of the car was missing a lot of contemplating practices commonly employed in the process of building a Formula One car.

On 15 April 2014 Gene Haas confirmed his new Formula One team, Haas F1 Team, had entered talks to form a partnership with Dallara in 2015 for the build of their first car. On 21 February 2016, the Haas VF-16 was officially unveiled. This arrangement has continued since with Dallara designing all the Haas cars up to and including the season.

==IndyCar==
Dallara debuted as a chassis builder and supplier at the IndyCar Series in 1997, and has been the single chassis builder and supplier since 2007. The manufacturer has won seventeen of the twenty Indianapolis 500s they have contested. In 2013, Dallara reached its milestone 200th Indy car victory at Barber.

In 2012 the company opened an engineering center in Speedway, Indiana, at the Speed Zone Redevelopment Area near the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where they produce and assemble the IndyCar. The same building also houses an entertainment center, where visitors can learn how a racing car is manufactured.

===First generation (IR-7)===
Dallara was one of the original three chassis constructors when the Indy Racing League debuted its own chassis formula during the 1997 season. The first model year (1997) was named the IR-7. The cars were most notably differentiated from the competing G-Force chassis by the ovoid shape of the air intake inlet, while the G-Force&#x27;s were triangular and molded around the roll bar. The IR-8 (1998) and IR-9 (1999) were essentially 1997 model year chassis with various update kits.

Jim Guthrie won Dallara&#x27;s first Indy car race at Phoenix on 23 March 1997. Eddie Cheever won Dallara&#x27;s first Indianapolis 500 in 1998, in his Oldsmobile-powered IR-7 chassis.
===Second generation (IR-00)===
A new model chassis was introduced for the 2000 season; named the IR-00. When updated for 2001 the chassis was designated as the IR-01 and for 2002 it was referred to as the IR-02.

===Third generation (IR-03/IR-04/IR-05)===
For the 2003 season, Dallara rolled out the new IR-03 chassis. This chassis would later become the &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;spec-car&quot; in the series. An aerodynamic update kit was released for 2004, which changed its designation to IR-04 and later in 2007, which changed its designation to IR-05. In addition, paddle-shifters began seeing use in 2008, further developing and evolving this generation of Dallaras. Chassis bearing both the IR-03 and the IR-05 designations saw use through the end of the 2011 season.
For the 2006 season, over 80% of the field began the season with a Dallara, a possible symptom of Panoz&#x27;s (manufacturer of the G-Force chassis) perceived lack of interest. This was around the time Panoz began delivering the DP01 chassis to the rival Champ Car series. From 2007 to 2011 all IndyCar teams used the IR-05 chassis, although a few teams entered a Panoz/G-Force chassis into the 2007 Indianapolis 500 singly. Some smaller teams continued to utilize the slightly older IR-03 designated chassis, particularly at Indianapolis, with update kits installed to bring it up to equally competitive ground with the newer-assembled IR-05 due to cheaper costs. Dan Wheldon famously won the 2011 Indy 500 driving a nine year old IR-03.
IndyCar implemented a general chassis and engine development freeze from the start of the 2009 season. The series began focusing on a new chassis/engine package to be rolled out for 2012. By this time, the Dallara IR-03/05 was exclusively paired with the Honda Indy V8, as other engine manufactures had departed.
===Fourth generation (IR-12/DW-12)===

Starting in 2012, Dallara began providing the common monocoque and suspension parts for the new IndyCar formulae – known as the IndyCar Safety Cell – with the intent that the bodywork and aero parts can and will be provided by other manufacturers. The cars will be branded by the make who provides the &quot;Aero Kit.&quot; Dallara rolled out the chassis with its own optional spec aero kit. The aero kit concept was temporarily shelved due to cost concerns, making the Dallara kit the universal spec for 2012-2014. Unique aero kits (manufactured by Chevrolet and Honda, respectively) were introduced for 2015-2017, and Dallara ceased to support and production of their own. In 2018, the third generation of aero kits was introduced for the DW-12, again returning to a universal spec kit for all entries known as UAK18 and will be used until 2026. On 18 October, Dallara confirmed that the 2012 series car would be named after the late IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon (DW-12) in honor of his work testing the car before his death two days prior at Las Vegas, with the new bumper/nerf bar section being featured, it was designed to prevent many similar single-seater crashes such as the one that killed Wheldon.
==Other formulas==

In 2002, Dallara became the exclusive supplier for World Series by Nissan, a move that allowed them to gain the contract for the World Series by Renault in 2004. Dallara was also appointed by the FIA to be the sole chassis builder, partner and supplier of the FIA Formula 2 Championship (formerly GP2 Series) and the new FIA Formula 3 Championship (formerly GP3 Series), giving them a near-monopoly of every motorsport series used as a direct entry point into F1.

In 2007 Dallara created a new car model, known as the &quot;Formulino&quot; (&quot;little formula&quot;), in order to fill the gap between karts and Formula Three. The first series to use the new concept was the ADAC Formel Masters in 2008, and the MRF Challenge also adopted the car.

Dallara has provided the spec chassis to the Indy NXT series, formerly the Indy Lights Series since 2002. For the 2015 Indy Lights season, the car was replaced by the new generation Dallara IL-15, powered by Mazda&#x27;s 2.0-litre turbocharged MZR-R four-cylinder engine.

Dallara also designed the chassis for the Japanese Super Formula series, formerly known as Formula Nippon, called the Dallara SF19. This update to the previous chassis (the Dallara SF14) followed the FIA&#x27;s new safety guidelines and added the &quot;halo.&quot;

==Endurance car racing==
 

In the early 1980s, Dallara was responsible for the construction of the Lancia LC1 Group 6 prototype as well as the later LC2 Group C car, along with Lancia&#x27;s partner Abarth. It would not be until 1993 that Dallara returned to endurance racing, although very few chassis would take their name. The first project was the Ferrari 333 SP, made for the new WSC regulations in the IMSA GT Championship. The 333 SP, manufactured at Michelotto, won a great number of races both in North America and Europe. Ferrari also hired Dallara to develop the racing version of the Ferrari F50, the F50 GT, financed by French racing driver Fabien Giroix, but the project was aborted before it got off the ground, in 1998.

As a consequence, the company secured other contracts and built chassis for Toyota (GT-One), Audi (various incarnations of the R8) and Chrysler (the Oreca-run Chrysler LMP). Later, the Chrysler LMP would become Dallara&#x27;s customer car available to privateers, known as the Dallara SP1, which has also served as a test mule for Nissan&#x27;s aborted return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans. All these cars were competitive in prototype sports car racing, with the Audi R8, in particular, becoming the most dominant chassis in modern times at the 24 Hours and the American Le Mans Series. In 2002, they built the GC21 for use in the Fuji Grand Champion Series; the car was based on the company&#x27;s F3 cars.

In March 2008 the first Dallara Daytona Prototype appeared, built-in collaboration with Doran for Wayne Taylor&#x27;s SunTrust Racing team.

In 2015, Dallara was named as one of four constructors for the LMP2 and DPi class regulations to debut in 2017, using its Dallara P217 chassis. In 2021, Dallara was named as one of four chassis suppliers for the LMDh sports prototype class, and currently supply BMW with their M Hybrid V8 and Cadillac with their V-Series.R.

==Other notable cars==

In 2007, Dallara and KTM produced the KTM X-Bow, a sports car with two seats, which was launched at the Geneva Motor Show in 2008.

Dallara also provided engineering services for Renault (R.S. 01), Alfa Romeo (8C and 4C), Bugatti (Veyron and Chiron), Maserati (MC12 and MC20), and Lamborghini (motorsport variants of the Huracán)

In 2017, Dallara showed its first road car, the Stradale, on the occasion of Giampaolo Dallara&#x27;s 81st birthday.

==Handbikes==

Dallara also produces handbikes, under Z-Bike. They also designed a handbike for Alex Zanardi for the Men&#x27;s Para-cycling at the Paralympics, leading Zanardi to win 4 gold and 2 silver medals at the 2012 and 2016 Paralympics respectively.

==Aerospace==

For the &quot;Rosetta&quot; probe, Dallara designed the drill that is part of the &quot;Philae&quot; robotic lander. Dallara has also partnered with Raytheon to provide the MALD for the United States Air Force.

<text>BMS Scuderia Italia SpA (sometimes referred to as simply Scuderia Italia) is an auto racing team founded in 1983 in Brescia by Italian businessman and motorsports enthusiast Giuseppe Lucchini. Originally named Brixia Motor Sport (BMS), the team initially competed in the World Touring Car Championship. The team&#x27;s name was altered to BMS Scuderia Italia upon their entrance into Formula One in . After departing Formula One in , BMS Scuderia Italia has continued to be involved in other categories such as touring car racing and sports car racing.

Scuderia Italia has been associated with many automobile manufacturers, including Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Ferrari, Nissan, Porsche, and Aston Martin. The team raced Ferrari F430s in the FIA GT Championship, while their Brixia Racing arm competed in the FIA GT3 European Championship and Italian GT Championship with Aston Martin DBRS9&#x27;s.

==Brixia Motor Sport==
Giuseppe Lucchini started his career in motoracing in the late 1970s with Osella. He later moved on to Mirabella Racing, where he oversaw the team&#x27;s efforts in the Italian Group 6 Championship and the World Endurance Championship. In 1983 Lucchini decided to form his own team. Named after the original Latin name for the team&#x27;s base of Brescia, Brixia Motor Sport campaigned an Alfa Romeo GTV6 in the Italian Rally Championship before replacing it with a Lancia 037 in 1985. Brixia returned to Alfa Romeo in 1987 as the team expanded to enter the new Alfa Romeo 75 in both the World Touring Car Championship and the Italian Rally Championship.

==Formula One==
When Alfa Romeo chose to withdraw from the World Touring Car Championship in 1987, Lucchini set his sights on entering the Formula One World Championship in the coming year. Brixia brokered a deal with Dallara owner Giampaolo Dallara to build a new chassis based on their experience as a Formula 3000 entry. Lucchini renamed his team BMS Scuderia Italia (with Dallara being the listed constructor for the purposes of the World Constructors&#x27; Championship standings) and hired former Scuderia Mirabella owner Vittorio Palazzani as sporting director. Sergio Rinland designed the new Dallara F188 and also served as the team&#x27;s chief engineer. Cosworth provided their Ford DFZ V8 and Italian Alex Caffi was signed to drive the team&#x27;s sole entry. The car was late being completed, forcing the team to bring a Dallara Formula 3000 car to the first meeting in Brazil. The team was unable to score any points, but qualified for fourteen of sixteen races during the year. Caffi earned a best finish of seventh at the Portuguese Grand Prix, one position outside of the points.

Returning for , BMS Scuderia Italia entered a second car for the experienced Italian Andrea de Cesaris alongside Caffi. The team&#x27;s new Dallara F189s were designed by new engineer Mario Tolentino. At the third race of the year, the Monaco Grand Prix, Caffi earned the team&#x27;s first points finish when he came home in fourth. Later that season, at the Canadian Grand Prix, the team scored points with both drivers, De Cesaris earning the team&#x27;s first podium by finishing third and Caffi by finishing sixth. There were no more point finishes for the rest of the season, although Caffi qualified an outstanding third in the Hungarian Grand Prix and both cars qualified in the top 10 in the season-ending Australian Grand Prix. De Cesaris and Caffi were thus ranked 17th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, while the combined total of eight points earned Dallara eighth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

In , team manager Patrizio Cantù departed the team and was replaced by former Ferrari engineer Pierpaolo Gardella. Alex Caffi also left the team, moving to Arrows. Emanuele Pirro was signed as his replacement, although Gianni Morbidelli raced for the first two races of the season when Pirro was unwell. The team struggled throughout the year, unable to earn points in any races (although de Cesaris started 3rd in the season-opening United States Grand Prix) and was only able to complete seven of the sixteen Grands Prix on the calendar.

Disappointed with the Dallara F190, Lucchini replaced Tolentino with Nigel Cowperthwaite in for the design of the F191, and the team&#x27;s Ford Cosworth engines were replaced by new Judd V10s. Jyrki Järvilehto, otherwise known as JJ Lehto, was signed to replace De Cesaris, who had moved to Jordan, and gained BMS Scuderia Italia their first points of the season by finishing third at the San Marino Grand Prix. Pirro scored his first points by finishing sixth at the Monaco Grand Prix. Dallara once again finished eighth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship standing.

In 1992 Lucchini was able to negotiate the use of year-old Ferrari V12 engines for the season and hired Pierluigi Martini as a replacement for Pirro who had been released by the team. Martini scored the team&#x27;s only points of the year with two consecutive sixth-place finishes at the Spanish Grand Prix and San Marino Grand Prix, earning him sixteenth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and Dallara tenth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.
At the end of 1992, Lucchini announced that the cars for the season would be built by Lola Cars in Britain, with Ferrari remaining as the engine supplier. The team secured a sponsorship deal with Chesterfield cigarettes, and Lucchini signed Michele Alboreto and rookie Luca Badoer as drivers.

The team&#x27;s switch to Lola, however, did not improve the team&#x27;s results. The chassis was not competitive, and despite good engine power, Alboreto and Badoer struggled to qualify for several races. Badoer had the team&#x27;s best finish of the year at the San Marino Grand Prix with a seventh place, ensuring the team finished ahead of Tyrrell Racing, whose best finish was Ukyo Katayama&#x27;s tenth place at Hungaroring, in the Constructors&#x27; standings. By the end of the season the team was financially strained and chose to withdraw from the last two events in Japan and Australia. The team did however attend the 1993 Formula One Indoor Trophy, but were eliminated in the semi-finals.

At the end of the 1993 season Minardi was also struggling for money, and Giancarlo Minardi and Giuseppe Lucchini decided to merge their teams in order to continue into the season. The merged team returned to earning points in 1994 as well as before Lucchini chose to exit the venture in order to concentrate BMS Scuderia Italia on other programs.

==Return to touring cars==
When Lucchini&#x27;s Formula One program came to an end in 1993, Nissan approached BMS Scuderia Italia to campaign the company&#x27;s Primeras in the new German Super Tourenwagen Cup, which was announced for 1994. German Michael Bartels and Italian Ivan Capelli were hired and completed the season sixth and eleventh in the drivers&#x27; championship. The team expanded to three cars in 1995, with Capelli joined by Sascha Maassen and Kieth O&#x27;Dor. O&#x27;Dor won the team&#x27;s only race of the season at AVUS and finished tenth in the drivers&#x27; championship; however, he was killed in a collision during the second race at AVUS that weekend.

Anthony Reid replaced O&#x27;Dor on the squad in 1996, but the team chose not to run the full season with all cars. Maassen led the team in the drivers&#x27; championship by finishing sixteenth, but by then Giuseppe Lucchini had decided to move out of the Super Tourenwagen Cup, leaving Nissan to move to Team Rosberg. BMS Scuderia Italia made a brief return to touring car racing in 1998 when they entered a pair of Alfa Romeo 155s for Christian Pescatori and Emanuele Moncini in the Italian Superturismo Championship, but withdrew once more the following season.

==Sportscar==

===1997–2001===
After the departure from the Super Tourenwagen Cup, Giuseppe Lucchini became one of the first customers of Porsche&#x27;s new racing car, the 911 GT1. One of the team&#x27;s former Formula One drivers, Pierluigi Martini, returned to the company and shared the new car with Christian Pescatori in the brand new FIA GT Championship for 1997. The duo scored a best finish of sixth at Helsinki, earning them a single point to tie for ninth in the Teams Championship. BMS Scuderia Italia also entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time with the 911 GT1, Brazilian Antônio Hermann de Azevedo joining Martini and Pescatori. The team finished in eighth place overall and fourth in their class.

In 1999, the company returned to sports car racing, this time purchasing a pair of Ferrari 333 SP sports prototype for use in the Sports Racing World Cup. Pescatori and Moncini were retained from the team&#x27;s Italian Superturismo entry the previous year, while father and son, Angelo and Marco Zadra shared the second entry. Pescatori and Moncini scored a win at the Autodromo di Pergusa, eventually finishing third and fourth respectively in the drivers&#x27; championship. The team earned second in the Teams Championship, fourteen points shy of JB Racing.

For the 2000 season, Austrian Philipp Peter and Swiss Lilian Bryner and Enzo Calderari joined the two Zadras in the Ferraris. A class win was earned by Bryner, Calderari, and Angelo Zadra at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, although they did not win the race overall. The team finished the season second in the Teams Championship once again, while Marco Zadra and Philipp Peter tied for third in the drivers&#x27; championship. Christian Pescatori briefly returned to the squad at the start of the 2001 season of what was now known as the FIA Sportscar Championship, winning alongside Marco Zadra in the first race of the year. Pescatori was eventually replaced by Jean-Marc Gounon, who also earned a victory for the team. BMS Scuderia Italia was able to secure the Teams Championship by a margin of 22 points, while Marco Zadra also won the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

===2002–2005===
With the 333 SP outdated, BMS Scuderia Italia returned to the FIA GT Championship, continuing to campaign for Ferrari by racing two Prodrive-built Ferrari 550 Maranellos in the series. Andrea Piccini and Jean-Denis Délétraz shared the team&#x27;s primary car, while the other car featured Lilian Bryner, Enzo Calderari, and Frédéric Dor, who was eventually replaced by Jean-Marc Gounon. After only three races, Piccini and Délétraz began a streak of consecutive victories, winning at Jarama, Anderstorp, and Oschersleben. A further fourth victory ended the year at Estoril. Even with four race victories, multiple races without points hurt the team and they were scored fourth in the Teams Championship. Piccini and Délétraz shared third in the drivers&#x27; championship.

Under the guidance of new Technical Director Marco Gadola, the team expanded greatly in 2003 as a third car was added to their effort, running under the Care Racing banner. The team&#x27;s driver pairings included Matteo Bobbi and Thomas Biagi, Fabrizio Gollin and Luca Cappellari, and Bryner and Calderari sharing the Care entry with Stefano Livio. The team opened the year on top by finishing first, second, and third at their first race. Bobbi and Biagi dominated the field by winning the next four races in a row, followed by a class win and second overall at the Spa 24 Hours for Gollin, Cappellari, Bryner, and Calderari. Two more wins were earned in the remaining events of the season, giving the team a total of eight victories in ten races, not only earning the Teams Championship for BMS Scuderia Italia, but also third for the Care Racing banner as well. Bobbi and Biagi shared the drivers&#x27; championship, Gollin and Cappellari second in the championship, and Bryner and Calderari third.

The three Ferraris returned to defend their Championships in 2004, retaining much of their driver lineup. Gabriele Gardel was the only replacement, taking over from Thomas Biagi as Bobbi&#x27;s co-driver. The year started well for BMS Scuderia Italia once more as Gollin and Cappellari earned two consecutive victories, while Gardel and Bobbi earned their first at the fourth round of the season. The team also improved on their previous result at the Spa 24 Hours, winning the race overall with Gollin and Cappellari sharing with Bryner and Calderari. Lilian Bryner was therefore the first female driver ever to win an international 24 hours event. The team finished the season with five total victories, winning their second Teams Championship, while Gollin and Cappellari earned the drivers&#x27; championship that year.

Although BMS Scuderia Italia was the defending two-time FIA GT Champion, Giuseppe Lucchini decided to switch series in order to concentrate on endurance racing. Two of the team&#x27;s Ferraris were entered in the new Le Mans Endurance Series as well as the national Italian GT Championship. Christian Pescatori returned to the team, joined by newcomers Michele Bartyan, Toni Seiler, Matteo Cressoni, and Miguel Ramos. The Gollin, Cressoni, and Ramos trio won the opening Le Mans race of the year while Pescatori, Bartyan, and Seiler won two of the remaining four events. In Italian GT, the team won five of the seven races over the year, as well as two races in the GT2 class with a Ferrari 360 Modena GTC run in partnership with Racing Team Edil Cris. Teams Championships were secured in both Le Mans and Italian GT&#x27;s GT1 classes, earning the squad their third consecutive victorious year with the Ferrari 550. The two 550s were also entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the second time in the team&#x27;s history. Both however failed to finish the race, retiring early.

===2006–2007===
After the team&#x27;s success with Prodrive&#x27;s customer version of the Ferrari 550, BMS Scuderia Italia was one of two teams selected by Prodrive to become a factory-backed entry for Aston Martin and their new DBR9 race car. Prodrive&#x27;s own team was concentrating on the 24 Hours of Le Mans, while Larbre Compétition was tasked with competing in the Le Mans Series. This left BMS Scuderia Italia, now running under the Aston Martin Racing BMS banner, to return to the FIA GT Championship as Aston Martin&#x27;s representative. Former FIA GT champion Fabrizio Gollin was partnered with Fabio Babini, while former Le Mans Series champions Pescatori and Ramos shared the second Aston Martin. A trio of new Aston Martin DBRS9s were also entered by the team in the new FIA GT3 European Championship for amateur drivers.

The squad however did not return to the FIA GT Championship in the same fashion in which they had left it in 2004. The team was unable to score any victories, and in fact was unable to finish any better than third on multiple occasions. However, even though the team lacked victories, they were able to consistently score points, enough to finish second in the teams&#x27; championship. Fabio Babini was the team&#x27;s highest scoring driving, earning ninth in the drivers&#x27; championship. The team&#x27;s 24 Hours of Le Mans entry was also short-lived as their lone Aston Martin crashed heavily after only three laps. BMS Scuderia Italia&#x27;s FIA GT3 effort earned a single win for fourth place in the teams&#x27; championship.

For the 2007 season, BMS Scuderia Italia remained Aston Martin&#x27;s primary team in the FIA GT Championship, but the team also purchased a Porsche 997 GT3-RSR for the series&#x27; lower GT2 class. Porsche factory driver Emmanuel Collard drove alongside Matteo Malucelli, earning a class win at the Spa 24 Hours and finishing the season second in the GT2 Teams Championship. The primary GT1 team however struggled throughout the year, earning no victories and earning sixth in the Teams Championship. The team&#x27;s DBR9 however was able to have a strong performance at the 24 Hours of Le Mans by finishing eleventh overall and sixth in GT1. In FIA GT3, the DBRS9 won the final event of the year and the team secured third place in the Teams Championship.

Following the 2007 season, Aston Martin and Prodrive&#x27;s changing efforts in GT1 led BMS Scuderia Italia to end their partnership as a factory team. However, BMS Scuderia Italia&#x27;s private efforts with Aston Martins in the FIA GT3 European Championship remain as the team has resurrected the Brixia Racing name. Drivers Marcello Zani and Matteo Malucelli founded the team to concentrate solely on not just the FIA GT3 series, but also the smaller national Italian GT Championship with the company&#x27;s Aston Martin DBRS9s.

In FIA GT, BMS Scuderia Italia has moved on from both Aston Martin and Porsche, as the team purchased two Ferrari F430s for the GT2 Championship. Paolo Ruberti and Matteo Malucelli share the team&#x27;s #77 entry, while Davide Rigon is partnered with Joël Camathias in the #78. The team also entered one of their Ferraris in the 2008 and 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans races finishing second in the GT2 class in both those years&#x27; races, aided by the return of Fabio Babini.

<text>Beauce () is a natural region in north-central France, located between the rivers Seine and Loire. It comprises the Eure-et-Loir modern-day department and parts of Loiret, Essonne and Loir-et-Cher.

The region shared the history of the province of Orléanais and the county of Chartres, which is its sole major city. Beauce is one of France&#x27;s most productive agricultural areas.

The name derives from Latin &quot;Belsia&quot; or &quot;Belsa&quot;, said by Virgilius Maro Grammaticus to be a Gaulish word meaning &quot;grass plain, cultivated plain.&quot; It was formerly spelled &quot;La Beausse&quot;.

It is the setting of Émile Zola&#x27;s novel &quot;La Terre&quot; (&quot;The Earth&quot;).

<text>Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives (also known as AGS and Gonfaron Sports Cars) was a small French racecar constructor that competed in various racing categories over a period of thirty years, including Formula One from to .

AGS survived as a prosperous Formula One driving school, in Le Luc, near Gonfaron.

==Foundation==
The team was founded by the French mechanic, Henri Julien, who ran a filling station, the &quot;Garage de l&#x27;Avenir&quot;, in Gonfaron, a provincial French village. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Julien regularly attended racing events in minor classes. Although not an outstanding driver, the technical knowledge he gained eventually prompted him to start constructing racing cars.

==First car==
Julien&#x27;s first car, the AGS JH1, saw the light of day in 1969. It was a small single-seater, intended for the category of &quot;Formule France&quot;. The car was designed by Julien&#x27;s former apprentice, the Belgian mechanic Christian Vanderpleyn, who had been with the garage (and the racing team) since the very late 1950s and who would stay on until 1988. Soon, AGS went progressed and manufactured its own Formula 3 cars, which were ambitious but not good enough to compete seriously with the state-of-art Martinis which dominated the series at the time.

==Formula 2==
AGS took another step ahead in 1978 when the team started competing in the European Formula 2 Championship. Still, the car - by now the AGS JH15 - was self-penned (by Vanderpleyn), self-built and self-run. Formula 2 was a difficult task for the small team, racing 1978 and 1979 without scoring any championship points. The early 1980s were somewhat better. AGS was one of the few teams who ran its own cars (Maurer, Minardi and Merzario were the others), and eventually the team was able to score points regularly. Soon some victories came, too. AGS made history when works driver Philippe Streiff won the final race of Formula 2 in 1984, using an AGS JH19C.

==Formula 3000==
In 1985, AGS switched to Formula 3000 with the JH20, based on the Duqueine VG4 Formula 3 chassis. The JH20 used a Cosworth DFV engine supplied through the Swiss tuning firm Mader.
Results were mediocre in 1985 and 1986.

==Formula One==

===Beginnings===
By late summer , AGS entered the Italian Grand Prix in Monza, its first Formula One race. Its structure was somewhat bizarre: The team had no more than 7 employees and was still operated from the &quot;Garage de l&#x27;Avenir&quot; in Gonfaron.

AGS appeared with a car that was once again penned by Vanderpleyn. The JH21C was a strange mixture between former AGS F3000 vehicles and Renault F1 parts which were used extensively. The car was powered by a well-used Motori Moderni turbo engine (the only time these Carlo Chiti-developed engines were given to a customer team) and driven by Italian Ivan Capelli. A few weeks before, the car had been tested at Paul Ricard by Didier Pironi, driving an F1 car for the first time since his leg-breaking accident in the 1982 German Grand Prix. Due to technical difficulties, neither in its first attempt nor in the following race in Portugal did Capelli see the finish.

For the team&#x27;s first full F1 season in , Vanderpleyn penned the JH22, which used a normally-aspirated Cosworth DFZ but was otherwise much the same as the JH21C. The car was initially driven by Pascal Fabre, who had driven for the team in Formula 2 in 1982. He proved to be a reliable driver, finishing eight of the first nine races, but was never in serious contention for scoring points and failed to qualify on three occasions. AGS improved in the last two races of the season when Fabre was replaced by the Brazilian Roberto Moreno (who saw his first chance in Formula One since 1982 when he had failed to qualify a Lotus works car). In Adelaide, Moreno scored the first championship point for AGS, which meant that the team finished the season equal on points with the better-financed Ligier and the returning March team.

===Takeover===

In , AGS started with a new car, the JH23, and Philippe Streiff as the team&#x27;s only driver. Streiff drove quite powerfully and qualified well, but he saw the chequered flag only four times; in all the other events of that year technical failures or accidents were recorded. Financially, the year started well and ended with a disaster. AGS had a solid sponsor - the French Bouygues group - which promised to support not only the racing activity but also the completion of a new factory outside Gonfaron. After AGS had started work on the new facility, Bouygues withdrew from the team, leaving Julien without any support. To save the team, he eventually had to sell it to Cyril de Rouvre, a French entrepreneur with various ambitions.

===Difficulties===
Things went soon from bad to worse. The new team management changed frequently (Vanderpleyn for instance went to Coloni) and brought a lot of disorder. Worse was to come; Streiff was paralysed in a testing accident in Brazil before the season.

Streiff was replaced with Gabriele Tarquini, who surprised with some great performances in the first half of the season. He was very close to the points in both the 1989 Monaco Grand Prix and 1989 United States Grand Prix, but retired in both races. Then things went better in the 1989 Mexican Grand Prix, where he finished sixth and scored his first point. But after these highlights, the team was never able to be as competitive again.

In the second part of the 1989 season, the team had to prequalify - a task that was nearly never achieved by Gabriele Tarquini and Yannick Dalmas. AGS then finished 15th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, equal with the Lolas used by the Larrousse team. During the summer months, there were strong rumours that AGS would soon use a new W12 engine developed by the French designer Guy Nègre. This strange MGN (&quot;Moteurs Guy Nègre&quot;) machine saw the light of day in late 1988 and was tested in an old AGS JH22 chassis in the summer of 1989. It was clear that AGS was not related to these tests; they were completely private attempts by Nègre. The engine never found its way to a Grand Prix but it was announced to be used in a 1990 Le Mans car called Norma M6. The car was presented and attempted to race, but failed to qualify over engine issues.

Finally, AGS had to use Cosworth engines again in . That year brought no improvement at all, Dalmas&#x27;s 9th in the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix was the best result and by the beginning of the season the team was obviously close to its end. The team lacked money – at the first two Grands Prix of 1991, in Brazil and Phoenix the team&#x27;s mechanics had to pay for their own hotel rooms. In the race itself, Tarquini finished 8th, which was the last finish ever of an AGS car. De Rouvre sold his team to some Italian entrepreneurs, Patrizio Cantù and Gabriele Rafanelli. Both changed little except for the driver line-up (Stefan Johansson was replaced with newcomer Fabrizio Barbazza) and the colours of the car (which were now blue, red and yellow instead of white). A new car, the JH27, was raced in the early autumn, but by then the team was in rags again, so the Italians closed the doors after the 1991 Spanish Grand Prix.

<doc id="1226666" wikidata="Q4680478" url="?curid=1226666" title="Adams operation">
<text>In mathematics, an Adams operation, denoted ψ&quot;k&quot; for natural numbers &quot;k&quot;, is a cohomology operation in topological K-theory, or any allied operation in algebraic K-theory or other types of algebraic construction, defined on a pattern introduced by Frank Adams. The basic idea is to implement some fundamental identities in symmetric function theory, at the level of vector bundles or other representing object in more abstract theories.

Adams operations can be defined more generally in any λ-ring.

==Adams operations in K-theory==
Adams operations ψ&quot;k&quot; on K theory (algebraic or topological) are characterized by the following properties.
# ψ&quot;k&quot; are ring homomorphisms.
# ψ&quot;k&quot;(l)= lk if l is the class of a line bundle.
# ψ&quot;k&quot; are functorial.

The fundamental idea is that for a vector bundle &quot;V&quot; on a topological space &quot;X&quot;, there is an analogy between Adams operators and exterior powers, in which

:ψ&quot;k&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is to Λ&quot;k&quot;(&quot;V&quot;)

as

:the power sum Σ α&quot;k&quot; is to the &quot;k&quot;-th elementary symmetric function σ&quot;k&quot;

of the roots α of a polynomial &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). (Cf. Newton&#x27;s identities.) Here Λ&quot;k&quot; denotes the &quot;k&quot;-th exterior power. From classical algebra it is known that the power sums are certain integral polynomials &quot;Q&quot;&quot;k&quot; in the σ&quot;k&quot;. The idea is to apply the same polynomials to the Λ&quot;k&quot;(&quot;V&quot;), taking the place of σ&quot;k&quot;. This calculation can be defined in a &quot;K&quot;-group, in which vector bundles may be formally combined by addition, subtraction and multiplication (tensor product). The polynomials here are called Newton polynomials (not, however, the Newton polynomials of interpolation theory).

Justification of the expected properties comes from the line bundle case, where &quot;V&quot; is a Whitney sum of line bundles. In this special case the result of any Adams operation is naturally a vector bundle, not a linear combination of ones in &quot;K&quot;-theory. Treating the line bundle direct factors formally as roots is something rather standard in algebraic topology (cf. the Leray–Hirsch theorem). In general a mechanism for reducing to that case comes from the splitting principle for vector bundles.

==Adams operations in group representation theory==
The Adams operation has a simple expression in group representation theory. Let &quot;G&quot; be a group and ρ a representation of &quot;G&quot; with character χ. The representation ψ&quot;k&quot;(ρ) has character

<text>John Thomas Davies (29 September 1895 – 28 October 1955) was an English soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that was awarded in the British Empire, and to this day in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth.

He was 22 years old and a corporal in the 11th (Service) Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment (The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Volunteers), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 24 March 1918 near Eppeville, France, when his company was ordered to withdraw, Corporal Davies knew that the only line of withdrawal lay through a deep stream lined with a belt of barbed wire; he saw it imperative to hold up the enemy as long as possible. He mounted the parapet in full view of the enemy in order to get a more effective field of fire and kept his Lewis gun in action to the last, causing many enemy casualties and enabling part of his company to get across the river, which they would otherwise have been unable to do.

He was taken prisoner after the action. During World War II, he was a captain in the Home Guard. He was buried in St. Helens Borough Cemetery, Lancashire, England. (C. of E. Section. Area 59. Grave 426.)

==The Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London, England.

<doc id="1226673" wikidata="Q1215755" url="?curid=1226673" title="This Fire (Franz Ferdinand song)">
<text>&quot;This Fire&quot; is a song by Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, the seventh track on their self-titled debut album. It was written by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy and produced by the band themselves at their studio in Scotland during 2003. A new version of the song, produced by Rich Costey, was released as a single on 4 October 2004, titled &quot;This Fffire&quot;. The single artwork is based on El Lissitzky&#x27;s art work &quot;Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge&quot;.

==Song history==
&quot;This Fire&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 racing game &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot;. The song was later sampled for &quot;Burn This City&quot; by Lil Wayne and Twista. In 2022, the Rich Costey version of the song was selected as the intro song to &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; tie-in anime from Studio Trigger.

==Release and reception==
In the United States and the United Kingdom, the song was released as a radio and download single, respectively, reaching number 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart and number eight on the UK Download Chart. In Australia, the song was released as a CD single and reached number 62 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In the same country, it was ranked number 29 on Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of 2004.

==Music video==
The music video, directed by Stylewar, echoes the style of 1920s-era Soviet art and propaganda (Constructivism etc.), including Cyrillic lettering, and shows the members of the band spreading a world-wide &quot;hypnosis epidemic&quot;.

==Track listings==
All tracks were written by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy except &quot;Missing You&quot;, written by Kapranos.

<doc id="1226674" wikidata="Q357415" url="?curid=1226674" title="Adipic acid">
<text>Adipic acid or hexanedioic acid is the organic compound with the formula (CH2)4(COOH)2. From an industrial perspective, it is the most important dicarboxylic acid: about 2.5 billion kilograms of this white crystalline powder are produced annually, mainly as a precursor for the production of nylon. Adipic acid otherwise rarely occurs in nature, but it is known as manufactured E number food additive E355. Salts and esters of adipic acid are known as adipates.

==Preparation and reactivity==
Adipic acid is produced by oxidation of a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, which is called KA oil, an abbreviation of ketone-alcohol oil. Nitric acid is the oxidant. The pathway is multistep. Early in the reaction, the cyclohexanol is converted to the ketone, releasing nitrous acid:
The cyclohexanone is then nitrosated, setting the stage for the scission of the C-C bond:
:
Side products of the method include glutaric and succinic acids. Nitrous oxide is produced in about one to one mole ratio to the adipic acid, as well, via the intermediacy of a nitrolic acid.

Related processes start from cyclohexanol, which is obtained from the hydrogenation of phenol.

===Alternative methods of production===
Several methods have been developed by carbonylation of butadiene. For example, the hydrocarboxylation proceeds as follows:
:CH2=CH−CH=CH2 + 2 CO + 2 H2O → HO2C(CH2)4CO2H

Another method is oxidative cleavage of cyclohexene using hydrogen peroxide. The waste product is water.

Auguste Laurent discovered adipic acid in 1837 by oxidation of various fats with nitric acid via sebacic acid and gave it the current name because of that (ultimately from Latin &quot;adeps&quot;, &quot;adipis&quot; – &quot;animal fat&quot;; cf. adipose tissue).

===Reactions===
Adipic acid is a dibasic acid (it has two acidic groups). The pKa values for their successive deprotonations are 4.41 and 5.41.

With the carboxylate groups separated by four methylene groups, adipic acid is suited for intramolecular condensation reactions. Upon treatment with barium hydroxide at elevated temperatures, it undergoes ketonization to give cyclopentanone.

==Uses==
About 60% of the 2.5 billion kg of adipic acid produced annually is used as monomer for the production of nylon by a polycondensation reaction with hexamethylene diamine forming nylon 66. Other major applications also involve polymers; it is a monomer for production of polyurethane and its esters are plasticizers, especially in PVC.

===In medicine===
Adipic acid has been incorporated into controlled-release formulation matrix tablets to obtain pH-independent release for both weakly basic and weakly acidic drugs. It has also been incorporated into the polymeric coating of hydrophilic monolithic systems to modulate the intragel pH, resulting in zero-order release of a hydrophilic drug. The disintegration at intestinal pH of the enteric polymer shellac has been reported to improve when adipic acid was used as a pore-forming agent without affecting release in the acidic media. Other controlled-release formulations have included adipic acid with the intention of obtaining a late-burst release profile.

===In foods===
Small but significant amounts of adipic acid are used as a food ingredient as a flavorant and gelling aid. It is used in some calcium carbonate antacids to make them tart. As an acidulant in baking powders, it avoids the undesirable hygroscopic properties of tartaric acid. Adipic acid, rare in nature, does occur naturally in beets, but this is not an economical source for commerce compared to industrial synthesis.

==Safety==
Adipic acid, like most carboxylic acids, is a mild skin irritant. It is mildly toxic, with a median lethal dose of 3600 mg/kg for oral ingestion by rats.

==Environmental==
The production of adipic acid is linked to emissions of , a potent greenhouse gas and cause of stratospheric ozone depletion. At adipic acid producers DuPont and Rhodia (now Invista and Solvay, respectively), processes have been implemented to catalytically convert the nitrous oxide to innocuous products:
:2 N2O → 2 N2 + O2
==Adipate salts and esters==

The anionic (HO2C(CH2)4CO2−) and dianionic (−O2C(CH2)4CO2−) forms of adipic acid are referred to as adipates. An adipate compound is a carboxylate salt or ester of the acid.

Some adipate salts are used as acidity regulators, including:

* Sodium adipate (E number E356)
* Potassium adipate (E357)

Some adipate esters are used as plasticizers, including:

* Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate
* Dioctyl adipate
* Dimethyl adipate

<doc id="1226676" wikidata="Q173259" url="?curid=1226676" title="Ilmor">
<text>Ilmor is a British independent high-performance motor racing engineering company. It was founded by Mario Illien and Paul Morgan in November 1983. With manufacturing based in Brixworth, Northamptonshire, and maintenance offices in Plymouth, Michigan, the company supplies engines and consultancy to the IndyCar Series and MotoGP.

Ilmor Engineering originally designed built and produced IndyCar engines for Chevrolet. In the 1990s, the company built a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to power F1 cars for both the Sauber and McLaren teams. After the death of Paul Morgan in a vintage aeroplane crash in 2001, Mercedes increased its stake until it owned the entire company, and renamed it Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines Ltd. In 2005, Mario Illien concluded a deal to purchase the Special Projects part of the company in partnership with Roger Penske, which worked in partnership with Honda Performance Development for IndyCar engines between 2003 and 2011. This new company, which is independent of Mercedes, is once again known as Ilmor Engineering Ltd. They developed the Ilmor X3 for the 2007 MotoGP World Motorcycle Championship, entering one race before withdrawing and effectively shutting down the race team, due to funding problems.

Racing remains the core part of the business today and Ilmor acts as a consultant for motorsport clients from all forms of racing. However, the business is now using its racing expertise to diversify into other areas such as OEM automotive, defence, marine and energy efficient engine applications.

==2.65 litre Indy car V-8==

Both engineers were working at Cosworth on the Cosworth DFX turbocharged methanol engine for the CART Indy Car World Series; differences of opinion over the direction in which DFX development should go (Cosworth were inherently conservative as they had a near monopoly) led them to break away from their parent company to pursue their own ideas. There was some acrimony in their split from Cosworth, their former employer claiming that the Ilmor engine was little different from their planned modifications to the DFX.

Founded as an independent British engine manufacturer in 1983, it started building engines for Indy cars with the money of team owner and chassis manufacturer Roger Penske. The Ilmor 265-A, badged initially as the Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V-8, debuted at the 1986 Indianapolis 500 with Team Penske driver Al Unser. In 1987, the engine program expanded to all three Penske team drivers (Rick Mears, Danny Sullivan, and Al Unser), Patrick Racing, and Newman/Haas Racing. Mario Andretti, driving for Newman/Haas, won at Long Beach, the engine&#x27;s first Indy car victory. He also won the pole position for the 1987 Indianapolis 500. Rick Mears earned the first victory for the engine in a 500 mile race at the 1987 Pocono 500. A year later, Mears won the 1988 Indianapolis 500, the engine&#x27;s first win at Indianapolis. The engine went on to have a stellar record in CART. From 1987 to 1991, the &quot;Chevy-A&quot; engine won 64 of 78 races.

In 1992, the 265-A engine was followed up by the 265-B engine. The &quot;Chevy-B&quot; was fielded singly by Penske Racing (Rick Mears and Emerson Fittipaldi) in 1992 and won four CART series races. All other Ilmor teams remained with the venerable &quot;Chevy-A&quot; for 1992. Bobby Rahal, driving a &quot;Chevy-A&quot; won the 1992 CART championship, the fifth consecutive (and final) for the 265-A. Al Unser Jr. won the 1992 Indianapolis 500 driving a &quot;Chevy-A&quot;, also the fifth consecutive (and final) Indy 500 win for the 265-A. Emerson Fittipaldi drove a &quot;Chevy-B&quot; to 4th place in points, but both he and Mears dropped out of that year&#x27;s Indy 500 due to crashes. It was at this time that Ilmor was receiving new competition from Cosworth, which had just introduced their new powerplant, the Ford-Cosworth XB.

For the 1993 season, the 265-C engine was introduced, intended to replace both the 265-A and the 265-B. The &quot;Chevy-C&quot; was used widespread, and produced continued success for Ilmor. Some backmarker teams continued to utilize the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; engines during the 1993 season, but neither the &quot;A&quot; nor the &quot;B&quot; would win another Indy car race. Chevrolet dropped its badging support after the 1993 season.

For the 1994 season, two new engines were introduced. The 265-D engine replaced the 265-C, although some of the smaller teams still ran the &quot;C&quot; throughout 1994. Without badging support, the engines were referred to simply as the &quot;Ilmor-C&quot; and the &quot;Ilmor-D&quot;. The other engine introduced in 1994 was the top-secret 265-E (see below), which was actually a 3.43 liter pushrod engine, used by Penske Racing at the 1994 Indianapolis 500.

For 1995, Mercedes-Benz became the badging manufacturer for the Ilmor Indy car engines. The engine continued to be a strong contender on the CART circuit. In 1996, the open wheel &quot;split&quot; began between CART and the IRL. Ilmor primarily was a provider for CART-based teams, and did not provide engines for any full-time IRL teams. At the 1996 Indy 500, the &quot;Ilmor Mercedes-Benz D&quot; was used by Galles Racing, and finished second, the powerplant&#x27;s one and only start in an IRL-sanctioned race. When the IRL switched to normally-aspirated engines for 1997, the 265s were no longer permitted in the IRL and the Indy 500, and from that point on raced in the CART series exclusively.

==F1 debut==

In 1991 Ilmor entered Formula 1 with a V10 engine as exclusive supplier to the ambitious Leyton House team (formerly March). After some troubles Leyton House returned to racing as March in 1992, still using Ilmor engines. Ilmor also supplied engines to the Tyrrell team, starting from 1992. Powered by the Ilmor V10, Tyrrell scored eight points through Andrea de Cesaris and March another three through Karl Wendlinger.

==Sauber==

Ilmor were gaining a reasonable reputation in F1, and so the Sauber sportscar team and Mercedes-Benz, who were planning their Formula One entry together, signed a deal with Ilmor after scrapping plans for a Mercedes engine. In order to protect their image, Mercedes took on an observational role in the project and the cars had &quot;Concept by Mercedes-Benz&quot; written in the engine cover.

After scoring 12 points in 1993, Mercedes entered officially in 1994 using an updated version of the 1993 engine, and now &quot;Powered by Mercedes-Benz&quot; was seen on the Sauber engine-cover. The same year Mercedes-Benz acquired Chevrolet&#x27;s 25% share of Ilmor.

In 1994 Ilmor also supplied the new Pacific GP team of Keith Wiggins with the old 1993 spec customer engines. In 32 attempts, the Pacific cars qualified seven times. After Pacific GP Lotus lost its Ilmor customer supply deal to Ford Zetec in 1995, Ilmor decided to reposition its Formula One involvement.

==Racing in the United States==

The 265D V8s ran the entire 1994 Indy Car season badged as &quot;Ilmor Indy V8&quot;, with Team Penske headlining the program, which included free engines.

In 1994, Ilmor produced the Mercedes-Benz 500I engine for Team Penske (although work on this started long before the Mercedes takeover as a private project between Ilmor and Penske). The 500I exploited a loophole in the engine rules at the Indianapolis 500 (which was run under slightly different rules to other CART races). Originally stock-block engines based on production units, fitted with two pushrod and rocker arm actuated valves per cylinder, were permitted to run at increased cubic capacity (3.43 litres vs 2.65 litres) and significantly greater turbo boost than the pure racing engines. For several years Buick V6 units had been extremely fast but fragile; the restrictions were relaxed with the intent of permitting Buick-like engines to use stronger but still production-like blocks – the Menard engine based on the Buick took this approach, as did the unsuccessful Greenfield V8.

Ilmor realized that this provided scope for a completely new pure-bred racing engine – it would need to retain pushrods, but could be designed specifically for the requirements of the Indianapolis 500, and in strict secrecy schemed a completely new V8 engine which was approximately more powerful than the Cosworth XB and Ilmor 265D opposition. Team Penske&#x27;s cars were by far the fastest at the 1994 Indianapolis 500, and Al Unser Jr. won the race, with Emerson Fittipaldi also figuring strongly until an accident on lap 184. The loophole was closed for 1995, and Penske, a year behind on development for Indy, failed to qualify their 265D-powered cars for that year&#x27;s 500.

For 1995 the 265D V8s were rebadged Mercedes and continued to be highly competitive, with Al Unser Jr. finishing runner-up with four wins. Rahal-Hogan Racing joined Penske as major teams, as Bobby Rahal collected five podiums to finish third in the overall standings. In 1996, Penske&#x27;s Unser Jr. finished fourth, Rahal seventh and his teammate Bryan Herta eighth, with neither collecting wins. In 1997, Unser Jr. had a poor season, whereas Penske teammate Paul Tracy claimed three wins but retired in the last five races to finish fifth in the standings. PacWest drivers Maurício Gugelmin and Mark Blundell claimed four wins combined and finished fourth and sixth in the standings. Forsythe driver Greg Moore got two wins and three second places, but retired in eight races and finished seventh. After the CART-IRL split, Mercedes gradually lost interest in American racing and left CART after the 2000 season.

Ilmor continued working in the United States on the Oldsmobile Aurora V8 for the IRL Penske entries.

In 2003 Honda partnered with Ilmor on the Honda Indy V8 engine between 2003 and 2011 for co-assembling, preparation, tune-up and maintenance. At the conclusion of the 2011 season, Honda discontinued their partnership with Ilmor subsequently moving all design, development and production in house without any third-party tune-up partnership to HPD, for the 2012 Honda Indy V6.

In 2012 Chevrolet returned to the IndyCar Series, partnering with Ilmor on the Chevrolet Indy V6 engine program and supplying free engines for Team Penske and rest of Chevrolet-powered IndyCar Series teams are customers by pay lease system.

Ilmor is the option specification engine supplier of engines for the ARCA Menards Series and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. Truck Series teams are allowed to use the option crate engine based on the LSX, and many teams have switched to the option engine. Ilmor was heavily criticized when four of its NT1 engines failed during the 2019 World of Westgate 200 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, effectively eliminating ThorSport Racing drivers Grant Enfinger and Johnny Sauter from the playoffs. Matt Crafton also experienced an engine failure during the race, but survived the playoffs due to his points standings. The manufacturer took responsibility for the engines that suffered from severe detonation due to the combination of the high engine load condition combined with the extreme weather conditions in Las Vegas. Despite Ilmor&#x27;s announcement, NASCAR denied ThorSport&#x27;s request to reinstate Enfinger and Sauter into the playoffs.

In 2021 Ilmor partnered with Edelbrock to supply the 396 engine, which is primarily used in ARCA, for the Superstar Racing Experience.

==Mercedes-Benz in Formula One==

Back in F1, for 1995 Mercedes had set its sights on higher goals and went looking for an engine supply deal with a more competitive team. Sauber had the opportunity to become a customer team, but team principal Peter Sauber opted to sign a deal with full-works Ford instead. From then on Ilmor built the Mercedes-Benz engines exclusively for McLaren after Ilmor repositioned its Formula One involvement from independent engine manufacturer to trusted engine builder and assembler to Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines (akin to Mecachrome with Renault and Cosworth with Ford schemes).

The Ilmor engines went on to be hugely successful with McLaren, scoring several podiums in both 1995 and 1996, leading to three wins in 1997 and back to back drivers championship in 1998 and 1999, as well as the constructor&#x27;s championship in 1998. Although they did not win another championship until 2008 the Ilmor-Mercedes engines won several races.

In 2001 Paul Morgan was killed while landing one of his vintage airplanes, a Hawker Sea Fury at Sywell Aerodrome, Northamptonshire. In 2002 DaimlerChrysler increased its share to 55% and renamed the company Mercedes-Ilmor. In 2005 DaimlerChrysler became the sole owner of Ilmor and renamed the company Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines Ltd.

==Ilmor Engineering, Inc. – expansion to the U.S.==

Ilmor Engineering, Inc., a sister company to Ilmor U.K., was incorporated in 1990 with the primary goal of providing engineering support to customers using the Ilmor Ltd.-manufactured Chevrolet 265A Indy Car engine. In 1998, the headquarters moved from its original facility in Redford, Michigan, into a custom-built, facility in Plymouth, Michigan. The new facility housed all of the necessary disciplines to support the Indy Car program including design, engineering, engine building, engine test, performance development and trackside support functions.

From its start as an Indy Car engineering and trackside support group Ilmor, Inc.’s capabilities have grown to encompass design and analysis tools, engine and sub-systems test capabilities – including emissions compliance benches, precision manufacturing, electronics and wiring design and manufacture, and facilities for service and support.

Today, the expanded facility (over 44,000 square feet) houses more than 100 people, and produces high performance products in multiple powertrain related arenas including auto racing, boat racing, high-performance road cars, high performance offshore powerboats and custom V-twin motorcycles.

==Diversification – Ilmor High Performance Marine, LLC.==

As part of a broader desire to diversify the U.S. company&#x27;s business base, Ilmor, Inc., entered the high-performance marine world in 2002, building race engines for the SuperCat Offshore Racing Series of the American Power Boat Association (APBA). Recognizing the business potential, Ilmor worked with then co-owner DaimlerChrysler to marinize and modify the Dodge Viper&#x27;s V10.

Late that year, the first two prototype 550 HP engines were installed in a new sport rubber dinghy. In close collaboration with Pete Hledin of Douglas Marine (the parent company of Skater) and Bob Morgan of Big Thunder Marine, the Ilmor V10&#x27;s underwent extensive durability testing and the results were encouraging.

Armed with enough knowledge and experience from the initial marine exposure and having completed a comprehensive study of the marine business at large, Ilmor made long term plans to enter the powerboat business in a serious manner. Since 2004, Ilmor&#x27;s high-performance marine division has enjoyed substantial growth, becoming a well-established supplier in the U.S. and European boat market. In addition to the MV10-550 engine, Ilmor created two additional performance variants: the MV10-625 in 2005, and the MV 7-10 in 2006. The 700-horsepower, naturally aspirated marine engine was developed with significantly improved fuel efficiency and a light-weight package. The MV10-550 was later upgraded to the 570 hp in 2006.

In 2009, Ilmor had to utilize its engineering expertise to create an entirely new generation of MV-10 marine products. Emissions requirements established by the California Air Resources Board (the most stringent in the U.S.), the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the European Union meant that all high-performance marine engines had to meet tough new exhaust emissions standards. The MV10-650 and the MV10-725, along with state-of-the-art Ilmor designed electronics were created to not only meet but exceed every requirement of the new regulations. Ilmor&#x27;s MV10-725 is the highest output emissions certified gasoline engine commercially available in Europe.

As part of its overall marine business development plan, Ilmor also unveiled the all-new INDY high-performance stern-drive in 2009. The INDY drive, two and a half years in the making, was designed to complement not only all of the current Ilmor high-performance marine engines but to handle the power and torque of several other engines aimed for introduction at a later time. The addition of the INDY drive placed Ilmor High Performance Marine firmly into the ranks of marine powertrain suppliers.

==Powerboat Racing World Champions==

As a natural step for Ilmor, a decision was made in 2007 to enter the MV10 engine into powerboat competition. The twist for Ilmor, which is accustomed to manufacturing bespoke racing engines, was to race only engines identical to those already sold to the more typical high-performance powerboat customer. In the first year of competition for the engines, a pair of Ilmor Marine MV10-625 engines powered the #99 Fountain Worldwide “King of Shaves” powerboat to the coveted 2007 Powerboat P1 Evolution Class World Championship. The successful first year of competition was backed up with two additional European based Powerboat P1 World Championships in 2008 and 2009 and World Championship success in the US in 2008. The success validated Ilmor&#x27;s belief that its production based high-performance marine engine could race and win against any competition throughout the world.

There has also been great success for the “Cinzano Bianco” race team in the UK marathon powerboat racing world championships. This boat was first raced in 2008 in the Cowes-Torquay-Cowes powerboat race with the MV10-625 engine. With the crew of Tim Grimshaw, Eric Smillie and Nik Keyser. It came fifth overall and second in marathon class B. It was then raced again in 2009 in the marathon class B series and came first in class and first overall for the class and the whole of the marathon powerboat series. With the crew of Marcus Hendricks, Eric Smillie and Tim Grimshaw. Then in 2010 it was re-rigged with the new range of MV10-725 engines. Shortly after the re-rig the boat was raced in the Around Ireland 2010 powerboat race, which it won overall and won its class. It was then raced in the Cowes-Torquay-Cowes powerboat race of 2010. With the crew of Marcus Hendricks, Eric Smille and Simon Woodpower.

==MotoGP==
In 2006, Ilmor announced that they would enter a two-bike team in the MotoGP motorcycle racing series and would enter a single rider team as a wildcard entry in the final two races of the 2006 season. For the 2007 MotoGP season, engine capacity was to be reduced to 800cc from 990cc so Ilmor&#x27;s wildcard entries in 2006 would be the first appearance of an 800cc MotoGP motorcycle at a race meeting.

Former 500 cc race winner Garry McCoy was confirmed as the rider for the Michelin-shod bike in its 2006 appearances, scoring points both in the 2006 Portuguese Grand Prix at the Autódromo do Estoril and the 2006 Gran Premio de la Comunitat Valenciana, becoming the first rider to score points on an 800cc MotoGP machine, though McCoy finished last on both occasions, four and seven laps down respectively.

On 18 December 2006, Ilmor Engineering confirmed via their website that Jeremy McWilliams and Andrew Pitt had been selected as riders for the 2007 season. On 15 March 2007 after one race, the team announced that they were taking a break from Moto GP as a result of funding issues. On 30 April they announced that they would run a &quot;slimmed-down&quot; set-up focused purely on engine development, releasing all unnecessary personnel but keeping riders McWilliams and Pitt under contract.

<doc id="1226685" wikidata="Q171596" url="?curid=1226685" title="Hesketh Racing">
<text>Hesketh Racing was a Formula One constructor from the United Kingdom, which competed from 1973 to 1978. The team competed in 52 World Championship Grands Prix, winning one and achieving eight further podium finishes. Its best placing in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship was fourth in 1975. Hesketh gave James Hunt his Formula One debut, and he brought the team most of its success. Alan Jones also began his Formula One career in a privately entered Hesketh.

==Formation==
Lord Hesketh, in partnership with Anthony &#x27;Bubbles&#x27; Horsley as driver, entered various Formula Three events around Europe in 1972, aiming simply to have as much fun as possible. Due partly to Horsley&#x27;s lack of experience, there were few results. Hesketh ran his race team out of the stables at his Easton Neston family estate in Northamptonshire.

Hesketh subsequently employed James Hunt, who had a reputation for being very fast but also for crashing frequently, and who was unemployed at the time. Hesketh took on Hunt as one of his drivers for F3.

The Hesketh team had a growing reputation for their playboy style, arriving at races in Rolls-Royce cars, drinking champagne regardless of their results, and checking the entire team into five-star hotels. The team had a patch specially made for Hunt&#x27;s driving suit which read: &quot;Sex – The Breakfast of Champions&quot;.

By the middle of the season, Hunt and Horsley had written off both of the team&#x27;s Formula Three cars. Horsley decided to leave the cockpit, switching to the team&#x27;s management. Hesketh rented a Formula Two March car for the rest of 1972, and bought Hunt a Surtees Formula Two car for 1973. Hunt then wrote the car off at the Pau Grand Prix. Hesketh worked out that the cost involved in competing in the top flight was hardly more expensive than F2, and decided to move the team up to Formula One.

==Formula One==

===James Hunt era===

Hesketh rented a Surtees TS9 for the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, with Hunt finishing third. This success led to the purchase of a March 731, with Hesketh also signing junior March Engineering designer Harvey Postlethwaite to modify the chassis, working from Hesketh&#x27;s Easton Neston estate. The car made its first appearance at the 1973 Monaco Grand Prix, where Hunt ran sixth before the engine failed. He scored a point at the team&#x27;s next entry, the French Grand Prix, improved to fourth for the British Grand Prix, and then third for the Dutch Grand Prix. He then took second place in the season-closing United States Grand Prix.

In 1974, Postlethwaite designed an all-new car for the team, the Hesketh 308, which was ready for the Silverstone International Trophy, which Hunt won, making its championship debut at the South African Grand Prix. The car was strong, taking third place at the Swedish Grand Prix, the Austrian Grand Prix and the United States Grand Prix. For 1975, examples of the 308 were sold to Harry Stiller Racing, who gave Alan Jones his grand prix debut. Polar Caravans also purchased a Hesketh chassis, while the works team modified the 308 for Hunt. At the same time, Horsley was developing into an efficient and competent team manager and under his guidance, the team moved forward.

Hunt won the wet-dry 1975 Dutch Grand Prix, holding off Niki Lauda&#x27;s dominant Ferrari, and also led at the British Grand Prix and the Austrian Grand Prix, taking several placings on his way to fourth overall.

===Post-Hunt===
In late 1975, Hesketh announced that he could no longer afford to try to produce the next British world champion, having raced without sponsorship, and ended his involvement with the team. Hunt was offered the lead drive at McLaren, replacing Emerson Fittipaldi.

Postlethwaite took his upgraded 308C design to Wolf–Williams Racing. Horsley upgraded the 308 to the 308D and continued as Hesketh Racing. Harald Ertl signed to drive the car, with the team&#x27;s image landing &quot;Penthouse Magazine&quot; and Rizla as sponsors. Guy Edwards joined in a second car from the Belgian Grand Prix onwards with Alex Ribeiro bringing in some funds later in the year. Ertl&#x27;s seventh place at the British Grand Prix was the team&#x27;s best result of the year. Future Williams engineer Patrick Head noted that the 308D had significant aerodynamic issues at the rear of the car which hindered performance.

Frank Dernie designed the new 308E chassis for the season, with Rupert Keegan driving alongside Ertl. Later in the season a third car was entered for Héctor Rebaque, with Horsley simply trying to bring in money to the team. Ertl left and was replaced by Ian Ashley, but by now Keegan&#x27;s was the only entry that usually made it to the grid, and his seventh place at the Austrian Grand Prix was the team&#x27;s best finish of the year.

In the team slimmed down to a single car, with backing from Olympus Cameras. The car itself was barely upgraded, and Divina Galica failed to qualify for the first two races. Eddie Cheever then managed to get into the South African Grand Prix, retiring with a fractured oil line. Derek Daly was the next to try the car, and at the wet International Trophy at Silverstone, in his debut, diced for the lead with James Hunt&#x27;s McLaren before a stone cracked his visor and ended his race. However, in world championship events he failed to qualify for the next three races, after which the team folded.

==Sports cars==
The Ibec-Hesketh 308LM, also later referred to as the &quot;Ibec P6&quot; and the &quot;Ibec 308LM Cobra&quot;, is a one-off sports prototype racing car that was built in 1978, and was designed by Postlethwaite around many components of the Hesketh 308 Formula One car. The car was funded by Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance broker Ian Bracey, who formed the Ian Bracey Engineering Company to oversee the project.

Unlike many privateer sports car entrants in the late 1970s, Bracey harboured serious hopes of winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. Rather than buy an only partially competitive off-the-peg chassis on which to build, Bracey commissioned former Hesketh chief designer Postlethwaite to design a brand new chassis around a detuned 3.0-litre Cosworth DFV engine. Postlethwaite used his Hesketh connections to buy both front and rear suspension components from the F1 team, and the building of the car was commenced in the Hesketh workshops. However, as the Hesketh racing team&#x27;s fortunes dipped, the Ibec chassis dropped down the priority list and eventually Bracey moved production to Lyncar in Slough. Here, facing a tight deadline, the Lyncar team managed to complete the car in just over five weeks.

The Ibec design had a main chassis formed by a riveted and bonded aluminium monocoque, behind which the DFV engine and Hewland FG400 gearbox were bolted as stressed chassis members. Suspension was by double wishbones at the front, with twin trailing arms, parallel lower links and single top links at the rear. The car was clothed in fibreglass bodywork which had been properly wind tunnel tested, and which proved highly effective at generating both downforce in corners and stability at high speed. The total cost of designing and building the 308LM was less than £100,000, approximately £0.5 million at 2005 prices, more than most privateer teams, but far lower than many contemporary factory race programs.

The car&#x27;s first competitive outing was, as planned, at the 1978 24 Hours of Le Mans race, driven by Ian Grob and Guy Edwards, with Bracey himself acting as reserve driver. Edwards&#x27;s presence in the team had an additional benefit as his skills at sponsorship negotiation landed the small Ibec team with backing from the giant Chrysler corporation, despite the 308LM being Ford-powered. Edwards qualified the Ibec in 13th position, at an average speed of 133 mph. However, in the race itself the car suffered from mechanical troubles which dropped it to 42nd position after just a few hours. Despite recovering well from this early setback, in the 19th hour the DFV engine failed completely and the Ibec&#x27;s race was over.

The Ibec P6 failed to qualify at LeMans in 1980 and failed to finish in 1981 (driven by Tiff Needell and Tony Trimmer). The car was converted for use in the UK Thundersports championship during the mid-1980s.

<doc id="1226693" wikidata="Q1194365" url="?curid=1226693" title="Pink film">
<text>refers in Japan to movies produced by independent studios that includes nudity (hence &#x27;pink&#x27;) or deals with sexual content. This encompasses everything from dramas to action thrillers and exploitation film features. Many pink films would be analogous to erotic thrillers such as &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; and &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;.

Independent studios that release pink films include OP Eiga, Shintōhō Eiga, Kokuei and Xces. The phrase &#x27;pink film&#x27; came into use after the major Toei began advertising some of its movies as &#x27;porno&#x27; in 1971 and another major Nikkatsu switched to producing only &quot;Roman Porno&quot; films later that year.

Until the early 2000s, they were almost exclusively shot on 35 mm film. Recently, filmmakers have increasingly used video (while retaining their emphasis on soft-core narrative). Many theaters swapped 35mm for video projectors and began relying on old videos to meet the demand of triple-feature showings.

Films that are now regarded as pink films became wildly popular in the mid-1960s, and made up a large part of the Japanese domestic market through the mid-1980s. In the 1960s, the pink films were largely the product of small, independent studios. Around 1970, the major studio Nikkatsu started focusing almost exclusively on erotic content, but Toei, another major film production company, started producing a line of what came to be known as Pinky Violence films. With their access to higher production values and talent, some of these films became critical and popular successes. Though the appearance of the adult video led viewers to move away from pink film in the 1980s, films in this genre are still being produced.

==Description==

The &quot;pink film&quot;, or &quot;eroduction&quot; (erotic production) as it was first called, is a cinematic genre without an exact equivalent in the West. Though called pornography, the terms &quot;erotica&quot;, &quot;soft porn&quot; and &quot;sexploitation&quot; have been suggested as more appropriate, although none of these precisely matches the pink film genre.

The Japanese film ethics board Eirin has long enforced a ban on the display of genitals and pubic hair. This restriction forced Japanese filmmakers to develop sometimes elaborate means of avoiding showing the &quot;working parts&quot;, as American film historian Donald Richie puts it. He wrote:
To work around this censorship, most Japanese directors positioned props—lamps, candles, bottles, etc.—at strategic locations to block the banned body parts. When this was not done, the most common alternative techniques are digital scrambling, covering the prohibited area with a black box or a fuzzy white spot, known as a mosaic or &quot;fogging&quot;.

Some have claimed that it is this censorship that gives the Japanese erotic cinema its particular style. Richie wrote:
Richie makes a distinction between the erotic films of the major studios such as Nikkatsu and Toei as against the low-budget pink films produced by independents such as OP Eiga.

Contrasting the pink film with Western pornographic films, Pia Harritz says, &quot;What really stands out is the ability of pinku eiga to engage the spectator in more than just scenes with close-ups of genitals and finally the complexity in the representation of gender and the human mind.&quot;

Richie and Harritz enumerate the fundamental elements of the pink film formula as:
# The film must have a required minimum quota of sex scenes.
# The film must be approximately one hour in duration.
# It must be filmed on 16 mm or 35 mm film within one week.
# The film must be made on a very limited budget.

=== Background ===
In the years since the end of World War II, eroticism had been gradually making its way into Japanese cinema. The first kiss to be seen in Japanese film—discreetly half-hidden by an umbrella—caused a national sensation in 1946. Although throughout the 1940s and early 1950s nudity in Japanese movie theaters, as in most of the world, was a taboo, some films from the mid-50s such as Shintoho&#x27;s female pearl-diver films starring buxom Michiko Maeda, began showing more flesh than would have previously been imaginable in the Japanese cinema. During the same period, the &quot;taiyozoku&quot; films on the teen-age &quot;Sun Tribe&quot;, such as Kō Nakahira&#x27;s &quot;Crazed Fruit&quot; (1956), introduced unprecedented sexual frankness into Japanese films.

Foreign films of this time, such as Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Summer with Monika&quot; (1953), Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Amants&quot; (1958), and Russ Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Immoral Mr. Teas&quot; (1959) introduced female nudity into international cinema, and were imported to Japan without problem. Nevertheless, until the early 1960s, graphic depictions of nudity and sex in Japanese film could only be seen in single-reel &quot;stag films,&quot; made by film producers such as those depicted in Imamura&#x27;s film &quot;The Pornographers&quot; (1966).

===First wave (The &quot;Age of Competition&quot; 1962–1971)===
The first wave of the pink film in Japan was contemporary with the similar U.S. sexploitation film genres, the &quot;nudie-cuties&quot; and &quot;roughies&quot;. Nudity and sex officially entered Japanese cinema with Satoru Kobayashi&#x27;s controversial and popular independent production &quot;Flesh Market&quot; (&quot;Nikutai no Ichiba&quot;, 1962), which is considered the first true pink film. Made for 8 million yen, Kobayashi&#x27;s independent feature film took in over 100 million yen. Kobayashi remained active in directing pink films until the 1990s. Tamaki Katori, the star of the film, went on to become one of the leading early pink film stars, appearing in over 600, and earning the title &quot;Pink Princess&quot;.

In 1964, maverick kabuki, theater and film director Tetsuji Takechi directed &quot;Daydream&quot;, a big-budget film distributed by the major studio Shochiku. Takechi&#x27;s &quot;Black Snow&quot; (1965), resulted in the director&#x27;s arrest on charges of obscenity and a high-profile trial, which became a major battle between Japan&#x27;s intellectuals and the establishment. Takechi won the lawsuit, and the publicity surrounding the trial helped bring about a boom in the production of pink films.

In her introduction to the Weisser&#x27;s &quot;Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films&quot;, actress Naomi Tani calls this period in pink film production &quot;The Age of Competition&quot;. Though Japan&#x27;s major studios, such as Nikkatsu and Shochiku made occasional forays into erotica in the 1960s, such as director Seijun Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;Gate of Flesh&quot; (1964)—the first Japanese film from one of the big four major studios to contain nudity, the majority of erotic films were made by the independents. Independent studios such as Nihon Cinema and World Eiga made dozens of cheap, profitable &quot;eroductions&quot;. Among the most influential independent studios producing pink films in this era were Shintōhō Eiga (the second studio to use this name), Million Film, Kantō, and Ōkura. Typically shown on a three-film program, these films were made by these companies to show at their own chain of specialty theaters.

Another major pink film studio, Wakamatsu Studios, was formed by director Kōji Wakamatsu in 1965, after quitting Nikkatsu. Known as &quot;The Pink Godfather&quot;, and called &quot;the most important director to emerge in the pink film genre&quot;, Wakamatsu&#x27;s independent productions are critically respected works usually concerned with sex and extreme violence mixed with political messages. His most controversial early films dealing with misogyny and sadism are &quot;The Embryo Hunts In Secret&quot; (1966), &quot;Violated Angels&quot; (1967), and &quot;Go, Go Second Time Virgin&quot; (1969).

Three other important pink film directors of this time, Kan Mukai, Kin&#x27;ya Ogawa and Shin&#x27;ya Yamamoto are known as &quot;The Heroes of the First Wave&quot;. In 1965, the same year as Wakamatsu became independent, directors Kan Mukai and Giichi Nishihara established their own production companies—Mukai Productions and Aoi Eiga.

The &quot;first queen of Japanese sex movies&quot; was Noriko Tatsumi, who made films at World Eiga and Nihon Cinema with director Kōji Seki. Other major Sex Queens of the first wave of pink film included Setsuko Ogawa, Mari Iwai, Keiko Kayama, and Miki Hayashi. Other pink film stars of the era include Tamaki Katori, who appeared in many films for Giichi Nishihara and Kōji Wakamatsu; Kemi Ichiboshi, whose specialty was playing the role of a violated innocent; and Mari Nagisa. Younger starlets like Naomi Tani, and Kazuko Shirakawa were starting their careers and already making names for themselves in the pink film industry, but are best remembered today for their work with Nikkatsu during the 1970s.

===Toei Porno===

Most exploitation films produced in the 1960&#x27;s were made by low-budget independent companies. The major studio Toei released a few films with female nudity, starting with &quot;Kunoichi ninpō&quot; in 1964 by director Sadao Nakajima. In films like his ero-guro series and &quot;Joys of Torture&quot; series of the late 1960s director Teruo Ishii provided a model for Toei&#x27;s sexploitation ventures by &quot;establishing a queasy mix of comedy and torture.&quot;

In 1972, Richie reported, &quot;In Japan, the eroduction is the only type of picture that retains an assured patronage.&quot; To tap into this market, Toei began advertising some of its films using the English word &#x27;porno,&#x27; a new word at the time. &quot;Onsen mimizu geisha&quot; directed by Norifumi Suzuki and starring Reiko Ike was the first such in July 1971.

Producer Kanji Amao designed a group of series—&quot;shigeki rosen&quot; (Sensational Line), &quot;ijoseiai rosen&quot; (Abnormal Line), and &quot;harenchi rosen&quot; (Shameless Line), today referred to by English critics as Toei&#x27;s &quot;Pinky Violence&quot;. Most of Toei&#x27;s films in this style used eroticism in conjunction with violent and action-filled stories. Several of these films have the theme of strong women exacting violent revenge for past injustices. The series was launched with the &quot;Delinquent Girl Boss&quot; (&quot;Zubeko Bancho&quot;) films starring Reiko Oshida. Other series in the &quot;Pinky Violence&quot; genre included Norifumi Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;Girl Boss&quot; (&quot;Sukeban&quot;) films, and the &quot;Terrifying Girls&#x27; High School&quot; films, both starring Reiko Ike and Miki Sugimoto.

Other examples of Toei&#x27;s films in this genre include Shunya Ito&#x27;s &quot;Sasori&quot; (Scorpion) series of women in prison films based on Toru Shinohara&#x27;s manga. Starting with &quot;Female Prisoner#701: Scorpion&quot; (1972), the &quot;Scorpion&quot; series starred Meiko Kaji, who had left Nikkatsu Studios to distance herself from their &quot;Roman Porno&quot; series. Toei also set the standard for Japanese nunsploitation films (a subgenre imported from Italy) with the critically acclaimed &quot;School of the Holy Beast&quot; (1974) directed by Norifumi Suzuki. Toei also produced a whole series of erotic samurai pictures such as &quot;Bohachi Bushido: Clan of the Forgotten Eight&quot; (Bōhachi Bushidō: Poruno Jidaigeki) (1973).

===Nikkatsu &quot;Roman Porno&quot;===
In 1971, Takashi Itamochi, president of Nikkatsu, Japan&#x27;s oldest major film studio, decided to stop his own company&#x27;s involvement with action films and start making sexploitation films. Like Toei, Nikkatsu had made some previous films in the sexploitation market, such as &quot;Story of Heresy in Meiji Era&quot; (1968) and &quot;Tokyo Bathhouse&quot; (1968), which featured over 30 sex-film stars in cameo appearances. Nikkatsu launched its &quot;Roman Porno&quot; series in November 1971 with &quot;Apartment Wife: Affair In the Afternoon&quot;, starring Kazuko Shirakawa. The film became a huge hit, inspired 20 sequels within seven years, established Shirakawa as Nikkatsu&#x27;s first &quot;Queen&quot;, and successfully launched the high-profile &quot;Roman Porno&quot; series. Director Masaru Konuma says that the process of making &quot;Roman Porno&quot; was the same as that of making a pink film except for the higher budget. Nikkatsu made these higher-quality sexploitation films almost exclusively, at an average rate of three per month, for the next 17 years.

Nikkatsu gave its &quot;Roman Porno&quot; directors a great deal of artistic freedom in creating their films, as long as they met the official minimum quota of four nude or sex scenes per hour. The result was a series that was popular both with audiences and with critics. One or two &quot;Roman Pornos&quot; appeared on the top-ten lists of Japanese critics every year throughout the run of the series. Nikkatsu&#x27;s higher-quality sex films essentially took the pink film market away from the smaller, independent studios until the mid-1980s, when adult videos began to lure away much of the pink film&#x27;s clientele.

Tatsumi Kumashiro was one of the major directors of the &quot;Roman Porno&quot;. Kumashiro directed a string of financial and critical hits unprecedented in Japanese cinematic history, including &quot;Ichijo&#x27;s Wet Desire&quot; (1972) and &quot;Woman with Red Hair&quot; (1979), starring Junko Miyashita. He became known as the &quot;King of Nikkatsu &quot;Roman porno&quot;&quot; Noboru Tanaka, director of &quot;A Woman Called Sada Abe&quot; (1975), is judged by many critics today to have been the best of Nikkatsu&#x27;s &quot;Roman Porno&quot; directors. The S&amp;M subgenre of the &quot;Roman Porno&quot; was established in 1974 when the studio hired Naomi Tani to star in &quot;Flower and Snake&quot; (based on an Oniroku Dan novel), and &quot;Wife to be Sacrificed&quot;, both directed by Masaru Konuma. Tani&#x27;s immense popularity established her as Nikkatsu&#x27;s third &quot;Roman Porno&quot; Queen, and the first of their S&amp;M Queens.
Tani was also directed by the important director Shôgorô Nishimura in titles that became classics, such as &quot;Rope Cosmetology&quot; (1978).
Other subgenres developed under the &quot;Roman Porno&quot; line included &quot;Violent Pink&quot;, established in 1976 by director Yasuharu Hasebe.

===1980s===
When ownership of VCRs first became widespread in the early 1980s, adult videos made their appearance, and quickly became highly popular. As early as 1982, the AVs had already attained an approximately equal share of the adult entertainment market with theatrical erotic films. In 1984, new government censorship policies and an agreement between Eirin (the Japanese film-rating board) and the pink-film companies added to Nikkatsu&#x27;s difficulties by putting drastic new restrictions on theatrical films. Theatrical pink movie profits dropped 36% within a month of the new ruling. Eirin dealt a serious blow to the pink film industry in 1988 by introducing stricter requirements for sex-related theatrical films. Nikkatsu responded by discontinuing their Roman Porno line. &quot;Bed Partner&quot; (1988) was the final film of the venerable 17-year-old &quot;Roman Porno&quot; series. Nikkatsu continued to distribute films under the name Ropponica, and pink films through Excess Films, however these were not nearly as popular or critically respected as the Roman Porno series had been in its heyday. By the end of the 1980s, adult videos had become the main form of adult cinematic entertainment in Japan.

The dominant directors of pink films of the 1980s, Genji Nakamura, Banmei Takahashi and Mamoru Watanabe are known collectively as &quot;The Three Pillars Of Pink&quot;. All three were veterans of the pink film industry since the 1960s. Coming to prominence in the 1980s, a time when the theatrical porn film was facing considerable difficulties on several fronts, this group is known for elevating the pink film above its low origins by concentrating on technical finesse and narrative content. Some critics dubbed the style of their films &quot;&quot;pink&quot; art&quot;.

By the time Nakamura joined Nikkatsu in 1983, he had already directed over 100 films. While the plots of his films, which could be extremely misogynistic, were not highly respected, his visual style earned him a reputation for &quot;erotic sensitivity.&quot; Nakamura directed one of Japan&#x27;s first widely distributed, well-received films with a homosexual theme, &quot;Beautiful Mystery: Legend of the Big Penis&quot; (1983), for Nikkatsu&#x27;s ENK Productions, which was founded in 1983 to focus on gay-themed pink films. Some of Nakamura&#x27;s later pink films were directed in collaboration with Ryūichi Hiroki, and Hitoshi Ishikawa under the group pseudonym Go Ijuin.

Banmei Takahashi directed &quot;intricate, highly stylistic &quot;pinku eiga&quot;&quot;, including &quot;New World of Love&quot; (1994), the first Japanese theatrical film to display genitals. Another prominent cult director of this era, Kazuo &quot;Gaira&quot; Komizu, is known for his Herschell Gordon Lewis-influenced &quot;splatter-eros&quot; films, which bridge the genres of horror and erotica.

===1990s===
Nikkatsu, Japan&#x27;s largest producer of pink films during the 1970s and 1980s, filed for bankruptcy protection in 1993. Nevertheless, even in this most difficult period for the pink film, the genre never completely died out, and continued exploring new artistic realms. Indeed, at this time the pink film was viewed as one of the last refuges of the &quot;auteur&quot; in Japan. So long as the director provided the requisite number of sex scenes, he was free to explore his own thematic and artistic interests.

Three of the most prominent pink film directors of the 1990s, Kazuhiro Sano, Toshiki Satō and Takahisa Zeze all made their directorial debuts in 1989. A fourth, Hisayasu Satō, debuted in 1985. Coming to prominence during one of the most precarious times for the pink film, these directors worked under the assumption that each film could be their last, and so largely ignored their audience to concentrate on intensely personal, experimental themes. These directors even broke one of the fundamental &quot;pink&quot; rules by cutting down in the sex scenes in pursuit of their own artistic concerns. Their films were considered &quot;difficult&quot;—dark, complex, and largely unpopular with the older &quot;pink&quot; audience. The title
 was applied to these directors, at first sarcastically, by disgruntled theater owners. On the other hand, Roland Domenig, in his essay on the pink film, says that their work offers &quot;a refreshing contrast to the formulaic and stereotyped films that make up the larger part of &quot;pink eiga&quot; production, and are strongly influenced by the notion of the filmmaker as auteur.&quot;

===21st century===
The newest prominent group of seven pink film directors all began as assistant directors to the &quot;shitennō&quot;. Their films display individualistic styles and introspective character indicative of the insecurity of Japan&#x27;s post-bubble generation. Known together as the they are Toshiya Ueno, Shinji Imaoka, Yoshitaka Kamata, Toshiro Enomoto, Yūji Tajiri, Mitsuru Meike and Rei Sakamoto. Ueno was the first director of this group to rise to prominence, acting as an &quot;advance guard&quot; for the group when his &quot;Keep on Masturbating: Non-Stop Pleasure&quot; (1994) won the &quot;Best Film&quot; award at the Pink Grand Prix. Founded in 1989, the Pink Grand Prix has become a yearly highlight for the pink film community by awarding excellence in the genre and screening the top films.

The 2000s have seen a significant growth in international interest in the pink film. Director Mitsuru Meike&#x27;s &quot;The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai&quot; (2003) made an impression in international film festivals and gained critical praise. A planned annual &quot;women-only&quot; pink film festival was first held in South Korea in 2007, and again in November 2008. In 2008, a company called Pink Eiga, Inc. was formed with the sole purpose of releasing pink films on DVD in the U.S.

<text>Fondmetal S.p.A. is an Italian manufacturer of alloy wheels, founded in 1972 by Gabriele Rumi.

A Formula One constructor of the same name, also owned by Rumi, competed in the and seasons, scoring no championship points. The company also sponsored, and supplied wheels to, numerous other constructors from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s.

In 2014 the Fondmetal brand expanded to the United States and became known as Fondmetal USA. All wheels continue to be made in Italy and are TUV approved.

==Early years==
In 1961, Gabriele Rumi took over the iron foundry business that had been established by his grandfather in Brescia. A motor racing enthusiast, the business allowed him to compete in hillclimbs and in the Formula Monza category during the 1960s.

Rumi had a passion for cars and racing and saw a demand for the manufacturing of parts for the automobile industry. In Palosco they made induction manifolds, water conduits, clutch bellhousing, oil pumps, cylinder heads and engine blocks for clients such as Maserati Biturbo, Fiat, Iveco, OM and Magneti Marelli.

For Rumi this was not enough. He found himself too reliant on his customers in a sensitive time period following the oil crisis. This led him to the courageous decision of launching his own product line in 1972.

The choice of product was alloy wheels, due to his involvement and passion for the automobile industry. From there the Fondmetal brand grew, and was established as a leader in forged and cost wheel design, engineering and manufacturing in Italy.

Fondmetal first appeared in Formula One in 1983 as a sponsor for Italian driver Piercarlo Ghinzani. In the mid-1980s, the company supplied wheels to Williams, Tyrrell and Ligier, while continuing to sponsor Ghinzani and, later, the Osella team. In 1989, Fondmetal became Osella&#x27;s major sponsor, and by 1990 Rumi had become the team&#x27;s majority shareholder. At the end of that year, he decided to take over the whole operation.

==Team Fondmetal==
Rumi transferred the team from Volpiano near Turin to his headquarters in Bergamo and ran it for one and a half years on his own. He initially persevered with Osella&#x27;s driver, Olivier Grouillard, until he tired of the Frenchman&#x27;s reckless side and attitude problem, replacing him with Gabriele Tarquini. The new team was no more successful than in the Osella days, sometimes the results being even worse than those of its fellow back row contenders Coloni or AGS.

===1991===

For the 1991 Formula One season, Osella Squadra Corse was gone; the team re-appeared as Fondmetal Corse. Initially, Fondmetal entered the FA1M-E car which was a mere carry-over from the previous year (and, in fact, from 1989 as Osella had not been able to construct a new car in 1990). Driven by Olivier Grouillard, the blue and grey coloured machine was uncompetitive by any means. Although Fondmetal was able to use Cosworth engines prepared by Brian Hart for the previous years&#x27; Tyrrell, even Pedro Chaves in his Coloni was ahead of the Fondmetal car. In that hostile atmosphere, pre-qualification turned out to be impossible. But Rumi had high hopes for the European season. By the San Marino Grand Prix, a new car appeared, called the Fomet-1. It was conceived by a newly founded think-tank in the UK called Fomet. The Bicester-based design office was headed by Tino Belli and founded by Rumi who thought that British input was necessary for gaining success. The Fomet-1 featured new aerodynamics, a new suspension and some other improvements, but apart from this, the new car obviously preserved its Osella roots. Finally, things improved a little, but not significantly. With the new car, Grouillard managed to be faster than the Coloni machine, but that does not mean that Fondmetal was able to pass pre-qualifying regularly. Only a handful of race participations were possible, but results were poor, although Grouillard did qualify 10th for the 1991 Mexican Grand Prix, ahead of Andrea de Cesaris in the Jordan, who eventually finished 4th. In the end, Grouillard was replaced by former AGS man Gabriele Tarquini who finished twice (from three attempts), although he also failed to pre-qualify once; but no points were scored in the end.

===1992===

At the end of 1991, the British subsidiary Fomet was sold. Its designers had been working on a new Formula One car since the previous summer. Tino Belli sold the designs of the new car to the Larrousse Formula One team which left Fondmetal without a new car for the next season. In late December 1991 Gabriele Rumi commissioned Sergio Rinland from Astauto to design a new car. It was not ready for the start of the season, so the team used the previous year&#x27;s car for the first few races. The car received a Ford HB V8 engine (from the previous year&#x27;s Benetton) to replace the Lamborghini V12 or the Judd V10 that Rumi had preferred. The engine and the chassis did not go together well. There were some cooling troubles, and reliability was poor. The team appeared with two drivers, Tarquini, the other one being the Swiss debutant Andrea Chiesa. Tarquini showed speed, but the car broke down frequently.

In late spring Rinland&#x27;s new chassis was ready to race. The GR02 had nothing in common with former years&#x27; Osellas and Fondmetals. The roots of its design dated back to late 1991 when he was working for the Brabham team on the Brabham BT61 that never saw the light of day. Elements of its design were carried over to the 1992 Fondmetal. Its drivers found it an improvement over the GRß1, but it had disappointing race results, with minor problems often stopping the cars after they qualified well. The team was poorly funded so tests were few and development was slow. Finishes were rare. Tarquini often qualified his car relatively high in the order, and at the Belgian Grand Prix put in Fondmetal&#x27;s best qualifying performance of the season to qualify 11th. Chiesa often failed to qualify, and was replaced by Eric van de Poele for the Hungarian Grand Prix. 

While van de Poele proved competitive, he spun off on the third lap in Hungary, losing the Italian team&#x27;s last good chance of a points finish. Tarquini had already collided with Herbert&#x27;s Lotus and with the Ligiers of Boutsen and Comas in the first lap. 

Only two races later after the Italian Grand Prix in September 1992, the team withdrew from the championship for financial reasons, having scored a pair of 10th places, although Tarquini managed to qualify for all thirteen races in which the team participated in 1992 and Chiesa (in ten attempts) and van de Poele (in only three) qualified three times each.

The team&#x27;s mounting debt coincided with a global recession. Rumi contemplated racing Giuseppe Bugatti as a pay-driver in order to get through the 1992 Portuguese Grand Prix, but decided instead to close his team.

==Later relations with other teams==

===Forti Corse===
During 1992 Sergio Rinland and his Astauto team started to work on a 1993 F1 car in the hope that Fondmetal would carry on. That was not the case, since the contract was cancelled by Fondmetal in September 1992, well before the end of the season due to lack of funds. The design of that car was finished in early 1993. A year later, Rinland sold that design to Guido Forti who started running a Formula One team called Forti by 1995. The team&#x27;s FG01 chassis still had several similarities to the, by then three year-old, 1992 Fondmetal GR02.

===Tyrrell and Minardi===

Rumi would return to Formula One in a more modest capacity in 1994, with Fondmetal as a technical partner and sponsor of Tyrrell, and for 1996 Minardi. Fondmetal&#x27;s wind tunnel in Northern Italy was leased to Tyrrell, Minardi and other teams. Rumi would gradually increase his interest in the Faenza outfit, becoming co-owner and chairman, even going as far as rebadging the Ford Zetec-R engines in 2000. However, Rumi was diagnosed with cancer, and was forced to withdraw his backing later that year when the team was sold to Paul Stoddart. Rumi eventually died in May 2001. Fondmetal is still in operation as a wheel manufacturer.

<doc id="1226710" wikidata="Q173446" url="?curid=1226710" title="Motori Moderni">
<text>Motori Moderni (Modern Engines) was a Formula One engine manufacturer from 1985 through 1987. It was established in Novara by Italian engine designer Carlo Chiti.

Chiti, a former Ferrari, Automobili Turismo e Sport and Alfa Romeo Formula One chief designer, founded Motori Moderni with the idea of supplying custom turbocharged V6 engines, also known as &quot;Tipo 615-90&quot;, to Formula One teams. The engines were used by Minardi in Formula One from to and by AGS in .

==V6 Turbo==

===1985===
Motori Moderni&#x27;s power unit debuted at the 1985 San Marino Grand Prix with the newly born Minardi Formula One team. Rookie Pierluigi Martini qualified the M185 19th on the grid but was forced to retire after 14 laps. Martini failed to score a point in 1985 with a best finish of 8th and last in the season-ending Australian Grand Prix. The Motori Moderni engine produced . This compared unfavourably to the approximately of the Renault, Honda and BMW turbo engines, and the of the TAG-Porsche and Ferrari engines. At Silverstone for the British Grand Prix, Martini was 8.054 seconds slower than Keke Rosberg&#x27;s pole-winning Williams-Honda (Rosberg had set the pole at an average of 160.9 mph (258.9 km/h), the fastest ever turbo lap speed). At the Österreichring in Austria he was 11.2 seconds slower than Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren TAG-Porsche, while at Monza in Italy he was 8.8 seconds slower than Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus-Renault.

===1986===
In 1986, as the Minardi team expanded to running two cars, Martini was replaced with Andrea de Cesaris, and paired with F1 rookie Alessandro Nannini, who showed his class by often outpacing his more experienced countryman. Again, no points were scored with the Motori Moderni engines rated at approximately next to the leading Honda, BMW, Ferrari, Renault and TAG-Porsche units which were producing well over in race trim (the BMW was said to be the most powerful qualifying engine at around ).

The AGS team was Motori Moderni&#x27;s second customer. The team only participated in two races during the 1986 season, with Ivan Capelli retiring from both the Italian and Portuguese Grands Prix.

===1987===
1987 would be the last season the Motori Moderni engine would be used in Formula One. Minardi, who had retained Nannini after an impressive debut season, replaced de Cesaris (who had moved to Brabham) with Spanish driver Adrián Campos. Once more no points were scored throughout the season, despite some spirited drives by Nannini which only resulted in 11th-placed finishes in Hungary and Portugal. The engines, now rated at after the introduction of the FIA&#x27;s mandatory pop-off valve aimed at limiting the turbos power to 4.0 bar, were often struggling against the V8 Cosworth DFZ powered cars.

At the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, Nannini qualified an impressive 13th on the grid only 3.434 behind Gerhard Berger&#x27;s pole-winning Ferrari. Unfortunately, his race only lasted a few hundred metres as he was pushed into the fence just out of the chicane after the start. Campos qualified 26th and last (3.42 seconds slower than Nannini), with his race ending with transmission failure after 46 of the scheduled 82 laps.

With being the final year for the turbos in Formula One (until ), Motori Moderni pulled out of the sport at the end of 1987 rather than try to adapt the engine for an even lower pop-off valve limit of 2.5 bar and a lower fuel limit of just 150 litres. As a result, Minardi switched to the Cosworth DFZ engine in 1988.

==Subaru==
In late 1988 Chiti was commissioned by Subaru to design a new 12-cylinder boxer engine, known as the &quot;1235&quot; for the new 3.5-litre normally aspirated F1 regulations. This was tested by Minardi. The Japanese car company then bought the Coloni team but withdrew and sold the team back to Enzo Coloni at the end of the season. The engine was later adopted in the 1989 Jiotto Caspita prototype sports car before it was used by Subaru for the 1990 season.

==Sportscar racing==
After abandoning Formula One, the flat-12 engines were deployed in the Alba Racing Team&#x27;s AR20 entry in the 1990 World Sportscar Championship, but failed to start any rounds before being replaced by a more conventional 4.5-litre engine from Buick.

<text>Gordini () is a division of Renault Sport Technologies (Renault Sport). In the past, it was a sports car manufacturer and performance tuner, established in 1946 by Amédée Gordini (1899–1979), nicknamed &quot;Le Sorcier&quot; (The Sorcerer). Gordini became a division of Renault in 1968 and of Renault Sport in 1976.

==History==



Amédée Gordini tuned cars and competed in motor races since the 1930s. His results prompted Simca (the French assembler of Fiat) to hire him for its motorsport program and to develop road cars. Their association continued after World War II.

In 1946, Gordini introduced the first cars bearing his name, Fiat-engined single-seaters raced by him and José Scaron, achieving several victories. In the late 1940s, the company opened a workshop at the Boulevard Victor in Paris, entering sports car and Grand Prix races. Gordini and Simca started to diverge in 1951 because of political conflicts.

Gordini competed in Formula One from 1950 to 1956 (with a brief return in 1957 with an eight cylinder engine), although it achieved a major success in Formula Two during that period.

After its Formula One program ended, Gordini worked with Renault as an engine tuner, entering Renault-Gordini cars at the 24 Hours of Le Mans between 1962 and 1969. It also tuned engines for Alpine, a rival sports car manufacturer also associated with Renault. In 1957, Gordini and Renault manufactured the Dauphine Gordini, a modified version of the Renault Dauphine which was a sales success. Gordini-tuned Renault cars also won various rallies during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1963, the Gordini company planned to move its headquarters to Noisy-le-Roi. At the end of 1968, Amédée Gordini retired and sold a 70% majority stake from his firm to Renault. Renault-Gordini was moved to Viry-Châtillon in 1969 and became a sport division of Renault, before being merged with Alpine to form Renault Sport in 1976. On 1 January 1976, René Vuaillat became director of Gordini. The Gordini company name became wholly owned by Renault in 1977.

Renault sold Gordini-badged performance versions of models including the Renault 5, the Renault 8 the Renault 12 and the Renault 17.

In November 2009, Renault announced that it would be reviving the Gordini name for an exclusive line of hot hatches, in a similar fashion to Fiat&#x27;s revival of its Abarth name. Modern models to bear the name include the Renault Twingo and the Renault Clio.

==Models==

<doc id="1226719" wikidata="Q5141397" url="?curid=1226719" title="Cohomology operation">
<text>In mathematics, the cohomology operation concept became central to algebraic topology, particularly homotopy theory, from the 1950s onwards, in the shape of the simple definition that if &quot;F&quot; is a functor defining a cohomology theory, then a cohomology operation should be a natural transformation from &quot;F&quot; to itself. Throughout there have been two basic points:

#the operations can be studied by combinatorial means; and
#the effect of the operations is to yield an interesting bicommutant theory.

The origin of these studies was the work of Pontryagin, Postnikov, and Norman Steenrod, who first defined the Pontryagin square, Postnikov square, and Steenrod square operations for singular cohomology, in the case of mod 2 coefficients. The combinatorial aspect there arises as a formulation of the failure of a natural diagonal map, at cochain level. The general theory of the Steenrod algebra of operations has been brought into close relation with that of the symmetric group.

In the Adams spectral sequence the &quot;bicommutant&quot; aspect is implicit in the use of Ext functors, the derived functors of Hom-functors; if there is a bicommutant aspect, taken over the Steenrod algebra acting, it is only at a &quot;derived&quot; level. The convergence is to groups in stable homotopy theory, about which information is hard to come by. This connection established the deep interest of the cohomology operations for homotopy theory, and has been a research topic ever since. An extraordinary cohomology theory has its own cohomology operations, and these may exhibit a richer set on constraints.

==Formal definition==
A cohomology operation formula_1 of type 

:formula_2

is a natural transformation of functors

:formula_3

defined on CW complexes.

==Relation to Eilenberg–MacLane spaces==
Cohomology of CW complexes is representable by an Eilenberg–MacLane space, so by the Yoneda lemma a cohomology operation of type formula_4 is given by a homotopy class of maps formula_5. Using representability once again, the cohomology operation is given by an element of formula_6.

Symbolically, letting formula_7 denote the set of homotopy classes of maps from formula_8 to formula_9,

::formula_10

<doc id="1226722" wikidata="Q173425" url="?curid=1226722" title="Repco">
<text>Repco is an Australian automotive engineering/retailer company. Its name is an abbreviation of Replacement Parts Company and was for many years known for reconditioning engines and for specialised manufacturing, for which it gained a high reputation. It is now best known as a retailer of spare parts and motor accessories.

The company gained fame for developing the engines that powered the Brabham Formula One cars in which Jack Brabham and Denny Hulme won the 1966 and 1967 World Championship of Drivers titles. Brabham-Repco was awarded the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers in the same two years.

Repco currently runs a series of stores across Australia and New Zealand specialising in the sale of parts and aftermarket accessories.

==History==
Repco was founded by Geoff Russell in 1922 and first traded under the name Automotive Grinding Company, from premises in Collingwood, Victoria.

Repco was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in 1937. It was acquired by Pacific Dunlop in 1988 and delisted. 

In September 2001 Repco was purchased by a private equity consortium, before again becoming a listed company, this time as a dual listed company on the ASX and New Zealand Exchange. Following acquisition of all shares by CCMP Capital in December 2006, Repco was again delisted. On 1 July 2013, Repco and the entire Exego group (consisting of Ashdown-Ingram, Mcleod Accessories and Motospecs) were acquired by Genuine Parts Company.

==Sponsorships==
Since 2021, the company has held the naming rights to the Bathurst 1000 and Supercars Championship. It previously sponsored Garry Rogers Motorsport and Dick Johnson Racing and the 1979 Round Australia Trial. In 2024, Repco became the title sponsor of the D1NZ National Drifting Championship, a sanctioned championship under Motorsport New Zealand, the official FIA appointed governing body of motor-racing in New Zealand.

==Repco V8 engine==
In 1964 the Australian/New Zealand Tasman Series was created with a 2,500 cc capacity limit applied to engines. Jack Brabham approached Repco to develop a suitable engine, and together they decided to base the SOHC design on Oldsmobile Jetfire 215 ci block with six cylinder-head studs per cylinder. Combined with a short stroke flat-plane crankshaft, Repco designed cylinder heads, camshafts and two-stage chain/gear cam drive, a 2.5 L engine was built in 1965 with its cylinder head cast by Commonwealth Aircraft.

In 1963 the international motor racing body, the FIA, announced that the maximum engine capacity for the Formula One category would be doubled to three litres to start from the 1966 season. Despite calls for a &quot;return to power&quot; having been made, few teams were prepared as the main engine supplier in the UK, Coventry Climax, decided to get out of race engine building.

Jack Brabham used his friendship with engineer Phil Irving at Repco. He proposed they design and build a 3 L version of the 2.5 L engine by using a longer stroke flat-plane crankshaft.

The Repco board agreed to his proposal in light of the expected rival 2.75 L Coventry Climax FPF DOHC engine being of four-cylinder configuration deemed to be near-obsolete, and the plan to build the Cosworth DFV (revealed at the end of 1965 by Ford, its sponsor) was not known yet. A small team at Repco under Phil Irving developed the F1 engine, fitted with two valves per cylinder SOHC heads from the 2.5L version.

The first advantage of this Repco 620 V8 was its compact size and lightness, which allowed it to be bolted into an existing 1.5-litre Formula One chassis. With no more than , the Repco was by far the least powerful of the new 3-litre engines, but unlike the others it was frugal, light and compact. Also unlike the others, it was reliable and due to low weight and power, the strain on chassis, suspension, brakes and tyres was low.

This engine being based on British/American Rover V8/Buick 215 block is a common misconception. The Oldsmobile version of this engine, although sharing the same basic architecture, had cylinder heads and angled valve covers designed by Oldsmobile engineers to look like a traditional Olds V8 and was produced on a separate assembly line. Oldsmobile&#x27;s intention to produce a higher-powered, turbo-charged Jetfire version led to significant differences from the Buick 215, primarily in cylinder head design: Buick used a 5-bolt pattern around each cylinder where Oldsmobile used a 6-bolt pattern. The sixth bolt was added to the intake manifold side of the head, one extra bolt for each cylinder, meant to alleviate a head-warping problem on high-compression versions. This meant that Buick heads would fit on Oldsmobile blocks, but not vice versa. Changing the compression ratio on an Oldsmobile 215 required changing the heads, but on a Buick 215, only the pistons, which was less expensive and simpler. General Motors later use of parts diagrams drawn for Oldsmobile in Buick parts catalogue showing a six-stud cylinder block sowed further confusion. Later Rover versions of the aluminum block and subsequent Buick iron small blocks went to a 4-bolt-per-cylinder pattern.

== Four world titles for the single-camshaft 16-valve ==
In 1966, the Repco engine was good enough to score three poles for Jack Brabham. In his one-off BT19, it helped him get four consecutive wins and both titles in the nine-race-long season, a unique accomplishment for a driver and constructor. This was his third title.

The 2,995.58 cc V8 Repco had a bore and stroke of 3.50 × 2.375&quot; (88.9 × 60.3 mm). Initially it gave about . A test-bed figure of at 7,800 rpm with torque at 6,500 rpm was obtained. In race trim, about was available. In 1967, the bore and stroke remained unaltered. In that year, bhp at 8,500 rpm was often quoted. A test-bed figure of at 8,300 rpm was recorded. For 1968, a 32-valve version with at 9,500 rpm was planned. Only about at 9,000 rpm was achieved.

In 1967 the competition had made progress. Repco produced a new version of the engine, the 700 series, this time with a Repco designed block. Brabham scored two poles early in the year, but then the new Ford Cosworth DFV V8 appeared in the Lotus 49, setting a new pace with its at 9,000 rpm, with Jim Clark and Graham Hill taking all poles in the rest of the season. As the Lotus was still fragile, the Brabham drivers scored two wins each. Brabham used new parts on his cars, which was not always helpful, so Denis Hulme collected more results and the title, followed by Brabham himself, who again won the constructors&#x27; title.

== The double-camshaft 32-valve ==
The new Ford engine, which was made available to other teams in 1968 also, convinced Brabham that more power was needed. With hindsight Brabham commented that the single cam motor&#x27;s reliability may have been enough to supplant the more powerful Cosworths as late as the 1968 season. A new version of the Repco V8, with gear-driven double-overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder, was produced for 1968 to maintain its competitiveness. A figure of at 9,500 rpm was targeted but only about at 9,000 rpm was achieved. The season was a disaster as it proved very unreliable due to insurmountable valve gear unreliability. There was also a 4.2-litre derivative for the Indianapolis 500. Jochen Rindt, who had moved to Brabham at the wrong time, managed to score two poles and two podiums that year, while Brabham himself collected only two points. The Repco project had always been hindered by the lengthy lines of communication between the UK and Australia, which made correcting problems very difficult. Repco, having spent far more money than originally envisaged and having sold very few customer versions of its engine, stopped the project.

For 1969, the works Brabham team and most of the private Brabham entries also used the ubiquitous Cosworth powerplant. A pair of older Brabham-Repcos were entered in the season opening 1969 South African Grand Prix by local drivers Sam Tingle and Peter de Klerk, but no points were scored on the engine marque&#x27;s last appearance in the world championship.

Also, LDS fitted with Repcos were used in the South African Grand Prix in the late 1960s, as well as in the national F1 series there.

== Other racing ==

Repco had been involved in Australian motor racing many years prior to the association with Brabham. Most famous had been development of the engine of the series of Maybach Specials in the 1950s to various wins including the 1954 New Zealand Grand Prix.

The Brabham-Repco project was initially aimed at the Tasman Series, where Coventry-Climax&#x27;s obsolete FPF four-cylinder engine was dominant in the mid-1960s. The 2.5-litre version of the Repco V8 was never very successful in this series, initially producing no more power than the FPF. It did, however, record one Tasman Series round win with Jack Brabham driving his Repco powered Brabham BT23A to victory in the 1967 South Pacific Trophy at the Longford Circuit in Tasmania.

Brabham-Repco&#x27;s were also prepared and entered in the 1968 and 1969 Indianapolis 500. In 1969, Peter Revson finished fifth in such a car. He also won a USAC race in the same year.

Further versions of the V8 engine were produced, including a 4.3-litre variant for sports car racing and a turbo-charged version intended for United States Automobile Club races. Neither version met with any international success, the turbo in particular being labelled &#x27;Puff the Tragic Wagon&#x27; by its development team due to its lack of horsepower (compared with &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot;).

The sports car engine (increased in size to 5.0 litres) was, however, dominant domestically, powering cars to several wins in the Australian Sports Car Championship and its predecessor the Australian Tourist Trophy, most notably powering the Matich sports cars built and raced by Frank Matich, and Elfin Sports Cars built and raced by Garrie Cooper.
==Repco Brabham racing cars==

When Jack Brabham began building racing cars in England he named his cars Repco Brabhams, the result of a sponsorship deal between Brabham and Repco. This name was applied regardless of the engine used, and the arrangement existed through to the end of the 1960s. The agreement saw Repco&#x27;s international marketing of its automotive parts and service equipment supported by Brabham&#x27;s racing achievements.

==Repco-Holden Formula 5000 engine==
Repco also developed and built the Repco-Holden Formula 5000 engine for Formula 5000 racing. Repco used the block and head castings of the Holden 308 V8 engine as its basis, but it featured many modifications including Lucas fuel injection, dual-coil Bosch ignition and more than 150 special components designed by Repco. The engine first tasted success in the 1970 Australian Grand Prix that was won by Frank Matich driving a Repco-Holden powered McLaren M10B.

The engine was then used extensively in racing vehicles including cars competing in the Tasman Series, the Australian Drivers&#x27; Championship, the Australian Sports Car Championship and the Australian Sports Sedan Championship.

By 1976, power for the 5.0 L Repco-Holden V8 was rated at approximately . This compared to approximately for the other main engine in the Australian Formula 5000 and Sports Sedans categories, the 5.0 L Chevrolet V8.

Due to the success of the Repco-Holden V8, Holden enlisted Repco to carry out the development work (on the dynamometer only, according to Holden Dealer Team boss Harry Firth) on Holden&#x27;s 308 engine for its Torana SL/R 5000 that was released in 1974. Firth believed that developing the engine on the dyno and not on the race track saw continual problems for the engine such as oil surge—especially in touring car racing. He also claimed to have already cured the oil problems while developing the still-born Torana GTR XU-1 V8 in 1972 and that Holden ignored his warnings about the Repco engine.

<text>Supertec was a brand of Formula One engines supplied by Dutch company Super Performance Competition Engineering BV, managed by Flavio Briatore and Bruno Michel. Supertec engines were updated 1997 Renault RS9 units, built by Mecachrome.

In May 1998 Super Performance Competition Engineering signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Mecachrome to begin in the 1999 season. The engines were purchased and rebadged as Supertec. Supertecs powered Williams, Benetton and BAR in 1999, and Benetton and Arrows in 2000. The Benetton team rebadged the engines as Playlife.

After the 2000 season, Supertec collapsed due to financial problems and Renault Sport F1 bought back Supertec&#x27;s assets in 2001.

<doc id="1226727" wikidata="Q3022396" url="?curid=1226727" title="Japanese warship San Buena Ventura">
<text>San Buena Ventura was a 120-ton ship built in Japan under the direction of the English navigator and adventurer William Adams for the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu. The ship was built in 1607, and followed the construction of a smaller 80-ton ship, also by William Adams, which had been used for the charting of the waters around Japan. Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered the second, bigger, ship for travels to other countries.
On 30 September 1609, the Spanish galleon &quot;San Francisco&quot; with a crew of 373 was wrecked on the coast of Chiba, Japan (near the present-day town of Onjuku), and the 317 survivors were received warmly by the Japanese. One of the passengers was the governor of the Philippines, Rodrigo de Vivero y Aberrucia. He had the opportunity to meet the shogun Tokugawa Hidetada, and the following year his father Tokugawa Ieyasu, meetings in which the Franciscan friar Luis Sotelo, who had been in Japan for a few years, acted as an interpreter.

Ieyasu expressed his desire to expand trade with New Spain (Mexico) and Spain. Rodrigo de Vivero answered that he could readily organize trade on a scale surpassing that of the Dutch, the main rivals of Spain in Asia at the time. He also offered to send to Japan 50 experts in silver mining from Mexico. In exchange, he asked for the protection of Spanish priests in Japan, support for shipwrecked boats on the Japanese coasts, and the expulsion of Dutch merchants from Japan, the last request being rejected by Ieyasu.

In order for the Spanish to return to Mexico, Ieyasu lent them William Adams&#x27;s ship, also lent them the equivalent of 4,000 ducados for the trip. Rodrigo de Vivero made it back to Mexico on board the ship in 1610. Twenty-two Japanese were also on board, led by Tanaka Shōsuke, who became the first recorded Japanese to reach the continent. Luis de Velasco, the viceroy of Nueva España received the 22 Japanese and expressed his great satisfaction at the treatment the Spanish sailors had received in Japan. He confiscated the &quot;San Buena Ventura&quot; however, fearing that the Japanese would become expert at trans-oceanic navigation.

The viceroy of Nueva España decided to send an embassy to Japan in the person of the famous explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno. Vizcaino also had a mission to return the 4,000 ducados and to research &quot;gold and silver islands&quot;, supposedly to the east of Japan. He left for Japan on 22 March 1611, and after another shipwreck eventually returned in 1613 on board the Japanese-built galleon &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; with the first official Japanese embassy to the Americas and Europe, led by Hasekura Tsunenaga.

<text>Michael Callen (April 11, 1955 – December 27, 1993) was an American singer, songwriter, composer, author, and AIDS activist. Callen was diagnosed with AIDS in 1982 and became a pioneer of AIDS activism in New York City, working closely with his doctor, Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, and Richard Berkowitz. Together, they published articles and pamphlets to raise awareness about the correlation between risky sexual behaviors and AIDS.

As a major contributor to the foundation of AIDS activism, specifically activism from People With AIDS, Callen helped draft unprecedented documents such as &quot;How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach,&quot; and The Denver Principles. In addition to his written work, Callen was a leader and founder of activist organizations including The People with AIDS Coalition and the Community Research Initiative. As a musician, he was a member of the openly gay and politically active a cappella quintet The Flirtations and released two solo albums: &quot;Purple Heart&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Legacy&quot; in 1996. He consistently spoke out for AIDS activists and gay and lesbian organizations and made frequent speaking and performance appearances. Callen remained a primary public figure in AIDS activism until he died at age 38 from AIDS-related complications of pulmonary Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma at Midway Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. In &quot;Love Doesn&#x27;t Need a Reason&quot; the author, Jones, wrote that Michael Callen requested that Douglas Sadownick and Tim should be granted power of attorney over him.

==AIDS activist==
=== Activism with Sonnabend, Berkowitz, and Dworkin ===
In 1982, Callen joined with fellow person with AIDS Richard Berkowitz and partner Richard Dworkin to write an essay entitled &quot;We Know Who We Are: Two Gay Men Declare War on Promiscuity&quot; for the &quot;New York Native&quot;. Inspired by Dr. Joseph Sonnabend’s theory, the men suggested closing the baths as a way to stop the spread of AIDS. What the men referred to as &quot;promiscuity&quot; was the frequent backroom, unprotected sexual encounters that dominated the gay sexual culture of the time and place. In the post-Stonewall Riots and gay liberation years, the popular belief was that sex was a revolutionary act, and more sex was equivalent to being more liberated.

Callen co-authored the manual &quot;How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach&quot;, which was developed in collaboration with Berkowitz and Sonnabend in 1983. The authors outlined the tenets of safe sex, advocating for the increased use of condoms. Prior to the AIDS epidemic, condoms were advertised as a viable way to prevent pregnancy but not considered an effective tool for STD prevention.

In 1990, Callen wrote &quot;Surviving AIDS&quot;, which received an Honorable Mention from the American Medical Writers Association. In &quot;Surviving AIDS,&quot; Callen exposes what he calls the “propaganda of hopelessness”, arguing that public health officials and researchers are more interested in the dead than the living, ultimately largely ignoring long-term survivors. The latter half of the book tells the story of 13 long-term survivors, including people of different sexes, ethnic, and sexual backgrounds. 

=== Opposition ===
Despite his career and prominence as an activist, Callen was met with resentment, suspicion and opposition from others. Since he was diagnosed with AIDS in 1982 and survived over a decade, people speculated as to whether his diagnosis was real or fabricated to get attention. He responded to that criticism by releasing his medical reports and pictures of his lungs which showed his pulmonary Kaposi&#x27;s Sarcoma. Additionally, Callen stood by his belief in the multifactorial theory when there was scientific proof that HIV was the cause of AIDS.

Callen openly questioned the HIV theory of AIDS and was especially critical of AZT monotherapy when it was first introduced: &quot;The HIV paradigm has produced nothing of value for my life and I actually believe that treatments based on the arrogant belief that HIV has proven to be the sole and sufficient cause of AIDS has hastened the deaths of many of my friends.&quot;

===Honors===
In June 2019, Callen was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

Approximately five years after Callen&#x27;s death, the Community Health Project (CHP), a primary care center located in New York City that serves the needs of the LGBT community and people living with HIV/AIDS, was renamed to the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center after Callen and activist Audre Lorde.

== Performance career ==
Michael Callen briefly was the lead of the a cappella group Mike &amp; the Headsets. In 1982, Callen, along with Janet Cleary, Pamela Brandt, and Richard Dworkin formed a queer rock-and-roll band called Low Life. After Low Life disbanded, Callen&#x27;s solo album &quot;Purple Heart&quot; was released and quickly acclaimed as a staple of gay men&#x27;s music.

He was a founding member of the gay male a cappella singing group The Flirtations, with whom he recorded two albums. He also had a solo album, &quot;Purple Heart&quot;, which a review in &quot;The Advocate&quot; called &quot;the most remarkable gay independent release of the past decade.&quot; Callen recorded two albums with The Flirtations, as well as a double disc album, &quot;Legacy&quot;, which was released by Significant Other Records in 1996 after Callen&#x27;s death.

Additionally, Callen made cameo appearances in the films &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993) and &quot;Zero Patience&quot; (1993), in which he famously performed a song in falsetto as the fictitious &quot;Miss HIV&quot;.

In partnership with Oscar winner Peter Allen and Marsha Melamet, Callen wrote his most famous song, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Need a Reason&quot;, commissioned by Larry Kramer for his play, &quot;The Normal Heart.&quot; The song was introduced at a 1986 AIDS Walk and was performed frequently at gay pride and AIDS-related events around the country. The song has been covered by numerous gay men&#x27;s choirs as well as the Peter Allen Broadway musical &quot;The Boy From Oz&quot; (1998).

<text>Heavitree is a historic village and former civil parish situated formerly outside the walls of the City of Exeter in Devon, England, and is today an eastern district of that city. It was formerly the first significant village outside the city on the road to London. It was the birthplace of the librarian Thomas Bodley, and the theologian Richard Hooker, and from the 16th century to 1818 was a site for executions within what is now the car park of the St Luke&#x27;s Campus of the University of Exeter.

==History==
The name appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Hevetrowa&quot; or &quot;Hevetrove&quot;, and in a document of c.1130 as &quot;Hefatriwe&quot;. Its derivation is uncertain, but because of the known execution site at Livery Dole, it is thought most likely to derive from &quot;heafod–treow&quot; (old English for &quot;head tree&quot;), which refers to a tree on which the heads of criminals were placed, though an alternative explanation put forward by W. G. Hoskins is that it was a meeting place for the hundred court.

The last executions for witchcraft in England took place at Heavitree in 1682, when the &quot;Bideford Witches&quot; Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and Susanna Edwards were executed. (Local folklore used to associate the name with the aftermath of the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, when Judge Jeffreys supposedly ran out of gibbets.) The last execution to take place here was in 1818, when Samuel Holmyard was hanged at the Magdalen Drop for passing a forged one pound note.

In the hundred years from 1801 to 1901, the population of Heavitree grew from 833 to 7,529, reflecting its assimilation into the expanding city of Exeter. It first became an independent Urban District, but became a part of the city in 1913. Part of the historic district is still one of the wards for elections to the City Council.

In 1911 the parish had a population of 10,950. On 1 October 1928 the parish was abolished and merged with Exeter, Pinhoe, Topsham and Alphington.
The expanding population necessitated the rebuilding of the small medieval church and the church of St Michael and All Angels was built in 1844–46 to the design of architect David Mackintosh. Its most imposing feature is the west tower, built in 1890 to the design of E. Harbottle. In 2002, a yew tree in the churchyard was included among the &quot; 50 Great British Trees&quot; to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. However, it is unlikely that this is the actual tree from which Heavitree gets its name.

The Heavitree Brewery was a local brewer, located in Heavitree; its history can be traced back to 1790. It was the last brewery in Exeter to cease production, continuing until 1970, the brewery buildings were demolished in 1980. The name continues in use as the owner of a chain of pubs in South West England, and Heavitree Brewery PLC continues as a quoted company with its address in Exeter. There is also a linked charitable trust.

==Recreation==

By 1905 there was pressure to provide facilities for the youth of the district who were causing problems in Fore Street in the evenings, so at the end of that year the urban district council purchased four fields from a builder for £3,100 and opened a children&#x27;s playground on 1 May 1906. The rest of the grounds were landscaped by the Veitch family, and a bowling green and tennis courts followed in 1907. Heavitree Pleasure Ground is still open today and contains a number of leisure facilities.

The district&#x27;s football team, Heavitree Social United (a merger of the previous Heavitree United and Heavitree Social Club), is one of the better known local teams in Exeter, playing in the Devon and Exeter Football League Premier division; the club has previously played in the (more senior) Devon County League.

==Geography==
Heavitree lies on one of the most convenient routes from the city centre to the northbound M5 motorway and eastbound A30 trunk road ensuring that much traffic continues to pass through the district. Its main thoroughfare is Fore Street, a shopping street which rises sharply to the former execution site of Livery Dole, now marked by almshouses and a small medieval chapel built of red Heavitree stone. From here, Heavitree Road runs downhill to Exeter city centre, passing the former main city Police Station on the right and St Luke&#x27;s Hall, part of the University of Exeter, left. Heavitree is also the location of the Royal Devon and Exeter Heavitree Hospital.

Heavitree stone is a type of red sandstone that was formerly quarried in the area and was used to construct many of Exeter&#x27;s older buildings, including Exeter Guildhall.

The Heavitree Gap, a pass through the MacDonnell Ranges in Australia, was named after Heavitree by the surveyor William Mills, who had attended Heavitree School in England. The Heavitree Gap adjoins the city of Alice Springs in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory.

==Politics==
The area falls within the &#x27;Heavitree and Whipton Barton&#x27; division for elections to Devon County Council, with the area named for the Whipton Barton house demolished in the 1950s.

For Exeter City Council, there is a specific Heavitree Ward.

==Notable people==

*Samuel James Bouverie Haydon (1815–1891), sculptor
*Richard Hooker (1554–1600), whose writings were very influential in the Church of England in his own time and later, was born in Heavitree. There is a statue to Hooker in the grounds of Exeter Cathedral.
