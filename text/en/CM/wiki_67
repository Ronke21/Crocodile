<text>Carroll Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Cole (May 9, 1938 – December 6, 1985) was an American serial killer who was executed in Nevada in 1985 for killing two women by strangulation. He was also convicted of murdering three other women in Texas and is believed to have murdered up to thirty other people between 1947 and 1980.

==Early life==
Carroll Edward Cole was born in Sioux City, Iowa, the second son of LaVerne Cole (May 25, 1900 – February 5, 1975) and Vesta Cole (September 4, 1904 – January 27, 1984). His younger sister was born in 1939 and soon afterward, his family moved to California, where LaVerne found work in a shipyard. Not long after that, LaVerne went to fight in World War II. While his father was away, his mother had several affairs and sometimes took Cole along to her rendezvous, threatening to beat him if he told his father. Vesta was emotionally abusive to Cole and dressed him as a girl. At school, he was teased about his &quot;girly name&quot; by his peers.

===First murder===
At age 8, he retaliated against one of his classmates, a boy of the same age named Duane, by drowning him in a lake in Richmond, California. The death was regarded an accident by authorities until Cole confessed to it many years later in an autobiography he wrote in prison. During a press interview, Cole said of this event, &quot;I was primed, I had made the mental commitment I was going to get even with my mother, and things just built up and built up and became an obsession.&quot;

As a teen, Cole committed several petty crimes and was frequently arrested for drunkenness and minor thefts. After high school, he joined the U.S. Army, but was given a bad-conduct discharge in 1958 for stealing pistols. In 1960, Cole attacked two couples parked in cars on a lover&#x27;s lane. Soon afterward, he called the police in Richmond, California, where he was living, and told them that he was plagued by violent fantasies involving strangling women.

==Later life==
Cole spent time in various mental hospitals over the next three years. At the last of them, Stockton State Hospital, a Dr. Weiss wrote: &quot;He seems to be afraid of the female figure and cannot have intercourse with her first but must kill her before he can do it.&quot; Weiss approved his release in April 1963, despite hospital staff having diagnosed Cole with antisocial personality disorder.

Upon his release, Cole moved to Dallas, Texas, where his brother Richard was living. There, he met and married an alcoholic stripper named Billie Whitworth, but this did not change his perspective towards women. After two years, the marriage ended when Cole burned down a motel after convincing himself that Whitworth was having sex with men there. As a result, he was arrested for arson. Upon his release from prison, Cole attempted to strangle an 11-year-old girl in Missouri. He was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.

After the sentence was up, Cole ended up in Nevada, where he attempted to strangle two more women. Once again, he checked himself into a mental hospital. The doctors there noted his murderous fantasies but still elected not to detain him and he was given a ticket back to San Diego.

===Serial murders===
Cole&#x27;s first victim as an adult was Essie Louise Buck, whom he had picked up in a San Diego tavern on May 7, 1971. He strangled her to death in his car and drove around with her body in the trunk before eventually dumping it. Just two weeks later, he killed an unidentified woman and buried her in a wooded area. He later claimed that they had proven themselves unfaithful to their husbands, and so reminded him of his adulterous mother.

In July 1973, Cole married barmaid Diana Faye Younglove Pashal, who was also an alcoholic. They argued and fought frequently, and Cole regularly went off on his own for days at a time. He would commit murders while he was away, including one woman he allegedly cannibalized to a degree. In September 1979, Cole strangled Pashal to death. A suspicious neighbor called the police eight days later, but although they found Pashal&#x27;s body wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a closet, they decided that she had died because of her heavy drinking, and Cole was released without charge after questioning.

Cole left San Diego and started moving around again. In 1979, Cole met Marie Cushman at a bar in Las Vegas. That same evening, the two went to a motel where they had sex; he then killed her by strangulation.

Following the Las Vegas killing, he returned to Dallas, where he fatally strangled three more women in November 1980. Cole was a suspect in the second of these killings and was also found on the scene of the third murder. He was arrested and held in custody. The police then came to the conclusion that the victim had probably died of natural causes, and Cole was about to be ruled out as a suspect before he confessed to, along with this murder, all of the other killings. Cole claimed that he had murdered at least fourteen women over the previous nine years, although he added that there may have been more and he couldn&#x27;t remember exactly, as he was usually drunk when he committed his crimes.

==Conviction and death==
On April 9, 1981, Cole was convicted of three of the murders committed in Texas. He was sentenced to life at the Huntsville Prison. In 1984, Cole&#x27;s mother died and his attitude was reported to have changed. He agreed to face further murder charges filed in Nevada, even though it could possibly mean the death penalty.

In February 1984, Cole was extradited to Nevada, where he was tried and convicted for the strangulation deaths of two women in 1977 and 1979. In October 1984, Cole was sentenced to death in Nevada. When his sentencing was passed he said, &quot;Thanks, Judge.&quot; Sometime before his execution he reportedly converted to Catholicism. The victims in which Cole was convicted of killing were Kathlyn Blum, Marie Cushman, Sally Thompson, Dorothy King and Wanda Roberts, the latter three of whom were killed in Texas.

On the day of his execution, anti-death penalty campaigners, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the United Methodist Church of Reno, and fellow death row inmates tried to have his sentence commuted, but Cole protested. For his last meal, Cole ordered jumbo fried shrimp, french fries, salad with French dressing, and Boston clam chowder. The night before he requested Kentucky Fried Chicken, but guards could only give him chicken nuggets, as he was not allowed to have food with bones. Cole was executed by lethal injection at Nevada State Prison on December 6, 1985, at 2:10 am. His brain was removed hours after his execution and studied for abnormalities at the University of Nevada-Reno medical school.

<doc id="1216187" wikidata="Q246882" url="?curid=1216187" title="Agent (The Matrix)">
<text>Agents are a group of characters in the fictional universe of &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise. They are guardians within the computer-generated world of the Matrix, protecting it from anyone or anything (most often Redpills) that could reveal it as a false reality or threaten it in any other way. Agents also hunt down and terminate any rogue programs, such as The Keymaker, which no longer serve a purpose to the overall Machine objective. They are sentient computer programs disguised as human government agents, physically appearing as human but with a tendency to speak and act in highly precise and mechanical ways.

A notable individual Agent is Agent Smith, played by Hugo Weaving. He is introduced alongside his colleagues Agents Jones (Robert Taylor) and Brown (Paul Goddard) in the first &quot;The Matrix&quot; film in 1999. Other Agent characters have appeared in various media adaptations of the &quot;Matrix&quot; franchise.

==Physical aspects==
Agents appear in the guise of human government agents, wearing black-green business suits lined with a gold fabric, white dress shirts, black dress shoes, dark green neckties with a silver bar clip, square sunglasses, and a communication earpiece. These features are copied from the attire for plainclothes agents of the United States Secret Service, as well as those of the Men in Black conspiracy or the stereotypical G-Man/FBI official. All known individual Agents within &quot;The Matrix&quot; universe appear as Caucasian males. In &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, six months after the facts of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, the Source deployed the upgraded Agents Jackson, Johnson, and Thompson (portrayed by Daniel Bernhardt, David A. Kilde and Matt McColm), designed specifically by the Machines to defeat The One. Unlike the original Agents, they had a change of appearance: their suit jackets were lighter and had more of a grayish-green tone, they were bulkier, wider and taller in appearance. The Upgraded Agents also spoke with a slight, almost unnoticeable reverb effect to their voices, which made them sound intimidating even while discussing mundane matters; unlike the regular Agents who sounded perfectly normal.

Agents are, in fact, highly advanced artificial intelligence entities,
programmed with a number of superhuman abilities. As Agents do not exist in their own bodies as other programs do, being &quot;killed&quot; is a temporary inconvenience. Rather, they take over the virtualized body of a Bluepill—a human directly connected to the Matrix—which transforms into the Agent&#x27;s form until the Agent leaves the body.

==Analysis==
William Irwin said that the agents &quot;are impersonal, generic and interchangeable&quot; in contrast to the main characters who &quot;are complex, different, and complementary&quot;.

Lisa Nakamura said of Morpheus&#x27;s initiative, &quot;A black man leads the resistance or slave revolt against the machines, who are visible to us as Anglo-Saxon &#x27;agents&#x27; wearing suits. They all look the same, as one would expect machines to do, but most importantly they all look white and middle class in a way that no one in the resistance does.&quot; Morpheus tells Agent Smith in one scene, &quot;You all look the same to me.&quot; Nakamura said, &quot;Primarily, the presence of people of color in the film lets us know we are in the realm of the &quot;real&quot;; machine-induced fantasies and wish fulfillments, which is what the matrix is, are knowable to us by their distinctive and consistent whiteness.&quot; Nakamura says the agents visually represent the machines&#x27; hegemonic regime in having associations with corporations and cops. The agents wear business suits, and they are &quot;clearly allied with the hegemonic machine&quot;. The scene in which multiple white agents beat the black Morpheus is reminiscent of Rodney King being beaten by the Los Angeles Police Department.

Stephen Faller said of the Agents that &quot;fear seems to be the entry point&quot;, that &quot;only when someone is afraid or startled can he or she become an unwilling Agent&quot;.

Glenn Yeffetch described the agents as &quot;software modules within the Matrix&quot; that &quot;are intelligent but mindless automata&quot;, with the film having no mention of quantum computing for accessing consciousness. He said that Agent Smith saying, &quot;It&#x27;s the smell, if there&#x27;s such a thing,&quot; reveals the automation in which an agent doubts that a &quot;noncomputable quality&quot; is real and cannot differentiate between senses, where humans can find them &quot;irreducibly different&quot;.

<doc id="1216191" wikidata="Q1520855" url="?curid=1216191" title="Mount Blackburn">
<text>Mount Blackburn (Ahtna: &quot;K’ats’i Tl’aadi&quot;) is the highest peak in the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska in the United States. It is the fifth-highest peak in the United States and the twelfth-highest peak in North America. The mountain is an old, eroded shield volcano, the second-highest volcano in the U.S. behind Mount Bona and the fifth-highest in North America. It was named in 1885 by Lt. Henry T. Allen of the U.S. Army after Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn, a U.S. senator from Kentucky. It is located in the heart of Wrangell – St. Elias National Park, the largest national park in the country.

==Description==
The mountain&#x27;s massif is covered almost entirely by icefields and glaciers and is the principal source of ice for the Kennicott Glacier, which flows southeast over to just above the town of McCarthy. The mountain also contributes a large volume of ice to the north-flowing Nabesna Glacier and the Kuskulana Glacier system.

Mount Blackburn is a large, dramatic peak, with great local relief and independence from higher peaks. Its west face drops over to the Kuskulana Glacier in less than . Its other faces drop , all in less than . The toe of the Kuskulana Glacier, less than from the summit, lies at an elevation of , giving a rise of . While these figures speak to the peak&#x27;s relief, one measure of its independence is that it is the 50th-most topographically prominent peak in the world.

The western of Blackburn&#x27;s two summits is the mountain&#x27;s highest point, a fact that was not understood until the 1960s when new USGS maps were published. The first ascent of the west peak, and hence Mount Blackburn, was done on May 30, 1958, by Bruce Gilbert, Dick Wahlstrom, Hans Gmoser, Adolf Bitterlich, and Leon Blumer via the North (also called the Northwest) Ridge. This team made the first ascent of Blackburn but did not even know it at the time due to the incorrect identification of the highest point. Blumer&#x27;s article in the 1959 American Alpine Journal is titled &quot;Mount Blackburn – Second Ascent.&quot;

== Other subfeatures ==
Kennedy Peak, or East Blackburn, , is the eastern summit and was originally thought to be the highest point. The first ascent of this summit was made in 1912 by Dora Keen and George Handy via the Kennicott Glacier (on the south side of the mountain) and East Face. This heady exploit was ahead of its time. Dora Keen, driven by a deep desire for the climb, solicited miners from the nearby Kennecott Copper Mines, and forged a route up the heavily crevassed East Face to the East Peak, but did not traverse over to the West Peak. Keen went on to write a famous article for the Saturday Evening Post titled, &quot;First up Mount Blackburn.&quot; In 1912, Keen and Handy thought they were on Blackburn&#x27;s highest point.

==Geology==
Mount Blackburn represents the heavily eroded core of a shield volcano. Because it is shrouded in permanent ice, its internal structure cannot be determined. It is believed to have a summit caldera, greatly modified by glaciation. The oldest rocks in the area are granites, about 4.2 million years old, representing an intrusive mass. The majority of the mountain is 3.4 million year old granite, intruding between andesite flows. From this it is inferred that a caldera collapse took place between 4.2 and 3.4 million years ago, after which activity ceased.

==Climbing==
Today&#x27;s standard route on the peak is the 1958 ascent route, the North (or Northwest) Ridge, which is approached from the Nabesna Glacier, on the north side of the mountain, opposite from Keen and Hardy&#x27;s route. The route starts from an airstrip on the glacier at an altitude of . It is a moderate climb by Alaskan standards (Alaska Grade 2).

<text>Miles from Our Home is the seventh studio album by Canadian alt-country band Cowboy Junkies, which was released in 1998. It was their second and final album for Geffen Records. The title track was a significant hit in their native Canada. Following this album, the Junkies were dropped from the Geffen record label. The Junkies moved to an independent label, Latent Recordings, for their subsequent albums.

== Album development ==
Prior to writing new material, Michael Timmins spent a month collecting various segments of lyrical and musical ideas that were accumulated over the past year. At the start of the intended writing process, The Cowboy Junkies heard the news that Townes Van Zandt had died. Van Zandt was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on Michael, showcasing songs that were peep-holes into the soul. Michael wrote the first draft of &quot;Blue Guitar&quot; the day that he heard Van Zandt died, &quot;as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that I had ever heard.&quot; However, the song wasn&#x27;t finished at the time, and was put away for a while. The following month, Michael came into possession of some of Van Zandt&#x27;s unpublished and unfinished lyrics, including one titled &quot;Screams from the Kitchen&quot; which had lyrics that just popped out. With permission from Van Zandt&#x27;s widow, Jeanene Van Zandt, he incorporated the lyrics into the song &quot;Blue Guitar&quot; which managed to finish off the song, completing the tribute to Van Zandt, and becoming Michael Timmins favorite on the album.

The Cowboy Junkies wanted to repeat the process of writing and creating that they used for &quot;Lay It Down&quot;. Michael Timmins found a house near a gristmill on a pond, a couple hours from Toronto called Maiden&#x27;s Mill. Michael spent six months at the house writing the songs, and during that period, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down at times to work on a few songs, then let Michael write some more, and then revisit and create some more, until the Junkies were ready to record. The bands plan for the album was to develop the songs minimally at this point, and to use a studio and a good producer to help finish up the work. They searched out a producer, and selected John Leckie who impressed the band with his love of music and his resume of other bands he had worked with. Leckie came over from England and joined the band at Maiden&#x27;s Mill and spent a few days listening to the songs the band had assembled. Leckie found a recording studio in Toronto called McClear that he liked for its large room and for being well-equipped. In September 1997, the basic tracks were recorded, along with guitar overdubs, and the vocals. Michael Timmins managed to record seven or eight overdubs for the title track, which was his career high for overdubs. Leckie recommended Vince Jones of The Grapes of Wrath for the keyboard work, and he flew in from Vancouver to add piano and organ work for ten tracks in one day. Some of the overdub work was done at another Toronto studio, Chemical, which eventually became one of the Cowboy Junkies favorite studios. When the recording was complete, Leckie took the tracks to London to mix the tracks at Abbey Road. Leckie and the Junkies mixed for three weeks in Studio One, and recorded strings in Studio Two. During this period, the band were constantly reminded of the Beatles previous occupancy of the studios, and somewhat awed by it. At one point, the band ran into Robert Plant and Jimmy Page in the basement cafeteria and shared a brief greeting. Craig Leon wrote out the string arrangements, and Gavyn Wright and a small string orchestra created the music, all the while overseen in a small control room which was crowded with the band, Leckie, two engineers, an agent, and a writer, which added up to a very expensive three hours of a recording session. After a few weeks of mixing, the Cowboy Junkies returned to Canada with a CD. However, after taking a break from all music for a period, the band decided a few of the mixes could be different, so they had Michael Timmins sit with Chris Lord-Alge (Mr. Mixer) at his Los Angeles studio and re-mix several of the tracks for a few days.

The theme for &quot;Miles from Our Home&quot; is &#x27;why?&#x27; The tracks deal with the repercussions of the question differently, such as &quot;Someone Out There&quot; which deals with anger, &quot;New Dawn Coming&quot; with hope, &quot;Miles from Our Home&quot; with dignity, and &quot;Darkling Day&quot; which supplies some answers.

<doc id="1216205" wikidata="Q32661" url="?curid=1216205" title="Jane Goldman">
<text>Jane Loretta Anne Goldman (born 11 June 1970) is a British screenwriter and producer. She is mostly known for collaborating with director Matthew Vaughn on the screenplays of &quot;&quot; (2014) and its sequel &quot;&quot; (2017), as well as &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011), &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; (2010), and &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007). Goldman also worked on the story of &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), the sequel to &quot;First Class&quot;, again in partnership with Vaughn. Both met high critical praise for their work.

Goldman&#x27;s first solo screenplay is &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; (2012). She also wrote the script for &quot;The Limehouse Golem&quot; and Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot;, both released in 2016. She is the writer of Edgar Wright&#x27;s upcoming remake of &quot;Barbarella&quot;.

She has also written books such as &quot;The X-Files Book of the Unexplained&quot; (1995) and the novel &quot;Dreamworld&quot; (2000). Goldman presented her own TV show, &quot;Jane Goldman Investigates&quot; (2003–04), a non-fiction series on the paranormal, for the channel Living.

==Early life==
Goldman was raised in a liberal, middle-class family in north London, the only child of a Jewish father, Stuart and a Buddhist mother, Amanda. She attended the King Alfred School, an independent school in Hampstead, until the age of 15 before moving to the United States to follow Boy George on tour. Upon her return to the UK, she took a job as an entertainment reporter with the &quot;Daily Star&quot;. When she was 16, she met TV presenter Jonathan Ross. They married in 1988, when Goldman was 18 years old. The couple have three children: two daughters and a son.

==Professional career==

===Journalism, books and TV===
As a journalist, Goldman worked on newspapers and magazines such as &quot;Just Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Daily Star&quot;, &quot;Total Guitar&quot;, &quot;Game Zone&quot; and &quot;Sega Zone&quot;. At the age of 19, she became a freelance writer.

Goldman also wrote books: &quot;Thirteen-Something&quot; (1993), &quot;Streetsmarts: A Teenager&#x27;s Safety Guide&quot; (1996), &quot;Sussed and Streetwise&quot; (1997), the two-volume best-selling series &quot;The X-Files Book of the Unexplained&quot; (1997), her first and only novel &quot;Dreamworld&quot; (2000), and &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (2003), among others.

Between 2003 and 2004 she had her own television series. &quot;Jane Goldman Investigates&quot; researched the paranormal and was transmitted by channel Living between 2003 and 2004. Goldman is also in the production teams of a number of TV shows, such as &quot;The Big Fat Quiz of the Year&quot;.

In 2000, she modelled for Fantasie Bras.

===Screenwriting===
She made the jump to screenwriting, and was part of the writing team for David Baddiel&#x27;s short-lived sitcom &quot;Baddiel&#x27;s Syndrome&quot;, in 2001. Later, she co-wrote the screenplay of &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007), based on the novel of the same name by Neil Gaiman and directed by Matthew Vaughn. Gaiman introduced Goldman to Vaughn to provide the director some help with the adaptation process. The film received many accolades and gave the screenwriters a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.

After &quot;Stardust&quot;, Goldman became a frequent collaborator of Vaughn. In a 2011 interview, the writer said that when she works with the director she does the &quot;construction work&quot; and the &quot;interior designing&quot; while Vaughn acts as the &quot;architect.&quot; Goldman co-wrote his next films, the comic-book adaptations &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; (2010) and &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011). Both films won strong praise amongst film critics. &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; nowadays has a cult following, while &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; is considered by many critics to be one of the best of all &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise. Rotten Tomatoes consensus says: &quot;With a strong script, stylish direction, and powerful performances from its well-rounded cast, &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; is a welcome return to form for the franchise.&quot; Goldman has described the film as an &quot;alternate history&quot; for the X-Men, saying that while rebooting, the writers did not want to go fully &quot;against the canon of the &quot;X-Men&quot; trilogy&quot;, comparing to the various approaches the comic had in over fifty years of publication.

She continued to work in adaptations, and was also a co-writer with Vaughn and Peter Straughan for the 2011 drama-thriller &quot;The Debt&quot;, which was based on the 2007 Israeli film &quot;HaHov&quot; and directed by John Madden. Goldman also adapted for Hammer &quot;The Woman in Black&quot;, a gothic horror film based on Susan Hill&#x27;s novel. The project marks the first solo screenplay by Goldman. The film was directed by James Watkins. It was released in 2012 and met positive reviews. In March 2013, &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; won the Empire Award for Best Horror.

She is credited on &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, the sequel to &quot;First Class&quot;, as writing the story with Matthew Vaughn and Simon Kinberg. After that project, she co-wrote with Vaughn the script for &quot;&quot; (2015), based on the comic book by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons.

She wrote the script for &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot;, an adaptation of the Ransom Riggs novel of the same name, which was directed by Tim Burton. The project was followed by &quot;The Limehouse Golem&quot;, an adaptation of Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s 1994 murder mystery novel &quot;Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem&quot;. Goldman read the book years before she was a professional screenwriter and kept it in mind as a potential project. She said in an interview for &quot;ScreenCraft&quot;: &quot;What&#x27;s funny is that I read the book long before I was screenwriting. I think it was the only time that I can remember when I read a book and thought, &#x27;Gosh, I hope somebody makes a movie of this!&#x27; ... Weirdly, years later I was on a film jury together with the producer whom I had read had the rights and I asked him whatever happened to the adaptation and said that I loved the book. That is how this came about, because he said the rights were free again and asked, &#x27;Do you want to do it?&#x27;&quot;

Goldman and Vaughn collaborated again for the screenplay of &quot;&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Secret Service&quot;. The film was released in 2017.

In May of that year, HBO announced Goldman was one of four writers working on a potential pilot for a &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; spin-off. In addition to Goldman, Carly Wray, Max Borenstein, and Brian Helgeland were also working on potential pilots. Goldman worked with George R. R. Martin, the author of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, the series of novels upon which the original show is based and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; showrunners D. B. Weiss and David Benioff would also be executive producers for whichever project.

In June 2018, it was confirmed that Goldman&#x27;s pilot had been greenlit by HBO, and would focus on &quot;the world&#x27;s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour&quot;, thousands of years before the events of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Naomi Watts was cast in a lead role and S.J. Clarkson was the chosen director for the opening episode. In late October 2019, it was announced that HBO would not be moving forward with the pilot.

In December 2017, Goldman was announced as the writer of Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, with Rob Marshall being eyed to direct. She was not credited in the final script.

Goldman co-wrote the 2020 adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s Gothic romance &quot;Rebecca&quot;, directed by Ben Wheatley.

===Upcoming projects===
According to &quot;Deadline&quot; in May 2024, Goldman and her screenwriter daughter, Honey Goldman, were in negotiations to write &quot;Barbarella&quot;, a remake of the 1968 science fiction classic. Edgar Wright was in negotiations to direct at that point, with Sydney Sweeney in the lead role and Sony Pictures as the distributor.

==In popular culture==
Alongside her husband, broadcaster Jonathan Ross, Goldman appeared as a character in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s short story &quot;The Facts in the Case of the Departure of Miss Finch&quot; in 1996. Gaiman is a personal friend of the couple.

<text>Moolooite is a rare blue-green mineral with the formula Cu(C2O4)·n(H2O) (n&lt;1) (copper(II) oxalate hydrate). It was discovered in Bunbury Well, Mooloo Downs station, Murchison, Western Australia in 1986. It has an orthorhombic crystalline structure, and is formed by the interaction of bird guano with weathering copper sulfides.

A second occurrence is reported from the Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines silver mining district of Vosges Mountains, France.

<doc id="1216222" wikidata="Q731435" url="?curid=1216222" title="Leonard Lake">
<text>Leonard Thomas Lake (October 29, 1945June 6, 1985), also known as Leonard Hill and a variety of other aliases, was an American survivalist and serial killer. During the mid-1980s, Lake and his accomplice, Hong Kong-born Charles Ng, raped, tortured and murdered an estimated eleven to twenty-five victims at a remote cabin near Wilseyville, California, 150 miles east of San Francisco. Upon being arrested on unrelated charges in 1985, Lake swallowed cyanide pills that he had sewn into his clothing and died four days later. Human remains, videotapes and journals found at his cabin later confirmed Ng&#x27;s involvement, and were used to convict Ng on eleven counts of capital murder.

==Early life==
Leonard Lake was born in San Francisco, California, the first of three children to Elgin Leonard Lake and Gloria May Williams. Lake&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 6, and her second marriage produced two half-sisters. The siblings moved in with their maternal grandmother after the divorce. 

Lake was reportedly a bright child, but developed an obsession with pornography after habitually photographing his sisters nude, which his grandmother apparently encouraged. Lake allegedly killed mice by dissolving them in chemicals, in the same manner he would later dispose of his human victims&#x27; corpses, and became fascinated with the idea of holding women captive after reading the John Fowles novel &quot;The Collector&quot; in his teens.

After attending Balboa High School, Lake enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1964. He served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War as a radar electronics technician. During this period, Lake was first diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder. After what was termed a &quot;delusional breakdown&quot; in Da Nang, Lake received psychotherapy and, in 1971, a medical discharge.

Lake settled in San Jose and enrolled at San Jose State University, but dropped out after one semester upon becoming enamored of San Francisco&#x27;s hippie community. He moved to a commune in San Francisco and married briefly in 1969. The marriage dissolved, however, after his wife discovered that he was making and appearing in amateur pornographic movies, usually involving bondage or sadomasochism.

For the next eight years, Lake lived at the Greenfield Ranch, a 5,600 acre back-to-the-land settlement near Calpella, north of Ukiah. In 1975, he met and eventually married Claralyn Balazs — nicknamed &quot;Cricket&quot; — who became involved in Lake&#x27;s fantasies and appeared in many of his pornographic films. Lake&#x27;s growing fear of impending nuclear holocaust prompted him to begin construction of a &quot;bunker&quot; on the settlement grounds until the owner of the property became aware of the project and ordered it halted.

==Murders==

Lake met Charles Ng, a fellow former Marine who was originally from Hong Kong, in 1980 or 1981. Sources claim the two met through an advertisement Lake, by that time managing a Philo motel, had placed in a survivalist magazine. Ng had escaped from a military prison following a conviction for weapons theft and stayed at Lake&#x27;s motel, eventually moving into a house along with Lake and Balazs. Several witnesses testified that Lake was a domineering figure in their relationship; Ng stated that he looked up to Lake &quot;like a brotherly, fatherly figure.&quot; 

In April 1982, police arrested Lake and Ng on weapons charges. Ng was returned to Fort Leavenworth to complete his sentence. Lake jumped bail and began life as a fugitive, using various aliases and disguises in an attempt to hide his identity. In July 1984, Ng rejoined Lake and his wife after he had completed his sentence and had been dishonorably discharged. He first stayed in an apartment rented by one of Lake&#x27;s sisters before moving into an apartment on Lenox Ave in San Francisco that autumn. Meanwhile, Lake moved into a remote cabin near Wilseyville owned by his in-laws. Next to the cabin he had built a structure described in his journals as a &quot;dungeon&quot;.

Over the next year, Lake and Ng began a pattern of kidnapping and murder of men, women, and children. These crimes are known as the Miranda Murders, named after a character in The Collector, a book that inspired Lake. According to court records, Lake and Ng killed the men and infants immediately, but subjected women to a period of enslavement, rape, and torture before killing them. Lake is known to have committed several murders without the assistance of Ng, and wrote in his journal that Ng was initially &quot;very hesitant to get involved with my plan&quot;.

===Victims===
* Donald Steven Lake, 31, was Leonard&#x27;s younger brother and had been hit by a train as a child and was mentally disabled from the accident. Leonard resented him because his disability required the full attention of their mother, resulting in Leonard being raised by their grandparents. Leonard referred to him as a &quot;leech&quot; in conversations with his ex-wife Balazs, and said that he did not deserve to live. In December 1982, Donald was living with his mother in San Francisco, California when Leonard stopped by and asked Donald to come along to a house-sitting job. Donald was never seen again, and his mother reported him missing. Leonard resurfaced on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1983 to rent a room in a house under the name &quot;Alan Drey&quot;. Leonard had stolen Donald&#x27;s identity and began cashing his disability checks. Leonard also later forged a letter to their mother claiming to be Donald and that he had moved away to live with drug dealers in Reno, Nevada.
* Four months later, Lake moved in with his friend, Charles Donald Gunnar, 34. Gunnar was the best man at Lake&#x27;s wedding to Balazs in 1981. On May 22, 1983, Lake invited Gunnar to go on a road trip to Las Vegas after his divorce. Several days later, Lake returned alone in Gunnar&#x27;s van and said to acquaintances that Gunnar ran off with a woman. Gunnar was never seen again. After the murder, Lake stole Gunnar&#x27;s identity and began to cash his government checks. Lake introduced himself as Gunnar to most of the people he met while living in Wilseyville. Gunnar&#x27;s body was not found by police during the initial 1985 investigation, but was unearthed in 1992 when a subsequent owner of the Wilseyville property was digging down to install a footing for a new garage.
* On May 1, 1984, Jeffrey Dean Askren, 30, was reported missing after not showing up for work in Santa Clara, California. His late model Honda automobile was found three days later in the West Point area of Calaveras County, six miles from Lake&#x27;s home. His disappearance occurred within the time range of Lake&#x27;s killings although his remains have not yet been identified from those that were recovered at the Wilseyville site.
* On July 11, 1984, Donald Albert Giulietti, 36, a radio personality from San Francisco, California was spending time in his apartment expecting a visitor. Giulietti was openly gay and lived with another man named Richard Carrazza. Giulietti placed a personal advertisement in a local newspaper offering to give oral sex to straight men. That night a stranger knocked on the door and as soon as Giulietti opened the door, a man whipped out a pistol and shot him in the head at close range. Carrazza was also immediately shot in the chest. The individual fled and Carrazza called the police. Carrazza, the only known survivor victim of Lake or Ng, would go on to identify Ng as the shooter. 
* Harvey R. Dubs, 30, Deborah Ann Dubs, 33, and Sean Christopher Dubs, 1, went missing on July 25, 1984, from their San Francisco home. On the night they disappeared, Deborah was speaking on the telephone to a friend when the doorbell rang at their apartment. Deborah told her friend that she had to end the conversation, as two men had arrived. The Dubs family have never been heard from again. A receipt in Harvey&#x27;s name, and video equipment from the Dubs&#x27; home were found at Lake&#x27;s cabin. 
* In July or August 1984, Maurice Anthony Rock, 37, disappeared from a San Francisco rooming house. Lake had rented a room at the same establishment under the pseudonym &quot;Alan Drey&quot;. Sometime after Rock disappeared, the woman renting the room next to Rock saw a man removing a refrigerator from his room. The man introduced himself as &quot;Steve&quot; and offered to photograph her. She agreed but felt unsettled and changed her mind once he came to her room with his camera equipment. She later identified the man as Lake. Rock&#x27;s remains were recovered from the Wilseyville property.
* On October 15, 1984, Randy Vern Jacobson, 35, also disappeared from a San Francisco rooming house after becoming involved in a business deal with Lake. His identity was subsequently stolen by Lake who tried to steal Jacobson&#x27;s van after the murder, but was unsuccessful as the van was towed away before he was able to move it. Jacobson&#x27;s remains were buried on the Wilseyville property.
* On November 2, 1984, Paul Steven Cosner, 39, was last seen in San Francisco, California. His brown 1980 Honda Prelude disappeared with him. Cosner had advertised the vehicle for sale in a local newspaper and went missing when he went to show his car to a potential buyer he described as “weird&quot;. Lake was arrested with Cosner&#x27;s car on June 2, 1985. Cosner&#x27;s remains have never been found.
* On November 16, 1984, Sheryl Lynn Okoro, 25, disappeared from the same San Francisco rooming house where Rock had disappeared. Photographs, an 11-page letter written by Okoro, and her remains were recovered from the Wilseyville property.
* On January 20, 1985, Clifford Raymond Peranteau, 23, went missing from San Francisco. He was a coworker of Ng’s at Dennis Moving Company and in April 1985, Lake sold Peranteau&#x27;s motorcycle to a man in West Point, California. Several of Peranteau&#x27;s personal belongings were discovered in an apartment owned by Ng.
* On February 24, 1985, Jeffrey Dean Gerald, 25, went missing from San Francisco after saying he was going to help Ng move for a side job. 
* On April 12, 1985, Michael Sean Carroll, 22, who had served with Ng in Fort Leavenworth, and his girlfriend Kathleen Elizabeth Allen, 18, were spending time in a Milpitas, California motel room. At 10 p.m., Carroll told Allen that he had to leave but he never returned. On April 15, Allen received a phone call at her workplace and was told that Carroll was at Lake Tahoe and may have been shot. She immediately told her boss that she had to leave and she was last seen getting into a car with Lake. Allen appeared in a videotape found at Lake&#x27;s home and her last paycheck was sent to a town near his cabin. Carroll was also mentioned in the videotape and his driver&#x27;s license was found at the property.
* On April 19, 1985, Lonnie Wayne Bond Sr., 27, his live-in girlfriend Brenda Sue O&#x27;Connor, 20, their son, Lonnie Wayne Bond Jr., 1, and a family friend, Robin Scott Stapley, 26, went missing from Wilseyville. When Lake was arrested on June 2, Lonnie&#x27;s license plate was affixed to the car he was driving. The bodies of Lonnie Sr. and Stapley were found buried at Wilseyville in a shallow grave about a mile from Lake&#x27;s property. O&#x27;Connor and Lonnie Jr. have never been found.

== Arrest, suicide and aftermath ==
On June 2, 1985, Ng was caught shoplifting a vise from a hardware store in South San Francisco and fled the scene on foot, throwing the vise into the trunk of a brown Honda. Lake attempted to pay for the vise, but by then police had arrived. Officers noticed that Lake bore no resemblance to the photo on his driver&#x27;s license, which carried the name of Robin Scott Stapley, a San Diego man reported missing by his family several weeks earlier. Lake was arrested after a gun equipped with a prohibited silencer was found in the trunk of his vehicle, a 1980 Honda Prelude, and was later positively identified via a fingerprint search. At the station, Lake was placed in an interrogation room where he was given a pen, paper, and a glass of water. A short time later, a detective entered the room to conduct an interview and found Lake violently convulsing on the floor. The notepad contained a brief suicide note. At the hospital, it was determined that he swallowed cyanide pills that he had sewn into his clothes. Lake never regained consciousness and died four days later on June 6.

The license plate on Lake&#x27;s vehicle was registered to Lonnie Bond, but the VIN on the Honda itself was registered to Paul Cosner, who had disappeared from San Francisco in November 1984. A utility bill found in the Honda led detectives under the command of San Francisco Police Homicide Lieutenant Gerald McCarthy to the property in Wilseyville, where they found Stapley&#x27;s and Bond&#x27;s trucks, and the dungeon. In a makeshift burial site nearby, police unearthed over forty pounds of burned and crushed human bone fragments corresponding to a minimum of eleven bodies.

They also found a hand-drawn &quot;treasure map&quot;, leading them to two buried five-gallon buckets. One contained an envelope with names and identifications, suggesting that the total number of victims might have been as high as 25. In the other bucket were Lake&#x27;s handwritten journals for the years 1983 and 1984, and two videotapes documenting the torture of two of their victims. On one of the tapes, labeled &quot;M-Ladies&quot;, Ng is seen telling victim Brenda O&#x27;Connor, as he cuts her shirt off with a knife, &quot;You can cry and stuff, like the rest of them, but it won&#x27;t do any good. We are pretty … cold-hearted, so to speak.&quot; In another part of the tape, Katherine Allen is seen seated in a chair, with Lake warning her, &quot;If you don&#x27;t go along with us, we&#x27;ll probably take you into the bed, tie you down, rape you, shoot you, and bury you.&quot; In the other, Deborah Dubs is shown being assaulted so severely that she &quot;could not have survived&quot;.

Lake&#x27;s ex-wife, Claralyn Balazs, cooperated with investigators and received legal immunity from prosecution. Court records stated that Balazs turned over weapons and other material to authorities during the investigation. She was called as a key witness in Ng&#x27;s trial in 1999. Yet in a surprise move, Ng&#x27;s lawyer, William Kelley, dismissed Balazs without asking any questions. Kelley later declined to explain his actions. Balazs was on the witness stand for a few minutes as Kelley read sections of her immunity agreement. Balazs had been expected to shed light on what happened inside the mountain cabin that her parents owned and rented to her and Lake.

Ng, who had never legally obtained U.S. citizenship, was captured in a department store in Calgary, Alberta, on July 6, 1985. A store security guard suspected Ng of shoplifting and in the ensuing confrontation, Ng shot the security guard. Though wounded, the security guard was able to disarm and detain Ng until the police arrived. Ng served four and a half years in a Canadian prison, and tried to fight extradition to the United States on the grounds that he would be subject to capital punishment. In 1991, he was extradited to California, where he was indicted on twelve counts of first-degree murder. Despite the video evidence, and the detailed information in Lake&#x27;s diaries, Ng maintained that he was merely an observer and that Lake planned and committed all of the kidnaps, rapes, and murders unassisted.

In February 1999, Ng was convicted of eleven of the twelve homicides — six men, three women, and two male infants. Jurors deadlocked on the twelfth charge, the murder of Paul Cosner, but Ng was sentenced to death. The presiding judge noted, &quot;Mr. Ng was not under any duress, nor does the evidence support that he was under the domination of Leonard Lake.&quot; , Ng was incarcerated at California Medical Facility. The last execution in California was in 2006. In 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order placing a moratorium on the death penalty in California.

<doc id="1216224" wikidata="Q181202" url="?curid=1216224" title="Quake engine">
<text>The &quot;Quake&quot; engine (id Tech 2), is the game engine developed by id Software to power their 1996 video game &quot;Quake&quot;. It featured true 3D real-time rendering. Since 1999, it has been licensed under the terms of GNU General Public License v2.0 or later.

After release, the &quot;Quake&quot; engine immediately forked. Much of the engine remained in &quot;Quake II&quot; and &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;. The &quot;Quake&quot; engine, like the &quot;Doom&quot; engine, used binary space partitioning (BSP) to optimise the world rendering. The &quot;Quake&quot; engine also used Gouraud shading for moving objects, and a static lightmap for non-moving objects.

Historically, the &quot;Quake&quot; engine has been treated as a separate engine from its successor, the &quot;Quake II&quot; engine. Although the codebases for &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Quake II&quot; were separate GPL releases, both engines are now considered variants of id Tech 2.

==History==
The &quot;Quake&quot; engine was developed from 1995 for the video game &quot;Quake&quot;, released on June 22, 1996. John Carmack did most of the programming of the engine, with help from Michael Abrash in algorithms and assembly optimization. The Quake II engine (id Tech 2.5) was based on it.

John Romero initially conceived of &quot;Quake&quot; as an action game taking place in a fully 3D polygon world, inspired by Sega AM2&#x27;s 3D fighting game &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. &quot;Quake&quot; was also intended to feature &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;-influenced third-person melee combat. However, id Software considered it to be risky, and it would&#x27;ve taken longer to develop the engine. Because the project was taking too long, the third-person melee was eventually dropped.

==Derivative engines==

On December 21, 1999, John Carmack of id Software released the &quot;Quake&quot; engine source code on the Internet under the terms of GPL-2.0-or-later, allowing programmers to edit the engine and add new features. Programmers were soon releasing new versions of the engine on the net. Some of the most known engines are:
* GoldSrc – The first engine to be created by Valve. It was used in the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series, and gave rise to the Source engine. The Xash3D projects, as well as the FreeHL and FreeCS ports, use &quot;Quake&quot; source code in part to recreate this engine, even with a wrapper for running the game.
* DarkPlaces – A significantly modified engine used in several standalone games and &quot;Quake&quot; mods. Although the last stable release was on May 13, 2014, it has received numerous updates through its SVN repository since then. Its home page was hosted on Icculus.org until 2021, when the engine switched to a Git repository hosted on GitHub. The developers of &quot;Xonotic&quot; provide mirrors of DarkPlaces source code on various social coding platforms since the game is built on and distributed with the development version of the engine.
* QuakeForge - One of the earlier major community ports.
* NPRQuake - Fork of &quot;Quake&quot; featuring non-photorealistic rendering giving it a pencil drawn look.
* Tenebrae - Custom &quot;Quake&quot; engine with real time lighting and bumpmapping among other features.
* Fisheye Quake - Custom &quot;Quake&quot; engine with fisheye distortion by the author of PanQuake.
* Blinky - Fork of the fisheye view along with the TyrQuake software renderer.
* Engoo (Derivative of WinQuake) - Graphically enhanced software renderer based port.
* Fruitz of Dojo - Source port aimed at Mac OS X.
* TyrQuake - A conservative focused source port.
* NehQuake - Custom engine for the Nehara mod.
* FitzQuake (Derivative of GLQuake) - Seminal port whose SDL version was later forked into numerous others.
* MarkV (Derivative of FitzQuake, successor to DirectQ) - Came in both GLQuake and WinQuake derived versions.
* Quakespasm (Derivative of FitzQuake) – Commonly used source port.
* Quakespasm-Spiked (Derivative of Quakespasm) - Limit-removing fork. 
* vkQuake – (Derivative of Quakespasm) – Uses Vulkan API for rendering programmed by id Software employee Axel Gneiting, released under the GPLv2.
* Ironwail - (Derivative of Quakespasm) – An engine aiming at maximum performance.
* FTEQW (Derivative of QuakeWorld) - A modern client for online multiplayer.
* ezQuake (Derivative of FuhQuake) - Multiplayer focused port often paired with the nQuake launcher.
* JoeQuake (Derivative of FuhQuake) - A port popular with speedrunners.

<doc id="1216247" wikidata="Q281381" url="?curid=1216247" title="Wolff–Kishner reduction">
<text>The Wolff–Kishner reduction is a reaction used in organic chemistry to convert carbonyl functionalities into methylene groups. In the context of complex molecule synthesis, it is most frequently employed to remove a carbonyl group after it has served its synthetic purpose of activating an intermediate in a preceding step. As such, there is no obvious retron for this reaction. The reaction was reported by Nikolai Kischner in 1911 and Ludwig Wolff in 1912.

In general, the reaction mechanism first involves the &quot;in situ&quot; generation of a hydrazone by condensation of hydrazine with the ketone or aldehyde substrate. Sometimes it is however advantageous to use a pre-formed hydrazone as substrate (see modifications). The rate determining step of the reaction is de-protonation of the hydrazone by an alkoxide base to form a diimide anion by a concerted, solvent mediated protonation/de-protonation step. Collapse of this alkyldiimide with loss of N2 leads to formation of an alkylanion which can be protonated by solvent to give the desired product.

Because the Wolff–Kishner reduction requires highly basic conditions, it is unsuitable for base-sensitive substrates. In some cases, formation of the required hydrazone will not occur at sterically hindered carbonyl groups, preventing the reaction. However, this method can be superior to the related Clemmensen reduction for compounds containing acid-sensitive functional groups such as pyrroles and for high-molecular weight compounds.

==History==
The Wolff–Kishner reduction was discovered independently by N. Kishner in 1911 and Ludwig Wolff in 1912. Kishner found that addition of pre-formed hydrazone to hot potassium hydroxide containing crushed platinized porous plate led to formation of the corresponding hydrocarbon. A review titled “Disability, Despotism, Deoxygenation—From Exile to Academy Member: Nikolai Matveevich Kizhner” describing the life and work of Kishner was published in 2013.

Wolff later accomplished the same result by heating an ethanol solution of semicarbazones or hydrazones in a sealed tube to 180 °C in the presence of sodium ethoxide.

The method developed by Kishner has the advantage of avoiding the requirement of a sealed tube, but both methodologies suffered from unreliability when applied to many hindered substrates. These disadvantages promoted the development of Wolff’s procedure, wherein the use of high-boiling solvents such as ethylene glycol and triethylene glycol were implemented to allow for the high temperatures required for the reaction while avoiding the need of a sealed tube. These initial modifications were followed by many other improvements as described below.

==Mechanism==
The mechanism of the Wolff–Kishner reduction has been studied by Szmant and coworkers. According to Szmant&#x27;s research, the first step in this reaction is the formation of a hydrazone anion 1 by deprotonation of the terminal nitrogen by MOH. If semicarbazones are used as substrates, initial conversion into the corresponding hydrazone is followed by deprotonation. A range of mechanistic data suggests that the rate-determining step involves formation of a new carbon–hydrogen bond at the carbon terminal in the delocalized hydrazone anion. This proton capture takes place in a concerted fashion with a solvent-induced abstraction of the second proton at the nitrogen terminal. Szmant’s finding that this reaction is first order in both hydroxide ion and ketone hydrazone supports this mechanistic proposal. Several molecules of solvent have to be involved in this process in order to allow for a concerted process. A detailed Hammett analysis of aryl aldehydes, methyl aryl ketones and diaryl ketones showed a non-linear relationship which the authors attribute to the complexity of the rate-determining step. Mildly electron-withdrawing substituents favor carbon-hydrogen bond formation, but highly electron-withdrawing substituents will decrease the negative charge at the terminal nitrogen and in turn favor a bigger and harder solvation shell that will render breaking of the N-H bond more difficult. The exceptionally high negative entropy of activation values observed can be explained by the high degree of organization in the proposed transition state.

It was furthermore found that the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of the hydroxylic solvent and on the cation in the alkoxide catalyst. The presence of crown ether in the reaction medium can increase the reactivity of the hydrazone anion 1 by dissociating the ion pair and therefore enhance the reaction rate. 
The final step of the Wolff–Kishner reduction is the collapse of the dimide anion 2 in the presence of a proton source to give the hydrocarbon via loss of dinitrogen to afford an alkyl anion 3, which undergoes rapid and irreversible acid-base reaction with solvent to give the alkane. Evidence for this high-energy intermediate was obtained by Taber via intramolecular trapping. The stereochemical outcome of this experiment was more consistent with an alkyl anion intermediate than the alternative possibility of an alkyl radical. The overall driving force of the reaction is the evolution of nitrogen gas from the reaction mixture.
==Modifications==
Many of the efforts devoted to improve the Wolff–Kishner reduction have focused on more efficient formation of the hydrazone intermediate by removal of water and a faster rate of hydrazone decomposition by increasing the reaction temperature. Some of the newer modifications provide more significant advances and allow for reactions under considerably milder conditions.
The table shows a summary of some of the modifications that have been developed since the initial discovery.
=== Huang Minlon modification ===
In 1946, Huang Minlon reported a modified procedure for the Wolff–Kishner reduction of ketones in which excess hydrazine and water were removed by distillation after hydrazone formation. The temperature-lowering effect of water that was produced in hydrazone formation usually resulted in long reaction times and harsh reaction conditions even if anhydrous hydrazine was used in the formation of the hydrazone. The modified procedure consists of refluxing the carbonyl compound in 85% hydrazine hydrate with three equivalents of sodium hydroxide followed by distillation of water and excess hydrazine and elevation of the temperature to 200 °C. Significantly reduced reaction times and improved yields can be obtained using this modification. Minlon&#x27;s original report described the reduction of &quot;β&quot;-(&quot;p&quot;-phenoxybenzoyl)propionic acid to &quot;γ&quot;-(&quot;p&quot;-phenoxyphenyl)butyric acid in 95% yield compared to 48% yield obtained by the traditional procedure.
=== Barton modification ===
Nine years after Huang Minlon’s first modification, Barton developed a method for the reduction of sterically hindered carbonyl groups. This method features rigorous exclusion of water, higher temperatures, and longer reaction times as well as sodium in diethylene glycol instead of alkoxide base. Under these conditions, some of the problems that normally arise with hindered ketones can be alleviated—for example, the C11-carbonyl group in the steroidal compound shown below was successfully reduced under Barton’s conditions while Huang–Minlon conditions failed to effect this transformation.
=== Cram modification ===
Slow addition of preformed hydrazones to potassium &quot;tert&quot;-butoxide in DMSO as reaction medium instead of glycols allows hydrocarbon formation to be conducted successfully at temperatures as low as 23 °C. Cram attributed the higher reactivity in DMSO as solvent to higher base strength of potassium &quot;tert&quot;-butoxide in this medium.
This modification has not been exploited to great extent in organic synthesis due to the necessity to isolate preformed hydrazone substrates and to add the hydrazone over several hours to the reaction mixture.

=== Henbest modification ===
Henbest extended Cram’s procedure by refluxing carbonyl hydrazones and potassium &quot;tert&quot;-butoxide in dry toluene. Slow addition of the hydrazone is not necessary and it was found that this procedure is better suited for carbonyl compounds prone to base-induced side reactions than Cram&#x27;s modification. It has for example been found that double bond migration in &quot;α,β&quot;-unsaturated enones and functional group elimination of certain &quot;α&quot;-substituted ketones are less likely to occur under Henbest&#x27;s conditions.

=== Caglioti reaction ===
Treatment of tosylhydrazones with hydride-donor reagents to obtain the corresponding alkanes is known as the Caglioti reaction. The initially reported reaction conditions have been modified and hydride donors such as sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, or catecholborane can reduce tosylhydrazones to hydrocarbons. The reaction proceeds under relatively mild conditions and can therefore tolerate a wider array of functional groups than the original procedure. Reductions with sodium cyanoborohydride as reducing agent can be conducted in the presence of esters, amides, cyano-, nitro- and chloro-substituents. Primary bromo- and iodo-substituents are displaced by nucleophilic hydride under these conditions.
Thereduction pathway is sensitive to the pH, the reducing agent, and the substrate. One possibility, occurring under acidic conditions, includes direct hydride attack of iminium ion 1 following prior protonation of the tosylhydrazone. The resulting tosylhydrazine derivative 2 subsequently undergoes elimination of &quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfinic acid and decomposes via a diimine intermediate 3 to the corresponding hydrocarbon. A slight variation of this mechanism occurs when tautomerization to the azohydrazone is facilitated by inductive effects. The transient azohydrazine 4 can then be reduced to the tosylhydrazine derivative 2 and furnish the decarbonylated product analogously to the first possibility. This mechanism operates when relatively weak hydride donors are used, such as sodium cyanoborohydride. It is known that these sodium cyanoborohydride is not strong enough to reduce imines, but can reduce iminium ions.

When stronger hydride donors are used, a different mechanism is operational, which avoids the use of acidic conditions. Hydride delivery occurs to give intermediate 5, followed by elimination of the metal sulfinate to give azo intermediate 6. This intermediate then decomposes, with loss of nitrogen gas, to give the reduced compound. When strongly basic hydride donors are used such as lithium aluminium hydride, then deprotonation of the tosyl hydrazone can occur before hydride delivery. Intermediate anion 7 can undergo hydride attack, eliminating a metal sulfinate to give azo anion 8. This readily decomposes to carbanion 9, which is protonated to give the reduced product. 
As with the parent Wolff–Kishner reduction, the decarbonylation reaction can often fail due to unsuccessful formation of the corresponding tosylhydrazone. This is common for sterically hindered ketones, as was the case for the cyclic amino ketone shown below.

Alternative methods of reduction can be employed when formation of the hydrazone fail, including thioketal reduction with Raney nickel or reaction with sodium triethylborohydride.

=== Deoxygenation of &quot;α,β&quot;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds ===
&quot;α,β&quot;-Unsaturated carbonyl tosylhydrazones can be converted into the corresponding alkenes with migration of the double bond. The reduction proceeds stereoselectively to furnish the &quot;E&quot; geometric isomer.

A very mild method uses one equivalent of catecholborane to reduce &quot;α,β&quot;-unsaturated tosylhydrazones.

The mechanism of NaBH3CN reduction of &quot;α,β&quot;-unsaturated tosylhydrazones has been examined using deuterium-labeling. Alkene formation is initiated by hydride reduction of the iminium ion followed by double bond migration and nitrogen extrusion which occur in a concerted manner.
Allylic diazene rearrangement as the final step in the reductive 1,3-transposition of &quot;α,β&quot;-unsaturated tosylhydrazones to the reduced alkenes can also be used to establish &quot;sp3&quot;-stereocenters from allylic diazenes containing prochiral stereocenters. The influence of the alkoxy stereocenter results in diastereoselective reduction of the &quot;α,β&quot;-unsaturated tosylhydrazone. The authors predicted that diastereoselective transfer of the diazene hydrogen to one face of the prochiral alkene could be enforced during the suprafacial rearrangement.
=== Myers modification ===
In 2004, Myers and coworkers developed a method for the preparation of &quot;N-tert&quot;-butyldimethylsilylhydrazones from carbonyl-containing compounds. These products can be used as a superior alternative to hydrazones in the transformation of ketones into alkanes. The advantages of this procedure are considerably milder reaction conditions and higher efficiency as well as operational convenience. The condensation of 1,2-bis(&quot;tert&quot;-butyldimethylsilyl)-hydrazine with aldehydes and ketones with Sc(OTf)3 as catalyst is rapid and efficient at ambient temperature. Formation and reduction of &quot;N-tert&quot;-butyldimethylsilylhydrazones can be conducted in a one pot procedure in high yield.

[This graphic is wrong. It should be TBS-N, not TBSO-N] 
The newly developed method was compared directly to the standard Huang–Minlon Wolff–Kishner reduction conditions (hydrazine hydrate, potassium hydroxide, diethylene glycol, 195 °C) for the steroidal ketone shown above. The product was obtained in 79% yield compared to 91% obtained from the reduction via an intermediate &quot;N-tert&quot;-butyldimethylsilylhydrazone.

==Side reactions==
The Wolff–Kishner reduction is not suitable for base–sensitive substrates and can under certain conditions be hampered by steric hindrance surrounding the carbonyl group. Some of the more common side-reactions are listed below.

=== Azine formation ===
A commonly encountered side-reaction in Wolff–Kishner reductions involves azine formation by reaction of hydrazone with the carbonyl compound. Formation of the ketone can be suppressed by vigorous exclusion of water during the reaction. Several of the presented procedures require isolation of the hydrazone compound prior to reduction. This can be complicated by further transformation of the product hydrazone to the corresponding hydrazine during product purification. Cram found that azine formation is favored by rapid addition of preformed hydrazones to potassium &quot;tert&quot;-butoxide in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide. 
=== Reduction of ketones to alcohols by sodium ethoxide ===
The second principal side reaction is the reduction of the ketone or aldehyde to the corresponding alcohol. After initial hydrolysis of the hydrazone, the free carbonyl derivative is reduced by alkoxide to the carbinol. In 1924, Eisenlohr reported that substantial amounts of hydroxydecalin were observed during the attempted Wolff–Kishner reduction of &quot;trans-β&quot;-decalone. In general, alcohol formation may be repressed by exclusion of water or by addition of excess hydrazine.

=== Kishner–Leonard elimination ===
Kishner noted during his initial investigations that in some instances, &quot;α&quot;-substitution of a carbonyl group can lead to elimination affording unsaturated hydrocarbons under typical reaction conditions. Leonard later further developed this reaction and investigated the influence of different &quot;α&quot;-substituents on the reaction outcome. He found that the amount of elimination increases with increasing steric bulk of the leaving group. Furthermore, &quot;α&quot;-dialkylamino-substituted ketones generally gave a mixture of reduction and elimination product whereas less basic leaving groups resulted in exclusive formation of the alkene product.

The fragmentation of &quot;α,β&quot;-epoxy ketones to allylic alcohols has been extended to a synthetically useful process and is known as the Wharton reaction.

=== Cleavage or rearrangement of strained rings adjacent to the carbonyl group ===
Grob rearrangement of strained rings adjacent to the carbonyl group has been observed by Erman and coworkers. During an attempted Wolff–Kishner reduction of &quot;trans-π&quot;-bromocamphor under Cram’s conditions, limonene was isolated as the only product.

Similarly, cleavage of strained rings adjacent to the carbonyl group can occur. When 9&quot;β&quot;,19-cyclo-5&quot;α&quot;-pregnane-3,11,20-trione 3,20-diethylene ketal was subjected to Huang–Minlon conditions, ring-enlargement was observed instead of formation of the 11-deoxo-compound.
==Applications in total synthesis==
The Wolff–Kishner reduction has been applied to the total synthesis of scopadulcic acid B, aspidospermidine and dysidiolide.
The Huang Minlon modification of the Wolff–Kishner reduction is one of the final steps in their synthesis of (±)-aspidospermidine. The carbonyl group that was reduced in the Wolff–Kishner reduction was essential for preceding steps in the synthesis. The tertiary amide was stable to the reaction conditions and reduced subsequently by lithium aluminum hydride.
Amides are usually not suitable substrates for the Wolff–Kishner reduction as demonstrated by the example above. Coe and coworkers found however that a twisted amide can be efficiently reduced under Wolff–Kishner conditions. The authors explain this observation with the stereoelectronic bias of the substrate which prevents “anti–Bredt” iminium ion formation and therefore favors ejection of alcohol and hydrazone formation. The amide functionality in this strained substrate can be considered as isolated amine and ketone functionalities as resonance stabilization is prevented due to torsional restrictions. The product was obtained in 68% overall yield in a two step procedure.
A tricyclic carbonyl compound was reduced using the Huang Minlon modification of the Wolff–Kishner reduction. Several attempts towards decarbonylation of tricyclic allylic acetate containing ketone failed and the acetate functionality had to be removed to allow Wolff–Kishner reduction. Finally, the allylic alcohol was installed via oxyplumbation.
The Wolff–Kishner reduction has also been used on kilogram scale for the synthesis of a functionalized imidazole substrate. Several alternative reduction methods were investigated, but all of the tested conditions remained unsuccessful. Safety concerns for a large scale Wolff–Kishner reduction were addressed and a highly optimized procedure afforded to product in good yield.

An allylic diazene rearrangement was used in the synthesis of the C21–C34 fragment of antascomicin B. The hydrazone was reduced selectively with catecholborane and excess reducing agent decomposed with sodium thiosulfate. The crude reaction product was then treated with sodium acetate and to give the 1,4-&quot;syn&quot; isomer.

<doc id="1216264" wikidata="Q1744396" url="?curid=1216264" title="Klaproth (crater)">
<text>Klaproth is an old lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon&#x27;s near side. Due to its location, this crater appears significantly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth. The southern rim of the crater is overlain by the similar-sized crater Casatus, and to the north-northeast lies Blancanus.

The outer rim of Klaproth has been deeply eroded, incised, and reshaped by a long history of bombardment. The rim to the north and east remains relatively circular, but the original rim along the western face has been overlain by satellite craters Klaproth G and Klaproth H, and other impacts. To the south the crater Casatus significantly intrudes into the interior floor. The remaining floor has been resurfaced by some material in the past, possibly fluidized ejecta or lava, leaving a level and nearly featureless surface that is marked only by a multitude of tiny craterlets. If this walled-plain once possessed a central peak, it no longer exists.

The crater was named after Martin Heinrich Klaproth, the German chemist and discoverer of Uranium.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Klaproth.

<text>Kopff is a lunar impact crater that lies along the eastern edge of the inner Mare Orientale impact basin, on the western limb of the Moon. In this position the crater is seen from on edge from the Earth, and its visibility is affected by libration. This situation makes it difficult to discern much detail about the crater unless it is viewed from orbit.

At one time this crater was considered to have formed due to volcanic activity, in contrast to most lunar craters which are considered to have been created through impacts. However it is more likely that the crater was formed by an impact against a surface that was still partly molten. This has left the crater with a sharp-edged, circular rim and a flat, dark-hued interior floor. Indeed, the albedo of the interior floor matches that of the lunar mare to the west. The southeast part of the floor is fractured with a series of narrow rilles. The floor along the northwest and northeast edges is more rugged, and these sections have escaped the lava that covered the remainder of the floor.

The crater was named after German astronomer August Kopff by the IAU in 1970.

<doc id="1216282" wikidata="Q4076805" url="?curid=1216282" title="Ballistic deflection transistor">
<text>Ballistic deflection transistors (BDTs) are electronic devices, developed since 2006, for high-speed integrated circuits, which is a set of circuits bounded on semiconductor material. They use electromagnetic forces instead of a logic gate, a device used to perform solely on specified inputs, to switch the forces of electrons. The unique design of this transistor includes individual electrons bouncing from wedge-shaped obstacles called deflectors. Initially accelerated by electric field, electrons are then guided on their respective paths by electromagnetic deflection. Electrons are therefore able to travel without being scattered by atoms or defects, thus resulting in improved speed and reduced power consumption.

== Purpose ==
A ballistic deflection transistor would be significant in acting as both a linear amplifier and a switch for current flow on electronic devices, which could be used to maintain digital logic and memory. A transistor switching speed is greatly affected by how fast charge carriers (typically, electrons) can cross from one region to the next. For this reason, researchers want to use ballistic conduction to improve the charge-carrier traveling time. The conventional MOS transistors also dissipate a lot of heat due inelastic collisions of electrons and must switch fast in order to reduce time intervals when the heat is generated, reducing their utility in linear circuits.

== Advantages ==
One advantage of the ballistic deflection transistor is that because such device will use very little power (implementing adiabatic circuit), it will produce less heat, and therefore be able to operate faster or with higher duty cycle. Thus, it will be easier to utilize in the variety of applications. This design will also reduce electrical noise that come from the electronic devices. Along with an increased speed, another advantage of the ballistic deflection transistor is that it will be usable in both aspects of linear amplifier and switch. Additionally, the ballistic deflection transistors are intrinsically small, because only small size allows to reduce the role of mechanisms responsible for inelastic scattering of electrons, normally dominating larger devices.

== Alternative approaches to ballistic conduction==
The goal of many laboratories around the world is creating switches and amplifiers that can operate faster than current technology. Specifically, electrons within the device should demonstrate a ballistic conduction behavior. Currently, the silicon MOS field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is the main and leading circuit. However, researchers predict that finding the ideal semiconductor will decrease the dimensions of the transistor, even below the sizes observed in the current generation of the silicon transistors, resulting in many undesirable effects lowering the performance of the MOS transistors. Since early 1960s, there has been research aiming for the ballistic conduction, which lead to modern metal-insulator-metal diodes, but it failed to produce a three-terminal switch. Another approach to ballistic conduction was to reduce scattering by lowering temperature, resulting in superconducting computing. The ballistic deflection transistor comprise the recent (in 2006) design been created by the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility, using a two-dimensional electron gas as the conducting medium.

An earlier vacuum-tube device called a &quot;beam deflection tube&quot; provided a similar functionality based on a similar principle.

<text>The Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC) is an international fellowship of 34 Confessional Lutheran church bodies.

The CELC was founded in 1993 in Oberwesel, Germany with an initial thirteen church bodies. Plenary sessions are held every three years. To date there have been ten plenary meetings (1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2017, 2021), with regional meetings held in the intervening years.

The CELC rejects the 1999 Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification signed between the Lutheran World Federation and the Catholic Church.

==History==
After the decline and dissolution of the Synodical Conference in the 1950s and 1960s, there was renewed interest for fellowship with other Lutheran church bodies. The Rev. Edgar Hoenecke called for a worldwide fellowship of Lutheran church bodies in the late 1960s.

Over the years, many people advocated for an international Lutheran organization and did much to help bring it about. However, three people are noted as having some of the biggest influence in helping to bring about a new international Lutheran organization: Pres. Gerhard Wilde of the Evangelisch-Lutherische Freikirche (ELFK), Pres. George Orvick of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS), and Prof. Wilbert Gawrisch of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS).

On April 27–29, 1993, the CELC was formed in Oberwesel, Germany with Lutheran church bodies from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America.

Today, the CELC consists of thirty-four Lutheran church bodies worldwide.

==Membership==

Member church bodies confess &quot;the canonical books of the Old and New Testament as the verbally inspired and inerrant Word of God and submit to this Word of God as the only infallible rule and authority in all matters of doctrine, faith, and life.&quot; They also accept &quot;the Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church contained in the Book of Concord of 1580, not in so far as, but because they are a correct exposition of the pure doctrine of the Word of God.&quot;

Members cannot be in fellowship with church bodies whose doctrine or practice deviate from the confessional standard of the CELC.

<text>Seeds of Peace is a peacebuilding and leadership development non-profit organization headquartered in New York City. It was founded in 1993. As its main program, the organization brings youth and educators from areas of conflict to its summer camp. It also provides local programming to support Seeds of Peace graduates, known as Seeds, once they return home. It is a non-political organization that teaches youth peace-making skills.

==History==

Seeds of Peace began in 1993 as an idea of the American journalist John Wallach. At a state dinner with politicians from Israel, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority, Wallach proposed that they bring 15 youngsters from each of their respective countries to a new camp he was founding in Maine. These 46, including 3 Americans, ranging in age from 13 to 18, comprised the first session of the &quot;Seeds of Peace Camp,&quot; founded on the site of the former Camp Powhatan in Otisfield, Maine.

The campers from 1993 were later present at the signing ceremony of the Declaration of Principles (better known as the Oslo Accords) in Washington, D.C. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat were photographed holding Seeds of Peace T-shirts.

From its start in 1993 through 2010, Seeds says that over 4,000 children have attended the camp. Children have attended from a wide variety of countries, with Seeds offices in Amman, Cairo, Gaza, Jerusalem, Kabul, Lahore, Mumbai, Otisfield, Ramallah, and Tel Aviv as of 2010.

==Organization==
John Wallach&#x27;s vision focused on leaders of the next generation. The need to establish its legitimacy at home inspired the creation of the Delegation Leaders Program. Delegation Leaders are educators from the countries in conflict; they take part in the selection and orientation of Seeds at home. They accompany the Seeds to and from camp. While at camp, participants speak English as the common language of the camp.

The organization supports returning Seeds with year-round programming, including dialogue sessions, cross-cultural visits, educational and leadership development workshops, and outreach events.

In 2001, Seeds of Peace expanded to South Asia, bringing together conflicting sides from Afghanistan, India and Pakistan.

===Camper selection process===
The selection takes about half a year, with most of the participants being 14–16 years old. Typically, applicants to Seeds of Peace apply through the school systems in their home countries. Applicants must demonstrate proficiency in English, leadership skills, and local politics. They are selected on the basis of interviews and written essays. Many of the first-time campers are chosen by the Ministries of Education or other government agencies in their respective countries.

===Leadership===
John Wallach, the founder of the organization, also served as its president until his death in 2002. He was succeeded by former State Department official Aaron David Miller, who left the job early in 2006. Later, Janet Wallach, wife of John Wallach, was named president emeritus, and Steven Flanders served for a time as the executive officer in charge. Starting in the spring of 2007, Nicolla Hewitt served briefly as president, until her departure in 2008. Leslie Adelson Lewin served as director from the fall of 2009 to 2019. In 2020, the organization announced Fr. Josh Thomas as its new Executive Director.

===Offices===
The organization&#x27;s U.S. headquarters are located in New York City. Seeds of Peace has also opened central offices in Jerusalem and smaller offices in Amman, Cairo, Gaza, Kabul, Lahore, Mumbai, Otisfield, Ramallah, and Tel Aviv as of 2010. Programs for people in their 20s are expanding.

==Life after camp==
Approximately 350 new Seeds graduate from Seeds of Peace every summer. After camp, the organization runs year-round regional programs for graduates in their home countries that focus on &quot;four of the most important assets and abilities that leaders in conflict regions need to create meaningful change: strong relationships across lines of conflict; a sophisticated understanding of core conflict issues; practical skills in communication, critical thinking, and change-making; and the ability to take action on behalf of peace.&quot; Author John Wallach himself dedicated his book, &quot;The Enemy Has a Face: The Seeds of Peace Experience&quot;, to the organization.

===&quot;The Olive Branch&quot;===
From 1996 to 2012, the organization&#x27;s graduates published a magazine, &quot;The Olive Branch&quot;, that summed up their activities over a period of several months. It included reports, poetry, essays, and photos.

=== Alumni ===

==== Asel Asleh ====
On October 2, 2000, Asel Asleh, an Israeli Arab and graduate of the program, was killed by Israeli security forces during a demonstration. He was wearing the Seeds of Peace T-shirt at the time of the shooting and was subsequently buried in it.

Gracie Abrams

American singer-songwriter Gracie Abrams attended the program in 2016. The pop artist released a statement to social media referencing her time in the camp in the wake of the Israel-Hamas War.

==Criticism==
In a fantasy-theme analysis of Seeds of Peace publications, Engstrom (2007) argues that organizations like Seeds of Peace unknowingly participate in sustaining the conflicts they seek to eliminate by rhetorically promoting peace, which places the burden of ending the conflict on future generations. Politicians and other stakeholders in the current conflict use their support for Seeds of Peace as a signal of their commitment to peace while remaining committed to military engagement.

== Hands of Peace ==
In 2024, Hands of Peace, a smaller U.S.-based nonprofit that held summer programs for Israeli, Palestinian and American youth closed down and merged with Seeds of Peace.

A notable alum of the program is Naama Levy, one of the Israeli soldiers taken captive by Hamas when the Palestinian militant group stormed the Nahal Oz Army Base on October 7, 2023 and released on 25 January 2025 after 477 days in captivity.

<text>Gilbert Juma Deya () is a stonemason turned evangelist who lived in Britain from the mid-1990s until 2017, when he was extradited to Kenya to face charges of stealing five children between 1999 and 2004. He was acquitted of the charges in 2023.

His organization, Gilbert Deya Ministries, claims that Deya is able to help infertile women to conceive through the power of prayer.

==Background==
Deya was born in the morning of 2 February 1937 in Juja, Kiambu County, outside of Nairobi and was the eleventh child in a family of fifteen children. He belongs to Luo tribe, and his name &quot;Juma&quot; means Sunday, which is the day he was born. His father, Samuel Oyanda Deya was a sisal plantations worker from Bondo working in Juja. His parents were never meant to be a couple because his mother, Monica Nono Deya, declined the arranged marriage with his father.

He attended primary school but the school preacher dropped out because of bullying and poverty. He started preaching Jinja, Kampala, in Uganda, where he beat up a woman for hitting the children of his sister and worked there as a porter.

He married his 14-year-old wife, Mary Anyango, on 27 December 1958 when he was 21. They gave birth to fifteen children in total. He started the &quot;Salvation of Jesus Christ Church&quot; in 1976.

He was ordained by the United Evangelical Church of Kenya and styles himself &quot;Archbishop&quot;. He was an evangelist in Kenya in the late 1980s to early 1990s, but moved to the UK, establishing Gilbert Deya Ministries in 1997. The ministry at its peak activity had church services at rented and owned buildings in Liverpool, London, Birmingham, Nottingham, Luton, Reading, Manchester and Sheffield. In 2006 it acquired a building and planning permission in Leeds. The church claimed to be &quot;the fastest growing Ministry in the UK and worldwide&quot;.

In 2013 Deya was arrested in the UK and charged with raping and attempting to rape a woman and sexually assaulting a teenage girl. He was found not guilty on all counts in 2014.

The church was placed under its formal investigations by the Charity Commission in 2004 and again in 2016, and the commission appointed Interim Managers in March 2021 to manage the affairs of the charity.

==&#x27;Miracle Babies&#x27; and child trafficking==
The Gilbert Deya Ministries claimed that Deya&#x27;s powers allow him to be able to cause infertile women to become pregnant. Deya claimed that &quot;through the power of prayer and the Lord Jesus&quot; he has helped sterile women give birth. In the UK, one woman was claimed to have had three children in less than a year. The women travelled to Kenya in order to &quot;give birth&quot;. On her return a suspicious GP alerted the local social services department, leading to court proceedings to protect the babies.
Deya&#x27;s wife, Eddah (also known as Mary Deya), was arrested during November 2004 in Nairobi and charged with stealing children. Ten children, none of whom had any genetic connection to the Deya family, were found at Deya&#x27;s House. Twenty babies were placed in foster care in Kenya after DNA tests showed they had no connection to their alleged mothers.
Rose Atieno Kiserem, a former pastor with Deya&#x27;s ministry was jailed along with Mrs. Deya. Upon her release from jail, Kiserem confessed that the &#x27;miracle babies&#x27; were &quot;a hoax created by the Deyas and their accomplices to deceive me and other God-fearing people.&quot;

Deya had a warrant out for his arrest in Kenya for the trafficking of babies out of the country. The Kenyan police alleged that the ministry is a baby-snatching ring, and they petitioned for his extradition from the UK. Deya sought political asylum from his base in Glasgow. He was arrested by police at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in 2006.

In November 2004 the High Court in the UK ruled that a &#x27;miracle baby&#x27; in London was the victim of child trafficking, and that the supposed miracle displayed was a ruse in order to generate funds from a &quot;deceived congregation&quot;. Justice Ryder ruled that in order to maintain the illusion of a genuine birth, the child&#x27;s &#x27;mother&#x27; was seriously assaulted &quot;and a live child who had been born to another family was presented to her as her child.&quot; He also ruled that &quot;[the baby&#x27;s] birth as described was a falsehood not a miracle.&quot;

On 13 December 2006, Deya was arrested in London by the Metropolitan Police. A police spokesman said Gilbert Deya was detained under an arrest warrant issued by Kenyan authorities, who had charged him with child abduction and trafficking. He was ordered by a court on 8 November 2007, to be extradited from the UK to Kenya to face five counts of child stealing.

Deya appealed against extradition on the grounds that he might face torture in Kenya, but in late 2008 his case was rejected by the High Court and leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused. It was reported in April 2010 that Deya was still in England and David Lammy, Deya&#x27;s MP, enquired of the government why he had not yet been extradited. Lammy was concerned that justice was being denied to several of his constituents who were victims of the trafficked babies fraud. The Home Office responded that it was still considering representations from Deya&#x27;s solicitors that sending him to Kenya would breach his human rights.

In January 2011, a court in Kenya convicted Mary Deya of stealing a baby from Kenyatta National Hospital in 2005 and making a false statement that she had given birth to the baby in question. She was later acquitted on separate charges of obtaining registration for five children irregularly.

In September 2011, news reports indicated that all avenues of appeal had been exhausted and Deya would soon be extradited to Kenya.

The London Evening Standard reported on 21 October 2016 that Deya had applied for a judicial review of the decision to extradite him.

On 12 July 2017, Premier Christian Media reported that the High Court had refused Deya&#x27;s application for a judicial review and that he would be extradited.

On 3 August 2017, Deya was extradited from the UK to Kenya to face child trafficking charges. He was immediately arraigned in court for child trafficking offences. He subsequently divorced his wife, supposedly because her involvement in baby theft had tarnished his reputation.

In April 2020, Deya&#x27;s hearing was delayed because of COVID-19. However, the case resumed in early 2021. Deya&#x27;s legal team launched a bid to block prosecutors from calling several witnesses from abroad whose testimonies had been halted because of COVID-19. However, Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi denied the motion. In May 2023, Deya gave testimony in which he denied the charges against him.

Local press reported that judgment was passed by the court in Nairobi on 29 June 2023. Deya was acquitted on all charges based on a lack of evidence. Magistrate Robison Ondieki ruled that the prosecution had &quot;failed to establish circumstantial evidence&quot;. Following the verdict, Deya suggested that he would seek to return to the UK.

<text>Greatest Hits Radio North East is an Independent Local Radio station, based in Newcastle, England, owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Greatest Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to North East England.

==History==


Great North Radio (also known as G.N.R) was formed in March 1989 using the AM frequencies of Metro Radio and Radio Tees. This happened after the Metro Radio Group decided to split the FM and AM frequencies up.

GNR&#x27;s output consisted of mellow music from the 1950s through to the 1980s, including current hits that fitted the format. There were also specialist programmes each evening, including Country Music, Jazz, and Classical.

In 1996, Emap bought Metro Radio and at the start of 1997, Emap decided to scrap Great North Radio and replaced it with local stations under the brand name of &quot;Magic&quot;, with a new format of Hot Adult Contemporary music. Magic 1152 launched on 19 February 1998.

In December 2001, Emap decided that it was more economical for the Magic network to share off-peak programmes and in line with the other Magic AM stations began networking between 10am-2pm, and 7pm-6am. During these hours it was simply known as Magic, although there were local commercial breaks, and local news on the hour.

In January 2003, after a sharp decline in listening, the station ceased networking with the London station, Magic 105.4, and a regional northern network was created with Manchester&#x27;s Magic 1152 at the hub at the weekend and the Newcastle station as the hub during the week. This arrangement remained until 2006, when all network programmes were broadcast from Newcastle. During networked hours, local adverts are aired, as well as a local news summary on the hour during the day. IRN is taken in the evening and overnight.

From July 2006, more networking was introduced across the Northern Magic AM network leaving just the legal minimum of 4 hours a day of programming - the breakfast show - presented from the local studios. All other programming was networked from Newcastle however some is also produced in Manchester and now London.

On 4 March 2013, the one remaining local show - weekday breakfast - became a syndicated regional programme as on this day the programme, presented by Anna Foster, started broadcasting on Teesside sister station Magic 1170. The regional breakfast show was axed in December 2014 ahead of the launch of Metro 2 and all programming is networked with the other Bauer AM stations in the North although local news, weather and travel continue to be broadcast as opt-outs during the day.

On 7 January 2019, Metro 2 rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio North East.

On 12 November 2023, it was announced that the station would be closed on medium wave before the end of the year, but would continue on DAB.

==Programming==
The station carries primarily a schedule of networked programming, produced and broadcast from Bauer&#x27;s Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Glasgow studios, and from Bauer&#x27;s Golden Square headquarters in Soho.

Regional programming consisted of &quot;Night Owls&quot; with Alan Robson, which was produced and broadcast from Bauer&#x27;s Newcastle studios, airing each Sunday night until April 2022. This was syndicated with the sister station in Teesside.

===News===
Bauer’s Newcastle newsroom broadcasts local news bulletins during some hours. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside traffic bulletins. National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried at other times.

The local news team in Newcastle also produces bulletins for Greatest Hits Radio Teesside.

<doc id="1216318" wikidata="Q4800961" url="?curid=1216318" title="Articulation (sociology)">
<text>In sociology, articulation labels the process by which particular classes appropriate cultural forms and practices for their own use. The term appears to have originated from the work of Antonio Gramsci, specifically from his conception of superstructure. Chantal Mouffe, Stuart Hall, and others have adopted or used it.

Articulation (expression) theorizes the relationship between components of social formation or relationship between cultural and political economy. In this theory, cultural forms and practices (Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s &quot;superstructure&quot; and Richard Middleton&#x27;s &quot;instance&quot; or &quot;level of practice&quot;) have relative autonomy; socio-economic structures of power do not determine them, but rather they relate to them. &quot;The theory of articulation recognizes the complexity of cultural fields. It preserves a relative autonomy for cultural and ideological elements ... but also insists that those combinatory patterns that are actually constructed do mediate deep, objective patterns in the socio-economic formation, and that the mediation takes place in &quot;struggle&quot;: the classes fight to articulate together constituents of the cultural repe[r]toire in particular ways so that they are organized in terms of principles or sets of values determined by the position and interests of the class in the prevailing mode of production.&quot;

This is because &quot;the relationship between actual culture...on the one hand, and economically determined factors such as class position, on the other, is always problematical, incomplete, and the object of ideological work and struggle. ... Cultural relationships and cultural change are thus not predetermined; rather they are the product of negotiation, imposition, resistance, transformation, and so on...Thus particular cultural forms and practices cannot be attached mechanically or even paradigmatically to particular classes; nor, even, can particular interpretations, valuations, and uses of a single form or practice. In Stuart Hall&#x27;s words (1981: 238), &#x27;there are no wholly separate &quot;cultures&quot;...attached, in a relation of historical fixity, to specific &quot;whole&quot; classes&#x27;. However, &quot;while elements of culture are not directly, eternally, or exclusively tied to specific economically determined factors such as class position, they &quot;are&quot; determined in the final instance by such factors, through the operation of articulating principles which &quot;are&quot; tied to class position&quot;.

Articulating principles &quot;operate by combining existing elements into new patterns or by attaching new connotations to them&quot;. Examples of these processes in musical culture include the re-use of elements of bourgeois marches in labor anthems or the assimilation of liberated (in the Marcusian sense) countercultural 1960s rock into a tradition of bourgeois bohemianism and the combination of elements of black and white working-class music with elements of art music that created countercultural 1960s rock.

Some scholars may prefer the theory of articulation, where &quot;class does not coincide with the sign community&quot;, to the theory of homology, where class does coincide with the sign community and where economic forces determine the superstructure. However, &quot;it seems likely that some signifying structures are more easily articulated to the interests of one group than are some others&quot; and cross-connotation, &quot;when two or more different elements are made to connote, symbolize, or evoke each other&quot;, can set up &quot;particularly strong articulative relationships&quot;. For example: Elvis Presley&#x27;s linking of elements of &quot;youth rebellion, working-class &#x27;earthiness&#x27;, and ethnic &#x27;roots&#x27;, each of which can evoke the others, all of which were articulated together, however briefly, by a moment of popular self-assertion&quot;.

<doc id="1216319" wikidata="Q7084980" url="?curid=1216319" title="Old Skull">
<text>Old Skull was an American punk rock novelty band that formed in Madison, Wisconsin in the late 1980s. The band was started by ten-year-old J.P. (Jean-Paul) Toulon and his nine-year-old brother, Jamie Toulon, with encouragement from their father Vern Toulon, a longtime member of the Madison punk scene who had spent time in New York City, where he was a guitarist for the industrial band Missing Foundation.

==History==
===Formation, &quot;Get Outta School&quot;===
The original lineup featured J.P. on guitar and Jamie on keyboards and came together after the brothers began playing with their father&#x27;s instruments. After teaching the boys some basic chords, he added a drum machine and the band was formed. Soon after, ten-year-old Jesse Collins-Davies joined the band on drums. Collins-Davies was the stepson of Robin Davies, a member of the Madison-based punk band the Tar Babies, who had previously recorded for SST Records. The group adapted their name from the punk rock band Live Skull, who had stayed at the Toulon house after a show in Madison. After hearing a demo tape the band recorded, Mojo Nixon approached his label, Restless Records, and persuaded them to sign Old Skull to a record deal. In 1989, Restless Records released Old Skull&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Get Outta School&quot;. Produced by both Vern Toulon and Robin Davies and engineered by future Garbage member Steve Marker, &quot;Get Outta School&quot; dealt with such wide-ranging topics as skateboarding, hot dogs, homelessness and the AIDS virus. Due to the non-childlike subject matter in many of the songs, rumors persisted that Vern Toulon was actually ghostwriting much, if not all of the band&#x27;s material. Critics described the album as hilarious, unlistenable, and torturous, though most agreed that it wasn&#x27;t all that bad for a group of nine-year-olds. The band also began opening for national acts such as Gwar, The Flaming Lips and Sonic Youth. The novelty of the act drew media attention from television shows like &quot;A Current Affair&quot; and publications such as &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;. MTV also gave the band some minor airplay. A music video was released for the song &quot;Homeless&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Get Outta School&quot;, Jesse Collins-Davies left the band and was replaced by twelve-year-old Graham Lindsey. Lindsey performed with the band for two years before the band permanently broke up.

===New lineup, &quot;C.I.A. Drug Fest&quot;===
In 1992, the Toulon brothers re-formed Old Skull without Lindsey. J.P. Toulon switched to drums, while Jamie, now known as Spike, handled bass and some lead vocals. The Toulons were joined by brothers Josh and Chris Scott on guitars and vocals respectively. This lineup recorded &quot;C.I.A. Drug Fest&quot;, once again produced by Vern Toulon and released through Restless, and released during that year. This record was considerably more musical than their debut and executed competently with relative cohesion. A music video was released for the song &quot;Pizza Man&quot;. A short tour of Japan followed before the act disbanded permanently in 1993.

===2005 reunion===
In August 2005, the Toulon brothers, now in their mid-20s, reunited Old Skull for a one time show at CBGB&#x27;s as an opening act for The Exploited, with J.P. returning to vocals and Jamie playing guitar. They were joined onstage by Rik Smart, Mike House and John McClellan of the New York squat punk music scene.

===Adult life and death===
J.P. Toulon moved to New York City where he began playing with Planned Collapse, a crust punk band based out of C-Squat, a communal squat located in the East Village of Manhattan. In early 2010, he served jail time in Madison, Wisconsin, and later moved on to a drug rehab facility where he had apparently managed to overcome his drug addiction. J.P. Toulon died on November 13, 2010, his brother Jamie&#x27;s birthday. He had been living in Minneapolis with his son at the time of his death. While the cause of death has never been made public, Toulon had previously been hospitalized for pancreatitis several times in the months prior to his death. A memorial service was held for Toulon at C-Squat on November 21, 2010.

Jamie Toulon went on to play guitar for the Milwaukee band Doomsday Cauldron. Like his brother, he later moved to New York City and played in a punk band named Apox, which released an album titled &quot;Prevalence&quot; in 1998. He was also an original member of Star Fucking Hipsters, a side project of Leftöver Crack member, Stza. Jamie also joined his brother in Planned Collapse until both brothers left the band. Clay Pigeon, a WFMU DJ who often records conversations with random NYC street people, included a fifteen-minute interview with Jamie on his August 26, 2010, broadcast. In the interview, Jamie revealed that he was living on the streets of New York City and was battling an ongoing drug addiction. Jamie committed suicide in Lynchburg, Virginia on June 10, 2011, seven months after the death of his brother.

Jesse Collins-Davies, using the name DJ Jesse Collins, continued to perform as part of the drum and bass/jungle music scene of Madison. He also has a career as an abstract artist, primarily working in the medium of watercolor on glass.

Graham Lindsey began a solo career as an alternative country artist. He released his first album, &quot;Famous Anonymous Wilderness&quot;, in 2003. A second album, &quot;Hell Under The Skullbones&quot;, followed in 2006. In 2008 he released &quot;The Mine EP&quot; and his third full-length album, &quot;We Are All Alone In This Together&quot;. A compilation album of rarities titled, &quot;Digging Up Birds: A Collection of Rarities &amp; Others&quot; was released in 2014. Four of Lindsey&#x27;s songs were used in the direct-to-DVD film, &quot;Fairview St.&quot;, released in 2009. Lindsey is also a backup musician for The Perreze Farm, a band formed by Lindsey&#x27;s drummer, Joe Perreze. They released their debut EP, &quot;Songs For The Birds&quot;, on May 26, 2009.

Vern Toulon, producer and father to the Toulon brothers, went on to appear in the Madison-based documentary film &quot;Streets Without Cars&quot; before his death on May 31, 2001, at the age of 46. Several reports indicate that he had resorted to panhandling in the years before his death. The boys&#x27; parents had divorced early in the band&#x27;s career. Several years after the divorce, the boys&#x27; mother died in a train accident.

==Parody==
Months before the 2005 reunion, a person named &quot;P.J.&quot; called into the radio station WFMU in New Jersey, claiming to be a former member of Old Skull. &quot;P.J.&quot; stated that he was re-forming Old Skull as a jazz fusion band without the input of any of the other former members. The call turned out to be an elaborate comedy sketch set up by Tom Scharpling, a supervising producer and writer for the &quot;Monk&quot; television series, and Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster, for their radio show, &quot;The Best Show on WFMU&quot;. The sketch also became available on their &quot;Hippy Justice&quot; CD. Coincidentally, the &quot;Hippy Justice&quot; CD was released at approximately the same time that the real reunion at CBGB&#x27;s took place.

Finestra was born to Italian immigrants in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and initially attended a seminary college for two years to become a Catholic priest before transferring to Penn State University, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He earned his BA in 1971.

After a stint as an Off-Broadway actor, Finestra turned to writing for the likes of Johnny Cash (for one of Cash&#x27;s summer series) and Steve Martin. Finestra&#x27;s big break came when he began writing for &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; in 1984, where he would remain until 1990, leaving the show as supervising producer. Finestra received two Emmy nominations as one of the producers of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and another Emmy nomination for co-writing an episode of the hit series. He also did three guest star appearances on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (episodes 4.12, 6.2 and 6.14).

In 1991, Finestra became a writer and co-executive producer for &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, capacities he filled until the series&#x27; end in 1999. His work on the sitcom would land three Emmy and two Golden Globe nominations for him.

Finestra was honored as a Distinguished Alumnus of Penn State in 1998. Penn State named an off campus video editing lab, The Carmen Finestra Digital Editing Lab, in his honor at Innovation Park, an off site technology hub on the University Park campus.

<text>Charles Chi-tat Ng (born Ng Chi-tat) (; born 24 December 1960) is a convicted Hong Kong-born serial killer who committed numerous crimes in the United States. He is believed to have raped, tortured, and murdered between eleven and twenty-five victims with his accomplice Leonard Lake at Lake&#x27;s cabin in Calaveras County, California, 60 miles (96 km) from Sacramento, between 1983 and 1985. After his arrest and imprisonment in Canada on robbery and weapons charges, followed by a lengthy dispute between Canada and the U.S., Ng was extradited to California, tried, and convicted of eleven murders. He is currently on death row at California Medical Facility.

==Early life==
Charles Ng was born as Ng Chi-tat in British Hong Kong, the youngest of three children and only son of a wealthy Hongkonger executive and his wife. As a child, Ng was harshly disciplined and abused by his father.

As a teenager, he was described as a troubled loner and was expelled from several schools. After his arrest for shoplifting at age 15, he went, at his father&#x27;s insistence, to Bentham Grammar School, a boarding school in North Yorkshire, England. Not long after arriving, Ng was expelled for stealing from other students and returned to Hong Kong.

Ng moved to the United States on a student visa in 1978 and studied biology at the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, California. He dropped out after one semester. Soon after, he was involved in a hit and run accident, and to avoid prosecution he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps.

==U.S. Marine Corps==
Ng joined the Marines in October 1979 with the help, he claimed, of a recruiting sergeant and false documents attesting to his birthplace as Bloomington, Indiana. After less than a year of service, he was arrested by military police for stealing automatic weapons from the Kaneohe Bay base armory. Facing court-martial, Ng escaped custody in 1980 and made his way back to northern California, where he met Leonard Lake.
In 1982, federal authorities raided the mobile home Ng and Lake shared in Ukiah, seizing a large stash of illegal weapons and explosives. Lake was released on bond, but he jumped bail and hid at a remote cabin owned by his wife, Claralyn Balazs, in Wilseyville, a community in Calaveras County located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Ng was captured and returned to Marine custody and pleaded guilty to the charges of theft and desertion. Under the terms of this plea deal, he was paroled and dishonorably discharged in 1984 after serving eighteen months in the military stockade at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

== Murders ==
After his release from Leavenworth, Ng rejoined Lake, who was still living at the Wilseyville cabin. By then, Lake and Balazs had divorced but remained on good terms. Next to the cabin, Lake had built a structure described in his journals as a &quot;dungeon.&quot; Before Ng&#x27;s arrival, Lake is believed to have already murdered his brother Donald, whom he lured to the cabin and shot in his sleep in 1983, and his friend and best man Charles Gunnar. Gunnar&#x27;s body was unearthed from the Wilseyville property in 1992.

Over the next year, Lake and Ng began a pattern of kidnapping and murder of men, women, and children. According to court records, they killed the men and infants immediately, whereas they subjected women to a period of enslavement, rape, and torture before killing them.

In July 1984, an Asian American man broke into and robbed the apartment of Don Giulietti, a San Francisco disc jockey, and his roommate, Richard Carrazza, shooting both men in the process. Giulietti died in the attack, but Carrazza, the only known survivor victim of either Lake or Ng, later identified Ng as his assailant. Soon afterward, Ng managed to get a job at a Bay Area moving company. The duo&#x27;s rampage would have gone on longer were it not for Ng&#x27;s kleptomania. On June 2, 1985, Lake and Ng entered the South City Lumber Store in South San Francisco. An employee observed Ng stealing a $75 vise and called the police. When confronted by the employee, Ng tossed the vise into the trunk of a 1980 Honda Prelude in the parking lot, then fled on foot. The police arrived minutes later. An officer looked into the car&#x27;s trunk and saw the stolen vise along with a .22 caliber pistol equipped with an illegal silencer. Lake asserted there was a misunderstanding and that he had paid for the vise; he was arrested for possessing the illegally modified weapon.

The arresting officer noticed that Lake bore no resemblance to the photo on his California driver&#x27;s license, which bore the name of Robin Scott Stapley, a San Diego man reported missing by his family several weeks earlier. The Honda was registered to Paul Cosner, who disappeared from San Francisco on November 2, 1984, after leaving his apartment to show the car to someone interested in purchasing it. The car&#x27;s license plate was registered to yet another missing person, Lonnie Bond, of Wilseyville. The gun was registered to Stapley. While in custody, Lake admitted his real identity and that of his accomplice, Ng. He then asked for a pencil, a piece of paper, and a glass of water. Left alone in an interrogation room, Lake wrote a note to his ex-wife, then swallowed a cyanide capsule he had hidden in his jacket. Lake was rushed to nearby Kaiser Hospital. He was pronounced dead on June 6.

Upon further examination of the Honda Prelude, investigators found a bullet hole in the car&#x27;s roof, along with blood spatter, a stun gun, and several unspent bullets. Under the passenger seat, a utility bill was found in the name of Lake&#x27;s ex-wife, Claralyn Balazs, with a Wilseyville address. On June 4, San Francisco Police detectives and Calaveras County Sheriffs investigators searched the Wilseyville cabin with Balazs&#x27;s permission. In one of the bedrooms, they discovered video equipment belonging to Harvey Dubs, who had vanished from his San Francisco apartment along with his wife Deborah, and their infant son, Sean, in July 1984.

Investigators also found vehicles belonging to Bond and Stapley parked on the property. Bond had rented a house just 50 yards from Lake&#x27;s cabin with his girlfriend Brenda O&#x27;Connor and their infant son. Stapley, a friend of Bond&#x27;s, had also been staying at the house. Detectives found the house empty and the rent unpaid for several months. Next to the driveway stood a cinder-block bunker that Lake had constructed. Inside the bunker, investigators found a copy of &quot;The Collector&quot; as well as tools, handcuffs, women&#x27;s clothing, and makeup. In his teenage years, Lake had read a 1963 John Fowles novel called &quot;The Collector&quot;, which tells the story of a man who captures a woman (named Miranda) and keeps her as a slave in the hopes she would eventually fall in love with him. Lake was fascinated by this novel, and used the book as inspiration for what he called &quot;Operation Miranda&quot;. Posted on a wall was a list of typewritten rules for female captives to follow, along with pictures of 21 women, some of them nude. Behind one wall, through a hidden door, was a tiny windowless cell with a small mattress and a bucket that may have been used as a toilet. Investigators believed that women had been held in the cell as Lake&#x27;s prisoners.

In a makeshift burial site nearby, police unearthed roughly 45 pounds of burned and crushed human bone fragments, corresponding to a minimum of 11 bodies.

In addition to Bond, O&#x27;Connor, the Dubs, and their children, other victims included Paul Cosner, Randy Jacobsen, Mike Carroll, Kathy Allen, Jeff Gerald, Robin Stapley, Clifford Peranteau, relatives and friends who came looking for Bond and O&#x27;Connor, and two gay men.

They also found a hand-drawn &quot;treasure map&quot;, leading them to two buried five-gallon buckets. One contained envelopes with names and victims&#x27; identifications, suggesting that the total number of victims might have been as high as 25. In the other bucket were Lake&#x27;s handwritten journals for the years 1983 and 1984, and two videotapes documenting the torture of two of their victims. On one of the tapes, labeled &quot;M-Ladies&quot;, Charles Ng is seen telling victim Brenda O&#x27;Connor, as he cuts her shirt off with a knife, &quot;You can cry and stuff, like the rest of them, but it won&#x27;t do any good. We are pretty … cold-hearted, so to speak.&quot; In another part of the tape, Kathy Allen is seen seated in a chair, with Leonard Lake warning her, &quot;If you don&#x27;t go along with us, we&#x27;ll probably take you into the bed, tie you down, rape you, shoot you, and bury you.&quot; In the other, Deborah Dubs is shown being assaulted so severely that she &quot;could not have survived&quot;.

After fleeing the lumber yard, Ng arrived at Balazs&#x27;s residence and told her that he had to leave town immediately. Balazs drove him to San Francisco International Airport where he boarded a flight to Chicago, using the alias &quot;Mike Kimoto&quot;. A friend of Ng drove him from Chicago to Detroit, and across the border into Canada. He eventually settled in Calgary, Alberta, where he lived undetected in a lean-to in Fish Creek Provincial Park until he was arrested by the Calgary Police Service on July 6, 1985, after shooting security guard Sean Doyle in the hand while resisting arrest for stealing a can of salmon from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Department Store. He was charged, and, in December 1985, convicted of shoplifting, assault with a weapon, and possession of a concealed firearm, and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. After serving his sentence, he remained incarcerated pending an extradition request from California authorities.

Ng fought a protracted legal battle against extradition on the grounds that Canada, which did not have the death penalty for most offenses, would be violating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by permitting him to stand trial in California for capital murder. A &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition and an Alberta Court of Appeal appeal were both denied. On September 26, 1991, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled by a vote of 4 to 3 against him. According to former Alberta prosecutor Scott Newark, Canada deported Ng to California 18 minutes after the ruling.

==Murder trial==
In Calaveras County, Ng was indicted on twelve counts of first-degree murder. After a change of venue to Orange County, he initiated a protracted series of pretrial motions. He sued the state over his temporary detainment at Folsom Prison, where he was caught hiding maps, fake IDs, and other escape paraphernalia, and filed challenges against four of the judges assigned to his case. He lodged a long series of complaints regarding the strength of his eyeglasses, the temperature of his food, and his right to practice origami in his jail cell.

Ng went through a total of 10 attorneys, some of whom ended up defending him a second time. He also filed a malpractice suit against several of the attorneys, citing incompetent representation. After claiming that he had lost trust and confidence in all of his lawyers, he was allowed to represent himself, which delayed the trial another year while he researched applicable laws. His trial finally began in October 1998, seven years after his extradition from Canada.

Balazs cooperated with investigators and received legal immunity from prosecution. Court records stated that Balazs turned over weapons and other material to authorities during the investigation. Balazs was called a key witness in Ng&#x27;s trial, but Ng&#x27;s lawyer, William Kelley, in a surprise move, dismissed Balazs without asking any questions. Balazs was expected to shed light on what happened inside the mountain cabin that her parents owned. Kelley later declined to explain his actions.

Despite the video evidence and information in Lake&#x27;s voluminous diaries, Ng maintained that he was merely an observer and that Lake planned and committed all of the kidnappings, rapes, and murders unassisted. He further maintained that he was dependent upon Lake for direction, that the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father was a mitigating factor, and that his good behavior behind bars showed that he should be imprisoned for life rather than executed.

Psychiatrist Stuart Grassian testified that Ng had dependent personality disorder, but admitted under cross-examination that he had not viewed the tapes that showed Ng participating in the crimes. Clinical psychologist Abraham Nievod agreed with the diagnosis of dependent personality disorder and opined that Ng&#x27;s behavior in the tapes indicated that he was attempting to &quot;mirror&quot; and please Lake. Four correctional officers, two sheriff&#x27;s deputies, a prison library employee, and a prison counselor all testified that Ng was a model prisoner. Four former Marines who had known Ng while serving in the Marine Corps testified that he was quiet and well-behaved. Ng&#x27;s parents testified about his troubled childhood and expressed remorse for their son&#x27;s actions.

Ng insisted on taking the stand in his own defense, which allowed prosecutors to introduce additional evidence that helped define Ng&#x27;s role in all aspects of the crimes. One significant item was a photo of Ng in his prison cell, with cartoons he had sketched of his victims hanging on the wall behind him.

At one point during the trial, Ng somehow managed to obtain the phone number of one of the jurors. He contacted the juror at home in an unsuccessful attempt to cause a mistrial. During the trial, he was kept in a metal cage within a room when not in the courtroom.

In February 1999, Ng was convicted of eleven of the twelve homicides: six men, three women, and two male infants. Jurors found him not guilty on the twelfth charge, the murder of Paul Cosner, even though Lake and Ng had driven Cosner&#x27;s car for seven months since he went missing in November 1984, and Cosner&#x27;s California driver&#x27;s license had been found at the Wilseyville property. Ng was sentenced to death, and the presiding judge rejected a motion to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment. &quot;Mr. Ng was not under any duress,&quot; he said, &quot;nor does the evidence support that he was under the domination of Leonard Lake.&quot; Ng&#x27;s prosecution cost the State of California approximately $20 million, at the time the most expensive trial in the state&#x27;s history. It was twice as expensive as the O.J. Simpson trial in 1994–1995, which cost $9 million. The victims which Ng was convicted of murdering were Sean Dubs, Deborah Dubs, Harvey Dubs, Clifford Peranteau, Jeffrey Gerald, Michael Carroll, Kathleen Allen, Lonnie Bond Sr, Lonnie Bond Jr, Robin Stapley and Brenda O&#x27;Connor, all of whom were killed between July 1984 to April 1985.

On July 28, 2022, the California Supreme Court upheld Ng&#x27;s death sentence and conviction. Ng still has other federal appeals in spite of a moratorium on the death penalty by Governor Gavin Newsom.

As of 2023, Ng remains on death row at California Medical Facility. No executions have taken place in California since 2006.

<text>Jonathan Edward Borrell (born 4 April 1980) is an English guitarist and singer, currently the frontman of the rock band Razorlight, of which he is the only consistent original member.

==Early life and career==
Borrell was born in Sutton, London. His father, New Zealand-born John Borrell, was a war correspondent; his mother was a primary school teacher in Tottenham. His parents divorced when he was young. Borrell lived at Highgate, where he attended Highgate School. He moved to Camden School for Girls for sixth form.

Borrell was involved in music and the Camden scene while still at school. At 17 he played bass guitar in a band called Violet alongside Paul Rose, aka dubstep pioneer Scuba (musician), who regularly played gigs on the Camden circuit. The band recorded an EP and started to gain some recognition before splitting acrimoniously live on stage at Dublin Castle in late &#x27;97 . The title track of the EP was subsequently used in the soundtrack of the 1998 Michael Winterbottom film &#x27;I Want You&#x27;. After the split, he briefly switched to being a solo artist covering The Clash and Lead Belly songs. Many of these shows were played with close friends The Libertines.

Through his friendship with schoolmate John Hassall, at Highgate School, Borrell was involved in the early formation of The Libertines. He was present at the sessions for their debut album &quot;Up The Bracket&quot; and appears as a character in songs, notably &quot;Boy Looked at Johnny&quot; and &quot;Death on the Stairs&quot;, and also &quot;What a Waster&quot; which appeared as a bonus track on the album in Japan.

In 2002 he went on to form his own band which played house parties, rehearsing at a Hackney warehouse called Unit 13, comprising Carl Dalemo, Shïan Smith-Pancorvo (later replaced by Andy Burrows) and Björn Ågren. The band were watching a video recording of themselves playing a gig and misheard the ending refrain &#x27;Its alright, it&#x27;s alright&#x27; from the song &quot;In The City&quot; as &#x27;razor-light, razor-light&#x27; which was then chosen as the band name. In early 2003 XFM DJ John Kennedy began to play the band&#x27;s demos, recorded at Toerag Studios in east London with producers Liam Watson and John Fortis. Razorlight signed to Mercury Records on 23 May 2003 after the Universal label fought off bids from Sony.

After the number 8 single &quot;Golden Touch&quot;, their debut album, &quot;Up All Night&quot;, was released on 28 June 2004, and charted at number 3 in the UK. The critical reception was generally good, receiving good reviews from &quot;NME&quot; (&quot;Razorlight&#x27;s debut packs more tunes than Franz [Ferdinand], more spirit than The Strokes and more balls than nearly every band out there right now.&quot;), &quot;Q&quot; magazine, &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; who said &quot;Razorlight&#x27;s debut is a masterpiece. [Borrell]&#x27;s got the golden rock-star mop, the London sneer and a band full of crazy Swedes. But fortunately, he&#x27;s also got the tunes.&quot;

Michael Parkinson saw coverage of the band performing at Glastonbury Festival and invited them onto his TV show. Razorlight performed &quot;Golden Touch&quot; with a gospel choir in front of the Parkinson studio audience and guest Tom Cruise. After 2004&#x27;s constant touring Borrell was placed at No. 4 in NME&#x27;s Cool List and Razorlight won Best New Act at 2004&#x27;s Q Awards and the Best New Band category at the NME Awards in February 2005. French fashion brand Dior&#x27;s creative director Hedi Slimane based his 2005 Autumn/Winter collection on Borrell and Pete Doherty and chose Razorlight to write music for the Paris show.

In the Spring of 2005 Razorlight played two sold-out shows at London&#x27;s Alexandra Palace with Noel Fielding from The Mighty Boosh as their support act. Meanwhile, in between-album&#x27;s single &quot;Somewhere Else&quot; reached number 2 in the UK charts. Q Magazine called it: &quot;A punk rock symphony, a thrilling change in direction&quot;, and high-profile support slots with U2, Queen, The Who and Oasis and the band&#x27;s appearance at Live 8 kept Razorlight occupied through the rest of the year prior to entering the studio for their second album in early 2006.

The self-titled follow up was produced by Pretenders, Sex Pistols and Roxy Music producer Chris Thomas. Their first single &quot;In The Morning&quot; went to number 3, and when the album was released on 17 July 2006 it gave the band their first number 1 in the UK album chart. The NME gave the album 8/10 and said: &quot;A soulful romantic album that sees Razorlight comfortably leap the &#x27;difficult second album&#x27; trap&quot; whilst The Observer Music Monthly gave it 4/5 saying &quot;[Borrell&#x27;s] band&#x27;s second album justifies the self-belief.&quot; Q Magazine called it &quot;The best guitar album since Oasis&#x27;s &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;&quot;.

2006 saw Borrell and the band grow into an arena act and extend their international reach. Second single &#x27;America&#x27; went straight to number 1 in the UK on 14 October dominating UK radio charts to the end of the year, and climbing airplay and singles charts in Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Japan and America. The Rolling Stones asked the band to support them in Europe. An autumn UK arena tour culminated in a sold out Wembley Arena show and tours of Japan, Europe and the US led into a second UK arena tour and a sold-out show at London&#x27;s 17,000 capacity Earl&#x27;s Court in April 2007. Razorlight were the only UK band to headline the main stage at Reading Festival in August 2007. The Razorlight singer next emerged in October, duetting with The Kinks&#x27; Ray Davies on &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot; for the BBC Electric Proms at London&#x27;s The Roundhouse.

In late 2007 Borrell secluded himself on a remote Scottish island in the Outer Hebrides to begin writing for the band&#x27;s third album. 2008&#x27;s London sessions at Air studios lead to a more contemplative third album titled &quot;Slipway Fires&quot;. The album went to number 4 in the UK album charts in November 2008 and first single &quot;Wire To Wire&quot; got to number 5.
Press reaction to the record was mixed although Q&#x27;s Paul Rees gave the record 4/5 and said: &quot;Borrell and his band come up triumphant. It does what third albums traditionally used to do, which is to say, have the confidence the leap into the previously unknown, and for that, all credit to Borrell&quot;.

In Germany, &quot;Wire To Wire&quot; was the sixth biggest chart hit of 2009 and the album went gold. Two round the world tours, including first visits to Australia, a move to a new label, Mercury Records/Island Def Jam and major festival appearances in the UK and across Europe took Razorlight to the end of the decade, finishing with a December headline at XFM&#x27;s Brixton Academy Christmas show where they donated their fee to Borrell&#x27;s charity of choice, Anno&#x27;s Africa.

December 2009 also saw the digital release of a documentary on Razorlight made by UK film director Charles Henri-Belleville. Titled &#x27;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Lies&#x27; the 70-minute film follows the band on a week of UK shows intercut with band member interviews about Razorlight&#x27;s history. The film also features bonus material including Borrell&#x27;s charity hovercraft crossing of the English Channel and drummer Andy Burrows&#x27; trials and tribulations whilst giving up smoking while on tour.

==Solo work==
Borrell&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Borrell 1&quot;, was released in July 2013 in the UK. It was produced by Trevor Horn and received mixed reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100, the album received an average score of 46, based on 9 reviews by mainstream critics.

The album was a commercial failure, selling 594 copies in its first week on sale and failed to secure a position in the UK Albums Chart.

==Reputation and charity work==
Borrell has sometimes been regarded as having a very arrogant attitude towards the press and is famous for his proclamations of his own abilities such as claiming he thinks he&#x27;s the greatest songwriter in the world on MTV&#x27;s Gonzo hosted by Zane Lowe. However, like many other artists who come across negatively in NME interviews, Borrell and supporters have accused the magazine of misrepresentation and emphasising quotes out of context.

Borrell has made numerous contributions to charity. Razorlight recorded &#x27;Kirby&#x27;s House&#x27; for the 2005 Warchild album and played London, Royal Albert Hall shows in 2006 and 2008 for The Who&#x27;s Teenage Cancer Trust events (in 2008 the band performed &#x27;Summertime Blues&#x27; with Roger Daltrey). In 2006 Borrell started to work for Friends of the Earth&#x27;s climate change campaign &#x27;The Big Ask&#x27;, a relationship which has continued through 2006&#x27;s show in Trafalgar Square for the &#x27;icount&#x27; campaign to playing at FOE&#x27;s November 2009 Hammersmith Apollo fundraiser. Razorlight were deemed to be one of the highlights of 2 July 2005 Live 8 charity concert in Hyde Park and continued to support Borrell&#x27;s global warming concerns by taking part on 7 July 2007 Live Earth event at Wembley Stadium. Borrell is one of few amongst his contemporary generation of stars to have appeared on the cover of a national UK newspaper because of his political views. On 4 November 2006 his essay on climate change was the front cover story of The Independent. Razorlight have also regularly supported Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 46664 Aids charity. In July 2005 the band flew to Tromso, Norway to play a 46664 fundraiser. Mandela invited Razorlight to perform at his 1 December 2007 World Aids day concert in Johannesburg, which allowed the band to visit township AIDs projects. Borrell also worked with environmentally friendly charity Global Cool on their 2007 green campaigns.

They also played at Mandela&#x27;s July 2008 90th birthday celebration fundraiser in Hyde Park. Through his love of cricket (he appeared on the cover of Time Out&#x27;s cricket edition in August 2005 holding a cricket ball) Borrell has become friends with some of the English cricket team including former captain Andrew Flintoff who asked Razorlight to play at the inaugural night of his charity, The Andrew Flintoff Foundation (of which Borrell is a patron) in July 2009 at London&#x27;s The Hurlingham Club. Borrell also played charity shows for Nordoff Robbins, and Save The Children in the latter part of 2009 and in September duetted on &#x27;Je Suis Venue Te Dire Que Je M&#x27;en Vais&#x27; with legendary singer Jane Birkin as part of a fundraiser for Kenyan children&#x27;s charity Anno&#x27;s Africa.

==Borrell and The Libertines==
Borrell is one of &quot;The Dalston Set&quot;, a clique of indie notables connected to the early days of The Libertines, along with Dominic Masters of The Others, Pete Doherty, Carl Barât, John Hassall, and the Queens of Noize. It has been reported that he was briefly a stand-in bassist for The Libertines before they were signed, but in recent interviews he has claimed that this is not true; however, in Pete Welsh&#x27;s &quot;Kids in the Riot&quot;, it is alleged that Borrell was sacked as The Libertines&#x27; bassist for unreliable behaviour. In general though there is little animosity between the two bands, and Borrell remains friends with Carl Barât. The Libertines&#x27; song &quot;The Boy Looked at Johnny&quot; is reputedly about Borrell, and Razorlight&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Back To Dalston&quot; is reputedly directed at Pete Doherty, telling him to curtail his drug habit.

==Xfm==
Following his four-week residency on London radio broadcaster Xfm, Borrell joined the station for a further nine-week stint hosting a Sunday night show called The Sunday Service. It began on 6 September 2009 with Borrell playing a broad range of records spanning Jamaican dancehall, blues, rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, krautrock and spoken word.

==Other work==
Borrell has appeared twice on The Mighty Boosh, once alone as a giant rapist rabbit in the 2006 stage show and once with Razorlight in the episode &quot;The Priest and the Beast&quot;. Noel Fielding also opened for Razorlight at their two sold out Alexandra Palace shows in 2005 and appeared in the Razorlight video for the song &#x27;In the Morning&#x27; and &#x27;Up All Night&#x27;.
Borrell appeared on the front cover of the May 2007 issue of Vogue magazine, alongside supermodel Natalia Vodianova, in his trademark skinny white jeans and topless. Borrell is one of only seven men who have appeared on the cover of the UK version of Vogue.
In 2008 Borrell and bandmate Andy Burrows appeared at the Teenage Cancer Trust comedy night at the Royal Albert Hall, hosted by Borrell&#x27;s friend Noel Fielding. The two played a short acoustic set.

Late in 2007, Borrell played keyboards in a band he helped put together for Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine. The pair had met through Florence&#x27;s manager Mairead Nash. Borrell went on to co-write and produced two songs with Welch, &quot;The Hanging Song&quot; and &quot;Building Bricks&quot; although these did not end up on Florence&#x27;s debut album.

It was reported that Borrell would star in an Irvine Welsh scripted film alongside Colin Firth and Robert Carlyle called &#x27;The Meat Trade&#x27;, however the film did not make it into production.

Borrell appeared on &quot;Never Mind The Buzzcocks&quot; in 2013, where host Jack Whitehall teased him about how Borrell used to date Whitehall&#x27;s sister.

In July 2022, Borrell performed at Standon Calling festival in Hertfordshire alongside Jack Flanagan of Mystery Jets under the name Jealous Nostril.

<text>Onna White (March 24, 1922 – April 8, 2005) was a Canadian choreographer and dancer, nominated for eight Tony Awards.

==Early life and career==
Born in Inverness, Nova Scotia, White began taking dance lessons at the age of twelve, and eventually her studies took her to the San Francisco Ballet, where she danced in the first full-length U.S. production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. 

Her first Broadway performance was in &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in 1947. Her next Broadway assignment was in &quot;Hold It!&quot; (1948), where she had progressed to dance captain. By 1950, in the long-running Broadway production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, she both performed and assisted the choreographer, Michael Kidd, beginning an association that lasted through &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; various productions until, in 1956, she choreographed her first Broadway show, &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;. She choreographed both the Broadway (1957) and screen (1962) versions of &quot;The Music Man&quot;. Other Broadway shows included &quot;Take Me Along&quot; (1959), &quot;Irma La Douce &quot; (1960), &quot;I Had a Ball&quot; (1964), &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; (1965), &quot;Mame&quot; (1966, and the &#x27;film version in 1974), &quot;1776 (musical)&quot; (1969 and the film version in 1972), &quot;Gigi&quot; (1973) and &quot;I Love My Wife&quot; (1977), among others.

==Personal life==
She married actor Larry Douglas in 1948, who was an understudy to Robert Preston in &quot;The Music Man&quot;; they divorced in 1959. They had two children: Jeanne and Stuart. In 1964, Douglas married Susan Luckey, who played the role of Zaneeta in the film of &quot;The Music Man&quot;.

==Awards==
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voted White an Academy Honorary Award for &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968), one of the rare occasions that the Academy recognized choreography in film. Other recipients include Gene Kelly for &quot;career achievements&quot;, Jerome Robbins for &quot;choreographic achievement on film&quot;, Michael Kidd (White&#x27;s mentor) for &quot;services to the art of dance in the art of the screen&quot; and Stanley Donen for &quot;body of work&quot;. Fred Astaire&#x27;s was much earlier, and was for his body of work.

White&#x27;s Oscar is the only one that states the name of a film, i.e. &quot;To Onna White for her outstanding choreography achievement for &quot;Oliver!&quot;&quot;

<doc id="1216336" wikidata="Q520532" url="?curid=1216336" title="Gary Ablett (English footballer)">
<text>Gary Ian Ablett (19 November 1965 – 1 January 2012) was an English professional footballer and manager. He played as a defender from 1985 until 2001.

Ablett spent nine years with Liverpool, winning several honours, before moving to their city rivals Everton in 1992. He went on to win the FA Cup with Everton, having previously won an FA Cup in 1989 with Liverpool against Everton. He also played for Derby County, Hull City, Sheffield United, Birmingham City, Wycombe Wanderers, Blackpool and ended his playing career in the United States with the Long Island Rough Riders.

He moved into coaching and managed Liverpool F.C. Reserves, and then spent a year as manager of Stockport County.

Ablett died on 1 January 2012, following a 16-month battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, at his home in Tarleton, Lancashire. He was 46 years old.

==Playing career==

===Liverpool===
Ablett joined hometown club Liverpool as an apprentice upon leaving St Margaret&#x27;s Church of England High School in 1982. He made his Liverpool debut on 20 December 1986 in a goalless league away draw with Charlton Athletic, when regular defenders Barry Venison and Mark Lawrenson were absent due to injury. He made five more appearances that season mainly at left-back, scoring what would be his only goal for the club on 18 April 1987 in a 3–0 home league victory over Nottingham Forest. Alongside experienced players in defence, such as Gary Gillespie, Steve Nicol and skipper Alan Hansen, Ablett helped Liverpool win the 1987–88 League championship and reach the 1988 FA Cup final. Ablett only collected a runners-up medal in the latter competition due to Liverpool&#x27;s shock 1–0 defeat by Wimbledon.

In 1988–89, Liverpool made it to their second consecutive FA Cup final. This time they were successful, after a 3–2 victory over Merseyside rivals Everton. They lost the League title, however, to Arsenal with practically the last kick of the season. Ablett played most of the season at center-back due to injury problems for Alan Hansen, missing just three league games that season.

Ablett flitted in and out of the squad over the next year, relegated in the pecking order following the arrival of Glenn Hysén and the progress of Steve Staunton and David Burrows. He was used more frequently as a central defender rather than left full-back after Hansen continued suffering with injuries. At the end of the year Liverpool won the League again giving him his second league winners medal.

===Everton===
Kenny Dalglish resigned as Liverpool manager on 22 February 1991, and his successor, Graeme Souness, decided to sell Ablett for £750,000 to Everton in January 1992, after 147 appearances for the Reds.

He made his league debut for the club on 19 January 1992 in a 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest at Goodison Park.

Ablett won the FA Cup with Everton in 1995, becoming the only player to win the competition with both Merseyside teams. However, he lost his place at left-back to Andy Hinchcliffe in the 1995–96 season, who had been moved back into defence after spending most of the previous season playing left midfield with Ablett behind him.

===Later career===
Ablett went on to make 128 league appearances and score five goals for Everton, and later went on to have a brief loan spell with Sheffield United before making a permanent move to Birmingham City for £390,000, joining them at the same time as established Premiership players Steve Bruce and Mike Newell, as new manager Trevor Francis set about building a side capable of challenging for a place in the Premier League.

In three years with the Blues, he scored twice, with goals against Swindon Town in the league and Leeds United in the FA Cup.

He was released by Francis in 1999, and after short spells with Wycombe Wanderers and Blackpool, where he played under former Anfield teammate Steve McMahon and scored once, against Luton Town, he signed for American A-League side Long Island Rough Riders in June 2000. In February 2002, at the age of 36, Ablett was taken on trial by Grimsby Town.

In 2006, Ablett appeared as a substitute in Replay 86, a charity match staged in aid of The Marina Dalglish Appeal, which pitted the Liverpool and Everton sides that had contested the 1986 FA Cup Final against each other one more. Ablett&#x27;s inclusion was curious, because although on Liverpool&#x27;s books at the time of the Final, he did not actually make his debut for the club until the December of that year. Regardless, his contribution ensured Liverpool won the game 1–0.

==Coaching and managerial career==
In the summer of 2002, Ablett moved into coaching, taking up a post as the coach of Everton&#x27;s under-17 side. He worked as part of the club&#x27;s youth academy for several years until the summer of 2006, when he returned to his first club, taking the vacant job of Liverpool F.C. Reserves team coach, replacing Paco Herrera. The same career opportunities were not available at Everton with Andy Holden firmly established as reserve-team manager.

In April 2008, under Ablett&#x27;s guidance, Liverpool&#x27;s reserves were crowned champions of the Premier Reserve League North, and the following month they became national champions after a play-off final victory against Aston Villa&#x27;s reserves. In July 2008, he completed his final UEFA coaching qualification by obtaining the UEFA Pro Licence.

On 28 May 2009, Liverpool announced that Ablett would be leaving his position as reserve team manager. On 8 July 2009, Ablett was announced as the new Stockport County manager. The club was in administration for the whole of the 2009–10 season, during which his team managed only five league wins. At the end of the season the team were relegated, 25 points adrift of safety. He left the club on 17 June 2010 when the 2015 Consortium took ownership of the club.

==Illness and death==
Ablett agreed a one-year contract with Ipswich Town in July 2010 to join their coaching staff. After being taken ill on the training ground, he was diagnosed as suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of blood cancer.

On 1 January 2012, 17 months after his diagnosis, Ablett died at the age of 46. His funeral was held at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral on 17 January 2012 and was attended by former teammates, as well as members of the teams and the then managers of Everton and Liverpool.

Ablett&#x27;s widow Jacqueline supported calls for investigation into the hypothesis that artificial turf causes cancer.

<doc id="1216349" wikidata="Q6747234" url="?curid=1216349" title="Manchester, Richmond, Virginia">
<text>Manchester is a former independent city in Virginia in the United States. Prior to receiving independent status, it served as the county seat of Chesterfield County, between 1870 and 1876. Today, it is a part of the city of Richmond, Virginia.

Originally known as Manastoh and later Rocky Ridge, it was located on the south bank of the James River at the fall line opposite the state capital city of Richmond, on the north side of the river. Manchester was an active port city, and was a port of entry for slave ships principally in the 18th century. The port shipped out tobacco and coal which was transported 13 miles overland from the Midlothian-area mines on the Midlothian Turnpike, first paved toll road in Virginia in 1807, and the Chesterfield Railroad, the state&#x27;s first in 1831. Manchester became an incorporated town in 1769 and an independent city in 1874. In 1910, it merged by mutual agreement with the larger state capital City of Richmond, achieving another &quot;first&quot; as the earliest of Virginia&#x27;s independent cities to lose its identity.

Today, &quot;Old Manchester&quot; is considered a neighborhood of Richmond. Many vestiges of its past are clearly visible, notably the courthouse, the Hull Street business district, a number of historic houses, and several former railroad and street railway buildings. As part of the community&#x27;s African American heritage, a &quot;slave trail&quot; traces the route into the downtown area from where the slave ships docked along the river. Interstate 95, and four other major highways, U.S. Routes 1, 60, 301 and 360 all cross the James River and enter downtown Richmond from Manchester.

==Rocky Ridge, seaport, mills, and railroads==
As a result of the Second Anglo-Powhatan War, in 1645 the Virginia Colony&#x27;s House of Burgesses provided for Fort Charles to be built and garrisoned at the Falls of the James, to protect the frontier. After two years, Fort Charles was relocated to the south side, to the high ground above the later Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Bridge, on a tract owned by Capt. Thomas Harris. This land was then still known by its native name, Manastoh, but was thereafter renamed Rocky Ridge by the English. Rocky Ridge in 1769 became an incorporated town on Chesterfield County, with the name of Manchester.

Manchester grew to become a major seaport in the 17th through 19th centuries, as did its neighbor Richmond on the north bank of the river. Both were located at the head of navigation of the tidal James River at the geological fall line. Above that point, the river consists of seven miles of rapids before becoming more navigable again west of Richmond, although much shallower.

Before the American Revolutionary War, tobacco industries made the town their home. It was also known as a major slave market. Manchester was commercially successful primarily due to its agricultural mills and docks.

From northwestern Chesterfield County, coal from the Midlothian area 13 miles west was transported to the docks at Manchester, first on the Manchester Turnpike, a toll road and Virginia&#x27;s first graveled road of any length completed in 1807. Later, beginning in 1831, the congested turnpike was supplemented by the gravity and mule-powered Chesterfield Railroad, the first railroad in Virginia, partially engineered and funded by the Virginia Board of Public Works. For its final several miles, the line followed present-day Maury Street, which was the southern border of Manchester for many years. It crossed over the steam-powered Richmond and Petersburg Railroad (later Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) tracks (now abandoned) on a high trestle between what is now Clopton Street and Jefferson Davis Highway. When the new Richmond and Danville Railroad (R&amp;D) was completed between Manchester and Coalfield Station (now Midlothian) in 1851, the older Chesterfield Railroad was unable to compete and portions were acquired by the R&amp;D, with the remainder dismantled before the Civil War took place.

==County seat of Chesterfield County==

During Reconstruction, Manchester was briefly the county seat of Chesterfield County, from 1870 until 1876. County voters approved the move from Chesterfield Court House, Virginia, and the cornerstone of the new courthouse was laid on March 31, 1871. It was designed by Richmond-based architect A.L. West. The former courthouse complex on Hull Street is now the Manchester Division of the Richmond City courts.

Manchester became an independent city in 1874, and was therefore no longer technically located in Chesterfield County. In the election that year, county voters were again asked if they wished to relocate the county seat elsewhere, but rejected a move following a heated campaign, by a vote of 1,442 to 388. However, when the question of a move came up once again on the 1876 ballot, voters approved, 1290 to 772, a return to Chesterfield Courthouse, which became effective on July 1 that year.

==Manchester agrees to consolidate with Richmond==
For over 250 years, the James River divided Richmond on the north bank from its sister, Manchester, located on the south bank. A major issue for Manchester and Richmond residents in the 19th and early 20th century were the toll ferries and toll bridges over the James River. The latter were subject to frequent destruction by ice floes and flooding on the river.

There were periodic talks and negotiations for over 35 years between the cities before, in 1910, Manchester agreed to a political consolidation with the much larger independent City of Richmond. Richmond&#x27;s better-known name was used for both areas as it contained the location of Virginia&#x27;s state capital. Two of the key features of the consolidation agreement were requirements that a free bridge across the James River be built and that the separate courthouse in Manchester be maintained indefinitely. Instead of being a barrier between neighboring cities, under the consolidation, the James River became the centerpiece of the expanded Richmond.

Today, Manchester is recognized as a historic district in state and national registers. Although Manchester is extinct as an independent city, vestiges can be found in the Manchester Bridge, Manchester Slave Trail, and the Manchester Courthouse. Manchester and other areas of the City of Richmond south of the James River are locally referred to as &quot;South Richmond&quot;, &quot;South Side Richmond&quot; or simply &quot;South Side.&quot;

==Manchester as neighborhood: industry==

Though part of the city of Richmond, Manchester&#x27;s industrial presence continued to flourish in the 20th century. Manchester was serviced by Hull Street Station on the Southern Railway, built in 1901, the only major urban depot on the southern side of the James River. The skyline is dominated by the Southern States silos, the tallest structures south of the River.
Cooperative

==Manchester as neighborhood: Residential and Commercial==

The Manchester Residential and Commercial Historic District is located in the city of Richmond, Virginia, on the south side of the James River. It is connected to the financial district in Richmond by the Lee, Mayo and Manchester bridges. In the 1800s, Manchester along with Richmond, had become a major port and commercial center serving the eastern seaboard and beyond. Manchester was granted city status in 1874 and became the seat of Chesterfield County. In 1910, the city of Richmond annexed Manchester.

<doc id="1216360" wikidata="Q411333" url="?curid=1216360" title="Praseodymium(III) chloride">
<text>Praseodymium(III) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula PrCl3. Like other lanthanide trichlorides, it exists both in the anhydrous and hydrated forms. It is a blue-green solid that rapidly absorbs water on exposure to moist air to form a light green heptahydrate.

==Preparation==
Praseodymium(III) chloride is prepared by treating praseodymium metal with hydrogen chloride:

:2 Pr + 6 HCl → 2 PrCl3 + 3 H2
It is usually purified by vacuum sublimation.

Hydrated salts of praseodymium(III) chloride can be prepared by treatment of either praseodymium metal or praseodymium(III) carbonate with hydrochloric acid:
:Pr2(CO3)3 + 6 HCl + 15 H2O → 2 [Pr(H2O)9]Cl3 + 3 CO2

PrCl3∙7H2O is a hygroscopic substance, that will not crystallize from the mother liquor unless it is left to dry in a desiccator. Anhydrous PrCl3 can be made by thermal dehydration of the hydrate at 400 °C in the presence of ammonium chloride, the so-called ammonium chloride route. Alternatively the hydrate can be dehydrated using thionyl chloride.

==Reactions==
Praseodymium(III) chloride is Lewis acidic, classified as &quot;hard&quot; according to the HSAB concept. Rapid heating of the hydrate may cause small amounts of hydrolysis. PrCl3 forms a stable Lewis acid-base complex K2PrCl5 by reaction with potassium chloride; this compound shows interesting optical and magnetic properties.

Aqueous solutions of praseodymium(III) chloride can be used to prepare insoluble praseodymium(III) compounds. For example, praseodymium(III) phosphate and praseodymium(III) fluoride can be prepared by reaction with potassium phosphate and sodium fluoride, respectively:

:PrCl3 + K3PO4 → PrPO4 + 3 KCl
:PrCl3 + 3 NaF → PrF3 + 3 NaCl
:2PrCl3 + 3 Na2CO3----&gt; Pr2CO3 + 6NaCl
When heated with alkali metal chlorides, it forms a series of ternary (compounds containing three different elements) materials with the formulae MPr2Cl7, M3PrCl6, M2PrCl5, and M3Pr2Cl9 where M = K, Rb, Cs.

<text>Kenan (also spelled Qenan, Kaynan, Caynam or Cainan) (; ; ) is an Antediluvian patriarch first mentioned in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible.

The &quot;Sefer ha-Yashar&quot; describes Cainan, the possessor of great astrological wisdom, which had been inscribed on tables of stone, as the son of Seth; i.e., the antediluvian Kenan grandson of Seth according to the Bible. He is revered within Islamic tradition as well.

== In scriptures ==
According to Genesis 5:9–14, Kenan was a son of Enosh and a grandson of Seth. Born when Enosh was 90 years old (3679 BC), Kenan fathered Mahalalel when he was 70 years old. Other sons and daughters were born to Kenan before he died at 910 years of age (when Noah was aged 179 as per the Masoretic chronology). 

According to the Book of Jubilees, Kenan&#x27;s mother was Noam, wife and sister of Enosh; and Kenan&#x27;s wife, Mualeleth, was his sister.

He is also mentioned in the Genealogy of Jesus in Luke 3:36–37.

==Family tree==
The following family tree has been constructed from a variety of biblical and extra-biblical sources:

== In Islam ==
Kenan is mentioned in Islam in the various collections of tales of the Islamic prophets, which honor him in an identical manner.

<text>Frank Paul Smeal (August 7, 1918 – April 8, 2003) was a partner of the Goldman Sachs Group of New York City and philanthropist.

== Early life and education==
Smeal was born in Sykesville, Pennsylvania in rural Jefferson County, the son of a coal miner, and credited his mother, Mary, for inspiring him to seek a college degree. It took five years of working part-time as a &quot;soda jerk&quot; and a mortgage on his parents&#x27; home before he could achieve his goal of a college education. To get there, he had to hitchhike five miles a day. He had said that he went to college to stay out of the mines where his father had worked. &quot;That&#x27;s why Penn State is my first love after my wife and family. It gave me the education I needed.&quot;

Smeal was a 1942 Phi Beta Kappa graduate in economics at the Pennsylvania State University, and went on to earn a Master&#x27;s in Business Administration from Harvard University in 1947 and a law degree from New York University in 1952.

==Career==
A limited partner of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Smeal spent his 38-year career on Wall Street as an expert in the municipal bond market. As executive vice president and treasurer at Morgan Guaranty Trust co., he was instrumental in counseling New York City through its 1975–76 fiscal crisis. He became a partner and member of the senior management committee of Goldman Sachs in 1977 and retired in 1985.

Frank was a past-president of the Municipal Bond Club of New York and former Chairman of the Government and Federal Agencies Securities Committee of Public Securities Association. He was treasurer of the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa and of the Phi Beta Kappa Foundation. Frank also served as Chairman of the Greater New York Councils of Boy Scouts of America, Chairman of the Penn State Development Councils, and Chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission, New York, NY. He was also a member of the Board of the Mount Nittany Society.

==Philanthropy==
His philanthropic support of Penn State also extended to endowing a fellowship in business administration, a faculty chair in literary theory and comparative criticism, a creative writing award and a graduate assistantship in botany and plant pathology. In 1989, he and his wife, Mary Jean, donated $10 million to Pennsylvania State University, which renamed the Smeal College of Business in their honor.

==Personal life==
Smeal and his wife, the former Mary Jean Popp of State College, Pennsylvania, had two children Mary Margaret and Henry. He died Tuesday, April 8, 2003, at his home in Rumson, New Jersey after a long illness, at the age of 84.

<doc id="1216370" wikidata="Q715427" url="?curid=1216370" title="Li Xiucheng">
<text>Li Xiucheng (; 1823 – August 7, 1864) was a military rebel commander opposing the Qing dynasty during the Taiping Rebellion. He was born to a peasant family. In 1864, he was captured and interrogated following the third and final Battle of Nanjing. He was then executed by Zeng Guofan.

== Name ==
He was sometimes called the Loyal King (). This title was bestowed after he refused a bribe from a Qing general officer to kill Hong Xiuquan, the founder and leader of the rebellion.

== Biography==

===Second rout of the Jiangnan Army Group===
Army Group Jiangnan (江南大營) was an important Qing army barracks in Nanjing. Forces led by Li Xiucheng besieged the barracks in an attempt to force its occupants to surrender. Beginning from March 1858 during the second encirclement, the Qing army commanded 200,000 soldiers to fight against Taiping forces, but they were routed by Li Xiucheng in May 1860. After that, Li went on to occupy all of Jiangsu provinces except Shanghai.

=== Nanjing ===
Li worked alongside fellow Taiping General Chen Yucheng to defend and release the capital during the siege of Nanjing in 1860.

===Escape from Suzhou===
Li Xiucheng&#x27;s palace in Suzhou is the only one from the Taiping Rebellion era that still exists today. In July 1863, Li ordered his daughter&#x27;s husband, Tan Shaoguang, to capture Suzhou. But Li Hongzhang led the Huai Army combined by the &quot;Ever Victorious Army&quot;, which, having been raised by an American named Frederick Townsend Ward, was placed under the command of Charles George Gordon. With this support, Li Hongzhang gained numerous victories, leading to the surrender of Suzhou.

==Writing==
&quot;Loyal Prince Li Xiucheng In His Own Words&quot; () is his autobiographical account written shortly before his execution.

== Li&#x27;s sword ==
When Li withdrew from Suzhou, his sword, the symbol of his power, was given to his young brother Li Shixian. Li Shixian took this sword, but it was confiscated when he was captured by Charles George Gordon in Liyang. Charles George Gordon returned to the UK with Li&#x27;s sword, and presented it to Queen Victoria&#x27;s cousin, Chief Commander of the Military the Duke of Cambridge.

On 30 August 1961, the sword ended up in the hands of a history professor at the University of London. In 1981, this sword was returned to China, where it is currently stored in the National Museum of China.

==Children==
Li Xiucheng had a son, Li Rongfa and three daughters. Li&#x27;s daughters married Taiping generals, including Tan Shaoguang and Chen Binwen.

<doc id="1216372" wikidata="Q2495819" url="?curid=1216372" title="Clinton School of Public Service">
<text>The Clinton School of Public Service is a branch of the University of Arkansas system and is the newest of the presidential schools. It is located on the grounds of the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. The school is housed in the Choctaw Route Station, a former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad station built in 1899.

Former Senator and Governor David Pryor was named as the school&#x27;s first dean. He stepped down from his position as dean in February 2006 but retained the title and active position of Founding Dean. Skip Rutherford was appointed to succeed David Pryor and was named dean on April 12, 2006, and served until June 30, 2021. University of Arkansas System President Dr. Donald R. Bobbitt announced his recommendation of Dr. Victoria M. DeFrancesco Soto as the school&#x27;s next dean on September 7, 2021.

== Master of Public Service Program ==
The Clinton School is a graduate school offering its students a Master of Public Service degree. The program is described as a &quot;two-year graduate program with a &#x27;real world&#x27; curriculum.&quot; The mission of the school is &quot;to educate and prepare individuals for public service, incorporating a strategic vision, an authentic voice, and a commitment to the common good.&quot; The program is unique within the presidential schools for its emphasis on practical courses, which include a practicum, summer internship, and capstone project. The school is further unique for its emphasis on leadership for social change, preparing students to become leaders in the public, private, and non-profit sectors, as well as its emphasis on creating bridges among those sectors. The Clinton School emphasizes equity, as opposed to emphasizing efficiency in public administration schools and effectiveness in public policy schools.

== Public programs and publications ==
The Clinton School releases a biannual publication called &quot;&quot;. The fall/winter 2007 inaugural issue of &quot;Frank&quot; was entitled “Has the Dream Arrived?” and focused on race relations in America. It included pieces by David Eisenhower, President Bill Clinton, Carlotta Walls Lanier, Karl Rove, The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Richard Dawkins, Simon Cowell, Eboo Patel, Aneesh Raman, and Antonio Villaraigosa.

===Speaker series ===
Since 2004, the Clinton School hosts free public programs, guest lectures and community conversations featuring a wide range of internationally-prominent leaders and timely topics. Some notable speakers have included Henry Kissinger, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Karl Rove, Alan Keyes, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, John McCain, and Richard Dawkins. The series also screens films and documentaries and hosts panel discussions for every Arkansas Repertory Theatre production. Since its inaugural lecture from U.S. Senator Bob Dole, the school has hosted over one thousand events, including nine presidents and prime ministers, two Supreme Court justices, 22 Pulitzer Prize winners, 13 U.S. senators, 41 ambassadors, four Oscar winners, two astronauts and four NFL players, among others

All programs are free and open to the public, though more notable speakers sometimes requires advanced ticketing. The format of the speakers vary widely, and the school has made its public forums with Charles Ogletree, Judge Robert Carter, and John Edwards available to the Arkansas Educational Television Network, or AETN. Most of the series is recorded and available to the public from the Clinton School&#x27;s website.

In addition to the speaker series, the Clinton School has teamed with the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Kumpuris family to establish a distinguished lecture series at the Clinton Presidential Center. The Kumpuris Lecture Series inaugural address on August 7, 2007 was given by President Clinton. Other guest lecturers include James Baker, Sam Waterston, and Nobel Prize winner Wangari Maathai.

== Enrollment ==
The Clinton School admitted 16 students from around the globe in its inaugural class in 2005. Since then, the school has increased admission to about 50 students and has a current enrollment of about 90 students. The enrollment pattern is in keeping with the two other presidential schools that are coupled with presidential libraries. By comparison, the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs started in 1970 with 18 students and now has 312; the George Bush School of Government and Public Service began in 1997 with 19 students and now has 125. Students who are enrolled in the Clinton School are encouraged to continue public service acts throughout the world. Many participants come from public service backgrounds and already have experience in the field. Some programs Clinton School students come from include the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and some have military and medical backgrounds.

==Notable alumni==
*Vivian Flowers, Democratic member of the Arkansas House of Representatives for Jefferson County, since 2015; diversity officer at UAMS Medical Center in Little Rock
* Jessica DeLoach Sabin, a political analyst &amp; strategist, was highlighted by the Huffington Post as one of the &quot;top young television pundits&quot; in the country, dubbing her the &quot;most seasoned millennial Democrat in American broadcast punditry.&quot;

<doc id="1216375" wikidata="Q1428764" url="?curid=1216375" title="Flin Flon Bombers">
<text>The Flin Flon Bombers are a Canadian junior ice hockey team in Flin Flon, a city located on the Manitoba–Saskatchewan provincial border. The Bombers are members of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL), which is a member of the Canadian Junior Hockey League, and they play home games at the Whitney Forum on the Manitoba side of the city. The team&#x27;s history dates back to 1927 and includes a decade-long run in the major junior Western Hockey League in the late 1960s and 1970s. The team has won two national championships, including the 1957 Memorial Cup and the 1969 James Piggott National Championship.

==History==

=== Early years ===
The Bombers date back to 1927. Their trademark colours are maroon and white. The team originally played at the Flin Flon Community Club Arena until the construction of the Whitney Forum, known locally as &quot;the zoo&quot;, in the 1950s. The Bombers originated as a senior team, and they competed in the Northern Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League and the Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League between 1937 and 1948.

===SJHL dynasty===
In the postwar period, the Bombers became charter members of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL). The team quickly established a dynasty, winning seven league titles in a nine-year span between 1952 and 1960. The team&#x27;s biggest success during this period came in the 1956–57 season. The Bombers lost only five games in the regular season. In the playoffs, the Bombers beat the Humboldt Indians four games to none in the semifinals, then won the final over the Prince Albert Mintos four games to two. As SJHL champions, the Bombers then advanced to the Abbott Cup to determine the champion for Western Canada. They defeated the Edmonton Oil Kings, a team of junior-aged players competing in the senior Central Alberta Hockey League, four games to two, then the Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League&#x27;s Fort William Canadiens in four games to win the Abbott Cup and advance to the Memorial Cup national tournament.

As per Memorial Cup rules, the Bombers were permitted to add three players to their roster for the 1957 national playoffs, picking up goalie Lynn Davis and defenceman Jean Gauthier from the Fort William Canadiens and centre Orland Kurtenbach from Prince Albert Mintos. There, they faced the Eastern Canadian champion Ottawa Canadiens, coached by Sam Pollock and assistant Scotty Bowman. The first three games were in Flin Flon, with the remaining games played in Regina, Saskatchewan with Pollock drawing the ire of Flin Flon residents for criticizing the remoteness and size of the community. The Bombers won the series four games to three to claim the Memorial Cup championship. The win by the Bombers was considered a considerable upset over the favoured Canadiens. The team was greeted by 4,000 people when they returned to Flin Flon after the series.

The 1956–57 Bombers were inducted into both the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame (1999) and the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame (2009), as well as the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.

The Bombers played in the SJHL until 1966, when the launch of the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (CMJHL) led the SJHL to fold with several of its teams joining the new league. The Bombers spent the 1966–67 season in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) instead. Led by coach Paddy Ginnell and star players Reggie Leach and Bobby Clarke, who won the league scoring title, the Bombers dominated the MJHL and won the Turnbull Cup as league champions, before losing the Abbott Cup final to Port Arthur. Clarke recorded 71 goals and 183 points in 45 games, while Leach recorded 67 goals and 113 points. Ginnell was credited with turning the Bombers into a hard-working and physically tough team. The arrangement with the MJHL would last just one season, with the Bombers leaving the league in 1967.

=== Western Canada Hockey League===

After its inaugural season, the CMJHL was renamed the Western Canada Junior Hockey League, which was then simplified to the Western Canada Hockey league one year later. After their one season in the MJHL, the Bombers joined the WCHL, now the top level of junior hockey in Western Canada, for the 1967–68 season, and they immediately built on their previous success.

The Clarke-led Bombers continued to dominate, finishing in first place for the 1967–68 regular season before losing in the President&#x27;s Cup finals to the Estevan Bruins. The Bombers again finished in first place in the 1968–69 season, going on to win that season&#x27;s playoffs to become President&#x27;s Cup champions, defeating the Edmonton Oil Kings. Clarke led the league in scoring both seasons, while Leach recorded 87 goals in 1967–68. As 1969 WCHL champion, the Bombers proceeded to win a national championship in 1969 by defeating the St. Thomas Barons of the Western Ontario Junior A Hockey League; the best-of-seven series was unsanctioned by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), which at the time had barred the WCHL from competing for the Memorial Cup. The short-lived Canadian Hockey Association organized an alternate championship; despite being a best-of-seven, St. Thomas withdrew from the series during the fourth game, trailing the game and the series two games to one, protesting the Bombers&#x27; violent play style—the Bombers were awarded the title. After the series, Flin Flon challenged the Memorial Cup-champion Montreal Junior Canadiens to a showdown, but the Montreal club declined. The following season, with Clarke having graduated to the professional ranks, the Bombers repeated as league champions, again defeating Edmonton, with Leach leading the league in scoring. Due to the controversy surrounding the previous years series against St. Thomas, there was no national series in 1970.

The growing financial demands of major junior hockey, including extensive travel, became a strain for the Bombers, who played in one of the league&#x27;s smallest and most remote communities; not only was the travel difficult for the Bombers, but for any team visiting Flin Flon, which had also developed a reputation as a particularly violent team. The franchise departed Flin Flon after the 1977–78 season. The franchise played three and a half seasons after leaving Flin Flon with iterations as the Edmonton Oil Kings—after the original Oil Kings departed Edmonton in 1976 due to pressure from the Edmonton Oilers—for the 1978–79 season, the Great Falls Americans for part of 1979–80 before suspending operations, and the Spokane Flyers for 1980–81 and start of the 1981–82 season before folding in December 1981.

===Return to Junior A===
In 1977, the WCHL Bombers had formed an affiliate Junior B team. The Jr. B Bombers would win the 1977–78 Baldy Northcott Trophy as Manitoba Provincial Champions. When the WCHL Bombers departed to Edmonton, the Bombers&#x27; ownership retained the Junior B Bombers. The Flin Flon ownership, along with the owners of the Thompson King Miners, banded together with people from The Pas and Snow Lake, Manitoba to create the NorMan Junior Hockey League (NJHL), a rival to the Manitoba Junior League; the following year, the NJHL—along with the Bombers—would be promoted to Junior A status and the right to compete for a national Junior A championship. Flin Flon won NJHL titles in 1979, 1982, and 1984.

For the 1984–85 season, the Bombers were granted expansion into the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL), which had been revived in 1968 following the 1966 demise of the original SJHL. For two seasons, due to SJHL rules requiring teams to be located in Saskatchewan, the team was re-named the Creighton Bombers after the adjacent community of Creighton, despite Flin Flon straddling the provincial border. After two seasons, the league allowed the team to re-adopt the Flin Flon moniker.

<doc id="1216377" wikidata="Q7962147" url="?curid=1216377" title="Walkabout (The Fixx album)">
<text>Walkabout is the fourth studio album by the English new wave band the Fixx, released in 1986. The first single, &quot;Secret Separation&quot;, spent two weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart in July 1986; it was the band&#x27;s second No. 1 single on the chart.

==Production==
The album was produced by Rupert Hine. Singer Cy Curnin started working on the album while temporarily living in Africa. &quot;Walkabout&quot; was the first album to include bass player Danny Brown as an official member of the band.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; called the album &quot;the most well-rounded, honest effort by the group so far, marked by a deliberate attempt to &#x27;uncomplicate&#x27; the group&#x27;s sound, without sacrificing the poignancy of the social messages in the songs.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the album the band&#x27;s best to that point, writing that &quot;the LP&#x27;s uninventive slices of quirky new wave, tentative funk and Bowie impersonations could have been worse.&quot; The &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; wrote that &quot;the Fixx is capable of creating polished but ultimately passionless and perfunctory pop-funk ... this is not a record that anyone&#x27;s going to remember five years from now.&quot;

<text>The Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal, also known as the Main Building of the U.S. Arsenal at Little Rock, or Headquarters Building of the Little Rock Barracks, is the home of the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History. It is also a part of the MacArthur Park Historic District, in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Built between 1840 and 1841, it was part of Little Rock&#x27;s first U.S. military installation. Since decommissioning, the building has housed two local museums. It was home to the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities from 1942 to 1997 and the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History since 2001. It has also housed the Little Rock Æsthetic Club since 1894. The building receives its name from its distinct octagonal tower. Besides being the last remaining structure of the original U.S. military installation and one of the oldest buildings in central Arkansas, it was also the birthplace of General Douglas MacArthur, who became the supreme commander of U.S. forces in the South Pacific during World War II. It was also the starting place of the Camden Expedition during the American Civil War.

==History==
===Background===
The building and the surrounding park were used for many public purposes throughout the early 20th century. The Tower Building served as headquarters for the United Confederate Veterans Reunion, May 15–18, 1911. Over 106,000 Civil War veterans, the largest popular gathering in the history of the city up to that time, attended and were housed in the building or camped in the park, which had also become a popular camping area. Later the building served as an armory for the Arkansas National Guard. In 1912, the second floor of the Tower Building became Little Rock&#x27;s first public library. In 1917, Little Rock built a fire station in the park. A band shell named for H. H. Foster also was built in the park during this time, but no longer exists. In 1936, Works Progress Administration built the Museum of Fine Arts, now called the Arkansas Arts Center, just south of the Tower Building.

The arsenal was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Due to its association with the Camden Expedition of 1864, the arsenal may be included in the Camden Expedition Sites National Historic Landmark designated in 1994.

In 1942, the Tower Building was renovated due to the efforts of the Æsthetic Club, Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop, and the Works Progress Administration. It became the new home of the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities, which had been located in Little Rock City Hall. The museum remained in the tower building for approximately fifty-five years. The area surrounding the Tower Building had been known as Arsenal Park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed City Park. Due to the efforts of Bernie Babcock, however, the city finally named it MacArthur Park in 1942 in honor of Douglas MacArthur.

In 1997, the Museum of Science and Natural History merged with the Little Rock Children&#x27;s Museum, which had been located in Union Station, to form the Arkansas Museum of Discovery. The new museum was relocated to a historic building in the Little Rock River Market District. The MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History opened on May 19, 2001, in the Tower Building. The new museum&#x27;s goal is to educate and inform visitors about the military history of Arkansas, preserve the Tower Building, honor servicemen and servicewomen of the United States and commemorate the birthplace of Douglas MacArthur.

===Construction===
The arsenal was constructed at the request of Governor James S. Conway in response to the perceived dangers of frontier life and concerns over possible confrontations with Native Americans who were passing through the state on their way to established Indian Territory following their removal from the southern United States. Thirty-six acres were appropriated on the outskirts of Little Rock by Major Robert B. Lee of the U.S. Army. The land had been previously used as a racetrack by the local jockey club. John Wormley Walker, a builder for the Federal Government, supervised the construction. Originally $14,000 was allocated for the construction of the arsenal, but proved inadequate. The budget was later increased to $30,000. Work began on the Tower Building in 1840, and it was the first permanent structure of the arsenal to be built. Being originally constructed to store ammunition, the building was designed with exterior walls. The original plans called for it to be built of stone, however, masonry was used instead. The Arkansas Gazette referred to the structure as &quot;A splendid specimen of masonry&quot;.

===American Civil War===
For several years the arsenal, which was owned by the federal government, served as a simple arms depot and was staffed with only a handful of soldiers. But in November 1860, with the American Civil War on the horizon, a company of the Second United States Artillery, consisting of sixty-five men, was transferred to Little Rock under the command of Captain James Totten. On January 15, 1861, the state legislature decided to hold a referendum to determine if a state convention should be held to consider the issue of secession and to elect delegates to such a convention. It was planned for February 18; however, events at the arsenal, would not wait. On January 28, then Governor Henry M. Rector informed Captain Totten that he and his soldiers would be &quot;permitted to remain in the possession of the Federal officers until the State, by authority of the people, shall have determined to sever their connection with the General Government,&quot; Totten responded to this by telling the Governor that his orders came from the United States Government and began a desperate but ultimately futile dispatch of letters and telegrams asking for reinforcements, although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming. The first telegraph wire to span between Little Rock and Memphis had recently been completed. Local attorney John M. Harrell was asked to compose the first telegraph dispatched from Arkansas&#x27;s capital. In his message, Harrell reported unconfirmed rumors that more federal troops had been sent to reinforce the Little Rock Arsenal.

&quot;The United States troops at the outposts of the western frontier of the state and in the Indian nation have all been recalled from winter quarters to reinforce the garrison at Fort Smith. The garrison at Fort Smith had been previously transferred to the United States Arsenal in this city&quot; (Little Rock). &quot; The arsenal is one of the richest depositories of military stores in the United States and is supposed to be the ultimate destination of the tropps&quot;[sic]&quot;ordered from the frontier.&quot;
:::-John M. Harrell Telegram, January 31, 1861

The item was intended simply as a piece of news, but telegraph lines quickly spread the news throughout the state, fueling procession sentiment. The rumor was interpreted by some Arkansans as a call from the governor to assemble to help expel the federal troops from the arsenal. By February 5, six militia units, consisting of 1,000 men, with a guarantee that the numbers could be increased to 5,000 if the situations deemed it necessary, had assembled in Little Rock. Governor Rector vehemently denied ordering the troops to assemble or giving any order at all in connection with the troops. Faced with the fact that the military had assembled believing they were following his orders and the consensus of the citizens of Little Rock against any armed conflict between the civilian army and federal troops, Governor Rector was forced to take control of the situation. On February 6, he sent a formal demand for surrender of the arsenal to Captain Totten,

&quot;This movement is prompted by the feeling that pervades the citizens of this State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be under the control of the State authorities, in order to their security. This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.&quot;

Perhaps because Abraham Lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as President, Captain Totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops. He agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions:
# The governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the United States.
# The soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war.
# The soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders, not as conquered and surrendering soldiers.

On the morning of February 8, 1861, Rector and Totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials. That afternoon, the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with Governor Rector at its head. All of the federal troops had left at this point, except Totten who had stayed behind to listen to the Governor&#x27;s speech and to hand the arsenal over in person.

The Little Rock Arsenal was classified in 1860 as an &quot;arsenal of deposit,&quot; meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis. Thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs, nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the Arsenal fell into State hands. Most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the Arkansas Military Board.

Inside the Little Rock Arsenal after its seizure in February, 1861, the Confederates inventoried some 10,247 weapons, 250,000 musket cartridges, and 520,000 percussion caps, as well as the four bronze cannon of Totten&#x27;s battery. Long arms in the Arsenal&#x27;s inventory consisted of:

:M1822 .69 cal (flintlock) 5,625
:M1822 .69 cal (percussion-converted) 53
:M1842 .69 cal smoothbore (percussion) 357
:M1855 .58 cal rifle-muskets 900
:M1817 common rifles 125
:M1841 rifle (&quot;Mississippi Rifle&quot;) 54
:M1847 musketoon 2
:Hall&#x27;s carbines 267
:Hall&#x27;s rifles (flintlock) 2,864
::Total 10,247

Of this number, approximately 9600 weapons were serviceable, or ready-for-issue. Note there were only 1,364 percussion weapons available. Disposition of the weapons found in the Arsenal is somewhat sketchy, but from various records it can be surmised that the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, mustered in June, 1861, were issued M1816/M1822 .69 caliber flintlocks. The 9th and 10th Arkansas, four companies of Kelly&#x27;s 9th Arkansas Battalion, and the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment were issued flintlock Hall&#x27;s Rifles. The units comprising the infantry force of Van Dorn&#x27;s Army of the West were the 1st and 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles were also armed with M1822 flintlocks from the Little Rock Arsenal. By the time the 11th and 12th Arkansas Infantry Regiments mustered in at Little Rock, the supply of arms had been almost completely exhausted, and only old &quot;junker&quot; weapons were left.

Most of the equipment, arms, and machinery at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to east of the Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn in April and May 1862, and accountability for it is lost at that point. By all appearances, the equipment was sent down the river to Napoleon, Arkansas, and from there to Jackson Mississippi, where it was probably destroyed during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863.

Major General Thomas C. Hindman, sent to command the district of Arkansas in May, 1862, found the state nearly destitute of military material. Hindman established another armory at Arkadelphia, and revived the Little Rock Arsenal as a collection point and depot for armaments and ammunition manufacture for small arms. Hindman recorded:

&quot;Machinery was made for manufacturing percussion caps and small arms, and both were turned out in small quantity, but of excellent quality. Lead mines were opened and worked, and a chemical laboratory was established and successfully operated in aid of the Ordnance Department and in the manufacture of calomel, castor oil, spirits of nitre, the various tinctures of iron, and other valuable medicines. Most of these works were located at or near Arkadelphia on the Ouachita River, 75 miles south from Little Rock. The tools, machinery, and the material were gathered piecemeal or else made by hand labor. Nothing of this sort had been before attempted on Government account in Arkansas to my knowledge, except for the manufacture of small arms, the machinery for which was taken away by General Van Dorn and there was neither capital nor sufficient enterprise among the citizens to engage in such undertakings� A further supply, along with lead and caps, was procured from the citizens of Little Rock and vicinity by donation, purchases, and impressments.

This ammunition, and that which I brought with me, was rapidly prepared for use at the Laboratory established at the Little Rock Arsenal for that purpose. As illustrating as the pitiful scarcity of material in the country, the fact may be stated that it was found necessary to use public documents of the State Library for cartridge paper. Gunsmiths were employed or conscripted, tools purchased or impressed, and the repair of the damaged guns I brought with me and about an equal number found at Little Rock commenced at once. But, after inspecting the work and observing the spirit of the men I decided that a garrison 500 strong could hold out against Fitch and that I would lead the remainder - about 1500 - to Gen&#x27;l Rust as soon as shotguns and rifles could be obtained from Little Rock instead of pikes and lances, with which most of them were armed. Two days elapsed before the change could be effected.&quot;

The Confederate ordnance establishment at Little Rock was reactivated in August, 1862. Looking around for a suitable person to head this activity, General Hindman turned to the Confederate Navy and borrowed Lieutenant John W. Dunnington. Lt. Dunnington was the commander of the gunboat C.S.S. Pontchartrain, which had been brought to Little Rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad. Dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at Little Rock, and although he continued to draw his pay from the Confederate Navy Department, he was placed in charge of all Confederate ordnance activities (which included artillery functions) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Lt. Col. Dunnington&#x27;s &quot;Returns for the month of August, 1862, at Little Rock Arsenal, C.S.A.,&quot; are found in Vol. 149, Chapter IV of the &quot;Captured Rebel Ordnance Records,&quot; and are most enlightening as to the scope of Confederate ordnance activities at Little Rock during this crucial time. According to Dunnington, &quot;When I assumed command at this Post, all material had been removed to Arkadelphia. There were no persons employed. No shops were open for repair of arms or for fabricating ammunition. Material, tools, etc., had to be procured as well as the employment of laborers. Work commenced the last part of the month.&quot;

The military force at Little Rock under Dunnington&#x27;s command consisted of four officers: himself, Major John B. Lockman, Captain C.C. Green, and 2nd Lt. W.W. Murphy. In addition to these, he had 20 enlisted men and a civilian force composed of a foreman, 2 clerks, 3 gunsmiths for repairing small arms, a laboratorian, 26 laborers in the ammunition laboratory, and a carpenter for making packing boxes.

During the month of August, 1862, the following work was performed:
&quot;Fabricated: one pair of musket bullet moulds; 10,000 buck &amp; ball shot cartridges; repaired: 750 muskets, shotguns, and rifles; received and repaired: ordnance stores and ordnances; performed: guard, office, and police duties; inspected: Posts at Camden and Arkadelphia.&quot;

Lt. Col. Dunnington continued to build up his works at Little Rock until November 1862, when Captain Sanford C. Faulkner (composer of The Arkansas Traveler) was placed in charge of the Arsenal. Dunnington presumably returned to his naval duties and the Pontchartrain.

A &quot;Summary of the Work Done for November, 1862, Little Rock Arsenal&quot; shows:
Fabrication:
:75,000 buck &amp; ball cartridges - percussion
:14,000 buck &amp; ball cartridges - flint
:275 paper fuzes
:117 rounds, 6-pounder canister shot
:130 rounds, 6-pounder ball shot
:96 ammunition packing boxes

Repaired:
:2,236 shotguns and rifles (repaired mostly for troops in service)
:23 pistols (repaired mostly for troops in service)
Received &amp; Issued:
:752 packages of ordnance and ordnance stores received and mostly issued to troops in service.

Repaired and painted:
:4 gun carriages

Performed:
:Guard, office, and police duties.

Perhaps the most illuminating points of the above &quot;Summary of Work&quot; and those for following months are that the standard ammunition made was .&quot;buck &amp; ball&quot;, indicating that the .69 caliber smoothbores and shotguns remained the predominant caliber weapon in use, and of this, nearly one sixth or more of all small arms ammunition was still for flintlock weapons, indicating that no less than a sixth of the Confederate troops in this vicinity were still armed with obsolete flintlock weapons.

The &quot;Summaries of Work done at Little Rock Arsenal, C.S.A.&quot; continue at about the same pace and scale from August 1862 until August 1863. Appended to the &quot;Summary&quot; for August, 1863 is the ominous notation, &quot;During the last week in the month, nearly all stores at the Arsenal have been packed and sent to Arkadelphia, in obedience to orders from Chief of Ordnance, District of Arkansas.&quot; This then marks the beginning of the evacuation of ordnance activities from Little Rock, with the city being surrendered to the advancing Federal troops of Frederick Steele&#x27;s Arkansas Expedition on September 11, 1863.

In 1864, after Little Rock fell to the Union Army and the arsenal had been recaptured, General Fredrick Steele marched 8,500 troops from the arsenal beginning the Camden Expedition.

===Brooks-Baxter War===

In 1874, the arsenal was briefly seized once more by Joseph Brooks loyalists.

===Decommissioning===
In 1873, the arsenal was renamed Little Rock Barracks and the main building used as married officers&#x27; quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches had been added to the building, as well as interior walls and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.

In the 1880s, the federal government began closing many small arsenals around the country in favor of smaller ones built near railroads for quick deployment. The arsenal commander received word from Washington that the Little Rock site must be abandoned &quot;not later than October 1, 1890.&quot; On April 12, 1893, the tower building and the surrounding buildings were traded to the city of Little Rock for 1,000 acres (4 km2) in Big Rock Mountain on the north side of the Arkansas River, present day North Little Rock, under the condition that the building and land be &quot;forever exclusively devoted to the uses and purposes of a public park.&quot; That site later became Fort Logan H. Roots. All of the original buildings surrounding the Tower Building were demolished.

===Æsthetic Club===
In 1894 the Little Rock Æsthetic Club, one of the oldest women&#x27;s societies west of the Mississippi River, moved into the Tower Building. This was prompted due to increased membership and a need for larger, more permanent quarters. The previous year, club members working with women&#x27;s organizations throughout the state, raised money to furnish the Arkansas Building of the Columbian Exposition at The Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. At the fair&#x27;s conclusion, artifacts from the exhibit were displayed in the Tower Building, with the Æsthetic Club invited to meet in the &quot;Columbian Room.&quot;

Except for Æsthetic Club meetings, the Tower Building remained largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration. The Æsthetic Club provided much-needed financial support during the period and even paid the electric bill during the Great Depression. The Æsthetic Club is still headquartered in the Tower Building.

==Museum==
The MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History, named for General Douglas MacArthur who was born in what is now the museum when it was military barracks is located in the Tower Building. The museum opened in May 2001 and as of 2018 had been visited by more than 500,000 people. It is operated by the Little Rock Department of Parks and Recreation and tells the stories of Arkansas&#x27; soldiers from the Civil War through Vietnam via artifacts, photographs, weapons and other ephemera. One of its galleries is focused on the Battle of Little Rock.

<doc id="1216386" wikidata="Q5468954" url="?curid=1216386" title="Forest Hills (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>Forest Hills is a residential neighborhood in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., United States, bounded by Connecticut Avenue NW to the west, Rock Creek Park to the east, Chevy Chase to the north, and Tilden Street NW to the south. The neighborhood is frequently referred to as Van Ness because it is served by the Van Ness–UDC station on the Washington Metro&#x27;s Red Line and is near the Van Ness campus of the University of the District of Columbia (UDC).

== Transit ==
Forest Hills is served by the Red Line of the Washington Metro and the Crosstown Line (H2, H3, and H4) and Connecticut Avenue Line (L1, L2, and L4) of the D.C. Metrobus.

== Points of interest ==

Forest Hills contains the former site of the Civil War-era Fort Kearny, of which no trace remains today, and the Soapstone Valley Park, which surrounds a tributary of Rock Creek.

The Howard University School of Law campus is across Connecticut Avenue from UDC on Upton Street NW. The Levine School of Music is located on Upton Street, in the building originally occupied by the Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory. The Edmund Burke School, founded in 1968, is located on Upton Street, in the building that was originally occupied by Devitt Prep.

The Hillwood Museum, located in a house that once belonged to philanthropist and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, contains her collection of decorative objects, including several Fabergé eggs.

The embassies of the Czech Republic and the Netherlands are located on Linnean Avenue NW in Forest Hills, while that of Suriname is on Connecticut Avenue. The embassy of Hungary is just south of Tilden Street in Cleveland Park, and a number of other embassies are located just to the west in North Cleveland Park.

The Seventh-day Adventist Capital Memorial Church is located at 3150 Chesapeake Street NW.

==History==
The National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) was at one time the largest employer in the neighborhood.

Due to an absence of restricted housing covenants as in other, similarly situated neighborhoods, the Forest Hills neighborhood became predominantly Jewish during the 1940s and 1950s.

<doc id="1216388" wikidata="Q1136273" url="?curid=1216388" title="Thorncrown Chapel">
<text>Thorncrown Chapel is a chapel located in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, designed by E. Fay Jones, and constructed in 1980. The design recalls the Prairie School of architecture popularized by Frank Lloyd Wright, with whom Jones had apprenticed. The chapel was commissioned by Jim Reed, a retired schoolteacher, who envisioned a non-denominational pilgrimage chapel set apart for meditation. The design of Thorncrown Chapel was inspired by Sainte-Chapelle, a Gothic church in Paris, France, pierced by numerous stained glass windows. It held some of King Louis&#x27;s medieval Christian relics, including the Crown of Thorns believed worn by Christ. This relic inspired the name of the American chapel.

The chapel&#x27;s unusual artistry has been recognized. It was selected for the 2006 Twenty-five Year Award by the American Institute of Architects. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, a status not granted to buildings fewer than fifty years old unless exceptionally significant. It was included in &quot;Budget Travel&quot;″s list of &quot;12 Most Beautiful Churches in America&quot; and Bored Panda&#x27;s list of &quot;50 Most Extraordinary Churches Of The World.&quot;

==Background==
Resident Jim Reed, a retired schoolteacher, bought land in 1971 where he intended to commission a non-denominational pilgrimage chapel near Eureka Springs, Arkansas. He wanted it to be set apart from the city for meditation in the foothill, forested landscape. He commissioned architect E. Fay Jones to design the project. Jones said he was inspired in his design of Thorncrown Chapel by Sainte-Chapelle, a Gothic church in Paris, France. It is known for its jewel-like interior, the result of its many narrow, stained-glass windows and different types of glass that allow light into the structure.

==Structure and status==

The chapel stands high, wide, and long. It has 425 windows, which add up to 6,000 square feet (approximately 560 square meters) of glass. During the design process, Jones decided that in order to preserve the site&#x27;s natural setting, no structural element could be larger than what two men could carry through the woods. The structure was constructed using organic materials indigenous to northwestern Arkansas, including pressure-treated Southern pine and flagstone for the floor and surrounding wall. The small ornamental roof skylight was later enlarged to provide additional natural lighting throughout the chapel.

The chapel looks like an open-air structure, but is, in fact, an enclosed air-conditioned space that seats up to 100 people. It is open daily from March to December with free admission. It is closed January and February except for weddings and other special events. Non-denominational church services are held in the adjoining worship center on Sundays from April to December.

==Honors and awards==
The chapel was selected by the American Institute of Architects for the 2006 Twenty-five Year Award, recognizing works whose value has continued. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, a status not granted to buildings fewer than fifty years old unless exceptionally significant.

&quot;Budget Travel&quot; included the chapel in its list of &quot;12 Most Beautiful Churches in America&quot; Bored Panda has it on the list of &quot;50 Most Extraordinary Churches Of The World.&quot;

<text>Nicola Sharon French (born 26 September 1964) is an English singer. She is best known for her 1995 dance cover version of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, which reached the US and UK top 5, and for representing the United Kingdom in the 2000 Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm.

== Life and career ==
=== 1964–1993 ===
French was born in Carlisle, Cumberland, England.

French&#x27;s first &quot;gig&quot; came at the age of seven, when she was chosen to sing the first verse of &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot; at her infants&#x27; school Christmas concert.

From the age of 16, French studied music and drama at West Kent College in Tonbridge, Kent. She played the lead role of Laurey in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; before moving to London and started auditioning for bands and theatre shows.

=== 1980s-1993: Musical beginnings ===
In the mid-1980s, French was part of the duo Whisky and Sofa. They released &quot;Dirty Den&quot; in 1986.

In 1991, French was booked as the leading lady in a series of revue shows on a cruise ship, touring Europe and beyond and covering songs from stage and screen.

In 1992, French provided backing vocals on Rose-Marie&#x27;s 1992 album, &quot;Emotional Exposure&quot;. Generally, French had been a session singer for many years before she covered &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;.

=== 1994–1999: Career peak, &quot;Secrets&quot; and &quot;French Connection&quot; ===
In 1994, French covered &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, a song originally made famous by Bonnie Tyler. The song reached number 5 during a three-month chart run on the UK Singles Chart, selling over 250,000 (UK) copies in the process and earning a silver sales award. In the United States, the song reached number 2, spending six months on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and gaining gold certification from the RIAA. The single also reached number 1 in a number of countries – Japan, Canada, Spain and Brazil – as well as charting in Australia, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. French sold in excess of 5 million copies.

Her second single, &quot;For All We Know&quot;, a cover version of the Carpenters&#x27; song, peaked at number 42 on the UK Singles Chart. French&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Secrets&quot;, was released in 1995 and further singles from the album included &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?&quot;, &quot;Did You Ever Really Love Me?&quot; and &quot;Never in a Million Years&quot;. French was Mike Stock&#x27;s Love This Records&#x27;s biggest artist before it went into liquidation. &quot;Secrets&quot; sold over 50,000 copies in its first week of sale in the US.

In 1997, French released &quot;French Revolution&quot;. The single &quot;Te Amo&quot; peaked at number 4 in Brazil. &quot;French Revolution&quot; achieved success in Japan and Taiwan but French was then dropped by her record label after management reconstructing.

=== 2000–present: Eurovision Song Contest and diversification ===

At the 2000 Eurovision Song Contest, French represented the United Kingdom with &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song Again&quot;. The song was selected by the British public ahead of seven other finalists on radio and TV. French finished the contest in 16th place. The track entered at number 34 in the UK chart.

French signed to Jim Steinman&#x27;s Ravenous Records label for a short period in 2000, during which time she recorded &quot;Lovers Again&quot; and &quot;Two Out of Three Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot;, neither of which was ever commercially released.

In 2003, French was one of nine contestants on a special Eurovision edition of BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. Joining Sonia, Lyn Paul, James Fox, Katie Boyle, Bobby Gee, Jessica Garlick, Katrina Leskanich and Jemini on the show hosted by Anne Robinson, French won the event and was declared &#x27;The Strongest Link&#x27; raising £13,000 for Cancer Research, having lost her father to cancer in 1997.

In 2004, French released &quot;I Surrender&quot; and in 2005, &quot;Calling Out My Name&quot;. &quot;I Surrender&quot; charted on the UK Indie Chart at #37 and EuroNRG Top 40 chart

The pantomime gained great reviews, making it into the top 10 pantomimes in the UK in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper. In 2009, French played Fairy Godmother in &quot;Cinderella&quot; for New Pantomime Productions.

In 2009, a special edition of French&#x27;s second album, &quot;French Revolution&quot;, became available. The re-release contained seventeen tracks and included all three of her most recent singles along with a previously unreleased version of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;.

In August 2010, French toured the UK in the musical &quot;Annie&quot;, performing eight different roles every night in the show&#x27;s long run, and was understudy for the role of Miss Hannigan, played by Su Pollard.

In November 2012, French played the role of Helga Ten Dorp in Ira Levin&#x27;s Deathtrap at the Brookside Theatre in Romford.

In 2014, 20 years after the success of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&#x27;&quot;, Mike Stock and French started working together again, recording new tracks for his label Modal Production Group (MPG Ltd). The first release from the studio session was the dance number &quot;This Love&quot;. According to Stock, &quot;the song&#x27;s message is a celebration of love and commitment&quot;.

<text>Pullulan is a polysaccharide consisting of maltotriose units, also known as α-1,4- ;α-1,6-glucan&#x27;. Three glucose units in maltotriose are connected by an α-1,4 glycosidic bond, whereas consecutive maltotriose units are connected to each other by an α-1,6 glycosidic bond. Pullulan is produced from starch by the fungus &quot;Aureobasidium pullulans&quot;. Pullulan is mainly used by the cell to resist desiccation and predation. The presence of this polysaccharide also facilitates diffusion of molecules both into and out of the cell.
As an edible, mostly tasteless polymer, the chief commercial use of pullulan is in the manufacture of edible films that are used in various breath freshener or oral hygiene products such as Listerine Cool Mint of Johnson and Johnson (USA) and Meltz Super Thin Mints of Avery Bio-Tech Private Ltd. (India). Pullulan and HPMC can also be used as a vegetarian substitute for drug capsules, rather than gelatine. As a food additive, it is known by the E number E1204.

Pullulan has also be explored as natural polymeric biomaterials used to fabricate injectable scaffolding for bone tissue engineering, cartilage tissue engineering, and intervertebral disc regeneration.

<doc id="1216401" wikidata="Q5415714" url="?curid=1216401" title="Evangelical Lutheran Synod">
<text>The Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS) is a US-based Protestant Christian denomination based in Mankato, Minnesota. It describes itself as a conservative, Confessional Lutheran body. The ELS has 130 congregations and has missions in Peru, Chile, India, South Korea, Ukraine, Czech Republic, and Latvia.

The ELS is in fellowship with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) and is a member of the international Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC).
==Core beliefs==
The Evangelical Lutheran Synod teaches that the Bible is the only authoritative and error-free source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the Book of Concord) not with a quatenus (in-so-far-as) but instead a quia (because) subscription; that is, it subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions because it is an accurate presentation of what scripture teaches. It teaches that Jesus is the center of scripture and the only way to eternal salvation, and that the Holy Spirit uses the gospel alone in Word and Sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion) to bring people to faith in Jesus as savior and keep them in that faith, strengthening them in their daily life of sanctification.

==Membership==
In 2023, the ELS had an estimated number of 16,000 baptized members. The ELS also has 130 congregations and missions in Peru, Chile, India, South Korea, Ukraine, Czech Republic, and Latvia. Note that the ELS uses the term &quot;synod&quot; differently from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and is a separate denomination.

==History==

The Evangelical Lutheran Synod traces its history back to 1853 when the Norwegian Synod was organized in the Midwestern United States. They practiced &quot;fellowship&quot;, a form of full communion, with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) during the 1850s and 1860s. In 1872, they along with the LCMS and the WELS formed the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America.

In 1917, the Norwegian Synod merged with two other Norwegian Lutheran groups and formed the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, later named the Evangelical Lutheran Church. This led to disagreement among members of the Norwegian Synod. The people who became the ELS had concerns regarding fellowship with those who did not share the same doctrine. The Norwegian Synod had taught that conversion and salvation were entirely the work of God without any cooperation from humans. The new merged church allowed that conversion depended in some degree on humans accepting God&#x27;s grace. A group of people therefore gathered at Lime Creek Lutheran Church near Lake Mills, Iowa, on June 14, 1918, and reorganized as the Norwegian Synod of the American Evangelical Lutheran Church (also known as &quot;Little Norwegian&quot; Synod) The name was changed to the Evangelical Lutheran Synod on June 25, 1957.

In 1955, the ELS suspended its fellowship with the LCMS over doctrinal disagreements, and in 1963, it withdrew from the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America. It retained its fellowship with the WELS. (The WELS severed its fellowship relations with the LCMS in 1961, and also withdrew from the Synodical Conference in 1963.)

In 1993, the ELS and WELS, working with a number of other worldwide Lutheran churches, some of which had been founded through mission work by both synods, founded the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC).

The ELS published a hymnal, the Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary, in 1996. This hymnal is in the tradition of the 1941 The Lutheran Hymnal as well as earlier Scandinavian hymnals.

===Association of Confessional Lutheran Churches===
The Association of Confessional Lutheran Churches (ACLC) was established in the early part of the 21st century to meet the needs of Lutheran congregations that departed from the Evangelical Lutheran Synod when they considered a pastor to have been wrongly removed by that body. The root purpose of the ACLC, then, is to maintain a pool of pastors from which member congregations can call. There are two member churches.

==Education ministries and missions==

In 1927, the ELS formed Bethany Lutheran College in Mankato, Minnesota. In 1946, it established its own seminary, also in Mankato, called Bethany Lutheran Theological Seminary. Throughout its history, ELS congregations have actively sponsored Christian elementary schools.

The synod carries on an active home mission program and now has 130 congregations in many states. It also has foreign missionaries in Peru and Chile in South America and in Ukraine, Latvia, and the Czech Republic (Czech Evangelical Lutheran Church) in Eastern Europe.

<text>Lorenzo Maitani (c. 1275–1330) was the Italian architect and sculptor primarily responsible for the construction and decoration of the façade of Orvieto Cathedral.

Maitani established his reputation in Siena and was called to supervise the construction at Orvieto in 1308 when the height and span of the cathedral&#x27;s vaults and arches raised problems. In 1310 he received the title &quot;capomaestro&quot; of the cathedral and also became overseer of bridges and civic buildings.

The design of the cathedral&#x27;s façade is considered to be Maitani&#x27;s most important work. It is difficult to determine his contributions to the façade as a sculptor. It has been assumed that he influenced the overall design. Two of the panels attributed to Maitani, &quot;Scenes from Genesis&quot; and &quot;The Last Judgment,&quot; are delicate bas-reliefs joined by an ascending vine that suggests a French Gothic influence. Sculptures generally attributed to Maitani include the bronze &quot;Eagle of St. John&quot; and the &quot;Angel of St. Matthew.&quot;

<text>CMJ Holdings Corp. is a music events, online media company and a distributor of up and coming music CDs, originally founded in 1978, which ran a website, hosted an annual festival in New York City, and published two magazines, &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; and &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot;. The company folded around 2017, but was bought by Amazing Radio in 2019 who announced plans to bring back the CMJ Music Marathon in New York, along with other new live and live-streamed offerings. The letters CMJ originally stood for &quot;College Media Journal&quot; but was also often considered short for &quot;College Music Journal&quot;.

==History and operations==

The company was started by Robert Haber in 1978 as the &quot;College Media Journal&quot;, a bi-weekly trade magazine aimed at college radio programmers in Great Neck, NY. The first issue was published on March 1, 1979, and featured Elvis Costello on the cover. Staff would often describe these early issues as &quot;a bunch of photocopies stapled together.&quot;

A year and a half later, the magazine was able to create the first annual CMJ Music Marathon, which was named after the New York City Marathon, which was held at around the same time of year. About 100 people attended, and there were no showcases.

In 1982, the magazine officially rebranded as &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot;.

CMJ continued to grow, and by the 1990s, Haber and the CMJ staff wanted to stay connected to the college radio scene, but felt unable or unwilling to pay the high price for a subscription to a trade publication. To fill the need, CMJ created &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; in 1993. This consumer publication featured interviews, reviews, and special features. It was also the first magazine to regularly include a CD of music. It was available on newsstands and via subscription.

The company got caught up in the internet bubble in the late 90s when Rare Medium Group purchased CMJ in November 1999. Rare owned interest in , , LiveUniverse, and the ChangeMusic Network (the latter of which, CMJ would become a subsidiary). Rare moved CMJ out of Great Neck and into a new office in New York, NY. The internet conglomerate fizzled by 2001, and Haber purchased the debt-saddled CMJ back from Rare.

The shift back to being an independent company proved to be difficult. &quot;New Music Monthly&quot; saw several issues be &quot;subscriber only&quot; and unavailable on newsstands. That year&#x27;s Music Marathon in New York City was intended to be a comeback for the now independent media company with hundred of bands, many panelists, and thousands of attendees scheduled to attend between September 13–16 with an ill-picked tagline in hindsight of &quot;A Killer Event.&quot; The events of September 11, 2001, led to the event&#x27;s cancelation. A scaled-back version of the Marathon took place a month later.

Minor scandals followed. CMJ was accused of manipulating their charts in order to push their own compilation into the Top 200; however, CMJ claimed it was an accident and the compilation was only used as a placeholder. This resulted in CMJ changing the name of their New Music Report compilation from &quot;Certain Damage&quot; to &quot;On Air&quot;. In addition, the magazine was criticized at the time by many in the independent music community for focusing too much on major label acts, which resulted in Beggars Group pulling ads from the publication.

By 2004, &quot;New Music Monthly&quot; was off newsstand completely and issues were often sent out sporadically, which made it hard to attract new subscribers. &quot;New Music Report&quot; went from being a weekly publication to only being sent out every other week (the published charts were available only online for the off-weeks).

Though the final issues were sent out in 2008, &quot;New Music Monthly&quot; officially stopped publishing on June 20, 2009. &quot;New Music Report&quot; would soon follow.

While the magazines were faltering, CMJ entered into an agreement with Metropolitan Talent for a proposed merger. This resulted in Metropolitan giving CMJ $600,000 in &quot;stay alive money,&quot; but ended in a lawsuit when the deal fell apart and CMJ was instead sold to Adam Klein (former CEO of eMusic) and Abaculi Media instead in 2014. In a move described as &quot;devastating,&quot; founder Bobby Haber was let go by Abaculi shortly thereafter.

By 2016, CMJ was no longer putting on the annual Music Marathon, and staff stopped getting paid in October 2015, which eventually lead to a lawsuit and Klein&#x27;s bankruptcy.

In 2019, Amazing Radio purchased the CMJ brand with the hope of reviving the Music Marathon. Offerings of various artists were placed online with at home performances due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

==&quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot;==

CMJ New Music Report published top-30 lists sent to them by radio stations, which subscribed at a cost of a few hundred dollars a year. The magazine moved to an online only format and was released weekly as a digital PDF magazine until it folded in 2017.

On January 5, 2004, &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; published a 25th anniversary double issue led by an editorial staff that included editor-in-chief Kevin Kerry Boyce, and managing editors Louis Miller and Doug Levy. The issue featured The White Stripes on the cover in a photograph captured by art director Drew Goren; the magazine named the band&#x27;s 2003 release, &quot;Elephant&quot;, its Album of the Year.

Many musicians from the New York City indie rock community have worked on staff at CMJ over the years, including members of acts such as Parts and Labor, Poingly, Worriers, and The Airborne Toxic Event.

==&quot;CMJ Music Marathon&quot;==
From 1980 through 2015, staff organized the CMJ Music Marathon, a convention and music festival, each autumn, in New York. A second festival, the CMJ Rock Hall Music Fest, took place in Cleveland in 2005 and 2006; in April 2007, organizers canceled the event, citing strains on financial and staffing resources.

CMJ Music Marathon organized the New Music Awards.

==&quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;==

CMJ New Music Monthly was a monthly music magazine with interviews, reviews, and special features published from 1993 to 2009. Each issue included a compact disc with 15 to 24 songs by well established bands, unsigned bands, and everything in between. As of issue 156 (1112 using the CMJ New Music Report numbering), dated June 20, 2009, the magazine ceased operation, and subscribers had their remaining issues replaced by the &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; with a music compilation available online. By April 2010, it stopped delivering &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; to its subscribers.

<text>The () is a visitor attraction adjacent to the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, with a prime focus on automobiles. The complex was designed by Henn GmbH.

It features a museum, feature pavilions for the principal automobile brands in the Volkswagen Group, a customer centre where customers can pick up new cars, and take a tour through the factory, a guide to the evolution of roads, and cinema in a large sphere.

==History==
The idea for was started in 1994 when the concept of documenting the stages of production of Volkswagen vehicles and how the company&#x27;s operations were showcased at Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany. In 1998, broke ground on the former site of a fuel company bordering Volkswagen&#x27;s Wolfsburg production plant. Like the adjacent car plant, the site of is on the north bank of the Mittelland Canal. The resulting complex is the work of more than 400 architects, created as a new urban center, close to downtown Wolfsburg.

The main pavilion opened in , providing an opportunity to present famous cars hitherto locked in crates to be shown to the public. By that time it was reported that Volkswagen had invested approximately 850 million Deutsche Mark, equivalent to in , in the project. is located next to Volkswagen&#x27;s main factory which is also an attraction. Every Volkswagen model is available giving the opportunity for the public to choose what they want. Volkswagen then manufactures the car specified according to the purchaser&#x27;s requirements.

==Visitors and attractions==

 attracts around 2 million visitors a year. It is very popular because of the ultra modern architecture it features in each building. Extensive use is made of water and vegetation between the pavilions and mounds of earth covered in grass are located in the grounds. Modern design is not just incorporated into the pavilions but also into the furniture such as benches and chairs.

It has a small track for the off-road Volkswagen Touareg underneath the bridge which leads from the main town to the which is located above the main canal cutting through the city, the Mittelland Canal. Visitors must be able to show driving licences before being able to drive the vehicles. First, the guide drives the car around the track showing the features of the vehicle and giving information of the vehicle&#x27;s capabilities. After driving around the track, the visitor can then drive around the track under the surveillance of the guide, who sits in the passenger seat. Any other passengers sit in the back. Features of the track include a 21 degree angled hill, another hill which is angled on the side, a water hazard, a sand pit which is located under a road bridge, a log road and a numerous small mounds which allow one wheel to be raised off the ground.

There is a mini track for children where they can drive small electric cars in the form of Volkswagen Beetles.

 has a large variety of multimedia activities and devices which include car design software. There is a room exhibiting the advantages and disadvantages different fuels have on the performance of cars. There are two cinemas which show small films in German. One of these cinemas is located in its own purpose-built buildings and is in a large sphere.

Major attractions are some famous cars, such as the first petrol vehicle produced, and the Volkswagen Beetle.
There are two glass silos () used as storage for new cars. The two towers are connected to the Volkswagen factory by a tunnel. When cars arrive at the towers they are carried up at a speed of per second. The render for the shows six towers. When purchasing a car from Volkswagen (the main brand only, not the sub-brands) in select European countries, the customer gets to decide whether they want it delivered to the dealership where they bought it or travel to to pick it up there. If the latter is chosen, the supplies the customer with free entrance, meal tickets and a variety of events building up to the point where the customer can follow on screen as the automatic elevator picks up the selected car in one of the silos. The car is then transported out to the customer without having driven a single metre outside the factory and the odometer thus reads zero.

There is also a room with interactive devices which provide information on the design of cars using Audi as an example. Computer software allows visitors to design their own cars using features from Audi cars.

==Pavilions at Autostadt==
There are seven pavilions dedicated to car manufacturers at .

===Volkswagen production and development===

There are two pavilions for Volkswagen which show production and the development of cars.

The Volkswagen development pavilion is the largest in ground area of all pavilions at . The pavilion is circular in shape and has two floors which display all models in the Volkswagen range plus a shop of Volkswagen articles of clothing, die cast models and vehicle accessories which is located on the top floor.

The production pavilion is the smallest and one of the last of the pavilions to be constructed. It was not included on the original render of .

===Porsche===

The Porsche pavilion is circular-shaped, the interior design is simple yet elegant. The visitors enter on a descending curved corridor entering the only hall of the pavilion. There are three models on display, a Boxster, a 911 and a Panamera. Behind them there are small models of the previous cars in the history of the marque with the oldest displayed with the smallest and the generation just before the current one the biggest in scale. Next to the cars on display, there is a black couch fitted with iPads running an app which shows the history of Porsche with pictures and videos on the former generations.

===Premium Clubhouse (formerly Bentley)===
The pavilion is built into a small hill. It has a marble roof and the entrance is cut into the side of the grass-covered mound. The exit is on the opposite side of the pavilion. It was designed by KSS Architects.

The pavilion visit began with an escalator with a film either side documenting cars produced by Bentley since the creation of the company. There was then a spiralling walkway which descends around a rotating displays of cogs illuminated by coloured lights which changed throughout. Television screens of varying sizes were located around this contraption which showed different videos of their vehicle&#x27;s performance.

The Bentley pavilion was renamed in 2008, now being shared with the Bugatti brand and renamed the &quot;Premium Clubhouse&quot;.

The displays include a Bugatti Veyron with a special chrome finish and separately an engine from the same car model.

===Škoda===
The Škoda pavilion consists of a number of metal sculptures. It shows several examples of cars produced under the Škoda brand and small models of all types ever produced in Škoda&#x27;s history. Like in other brand pavilions it is possible to open and enter the cars to get a feeling for them. Information about engine specifications, prices and fuel consumption are next to each car.

===Lamborghini===

The building is completely black and a show with an orange Lamborghini Aventador attached to the wall greets visitors. During the show, the lights dim and dry ice floods the room before finally diminishing, revealing that the car has disappeared from the wall. During this, the car which sits on a vertical platform has been rotated 180 degrees and sits on the outside of the building.

===Audi===
The building is large and has a unique &quot;sphere-guide&quot;. Each visitor gets a small plastic sphere which they first have to activate by giving their name and taking a photo with the help of wall-mounted touchscreens at the entrance. Then through the way in the pavilion, the sphere lights up with the same color as the design of the current section and visitors can push their spheres onto special hemisphere depressions on the wall thus for example launching a video about some technical information on the wall mounted displays, light up a real Audi headlight placed behind a piece of glass in the wall or creating an illusion of charging an electric A1 by floor-mounted lights. Visitors can get into the vehicles on display including an R8. At the end of the tour visitors can send their photo made at the entrance in e-mail or post it to social networking sites after dropping the sphere in the collecting pit.

===SEAT===

The SEAT pavilion is surrounded by water and plants and is one of the largest pavilions. A metal archway is located at the entrance to the bridge which leads to the entrance of the building. The roof of the entrance is glass and the wall to the right is composed solely of red wing mirrors. There is a display of the fourth generation of the SEAT Ibiza in a glass case. The platform it sits on rotates. The next room then comprises all current SEAT models on display. A staircase leads up to a mezzanine level with numerous computer screens and iPads with playable racing games. This finally leads to an exit which comprises a wooden based bridge on metal tubes. This bridge is interactive; the tubes contain speakers which play back the Seat &#x27;castanet&#x27; SFX with each footstep across the bridge.

<doc id="1216413" wikidata="Q4184720" url="?curid=1216413" title="Layback spin">
<text>A layback spin is a variation of the upright spin, a spin in figure skating. British figure skater Cecilia Colledge was &quot;responsible for the invention&quot; of the spin and the first to execute it. Colledge&#x27;s coach, Jacques Gerschwiler, who was a former gymnastics teacher and according to Colledge &quot;very progressive in his ideas&quot;, got the idea for the upright spin while watching one of Colledge&#x27;s trainers, a former circus performer turned acrobatics instructor, train Colledge to perform backbends &quot;by means of a rope tied around her waist&quot;. The upright spin has long been associated with women&#x27;s skating, but men have also performed it. Skaters include it in their programs because it increases their technical content and fulfills choreographic needs.

The layback spin is executed by holding the free leg in a back attitude position and arching the head and upper body backward so that the skater faces up towards the sky, ceiling, or further. The free leg position is optional. A variation of the layback spin is the [[Biellmann spin]], made popular by world champion Denise Biellmann, which the International Skating Union (ISU), the organization that governs figure skating, considers a difficult variation of the layback spin. It is executed by the skater grabbing their free blade and pulling the heel of their boot behind and above the level of the head so that their legs are in an approximate full split, with the head and back arched upward. The spin &quot;requires much strength and extreme flexibility&quot;.

Other difficult variations of the layback spin are the full layback (the upper body is arched sideways with the upper body bent to the side from the waist towards the ice or arched back from the waist towards the ice) and when the skater&#x27;s upper body is arched sideways or arched back, with their free leg almost touching their head in a full circle. In ice dance, difficult variations of the layback spin include a split, with both legs straight and the boot of one partner&#x27;s free leg held up higher than their head (which can be supported by their partner) and leaning away from the other partner, with the axis to their upper back to the knee over 45 degrees.

<text>In Greek mythology, Athos (; , ) was a giant that Poseidon fought. He is best known for the creation of Mount Athos, a mountain and peninsula in Chalcidice, northern Greece, which is now an important centre of Eastern Orthodox monasticism. In Greek it is commonly called , meaning &#x27;Holy Mountain&#x27;.

== Family ==
In one account however, he was said to be the son of Poseidon himself by the Naiad nymph Rhodope, daughter of the river-god Strymon (the modern Struma).

== Mythology ==
The mountain took its name after this Athos, who was attacked by Poseidon, the god of the sea. The citation is incomplete, as it fails to establish that the mountain was named from the giant. Stephanus of Byzantium attributed the story to some lost work by Nicander, where he apparently described Poseidon hurling two blocks with his hands against the gigantic Athos. Eustathius of Thessalonica says that then Poseidon trapped Athos under the mountain.

<text>Opelt is the lava-flooded remnant of a lunar impact crater on the Mare Nubium. It lies to the north of a similar formation named Gould and to the northeast of the prominent Bullialdus.

The crater was named after the German astronomers Friedrich Wilhelm Opelt and his son Otto Moritz Opelt.

Only a slightly raised outline remains of Opelt&#x27;s rim, the interior having been inundated with lava. The rim has a wide break at the northern end and several smaller breaks to the south and southeast. The satellite crater Opelt E lies at the southern end of the surviving western rim. The interior floor is nearly level, with the exception of a slight rise to the southwest, which is continuous with a wrinkle ridge to the south.

To the north of Opelt on the lunar mare is a sinuous system of rilles designated Rimae Opelt. These occupy a diameter of about 70 kilometers.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Opelt.

<text>According to the Greek writer Ctesias, Sardanapalus ( ; ), sometimes spelled Sardanapallus (), was the last king of Assyria, although in fact Aššur-uballiṭ II (612–605 BC) holds that distinction.

Ctesias&#x27; book &quot;Persica&quot; is lost, but we know of its contents by later compilations and from the work of Diodorus (II.27). In this account, Sardanapalus, supposed to have lived in the 7th century BC, is portrayed as a decadent figure who spends his life in self-indulgence and dies in an orgy of destruction. The legendary decadence of Sardanapalus later became a theme in literature and art, especially in the Romantic era.

The name &quot;Sardanapalus&quot; is probably a corruption of Ashurbanipal (&quot;Aššur-bāni-apli&quot; &gt; &quot;Sar-dan-ápalos&quot;), an Assyrian emperor, but Sardanapalus as described by Diodorus bears little relationship with what is known of that king, who in fact was a militarily powerful, highly efficient and scholarly ruler, presiding over the largest empire the world had yet seen.

==Story according to Diodorus==
Diodorus says that Sardanapalus, son of Anakyndaraxes, exceeded all previous rulers in sloth and luxury. He spent his whole life in self-indulgence. He dressed in women&#x27;s clothes and wore make-up. He had many concubines, female and male. He wrote his own epitaph, which stated that physical gratification is the only purpose of life. His lifestyle caused dissatisfaction within the Assyrian empire, allowing a conspiracy against him to develop led by &quot;Arbaces&quot;. An alliance of Medes, Persians and Babylonians challenged the Assyrians. Sardanapalus stirred himself to action and routed the rebels several times in battle, but failed to crush them. Believing he had defeated the rebels, Sardanapalus returned to his decadent lifestyle, ordering sacrifices and celebrations. But the rebels were reinforced by new troops from Bactria. Sardanapalus&#x27;s troops were surprised during their partying, and were routed.

Sardanapalus returned to Nineveh to defend his capital, while his army was placed under the command of his brother-in-law, who was soon defeated and killed. Having sent his family to safety, Sardanapalus prepared to hold Nineveh. He managed to withstand a long siege, but eventually heavy rains caused the Tigris to overflow, leading to the collapse of one of the defensive walls. To avoid falling into the hands of his enemies, Sardanapalus had a huge funeral pyre created for himself on which were piled &quot;all his gold, silver and royal apparel&quot;. He had his eunuchs and concubines boxed in inside the pyre, burning himself and them to death.

==Historical authenticity==
There is no king named Sardanapalus attested to in the Assyrian King List. Parts of the story of Sardanapalus seem to be related in some degree to events in the later years of the Assyrian Empire, involving conflict between the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal and his brother Shamash-shum-ukin, who controlled Babylon as a vassal territory, on behalf of his brother. While Sardanapalus has been identified with Ashurbanipal, his alleged death in the flames of his palace is closer to that of his brother Shamash-shum-ukin, who became infused with Babylonian nationalism and formed an alliance of Babylonians, Chaldeans, Elamites, Arabs and Suteans against his master in an attempt to transfer the seat of the vast empire from Nineveh to Babylon.

There is no evidence from Mesopotamia that either Ashurbanipal or Shamash-shum-ukin led hedonistic lifestyles, were homosexual or transvestites. Both appear to have been strong, disciplined, serious and ambitious rulers, and Ashurbanipal was known to be a literate and scholarly king with an interest in mathematics, astronomy, astrology, history, zoology and botany.

It was Shamash-shum-ukin in Babylon who was besieged and defeated, and his allies crushed, not Ashurbanipal in Nineveh. After the former&#x27;s defeat in 648 BC, an inscription of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s records that &quot;they threw down Shamash-shum-ukkin, enemy brother who attacked me, into the raging conflagration&quot;.

The actual Fall of Nineveh occurred in 612 BC after Assyria had been greatly weakened by a bitter series of internal civil wars between rival claimants to the throne. Its former subjects took advantage of these events and freed themselves from the Assyrian yoke. Assyria was attacked in 616 BC by allied forces of Medes, Scythians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Persians, Cimmerians and Elamites. Nineveh was besieged and sacked in 612 BC. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s son Sin-shar-ishkun (the third of four kings to rule after Ashurbanipal) was then ruling as king of Assyria. He was probably killed defending his city in the sack, though records are fragmentary. Ashur-uballit II succeeded him as the last king of an independent Assyria, ruling from Harran, the last capital of Assyria until 605 BC. Assyria survived as an occupied province and geo-political entity until it was dissolved after the Arab Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century AD. The area is still inhabited by a now Christian and still Eastern Aramaic-speaking indigenous Assyrian minority today.

==Alleged tomb==
On the eve of the battle of Issus (333 BC), Alexander&#x27;s biographers say, Alexander the Great was shown what purported to be the tomb of Sardanapalus at Anchialus in Cilicia, with a relief carving of the king clapping his hands and a cuneiform inscription that the locals translated for him as &quot;Sardanapalus, son of Anakyndaraxes, built Anchialus and Tarsus in a single day; stranger, eat, drink and make love, as other human things are not worth this&quot; (signifying the clap of the hands). Several writers, including Cicero, Strabo, Plutarch, Dio Chrysostom and Athenaeus mention different variations of this epitaph.

Historically, there is no record of any Assyrian king dying or being buried in Cilicia.

==In art and literature==
In the Epitome of Book LXXX of Cassius Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot;, the Roman emperor Elagabalus, considered by the author supremely dissolute and rakish, is frequently called Sardanapalus.

In the introductory pages of Book I of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, those who (erroneously, according to Aristotle) equate the good life with the life of brute pleasure are likened to Sardanapalus.

The death of Sardanapalus was the subject of a Romantic period painting by the 19th-century French painter Eugène Delacroix, &quot;The Death of Sardanapalus&quot;, which was itself based on the 1821 play &quot;Sardanapalus&quot; by Byron, which in turn was based on Diodorus.

In Act 4 of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust II&quot;, Faust responds with the exclamation &quot;Sardanapalus!&quot; to Mephistopheles&#x27; guess of what it is that Faust strives after. Mephistopheles offers up the life of pleasure as Faust&#x27;s life&#x27;s goal.

E. H. Coleridge, in his notes on the works of Byron, states, &quot;It is hardly necessary to remind the modern reader that the Sardanapalus of history is an unverified if not an unverifiable personage... The character which Ctesias depicted or invented, an effeminate debauchee, sunk in luxury and sloth, who at the last was driven to take up arms, and, after a prolonged but ineffectual resistance, avoided capture by suicide, cannot be identified&quot;.

Sardanapalus is a hero in &quot;The Fall of Nineveh&quot; by Edwin Atherstone. He is portrayed as a criminal who ordered one hundred prisoners of war to be executed and burned his palace with all his concubines inside.

Hector Berlioz, the 19th-century French Romantic composer, wrote a very early cantata, &quot;Sardanapale&quot; on the subject of the death of Sardanapalus. Written during the July Revolution of 1830, it was his fourth and finally successful attempt in the Prix de Rome competition, run by the Paris Conservatoire. Only a fragment of the score survives.

Franz Liszt began an (incomplete) opera on the subject in 1850, &quot;Sardanapalo,&quot; Act 1 of which had its world premiere only in 2018, almost a century and a half after the composer&#x27;s death.

Henry David Thoreau, writes in &quot;Walden&quot;, &quot;It is the luxurious and dissipated who set the fashions which the herd so diligently follow. The traveller who stops at the best houses, so called, soon discovers this, for the publicans presume him to be a Sardanapalus, and if he resigned himself to their tender mercies he would soon be completely emasculated.&quot;

In &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, Charles Dickens describes the French Court, and by extension the French Monarchy and upper class: &quot;It had never been a good eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer&#x27;s pride, Sardanapalus&#x27;s luxury, and a mole&#x27;s blindness...&quot;.

In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot;, XV.107-108, &quot;Sardanapalus had not yet come to show to what use bedrooms can be put.&quot; (That is, society had not reached such extremes of decadence.)

In Maxim Gorky&#x27;s 1902 play, &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;, Satine calls The Actor &quot;Sardanapalus&quot;, when asking him to have a drink, in reference to his decadence. 

The legend of Sardanapulus was very loosely adapted as the basis of the 1962 Italian peplum film &quot;Le sette folgori di Assur&quot; (English title: &quot;War Gods of Babylon&quot;). The film anachronistically portrays as contemporaries several figures who historically lived hundreds of years apart.

<text>Johannes Martini (c. 1440 – late 1497 or early 1498) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance.

==Life==
He was born in Brabant around 1440, but information about his early life is scanty. He probably received his early training in Flanders, as did most of the composers of his generation. Sometime before 1473 he became associated with the ducal chapel in Ferrara, Italy, where Ercole I d&#x27;Este was attempting to build a musical establishment on the part of some of the other aristocratic centers in Italy.

He was a member of the famous Milan chapel of the Sforza family in July 1474, along with Loyset Compère, Gaspar van Weerbeke, and some of the other composers from northern Europe who were part of the first wave of Franco-Flemish influence in Italy. In November he returned to Ferrara. What prompted him to leave and return is not known, but since the Milanese chapel was then the most renowned in Europe, it is possible he went to investigate the competition for his employer as much as to improve his own singing and compositional skill. However he must have returned to Milan, since he is listed along with Jean Japart, Colinet de Lannoy, and Compère, to be given a safe pass for exit from Milan on 6 February 1477, following the 1476 assassination of Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza.

Martini was well-rewarded by his employer, receiving not only an unusually large salary for his position in the chapel, but his own house in Ferrara.

In 1486 he traveled to Hungary as part of the group from Ferrara involved in the installation of a d&#x27;Este as Archbishop of Esztergom, and in 1487 and 1488 he made two separate trips to Rome to negotiate the benefices given to him by Duke Ercole.

==Music and influence==
Martini wrote Masses, motets, psalms, hymns, and some secular songs, including chansons. His style is conservative, sometimes referring back to the music of the Burgundian School, especially in the Masses. Some stylistic similarity to Obrecht suggests that the two may have known each other, or at the very least Martini may have seen Obrecht&#x27;s music. Obrecht was a guest in Ferrara in 1487, and his music is known to have circulated in Italy in the early 1480s.

Some of the earliest examples of the paraphrase Mass are by Martini. His &quot;Missa domenicalis&quot; and &quot;Missa ferialis&quot;, which have been tentatively dated to the 1470s at the earliest, use paraphrase technique in the tenor voice – the normal voice for carrying the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; – but also include the same melodic material in other voices at the start of points of imitation. The paraphrase technique was to become one of the predominant methods of mass composition in the early 16th century.

In addition to his mostly conservative output of masses, he is the first composer known to have set psalms for double choir singing antiphonally. This style, which was to become famous in Venice under the direction of Adrian Willaert seventy years later, seems to have had no influence at the time: yet it was a striking innovation.

His secular music is in both French and Italian.

<text>Rittenhouse is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the southern part of the Moon&#x27;s far side. It lies amidst the western outer s of the immense walled plain Schrödinger. To the west is the prominent crater Hale, just visible from the Earth along the lunar limb.

This is a rounded but not quite circular formation, with a slightly boxy appearance. The rim edge is sharply defined and has received little wear from minor impacts. The inner wall is almost featureless, sloping smoothly down to the rugged and irregular interior.

This crater is named after David Rittenhouse.

<text>Elizabeth David ( Gwynne, 26 December 1913 – 22 May 1992) was a British cookery writer. In the mid-20th century she strongly influenced the revitalisation of home cookery in her native country and beyond with articles and books about European cuisines and traditional British dishes.

Born to an upper-class family, David rebelled against social norms of the day. In the 1930s she studied art in Paris, became an actress, and ran off with a married man with whom she sailed in a small boat to Italy, where their boat was confiscated. They reached Greece, where they were nearly trapped by the German invasion in 1941, but escaped to Egypt, where they parted. She then worked for the British government, running a library in Cairo. While there she married, but she and her husband separated soon after and subsequently divorced.

In 1946 David returned to England, where food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained in force. Dismayed by the contrast between the bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food to which she had become accustomed in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write magazine articles about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, at the age of 36, she published &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot;. Her recipes called for ingredients such as aubergines, basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, to over-elaborate cooking, and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973.

David&#x27;s reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on. David&#x27;s influence on British cooking extended to professional as well as domestic cooks, and chefs and restaurateurs of later generations such as Terence Conran, Simon Hopkinson, Prue Leith, Jamie Oliver, Tom Parker Bowles and Rick Stein have acknowledged her importance to them. In the US, cooks and writers including Julia Child, Richard Olney and Alice Waters have written of her influence.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

David was born Elizabeth Gwynne, the second of four children, all daughters, of Rupert Sackville Gwynne and his wife, the Hon Stella Gwynne, daughter of the 1st Viscount Ridley. Both parents&#x27; families had considerable fortunes, the Gwynnes from engineering and land speculation and the Ridleys from coal mining. Through the two families, David was of English, Scottish and Welsh or Irish descent and, through an ancestor on her father&#x27;s side, also Dutch and Sumatran. She and her sisters grew up at Wootton Manor in Sussex, a seventeenth-century manor house with extensive, early twentieth-century additions by Detmar Blow. Her father, despite having a weak heart, insisted on pursuing a demanding political career, becoming Conservative MP for Eastbourne, and a junior minister in Bonar Law&#x27;s government. Overwork, combined with his vigorous recreational pastimes, chiefly racing, riding, and womanising, brought about his death in 1924, aged 51.

The widowed Stella Gwynne was a dutiful mother, but her relations with her daughters were distant rather than affectionate. Elizabeth and her sisters, Priscilla, Diana and Felicité were sent away to boarding schools. Having been a pupil at Godstowe preparatory school in High Wycombe, Elizabeth was sent to St Clare&#x27;s Private School for Ladies, Tunbridge Wells, which she left at the age of sixteen. The girls grew up knowing nothing of cooking, which in upper-class households of the time was the exclusive province of the family&#x27;s cook and her kitchen staff.

As a teenager David enjoyed painting, and her mother thought her talent worth developing. In 1930 she was sent to Paris, where she studied painting privately and enrolled at the Sorbonne for a course in French civilisation which covered history, literature and architecture. She found her Sorbonne studies arduous and in many ways uninspiring, but they left her with a love of French literature and a fluency in the language that remained with her throughout her life. She lodged with a Parisian family, whose fanatical devotion to the pleasures of the table she portrayed to comic effect in her &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot; (1960). Nevertheless, she acknowledged in retrospect that the experience had been the most valuable part of her time in Paris: &quot;I realized in what way the family had fulfilled their task of instilling French culture into at least one of their British charges. Forgotten were the Sorbonne professors. ... What had stuck was the taste for a kind of food quite ideally unlike anything I had known before.&quot; Stella Gwynne was not eager for her daughter&#x27;s early return to England after qualifying for her Sorbonne diploma, and sent her from Paris to Munich in 1931 to study German.

===Actress===
After returning to England in 1932 David unenthusiastically went through the social rituals for upper-class young women of presentation at court as a débutante and the associated balls. The respectable young Englishmen she met at the latter did not appeal to her. David&#x27;s biographer Lisa Chaney comments that with her &quot;delicately smouldering looks and her shyness shielded by a steely coolness and barbed tongue&quot; she would have been a daunting prospect for the young upper-class men she encountered. David decided that she was not good enough as a painter and, to her mother&#x27;s displeasure, became an actress. She joined J. B. Fagan&#x27;s company at the Oxford Playhouse in 1933. Her fellow performers included Joan Hickson, who decades later recalled having to show her new colleague how to make a cup of tea, so unaware of the kitchen was David in those days.
From Oxford, David moved to the Open Air Theatre in Regent&#x27;s Park, London, the following year. She rented rooms in a large house near the park, spent a generous 21st birthday present on equipping the kitchen, and learned to cook. A gift from her mother of &quot;The Gentle Art of Cookery&quot; by Hilda Leyel was her first cookery book. She later wrote, &quot;I wonder if I would have ever learned to cook at all if I had been given a routine Mrs Beeton to learn from, instead of the romantic Mrs Leyel with her rather wild, imagination-catching recipes.&quot;

At Regent&#x27;s Park David made little professional progress. The company was distinguished, headed by Nigel Playfair and Jack Hawkins, and, in the leading female roles, Anna Neagle and Margaretta Scott. David was restricted to bit parts. Among her colleagues in the company was an actor nine years her senior, Charles Gibson Cowan. His disregard for social conventions appealed strongly to her, and she also found him sexually irresistible. His being married did not daunt either of them, and they began an affair that outlasted her stage career. Chaney comments, &quot;Cowan was the ultimate outsider. He was working class, left wing, Jewish, an actor, a pickpocket, a vagabond, who lived in caves in Hastings for a time. Her mother called him a &#x27;pacifist worm&#x27;. He was a sexual presence, and slept with anything that moved.&quot; David&#x27;s mother strongly disapproved, and tried to put a stop to the affair. She arranged for her daughter to spend several weeks holidaying with family and friends in Malta in the first half of 1936 and in Egypt later in the same year, but in her 1999 biography Artemis Cooper comments that David&#x27;s lengthy absence failed to detach her from her involvement with Cowan. During her stay in Malta, David was able to spend time learning from her hostess&#x27;s cook, Angela, who was happy to pass on her expertise. Although she could produce elaborate grand dinners when required, the most important lesson she taught David was to work day in, day out, with all available ingredients, showing her how to make an old bird or a stringy piece of meat into a good dish.

===France, Greece, Egypt and India===
After her return to London in early 1937, David recognised that she was not going to be a success on the stage, and abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where elegant young women from upper-class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a small boat—a yawl with an engine—with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.

The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 halted their progress. After stopping briefly at Marseille they sailed on to Antibes, where they remained for more than six months, unable to gain permission to leave. There David met and became greatly influenced by the ageing writer Norman Douglas, about whom she later wrote extensively. He inspired her love of the Mediterranean, encouraged her interest in good food, and taught her to &quot;search out the best, insist on it, and reject all that was bogus and second-rate&quot;. Cooper describes him as David&#x27;s most important mentor.

David and Cowan finally left Antibes in May 1940, sailing to Corsica and then towards Sicily. They had reached the Strait of Messina when Italy entered the war on 10 June. They were suspected of spying and were interned. After 19 days in custody in various parts of Italy, they were allowed to cross the border into Yugoslavia, which at that point remained neutral and non-combatant. They had lost almost everything they owned—the boat, money, manuscripts, notebooks, and David&#x27;s cherished collection of recipes. With the help of the British Consul in Zagreb, they crossed into Greece, and arrived in Athens in July 1940. By this time, David was no longer in love with her partner but remained with him from necessity. Cowan found a job teaching English on the island of Syros, where David learnt to cook with the fresh ingredients available locally. When the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941, the couple managed to leave on a civilian convoy to Egypt.

Able to speak excellent French and good German, David secured a job in the naval cipher office in Alexandria. She was quickly rescued from temporary refugee accommodation, having met an old English friend who had an &quot;absurdly grandiose&quot; flat in the city and invited her to keep house for him. She and Cowan amicably went their separate ways, and she moved into the grand flat. She engaged a cook, Kyriacou, a Greek refugee, whose eccentricities (sketched in a chapter of &quot;Is There a Nutmeg in the House?&quot;) did not prevent him from producing magnificent food: &quot;The flavour of that octopus stew, the rich wine dark sauce and the aroma of mountain herbs was something not easily forgotten.&quot; In 1942 she caught an infection that affected her feet. She spent some weeks in hospital and felt obliged to give up her job in the cipher office. She then moved to Cairo, where she was asked to set up and run a reference library for the British Ministry of Information. The library was open to everyone and was much in demand by journalists and other writers. Her circle of friends in this period included Alan Moorehead, Freya Stark, Bernard Spencer, Patrick Kinross, Olivia Manning and Lawrence Durrell. At her tiny flat in the city, she employed Suleiman, a Sudanese &quot;suffragi&quot; (a cook-housekeeper). She recalled:
Cooper comments on this period of David&#x27;s life, &quot;Pictures of her at the time show a quintessential librarian, dressed in a dark cardigan over a white shirt with a prim little collar buttoned up to the neck: but at night, dressed in exotic spangled caftans, she was a different creature: drinking at Hedjaki&#x27;s bar, eating at the P&#x27;tit Coin de France, dancing on the roof of the Continental and then going on to Madame Badia&#x27;s nightclub or the glamorous Auberge des Pyramides.&quot; In her years in Cairo, David had a number of affairs. She enjoyed them for what they were, but only once fell in love. That was with a young officer, Peter Laing, but the relationship came to an end when he was seriously wounded and returned to his native Canada. Several other of her young men fell in love with her; one of them was Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony David (1911–1967). By now aged thirty, she weighed the advantages and disadvantages of remaining unmarried until such time as the ideal husband might appear, and with considerable misgivings she finally accepted Tony David&#x27;s proposal of marriage.

The couple were married in Cairo on 30 August 1944. Within a year, Tony David was posted to India. His wife followed him there in January 1946, but she found life as the wife of an officer of the British Raj tedious, the social life dull, and the food generally &quot;frustrating&quot;. Later in life she came to appreciate the cuisine more, and wrote about a few Indian dishes and recipes in her articles and books. In June 1946, she suffered severe sinusitis and was told by her doctors that the condition would persist if she remained in the summer heat of Delhi. Instead, she was advised to go back to England. She did so; Cooper observes, &quot;She had been away from England for six years, and in that time she, and England, had changed beyond recognition.&quot;

===Post-war England===
Returning after her years of Mediterranean warmth and access to a profusion of fresh ingredients, David found her native country in the post-war period grey and daunting, with food rationing still in force. She encountered terrible food: &quot;There was flour and water soup seasoned solely with pepper; bread and gristle rissoles; dehydrated onions and carrots; corned beef toad in the hole. I need not go on.&quot; In London, she met George Lassalle, a former lover of hers from Cairo days, and their affair was rekindled. The couple went to Ross-on-Wye in November 1946 for a week&#x27;s break, but were stranded in the town by the season&#x27;s inclement weather. Frustrated by the poor food provided by the hotel, she was encouraged by Lassalle to put her thoughts on paper.

Hardly knowing what I was doing ... I sat down and started to work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down descriptions of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I came to realize that in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.

When her husband returned from India in 1947, David immediately separated from Lassalle and resumed the role of wife. With the aid of Stella Gwynne, David and her husband bought a house in Chelsea, which remained her home for the rest of her life. Tony David proved ineffectual in civilian life, unable to find a suitable job; he ran up debts, partly from a failed business venture. What remained of the spark in the relationship soon died, and they were living separately by 1948.

Veronica Nicholson, a friend with connections in the publishing trade, persuaded David to continue writing, with the aim that she write a book. She showed some of David&#x27;s work to Anne Scott-James, the editor of the British edition of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, who thought the writing showed a widely travelled person with an independent mind. She offered David a contract, and David&#x27;s work began appearing in the publication from March 1949.

David told Scott-James that she planned to publish the articles as a book, and was allowed to retain the copyright by the magazine. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume called &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot;; many of the recipes ignored the restrictions of rationing in favour of authenticity, and in several cases the ingredients were not available in British shops. David submitted her manuscript to a series of publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text. David took this advice, but conscious of her inexperience as a writer she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery; he accepted it and agreed to an advance payment of £100. &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; was published in June 1950.
&quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; was illustrated by John Minton; writers including Cyril Ray and John Arlott commented that the drawings added to the attractions of the book. Martin Salisbury, the professor of illustration at the Cambridge School of Art, writes that Minton&#x27;s &quot;brilliant, neo-romantic designs perfectly complement the writing&quot;. David placed great importance on the illustration of books, and described Minton&#x27;s jacket design as &quot;stunning&quot;. She was especially taken with &quot;his beautiful Mediterranean bay, his tables spread with white cloths and bright fruit&quot; and the way that &quot;pitchers and jugs and bottles of wine could be seen far down the street&quot;; she considered the cover design aided the success of the book, but was less convinced by his black and white drawings.

The book was well received by reviewers. Elizabeth Nicholas, writing for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, thought David a &quot;gastronome of rare integrity&quot; who &quot;refuses ... to make any ignoble compromises with expediency&quot;. Although John Chandos, writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, pointed out that &quot;Let no one eating in London—with whatever abandon—imagine that he is eating Mediterranean food in the absence of Mediterranean earth and air&quot;, he finished his review by saying that the book &quot;deserves to become the familiar companion of all who seek uninhibited excitement in the kitchen&quot;.

The success of the book led to offers of work from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;—for which she was paid an advance of 60 guineas—&quot;Go&quot;, a travel magazine owned by the newspaper, and &quot;Wine and Food&quot;, the journal of the Wine and Food Society. In August 1950 David and her husband went on their final holiday together with the money from the new contracts, although they had trouble with the car they were using for touring and the holiday was unsuccessful. On her return she invited Felicité, her youngest sister, to move into the top flat in her house. David was a reluctant and unskilful typist—she preferred the feel of writing with a pen—and in exchange for a low rent, Felicité expertly typed her articles and books, and later acted as her principal researcher.

&quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; was successful enough for Lehmann to commission David to write a sequel, to show the dishes of rural France. This was &quot;French Country Cooking&quot;, which David finished writing in October 1950. Minton was employed to illustrate the work, and David gave him detailed instructions about the type of drawings; she was more pleased with them than those for her first work. Despite their difficult relationship, David dedicated the book to her mother. Before the book was published, David left England to live for a short time in France. She was motivated by a desire to gain a wider knowledge of life in the French countryside, and to put distance between her and her husband. She left London in March 1951 for Ménerbes, Provence. She spent three months in Provence; although the weather was initially cold and wet, it soon turned warmer and she enjoyed herself so much that she considered buying a house there. In June 1951 she left Ménerbes and travelled to the island of Capri to visit Norman Douglas. When she left in late August, she toured briefly around the Italian Riviera researching for an article for &quot;Go&quot;, before returning to London.

In September, shortly after her return, &quot;French Country Cooking&quot; was published. It was warmly reviewed by critics, although Lucie Marion, writing in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, considered that &quot;I cannot think that Mrs David has tried actually to make many of the dishes for which she gives recipes&quot;. David wrote to the paper to set the record straight, saying that it would have been &quot;irresponsible and mischievous&quot; if she had not tested them all.

===Italian, French and other cuisines===
Lehmann and David agreed that her next book should be about Italian food; at the time, little was known in Britain about Italian cuisine and interest in the country was on the rise. She received an advance of £300 for the book. She planned to visit Italy for research, and wanted to see Douglas in Capri again, but received news of his death in February 1952, which left her deeply saddened.

David left London in March, arriving in Rome just before the Easter celebrations. She toured the country, watching cooks at home and in restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his still lifes, she asked if he would illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word and produced a series of illustrations.

Arriving back in London in October 1952, David began a relationship with an old flame from India, Peter Higgins, a divorced stockbroker; it was the beginning of the happiest period of her life. She spent the following months writing the book, recreating the recipes to work out the correct measurements. She felt less emotionally connected to Italy than with Greece and southern France and found the writing &quot;uncommonly troublesome&quot;, although &quot;as recipe after recipe came out ... I realized how much I was learning, and how enormously these dishes were enlarging my own scope and enjoyment&quot;. &quot;Italian Food&quot; was published in November 1954. At the time, many of the ingredients used in the recipes were still difficult to obtain in Britain. Looking back in 1963, David wrote:

In Soho but almost nowhere else, such things as Italian &quot;pasta&quot;, and Parmesan cheese, olive oil, &quot;salame&quot;, and occasionally Parma ham were to be had. ... With southern vegetables such as aubergines, red and green peppers, fennel, the tiny marrows called by the French &quot;courgettes&quot; and in Italy &quot;zucchini&quot;, much the same situation prevailed.
&quot;Italian Food&quot; was warmly received by reviewers and the public, and the first print run sold out within three weeks. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;&#x27;s reviewer wrote, &quot;More than a collection of recipes, this book is in effect a readable and discerning dissertation on Italian food and regional dishes, and their preparation in the English kitchen.&quot; Freya Stark, reviewing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, remarked, &quot;Mrs David ... may be counted among the benefactors of humanity.&quot; In &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Evelyn Waugh named &quot;Italian Food&quot; as one of the two books that had given him the most pleasure in 1954.

By the time she completed &quot;Italian Food&quot;, Lehmann&#x27;s publishing firm had been closed down by its parent company, and David found herself under contract to Macdonald, another imprint within the same group. She intensely disliked the company and wrote a most unflattering portrait of it in a 1985 article. Disapproving of the approach to her books that the company took, her agent, Paul Scott, persuaded Macdonald to relinquish their option on the next book. David signed instead with the publisher Museum Press for her next book, &quot;Summer Cooking&quot;, which was published in 1955.

&quot;Summer Cooking&quot; was illustrated by David&#x27;s friend, the artist Adrian Daintrey. He would visit her at home and sketch her in the kitchen while she cooked a lunch for them both. Unconstrained by the geographical agendas of her first three books, David wrote about dishes from Britain, India, Mauritius, Russia, Spain and Turkey, as well as France, Italy and Greece. The book reflected her strong belief in eating food in season; she loved &quot;the pleasure of rediscovering each season&#x27;s vegetables&quot; and thought it &quot;rather dull to eat the same food all year round&quot;. She said that her aim was to put:

emphasis on two aspects of cookery which are increasingly disregarded: the suitability of certain foods to certain times of the year, and the pleasures of eating the vegetables, fruits, poultry, meat or fish which is in season, therefore at its best, most plentiful, and cheapest.

Soon after the publication of &quot;Summer Cooking&quot;, David was wooed away from her regular column in &quot;Harper&quot;″s by &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, which offered her more money and more prominence—a full central page with a continuing column following, and a full page photograph. The new contract meant she also wrote for &quot;Vogue&quot;″s sister magazine &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot;. Audrey Withers, the editor of &quot;Vogue&quot;, wanted David to write more personal columns than she had done for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients and from time to time £100 for research trips to France.

David visited several areas of France, completing her research for her next book, &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot;, which was &quot;the culmination and synthesis of a decade of work and thought&quot;. Published in 1960, it is, according to Cooper in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, the book for which she would be best remembered. David&#x27;s agent negotiated contracts with a new publisher, Michael Joseph, and a new illustrator, Juliet Renny.

Reviews of the new book were as complimentary as those for its predecessors. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot; needs to be read rather than referred to quickly. It discourses at some length on the type and origin of the dishes popular in various French regions, as well as the culinary terms, herbs and kitchen equipment used in France. But those who can give the extra time to this book will be well repaid by dishes such as &quot;La Bourride de Charles Bérot&quot; and &quot;Cassoulet Colombié&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot; said that it was difficult to think of any home that could do without the book and called David &quot;a very special kind of genius&quot;.

&quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot; was dedicated to Peter Higgins, still her lover. David&#x27;s estranged husband had lived in Spain since 1953 and, to his wife&#x27;s embarrassment, he was named in a divorce case which was reported in the gossip column of &quot;The Daily Express&quot;. In an interview published in the newspaper, Tony had referred to David as &quot;my ex-wife&quot;; she filed for divorce, and the process was finalised in 1960.

===1960s===
In 1960 David stopped writing for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, as she was unhappy about editorial interference with her copy; soon afterwards she also left &quot;Vogue&quot; as the change in direction of the magazine did not suit the style of her column. She joined the weekly publications &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. Her books were now reaching a wide public, having been reprinted in paperback by the mass-market publisher Penguin Books, where they sold more than a million copies between 1955 and 1985. Her work also had an impact on British food culture: the historian Peter Clarke considers that &quot;The seminal influence of Elizabeth David&#x27;s &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot; (1960), with its enormous sales as a Penguin paperback, deserves historical recognition.&quot; Cooper considers that David&#x27;s &quot;professional career was at its height. She was hailed not only as Britain&#x27;s foremost writer on food and cookery, but as the woman who had transformed the eating habits of middle-class England.&quot;

David&#x27;s private life was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins came to an end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to sleeping pills. Probably as a result of these factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of the smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.

In November 1965, together with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico. The partners were spurred on by the closure of a professional kitchenware shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of Terence Conran&#x27;s Habitat shops, which sold among much else imported kitchen equipment for which there was evidently a market. Among her customers were Albert and Michel Roux, who shopped there for equipment that they would otherwise have had to buy in France.

David, who selected the stock, was uncompromising in her choice of merchandise; despite its large range of kitchen implements, the shop did not stock either wall-mounted knife sharpeners or garlic presses. David wrote an article called &quot;Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless&quot;, refused to sell them, and advised customers who demanded them to go elsewhere. Not available elsewhere, by contrast, were booklets by David printed specially for the shop. Some of them were later incorporated into the collections of her essays and articles, &quot;An Omelette and a Glass of Wine&quot; and &quot;Is There a Nutmeg in the House?&quot; The shop was described in &quot;The Observer&quot; as:

... starkly simple. Pyramids of French coffee cups and English pot-bellied iron pans stand in the window. ... Iron shelves hold tin moulds and cutters of every description, glazed and unglazed earthenware pots, bowls and dishes in traditional colours, plain pots and pans in thick aluminium, cast-iron, vitreous enamel and fireproof porcelain, unadorned crockery in classic shapes and neat rows of cooks&#x27; knives, spoons and forks.

David reduced her writing commitments to concentrate on running the shop, but contributed some articles to magazines, and began to focus more on English cuisine. She still included many recipes but increasingly wrote about places—markets, &quot;&quot;, farms—and people, including profiles of famous chefs and gourmets such as Marcel Boulestin and Édouard de Pomiane. In her later articles, she expressed strongly held views on a wide range of subjects; she abominated the word &quot;crispy&quot;, demanding to know what it conveyed that &quot;crisp&quot; did not; she confessed to an inability to refill anybody&#x27;s wineglass until it was empty; she insisted on the traditional form &quot;Welsh rabbit&quot; rather than the modern invention &quot;Welsh rarebit&quot;; she poured scorn on the &quot;Guide Michelin&#x27;s&quot; standards; she deplored &quot;fussy garnish ... distract[ing] from the main flavours&quot;; she inveighed against the &quot;ersatz&quot;: &quot;anyone depraved enough to invent a dish consisting of a wedge of steam-heated bread spread with tomato paste and a piece of synthetic Cheddar can call it a pizza.&quot;

While running the shop, David wrote another full-length book, &quot;Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen&quot; (1970). It was her first book in a decade and the first of a projected series on English cookery to be called &quot;English Cooking, Ancient and Modern&quot;. She had decided to concentrate on the subject while recuperating from her cerebral haemorrhage in 1963. The book was a departure from her earlier works and contained more food history about what she called &quot;the English preoccupation with the spices and the scents, the fruit, the flavourings, the sources and the condiments of the orient, near and far&quot;.

===Later years===
Elizabeth David Ltd was never more than modestly profitable, but David would not lower her standards in search of a commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she was always in the minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from chronic fatigue and swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.

David&#x27;s second book on English food was &quot;English Bread and Yeast Cookery&quot;, which she spent five years researching and writing. The work covered the history of bread-making in England and an examination of each ingredient used. She was angered by the standard of bread in Britain and wrote:

What is utterly dismaying is the mess our milling and baking concerns succeed in making with the dearly bought grain that goes into their grist. Quite simply it is wasted on a nation that cares so little about the quality of its bread that it has allowed itself to be mesmerized into buying the equivalent of eight and a quarter million large white factory-made loaves every day of the year.

In 1977 David was badly injured in a car accident—sustaining a fractured left elbow and right wrist, a damaged knee cap and a broken jaw—from which she took a long time to recover. While she was in hospital, &quot;English Bread and Yeast Cookery&quot; was published. Its scholarship won high praise, and Jane Grigson, writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, suggested that a copy of the book should be given to every marrying couple, while Hilary Spurling, reviewing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, thought that not only was it &quot;a scathing indictment of the British bread industry&quot;, but one done with &quot;orderliness, authority, phenomenal scope and fastidious attention to detail&quot;.

Some of the research David undertook for &quot;English Bread and Yeast Cookery&quot; was done with Jill Norman, her friend and publisher. The pair decided that they should produce two further books: &quot;Ice and Ices&quot; and a collection of David&#x27;s early journalism. Like her book on bread, the scope for &quot;Ice and Ices&quot; grew the more David researched the subject. The compilation of existing essays and press articles took less time, and in 1984 &quot;An Omelette and a Glass of Wine&quot; was published, edited by Norman who became David&#x27;s literary executor and edited further David works after the author&#x27;s death.

The death in 1986 of her younger sister Felicité, who had lived in the top floor of her house for thirty years, was a severe blow to David. She began to suffer from depression and went to the doctor after suffering chest pains; he diagnosed tuberculosis and she was hospitalised. After an uncomfortable time over a three-month stay in hospital, where the drugs she was prescribed had side-effects that affected her clarity of thinking, her friend, the wine importer and writer Gerald Asher, arranged for her to stay with him in California to recuperate.

David made several visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail. Because her legs had been troublesome for some time, she suffered a succession of falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on &quot;Ice and Ices&quot;. She realised that she would not be able to finish the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title &quot;Harvest of the Cold Months&quot;.

In May 1992 David suffered a stroke followed two days later by another, which was fatal; she died at her Chelsea home on 22 May 1992, aged 78. She was buried on 28 May at the family church of St Peter ad Vincula, Folkington. That September a memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, followed by a memorial picnic at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. In February 1994 David&#x27;s possessions were put up for auction. Many of those who attended—and who bid—were fans of David&#x27;s work, rather than professional dealers. Prue Leith paid £1,100 for David&#x27;s old kitchen table because it was &quot;where she cooked her omelettes and wrote most of her books&quot;. The auction&#x27;s total receipts were three times the expected value.

==Books==

From 1950 onwards David was well known for her magazine articles and, in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, for her kitchen shop, but her reputation rested and still rests principally on her books. The first five, published between 1950 and 1960, cover the cuisine of continental Europe and beyond. In the 1970s David wrote two books about English cooking. The last of her books published in her lifetime was a collection of previously-printed essays and articles. From the extensive notes and archives left by the author, her literary executor, Jill Norman, edited and completed four more books that David had planned. Six other books published since the author&#x27;s death have been compilations drawn from her existing works.

On the advice of her publisher, David constructed her early books to intersperse recipes with relevant excerpts of travel writing and scene-painting by earlier writers, and, as her confidence and reputation grew, by herself. &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; (1950) draws on nine authors, from Henry James to Théophile Gautier, in between eleven sections of recipes. Reviewers commented that David&#x27;s books possessed literary merit as well as practical instruction.

Some critics, used to more prescriptive cookery writers, thought her approach assumed too much knowledge on the part of the reader. In her view, &quot;The ideal cookery writer is one who makes his readers want to cook as well as telling them how it is done; he should leave something, not too much perhaps, but a little, unsaid: people must make their own discoveries, use their own intelligence, otherwise they will be deprived of part of the fun.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot; Craig Claiborne wrote admiringly of David, but remarked that because she assumed her readers already knew the basics of cooking she would be &quot;valued more by those with a serious regard for food than by those with a casual interest&quot;. The writer Julian Barnes commented that as an amateur cook he found David&#x27;s terse instructions intimidating: of a recipe in &quot;Italian Food&quot; he wrote, &quot;E.D.&#x27;s first sentence reads like this: &#x27;Melt 1½ lbs (675 g) chopped and skinned tomatoes in olive oil&#x27; ... &quot;Melt? Melt a tomato?&quot; ... Could it be that Elizabeth David was too good a writer to be a food writer?&quot;. A later cook, Tom Parker Bowles, observes, &quot;You don&#x27;t turn to Elizabeth David for nannying, step-by-step instruction, or precise amounts and timing. She assumes you know the basics, and is a writer who offers inspiration, and wonderful, opinionated prose. Her recipes are timeless, and all her books wonderful works of reference (and tirelessly researched) as well as beautiful reads.&quot;

The eight books and eight booklets by David published in her lifetime cover the food of France; Italy; the rest of the Mediterranean and beyond, into Asia; and England.

===France===
Two of David&#x27;s best-known books focus on the cuisine of France: &quot;French Country Cooking&quot; (1951) and &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot; (1960); France features prominently, though not exclusively, in another two: &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; (1950) and &quot;Summer Cooking&quot; (1955). She set the pattern for her books by grouping recipes by category, with sections linked by her chosen passages from literature. In her first book, &quot;Mediterranean Food&quot;, David presented chapters on soups; eggs and luncheon dishes; fish; meat; substantial dishes; poultry and game; vegetables; cold food and salads; sweets; jams, chutneys and preserves; and sauces. She broadly followed this pattern in her next four books.
David&#x27;s view on the place of French cooking in the hierarchy of world cuisine is set out in her introduction to &quot;French Country Cooking&quot;: &quot;French regional and peasant cookery ... at its best, is the most delicious in the world; cookery which uses raw materials to the greatest advantage without going to the absurd lengths of the complicated and so-called &quot;Haute Cuisine&quot;.&quot; She was a firm believer in the traditional French approach to buying and preparing food:

Though not neglecting elaborate dishes—she devoted six pages to the choice of ingredients for and cooking of pot-au-feu or lièvre à la Royale (a salmis of hare)—David regarded simple everyday cooking as in some ways more demanding, and gave many recipes for &quot;the kind of food which is eaten frequently in thrifty French households, and it is very good&quot;.

David emphasised the importance to cooks of careful and knowledgeable shopping for ingredients. She wrote chapters about French markets such as those at Cavaillon, Yvetot, Montpellier, Martigues and Valence. Despite a widespread perception that her view of food was essentially Mediterranean, &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot;, by far her longest book to date, surveyed the cuisine of France from Normandy and the Île-de-France to Alsace, Burgundy, the Loire, Bordeaux and the Basque Country, as well as the south. Looking at the entire field of cookery books, Jane Grigson regarded this as &quot;the best and most stimulating of them all&quot;.

===Italy===
Unlike its two predecessors, &quot;Mediterranean Food&quot; and &quot;French Country Cooking&quot;, David&#x27;s &quot;Italian Food&quot; (1954) drew little from anything she had already written. She spent many months in Italy researching it before starting work on the manuscript. With two successful books already published, David felt less in need of extracts from earlier writers to bolster her prose, and interspersed the recipes with her own essays and introductions to the various sections. The book begins with a chapter on &quot;The Italian store cupboard&quot;, giving British cooks, who at that time were generally unacquainted with most of Italy&#x27;s cuisine and methods, an insight into Italian herbs, spices, tinned, bottled or dried staples including anchovies, tuna, &quot;&quot;, prosciutto, and chickpeas, and Italian essentials such as garlic and olive oil, both seldom seen in Britain in the early 1950s. The rest of the book follows the basic pattern of the earlier works, with chapters on soups, fish, meat, vegetables and sweets, with the addition of extra subjects relevant to Italian food, pasta asciuta, ravioli and gnocchi, rice, and Italian wine.

In addition to those in &quot;Italian Food&quot;, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions of the land and the people in David&#x27;s other works. The first recipe in her first book, &quot;Mediterranean Food&quot;—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in &quot;Summer Cooking&quot; is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David&#x27;s works. In &quot;An Omelette and a Glass of Wine&quot;, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. &quot;Is There a Nutmeg in the House?&quot; includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.

===Other Mediterranean lands and beyond===
When David&#x27;s first book, &quot;Mediterranean Food&quot;, was published in 1950 the British public was still enduring food rationing after the Second World War. Her evocation of the everyday plenty and excellence of Mediterranean food was revelatory, and although she did not reach a wide public until cheap paperback editions of her books came out in the mid 1950s, reviewers immediately spotted her importance.

In the introduction to &quot;Mediterranean Food&quot; David set out her basic premise: &quot;The cooking of the Mediterranean shores, endowed with all the natural resources, the colour and flavour of the South, is a blend of tradition and brilliant improvisation. The Latin genius flashes from the kitchen pans. It is honest cooking, too; none of the sham Grande Cuisine of the International Palace Hotel.&quot; She conceded, nevertheless, that the food culture of the Mediterranean was not exclusively Latin, and flowered in &quot;the mainland of Greece and the much-disputed territories of Syria, the Lebanon, Constantinople and Smyrna&quot;. She described the ever-recurring elements in the food throughout these countries as:


In her other books David gives recipes from around the Mediterranean, including gazpacho and tortillas from Spain; dolmádés, and eggs with skordalia from Greece, mutton-stuffed aubergines, yoghurt soup, and a stew of carrots and rice from Turkey; and a Syrian dish of chicken with almonds and cream. From further afield she includes Mauritian prawn chutney; iced cucumber and beetroot soup from Russia; a Persian maqlub of aubergines, rice and mutton; Sikh kebabs and garam masala from India; and Armenian pizza, claimed to be older than the Italian version.

In a 2012 survey for the Australasian Universities Language and Literature Association, Carody Culver writes, &quot;It is David&#x27;s language, particularly her use of description that most strongly enforces the narrative and literary quality of &quot;Mediterranean Food&quot;. Her imagery, anecdotes, and literary quotes transform her recipes into stories of experience and memory. ... Ingredients and dishes are not just given as part of a list of instructions, but represented as part of a specific culture.&quot;

===England===
&quot;Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen&quot; (1970) and &quot;English Bread and Yeast Cookery&quot; (1977) include a few British dishes from outside England, such as Scottish Arbroath smokies and bannocks; and Welsh salt duck and bara brith. David, like many of her generation and class, used the terms &quot;England&quot; and &quot;English&quot; to refer to the whole of Britain.

Some writers have believed David neglected the cooking of her own country in favour of Mediterranean cuisine. In the humorous magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, Humphrey Lyttelton held that she preferred &quot;inaccessible and often indigestible &quot;saucissons&quot;&quot; to &quot;the splendid Cumberland sausage&quot;. In 2009 the food writer Tim Hayward accused her of &quot;wide-eyed romantic twaddle&quot;, excessively focused on France and the Mediterranean. Chaney comments that when &quot;Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen&quot; was published in 1970, some of David&#x27;s most ardent admirers were taken aback to find her extolling the British culinary tradition, &quot;at its best ... as rich and rewarding as that of the Mediterranean&quot;. Cooper writes that although the change of focus from French and Mediterranean food to English surprised the public, David had been moving towards it for some time.

David treated her English topics in considerable detail: &quot;Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen&quot; is longer than &quot;Mediterranean Food&quot;, &quot;French Country Cooking&quot; or &quot;Summer Cooking&quot;. She intended it to be the first in a series of three or even five books on English cookery: &quot;It depends how much time I have ... Later volumes will deal with bread, yeast, cakes, creams and cheeses and egg dishes, and meat and game&quot;. They were never written, except for &quot;English Bread and Yeast Cookery&quot;, which is by nearly 100 pages the longest of all David&#x27;s works.

David consciously followed in the path of Hilda Leyel and Dorothy Hartley in researching British ingredients and dishes. Like them, she looked back into regional history to find what she saw as &quot;the traditions of a culture rooted to the soil&quot; before &quot;the ravages of the Industrial Revolution&quot;. She did not romanticise Britain&#x27;s culinary past: &quot;Farm and factory labourers, artisans and clerical workers, still lived on a very restricted diet ... their cooking facilities were so primitive and their equipment so scanty that only the most basic forms of cookery could be attempted&quot;. But her constant benchmarks were honest ingredients and uncomplicated cooking. She condemned—and explained the alternatives to—the artificial, the ersatz, the &quot;notorious Chorleywood bread&quot;, and &quot;all synthetic aids to flavouring ... Nobody has ever been able to find out why the English regard a glass of wine added to a soup or stew as a reckless extravagance and at the same time spend pounds on bottled sauces, gravy powders, soup cubes, ketchups and artificial flavourings&quot;.

Both the English books are in two parts. The first section is historical, putting the subject into context for the modern reader. In &quot;Spices, Salt and Aromatics&quot; David writes about the background of the herbs and spices and condiments that came into use in British kitchens over the previous centuries, and sketches the history of their adoption from Asia and continental Europe. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; called this part of the book &quot;as difficult to put down as a good thriller&quot;. David follows a similar path in &quot;English Bread and Yeast Cookery&quot;; reviewing the book Hilary Spurling wrote that it contained &quot;a history of virtually every development since Stone Age crops and querns&quot;. The second, longer, sections of the two books contain the recipes and descriptions.

===Collections of essays and articles===

Although David had drawn on her many magazine articles for material in her earlier books, &quot;An Omelette and Glass of Wine&quot; (1984) was the first straightforward anthology of her work. Compiled with the assistance of Jill Norman, it consists of David&#x27;s selections from her essays and articles published since 1949.

The article from which the book takes its title is an essay on &quot;the almost primitive and elemental meal evoked by the words: &#x27;Let&#x27;s just have an omelette and a glass of wine. Among the other subjects are profiles of people including Norman Douglas, Marcel Boulestin, Mrs Beeton, and &quot;A gourmet in Edwardian London&quot;, Colonel Nathaniel Newnham-Davis. Several sections are devoted to descriptions of the markets of French country towns, and unpretentious restaurants and hotels in France. There are articles on lemons, potted meat, mayonnaise, pizza, syllabubs, truffles, and on the cuisines of Spain and Morocco. For most of the articles David provided either an introduction or an afternote, or both.

David had intended to publish a second such volume, and eight years after the author&#x27;s death, Norman, her literary executor, published a sequel, &quot;Is There a Nutmeg in the House?&quot; (2000). Like its predecessor, it was drawn from magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings, to which Norman added articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section of the book is a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded her privacy carefully. David&#x27;s interest in the historical aspects of cuisine is given scope in essays on the history of Oxo and Bovril, Alexis Soyer and the potato. Articles aimed at the domestic cook include &quot;Do not Despair over Rice&quot;, &quot;Making Ice Cream&quot;, and one propounding a view for which she was famous: &quot;Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the book &quot;this very appealing, completely absorbing miscellany. ... This is a book good enough to eat—and, in a way, you can.&quot;

===Booklets===
David wrote eight booklets on individual topics. The first two, &quot;The Use of Wine in Fine Cooking&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Use of Wine in Italian Cooking&quot; (1952), were commissioned and published by the wine merchants Saccone and Speed. David reused the first as a chapter in &quot;French Country Cooking&quot;.

For her kitchen equipment shop, David wrote &quot;Dried Herbs, Aromatics and Condiments&quot; (1967); &quot;English Potted Meats and Fish Pastes&quot; (1968); &quot;The Baking of an English Loaf&quot; (1969); &quot;Syllabubs and Fruit Fools&quot; (1969), and &quot;Green Pepper Berries&quot; (1972). Some of the content was taken from her previously-published magazine articles, and some was further reused and expanded in her later books.

David&#x27;s last booklet was &quot;Cooking with Le Creuset&quot; (1989) written for the French manufacturers of Le Creuset cooking ware.

===Posthumous publications===
In addition to &quot;Is There a Nutmeg in the House?&quot; three further books planned by David were completed and edited by Norman after the author died.

&quot;Harvest of the Cold Months&quot; (1994) is subtitled &quot;A social history of ice and ices&quot;. David had been working on it intermittently for several years before her last illnesses. The book traces the history of ice in the cuisines of Europe from mediaeval times, when it had to be brought from the mountains and kept in ice houses. &quot;The Independent&quot;″s reviewer described it as &quot;not a cookery book but an awe-inspiring feat of detective scholarship ... sumptuous and stately&quot;. Reviewing the book in &quot;The Times&quot;, Nigella Lawson wrote that although it deserved a place on the shelves of anyone who cared about food, it revealed a waning of the author&#x27;s energies, and &quot;lacks her customary, high-spirited, if fierce, readability&quot;.

&quot;South Wind Through the Kitchen&quot; (1997) was the completion of one of the projects of David&#x27;s later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David&#x27;s friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David&#x27;s books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David&#x27;s earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in &quot;An Omelette and a Glass of Wine&quot;, and is a reference to &quot;South Wind&quot;, the best-known novel by David&#x27;s mentor Norman Douglas.

The last of the books planned by David was &quot;Elizabeth David&#x27;s Christmas&quot; (2003). She and Norman had discussed such a book as early as the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David&#x27;s death, Norman found when sorting out the author&#x27;s papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. The Christmas recipes David had most often been asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from &quot;Mediterranean Food&quot;, &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot;, and &quot;Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen&quot;, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page work. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks. The book reprints one of David&#x27;s most quoted sentences, first printed in &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1959, and included in &quot;Is there a Nutmeg in the House&quot; in 2000: &quot;If I had my way—and I shan&#x27;t—my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with a glass of champagne on a tray in bed in the evening.&quot;

Between 1995 and 2011 Penguin Books issued four paperback selections from David&#x27;s books: &quot;I&#x27;ll be with You in the Squeezing of a Lemon&quot; (1995), &quot;Peperonata and Other Italian Dishes&quot; (1996), &quot;Of Pageants and Picnics&quot; (2005), and &quot;A Taste of the Sun&quot; (2011).
Two further hardback selections of David&#x27;s writings were published, with Norman as editor. &quot;At Elizabeth David&#x27;s Table&quot; (2010) was published to mark the 60th anniversary of David&#x27;s first book. With prefatory contributions from several prominent British chefs including Hopkinson, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Rose Gray and Jamie Oliver, it comprises recipes and essays from David&#x27;s previously published works. There are twelve chapters, covering the various courses of a dinner from soups to desserts, and other topics such as baking, cooking &quot;fast and fresh&quot;, and David&#x27;s descriptions of French and Italian markets. &quot;Elizabeth David on Vegetables&quot; (2013) was drawn principally from &quot;Mediterranean Food, Italian Food, French Provincial Cooking&quot; and &quot;An Omelette and a Glass of Wine&quot;. There are sections on soups; small dishes; salads; pasta; gnocchi and polenta; rice; beans and lentils; main dishes; breads; and desserts.

==Awards and honours==
David won the Glenfiddich Writer of the Year award in 1978 for &quot;English Bread and Yeast Cookery&quot;. She was also awarded honorary doctorates by the Universities of Essex and Bristol, and the award of a Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre du Mérite Agricole. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1976 and promoted to Commander of the Order (CBE) in 1986. The honour that most pleased her, however, was being made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1982 in recognition of her skills as a writer.

In 2012, to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, David was chosen by BBC Radio 4 as one of the 60 Britons who have been most influential during the 60 years of the Queen&#x27;s reign. In 2013 her portrait was one of a series of first-class stamps issued to celebrate the centenary of ten &quot;Great Britons&quot;. In 2016 an English Heritage blue plaque was erected on her former home at 24 Halsey Street, Chelsea, where she had lived for 45 years; she was the first food writer to receive this form of recognition.

==Legacy==
The obituaries for David were warm and full of praise for her work and legacy. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the food writer Christopher Driver called her &quot;this century&#x27;s most influential cookery writer and scholar in English&quot;, while the obituarist for &quot;The Times&quot; wrote:

Elizabeth David was the doyenne of English cookery writers. She influenced the generations who came after her, whether they, too, were intending to be culinary experts or merely taking a well-thumbed Elizabeth David Penguin from the kitchen shelf for the next day&#x27;s dinner party. &quot;Elizabeth David says ...&quot; was the regular way of resolving how much spice—and which spices—should be added to a stew and how much garlic should be put in a dressing. At its best, her prose was as precise as her instructions, unlike that of some of her predecessors who sometimes wrapped up advice on what to do in the kitchen with impenetrable sentences. She was a pleasure to read, a stylist of true distinction. Perhaps only in Britain would she have been classified as a &quot;food writer&quot;, too often rather a damning phrase. Elizabeth David combined a scholar&#x27;s feeling for history with the traveller-aesthete&#x27;s gift of conveying a sense of place.

David&#x27;s writing influenced the cultural approach of the British towards food. According to the food journalist Joanna Blythman, she &quot;performed both a cultural and gastronomic miracle in post-war Britain by introducing the nation to a vision of fresh Continental food&quot;, while the writer Rose Prince considers that David &quot;changed for ever the way British people cook&quot;. Janet Floyd, professor of American Literature at King&#x27;s College London, argues that David was not a driver of change, but came to epitomise that change. The literary historian Nicola Humble observes that &quot;the food revolution of the post-war years would probably have happened without Elizabeth David, though in her absence it would have happened very differently&quot;.

Floyd comments that David &quot;showed little interest in appealing to or engaging with an audience outside a social elite&quot;; Cooper addresses the same point, although highlights a positive review of &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot; in &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;—a newspaper that represented the Communist Party of Great Britain—as evidence that David had a broader readership than some give her credit for.

David has appeared in fictional form at least twice. In 2000 a novel, &quot;Lunch with Elizabeth David&quot; by Roger Williams, was published by Carroll &amp; Graf, and in 2006 the BBC broadcast &quot;Elizabeth David: A Life in Recipes&quot;, a film starring Catherine McCormack as David and Greg Wise as Peter Higgins. In 1998 Lisa Chaney published a biography of David; the journalist Paul Levy found it &quot;hasty, botched&quot;, although in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Laura Shapiro considered it &quot;comprehensive&quot;. The following year an authorised biography, &quot;Writing at the Kitchen Table&quot;, was published by Artemis Cooper. She also wrote the entry for David in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; in 2004 (updated in 2011). David&#x27;s papers are at the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University.

David&#x27;s passion for cookware proved influential on the style of the time. Conran acknowledges that her work &quot;formed an important part of the learning process that led to Habitat&quot;, and the success of the Elizabeth David Ltd outlet contributed to a demand for French provincial cookware. David went to great lengths to ensure the illustrators of her books got small details right—in a draft introduction for &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot;, she wrote: &quot;I was anxious that such details should be put on record because some of these regional cooking pots are already becoming very hard to find in France, so that in some sense Juliet Renny&#x27;s drawings constitute a little historical record in their own right.&quot;

David&#x27;s ongoing campaign against the mass-production and standardisation of food was ahead of her time, although Chaney describes her thoughts as &quot;instinctive and unarticulated&quot;. One of David&#x27;s passions, the premise of buying local produce in season and preparing it simply, is a message continued by Stein, Slater and Fearnley-Whittingstall.

Fellow cooks and chefs have acknowledged David&#x27;s influence on their own and their colleagues&#x27; works; her contemporary Jane Grigson wrote in 1967 &quot;Nobody can produce a cookery book these days without a deep appreciation of Elizabeth David&#x27;s work.&quot; Grigson later wrote:

Basil was no more than the name of bachelor uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti or pick a globe artichoke to pieces. ... Then came Elizabeth David like sunshine, writing with brief elegance about good food, that is, about food well contrived, well cooked. She made us understand that we could do better with what we had.

Rick Stein, a more recent chef, says that David was such an influence on his early work that he used one of Minton&#x27;s illustrations from &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; on his menus when he first opened a restaurant. Others, including Nigel Slater, Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver, Prue Leith and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have been influenced by David; Dickson Wright said that David &quot;taught me that food is more than cooking; it is poetry and passion as well. She also taught me never to settle for culinary second-best&quot;. Norman quotes Leith as being quite shocked when she asked students at a catering college how many of them had read David&#x27;s books, and not a single one raised a hand. &quot;But the books do sell—I see the royalty statements—and you see her influence in the cooking of Jeremy Lee, Shaun Hill and Rowley Leigh&quot;.

David&#x27;s influence travelled further afield than Britain, and Marian Burros, in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1992 that &quot;Dozens of the young chefs who have brought glory to American cooking over the last two decades are indebted to Mrs David.&quot; The same year, the journalist Susan Parsons wrote in &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; that &quot;Every leading Australian chef over the age of 40 pays tribute to Elizabeth David as a major influence on their approach to food&quot;. More modern Australian cooks, such as Kylie Kwong, have also cited David as a continuing influence on their work.

Michael Bateman, the food critic for &quot;The Independent&quot;, considered that David &quot;will be remembered as a far greater influence on English food than Mrs Beeton&quot;; the writer Auberon Waugh wrote that if asked to name the woman who had brought about the greatest improvement in English life in the 20th century, &quot;my vote would go to Elizabeth David.&quot; David&#x27;s biographer Cooper concludes her &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; article thus:

<doc id="1216440" wikidata="Q4686858" url="?curid=1216440" title="Advisory Neighborhood Commission">
<text>Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) are bodies of local government in the &lt;includeonly&gt;district&lt;/includeonly&gt;. The ANC system was created in 1974 through a referendum (73 percent voted &quot;yes&quot;) in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. The first elections for Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners were held in the fall of 1975, and commissions began operating in 1976. Congressman Don Fraser (D-Minn) and D.C. resident Milton Kotler helped to draft the ANC language in the Home Rule Act based on the success of Adams Morgan Organization (AMO) in Adams Morgan and on a 1970 report of the Minneapolis Citizen League, as well as on related neighborhood corporations in Pittsburgh; Brooklyn, New York; Chicago; and Columbus, Ohio. 

ANCs consider a wide range of policies and programs affecting their neighborhoods, including traffic, parking, recreation, street improvements, liquor licenses, zoning, economic development, police protection, sanitation and trash collection, and the district&#x27;s annual budget. Commissioners serve two-year terms and receive no salary, but commissions do receive funds for the general purpose of improving their area and hiring staff. This policy has come under scrutiny because of the misuse of funds by commissioners and their employees. Candidates can accept campaign donations up to $25 per person.

As of 2023, ANCs represent more than 100 neighborhoods.

==Powers==

The powers of the ANC system are enumerated by the DC Code § 1–207.38:

# May advise the District government on matters of public policy including decisions regarding planning, streets, recreation, social services programs, health, safety, and sanitation in that neighborhood commission area;
# May employ staff and expend, for public purposes within its neighborhood commission area, public funds and other funds donated to it; and
# Shall have such other powers and duties as may be provided by act of the council.

The ANCs present their positions and recommendations on issues to various District government agencies, the Executive Branch, and the council. They also present testimony to independent agencies, boards, and commissions, usually under the rules of procedure specific to those entities. By law, the ANCs may present their positions to Federal agencies. One of the most common cases of ANC involvement is in the giving of liquor licenses, where the approval or disapproval of the commission, despite having no legal power, represents a veto to the district government.

==Membership and qualifications==

Each ANC Commissioner is nominated and elected by the registered voters who reside in the same Single Member District as the candidate. The ANC Commissioner is an official representing her or his neighborhood community (Single Member District) on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission.

In order to hold the office of Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, an individual must be a registered voter (or must be able to register to vote within two years) in the District, as defined by DC Code Section 1-1001.02; have resided continuously in the Single Member District from which they are nominated for the 60-day period immediately preceding the day on which the nominating petition is filed; and hold no other public office. In order to enter the public ballot, they must receive 25 signatures from registered voters in their district.

==Single Member Districts==

The District of Columbia is divided into eight wards, each of which elects a representative to the Council of the District of Columbia.

Each ward is further subdivided into smaller areas known as Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs). Within each ANC, there are even smaller areas called Single Member Districts (SMDs), each typically representing about 2,000 residents. Although the SMDs should have equal populations, ANCs may vary widely in size. The largest ANCs have 10 SMDs while the smallest just have two. 

Following population growth indicated by the 2020 census, the District now has 46 ANCs, consisting of 345 SMDs.

Each ANC is named by its ward number followed by a letter, assigned alphabetically starting with &#x27;A&#x27;. For example, ANC 3B refers to the second ANC in Ward 3.

Each SMD is named by its ANC number followed by a two-digit number starting with &#x27;01&#x27;. For example, SMD 3B05 is the fifth single member district within ANC 3B.

Due to population growth and redistricting, these boundaries often change, causing shifts in power and election turnout.

==Recent Developments in ANC activities==

Sign-on letters on broader issues

In recent years, Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners have increasingly used &quot;sign-on&quot; letters to address issues beyond their Single Member Districts (SMDs) or commission areas. This practice has expanded the scope of ANC involvement beyond the traditional &quot;great weight&quot; matters within their immediate jurisdictions. 

Commissioners are using sign-on letters ethically when they draft and sign them in a manner that complies with the Code of Conduct. These letters often address citywide concerns or policies that affect multiple neighborhoods, allowing commissioners to collaborate on broader issues affecting the District as a whole.

The Board of Ethics and Government Accountability (BEGA) has provided guidance on the circumstances under which commissioners can participate in sign-on letters, ensuring that this practice aligns with ethical standards and the intended role of ANCs.
Informal caucuses

Over the past 5-8 years, informal caucuses have emerged among ANC commissioners, focusing on specific issues or representing particular communities. These caucuses allow commissioners from different ANCs to collaborate on shared interests and concerns. These caucuses and committees demonstrate a trend towards more coordinated efforts among commissioners on issues that transcend individual ANC boundaries. They provide a platform for sharing information, developing strategies, and advocating for policies at a broader level than traditional ANC activities. Notable examples include:

* Vision Zero Caucus: Focused on traffic safety and the District&#x27;s goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries. The caucus has over 100 ANC Commissioners from around D.C. who collaborate to achieve Vision Zero goals for the District.
* ANC Rainbow Caucus: This caucus represents LGBTQ+ commissioners and advocates for policies affecting the LGBTQ+ community in the District.
* Vacant Buildings Caucus: This group works with the Department of Buildings (DOB) on issues related to abandoned properties, aiming to address the impact of vacant buildings on neighborhoods.
* ANC Vision Zero Committee: While not a citywide caucus, this committee, established by ANC 4B, serves as an example of how individual ANCs are addressing broader city initiatives. The committee focuses on increasing community safety in accordance with Vision Zero goals within their commission area.

The emergence of these informal groups reflects a growing recognition of the interconnected nature of urban issues and the potential for ANCs to play a role in shaping citywide policies. However, it&#x27;s important to note that these caucuses operate outside the formal ANC structure and their influence on policy decisions may vary.
Controversy and Training Initiatives

Recently, there has been some controversy surrounding attempts by organizations like the Washington Area Bicyclist Association (WABA) and Greater Greater Washington (GGWash) to provide training for ANC commissioners.

These training initiatives aim to provide commissioners with information and resources related to urban planning, transportation, and community development. However, the controversy indicates that there may be concerns about the potential influence of these organizations on ANC decision-making processes or the appropriateness of such training programs.

The situation highlights the complex relationships between ANCs, advocacy groups, and community organizations in shaping local policies and decisions in Washington, D.C. It also underscores the importance of maintaining transparency and independence in the ANC system while ensuring that commissioners have access to relevant information and expertise.

<text>Accuphase Laboratory, Inc. (originally known as Kensonic Laboratory, Inc.) is a Japanese, Yokohama-based high-end audio equipment manufacturer whose philosophy is to &quot;enrich life through technology&quot;. Accuphase amplifiers, digital sources and tuners are well regarded for their sound, design and build by high-end audio enthusiasts throughout the world. The brand is relatively uncommon in the USA however.

Accuphase was founded by former Kenwood engineer Jiro Kasuga in late 1972. Kasuga was not happy with the views of Kenwood relating to the follower of their High-End Supreme 1 unit (1967). He hired some engineers from other prominent brands (Marantz, Luxman) and started Kensonic, with Kenwood as a part owner. Some other connections in the early years of Accuphase exist as well. If the parts used by Kenwood and Kensonic throughout the latter&#x27;s early years are compared to each other, the similarities are easily noticeable: knobs, buttons, tuner dials and the general direction of the design. Accuphase&#x27;s early PCBs are tagged KENSONIC, too, and the early units bore KENSONIC on their frontplates as well. Until the mid-1990s, Kenwood still owned part of Kensonic. It appears that Accuphase engineers may have had a hand in the engineering of Kenwood&#x27;s last high-end series (L-A1, L-D1 and LVD-Z1). For example, the Accuphase E-405 and Kenwood L-A1 have very similar volume knobs, side panels, and remotes.

Kensonic&#x27;s first products were the P-300 amp(lifier), the C-200 preamp, and the T-100 tuner. The E-202 integrated amp and an up-versioned tuner (the T-101) were added soon after. All received very positive reviews in 1973 and 1974. While Kenwood has now abandoned all high-end audio activities, Kensonic carries on with the Accuphase series.

Accuphase products are readily identified by their large Champagne-colored faceplates and large dual analog power meters – which are similar to the respected McIntosh Laboratory brand (McIntosh is famous for its unique faceplates, which are made of silk-screened glass and use large blue analog power meters). 

Accuphase explains the brand name as follows:

Accuphase has a reputation for reliability, with units from the first series still in use. Models remain available at least for several years, and sometimes up to a decade. 

The Accuphase website explains the background and development of each of their products.

<text>Steinheil is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged highlands in the southeastern part of the Moon. It was named after German astronomer and physicist Carl August von Steinheil in 1935. It forms a prominent crater pair with the similar-sized Watt, which it partly overlies to the southeast. To the northwest is the large walled plain Janssen. Due to the location of this crater, it appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth. It is from the Nectarian period, 3.92 to 3.85 billion years ago.

This is a relatively circular crater that has undergone some light erosion from subsequent impacts. The inner wall is wider along the southwestern rim than elsewhere, and there is a slight outward bulge in the western rim. There are a few tiny craters along the rim and inner wall, the most notable being a crater at the base of the inner northeast rim. The interior floor is level, with no central peak and only a few minor craters.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Steinheil.

<doc id="1216449" wikidata="Q2093287" url="?curid=1216449" title="Rock bass">
<text>The rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), also known as the rock perch, goggle-eye, red eye, and black perch, is a freshwater fish native to east-central North America. This red-eyed fish is a species of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of order Centrarchiformes and can be distinguished from other similar species by the six spines in the anal fin (other sunfish have only three anal fin spines).

==Distribution==
 Rock bass are native to the St Lawrence River and Great Lakes system, the upper and middle Mississippi River basin in North America from Québec to Saskatchewan in the north down to Missouri and Arkansas, south to the Savannah River, and throughout the eastern U.S. from New York through Kentucky and Tennessee to the northern portions of Alabama and Georgia and Florida in the south. The rock bass has also been found in the Nueces River system in Texas. A population introduced to the Loire River in France between 1904 and 1910 is successfully self-sustaining, but not invasively expanding, more than 100 years later.

==Description==
They are similar in appearance to smallmouth bass, but are usually quite a bit smaller. Identifying characteristics of rock bass are their two dorsal fins that have spinous and soft-rayed united portions, a large mouth, six anal spines, red eyes; rows of dark dots on their sides. The mouth of a rock bass is located in the terminal position, below the snout, with small conical teeth to eat prey. The average rock bass is between , and they rarely weigh over a pound. Few rock bass live beyond 10 to 12 years. &quot;A. rupestris&quot;, the largest and most common of the &quot;Ambloplites&quot; species, has reached a maximum recorded length of , and a maximum recorded weight of . It can live as long as 10 years. These fish have body coloring from golden brown to olive with a white to silver colored belly and have the ability to rapidly change their color to match their surroundings. This chameleon-like trait allows them to thrive throughout their wide range.

==Habitat==
Rock bass prefer clear, rocky, and vegetated stream pools and lake margins. Rocky banks of northeastern lakes and reservoirs are a common habitat for rock bass. Their favorite habitat contains some vegetation with rocky bottoms and cool to warm waters. Rock bass species are usually found near rocky shorelines. They can be surprisingly unflustered by the presence of human activity, living under lakeside docks and near swimming areas. Rock bass are frequently seen in groups, particularly near other sunfish.

==Diet==
Large bass, northern pike, muskie, and walleye prey on young rock bass. Rock bass compete with smallmouth bass for food. It is carnivorous, and its diet consists of smaller fish, including their own young at times, yellow perch, and minnows, as well as insects, and crustaceans. Rock bass are occasionally known to take food from the surface. Adult Rock bass may eat heavily, particularly in the evening and early in the morning.

==Conservation==
Rock bass are successfully surviving in their environments and are listed as a species of &quot;least concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List. Based on their population stability, rock bass do not require any special monitoring or conservation management plans. As a sport fish, rock bass are managed to some extent by regulations. There are slot limits for rock bass on some bodies of water. Artificial nesting habitat or ponds can be employed to improve rock bass populations.

==Reproduction==
Rock bass are sexually mature at about 2 to 3 years of age. Rock bass are polygynandrous, in which both females and males have multiple mates during the breeding season. Spawning occurs from April to early June in warm waters ranging , with females laying from 2,000 to 11,000 eggs.
Like other members of the sunfish family, the male will dig a nest near the lake shallows, and will aggressively guard it. A spawning area may be heavily used, with several other rock bass nests very close together. As a result, males can become quite aggressive as they attempt to defend territory and attract and hold females. Rock bass lack courtship displays, so the female enters the nest and joins the male in his circular behavior. Both the female and male simultaneously release their sperm and eggs into the nest. The male guards and fans the eggs, and later raises the young for a short time. Rock bass are known to grow quickly.

== IGFA records == 
Rock bass are considered game fish throughout much of their range, the IGFA all-tackle world record for the species is a tie between fish caught in York River, Ontario, Canada, and Lake Erie, Pennsylvania, US, in 1974 and 1998 respectively.

== Misconceptions ==
&quot;Ambloplites constellatus&quot; (Ozark bass), a species of rock bass from the Ozark upland of Arkansas, and &quot;Ambloplites ariommus&quot; (shadow bass) are true rock bass, but regarded as separate species. &quot;Ambloplites rupestris&quot; is sometimes called the redeye or redeye bass in Canada, but this name refers more properly to &quot;Micropterus coosae,&quot; a distinct species of centrarchid native to parts of the American South.
Rafinesque originally assigned the rock bass to &quot;Bodianus,&quot; a genus of marine wrasses (family Labridae).

<doc id="1216465" wikidata="Q6152315" url="?curid=1216465" title="Jane Grigson">
<text>Jane Grigson (born Heather Mabel Jane McIntire; 13 March 1928 – 12 March 1990) was an English cookery writer. In the latter part of the 20th century she was the author of the food column for &quot;The Observer&quot; and wrote numerous books about European cuisines and traditional British dishes. Her work proved influential in promoting British food.

Born in Gloucestershire, Grigson was raised in Sunderland, North East England, before studying at Newnham College, Cambridge. In 1953 she became an editorial assistant at the publishing company Rainbird, McLean, where she was the research assistant for the poet and writer Geoffrey Grigson. They soon began a relationship which lasted until his death in 1985; they had one daughter, Sophie. Jane worked as a translator of Italian works, and co-wrote books with her husband before writing &quot;Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery&quot; in 1967. The book was well received and, on its strength, Grigson gained her position at &quot;The Observer&quot; after a recommendation by the food writer Elizabeth David.

Grigson continued to write for &quot;The Observer&quot; until 1990; she also wrote works that focused mainly on British food—such as &quot;Good Things&quot; (1971), &quot;English Food&quot; (1974), &quot;Food With the Famous&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Observer Guide to British Cookery&quot; (1984)—or on key ingredients—such as &quot;Fish Cookery&quot; (1973), &quot;The Mushroom Feast&quot; (1975), &quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Vegetable Book&quot; (1978), &quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Fruit Book&quot; (1982) and &quot;Exotic Fruits and Vegetables&quot; (1986). She was awarded the John Florio Prize for Italian translation in 1966, and her food books won three Glenfiddich Food and Drink Awards and two André Simon Memorial Prizes.

Grigson was active in political lobbying, campaigning against battery farming and for animal welfare, food provenance and smallholders; in 1988 she took John MacGregor, then the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to task after salmonella was found in British eggs. Her writing put food into its social and historical context with a range of sources that includes poetry, novels and the cookery writers of the Industrial Revolution era, including Hannah Glasse, Elizabeth Raffald, Maria Rundell and Eliza Acton. Through her writing she changed the eating habits of the British, making many forgotten dishes popular once again.
==Biography==
===Early life; 1928–1965===

Grigson was born Heather Mabel Jane McIntire on 13 March 1928 in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, the daughter of George and Doris McIntire. George was a solicitor and the deputy town clerk of Gloucester; Doris was an artist. Grigson later said that home was where she &quot;first learnt about good English food&quot;. After he had been involved in the closure of an abattoir, George gave up eating meat. When Grigson was four the family moved to Sunderland, North East England. She picked up a trace of a north-east accent that remained with her, and what the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; calls a &quot;quietly left-wing&quot; political viewpoint. During the Second World War, Sunderland was a target of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombs, so Grigson and her sister Mary were sent to Casterton School, a boarding school in Westmorland. She then gained a place at Newnham College, Cambridge to read English literature.

After university Grigson travelled around Italy, and lived for three months in Florence. On her return to the UK she became the assistant to Bryan Robertson, the curator at the Heffer Gallery in Cambridge; an interest in painting, silver and textiles led her to apply for positions at the Victoria and Albert Museum, but she was unsuccessful. She worked in a junior capacity in an art gallery on Bond Street; she thought the watercolours were old-fashioned, and she later said that &quot;I wished to rip everything off the walls and hang up [works by] Ben Nicholson&quot;. She began writing art reviews for the &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot;, covering subjects such as fine pottery, the Renaissance and the work of Clarkson Frederick Stanfield. In 1953 she became an editorial assistant at the publishing company Rainbird, McLean, a position she held for two years, during which time she was the research assistant for the poet and writer Geoffrey Grigson. He was married, and twenty-three years older than she, but they began a relationship and shortly afterwards she moved to the Farmhouse at Broad Town, Wiltshire, which had been his family home since 1945. He and his wife did not divorce; his estranged wife refused to grant him one. Instead, in the mid-1950s, McIntire changed her name by deed poll to Jane Grigson.

In 1959 the Grigsons had a daughter, Sophie, who later became a food writer and television presenter. Shortly after the birth, the couple purchased a cave-cottage in Trôo, France, and it was there, according to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, that Grigson developed a conviction that &quot;because cooking is a central part of life it should be as carefully written about as any other art form&quot;.

Grigson worked for ten years as a translator from Italian, and in 1959 she wrote a new translation of Carlo Collodi&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, which she thought was &quot;the only version of Pinocchio to transmit the liveliness and toughness of the original&quot;. She translated Gian Antonio Cibotto&#x27;s 1962 work &quot;Scano Boa&quot; in 1963 and, the same year, also translated Cesare Beccaria&#x27;s 1764 work &quot;Dei delitti e delle pene&quot;; the work was published as &quot;Of Crimes and Punishments&quot;, and it won the 1966 John Florio Prize for Italian translation. Jane and Geoffrey then worked on a joint project aimed at juveniles that looked at the meaning of 65 artworks in the context of their time and their enduring impact; &quot;Shapes and Stories&quot; was published in 1964. &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; both thought it &quot;original and beautiful&quot;. A follow-up work, &quot;Shapes and Adventures&quot;, was published in 1967.

===Mid-1960s to mid-1970s===

In the mid-1960s Grigson was persuaded by her friend, Adey Horton, to co-author a book on pork. Horton dropped out part-way through the project and, in 1967, Grigson published &quot;Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;the research is detailed, the recounting lively, the information fascinating, the recipes complete from head to tail.&quot; In a &quot;tour d&#x27;horizon&quot; of cookery books in 1977, Elizabeth David called the book &quot;A valuable work on the salting, curing and cooking of pork ... as practised by French households as well as by professional &quot;charcutiers&quot;&quot;, and commented on its &quot;authentic recipes, practical approach and good writing&quot;.

On the strength of &quot;Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery&quot;—and a subsequent lunch—David recommended Grigson to &quot;The Observer&quot; as their food writer; Grigson began her weekly column with the paper the following year. For her first article she wrote about strawberries, but was unsure of how to approach the topic. Her husband suggested &quot;we&#x27;ll find out what the strawberry has meant to people, what they have done to it, how they have developed it and so on&quot;. She used the same approach for most of her future columns.

Jay Rayner, one of her successors in the role, writes that Grigson &quot;established ... [the] newspaper&#x27;s reputation as a publication that was serious about food&quot;. Nigel Slater, another successor, considers her writing &quot;legendary&quot;. She held the position until 1990. Grigson and her husband would spend three months a year in Trôo—sometimes visiting twice a year—writing there and at their home in Broad Town, Wiltshire. While in France she &quot;delighted in proving to ... [her] French friends that British cooking could be every bit as good as theirs&quot;, according to her daughter. Her articles in &quot;The Observer&quot; provided the basis of further books; in 1971 her columns provided material for &quot;Good Things&quot;, which she introduced by saying it &quot;is not a manual of cookery, but a book about enjoying food&quot;. Harold Wilshaw, the food writer for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, thought it a &quot;magnificent book ... worth the money for the chapter on prunes alone&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; considers it &quot;perhaps the most popular of her books&quot;. Nika Hazelton, reviewing it for &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that it is &quot;a delight to read and to cook from. The author is literate, her food interesting but unaffected&quot;. The chef and food writer Samin Nosrat lists &quot;Good Things&quot; as one of &quot;the classic cookbooks that shaped my career as a chef and writer&quot;, alongside &quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Fruit Book&quot; and &quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Vegetable Book&quot;.

In 1973 Grigson was invited by the Wine and Food Society to write &quot;Fish Cookery&quot;. According to the food writer Geraldene Holt, it was not common in Britain at that time for fish to be the main course at a formal meal; by the time Grigson came around to writing the updated edition in 1993, attitudes and tastes had changed, and a wider variety of fish was available for purchase.
Grigson opened her 1974 work, &quot;English Food&quot; with &quot;English cooking—both historically and in the mouth—is a great deal more varied and delectable than our masochistic temper in this matter allows&quot;. On reading the book, Roger Baker, reviewing in &quot;The Times&quot;, described Grigson as &quot;probably the most engaging food writer to emerge during the last few years&quot;; he thought the book had &quot;a sense of fun, a feeling for history, a very readable style and a love of simple, unaffected cooking&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; later described &quot;English Food&quot; as being &quot;a work to set alongside Elizabeth David&#x27;s books on French and Italian cuisine&quot;. Holt records that with the book, &quot;Grigson had become a crusader for the oft-maligned cooking of the British Isles&quot;; she became an early critic of battery farming and passionate about the provenance of food. The same year, Grigson was a contributor to &quot;The World Atlas of Food&quot;. The book was described by the food writer Elizabeth Ray as &quot;by its nature both expensive and superficial&quot;, and by Baker as containing &quot;hectic catch-lines on every page ... a thinness in the writing&quot;.

Over the next three years Grigson returned to producing books dealing with key categories of food: two booklets, &quot;Cooking Carrots &quot; and &quot;Cooking Spinach&quot; were published in 1975, as was &quot;The Mushroom Feast&quot;. The last of these was described by &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; as &quot;A beautiful collection of recipes and culinary lore&quot;; the reviewer for &quot;The Observer&quot; noted that &quot;Grigson gives you more than recipes. She takes you down the byways of folklore and literature&quot;. Grigson described it as &quot;the record of one family&#x27;s pursuit of mushrooms, both wild and cultivated, over the last twenty years&quot;. Unlike many of her other books it owed little to her previously published articles, but drew on her family&#x27;s experiences as mushroom enthusiasts. The idea of writing a book on fungi came to her after a friend in Trôo introduced the Grigsons to mushroom gathering. For him, as for other locals, &quot;mushroom-hunting was part of the waste-nothing philosophy he had inherited from his farming peasant ancestors. ... mushrooms have long been accepted by chefs of the high cooking tradition in France: there is no question of allowing them to go to waste as we do so unregardingly&quot;. She had gradually concluded that few available books did justice to mushrooms and other fungi: &quot;Most cookery books—always excepting &quot;Plats du Jour&quot; by Patience Gray and Primrose Boyd—are useless&quot;. Reviewing the first edition, Skeffington Ardron wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that choosing between the many recipes &quot;will drive you wild, for there is here such a magnificent collection&quot; ranging from simple economical dishes to &quot;the extravagant, impossible, ridiculous &quot;Poulard Derbe&quot; with its champagne, foie gras and truffles&quot;.

===1978 to 1985===

In 1978 Grigson wrote &quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Vegetable Book&quot;. Reviewing the book in the first edition of &quot;Petits Propos Culinaires&quot;, Jane Davidson wrote &quot;Erudition and commonsense are not always bedfellows. In this book they snuggle happily together. ... it is light on the eye and invigorating to the imagination.&quot; Writing about the first edition, the food writer Robin McDouall said in &quot;The Times&quot; that the book was &quot;worthy to stand on the shelf by her &quot;Fish Cookery&quot; and her &quot;Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery&quot;—praise could go no higher&quot;. He commented that the cuisines of many countries were covered, but the main ones were French, Greek, Turkish and Arab. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; Mimi Sheraton wrote that the book was a &quot;large, handsome volume [with] helpful shopping, storing and cooking information on all the vegetables included in recipes, and the range of dishes is worldwide if strongest on European specialties&quot;. Sheraton remarked on the &quot;especially good lentil recipes, wonderful fragrant and bracing soups, and intriguing preparations for lesserknown vegetables such as chayote squash, Jerusalem artichokes and hop shoots&quot;. Wilshaw, reviewing the paperback edition for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, praised Grigson&#x27;s &quot;warm and erudite style ... an encyclopaedic account of vegetables, their history and their place in modern kitchens&quot;. In 1986 &quot;The Guardian&quot; polled its readers to discover their most indispensable cookery books; &quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Vegetable Book&quot; took the second place, behind Elizabeth David&#x27;s &quot;French Provincial Cooking&quot; but ahead of other books by David and by Madhur Jaffrey, Delia Smith, Claudia Roden and Julia Child.

In July 1978 Grigson was interviewed for &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; by Roy Plomley. Among her selections were poetry recordings by her husband, one of his books—&quot;Notes from an Odd Country&quot;—and, as her luxury item, a typewriter and paper.
Following a series of articles Grigson wrote for her column in &quot;The Observer&quot;, she published &quot;Food With the Famous&quot; in 1979, a look at the food eaten by various figures through history. The critic for &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; thought &quot;Grigson&#x27;s leisurely quotation-studded essays are almost too tantalizing; eventually one begins to miss the factual data (accounts of recipe-adaptations, etc.)&quot; while the reviewer for the &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot; described it as &quot;a charming book about food, rather than a cookery book&quot;. From late 1979 to 1980 the chef Anne Willan wrote &quot;French Cookery School&quot;, a sixteen-part series in &quot;The Observer&quot;. The series was collated into a book, &quot;The Observer French Cookery School&quot;, with Grigson adding information on French cuisine.

In 1981 Grigson was a participant at the second Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, along with Elizabeth David. The symposium was founded by the food historian Alan Davidson and the social historian Theodore Zeldin.

Grigson published &quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Fruit Book&quot; in 1982, a companion book to her &quot;Vegetable Book&quot;. Prue Leith, the cookery editor for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said the book was &quot;a great read and a vital leg-up for the cook temporarily bereft of ideas beyond apple pie. ... There are literary, historical, and travel anecdotes, interleaved with solid information&quot;. Reviewing the book in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Sheraton wrote that the book was &quot;readable and spirited, with ... [a] diverse combination of practical information, enticing recipes and romantic lore and food history, all tempered with humor and goodwill&quot;.

In 1983 Grigson published &quot;The Observer Guide to European Cookery&quot;. The paper sent her on what she called &quot;a cook&#x27;s tour&quot; of European countries in early 1981 to explore and write about their cuisines. Political difficulties and a limited timetable obliged her to miss many countries; those she visited and wrote about were Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Britain, the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Austria and Hungary. Russia had seemed likely to be omitted, because of the inefficiency and obstructiveness of Soviet officials, but Pamela Davidson, a friend based in Moscow, stepped into the breach, producing &quot;the most informative part of the book, which tells us exactly what Soviet citizens eat and give their friends&quot;. Grigson&#x27;s experiences were published as a ten-week series in the paper before being published in book form. Leith, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote that, despite reading the columns in the newspaper, she was able to &quot;read them again with undiminished pleasure&quot;. A sixty-minute video was produced by &quot;The Observer&quot; showing Grigson preparing six of the book&#x27;s recipes. Shona Crawford Poole, reviewing for &quot;The Times&quot;, thought it showed &quot;Grigson&#x27;s agreeable manner ... allied to great good sense&quot;.

Grigson&#x27;s next book, &quot;The Observer Guide to British Cookery&quot;, was published in 1984, for which Grigson and her husband travelled round the UK to sample local fare. In her introduction she said &quot;I think it helps if we try to consider the origins of our food, and its appropriateness.&quot; Her aim for the book, was to &quot;make us all think out the best way of eating good honest food, seemly food if you like, at levels and in a style that are recognisably and proudly our own&quot;. Alan Davidson, reviewing for &quot;Petits Propos Culinaires&quot;, observed Grigson&#x27;s long-held interest in British food, and thought &quot;the quality of her writing shines as brightly as ever&quot;. The journalist Digby Anderson, reviewing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, stated &quot;This is &#x27;expanded from her articles for &quot;The Observer Magazine&quot;″. Thus it is not pure Grigson but has additives, preservatives and a good deal of artificial colouring&quot;, although he allowed &quot;There are splendid recipes, good general advice and useful tips in &quot;British Cooking&quot;&quot;.

===1985 to 1990===
Geoffrey Grigson died in November 1985. Jane said that when married, &quot;each day was vivid&quot;, &quot;he made every ordinary day exciting and worth living&quot;. The following year she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. In a letter to the writer Colin Spencer soon afterwards, she said &quot;When I first got cancer ... I welcomed the thought of joining him in the churchyard.&quot; After medical treatment, the cancer went into remission.

Not long after Geoffrey&#x27;s death, Jane Grigson began to take an active role in food lobbying. She campaigned for animal welfare, she promoted food provenance and smallholders. It was a subject she had long thought important; in 1971, in the introduction to &quot;Good Food&quot;, she wrote:

The encouragement of fine food is not greed or gourmandise; it can be seen as an aspect of the anti-pollution movement in that it indicates concern for the quality of the environment. This is not the limited concern of a few cranks. Small and medium-sized firms, feeling unable to compete with the cheap products of the giants, turn to producing better food. A courageous pig-breeder in Suffolk starts a cooked pork shop in the high charcuterie style; people in many parts of the country run restaurants specialising in local food; I notice in grocer&#x27;s shops in our small town the increasing appearance of bags of strong flour and the prominence given to eggs direct from the farm.
In 1988 Grigson took John MacGregor, then the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to task after salmonella was found in British eggs. She told McGregor &quot;I advise action, not just another research committee. You may get away with allowing agribusiness to poison our drinking water; it cannot get away with eggs&quot;. She also became involved in the opposition to development around Avebury, the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Grigson&#x27;s last major work was &quot;Exotic Fruits and Vegetables&quot;, published in 1986. The impetus for the 128-page volume came from the artist Charlotte Knox, who offered the publisher, Jonathan Cape, a portfolio of coloured drawings of exotic fruits and vegetables. Grigson&#x27;s &quot;idea was to make an album in 19th-century style with plates vivid enough for people to be excited by them, to want to pick them off the page and try them for themselves.&quot;

Grigson&#x27;s cancer returned in the middle of 1989 and she underwent chemotherapy in September that year; she died on 12 March 1990 at Broad Town. She was buried in the cemetery of Christ Church, the local church, alongside Geoffrey. A memorial service for Grigson was held at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster in June 1990; the speakers providing the eulogies were the food writers Derek Cooper and Paul Levy.

==Broadcasting==
Unlike Elizabeth David, who avoided broadcasting, Grigson appeared from time to time on radio and television. In 1984 she joined Prue Leith, Anton Mosimann, Albert Roux and two others in the Channel 4 television series &quot;Take Six Cooks&quot;, in which well-known cooks dined together at the Dorchester Hotel in London and each then presented their thoughts on and recipes for a particular course or dishes. Leith presented &quot;hors d&#x27;oeuvres&quot;, Mosimann fish, Roux meat and Grigson vegetables. In a book associated with the series eight of her recipes were included. As was her usual practice, she interspersed classic recipes—&quot;carrots à la Forestière&quot; and peas in the French style with spring onions and lettuce—with less well known dishes such as artichokes stuffed with a purée of broad beans.

On BBC radio she took part in interviews and panel discussions giving her views on ingredients and advice on techniques, and in a 1989 programme she presented a portrait of Elizabeth Raffald and her 18th-century recipes. On BBC television she extolled her heroes—Elizabeth David, Henry James and Geoffrey Grigson, demonstrated how to roast and stuff a goose, went in search of Britain&#x27;s best fresh produce, gave advice for the health-conscious about cooking vegetables, and joined other cooks at the Savoy Hotel to supervise show-business celebrities attempting to cook classic dishes.

==Works==

===1960s===
====&quot;Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery&quot; (1967)====

Grigson&#x27;s first book about food and cookery was &quot;Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery&quot;, published by Michael Joseph in 1967. After a brief introduction outlining the history of the pig in European agriculture and cuisine, the main text begins with a &quot;Picnic guide to the charcutier&#x27;s shop&quot;, in which the author details the pork products available in a good French charcuterie. They include dishes ready to eat, such as rillettes; pâtés; cooked and cured ham (such as jambons de York and de Bayonne); and cooked sausages of the salami and other types. Dishes that require cooking include pigs&#x27; trotters; sausages including andouillettes; black puddings; and, more expensive, boudins blancs. Also listed are cuts of fresh pork, from head to tail (&quot;tête&quot; and &quot;queue de porc&quot;).

Later chapters deal with charcuterie equipment; herbs and seasonings; and sauces and relishes. They are followed by four substantial chapters of recipes for terrines, pâtés (cold and hot), and galantines; sausages and boudins blancs; salt pork and hams; and the main cuts of fresh pork. The final four chapters cover the &quot;Extremities&quot;; &quot;Insides&quot;; &quot;Fat&quot;; and &quot;Blood&quot; (black puddings). Throughout, there are illustrative line drawings by M.J. Mott.

When the first American edition was published, in 1968, three of the US&#x27;s leading cookery writers—Julia Child, James Beard and Michael Field—called it &quot;the best cook book of the year&quot;. In Britain, Penguin Books published a paperback edition in 1970. The book was out of print for some time in the late 1990s—the food correspondent of &quot;The Guardian&quot; encouraged readers to write to the publishers &quot;and bully them into reprinting&quot;—but was reissued in 2001 and (at 2019) has remained in print ever since. In 2001 the chef Chris Galvin called the book &quot;a masterpiece&quot;:
:so informative and well written ... it feels that you have someone on hand to help, steering you through the recipe, avoiding unnecessary technical terms and instead using universal words and phrases, e.g. &quot;whirling ingredients together&quot;, &quot;simmering and not galloping a stock&quot;. Most importantly Grigson encourages you to attempt dishes insisting, for example, that making a sausage is a simple affair then following this statement up with recipe after recipe for saucisse fumé, saucisse de campagne and saussicon sec.

Translations of the book have been published in Dutch (&quot;Worst, Paté: en andere Charcuterie uit de Franse Keuken&quot;) and—unusually for a book on food by a British author—in French.

===1970s===
====&quot;Good Things&quot; (1971)====

The sections of the book deal with fish, meat and game, vegetables and fruit, with a miscellany to conclude. In some of Grigson&#x27;s later books she dealt exhaustively with specific ingredients: her &quot;Fish Cookery&quot; two years later covered more than fifty varieties of fish. Here she deals with five: kippers, lobster, mussels, scallops and trout, writing about her few chosen subjects more expansively than in the later book, and discussing the pros and cons of various recipes. She says of lobsters that there is nothing more delicious, so sweet, firm and succulent, discusses the most humane way of killing them, and although advancing the proposition that they are best eaten hot with only lemon juice and butter on them, she gives the recipes for homard à l&#x27;Americaine (quoting Édouard de Pomiane&#x27;s view that it is &quot;a gastronomic cacophony&quot;) and Thermidor, as well as bisque, which she calls &quot;without qualification ... the best of all soups&quot;.

Grigson adopts the same approach in the other sections, dealing at leisure with favoured ingredients and dishes. Not all her choices are the most frequently seen in other cookery books: in the meat section she devotes eight pages to snails, and ten to sweetbreads, and none to steaks or roasts. Among the six fruits she writes about, apples and strawberries are joined by quince and prunes. She agrees that stewed prunes endured at school or in prison—the &quot;dreadful alliance between prunes and rice or prunes and custard powder&quot;—are best forgotten, and makes her case for the prune as a traditional ingredient in meat and fish dishes, giving as examples beef or hare casseroled with prunes, turkey with prune stuffing, and tripe slowly simmered with prunes. In the final section she covers five French cakes, ice creams and sorbets, and fruit liqueurs.

WorldCat records 21 editions of &quot;Good Things&quot; published between 1971 and 2009 in English and translation. The original edition, like the charcuterie book four years earlier, had line drawings by M.J. Mott. A reprint by the Folio Society in 2009 had illustrations, some in colour, by Alice Tait.

====&quot;Fish Cookery&quot; (1973)====
The book was first published as &quot;The International Wine and Food Society&#x27;s Guide to Fish Cookery&quot; in 1973, but became widely known in its paperback form with the shorter title, issued by Penguin in 1975. Grigson did not believe that anything is truly original in recipes, and happily included those of other writers in her books, being careful to acknowledge her sources—&quot;There&#x27;s nothing new about intellectual honesty&quot;. Her influences were not exclusively European: among those she credited in her &quot;Fish Cookery&quot; (1973) were Claudia Roden&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Middle Eastern Food&quot;, Mary Lamb&#x27;s &quot;New Orleans Cuisine&quot; and James Beard&#x27;s &quot;Delights and Prejudices&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;Fish Cookery&quot; is, of Grigson&#x27;s books, the one most focused on the British cook, because, as she observes, the same edible birds and quadrupeds are found in many parts of the world, but species of fish are generally more confined to particular areas. Even given that limitation, Grigson urges her British readers to be more adventurous in their choice of fresh fish. She points out that there are more than fifty species native to British waters, not including shellfish or freshwater fish, and she urges cooks to venture beyond &quot;cod and plaice, overcooked and coated with greasy batter&quot;.

The chapters of &quot;Fish Cookery&quot; are &quot;Choosing, Cleaning and Cooking Fish&quot;; &quot;Court-bouillons, Sauces and Butters&quot;; &quot;Fish Stews and Soups&quot;; &quot;Flat-fish&quot;; &quot;More Fish from the Sea&quot;; &quot;The Great Fish&quot;; &quot;Fish Caught in Fresh Water&quot;; &quot;Shellfish and Crustaceans&quot;; &quot;and &quot;Cured and Preserved Fish&quot;. The book concludes with glossaries of fish names and cookery terms and measures. &quot;Great&quot; in the title of the sixth chapter refers to size, rather than particular pre-eminence: it includes tuna, swordfish, shark and sunfish. Grigson ascribes greatness in the qualitative sense only to sole and turbot among sea fish, trout and salmon among fresh-water species, and eel, lobster and crayfish.

As well as classics such as sole Véronique, bouillabaisse, moules marinière, and lobster Thermidor, Grigson gives recipes for more unusual combinations of ingredients, including cod steaks with Gruyère cheese sauce, herring with gooseberries, scallop and artichoke soup, and prawns in tomato, cream and vermouth sauce.

A statement in the section on mussels led to minor controversy some years after publication. Grigson writes that once the mussels are cooked any that do not open should be thrown away. She gives no reason, but many subsequent writers have taken it that eating a closed mussel would be injurious, rather than simply impracticable. The Australian Fisheries Research and Development Corporation published research in 2012 to rebut the assumption.

Grigson had completed two-thirds of the text of a revised edition of the book when she died. Her editor, Jenny Dereham, completed the revision, using additional recipes and articles Grigson had published since 1973. It was published with the title &quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Fish Book&quot; in 1993, in hardback by Michael Joseph and in paperback by Penguin. Reviewing the new edition in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Michael Leapman wrote that many of the recipes had been updated to reflect current tastes—&quot;a little less cream and butter&quot;—and remarked on Grigson&#x27;s exploration of new areas of interest little known to readers of the first edition, such as sashimi and ceviche.

====&quot;English Food&quot; (1974)====
The book has the subtitle, &quot;An anthology chosen by Jane Grigson&quot;. As in her earlier books, Grigson made no claim to originality in her recipes, and was scrupulous about crediting those with a known author. The chapters cover soups; cheese and egg dishes; vegetables; fish; meat, poultry and game; puddings; cakes, biscuits and pancakes; and stuffings, sauces and preserves. Line drawings by Gillian Zeiner illustrate details of kitchen techniques, materials and equipment. The introduction outlines Grigson&#x27;s thoughts on good English cooking and its decline. Another point in the introduction is that whereas in France most of the great cookery writers have been men, in England it is the women writers, such as Hannah Glasse and Eliza Acton, who stand out. Many of their recipes are included in subsequent chapters. The introduction to the revised 1979 edition enlarges on the state of English food, and calls for better cookery teaching in British schools. Grigson emphasises the advantages of good, locally produced food, which she says, is not only better but usually cheaper than that offered by the large commercial concerns: &quot;Words such as &#x27;fresh&#x27; and &#x27;home-made&#x27; have been borrowed by commerce to tell lies.&quot;

In a study of &quot;The 50 best cookbooks&quot; in 2010, Rachel Cooke wrote that it was debatable which of Grigson&#x27;s &quot;many wonderful books&quot; was the best, &quot;but the one for which she will always be most celebrated is &quot;English Food&quot;&quot;. Cooke quotes the critic Fay Maschler&#x27;s view that Grigson &quot;restored pride to the subject of English food and gave evidence that there is a valid regional quality still extant in this somewhat beleaguered cuisine.&quot;

The book contains mostly English recipes, but draws from time to time on the cuisines of Wales and Scotland. Cooke describes it as &quot;undoubtedly a work of scholarship: carefully researched, wide-ranging and extremely particular&quot; but adds that it also contains &quot;hundreds of excellent recipes, the vast majority of them short, precise and foolproof. Who could resist poached turbot with shrimp sauce, or a properly made Cornish pasty?&quot; Among the puddings in the book are Yorkshire curd tart, brown bread ice cream, queen of puddings and Sussex pond pudding.

&quot;English Food&quot; won the Glenfiddich Award for the cookery book of the year, 1974. A new edition, with an introduction by Sophie Grigson, was published by Ebury Press, London, in 2002. Reviewing it, Lindsey Bareham wrote, &quot;If you don&#x27;t already own a copy of this seminal book, now is the time to invest in our edible heritage made digestible by one of the finest writers we have ever produced&quot;.

====&quot;The World Atlas of Food&quot; (1974)====
Subtitled &quot;A Gourmet&#x27;s Guide to the Great Regional Dishes of the World&quot;, this 319-page book was published by Mitchell Beazley, a company specialising in atlases and other extensively illustrated works of reference. Grigson is credited as &quot;contributing editor&quot;. James Beard wrote the introduction, titled &quot;An epicurean journey&quot;. The book has pages illustrating and describing ingredients of the various areas of the world—fish, meat, vegetables, fungi and fruit. The cuisines of Europe, Africa, Asia, Australasia and the Americas are covered. The American edition was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1974. The book was reissued in Australia and the US in 1984 and in Britain in 1988 and was reprinted in 1989.

====&quot;The Mushroom Feast&quot; (1975)====

&quot;The Mushroom Feast&quot; was published by Michael Joseph in 1975. The book is in six chapters. The first, &quot;The best edible mushrooms&quot;, has descriptions of twenty varieties of mushroom, from the familiar cultivated &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot;, morels, cèpes, girolles and oysters, to the less well known matsutake, parasol, shaggy cap, wood-blewit and others. Each is illustrated with a line drawing by Yvonne Skargon, and followed by descriptions of the flavour and basic cooking instructions. The next chapter, dealing with preserved mushrooms, sauces, stuffings, and soups, gives modern and old recipes, including some by Hannah Glasse, Eliza Acton, Marie-Antoine Carême, Hilda Leyel and Grigson&#x27;s mentor and friend Elizabeth David.

In the chapter on mushroom main dishes—such as in an open tart or a covered pie, in a gateau with cream, or stuffed with almonds, or baked in the Genoese style—other ingredients play a subordinate part in the recipes, but are given more prominence in &quot;Mushrooms with fish&quot; and &quot;Mushrooms with meat, poultry, and game&quot;. After a section on the principal mushrooms of Japanese and Chinese cooking, an appendix gives five basic recipes for sauces to accompany mushrooms.

WorldCat records 18 editions of the book published between 1975 and 2008.

====&quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Vegetable Book&quot; (1978)====

For this book Grigson adopted a straightforward alphabetical layout. There are chapters on more than eighty vegetables, from artichokes to yams. Most chapters are in three parts: brief historical information about the vegetables, guidance on preparing them, and recipes using them. The author does not play down her own likes and dislikes; she praises artichokes and asparagus as &quot;the two finest vegetables we can grow&quot;, but calls winter turnips and swedes &quot;that grim pair&quot;, and admits to a lifelong detestation of kale. Seakale, on the other hand, she rates highly, not only for its delicate flavour, but as the only vegetable in the entire book native to England.

Grigson considered omitting mushrooms from the book, on the grounds that they are not a vegetable and that she had already devoted a whole book to them in 1975, but decided that &quot;leaving them out won&#x27;t do&quot;, and gave them a two-page chapter, covering their choice and preparation, and giving recipes for mushroom soup and mushroom pie. Also included are savoury fruits such as avocados and tomatoes. As well as ingredients familiar in European cuisine, Grigson includes sections on bean sprouts, Chinese artichokes, okra, sweet potato, pignuts and other vegetables less well known among her readership in the 1970s. The longest chapters are those on lettuces (13 pages), spinach and tomatoes (both 18 pages) and potatoes (24 pages).

In her preface to the first American edition in 1979, Grigson observed that although British and American cooks found each other&#x27;s systems of measurement confusing (citing the US use of volume rather than weight for solid ingredients), the two countries were at one in suffering from supermarkets&#x27; obsession with the appearance rather than the flavour of vegetables.

The book brought its author her first Glenfiddich Food and Drink Writer of the Year Award and the first of two André Simon Memorial Prizes. 

====&quot;Food With the Famous&quot; (1979)====
The book has its origins in a series of articles Grigson wrote for &quot;The Observer&#x27;s&quot; colour magazine in 1978, and is described as part cookery book and part social history. Her publisher wrote that she &quot;re-read favourite novels, re-examined pictures in the great galleries, explored houses, letters, journals, and the cookery books used (or written) by her choice of famous men and women&quot;. Starting with &quot;the great diarist and salad fancier&quot; John Evelyn in the 17th century, she traces a chronological development of western cooking. Her other examples are from the 18th century (Parson James Woodforde), the cusp of the 18th and 19th (Jane Austen, Thomas Jefferson, and the Rev Sydney Smith), the high-19th (Lord and Lady Shaftesbury, Alexandre Dumas and Émile Zola); and on into the 20th &quot;with Marcel Proust in the gourmet&#x27;s Paris, and Claude Monet among the water-lilies at Giverny&quot;.
In the introduction to Evelyn&#x27;s chapter, Grigson describes his contribution to British food—translating the works of Jean-Baptiste de La Quintinie, promoting ice-houses and recording the earliest example of the pressure cooker. She quotes him on vegetables, for instance on beetroot: &quot;vulgar, but eaten with oil and vinegar, as usually, it is no despicable salad.&quot; Evelyn&#x27;s garden was organised so that mixed green salad could be put on the table every day of the year; Grigson lists the 35 different species from balm to tripe-madam that Evelyn specified for his salads. For the chapters on the novelists, Grigson gives recipes for dishes mentioned in their books, including white soup and fricassée of sweetbread for Jane Austen, asparagus soup &quot;à la comtesse,&quot; and fillets of sole with ravigote sauce for Zola, brill Radziwill and boeuf à la mode for Proust, and for Dumas, who published a book about food, she prints his own recipes for cabbage soup, scrambled eggs with shrimps, and several others.

Although Grigson&#x27;s favourite of her works was the 1982 fruit book, she said she had a particular fondness for &quot;Food With the Famous&quot;.

===1980s===

====&quot;The Observer French Cookery School&quot; (1980)====
This book was a spin-off from an &quot;Observer&quot; series. Its two authors, Grigson and Anne Willan of La Varenne cookery school in Paris, augmented their &quot;Observer&quot; articles for the book. Willan&#x27;s sections, occupying the majority of the 300 pages, give technical advice on various aspects of cooking, such as boning, making choux pastry, the use of gelatine, and cooking with bains-marie. A 1991 bibliography describes Grigson&#x27;s section—a 47-page &quot;Anthology of French cooking and kitchen terms&quot;—as &quot;an alphabetic listing of descriptions written in condensed but detailed prose, full of personal observation; almost a little book in itself&quot;.

====&quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Fruit Book&quot; (1982)====
For Grigson, this book was more fun to write than any of her others. Her particular fondness for fruits caused her to protest in her introduction about the quality offered by large suppliers:

The food trade makes the egalitarian mistake, which is also a convenience for itself, of thinking that every food has to be as cheap and inoffensive as every other similar food. This mistake has ruined chicken and potatoes and bread. No wine merchant sells only plonk, no flower shop sticks to daisies. In the matter of vegetables and fruit, we seem often to be reduced to a steady bottom of horticultural plonk.
The layout follows that of the vegetable book of three years earlier: chapters on each fruit, set out alphabetically from apples to water-melon. In between, familiar fruits such as bananas, cherries, pears and strawberries are interspersed with cherimoyas, medlars, persimmons and sapodillas. There are 46 of these chapters, taking 432 pages. The book finishes with a miscellany of fruit-related topics, such as matching fruits and wines, fruit preserves, and recipes for biscuits suitable to eat with fruit.

As well as recipes in which the fruit is the star ingredient, Grigson gives details of many dishes where fruit is combined with meat, poultry or fish, including pheasant with apples, lamb with apricots, sole with banana, quail with cherries, oxtail with grapes, and eel soup with pears. As in the vegetable book, Grigson is clear about her likes and dislikes. &quot;Rhubarb: Nanny-food. Governess-food. School-meal-food.&quot; She finds some recipes for it worth including, but falls short of calling them delectable—&quot;merely not too undelectable&quot;.

Reviewing the book in &quot;Petits Propos Culinaires&quot;, Jane Davidson called it &quot;brilliant&quot;, adding, &quot;Anecdotes, history, poetry and personal appreciation are all here as well as practical suggestions on how to use both the familiar and less so. ... In Michelin language, &quot;four&quot; stars and &quot;six&quot; place settings&quot;. Like the Vegetable Book, this one won Grigson a Glenfiddich and an André Simon award.

====&quot;The Observer Guide to European Cookery&quot; (1983)====

Grigson published &quot;The Observer Guide to European Cookery&quot; in 1983. She expanded her original articles from &quot;The Observer&quot; into this 256-page book, extensively illustrated by uncredited &quot;Observer&quot; photographers. A reviewer commented that one might expect the author, her life based partly in France, to begin with French cuisine, but Grigson explains:
:Greece comes first, with classical and Hellenic chefs already theorising about food in terms that do not seem odd today. In terms that make perfect sense. Italy took on the skills of Greece, since well-off Romans employed chefs from Athens just as well-off Northerners have looked to Paris for their chefs. Through Spain, Arab dishes and Arab gardening, as well as new vegetables and foods from America, were handed on to the rest of Europe. Portugal comes in here, in its great phase of travel and discovery. France next, in the perfect, unique position between Mediterranean and Atlantic seas, exactly poised to take advantage of the Renaissance and the New World.

In each chapter Grigson mixes the well known and the offbeat. In the opening Greek chapter, recipes for taramasalata, moussaka and dolmades sit alongside hare in walnut sauce and salad of calf brains. Italian recipes include classics such as osso buco with risotto milanese, Parmigiana di melanzane and vitello tonnato, but also grilled eel, sole with Parmesan, tripe with pig&#x27;s trotters, and lamb sautéed with olives. Similar juxtapositions are found in other chapters—Portuguese cuisine beyond sardines, British beyond steak and kidney pudding, and Scandinavian beyond smörgåsbord. Among the less well-known dishes described by Grigson are beef fillet with gentleman&#x27;s sauce,
chicken in a dressing-gown, chilled grape soup, quaking pudding, red wine soup, and Siberian ravioli.

In the US the book was published in 1983 by Atheneum, under the title &quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Book of European Cookery&quot;.

====&quot;The Observer Guide to British Cookery&quot; (1984)====
This 231-page book is similar in layout and approach to the previous year&#x27;s guide to European cooking, but unlike its predecessor it was published in book form before recipes from it were extracted and printed by the newspaper. The British regions are considered in nine sections, each with an introduction describing the character and ingredients, followed by recipes associated with places within the region.

The South-West chapter includes Cornish bouillabaisse from Gidleigh Park; Sedgemoor eel stew; lardy cake; and &quot;Cornwall&#x27;s most famous and most travestied dish&quot;, the Cornish pasty—&quot;pronounced with a long &#x27;ah&#x27; as in Amen&quot;. Among the dishes in the London and the South section are steak and kidney pudding, using beef rump steak and lambs&#x27; kidneys; salt beef; and bread and butter pudding. Dishes from the Midlands include rabbit and pig tail stew; Oldbury gooseberry pies; Bakewell pudding; and Shrewsbury cakes. The East Anglia section includes turnip pie; stuffed guinea fowl; Lincolnshire plum bread; and, for its connection with Trinity College, Cambridge, crème brûlée.

In the North East chapter Grigson includes recipes for mutton and leek broth, mussel or oyster pudding and toad in the hole. Dishes from the North West include potted shrimps, Lancashire hotpot, Liverpool&#x27;s scouse, Cumberland sausage and the chicken dish Hindle Wakes. Throughout the book Grigson includes lesser-known dishes alongside famous classics. The chapter on Scotland has recipes for Scotch broth, Haggis, Atholl brose and shortbread alongside Scotch woodcock and the sheep&#x27;s head broth Powsowdie. Among the Welsh dishes, cawl and Welsh rabbit are joined by caveach (pickled mackerel) and Lady Lanover&#x27;s salt duck. In the final chapter, Ireland, Irish stew and soda bread are included alongside nettle soup and boxty (potato pancakes).

Each chapter concludes with a section contributed by Derek Cooper on &quot;Regional drink&quot;. For the English regions and Wales the drinks are mostly beers and ciders, with some wines in the south. Sloe gin is included for Cumbria as are whisky for Scotland and whiskey and stout for Ireland.

====&quot;Exotic Fruits and Vegetables&quot; (1986)====

The illustrations play a particularly large part in this book, and the artist, Charlotte Knox, is given equal billing on the covers of both the British and the American editions. The book is described by its publisher as &quot;An illustrated guide to fruits and vegetables from the world&#x27;s hotter climates.&quot; Grigson added notes on the choice, preparation, and culinary use of each fruit or vegetable, and recipes using them. These include mango and carambola salad, mango and paw paw tart, persimmon fudge, and grey mullet with pomegranate sauce in the fruit chapters, and in the vegetable sections, plantain and chicken, snake gourd Malay style, drumstick curry with prawns, and yam and goat meat pottage. The book concludes with sections on 14 herbs and spices, from banana leaf to turmeric.

A US edition (1987) was published by Henry Holt as &quot;Cooking With Exotic Fruits and Vegetables&quot;.

===Short books and booklets===
====&quot;Cooking Carrots&quot; (1975) and &quot;Cooking Spinach&quot; (1976)====
These two booklets, of 36 pages each, were written for Abson Books, Bristol. They follow the same pattern: brief guidance on choosing, buying and preparing the vegetable, followed by 37 recipes apiece. Both books conclude with advice on growing the vegetable. The spinach book was originally sold with a packet of seeds attached to the cover.

====&quot;The Year of the French&quot; (1982)====
This booklet (16 pages) containing six recipes by Grigson, originally published in &quot;The Radio Times&quot;, was issued to accompany the BBC Television series of the same name, &quot;A calendar of French life in 12 film portraits&quot;. Each section of the booklet has a one or two-page introduction by Grigson relating the recipe to a representative French person shown in the series, from the driver of a TGV to the octogenarian head of a beaujolais wine-growers collective.

====&quot;Dishes from the Mediterranean&quot; (1984)====
This publication is a slim (96-page) hardback, with numerous coloured photographs and line drawings of dishes. It was published by Woodhead-Faulkner for the supermarket chain J. Sainsbury. A new and enlarged edition was published in paperback the following year; it was reissued in 1991 with the title &quot;The Cooking of the Mediterranean&quot;.

The book contains chapters on Mediterranean ingredients; sauces and relishes; soups; first courses and meze dishes; fish; meat, poultry and game; rice and bread; and sweet dishes. In addition to descriptions and some historical notes, Grigson includes practical advice such as, for preparing &quot;fegato alla veneziana&quot;, &quot;Half-freeze the liver so that it is solid enough to cut into thin, tissue-paper slivers&quot;. and for a chicken casserole with fifty cloves of garlic (&quot;poulet aux cinquante gousses d&#x27;ail&quot;) reassurance about the number of garlic cloves: &quot;the purée they make is delicious and unidentifiable&quot;.

====&quot;The Cooking of Normandy&quot; (1987)====
This book, published for Sainsbury&#x27;s, follows the pattern of the earlier Mediterranean publication. It is a 96-page, extensively illustrated addition to the &quot;Sainsbury Cookbook&quot; series. Line drawings by Mandy Doyle show details of some of the techniques described in the text. The sections cover ingredients and specialities; soups and first courses; fish and shellfish; meat, poultry and game; and desserts and drinks, with a short epilogue. In her introduction Grigson writes, &quot;For me, Normandy cooking is a return to good, basic home dishes, with the added pleasure of tracking down ingredients of the highest quality.&quot; Although the book was published for and sold by a supermarket chain, Grigson&#x27;s recipes include dishes for which such stores would not be expected to stock key ingredients, such as saddle of rabbit (she suggests using chicken if rabbit is not available) for &quot;lapin à la moutarde&quot; and sorrel for &quot;fricandeau à la oseille&quot; (mentioning spinach as a substitute if necessary).

===Contributions to books by others===
A bibliography published in &quot;Petis Propos Culinaires&quot; in 1991 lists substantial contributions by Grigson to books by other writers: the introduction to &quot;The Book of Ingredients&quot; by Aidan Bailey, Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz and Helena Radecke; one of five introductory essays in &quot;The Shell Guide to France&quot;, in which she offers guidance on food shops in France—poissonerie, pâtisserie, supermarché etc.—and how to shop in them; and a foreword, of about 1600 words, to &quot;The French Cheese Book&quot; by Patrick Rance.

In her foreword to Gillian Riley&#x27;s new translation of Giacomo Castelvetro&#x27;s 1614 book &quot;The Fruit, Herbs and Vegetables of Italy&quot; Grigson describes her acquaintance with Castelvetro&#x27;s work and with the paintings of Giovanna Garzoni which figure largely in the illustrations to the new edition.

WorldCat lists introductions by Grigson to five other books: &quot;The Elle Cookbook&quot; (later republished as &quot;The Art of French Cuisine&quot;); the British edition of &quot;The Chez Panisse Menu Cookbook&quot; by Alice Waters; Francis Bissell&#x27;s &quot;A Cook&#x27;s Calendar&quot;; &quot;A Definitive Catalogue of Toiletries and Comestibles&quot; by Tessa Traeger and Mimi Errington; and a new edition of Geoffrey Grigson&#x27;s &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Flora&quot;.

===Posthumously-published anthologies===
====&quot;The Enjoyment of Food: The Best of Jane Grigson&quot; (1992)====
This 464-page anthology of recipes from Grigson&#x27;s books was compiled by Roy Fullick and published by Michael Joseph. In a preface Fullick writes that it is intended &quot;both as a tribute to Jane Grigson&#x27;s culinary skills and scholarship and as a practical cookery book&quot;.

The book has an introduction by Elizabeth David, recalling her friendship with Grigson and reminding readers that although it was now taken for granted that Grigson was a classic cookery writer, she had burst on the culinary scene in the late 1960s when &quot;the clarity of the writing, and the confident knowledge  ... displayed by this young author were new treats for all of us&quot;. David comments that &quot;this varied yet balanced compilation&quot; would remind readers what a loss the cookery world had sustained by Grigson&#x27;s premature death and inspire them to acquire more of Grigson&#x27;s works. &quot;Hers are books which can be read in the comfort of one&#x27;s sitting room as well as used in the kitchen&quot;.

The main text is in eight sections, with the titles &quot;At home in England&quot;; &quot;At home in France&quot;; &quot;Charcuterie&quot;, &quot;The Mediterranean&quot;, &quot;The Europeans&quot;, &quot;The Americas&quot;, &quot;India and the Far East&quot; and &quot;Treats and celebrations&quot;. There are recipes from writers of the past such as Eliza Acton, Hannah Glasse, Maria Rundell and Auguste Escoffier, and contemporaries including Elizabeth David, Richard Olney, Julia Child, Alice Waters, Antonio Carluccio and Grigson&#x27;s daughter Sophie. The recipes are interspersed with Grigson&#x27;s customary historical background information: there are appearances by Lord Byron, Chaucer, Casanova, Louis XIV, and Evelyn, Sydney Smith and others from &quot;Food with the Famous&quot;.

The book was reissued in 2015 as &quot;The Best of Jane Grigson: The Enjoyment of Food&quot; by Grub Street publishers, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Grigson&#x27;s death.

====&quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Desserts&quot; (1993)====

This is one of two books of Grigson recipes published simultaneously by Michael Joseph. It is a 92-page hardback, in a small-page format of . It is illustrated throughout with line drawings and contains 50 dessert recipes, all taken from previously published Grigson books. Included are some old recipes such as Robert Southey&#x27;s gooseberry pie and Elizabeth Raffald&#x27;s orange custards, and many from overseas (redcurrant tart from Austria, strawberry fritters from France, and sweet pumpkin from Turkey) as well as British favourites like summer pudding.

====&quot;Jane Grigson&#x27;s Soups&quot; (1993)====
Uniform with the preceding volume, the book contains 50 recipes from earlier books by Grigson. Well-known classic soups such as bouillabaisse, gazpacho and cock-a-leekie are interspersed with more unusual recipes including apricot and apple, red onion and wine, and cucumber and sorrel.

====&quot;Puddings&quot; (1996)====
This is a 64-page paperback, in a small format (approximately A6) issued one of the &quot;Penguin 60s series&quot; of miniature books along with, among others, Elizabeth David&#x27;s &quot;Peperonata and Other Italian Dishes&quot;, and a collection of Sophie Grigson&#x27;s recipes, &quot;From Sophie&#x27;s Table&quot;. Like the 1993 desserts collection, above, it reused material from previously published books by Grigson.

==Style, reputation and legacy==
===Style===
Along with Elizabeth David, Grigson is widely credited with transforming the British cookery book into something more than a collection of recipes. Like David&#x27;s, Grigson&#x27;s writing offered not only lists of ingredients and instructions for preparation and cooking, but also interesting historical and social background. The obituaries were warm and full of praise for Grigson&#x27;s style and wide appeal. In &quot;The Independent&quot;, Alan Davidson wrote:

She won to herself this wide audience because she was above all a friendly writer, equipped by both frame of mind and style of writing to communicate easily with them.

However much more she knew about this or that than do the rest of us, she never seemed to be talking down to anyone. On the contrary, she is a most companionable presence in the kitchen; often catching the imagination with a deftly chosen fragment of history or poetry, but never failing to explain the &quot;why&quot; as well as the &quot;how&quot; of cookery. How often have I heard people declare that her recipes are not just a pleasure to read—they always &quot;work&quot;!
Sophie Grigson writes that her mother &quot;thought food was the key to unlocking life&quot;; in the introduction to &quot;Good Things&quot;, Jane stated:

Cooking something delicious is really more satisfactory than painting pictures or throwing pots. ... Food has the tact to disappear, leaving the room and opportunity for masterpieces to come. The mistakes don’t hang on the walls or stand on the shelves to reproach you for ever.

In Elizabeth David&#x27;s view, Grigson&#x27;s books have a &quot;clarity of the writing, and the confident knowledge of its subject and its history&quot;. The sociologist Stephen Mennell believes that Grigson&#x27;s writing, like David&#x27;s, should be considered &quot;gastronomic literature&quot;, rather than cookery book writing, and therefore read as literature; the cultural sociologists Bob Ashley, Joanne Hollows, Steve Jones and Ben Taylor consider that because of the &quot;considerable erudition&quot; in her work, Grigson&#x27;s books can be read as &quot;culinary, historical literature&quot;, rather than cookery books. Geraldene Holt, who thinks Grigson&#x27;s prose is both lyrical and robust, describes Grigson&#x27;s writing style as:
forthright yet entertaining, in a similar vein to that of her eminent forebears who include Morton Shand, Edward Bunyard, Lady Jekyll and Elizabeth David. Jane Grigson&#x27;s essays are, however, memorably enlivened by relevant information and quotations from a remarkably wide range of sources—poets, novelists, gardeners, earlier food writers and cookery manuals.

According to the writers Hazel Castell and Kathleen Griffin, Grigson tried to show food within its historical, social and cultural context, which was &quot;at the very heart of life, so it was natural that literature, history and poetry should be included alongside recipes&quot;. The journalist Deirdre McQuillan considers that the scholarly references are &quot;always there to delight, and never to impress&quot;. Rayner sees in her writing a &quot;lightness of touch&quot; with her use of scholarly material. Christopher Driver writes:

Grigson&#x27;s range was wider than Elizabeth David&#x27;s, for it extended from fish and fungi to the exotic fruits and vegetables that arrived on the international market in the eighties. She would have been the first to acknowledge that Elizabeth&#x27;s culinary scholarship was deeper and her precision superior: one of the little-noticed reasons for Mrs David&#x27;s dominance of her audience in the 1950s was her miraculous sense of lucid detail while Mrs Grigson in the 1970s and 1980s could allow herself in print an element of careless rapture, depending on the commonsense of advanced cooks by then men as well as women.

The literary historian Nicola Humble observes that because of the way Grigson used the historical and literary sources in a more relaxed way, her writing was &quot;less haughty&quot; that David&#x27;s could be.

===Legacy and reputation===
In 1991 the Jane Grigson Trust was set up in Grigson&#x27;s memory. Its stated aim is &quot;to advance the public understanding of food, its cultural and nutritional aspects, and the art of its preparation.&quot; The trust funds the annual Jane Grigson Lecture at the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery every July. In 2015, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her death, the Jane Grigson Trust Award was inaugurated, for the writer of a commissioned first non-fiction book on the subject of food.

It was proposed soon after Grigson&#x27;s death that a library of books about food and cooking should be set up in her honour, under the Jane Grigson Trust. Sophie Grigson made the core of her mother&#x27;s personal collection of food books available on permanent loan. The Jane Grigson Library, inaugurated in 1992, was originally housed at the Guildhall Library in the City of London. By 2005, augmented by donations and bequests, the library had doubled its original size, to more than 4,000 volumes. It was rehoused at Oxford Brookes University in 2005. The library is available for use by scholars, researchers or members of the public. In March 2015 the university held a month-long exhibition, Jane Grigson: Good Things, to examine her life and work.
In 1992 the International Association of Culinary Professionals introduced the Jane Grigson Award, to honour &quot;a book that exemplifies Jane Grigson&#x27;s extraordinary ability to put food in a wider cultural context, using diligent but not pedantic scholarship&quot;. The first winner was the Canadian writer Margaret Visser, for her work &quot;The Rituals of Dinner&quot;. Other winners include, in 1995, Elizabeth David and Jill Norman, &quot;Harvest of the Cold Months: The Social History of Ice and Ices&quot; and, in 2014, Jancis Robinson, Julia Harding and Jose Vouillamoz, for &quot;Wine Grapes&quot;.

In 2015, on the 25th anniversary of her death, &quot;The Food Programme&quot; broadcast a two-part special on Grigson and her impact on the culture of British food.

Humble considers that Grigson&#x27;s work turned the minds of the British public to Industrial Revolution British food cooked by Hannah Glasse, Elizabeth Raffald, Maria Rundell and Eliza Acton; this, Humble states, had &quot;a transformative effect on ... [British] eating habits&quot;. She writes that the reason for the effect is that Grigson&#x27;s writing is reader-friendly and &quot;English Food&quot; made many dishes fashionable again. The chef Shaun Hill believes Grigson&#x27;s &quot;legacy is ongoing—it&#x27;s not finished yet&quot;; he considers that even though much of her work was written 40 years ago, it is still relevant to modern readers. The food writer Diana Henry said of Grigson:

Jane Grigson exemplifies what a food writer should be. She is cerebral and practical—it&#x27;s hard to find practitioners who are both—and she is inclusive. She didn&#x27;t just want to tell you about cooking and impart knowledge, she wanted you to cook too. She was neither grand nor snobbish. You knew that if you ever got the chance to cook for her she wouldn&#x27;t mind if you produced something less than perfect.

<text>Ivan Alexander Getting (January 18, 1912 – October 11, 2003) was an American physicist and electrical engineer, credited (along with Roger L. Easton and Bradford Parkinson) with the development of the Global Positioning System (GPS). He was the co-leader (the other being Louis Ridenour) of the research group which developed the SCR-584, an automatic microwave tracking fire-control system, which enabled M9 Gun Director directed anti-aircraft guns to destroy a significant percentage of the German V-1 flying bombs launched against London late in the Second World War.

Getting was born on January 18, 1912 in New York City to a family of Slovak immigrants from Bytča, Slovakia and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as an Edison Scholar (S.B. Physics, 1933); and Merton College, Oxford as a Graduate Rhodes Scholar (D.Phil., 1935) in astrophysics. 
He worked at Harvard University on nuclear instrumentation and cosmic rays (Junior Fellow, 1935–1940) and the MIT Radiation Laboratory (1940-1950; Director of the Division on Fire Control and Army Radar, Associate Professor 1945; Professor 1946). During the Second World War he was a special consultant to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson on the Army&#x27;s use of radar. He also served as head of the Naval Fire Control Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, member of the Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee on Searchlight and Fire Control, and head of the Radar Panel of the Research and Development Board of the Department of Defense.

In 1950, during the Korean War, Getting became Assistant for Development Planning, Deputy Chief of Staff, United States Air Force; and in 1951, Vice President for Engineering and Research at the Raytheon Corporation (1951-1960). While at Raytheon, Getting also served on the Undersea Warfare Committee of the National Research Council.

In 1960, he was founding President of The Aerospace Corporation (1960-1977). The corporation was established at the request of the Secretary of the Air Force as a non-profit organization to apply &quot;the full resources of modern science and technology to the problem of achieving those continued advances in ballistic missiles and space systems, which are basic to national security.&quot; Getting was a founding member of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Group (later renamed the Scientific Advisory Board) and chair of its Electronics Panel. Getting retired from The Aerospace Corporation in 1977.

In 1978, he served as President of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He also served on the board of directors of the Northrop Corporation and the Board of Trustees of the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan.

==Death==
Getting died on October 11, 2003, in Coronado, California, aged 91.

==Major technical and administrative contributions==
While at MIT Radiation Laboratory, Getting&#x27;s group developed the first automatic microwave tracking fire control radar, the SCR 584. This system, along with the proximity fuze, significantly reduced damage to London by the V-1 flying bombs (also known as &quot;doodlebugs&quot; or &quot;buzz bombs&quot;) launched by Germany from June 1944 of the Second World War, by enabling accurate anti-aircraft fire to destroy the missiles. On 28 August 1944, the last day on which significant numbers of V-1s were launched against London, of 104 fired, 68 were destroyed by artillery, 16 by other means, and 16 crashed.

Getting was an early designer and proponent of satellite-based navigation systems which led to the development and deployment of the Global Positioning System (GPS). While in Raytheon he oversaw the development of the first three-dimensional, time-difference-of-arrival position-finding system – developed in response to an Air Force requirement for a guidance system to be used with a proposed Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) that would achieve mobility by traveling on a railroad system. While at The Aerospace Corporation he oversaw studies on the use of satellites as the basis for a navigation system for vehicles moving rapidly in three dimensions. In addition to his technical contributions to GPS, Getting was a tireless advocate of the project in the face of early resistance from the Pentagon.

He was also involved in the development of the first high-speed flip-flop circuit at Harvard. He also was involved in the development of the Navy GFCS MK-56 anti-aircraft fire control system; as well as in the development and building of a 350 MeV synchrotron at MIT Radiation Laboratory. He also was involved in the development of the Sparrow III and Hawk missile systems; as well as commercial production of transistors at Raytheon.

As a consultant to the US government: implementation of the Quick Reaction Capability for Electronic Counter-Measures; establishment of the SHAPE Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe Laboratory at the Hague; deployment of U.S. air defense capability called the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar system; direction of studies on MX missile basing and long-range combat aircraft; technical analysis and design of a long-range supersonic bomber capable of reaching the former Soviet Union and returning without refueling (Getting&#x27;s work is credited in the reinstatement of the B-1 bomber funding by the U.S. Congress).
As member of the Undersea Warfare Committee of the National Research Council: Associate Director of Project Nobska sponsored by the U.S. Navy and concerning submarine warfare weapons; recommended a submarine-based, solid-propellant intermediate-range ballistic missile that formed the basis for the Polaris missile.

At The Aerospace Corporation: planning for new ballistic missile systems; oversight of space launch systems; development of high-powered chemical lasers; contributions to the Mercury and Gemini space launch systems.

<doc id="1216468" wikidata="Q235186" url="?curid=1216468" title="Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of the Belgians">
<text>Elisabeth of Bavaria (Elisabeth Gabriele Valérie Marie; 25 July 187623 November 1965) was Queen of the Belgians from 23 December 1909 to 17 February 1934 as the wife of King Albert I, and a duchess in Bavaria by birth. She was the mother of King Leopold III of Belgium and of Queen Marie-José of Italy, and grandmother of kings Baudouin and Albert II of Belgium, and Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg.

==Family==

She was born in Possenhofen Castle, her father was Duke Karl Theodor in Bavaria, head of a cadet branch of the Bavarian royal family, and an ophthalmologist. She was named after her paternal aunt, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, better known as Sisi. Her mother was Infanta Maria José of Portugal, daughter of exiled Miguel I of Portugal. Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, Empress Zita, the last Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, and Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma, husband of Grand Duchess Charlotte and brother of Empress Zita, were among Elisabeth&#x27;s first cousins.

An artist himself, Duke Karl-Theodor cultivated the artistic tastes of his family and Elisabeth was raised with a deep love for painting, music and sculpture. At her father&#x27;s clinic, where her mother assisted him as a nurse, Elisabeth obtained exposure to productive labor and to human suffering, unusual for a princess of that time.

==Married life and queenship==
In Munich on 2 October 1900, Duchess Elisabeth married Prince Albert I, second-in-line to the throne of Belgium (after his father Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders). Upon her husband&#x27;s accession to the Belgian throne in 1909, Elisabeth became queen. The Congolese city of Élisabethville, today Lubumbashi, was named in her honor.

They first met in 1897 at the funeral of Elisabeth&#x27;s aunt Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria, who was also the mother-in-law of Albert&#x27;s sister Henriette. At the time, Prince Albert was the heir to his uncle Leopold II of Belgium. Albert was the second son of Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders, and Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a sister of King Carol I of Romania.

At birth, Albert occupied the third place in the line of succession behind his father and elder brother, Prince Baudouin. The unexpected death of Baudouin in January 1891 immediately raised Albert to prominence within his country. A studious, quiet man, Albert was not the choice of heir that King Leopold II would have relished. As the only living male member of his generation, Albert was guaranteed the Crown of the Belgians upon the King&#x27;s death. Albert had two sisters who survived into adulthood, Princess Henriette who married Prince Emmanuel of Orléans, and Princess Joséphine Caroline who married her cousin, Prince Karl-Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, brother of King Ferdinand I of Romania.

In December 1909, Albert and Elisabeth became King and Queen of the Belgians, following the death of Albert&#x27;s uncle, King Leopold II. The new Queen took on a much more public role than her predecessors, getting involved with many charities and organizations, particularly those in the arts and social welfare. She often surrounded herself with famous authors and artists, as well as leading scientists of the day. Her friendly nature, and true care and concern for others, quickly endeared her to the people of Belgium.

When war broke out in 1914, Queen Elisabeth worked with the nurses on the front and helped establish the Symphony Orchestra of the field army. By the end of 1914, she gave Belgian King&#x27;s Messenger Archibald A. Gordon alias Major Gordon the task to participate in the establishment of the Hospital L&#x27;Océan in La Panne. The Queen traveled frequently to the United Kingdom, under the pretext of visiting her children who were studying there. She was often bringing important messages and information to the British government from her husband and his forces. Following the war, the family made a triumphant return to Brussels and set about to rebuild the nation.

During the First World War, she and the King resided in De Panne. The Queen made herself beloved by visiting the front lines and by sponsoring a nursing unit. Despite her German background, she was a popular queen, perceived as eagerly supporting her adoptive country.

From 23 September to 13 November 1919, the Queen, together with the King and Prince Leopold, undertook an official visit to the United States of America. During a journey in the historic pueblo of Isleta in New Mexico, the King awarded the Order of Leopold to Father Anton Docher. As a memento, the King was given a turquoise cross mounted in silver made by the Tiwa people. Ten thousand people traveled to Isleta for the occasion.

==Later years==
On 17 February 1934, Albert I died in a mountain climbing accident in the Ardennes of Belgium, near Namur. He was succeeded by their elder son, King Leopold III. Elisabeth withdrew from public life, so as not to hinder the efforts of her daughter-in-law, now Queen Astrid. However, in August 1935, Queen Astrid was killed in a car crash in Küssnacht am Rigi, Switzerland. Queen Elisabeth returned to public life, doing her best to support her son and his family, and resuming her position as first lady of the land.

Elisabeth lived to see her son become king (but also go into exile and abdicate), her younger son become, effectively, regent of the realm, and her grandson mount the throne.As queen dowager, she became a patron of the arts and was known for her friendship with such notable scientists as Albert Einstein.

During the German occupation of Belgium from 1940 to 1944, she used her influence as queen and her German connections to assist in the rescue of hundreds of Jewish children from deportation by the Nazis. When Brussels was liberated, she allowed her palace to be used for the headquarters of the British XXX Corps, and presented its commander General Horrocks with its mascot, a young wild boar named &#x27;Chewing Gum&#x27;. After the war she was awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government.

During the 1950s, the Queen evoked controversy abroad by visiting the Soviet Union, China and Poland, trips that prompted some to label her as the &quot;Red Queen&quot;. She became the first royal to pay a royal visit to Israel in 1959.

== Death ==
Queen Elisabeth died in Brussels at the age of 89 on 23 November 1965 from a heart attack. She is interred in the royal vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken, Brussels. She was the 1,016th Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa.

==Legacy==
The city of Lubumbashi in Congo (Kinshasa) was formerly known as &quot;Élisabethville&quot;, and it was named in her honor when it was founded in 1910 in what was then the Belgian Congo. It adopted its current name in 1966 when, after six years of wrangling following independence, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu ordered Belgian place names in Congo changed.

The Queen Elisabeth Competition, a longstanding international competition for career-starting classical musicians regularly held in Brussels, is named after her.

Belgian Egyptologist Jean Capart created the Fondation Égyptologique Reine Élisabeth in honor of her visit to Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb on 18 February 1923. The association is now called Association Égyptologique Reine Élisabeth.

<doc id="1216470" wikidata="Q419067" url="?curid=1216470" title="Pseudohalogen">
<text>Pseudohalogens are polyatomic analogues of halogens, whose chemistry, resembling that of the true halogens, allows them to substitute for halogens in several classes of chemical compounds. Pseudohalogens occur in pseudohalogen molecules, inorganic molecules of the general forms &quot;Ps&quot;–&quot;Ps&quot; or &quot;Ps&quot;–X (where &quot;Ps&quot; is a pseudohalogen group), such as cyanogen; pseudohalide anions, such as cyanide ion; inorganic acids, such as hydrogen cyanide; as ligands in coordination complexes, such as ferricyanide; and as functional groups in organic molecules, such as the nitrile group. Well-known pseudohalogen functional groups include cyanide, cyanate, thiocyanate, and azide.

== Common pseudohalogens and their nomenclature ==
Many pseudohalogens are known by specialized common names according to where they occur in a compound. Well-known ones include (the true halogen chlorine is listed for comparison):

 is considered to be a pseudohalogen ion due to its disproportionation reaction with alkali and the ability to form covalent bonds with hydrogen.

==Examples of pseudohalogen molecules==
Examples of symmetrical pseudohalogen compounds (, where Ps is a pseudohalogen) include cyanogen , thiocyanogen and hydrogen peroxide . Another complex symmetrical pseudohalogen compound is dicobalt octacarbonyl, . This substance can be considered as a dimer of the hypothetical cobalt tetracarbonyl, .

Examples of non-symmetrical pseudohalogen compounds (pseudohalogen halides , where Ps is a pseudohalogen and X is a halogen, or interpseudohalogens , where are two different pseudohalogens), analogous to the binary interhalogen compounds, are cyanogen halides like cyanogen chloride (), cyanogen bromide (), nitryl fluoride (), nitrosyl chloride () and chlorine azide (), as well as interpseudohalogens like dinitrogen trioxide (), nitric acid () and cyanogen azide ().

Not all combinations of interpseudohalogens and pseudohalogen halides are known to be stable (e.g. sulfanol ).

==Pseudohalides==
Pseudohalides form univalent anions which form binary acids with hydrogen and form insoluble salts with silver such as silver cyanide (AgCN), silver cyanate (AgOCN), silver fulminate (AgCNO), silver thiocyanate (AgSCN) and silver azide ().

A common complex pseudohalide is a tetracarbonylcobaltate . The acid cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride is in fact quite a strong acid, though its low solubility renders it not as strong as the true hydrogen halide.

The behavior and chemical properties of the above pseudohalides are identical to that of the true halide ions. The presence of the internal multiple bonds does not appear to affect their chemical behavior. For example, they can form strong acids of the type HX (compare hydrogen chloride HCl to hydrogen tetracarbonylcobaltate ), and they can react with metals M to form compounds like MX (compare sodium chloride NaCl to sodium azide ).

Nanoclusters of aluminium (often referred to as superatoms) are sometimes considered to be pseudohalides since they, too, behave chemically as halide ions, forming [[Superatom#Aluminum clusters| (analogous to [[triiodide]] ) and similar compounds. This is due to the effects of [[metallic bonding]] on small scales.

<doc id="1216476" wikidata="Q2270306" url="?curid=1216476" title="Intergiro classification in the Giro d'Italia">
<text>The Intergiro is a competition in the annual multiple stage bicycle race the Giro d&#x27;Italia. It was first introduced in 1989 and discontinued in 2005 as a stand alone Jersey. It was reintroduced in 2024 as number colour. In its initial inception, the calculation for the intergiro was similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders passed through a point and where their times were stopped. As the race went, their times were compiled and the person with the lowest time was the leader of the intergiro classification and wore a blue jersey until 2005. When the competition was revived in 2024, it was changed to points-based scoring, with competitors accumulating points at the designated midway point. The rider with the most points is the leader of the Intergiro classification.
==Blue jersey (1989–2005)==
Somewhere in the middle of each stage there were points where the time of the riders were measured, in the same way as is done at the finish of the stage. The only difference is that the racers ride on after the intergiro point to the regular stage finish. Next to a time measurement, there were bonus seconds to earn just like in the regular stage finish until 2005. That way, riders who were in a group in front of the bunch gained time in the intergiro classification, and riders who were often in this position would have a good position in the classification. The leader of the Intergrio classification would wear a blue jersey.

The intergiro was a way for riders, who weren&#x27;t sprinters or contenders for the GC, to fight for a jersey, and is now similar to a combativity award. There were racers that geared their whole Giro d&#x27;Italia to the intergiro classification, and calmly rode to the finish after the intergiro point was passed. The intergiro classification was replaced by a combination classification in the 2006 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

==Green number (2024–present)==
For the 2024 Giro d&#x27;Italia, the Intergiro competition was revived, but revamped with points-based scoring. For all stages (excepting individual and team time trials), an Intergiro mid-way arch is set up. The first eight riders to pass under the arch receive points toward the Intergiro competition. These riders also receive the same number of points towards the &quot;maglia ciclamino&quot; points classification. Additionally, the first three riders to pass the Intergiro arch receive time bonuses towards the general classification, with three seconds awarded to the first, two to the second, and one for the third. The rider with the most Intergiro points wears a green number.

Points are currently scored with 12 points awarded to the first to reach the Intergiro point, followed by 8 points for the next, and the next 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, until the eighth cyclist who receives 1 point.

<text>Tralles is an irregular lunar impact crater that is attached to the northwestern rim of the much larger crater Cleomedes, in the northeastern part of the Moon. Within one crater diameter to the northwest is Debes. The crater is named after the German mathematician and physicist Johann Georg Tralles.

This is an oddly shaped crater formation with an irregular perimeter. The rugged interior has the appearance of three overlapping craters, with one at the south end, a second to the northeast and a third to the northwest. There are also several tiny craterlets located within the jumbled inner surface.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Tralles.

<doc id="1216479" wikidata="Q939490" url="?curid=1216479" title="Gary Gillespie">
<text>Gary Thompson Gillespie (born 5 July 1960) is a Scottish former professional football centre-back who played for Falkirk, Coventry City, Liverpool, Celtic and the Scotland national team.

==Playing career==
===Falkirk===
Gillespie started his career with Falkirk, and captained them at 17 years of age which set a Scottish record.

===Coventry City===

Coventry City signed Gillespie in 1978 for an initial transfer fee of £40,000, rising to £75,000 on appearances.

===Liverpool===

Gillespie signed for Liverpool in 1983.

His three goals in that double winning season all came in the same game. Hat-tricks are rare for defenders, but Gillespie managed one against Birmingham City on 26 April 1986 at Anfield when he scored twice from open play and completed the threesome with a penalty, after the Liverpool fans chanted his name when it was awarded – normally he would not have taken it. Liverpool won the game 5–0 against an already relegated side, as they moved closer to the title, which was sealed on the final day of the season with a 1–0 win at Chelsea.

By 1988, when he partnered Alan Hansen in all but five of Liverpool&#x27;s games in the league, the Anfield club were a cut above every other side, losing just twice and coasting to the title. In April 1989, Gillespie joined his teammates in mourning the deaths of Liverpool fans at the Hillsborough disaster, during a year in which he again was a regular feature in the team. This time fortunes were reversed – Liverpool won the FA Cup with an emotional victory over fierce Merseyside rivals Everton, but lost the League title to Arsenal with almost the last kick of the season. Gillespie missed that game, however.

In 1990–91, with the absence and eventual retirement of Hansen due to injury, Gillespie was once again a regular in the centre of the Liverpool defence. He played 30 league games and scored once, remaining a regular player even after the resignation of Kenny Dalglish in February 1991 and the arrival of Graeme Souness as manager.

===Celtic===
The arrival of Mark Wright at Liverpool during the close season made it clear that Gillespie would no longer be considered a first choice defender, and he was transferred to Scottish club Celtic for £925,000 on 15 August 1991. He was among manager Liam Brady&#x27;s first signings for the Bhoys, who were being left behind by local rivals Rangers who had been champions for the previous three seasons.

His debut for the Glasgow club came on 17 August 1991, in a 4–1 league win over his former side Falkirk at Parkhead. Gillespie also managed to find the back of the net. He made 69 league appearances for the Parkhead club over three years, scoring twice, but failed to pick up any silverware. His performance was disappointing and he was not considered a good investment by Celtic&#x27;s fans.

===Return to Coventry City and retirement===
Soon after the appointment of Tommy Burns as Celtic manager in 1994, it became apparent that Gillespie was not part of the new manager&#x27;s plans. On 23 August 1994 he returned to Coventry City on a free transfer, making three Premier League appearances during the 1994–95 season. However, he played just three FA Premier League games before a knee injury struck him down, and he finally retired from playing in 1997 after more than two years out of action.

===International===
Gillespie won 13 caps for Scotland. Andy Roxburgh gave him his debut on 14 October 1987 in the 2–0 UEFA European Championship qualifier victory over Belgium at Hampden Park. He was selected for the squad that went to the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, but his only appearance came on 20 June against Brazil at the Stadio delle Alpi Turin, a game the Scots lost 1–0. They failed to progress past the group stages.

<doc id="1216480" wikidata="Q16015553" url="?curid=1216480" title="Lee Siew Choh">
<text>Lee Siew Choh (; 1 November 1917 – 18 July 2002) was a Singaporean politician and physician. A former member of the opposition Workers&#x27; Party (WP), he was the Member of Parliament for Queenstown from 1959 to 1963 and served as the NCMP from September 1988 to August 1991 of the 7th Parliament of Singapore.

Initially a member of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), he became a leader of the breakaway faction of Barisan Sosialis (BS) in 1961. After the BS merged with the Workers&#x27; Party (WP) in 1988, Lee stood as a WP candidate in the 1988 election and became Singapore&#x27;s first Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) due to his best performance among the opposition candidates. He served as the NCMP from September 1988 to August 1991.

==Biography==
Lee was born in Kuala Lumpur and was educated at Victoria Institution. He came to Singapore in 1934 and was trained as a medical doctor at King Edward VII College of Medicine. After graduating in 1942, he joined Kandang Kerbau Hospital as a doctor. He married a volunteer nurse Kathleen Fam Yin Oi (1919 –⁠ 20 April 2018) in 1943 during the Japanese occupation of Singapore, he was later sent to work as a medical officer at the Thai-Burmese border for two years, where the Death Railway was constructed.

== Political career ==
Lee served in Singapore&#x27;s Legislative Assembly as a representative of the PAP following the 1959 election. In 1960 he served as the Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs. In 1961, Lee and 13 other members of the assembly broke away from the PAP and formed the Socialist Front. Lee was noted for his pro-leftist stance and oratory skills. In 1961, he made the longest speech in the history of Singapore&#x27;s Legislative Assembly which lasted seven hours on the subject of Singapore&#x27;s proposed merger with Malaya. Lee led the party in the 1963 elections, in which they won 13 of the 51 seats.

In 1988, Socialist Front merged with the Workers&#x27; Party and Lee stood as a Workers&#x27; Party candidate in the Eunos Group Representation Constituency at the 1988 Singaporean general election, along with Francis Seow and Mohd Khalit bin Mohd Baboo. They lost to the PAP&#x27;s team in the constituency by 49.1% of the votes to 50.9%. As the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s team in Eunos had garnered a higher percentage of the vote than any other opposition losing candidates, the party was eligible to nominate two members of its team from Eunos to become Non-constituency MPs. The party had refused to nominate NCMPs in the past, but this time they nominated Lee and Seow to become NCMPs. Seow was subsequently accused of espionage and fled to the United States before he could take up his NCMP seat. Lee became Singapore&#x27;s first-ever NCMP, serving until the 1991 general election. In Parliament, he raised several issues, including the Internal Security Act, living costs and welfare.

Lee again stood in Eunos GRC at the 1991 Singaporean general election. He and fellow party members Jufrie Mahmood, Neo Choon Aik and Wee Han Kim again lost narrowly to the PAP&#x27;s team by 47.6% of the votes to 52.4%. However no NCMP seats were offered following that election as the opposition parties won a combined total of four elected seats.

Lee left the Workers&#x27; Party in 1996, citing differences with the party&#x27;s leader, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam.

== Personal life ==
Lee married Kathleen Fam and had three sons, Victor Lee Yew Kwong, Peter Lee Yew Chung and David Lee Yew Keong, and a daughter, Lee Yu Lian.

His eldest son, Victor Lee Yew Kwong, died in 1992.

Lee died of lung cancer on 18 July 2002.

<doc id="1216482" wikidata="Q1635663" url="?curid=1216482" title="Folwark">
<text>Folwark is a Polish word derived from the German Vorwerk. A Folwark or Vorwerk is an agricultural estate or a separate branch operation of such an estate, historically a serfdom-based farm and agricultural enterprise (a type of latifundium), often very large. The term has changed its meaning several times throughout history and can therefore be used in various ways.

Originally, the associated agricultural estates were usually located outside fortifications or castles and directly in front of them, and were therefore often referred to as &quot;Folwark&quot; or, in German-speaking regions, &quot;Vorwerk&quot;, meaning advanced work or outwork, a kind of outlying defensive outpost. In place names and field names, the word can still be present in this meaning.

Later, the term was used for outposts of manor farms with estate operations or individual tenant farms. On larger estates with extensive land areas, there were often smaller and more remote branch operations in addition to the main operation. From around the end of the 18th century, these were also frequently referred to as &quot;Folwark&quot; or, in German-speaking regions, &quot;Vorwerk&quot;. In this sense, Folwark or Vorwerk appears as a name or part of a name for a variety of settlements, especially in the northern and eastern parts of Germany.

A term occasionally used in official documents for a Folwark or Vorwerk is &quot;pertinentia&quot; (accessory).

==History==
Folwarks () were operated in the Crown of Poland from the 14th century, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 15th century and in the joint Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the second half of the 16th century. Folwarks also developed in the Commonwealth-controlled Ukrainian lands. The institution survived after the 18th-century Partitions of Poland until the early-20th century.

Folwarks aimed to produce surplus produce for export. The first folwarks were created on Church- and monastery-owned lands. Later, the folwark system was adopted both by the nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;) and by rich peasants (singular: &quot; sołtys&quot;), but the &quot;sołtys&quot; positions were eventually taken over by the &quot;szlachta&quot;.

The term &quot;folwark&quot; came into the Polish language in the 14th century from the German &quot;Vorwerk&quot;, originally the fortified advanced work of a castle and later an outlying manor house that managed a farm estate. The English translation would be &quot;grange&quot;, the historical meaning of which is &quot;an outlying farm with tithe barns belonging to a monastery or feudal lord&quot;.

The development of folwarks was boosted by growing demand for grain and by the profitability of its export, both to Western Europe and within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. That led to the exploitation of serfdom since landowners discovered that instead of collecting money-based rent and taxes, it was more profitable to force the peasantry to work on folwarks. Folwark-based grain export became an important part of the economy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Folwarks were primarily an early modern postfeudal rural formation. They originated as land belonging to a feudal lord (early on a knight) and were not rented out to peasants but worked by the owner&#x27;s own hired labor or servants. The peasants toiled on the lots that they rented from the lord and were obliged to provide complimentary labour for the lord on his folwark, originally a few days per year. From the 16th century, the amount of this mandatory free labor was radically increased, and &quot;szlachta&quot;-sponsored legislation imposed rigid conditions on the peasants, such as the prohibition on worker&#x27;s right to leave a village and seek a new lord. The originally-free peasants became serfs and then fell into a condition of extreme dependency and exploitation, known in Poland as &quot;wtórne poddaństwo&quot; [secondary serfdom]. Their lords, in turn, had become dependent on such free labour, which kept the folwark economy going and competitive on the European grain markets.

In Poland, serfdom was regulated and increased by the Statutes of Piotrków (1496) and by the Privilege of Toruń (1520), statutory privileges granted by kings to &quot;szlachta&quot;. With the fall of prices of agricultural goods at the end of the 17th century, the folwark economy went into crisis, and attempts by the &quot;szlachta&quot; to increase production by increasing the size of their folwarks (usually by appropriating peasant lands) and by demanding more labour (usually by increasing the peasant workload) only compounded the economic crisis and further worsened the fate of the peasants, who had been no poorer than their average counterparts in Western Europe.

In Lithuania, serfdom was fully established during the Volok Reform in the mid-16th century.

Until the late 18th century folwarks remained the basis of &quot;szlachta&quot; economic and political power. After the abolition of serfdom in Poland from the late 18th century onwards, folwarks used paid labour.

Folwarks were abolished by the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland with the Polish Committee of National Liberation decree of 6 September 1944, concerned with agricultural reform. After the end of the Second World War, folwarks were nationalised at the behest of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party, resulting in PGRs, state-owned collective rural enterprises (&quot;Państwowe Gospodarstwo Rolne&quot;, 1949 onwards) or partitioned, usually with little or no compensation to their owners.

<text>Andrew Henry VC (1 November 1823 – 14 October 1870) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross.

==VC action==
Henry received the second Victoria Cross awarded to the Royal Regiment of Artillery for successfully defending his gun at the Battle of Inkerman against heavy odds. Although severely wounded for this action he was also commissioned in the field.

He was at the time of the action a sergeant major of &#x27;G&#x27; Battery Royal Artillery when on a foggy November morning in 1854 Russian troops launched a surprise attack on the British lines and quickly surrounded the Battery. Soon Sgt Andrew Henry was the only British soldier left. With his sword in one arm and using the other to pull a bayonet from his leg he fought valiantly. Sgt Henry received twelve bayonet wounds but lived to receive the Victoria Cross.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of captain. 49 (Inkerman) Battery of the 16th Regiment Royal Artillery is named for the battle of the same name which took place during the Crimean War.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum in Woolwich, London.

<text>The One That Got Away is a 1957 British biographical war film starring Hardy Krüger and featuring Michael Goodliffe, Jack Gwillim and Alec McCowen. The film was directed by Roy Ward Baker with a screenplay written by Howard Clewes, based on the 1956 book of the same name by Kendal Burt and James Leasor.

The film chronicles the true exploits of Oberleutnant Franz von Werra, a Luftwaffe pilot shot down over Britain in 1940. He initially tried to escape while captive in England, but was later successful during transfer to a Canadian POW camp. Von Werra was the only Axis POW to succeed in escaping and make it home during the war.

==Plot==
Luftwaffe fighter pilot Franz von Werra is shot down during the Battle of Britain and captured. At the &#x27;London Cage&#x27;, the military intelligence POW reception centre, he wagers with his RAF interrogator that he will escape within six months. At Trent Park House outside London, von Werra is placed with other officers and their conversations are bugged, but von Werra is too cautious to give much away.

Initially, von Werra is sent to No 1 prisoner-of-war camp Grizedale Hall in the Furness area of Lancashire. During a group walk, he drops over a wall he is lying on and escapes into the hills. It takes an intense manhunt by troops and police to recapture him.

Subsequently, von Werra is sent to a more secure POW camp (based on the Hayes Conference Centre) near Swanwick, Derbyshire. During a German air raid, he and four others escape through a tunnel. The others pair up, but von Werra goes it alone. Reaching Codnor Park railway station, he impersonates a Dutch pilot and claims his Wellington bomber had crashed while on a secret mission. The station master telephones the police to take him to the nearest airfield, RAF Hucknall. Von Werra tricks the RAF duty officer into sending a car. The police arrive first, but with much bravado he delays them until the RAF car arrives. He gets to the airfield and spots a Hawker Hurricane. When his story starts to fray, von Werra creeps away and tries to steal an experimental Hawker Hurricane, getting as far as sitting in it and starting the engine before being caught.

Along with many other POWs, von Werra is then sent by ship to Canada, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia. On the train ride across the country, while the guards are distracted, he escapes near Smiths Falls, Ontario, by jumping from a window. Making his way south hitching rides, von Werra finds the St. Lawrence River not as frozen solid as he has been led to believe, He then steals a rowing boat and pushes it over the ice until he reaches the free-flowing section. He reaches the still-neutral United States almost frozen to death.

Back in the United Kingdom the RAF interrogator receives a postcard from von Werra, featuring a photograph of the Statue of Liberty, informing him that he has lost his bet.

The film&#x27;s epilogue states: &quot;Despite the efforts of the Canadian Government to obtain his return, and of the United States authorities to hold him, Von Werra crossed the border into Mexico. Travelling by way of Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Spain, he reached Berlin on 18 April 1941. On October 25th of the same year, while on patrol, his plane was seen to dive into the sea. No trace of Von Werra was found.&quot;

==Production==
Kenneth More says he was approached to play the lead role but turned it down as he had just played another real-life POW in &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956). John Davis, head of the Rank Organisation, wanted Dirk Bogarde. Director Roy Ward Baker insisted on a German. Rank&#x27;s overseas distribution manager then suggested Hardy Krüger.

A Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Hawker Hurricane were featured in the film. , the Hawker Hurricane IIc (serial number LF363) is still in existence, flying with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.

==Reception==
The film was generally well received by audiences and critics. Howard H. Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted its &quot;... restrained, well-knit scenario.&quot;

According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the film was &quot;in the money&quot; at the British box office in 1957.

In &quot;British Sound Films&quot; David Quinlan writes: &quot;Interesting war story with nail-biting climax.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell opined: &quot;True-life biopic, developed in a number of suspense and action sequences, all very well done.&quot;

The film did extremely well in West Germany, making over £3 million, with a comfortable profit. This prompted producer Julian Wintle to form his own production company and he made two films with German protagonists, &quot;Bachelor of Hearts&quot; (1958, also starring Krüger) and &quot;Tiger Bay&quot; (1959).

<text>The Championship Course is a stretch of the River Thames between Mortlake and Putney in London, England. It is a well-established course for rowing races, particularly the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. The course is on the tidal reaches of the river often referred to as the Tideway. Due to the iconic shape of the Championship Course, in orthopaedic surgery, an S-shaped incision along the crease of the elbow is commonly referred to as &quot;a boat-race incision resembling the River Thames from Putney to Mortlake.&quot;

==History==
In 1845, it was agreed to stage the Boat Race (which had on five previous occasions been rowed from Westminster Bridge to Putney) on a course from &#x27;Putney Bridge to Mortlake Church tower&#x27;. The aim was to reduce the interference from heavy river traffic.

The following year, a race for the Professional World Sculling Championship moved to the course for the first time. The Wingfield Sculls followed in 1861.

The course was later defined by two stones on the southern bank of the river, marked &quot;U.B.R.&quot; for University Boat Race: one just downstream of Chiswick Bridge, close to The Ship public house, and the other just upstream of Putney Bridge. The course distance is 4 miles and 374 yards (), as measured along the centre of the river&#x27;s stream.

Races are always rowed in the same direction as the tide: from Mortlake to Putney on an ebb tide or from Putney to Mortlake on a flood tide.

Since the Boat Race moved to this course in 1845, it has always been raced on a flood tide from Putney to Mortlake except in 1846, 1856 and 1863. The Wingfield Sculls is also raced from Putney to Mortlake. Most other events race on an ebb tide from Mortlake to Putney.

In April 1869, the Harvard University Boat Club challenged the Oxford University Boat Club to an &quot;International University Boat-Race&quot; of coxed fours on the Boat Race course. The race took place on 27 August 1869 and was narrowly won by Oxford. The new Atlantic cable allowed daily reports to be received by all major newspapers across America within 23 minutes of the finish. U.S. public interest in the event was huge, with more publicity than any sporting event to date, and within two years of the event the &quot;newly awakened interest in rowing at many of the most noted seats of learning&quot; doubled the number of boat clubs in the US, and led to the formation of the Rowing Association of American Colleges.

<text>The Roanoke bass (Ambloplites cavifrons) is a species of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of order Centrarchiformes. This species is endemic to rivers in the eastern United States of America, where it is native only to the states of Virginia and North Carolina.

==Description==
Roanoke bass have a robust, compressed body with a large, terminal mouth and a nearly scaleless cheek. The anal fin has a dark margin, the pectoral fin is rounded and the caudal fin is emarginate. The eye is large and red contrasting with the dark brown or olive colour of the body.
The Roanoke bass closely resembles the rock bass (&quot;Ambloplites rupestris&quot;) and the two are easily and often confused notwithstanding different colouring. The Roanoke bass is dark, olive green to olive brown on the back, fading to grayish on the flanks and white on the underside. The spots on its scales are smaller than those of rock bass and they have paler small whitish or yellowish spots on the upper body. The forehead is slightly concave and this and the paucity of scales on the cheek also distinguishes the Roanoke bass. The maximum published total length for this species is and the maximum weight is .

==Distribution==
Roanoke bass are native to a few river systems in Virginia and North Carolina on the Atlantic seaboard of the United States of America. Its range covers the Chowan, Roanoke, Tar, Neuse, and Cape Fear drainage systems but it has seemingly been extirpated from the extreme upper reaches of the Roanoke system. Historical introductions into the middle New River and upper and lower James River drainages for sportfishing did not produce viable populations.

==Habitat and biology==
Roanoke bass are found in large creeks, streams and small rivers where they Prefer clear waters, although some turbidity may be tolerated, as well as in darker stained waters originating from swamps found in rivers such as the Nottoway and Blackwater. They are most frequently recorded in quite deep, fast flowing runs and around rocks and gravel, or at the heads of pools. They are predatory fish which feed in a wide variety of animals such as insects, worms, leeches and crayfish, as well as smaller fish like fathead minnows, golden shiners and gizzard shad. In captivity, the males built and guarded nests in shallow water on gravel, sandy and muddy substrates were avoided.

==Conservation==
Roanoke bass have been assessed by the IUCN as being of least concern but NatureServe assesses the species as vulnerable and states that due to habitat degradation together with hybridisation and competition from introduced rock bass the species has declined.

&quot;Ambloplites cavifrons&quot; is a species of special concern in Virginia and is listed by the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program as &quot;significantly rare.&quot;

== Relationship with humans ==
The IGFA all tackle world record for the species stands at caught in the Nottoway River of Virginia in 1991. On May 7, 2023, a Roanoke bass was caught on the Dan River in Virginia.

<text>Ewa Maria Demarczyk (16 January 1941 – 14 August 2020) was a Polish singer, generally associated with the sung poetry genre and the Piwnica pod Baranami cabaret.

Demarczyk was recognized as one of the most talented and charismatic singers in the history of Polish music. She was praised for her unique interpretations, expression, and unusual stage personality. In the 1960s, she drew comparisons with Édith Piaf. In Poland, she was often referred to as &quot;the Dark Angel&quot;.

==Biography==
She started her career in 1961, when she joined Jagiellonian University Medical College&#x27;s student cabaret Cyrulik. After a year she left Cyrulik for Piwnica pod Baranami, where she met Zygmunt Konieczny, with whom she would work for the next four years.

Her first big success was a performance at the 1963 National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, where she received an award for the songs &quot;Karuzela z madonnami&quot;, &quot;Taki pejzaż&quot; and &quot;Czarne anioły&quot;. Later the same year, she sang at the Sopot International Song Festival and was named the best artist of 1963 by Polish journalists. In 1964 she took second place in Sopot for &quot;Grande Valse Brillante&quot;. She went on to perform at Olympia in Paris, at Bruno Coquatrix&#x27;s invitation, as well as at a ceremony celebrating the 20th anniversary of United Nations.

In 1966, Demarczyk graduated from the Ludwik Solski Academy for the Dramatic Arts (however, she never had any film roles). The same year she teamed up with another composer, Andrzej Zarycki. 1967 saw the release of her first album, &quot;Ewa Demarczyk śpiewa piosenki Zygmunta Koniecznego&quot;, which proved to be a major success and was later certified platinum for selling over 100,000 copies.

At the turn of the 1960s and 1970s, she travelled extensively around the world to countries such as Italy, France, Germany, Cuba, Brazil, Mexico, United States, Australia, United Kingdom and Finland. She performed in numerous concert halls, including Carnegie Hall in New York and the Chicago Theatre.

Demarczyk left the Piwnica pod Baranami in 1972. Two years later her next album was issued, including some new Polish songs and four Russian-language versions of her previous hits. The album was released in Russia by the state-owned label Melodiya and sold several million copies. Later in the 1970s she was awarded an honorary award at Opole Festival and the Order of Polonia Restituta.

Her 1982 live album, simply titled &quot;Live&quot;, turned out to be a big success, achieving gold certification in Poland. In the mid-1980s Demarczyk founded her own theatre in Kraków. In spite of formal difficulties, it was soon shut down, although it generated interest. In the 1990s her albums were re-released on CD and Demarczyk received a number of awards recognising her input to Polish culture. She continued to perform live until the late 1990s.

She gave her last concert on 8 November 1999 at the Grand Theatre in Poznań and afterwards she completely withdrew from public life. In 2001 a foundation, Teatr Ewy Demarczyk, was created. She died on 14 August 2020, aged 79.

==Style==
Demarczyk&#x27;s repertoire consisted of demanding, not easily accessible interpretations of poems. Since her songs are often based on works by &quot;classical&quot; poets – both Polish such as Julian Tuwim and Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński and international like Goethe, Mandelstam, Rainer Maria Rilke, as well as avant-garde writers such as Miron Białoszewski – the genre that Demarczyk is associated with is called sung poetry.

In her performances, she united both dramatic theatrical expression and vocal art (she was a graduate of both a drama school and conservatory, where she studied the piano). The songs she performed were essentially short, intense musical dramas.

<text>Clock or Sundial is a luck-based patience or solitaire card game with the cards laid out to represent the face of a clock. It is closely related to Travellers.

Clock is a purely mechanical process with no room for skill, and the chances of winning are exactly 1 in 13. It has a feature described by Parlett as &#x27;shuttling&#x27; in which a card is placed at the bottom of a pile and the next card to be played comes off the top of the same pile.

== Names ==
This game was known in the 19th century as The Clock, but the name has since been shortened to Clock. It was a variation of Wandering Card, an old game of European origin. Some sources give alternative names as Hidden Cards, Four of a Kind and Travellers. However, Four of a Kind has a different layout and mechanism, whilst Hidden Cards and Travellers are also variations of Wandering Card with different layouts and shuttling procedures from Clock.

There are other unrelated patiences or solitaires also sometimes called Clock or The Clock:

* Big Ben
* Grandfather&#x27;s Clock
* Clock, member of the Simple Addition or Totals family, related to Block Eleven
The game also was known as Clocktime.

==Rules==
One deck of cards (minus jokers) is used. The deck is shuffled and twelve piles of four cards each are laid out, face down, in a circle. The remaining four cards are placed, also face down, in a pile in the center of the circle.

The twelve positions around the circle represent the 12-hour clock and the pile in the middle represents the hands.

Play starts by turning over the top card of the central pile.
When a card is revealed, it is placed face up under the pile at the corresponding hour (i.e., Ace = 1 o&#x27;clock, 2 = 2 o&#x27;clock, etc. The Jack is 11 o&#x27;clock and the Queen is 12 o&#x27;clock) and the top card of the pile of that hour is turned over. If a King is revealed, it is placed face up under the central pile.

Play continues in this fashion and the game is won if all the cards (including four Kings) are revealed; turning up the fourth king means you will have completed the clock and won the game. The game is lost if the fourth King is turned up while any cards remain face down.

==Variations==
In a variation of Clock commonly called Watch, players can continue the play when the fourth king appears, by replacing it with a still face-down card. The game ends when that fourth king reappears.

The Clock (sometimes also called &quot;German Clock&quot;) is a stock and waste type of solitaire originally called &quot;Die Uhr&quot;, and described in a German solitaire book by Rudolf Heinrich from 1976. This gives rules for very different game-play that depends on skill not to miss cards that can be played to the foundations.

<text>The Transnistrian ruble (alternatively rubla or rouble; , ; ; ) is the currency of the internationally unrecognized state of Transnistria. It is divided into 100 kopecks.

Since Transnistria is a polity with no credible international recognition and its territory is formally part of Moldova, its currency has no ISO 4217 code, and thus Transnistria cannot participate in any global card payment processing network. Cards are accepted, but only on the Russian developed MIR network. However, unofficially some Transnistrian organisations, such as Agroprombank and Gazprombank, used the code PRB, a code reserved for Puerto Rico (ISO 3166-1 country code &quot;PR&quot;). The Transnistrian Republican Bank sometimes uses the code RUP, a code reserved for Russia (ISO 3166-1 country code &quot;RU&quot;).

==First ruble (1994)==

Soviet banknotes were used in the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic after its formation in 1990. When the former Soviet republics began issuing their own currencies, Transnistria was flooded with Soviet rubles. In an attempt to protect its financial system, in July 1993, the Transnistrian government bought used Goznak-printed Soviet and Russian notes dated 1961–1992 and modified these notes by applying adhesive stamps bearing the image of General Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov, founder of Tiraspol, and the notes&#x27; corresponding denomination. These stamped notes replaced unstamped Soviet and Russian notes at par. It is thought that most uncirculated notes bearing these stickers were created after 1994 specifically for collectors.

==Second ruble (1994–2000)==

The first, provisional issues were replaced in August 1994 by a new ruble, equal to 1,000 old rubles. This currency consisted solely of banknotes and suffered from high inflation, necessitating the issue of notes overstamped with higher denominations. Although issued in 1994, some notes (50 to 5,000 rubles) were issued dated 1993.

===Banknotes===

==Third ruble (2000–present)==

In 2000, a new ruble was introduced at a rate of 1 new ruble = 1,000,000 second rubles. This new currency consists of both coins and banknotes.

===Coins===


Coins are of 1 to 50 kopecks and are made from aluminium or copper-zinc and are similar to Soviet-era coinage. The 1 kopeck coins were withdrawn from circulation in January 2009.

On 22 August 2014, the Transnistrian Republican Bank issued coins made of composite materials and come in denominations of 1, 3, 5 and 10 rubles.

====Commemorative coins====
Since 2000, the Transnistrian Republican Bank has issued many commercial commemorative coins made from silver and gold. Their mintage numbers were very low, ranging between 500 and 5,000. Topics included for example &quot;Ancient fortresses on the river Dniester&quot;, &quot;The outstanding people of Transdniestria&quot; and &quot;Red book of Transdniestria&quot;. A complete listing can be found on the website of the Transnistrian Republican Bank.

====Mint====

When it was founded, Transnistria did not have its own mint, thus a foreign mint had to be found to strike Transnistrian coins. The Mint of Poland (Mennica Polska) in Warsaw was selected. Coins dated 2000 were struck in Warsaw and transported via Ukraine to Transnistria in trucks belonging to the Transnistrian Republican Bank.

The Moldovan government was displeased with this situation, since they viewed it as a &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of Transnistria. In October 2001, Moldovan president Vladimir Voronin addressed the issue with his Polish counterpart.

The Polska Mennica (Mint of Poland) responded to the criticism by stating that because the Transnistrian ruble is not internationally recognized as a currency, they were producing tokens and not coins, which is normal business for mints.

The conflict came to a head when, in December 2004, Ukrainian customs confiscated a truck with US$117,000 worth of Transnistrian coins near Lviv. The coins were handed over to Moldovan authorities, who in response again protested with the Polish government.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote another letter to Polska Mennica (Mint of Poland) in April 2005. They warned that continued production of Transnistrian coins would endanger relations with Ukraine and Moldova and damage the image of Poland abroad. The Polska Mennica (Mint of Poland) bowed to the pressure and cancelled its contract with Transnistria that same month.

For Transnistria there was then no other solution but to make future coins locally. Thus, on 18 November 2005, the Tiraspol Mint (Тираспольский монетный двор) was opened in the presence of President Igor Smirnov.

===Banknotes===

Notes are issued by the Transnistrian Republican Bank () in 2000 as part of a currency reform, with 1 ruble equal to 1 million (1,000,000) old rubles. The notes come in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 rubles.

====2000 Series====

====2007 Series====

In 2007, a new series replaced the above banknotes of denominations 1 to 100 rubles. The new notes have the same themes but a new design and improved security features.

====Commemorative banknotes====
Along with the issuance of banknotes for general circulation, the Transnistrian Republican Bank also issues commemorative banknotes focusing on the country&#x27;s history and events relating to its development as an independent nation. The commemorative banknotes consist of an overprint applied on the note and are issued both for general circulation and also sold in limited numbers for the numismatic market.

===Exchange rates===
The currency is &quot;de facto&quot; pegged to the United States dollar. The central bank determines each workday whether it is appropriate to devalue the currency against the US dollar.

As of 12 October 2024
(Transnistrian ruble per foreign currency unit)
*US dollar: 16.1000 rubles
*Euro: 17.6150 rubles
*Russian ruble: 0.1676 rubles
*Ukrainian hryvnia: 0.3907 rubles
*Moldovan leu: 0.8821 rubles
*Romanian leu: 3.5 rubles

On 11 February 2009, the exchange rate was set to 9 Transnistrian rubles per dollar. It was changed to 9.40 rubles on 5 March 2010, 9.80 on 24 September 2010, and 10.20 on 14 December 2010. By 2013, the value of the ruble had dropped to 11.10 rubles per dollar. This was further changed to 11.30 per dollar on 16 March 2016. On 17 June 2017, the currency was devalued to 15 rubles per dollar. It was set to 16 per dollar on 12 January 2018. The most recent change was made on 5 April 2018, when it was set to 16.10 rubles per dollar.

===Acceptance outside Transnistria===
The Transnistrian ruble is generally not accepted as currency outside of Transnistria, although some bus companies with connections to Tiraspol accept the Transnistrian ruble at the Chișinău bus station as well as local shops in Varnița.

<doc id="1216535" wikidata="Q417902" url="?curid=1216535" title="Remifentanil">
<text>Remifentanil, marketed under the brand name Ultiva is a potent, short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic drug. It is given to patients during surgery to relieve pain and as an adjunct to an anaesthetic. Remifentanil is used for sedation as well as combined with other medications for use in general anesthesia. The use of remifentanil has made possible the use of high-dose opioid and low-dose hypnotic anesthesia, due to synergism between remifentanil and various hypnotic drugs and volatile anesthetics.

== Medical uses ==
Remifentanil is used as an opioid analgesic that has a rapid onset and rapid recovery time. It has been used effectively during craniotomies, spinal surgery, cardiac surgery, and gastric bypass surgery. While opiates function similarly, with respect to analgesia, the pharmacokinetics of remifentanil allows for quicker post-operative recovery.

Remifentanil can be administered as part of an anesthesia technique called TIVA (total intravenous anesthesia) using computer controlled infusion pumps in a process called TCI (target controlled infusion). A target plasma concentration is entered as ng/mL into the pump, which calculates its infusion rate according to patient factors like age and weight. Induction levels of 40 ng/mL are commonly used, but it generally varies between 3–8 ng/mL. For certain surgical procedures that produce particularly strong stimuli a level of up to 15 ng/mL might be needed. The relatively short context-sensitive half-life of remifentanil allows the desired blood plasma level to be achieved quickly, and also for the same reason, recovery occurs quickly. This allows remifentanil to be used in unique circumstances such as cesarean section.

Remifentanil&#x27;s short context-sensitive half-life makes it ideal for intense pain of short duration. As such, it has been used for analgesia in labor successfully; however, it is not as effective as epidural analgesia.

In combination with propofol, remifentanil is used for anesthesia of patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy.

Remifentanil has been used with some success to circumvent naltrexone in patients who are in need of pain management.

=== Available forms ===
It is administered in the form &quot;remifentanil hydrochloride&quot; and in adults is given as an intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 0.1 microgram per kilogram per minute to 0.5 (μg/kg)/min. Children may require higher infusion rates (up to 1.0 (μg/kg)/min). The clinically useful infusion rates are 0.025–0.1 (μg/kg)/min for sedation (rates adjusted to age of patient, severity of their illness and invasiveness of surgical procedure). Small amounts of other sedative medications are usually co-administered with remifentanil to produce sedation. Clinically useful infusion rates in general anesthesia vary but are usually 0.1–1 (μg/kg)/min.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Remifentanil is considered a metabolic soft drug, one that is rapidly metabolized to an inactive form. Unlike other synthetic opioids which are hepatically metabolized, remifentanil has an ester linkage which undergoes rapid hydrolysis by non-specific tissue and plasma esterases. This means that accumulation does not occur with remifentanil and its context-sensitive half-life remains at 4 minutes after a 4-hour infusion.

Remifentanil is metabolized to a compound (remifentanil acid) which has 1/4600th the potency of the parent compound.

Due to its quick metabolism and short effects, remifentanil has opened up new possibilities in anesthesia. When remifentanil is used together with a hypnotic (i.e. one that produces sleep) it can be used in relative high doses. This is because remifentanil is rapidly eliminated from the blood plasma on termination of the remifentanil infusion; hence the effects of the drug quickly dissipate even after very long infusions. Owing to synergism between remifentanil and hypnotic drugs (such as propofol) the dose of the hypnotic can be substantially reduced. This leads often to more hemodynamic stability during surgery and a quicker post-operative recovery time.

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Comparing its analgesia-sedation effect in ventilated patients, remifentanil may be superior to morphine but not to fentanyl.

==Side-effects==
Remifentanil is a specific μ-receptor agonist. Hence, it causes a reduction in sympathetic nervous system tone, respiratory depression and analgesia. The drug&#x27;s effects include a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate and arterial pressure and respiratory rate and tidal volume. Muscle rigidity is sometimes noted.

The most common side effects reported by patients receiving this medication are a sense of extreme &quot;dizziness&quot; (often short lived, a common side effect of other fast-acting synthetic phenylpiperidine narcotics such as fentanyl and alfentanil) and intense itching (pruritus), often around the face. These side effects are often controlled by either altering the administered dose (decreasing or in some cases, increasing the dose) or by administering other sedatives that allow the patient to tolerate or lose awareness of the side effect.

Because pruritus is partially due to excessive serum histamine levels, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are often co-administered. This is done with care, however, as excessive sedation may occur.

Nausea can occur as a side effect of remifentanil, however, it is usually transient in nature due to the drug&#x27;s short half-life which rapidly removes it from the patient&#x27;s circulation once the infusion is terminated.

=== Abuse potential ===
Remifentanil, being a μ-receptor agonist, functions like other μ-receptor agonists, such as morphine and codeine; it can cause euphoria and has the potential for abuse. However, due to its rapid metabolism and short-acting half-life the likelihood of abuse is quite low. Nevertheless, there have been some documentations of remifentanil abuse.

== Society and culture ==

=== Development and marketing ===
Prior to the development of remifentanil, most short-acting hypnotics and amnestics faced issues with prolonged use, where accumulation would result in unfavorable lingering effects during post-operative recovery. Remifentanil was designed to serve as a strong anesthetic with an ultra-short and predictable duration that would not have accumulation issues.

Remifentanil was patented by Glaxo Wellcome Inc. and was FDA approved on July 12, 1996. Its patent ended on the 10th of September 2017.

=== Legal status ===
In Hong Kong, remifentanil is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong&#x27;s Chapter 134 &quot;Dangerous Drugs Ordinance&quot;. It can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined (). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a () fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a () fine and/or 7years of jail time.

Remifentanil is a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance in the United States with a DEA ACSCN of 9739 and a 2013 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 3,750grams, unchanged from the prior year.

== Tert-butyl remifentanil ==
Replacing the methyl ester on the long chain with a tert-butyl ester makes the remifentanil analogue 150.000 times more potent than morphine and 210 times more potent than remifentanil itself, which makes it one of the most potent fentanyl analogues known. The tert-butyl group also makes it more resistant to hydrolysis and extends its half life in the body.

<doc id="1216540" wikidata="Q4930331" url="?curid=1216540" title="Bluegrass Balloon Festival">
<text>The Bluegrass Balloon Festival, formerly called the Adam Matthews Balloon Festival, was the fifth largest hot air balloon festival in the United States, and the largest in the state of Kentucky. From 1999 to 2009, it was held annually in late September at Bowman Field in Louisville, Kentucky.

The festival featured up to 100 hot air balloons participating in three early morning balloon races and two evening balloon glows. Other events included four live concerts, 11 free children&#x27;s activities, and a car show featuring more than 150 classic, exotic, and modified cars. There was also a balloon education center teaching the fundamentals of ballooning, as well as food, a beer garden, and other activities. It was common to have crowds of more than 100,000 on the busiest day of the festival. Many events were held during the three days. One of the more popular attractions was the evening balloon glow, when balloons were inflated and glow to music after dark. Another was the early morning balloon race with a cash prize for the winner.

The Adam Matthews Balloon Festival celebrated its last festival in September 2006. The festival was purchased by The Spirit of Kentucky Foundation and was renamed the Bluegrass Balloon Festival.

==History==
For many years, local pilots gathered to give back to the community by holding a year-end balloon glow at Bowman Field. When the local event was canceled due to the lack of funds, Adam Burckle, the founder of the Adam Matthews Cheesecake Company, came up with an idea that led to the festival.

The first year event was held with 52 balloons in attendance. Many balloons were local, although some pilots traveled from far across the United States. The initial event raised $20,000 for the Dream Factory, an organization that helps grant wishes to children with life-threatening diseases.

The second annual event was held in 2000 with 70 balloons from across the country. The event became so popular that the entry was limited to 70 balloons and there was a waiting list.

The events of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. put some doubt into the flights of the festival, as civil aviation flights (including ballooning) were restricted for a period of time after the attacks. The festival petitioned the National Safety Council and the FAA to allow the flight of hot air balloons, which was approved only two days before the festival. Approximately 75 balloons attended the event that year, making it the largest balloon festival held in Kentucky&#x27;s history.

By 2002, the event had grown to 85 registered balloons, and WHAS-TV 11, a local television station in Louisville, featured the evening Balloon Glow during its prime time broadcast. Meijers sponsored the Starship Concert, and Dean&#x27;s Milk sponsored the balloon races with more than $27,500 in prize money. Pilots travelled from as far as away as New Zealand, Canada and the Western U.S.; they raised more than $35,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Louisville Zoo, and the Crusade for Children.

By 2003, the festival had grown to 100 registered balloons, with more than $40,000 in prizes awarded. There was also six hours of live TV coverage, and more than 120,000 people attended the event over three days. Portions of the parking fees benefited the Crusade for Children, and additional funds were raised for the Louisville Zoo and several other local non-profit groups.

In 2007 the Adam Matthews Balloon Festival was purchased by the Spirit of Kentucky Foundation for $1, and the event was renamed the Bluegrass Balloon Festival. It continued to be the largest ballooning event in Kentucky and the fifth largest in the United States.

The festival was cancelled in 2010 for various reasons. It was to return in 2011 with a new name, &quot;Spirit of Kentucky Balloon Festival&quot;, but that was cancelled as well. There has been no sign of the existence of the festival since that time.

<text>Calm Animals is the fifth studio album by British band the Fixx, released on February 7, 1989. The single &quot;Driven Out&quot; gave them a No. 1 song on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in early 1989, and reached No. 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single &quot;Precious Stone&quot; reached the top 25 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart later that year. &quot;Calm Animals&quot; was the Fixx&#x27;s only album to be released on RCA Records.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; noted that &quot;the rock-oriented &quot;Calm Animals&quot; ... has no songs worth mentioning.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the album &quot;has some familiar moments when they recapture their old seductive combination of sin and synth, but the ska-funkincense that powered early Fixx has been flattened to pop-metal.&quot;

<text>Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes is an album by the Canadian alt-country band Cowboy Junkies, released in 1999. It was the band&#x27;s first independent release after the end of their contract with Geffen Records. The album is a compendium of tracks that the band had recorded but not previously released on an album. Two tracks have been released earlier as B-sides on Cowboy Junkies&#x27; singles, &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot; on &quot;Southern Rain&quot; and &quot;Leaving Normal&quot; on &quot;Anniversary Song&quot;. It was released on both True North Records and Latent Recordings in Canada, and on Valley Records in the United States.

== Album background ==
&quot;Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes&quot; was developed after the tour for &quot;Miles from Our Home&quot;. Geffen Records had gone through a merger, and in the process had stomped and squished &quot;Miles from Our Home&quot;, which caused the Cowboy Junkies to stand back and start making changes to take control of their music. They revived their early label, Latent Recordings, and set up a web-site for the label to share their music and thoughts with their fans. One of the first things they did was gather up several of their &quot;orphaned&quot; songs to release them to the world. The compilation album of rare and never before heard tracks, &quot;Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes&quot;, became the first release on Latent Recordings since &quot;The Trinity Session&quot;.

The hidden track on the album, &quot;My Father&#x27;s House&quot;, is an a capella rendition of a Bruce Springsteen song that the band occasionally performed live. The version on the album was recorded during the Sharon Temples recordings sessions. As Michael Timmins states, &quot;Margo was singing to help Peter Moore find his mic placement. The rest of us had obviously been sitting around too long and were getting bored so we spontaneously joined in. Just one of those weird, beautiful moments...and the tape was running.&quot;

<text>F.D. Roosevelt State Park is a Georgia state park located near Pine Mountain and Warm Springs. The park is named for former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who sought a treatment for his paralytic illness in nearby Warm Springs at the Little White House. The park is located along the Pine Mountain Range. The western portion of the park, formerly named Pine Mountain State Park, was named a National Historic Landmark in 1997. F.D. Roosevelt State Park is Georgia&#x27;s largest state park.

Several structures in the park were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the Great Depression, including a stone swimming pool and Roosevelt&#x27;s favorite picnic spot at Dowdell&#x27;s Knob, overlooking the valley below. President Roosevelt would take polio patients with depression along on picnics at Dowdell&#x27;s Knob.

==History==
The region containing the modern-day park was inhabited by the Creek Nation until ceded under the Treaties of 1825 and 1826, which granted the territories between the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers to the State of Georgia. An influx of settlers established the town of Kings Gap, named after King&#x27;s Trading Post located near the modern-day Liberty Bell Pool. The town eventually vanished by the 20th century.

In 1924, Franklin Delano Roosevelt first visited the warm springs located near the towns of Warm Springs and Bullochville. He came to the springs seeking relief from the symptoms of the paralytic illness he had contracted three years earlier. In 1927, Roosevelt and others established the Warm Springs Foundation, later known as the Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, which established therapeutic programs utilizing the area&#x27;s mineral springs. Since then, the institute has developed into a complex of facilities helping those with disabilities.

Just prior to being elected president of the United States in 1932, Roosevelt built a residence nearby which would come to be known as the Little White House. After his election to the presidency, he spearheaded the establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It was this organization which, in 1935, established a camp near the modern-day park entrance on Highway 354. From this camp, the young men of the CCC constructed much of the present state park, including the Liberty Bell Pool, the Roosevelt Lodge, several cabins, the Lake Delanor and its companion, the Lake Franklin. Because of the well-preserved CCC design, layout, and buildings of the western half of the park, and for its association with Roosevelt, the area was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1997.

==Geology and geography==
F.D. Roosevelt State Park is Georgia&#x27;s largest state park. The park is located on the Pine Mountain Ridge, which is Georgia&#x27;s southernmost mountainous area (and the southernmost mountainous area in the United States east of the Mississippi River). The Pine Mountain Ridge, which extends into Alabama, is composed of quartzite rock formations. It is geologically a feature of the Piedmont Plateau, not the Appalachian Mountains farther north.

Dowdell&#x27;s Knob is the highest point in F. D. Roosevelt State Park, at 1,395 feet. The knob was named for two pioneer Harris County settlers: Lewis &amp; James Dowdell.

The park contains the long Pine Mountain Trail, a scenic nature path that winds through both hardwood and pine forests, featuring hickory and several species of oak; forest undergrowth includes buckeye, pawpaw, azalea, blueberry and huckleberry. The trail has twenty one primitive back country campsites for backpackers. The Pine Mountain Trail is wholly maintained by the volunteers of the Pine Mountain Trail Association. In addition, the park contains two stocked fishing lakes and a historic trading post. There is a clump of surviving resistant chestnut trees in the park.

==Recent events==
On April 12, 2007, the 62nd anniversary of Roosevelt&#x27;s death, a 1,200-pound bronze statue was unveiled at Dowdell&#x27;s Knob. The statue depicts Roosevelt sitting on his removable car seat and wearing his leg braces. The statue, commissioned by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, was created by Atlanta sculptor Martin Dawe.

During the 2011 Super Outbreak, an EF2 tornado caused severe damage to the park, especially in the campgrounds. It was estimated that 30% of the structures in one of the park&#x27;s group campground areas were destroyed.
