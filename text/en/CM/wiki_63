<text>A rhapsode () or, in modern usage, rhapsodist, refers to a classical Greek professional performer of epic poetry in the fifth and fourth centuries BC (and perhaps earlier). Rhapsodes notably performed the epics of Homer (&quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;) but also the wisdom and catalogue poetry of Hesiod and the satires of Archilochus and others. Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Ion&quot;, in which Socrates confronts a star player rhapsode, remains the most coherent source of information on these artists. Often, rhapsodes are depicted in Greek art, wearing their signature cloak and carrying a staff. This equipment is also characteristic of travellers in general, implying that rhapsodes were itinerant performers, moving from town to town. Rhapsodes originated in Ionia, which has been sometimes regarded as Homer&#x27;s birthplace, and were also known as Homeridai, disciples of Homer, or &quot;singers of stitched lays.&quot;

==Etymology and usage==
The term &quot;rhapsode&quot; is derived from &quot;rhapsōidein&quot; (ῥαψῳδεῖν), meaning &quot;to sew songs [together]&quot;. This word illustrates how the oral epic poet, or &quot;rhapsode&quot;, would build a repertoire of diverse myths, tales and jokes to include in the content of the epic poem. Thus it was possible, through experience and improvisatory skills, for him to shift the content of the epos according to the preferred taste of a specific location&#x27;s audience. However, the outer framework of the epic would remain virtually the same in every &quot;singing&quot;, thus securing the projection of underlying themes such as of morality or honour. The performance of epic poetry was called in classical Greek &quot;rhapsōidia&quot; (ῥαψῳδία), and its performer &quot;rhapsōidos&quot;. The word does not occur in the early epics, which use the word aoidos (ἀοιδός &quot;singer&quot;) for performers in all genres, including this one. It has been argued by Walter Burkert that &quot;rhapsōidos&quot; was by definition a performer of a fixed, written text.

The word &quot;rhapsōidos&quot; was in use as early as Pindar (522–443 BC), who implies two different explanations of it, &quot;singer of stitched verse&quot;, and &quot;singer with the staff&quot;. Of these the first is etymologically correct; the second was suggested by the fact, for which there is early evidence, that the singer was accustomed to hold a staff (ῥάβδος &quot;rhabdos&quot;) in his hand, perhaps, like the sceptre in the Homeric assembly, as a symbol of the right to a hearing or to &quot;emphasize the rhythm or to give grandeur to their gestures&quot;. The etymological meaning is interesting because it is an exact metaphor for what oral narrative poets do: they stitch together formulas, lines and type-scenes in the course of performance. There are indications in Pindar and other authors that oral epic was still a living and popular tradition in the early fifth century BC; all the later evidence, however, is that rhapsodes worked from written texts, and in some cases were compelled by law to do so.

==Performance==
It is certain that rhapsodes performed competitively, contending for prizes at religious festivals, and that this practice was already well-established by the fifth century BC. The &quot;Iliad&quot; alludes to the myth of Thamyris, the Thracian singer, who boasted that he could defeat even the Muses in song. He competed with them, was defeated, and was punished for his presumption with the loss of his ability to sing. Historically, the practice is first evident in Hesiod&#x27;s claim that he performed a song at the funeral games for Amphidamas in Euboea and won a prize. Competitive singing is depicted vividly in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot; and mentioned in the two &quot;Hymns to Aphrodite&quot;. The latter of these may evidently be taken to belong to Salamis in Cyprus and the festival of the Cyprian Aphrodite, in the same way that the &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot; belongs to Delos and the Delian gathering.

An early historical mention of rhapsodes occurs in the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus (c. 440 BC). He tells the story that at Sicyon the ruler Cleisthenes (600–560 BC) expelled the rhapsodes on account of the poems of Homer, because they promoted Argos and the Argives. This description applies very well to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, in which &quot;Argives&quot; is one of the alternate names for the Greek warriors; it may have suited the &quot;Thebaid&quot; still better, since Argos was named in the first line of that poem. The incident seems to show that poems performed by rhapsodes had political and propagandistic importance in the Peloponnese in the early sixth century BC.

At Athens, by 330 BC, there was a law that rhapsodes should perform the Homeric poems at every Panathenaic festival; this law is appealed to as glory of Athens by the orator Lycurgus. Perhaps therefore such a custom was exceptional, and we do not know when or by whom it was introduced, although the Platonic dialogue &quot;Hipparchus&quot; (not really by Plato, but probably of the fourth century BC) attributes it to Hipparchus, son of Peisistratos (Athens). The &quot;Hipparchus&quot; adds that the law required the rhapsodists to follow on from one another in order, &quot;as they still do&quot;. This recurs in a different form in the much later statement of Diogenes Laërtius (1.2.57) that Solon made a law that the poems should be recited &quot;with prompting&quot;. Many Athenian laws were falsely attributed to early lawgivers, but it is at least clear that by the fourth century the Homeric poems were a compulsory part of the Panathenaea, and were to be recited in order. They are too long for a single rhapsode or for a single day&#x27;s performance. Therefore, they had to be divided into parts, and each rhapsode had to take his assigned part (otherwise they would have chosen favourite or prize passages).

Complementary evidence on oral performance of poetry in classical Greece comes in the form of references to a family, clan, or professional association of &quot;Homeridae&quot; (literally &quot;children of Homer&quot;). These certainly had an existence in the fifth and fourth centuries BC and certainly performed poems attributed to Homer. Pindar seems to count the Homeridae as rhapsodes; other sources do not specifically confirm this categorisation.

<doc id="1214447" wikidata="Q239113" url="?curid=1214447" title="Motutapu Island">
<text>Motutapu Island is a island in the Hauraki Gulf to the northeast of the city of Auckland, New Zealand. The island is part of the Hauraki Gulf Maritime Park. The island can be accessed via regular ferry services departing from Auckland City.

== Etymology ==
Motutapu&#x27;s full name in Māori, rarely used, is , , a tohunga (tribal priest) of the Tainui tribe. , meaning &#x27;sacred&#x27; or &#x27;sanctuary&#x27; island, is a term used for various islands in a number of Polynesian cultures. 

==Geography==

Approximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, Motutapu Island was landlocked to the North Island, surrounded by a vast coastal plain where the Hauraki Gulf exists today. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, after which Motutapu became an island separated from the rest of New Zealand.

The island is now linked by an artificial causeway to the much younger volcanic island cone of Rangitoto. Prior to the emergence of the volcano, the island had been extensively occupied by Māori for over 100 years. The eruption, approximately 700 years ago, destroyed their settlements, but there is circumstantial evidence that some of the residents may have escaped the destruction, presumably by waka (canoe). Of the many archaeological sites recorded, one, the Sunde Site (), shows human and dog footprints preserved in solidified ash. These were protected from erosion by a layer of ash from the next eruption.

Today the island lacks the forest cover of neighbouring Rangitoto Island and most areas are limited to grass and wet meadows. There are few large trees on the island but a reforestation project has been carried out by the Motutapu Restoration Trust. The project has brought back many indigenous flora to various sections of the island.

In March 2013, two shallow earthquakes situated beneath Motutapu Island measuring 3.1 and 3.9 shook the Auckland area. Fears they could be a sign of a looming eruption at nearby Rangitoto Island were allayed by geologists, who said they were caused by fault lines, not volcanic activity.

==History==

Motutapu was one of the earliest places inhabited both by Polynesians, and later by Europeans in the Auckland region. The earliest evidence for occupation of Motutapu dates to before the eruption of Rangitoto, circa 1400 AD. The eruption smothered Motutapu in ash and caused widespread deforestation, but also produced friable soils suitable for gardening. Archaeological deposits bracketing the ash suggest the eruption prompted a shift from broad-spectrum hunting of forest birds to intensive marine exploitation and horticulture. Numerous kumara pits were later found by archeologists. Archaeological surveys of the island undertaken since the 1960s have shown that the island was used as an area to manufacture adze (&quot;toki&quot;) between AD1400 and AD1500, using the greywacke found on the island.

Following the eruption Motutapu is reported to have been visited by both the &quot;Arawa&quot; and &quot;Tainui&quot; canoes and was subsequently settled by the Tainui ancestors of the Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki. The island&#x27;s traditional. Te Motu Tapu a Taikehu (&quot;The Sacred island of Taikehu&quot;), is a reference to a tohunga of the &quot;Tainui&quot; canoe. Ngāi Tai maintained rights of occupation from that time until its eventual sale with only minor incursions from other groups. The Ngāti Huarere of Arawa descent claimed bird snaring rights over the kākā (native parrot) by right of conquest, and from the 18th century reciprocal fishing rights were negotiated with Ngāti Pāoa on Waiheke Island. In the 1820s many of the islands in the Hauraki Gulf, including Motutapu, were evacuated in response to the threat of Hongi Hika and the Ngāpuhi armed with muskets. Many of the Hauraki tribes retreated south, and the Ngāi Tai are said to have taken refuge at Maungatautari. Occasional ventures were made back to former territories in the gulf, sometimes not without consequence, as with when a local fishing party was attacked at Motutapu by Ngapuhi with several casualties. From 1836 many of the evacuated territories were resettled, and the Ngai Tai remained on Motutapu until the northern part of the island was sold to Tom Maxwell in 1840. Since the 1840s, the island has been worked as a pastoral farm, with farming settlements centred around Emu Bay and Home Bay.

Maxwell had lived at Maraetai with the Ngāi Tai and was married to Ngeungeu, the daughter of the principal chief, Tara Te Irirangi. From 1840 to 1845 the northern end was leased out to James Moncur. The southern end was purchased by Williamson and Crummer in 1845, but subsequently granted to politician Robert Graham in 1857, with the island increasingly becoming a trip destination – Home Bay Wharf hosted such attractions as whale boat racing, greased pig chasing and hunting. The Reid brothers purchased the island in 1869–70 and retained ownership until 1943. A series of homesteads and outbuildings have been built at Home Bay, the first between 1840 and 1857, and the present Reid Homestead was built 1901–03. A homestead was built at Emu Bay c. 1869–70, occupied by James Reid and demolished in 1976.

Work began on the Motutapu counter-bombardment battery in 1936. In May 1936 roads to battery had been formed, and the battery and observation post completed by June 1937, guns mounted by end of August 1938, and a temporary camp established at Administration Bay in 1937. War broke out in September 1939 and the military population on the island went from 10 to 200, requiring the construction of additional buildings at Administration Bay and at the observation posts. Plotting rooms were constructed in 1941–42, and searchlights installed at Billy Goat point. The US Navy intended to use Auckland as a staging point into the Pacific and this led to the construction of deepwater wharfing facilities, and the construction of 50 ammunition magazines between 1942 and 1943. The war ended in 1945, and within five years the entire complex had been abandoned.

The Department of Conservation began a long-term restoration programme on the island in 1992, aiming to revegetate the island with native species by the 2040s.

==Landscape==
Geologically, Motutapu comprises Waipapa series greywackes, cherts and argillites, overlaid with Waitemata tertiary sediments, and blanketed in Rangitoto ash. The cultural landscape of archaeological sites includes pre-Rangitoto eruption archaic campsites and adze making sites, 13 pā, numerous open settlements, midden deposits, storage pits, and agricultural areas. There are 372 recorded sites and it is likely that many more subsurface deposits remain unrecorded. Some of the sites will have been damaged or destroyed by farming and military activity.

Sizes of recorded sites vary as might be expected over time with fluctuations in demographics and blurring boundaries of a mobile population. Settlement sites are spread across the whole island, with some apparent clustering on the western leeward side of the island around the mountain and causeway stream catchments, and early archaic settlements at open stream mouths and adjacent spurs. Davidson notes that a clustering around stream mouths and high number of distinct sites might be suggestive of a rotation garden system. Pā sites are present on most of the easily defendable coastal headlands, although the relatively small amount of habitable land enclosed within defensive earthworks compared to area of occupied open settlements leads Davidson to conclude some of the open settlements may have been palisaded without earthwork defences, and that settlement on Motutapu was most likely a “peace-time horticultural based occupation, with periodic episodes of stress leading to fort construction and use”.

Stone sources exploited for tool manufacture were largely the local greywacke found on Motutapu and nearby Motuihe, but included obsidians from Great Barrier and Northland, as well as Nelson argillites and basalts from Tahanga. Other locally sourced rock used in tool production included jaspers for hammerstones and sandstone grinders.

There are three main areas associated with the 19th-century farming, and these include associated remnant plantings. Home Bay retains homestead, plantings, seawall, and graves. Emu Bay has the foundations of four separate groups of buildings, remnant plantings and isolated Norfolk pines on high points of the island. No archaeological remains have yet been located at Station Bay where the remaining farm settlement is known to have been located.

The military structures on Motutapu comprise a largely intact World War II landscape including: the main 6-inch gun emplacement with three gun pits, underground magazines, shelters and stores; the battery observation post, engine and radar rooms; the Emu observation post and engine room for the anti-submarine defences; the ground-level plotting complex with miniature range, plotting and generator rooms; the underground plotting complex with command exchange, radio, plotting generator, battery and fuel rooms, as well as access tunnels and corridors; the search light emplacements and directing station; personnel camps at Administration Bay and the battery; the US Navy magazines north of the causeway and store at Home Bay, and numerous pillboxes to protect the battery from a commando assault. The landscape also includes a number of roads, wharves and quarries.

==Ecological restoration==
The natural vegetation of the island was almost totally gone by the middle of the 19th century, due to the volcanic eruption and subsequent settlement activities and pests introductions by both Māori and Europeans.

===Pest eradication and translocation of native species===
Possums and wallabies were eradicated from the island in the early 1990s. Following three aerial drops of brodifacoum poison baits on Motutapu and Rangitoto in winter 2009, as of January 2010, rodents, rabbits and stoats appeared to have been successfully eradicated. Most cats had been removed, though a few may remain, and hedgehogs were still plentiful. In August 2011 both Rangitoto and Motutapu were declared pest free. Since then a number of native New Zealand species have been translocated to Motutapu including takahē, saddleback and North Island brown kiwi. The work is overseen by the Motutapu Restoration Trust, and is to restore both the natural and the cultural heritage of the island, from restoration of the historic Reid homestead to replanting forests and restoring wetlands.

=== Regenerative agriculture ===
Since the mid-1990s, Motutapu Farms Limited have been adopting regenerative farming practices, also known as &#x27;biological&#x27; in New Zealand (international research refers to the approach as; low-input, ecological, natural or alternative).

&quot;Regenerative “Post-modern agriculture is not anti-science...it is the most modern agriculture because it builds carefully and creatively on advances in scientific knowledge particularly in the disciplines of biology, ecology and microbiology.”&quot;—Norman Uphoff.
(Professor of Government and International Agriculture; Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development; Director of Graduate Studies, Field of International Development.)

Regenerative farming systems are on the rise as producers respond to a range of social, environmental and environmental drivers. In a 2011 UN report, Olivier De Schutter reviewed 286 recent sustainable agriculture projects in 57 countries, covering 37 million hectares. In the report he states that the approach is more resilient to extreme climate-related events, while substantially reducing the use of oil and oil-based pesticides and fertilizers. The review also discovered that adopting soil health methods increased average food production by 150%. This reflects on the ground reports from New Zealand farmers.

<text>Supermodified is the fourth studio album by Brazilian electronic music producer Amon Tobin. It was released on 16 May 2000 by Ninja Tune.

Tobin&#x27;s official website defined the title of the album as:
*&quot;modification: the act of modifying, state of being modified; change made in vowel by mutation, graphic representation of this&quot;
*&quot;super: on the top (of); over; beyond; besides; in addition; exceeding; going beyond; more&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Supermodified&quot; was released by the Ninja Tune label on 16 May 2000 in the United States and on 22 May 2000 in the United Kingdom. Two singles were issued from the album: &quot;Slowly&quot; on 1 May 2000 and &quot;Four Ton Mantis&quot; on 4 September 2000. Music videos were produced for both &quot;Slowly&quot; (directed by Ben Rivers and Jeremy Butler) and &quot;Four Ton Mantis&quot; (directed by Floria Sigismondi).

In 2012, &quot;Supermodified&quot; was awarded a double silver certification by the Independent Music Companies Association, signifying sales of at least 40,000 copies in Europe.

==Critical reception==
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, &quot;Supermodified&quot; received an average score of 85 based on eight reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Taylor M. Clark found it more accessible than Tobin&#x27;s previous albums, as well as more cohesive: &quot;Everything just fits together so well, like Lego blocks making a castle.&quot; John Bush of AllMusic wrote that Tobin had &quot;again made great strides in his production skills, and the range and greatness of this material serves as proof positive.&quot;

==Use in film and television==
* &quot;Natureland&quot;, &quot;Slowly&quot; and &quot;Get Your Snack On&quot; were used in the movie coverage of the 2003 Gumball 3000 Rally.
* &quot;Saboteur&quot; was used in the 2003 remake of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;.
* &quot;Slowly&quot; was used in the 2006 film &quot;Candy&quot;, as well as ES footwear&#x27;s film, &quot;Menikmati&quot;.
* &quot;Four Ton Mantis&quot; was used in a commercial for &quot;Death Note&quot; on Adult Swim, Paul Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Forecast&quot; skateboarding video for Mike Mo Capaldi&#x27;s segment, a Molson M commercial. and a commercial for the Nissan Qashqai
* &quot;Chocolate Lovely&quot; has been used on Adult Swim&#x27;s commercial bumps.

<doc id="1214452" wikidata="Q1150245" url="?curid=1214452" title="Kyushu Institute of Technology">
<text>The is one of the 87 national universities in Japan. Located in Fukuoka Prefecture on the island of Kyushu, it is dedicated to education and research in the fields of science and technology. It is earlier abbreviated to KIT and is now officially abbreviated to Kyutech.

The founder was Matsumoto Kenjiro, second son of Yasukawa Keiichiro, and the links with the Yaskawa Electric Corporation (founded in 1915) remain strong to this day. The centenary of the opening of the Tobata campus is being celebrated in 2009, with Founder&#x27;s Day on May 28, 2009.

One of its famous alumnus is &quot;Mr. Tornado&quot;, the severe storms researcher Tetsuya &quot;Ted&quot; Fujita. He graduated in 1943 and was an associate professor until 1953 when he was invited to the University of Chicago.

==History==
The university was granted government permission to be founded in 1907 as a private training school for engineers called &quot;Meiji Senmon Gakkō&quot; (Meiji Vocational School), toward the end of the Meiji period. The first campus opened its doors in Tobata in 1909, and the centenary of the university is therefore being celebrated in 2009.

KIT became a Japanese national university on May 31, 1949 and has, since April 1, 2004, been incorporated as a National University Corporation under a new law that applies to all national universities.

Despite the incorporation, which has led to increased financial independence and autonomy, KIT is still quite strictly controlled in many respects by the Japanese Ministry of Education (Monbukagakushō, or Monkashō).

In 1995, the Satellite Venture Business Laboratory was opened at Tobata campus.

The first school building of &quot;Meiji Senmon Gakko&quot; was made wholly of wood and designed by Tatsuno Kingo. There is also a 1/50th scale model of the building on display in the university archives on Tobata campus.

==Founding principles==
The first president of KIT, Yamakawa Kenjiro who studied at Yale University declared that the aim of the school was to produce &quot;gentlemen well versed in technological skills&quot; (&quot;gijutsu ni tannō naru shikunshi&quot;). Nowadays the university aims to produce both ladies and gentlemen with these skills, and enjoys a high reputation with employers.

Founder&#x27;s day is May 28. It coincides deliberately with the Battle of Tsushima of May 27 and May 28, 1905, the decisive naval battle in the Russo-Japanese War. Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō once visited KIT, and his visit is commemorated in the school&#x27;s archives, as is that of Okuma Shigenobu.

==Campuses==
KIT has three campuses. Two of these are in Kitakyushu and one is in Iizuka. All three are in Fukuoka Prefecture, Kyushu.

===Tobata campus (Kitakyushu)===
Faculty of Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering. This is the oldest campus, opened in 1909. It was designed by Tatsuno Kingo. It originally had three departments: Mining, Metallurgy, and Mechanical Engineering.

===Iizuka campus===
Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems Engineering. This is the second campus, established in 1986. The first students were admitted in 1987.

===Wakamatsu campus (Kitakyushu)===
Graduate School of Life Science and Systems Engineering. This is the newest campus, established in April 2001.

==International partnerships==
KIT has partnership agreements with several overseas universities, including the University of Surrey (UK), Old Dominion University (USA), and the University of Texas at El Paso (USA).

<text>Master control is the technical hub of a broadcast operation common among most over-the-air television stations and television networks. It is distinct from a production control room (PCR) in television studios where the activities such as switching from camera to camera are coordinated. A transmission control room (TCR) is usually smaller in size and is a scaled down version of centralcasting.

Master control is the final point before a signal is transmitted over-the-air for terrestrial television or cablecast, satellite provider for broadcast, or sent on to a cable television operator. Television master control rooms include banks of video monitors, satellite receivers, videotape machines, video servers, transmission equipment, and, more recently, computer broadcast automation equipment for recording and playback of television programming.

Master control is generally staffed with one or two master control operators around-the-clock to ensure continuous operation. Master control operators are responsible for monitoring the quality and accuracy of the on-air product, ensuring the transmission meets government regulations, troubleshooting equipment malfunctions, and preparing programming for playout. Regulations include both technical ones (such as those against over-modulation and dead air), as well as content ones (such as indecency and station ID).

Many television networks and radio networks or station groups have consolidated facilities and now operate multiple stations from one regional master control or centralcasting center. An example of this centralized broadcast programming system on a large scale is NBC&#x27;s &quot;hub-spoke project&quot; that enables a single &quot;hub&quot; to have control of dozens of stations&#x27; automation systems and to monitor their air signals, thus reducing or eliminating some responsibilities of local employees at their owned-and-operated stations. 

Outside the United States, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) manages four radio networks, two broadcast television networks, and several more cable/satellite radio and television services out of just two master control points (English language services at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto and French language services at Maison Radio-Canada in Montreal). Many other public and private broadcasters in Canada have taken a similar approach.

<text>Penny press newspapers were cheap, tabloid-style newspapers mass-produced in the United States from the 1830s onwards. Mass production of inexpensive newspapers became possible following the shift from hand-crafted to steam-powered printing. Famous for costing one cent () while other newspapers cost around six cents, penny press papers were revolutionary in making the news accessible to middle class citizens for a reasonable price.

== History ==

As the East Coast&#x27;s middle and working classes grew, so did their desire for news. Penny papers emerged as a cheap source of news with coverage of crime, tragedy, adventure, and gossip. The penny papers represented the crudest form of journalism because of the sensational gossip that was reported.

The penny press was most noted for its price – only one cent per paper – while other contemporary newspapers were priced around six cents per issue. The exceptionally low price popularized the newspaper in America and extended the influence of the newspaper media to the poorer classes. The penny press made the news and journalism more important and also caused newspapers to begin to pay more attention to the public they served. Editors realized that the information that interested the upper class did not necessarily interest the penny-paying public. These new newspaper readers enjoyed the information about police and criminal cases. The main revenue for the penny press was advertising while other newspapers relied heavily on high-priced subscriptions to finance their activities.

The idea of a penny paper was not new in the 1830s. By 1826, many editors were experimenting with sports news, gossip, and cheap press.

Most newspapers in the early 19th century cost six cents and were distributed mostly through subscriptions. On July 24, 1830, the first penny press newspaper came to the market: Lynde M. Walter&#x27;s &quot;Transcript&quot; in Boston, Massachusetts. Unlike most later penny papers, Walter&#x27;s &quot;Transcript&quot; maintained what was considered good taste, featuring coverage of literature and the theater. This paper sold for a subscription of four dollars a year.

The penny paper&#x27;s largest inspiration came from Charles Knight&#x27;s &quot;The Penny Magazine&quot; (1832–1845). The main purpose of this magazine was to educate and improve England&#x27;s poor, but it was also very popular with Americans. It became a very successful magazine as it attained a circulation of more than 20,000 copies within a year.

Frederic Hudson, one of the first to write about the history of American journalism, believed the rise of the penny press to be a key factor in the development of the modern newspaper. Hudson considered newspapers to be dull during the 1840s.


Benjamin Henry Day (1810-1889), took the lead in profoundly transforming the daily newspaper in America. The newspaper went from narrowly focusing on the wealthy, with a sparse distribution, to a broad-based news medium. These changes were seen initially mostly in New York City, and spread to nearby Brooklyn, then up and down the East Coast, to Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and other Eastern Seaboard cities. Day introduced &quot;The Sun&quot; in New York, which appealed to a wide audience, using a simpler, more direct style, vivid language, and human interest stories. Day was a New Englander who worked for the Springfield, Massachusetts paper, the &quot;Republican&quot;. He came to New York to be a compositor, but during the Repression of 1833-1834, he started &quot;The Sun&quot; of New York City out of desperation. Day reasoned that a penny paper would be popular in hard times as many could not afford a six-cent paper. He also believed that a substantial, untapped market existed in the immigrant community. His paper was an instant success. Its motto, printed at the top of every page, was &quot;The object of this paper is to lay before the public, at a price within the means of every one, all the news of the day, and at the same time offer an advantageous medium for advertisements.&quot; Day made advances in the writing and reporting news by introducing a new meaning of sensationalism, which was defined as &#x27;reliance on human-interest stories. He placed emphasis on the common person as he or she was reflected in the political, educational, and social life of the day. Day also introduced a new way of selling papers by putting into practice the &quot;London Plan&quot;. This plan included using young newsboys hawking their newspapers on the streets, soon greatly increasing circulation and decreasing costs for printing each copy.

The success of the penny papers was not automatic; selling the new concept of the newspaper to this new wider audience involved some persuasion. Consumers did not want to buy a new newspaper every day, and it was a challenge to convince them of the benefits of doing so. Most newspapers at the time did not have any sort of timeliness, so buying a newspaper daily seemed pointless to readers. But, eventually, people became interested in reading the latest news which the penny papers strove to provide.
James Gordon Bennett&#x27;s (1795-1872) subsequent 1835 founding of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; added another dimension to the new penny press newspapers, now common in journalistic practice. Whereas newspapers had generally relied on documents as sources, Bennett introduced the practices of observation and interviewing to provide stories with more vivid details. The senior Bennett is known for redefining the concept of news, reorganizing the news business, and introducing newspaper competition. Bennett&#x27;s &quot;New York Herald&quot; was financially independent of politicians or political organizations and clubs thanks to a large number of advertisers. Bennett reported mainly local news and instances of corruption and strove for accuracy. He realized that &quot;there was more journalistic money to be made in recording gossip that interested bar-rooms, work-shops, racecourses, and tenement houses, than in consulting the tastes of drawing rooms and libraries.&quot; He is also known for writing a &quot;money page&quot;, which was included in the &quot;Herald&quot;, and also for his coverage of women in the news. His innovations sparked imitators as he spared nothing to get the news first.

Copying the idea of the Northern newspapers, in 1837, Francis Lumsden and George Wilkins Kendall established &quot;The Picayune&quot; further south on the Gulf of Mexico coast in New Orleans. The paper&#x27;s initial price was one &quot;picayune&quot;, a Spanish coin equivalent to 6¼¢ (half a bit, or one-sixteenth of an American dollar of that time). Under Eliza Jane Nicholson, who inherited the struggling Louisiana paper when her husband died in 1876, the &quot;Picayune&quot; introduced innovations such as society reporting (known as the &quot;Society Bee&quot; columns), children&#x27;s pages, and the first women&#x27;s advice column, which was written by Dorothy Dix. Between 1880 and 1890, the paper more than tripled its circulation.

Horace Greeley, (1811-1872), publisher and founder of 1841&#x27;s &quot;The New York Tribune&quot;, also had an extremely successful penny paper. He had been involved with the first penny paper in America several years before with Boston&#x27;s &quot;Morning Post&quot;, which however was a failure. Instead of sensational stories, Greeley relied on rationalism in the &quot;Tribune&quot;. His editorial pages were the heart of his paper and the reason for its large influence. Greeley is also known for using his newspaper as a platform to promote the Whig Party philosophies and principles during its heyday of the 1840s and into the later new Republican Party of the 1850s. 

Quite possibly the most famous penny press paper was started in 1851 by two men: George Jones (1811-1891), and Henry Raymond (1820-1869). This paper was originally named &quot;The New York Daily Times&quot;, but was later shortened to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1857. Originally sold at one cent per paper, it became famous for incorporating journalistic standards that are common today, as well as having very high-quality reporting and writing. The first issue of the &quot;New York Daily Times&quot; addressed the various speculations about its purpose and positions that preceded its release. It stated:

== Political factors ==

Political and demographic changes were also significant. Much of the success of the newspaper in the early United States owed itself to the attitude of the Founding Fathers toward the press. Many of them saw a free press as one of the most essential elements in maintaining the liberty and social equality of citizens. Thomas Jefferson said he considered a free press as even more important than the government itself: &quot;Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate any moment to prefer the latter.&quot; It was because of his attitude that freedom of the press gained mention in the First Amendment to the Constitution, and though early politicians, including Jefferson, occasionally made attempts to rein in the press, newspapers flourished in the new nation

However, the penny press was originally apolitical both in content and in attitude. As Michael Schudson describes in &quot;Discovering the News&quot;, the &quot;Sun&quot; once replaced their congressional news section with this statement: &quot;The proceedings of Congress thus far, would not interest our readers.&quot; The major social-political changes brought on by the development of the penny press were themselves helped by the penny press&#x27; focus on working-class people and their interests. Thus an apolitical attitude was, ironically, a political factor influencing the advancement of the penny press.

The founders of the penny press popularized both low prices for newspapers and newspaper economics based on sales instead of political party backing. Benjamin Day created &quot;The Sun&quot; without any political party backing. This was rare because this was an era where political parties sponsored newspapers. On the other hand, Horace Greeley used his newspaper, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, as a platform for Whig politics.

==Approach to reporting==
In the early 1800s, newspapers were largely for the elite and took two forms – mercantile sheets that were intended for the business community and contained ship schedules, wholesale product prices, advertisements and some stale foreign news, and political newspapers that were controlled by political parties or their editors as a means of sharing their views with elite stakeholders. Journalists reported the party line and editorialized in favor of party positions. The emergence of the penny press greatly influenced communication technologies by covering news outside those of government interests. The first penny paper, the &quot;Sun&quot;, was founded in New York in September 1833. After that time, newspapers became nonpartisan since they were not supported by political parties. Penny papers hired reporters and correspondents to seek out and write the news, while at the same time, started to sound more journalistic than editorial. Reporters were assigned to beats and were involved in the conduct of local interaction. The penny press contributed to changes in newspaper content and structure. New journalism practices resulted in the development of concepts such as news reporting, emphasizing the importance of timeliness, and appealing to wider audiences. These newspapers, though not completely uninfluenced by political parties and their views, were self-funded and not party-funded. This allowed them to shift allegiance on political issues that the papers dealt with quite easily, which also aided in their success and acceptance by the general public.

Since these newspapers were not politically funded, the core interests of the journalists themselves were obviously quite different from competing newspaper agencies that had heavy political influence. The largest portion of demand was from immigrants, traditional middle-class citizens, and nascent literate classes; journalists kept articles concise and engaging with real-life topics readers could relate to, and did so with less sophisticated vocabulary so readers would not require higher education to understand the articles. The penny press formula is the combination of sensational news with mass market appeal, large-scale industrial production, and economies of scale used in combination with neutrality and objectivity to create a paper that gets its point across without taking sides. Also, journalist-incorporated advertisements treated readers as consumers instead of another market for demand, in an effort to establish a relationship between paper and reader that was less about work and the economy and more about relaxation and reading for pleasure and relaxation.

The penny press newspapers became more widely read because journalists made the effort to keep their content understandable to less educated audiences. They also focused on investigating topics with more factual-based information rather than opinion-based articles, which gave the paper a less biased form of news than the elite newspapers, which were often published by those with special interests. News items and stories were also shorter than those found in elite papers. It was also believed that the working-class audiences would not have enough free time to read longer editorials, hence the shorter and more concise editorials. Human interest stories were also popular with the penny press audiences. Such items took up more space compared to earlier, more expensive papers that used human interest stories more as filler content. The New York penny papers were particularly known for publishing stories about interesting personalities and covering different aspects of the human condition. To connect with the urban, mostly working-class readership, New York reporters wrote about ordinary people and their experiences. They also wrote about the stock market, entertainers, politics, sports, and weather, all of which became important news and are still considered absolute necessities in a newspaper, thanks to the penny press. Reporters strove to deliver news in a timely manner and sometimes relied on the electric telegraph to gather and share information. Penny press journalists were the first people to report on crises and crime news, something that has become a staple in newspapers since. Continuing reports on the same story were introduced in penny press papers and were read by thousands of people on the same day. This, in combination with the speed of news delivery and thoroughness in the coverage of local news, forever changed the direction of American journalism.

<doc id="1214460" wikidata="Q419938" url="?curid=1214460" title="Cephalohematoma">
<text>A cephalohematoma (American English), also spelled cephalohaematoma (British English), is a hemorrhage of blood between the skull and the periosteum at any age, including a newborn baby secondary to rupture of blood vessels crossing the periosteum. Because the swelling is subperiosteal, its boundaries are limited by the individual bones, in contrast to a caput succedaneum.

== Symptoms and signs ==
Swelling appears 2-3 days after birth. If severe the child may develop jaundice, anemia or hypotension. In some cases it may be an indication of a linear skull fracture or be at risk of an infection leading to osteomyelitis or meningitis. The swelling of a cephalohematoma takes weeks to resolve as the blood clot is slowly absorbed from the periphery towards the centre. In time the swelling hardens (calcification) leaving a relatively softer centre so that it appears as a &#x27;depressed fracture&#x27;. Cephalohematoma should be distinguished from another scalp bleeding called subgaleal hemorrhage (also called subaponeurotic hemorrhage), which is blood between the scalp and skull bone (above the periosteum) and is more extensive. It is more prone to complications, especially anemia and bruising.

== Causes ==
The usual causes of a cephalohematoma are a prolonged second stage of labor or instrumental delivery, including ventouse (vacuum) or forceps delivery. Vitamin C deficiency has been reported to possibly be associated with development of cephalhematomas.

== Management ==
Skull x-ray or CT scanning is used if neurological symptoms appear. These measurements are also used if concomitant depressed skull fracture is a possibility. Usual management is mainly observation. Phototherapy may be necessary if blood accumulation is significant leading to jaundice. Rarely, anaemia can develop needing blood transfusion. The presence of a bleeding disorder should be considered but is rare. 

Cephalohematomas typically resolve spontaneously within weeks or months of birth, however calcification can occur in 3-5% of cases. While aspiration to remove accumulated blood and prevent calcification has generally been recommended against due to risk of infection, modern surgical standards and antibiotics may make this concern unfounded, and needle aspiration can be considered a safe intervention for significantly-sized cephalohematomas that do not resolve spontaneously after one month.

<text>The Ponui or Ponui Island Donkey is a breed and feral population of domestic donkey from Ponui Island, in the Hauraki Gulf off New Zealand. It is the only feral donkey in New Zealand. It may also be called the New Zealand Donkey.

== History ==

Frederick Chamberlin bought Ponui Island from the New Zealand government in 1854. Donkeys were brought to the island together with other livestock from New South Wales, and a feral population established itself. The Ponui Island Donkey now has formal breed status, and some are distributed in mainland New Zealand. It is registered by the Donkey &amp; Mule Society of New Zealand. The Ponui is listed as &#x27;rare&#x27; by the Rare Breeds Conservation Society of New Zealand; it is not among the New Zealand livestock breeds reported to the DAD-IS database of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

== Characteristics ==

The Ponui donkey is docile and sturdy. It stands about at the withers. It is usually light dun in colour, but may be chocolate; broken-coloured donkeys cannot be registered.

<text>John Alan Hopkins (16 December 1936 – 19 September 2018) was an English legal academic known for developing Downing College&#x27;s reputation for law. He was a Fellow of Downing College, Cambridge and an Honorary Fellow of Hughes Hall, Cambridge.

==Early education and career==

John Hopkins was born at Hemsworth (Yorkshire) and relocated to Pontypridd when he was 12. He attended Pontypridd Boys&#x27; Grammar School and then read law at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. He was awarded his B.A. in 1960, and his LLB the following year, accompanied by the Whewell Scholarship in International Law. He was elected to a fellowship at Downing College in October 1961. He was called to the Bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1964. Thereafter, he held many positions in college, including Tutor, Senior Tutor and Director of Studies in Law, retiring in 2004. He became, in addition, a visiting professor at City University, London in 1980. In 1981, he was elected Honorary Bencher of Middle Temple, London. He was a governor of Harrow School, Sherborne School, Eastbourne College and Wellington College.

In his capacity as Director of Studies in Law at Downing for over 40 years, and also as a University Lecturer, John Hopkins taught Constitutional, Equity and International law. Following his time at Downing, he was appointed Director of Studies in Law at Hughes Hall, Cambridge.

He had a characteristic style of supervision, delivered with pipe in hand, smoking matches, as the pipe never seemed to light, and banging the pipe on the bottom of his shoe, which has had a widespread influence on generations of lawyers who read law at Cambridge. He taught John Cleese Equity law and suggested that Cleese developed his Ministry of Silly Walks gait in avoiding the puddles in Downing College&#x27;s court.

The following describes his supervisions perfectly:
The memorable use of &quot;the pipe&quot;. John talks. The pipe empty of tobacco, filled from the tin, the waving of the large box of matches, the extraction of the match, the shutting of the box, the box put aside, the pointing with the pipe, the taking up of the box, the striking of the match, the box put aside the lift of pipe and match to the face, the draw – and again and again without result, the extinction of the match with one flick of the wrist, the pipe unlit and so to the repeat – to box, to match, to pipe and on. and with each movement an emphasis, a comment, a question, a pause for reply and a demand for response. All kindly done with twinkle in the eye for such clever of dumb intellects as had presented themselves to his room to be taught. And taught to good effect.

==Awards and honours==
He was a Master Bencher of Middle Temple, and was a Honorary Bencher since 1982. In 2012, John Hopkins was conferred Honorary Fellowship of Hughes Hall, Cambridge after serving for 8 years as the College&#x27;s Director of Studies in Law.

==Personal life==
John Hopkins was a keen member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and a stalwart of The Athenaeum.

His marriage to Charity A. &quot;Cherry&quot; Busbridge took place in Abingdon, Oxfordshire in 1964, while she was still a post-graduate research student: it was followed by the births of their two children in 1971 and 1974. Cherry Hopkins is a life fellow and former Director of Studies in law at Girton College, Cambridge.

<doc id="1214477" wikidata="Q2391146" url="?curid=1214477" title="Tāmaki River">
<text>The Tāmaki River or Tāmaki Estuary is mostly an estuarial arm and harbour of the Hauraki Gulf, within the city of Auckland in New Zealand. It extends south for from its mouth between the suburb of Saint Heliers and the long thin peninsula of Bucklands Beach, which reaches its end at Musick Point. The inlet extends past the suburbs of Glendowie, Wai o Taiki Bay, Point England, Glen Innes, Tāmaki, Panmure, and Ōtāhuhu to the west, and Bucklands Beach, Half Moon Bay, Farm Cove, Sunnyhills and Pakuranga to the east.

==Etymology==

It was originally called Te Wai o Taiki, meaning &quot;The Waters of Taiki&quot;. The name Taiki is a shortened form of Taikehu, the name of an ancestor of Ngāi Tai.

== Geography ==

The estuarine Tāmaki River is a harbour in the Auckland Region, with four arms: the Ōtāhuhu Creek, Middlemore Creek, Pakuranga Creek and the Ōtara Creek. In addition to these, the Panmure Basin is a tidal basin found in a volcanic crater on the western shores of the river.

The Ōtāhuhu Creek forms the eastern shore of the narrowest point on the Auckland isthmus: here it is about 1.25 kilometres (0.75 mi) to the waters of the Manukau Harbour, an arm of the Tasman Sea.

== History ==
The Tāmaki River is the location of three portages which connected the east and west coasts of New Zealand: Te Tō Waka at Ōtāhuhu, the shortest portage between the two coasts, Karetu to the north at Southdown/Sylvia Park, and the Waokauri / Pūkaki portage, to the south between Middlemore and Papatoetoe. Here, Māori would beach their waka (canoes) and drag them overland to the other coast, thus avoiding having to paddle around North Cape. The portages made the area of immense strategic importance in both pre-European times and during the early years of European occupation.Portage Road, Ōtāhuhu is the approximate historical location of Te Tō Waka. Karetu and went between the extreme north-east corner of the Manukau Harbour to a bay close to the site of the newest bridge across the Tāmaki, about south of the Panmure Basin.

The river was part of the first steam ferry route in Auckland, the PS &quot;Governor Wynyard&quot; connecting Auckland to Ōtāhuhu, which began service in 1851. By the next year, the ferry was sold to Melbourne as it was unprofitable. By the late 1850s, the Tāmaki River was one of the busiest waterways in New Zealand. The east bank at Pakuranga was the main point where cattle were transported towards the city of Auckland.

In 1865, the estuary was first crossed by the Panmure Bridge, a steel swing bridge, to improve connection between Auckland and Howick. The location is to the left of the left hand (Panmure) bridge shown in the photo. The circular base swivel was only removed in the 1980s from the southern shore. Stones and steel had been imported from Australia, possibly reflecting the still very basic nature of industrial construction in the young colony.

In the 1860s and 70s, the Tāmaki River was one of the busiest waterways in New Zealand, due to the transportation of agricultural goods such as wheat between Ōtāhuhu and the city of Auckland. The popularity of alternative transportation such as roads and rail (including the extension of the Southern Line to Ōtāhuhu in 1875) led to a decline of the use of the Tāmaki River, and by 1910 very few vessels used Ōtāhuhu as a port or even ventured upstream of the Panmure Bridge. In the 1890s the mouth of the river was used as a safe anchorage for ships carrying explosives. One such ship, anchored in the mouth of the estuary, caught fire and exploded with loss of life. After this the explosives buoy was moved into a more open area east of Browns Island (Motukōrea), where it is still located.

In 1925 a leopard that had escaped from the Auckland Zoo three weeks earlier was found dead in the Tāmaki river by a fishing party in Karaka Bay.

== Transport ==
Due to its extent north–south and its position between the Auckland isthmus and East Auckland, the river is a natural barrier to traffic, especially as only three bridges cross it, all heavily trafficked and increasingly incapable of taking the peak hour flows. The Eastern Busway is a project that is designed to resolve this bottle-neck as one of its goals.

The Tāmaki River also has a marina / ferry wharf at Half Moon Bay, from where commuter ferries depart for the Auckland CBD and car/passenger ferries for Waiheke Island. Many yachts are also moored in its relatively well protected interiors. The river channel is marked with large green buoys. Deep draught vessels should stay close to the buoys as the channel, although averaging deep is very narrow in many places. Near the large Point England sand spit there are numerous mudflats which are barely covered at high tide. The speed limit in the river is . Rocks at the western mouth of the river at St Heliers are marked by a distinctive barber&#x27;s pole. Vessels of more than draught should not attempt the opening between Musick Point and Browns Island. The channel in this area is marked by port and starboard markers about apart. It is northwest of Musick Point. Large mussel beds extend out from Browns Island into the river.

<text>Freedom (often referred to as the Freedom app) is a computer program designed to keep a computer or smartphone user away from the Internet for up to eight hours at a time. It is described as a way to &quot;free you from distractions, allowing you time to write, analyze, code, or create.&quot; The program was written by Fred Stutzman, a Ph.D student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Since its initial release, Freedom has expanded its features and platform availability:

* Cross-Platform Support: Freedom is available on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS, allowing users to synchronize their block sessions across all devices.

Recent Updates: As of December 2024, the iOS version (6.36) addressed issues with the End Session timer related to time zone changes and included several bug fixes to enhance app performance.

The Windows version (2.29), updated in October 2024, removed session countdowns for trial users and made other improvements.

<text>Eileen Jackson Southern (February 19, 1920 – October 13, 2002) was an American musicologist, researcher, author, and teacher. Southern&#x27;s research focused on black American musical styles, musicians, and composers; she also published on early music.

==Early life==
Eileen Jackson grew up around many musicians in her family; her father was a violinist; an uncle, a trumpetist; and her mother, a choir singer. According to music scholar Samuel A. Floyd, Jr., &quot;In childhood, as she developed as a pianist, young Eileen was introduced to and became partial to the music of those she calls the &#x27;piano composers,&#x27; including Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Claude Debussy. In addition, her piano teachers, mostly white, were concerned that she wouldn&#x27;t know music by black composers and introduced her to R. Nathaniel Dett&#x27;s &quot;In the Bottoms&quot;, among other such compositions.&quot;

Jackson attended public schools in her hometown, Minneapolis, Minnesota, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and in Chicago, Illinois. She majored in commercial art at Lindblom High School in Chicago. During the same period, she won piano-performance and essay competitions, taught piano lessons, and directed musical activities at the Lincoln Community Center. She gave her first piano recital at the age of twelve and made her debut in Chicago Orchestra Hall at age eighteen, playing a Mozart concerto with the symphony orchestra of the Chicago Musical College.

She attended and received degrees from the University of Chicago (B.A., 1940, and M. A., 1941). Her relationship with Cecil Smith, her master thesis advisor, encouraged her to further develop her interest in Negro folk music. In 1942, she married Joseph Southern, a professor of business administration.

She continued her studies and received a PhD in musicology from New York University, 1961. Her doctoral dissertation, &quot;The Buxheim Organ Book,&quot; was supervised by Gustave Reese. At NYU, in addition to Gustave Reese, she also studied with Curt Sachs and Martin Bernstein. She also studied piano privately at Chicago Musical College, Juilliard, and Boston University.

==Career==
Throughout her career, Southern taught at various institutions across the United States. From 1941 to 1942, she was an instructor at Prairie View University in Texas. From 1943 to 1945 and 1949 to 1951, she was an assistant professor at Southern University in Louisiana. From 1954 to 1960, she worked as a teacher for the New York City Public School district. She returned to higher education from 1960 to 1968 as an assistant professor at Brooklyn College, CUNY, and then as an associate and full professor at York College, CUNY, from 1968 to 1975, where she established the music program.

In 1974, she became a lecturer at Harvard University. Two years later, she became the first black woman to be appointed a tenured full professor at Harvard University, where she taught until 1987. While at Harvard, she served as the chair of the department of Afro-American Studies from 1975 to 1979.

Her best-known book is the seminal history &quot;The Music of Black Americans&quot; (1971). Her other work is &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Afro-American and African Musicians&quot; (1982). She founded &quot;The Black Perspective in Music&quot; in 1973, with her husband, Prof. Joseph Southern. It was the first musicological journal on the study of black music, and she was its editor until it ceased publication in 1990.

Through her academic work, she raised the profile of Frank Johnson, a black bandleader from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who rose to fame at the end of the eighteenth century, beginning of the nineteenth century. He led Frank Johnson&#x27;s Colored Band, and by 1818, he had taken his band as far south as Richmond, Virginia, playing dances for white southerners. Johnson had played a command performance at Buckingham Palace, where he received a silver bugle in appreciation.

Throughout her career, Southern worked with various professional societies. From 1974 to 1976, she served on the board of directors and then editorial board from 1976 to 1978 for the American Musicological Society. She was a member of the International Musicological Society, College Music Society, and Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. From 1980 to her retirement, she served on the editorial board for the Sonneck Society for American Music and as a member of the Board of Directors from 1986 to 1988.

In 1987, she retired as a professor emeritus to live in St. Albans, New York.

==Awards==
Southern&#x27;s professional achievements were much lauded in the academic and artistic communities. Southern received a National Humanities Medal in 2001 for having &quot;helped transform the study and understanding of American music.&quot; She also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for American Music in 2000. Her portrait, by artist Stephen E. Coit was commissioned by the Harvard Foundation at Harvard University.

==Personal life==
On August 22, 1942 Eileen Jackson married Joseph Southern, a co-founder of the journal the &quot;Black Perspective in Music&quot;. They had a daughter, April, and a son, Edward.

<doc id="1214494" wikidata="Q16960600" url="?curid=1214494" title="Liberals for Forests">
<text>Liberals for Forests (LFF) was an Australian political party. It contested both state and federal elections between 2001 and 2008, but only ever achieved one elected representative – Janet Woollard in Western Australia. It never achieved representation at the federal level.

The party was founded in 1999 by Dr Keith Woollard, husband of Janet Woollard and an ex-AMA president. Janet successfully contested a seat at the 2001 state election, and was re-elected in 2005 and again in 2008 as an Independent Liberal.

The party generally professed itself to be ideologically aligned with the centre-right sympathies of the Liberal Party, but was aligned with Labor in certain states such as NSW but with a greater regard to environmentalism.

Despite its low profile, the party gained a respectable proportion of the primary senate vote in some states. For example, in the 2004 election it received only a few hundred votes less than the Australian Democrats in Victoria.

==Name==
The registered party name at the Australian Electoral Commission and the Western Australian Electoral Commission was &quot;liberals for forests&quot; (uncapitalised), but it was known in newspapers as &quot;Liberals for Forests&quot;. By late 2009, Liberals for Forests was no longer a registered political party anywhere in Australia.

==See also==
* Small-l liberal – a term used by LFF candidates to describe themselves in order to attract the support of mildly disenchanted coalition voters
* Teal independents – a loosely-aligned group of independent and minor party politicians characterised as strongly advocating for increased action to mitigate climate change.

<doc id="1214505" wikidata="Q1133467" url="?curid=1214505" title="Geographical midpoint of Europe">
<text>The location of the geographical centre of Europe depends on the definition of the borders of Europe, mainly whether remote islands are included to define the extreme points of Europe, and on the method of calculating the final result. Thus, several places claim to host this hypothetical centre.

== Current claimants ==
* The village of Kremnické Bane or the neighbouring village Krahule, near Kremnica, in central Slovakia

Other locations currently vying for the distinction of being the centre of Europe include:
* The small town of Rakhiv, or the village of Dilove near Rakhiv, in western Ukraine
* The village of Girija, near Vilnius, in Lithuania
* A point on the island of Saaremaa in Estonia
* A point near Polotsk, or in Vitebsk, or near Babruysk, or near lake Sho in Belarus
* A point near the town of Tállya, in north-eastern Hungary
* The small historic town of Kouřim in Czech Republic

== Extreme points of Europe ==
The picture above shows the extreme points of Europe, northern or southern. The northern, which are Ostrov Rudolfa or Rudolf Island, a Russian island, Kinnarodden, a tourist attraction in Norway, and Mys Zhelaniya or Cape Zhelaniya, the northernmost point of Severny Island, Russia. The extreme southern parts of Europe are Cabo da Roca, A historical place in Portugal, Punta de Tarifa, the southernmost point on the Spanish mainland, and Gavdos, an island in Greece under the administrative region of Crete.

== History of claims ==
=== Poland ===

The first official declaration of the Centre of Europe was made in 1775 by the Polish royal astronomer and cartographer Szymon Antoni Sobiekrajski, who calculated it to be in the town of Suchowola near Białystok in modern north-eastern Poland. The method used was that of calculating equal distances from the extreme points of Europe: the westernmost point in Portugal; the easternmost point in the Central Urals; the northernmost point in Norway; and the southernmost point in Greece (islands were not taken into consideration). There is a monument commemorating that definition in Suchowola .

==== Slovakia ====

In about 1815 there was a declaration that the centre of Europe was located near the mining town of Kremnica, on a hill that forms the water division between the basins of the Baltic Sea and Black Sea, near St. John Baptist Church. The method used for calculating is unknown, but from the description given on the commemorative plaque located near the church , it seems that it has been the centre of the smallest circle circumscribed on Europe (yet the limits of Europe taken into consideration are not known). The title of the &quot;Centre of Europe&quot; is also claimed by the neighbouring village Krahule (ancient Blaufuß), which used to belong to the same parish, now a famous centre for winter sports, with a hotel and recreation centre called &quot;Stred Európy&quot; (&quot;Centre of Europe&quot;).
==== Transcarpathia, Ukraine ====

In 1887, geographers from the Austro-Hungarian Empire set up a historical marker and a large stone in what is today a part of Ukraine, believed to mark the geographic centre of Europe. The interpretation of the worn Latin inscription on the monument is debated, with some claiming that the marker is merely one of a number of fixed triangulation points for surveying purposes established around the territory of the former empire. The external borders of Europe taken into account during the calculations are not known. According to the description, the methodology used for the calculation is that of the geometrical middle point of the extreme latitudes and longitudes of Europe, so the stone was located at . However, the actual location of the monument seems rather and not the coordinates to which they relate. This is near the village of Dilove located on the Tisza river, close to the Romanian border, in the county of Rakhiv in the Transcarpathian region.

===== Soviet measurements =====
Measurements done after World War II by Soviet scientists reconfirmed the Austria-Hungarian claim that Rakhiv and Dilove to be the geographical centre of Europe. The old marker in the small town was renewed, and a major campaign to convince everyone of its validity was undertaken.

==== Tillenberg/Dyleň, today in the Czech Republic/Bavaria ====

Austrian geographers also marked the 939-metre-high Tillenberg (Dyleň) near the Bohemian city of Eger/Cheb with a copper plate as the centre of Europe. As the border to Germany/Bavaria runs 100 m west of the mountaintop, the German village of Bad Neualbenreuth uses this for promotional purposes. Bayerischer Rundfunk journalists asked the Institut für Geographie of the University of Munich to verify the claims. The institute concluded that the centre lies further to the south, in Hildweinsreuth near Flossenbürg.

=== Sweden ===
In 1988 using Spherical trigonometry with the three corners of Europe as Cabo de São Vincente in the west, Spitsbergen in the north and Astrakan in the east, Arne Wennberg calculated Landskrona as the midpoint of Europe. A monument is built on the town square in the form of a pen stuck in stone. 

=== Lithuania ===
After a re-estimation of the boundaries of the continent of Europe in 1989, Jean-George Affholder, a scientist at the Institut Géographique National (French National Geographic Institute) determined that the geographic centre of Europe is located at . The method used for calculating this point was that of the centre of gravity of the geometrical figure of Europe.
This point is located in Lithuania, near the village of Girija. A monument, composed by the sculptor Gediminas Jokūbonis and consisting of a column of white granite surmounted by a crown of stars, was erected at the location in 2004. An area of woods and fields surrounding the geographic centre point and including Lake Girija, Bernotai Hill, and an old burial ground, was set aside as a reserve in 1992. The State Tourism Department at the Ministry of Economy of Lithuania has classified the Geographic Centre monument and its reserve as a tourist attraction. 17 km away lies Europos Parkas, &quot;Open Air Museum of the Centre of Europe&quot;, a sculpture park containing the world&#x27;s largest sculpture made of TV sets.

It is the only Geographical Centre of Europe with recognition in the Guinness Book of World Records.

=== Hungary ===

It is claimed that a 1992 survey found that the geometric centre of Europe is in the village of Tállya, Hungary . In 2000, a sculpture was erected in the village, with a table on it declaring the place the &quot;Geometric Centre of Europe&quot;.

=== Belarus ===

In 2000 Belarusian scientists Alexey Solomonov and Valery Anoshko published a report that stated the geographic centre of Europe was located near Lake Sho (; ) in Vitebsk Region.

The scientists used a special computer program that takes Europe in a single entity – the White Sea and the Baltic Sea, Britain and Ireland were included in the program as continental zone objects. It is assumed that in the calculations to determine the center of Europe, one must take into account the inland waters of Europe and the Ural Mountains, the eastern border of Europe.

Scientists from the Russian Central Research Institute of Geodesy, Aerial Survey and Cartography () confirmed the calculations of Belarusian geodesists that the geographical centre of Europe is located in Polotsk . A small monument to the Geographical Centre of Europe was set up in Polotsk on 31 May 2008.

=== Estonia ===

It is claimed that if all the islands of Europe – from the Azores to Franz Joseph Land and from Crete to Iceland – are taken into consideration then the centre of Europe lies at in the village of Mõnnuste, on Saaremaa island in western Estonia. Again, no author and no method of calculation have been disclosed. The local Kärla Parish is seeking to verify the location and to turn it into a tourist location.

== Geographic centre of the European Union ==
The French Institut Géographique National (IGN) has been calculating the changing location of what it estimates to be the geographical centre of the European Union (EU) since at least 1987. Its calculations exclude such extra-European territories of the EU as French Polynesia. As the European Union (or formerly – European Community) has grown in the last 50 years, the geographical centre has shifted with each expansion.

=== 1987–1990 ===

12 members: In 1987 the centre of the European Community of the 12 members was declared to be in the middle of France, in the village of Saint-André-le-Coq, département of Puy-de-Dôme, région of Auvergne.
=== 1990–1995 ===

12 members after the reunification of Germany. In 1990, the centre shifted some 25 km north-eastward, to the place called Noireterre in the village of Saint-Clément, département of Allier, the same région of Auvergne. A small monument commemorating the latter discovery still exists in Saint Clément.
=== 1995–2004 ===

15 members: Using the same techniques, the IGN has identified the geographic centre of the 15-member Union (1995–2004) to be in Viroinval, Belgium, at coordinates , and a monument there records that finding.
=== 2004–2007 ===

25 members: The 25-member Union (2004–2007), had a centre calculated by the IGN to be situated at , in the village of Kleinmaischeid, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.
=== 2007–2013 ===

27 members: On 1 January 2007, with the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the European Union, the geographic centre of the European Union changed to a wheat field outside of the German town Gelnhausen, in the state of Hesse, 115 km east of the previous marker, at .
=== 2013–2020 ===

28 members: On 1 July 2013, with the accession of Croatia, the geographic centre entered North-West Bavaria in the place Westerngrund at the river Schulzengrundbach at . When the French overseas department Mayotte (Indian Ocean island group between Southeast African mainland and Madagascar) joined the EU on 10 May 2014 (as part of France), the geographic center shifted by 500 m to , still at Westerngrund, beside a path. It is 40 km east of Frankfurt, Germany, which is headquarters to the European Central Bank.
=== 2020–present ===
27 members after Brexit: On 31 January 2020, with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, the geographical mid-point moved to Gadheim near Würzburg, Bavaria, at .

=== Other calculations ===

The geographical midpoint of the European Union is not free from disputes either. If some different extreme points of the European Union, like some Atlantic Ocean islands, are taken into consideration this point is calculated in different locations.

=== Eurozone ===
The original centre of the Eurozone is located in France. This location has changed with the accession of new countries into the Eurozone (e.g. Slovakia 2009).

<doc id="1214507" wikidata="Q894245" url="?curid=1214507" title="Eleutherococcus senticosus">
<text>Eleutherococcus senticosus is a species of small, woody shrub in the family Araliaceae native to Northeastern Asia. It may be colloquially called devil&#x27;s bush, Siberian ginseng, taiga root, eleuthero, &quot;ciwujia&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s shrub&quot;, &quot;shigoka&quot;, &quot;touch-me-not&quot;, &quot;wild pepper&quot;, or &quot;kan jang&quot;. &quot;E. senticosus&quot; has a history of use in folklore and traditional Chinese medicine. Root extracts of &quot;E. senticosus&quot; are sold as a dietary supplement or cosmetic, usually under the name &quot;Siberian ginseng&quot;.

==Etymology==
The scientific name (genus), &quot;Eleutherococcus&quot; (from Greek) means &quot;free-berried,&quot; and &quot;senticosus&quot;, (from Latin) means &quot;sentis&quot; (thorn-bush, briar), an adjective meaning &quot;thorny&quot; or &quot;full of briers or thorns.&quot; It is not the same plant as American ginseng (&quot;Panax quinquefolius&quot;) or Asian ginseng (&quot;Panax ginseng&quot;). It has a diversity of common names across its range of distribution.

==Distribution and habitat==
The herb grows in mixed and coniferous mountain forests, forming low undergrowth or is found in groups in thickets and edges. &quot;Eleutherococcus senticosus&quot; is sometimes found in oak groves at the foot of cliffs, rarely in high forest riparian woodland. Its native habitat is East Asia, China, Japan, and Russia. &quot;E. senticosus&quot; is broadly tolerant of soils, growing in sandy, loamy, and heavy clay soils with acid, neutral, or alkaline chemistry and including soils of low nutritional value. It can tolerate sun or dappled shade and some degree of pollution. &quot;E. senticosus&quot; is a deciduous shrub growing to at a slow rate. It is hardy to zone 3. It flowers in July in most habitats. The flowers are hermaphroditic and are pollinated by insects.

==Extract and chemical constituents==
Roots of &quot;E. senticosus&quot; are cylindrical, up to in diameter, straight or branched, dark brown, and have a smooth surface with bark fixed closely to the xylem. The derived extract from the roots has been characterized for its major constituents, including lignans, sesamin (eleutheroside B4), syringaresinol, phenylpropanes, coumarins, beta-sitosterol and daucosterol.

Berries from &quot;E. senticosus&quot; contain diverse polyphenols, including caffeic acid, vanillic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and benzoic acid, with significant content of calcium, magnesium, and potassium.

Major constituents of essential oil from leaves of &quot;Eleutherococcus senticosus&quot; include α-bisabolol (26%), β-caryophyllene (7%), germacrene D (7%), β-bisabolene (5%), and α-humulene (4%).

==Traditional medicine==

Extracts from the root of &quot;Eleutherococcus senticosus&quot;, including eleutherosides, are promoted in alternative and traditional medicine for providing health effects, which are supported by clinical evidence. According to the WHO, only use &quot;as a prophylactic and restorative tonic for enhancement of mental and physical capacities in cases of weakness, exhaustion and tiredness, and during convalescence&quot; is backed up by clinical evidence. The plant has been assessed in preliminary research for its potential use as an antimicrobial or antistress agent.

===Potential for adverse effects===
People with high blood pressure, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, heart disease, mental illness, a compromised immune system, people in the processes of pregnancy and lactation, and people taking digoxin or hexobarbital may have adverse reactions to &quot;E. senticosus&quot;. High doses may cause irritability, confusion, insomnia, or anxiety.

<text>Notre Dame of Maryland University is a private Catholic university in Baltimore, Maryland. NDMU offers certificate, undergraduate, and graduate programs for women and men.

==History==
The Roman Catholic academic/educational religious congregation of the School Sisters of Notre Dame founded the school in 1873. It originally established and named the Notre Dame of Maryland Preparatory School and Collegiate Institute.

Originally founded as a preparatory school (today&#x27;s equivalent of elementary, middle, and high schools), the College of Notre Dame of Maryland was raised to the level of a four-year college for undergraduates in 1895. The lower preparatory school (high school in modern terminology) moved from CND&#x27;s North Charles Street location to its current campus further north in suburban Baltimore County at the county seat of Towson in 1960, and is now known as Notre Dame Preparatory School.

In 1896, the Collegiate Institute became the first four-year Roman Catholic college for women in the United States.

In 2011, the College of Notre Dame of Maryland attained university status with the addition of several graduate-level programs and changed its name to Notre Dame of Maryland University with the approval of the state legislature, the General Assembly of Maryland, accrediting agencies, and the Catholic Church in the state. Previously a women&#x27;s college, the board of trustees voted unanimously to become co-educational in September 2022 and admitted its first undergraduate men in the fall semester of 2023. Many students and alumnae did not want the university to include people of all gender identities and protested the board&#x27;s decision.

In October 2023, the university announced that it will be acquiring the Maryland University of Integrative Health (MUIH) in Laurel, Maryland. The programs from MUIH were anticipated to become part of a new School of Integrative Health by the end of 2024. In December 2024, the parties announced that they &quot;continue to make progress during the transition period ... before final approval of a merger of MUIH into NDMU by the U.S. Department of Education (USDE). During the transition period, NDMU owns and continues to operate MUIH as a separately authorized and separately accredited postsecondary institution&quot;.

==Campus==
Notre Dame of Maryland&#x27;s campus is located on North Charles Street, the main commercial/business and cultural street leading north to the formerly rural, now suburban Baltimore County from downtown Baltimore. NDMU is situated between the wealthy residential neighborhoods from the early 20th Century of Homeland and Guilford, just north of the cross-town, Cold Spring Lane, and adjacent to the campus of Loyola University Maryland (formerly Loyola College) to the south (occupied since 1922). It borders to the south, Evergreen Museum &amp; Library, the historic landmark Greek Revival styled mansion of the Garrett family.

Adjacent to the Montrose House (1850) on the original property site purchased by the School Sisters of Notre Dame, one of the first buildings, &quot;Gibbons Hall,&quot; was constructed in an &quot;L-shaped&quot; structure. It surmounted by its landmark white wooden tower, and opened in 1873 and became the landmark site symbolizing &quot;Notre Dame of Maryland,&quot; which offered instruction to girls and young women. Gibbons Hall was named for the then incumbent Archbishop of Baltimore and second American Cardinal of the Church, James Gibbons.

The university&#x27;s Marikle Chapel of the Annunciation was originally designed by notable architects Ephraim Francis Baldwin and Josias Pennington. It was restored in 2002. Fourier Hall is an example of Art Moderne architecture. The renamed &quot;Noyes Alumnae House&quot;, which was the former &quot;Montrose&quot; estate of a red brick Greek Revival style of architecture was built in 1850, on the southwest corner of the campus. Several buildings on the campus were designed by architect George Archer

The university shares a library with the neighboring Loyola University Maryland. The Loyola/Notre Dame Library was built primarily in a valley on land primarily owned by Notre Dame of Maryland and located between the two Roman Catholic campuses, with a road access to the east to York Road (Maryland Route 45) and the Govans community.

Some courses from the College of Adult Undergraduate Studies and College of Graduate Studies are offered at off-site locations, including: Anne Arundel Community College, College of Southern Maryland, Northeast Maryland Higher Education Center, Laurel College Center, and Southern Maryland Higher Education Center.

==Academics==
In 2014, Notre Dame had 1,254 undergraduate students and 1,647 graduate students, 140 of whom were enrolled in the School of Pharmacy. The university offered 29 undergraduate majors along with interdisciplinary minors, certificates and five-year Bachelor of Arts(BA)/Master of Arts and BA/Master of Arts in Teaching programs. The university also has undergraduate programs such as the Morrissy Honors Program and Trailblazers, a support program for first-generation college students, in addition to pre-professional programs including pre-law, pre-medical, and pre-pharmacy.

The university&#x27;s College of Adult Undergraduate Studies offers ten majors and features part-time flexible and accelerated schedules for working adults who are pursuing bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The College of Graduate Studies provides coeducational weekend and evening classes in education, management, contemporary communication and nonprofit management, a Ph.D. in Instructional Leadership for Changing Populations, and a Doctor of Pharmacy.

The university offers two noncredit programs:
* The English Language Institute provides instruction in English language and American culture for international students, professionals and visitors to the United States. The majority of these students are in their mid- to late twenties.
* The Renaissance Institute is a voluntary association of women and men age 50 and older who pursue study of a variety of topics on a not-for-credit basis. Courses have included: literature, public affairs, writing, history, philosophy, music, art, languages, tai chi, film, science, computers, travel, strength and balance, dance and acting.

==Athletics==
Notre Dame&#x27;s athletic teams are members of the Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Notre Dame of Maryland has eight NCAA women&#x27;s sports: basketball, field hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis and volleyball and two men&#x27;s sports: soccer and basketball. All sports but swimming joined the Colonial States Athletic Conference (CSAC) starting in the 2007-2008 academic year. Although the swim team does not compete within a conference, it participates in the yearly Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) swim championships. The 2009 season was the first time that the Notre Dame softball team competed in NCAA Division III. The CSAC merged into the United East Conference (UEC) in July 2023.

Notre Dame of Maryland University&#x27;s mascot is the Gator. A redesigned logo for the university and its athletic teams was unveiled in May 2010.

<doc id="1214511" wikidata="Q133016" url="?curid=1214511" title="Eleutherococcus">
<text>Eleutherococcus is a genus of 38 species of thorny shrubs and trees in the family Araliaceae. They are native to eastern Asia, from southeast Siberia and Japan to the Philippines and Vietnam. 18 species come from China, from central to western parts.

Perhaps the best known in the West is the species &quot;E. senticosus&quot; used as herbal medicine, and commonly known by such English names as Eleuthero or Siberian ginseng. In Traditional Chinese medicine, this is administered to increase energy, thus traditionally recognized to have attributes akin to true ginseng (&quot;Panax&quot;). This is also reflected in its formerly used genus name &quot;Acanthopanax&quot; meaning &quot;thorny ginseng&quot;. The word &quot;Eleutherococcus,&quot; from Greek, means &quot;free-berried.&quot;

The European Medicines Agency has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of &quot;Eleutherococcus&quot; for any clinical condition.

==Naming==
The Chinese materia medica in question () may designate a number of species. But the plant now given the common name &quot;wujia&quot; in China is specifically &quot;E. gracilistylus&quot;, and according to one source, the genuine crude drug must come from this species, and &quot;C. spinosum&quot; is only a substitute.

The Japanese name borrows directly from the Chinese name, and refers somewhat broadly to several plants in the genus. A 10th century herbology text, &quot;Honzō wamyō&quot; (), introduced the Chinese &quot;wujia&quot; as an herb to be pronounced &quot;mu-ko-gi&quot; (), refers specifically to &quot;E. sieboldianus&quot; (Japanese name: &quot;hime-ukogi&quot;). (See #Species list below).

The taxonomical nomenclature in the botanical science also has had a sinuous history, so that &quot;Acanthopanax&quot; had been used as the proper genus name in China till recent years, while the West adopted &quot;Eleutherococcus&quot; as the official name.

Several species are also grown as ornamental garden shrubs. In Japan, they have been planted as hedges. Particularly in Yamagata Prefecture, a &quot;daimyō&quot; named Uesugi Yōzan encouraged the planting of the ukogi as fencing around the homes of samurai retainers (&quot;E. sieboldianus&quot; was planted in the region), and the bitter young buds, leaves and stems have traditionally been picked and eaten as vegetable in the area. However, since the plant is deciduous, it requires sweeping in the fall (high maintenance), and the bare hedges fail to protect the homeowner&#x27;s privacy.

<doc id="1214512" wikidata="Q766839" url="?curid=1214512" title="Basic access authentication">
<text>In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of codice_1, where codice_2 is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon codice_3.

It was originally implemented by Ari Luotonen at CERN in 1993 and defined in the HTTP 1.0 specification in 1996.
It is specified in from 2015, which obsoletes from 1999.

== Features ==
HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header.

== Security ==
The BA mechanism does not provide confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit and not encrypted or hashed in any way. Therefore, basic authentication is typically used in conjunction with HTTPS to provide confidentiality.

Because the BA field has to be sent in the header of each HTTP request, the web browser needs to cache credentials for a reasonable period of time to avoid constantly prompting the user for their username and password. Caching policy differs between browsers.

HTTP does not provide a method for a web server to instruct the client to &quot;log out&quot; the user. However, there are a number of methods to clear cached credentials in certain web browsers. One of them is redirecting the user to a URL on the same domain, using credentials that are intentionally incorrect. However, this behavior is inconsistent between various browsers and browser versions. Microsoft Internet Explorer offers a dedicated JavaScript method to clear cached credentials:
&lt;script&gt;document.execCommand(&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;
In modern browsers, cached credentials for basic authentication are typically cleared when clearing browsing history. Most browsers allow users to specifically clear only credentials, though the option may be hard to find, and typically clears credentials for all visited sites.

Brute forcing credentials is not actively prevented or detected (unless a server-side mechanism is used).

== Protocol ==

=== Server side ===
When the server wants the user agent to authenticate itself towards the server after receiving an unauthenticated request, it must send a response with a &quot;HTTP 401 Unauthorized&quot; status line and a &quot;WWW-Authenticate&quot; header field.

The &quot;WWW-Authenticate&quot; header field for basic authentication is constructed as following:

codice_4

The server may choose to include the &quot;charset&quot; parameter from :

codice_5

This parameter indicates that the server expects the client to use UTF-8 for encoding username and password (see below).

=== Client side ===
When the user agent wants to send authentication credentials to the server, it may use the &quot;Authorization&quot; header field.

The &quot;Authorization&quot; header field is constructed as follows:

# The username and password are combined with a single colon (). This means that the username itself cannot contain a colon.
# The resulting string is encoded into an octet sequence. The character set to use for this encoding is by default unspecified, as long as it is compatible with US-ASCII, but the server may suggest the use of UTF-8 by sending the &quot;charset&quot; parameter.
# The resulting string is encoded using a variant of Base64 (+/ and with padding).
# The authorization method and a space character (e.g. &quot;Basic &quot;) is then prepended to the encoded string.

For example, if the browser uses &quot;Aladdin&quot; as the username and &quot;open sesame&quot; as the password, then the field&#x27;s value is the Base64 encoding of &quot;Aladdin:open sesame&quot;, or &quot;QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==&quot;. Then the &quot;Authorization&quot; header field will appear as:

codice_6

== See also ==
* Digest access authentication
* HTTP header
* TLS-SRP, an alternative if one wants to avoid transmitting a password-equivalent to the server (even encrypted, like with TLS).

<text>Nepal Airlines Corporation (), formerly known as Royal Nepal Airlines (), is the flag carrier of Nepal. Founded in 1958, it is the oldest airline of the country. Out of its main base at Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, the airline operates domestic services within Nepal and medium-haul services in Asia. The airline&#x27;s first aircraft was a Douglas DC-3, used to serve domestic routes and a handful of destinations in India. The airline acquired its first jet aircraft, Boeing 727s, in 1972. As of February 2023, the airline operates a fleet of six aircraft. Since 2013, the airline has been on the list of air carriers banned in the European Union.

==History==
===1950s and 1960s: early years===
The airline was established in July 1958 as Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation with one Douglas DC-3. At the beginning, its services were limited to Simara, Pokhara and destinations in India, such as Patna, Calcutta and Delhi. In 1961, Pilatus Porter STOL aircraft joined the fleet, and in 1963 12-seater Chinese Feng Shou-2 Harvesters were brought into service, opening up the kingdom&#x27;s more remote routes.

Nepal&#x27;s geopolitical situation produced a strange, politically mixed fleet, which was typically financed through aid programs from the country of manufacture. Seven more Douglas DC-3s were added to the fleet between 1959 and 1964. Furthermore, China supplied a couple of Feng Shou-2 aircraft which did not enter scheduled service. Bell Helicopters leased from Singapore were also used for charters. Two Russian Mi-4 helicopters also flew on scheduled routes to remote points. The route network was expanded internally and externally, soon reaching Dhaka in what was then East Pakistan.

In 1966, a turboprop Fokker F27 was added to the airline&#x27;s fleet.

=== 1970s and 1980s: The Jet Age and economic boom ===
In 1970, RNAC acquired its first Hawker Siddeley HS 748 followed by Twin Otters in 1971 and Boeing 727s in 1972. Two Boeing 757s gradually replaced the airline&#x27;s Boeing 727s in 1987.

Nepal had 181,000 tourist visitors in 1985, of which 80 per cent arrived by air. Royal Nepal Airlines carried 38 per cent of these tourist passengers, but that number was down from the company&#x27;s peak market share of 50 per cent in 1979. Indian Airlines Corporation was RNAC&#x27;s main competitor, but newer entrants in the business were also competing with RNAC for market share. These companies included Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa, which started direct Kathmandu-Frankfurt service in cooperation with RNAC in October 1987 and now, other airlines are also wanting to do so.

At the time, Royal Nepal Airlines&#x27; network connected 38 domestic and 10 international destinations. RNAC was flying directly from Nepal to Hong Kong (home to many Gurkhas employed by the British Army) by 1988 using a Boeing 757. In April 1988, NAC and the Civil Aviation Administration of China cooperated to provide scheduled service between Kathmandu and Lhasa in the autonomous province of Tibet.

RNAC reported revenues of $54.3 million in 1988–89, producing an operating profit of $17 million. With a workforce of 2,200, NAC had become the country&#x27;s largest employer and largest earner of foreign currency, bringing in roughly $15 million a year from abroad. Seventy-five per cent of the company&#x27;s passengers were foreign tourists. London, Dubai, Dhaka, Karachi, and Bombay were added to the route network during the 1980s.

=== 1990s and 2000s: corruption ===
The domestic air market of the country was liberalized in 1992, and new competitors emerged: Necon Air, Cosmic Air, Everest Air, Buddha Air, Yeti Airlines, and Sita Air. Nepal Airlines had its last Boeing 727 flight in 1992. By 1997, these four competitors accounted for 70 per cent of Nepal&#x27;s domestic air traffic.

Adding to the airline&#x27;s struggles as the millennium approached, were allegations of corruption which periodically surfaced. One case involved Dinesh Dhamija, who later founded the Ebookers Internet travel site. Dhamija had been accused of receiving his post as director of RNAC&#x27;s European operations in the early 1990s on account of cronyism with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala. Dhamija won a substantial settlement with the airline after a bitter court battle over these charges.

In December 2000, a large scandal revolved around the lease of a Boeing 767 aircraft from Austria&#x27;s Lauda Air, which entered service over protests from employees and government officials. The latter claimed the deal was unnecessary since NAC was not getting enough usage from its two existing Boeing 757s; further, the actual cost per flight hour of the Lauda jet ended up being $5,000 ($1,150 above the cost specified in the contract). RNAC chairman Haribhakta Shrestha was suspended during an investigation, along with other NAC executives; Nepal&#x27;s tourism and civil aviation minister Tarani Dutt Chataut resigned soon after.

In 2004, it was reported that the Government of Nepal had decided to sell off 49% of its stake in Nepal Airlines, to the private sector, and hand over management control, whilst retaining a 51% share. This would provide the investment to get the airline out of significant debt. 

The former chairman of Nepal Airlines, Ramagya Chaturvedi, was jailed for corruption in February 2005.

In September 2007, the airline confirmed that it had sacrificed two goats to appease a Hindu god following technical problems with one of its aircraft. Nepal Airlines said the animals were slaughtered in front of the plane, a Boeing 757, at Tribhuvan International Airport. The offering was made to Akash Bhairab, the Hindu god of sky protection, whose symbol is seen on the company&#x27;s aircraft. The airline said that after Sunday&#x27;s ceremony, the plane successfully completed a flight to Hong Kong. Raju KC, an airline official, was quoted as saying: “The snag in the plane has now been fixed and the aircraft has resumed its flights.” The company did not say what the problem was, but reports in local media had blamed an electrical fault.

From 2000 until 2010, there were no accidents with Nepal Airlines&#x27; aircraft involved. This is the longest period without such an incident in the history of the company.

===The 2010s: addition of Airbus fleet===

In 2009, at the Dubai Airshow, Nepal Airlines signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire two Airbus A320-200 aircraft with the plans to operate flights to the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

In April 2014, Nepal Airlines unveiled a new plane after taking delivery of Xian MA-60 aircraft as a gift from AVIC company of China. The &quot;Red and Blue strips&quot; livery were replaced by the new livery, which resembles the flag of Nepal.

On 8 February 2015, Nepal Airlines received its first Airbus A320 aircraft, &quot;Sagarmatha&quot;. On 30 April 2015, its second Airbus A320, &quot;Lumbini,&quot; landed in Kathmandu. The aircraft was filled with 5 tonnes of aid material flown from the Airbus factory in Hamburg, to Nepal on delivery of the aircraft. The aid material was used in the relief effort for the 2015 Nepal earthquake. Both the aircraft were painted in the company&#x27;s new livery.

In 2015, Nepal Airlines flew 253,658 travellers, up 22.87 per cent compared to the previous year, which saw the transport of 206,430 passengers. Similarly, it flew 42,535 domestic air passengers in 2015, an increase of 21.60% compared to the previous year.

In 2016, one of the airline&#x27;s ageing Boeing 757-200 (Registration 9N-ACA) was retired after three decades of service because of the non-profitable operation with high maintenance costs; the airline sold it to BB Airways.

On 16 July 2017, Nepal Airlines launched an online ticket-booking service for international flights.

In 2018, Nepal Airlines acquired two Airbus A330-200s via Hi Fly and AAR Corporation. The first of the two jets arrived at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on 28 June and the second one on 26 July the same year. The airline plans to expand its international destinations by operating the newly added wide-body jets to cities like Seoul Incheon, Tokyo, and Sydney. In November 2018, it was reported that Nepal Airlines was considering Ethiopian Airlines as a strategic partner ahead of a planned reorganization.

In mid-March, NAC retired its remaining Boeing 757-200M after three decades of service to focus on an Airbus-only fleet. The company is likely to sell the aircraft soon.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal, Nepal Airlines carried out rescue and evacuation charter flights while all of its scheduled flights were grounded from March 2020.

In July 2020, Nepal Airlines retired its fleet of Chinese-made Xian MA60 and Harbin Y-12 aircraft, as they were found unsuited for operations in Nepal.

In May 2023, Nepal Airlines Corporation issued a tender notice regarding the proposed auction of its sole B757-200CB registered as 9N-ACB (msn 23863), along with the engines, tools, and inventory. The reserve price is USD 5.71 million. The plane has not flown since Nepal Airlines retired it in early 2018. Since then, it has remained parked at Kathmandu&#x27;s Tribhuvan International Airport.

==Destinations==

== Scandal ==
The 2017 acquisition of two Airbus A330-200 wide-body aircraft, the largest purchase in Nepal Airlines&#x27; history, has been mired in controversy and allegations of corruption. A sub-committee of Nepal&#x27;s Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee determined the deal resulted in a Rs 4.35 billion loss to the government, citing inflated pricing, questionable procurement practices, and the use of a complex network of intermediary companies. An investigation by the US Department of Justice found that AAR Corp, the initial supplier in the deal, bribed Nepali officials to secure the contract, leading to guilty pleas and fines in the United States. The scandal led to calls for investigation and action against several high-ranking Nepali officials and airline executives.

<doc id="1214535" wikidata="Q1155101" url="?curid=1214535" title="Jin (Korean state)">
<text>The state of Jin () was a confederacy of statelets which occupied some portion of the southern Korean peninsula from the 4th to 2nd centuries BCE, bordering the Korean Kingdom of Gojoseon to the north. Its capital was somewhere south of the Han River. It preceded the Samhan confederacies, each of which claimed to be the successor of the Jin state.

==Name==
&quot;Jin&quot; is the Revised Romanization of Korean , originally written in Korean Chinese characters (hanja). This character&#x27;s Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as and originally referred to the 5th earthly branch of the Chinese and Korean zodiacs, a division of the orbit of Jupiter identified with the dragon. This was associated with a bearing of 120° (between ESE and SE) but also with the two-hour period between 7 and 9 am, leading it to be associated with dawn and the direction east.

A variant romanization is Chin.

==History==
The degree of the organization of Jin as a formal political state is unclear. It seems likely that it was a federation of small states much like the subsequent Samhan. For the state to be able to contend with its contemporary Wiman Joseon and send embassies to the court of the Western Han dynasty, there was probably some level of stable central authority. Korean historian Ki-baek Lee (1984, p. 24) also suggests that the kingdom&#x27;s attempt to open direct contacts &quot;suggests a strong desire on the part of Chin [Jin] to enjoy the benefits of Chinese metal culture.&quot; However, for the most part Wiman Joseon prevented direct contact between Jin and China.

King Jun of Gojoseon is reported to have fled to Jin after Wiman seized his throne and established Wiman Joseon. Some believe that Chinese mentions of Gaeguk or Gaemaguk (蓋馬國, literally means Kingdom of armored horses, located near Kaema Plateau) refers to Jin. Goguryeo is said to have conquered &quot;Gaemaguk&quot; in 26 AD, but this may refer to a different tribe in northern Korea. An official of Gojoseon called Yeok Gye Gyeong(歷谿卿), after failing to persuade Ugeo, is said to have defected from Gojoseon to Jin, which is described to be located at the East of Gojoseon.

Records are somewhat contradictory on Jin&#x27;s demise: it either became the later Jinhan, or diverged into the Samhan as a whole. Archeological records of Jin have been found centered in territory that later became Mahan.

== Language ==
Alexander Vovin, among others, suggests that Japonic languages, which he classifies as Peninsular Japonic, were spoken in large parts of southern Korea and Jeju before they were replaced by proto-Koreanic languages. While it is believed that Koreanic/proto-Koreanic and Japonic/proto-Japonic (i.e. Peninsular Japonic) co-existed in the southern Korean Peninsula for an extended period of time, the establishment of Koreanic speakers and their assimilation of Japonic speakers may have played a role in a Yayoi migration to the Japanese archipelago, believed to have occurred between 1,000 BCE – 300 CE, which overlaps with the period in which Jin is attested. Given this overlap, it is possible that, as Kōno Rokurō and Vovin suggest was the case with the later Korean kingdom of Baekje with regards to Puyŏ languages and Han languages, Jin may have been a bilingual state with regards to Koreanic languages and Peninsular Japonic.

Korean historian Ki-Moon Lee classified the Puyŏ languages leading to &quot;Goguryo-Baekje-Wa&quot; and the Han languages, the direct ancestor of modern Korean leading to &quot;Gojoseon-Silla.”

While, Japanese historian Hideto Ito classified the Ye and Wa into the same language family.

==Archeology==
Archaeologically, Jin is commonly identified with the Korean bronze dagger culture, which succeeded the Liaoning bronze dagger culture in the late first millennium BCE. The most abundant finds from this culture have been in southwestern Korea&#x27;s Chungcheong and Jeolla regions.

Artifacts of the culture also show some similarities to the Yayoi people of Kyūshū, Japan.

Archaeologically, the northern part of the Korean Peninsula is divided into &quot;Violin-shaped daggers&quot;(비파형동검, 琵琶形銅劍) and the southern part into “Slender daggers”(세형동검, 細形銅剣), but all of them are understood by modern scholars as data proving the southward movement of the Gojoseon. This is because it is a natural historical common sense for the civilized northerners of the Chinese continent to deliver to the southerners of the Korean Peninsula. 
Both &quot;Violin-shaped daggers&quot; and “Slender daggers” have been classified as Liaoning bronze dagger culture from a long time ago to today.

Jihouming(㠱侯名) bronze artwork was excavated in Lower Xiajiadian culture.
This shows that the narrative of Gija Joseon(箕子朝鮮) in the literature is true. especially, Gija Joseon narrative was occurred in the northern Hebei Province.

Hypothesis that Gojoseon was a society with a ‘bury alive with the dead culture’ was claimed by N.Korean academia. However, the S.Korean academic community opposes the ‘bury alive with the dead culture’ theory, and the S.Korean academic community claims it as a &quot;cemeteries of generational communities or blood ties.&quot; However, it is pointed that there is a contradictory description occurring in the study of social differentiation in Bronze Age, in the S.Korean academic community.
Contrary to the claim that the displaced people of Gojoseon founded Silla, few northern relics have been identified in the southern part of the peninsula. On the other hand, in the northeastern Jin area, the &quot;Jung-do archeological culture,&quot; which is determined as a Ye-type culture, is being discovered.

==Legacy==
Jin was succeeded by the Samhan: Mahan, Jinhan and Byeonhan. Chinese historical text, &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; says that Jinhan is the successor of the Jin state, while the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; writes that Mahan, Jinhan and Byeonhan were all part of the former Jin state as well as 78 other tribes.

The name of Jin continued to be used in the name of the Jinhan confederacy and in the name &quot;Byeonjin,&quot; an alternate term for Byeonhan. In addition, for some time the leader of Mahan continued to call himself the &quot;Jin king,&quot; asserting nominal overlordship over all of the Samhan tribes.

<text>The California Central Valley grasslands is a temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands ecoregion in California&#x27;s Central Valley. It a diverse ecoregion containing areas of desert grassland (at the southern end), prairie, savanna, riparian forest, marsh, several types of seasonal vernal pools, and large lakes such as now-dry Tulare Lake (which was the largest freshwater lake in the United States west of the Mississippi), Buena Vista Lake, and Kern Lake.

The Central Valley has been greatly altered by human activity. Most of the land has been converted to farms, pastureland, or cities. Most of the valley&#x27;s wetlands have been drained. The introduction of exotic plants, especially grasses, has altered the region&#x27;s ecology.

==Geography==
The ecoregion covers an area of 46,275 km. It extends north–south through California&#x27;s Central Valley. The valley is ringed with mountains – the Sierra Nevada to the east, and the Coast Ranges to the west.

The grasslands ecoregion occupies the valley floor, which is mostly flat or gently rolling. The oak woodlands and chaparral that fringe the valley constitute the California interior chaparral and woodlands ecoregion.

The northern portion of the valley, known as the Sacramento Valley, is drained by the Sacramento River and its tributaries. The San Joaquin River and its tributaries drain most of the southern portion of the valley, which is known as the San Joaquin Valley. The Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers flow into a large inland delta before they empty westwards into the Pacific Ocean via San Francisco Bay, which occupies a gap in the Coast Ranges.

The volume of water carried by the rivers varies seasonally, increasing with winter rains and spring snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada, and decreasing during the drier summer and fall months. The rivers used to form broad seasonal wetlands, which would flood in the winter and spring and dry out in the summer and fall. Smaller vernal pools form in poorly-drained areas during the wet season. The annual precipitation also recharged a large freshwater aquifer under the valley.

Upstream dams now regulate the annual water flows on many of the valley&#x27;s rivers, impounding spring runoff to use for summer irrigation. Many of the seasonal wetlands, including most of the former delta wetlands, have been drained for agriculture, and the rivers contained in levees. The aquifer underlying the valley is also heavily tapped for irrigation and urban water, and in the past century the water table has dropped enormously across much of the valley.

The southernmost portion of the valley is a closed basin which emptied into Tulare Lake, Buena Vista Lake, and Kern Lake. These lakes and the surrounding seasonal wetlands have now mostly been drained and converted to cropland.

==Climate==
The ecoregion has a temperate Mediterranean climate, with most of the annual rainfall occurring during the winter months. Rainfall generally decreases from north to south. The western side of the valley, which is in the rain shadow of the Coast Ranges, is generally drier than the eastern side.

==Flora==
The dominant grasses in the moister areas of the valley were perennial bunch grasses, including &quot;Nassella pulchra&quot; mixed with other species. In the more extensive arid central regions this was probably not the case. Native species were adapted to cool-season growth during the wet winter months. Introduced annual grasses, which germinate at the onset of the rainy season and set seed then die during the summer drought, now dominate most valley grasslands. Grassland wildflowers include California poppy (&quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;), lupines, and purple owl&#x27;s clover (&quot;Castilleja exserta&quot;), which can still be seen, especially in the Tehachapi Mountains and Antelope Valley south of the valley, and the Carrizo Plain southwest of the valley, where they create colorful springtime blooms.

Riverside trees include willows, western sycamore (&quot;Platanus racemosa&quot;), box elder (&quot;Acer negundo&quot;), Fremont cottonwood (&quot;Populus fremontii&quot;), and valley oak (&quot;Quercus lobata&quot;).

==Fauna==
The Central Valley was once home to large populations of pronghorn antelope (&quot;Antilocapra americana&quot;), elk including the endemic tule elk subspecies (&quot;Cervus elaphus nannodes&quot;), mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;), California ground squirrels, gophers, mice, hare, rabbits and kangaroo rats. Several species or subspecies of rodents are endemic or near-endemic to the southern valley habitats, including the Fresno kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys nitratoides exilis&quot;), Tipton kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys nitratoides nitratoides&quot;), San Joaquin pocket mouse (&quot;Perognathus inornatus&quot;), and giant kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys ingens&quot;). The San Joaquin kit fox (&quot;Vulpes macrotis mutica&quot;) is an endangered subspecies surviving on the hillsides of the San Joaquin Valley.

The wetlands of the Valley were an important habitat for wintering waterbirds and migrating birds along the Pacific flyway. Three birds are nearly endemic to the ecoregion – the yellow-billed magpie (&quot;Pica nuttalli&quot;), tricolored blackbird (&quot;Agelaius tricolor&quot;), and Nuttall&#x27;s woodpecker (&quot;Picoides nuttalii&quot;).

Reptiles and amphibians of the valley include the endemic San Joaquin coachwhip snake (&quot;Masticophis flagellum ruddocki&quot;), blunt-nosed leopard lizard (&quot;Gambelia sila&quot;), Gilbert&#x27;s skink (&quot;Eumeces gilberti&quot;) and the western aquatic garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis couchii&quot;). There are also a number of endemic invertebrates.

The Central Valley is also home to a wide variety of endemic fish species, including the Sacramento pikeminnow, Sacramento perch, Sacramento blackfish, and Sacramento splittail, among others.

==Protected areas==

1,935 km, or 4%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. 3% of the area outside protected areas remains in grassland or other undeveloped habitat. Most of the protected and undeveloped area is dominated by introduced species, with smaller areas of relatively intact habitat.

The Great Valley Grasslands State Park preserves an example of the habitat in the valley, while oak savanna habitats remain near Visalia. There are areas of wetland and riverside woodland in the north especially on the Sacramento River system including the Nature Conservancy&#x27;s Cosumnes River Preserve just south of Sacramento, Gray Lodge Wildlife Area, Butte Sink Wildlife Management Area, and other patches in the delta area. Remaining vernal pools include Pixley National Wildlife Refuge between Tulare, and Bakersfield and Jepson Prairie Preserve in the delta. There are large blocks of desert scrubland in the southern San Joaquin Valley and in the Carrizo Plain, a basin lying southwest of the Central Valley in the Coast Ranges which has a similar climate and landscape.

<doc id="1214539" wikidata="Q828371" url="?curid=1214539" title="Feathered dinosaur">
<text>A feathered dinosaur is any species of dinosaur possessing feathers. That includes all species of birds, and in recent decades evidence has accumulated that many non-avian dinosaur species also possessed feathers in some shape or form. The extent to which feathers or feather-like structures were present in dinosaurs as a whole is a subject of ongoing debate and research.

It has been suggested that feathers had originally functioned as thermal insulation, as it remains their function in the down feathers of infant birds prior to their eventual modification in birds into structures that support flight.

Since scientific research began on dinosaurs in the early 1800s, they were generally believed to be closely related to modern reptiles such as lizards. The word &quot;dinosaur&quot; itself, coined in 1842 by paleontologist Richard Owen, comes from the Greek for &#x27;terrible lizard&#x27;. That view began to shift during the so-called dinosaur renaissance in scientific research in the late 1960s; by the mid-1990s, significant evidence had emerged that dinosaurs were much more closely related to birds, which descended directly from the theropod group of dinosaurs.

Knowledge of the origin of feathers developed as new fossils were discovered throughout the 2000s and the 2010s, and technology enabled scientists to study fossils more closely. Among non-avian dinosaurs, feathers or feather-like integument have been discovered in dozens of genera via direct and indirect fossil evidence. Although the vast majority of feather discoveries have been in coelurosaurian theropods, feather-like integument has also been discovered in at least three ornithischians, suggesting that feathers may have been present on the last common ancestor of the Ornithoscelida, a dinosaur group including both theropods and ornithischians. It is possible that feathers first developed in even earlier archosaurs, in light of the discovery of vaned feathers in pterosaurs. Fossil feathers from the dinosaur &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; contain traces of beta-proteins (formerly called beta-keratins), confirming that early feathers had a composition similar to that of feathers in modern birds. Crocodilians also possess beta keratin similar to those of birds, which suggests that they evolved from common ancestral genes.

==History of research==
===Early===
Shortly after the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, the British biologist Thomas Henry Huxley proposed that birds were descendants of dinosaurs. He compared the skeletal structure of &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, a small theropod dinosaur, and the &quot;first bird&quot; &quot;Archaeopteryx lithographica&quot; (both of which were found in the Upper Jurassic Bavarian limestone of Solnhofen). He showed that, apart from its hands and feathers, &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; was quite similar to &quot;Compsognathus&quot;. Thus &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; represents a transitional fossil. In 1868, he published &quot;On the Animals which are most nearly intermediate between Birds and Reptiles&quot;, which made that case.

The first restoration of a feathered dinosaur was Huxley&#x27;s depiction in 1876 of a feathered &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, made to accompany a bird evolution lecture he delivered in New York, in which he speculated that the aforementioned dinosaur might have had feathers.

===Dinosaur renaissance===
A century later, during the dinosaur renaissance, paleoartists began to create modern restorations of highly active dinosaurs. In 1969, Robert T. Bakker drew a running &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. His student Gregory S. Paul depicted non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs with feathers and protofeathers, starting in the late 1970s. 

===Fossil discoveries===

The first known specimen of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, on the basis of which the genus was named, was an isolated feather, although whether or not it belongs to &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; has been controversial. One of the earliest discoveries of possible feather impressions by non-avian dinosaurs is a trace fossil (&quot;Fulicopus lyellii&quot;) of the 195–199 million year old Portland Formation in the northeastern United States. Gierlinski (1996, 1997, 1998) and Kundrát (2004) have interpreted traces between two footprints in this fossil as feather impressions from the belly of a squatting dilophosaurid. Although some reviewers have raised questions about the naming and interpretation of this fossil, if correct, that early Jurassic fossil is the oldest known evidence of feathers, almost 30 million years older than the next-oldest-known evidence.

The most important discoveries at Liaoning have been a host of feathered dinosaur fossils, with a steady stream of new finds filling in the picture of the dinosaur–bird connection and adding more to theories of the evolutionary development of feathers and flight. Turner &quot;et al&quot;. (2007) reported quill knobs from an ulna of &quot;Velociraptor mongoliensis&quot;, and these are strongly correlated with large and well-developed secondary feathers.
Behavioural evidence, in the form of an oviraptorosaur on its nest, showed another link with birds. Its forearms were folded, like those of a bird. Although no feathers were preserved, it is likely that these would have been present to insulate eggs and juveniles.
Not all of the Chinese fossil discoveries proved valid however. In 1999, a supposed fossil of an apparently feathered dinosaur named &quot;Archaeoraptor liaoningensis&quot;, also found in Liaoning, turned out to be a forgery. Comparing the photograph of the specimen with another find, Chinese paleontologist Xu Xing came to the conclusion that it was composed of two portions of different fossil animals. His claim made &quot;National Geographic&quot; review their research and they too came to the same conclusion.

In 2011, samples of amber were discovered to contain preserved feathers from 75 to 80 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period, with evidence that they were from both dinosaurs and birds. Initial analysis suggests that some of the feathers were used for insulation, and not flight. More complex feathers were revealed to have variations in coloration similar to modern birds, while simpler protofeathers were predominantly dark. Only 11 specimens are currently known. The specimens are too rare to be broken open to study their melanosomes (pigment-bearing organelles), but there are plans for using non-destructive high-resolution X-ray imaging. Melanosomes produce colouration in feathers; as differently-shaped melanosomes produce different colours, subsequent research on melanosomes preserved in feathered dinosaur specimens has led to reconstructions of the life appearance of several dinosaur species. These include &quot;Anchiornis&quot;, &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, &quot;Microraptor&quot;, and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;.

In 2016, the discovery was announced of a feathered dinosaur tail preserved in amber that is estimated to be 99 million years old. Lida Xing, a researcher from the China University of Geosciences in Beijing, found the specimen at an amber market in Myanmar. It is the first definitive discovery of dinosaur material in amber.

==Current knowledge==
===Non-avian dinosaur species preserved with evidence of feathers===


Several non-avian dinosaurs are now known to have been feathered. Direct evidence of feathers exists for several species. In all examples, the evidence described consists of feather impressions, except those genera inferred to have had feathers based on skeletal or chemical evidence, such as the presence of quill knobs (the anchor points for wing feathers on the forelimb) or a pygostyle (the fused vertebrae at the tail tip which often supports large feathers).

===Primitive feather types===

Integumentary structures that gave rise to the feathers of birds are seen in the dorsal spines of reptiles and fish. A similar stage in their evolution to the complex coats of birds and mammals can be observed in living reptiles such as iguanas and &quot;Gonocephalus&quot; agamids. Feather structures are thought to have proceeded from simple hollow filaments through several stages of increasing complexity, ending with the large, deeply rooted feathers with strong pens (rachis), barbs and barbules that birds display today.

According to Prum&#x27;s (1999) proposed model, at stage I, the follicle originates with a cylindrical epidermal depression around the base of the feather papilla. The first feather resulted when undifferentiated tubular follicle collar developed out of the old keratinocytes being pushed out. At stage II, the inner, basilar layer of the follicle collar differentiated into longitudinal barb ridges with unbranched keratin filaments, while the thin peripheral layer of the collar became the deciduous sheath, forming a tuft of unbranched barbs with a basal calamus. Stage III consists of two developmental novelties, IIIa and IIIb, as either could have occurred first. Stage IIIa involves helical displacement of barb ridges arising within the collar. The barb ridges on the anterior midline of the follicle fuse together, forming the rachis. The creation of a posterior barb locus follows, giving an indeterminate number of barbs. This resulted in a feather with a symmetrical, primarily branched structure with a rachis and unbranched barbs. In stage IIIb, barbules paired within the peripheral barbule plates of the barb ridges, create branched barbs with rami and barbules. This resulting feather is one with a tuft of branched barbs without a rachis. At stage IV, differentiated distal and proximal barbules produce a closed, pennaceous vane (a contour feather). A closed vane develops when pennulae on the distal barbules form a hooked shape to attach to the simpler proximal barbules of the adjacent barb. Stage V developmental novelties gave rise to additional structural diversity in the closed pennaceous feather. Here, asymmetrical flight feathers, bipinnate plumulaceous feathers, filoplumes, powder down, and bristles evolved.

Some evidence suggests that the original function of simple feathers was insulation. In particular, preserved patches of skin in large, derived, tyrannosauroids show scutes, while those in smaller, more primitive, forms show feathers. This may indicate that the larger forms had complex skins, with both scutes and filaments, or that tyrannosauroids may be like rhinos and elephants, having filaments at birth and then losing them as they developed to maturity. An adult &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; weighed about as much as an African elephant. If large tyrannosauroids were endotherms, they would have needed to radiate heat efficiently. This is due to the different structural properties of feathers compared to fur.

Some evidence also suggests that more derived feather types may have served as insulation. For instance, a study of oviraptorid pennaceous wing feathers and nesting posture suggests that elongated wing feathers evidently may have served to fill gaps between brooding individuals&#x27; insulatory body chamber and the outside environment. This &quot;wall&quot; of wing feathers could have shielded eggs from temperature extremes.

There is an increasing body of evidence that supports the display hypothesis, which states that early feathers were colored and increased reproductive success. Coloration could have provided the original adaptation of feathers, implying that all later functions of feathers, such as thermoregulation and flight, were ed. This hypothesis has been supported by the discovery of pigmented feathers in multiple species. Supporting the display hypothesis is the fact that fossil feathers have been observed in a ground-dwelling herbivorous dinosaur clade, making it unlikely that feathers functioned as predatory tools or as a means of flight. Additionally, some specimens have iridescent feathers. Pigmented and iridescent feathers may have provided greater attractiveness to mates, providing enhanced reproductive success when compared to non-colored feathers. Current research shows that it is plausible that theropods would have had the visual acuity necessary to see the displays. In a study by Stevens (2006), the binocular field of view for &quot;Velociraptor&quot; has been estimated to be 55 to 60 degrees, which is about that of modern owls. Visual acuity for &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; has been predicted to be anywhere from about that of humans to 13 times that of humans. Paleontological and evolutionary developmental studies show that feathers or feather-like structures were converting back to scales.

The idea that precursors of feathers appeared before they were co-opted for insulation is already stated in Gould and Vrba (1982). The original benefit might have been metabolic. Feathers are largely made of the keratin protein complex, which has disulfide bonds between amino acids that give it stability and elasticity. The metabolism of amino acids containing sulfur can be toxic; however, if the sulfur amino acids are not catabolized as the final products of urea or uric acid but used for the synthesis of keratin instead, the release of hydrogen sulfide is extremely reduced or avoided. For an organism whose metabolism works at high internal temperatures of or greater, it can be extremely important to prevent the excess production of hydrogen sulfide. This hypothesis could be consistent with the need for high metabolic rate of theropod dinosaurs.

The point is not known with certainty in archosaur phylogeny that the earliest simple &quot;protofeathers&quot; arose, as well as whether they arose once or independently multiple times. Filamentous structures are clearly present in pterosaurs, and long, hollow quills have been reported in specimens of the ornithischian dinosaurs &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tianyulong&quot; although there has been disagreement. In 2009, Xu et al. noted that the hollow, unbranched, stiff integumentary structures found on a specimen of &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot; were strikingly similar to the integumentary structures of &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; and pterosaurs. They suggested that all of these structures may have been inherited from a common ancestor much earlier in the evolution of archosaurs, possibly in an ornithodire from the Middle Triassic or earlier. More recently, findings in Russia of the basal neornithischian &quot;Kulindadromeus&quot; report that although the lower leg and tail seemed to be scaled, &quot;varied integumentary structures were found directly associated with skeletal elements, supporting the hypothesis that simple filamentous feathers, as well as compound feather-like structures comparable to those in theropods, were widespread amongst the whole dinosaur clade.&quot; In contrast, a 2016 study published in the Journal of Geology suggested that the integumentary structures found on &quot;Kulindadromeus&quot; and &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; may be highly deformed scales rather than filamentous feathers.

Display feathers are also known from dinosaurs that are very primitive members of the bird lineage, or Avialae. The most primitive example is &quot;Epidexipteryx&quot;, which had a short tail with extremely long, ribbon-like feathers. Oddly enough, the fossil does not preserve wing feathers, suggesting that &quot;Epidexipteryx&quot; was either secondarily flightless, or that display feathers evolved before flight feathers in the bird lineage. Plumaceous feathers are found in nearly all lineages of Theropoda common in the northern hemisphere, and pennaceous feathers are attested as far down the tree as the Ornithomimosauria. The fact that only adult &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; had wing-like structures suggests that pennaceous feathers evolved for mating displays.

==Phylogeny and inference of feathers in other dinosaurs==
This technique, called phylogenetic bracketing, can also be used to infer the type of feathers a species may have had, since the developmental history of feathers is now reasonably well-known. All feathered species had filamentaceous or plumaceous (downy) feathers, with pennaceous feathers found among the more bird-like groups. The following cladogram is adapted from Godefroit &quot;et al.&quot;, 2013.

Grey denotes a clade that is not known to contain any feathered specimen at the time of writing, some of which have fossil evidence of scales. The presence or lack of feathered specimens in a given clade does not confirm that all members in a clade have the specified integument, unless corroborated with representative fossil evidence within clade members.

The following cladogram is from Xu (2020).

# Slender monofilamentous integument

<text>Titchfield is a village and former civil parish in the Fareham district, in southern Hampshire, England, by the River Meon. The village has a history stretching back to the 6th century. During the medieval period, the village operated a small port and market. Near to the village are the ruins of Titchfield Abbey, a place with strong associations with Shakespeare, through his patron, the Earl of Southampton.

==Geography==
To the east of Titchfield lies the town of Fareham, to the south are Stubbington, Hill Head and the Solent, to the west is Locks Heath, Warsash, the River Hamble and Southampton and to the north is Whiteley, Park Gate and Swanwick. Titchfield forms part of the Borough of Fareham, having been added to the Fareham urban district in 1932.

Several miles to the south of the village, at the mouth of the River Meon and on the shores of the Solent, is Titchfield Haven National Nature Reserve, where there is a small harbour that dries out at low tide. Inland is a Nature Reserve which is an important breeding and visiting ground for many species of birds and wildfowl (and is open to visitors at certain periods).

Near to the village and the haven lies the Titchfield Canal, earlier known as the New River. It has been suggested that this is the second oldest canal in England, completed in 1611 (Exeter was the first). However, as late as 1676 two tenants, John Cooper and John Landy, complained in the Manorial Court that the Lord of the Manor &quot;by Cutting ye new River hath taken away and doth detain&quot; parts of their copyholds, implying that in 1676 the construction was recent. It lies close to Titchfield Haven, concealed by a bridge with the remains of a sea-lock at the south end. A footpath follows the canal to Titchfield village. It was certainly used for flooding the water meadows, traces of which can still be clearly seen. Whether it was ever used as a navigation channel is still debated. The Earl of Southampton ordered the river to be sealed off from the sea by a wall which was an unpopular move with the villagers as it ultimately ended Titchfield&#x27;s role as a port.

== History ==
The first people mentioned as inhabiting the area were a Jutish tribe, the Meonwara. The tribe were part of the Jutes originating from Denmark who founded the village during the 6th century. The name of Titchfield comes from the Old English ticcen, meaning kid or young goat, and feld, meaning field. Therefore, the meaning of Titchfield is &#x27;open lands where kids are kept&#x27;.

===St Peter&#x27;s Church, Titchfield===

St Peter&#x27;s Church, Titchfield, was established in about 680 making it one of the oldest used churches in England. Though only a few parts of the original structure survive, the church contains a mixture of building styles, since it was expanded and redeveloped to include additional space. Within the church is the resplendent tomb of Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, who when Lord Chancellor, personally tortured Anne Askew.

Domesday Book mentions &quot;Ticefelle&quot;: with a mill, a market and farms. It was a successful community, though tiny by today&#x27;s standards with a population of 160. The Domesday Book entry for Titchfield states &quot;The King holds TICEFELLE. It is a berewick, and belongs to MENESTOCHES. King Edward held it. There are 2 hides; but they have not paid geld. (There) is land for 15 ploughs. In (the) demesne (there are) but 2 oxen (animalia), and (there are) 16 villeins and 13 borders with 9 ploughs. There are 4 serfs, and a mill worth 20 shillings. The market and toll (are worth) 40 shillings.&quot;

A further variation in the spelling may be seen in a Mediaeval legal record, where it appears as &quot;Thechefeld&quot; 

Titchfield has long been a centre for business, with the village once having a small port. There were also tanneries (some of the buildings still exist), a market, a fair, brewers, craftsmen, traders and other business people. It is recorded that Henry V before Agincourt and Charles I before his imprisonment at Carisbrooke rested in the town.

A Market Hall was built in Titchfield Square by the 3rd Earl of Southampton in the early 17th century. This was moved behind the Queen&#x27;s Head Public House in 1810. In 1801 Titchfield had a population of almost 3,000. In 1865 a gas company provided gaslight to the village and in 1894 Titchfield was given a parish council.

In 1970, with the market hall in a derelict state, it was bought by the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. The entire hall was dismantled and moved to Singleton where it now stands restored in the centre of a new (old) village.

At the 2001 census, the population of the village was estimated at 7,000.
== Civil parish ==
In 1931 the parish had a population of 2,366. On 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished and merged with Fareham, part also went to form Curbridge.

==Places of interest==
===Titchfield Abbey===

Premonstratensian canons founded Titchfield Abbey in 1222. Henry VIII dissolved the abbey in the 16th century, giving the property to a favoured politician, Thomas Wriothesley who turned it into &quot;Place House&quot; and took the title Earl of Southampton. Wriothesley&#x27;s heirs, including the Duke of Portland and the Duke of Beaufort lived at Place House until 1742 at which point the estate was sold to the Delmé family. They lived there for another forty years until, in 1781, a decision was made to abandon the mansion.

Much of the buildings were deliberately demolished to create a romantic ruin. When this happened local people took stone from the abbey for their homes; evidence can be seen in walls and foundations of older houses in Titchfield village. Much, though, is inside the buildings; in The Bugle Hotel in Titchfield, for example, one can see a big fireplace that was salvaged from the ruins. The remains of Titchfield Abbey and Place House are now administered by English Heritage.

===Titchfield Tithe Barn===

Also known as Titchfield Abbey Barn is an aisled barn whose timbers date to 1408-09.

=== Office for National Statistics ===
Just outside Titchfield is one of the offices of the Office for National Statistics. The office is the national centre for population, regional and demographic statistics. It is one of three national statistical centres run by the Office for National Statistics.

===Titchfield Common===
Titchfield Common is a ward of Fareham Borough to the north and northwest of Titchfield itself.

==Events==
The Titchfield Carnival took place in October every year from 1880 to 2006, organised by the Titchfield Bonfire Boys Society. By 2006 it was the largest village carnival in Hampshire. However, in 2007, due to the lack of funding and increasing costs, the carnival did not take place. The Titchfield Carnival returned in 2008 and it took place on Sunday 26 November 2008.

Entertainment also takes place within the ruins of the Abbey. On yearly occasions plays are performed in the Abbey: for example Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream by William Shakespeare has been performed.

==Notable people==
Around 1636, Rachel Russell, English noblewoman, heiress, and author, was born as Lady Rachel Wriothesley, the second eldest daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, by his first wife, Rachel de Massue, daughter of Daniel de Massue, Seigneur de Rouvigny and Madeleine de Pinot des Fontaines.
* Richard Austin (1598–1645), early colonist of the United States
* Steve Claridge (born 1966), former footballer, now a pundit; grew up in the village
* Henry Timberlake (1570–1625), merchant adventurer, died in Titchfield

<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation [[SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification|5-BEL]] to the five-car all-Pullman electric multiple units which worked the prestigious Brighton Belle trains between London Victoria and Brighton. These units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 403. Between 1933 and 1935 the units were designated 5-PUL (the &#x27;PUL&#x27; code was then used for the 6-PUL units).

==Construction==
The SR electrified the London Victoria to Brighton line in the early 1930s, and full electric services commenced over the route from 1 January 1933. For the high-profile &quot;Southern Belle&quot; Pullman train three five-car units, consisting entirely of Pullman cars, were built. All 15 cars were built by Metropolitan Cammell. In June 1934 the Southern Railway renamed the &quot;Southern Belle&quot; as the &quot;Brighton Belle&quot;.

As they were Pullman cars, owned by the independent Pullman Car Company (UK), the individual carriages were numbered in its series, taking numbers 279 to 293, and the first class cars were given women&#x27;s names while the third (from June 1956, second) class cars carried less-inspiring &quot;Car No xx&quot; designations, derived from the second and third digits of the Pullman Car Company&#x27;s number. However, the units together were allocated numbers in the SR series, originally taking , which was revised in January 1937 to .

==Formations==
Three different car types were built - Driving Motor Brake Parlour Third (DMBPT), Trailer Parlour First with Kitchen (TPFK), and Trailer Parlour Third (TPT). Initial formations of these units were as follows:

==Withdrawal and preservation==
The last &quot;Brighton Belle&quot; train ran on 30 April 1972, and the three 5BEL units were withdrawn. However all 15 cars were sold into private ownership, though no unit was kept together as a single entity. Instead they were split up and each vehicle was initially used as an individual Pullman car, the majority not in railway use. A number have been returned to service on the main line with the Belmond British Pullman (previously the Venice Simplon Orient Express or VSOE), as hauled cars forming part of the British Pullman charter train. A campaign to return the Brighton Belle to mainline service was launched by the 5BEL Trust in 2008. By 2009, the trust had assembled a four-car set, having acquired cars from the North Norfolk Railway and VSOE. A fifth car, No.282 &#x27;Doris&#x27;, was acquired from the Bluebell Railway in 2011 and a sixth, No.279 &#x27;Hazel&#x27; in 2012. After restoration, the Brighton Belle started testing in January 2025 from its base at Crewe.

The table below sets out the current position:


==Model railways==
Hornby Railways produced OO gauge models of the 5-BEL from 2012, in both BR blue and grey and Pullman umber and cream liveries. N gauge models were introduced in 2013 at 1:143 scale, under Hornby&#x27;s Arnold brand, in both umber and cream livery and BR blue and grey livery.

<text>Pok Fu Lam () or Pokfulam is a residential area on Hong Kong Island, at the western end of the Southern District. It is a valley between Victoria Peak and Mount Kellett, around Telegraph Bay.

Pok Fu Lam can claim several &quot;firsts&quot; in the history of Hong Kong: It was the place where Hong Kong&#x27;s floral emblem, &quot;Bauhinia blakeana&quot;, was first discovered; the site for Hong Kong&#x27;s first reservoir, Pok Fu Lam Reservoir (1883, now part of a country park), and the site for Hong Kong&#x27;s first dairy farm by five investors, including Sir Patrick Manson in 1885. The farm supplied not only milk, but cattle to Hong Kong, and later became Dairy Farm. However, it no longer exists in Pok Fu Lam.

Pok Fu Lam is connected to Lung Fu Shan, Sai Ying Pun and Aberdeen by the Pok Fu Lam Road. It&#x27;s also indirectly connected to the Mid-Levels. Pok Fu Lam also overlooks Lamma Island. Pok Fu Lam is connected to Kennedy Town via Smithfield and Shek Tong Tsui via Hill Road.
==Sights==
While the farm no longer exists, its remains and other colonial era institutions continue to exist serving, in some cases, other purposes. The former dairy farm can still be seen in the grassy slopes of the hills, but mainly in the two milking sheds that remain. They are between the new Vocational Training Center and the much older Béthanie. Béthanie and the cow sheds are presently administered by the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, but were previously controlled by the University of Hong Kong which used Béthanie as headquarters for the HKU Press. The APA uses Béthanie and the cow sheds for various educational purposes, but also lends the chapel in Béthanie to St. John&#x27;s Cathedral (Anglican) as the locale for Emmanuel Church - Pokfulam, a daughter (subordinate) church serving the west of Hong Kong Island.

Béthanie was built as a sanatorium between 1873 and 1875 for the French Catholic missionaries in China, better known as Missions Etrangères de Paris or MEP. Recently restored with loving care, Béthanie is now used by the Academy for the Performing Arts for educational purposes. Béthanie includes a small chapel. In its present restored configuration, this chapel seats about 100 and is used each Sunday by Emmanuel Church - Pokfulam, a daughter church of St. John&#x27;s Cathedral. The Béthanie chapel is a beautiful Neo Gothic structure. Some of the original statuary and stained glass windows have been recovered and re-installed.

Across the Pokfulam Road, is University Hall. U-Hall, as it is abbreviated, is a residential unit for undergraduates of the University of Hong Kong. Originally, U-Hall was the residence of a merchant, but eventually, it came under the control of the same French Catholic missionaries who built Béthanie. It was extended greatly and printed religious literature in its basement in many languages for nearly 100 years. In the 1950s, when missionary work in China died, the building was given to the HK government which gave it to the University of Hong Kong as a student residential unit. It is smaller now than it used to be, but still houses 100 or so undergraduates. There was a chapel in the building: it now serves as the dining hall for the students. University Hall is much in demand as a location for movies, wedding photos, advertisements, and other purposes.

==Village==
At the centre of Pok Fu Lam is an indigenous village, the Pok Fu Lam Village (), the only one of its kind remaining on Hong Kong Island. Often mistaken as a shanty town by the residents of the surrounding apartments, the conservation value of the village has been acknowledged by its inclusion on the 2014 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.

===History===

Pok Fu Lam Village is a historic village, which has existed since the beginning of the 17th century. Local residents in the past have repeatedly asked the government to give indigenous inhabitants of Pok Fu Lam the same recognition as residents of the New Territories. These claims have been rejected by the government which also threatened demolition of the village.

In the Kangxi period (late 17th century) of the Qing dynasty, approximately 2,000 people seeking asylum from turmoils in mainland China reached this village. The early villagers, mostly with the surnames of Chen, Huang, and Luo, were farmers. The &quot;Xinan County Journal&quot; of 1819 mentioned that Pok Fu Lam Village was one of three villages on Hong Kong Island (the other ones were at Stanley and Wong Chuk Hang). It was described as &quot;built alongside the hill and the creek, its structures are quite elegant&quot;.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Pok Fu Lam was 833. The number of males was 580.

After the Second World War, the massive refugee influx seeking asylum from mainland China reached Hong Kong, resulting in the village population increasing from 20-odd households to more than 100 households. The original vegetable gardens were replaced by houses. It was not until the 1980s, when the Hong Kong economy experienced rapid growth, that the village population began to decrease, but many villagers remain in the village today.

===Fire Dragon Festival===

The villagers have their own festivals: the annual Fire Dragon Dance, the oldest of its kind in Hong Kong, is held during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and is organised entirely by the villagers, who strive to preserve the unique festival for the generations to come. Ng Kong-kin, master craftsman of the 73.3 metre long dragon, has been making these creatures for more than four decades, and continues to volunteer his time building the enormous beast every year; his brother Ng Kong-nan, supervises the training of the dancers and preparation for the annual celebrations. All villagers participate in the burning of incense and each household is blessed by the dragons as they dance through the village, making the festival a fundamental part of the village life. Many other less well known festivals include Bou Chun Tin, which commemorates Nüwa repairing the Wall of Heaven; Fa San Fuk, a ritual carried out on Lunar New Year&#x27;s Eve for good fortune throughout the year; and Jip Nin Gang, when villagers calculate the best time in Chinese &quot;feng shui&quot; to welcome the new year, and prepare celebratory procedures for the particular moment.

===Buildings===
The forest village is divided into three parts: Middle is &quot;Wai Chai&quot;, Northern portion is &quot;the vegetable garden&quot;, the village tail is &quot;Long Tzutu&quot;. There are few types of village house. Some are made of stone and hay with Chinese tiled pitched roof. Some Chinese tiled pitched roof had been replaced with galvanised steel roof. Some village houses are made of brick with concrete flat roof or galvanised steel roofs. In addition the village has a characteristic tower, named or Li Ling Fairy Tower (), which is approximately 5 meters high. The existing pagoda was rebuilt in 1916. The first pagoda was built of stone as advised by the elder villagers.

==Housing estates==

Pok Fu Lam is notable for its quiet, green living environment (by Hong Kong standard), attracting a significant number of expatriates, many of whom work at the nearby University of Hong Kong.
Several private housing estates are located in Pok Fu Lam.
* Chi Fu Fa Yuen () was developed in the mid-seventies by Hongkong Land. It comprises 20 towers of 28-storey high-rise buildings with a total of 4,258 residential units and 7 towers of 5-storey villa type low-rise buildings with 70 household units.
* Pokfulam Gardens
* Baguio Villa

==Education==

* German Swiss International School maintains a campus adjacent to Pok Fu Lam Village.
* Kellett School has a preparatory campus by the intersection between Pok Fu Lam Road and Shek Pai Wan Road.
* Ebenezer School &amp; Home for the Visually Impaired is located along Pok Fu Lam Road. 
* West Island School, a secondary school part of the English Schools Foundation is located along Victoria Road.

<text>The National Humanities Medal is an American award that annually recognizes several individuals, groups, or institutions for work that has &quot;deepened the nation&#x27;s understanding of the humanities, broadened our citizens&#x27; engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans&#x27; access to important resources in the humanities.&quot;
The annual [[Charles Frankel]] Prize in the Humanities was established in 1988 and succeeded by the National Humanities Medal in 1997. The token is a bronze medal designed by a 1995 Frankel Prize winner, David Macaulay.

Medals are conferred annually, usually by the U.S. President, to as many as twelve living candidates and existing organizations nominated early in the calendar year. The president selects the winners in consultation with the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). NEH asks that nominators consult the list of previous winners and consider the National Medal of Arts to recognize contributions in &quot;the creative or performing arts&quot;.

<text>Leo Kinlen is a British cancer researcher. His hypothesis, explaining the higher rate of leukemia in the areas around the British Sellafield nuclear complex, than in other parts of the country, is that the mixing of the population, which occurred when people started moving into the area to work at the facility, resulted in the spreading of a virus that could cause leukemia. The theory was first developed in 1988 by Kinlen, and has achieved very little international recognition. No specific virus has been implicated.

<text>Most Serene Republic (; ; Polish: &quot;Najjaśniejsza Rzeczpospolita&quot;) is a title attached to a number of European states through history. By custom, the appellation &quot;Most Serene&quot; is an indicator of sovereignty (see also Serene Highness or Most Serene Highness for a sovereign prince). When used in the past, the title &quot;Most Serene Republic&quot; emphasized the sovereignty of the republic.

== Modern states ==
Currently, no country officially calls itself a &quot;Most Serene Republic&quot;: Only two modern independent nations are still sometimes referred to by this style: San Marino, officially &quot;the Republic of San Marino&quot; (). Poland, while officially &quot;the Republic of Poland&quot; (), is also at times called &quot;the Most Serene Republic of Poland&quot; (Polish: &quot;Najjaśniejsza Rzeczpospolita&quot;).

== Historical states ==
* The Most Serene Republic of Venice (; ), a city-state that existed from 697 to 1797 based in the city of Venice with continuously controlled territory along the eastern Adriatic and Greece at its strongest period. The phrase (&quot;The Most Serene&quot;) was also popularly used as a specific reference to the Venetian government or state authorities.
* The Most Serene Republic of Genoa (; ), an independent state based in Liguria on the northwestern Italian coast from to 1805. After using the plain title of &quot;Republic&quot; for a long time, the honorific &quot;Most Serene&quot; was added after the election of the first Doge of Genoa (1339). Even so, to distinguish their government from its ancient rival to the east, the Genoese rarely used the &quot;Most Serene&quot; designation, opting more frequently for the appellation &quot;Superb Republic&quot; (), a nickname allegedly coined by Petrarch in 1358.
* The Most Serene Republic of Lucca (), a city-state that existed from 1119 to 1799 based in the city of Lucca, in northern Tuscany, Italy. Lucca was the third largest Italian city state (after Venice and Genoa) with a republican constitution () to remain independent over the centuries.
* Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (the Most Serene Commonwealth of Both Nations; ; ), an elective monarchy in Central and Eastern Europe, existing from 1569 until 1795.

<doc id="1214571" wikidata="Q69198" url="?curid=1214571" title="Anton Ackermann">
<text>Anton Ackermann (born Eugen Hanisch, 25 November 1905 – 4 May 1973) was an East German politician. In 1953, he briefly served as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

==Life and career==
He was born into the family of a weaver and worked as an unskilled labourer from a young age while pursuing his elementary studies. At the same time, he began his political career in the Free Socialist Youth (FSJ) of the Social Democratic Party. 

From 1920 to 1928, he worked as functionary of the Communist Youth League of Germany. In 1926 he joined the Communist Party of Germany. He studied at the Lenin School in Moscow. Back in Germany, the Communist Party was expelled after the Nazis gained power in 1933. Ackermann continued working for the illegal Communist Party.

From 1935 to 1937 he lived in Prague. During the Spanish Civil War, Ackermann was the leader of the Political School of the International Brigades. After staying a short while, he went to Moscow and became editor of the German language newspaper &quot;The Free Word&quot;.

In 1943 he became an active member of the Moscow-based National Committee for a Free Germany (NKFD).

After World War II, at the end of April 1945, he returned to Saxony as head of the Ackermann Group, one of the three teams, each of ten men, flown in by the Communist Party from Moscow to different parts of the Soviet occupation zone to lay the groundwork for the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. He joined the newly reformed East German Communist party, the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in 1946. He was elected into the Central Committee and became a candidate member of the Politburo in 1949. From 1950 to 1954, he was a member of the People&#x27;s Chamber.

Ackermann suggested that because the new state created out of the Soviet occupation would be a &quot;progressive state&quot; constituted from anti-fascist principles, it would not be a hindrance to the eventual progression towards socialism and therefore Germany could have a peaceful, reformist transition towards socialism. Though this was in line with a general rightward turn in the official communist parties following the Second World War, it would eventually be repudiated amidst the Soviet-Yugoslav split.

From 1949 to 1953, he was the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. After the arrest of the minister, Georg Dertinger, Ackermann succeeded him, briefly, as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

In 1953–1954, he was expelled from the Politburo and Central Committee and fired as minister because of his factional opposition to party leader Walter Ulbricht.

In 1956 he was rehabilitated and worked for the State Planning Bureau.

In 1970 he was rewarded with the Honor Clasp of the Patriotic Order of Merit. Ill with cancer, he committed suicide in 1973.

<doc id="1214575" wikidata="Q124853" url="?curid=1214575" title="David Johnson (footballer, born 1951)">
<text>David Edward Johnson (23 October 1951 – 23 November 2022) was an English professional footballer and manager who played as a forward and won major trophies for Liverpool in the 1970s and 1980s. He also played for Ipswich Town, Everton and other clubs, as well as the England national team.

==Career==

===Everton===
Johnson signed for Liverpool rivals Everton as a youngster and after showing his ability in early matches, Liverpool manager Bill Shankly pestered Everton counterpart Harry Catterick to sell the young striker, but was rebuffed.

Johnson made his Everton debut as a 19-year-old on 8 January 1971 in a 2–2 league draw with Burnley at Turf Moor. Later on in 1971 Johnson scored in a Merseyside derby game for Everton.

===Ipswich Town===
Johnson joined Bobby Robson&#x27;s Ipswich Town in the November 1972 swapping for Ipswich&#x27;s top goalscorer, Rod Belfitt (and £40,000). He made his Ipswich debut on 4 November 1972 at Portman Road in a 2–2 draw with Leeds United. His first goal for the club came on 2 December the same year in the 1–1 draw with Manchester City at Maine Road. By the end of his first season Johnson had helped Ipswich to the Texaco Cup final where they met East Anglian derby rivals Norwich City. After the two legged final Ipswich emerged victorious, winning 4–2 on aggregate by winning both legs 2–1.

The following season Ipswich drew Spanish giants Real Madrid in the first round of the UEFA Cup. Ipswich beat their illustrious counterparts by a goal to nil at home and held Real to a goalless draw at the Bernabéu in front of 80,000 supporters. In the next round Italian side S.S. Lazio. 4–0 down with just 20 minutes remaining, Johnson had the ball when Giancarlo Oddi went to close him down. Oddi then put in a waist high challenge which left Johnson in a heap on the ground holding his groin. Johnson had to be stretchered off and missed the following three fixtures as a consequence.

Johnson returned from the injury for the return leg in Rome and took up his place on the bench. He watched as Lazio scored early and then again before half-time. A penalty was despatched by Colin Viljoen for Ipswich. Lazio then scored two more goals to put the tie back in the balance. In the 88th minute with the score 5–4 on aggregate, Robson turned to Johnson. With virtually his first touch he scored the goal that would finally settle the tie in Ipswich&#x27;s favour. Ipswich beat Dutch side FC Twente in the next round but went out in the quarter-finals to East German side Locomotiv Leipzig 4–3 on penalties after the sides had drawn 1–1 during normal and extra time.

Johnson scored 35 goals in his four seasons at the club as a battling, play-linking forward forging a productive partnership with Trevor Whymark. It was during his time at Ipswich that Johnson was called up by Don Revie for his first cap for England. He made his debut in a British Home Championship match at Wembley on 21 May 1975. Wales were the visitors with the game ending 2–2 with Johnson scoring both the goals. He also scored twice in a 3–1 victory over world champions Argentina at Wembley, a game which saw the first appearance in England of Diego Maradona. Johnson was in Ron Greenwood&#x27;s squad for the 1980 European Championships but found himself behind Garry Birtles and the man that replaced him at Ipswich Paul Mariner. He won eight caps scoring six times in those appearances.

In 1976 Tottenham Hotspur put in an unsuccessful bid for around £200,000 for Johnson did not want to move. However, after 137 league appearances for Ipswich he returned to Merseyside.

===Liverpool===
Johnson signed for Liverpool for a club record fee of £200,000. He made his debut for the club on 21 August 1976 in a 1–0 league win over Norwich at Anfield. He scored his first goal a week later on the 28th, but his goal was not enough to prevent Birmingham City beating Liverpool 2–1 at St Andrews.

In his first season, he was a frequent substitute, vying for the right to partner Kevin Keegan with both John Toshack and David Fairclough. In his debut season Liverpool were chasing an historic treble of League championship, FA Cup and European Cup as the season drew to a close.

Johnson picked up his first domestic honour with the League title and was selected as Keegan&#x27;s strike partner for the 1977 FA Cup Final at Wembley, but Liverpool lost 2–1 to Manchester United. Johnson made little impact and was substituted by Ian Callaghan in the second half.

For the 1977 European Cup final against Borussia Mönchengladbach in Rome three days later, manager Bob Paisley kept the team that had ended the match at Wembley, so Callaghan started and Johnson was on the bench. He picked up a medal as Liverpool won 3–1.

In April 1978, Johnson scored for Liverpool in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park – becoming the very first player to score for both clubs in the Merseyside derby. As of 2018, only one other player – Peter Beardsley – has achieved this feat since.

In 1979 and 1980 Johnson was a free-scoring centre forward as Liverpool regained and then retained the title, and in 1981 he played as Liverpool won their third European Cup (against Real Madrid in the final) and their first League Cup (against West Ham United). However, a sign of things to come was in that first League Cup success. After the first game at Wembley ended 1–1, Johnson was on the bench for the replay because of Paisley&#x27;s decision to try out the young Ian Rush. Rush did not score but played well, and the following year he was the regular partner to Kenny Dalglish with Johnson being used less frequently.

Johnson did enough to win a final league championship medal in 1982 and also won the League Cup again, after getting the substitute&#x27;s jersey for the final (against Tottenham Hotspur).

===Return to Everton and loan to Barnsley===
Johnson returned to Everton in August 1982 for £100,000. He did not see out his second season at Goodison after initially being loaned to Barnsley.

===Later career===
Johnson ended the 1983–84 season at Manchester City before spending the summer at American side Tulsa Roughnecks in the NASL. His last season of senior football was played at Preston North End. He then had a spell as player manager at Barrow AFC.

==After playing==
Johnson worked at Anfield, hosting in the corporate lounges. He could also be heard regularly on BBC Radio Merseyside as both a match summariser and also a regular contributor to the station&#x27;s &quot;Red Alert&quot; programme aired on Fridays at 7.30 pm where he provided what was known during the show as &quot;The Doc&#x27;s Diagnosis&quot;.

Johnson died of throat cancer on 23 November 2022, at the age of 71.

<text>The threshold limit value (TLV) is a level of occupational exposure to a hazardous substance where it is believed that nearly all healthy workers can repeatedly experience at or below this level of exposure without adverse effects. Strictly speaking, TLV is a reserved term of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), who determines and publishes TLVs annually. TLVs issued by the ACGIH are the most widely accepted occupational exposure limits both in the United States and most other countries. However, it is sometimes loosely used to refer to other similar concepts used in occupational health and toxicology, such as acceptable daily intake (ADI) and tolerable daily intake (TDI). Concepts such as TLV, ADI, and TDI can be compared to the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in animal testing, but whereas a NOAEL can be established experimentally during a short period, TLV, ADI, and TDI apply to human beings over a lifetime and thus are harder to test empirically and are usually set at lower levels. TLVs, along with biological exposure indices (BEIs), are published annually by the ACGIH.

The TLV is an estimate based on the known toxicity in humans or animals of a given chemical substance, and the reliability and accuracy of the latest sampling and analytical methods. TLVs do not take into account financial or technical feasibility for application in the workplace, instead solely focusing on health based recommendations to prevent adverse health effects. It is also not a static value, since new research can often modify the risk assessment of substances, and new laboratory or instrumental analysis methods can improve analytical detection limits. 

The TLV is a recommendation by ACGIH, with only a guideline status. As such, it should not be confused with exposure limits having a regulatory status, like those published and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA). However, many OSHA exposure limits are not considered by the industrial hygiene community to be sufficiently protective levels since the toxicological basis for most limits have not been updated since the 1960s. OSHA acknowledges this and recommends supplementing regulatory standards with alternative updated and stricter standards, &quot;even when the exposure levels are in compliance with the relevant PELs&quot;, while specifically mentioning the TLV as one such standard.

== History ==
Many people accredit the idea of government responsibility for the protection of its workers in the workplace to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Great Depression era. The formation of the National Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (later to be renamed the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists) in 1938 was a direct response to this idea. 

Although the first meeting of the ACGIH was held in 1938, the first exposure limits of the group were not published until 1946, then referred to as Maximum Allowable Concentrations. These standards were split into 4 categories: Gasses and Vapors, Toxic Dusts, Fumes, and Mists, Mineral Dusts, and Radiations.

In 1970, the US Occupational Health and Safety Act was signed into law, which created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Shortly after this law passed, OSHA implemented its first Permissible Exposure Limits, which were adopted directly from the 1968 ACGIH TLVs. 

In 2008, the Sustainable TLV/BEI fund was created to allow for the continued financial support of the development of TLVs and BEIs. This fund provides &quot;additional opportunities for raising funds to support and sustain the core mission and value of developing and promoting occupational exposure guidelines.&quot; This fund ensures that TLVs and BEIs will continue to have the necessary financial support to be created and revised in order to provide up-to-date standards. 

== Definitions of TLV ==
The TLV for chemical substances is defined as a concentration in air, typically for inhalation or skin exposure. Its units are in parts per million (ppm) for gases and in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) for particulates such as dust, smoke and mist. The basic formula for converting between ppm and mg/m3 for gases is ppm = (mg/m^3) * 24.45 / molecular weight. This formula is not applicable to airborne particles.

The four categories of TLVs for chemical substances are defined:
# Threshold limit value − time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): The average exposure on the basis of a 8 hours per day, 40 hours per week work schedule.
# Threshold limit value − short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): A 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA.
# Threshold limit value - surface limit (TLV-SL): Supplements airborne TLVs by establishing a concentration on a surface that is not likely to cause an adverse effect due to direct or indirect contact.
# Threshold limit value − ceiling limit (TLV-C): An absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

There are TLVs for physical agents as well as chemical substances. TLVs for physical agents include those for noise exposure, vibration, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation exposure and heat and cold stress.

== Defining acceptable exposure==
The TLV and most other occupational exposure limits are based on available toxicology and epidemiology data to protect nearly all workers over a working lifetime. Exposure assessments in occupational settings are most often performed by Occupational / Industrial Hygiene (OH/IH) professionals who gather &quot;Basic Characterization&quot; consisting of all relevant information and data related to workers, agents of concern, materials, equipment and available exposure controls. The exposure assessment is initiated by selecting the appropriate exposure limit averaging time and &quot;decision statistic&quot; for the agent. Typically the statistic for deciding acceptable exposure is chosen to be the majority (90%, 95% or 99%) of all exposures to be below the selected occupational exposure limit. For retrospective exposure assessments performed in occupational environments, the &quot;decision statistic&quot; is typically a central tendency such as the mean or geometric mean or median for each worker or group of workers. Methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in &quot;A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock&quot;.

== TLV Development Process ==
The process for developing a new or updated TLVs follows a specific process that allows for adequate analysis of available research and feedback from exposure scientists around the world. The process also allows for opportunities at each step for the TLV to be withdrawn from consideration due to lack of available data or other reasons. The process adheres to the following steps:

# Substance Under Study: When a substance or agent has been proposed for a new or updated TLV or BEI, it is placed under a list of possible candidates in this step. These substances can be submitted for review by the public to the several committees in ACGIH, who then determine if they are eligible to be placed on the &quot;under study&quot; list. This list is available to the public.
# Draft Documentation: Once a substance has been accepted to the Under Study list, the process of collecting relevant studies and research is collected. This allows for the designated committee to develop a draft with these studies and a proposed TLV or BEI. This is then reviewed by other committee and eventually the full committee. If passed, the proposed TLV moves to step 3.
# Notice of Intended Changes and Notice of Intent to Establish: After the full committee has approved a potential TLV or BEI with its relevant research, it is presented to the ACGIH Board of Directors for ratification. If approved, it is published as a Notice of Intended Changes or Notice of Intent to Establish, where other parties are invited to submit relevant feedback. If data is introduced that may impact the proposed TLV/BEI, the proposal may be revised or withdrawn.
# Adoption: If there is no data or feedback presented that indicates a necessary change in the proposed TLV or BEI, it is adopted and published in the annual TLV/BEI documentation.

<text>The Bellona Foundation is an international environmental NGO headquartered in Oslo, Norway, with branches in Europe and North America. Founded in 1986 by Frederic Hauge and Rune Haaland as a direct action protest group to curb Norway&#x27;s oil and gas industry pollution, it grew to be multi-disciplinary and multinational in scope and maintains offices in Oslo, Brussels, Berlin and Vilnius. In 2022, Bellona ended activities in Russia and relocated experts to the Vilnius, Lithuania office to assist Ukraine with environmental challenges resulting from the Russian invasion. In 2023, the Russian Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office recognized Bellona as an &quot;undesirable organization&quot;.

Bellona works with ecologists, engineers, economists, attorneys, journalists, specialists in the natural and social sciences, to accomplish its objectives.

== History ==

In 1994, the Bellona Foundation&#x27;s report &quot;Sources of Radioactive Contamination in Murmansk
and Archangel Counties&quot; raised serious concerns about the safety of the decommissioned Soviet nuclear-powered submarines after the dissolution of the USSR. In February 1996, Russian FSB arrested Bellona&#x27;s Russian expert Alexander Nikitin, a former Soviet naval officer, and charged him with treason through espionage for his contributions to Bellona&#x27;s report on the nuclear safety within the Russian Northern Fleet. The Russian Supreme Court exonerated him in 2000.

In 2003, Bellona accessed radioactive contamination at Sellafield nuclear reprocessing facility in England.

At the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15) in Copenhagen, Bellona presented &quot;101 Solutions to Climate Change&quot;.

In 2013, Bellona Foundation filed a police report after it learned that a &quot;disposal well in the Norwegian Sea owned by Norway’s state oil company Statoil leaked 3,428 tons of hazardous chemicals and oil-based drilling fluids over six years at the Njord site&quot;.

In April 2023, Russia declared Bellona as an &quot;undesirable&quot; organization.

== Funding ==

Bellona&#x27;s yearly spending was 25 million Norwegian Kroner (NOK) in 2001. Amongst the sources: 10 million NOK came from selling advertisements; 6 million NOK was received from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for projects in Russia, and 1 million NOK was received from the Norwegian government for general purposes; 6 million NOK was received from business sector to implement the B7 program; 2 million NOK came from donations and gifts.

== Criticism ==

In Norway, the Bellona Foundation was criticized for &quot;seeking publicity&quot;, and in Russia — for accepting funds from the Norwegian government. Some maintain that Bellona damaged its environmental credibility by &quot;cooperating with market agents&quot;, transforming it into more of a consultancy for private companies than an environmental NGO.

<doc id="1214585" wikidata="Q4380302" url="?curid=1214585" title="Curse of Billy Penn">
<text>The Curse of Billy Penn (1987–2008) was a sports-related curse, urban legend, and popular explanation for the failure of major Philadelphia professional sports teams to win championships following the March 1987 construction of the One Liberty Place skyscraper, which exceeded the height of William Penn&#x27;s statue atop Philadelphia City Hall. For decades prior to the construction of One Liberty Place, there had been a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement in place to ensure that no building in Philadelphia would be permitted to be higher than the William Penn statue atop Philadelphia City Hall.

The curse ended on October 29, 2008, when the Philadelphia Phillies won the 2008 World Series, a year and four months after a statuette of the William Penn figure atop City Hall was affixed to the final beam during the June 2007 topping-off of the Comcast Center, which made it the highest building structure in the city at the time.

==Origins==
Atop Philadelphia City Hall stands a statue of William Penn, the city founder and original proprietor of the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania. For decades, a &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; stated that the Philadelphia Art Commission would approve no building in the city which would rise above this statue. This ended in March 1987, when a modern steel-and-glass skyscraper, One Liberty Place, opened three blocks away. One Liberty Place is taller than City Hall by , rising in height compared to the height of Penn&#x27;s hat on City Hall, . Its sister skyscraper, Two Liberty Place, at , followed in 1990.

Philadelphia sports teams had previously enjoyed a run of success in the years prior to the construction and opening of One Liberty Place. Major League Baseball&#x27;s Phillies won the 1980 World Series and the 1983 National League pennant; the National Hockey League&#x27;s Flyers won back-to-back Stanley Cups in and , and appeared in the finals in , , , and ; the National Football League&#x27;s Eagles appeared in Super Bowl XV following the 1980 season, losing to the Oakland Raiders; and the National Basketball Association&#x27;s 76ers swept the 1983 NBA Finals, as well as making the finals in , , and . Before 1980, the Phillies had appeared in only two other World Series, in and , and the Eagles had won no NFC conference championships since the 1966 agreement that had created the Super Bowl, while the 76ers won NBA titles in both Philadelphia and in their previous incarnation, the Syracuse Nationals. The Villanova Wildcats won the 1985 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in one of the most famous upsets in sports history.

Construction on One Liberty Place began in 1985, two years after the last championship season in Philadelphia.

==Philadelphia sports since curse&#x27;s inception==
=== Major-league sports===

 opened, Philadelphia&#x27;s franchises began a pattern of failures to win a world championship. The Flyers lost the Stanley Cup Finals twice, in to the Edmonton Oilers in seven games (although the Oilers were heavily favored), two months after One Liberty Place opened, and in , in a four-game sweep by the Detroit Red Wings which was considered a collapse as the Flyers had home-ice advantage and had dominated the previous three playoff series en route to meeting the Red Wings. The Phillies upset the Atlanta Braves to win the NLCS, but then lost the 1993 World Series in six games to the Toronto Blue Jays, with the Series ending on Joe Carter&#x27;s walk-off 3-run home run. The 76ers lost the 2001 NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games, although the defending champion Lakers were favored despite the Sixers having league MVP Allen Iverson. The Eagles lost three straight NFC Championship games from the 2001 through 2003 seasons, before reaching Super Bowl XXXIX after the 2004 season, only to lose to the New England Patriots by three points.

In fact, the only years that Philadelphia&#x27;s franchises reached their league&#x27;s championship round after One Liberty Place opened were years of presidential inaugurations, except for the Flyers in 1987, and losses during such years date back to the 76ers loss in . When the Flyers played for the 2010 Stanley Cup, &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot; reported that the main reason for that lengthy championship drought was because the only years the city&#x27;s teams played for championships during that time were years presidents were inaugurated. The city&#x27;s teams had lost championships during such years, beginning with the 76ers themselves in . The exceptions were the Phillies in and , the Eagles in 2023, and the Flyers in .

In addition, losses in semifinal rounds had occurred ten times since the opening of One Liberty Place. Five of these semifinal eliminations were by the Flyers, in 1989, 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2008. The 2000 team was one win away from a Stanley Cup Finals appearance, after leading the eventual champion New Jersey Devils 3–1 before losing three straight (including Games 5 and 7 at home), the 2004 team lost Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning, and the 2008 team lost to their cross-state rival Pittsburgh Penguins in five games. The Eagles accounted for the other three conference-final losses; they lost the NFC Championship Game (the winner of which meets the winner of the AFC&#x27;s corresponding game in the Super Bowl) three years in a row from to , thus becoming the first NFL team to do this in either conference since the Dallas Cowboys of –, losing the last two at home after posting the best record in the NFC. No other team in NFL history had lost back-to-back conference title games at home since the NFL began its practice in 1975 of awarding home-field advantage in postseason play based on regular-season record. The Eagles lost the 2001 NFC Championship game on the road to the St. Louis Rams 29–24, the 2002 NFC Championship game at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27–10, and the 2003 NFC Championship game to the Carolina Panthers 14–3. The Rams and Panthers would both lose to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XXXVIII, while the Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII over the Oakland Raiders.

===Other sports===

The curse was also said to have affected racehorses from the Philadelphia area, such as the Bensalem-Township-based thoroughbred racehorse Smarty Jones, who saw his bid for horse racing&#x27;s Triple Crown disappear when he finished second in the 2004 Belmont Stakes behind 36-1 longshot Birdstone after victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. The curse has also been blamed for the death of the thoroughbred horse Barbaro, who was born and raised in the Philadelphia area and was owned and bred by a couple from West Grove, a borough right outside Philadelphia. Though Barbaro won the 2006 Kentucky Derby, his leg was dramatically shattered two weeks later during the 2006 Preakness Stake, leading to the horse&#x27;s death.

Although the curse was not generally considered as extending to college sports, two Philadelphia-area college basketball teams, the St. Joseph&#x27;s Hawks (in Philadelphia) and the Villanova Wildcats (in Villanova), which had successful seasons in 2004 and 2006, respectively, failed to reach the Final Four of the NCAA basketball tournament. Both were eliminated in the fourth-round Elite Eight matches, with St. Joe&#x27;s, first seed in the East Regional, losing in a close match to Oklahoma State, and Villanova, first seed in the Minneapolis Regional, falling to eventual NCAA-champion Florida. Villanova won the national championship in 1985, two years before the Liberty Place opening. A third Philadelphia-area team, the Temple Owls (in Philadelphia) has also lost five times in the Elite Eight (1988, 1991, 1993, 1999, 2001).

Villanova ended the college basketball drought for the Philadelphia teams with a national championship in 2016 and 2018.

The curse, however, was apparently not extended to professional teams outside the four major sports. The then–Philadelphia Wings of the NLL (indoor lacrosse winter league) won six titles between 1989 and 2001, before moving in 2014, and the now-defunct Philadelphia Barrage of the MLL, an outdoor summer lacrosse league, won three championships (2004, 2006, and 2007). The AHL&#x27;s Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers&#x27; top minor-league affiliate from 1996 to 2009, won the Calder Cup championship in 1998 and 2005. Additionally, the Philadelphia KiXX of the MISL won their league&#x27;s championship in 2002 and 2007. The AFL&#x27;s Philadelphia Soul won ArenaBowl XXII in 2008, ArenaBowl XXIX in 2016, and ArenaBowl XXX in 2017 before the league folded in 2019. The Philadelphia Freedoms, a tennis team in the World Team Tennis league, also won titles in 2001 and 2006. One exception was the Philadelphia Charge, a women&#x27;s soccer team in the now-defunct WUSA, which did not win a championship during the three years the WUSA existed, from 2001 to 2003.

==Decoration of Penn&#x27;s statue==
In spite of the Curse, when Philadelphia sports teams have reached their league&#x27;s championship round, Penn&#x27;s statue has sometimes been decorated to support that team&#x27;s success. After the Phillies won the 1993 National League pennant, for instance, Penn was fitted with an oversized red Phillies baseball cap; when the Flyers went to the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals, the city adorned Penn with an orange-torso-with-white-shoulders Flyers jersey, representing the Flyers&#x27; road jersey.

When the Sixers faced the Lakers in the 2001 NBA Finals, Penn&#x27;s statue was not decorated. Pat Croce, president and part-owner of the Sixers, said he would have &quot;decked out&quot; the statue had the Sixers won but not before. Penn&#x27;s statue was also left untouched when the Eagles went to Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005.

==The Curse lifted==

On June 18, 2007, ironworkers helped raise the final beam in the construction of the Comcast Center at 17th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard in Center City Philadelphia. In an attempt to end the curse, workers John Joyce and Dan Ginion attached a small figurine of William Penn to the beam, along with the traditional American flag and small evergreen tree.

After the first William Penn figurine was stolen, it was replaced with a smaller 4-inch figure.

On October 29, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies won the 2008 World Series in five games against the Tampa Bay Rays, ending the purported curse. It was the first major league professional sports title for the city of Philadelphia since the 1983 NBA Championship. During the TV coverage of the parade which occurred two days later, Comcast aired an ad congratulating the Phillies which featured the small figurine of William Penn standing at the top of the Comcast Center.

On November 27, 2017, the day of the &quot;topping out&quot; of the new tallest building in Philadelphia, the Comcast Technology Center, ironworkers once again placed a new William Penn figurine atop the building&#x27;s highest beam in hopes of warding off the curse.

On February 4, 2018, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII 41–33 to win their first Super Bowl in team history, and first championship since the 1960 NFL Championship Game. The Eagles would go on to win their second Super Bowl on February 9, 2025 when they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX, 40–22, avenging their loss to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII two years prior and ending the Presidential Inauguration Curse

<doc id="1214587" wikidata="Q16997510" url="?curid=1214587" title="Mediarts Records">
<text>Mediarts Records was a small record label founded by former Capitol Records executive Alan W. Livingston and producer Nik Venet.

The label&#x27;s first release was Dory Previn with &quot;On My Way To Where&quot; (1970). Other artists signed on the label were Don McLean, Spencer Davis and Peter Jameson, Paul Anka, Odia Coates, Bill Conti, Hello People, and Gerry Rafferty. The most successful album on Mediarts was the comedy album &quot;The Begatting of the President&quot;, narrated by Orson Welles.

The label was acquired by United Artists Records. The albums by McLean, Previn and Welles were reissued on UA. The acquisition was beneficial for UA as Anka, Coates, Conti and Rafferty had yet to issue albums for Mediarts, but would enjoy hits for UA. McLean had the megahit single and album &quot;American Pie&quot; for UA.

The Mediarts catalog is now owned by Universal Music Group through its 2012 purchase of most assets and properties possessed by EMI, which in turn purchased UA Records and, going full circle, is managed by Capitol Records.

The first 45 rpm single released on the Mediarts record label was ME-100, &quot;Earth Song&quot;/&quot;Everybody Has Been Burned&quot; by Sioux City Zoo, a group from Fresno, California.

<text>Captain John Henry Cound Brunt, (6 December 1922 – 10 December 1944) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He served in the Italian campaign during the Second World War and was twice decorated for bravery in action before he was killed by mortar fire the day after his VC action.

==Early life==
John Henry Cound Brunt was born on 6 December 1922, on a farm in Priest Weston, near Chirbury, Shropshire to Thomas Henry Brunt and Nesta Mary Brunt (née Cound), and began his education at Chirbury village school. He had an elder sister named Dorothy (born 13 May 1920) and a younger sister, Isobel (born 5 October 1923). When Dorothy was eight, the family moved to a farm near Whittington, Shropshire, where John grew up. As he became older, his fearless nature became more apparent; every week, he read the comic &quot;Tiny Tots&quot;, which featured instructions on &quot;How to teach yourself to swim&quot;. One day, he asked Dorothy to take him to the Shropshire Canal, which went through their farmland. Before his sister could stop him, Brunt had taken off all his clothes and jumped into the canal. When they finally arrived home, their mother wanted to know why he had no clothes on, and John responded that he had been teaching himself to swim. As he got older, his daredevil attitude became even more serious; on one occasion, he was found swinging himself along the guttering of a Dutch barn above the farmyard.

After attending the village school in Welsh Frankton, Brunt was enrolled at Ellesmere College, where his mischievous streak became quickly apparent through pranks and dares; once, while in the sanatorium with mumps, he slipped a laxative into the matron&#x27;s tea. Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school. It was while he was at Ellesmere that he contracted measles, resulting in his need to wear glasses. An enthusiastic sportsman, Brunt played cricket, hockey, rugby, water polo and wrestling. He was the only pupil at the school to tackle the headmaster while playing rugby, injuring the older man&#x27;s knee in the process.

In 1934, the Brunt family moved to Paddock Wood in Kent and, in his school holidays, &quot;Young John&quot; (as he was known in the village) would come home. Although he was still a reckless individual, he was thought of very highly, and helped train the Paddock Wood Home Guard between 1940 and 1943, assisted by his father. He spent his last days in Paddock Wood helping with the hop harvest.

==Military career==
Brunt joined the British Army when he left school, training as a private soldier with the Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment in 1941, during the Second World War. He received a commission as a second lieutenant on 2 January 1943, and was posted to North Africa. Although he was commissioned in the Sherwood Foresters, he never served with them, instead being posted to the 6th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment (6th Lincolns), a Territorial Army (TA) unit, having become friendly with Captain Alan Money, an officer in the Lincolns, on the boat to North Africa. The battalion was part of the 138th Infantry Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division. The division was then commanded by Major General John Hawkesworth.

On 9 September 1943, Brunt&#x27;s battalion landed at Salerno as part of the Allied invasion of Italy and Brunt, now a lieutenant, was given command of No.9 Platoon in &#x27;A&#x27; Company. The unit subsequently moved south-east to establish a base on a farm near the river Asa.

===Military Cross===
Between December 1943 and January 1944, during the Bernhardt Line fighting, Brunt commanded a battle patrol and saw near-constant action. In the early hours of 15 December, they received orders to destroy an enemy post based in some houses north of the River Peccia. In efforts to break the enemy line, he crossed and re-crossed the river so many times that the troops took to calling it &quot;Brunt&#x27;s Brook&quot;. After an intense five-minute bombardment, Brunt led a section into an assault. The first two houses contained two enemy soldiers, but it was the third house that provided the most resistance. Using grenades and Tommy guns, they managed to kill eight enemy troops outside the house, as well as those inside, all belonging to the 1st Battalion, 2nd Hermann Goering Panzer Grenadier Regiment. After thirty minutes of intense fighting, the patrol withdrew, having had one man killed and six wounded. While the rest of the section pulled back, Brunt remained behind with his sergeant and a private to retrieve a wounded soldier. For his actions, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC).

On 5 January 1944, Brunt was in a sick bed in a rear hospital. He pleaded with doctors to be allowed to leave to take part in an attack, and was given permission, leading his patrol under heavy fire. He was back in the hospital 24 hours later with concussion after a piece of shrapnel almost split his helmet, but would have carried on fighting if it had not been for a non-commissioned officer (NCO), who forcibly led him away from the front line. At the end of the campaign, Brunt is said to have commented to his friends, &quot;I&#x27;ve won the MC, now for the VC!&quot;

===Victoria Cross===
Brunt&#x27;s division left Italy in March 1944, and was sent to Syria and Egypt to rest and retrain, before returning to Italy in July 1944. Having been promoted to temporary captain, Brunt was appointed second-in-command (2IC) of &#x27;D&#x27; Company. By early December 1944, after being engaged in heavy fighting in the Gothic Line offensive, the battalion was operating near Ravenna, fighting German troops who were retreating north through Italy. On the night of 3 December, the battalion began their attack on the city of Faenza. By the evening of 6 December, they had taken the village of Ragazzina near Faenza, and after heavy fighting, the 6th Lincolns established defensive positions in Faenza itself. For his actions during the engagement, Brunt was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The full citation for the award appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 6 February 1945, reading:

The next morning, having won the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager to return to the offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being prepared for the men, their first meal in 48 hours. He was standing in the doorway of the platoon headquarters, having a mug of tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright. He had celebrated his 22nd birthday just four days before.

John Brunt is buried at Faenza War Cemetery in Italy under a Commonwealth War Grave headstone; his VC was announced posthumously in February 1945.

==Victoria Cross presentation==
On 18 December 1945, King George VI presented Brunt&#x27;s VC and MC to his parents at Buckingham Palace. Brunt&#x27;s father met Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI, later redesignated 15th Army Group) throughout most of the Italian Campaign, at the ceremony and said to him &quot;I expect that you know many men who should have been awarded this medal&quot;, to which Alexander replied &quot;No, because there is always only one who will do the unexpected and that day it was your son.&quot;

==Legacy==

In 1946, John Brunt&#x27;s sister Dorothy gave birth to a boy which she named John Brunt Miller, in honour of his uncle.

On 3 September 1947 the Kent Arms public house in Paddock Wood, Kent, was renamed the John Brunt V.C. in his honour. In 1997, the pub&#x27;s name was changed to The Hopping Hooden Horse; after local outrage, the former name was restored in 2001. Behind the pub, a small housing development called John Brunt VC Court was built. The rose window at the west end of St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Paddock Wood was designed by Joan Howson in memory of Brunt. 

During his military career, Brunt was awarded the VC, MC, 1939-45 Star, Africa Star, Italy Star and the British War Medal 1939–1945, all of which are on display in the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment and Lincolnshire Yeomanry Collections in the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in Lincoln. In 1951 an altar rail in the Soldiers&#x27; Chapel of St George in Lincoln Cathedral was dedicated to his memory by the regiment.

On 17 July 1965 &quot;The Victor&quot; comic featured a cover story named &quot;Brunt V.C.&quot;, a two-page strip based on the actions that won Brunt the VC.

A John Brunt Memorial Cricket Pavilion was opened at Ellesmere College in 1970, after funds were raised for it since 1945. The college&#x27;s ante-chapel holds a photograph of Brunt, with a copy of his VC citation displayed below.

In May 2004 an outdoor plaque to his memory was unveiled in Priestweston.

<text>Jet Records was a British record label started by Don Arden in 1974, featuring musicians such as Lynsey de Paul, Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), Roy Wood, Gary Moore, Ozzy Osbourne, Alan Price, Adrian Gurvitz, Riot, Magnum and Trickster.

==History==
The first release on the Jet Records label was the single &quot;No, Honestly&quot; which was a UK top 10 for its singer and writer Lynsey de Paul in November 1974. It was followed by the de Paul album, &quot;Taste Me... Don&#x27;t Waste Me&quot;. De Paul wrote the second single on the Jet label, a song called &quot;My One and Only&quot; recorded by the British female vocal group &#x27;Bones&#x27;. The fourth single released on the label, &quot;My Man and Me&quot;, was written and performed by de Paul and it was the second UK hit single released on Jet Records. De Paul released a second album entitled &quot;Love Bomb&quot;, before leaving the label in 1976 after an acrimonious split with Arden, resulting in her third Jet
album &quot;Take Your Time&quot; (originally entitled &quot;Before You Go Tonight&quot;) being unreleased.

ELO were managed by Arden from the band&#x27;s inception in 1972. They were initially signed to Harvest Records (a division of EMI) in the UK and United Artists Records in the US. Roy Wood left ELO in 1972 and formed his own group, Wizzard. During 1973 and 1974, ELO and Wizzard moved from the Harvest label to Warner Bros. Records in the UK. In 1975, the two bands and Wood&#x27;s solo releases moved again in the UK to Jet, with their recent Warner Bros. material becoming part of Jet&#x27;s catalogue. David Carradine&#x27;s solo album &quot;Grasshopper&quot; had the collaboration of ELO&#x27;s cellist Hugh McDowell and violinist Mik Kaminski.

In the UK, Jet Records were distributed first by Island Records in 1974-75, then by Polydor Records from 1975 to 1976, then by United Artists from 1976 to 1978. In the US, a small Jet logo started appearing on the United Artists label in 1975 for releases by ELO and Wood. The Jet label was first used in the US for Jeff Lynne&#x27;s solo single &quot;Doin&#x27; That Crazy Thing&quot; in the summer of 1977 and subsequently for the ELO album &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;.

Wood left Jet Records and disbanded Wizzard in 1976, after Jet refused to release Wizzard&#x27;s third album &quot;Wizzo&quot;, because it was not deemed commercial enough. His final single on the Jet label was &quot;Any Old Time Will Do&quot;.

After Jet&#x27;s UK distribution moved to United Artists (UA) in 1976, UA were distributing Jet Records in most countries of the world. This changed after American copies of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; that were deemed defective, began appearing at discounted prices in record shops in the US and Canada affecting the album&#x27;s sales. Jet sued UA and abruptly switched their distribution to CBS Records worldwide early in 1978.

By this time ELO had become one of the most popular bands in the world, and Jet reissued ELO&#x27;s back catalogue albums and some new singles in many different colours of vinyl. Many members of ELO also released solo albums or singles on Jet in the late 1970s. In 1980, ELO contributed half the music to the motion picture &quot;Xanadu&quot;, with the other half of the music being provided by the film&#x27;s star Olivia Newton-John. Newton-John was signed to MCA Records whose sister company Universal was producing the movie. The &quot;Xanadu&quot; soundtrack and all its singles by both ELO and Newton-John were released on MCA Records in the USA and Canada, and on Jet Records elsewhere in the world.

Black Sabbath were also managed by Don Arden, but they were never signed to Jet Records. However, when their singer Ozzy Osbourne left the band, he was signed to Jet. Two studio albums and one live album by Osbourne were released on Jet. Arden&#x27;s daughter Sharon, who was working for her father, started dating Osbourne and eventually married him. Sharon took over managing Osbourne from her father, and Osbourne left Jet to go to the Epic label of Jet&#x27;s distributor CBS.

Osbourne&#x27;s defection along with ELO becoming less popular in the early 1980s contributed to Jet experiencing financial difficulties. Legal problems encountered by Don Arden, and his son David, further strained Jet&#x27;s resources. ELO&#x27;s recording contract and back catalogue were sold by Jet to CBS in 1985. Initial copies of ELO&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Balance of Power&quot; were pressed on the Jet label in some European countries aswell as a small handful of other countries, but this mistake was corrected by CBS, and the album was then issued throughout Europe on its Epic label. American reissues by CBS of ELO&#x27;s 1972 to 1983 albums continued to show the Jet logo until 1990. ELO&#x27;s back catalog is now handled by Sony&#x27;s Legacy Recordings (except the Harvest albums, handled by Warner Music Group under the Parlophone label).

Jet carried on in a diminished capacity in the late 1980s. Roy Wood returned to the label in 1987 to release the single &quot;1-2-3&quot;. Just before closure, the label released &quot;Live at Fairfield Halls&quot; by Bucks Fizz, a group the label had previously had no connection with.

1989 shows the final JET Release under CBS distribution, with the Dan Priest produced LP/CD &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; by BTB (US CD: JET ZK 44410; UK LP: JET 465089-1).

In 1991, Bagdasarian Productions (owners of The Chipmunks) bought the production company offices and holdings from Arden, and reopened the record label Jet Records under the new name Chipmunk Records.

In 1996, Jet released The Fall&#x27;s album &quot;The Light User Syndrome&quot; and the single The Chiselers.

Some of Jet&#x27;s back catalogue has appeared in reissues or compilations in the 1990s and 2000s, on labels such as Edsel Records and Sanctuary Records, including the previously unreleased third Wizzard album, retitled &quot;Main Street&quot;. The third album that Lynsey de Paul recorded for Jet in 1976 &quot;Take Your Time&quot; also but was never released finally appeared on CD in Japan with the title &quot;Before You Go Tonight&quot; on the Vivid Sound Corporation label in 1990. De Paul finally recovered the rights to her songs recorded for Jet Records and many of them were released on her 2013 anthology albums &quot;Sugar and Beyond&quot; and &quot;Into My Music&quot;.

As of 2020, most of Jet&#x27;s catalogue is owned by BMG Rights Management under its Sanctuary Records label.

He is probably the only VC recipient to have a town and (until May 2004) a local government area named for him. On 24 August 1915, amid a wave of anti-German feeling related to the First World War, the name of the New South Wales Eastern Riverina town of Germanton was changed to Holbrook to honour the recent VC recipient. He subsequently visited the town on three occasions. His widow, Mrs. Gundula Holbrook, donated his medal to the Council of the Shire of Holbrook in 1982. In 1995 she made a substantial donation towards the establishment of a submariners&#x27; memorial in the town, and in 1997 visited the town to unveil it. A bronze statue of Holbrook stands in Germanton Park, Holbrook.
Holbrook&#x27;s medal was donated to the Council of the Shire of Holbrook, New South Wales in 1982. It subsequently passed to Greater Hume Shire Council upon the amalgamation of several Riverina shires in May 2004. Holbrook&#x27;s medal group, including his Victoria Cross, went on display at the Australian War Memorial on 11 December 2009. His medals are on loan from the Greater Hume Shire Council. A replica may be seen at the Submarine Museum, Holbrook.

Holbrook Road in Portsmouth is named after him.

A plaque was erected by the Submariners Association in 2014 on the exterior wall of the Portsmouth Grammar school Junior School facing Cambridge Junction, Portsmouth, UK.

<text>Bob Dwyer AM (born 29 November 1940) is an Australian rugby union coach.

==Early life==

Educated at Sydney Boys High School, from which he graduated in 1957, Dwyer played 2nd XV rugby for the school, lining up alongside former Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks player George Taylforth and St. George Dragons halfback George Evans.

==Career==

Dwyer coached Sydney club Randwick to four Sydney championship wins before becoming Australia&#x27;s national team coach. He coached Australia from 1982–83, and again from 1988-95. He coached Australia to victory at the 1991 Rugby World Cup.

Dwyer moved to Leicester Tigers after the game turned professional in 1996 and replaced Tony Russ. Tigers had immediate success, in 1997 reaching the Heineken Cup final and winning the Pilkington Cup, but finished fourth in the league. Dwyer&#x27;s harsh attitude to the players led to them dubbing him &#x27;Barb Dwyer&#x27; (&#x27;barbed wire&#x27;) and a public spat with one of them, Austin Healey ensued. The club&#x27;s board decided to replace Dwyer with former club captain Dean Richards.

In 1998 Dwyer was appointed head coach of recently relegated Bristol. Under him the club returned to the Premiership at the first time of asking. The next season saw Bristol finish sixth in the top flight and narrowly miss out on qualification for the Heineken Cup. In 2000, Dwyer left Bristol after changes to the club&#x27;s back room staff. In his time at Bristol Dwyer was a forceful advocate for the club&#x27;s potential to be the leading light in English rugby, &quot;the potential here is greater than in any other rugby city in England, including Leicester&quot;.

In 2001 Dwyer returned to Australia and became coach of the New South Wales Waratahs in Super Rugby (at the time known as Super 12). He led the Waratahs to an eighth-place finish in 2001 and their first semi-final in the competition in 2002. He resigned in 2003 after a fifth-place finish but stayed with the New South Wales union as a development officer.

In 2011, he was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame, alongside all other Rugby World Cup-winning head coaches and captains through the 2007 edition.

==Books==

He has written two autobiographies - &quot;The Winning Way&quot; (1992) and &quot;Full Time: A coach&#x27;s Memoirs&quot; (2004). He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1991 and was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2004 for services to rugby union. Dwyer survived a heart attack in 2013.

<doc id="1214601" wikidata="Q1107002" url="?curid=1214601" title="Cognitive walkthrough">
<text>The cognitive walkthrough method is a usability inspection method used to identify usability issues in interactive systems, focusing on how easy it is for new users to accomplish tasks with the system. A cognitive walkthrough is task-specific, whereas heuristic evaluation takes a holistic view to catch problems not caught by this and other usability inspection methods.
The method is rooted in the notion that users typically prefer to learn a system by using it to accomplish tasks, rather than, for example, studying a manual. The method is prized for its ability to generate results quickly with low cost, especially when compared to usability testing, as well as the ability to apply the method early in the design phases before coding even begins (which happens less often with usability testing).

==Introduction==
A cognitive walkthrough starts with a task analysis that specifies the sequence of steps or actions required by a user to accomplish a task, and the system responses to those actions. The designers and developers of the software then walk through the steps as a group, asking themselves a set of questions at each step. Data is gathered during the walkthrough, and afterwards a report of potential issues is compiled. Finally the software is redesigned to address the issues identified.

The effectiveness of methods such as cognitive walkthroughs is hard to measure in applied settings, as there is very limited opportunity for controlled experiments while developing software. Typically measurements involve comparing the number of usability problems found by applying different methods. However, Gray and Salzman called into question the validity of those studies in their dramatic 1998 paper &quot;Damaged Merchandise&quot;, demonstrating how very difficult it is to measure the effectiveness of usability inspection methods. The consensus in the usability community is that the cognitive walkthrough method works well in a variety of settings and applications.

== Streamlined cognitive walkthrough procedure ==
After the task analysis has been made, the participants perform the walkthrough:

# Define inputs to the walkthrough: a usability specialist lays out the scenarios and produces an analysis of said scenarios through explanation of the actions required to accomplish the task.
## Identify users
## Create a sample task for evaluation
## Create action sequences for completing the tasks
## Implementation of interface
# Convene the walkthrough:
## What are the goals of the walkthrough?
## What will be done during the walkthrough
## What will not be done during the walkthrough
## Post ground rules
### Some common ground rules
#### No designing
#### No defending a design
#### No debating cognitive theory
#### The usability specialist is the leader of the session
## Assign roles
## Appeal for submission to leadership
# Walk through the action sequences for each task
## Participants perform the walkthrough by asking themselves a set of questions for each subtask. Typically four questions are as
##* Will the user try to achieve the effect that the subtask has? E.g. Does the user understand that this subtask is needed to reach the user&#x27;s goal
##* Will the user notice that the correct action is available? E.g. is the button visible?
##* Will the user understand that the wanted subtask can be achieved by the action? E.g. the right button is visible but the user does not understand the text and will therefore not click on it.
##* Does the user get appropriate feedback? Will the user know that they have done the right thing after performing the action?
## By answering the questions for each subtask usability problems will be noticed.
# Record any important information
## Learnability problems
## Design ideas and gaps
## Problems with analysis of the task
# Revise the interface using what was learned in the walkthrough to improve the problems.

The CW method does not take several social attributes into account. The method can only be successful if the usability specialist takes care to prepare the team for all possibilities during the cognitive walkthrough. This tends to enhance the ground rules and avoid the pitfalls that come with an ill-prepared team.

==Common shortcomings==
In teaching people to use the walkthrough method, Lewis &amp; Rieman have found that there are two common misunderstandings:
# The evaluator doesn&#x27;t know how to perform the task themself, so they stumble through the interface trying to discover the correct sequence of actions—and then they evaluate the stumbling process. (The user should identify and perform the &quot;optimal&quot; action sequence.)
# The walkthrough method does not test real users on the system. The walkthrough will often identify many more problems than you would find with a single, unique user in a single test session

There are social constraints that inhibit the cognitive walkthrough process. These include time pressure, lengthy design discussions and design defensiveness. Time pressure is caused when design iterations occur late in the development process, when a development team usually feels considerable pressure to actually implement specifications, and may not think they have the time to evaluate them properly. Many developers feel that CW&#x27;s are not efficient because of the amount of time they take and the time pressures that they are facing. A design team spends their time trying to resolve the problem, during the CW instead of after the results have been formulated. Evaluation time is spent re-designing, this inhibits the effectiveness of the walkthrough and leads to lengthy design discussions. Many times, designers may feel personally offended that their work is even being evaluated. Due to the fact that a walk-through would likely lead to more work on a project that they already are under pressure to complete in the allowed time, designers will over-defend their design during the walkthrough. They are more likely to be argumentative and reject changes that seem obvious.

==History==
The method was developed in the early nineties by Wharton, et al., and reached a large usability audience when it was published as a chapter in Jakob Nielsen&#x27;s seminal book on usability, &quot;Usability Inspection Methods&quot;. The Wharton, et al. method required asking four questions at each step, along with extensive documentation of the analysis. In 2000 there was a resurgence in interest in the method in response to a CHI paper by Spencer who described modifications to the method to make it effective in a real software development setting. Spencer&#x27;s streamlined method required asking only two questions at each step, and involved creating less documentation. Spencer&#x27;s paper followed the example set by Rowley, et al. who described the modifications to the method that they made based on their experience applying the methods in their 1992 CHI paper &quot;The Cognitive Jogthrough&quot;.

Originally designed as a tool to evaluate interactive systems, such as postal kiosks, automated teller machines (ATMs), and interactive museum exhibits, where users would have little to no experience with using this new technology. However, since its creation, the method has been applied with success to complex systems like CAD software and some software development tools to understand the first experience of new users.

<text>Wooroloo Prison Farm is an Australian minimum-security prison located in Wooroloo, Western Australia. It was established in 1972 under an arrangement that it would offer some of its amenities to the community of Wooroloo. It was previously the site of a sanatorium.

==History ==
The Wooroloo Sanatorium was officially opened on 1 May 1915, designed by two Western Australian Principal Architects, Hillson Beasley and William Hardwick

The complex operated as a tuberculosis sanatorium until 1959. From 1960 to 1970, the former sanatorium operated as a geriatric and district hospital. Since 1970, the former sick staff ward has remained in use as the Wooroloo hospital. Since 1970, the site has operated as a minimum-security
prison for short-term offenders.

Approved prisoners can work under supervision in the local community and are involved in reforestation and environmental programs, training at local businesses and general community projects.

The prison&#x27;s large industries complex produces goods for the prison system and for external contracts including prison food, offsetting some of the costs of prisoner management.

Prisoners are taught workshop skills and can take part in traineeships to help them find a job when they are released from prison.

<text>Kealakekua Bay is located on the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii about south of Kailua-Kona. Settled over a thousand years ago, the surrounding area contains many archeological and historical sites such as religious temples (heiaus) and also includes the spot where the first documented European to reach the Hawaiian islands, Captain James Cook, was killed. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii in 1973 as the Kealakekua Bay Historical District. The bay is a marine life conservation district, a popular destination for kayaking, scuba diving, and snorkeling.

==History==

===Ancient history===
Settlement on Kealakekua Bay has a long history. &quot;Hikiau Heiau&quot; is a luakini temple of Ancient Hawaii located at the south end of the bay, at coordinates . Cook recorded the large platform being about high, long, and wide. The sheer cliff face called Ka-pali-poko—a-Manuahi overlooking the bay houses burials of Hawaiian royalty and their accompanied companions and funerary items. The northwestern part of the cliff is called Ka-pali-kapu-o-Keoua. The name means &quot;sacred cliffs of Keōua &quot; in honor of Keōua Nui. He was sometimes known as the &quot;father of kings&quot; since many rulers were his descendants. The difficulty in accessing the cliff kept the exact burial places secret.

The village of &quot;Kaawaloa&quot; was at the north end of the bay in ancient times, where the &quot;Puhina O Lono Heiau&quot; was built, along with some royal residences. The name of the village means &quot;the distant Kava&quot;, from the medicinal plant used in religious rituals. The name of the bay comes from &quot;ke ala ke kua&quot; in the Hawaiian Language which means &quot;the god&#x27;s pathway.&quot; This area was the focus of extensive Makahiki celebrations.

===Captain Cook and Kalaniʻōpuʻu===

Although there are theories that Spanish or Dutch sailors might have stopped here much earlier, the first documented European to arrive was Captain James Cook. He and his crews on the &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot; sighted Kealakekua Bay on the morning of January 17, 1779. He estimated several thousand people lived in the two villages, and many thousand more in the surrounding areas. On January 28, he performed the first Christian service on the islands, for the funeral of a crew member who had died.

Cook had entered the bay during Makahiki, a traditionally peaceful time. Cook and his men were welcomed, given much food and gifts from the island and treated as honored guests. John Ledyard, the only American on board Cook&#x27;s third voyage, gives a detailed account of these events in his journals. Cook and his crew stayed for several weeks, returning to sea shortly after the end of the festival. After suffering damage to the mast during a storm, the ships returned two weeks later on February 12. This time, already fraying relations came to a head.

One of Cook&#x27;s captains accused a native chieftain of stealing the Resolution&#x27;s jolly boat. It was soon found unstolen and the native chief soured from the false accusation. Cook himself attempted to barter for the wood used to border the natives &quot;Morai&quot; (a sacred burial ground for certain high-ranking individuals). The native chiefs were mortified at this offer and refused to accept it. Cook later took the wood anyway. With a damaged mast, fraying relations with the natives and being heavily outnumbered, Cook attempted to lure Hawaiian chief Kalaniōpuu aboard his ship to hold him hostage in order to induce &quot;good behavior among the natives&quot;. Tensions mounted as Cook attempted to trick the chief, and natives surrounded the beach. Cook fired the first shot, and his men quickly shot several more natives. As Cook and his men attempted to retreat, Cook was stabbed through the chest by a native chief with an iron dagger which had been traded from Cook&#x27;s own ship previously in the same visit. The majority of Cook&#x27;s body was never recovered. Since Cook&#x27;s men felt they could not leave without resupplying fresh water and further repair of their damaged mast, subsequent skirmishing resulted in dozens of native deaths by musket fire and the ships cannons; a portion of Kireekakooa, one of the towns in the bay, was also burned. Cook&#x27;s death was depicted in a series of paintings called &quot;Death of Cook&quot;. The monument is accessed by a one-hour hike from the road or by crossing the bay by boat.

===Turmoil===
When Kalaniōpuu died in 1782, his oldest son Kiwalao officially inherited the kingdom, but his nephew Kamehameha I became guardian of the god Kūkailimoku. A younger son, Keōua Kuahuula, was not happy about this and provoked Kamehameha. Their forces met just south of the bay at the battle of Mokuōhai. Kamehameha won control of the west and north sides of the island, but Keōua escaped. It would take over a decade to consolidate Kamehameha&#x27;s control.

In 1786, merchant ships of the King George&#x27;s Sound Company under command of the maritime fur traders Nathaniel Portlock and Captain George Dixon anchored in the harbor, but avoided coming ashore. They had been on Cook&#x27;s voyage when he was killed by natives. In December 1788, the &quot;Iphigenia&quot; under William Douglas arrived with Chief Kaiana, who had already traveled to China.

The first American ship was probably the &quot;Lady Washington&quot; around this time under Captain John Kendrick. Two sailors, Parson Howel and James Boyd, left the ship (in 1790 or when it returned in 1793) and lived on the island.

In March 1790, the American ship &quot;Eleanora&quot; arrived at Kealakekua Bay and sent a British sailor ashore named John Young, to determine whether the sister ship, the schooner , had arrived for its planned rendezvous. Young was detained by Kamehameha&#x27;s men to prevent the &quot;Eleanora&#x27;s&quot; Captain Simon Metcalfe from hearing the news of the destruction of the &quot;Fair American&quot;, and the death of Metcalfe&#x27;s son, Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe, after the massacre at Olowalu. Young and Isaac Davis, the lone survivor of the &quot;Fair American&quot;, slowly adjusted to the island lifestyle. They instructed Hawaiians in the use of the captured cannon and muskets, becoming respected advisers to Kamehameha. In 1791 Spanish explorer Manuel Quimper visited on the ship .

===More visitors===

George Vancouver arrived in March 1792 to winter in the islands with a small fleet of British ships. He had been a young midshipman on Cook&#x27;s fatal voyage 13 years earlier and commanded the party that attempted to recover Cook&#x27;s remains. He avoided anchoring in Kealakekua Bay, but met some men in canoes who were interested in trading. The common request was for firearms, which Vancouver resisted. One included chief Kaʻiana, who would later turn against Kamehameha.

Vancouver suspected Kaiana intended to seize his ships, so left him behind and headed up the coast. There he was surprised to encounter a Hawaiian who in broken English introduced himself as &quot;Jack&quot;, and told of traveling to America on a fur-trading ship. Through him, Vancouver met Keeaumoku Pāpaiahiahi, who gave him a favorable impression of Kamehameha (his son-in-law). He spent the rest of the winter in Oahu.

Vancouver returned in February 1793; this time he picked up Keeaumoku and anchored in Kealakekua Bay. When Kamehameha came to greet the ship, he brought John Young, now fluent in the Hawaiian language, as an interpreter. This greatly helped to develop a trusted trading relationship. The Hawaiians presented a war game, which was often part of the Makahiki celebration. Impressed by the warriors&#x27; abilities, Vancouver fired off some fireworks at night to demonstrate his military technology. Vancouver presented some cattle which he had picked up in California. They were weak and barely alive, so he convinced Kamehameha to avoid killing them for ten years.

Scottish doctor James Lind had recommended the use of citrus juice to prevent scurvy on long voyages. The botanist Archibald Menzies had picked up some citrus fruit seeds in South Africa, and dropped them off here, so that future ships might be able to replenish their stocks at the Hawaiian islands.

Vancouver left in March 1793 after visiting the other islands to continue his expedition, and returned again January 13, 1794. He still hoped to broker a truce between Kamehameha and the other islands. His first step was to reconcile Kamehameha with Queen Kaahumanu.
He dropped off more cattle and sheep from California, and discovered a cow left the year before had delivered a calf. The cattle became feral and eventually became pests. They were not controlled until the &quot;Hawaiian cowboys&quot;, known as the &quot;paniolo&quot;, were recruited.

The ship&#x27;s carpenters instructed the Hawaiians and the British advisers how to build a European-style ship, which they named the &quot;Britania&quot;. On February 25, 1794, Vancouver gathered leaders from around the island onto his ship and negotiated a treaty. Although this treaty was sometimes described as &quot;ceding&quot; Hawaii to Great Britain, the treaty was never ratified by the British parliament.

===Decline===
For the next few years, Kamehameha was engaged in his war campaigns, and then spent his last years at Kamakahonu to the north. By this time other harbors such as Lahaina and Honolulu became popular with visiting ships. By 1804, the heiau was falling into disuse. In 1814, a British ship HMS &quot;Forester&quot; arrived in the midst of a mutiny. Otto von Kotzebue arrived in 1816 on a mission from the Russian Empire.

When Kamehameha I died in 1819, his oldest son Liholiho officially inherited the kingdom, calling himself Kamehameha II. His nephew Keaoua Kekuaokalani inherited the important military and religious post of guardian of Kūkailimoku. However, true power was held by Kamehameha&#x27;s widow Queen Kaahumanu. She had been convinced by Vancouver and other visitors that the European customs should be adopted. In the Ai Noa she declared an end to the old Kapu system.

Kekuaokalani was outraged by this threat to the old traditions, which still were respected by most common people. He gathered religious supporters at Kaawaloa, threatening to take the kingdom by force, as happened 37 years earlier. After a failed attempt to negotiate peace, he marched his army north to meet Kalanimoku&#x27;s troops who were gathered at Kamakahonu. They met in the Battle of Kuamoo. Both sides had muskets, but Kalanimoku had cannon mounted on double-hulled canoes. He devastated the fighters for the old religion, who still lie buried in the lava rock.

The wood &quot;Kii&quot; carvings were burned, and the temples fell into disrepair. A small Christian church was built in 1824 in Kaawaloa by the Hawaiian missionaries, and the narrow trail widened to a donkey cart road in the late 1820s, but the population declined due largely to introduced diseases and people shifted to other areas.

In 1825, Admiral Lord Byron (cousin of the famous poet) on the ship erected a monument to Cook and took away many of the old, sacred artifacts. The last royalty known to live here was high chief Naihe, known as the &quot;national orator,&quot; and his wife Chiefess Kapiolani, early converts to Christianity. In 1829, she was saddened to see that the destruction of the temples included desecrating the bones of her ancestors at the Puuhonua o Hōnaunau. She removed the remains of the old chiefs and hid them in the &quot;Pali Kapu O Keōua&quot; cliffs before ordering this last temple to be destroyed. The bones were later moved to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii in 1858, under direction of King Kamehameha IV.

In 1839 a massive stone church was built just south of the bay. It fell into ruin, and a smaller building called Kahikolu Church was built in 1852. This also fell into ruin, but has been rebuilt. In 1894 a wharf was constructed at the village at the south of the bay, now called Napoopoo. A steamer landed in the early 20th century when Kona coffee became a popular crop in the upland areas.

A large white stone monument was built on the north shore of the bay in 1874 on the order of Archibald Cleghorn and was deeded to the United Kingdom in 1877. The chain around the monument is supported by four cannon from the ship HMS &quot;Fantome&quot;; they were placed with their breaches embedded in the rock in 1876. It marks the approximate location of Cook&#x27;s death. It is located at coordinates .

The Cook monument is unreachable by road; this remote location is accessible only by water or an hour-long hike along a moderately steep trail. Many visitors have rented kayaks and paddled across the bay, about from its southern end. State conservation regulations prohibit kayaks, stand-up paddleboards, surfboards, and bodyboards from entering the bay unless part of a tour with a licensed local operator. The pier at Napoopoo can be accessed down a narrow road off the Hawaii Belt Road. The beach sand was mostly removed by Hurricane Iniki in 1992. Boat tours are also available, leaving from Honokōhau harbor, Keauhou Bay, and the Kailua pier.

A short single-day eruption of Mauna Loa volcano took place underwater within Kealakekua Bay in 1877, and within a mile of the shoreline; curious onlookers approaching the area in boats reported unusually turbulent water and occasional floating blocks of hardened lava.

Hawaiian spinner dolphins frequent Kealakekua Bay, especially in the morning. The bay serves as a place for them to rest and feed, and as a nursery for mothers and their calves. Due to the calm water conditions, extensive coral reef, and thriving underwater life, Kealakekua Bay offers some of the best snorkeling and diving in Hawaii, especially in the shallow waters adjacent to the monument. The bay is a protected marine environment so visitors can snorkel but no fishing is allowed in this area.

About around the bay was designated a State Historic Park in 1967, and it was added as a Historic District to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as site 73000651. The of the bay itself were declared a Marine Life Conservation District in 1969.

A narrow one-lane road to the south leads to Puuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park, which contains more historic sites.

==In popular culture==
* Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Roughing It&quot; mentions Kealakekua Bay and the killing of Captain Cook in Chapter 71.
* In Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, Kealakekua Bay is mentioned as a place where Bill Norton, the Commander of the Space Survey Vessel &quot;Endeavour&quot;, visited.
* The 1933 song &quot;My Little Grass Shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii&quot; mentions the state fish which can be found in the bay: the &quot;Humuhumunukunukuapuaa&quot; (Reef triggerfish).

<text>Angus Buchanan, (11 August 1894 – 1 March 1944) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Buchanan was the son of a doctor from Coleford, Gloucestershire. He was educated at Monmouth School, where he was head boy. In 1913 he went to Jesus College, Oxford to study classics. One of his tutors described him as &quot;thoroughly Scotch and rather reserved, but a hard worker &amp; likely to be a good influence in the Coll[ege]&quot;. He rowed for the college in 1914, played rugby and was Secretary of the Athletics Club. He then joined the army, where he served at Gallipoli and in Mesopotamia. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1916, and was mentioned four times in despatches.

==Award of the Victoria Cross==
Buchanan was 21 years old, and a temporary captain in the 4th Battalion, South Wales Borderers, British Army during the First World War when the action for which he received his Victoria Cross took place, in the attempts to relieve the British forces besieged at Kut. On 5 April 1916 at the Falauyah Lines he rescued two wounded men while under heavy enemy fire. The award was announced in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 26 September 1916:

On 8 November 1917 he was invested with the Victoria Cross and the Military Cross at a ceremony on Durdham Downs, Bristol, by King George V. The ceremony was recorded by Pathé News (see External links). Buchanan had previously been awarded the Russian decoration of the Order of St. Vladimir 4th Class (with Swords) in July 1916.

==Later life==
On 13 February 1917 Buchanan was shot in the head by a sniper and permanently blinded. He attributed his survival to the care of his batman, Private Mark Perry. He rejoined Jesus College after the war and read law, rowing for the college in 1919 despite his blindness. After graduating in 1921, he worked in a solicitor&#x27;s office in Oxford before returning to Coleford to work until his death in 1944. In 1921 he attended Monmouth School for the ceremony marking the dedication of the school&#x27;s war memorial, which he unveiled. Funds were raised in Coleford to mark his bravery and, at Buchanan&#x27;s request, were used to purchase a playing field for the use of the local children. Buchanan died on 1 March 1944 and was buried in Coleford Cemetery, next to the recreation field named in his honour.

In addition to the playing field at Coleford, Buchanan is also remembered at Monmouth School, where the Upper Sixth Form boarding house, Buchanan House, commemorates him. His Victoria Cross was displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh in Brecon but, following its purchase by Michael Ashcroft in 2013, is now in the Lord Ashcroft VC Collection at The Imperial War Museum.

<doc id="1214618" wikidata="Q3517834" url="?curid=1214618" title="Mean radiant temperature">
<text>The concept of mean radiant temperature (MRT) is used to quantify the exchange of radiant heat between a human and their surrounding environment, with a view to understanding the influence of surface temperatures on personal comfort. Mean radiant temperature has been both qualitatively defined and quantitatively evaluated for both indoor and outdoor environments.

MRT has been defined as the uniform temperature of an imaginary enclosure in which the radiant heat transfer from the human body is equal to the radiant heat transfer in the actual non-uniform enclosure.

MRT is a useful concept as the net exchange of radiant energy between two objects is approximately proportional to the product of their temperature difference multiplied by their emissivity (ability to emit and absorb heat).
The MRT is simply the area weighted mean temperature of all the objects surrounding the body. This is meaningful as long as the temperature differences of the objects are small compared to their absolute temperatures, allowing linearization of the Stefan-Boltzmann Law in the relevant temperature range.

MRT also has a strong influence on thermophysiological comfort indexes such as physiological equivalent temperature (PET) or predicted mean vote (PMV).

What we experience and feel relating to thermal comfort in a building is related to the influence of both the air temperature and the temperature of surfaces in that space, represented by the mean radiant temperature. The MRT is controlled by enclosure performances. 

The operative temperature, which is a more functional measure of thermal comfort in a building, is calculated from air temperature, mean radiant temperature and air speed. Maintaining a balance between the operative temperature and the mean radiant temperature can create a more comfortable space. This is done with effective design of the building, interior and with the use of high temperature radiant cooling and low temperature radiant heating.

In outdoor settings, mean radiant temperature is affected by air temperature but also by the radiation of absorbed heat from the materials used in sidewalks, streets, and buildings. It can be mitigated by tree cover and green space, which act as sources of shade and promote evaporative cooling. The experienced mean radiant temperature outdoors can vary widely depending on local conditions. For example, measurements taken across Chapel Hill, North Carolina to examine urban heat island exposure ranged from .

== Calculation ==

There are different ways to estimate the mean radiant temperature, either applying its definition and using equations to calculate it, or measuring it with particular thermometers or sensors.

Since the amount of radiant heat lost or received by human body is the algebraic sum of all radiant fluxes exchanged by its exposed parts with the surrounding sources, MRT can be calculated from the measured temperature of surrounding walls and surfaces and their positions with respect to the person. Therefore, it is necessary to measure those temperatures and the angle factors between the person and the surrounding surfaces.
Most building materials have a high emittance ε, so all surfaces in the room can be assumed to be black. Because the sum of the angle factors is unity, the fourth power of MRT equals the mean value of the surrounding surface temperatures to the fourth power, weighted by the respective angle factors.

The following equation is used:

formula_1

where:

:formula_2 is Mean Radiant Temperature;
:formula_3 is the temperature of surface &quot;n&quot;, in Kelvins;
:formula_4 is the angle factor between a person and surface &quot;n&quot;.

If relatively small temperature differences exist between the surfaces of the enclosure, the equation can be simplified to the following linear form:

formula_5

This linear formula tends to give a lower value of MRT, but in many cases the difference is small.

In general, angle factors are difficult to determine, and they normally depend on the position and orientation of the person. Furthermore, this method becomes complex and time consuming as the number of surfaces increases and they have elaborate shapes. There is currently no way to effectively collect this data. For this reason, an easier way to determine the MRT is by measuring it with a particular thermometer.

== Measurement ==

The MRT can be estimated using a black-globe thermometer. The black-globe thermometer consists of a black globe in the center of which is placed a temperature sensor such as the bulb of a mercury thermometer, a thermocouple or a resistance probe. The globe can in theory have any diameter but as the formulae used in the calculation of the mean radiant temperature depend on the diameter of the globe, a diameter of , specified for use with these formulae, is generally recommended. The smaller the diameter of the globe, the greater the effect of the air temperature and air velocity, thus causing a reduction in the accuracy of the measurement of the mean radiant temperature. So that the external surface of the globe absorbs the radiation from the walls of the enclosure, the surface of the globe shall be darkened, either by the means of an electro-chemical coating or, more generally, by means of a layer of matte black paint.

This thermometer actually measures the globe temperature (GT), tending towards thermal balance under the effect of convection and radiation coming from the different heat sources in the enclosure. Thanks to this principle, knowing GT allows the mean radiant temperature MRT to be determined.
According to ISO 7726 Standard, the equation that is used most frequently (forced convection) is the following:

formula_6

When air velocity is less than 1m/s (natural convection), the equation is the following:

formula_7

where:

:formula_2 is the mean radiant temperature (°C);
:formula_9 is the globe temperature (°C);
:formula_10 is the air velocity at the level of the globe (m/s);
:formula_11 is the emissivity of the globe (no dimension);
:formula_12 is the diameter of the globe (m);
:formula_13 is air temperature (°C);

And for the standard globe (D = 0.150 m, formula_11 = 0.95):

formula_15

The measurement is affected by air movement because the measured GT depends on both convection and radiation transfer. By effectively increasing the size of the thermometer bulb, the convection transfer coefficient is reduced and the effect of radiation is proportionally increased. Because of local convective air currents GT typically lies between the air temperature and MRT. The faster the air moves over the globe thermometer, the closer GT approaches the air temperature.

Moreover, since the MRT is defined with respect to the human body, the shape of the sensor is also a factor. The spherical shape of the globe thermometer gives a reasonable approximation of a seated person; for people who are standing, the globe, in a radiant nonuniform environment, overestimates the radiation from floor or ceiling, so an ellipsoid sensor gives a better approximation.

There are several other precautions to be taken when using a black-globe thermometer, depending on the conditions of the measurement. Furthermore, there are different measuring methods, such as the two-sphere radiometer and the constant-air-temperature sensor.

<text>Private William Buckingham VC (February 1886 – 15 September 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He received the VC during the First World War, for his actions during the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915. He was killed the following year at Thiepval.

==Early life==
The exact date of William Buckingham&#x27;s birth is not known, but he was born in February 1886 in Bedford, England. He was the oldest child of William Henry Billington and his wife, Annie Billington. His father died in 1888, and his mother remarried in 1891, to Thomas Buckingham. A couple of years later, when William was six, he and his brother was placed in the Countesthorpe Cottage Homes, near Leicester, where he would spend most of his youth.

Buckingham joined the British Army in November 1901, when he was nearly 16, and was posted to the 2nd Battalion of the Leicestershire Regiment. With the regiment, he served on Guernsey and in British India.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914, Buckingham was still in India with the 2nd Battalion. It was attached to the 20th Indian Brigade, 7th (Meerut) Division, and sent to the Western Front with the Indian Corps. He fought at the Defence of Givenchy, with his name being forwarded to Lieutenant General James Willcocks, the commander of the Indian Corps, for special mention.

In March 1915, the Meerut Division was selected to be involved in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, which called for an assault on the German lines at Neuve Chapelle. The Meerut Division was to help force a gap for the Cavalry Corps to exploit. His battalion was on the right of the division&#x27;s sector and proceeded to capture a section of German trenches that had been overlooked for a preliminary artillery barrage. Over the next two days, until relieved, the battalion resisted German counterattacks and artillery. During this time, Buckingham carried out several sorties to recover men who had been wounded. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a serviceman of the British Empire. The citation reads as follows:

Buckingham was wounded in the chest during the fighting, and was sent to England for recovery. He was unaware of the award of the VC until an acquaintance showed him a newspaper reporting it. King George V presented him with the VC on 4 June 1915, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. His caregivers from the Countesthorpe Cottage Homes were present for the investiture. It was later discovered that his mother was still alive, his stepfather having apparently abandoned the family many years previously. His hometown of Leicester took some pride in the award, gifting him £100 in war loan stock and a purse of gold.

Rather than immediately returning to his battalion, Buckingham was used in recruitment drives for the war effort. He remained in England until April 1916, at which time he was posted to the 1st Battalion of the Leicestershire Regiment. He was promoted to acting corporal for a time but requested a return to his previous rank of private. He was killed at Thiepval on 15 September 1916, during the later stages of the Battle of the Somme. He has no known grave and his name is recorded on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme.

==Medals==
His medals, which in addition to the VC, included the 1914 Star, British War Medal, and the Victory Medal, were in the care of Countesthorpe Cottage Homes until 1958, at which time the facility was closed. They were then transferred to the care of the Child Welfare Department in Leicester. Since 1966, the medals have been displayed at the Royal Leicestershire Regiment Museum Collection in the Newarke Houses Museum, Leicester.

<text>The Division of Macarthur is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

==History==

The division is named after John Macarthur and his wife Elizabeth, who were both pioneers of Australia&#x27;s wool industry. The main products and work in the electorate are in the fruit and vegetable production, lucerne and fodder crops, wine, dairy cattle and horse-breeding.

Macarthur has changed hands regularly over the years as redistributions have favoured different parties. Macarthur was a bellwether seat from the time of its establishment in 1949 until the 2007 election—during that 58-year period it was always held by a member of the governing party or coalition. Originally a hybrid urban-rural seat stretching from southwest Sydney to the Southern Highlands, successive redistributions have shrunk the geographical size of the seat due to the rapid growth of the Campbelltown area. In the redistribution prior to the 2001 federal election, Southern Highlands towns such as Bowral and Moss Vale were removed, shrinking the seat to one eighth of its original size and making it an entirely Sydney-based seat. This made the seat notionally Labor by 1.3%, from the previous 5.6% of the Liberals, prompting Liberal minister and former New South Wales premier John Fahey to retire. However, his replacement as Liberal candidate, former ultra-marathoner, Pat Farmer, achieved an 8.3% swing to retain the seat for the Liberals, actually tallying a primary vote large enough to win without the need for preferences. He increased the margin from 7 to 9.5% at the 2004 election.

Ahead of the 2007 election, a redistribution seemingly consolidated Farmer&#x27;s hold on the seat; the Liberal majority was boosted to 11.1%. However, Farmer was nearly defeated in the election, suffering a swing of 10.4%. The swing was spread evenly across the electorate, reflecting its solid mortgage belt character. The swing was particularly large in the heavily mortgaged suburbs of Narellan, Camden and the traditionally more Labor-voting areas of Campbelltown. Farmer&#x27;s margin was reduced to an extremely marginal 0.7%. A further redistribution in 2010 made it notionally a Labor seat. Farmer was defeated for Liberal preselection by Campbelltown mayor Russell Matheson, who was able to retain the seat for the Liberals. Matheson gained a large swing at the 2013 election, increasing the Liberal margin to 11.1 percent. The Liberal margin was reduced to just 3.3 percent in the redistribution prior to the 2016 election, and additionally, a ReachTEL poll of 628 voters conducted in Macarthur during the election campaign saw Labor leading the Liberals. At the 2016 election Labor challenger Mike Freelander took the seat off the Liberals on a swing of just under 12 percent, ending the Liberals&#x27; twenty-year hold on the seat and turning it into a safe Labor seat in one stroke. Freelander actually won enough votes on the first count to defeat Matheson without the need for preferences.

Ahead of the 2016 federal election, ABC psephologist Antony Green listed the seat in his election guide as one of eleven which he classed as bellwether electorates.

==Boundaries and demographics==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

Located in outer south-west Sydney and covering , the present boundaries of the division cover the southern suburbs of Campbelltown and parts of the local government area of Camden. It encompasses the suburbs of Airds, Ambarvale, Blair Athol, Blairmount, Bow Bowing, Bradbury, Campbelltown, Catherine Field, Claymore, Currans Hill, Eagle Vale, Englorie Park, Eschol Park, Gilead, Gledswood Hills, Glen Alpine, Gregory Hills, Kearns, Kentlyn, Leumeah, Menangle Park, Minto, Minto Heights, Oran Park, Raby, Rosemeadow, Ruse, Smeaton Grange, St Andrews, St Helens Park, Varroville, Wedderburn, Woodbine; as well as parts of Bringelly, Denham Court, Harrington Park, Ingleburn, Leppington, Menangle, Mount Annan, Narellan, and Rossmore.

While the electorate is predominantly outer-suburban, its contains some semi-rural areas such as Bringelly and Leppington. The population of the electorate is likely to expand significantly over coming years due to the release of new land surrounding Sydney for residential development.

It is a mortgage belt area, with a high percentage of young families, leading to the proportion of residents under 18 being 35%, compared to the national average of 27.2%, with a low proportion of senior citizens (5.9% compared to 12.1%). This is further highlighted in the fact that 23.3% of the population is attending school, compared to the national average of 18.1%. The income is above average, with 19.7% of the families in the electorate earning less than A$500 per week, compared to 24.3% for the national average. The birth demographics of the electorate are similar to the rest of Australia, with the proportion of people born overseas and in non-English speaking countries within one percentage point of the national average.

<text>Alexander Henry Buckley, VC (22 July 1891 – 2 September 1918) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Buckley was born on 22 July 1891 to James and Julia Buckley at Gulargambone, New South Wales, Australia. One of four children, he was home schooled on his parents&#x27; property &quot;Homebush&quot; during his childhood. After completing his schooling, he worked on the family farm with his father.

==Military career==
Buckley enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 3 February 1916, volunteering for overseas service. After completing basic training at Bathurst, New South Wales in June, he was sent to England among a draft of reinforcements. Just prior to departing Australia, Buckley became engaged. He was posted to 54th Battalion, an infantry battalion assigned to the 14th Brigade, which was part of the 5th Division.

Joining the battalion on the Western Front in November 1916 at Flers, France, Buckley served with it as it manned defensive positions along the Somme during the winter months. The following year, after the Germans withdrew towards the Hindenburg Line, Buckley took part in the fighting around Bullecourt, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde and in November 1917 he was promoted to temporary corporal. In August 1918, the 54th Battalion took part in the initial stages of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive around Amiens. On the night of 1/2 September 1918, at Peronne, France, during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin, Buckley performed the deeds that led to him being posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.
He was originally buried at St Radegonde, but was later re-interred at Peronne Communal Cemetery Extension.

<text>Wat Chedi Liam (; &quot;Temple of the Squared Pagoda&quot;), formerly known as Wat Ku Kham (; &quot;Temple of the Golden Stupa&quot;), is one of the wats in the ancient Thai city of Wiang Kum Kam, now part of present-day Chiang Mai.

==History==


The temple was built c. 1287 and remained in use during the early Lan Na period after the new city of Chiang Mai had been established by King Mangrai the Great.

===Renovation===
The current buildings are from a renovation in 1908 CE by a Burmese trader. Because of this many of the decorations of the wat are Burmese in style. For example, all but one of the Buddha images on the chedi are wearing the yellow Burmese colourings rather than the white Thai colours.

The chedi was also renovated in 1992 CE when a number of other improvements were made to the site. Not all of these improvements were popular, nor were some needed repairs carried out. Despite its great age the wat is used in much the same way as later wats (for example, there is a weekend market there).

==Architecture==
The Chedi (Cetiya) is a five-tiered design common in the early Lanna period and shows clear influence of the Mon Haripunchai design. Each corner of the chedi is guarded by a large, outward facing lion, and there are Buddha statues showing different mudras on four of the tiers of the Chedi. The main hall decorations are in very good condition both inside and out.

<text>John Walter (1 January 1738 – 16 November 1812) was an English newspaper publisher and founder of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, which he launched on 1 January 1785 as &quot;The Daily Universal Register&quot;. He was born in London and educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, then located in London.

== Biography ==
Walter was engaged in a prosperous business as a coal merchant from the death of his father Richard Walter (about 1755/6) until 1781. Walter played a leading part in establishing the Coal Exchange in London; but shortly after 1781, when he began to occupy himself solely as an underwriter and became a member of Lloyd&#x27;s, he over-speculated and failed.

In 1782, he bought from one Henry Johnson a patent for a new method of printing from logotypes (i.e. founts of words or portions of words, instead of letters), and made some improvements to it. In 1784, he acquired an old printing office in Blackfriars, which formed the nucleus of the Printing-house Square of a later date, and established there his Logographic Office.

At first Walter only undertook the printing of books, but on 1 January 1785 he started a small newspaper called &quot;The Daily Universal Register&quot;, which on reaching its 940th number on 1 January 1788 was renamed &quot;The Times&quot;.

The printing business developed and prospered, but the newspaper at first had a somewhat chequered career. On 11 July 1789, Walter was convicted of libel on the Duke of York and was sentenced to a fine of £50 (), a year&#x27;s imprisonment in Newgate, to stand in the pillory for an hour and to give surety for good behaviour for seven years; for further libels the fine was increased by £100 and the imprisonment by a second year. On 9 March 1791, however, he was freed and pardoned on the request of the Prince of Wales.

In 1799, Walter was again convicted for a technical libel, this time on Lord Cowper. He had then given up the management of the business to his eldest son, William, and had (1795) retired to The Grove, Teddington, where he lived until his death at aged 74. He is buried at St Mary with St Alban where there is a memorial.

In 1759, he married Frances Landen (died 1798), by whom he had six children. He very soon gave up the duties he undertook in 1795, and in 1803 transferred the sole management of the business to his son John Walter (editor, born 1776).

He had a natural son, Walter Wilson.

<text>The International Canoe Federation (ICF) is the umbrella organization of all national canoe organizations worldwide. It is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and administers all aspects of canoe sport worldwide. 157 countries are affiliated with the ICF after seven national federations were added at the 2008 ICF Congress in Rome.

In light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the ICF suspended athletes from Russia and Belarus from competing at any International Canoe Federation events, and suspended all officials from Russia and Belarus from officiating at any event sanctioned by ICF, and from attending or taking part in any ICF meetings, committees, and forums. In March 2023, the Russian Canoe Federation sent a letter addressing the ISF and urging them to reverse the decision and allow Russian athletes to compete at ISF events. The RCF&#x27;s statement included claims that the war was actually started by Ukraine and that &quot;Russia defends peace&quot;. In May 2023, the International Canoe Federation reinstated Russian and Belarusian athletes, shortly after a Russian missile attack forced cancellation of a canoe event in Ukraine.

<doc id="1214633" wikidata="Q6515469" url="?curid=1214633" title="Tryvann">
<text>Tryvann is a small lake in Nordmarka, the forest area just north of Oslo city, near the Holmenkollen ski jump. By the water lies a cabin called Tryvannstua, in which there is a café open regularly during both summer and winter. On a hill above the lake looms the television tower Tryvannstårnet (&quot;The Tryvann tower&quot;), visible from most of Oslo. Tryvann is the entry and beginning of Nordmarka. It is used all year around. The key purposes of this area in the winter are skiing and cross-country skiing, whereas in the summer it is more commonly used for walks in the forest and biking. When referring to Tryvann, it is mostly referred to as the Tryvann vinterpark.

==Facts and infrastructure==
Tryvann vinterpark is an alpine ski resort in the area around Tryvann. The first ski slope of Tryvann vinterpark, named &quot;Tryvannskleiva&quot;, was created in 1931. Since then an enormous expansion has occurred, and today Tryvann vinterpark consists of 18 slopes and 11 lifts. The longest run (Wyllerløypa) is 1,400 metres, with a drop of 381 metres. All the slopes have floodlighting which covers over 9.6 km of terrain. The resort has a fairly large terrain park featuring edge rails, boxes, jib features and a full-scale halfpipe, regularly hosting some minor national skiing and snowboarding competitions.

Tryvann vinterpark is easily accessed by visitors with the metro system. The ride from Oslo city centre to the top of Tryvann takes approximately 25 minutes. This gives easy access and opportunities for over one million citizens in Oslo. Tryvann is Norway&#x27;s fourth biggest ski resort in Norway, measured in ticket sales. In 2012 there were 205,000 visitors.

==History of Tryvannstua==
Tryvanstua was built in 1931. The cabin is constructed of windfall timber and was constructed unexpectedly after an immense storm in Nordmarka that occurred in November 1930. The storm damaged a radius close to 7000 m3, bringing down 3000 trees. As a result, Tryvannstua was constructed with the purpose of serving food for people travelling in the woods, and that was the beginning of Tryvann vinterpark. Tryvannstua was renovated and expanded in 1965–66. This increased the seating capacity to 175 people, and a fireplace was built for freezing alpinists. The renovation was an initiative mainly because of skiing in the 1966 World Cup.

<doc id="1214636" wikidata="Q2566584" url="?curid=1214636" title="Whau River">
<text>The Whau River () is an estuarial arm of the southwestern Waitemata Harbour (rather than a river) within the Auckland metropolitan area in New Zealand. It flows north for from its origin at the confluence of the Avondale Stream and Whau Stream to its mouth between the Te Atatū Peninsula and the long, thin Rosebank Peninsula in Avondale. It is at its widest and wide at its mouth.

The estuary extends past the suburbs of Glendene and Kelston. It has one small estuarial tributary arm, the Wairau Creek in the southwest. The tide flows up the Wairau Creek as far as Sabulite Road in Kelston, and up the Rewarewa Creek to Clark Street and Wolverton Road in New Lynn. The area at the mouth of the estuary is legally protected as the Motu Manawa (Pollen Island) Marine Reserve.

The Whau River is named after a native tree, the whau (&quot;Entelea arborescens&quot;).

== Geography ==
The geology of the area is mainly composed of marine and riverine sediment. The stream&#x27;s intertidal banks are commonly settled by mangroves and exotic weed species.

The river&#x27;s catchment covers and includes all or part of Te Atatū South, Glendene, Kelston, Titirangi, Titirangi North, Green Bay, New Lynn, Glen Eden, Avondale, Blockhouse Bay and Mount Albert. Watersheds closely follow Te Atatu Road, Titirangi Road, Hillsborough Road, Richardson Road and Rosebank Road. The catchment consists of clay, sandstone and mud and was formed 20 million years ago when the land was raised from the sea.

==History==
In earlier times, Māori used Te Tōanga Waka, the Whau River portage, for travel between the Waitemata Harbour (on the Pacific east coast) and the Manukau Harbour (on the Tasman west coast). They paddled canoes up the Whau River and the Avondale Stream and then carried the canoes over a short stretch of land to Green Bay on the Manukau. This is remembered in the name for Portage Road, which runs alongside the Avondale Stream, and it is known that seasonal Māori settlements existed at the mouth of the river. For many years after European settlement, there was talk of making a canal between the Whau and the Manukau. Plans for a long canal, with a cutting up to deep, were made in 1907, but dismissed as too costly in 1921.

From 1841, the banks of the Whau River were logged for Kauri timber. In 1852, the first brickworks in West Auckland were opened on the Rosebank Peninsula by Dr Daniel Pollen on the Whau River. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Whau River became the centre of West Auckland&#x27;s clayworks; of the 39 brick and clayworks of West Auckland, 23 were located on the Whau River. European settlers used the Whau for marine transport and by 1865 there were five public wharves at New Lynn. Boats carried the products of local industries including brickworks, a leather tannery, a gelatine and glue factory and firewood cutting. The last commercial vessel to use the Whau was a flat-bottomed scow the &quot;Rahiri&quot;, which carried bricks and manuka firewood from the area until 1948. For nearly a hundred years, factories such as the tannery and an abattoir discharged wastes directly into the Whau.

Friends of the Whau Inc. was formed in 1999 to restore the ecology of the Whau through revegetation and reduction of pollution. The Whau River Catchment Trust was formed in 2012.

The West End Rowing Club has been based in the Whau since 2001.

The Whau River formerly marked the boundary between two territorial authorities in the Auckland region: Waitakere City, centred around West Auckland suburbs, and Auckland City, composed of the central suburbs of the Auckland isthmus. After the amalgamation of the Auckland councils in 2010, the suburbs adjacent to the river were administered by the Whau ward.

In 2015, construction began on the Te Whau Pathway, a walking and cycling path along the western edge of the Whau River from Te Atatū Peninsula to Olympic Park in New Lynn. The path is planned to continue on to Green Bay beach thus connecting the Waitemata Harbour to the Manukau Harbour.

<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designations 6 PUL, 6 CITY and 6 PAN to electric multiple units built to work the routes between London and Brighton, West Worthing and Eastbourne. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class number. The 6 PUL units were designated 6 COR until 1935 (the COR designation was later used for 4 COR units).

==Prototype cars 11001–11002==
Coach numbers 11001 and 11002 were prototype driving motor brake vehicles for the mainline stock that was being developed for the London to Brighton electrification. The first was built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRCW) and the second by Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company. Both were introduced in October 1931, and ran with three trailers converted from former London and South Western Railway carriages as unit number 2001.

After trials with this unit had been completed the set was disbanded, and the two prototype driving cars were reformed into 6 CITY units 2041 and 2042 respectively. Unit number 2001 was then reused for one of the production 6 PUL units.

==Construction==
The 6 PUL (6-car Pullman stock, numbers 2001–2020) and 6 CITY (6-car City stock, numbers 2041–2043) units were built in 1932 to provide high quality accommodation on the newly electrified London to Brighton route. Units of both types each included a Pullman composite kitchen car, which were built by Metropolitan Cammell and numbered 256 to 278 in the Pullman Car Company series.

The 6 CITY units differed from the 6 PUL units only in that the three trailers other than the Pullman car had all first class accommodation. They were dedicated for use on the London Bridge to Brighton route (as opposed to the London Victoria route on which the 6 PUL units were used), and were intended for the trains used by City workers, hence their designation.

The 6 PAN (6-car Pantry units, numbers 2021–2037) units were introduced in 1935, upon the extension of the electrified network to Ore. They were similar to the 6 PUL units, except that the Pullman car was replaced by a first class dining car with a pantry. From this time, 12-car trains were often formed from a 6 PAN coupled to either a 6 PUL or 6 CITY.

Until the arrival of the 6 PAN units, the 6 PUL units had been referred to as 6 COR (6-car Corridor stock) and, as explained below, the designation COR was again used by this stock in later years for various reasons. The numbers of all three types of unit were revised in January 1937 from 20xx to 30xx.

==Formations==
Initial formations of these units were as follows (coaches were not formed in numerical order):
The Pullman cars used in these sets were numbered and named as follows:
==Reformations and conversions==
Between May 1942 and May 1946, the Pullman cars in these units were withdrawn and stored at the Pullman workshops in Brighton. This was part of the general withdrawal of Pullman and other restaurant and dining cars from railway stock during World War II. During this period, the 6 PUL and 6 CITY stock were referred to as 5 COR. When the Pullman cars were returned to service, not all were inserted into the same units that they had been in before the war. Those that were reformed were:

During 1947 and 1948, the three 6 CITY units were converted to non-standard 6 PUL units by reclassifying their three Trailer First vehicles into a Trailer Third (numbered 10113–10115) and two Trailer Composites (11862–11867).

After the 6 PUL and 6-PAN units were disbanded, many of the carriages continued to run in service together with former 4-RES and 4-COR stock. These reformed units were classified either 4 PUL, 4 COR, 4 COR(N), 6 COR or 6 TC.

===6 TC===
The 6 TC unit was formed in 1965 to trial push-pull equipment that would allow a diesel locomotive to be operated remotely from the driving cab in the multiple unit. It was 
composed of former 4Cor driving motor cars, which had their motors removed and the end gangways removed, and 6 PAN/6 PUL trailer cars. At the same time a Class 33 locomotive was modified to work with the unit.

From early 1966, the experimental train was used on the Oxted line, and was later transferred to the Clapham Junction to Kensington Olympia service. The trials were successful, and led to the production of the 3 TC and 4 TC units for working the Bournemouth line with Class 33/1 locomotives. However, the 6 TC unit had a short life, and was withdrawn after incurring accident damage.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 23 January 1948, a passenger train formed by a 6 PUL and a 6 PAN unit overran signals at and collided with an empty stock train formed by two 6 PAN units. Three people were killed and 34 were injured.
* On 25 August 1958, 6 PUL unit No. 3014 and 6 PAN unit 3032 formed a passenger train that was involved in a head-on collision with a sleeper car train at , East Sussex after the latter overran a signal. Five people were killed and 40 were injured. Most of the cars in the electric train were damaged to some extent; cars 11027 and 10004, which were at the front of unit 3014, were written off. Unit 3032 was subsequently disbanded, with two cars, nos. 11074 and 10044, being used to return unit 3014 to service. Of the remaining four cars of unit 3032, car 10043 was scrapped later in 1958; car 11075 replaced 11074 in unit 3014 in January 1959; and cars 12271 and 12512 were scrapped at Newhaven in 1961.

==Preservation==
Former 6 PUL Pullman cars 264 &quot;Ruth&quot; and 278 &quot;Bertha&quot; have been preserved, and are now used as ordinary locomotive-hauled Pullman cars. Number 264 is part of the Venice Simplon Orient Express fleet, working charter trains on the main line, while 278 is at Carnforth under private ownership.

The underframes of several PUL and PAN unit carriages were reused by the engineering department as long-welded rail carriers and crane runners.

<doc id="1214639" wikidata="Q6223768" url="?curid=1214639" title="John Buckley (VC)">
<text>Major John Buckley VC (24 May 1813 – 14 July 1876) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross. He was the 115th recipient of the award and the first of 182 awarded during the Indian Mutiny (1358 have been awarded in total).

== Early life ==
Buckley was born in a cottage on Cocker Hill in Stalybridge, Cheshire on 24 May 1813 and was baptised in Old St George&#x27;s Church. His early employment was in the textile industry, working locally at Harrison&#x27;s Mill and then Bayley&#x27;s Mill. Recognising that his ambitions went beyond mill work, Buckley left home at Christmas 1831 to travel to Manchester, where he enlisted at the Recruiting Office into the Bengal Artillery. He joined the Regiment as a Gunner at Chatham and on 20 June 1832 he embarked on HMS Layton at Gravesend to join his unit in India.

He married Mary Ann Broadway on 28 July 1835 at Chunar, India. He was then stationed at Fort William, Calcutta. By 1845, his wife and two of his three children had died of tropical disease. He then married Esther Hunter at Allahabad, India on 17 August 1846. In 1852 the surviving daughter from his first marriage died, and in the following year two sons by his second marriage also died.

He was promoted Corporal on 31 August 1840, Sergeant on 1 September 1853, and being able to speak several Indian dialects he gained a position with the Bengal Veterans&#x27; Establishment as a Sub-Conductor on 21 April 1854. He was appointed Staff Conductor on 26 May 1856, and in 1857 he took his wife and three surviving children to Delhi, where he became Assistant Commissary of Ordnance and was employed at the Great Magazine, a storehouse for guns and ammunition.

== Defence of the Magazine at Delhi ==
Buckley was 43 years old, and a Deputy Assistant Commissary of Ordnance in the Commissariat Department (Bengal Establishment) of the British East India Company during the Indian Mutiny when the following took place on 11 May 1857 at Delhi, India for which he was awarded the VC. Deputy Assistant Commissary Buckley was one of nine men who defended the ammunition storehouse for more than five hours against large numbers of mutineers. When the wall was being scaled and hope of outside help was gone, they blew up the ammunition, killing many of the mutineers. Of the defenders, five died in the explosion and one shortly afterwards, while Buckley, George Forrest, and William Raynor survived. His citation in the London Gazette reads: 
== Remaining life ==
He was captured by the enemy and soon learnt that his entire family had been ruthlessly murdered by the rebels. He had now lost two wives and eight children in total and wanted to live no longer. He begged for death from his captors but they refused to kill him on account of his bravery at the magazine.

On escaping to the British lines he volunteered for every dangerous mission he could in order to vent his anger and seek revenge. He was present at the Battle of Badli-ki-Serai on 8 June 1857, and three attacks of sunstroke left him weak and ill, but he survived. He was then appointed Provost Marshal at Meerut, where one of his duties was to superintend the execution of 150 rebels. He devised their punishment of being strapped to the muzzle of a cannon and blown apart. Buckley was promoted to Lieutenant on 18 October 1858. He became ill again and the Medical Board at Fort William, Calcutta, granted him two years leave. He departed for Britain on 21 May 1858 and arrived home on 6 July.

John Buckley was invested with his Victoria Cross by Queen Victoria on 2 August 1858 during a parade of the garrison on Southsea Common, Portsmouth.

He returned to Stalybridge in September 1858, but soon left again for India. Buckley retired as a Major on 1 October 1861, returned to England and lived for many years with his final wife, Sara, at 213 East India Dock Road, Poplar until his death on 14 July 1876, aged 63. Living in relative &quot;poverty and obscurity&quot; at the time of his death, he was buried in an unmarked grave at the nearby Tower Hamlets Cemetery.

==The medal==
Buckley has no direct descendants but a great-niece survived until 1955, at which time his VC was purchased by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps for £11,000. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Logistic Corps Museum at Worthy Down, Hampshire.

==Commemorations==
A blue plaque to commemorate Buckley&#x27;s life is sited at the Travellers Call public house in Stalybridge.

Buckley Barracks, home of 9 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps (formed from the amalgamation of the RAOC/RCT) at Hullavington, Wiltshire is named for him.

Buckley House, the official residence of the commander of the Defence Storage and Distribution Centre at Bicester, is also named after Buckley.

His Tower Hamlets Cemetery grave was left unmarked for 136 years, until a volunteer with the Friends of Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park (the cemetery was renamed and repurposed in the 1990s) found it in 2012, having cross-referenced the cemetery&#x27;s burial records against Army archives. The grave was marked with a headstone in a ceremony on 14 July 2014, which was attended by Jim Fitzpatrick MP, soldiers from 9 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps, and the Victoria Cross Trust.

<doc id="1214652" wikidata="Q7095230" url="?curid=1214652" title="Oobi (TV series)">
<text>Oobi is an American children&#x27;s television series produced by Little Airplane Productions for the Noggin channel. The show&#x27;s concept is based on a training method used by puppeteers, in which they use their hands and a pair of glass eyes instead of a full puppet. The main character is a bare hand puppet named Oobi. The first season was a series of two-minute shorts. For its second and third seasons, it became a long-form series, with episodes lasting 13 minutes each. The show originally aired from 2000 to February 11, 2005, with reruns continuing until March 18, 2013.

The series was created by Josh Selig. He came up with the idea for &quot;Oobi&quot; while watching bare-handed puppeteers audition for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. The main characters were played by Tim Lagasse, Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo, Noel MacNeal, and Tyler Bunch; all of the puppeteers were veteran Muppet performers.

The puppets&#x27; designs include glass eyes and accessories like hats and hairpieces. The puppeteers&#x27; thumbs are used to represent mouth movement, and their fingers flutter and clench to show emotions. The characters talk in simple sentences, using only two to three words at a time. The show&#x27;s ending credits feature a montage of children and families playing with their own bare-hand Oobi puppets.

&quot;Oobi&quot; was a breakout success for Noggin. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the puppeteers&#x27; performances, the visual style, and the show&#x27;s appeal toward multiple age groups. &quot;The Age&quot; reported that the show developed a strong cult following among older viewers, and Noel MacNeal has said that the show&#x27;s fans range from amateur puppeteers to &quot;college-age stoners.&quot; The show received a variety of awards, including from the Television Academy and Parents&#x27; Choice. &quot;Oobi&quot; had a Nielsen rating of 2.35 among Noggin viewers by 2004, becoming Noggin&#x27;s highest-rated series at the time. It is the most widely distributed Noggin show, having aired in over 23 markets worldwide by 2005. A foreign adaptation titled &quot;&quot; premiered in 2012 and ran for 78 episodes, airing in the Middle East and countries across Asia.

==Plot==
The show takes place in a quaint, old-fashioned neighborhood where hand puppets live and act like people. The main character is a curious 4-year-old named Oobi who likes to explore the outside world. He lives in a single-story house with his little sister, Uma, and his grandfather, Grampu. Uma is very overdramatic and, depending on the day, she can be either excited or completely stressed out. Grampu is laid-back and encourages the kids to learn new things, but he is also rather unlucky and always has to clean up the kids&#x27; messes. Oobi has a best friend, Kako, who lives across the street and likes to visit.

Most episodes are about Oobi learning about something for the first time, like a new place, a new game, or a holiday. According to Noggin, the show was meant to mirror the stage of early childhood &quot;when everything in [the] world is new and incredible&quot; and &quot;when each revelation helps build a sense of mastery and self-confidence.&quot; The characters use basic vocabulary, and they use simple sentences based on the speech structure of a child just starting to talk. For example, &quot;Uma, school, first day&quot; is said in place of &quot;It&#x27;s my first day of school.&quot; The show was meant to help develop social skills, early literacy, and logical thinking.

In season 1, the episodes are simple shorts about Oobi making new discoveries. In season 2, the episodes were extended and followed a format made up of three parts. The first part is a story like the earlier shorts. The second part is a set of interviews between the puppets and human families, centering on the main story&#x27;s topic. The last part is an interactive game (usually rhyming, guessing, or memory). When &quot;Oobi&quot; started a third season in 2004, the game segments were dropped and replaced with longer stories. Interviews were still an important part of the show, but instead of being shown after the story, these segments were shortened and played as transitions between scenes.

==Characters==
===Main===

* Oobi (Tim Lagasse) is a 4-year-old boy who is curious and always excited to learn something new. Unlike the other characters, he is a completely bare puppet aside from his eyes and wears no accessories or clothes, except on special occasions. Oobi dreams of becoming a piano player and takes piano lessons from an old woman named Inka. He is very protective of his favorite toy, a red model car. He acts as a role model to his little sister, Uma.
* Uma (Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo) is Oobi&#x27;s younger sister. She is shorter than Oobi and loves singing, dancing, and pretending. Chickens are her favorite animal, and she likes to talk about and imitate them, which sometimes annoys Grampu. She has a habit of overreacting to small changes or problems. Her catchphrases are &quot;Nice!&quot; and &quot;Pretty.&quot; Because she is so young, she has trouble pronouncing long words.
* Kako (Noel MacNeal) is Oobi&#x27;s excitable, confident, and sometimes arrogant best friend and next-door neighbor. Kako has a playful attitude and likes to make jokes, but he can prove to be insightful and sincere whenever Oobi needs advice. His catchphrase is &quot;!&quot;, the Spanish word for &quot;perfect&quot;. Kako lives with his parents, Mamu and Papu.
* Grampu (Tyler Bunch) is Oobi and Uma&#x27;s wise and sometimes rather unlucky grandfather who is their caregiver and mentor. His appearance is different from that of the kids; four of his fingers are curled instead of being extended, making him look taller and possibly signifying his age. His favorite pastimes are cooking and gardening. He develops a romantic relationship with Oobi&#x27;s piano teacher, Inka, throughout the series. His catchphrase is &quot;Lovely!&quot; 

===Recurring===
* Inka (Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo) is Oobi&#x27;s Eastern European-accented piano teacher and Grampu&#x27;s girlfriend. She often takes Grampu on dates and flirts with him when she visits Oobi&#x27;s house. She has visited Paris, likes to try foreign foods.
* Angus (Matt Vogel) is a high-strung friend of Oobi&#x27;s whose eyes are under his fingers rather than on top. He talks in a nasal voice and usually worries about how he looks in front of others. Amusingly, he is a good actor and has a talent for singing, but he gets stage fright when he has to perform in front of an audience.
* Mrs. Johnson (Jennifer Barnhart) is Oobi&#x27;s elderly neighbor and one of the few left-handed characters on the show. She has a pet cat named Kitty who likes to climb up trees.
* Mamu and Papu (Frankie Cordero) are Kako&#x27;s parents, who appear whenever Oobi visits Kako&#x27;s house. Papu is a homemaker and a cook. Mamu works at an office and is usually away from home, but she still finds time to spend with her family.
* Maestru (James Godwin) is Oobi and Kako&#x27;s singing teacher who works at the local community center. He is also in charge of the town events. His index finger is always extended and he uses it as a conducting baton.
* Frieda (Cheryl Blaylock) is an upside-down foot puppet. Oobi and Frieda like to play with each other at the park and teach each other how to play different games. She represents a person of a different race or culture from the hand puppets.
* Moppie (Heather Asch) is Uma&#x27;s best friend from preschool. She is high-spirited and energetic, but also afraid to try new things. She is an artist and likes to draw portraits of her classmates.
* Bella (Lisa Buckley) is an Italian-accented grocery store owner and one of Grampu&#x27;s close friends. She brings fruit wherever she goes.

==Production==
===Concept and creation===
&quot;Oobi&quot; was made by Little Airplane Productions, a studio co-founded by Josh Selig and Lori Shaer. Both co-founders started their careers working on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Selig was inspired to create &quot;Oobi&quot; after watching puppeteers perform with their bare hands on the set of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Each puppeteer used their hand and a pair of ping pong balls instead of a full puppet. This is a common technique among puppeteers in training, as it helps them learn the basics of lip-syncing and focusing the eyes of a puppet. Selig noted that the more skilled actors could convey lots of emotions with their hands, and it gave him the idea for a series that showcased the &quot;raw emotion&quot; of bare-handed puppetry.

In 1999, Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop created a cable channel called Noggin. At first, the Noggin channel mainly showed reruns from Sesame Workshop&#x27;s library, so both companies started to look for pitches for new shows. Josh Selig pitched &quot;Oobi&quot; to them under the working title &quot;Pipo&quot;, which he wanted to name the main character. He decided to rename the show &quot;Oobi&quot; after he found out that &quot;Pipo&quot; was already trademarked by an Italian brand of jeans. The new name was meant to mirror the characters&#x27; eyeballs with two O&#x27;s.

The pitch was successful, and &quot;Oobi&quot; entered production. For the first season, Noggin ordered a collection of 48 shorts, which lasted 1 to 2 minutes each and would play during commercial breaks. Josh Selig said, &quot;I set up a shop to produce that series. So we just signed a one-year lease, it was really an experiment for us... and after the first year we found that we loved having a company.&quot; The first season of shorts was filmed in 1999 and started airing in 2000 on Noggin.

===Assembling the crew===
Tim Lagasse was chosen to play Oobi because of his previous bare-handed puppetry in &quot;A Show of Hands&quot;, a series of short films he made in the early 1990s. The show&#x27;s main cast and crew members were all Sesame Workshop alumni. Kevin Clash, best known for being the original performer of Elmo, was an ensemble puppeteer on &quot;Oobi&quot; and guest-starred as Randy in the episode, &quot;Babysitter!&quot;. Matt Vogel, the current puppeteer for Kermit the Frog and Big Bird, played Oobi&#x27;s friend Angus. Martin Robinson, who plays Telly Monster on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, built the puppets&#x27; glass eyes and accessories on &quot;Oobi&quot;. Lisa Simon, who won 20 Daytime Emmys for her work as a director of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, was the producer for &quot;Oobi&quot;.

The show&#x27;s background music was created by Sacred Noise, a music production company in New York. Additional music was composed by pianist Marianna Rosett and Christopher North Renquist. A few other composers were brought onto the crew for special songs. Jared Faber wrote the theme song. Broadway orchestrator Larry Hochman wrote songs for the &quot;Theater!&quot; episode, which was a ten-minute musical.

===Filming===
&quot;Oobi&quot; was filmed at Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. The show&#x27;s set pieces were built on tall wooden poles, positioned to be level with the puppeteers&#x27; hands when they raised their arms. This kept the actors&#x27; heads out of the camera frame and allowed them to walk normally while performing, making their puppets&#x27; movements as smooth as possible. Television monitors were placed below the sets so that the puppeteers could watch their motions and position their characters according to each scene. The actors wore hands-free headsets that recorded their dialogue, making them able to perform and voice their characters at the same time. They sometimes dubbed over their lines in post-production, specifically for the song sequences in episodes like &quot;Theater!&quot;, which required them to record different takes to match their voices to the music tracks.

Many of the show&#x27;s sets were made to evoke the look of old-fashioned home environments. To simulate natural window light in the studio, the crew of &quot;Oobi&quot; placed shades with foliage patterns over their studio lights; this gave the appearance of sunlight passing through trees. Green screens were used for the sky of the outdoor sets and for the windows of Oobi&#x27;s house.

Every week during production, the puppeteers visited a local manicurist to get their fingernails touched up. Most of the male puppeteers, such as Tim Lagasse, also had to shave their arms regularly if they played younger characters; Josh Selig said in a 2004 interview that Lagasse had to shave often so that Oobi would not &quot;look like a hairy kid.&quot; Tyler Bunch was told specifically not to shave because his natural arm hair gave Grampu the appearance of an elderly, hairy grandfather.

When Cheryl Blaylock was offered the role of Frieda the Foot, she had to revisit puppeteer training techniques to learn to use her foot as a puppet. She recounted in a 2012 interview: &quot;I had to actually go back to Puppetry 101 to train my foot to lip sync. Oh yes, I was determined to do some kind of toe wiggle that could be convincing.&quot; For episodes with Frieda, the crew had to construct a new set that allowed Blaylock to raise her foot alongside the hand puppets. To do this, they assembled a ramp-like stage with a chair connected to it, resting on its side. Blaylock was able to lie down in the chair and rest her leg on the ramp, making her foot appear to be standing at the same height as Oobi.

===Iranian adaptation===

In May 2012, the Iranian cable channel IRIB TV2 produced its own adaptation of the show, called &quot;&quot;. None of the original crew members were involved. Amir Soltan Ahmadi and Negar Estakhr, two of Iran&#x27;s foremost puppeteers, directed and starred in the program. In an interview with the newspaper &quot;Jaam-e Jam&quot;, Estakhr said that she watched episodes of &quot;Oobi&quot; in English and wanted to make a tailored version for an Iranian audience. Like the original show, it features brother and sister hand puppets who live with their grandfather, but the cast was expanded to include two parents. The three adult characters wore Arab garments.

78 eight-minute episodes were made. They aired from September 22 to December 20, 2012. In July 2013, &quot;Oobi: Dasdasi&quot; was sold to broadcasters in five countries: Kuwait, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. IRIB TV2 aired the show in Iran and NHK aired a subtitled version in Japan. IRIB&#x27;s Art News Agency hosts full episodes of &quot;Oobi: Dasdasi&quot; on its website.

==Broadcast==
===Episodes===

48 shorts and 52 long-form episodes were made across three seasons. Each short is 1–2 minutes long, and the long-form episodes are 10–13 minutes each. The long-form episodes were usually shown in pairs.

===Airing history===
In the United States, &quot;Oobi&quot; was mostly shown on Noggin. In April 2002, the first season of shorts was also shown during commercial breaks on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block. Four episodes of the second season were simulcast on both Noggin and Nickelodeon on April 7, 2003.

The show was on Noggin&#x27;s on-demand service from 2004 to 2009. In 2005, &quot;Oobi&quot; episodes were posted online to Nick Jr. Video, a broadband video channel. Later that year, the show was part of &quot;Cox Family Fun Night,&quot; a weekly event that was shown every Sunday for subscribers of the Cox cable company. Throughout 2005, select General Motors cars had TVs preloaded with Noggin shows, including &quot;Oobi&quot;. Reruns of &quot;Oobi&quot; were shown on the Nick Jr. channel from September 28, 2009 until March 18, 2013. From May 2015 to March 2020, the show was available on the Noggin streaming app. The show has been available on Amazon Video since June 2018. In January 2021, the series was added to Paramount+ (which was called CBS All Access at the time).

By the end of its run in 2005, &quot;Oobi&quot; was aired in over 23 international markets. In Canada, TVOntario aired the first season of shorts. It carried the show from September 1, 2003 to September 2, 2006. On December 5, 2004, the series started airing on AFN Prime, a channel operated by the U.S. Armed Forces that is available worldwide. It was shown on the channel every Sunday until April 3, 2005. The Australian channel ABC Kids ran premieres of the show from February 8 to March 15, 2005, with reruns until February 2, 2007. &quot;Oobi&quot; aired on Kids Central in Singapore in 2007. Nickelodeon Philippines aired &quot;Oobi&quot; from 2011 to 2012. The show was also shown in Tonga. &quot;Oobi&quot; has been one of Nickelodeon Pakistan&#x27;s flagship series since 2009; as of 2023, it continues to air on the channel once a day.

The show has been dubbed in different languages. From 2005 to 2006, an Icelandic-dubbed version of &quot;Oobi&quot; aired on Stöð 2. In China, a Mandarin Chinese dub aired on HaHa Nick from May 1 to August 5, 2005. In Israel, a Hebrew dub was made with Gilad Kleter and Yoram Yosefsberg as the voices of Oobi and Grampu. It aired on Nickelodeon Israel and BabyTV from 2008 to 2013. In France and Wallonia, a French dub aired on Nickelodeon France and Nickelodeon Junior from 2005 to 2012. In June 2010, the episode &quot;Make Music!&quot; was featured in Nickelodeon France&#x27;s Fête de la Musique event. A Polish dub called &quot;Rączusie&quot; aired on Nickelodeon Poland from July 19, 2009 to February 28, 2010. Nickelodeon Arabia, which broadcasts to the Middle East and North Africa, aired an Arabic dub from 2009 to 2011. &quot;Oobi&quot; was not part of Nickelodeon Asia&#x27;s main lineup, but the channel&#x27;s website featured games of the show until 2016.

==Reception==

===Ratings===
&quot;Oobi&quot; had high ratings for the Noggin channel. In 2004, Noggin reported that three shows—&quot;Oobi&quot;, &quot;Miffy and Friends&quot;, and &quot;Connie the Cow&quot;—increased the channel&#x27;s daily viewership by 55 percent over the year before. The average number of viewers watching &quot;Oobi&quot; increased by 43 percent during the same time. Noggin also reported that &quot;Oobi&quot; had grown in ratings in each quarter of 2004: +8% from first to second, +22% from second to third, and +10% from third to fourth. The steady increase in ratings was reported by Multichannel News author Mike Reynolds, who attributed Noggin&#x27;s popularity to its &quot;breakout original series &quot;Oobi&quot;.&quot; The show&#x27;s growing audience led Noggin to order a third season. The premiere of the &quot;Uma Preschool!&quot; episode on September 6, 2004, posted a 2.35 Nielsen rating among the preschool age group, becoming the highest-rated premiere of a Noggin show to that date. In December 2004, Noggin published a press release with the subtitle: &quot;Noggin&#x27;s Oobi Delivers Highest Rated Original Premiere In Network&#x27;s History.&quot;

===Critical reception===
The puppeteers&#x27; performances and the show&#x27;s style have been praised by critics. Common Sense Media reviewer Andrea Graham gave the show a five-star review, writing that &quot;when it comes to preschool programming, &quot;Oobi&quot; really breaks the mold, succeeding in its simplicity.&quot; Jeanne Spreier of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; called &quot;Oobi&quot; &quot;the most imaginative and interesting preschooler program to debut in years,&quot; describing its characters as &quot;amazingly expressive hands that show anger, fear, happiness, even age and youth.&quot; The Coalition for Quality Children&#x27;s Media wrote positively of &quot;Oobi&quot;, complimenting its concept, and calling it &quot;thoroughly enjoyable&quot; and &quot;extremely well received.&quot; Diana Dawson of the &quot;Herald-Journal&quot; liked the show&#x27;s old-fashioned look, stating that &quot;in a world that too often forgets the innocent joy of playing kick-the-can and catching fireflies, there&#x27;s something incredibly endearing about the bare-handed puppetry.&quot; DVD Talk&#x27;s Holly Ordway called &quot;Oobi&quot; &quot;a clever way to encourage kids to be imaginative.&quot; Jaime Egan of Families.com commended the show&#x27;s messages of inclusion and diversity, calling them &quot;invaluable&quot; and highlighting Frieda and Kako as stand-out characters. Ryan Ball of &quot;Animation Magazine&quot; called the show &quot;an offbeat new entry&quot; to Noggin&#x27;s lineup, adding that &quot;the fact that all the characters are played by hands just adds to the quirkiness.&quot; In 2010, Babble.com listed &quot;Oobi&quot; second on their list of top twelve television series for young children. In 2018, writer Jon Weisman named &quot;Oobi&quot; one of the best kids&#x27; shows of the 2000s, calling it &quot;low-key charming&quot; and praising the theme song.

Some critics have commended the show for its widespread appeal. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Tom Ascheim said that &quot;the show&#x27;s quirky appeal extended far beyond Noggin&#x27;s target audience. &#x27;The simplicity is really understandable by my two-year-old, but my ten-year-old really giggles at &quot;Oobi&quot;. Andrew Dalton of &quot;The Stir&quot; said that he was a fan of the show himself, adding that &quot;Oobi&quot; is &quot;just happy to be simple and gleeful, and that actually makes it more appealing to sit and watch as a grown-up.&quot; &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;″s Jane Clifford felt that it could be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, remarking that &quot;if as a kid you ever drew eyes or a mouth on your hand and then &#x27;talked&#x27; to a friend, you&#x27;ll relate to this show.&quot; The &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; named &quot;Oobi&quot; the best cable premiere of April 2003, reporting: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen every blessed minute of each general-audience premiere; they are good. But another new show outreaches the rest: &quot;Oobi&quot;.&quot; In a 2018 interview, Noel MacNeal recounted, &quot;Some of our biggest fans became [college] kids coming back from parties, who were just like really stoned, and would just sit and watch &quot;Oobi&quot;.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
In spring 2001, &quot;Oobi&quot; won a Parents&#x27; Choice Gold Award. Later in the same year, the show had two nominations from the Coalition for Quality Children&#x27;s Media, winning one of them. In 2004, the show won a second Parents&#x27; Choice Award, and a nomination in the &quot;Up to 6 Fiction&quot; category at the Prix Jeunesse International Festival. In 2007, Common Sense Media named the show on its annual list of &quot;Best Bets for Young Kids.&quot; In June 2009, Josh Selig won an Innovation Award from the Television Academy for his work on the show. In 2014, Prix Jeunesse named &quot;Oobi&quot; in its category &quot;The Greatest Impact Programmes of the Last 50 Years.&quot;

===Cultural impact===

&quot;Oobi&quot; has made an impression on celebrities. Actress Uma Thurman, who shares her first name with the character Uma, revealed to Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo (who plays Uma) that she was familiar with the show and its characters in 2004. Also in 2007, two clips from the &quot;Oobi&quot; episodes &quot;Showtime!&quot; and &quot;Uma Bathroom!&quot; were shown on Joel McHale&#x27;s talk show &quot;The Soup&quot; during the segment &quot;What the Kids Are Watching&quot;, where McHale took scenes from children&#x27;s shows out of context.

During its run, the show developed a cult following of puppet fans and amateur filmmakers who created their own &quot;Oobi&quot; puppets. In 2003, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; said that &quot;Oobi&quot; was &quot;already very popular&quot; with &quot;those of the Muppet generation.&quot; In the same article, Tom Ascheim stated that Oobi &quot;gets fan mail,&quot; and he guessed that the show was catching on because viewers could easily make their own &quot;Oobi&quot; puppets with their hands. In 2004, &quot;The Melbourne Age&quot; reported that &quot;the show - the work of various &quot;Sesame Street alumni&quot; - is developing a strong cult following; the real Uma [Thurman] is said to be a fan of hand Uma.&quot; An online shop of unofficial &quot;Oobi&quot; puppets and accessories, called OobiEyes.com, was operated from 2006 to 2013. OobiEyes.com held an advertising campaign with YouTube in 2008, which inspired a community of early YouTubers to make videos with their own &quot;Oobi&quot;-style puppets.
In November 2006, indie rock band The Format released a music video for their song &quot;Dog Problems&quot; which was inspired by &quot;Oobi&quot;. It featured hand puppets in the style of the show. In 2009, an advertising contest called the Cannes Young Lions Competition included an Oxfam commercial based on &quot;Oobi&quot;. Titled &quot;Let Your Hands Do the Talking,&quot; it starred spoofs of celebrities portrayed as hand puppets and given &quot;Oo&quot;-themed names like Oobi and Uma. In January 2014, the condom company Durex made a commercial that starred a parody version of Oobi named Elizabeth. In an interview with &quot;La República&quot;, the commercial&#x27;s director said, &quot;Elizabeth is a parody of the television character Oobi, who is also a funny talking hand.&quot;

In July 2016, Disney XD made a one-off television pilot called &quot;Right Hand Guy&quot;, which starred a pre-teen whose right hand becomes a puppet and befriends him. The creator, Dan Lagana, took inspiration from &quot;Oobi&quot; while developing the pilot. Lagana showed the &quot;Oobi&quot; episode &quot;Babysitter!&quot; to the actors so that they would be familiar with the hand movements.

The show has been mentioned in books. In his autobiography &quot;Alternadad&quot;, comedian Neal Pollack talks about &quot;Oobi&quot; and names Grampu his favorite character. He writes that &quot;Oobi&quot; &quot;featured a hilarious character called Grampu ... he made funny faces when he had to eat the awful food the kids cooked for him, and he also flirted with Oobi&#x27;s piano teacher.&quot; It is a plot point in Laura Lynn&#x27;s novel &quot;Ariel&#x27;s Office&quot;, where the narrator&#x27;s daughter watches Noggin and is &quot;transfixed&quot; by Oobi. It is described as a &quot;Noggin show that use[s] Señor Wences-style human hand puppets&quot; in Dade Hayes&#x27;s novel &quot;Anytime Playdate&quot;, which studies the preschool TV business. The filmmaker Robert Rodriguez also talks about &quot;Oobi&quot; in his book &quot;The 1950s&#x27; Most Wanted&quot;. Lisa Guernsey describes &quot;Oobi&quot; in her 2012 book &quot;Screen Time&quot;, which reports on how TV affects children.

===Video releases and books===
Clips from &quot;Oobi&quot; were included as special features on ten Nick Jr. DVDs sold in 2003 and 2004. The first was &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues: Shapes and Colors!&quot;, which featured the &quot;Dance!&quot; short. The last was &quot;Oswald: On-the-Go Oswald&quot;, which featured a clip from the &quot;Dance Class!&quot; episode. Some of these videos were repackaged and sold in DVD packs from 2004 until 2015.

&quot;Oobi&quot; has also been featured in TV-related magazines. The August 2004 issue of &quot;Nick Jr. Magazine&quot; had a craft section about how to make &quot;Oobi&quot; hand puppets. In August 2004 and April 2005, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ran interviews with Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo and Josh Selig about the show. The show is mentioned in the September 2004 issue of &quot;Big Apple Parent&quot;. The October 2004 issue of &quot;Playthings&quot; includes another interview with Josh Selig with pictures from behind the scenes of &quot;Oobi&quot;. &quot;Kidscreen&quot; included news about the show in July 2005 and in June 2007.

===Online games===
In 2001, Noggin&#x27;s website added a page called &quot;Oobi Online,&quot; which had a series of flash games starring Oobi. Noggin staff described the page as a place &quot;where kids can match shapes with bubbles, colors with snacks, compose music, and draw and dance with Oobi.&quot; A few of the games were inspired by episodes of the show, while other games had their own unique stories. From 2004 to 2006, Noggin.com also hosted printables of Oobi. Four of the games were imported to NickJr.com in 2009.

===Live events===

From 2001 to 2007, Noggin held live events to promote the show. The first was an &quot;Oobi&quot; tour at the 2001 North American Trade Show in Minnesota. The tour featured a replica of the set for Oobi&#x27;s house. The second event was Club Noggin, a monthly event held at GGP Malls across America in 2004. At Club Noggin, visitors could get &quot;Oobi&quot; puppet eyes and make crafts based on the show. The third event was the Noggin Auction, an online charity auction hosted on Noggin.com in November 2006. Viewers could bid on props from different Noggin shows, including hats and towels with Oobi on them. The last event was &quot;Oobi Arts and Crafts,&quot; held at the Nick Hotel in Florida in November 2007. At these sessions, hotel guests were given plastic puppet eyes like Oobi&#x27;s.

Episodes of the show were also screened at a few promotions and festivals. In 2001 and 2002, the show was part of the Kids First Film Festival, an annual event held across the United States. From 2002 to 2004, the Jillian&#x27;s restaurant chain held &quot;Noggin Play Days&quot; where it screened &quot;Oobi&quot; shorts. In August 2009, three episodes of &quot;Oobi&quot; were screened by Multikino, a chain of movie theaters across Poland. They were shown as part of a promotion called &quot;Mornings with Nick,&quot; which advertised new shows on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Polish channel.

<text>A classroom, schoolroom or lecture room is a learning space in which both children and adults learn. Classrooms are found in educational institutions of all kinds, ranging from preschools to universities, and may also be found in other places where education or training is provided, such as corporations and religious and humanitarian organizations. The classroom provides a space where learning can take place uninterrupted by outside distractions.

==Types of classroom==


In elementary schools (from Kindergarten through 5th grade), classrooms can have a whole group of 18 to 30 students (in some cases these numbers may differ) and one, two, or even three teachers. When there are two teachers in a classroom, one is the lead teacher and the other one is the assistant teacher. Or the second teacher might be a special education teacher. There may be a third teacher in the back watching and taking notes. In lower elementary the classrooms are set up slightly different from upper elementary. In these classrooms there are tables instead of desks, a rug with a (Smart Board) for whole group learning, a library, computers, and centers. The rug is the focal point of the classroom and everything else is strategically placed around it. The teacher must be able to move swiftly through the classroom. To determine if the classroom is meeting the highest level of quality there is a grading scale called ECERS (Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale). There are 43 items on this checklist and it is divided into seven categories and they are as follows: Space and Furnishings, Personal Care Routines, Language-Reasoning, Activities, Interactions, Program Structure, and Parents and Staff. In an upper elementary classroom students now use desks, there is no rug for whole group learning but there is a Smart Board and computers. Students also start practicing switching classes to get accustomed to middle and high, usually in fifth grade school transitions.

In a self-contained classrooms there are 7 or fewer students. Self-contained classrooms are designed for children that need more one-on-one time. Teachers get to solely focus on their small group of students and create individualized lessons for each child. An integrated or inclusion classroom can be thought of as a mix between a traditional classroom and a self-contained classroom. In this style of classroom, there is a mix of general students and students that need services. There are two teachers in this style of classroom, a general education teacher and special education teacher. They both teach and serve the students in the classroom, but during certain parts of the day the special education teacher may pull the students that have services to give them additional support. This allows students with accommodations or an Individual Education Program (IEP), to still get to be in a general classroom but also get the individualized instruction they need.

Middle school and high school classrooms are set up quite similar. There is one teacher and students transition from one classroom to the next. They do not stay in one classroom all day. These classrooms can have around 20 students. Students may not exactly have the same group of students in each class depending on the students&#x27; schedules.
Then college classrooms are set up in a lecture hall or auditorium with one teacher, also called a professor. Typically this teacher has a Teacher Assistant (TA), which is a grad student. This person may help administer or grade tests. They can also hold review sessions for college students to come to once or twice a week.

Some other types of classrooms that a middle/high school or college might have include computer labs for IT lessons, gymnasiums for sports, and science laboratories for biology, chemistry and physics.

==Decor and design==
The layout, design and decor of the classroom has a significant effect upon the quality of the educational experience. Attention to the acoustics and colour scheme may reduce distractions and aid concentration. The lighting and furniture likewise influence factors such as student attention span.

Historically, relatively few pupil-centric design principles were used in the construction of classrooms. In 19th century Britain, one of the few common considerations was to try and orient new buildings so the class windows faced north as much as possible, while avoiding west or southern facing windows, as in Britain northern light causes less glare. Desks were often arranged in columns and rows, with a teacher&#x27;s desk at the front, where she/he would stand and lecture the class. Little colors were used to avoid distracting the children. In the 1950s and 60s, cheap and harsh fluorescent lights were sometimes used, which could cause eyestrain. Research has suggested that optimal use of daylight, acoustics, color selection and even the arrangement of the furniture in the classroom can affect pupils&#x27; academic success. Georgetown University found that test scores increased by 11% through the improvement of a classroom&#x27;s physical environment.

In the design of a classroom, desk arrangements are essential to the decor and design of the classroom followed by seating arrangements for the students. Usually classroom desks are arranged in rows or columns, but there are many more ways to arrange the desks. For example, a circle can be made with the desks so that it is more of a group discussion. The desks can also be in a &quot;U&quot; shape for group discussions and easy access for the teacher. Another common principle is arrangement in &#x27;clusters&#x27; or small groups, which usually improves interaction and participation in (small) group-processes. Color is also a big asset to the classroom by relating the colors to the subjects learned in the classroom to help the students learn. Color also helps the atmosphere be fun and exciting, and helps visual stimulation for the students.

===Acoustics===

The acoustics of the classroom are very often overlooked, but are an important part of the success of a child. Choosing only materials that cause sound to reverberate, such as tile floors and hard wall surfaces, greatly increases noise levels and can prove detrimental to learning. One study of hyperactive versus control groups of children found that white noise has no impact on either group, but that auditory stimulation such as distant conversations or music has a negative effect on both groups of students. Children with attention deficit disorder scored higher on tests when white noise was being pumped into the classroom than when music was played. The control group of children as well as the hyperactive group of children averaged the same test scores when there was no sound as when white noise was being played.

By utilizing soft surfaces, especially on the floor, the sounds within and outside of the classroom will be diminished, taking away from the distractions facing students and improving not just the test scores of hyperactive children, but those without attention deficit disorder as well. Although carpet is an obvious choice for sound absorption, it may not be suitable for high traffic areas like hallways. In such cases, other sound absorbing materials, such as cork, can be used. The use of sound absorbing ceiling tiles may also be a wise choice for areas where carpet cannot be used for practical purposes.

===Color selection===

Color theory refers to the effects color has on the human body. Red is said to increase both aggression and appetite, a poor combination for a school&#x27;s interior. Yellow increases adrenaline levels and is also undesirable for a school setting. Blue, green, and brown create a relaxing and calming environment, which is a positive for the classroom. However, blue also is associated with cold and sadness and elongates the sense of time, which would make a blue classroom tortuous for students (Vodvarka, 1999). Warm colors are often favored by students, making them more alert and increasing brain activity, which helps in increasing test scores. Cool colors had the opposite effect. By balancing warm and cool colors, bright and subdued, a pleasing effect can be achieved that will reduce absenteeism in schools and keep the students focused on what the teacher is saying. Test scores go up when children are not in a stark white environment, which can feel sterile and cold.

===Classroom arrangement ===
Classroom arrangement or the arrangement of furniture is an important aspect because students spend most of their time seated in the classroom. The furniture should be able to move and easy to arrange to allow students to sit in places that are best suited for their learning styles so they can focus on work

Traditionally, classrooms have had one setup: straight rows of desks facing the front of the classroom. The row style allows teachers ample amount of space to walk around. This makes it easier for teachers to supervise the students work and catch any students that may be misbehaving, insuring that students stay focused. Studies have found that the row style also fosters less off topic talking causing the atmosphere to be more conducive to learning. While the row style sounds ideal from a teacher&#x27;s standpoint it can be damaging to the student&#x27;s well-being. The row style of desk arrangement has been found to cause the students to withdraw.

An alternative to the traditional row style desk pavement is to arrange the desks in groups. Phil Beadle, a UK Secondary Teacher of the Year, believes that it is best to arrange the desks in groups of six desks if at all possible. This allows for the most use out of the desk arrangement as you have the ability to utilize groups of two, three, or six students without moving a single chair. Beadle is not the only teacher to swear by group desk arrangement; studies have shown that the group desk placement setup produces a greater number of on task actions than any other form of desk placement. The group setup does have one potentially serious negative side effect. Students sitting in group desk placements are more likely to misbehave when the teacher is not looking, like using iPads that are provided by the school, such as in the Cupertino Union School District. To avoid this the groups of desks should be arranged around the outside of the room giving the teacher plenty of room to walk around and supervise as well as providing room for kinesthetic activities that can be beneficial to the students learning.

The final popular desk arrangement is the circle/semicircle placement. This particular desk setup is growing in popularity due to the numerous positive outcomes it provides. The circle desk arrangement facilitates the flow of ideas by fostering positive group dynamics. When sitting in a circle it is easier for students to not only see who is talking, but to make eye contact with the speaker. Students sitting in a circle arrangement tend to feel more comfortable speaking up and asking questions. This style of desk placement also makes it easier for teachers to control the class, preventing misbehaving and off task comments as it allows them to easily see all the students, and allows all the students to see the teacher. Besides, the type of furniture may play an important role in the learning space. There is a relationship between the ergonomic characteristics of the educational furniture and the number of cognitive errors: the more ergonomic characteristics of the furniture, the less error. There is also an error percentage reduction using separated chair and desk.

==Challenges to the classroom==

Online learning technologies make it possible for learning to take place at any time, at any place, and at any pace that the learner desires. This is particularly important for adult students who may need to schedule their learning around work and parenting responsibilities. According to the American Society for Training and Development, as of 2014, approximately 25% of employee training hours take place online rather than in a classroom. However, critics argue that even the classroom space is full of distractions in the 21st century since even though access to the online world may be restricted by some institutions, students may find distractions in their physical vicinity and so tend to multitask and divide their attention without focusing on any one task at a time.

The traditional classroom has also been attacked by advocates of various forms of alternative education. Italian educator Maria Montessori wrote that &quot;Stationary desks and chairs [are] proof that the principle of slavery still informs the school&quot;.

Low classroom air quality reduces learning.

<text>John Victor Lindsay &quot;Hoppy&quot; Hopkins (15 August 1937 – 30 January 2015) was a British photographer, journalist, researcher and political activist, and &quot;one of the best-known underground figures of &#x27;Swinging London&#x27; &quot; in the late 1960s. He also co-founded the highly influental nightclub venue UFO.

==Life==
Hopkins was born on 15 August 1937 in Slough, Berkshire, England.

After attending Felsted School in Essex, Hopkins went on to graduate in 1958 with a degree in physics and mathematics from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, which he had entered on a scholarship in 1955, and he began to work as a laboratory technician at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire. When he took a trip to Moscow to attend a Communist youth festival, his security clearance was revoked. Hopkins then re-located to London at the beginning of 1960, and began to work as a photographer for newspapers and music magazines including &quot;Jazz News&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Peace News&quot;. He photographed many of the leading musicians of the period, including The Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Hopkins also recorded the seedier side of London, with photographs of tattoo parlours, cafés, prostitutes and fetishists.

By the mid-1960s, he was at the centre of London&#x27;s emerging underground scene and recorded many peace marches, poetry readings and &quot;happenings&quot;, as well as photographing leading counter-cultural figures, including Allen Ginsberg and Malcolm X. Hopkins compiled and stencil-duplicated the names, contact details and interests of all of London&#x27;s &quot;movers and shakers&quot;. He then gave all of them a copy. This action is credited with greatly boosting the 1960s London-based underground movement.

In 1966, with Rhaune Laslett and others, he helped set up the London Free School in Notting Hill. This in turn led to the establishment of the Notting Hill carnival, first organised by Laslett with the guidance of local activists including Michael X. As an extension of the Free School news-sheet &quot;The Gate&quot;, in 1966 Hopkins and Barry Miles co-founded the influential magazine &quot;International Times&quot; (&quot;IT&quot;). Hopkins also set up the UFO Club with Joe Boyd, with Pink Floyd as the resident band.

Arrested for cannabis possession, Hopkins elected for trial by jury. In court on 1 June 1967, he claimed that cannabis was harmless and that the law should be changed. The judge, describing Hopkins as &quot;a pest to society&quot;, sentenced him to nine months in prison for keeping premises for the smoking of cannabis and possession of cannabis, although Hopkins served only six months. He was jailed at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs. A &quot;Free Hoppy&quot; movement sprang up and, as one particular consequence, Stephen Abrams began co-ordinating a campaign for the liberalisation of the law on cannabis. This led to the publication in &quot;The Times&quot; on 24 July of a full-page advertisement that described the existing law as &quot;immoral in principle and unworkable in practice&quot;, signed by Francis Crick, George Melly, Jonathan Miller and the Beatles. Paul McCartney, initially clandestinely, arranged the funding for this advertisement as a tribute to Hoppy, at the instigation of Barry Miles.

Hopkins remained a member of &quot;IT&quot;′s editorial board and a major contributor, and founded BIT as an information and agitprop arm. Hopkins favoured the more anarchistic elements in the &quot;underground&quot; centred on Ladbroke Grove, such as former UFO doorman Mick Farren, who by 1967 was also working at the &quot;IT&quot; newspaper.

In the 1970s, Hopkins was involved in researching the social uses of video for UNESCO, the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Home Office and others, and edited the &quot;Journal of the Centre for Advanced TV Studies&quot;. Later, he worked as a technical journalist in the video trade press, and co-authored distance learning video training courses. Subsequently, he took and exhibited macro photography of flowers and other plants, and co-authored papers on plant biochemistry at the University of Westminster. He also exhibited his photographs of events and personalities in the 1960s. 

Hopkins died at the age of 77 on 30 January 2015.

<doc id="1214667" wikidata="Q1463264" url="?curid=1214667" title="Centipede game">
<text>In game theory, the centipede game, first introduced by Robert Rosenthal in 1981, is an extensive form game in which two players take turns choosing either to take a slightly larger share of an increasing pot, or to pass the pot to the other player. The payoffs are arranged so that if one passes the pot to one&#x27;s opponent and the opponent takes the pot on the next round, one receives slightly less than if one had taken the pot on this round, but after an additional switch the potential payoff will be higher. Therefore, although at each round a player has an incentive to take the pot, it would be better for them to wait. Although the traditional centipede game had a limit of 100 rounds (hence the name), any game with this structure but a different number of rounds is also called a centipede game.

The unique subgame perfect equilibrium (and every Nash equilibrium) of these games results in the first player taking the pot on the first round of the game; however, in empirical tests, relatively few players do so, and as a result, achieve a higher payoff than in the subgame perfect and Nash equilibria. These results are taken to show that subgame perfect equilibria and Nash equilibria fail to predict human play in some circumstances. The Centipede game is commonly used in introductory game theory courses and texts to highlight the concept of backward induction and the iterated elimination of dominated strategies, which show a standard way of providing a solution to the game.

==Play==
One possible version of a centipede game could be played as follows:

The addition of coins is taken to be an externality, as it is not contributed by either player.

=== Formal definition ===
The centipede game may be written as formula_1 where formula_2 and formula_3. Players formula_4 and formula_5 alternate, starting with player formula_4, and may on each turn play a move from formula_7 with a maximum of formula_8 rounds. The game terminates when formula_9 is played for the first time, otherwise upon formula_8 moves, if formula_9 is never played.

Suppose the game ends on round formula_12 with player formula_13making the final move. Then the outcome of the game at round formula_14 is defined as follows:

* If formula_15 played formula_9, then formula_15 gains formula_18 coins and formula_19 gains formula_20.
* If formula_15 played formula_22, then formula_15 gains formula_24 coins and formula_19 gains formula_26.

Here, formula_27denotes the other player.

==Equilibrium analysis and backward induction==
Standard game theoretic tools predict that the first player will defect on the first round, taking the pile of coins for himself. In the centipede game, a pure strategy consists of a set of actions (one for each choice point in the game, even though some of these choice points may never be reached) and a mixed strategy is a probability distribution over the possible pure strategies. There are several pure strategy Nash equilibria of the centipede game and infinitely many mixed strategy Nash equilibria. However, there is only one subgame perfect equilibrium (a popular refinement to the Nash equilibrium concept).

In the unique subgame perfect equilibrium, each player chooses to defect at every opportunity. This, of course, means defection at the first stage. In the Nash equilibria, however, the actions that would be taken after the initial choice opportunities (even though they are never reached since the first player defects immediately) may be cooperative.

Defection by the first player is the unique subgame perfect equilibrium and required by any Nash equilibrium, it can be established by backward induction. Suppose two players reach the final round of the game; the second player will do better by defecting and taking a slightly larger share of the pot. Since we suppose the second player will defect, the first player does better by defecting in the second to last round, taking a slightly higher payoff than she would have received by allowing the second player to defect in the last round. But knowing this, the second player ought to defect in the third to last round, taking a slightly higher payoff than he would have received by allowing the first player to defect in the second to last round. This reasoning proceeds backwards through the game tree until one concludes that the best action is for the first player to defect in the first round. The same reasoning can apply to any node in the game tree.

For a game that ends after four rounds, this reasoning proceeds as follows. If we were to reach the last round of the game, Player &quot;2&quot; would do better by choosing &quot;d&quot; instead of &quot;r&quot;, receiving 4 coins instead of 3. However, given that &quot;2&quot; will choose &quot;d&quot;, &quot;1&quot; should choose &quot;D&quot; in the second to last round, receiving 3 instead of 2. Given that &quot;1&quot; would choose &quot;D&quot; in the second to last round, &quot;2&quot; should choose &quot;d&quot; in the third to last round, receiving 2 instead of 1. But given this, Player &quot;1&quot; should choose &quot;D&quot; in the first round, receiving 1 instead of 0.

There are a large number of Nash equilibria in a centipede game, but in each, the first player defects on the first round and the second player defects in the next round frequently enough to dissuade the first player from passing. Being in a Nash equilibrium does not require that strategies be rational at every point in the game as in the subgame perfect equilibrium. This means that strategies that are cooperative in the never-reached later rounds of the game could still be in a Nash equilibrium. In the example above, one Nash equilibrium is for both players to defect on each round (even in the later rounds that are never reached). Another Nash equilibrium is for player 1 to defect on the first round, but pass on the third round and for player 2 to defect at any opportunity.

==Empirical results==

Several studies have demonstrated that the Nash equilibrium (and likewise, subgame perfect equilibrium) play is rarely observed. Instead, subjects regularly show partial cooperation, playing &quot;R&quot; (or &quot;r&quot;) for several moves before eventually choosing &quot;D&quot; (or &quot;d&quot;). It is also rare for subjects to cooperate through the whole game. For examples see McKelvey and Palfrey (1992), Nagel and Tang (1998) or Krockow et al. (2016) for a survey. Scholars have investigated the effect of increasing the stakes. As with other games, for instance the ultimatum game, as the stakes increase the play approaches (but does not reach) Nash equilibrium play. Since the empirical studies have produced results that are inconsistent with the traditional equilibrium analysis, several explanations of this behavior have been offered. To explain the experimental data, we either need some altruistic agents or some bounded rational agents. 

===Preference-based explanation===

One reason people may deviate from equilibrium behavior is if some are altruistic. The basic idea is that you have a certain probability at each game to play against an altruistic agent and if this probability is high enough, you should defect on the last round rather than the first. If enough people are altruists, sacrificing the payoff of first-round defection is worth the price in order to determine whether or not your opponent is an altruist. 

McKelvey and Palfrey (1992) create a model with some altruistic agents and some rational agents who will end up playing a mixed strategy (i.e. they play at multiple nodes with some probability). To match well the experimental data, around 5% of the players need to be altruistic in the model. Elmshauser (2022) shows that a model including altruistic agents and uncertainty-averse agents (instead of rational agents) explain even better the experimental data. Some experiments tried to see whether players who passing a lot would also be the most altruistic agents in other games or other life situations (see for instance Pulford et al or Gamba and Regner (2019) who assessed Social Value Orientation). Players passing a lot were indeed more altruistic but the difference wasn&#x27;t huge.

=== Bounded rationality explanation ===
Rosenthal (1981) suggested that if one has reason to believe his opponent will deviate from Nash behavior, then it may be advantageous to not defect on the first round. Another possibility involves error. If there is a significant possibility of error in action, perhaps because your opponent has not reasoned completely through the backward induction, it may be advantageous (and rational) to cooperate in the initial rounds. The quantal response equilibrium of McKelvey and Palfrey (1995) created a model with agents playing Nash equilibrium with errors and they applied it to the Centipede game. 

Another modelling able to explain behaviors in the centipede game is the level-k model, which is a cognitive hierarchy theory : a L0 player plays randomly, the L1 player best responds to the L0 player, the L2 player best responds to the L1 player and so on. In many games, scholars observed that most of the player were L2 or L3 players, which is consistent with the centipede game experimental data. Garcia-Pola et al. (2020) concluded from an experiment that most of the players either play following a Level-k logic or a Quantal response logic. 

However, Parco, Rapoport and Stein (2002) illustrated that the level of financial incentives can have a profound effect on the outcome in a three-player game: the larger the incentives are for deviation, the greater propensity for learning behavior in a repeated single-play experimental design to move toward the Nash equilibrium.

Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2009) find that expert chess players play differently from college students. With a rising Elo, the probability of continuing the game declines; all Grandmasters in the experiment stopped at their first chance. They conclude that chess players are familiar with using backward induction reasoning and hence need less learning to reach the equilibrium. However, in an attempt to replicate these findings, Levitt, List, and Sadoff (2010) find strongly contradictory results, with zero of sixteen Grandmasters stopping the game at the first node.

Qualitative research by Krockow et al., which employed think-aloud protocols that required players in a Centipede game to vocalise their reasoning during the game, indicated a range of decision biases such as action bias or completion bias, which may drive irrational choices in the game.

==Significance==

Like the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, this game presents a conflict between self-interest and mutual benefit. If it could be enforced, both players would prefer that they both cooperate throughout the entire game. However, a player&#x27;s self-interest or players&#x27; distrust can interfere and create a situation where both do worse than if they had blindly cooperated. Although the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma has received substantial attention for this fact, the Centipede Game has received relatively less.

Additionally, Binmore (2005) has argued that some real-world situations can be described by the Centipede game. One example he presents is the exchange of goods between parties that distrust each other. Another example Binmore (2005) likens to the Centipede game is the mating behavior of a hermaphroditic sea bass which takes turns exchanging eggs to fertilize. In these cases, we find cooperation to be abundant.

Since the payoffs for some amount of cooperation in the Centipede game are so much larger than immediate defection, the &quot;rational&quot; solutions given by backward induction can seem paradoxical. This, coupled with the fact that experimental subjects regularly cooperate in the Centipede game, has prompted debate over the usefulness of the idealizations involved in the backward induction solutions, see Aumann (1995, 1996) and Binmore (1996).

<text>John Walter Jr. (23 February 1776 – 28 July 1847) was an English newspaper editor and politician. He was the son of John Walter, the founder of &quot;The Times&quot;, and succeeded his father as the newspaper&#x27;s second editor.

==Biography==
Walter was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and Trinity College, Oxford. About 1798 he was associated with his elder brother in the management of his father&#x27;s business, and in 1803 became not only sole manager, but also editor of &quot;The Times&quot;.

He found &quot;The Times&quot; an unremarkable journal, with little influence and no independent means of checking. He left it in 1847 a great organ of public opinion, deferred to throughout Europe, consulted and courted by cabinet ministers at home, and in intimate relations with the best sources of independent information in every European capital. He added complete business knowledge of details, and untiring energy in the pursuit of excellence in literary quality, in typography, in mechanical appliances, and in the organization for the collection of news.

Walter expressed his opposition to the administration of William Pitt the Younger, which cost him government advertisements and the loss of his appointment as printer to the Customs. It also brought the hostility of officials. When the King of Portugal sent him, via the Portuguese ambassador, a service of gold plate, he returned it.

Walter insisted on the anonymity of those whom he hired. From about 1810, he delegated to others editorial supervision, first to Sir John Stoddart, then to Thomas Barnes, and in 1841 to John Thadeus Delane, though never the ultimate direction of policy.

In 1830, Walter purchased an estate called Bearwood at Sindlesham in Berkshire where he built a house, afterwards rebuilt by his son. He was appointed High Sheriff of Berkshire the same year. Two years later, he was elected to Parliament for the county, and retained his seat until 1837, as a member of the Whigs. In 1841 he was returned to Parliament for Nottingham, but was unseated the following year on petition. He was twice married, firstly to Elizabeth Anne Gregory, and by his second wife, Mary Smythe, had a family. His eldest son, John, also worked in the newspaper. He died in London on 28 July 1847. The Walter Fountain was erected in Nottingham by his son in 1866 in his memory.

<doc id="1214676" wikidata="Q1428727" url="?curid=1214676" title="Flight Unlimited">
<text>Flight Unlimited is a 1995 aerobatic flight simulator video game developed and published by LookingGlass Technologies. It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world aircraft and to perform aerobatic maneuvers. They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a timer or take lessons from a virtual flight instructor. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to maneuvers such as the tailslide, Lomcovák and Immelmann turn.

&quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; was the first self-published game released by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.

&quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success; its sales exceeded 780,000 copies by 2002. Reviewers lauded its realism, flight instruction, graphics and sense of flight, but some criticized its high system requirements. The game was followed by two sequels: &quot;Flight Unlimited II&quot; (1997) and &quot;Flight Unlimited III&quot; (1999). A combat-oriented successor, &quot;Flight Combat&quot;, was released in 2002 as &quot;Jane&#x27;s Attack Squadron&quot; after a series of setbacks. Soon after &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;″s completion, Blackley was fired from Looking Glass. He went on to design &quot;Jurassic Park: Trespasser&quot; at DreamWorks Interactive and later spearhead the Xbox project at Microsoft.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; is a three-dimensional (3D) flight simulator video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world airplanes. Players may control the Bellanca Decathlon, Extra 300S, Pitts Special S-2B, Sukhoi Su-31 and Grob G103a Twin II sailplane. The game begins at the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface—a traversable 3D room whose contents represent menu options. For example, the player interacts with a row of scale airplane models to select an aircraft, and with a world globe to change airfield locations. Six settings are available, including Sedona, Arizona and Springfield, Vermont.

The player may choose to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are controlled via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera in front of the plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane&#x27;s position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.

The game contains lessons that cover basic and advanced flight techniques, ranging from rudder turns to challenging aerobatic maneuvers. A simulated flight instructor offers real-time advice based on the player&#x27;s performance. Certificates are earned by performing well during lessons. In Hoops courses, the player undertakes a time trial through rings that float in the sky, with the option to enable a &quot;ghost plane&quot; of the highest score. Four types of Hoops courses are available: Basic, Challenge, Distance and Trick. The last is intended as a highly demanding test of the player&#x27;s aerobatic ability. The game&#x27;s sole non-powered aircraft, the Grob G103a Twin II sailplane, features its own game mode focused on energy management. The player attempts to use the direction of the wind, thermals—which realistically occur above areas that absorb more heat, such as plains and parking lots—and the orographic lift caused by slopes to stay airborne for as long as possible.

==Development==

===Origin===

The concept of &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; originated from Looking Glass Technologies&#x27; discontent with contemporary flight simulators. Company co-founders Paul Neurath and Ned Lerner wanted to develop an exceptional game in the genre, and Neurath considered the idea during the production of &quot;Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss&quot; and &quot;Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds&quot;. In 1992, Seamus Blackley, who had been undertaking graduate studies in particle physics at the Fermilab research facility, was hired through a want advertisement that Lerner had placed on a bulletin board. At the company, Blackley programmed the physics modeling system for a racing game and designed a large number of standalone physics demonstrations. He became fascinated by physics programming. An amateur pilot and flight devotee, Blackley asked Lerner extensive questions about his earlier game &quot;Chuck Yeager&#x27;s Advanced Flight Trainer&quot;, which Blackley held in high regard. In reaction to Blackley&#x27;s enthusiasm, Neurath suggested that the company develop a &quot;traditional Cessna sim&quot;.

However, Blackley instead proposed an aerobatics training simulation, which he had conceived while reading an aerobatics magazine on a Lexington, Massachusetts bus. Collaborating with &quot;Ultima Underworld II&quot; programmer Greg Travis, he created a thirty page concept document that outlined the game. His core idea was to recreate the &quot;yummy, visceral, fluid feeling that you get when flying a real airplane&quot;. He wanted the project to bear more resemblance to a playground than to a video game, and he sought to give it simple controls and realistic terrain to decrease the learning curve for beginners. Blackley assumed the role of project leader and then engaged the team in &quot;flaming sessions&quot; to generate ideas. According to programmer Doug Church, Blackley&#x27;s concept of the game was not fully developed, but he clearly expressed his thoughts and motivated the team. The first months of the project produced disparate prototypes that demonstrated prospective features. The company committed to full development of the game in early 1993, and production commenced in March.

===Production===
Blackley&#x27;s first objective was to code the game&#x27;s simulated physics. He began by deciding on a programming method—in particular, he sought one that would allow aircraft to perform the &quot;knife-edge spin&quot; maneuver that he had witnessed at air shows. In 1995, he said that he had never played a flight simulator with an accurate sense of flight. He later described his belief that the genre had stagnated, and that flight games were evaluated &quot;by [their] implementation of the standard feature set&quot;, rather than by their enjoyability. Blackley researched physics programming in contemporary flight simulators, and he discovered that many used large databases of wind tunnel and plane sensory equipment information to dictate how aircraft would operate in prerecorded scenarios. Higher-end simulators used a &quot;Newtonian&quot; system, in which algebra-based measurements of force vectors determine a plane&#x27;s position in real-time. However, Blackley believed that neither system correctly simulated the experience of flight.

In reaction, he used his knowledge of particle physics to create a real-time computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) model for &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;. The result is a simulated atmosphere: air acts as a fluid that automatically reacts to the shape of any object placed within it. Blackley gave the example that a lawn chair, if placed within the game&#x27;s real-time CFDs model, would fall merely because of its shape. The game&#x27;s planes fly because the interaction of their architecture with the atmosphere creates lift, as with real-world aircraft. Changes in the plane&#x27;s direction are caused by the interaction of their flight control surfaces (ailerons, elevators and rudders) with the simulated atmosphere. Because it simulates the dynamics of flight in real-time, the system allows for aerobatic maneuvers that were impossible in previous flight simulators. In 1994, Blackley said that it was possibly the first flight code designed for aerobatics. In constructing the CFDs model, Blackley and the team built from the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid motion, which Blackley described as &quot;horrible, complicated partial differential equations&quot;. According to &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, Blackley did not seek to represent the equations with perfect accuracy, and he was satisfied when the results were consistent and the sensation that they generated was correct.

After programming a basic version of the CFDs model, Blackley used several programs to examine the simulated currents of air that flowed across a model of a flat plate. He adjusted the code until the plate fell realistically, and then constructed test models for a plane wing and fuselage. He eventually built a complete but dysfunctional plane by using data from &quot;pinhead books&quot;. By reading aircraft design manuals, he discovered that the problems were caused by his plane&#x27;s incorrect tail and center of gravity. Following this, he created an exact three-dimensional model of the Extra 300S over roughly three days. As he had not yet simulated the physical attributes of its propeller, Blackley programmed the plane to be propelled from the rear. However, the accurate model performed properly in the simulated atmosphere.

Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played critical roles in the creation of the game&#x27;s aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game&#x27;s Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane&#x27;s shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.
The flight instructor was created by programmer Andrew Grant and voiced by Tom Streit. It monitors the player&#x27;s controller input during &quot;each frame of animation&quot;. If a maneuver is attempted, the instructor &quot;interpolates the initial control movements&quot; and predicts which maneuver is being performed. The instructor then gives advice on how to complete the maneuver and offers guidance if a mistake is made. Grant believed that the code is sometimes &quot;too picky&quot;, and he stated that it expects players to perform maneuvers more precisely than is humanly possible. The team initially planned to include an online multiplayer component, which would have allowed 64 planes to fly in the same area—thereby giving players the ability to compete with one another. However, the feature was not implemented into the final game. The staff members also sought to include aerobatic competitions in which the player could participate, but the idea was dropped because of difficulties with realism. Problems with artificially intelligent judges were also a factor in the feature&#x27;s removal.

&quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;″s terrain graphics were created with stereophotogrammetry. The team gathered aerial photographs from locations in France and the United States. They combined two to three images of each area to create digital reproductions roughly in size. Each location in the game was based on two stereoscopic sets of photographs, which were processed for more than 72 hours by a &quot;dedicated Pentium tucked away in a dark corner&quot;. From the contrasting images, the computer generated a terrain &quot;data blanket&quot; with 3D height variations. While the team had considered using satellite or surveillance aircraft images to create the game&#x27;s terrain graphics, they found that the resolution was inadequate. Material from geographic information systems was also studied, but associate producer Paul Schaffer said that it would have been &quot;astronomically expensive&quot; to obtain data with the necessary resolution.

After assembling a playable demo of &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;, the team requested assistance from then-US Aerobatic Team member Michael Goulian, who worked as a flight instructor at the nearby Hanscom Field. Because of the game&#x27;s flight code, Goulian was able to execute aerobatic maneuvers within less than three minutes of playing the game; and he later performed his &quot;entire basic aerobatic routine&quot;. Blackley told &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; that, while Goulian disliked flight simulators, &quot;When he flew &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;, he just said &#x27;pretty cool.&#x27; I was so psyched&quot;. Goulian assisted the team during the next year of development: he co-designed the game&#x27;s flight lessons and advised the team on adjustments to the plane models. Aerobatic pilot Patty Wagstaff was also consulted. At one point, the team encountered problems while testing a maneuver in the game&#x27;s Sukhoi Su-31, and Blackley was concerned that he would need to rework the game&#x27;s physics code. However, Goulian phoned a colleague—a Russian pilot—who told them to compensate for the plane&#x27;s abnormally large ailerons. Using his advice on flying the real-world plane, the team found that the maneuver worked correctly. Goulian endorsed &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; and wrote the foreword to its official strategy guide.

The graphics and physics code increased the game&#x27;s system requirements, and the team worked to optimize performance during development. They struggled to improve the game&#x27;s memory usage: the process consumed nearly as much time as the creation of the physics model, according to Church. Programmer Eric Twietmeyer ran weekly tests of the game&#x27;s performance by disabling certain parts of the code—such as the physics calculations—to isolate which parts used the most memory. By 1994, Blackley&#x27;s physics code took up only 1% of CPU time, with the rest allocated to the terrain renderer. Blackley optimized his code by converting the mathematical calculations of air from the 3D game world into a &quot;math-friendly space&quot;, during which time the Navier-Stokes equations are applied. Afterwards, the data is returned to 3D space. According to &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, this method increased speed by &quot;a factor of 100, with almost no loss in precision.&quot; The team had trouble with complex memory-related glitches during development. Church called them &quot;crazy&quot;, and programmer Greg Travis noted that debugging the terrain cache system was a &quot;nightmare&quot;.

While leading the team, Blackley adopted a loose style of supervision. According to &quot;Opening the Xbox&quot; author Dean Takahashi, &quot;Blackley [was not] ultra-organized. His idea of good management was to invite someone over for a gourmet dinner and have a casual conversation about work&quot;. However, Takahashi wrote that &quot;Blackley worked hard to inspire his team&quot;, and he described artist James Dollar&#x27;s belief that, &quot;in contrast to other Looking Glass managers, he didn&#x27;t take over tasks and make others feel stupid&quot;. During the first two years of production, the team was divided into small groups that worked on the game&#x27;s elements separately. For example, Blackley programmed the game&#x27;s physics, while Eric Twietmeyer and Tim Day created the terrain renderer. However, Doug Church later said that, while &quot;the team [did] a bunch of very cool stuff, the FBO, the flight model, the instructor, the renderer, so on&quot;, the result &quot;was almost like four separate programs, with no connection&quot;. Following the completion of the concurrently-developed &quot;System Shock&quot;, a significant part of that game&#x27;s team—including Church, Marc LeBlanc and Rob Fermier—moved to &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; to add connective material. At the time, Church said that it was difficult to meld the game&#x27;s elements, but he later stated that they largely coalesced by the end.

===Publication===
&quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; was self-published by Looking Glass Technologies. Their previous games had been developed for other video game publishers, and had generated $90 million total earnings for those companies. However, Ronald Rosenberg of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that Looking Glass was &quot;no longer satisfied as a backroom player surviving on royalties&quot;. Doug Church later explained that the company wanted to self-publish in order to escape the &quot;treadmill of waiting for advances&quot;, which would allow them to make long-term plans without needing to satisfy the immediate demands of a publisher. In late 1994, Looking Glass announced that venture capital investors, including Matrix Partners and Institutional Venture Partners, had provided the company with $3.8 million. The sum was intended to fund the development and self-publication of &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;. According to Michael Humphreys of Matrix Partners and Ruthann Quindlen of Institutional Venture Partners, the decision was partly influenced by the past success of the company&#x27;s co-founders, Paul Neurath and Ned Lerner.

Looking Glass intended &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; as a gateway into the video game publishing industry. According to Lerner, the idea of self-publishing had been considered when the company was founded. In 1995, Looking Glass projected that sales of &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; would increase royalty revenues to $10 million that year, up from $1.5 million in 1994. Jeffrey A. Kalowski, the company&#x27;s vice president of finance and administration, expected that the game would recoup its development costs and make a return before the end of the year. He predicted that, over the following 12 to 18 months, the company&#x27;s number of employees would increase from 52 to 82. The company&#x27;s executive vice president and general manager, Jerry Wolosenko, told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that the company hoped to publish six games each year. According to Doug Church, the pressure for &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; to succeed meant that the concurrently-developed &quot;System Shock&quot;, which was not self-published, received little attention from the company&#x27;s management.

&quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; was placed in direct competition with several major flight simulator franchises. Before the game&#x27;s release, Shelby Bateman of &quot;Next Generation Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;1995 is going to be a real dogfight in the flight-sim and aerial-combat categories, and LookingGlass is betting its bankroll ... that it can capture significant market share from the likes of Microsoft &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; and the debut of Spectrum HoloByte&#x27;s &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot;, among others.&quot; Describing the situation, Johnny L. Wilson of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote, &quot;The games that sell big are the ones that allow you to blow stuff up, so, if anything, that could be a problem for &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;.&quot; Doug Church explained that, because the game did not feature combat and bore little resemblance to &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;, the team spent &quot;many late nights&quot; on marketing strategies. However, he noted that the game had a wide appeal among those who tested it during development, which he called &quot;a really good sign&quot;. Talking to Bernie Yee of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;, Paul Neurath said that he thought the game would sell well. Yee noted that Neurath &quot;fully [expected] it to prove more popular than &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;&quot;.

In January 1995, Looking Glass showed &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; alongside &quot;Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri&quot; at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, under their &quot;Immersive Reality&quot; marketing label. In March 1995, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that the team was performing &quot;11th hour checks&quot; of the game to prepare it for shipment to a Midwestern United States Compact Disc manufacturer. According to the newspaper, Looking Glass planned to begin by shipping 100,000 units to retailers in Canada and the United States. Another 100,000 copies were to be sent to France, Germany and the United Kingdom at a later date. However, upon the game&#x27;s June 7, 1995 release for MS-DOS, 200,000 units were distributed simultaneously in the United States and Europe. The game&#x27;s European releases were localized with German, French and English text and voice acting, which was made possible by &quot;close coordination with international partners&quot;. Versions for Macintosh and Windows 95 were later released; the former was shown at the Macworld Expo in April 1996.

==Reception==
&quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; was a commercial success. It debuted in twelfth place on a June 1995 sales chart compiled by NPD Group, while &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1&quot; took first place. The game went on to sell more than 300,000 copies by 1997, and more than 780,000 by 2002. According to Constantine von Hoffman of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; successfully competed with &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s Lee Buchanan wrote that it &quot;soars above the pack of flight simulations&quot;, and he considered it to be &quot;the most fun [he had] had in a computerized cockpit&quot;. Frank Vizard of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; hailed it as &quot;the new top gun of flight simulators&quot;, and Doug Bailey of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; considered it to be the &quot;first real serious challenge to Microsoft&#x27;s dominance of the genre&quot;. &quot;The Record&quot;″s David Noack believed that the game&#x27;s physics and stereoscopic terrain set &quot;a new standard in flight simulation&quot;. Writing for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, Bob and John Nolan stated, &quot;If anything, you should at least take a look at this product, because you&#x27;ll be looking at the future of simulations.&quot; 

The game was a finalist in the 12th Annual Awards for Technical Excellence held by &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, whose staff called it &quot;the simulator by which all others will be judged.&quot; It was named the best simulation of 1995 by &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; (tied with &quot;Apache&quot;), and the best of 1996 by &quot;Macworld&quot;, whose editor Steven Levy wrote that it &quot;puts you in touch with what makes flying special.&quot; Inside Mac Games and &quot;PC Gamer&quot; both nominated &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; as the simulation of the year, although it lost these awards to &quot;A-10 Cuba!&quot; and &quot;Apache&quot;, respectively.

===Design===
Vizard stated that &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;″s &quot;very advanced computational fluid dynamics make [each] plane react according to spec&quot;. Buchanan lauded the fluid model for creating a &quot;sensation of actual flight [that] is nothing short of magnificent&quot;, while &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s staff commented that it makes &quot;planes behave more like real aircraft than any simulator we have seen&quot;. Bob and John Nolan called the game&#x27;s physics programming &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, and Chris Ware of the &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot; found the game to be the most accurate simulation of flight beyond &quot;those multimillion-dollar flight simulators [used by] fighter pilots and astronauts&quot;. Noack agreed: he wrote that the game &quot;is about as close to flying within going to the airport&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; presented &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; with a Special Artistic Achievement Award For Physical Model. The magazine&#x27;s staff praised Blackley&#x27;s programming for pushing the genre &quot;higher into the realm of simulation&quot;, and listed the game&#x27;s sophisticated physics model as #5 on its list of &quot;the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming&quot;.

Ware found &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; approachable and noted its &quot;simplicity of use and depth of instruction&quot;. Buchanan hailed the lesson mode as &quot;a dream come true for any budding pilot&quot;. A writer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the game &quot;[the] world&#x27;s first truly easy-to-use flight simulator&quot; and &quot;a good entry product&quot;, in which &quot;rank amateurs can just launch the program and start cruising immediately&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s John Gaudiosi wrote that, while many games in the genre are overly complex, &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; lets &quot;those who aren&#x27;t rocket scientists ... experience the thrills of stunt flying.&quot; He found its control scheme simple to understand. By contrast, Bailey found the game difficult and initially &quot;frustrating&quot;: he complained that he had to play the lesson mode before even taking off. Denny Atkin of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; characterized the game&#x27;s learning curve as steep, thanks to the accuracy of the physics programming, but he noted the scalable difficulty options. Bailey later recommended the game in a holiday shopping guide. He wrote that &quot;it can be difficult to master. But once you&#x27;re up, it&#x27;s worth the trouble.&quot;

A writer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commented that &quot;serious flight freaks will like the racing and advanced maneuvers&quot;. According to Gaudiosi, dedicated players will learn &quot;all about aerodynamics and stunt flying&quot;; he considered the latter to be &quot;hard stuff, even with green hoops guiding you&quot;. Similarly, Buchanan characterized the Hoops courses as &quot;incredibly demanding&quot;, and Atkin cited that mode&#x27;s Trick difficulty level as &quot;amazingly tough&quot;. Bob and John Nolan wrote that people who &quot;love to loop around the skies of &quot;Flight Simulator 5&quot; will go bananas for&quot; the aerobatics; but the pair commented that combat flight simulator players &quot;might get a little edgy once the wow-power wears off.&quot; However, Atkin believed that only those &quot;never happy without something to shoot at&quot; could be disappointed by the lack of combat: other players will &quot;be too busy choreographing aerial ballets, pulling off death-defying aerobatic stunts, or just enjoying a quiet soar down the ridge line to miss that stuff&quot;. Likewise, Ware called the non-violent gameplay &quot;refreshing&quot;, and Buchanan wrote, &quot;If [you are] a battle-weary veteran of air combat sims, &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; might be just the sort of [rest and relaxation] you need.&quot;

===Presentation===
Atkin found the cockpit and terrain graphics to look &quot;almost real&quot;. He commented, &quot;Every few years a sim comes along that lets reviewers use the &#x27;sets new standards for graphics&#x27; cliché, and &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; is the 1995 entry in this club.&quot; Bob and John Nolan called &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; &quot;the ultimate show off piece for your new Pentium&quot;, thanks to &quot;unbelievable&quot; graphics superior to those of any other computer game. Gaudiosi concurred: he characterized the visuals as &quot;photo-sharp&quot; and &quot;better than any I have seen&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s staff found the graphics &quot;impressive&quot; and &quot;even more stunning than those in &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;&quot;. Ware noted the &quot;stunning 3-D photo-realistic scenery&quot;, while Bailey stated that the &quot;graphics are brilliantly rendered and whiz by smoothly&quot;. Buchanan called &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;″s terrain &quot;just superb&quot; and Vizard described it as &quot;amazingly real&quot;. Buchanan believed that &quot;what you hear in &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; is every bit as good as what you see&quot;, thanks to &quot;utterly convincing&quot; sound effects. Atkin praised the instructor as &quot;one of the best uses of voice ever in a multimedia title&quot;.

Bailey wrote that the game needs &quot;a real beefy machine&quot; to run properly; Atkin stated that the &quot;massive horsepower requirement will restrict many gamers to lower resolutions and detail levels&quot;. Bob and John Nolan similarly found that the game &quot;hogs computing power&quot;. Buchanan wrote that the system requirements listed on the back of the game&#x27;s box &quot;must be a joke&quot;, and that a high-performance computer is necessary to run the game. In 1996, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; presented the game with a &quot;Special Achievement in Graphics&quot; award. The editors wrote, &quot;While it requires the most sophisticated computer hardware on the market to be enjoyed, &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; rewards gamers with some of the most stunning scenery ever seen in a flight sim.&quot;

==Aftermath==
&quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; was the first of three self-published titles released by Looking Glass Technologies. However, the next two products, &quot;Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri&quot; (1996) and &quot;British Open Championship Golf&quot; (1997), were commercial failures. As a result, the company ceased self-publishing and was left in dire financial circumstances. Doug Church later explained that Looking Glass&#x27; attempt to publish came at a difficult time for the video game industry: &quot;the other mid-sized publishers were mostly going out of business or getting bought&quot;. He believed that the company had been &quot;overreaching itself&quot; with the venture, and that it was &quot;being a little overambitious and a little cocky&quot;.

===Sequels===
&quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; was intended to be followed by a combat-oriented sequel, which was developed under the working title &quot;Flight Combat&quot;. In 1995, Seamus Blackley told &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; that he wanted the game to &quot;feel so real that pilots will be afraid. They&#x27;ll &quot;feel&quot; the gun hits.&quot; Talking to &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, he stated that the game would teach players the &quot;same curriculum [as] the Air Force&quot;, and that it would feature competitive online play. However, a company manager, newly instated by venture capital investors who disliked Looking Glass&#x27; management style, instead demanded that Blackley create a direct sequel to &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot;. The two argued regularly, and Blackley later accused the manager of &quot;ripp[ing] the guts out of Looking Glass&quot;. In response to Blackley&#x27;s refusal to create &quot;Flight Unlimited II&quot;, the manager fired him. Blackley left the company in late 1995 with designer Austin Grossman, and both were hired by DreamWorks Interactive to create &quot;Jurassic Park: Trespasser&quot;. He later spearheaded development of the Xbox at Microsoft.

Constantine Hantzopoulos directed &quot;Flight Unlimited II&quot;, which was published by Eidos Interactive in 1997. The team could not continue using the real-time computational fluid dynamics of &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; because, according to Hantzopoulos, it was &quot;all black box spaghetti code from Seamus&quot;. The aerobatics focus of its predecessor was dropped in favor of general civilian aviation. The development of &quot;Flight Combat&quot; was hinted at during the production of &quot;Flight Unlimited II&quot;. A third game, &quot;Flight Unlimited III&quot;, was published by Electronic Arts in 1999; and it continued the focus on general aviation. That year, &quot;Flight Combat&quot; was officially announced as the World War II-themed, Electronic Arts-published &quot;Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe&quot;, but its name was eventually changed to &quot;Jane&#x27;s Attack Squadron&quot;. The game was canceled as a consequence of Looking Glass Studios&#x27; closure in 2000. However, it was later finished by developer Mad Doc Software and released in 2002 by publisher Xicat Interactive.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 405, also known as Highway 405 and the General Brock Parkway, is a 400-Series Highway in the Canadian province of Ontario connecting the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) near St. Catharines with the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge in the village of Queenston. It then crosses the Niagara River, where it encounters the international border with the United States and continues into New York as Interstate 190 (I-190).

Designated and under construction by 1960, the short freeway was opened to traffic on September 11, 1963. On August 13, 2006, Highway 405 was dedicated the General Brock Parkway. The entire length of Highway 405 is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP).

== Route description ==
Highway 405 serves to connect the northern end of I-190 in New York at the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge with the QEW, and therefore it follows a somewhat direct path between the two.
Throughout its length, the highway gently climbs the Niagara Escarpment, reaching the top east of Stanley Avenue before crossing the Niagara Gorge. The highway is surrounded by forest to either side for most of its length, and the only settlement near it is the village of Queenston. As Highway 405 entirely lies within the Province of Ontario and is not subject to federal administration, its entire length is patrolled by the OPP.

Highway 405 begins by diverging from the QEW at St. Catharines. It continues north-east for , then gently curves south-easterly. The opposing lanes, initially separated by a wide gap, converge towards each other to form a grass median.
The highway dips into a shallow gully, widens to five lanes (three eastbound, two westbound), and then curves northeast to pass north of a hydroelectric reservoir for the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations. The opposing lanes converge, with an Ontario Tall Wall separating them, and pass beneath Niagara Regional Road 102 (Stanley Avenue). The freeway&#x27;s lone interchange is with Stanley Avenue, and traffic continuing east must cross the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge into the United States. The additional eastbound lane provided along this section is for the queueing of trucks.
After passing the reservoir, the highway reaches the Canada Border Services plaza. It then passes over the Niagara Parkway and heads onto the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge over the Niagara River. The Highway 405 designation ends at the border with the United States, where it continues as I-190 towards Buffalo, New York.

== History ==

Highway 405 was part of a network of divided highways envisioned by Thomas McQuesten in the mid-1930s to connect New York with Ontario. Though the Queen Elizabeth Way would cross the Niagara River by 1942 in Niagara Falls, Highway 405 and the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge would form the first direct freeway link between the neighbouring countries. Planning for both was underway by 1958, and construction began in 1960.
The bridge was built at the same time as the freeway, though it opened several months earlier on November 1, 1962.
Highway 405 was completed in August 1963
and officially opened to the public on September 11, 1963. In 1969, an interchange with Stanley Avenue was built and opened to traffic.

In 2004, the eastern end of the freeway was modified to permit the queueing of trucks at the border, with the addition of one lane to the eastbound carriageway beginning at Stanley Avenue. The reconstruction of the toll plaza resulted in the gradual removal of the interchange with the Niagara Parkway, with the westbound off-ramp to the Parkway remaining open to traffic until December 4, 2006, thereafter westbound motorists have to head west to the Stanley Avenue exit and take Portage Road in order to reach the Parkway.

The highway was named the General Brock Parkway on October 13, 2006 in honour of the War of 1812 hero, Major General Sir Isaac Brock, who died at the Battle of Queenston Heights.

<doc id="1214679" wikidata="Q3574774" url="?curid=1214679" title="Zantafio">
<text>Zantafio is a recurring fictional antagonist in the &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; comic book series. He was created by André Franquin and first appeared in &quot;Spirou et les héritiers&quot; (1952). Zantafio bears a strong resemblance to Fantasio, because they are cousins. In &quot;Le dictateur et le champignon&quot; (1953), he is a South-American dictator of the fictional country Palombia.

==Character evolution==
Zantafio first appears at an inheritance contest, arrogant and in debt. He and Fantasio are the only heirs, and he who wins three challenges wins the inheritance. After continually employing dirty tactics and still losing, Zantafio admits defeat, claiming to see the errors of his cheating ways, and feels guilty about it. The cousins part on good terms while searching for the Marsupilami in the Palombian rainforest.

Yet, Zantafio, under the alias of &quot;General Zantas&quot;, returns as the dictator of the country, much to the surprise of Spirou and Fantasio. He offers Spirou and Fantasio a place within his army, but they are repulsed by Zantafio&#x27;s change in personality. No longer friendly, Zantafio becomes merciless, brutal, and drunk on power. Spirou and Fantasio, with the inventions of the Count of Champignac, initiate a revolt in Palombia. During the revolution, Zantafio is ousted from power and disappears into the jungle.

Zantafio later strikes back at his cousin by framing him for thievery. He employs special henchmen to impersonate him and therefore disgrace him, but Spirou manages to foil his plans. Zantafio continues to return several times as the nemesis antagonist, exploring many variants of crime. He even becomes Zorglub&#x27;s second-in-command and then tries to replace him to gain power in &quot;L&#x27;ombre du Z&quot; (1956).

When Fournier took over the series, the criminal organisation known as the Triangle became the main recurring antagonist focus of the series. In &quot;Tora Torapa&quot; (1973), Zantafio returns as leader of the Triangle.

After Fournier left the series, Zantafio disappeared for a long time as well: the new creative team of Broca &amp; Cauvin created new villains for their short run and their successors Tome &amp; Janry started out their run creating own villains well. Their &quot;La jeunesse de Spirou&quot; included a story from the spin-off series &quot;Le Petit Spirou&quot;, which showed Zantafio as a child (but still wearing a moustache), but this story was done for comedic purposes. In &quot;Spirou à Moscou&quot; (1990), Zantafio returns, as the &quot;White Prince of the Russian Mafia&quot;, attempting to become the new Tsar of Russia. He uses the alias, as well as the anagram, &quot;Tanaziof&quot;.

When Morvan and Munuera took over as Spirou creative team, Zantafio returned in their second issue, &quot;L&#x27;homme qui ne voulait pas mourir&quot; (2005).

<text>A beer bong is a device composed of a funnel attached to a tube used to facilitate the rapid consumption of beer. The use of a beer bong is also known as funneling.

== Construction ==
The typical construction of a beer bong involves a large funnel connected to tubing. Beers are stockpiled in the funnel and as the user drinks, the beer will pour down the tubing. Beer bongs often have valves to engage/disengage the flow of beer.

== Use ==
=== Typical oral ===

One person holds a clear pipe to their mouth, while a second holds the other end of the pipe with a large plastic funnel attached. The pipe is part-filled with beer, with the remainder of the pipe and the bottom of the funnel filling with a foamy head.

Drinking from a beer bong is different from drinking beer normally (or other carbonated beverage). This is because the drinker is not in control of the volume of liquid entering the mouth. In addition, the force of gravity pushes the beer into the drinker&#x27;s mouth and thus &#x27;forces&#x27; the beer down. It is for this reason the beer bong often engages the gag reflex.

The beer bong is either &#x27;hit&#x27; or &#x27;chugged&#x27;. A hit from the beer bong is when a valve is used and one drinks as much beer as they can before turning off the valve. Chugging is where an entire, or a number of beers are consumed in one use. A popular technique is to &#x27;open&#x27; the esophagus and simply allow the beer to flow down. This takes practice and may cause pain in trying it for the first time.

=== Alternate rectal ===
Occasionally the pipe is inserted rectally to administer an alcohol enema. Called butt-chugging or boofing, this method of alcohol consumption can be dangerous or even deadly because it leads to faster intoxication since the alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream and bypasses the body&#x27;s ability to reject the toxin by vomiting.

== In popular culture ==
Beer bongs came to national attention in the US in 2006 after a photograph of Senator John Kerry being offered one by a University of Iowa journalism major at a tailgate party made national newspaper front pages.

<text>John Walter III (8 October 1818 – 3 November 1894) was an English newspaper publisher and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1847 and 1885.

Walter was born at Printing-house Square, the eldest son of John Walter, editor of &quot;The Times&quot;. He was educated at Eton and Exeter College, Oxford, being called to the bar in 1847. On leaving Oxford he took part in the business management of &quot;The Times&quot;, and on his father&#x27;s death became sole manager, delegating some of his work to Mowbray Morris. He was a man of scholarly tastes and serious religious views, and his conscientious character had a marked influence on the tone of the paper. It was under him that the successive improvements in the printing machinery, begun by his father in 1814, at last reached the stage of the &quot;Walter Press&quot; in 1869, the pioneer of modern newspaper printing-presses.

In 1847 Walter was elected to Parliament for Nottingham as a moderate Liberal, and was re-elected in 1852 and in 1857. In 1859 he was returned for Berkshire, where he lived at Bearwood House in Sindlesham. John Walter built a model village arranged around a green at Sindlesham, whose buildings included a &quot;typically solid Victorian building&quot; which housed a pub and still bears the family name today, as the Walter Arms.

Though defeated in 1865, John Walter III was again elected to Parliament for Berkshire in 1868, and held the seat until he retired in 1885.

Walter was twice married, first in 1842 to Emily Frances Court (d. 1858), and then in 1861 to Flora Macnab. His eldest son by his first marriage, John, was accidentally drowned at Bearwood on Christmas Eve in 1870, while trying to rescue his brother and cousin.

Walter was succeeded by Arthur Fraser Walter (1846–1910), his second son by his first marriage. A.F. Walter remained chief proprietor of &quot;The Times&quot; until 1908, when it was converted into a company. He then became chairman of the board of directors, and on his death was succeeded in this position by his son John.

<doc id="1214686" wikidata="Q5365350" url="?curid=1214686" title="Witr">
<text>Witr () is an Islamic prayer (&quot;salat&quot;) that is performed at night after &quot;Isha&quot; (night-time prayer) or before &quot;fajr&quot; (dawn prayer). Witr has an odd number of &quot;raka&#x27;at&quot; prayed in pairs, with the final raka&#x27;ah prayed separately.

According to Abdullah ibn Umar, Muhammad: &quot;The night prayer is offered as two raka&#x27;at followed by two raka&#x27;at and so on and if anyone is afraid of the approaching dawn (fajr prayer), he should pray one raka&#x27;ah and this will be a witr for all the raka&#x27;at which he has prayed before.&quot;

In a &quot;hadith&quot; transmitted by Abu Darda, he states that Muhammad told him to do three things: to fast three days every month, to offer the witr salat before sleep, and to offer two raka&#x27;at sunnah for fajr.

There &quot;is a ḥādīth&quot; that says that the best time for the witr salat is at night, and that those who fear that they will not be able to awake, or may die in their sleep, should perform the prayer before sleeping.

Ali ibn Abi Talib said, &quot;The witr prayer is not required like your obligatory prayers but the Prophet would perform the witr prayer and say, &#x27;O you people of the Quran, perform the witr prayer, for Allah is One and He loves the witr.&#x27;&quot;(this is daif (Weak, and hence unreliable) 

== Du&#x27;ā&#x27; Salātu &#x27;l-Witr ==
Narrated by Al-Hasan ibn Ali (who is the grandson of Muhammad) he said he was taught by Muhammad to say the &quot;qunūt du‘ā’&quot; in Arabic as follows:

اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنِي فِيمَنْ هَدَيْتَ وَعَافِنِي فِيمَنْ عَافَيْتَ وَتَوَلَّنِي فِيمَنْ تَوَلَّيْتَ وَبَارِكْ لِي فِيمَا أَعْطَيْتَ وَقِنِي شَرَّ مَا قَضَيْتَ إِنَّكَ تَقْضِي وَلاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْكَ وَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَذِلُّ مَنْ وَّالَيْتَ وَلاَ يَعِزُّ مَنْ عَادَيْتَ تَبَارَكْتَ رَبَّنَا وَتَعَالَيْتَ

&quot;Allahumma ’hdi-niy fiyman hadayt, wa-‘āfi-niy fiyman ‘āfayt, wa-tawalla-niy fiyman tawallayt, wa-bārik liy fiy-mā ’a‘ṭayt, wa-qiniy sharra mā qadhayt, inna-ka taqdiy wa-lā yuqdhā ‘alayk, wa-inna-hu lā yaḏillu maw wālayt, wa-lā ya‘izzu man ‘ādayt, tabārakta Rabba-nā wa-ta‘ālayt&quot;.

“O Allah guide me among those You have guided, pardon me among those You have pardoned, befriend me among those You have befriended, bless me in what You have granted, and save me from the evil that You decreed. Indeed You decree, and none can pass decree, and none can pass decree upon You, indeed he is not humiliated whom You have befriended, blessed are You our Lord and Exalted.”

Followers of the Hanafi school of thought commonly recite a second version of supplication of Witr prayer (Arabic:دعاء صلاة الوتر &quot;du‘ā’ ṣalātu ’l-Witr&quot;) as follows, which is said in the last raka‘at of &quot;witr&quot; (since one raka&#x27;at follows the Sunnah, in this case performing in odd numbers - 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11 raka&#x27;ats)&quot;,&quot; first by saying &quot;takbir&quot; with hands up, then saying the following verses while standing after the last &quot;ruku‘&quot; and before Prostration:

اَللَّهُمَّ إنا نَسْتَعِينُكَ وَنَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَنُؤْمِنُ بِكَ ,وَنَتَوَكَّلُ عَلَيْكَ, وَنُثْنِئْ عَلَيْكَ الخَيْرَ. وَنَشْكُرُكَ وَلَا نَكْفُرُكَ وَنَخْلَعُ وَنَتْرُكُ مَنْ يَّفْجُرُكَ. اَللَّهُمَّ إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ, وَلَكَ نُصَلِّئ وَنَسْجُدُ, وَإِلَيْكَ نَسْعأئ وَنَحْفِدُ, وَنَرْجُو رَحْمَتَكَ وَنَخْشآئ عَذَابَكَ, إِنَّ عَذَابَكَ بِالكُفَّارِ مُلْحَقٌ

&quot;Allahumma in-nā nasta‘iynu-ka wa-nastaghfiru-ka wa-nu’minu bi-ka, wa-natawaku ‘alay-ka, wa-nuth-nī ‘alay-ka ’l-khayr(a). Wa-nashkuru-ka wa-lā nakfuru-ka wa-nakhla‘u wa-natru-ku may yafjuru-k(a). Allahumma iyya-ka na‘abudu, wa-laka nuṣallī wa-nasjudu, wa-ilay-ka nas‘ā wa-naḥfidu, wa-narjū raḥmataka wa nakhshā ‘azaba-k(a), in-nā ‘azaba-ka bi’l-kuffāri mulhiq.&quot;

&quot;O Allah! We invoke you for help, and beg for forgiveness, and we believe in you and have trust in you and we praise you, in the best way we can; and we thank you and we are not ungrateful to you, and we forsake and turn away from the one who disobeys you. O Allah! We worship you and prostrate ourselves before you, and we hasten towards you and serve you, and we hope to receive your mercy and we dread your torment. Surely, the disbelievers shall incur your torment.&quot;

Ibn ‘Uqayl al-Hanbali narrated that duas narrated from Muhammad should be what is recited as regular word, and anything added to it is by way of a concession. He said: What is &quot;mustahabb&quot; in our view is that which was narrated by al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali from the Prophet (SWS): “&quot;Allahumma ihdini&quot;…” – the well-known &quot;hadīth&quot;.

He said: &quot;If one adds to that the words narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), “&quot;Allahumma in-nā nasta‘iynu-ka&quot;… (O Allah, we seek Your help)…”, there is nothing wrong with that. End quote.&quot;

This was quoted by Ibn Muflih in his comment on al-Muharrar, 1/89

In some cases, the one who prays can perform the &quot;du‘ā’ ṣalātu ’l-Witr&quot;, it is permissible to make the &quot;qunūt&quot; before going into &quot;ruku‘&quot; (bowing), or it may be recited when one stands up straight after the &quot;ruku‘&quot;.

&quot;&quot;Humaid says: &quot;I asked Anas: &#x27;Is the qunut before or after the ruku?&#x27; he said: &#x27;We would do it before or after.&quot;&quot;

This hadith was related by Ibn Majah and Muhammad ibn Nasr. In Fath al-Bari, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani comments that its chain is faultless.

<doc id="1214697" wikidata="Q910009" url="?curid=1214697" title="Wet-bulb globe temperature">
<text>The wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a measure of environmental heat as it affects humans. Unlike a simple temperature measurement, WBGT accounts for all four major environmental heat factors: air temperature, humidity, radiant heat (from sunlight or sources such as furnaces), and air movement (wind or ventilation). It is used by industrial hygienists, athletes, sporting events and the military to determine appropriate exposure levels to high temperatures.

A WBGT meter combines three sensors, a dry-bulb thermometer, a natural (static) wet-bulb thermometer, and a black globe thermometer.

For outdoor environments, the meter uses all sensor data inputs, calculating WBGT as:

:formula_1

where 
* &quot;T&quot;w = Natural wet-bulb temperature (combined with dry-bulb temperature indicates humidity)
* &quot;T&quot;g = Globe thermometer temperature (measured with a globe thermometer, also known as a black globe thermometer)
* &quot;T&quot;d = Dry-bulb temperature (actual air temperature)
* Temperatures may be in either Celsius or Fahrenheit

Indoors the following formula is used:
:formula_2

If a meter is not available, the WBGT can be calculated from current or historic weather data. A clothing adjustment may be added to the WBGT to determine the &quot;effective WBGT&quot;, WBGTeff.

==Uses==
The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists publishes threshold limit values (TLVs) that have been adopted by many governments for use in the workplace. The process for determining the WBGT is also described in ISO 7243, Hot Environments - Estimation of the Heat Stress on Working Man, Based on the WBGT Index. The American College of Sports Medicine bases its guidelines on the intensity of sport practices based on WBGT.

In hot areas, some US military installations display a flag to indicate the heat category based on the WBGT. The military publishes guidelines for water intake and physical activity level for acclimated and unacclimated individuals in different uniforms based on the heat category. The University of Georgia adapted these categories for use in college sports as a guideline for how strenuous practices can be.

==Related temperature comfort measures==
The heat index used by the U.S. National Weather Service and the humidex used by the Meteorological Service of Canada, along with the wind chill used in both countries, are also measures of perceived heat or cold, but they do not account for the effects of radiation.

The NWS office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in conjunction with Oral Roberts University&#x27;s mathematics department, published an approximation formula to the WBGT that takes into account cloud cover and wind speed; in limited experimentation (four samples), the office claimed the estimate was regularly accurate to within , even with a simplification that reduces the equation from a four-degree polynomial to a linear relationship (the authors noted that the linear approximation was not tested for air temperatures under since the WBGT is designed to measure heat stress, which seldom occurs below that threshold).

<text>Patrick Joseph Bugden, VC (17 March 1897 – 28 September 1917) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He served during the First World War in the 31st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force and was killed during the Battle of Polygon Wood during which he displayed the bravery for which he was posthumously awarded the VC.

==Early life==
Patrick Bugden was born in the Australian state of New South Wales, at South Gundurimba on 17 March 1897. His father, a farmer, died when Bugden was still a child and his mother later remarried. After completing his schooling, he worked at a hotel in Alstonville. In 1911, he commenced a year of compulsory military service.

==First World War==
Bugden enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at Brisbane on 25 May 1916, claiming to be 21 years old. After completing a period of basic training, he embarked for England in September 1916 and arrived in Plymouth in December. Shortly afterwards he was admitted to hospital sick, before being sent to France in January 1917 and being taken on strength by the 31st Battalion in March. In May 1917, he was again admitted to hospital with influenza, before being released and returning to his unit.

It was at Battle of Polygon Wood near Zonnebeke in Belgium, during the Passchendaele Offensive in the period from 26 September to 28 September 1917 that Bugden performed the actions that led to his posthumous award of the Victoria Cross. During an advance by his battalion at Polygon Wood, he led small parties against strongly defended pillboxes, successfully dealing with them. He later carried out a number of rescues of wounded men, often under heavy artillery and machine gun fire. He was killed during one of these rescue missions. He was later recommended for the VC; the citation, published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, read:

===Memorials===
Bugden is buried at Hooge Crater Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery. In 1997, a memorial to his service was dedicated at Alstonville, about 30 km from Tatham. The memorial is on Bugden Avenue, and the local ANZAC Day march starts there.

Bugden Avenue in the Canberra suburb of Gowrie is also named for him. 
The Patrick Bugden VC Club is situated on the grounds of the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, in Townsville.

==The medal==
Bugden&#x27;s VC is on display in the Queensland Museum, South Bank. He was also entitled to the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.

<text>Acacia Prison is a medium security prison facility located in Wooroloo, Western Australia. The prison was opened in May 2001.

Acacia was the first privately managed prison in Western Australia and was managed by Australian Integration Management Services Corporation (AIMS Corp) for its first five years of operation. Serco began managing the prison in 2006. The prison employs over 300 custodial officers and more than 200 non-custodial staff to run day-to-day operation.

The prison provides open campus-style living. Prisoners use fingerprint recognition technology to move within the boundaries of the prison as well as gaining access to their bank accounts and purchasing goods. The prison has a self-care and pre-self care section where prisoners cook and clean for themselves. In 2008 the prison began adding additional bunks to cells, increasing capacity from 800 to 1000.

Acacia Prison has an education unit run by custodial and non-custodial staff including teachers, psychologists, criminologists, resettlement staff and reintegration officers. They teach a range of classes including violence against women, violent offender treatment programs, domestic violence, drug and alcohol programs and &quot;think first&quot; classes.

Serco won the contract to operate the prison after a tender that involved submissions from AIMS, MTC and Serco. Serco&#x27;s contract went out for tender on 16 May 2016.

In August 2021, a riot broke out at the prison with the Special Operations Group storming the prison after negotiations with prisoners who had barricaded themselves in one of the units had failed. Over 50 prisoners were inside the unit at the time. The Department of Justice in investigating Serco following the incident.

<doc id="1214710" wikidata="Q514921" url="?curid=1214710" title="Craniotomy">
<text>A craniotomy is a surgical operation in which a bone flap is temporarily removed from the skull to access the brain. Craniotomies are often critical operations, performed on patients who are suffering from brain lesions, such as tumors, blood clots, removal of foreign bodies such as bullets, or traumatic brain injury, and can also allow doctors to surgically implant devices, such as deep brain stimulators for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, epilepsy, and cerebellar tremor. The procedure is also used in epilepsy surgery to remove the parts of the brain that are causing epilepsy.

Craniotomy is distinguished from craniectomy (in which the skull flap is not immediately replaced, allowing the brain to swell, thus reducing intracranial pressure) and from trepanation, the creation of a burr hole through the cranium into the dura mater.

==Procedure==

Human craniotomy is usually performed under general anesthesia but can be also done with the patient awake using a local anaesthetic; the procedure, typically, does not involve significant discomfort for the patient. In general, a craniotomy will be preceded by an MRI scan which provides an image of the human brain (brain in general) that the surgeon uses to plan the precise location for bone removal and the appropriate angle of access to the relevant brain areas. The amount of skull that needs to be removed depends on the type of surgery being performed. The bone flap is mostly removed with the help of a cranial drill and a craniotome, then replaced using titanium plates and screws or another form of fixation (wire, suture, etc.) after completion of the surgical procedure. In the event the host bone does not accept its replacement, an artificial piece of skull, often made of PEEK, is substituted. (The PEEK appliance is routinely modeled by a CNC machine capable of accepting a high resolution MRI computer file in order to provide a very close fit, in an effort to minimize fitment issues, and therefore minimizing the duration of the cranial surgery.)

==Complications==

Bacterial meningitis or viral meningitis occurs in about 0.8 to 1.5% of individuals undergoing craniotomy. Postcraniotomy pain is frequent and moderate to severe in nature. This pain has been controlled through the use of scalp infiltrations, nerve scalp blocks, parecoxib, and morphine, morphine being the most effective in providing analgesia.

According to the Journal of Neurosurgery, &quot;Infections in patients undergoing craniotomy: risk factors associated with post-craniotomy meningitis&quot;, their clinical studies indicated that &quot;the risk for meningitis was independently associated with perioperative steroid use and ventricular drainage&quot;.

Within the 334 procedures that they had conducted from males and females, their results concluded that traumatic brain injuries were the predominant causes of bacterial meningitis.

At least 40% of patients became susceptible to at least one infection, creating more interconnected risk factors along the way. From the Infectious Diseases Clinic Erasme Hospital, there had been reports of infections initially beginning from either the time of surgery, skin intrusion, hematogenous seeding, or retrograde infections.

Cerebrospinal fluid shunt (CSF) associates with the risk of meningitis due to the following factors: pre-shunt associated infections, post-operative CSF leakage, lack of experience from the neurosurgeon, premature birth/young age, advanced age, shunt revisions for dysfunction, and neuroendoscopes.

The way shunts are operated on each patient relies heavily on the cleanliness of the site. Once bacteria penetrates the area of a CSF, the procedure becomes more complicated.

The skin is especially necessary to address because it is an external organ. Scratching the incision site can easily create an infection due to there being no barrier between the open air and wound.

Aside from scratching, decubitus ulcer and tissues near the shunt site are also leading pathways for infection susceptibility.

It is also common to give patients seven days of anti-seizure medications post operatively. Traditionally this has been phenytoin, but now is increasingly levetiracetam as it has a lower risk of drug-drug interactions.

<doc id="1214719" wikidata="Q5612782" url="?curid=1214719" title="William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper">
<text>William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper, ( ; 10 October 1723) was an English politician who became the first Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. Cowper was the son of Sir William Cowper, 2nd Baronet, of Ratling Court, Kent, a Whig member of parliament of some mark in the two last Stuart reigns.

==Career and titles==
Cowper was educated at St Albans School in Hertfordshire, and was later to acquire a country estate in the county and represent the county town in Parliament.
He was admitted to Middle Temple on 18 March 1681/82, was called to the bar on 25 May 1688, and built up a large practice. He gave his allegiance to the Prince of Orange on his landing in England in 1688, and was made King&#x27;s Counsel and recorder of Colchester in 1694.

Cowper had the reputation of being one of the most effective parliamentary orators of his generation. He lost his seat in parliament in 1702 owing to the unpopularity caused by the trial of his brother Spencer Cowper on a charge of murder.

===Lord Keeper of the Great Seal===
On 11 October 1705 he was sworn to the Privy Council, was appointed Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and took his seat on the woolsack without a peerage. In the following year he conducted the negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners for arranging the union with Scotland. In November of that year he succeeded to his father&#x27;s baronetcy, and on 14 December 1706, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cowper of Wingham, Kent. He was the youngest Lord Keeper for many years: the Queen, who had taken a great liking to him, joked that &quot;she had given the Seals to a boy&quot; and suggested that in future he should wear a wig to lend him gravity.

===Lord High Chancellor===
When the union with Scotland came into operation in May 1707 the Queen in Council named Cowper Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, he being the first to hold this office. He presided at the trial of Dr Sacheverell in 1710, but resigned the seal when Harley and Bolingbroke took office in the same year. Queen Anne, who had high regard for him, &quot;begged him with tears in her eyes&quot; not to resign, and though she was reluctantly persuaded to accept his resignation, continued to consult him unofficially for the remainder of her reign. On the death of Queen Anne, George I appointed Cowper one of the Lords Justice for governing the country during the king&#x27;s absence, and a few weeks later he again became Lord Chancellor.

===Lord High Steward===
A paper which Cowper drew up for the guidance of the new king on constitutional matters, entitled &quot;An Impartial History of Parties&quot;, marks the advance of English opinion towards party government in the modern sense. It was published by Lord Campbell in his &quot;Lives of the Lord Chancellors&quot;. Cowper supported the impeachment of Lord Oxford for high treason in 1715, and in 1716 presided as Lord High Steward at the trials of the peers charged with complicity in the Jacobite rising, his sentences on whom have been censured as unnecessarily severe. He warmly supported the Septennial Bill in the same year.

===Viscount Fordwich and Earl Cowper===
On 18 March 1718 he was created Viscount Fordwich and Earl Cowper, and a month later he resigned office on the plea of ill-health, but probably in reality because George I accused him of espousing the Prince of Wales&#x27;s side in the prince&#x27;s quarrel with the king. Taking the lead against his former colleagues, Cowper opposed the proposed Peerage Bill brought forward in 1719 to limit the number of peers, and also opposed the bill of attainder against Atterbury in 1723. Cowper was not a great lawyer, but Burnet says that he managed the Court of Chancery with impartial justice and great despatch; the most eminent of his contemporaries agreed in extolling his oratory and his virtues. It is notable that Queen Anne, despite her prejudice against the Whigs in general, came to have great respect and liking for Cowper, and continued to seek his advice even after he left office as Lord Chancellor.

==Trial of Spencer Cowper==
His younger brother, Spencer Cowper (1669–1728), was tried for the murder of Sarah Stout in 1699, but was acquitted; the lady, who had allegedly fallen in love with Cowper, having committed suicide on account of his inattention—at least according to Cowper&#x27;s lawyers. Spencer was one of the managers of the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, was Attorney-General to the Prince of Wales (1714), Chief Justice of Chester (1717), and Judge of the Common Pleas (1727). He was great uncle of William Cowper, the poet.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
William Cowper was twice married: first, in about 1686, to Judith, daughter and heiress of Sir Robert Booth, a London merchant; and secondly, in 1706, to Mary, daughter of John Clavering, of Chopwell, Durham. The latter marriage seems to have been based on Cowper&#x27;s admiration of her beauty although he demanded to see her undressed before the wedding. The 1st Earl left two sons and two daughters by his second wife:

* Lady Sarah Cowper (1707–1758)
* William Clavering-Cowper (1709–1764), succeeded as 2nd Earl
* Spencer Cowper (1713–1774), Dean of Durham
* Lady Anne Cowper (died 1750), married James Colleton 

===Mistress===
Elizabeth Culling was the mistress of William Cowper, and bore him two children. She was the daughter of John Culling of Hertingfordbury Park, who died in 1687/8, and was buried in St Helen&#x27;s, Bishopsgate. Her brother John died in January 1702/3 without issue, and Elizabeth inherited the estate. She died on 27 November 1703, and was buried at Hertingfordbury. Of her children, William, born on 14 November 1697, died in Paris on 31 October 1719. Mary, born on 10 September 1700, lived to maturity, and married one Robert Isaacson.

Tory writers satirised Lord Cowper as a bigamist. In &quot;The New Atalantis&quot; by Delarivier Manley, the married Hernando eloquently persuades an impressionable young woman that double marriage is lawful, seducing her with a sham marriage ceremony. Jonathan Swift referred to Cowper as &quot;Will Bigamy&quot;. In his diary, Thomas Hearne recorded that Cowper was &quot;well known to have had two wives at a time&quot;. The rumours may have gained traction because Elizabeth Culling was of a station in life that perhaps would, in other circumstances, have led to her becoming Cowper&#x27;s wife, rather than his mistress. In her will, she acknowledges that the children are her natural children, and the children were also acknowledged by Lord Cowper and his second wife, as will be seen from the correspondence.

==Later years and death==
In his last years Cowper was accused, but probably without reason, of active sympathy with the Jacobites. He died at his residence, Cole Green near Panshanger in Hertfordshire on 10 October 1723. Mary, who was devastated by his death, outlived him by only a few months.

<doc id="1214737" wikidata="Q407569" url="?curid=1214737" title="Gluconic acid">
<text>Gluconic acid is an organic compound with molecular formula C6H12O7 and condensed structural formula HOCH2(CHOH)4CO2H. A white solid, it forms the gluconate anion in neutral aqueous solution. The salts of gluconic acid are known as &quot;gluconates&quot;. Gluconic acid, gluconate salts, and gluconate esters occur widely in nature because such species arise from the oxidation of glucose. Some drugs are injected in the form of gluconates.

==Chemical structure==
The chemical structure of gluconic acid consists of a six-carbon chain, with five hydroxyl groups positioned in the same way as in the open-chained form of glucose, terminating in a carboxylic acid group. It is one of the 16 stereoisomers of 2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid.

==Production==
Gluconic acid is typically produced by the aerobic oxidation of glucose in the presence of the enzyme glucose oxidase. The conversion produces gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide. The lactone spontaneously hydrolyzes to gluconic acid in water.
:
Variations of glucose (or other carbohydrate-containing substrate) oxidation using fermentation. or noble metal catalysis.

Gluconic acid was first prepared by Hlasiwetz and Habermann in 1870 and involved the chemical oxidation of glucose. In 1880, Boutroux prepared and isolated gluconic acid using the glucose fermentation.

===Historical role in development of deep-tank fermentation===
The production of gluconic acid by deep-tank fermentation (aerated, pH controlled, and stirred &gt;1000 L tanks) of the filamentous fungi &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; in 1929, for use as a food acidity regulator and cleaning agent, was the first successful use of deep-tank fermentation by Pfizer. This expertise later led to Pfizer&#x27;s successful use of deep-tank fermentation of &quot;Penicillium&quot; fungi in February 1944, to rapidly scale up penicillin production, resulting in sufficient penicillin to treat the American and British battle casualties of the June 6th Allied D-Day invasion of World War II.

==Occurrence and uses==
Gluconic acid occurs naturally in fruit, honey, and wine. As a food additive (E574), it is now known as an acidity regulator.

The gluconate anion chelates Ca2+, Fe2+, , Al3+, and other metals, including lanthanides and actinides. It is also used in cleaning products, where it dissolves mineral deposits, especially in alkaline solution.

Zinc gluconate injections are used to neuter male dogs.

Gluconate is also used in building and construction as a concrete admixture (retarder) to slow down the cement hydration reactions, and to delay the cement setting time. It allows for a longer time to lay the concrete, or to spread the cement hydration heat over a longer period of time to avoid too high a temperature and the resulting cracking. Retarders are mixed in to concrete when the weather temperature is high or to cast large and thick concrete slabs in successive and sufficiently well-mixed layers.

Gluconic acid aqueous solution finds application as a medium for organic synthesis.

===Medicine===
In medicine, gluconate is used most commonly as a biologically neutral carrier of , , , , and to treat electrolyte imbalance.

Calcium gluconate, in the form of a gel, is used to treat burns from hydrofluoric acid; calcium gluconate injections may be used for more severe cases to avoid necrosis of deep tissues, as well as to treat hypocalcemia in hospitalized patients. Gluconate is also an electrolyte present in certain solutions, such as &quot;plasmalyte a&quot;, used for intravenous fluid resuscitation. Quinine gluconate is a salt of gluconic acid and quinine, which is used for intramuscular injection in the treatment of malaria.

Ferrous gluconate injections have been proposed in the past to treat anemia.

<text>Edward Craven Hawtrey (7 May 178927 January 1862) was an English educationalist, headmaster and later provost of Eton College.

==Life==
Hawtrey was born at Burnham, Bucks, the son of the vicar of the parish. He was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and in 1814 was appointed assistant master at Eton under John Keate. In 1834 he became headmaster of Eton, which role he performed until 1853, when he was elected Provost of Eton following the death of Francis Hodgson. While he was headmaster and Hodgson was Provost, new buildings were erected, including the school library and the sanatorium, the college chapel was restored, the Old Christopher Inn was closed, and the custom of Montem, the collection by street begging of funds for the university expenses of the captain of the school, was suppressed.

Hawtrey is supposed to have suggested the modern language prizes given by Prince Albert, and himself founded the prize for English essay. In 1852 he became provost of Eton, and in 1854 vicar of Mapledurham. He was buried in the Eton College chapel.

On account of his command of languages, he was known in London as &quot;the English Mezzofanti&quot;, and he was a book collector of the finest taste. Among his own books are some translations from the English into Italian, German and Greek. He had a considerable reputation as a writer of English hexameters and as a judge of Homeric translation: his translation of a brief passage from the &quot;Iliad&quot; was described by Matthew Arnold, in &quot;On Translating Homer&quot;, as &quot;the most successful attempt hitherto made at rendering Homer into English&quot;.

F. D. How included Hawtrey in the 1904 book &quot;Six Great Schoolmasters&quot;.

<text>Sol Invictus (, &quot;Invincible Sun&quot; or &quot;Unconquered Sun&quot;) was the official sun god of the late Roman Empire and a later version of the god Sol. The emperor Aurelian revived his cult in 274 AD and promoted Sol Invictus as the chief god of the empire. From Aurelian onward, Sol Invictus often appeared on imperial coinage, usually shown wearing a sun crown and driving a horse-drawn chariot through the sky. His prominence lasted until the emperor Constantine I legalized Christianity and restricted paganism. The last known inscription referring to Sol Invictus dates to AD 387, although there were enough devotees in the fifth century that the Christian theologian Augustine found it necessary to preach against them.

In recent years, the scholarly community has become divided on Sol between traditionalists and a growing group of revisionists. In the traditional view, &quot;Sol Invictus&quot; was the second of two different sun gods in Rome. The first of these, &quot;Sol Indiges&quot;, or &quot;Sol&quot;, was believed to be an early Roman god of minor importance whose cult had petered out by the first century AD. &quot;Sol Invictus&quot;, on the other hand, was believed to be a Syrian sun god whose cult was first promoted in Rome under Elagabalus, without success. Some fifty years later, in 274 AD, Aurelian established the cult of &quot;Sol Invictus&quot; as an official religion. There has never been consensus on &quot;which&quot; Syrian sun god he might have been: some scholars opted for the sky god of Emesa, Elagabal, while others preferred Malakbel of Palmyra. In the revisionist view, there was only one cult of Sol in Rome, continuous from the monarchy to the end of antiquity. There were at least three temples of Sol in Rome, all active during the Empire and all dating from the earlier Republic.

==&quot;Invictus&quot; as epithet==
&quot;Invictus&quot; (&quot;unconquered, invincible&quot;) was an epithet utilized for several Roman deities, including Jupiter, Mars, Hercules, Apollo, and Silvanus. It had been in use from the 3rd century BC. The Roman cult to Sol is continuous from the &quot;earliest history&quot; of the city until the institution of Christianity as the exclusive state religion. Scholars have sometimes regarded the traditional &quot;Sol Indiges&quot; and &quot;Sol Invictus&quot; as two separate deities, but the rejection of this view by S. E. Hijmans has found supporters.

An inscription of AD 102 records a restoration of a portico of Sol in what is now the Trastevere area of Rome by a certain Gaius Iulius Anicetus. While he may have had in mind an allusion to his own &quot;cognomen&quot;, which is the Latinized form of the Greek equivalent of &quot;invictus&quot;, ἀνίκητος (&quot;anikētos&quot;), the earliest extant dated inscription that uses &quot;invictus&quot; as an epithet of Sol is from AD 158. Another, stylistically dated to the 2nd century, is inscribed on a Roman phalera (ornamental disk): (&quot;I glorify the unconquerable sun, the creator of light.&quot;) &quot;Augustus&quot; is a regular epithet linking deities to the Imperial cult. Sol Invictus played a prominent role in the Mithraic mysteries, and was equated with Mithras. The relation of the Mithraic Sol Invictus to the public cult of the deity with the same name is unclear and perhaps non-existent.

== Elagabalus ==
According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, Elagabalus, the teenaged Severan heir, adopted the name of his deity and brought his cult image from Emesa to Rome. Once installed as emperor, he neglected Rome&#x27;s traditional State deities and promoted his own as Rome&#x27;s most powerful deity. This ended with his murder in 222. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; equates the deity Elagabalus with Jupiter and Sol: &quot;fuit autem Heliogabali vel Iovis vel Solis sacerdos&quot;, &quot;He was also a priest of Heliogabalus, or Jove, or Sol&quot;. While this has been seen as an attempt to import the Syrian sun god to Rome, the Roman cult of Sol had existed in Rome at least since the early Republic.

== Aurelian ==
The Roman &quot;gens Aurelia&quot; was associated with the cult of Sol. After his victories in the East, the Emperor Aurelian thoroughly reformed the Roman cult of Sol, elevating the sun-god to one of the premier divinities of the Empire. Where previously priests of Sol had been simply &quot;sacerdotes&quot; and tended to belong to lower ranks of Roman society, they were now &quot;pontifices&quot; and members of the new college of pontifices instituted by Aurelian. Every pontifex of Sol was a member of the senatorial elite, indicating that the priesthood of Sol was now highly prestigious. Almost all these senators held other priesthoods as well, however, and some of these other priesthoods take precedence in the inscriptions in which they are listed, suggesting that they were considered more prestigious than the priesthood of Sol. Aurelian also built a new temple for Sol, which was dedicated on 25 December 274, and brought the total number of temples for the god in Rome to (at least) four. He also instituted games in honor of the sun god, held every four years from 274 onwards.

The identity of Aurelian&#x27;s Sol Invictus has long been a subject of scholarly debate. Based on the &quot;Augustan History&quot;, some scholars have argued that it was based on Sol Elagablus (or Elagabla) of Emesa. Others, basing their argument on Zosimus, suggest that it was based on the Šams, the solar god of Palmyra on the grounds that Aurelian placed and consecrated a cult statue of the sun god looted from Palmyra in the temple of Sol Invictus. Forsythe (2012) discusses these arguments and adds a third more recent one, based on the work of Steven Hijmans. Hijmans argues that Aurelian&#x27;s solar deity was simply the traditional Greco-Roman .

== Constantine ==

Emperors portrayed on their official coinage, with a wide range of legends, only a few of which incorporated the epithet , such as the legend , claiming the &quot;Unconquered Sun&quot; as a companion to the Emperor, used with particular frequency by Constantine. Statuettes of Sol Invictus, carried by the standard-bearers, appear in three places in reliefs on the Arch of Constantine. Constantine&#x27;s official coinage continues to bear images of Sol until 325/326. A solidus of Constantine as well as a gold medallion from his reign depict the Emperor&#x27;s bust in profile twinned (jugate) with Sol Invictus, with the legend 

Constantine decreed (March 7, 321) the day of the Sun, &quot;Sunday&quot;as the Roman day of rest

Constantine&#x27;s triumphal arch was carefully positioned to align with the colossal statue of Sol by the Colosseum, so that Sol formed the dominant backdrop when seen from the direction of the main approach towards the arch.

== Sol and later Roman Emperors ==
Berrens (2004) deals with coin-evidence of Imperial connection to the Solar cult. Sol is depicted sporadically on imperial coins in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, then more frequently from Septimius Severus onwards until AD 325–326. appears on coin legends from AD 261, well before the reign of Aurelian.

Connections between the imperial radiate crown and the cult of Sol are postulated. Augustus was posthumously depicted with radiate crown, as were living emperors from Nero (after AD 65) to Constantine. Some modern scholarship interprets the imperial radiate crown as a divine, solar association rather than an overt symbol of Sol; Bergmann calls it a pseudo-object designed to disguise the divine and solar connotations that would otherwise be politically controversial but there is broad agreement that coin-images showing the imperial radiate crown are stylistically distinct from those of the solar crown of rays; the imperial radiate crown is depicted as a real object rather than as symbolic light.

Hijmans argues that the Imperial radiate crown represents the honorary wreath awarded to Augustus, perhaps posthumously, to commemorate his victory at the Battle of Actium; he points out that henceforth, living emperors were depicted with radiate crowns, but state &quot;divi&quot; were not. Hijmans believes this implies that the radiate crown of living emperors is a symbolic link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as &quot;saviour of the Republic&quot; through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to Apollo-Helios.

Furthermore, radiate crowns were not solely worn by emperors: The wreaths awarded to victors at the Actian Games were radiate.

== Festival of &quot;Dies Natalis Solis Invicti&quot;==
According to some scholars, the emperor Aurelian instituted in AD 274 the festival (&#x27;birthday of the Invincible Sun&#x27;) on 25 December, the date of the winter solstice in the Roman calendar. In Rome, this yearly festival was celebrated with thirty chariot races. Gary Forsythe, Professor of Ancient History, says &quot;This celebration would have formed a welcome addition to the seven-day period of the Saturnalia (December 17–23), Rome&#x27;s most joyous holiday season since Republican times, characterized by parties, banquets, and exchanges of gifts&quot;. Before Aurelian, the Calendar of Antiochus of Athens, second century AD, had marked 25 December as the &quot;birthday of the Sun&quot; but did not refer to any religious festival being held on that date. Around AD 238, Censorinus had written in &quot;De Die Natali&quot; that the winter solstice was the &quot;birth of the Sun&quot;.

The festival of &quot;Natalis Invicti&quot; on December 25 is marked in the Chronograph of 354 (or Calendar of Filocalus). Historians generally agree that this part of the text was written in Rome in AD 336, and most scholars see this as referring to the &quot;Natalis Solis Invicti&quot;. Steven Hijmans questions whether this actually refers to a feast of Sol Invictus, as &quot;Sol&quot; is not included in the festival name, and the number of chariot races given for the feast is not a multiple of twelve unlike other feasts dedicated to him. Hijmans argues that there is no evidence for a feast dedicated to Sol Invictus at the Roman winter solstice before Julian, and doubts that the feast was actually instituted by Aurelian. Wallraff (2001) says there is limited evidence for the festival before the mid-4th century.

Aurelian also instituted the &quot;Agon Solis&quot; (sacred contest for Sol), held every fourth year, as St Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot; attests. In AD 362, the emperor Julian wrote in his &quot;Hymn to King Helios&quot; that the &quot;Agon Solis&quot; was held in late December, between the end of the Saturnalia and the New Year. Julian says it is dedicated to Helios and the &quot;Invincible Sun&quot;. Most scholars therefore date the festival to December 25 and associate it with the &quot;Natalis Solis Invicti&quot;. Dissenting from this view, Hijmans argues that Julian never said the &quot;Agon Solis&quot; was held on that date, but believes Julian celebrated a different festival of Sol at the winter solstice.

==Legacy ==
=== Christianity ===

A widely-held theory is that the early Church chose December 25 as Jesus Christ&#x27;s birthday () to appropriate the festival of Sol Invictus&#x27;s birthday (), held on the same date. The Calendar of Filocalus (336 AD) is the earliest record of both the &quot;Natalis Invicti&quot; and Christ&#x27;s birthday being marked on December 25. Steven Hijmans argues that the earliest certain evidence for a festival of &quot;Sol Invictus&quot; on December 25 is from Julian, thirty years later; he suggests that the pagan feast might have been a reaction to the Christian one rather than &quot;vice versa&quot;.

The early Church linked Jesus Christ to the Sun and referred to him as the &#x27;true Sun&#x27; (), or the &#x27;Sun of Righteousness&#x27; () prophesied by Malachi. The Christian treatise , from the late fourth century AD, associates Jesus&#x27; birth with the &quot;birthday of the sun&quot; and Sol Invictus:

In a late fourth century Christmas sermon, Augustine of Hippo said:
The theory is mentioned in an annotation of uncertain date added to a manuscript by 12th-century Syrian bishop Jacob Bar-Salibi. The scribe wrote:
Another theory is that Christmas was calculated as nine months after a date chosen as Christ&#x27;s conception (the Annunciation): March 25, the Roman date of the spring equinox. This theory was first proposed by French priest and historian Louis Duchesne in 1889.

Imagery of Sol may have been appropriated by Christians. A mosaic dated to around 300 AD in the Tomb of the Julii, an apparently Christian tomb in the Vatican Necropolis, is generally thought to depict Jesus as Sol, Helios, or Apollo. Steven Hijmans suggests that it is simply a representation of Sol, or a figure representing the Sun.

===Judaism===

A mosaic floor in Hamat Tiberias presents David as Helios surrounded by a ring with the signs of the zodiac. As well as in Hamat Tiberias, figures of Helios or Sol Invictus also appear in several of the very few surviving schemes of decoration surviving from Late Antique synagogues, including Beth Alpha, Husefa, all now in Israel, and Naaran in the West Bank. He is shown in floor mosaics, with the usual radiate halo, and sometimes in a quadriga, in the central roundel of a circular representation of the zodiac or the seasons. These combinations &quot;may have represented to an agricultural Jewish community the perpetuation of the annual cycle of the universe or ... the central part of a calendar&quot;.

<doc id="1214773" wikidata="Q276126" url="?curid=1214773" title="Mary Lamb">
<text>Mary Anne Lamb (3 December 1764 – 20 May 1847) was an English writer. She is best known for the collaboration with her brother Charles on the collection &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot; (1807). Mary suffered from mental illness, and in 1796, aged 31, she stabbed her mother to death during a mental breakdown. She was confined to mental facilities for most of her remaining life. She and Charles presided over a literary circle in London that included the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, among others.

==Early life==
Mary Lamb was born in London on 3 December 1764, the third of seven children of John and Elizabeth Lamb. Her parents worked for Samuel Salt, a barrister in London, and the family lived above Salt in his home at 2 Crown Office Row in the Inner Temple. Only two of Mary&#x27;s siblings survived: her older brother John Jr. and her younger brother Charles. Mary learned about literature and writers from her father&#x27;s stories of the times he had seen Samuel Johnson, who lived nearby, and his visitors. Mary remembered seeing, at the age of five, the writer Oliver Goldsmith in the street, and she also witnessed David Garrick&#x27;s acting. Her father may have taken her with him on his trips to the Pope&#x27;s Head book shop nearby.

Samuel Salt died in 1792, and the Lambs had to move out of their lodgings soon afterwards (see tied accommodation). John Lamb continued to work in his old position in the Great Hall of the Inner Temple, where he had waited on Salt, but his wages were not sufficient to keep the lodgings that had been provided without cost by Salt. Samuel Salt left £600 to the Lambs, along with small annuities. They moved to a home in Little Queen Street, near High Holborn. Around this time, John Lamb had a stroke, losing most of the use of his left hand. John was allowed to continue receiving his salary while another man stood in for him in the Inner Temple, performing his duties. This arrangement lasted until John&#x27;s death in 1799.

In the early 1790s, Elizabeth Lamb began to experience debilitating pain, possibly from arthritis, which ended up crippling her. Mary, the only other person at home during the day, took responsibility for her mother&#x27;s care. By 1796, Elizabeth was completely helpless and dependent on Mary. John&#x27;s sister Sarah Lamb also lived with the family, and her care was spread between Charles and Mary. In 1795 Charles had a mental breakdown, and spent the end of 1795 to the beginning of 1796 in a private mental facility. During this time, Mary worked as a seamstress, along with a little girl who served as her apprentice. The responsibilities and expectations placed on Mary began to be a serious burden for her toward the end of 1796. Her father had become senile, her mother required constant care, and her brother John had had an accident, and had moved back in with the family, so that he too could be cared for by her. Mary may also have had difficulties in training her young apprentice. The situation began to affect her mental stability.

==Murder of Elizabeth Lamb==

On 22 September 1796, while preparing dinner, Mary became angry with her apprentice, roughly shoving the little girl out of her way and pushing her into another room. Elizabeth began shouting at her for this. Mary suffered a mental break-down as her mother continued shouting at her. She took the kitchen knife she had been holding, unsheathed it, and approached her mother, who was sitting down. She then fatally stabbed her mother in the chest, in full view of John and Sarah Lamb who were standing nearby. Charles ran into the house soon after the murder and took the knife out of Mary&#x27;s hand.

Later in the evening Mary was confined in a local mental facility called Fisher House, in Islington, a place found for her by Charles through a doctor friend of his. Charles took over responsibility for Mary after refusing his brother John&#x27;s suggestion that they have her committed to a public facility. A few days later, the murder was reported in the newspapers. The coroner had returned a verdict of lunacy. A month after the murder, while still at Fisher House, Mary told Charles she had come to terms with her guilt over the murder, and felt that she had for the most part been a good and faithful daughter.

==Middle years==
Six months after the murder, Charles removed Mary from Fisher House and brought her to live in a house in the village of Hackney, not far from London. Charles spent his Sundays and holidays with Mary, leaving her in the care of his landlords for the rest of the time. Mary continued to work as a seamstress, and subscribed to the local lending libraries, as she was a voracious reader throughout her life. Charles&#x27;s poem &quot;Written on Christmas Day, 1797&quot; demonstrated his feelings toward his sister, to whom he had made a lifelong commitment. On 13 April 1799 John Lamb died. Sarah Lamb had died in 1797, and with John&#x27;s death, Charles was able to bring Mary back to London to live with him. They both decided that they would remain unmarried and live together for the rest of their lives, in a state described by Charles as &quot;a sort of double singleness&quot;. 

In 1800, after the death of their housekeeper, Mary had to be confined again for a month. Through the rest of her life, Mary occasionally spent time in mental facilities when she or Charles felt that her mental derangement was returning. Over time, Mary and Charles rebuilt the very close and loving relationship they had had before their mother&#x27;s death. In his essay &quot;Mackery End&quot;, Charles wrote that &quot;We are both of us inclined to be a little too positive...But where we have differed upon moral points; upon something proper to be done, or let alone; whatever heat of opposition, or steadiness of conviction, I set out with, I am sure always, in the long run, to be brought over to her way of thinking.&quot; Her sense of humour was so little developed, as compared with her brother&#x27;s, that he described a play on words she made at the age of 50 as being her first joke.

In 1801, the Lambs formed a literary and social circle that included minor artists and writers, and occasional visits from Charles&#x27;s friends Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. At this time, Mary also met two of the best female friends of her life, Sarah Stoddart and Dorothy Wordsworth. Charles began drinking heavily around this time, a problem that followed him until his death. Mary patiently watched over Charles when he was drunk, just as he had always watched over her.

In 1806, William Godwin (Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s widower) and his second wife Mary Jane Godwin (mother of Claire Clairmont), who had become close with the Lambs through their shared literary work of the past few years, asked Mary to write something for their &quot;Juvenile Library&quot;. This was the beginning of Charles and Mary&#x27;s collaboration on &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot;. During the writing of the &quot;Tales&quot;, Mary realised that she could make a living writing these types of works for children. The finished collection of &quot;Tales&quot; was published in 1807, with a second edition coming out in 1809. Artists who made illustrations for the &quot;Tales&quot; included William Mulready and the poet William Blake. In 1808 the Lambs developed a closer friendship with an earlier acquaintance, William Hazlitt, who had recently married Mary&#x27;s friend Sarah Stoddart, sister of the journalist John Stoddart.

Mary began writing her collection of tales &quot;Mrs. Leicester&#x27;s School&quot; in 1808, publishing it at the end of the year, but the original title page stated the date as 1809. According to Charles, the work was mostly Mary&#x27;s with only a small collaborative effort by him. The book had gone through nine editions by 1825. In 1810 Charles and Mary published another collaboration, &quot;Poems for Children&quot;. Their writing brought them financial security and vaulted them solidly into the middle class. Mary had difficulties adjusting to middle-class life, as she had to hire and govern servants though she was used to doing household work herself.

==Later life==

In December 1814, Mary wrote an article titled &quot;On Needle-work&quot;, published in the &quot;New British Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; the following year under the pseudonym Sempronia. The article argued that sewing should be made a recognised profession to give independence to women whose only skill and way of making a living was sewing, which at the time was something they were mostly obliged to do as part of their household duties. Mary had a relapse of her mental illness soon after publication of the article. In 1820 Charles began writing of the &quot;Essays of Elia&quot;, in some of which he described her under the name of Bridget Elia. At this time his and Mary&#x27;s literary gatherings grew in importance, with new members joining the circle including Thomas Noon Talfourd and Bryan Procter.

In 1820, they met a young girl named Emma Isola, who may have been introduced to them by William Wordsworth. Emma stayed with the Lambs several times over the next few years. After her father&#x27;s death in 1823, when she was 14, Emma was adopted by the Lambs. She spent five happy years with them until finding a position as a governess. During the time that the three lived together, the Lambs moved to a country house. In 1825, Charles resigned from his position at the East India House. In the later 1820s Mary&#x27;s mental illness progressed, her periods of dementia lasting longer and becoming deeper, while new symptoms of depression and detachment appeared. Charles&#x27;s health became more infirm as well through these years.

In 1833 Mary moved to a house for mentally ill people in Edmonton, Middlesex; Charles soon followed. Charles never lost his love and devotion for his sister, even as her illness continued to worsen. &quot;I could be nowhere happier than under the same roof as her,&quot; he said in 1834. The death of Coleridge in July 1834 was a great blow to Charles. Charles died on 27 December 1834. According to family friend Henry Crabb Robinson, Mary was &quot;quite insane&quot; at this time and unable to fully feel grief at the death of her brother, but she recovered so far as to be able to persuade Wordsworth to write lines for her brother&#x27;s memorial stone.

Mary lived on at Edmonton until 1842 when she moved with her nurses to a house in London. She exchanged visits with friends when her mind was strong enough, but her hearing deteriorated in the mid-1840s, making it difficult for her to communicate with others. She died on 20 May 1847, and she was buried next to her brother in the Edmonton Churchyard in Middlesex.

==Legacy==


At the time of her death, few people outside of hers and her brother&#x27;s immediate circle of friends knew about either her mental problems or the circumstances of her mother&#x27;s death. Their friend Talfourd soon published a memoir of the Lambs carefully and respectfully giving details of Mary&#x27;s mental condition while praising her as a friend and writer. One intention of Talfourd&#x27;s was to boost the reputation of Charles by showing how much he had done for his beloved sister. He said that Mary was &quot;remarkable for the sweetness of her disposition, the clearness of her understanding, and the gentle wisdom of all her acts and words&quot;, and that &quot;To a friend in any difficulty she was the most comfortable of advisers, the wisest of consolers.&quot; Hazlitt called her the one thoroughly reasonable woman he had ever met. She was, in fact, a favourite among Charles&#x27;s literary friends. Nevertheless, periodicals of the time, such as the &quot;British Quarterly Review&quot;, did not write about her with the same kindness and respect.

In 1913, the U.S. writer Willis J. Abbot gave her an article in his book &quot;Notable women in history&quot;.

Charles and Mary Lamb&#x27;s story was explored by Dorothy Parker and Ross Evans in their 1949 play &quot;The Coast of Illyria&quot;. Mary was depicted as the central character in &quot;The Lambs of London&quot; (2004), a novel by Peter Ackroyd. She is also the subject of a 2004 biographical study by British writer Kathy Watson, &quot;The Devil Kissed Her,&quot; and a 2005 biography by Susan Tyler Hitchcock, &quot;Mad Mary Lamb: Lunacy And Murder In Literary London.&quot; She appears in the first chapter of &quot;Mad, Bad, &amp; Sad&quot;, Lisa Appignanesi&#x27;s book on women and mental illness. The Lambs appear in one episode of Sue Limb&#x27;s radio comedy &quot;The Wordsmiths at Gorsemere&quot;, a pastiche of the poet William Wordsworth and his circle at Grasmere.

An essay on Charles and Mary Lamb, titled &quot;The Unfuzzy Lamb&quot;, appeared in Anne Fadiman&#x27;s book &quot;At Large and at Small: Familiar Essays&quot; (2007).

<doc id="1214776" wikidata="Q15515717" url="?curid=1214776" title="Henry Marten (regicide)">
<text>Henry Marten (1602 – 9 September 1680) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons in two periods between 1640 and 1653. He was an ardent republican and a regicide of King Charles I of England. He was found guilty of taking part in the king&#x27;s death. Although he remained a captive, he was spared the death penalty.

==Life==
Marten was the elder son of the successful lawyer and diplomat Sir Henry Marten; his other known siblings were a brother, George Giles Martin, and three sisters, Elizabeth, Jane, and Mary. Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Marten was born at his father&#x27;s house on 3 Merton Street, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England and educated in the same city. Marten matriculated on 31 October 1617 as a gentleman commoner from University College, graduating BA in 1620. Like many young men of his social background, he also entered the Inns of Court. He may have been the Henry Marten admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn in August 1618 and was certainly admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1619. In the 1620s he toured Europe and enjoyed much high living there, but also during his time in France he was exposed to the thinking of the French stoical philosophers.

As a public figure, Marten first came to prominence in 1639 when he refused to contribute to a general loan. In April 1640, he was elected Member of Parliament for Berkshire in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Berkshire for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He lived at Beckett Hall in Shrivenham (now in Oxfordshire) and soon afterwards, his official residence became Longworth House in nearby Longworth. He preferred to live in London. In the House of Commons, he joined the popular party, spoke in favour of the proposed bill of attainder against Strafford, and in 1642 was a member of the committee of safety. Some of his language about the king was so frank that Charles demanded his arrest and his trial for high treason.

When the English Civil War broke out Marten did not take the field, although he was appointed governor of Reading, Berkshire, but in Parliament he was very active. On one occasion his zeal in the parliamentary cause led him to open a letter from the Earl of Northumberland to his countess, an impertinence for which, says Clarendon, he was cudgelled by the Earl.

In 1643 he was expelled from the Houses of Parliament and briefly imprisoned in the Tower of London for expressing the view that the royal family should be extirpated and monarchy brought to an end.

In 1644, however, he was made governor of Aylesbury, and about this time took direct part in the war. Allowed to return to Parliament in January 1646, Marten again advocated extreme republican views. He spoke of his desire to prepare the king for heaven; he attacked the Presbyterians, and, supporting the New Model Army against the Long Parliament, he signed the agreement of August 1647. He was closely associated with John Lilburne and the Levellers, and was one of those who suspected the sincerity of Oliver Cromwell, whose murder he is said personally to have contemplated.

However, he acted with Cromwell in bringing Charles I to trial; he was one of the most prominent of the 31 of 59 Commissioners to sign the death warrant in 1649. He was then energetic in establishing the Commonwealth and in destroying the remaining vestiges of the monarchical system. He was chosen a member of the Council of State in 1649, and as compensation for his losses and reward for his services during the war, lands valued at £1000 a year were settled upon him. In parliament he spoke often and with effect, but he took no part in public life during the Protectorate, passing part of this time in prison, where he was placed on account of his debts.

Having sat among the restored members of the Long Parliament in 1659, Marten surrendered himself to the authorities as a regicide in June 1660, and with some others he was excepted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, but with a saving clause. He behaved courageously at his trial, which took place in October 1660, but he was found guilty of taking part in the king&#x27;s death. Through the action, or rather the inaction of the House of Lords, he was spared the death penalty, but he remained a captive.
Having escaped the death penalty for his involvement in the regicide Marten was sent into internal exile, first in the far north of England and then (1665) to Windsor Castle, where he remained until Charles II ordered him to be moved further away from himself. In 1668 Marten was sent to Chepstow, in Wales. Marten&#x27;s imprisonment there lasted some twelve years but does not appear to have been unduly arduous, at least at first; he had a suite of rooms in what was then known as Bigod&#x27;s Tower (now known as Marten&#x27;s Tower) and seems to have been able to travel outside at times. His legitimate wife Margaret lived apart from him, remaining at the family home in Berkshire, but he was attended there by Mary Ward, his common-law wife. Marten died at Chepstow Castle on 9 September 1680, having choked while eating his supper, and was buried beneath the floor at an entryway of Priory and Parish Church of St Mary, Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales, UK.

==Character and beliefs==

Although a leading Puritan, Marten enjoyed good living. He had a contemporary reputation as a heavy drinker and was widely said to be a man of loose morals. According to John Aubrey he was &quot;a great lover of pretty girls to whom he was so liberal that he spent the greatest part of his estate&quot; upon them. In the opinion of King Charles I he was &quot;an ugly rascal and whore-master&quot;. He married twice (to Elizabeth Lovelace, daughter of Richard Lovelace, 1st Baron Lovelace; and Margaret Staunton, née West) but had an open and lengthy relationship with Mary Ward, a woman not his wife, by whom he had three daughters. Ward ultimately was to remain with him throughout his later imprisonment. His enemies branded him an atheist but his religious views were more complex, and influenced his position regarding the need to allow freedom of worship and conscience. His political views throughout his life were constant: he opposed one-man rule and was in favour of representative government. In 1643, even while the king was losing the First Civil War and Parliament&#x27;s cause was beginning to triumph, Marten&#x27;s republican sentiments led to his arrest and brief imprisonment.
Thus for his time Marten was unusual in his political stance, being unashamedly in favour not of reforming the monarchy but of replacing it with a republic.

==Works==
Marten was not a copious author, often beginning works and not carrying them through to completion. Nevertheless, he wrote and published several pamphlets, all on political topics:
* &quot;A Corrector of the Answerer to the Speech out of Doores&quot; (1646)
* &quot;An Unhappie Game at Scotch and English&quot; (1646)
* &quot;The Independency of England Endeavoured to be Maintained&quot; (1648)
* &quot;The Parliaments Proceedings Justified in Declining a Personall Treaty&quot; (1648)

In 1662 there appeared &quot;Henry Marten&#x27;s Familiar Letters to his Lady of Delight&quot;, containing letters Marten had written to his common-law wife, Mary Ward, which had been seized and published without permission.

<text>Sir Henry Marten, also recorded as Sir Henry Martin, (1562 – 26 September 1641) was an English judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1625 and 1640. He served as Judge of the High Court of Admiralty from 1617 to 1641.

==Life==

There are two main conflicting accounts of Marten&#x27;s early life.

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; identifies him as the eldest son of Anthony Marten, a merchant of London, originally from Wokingham, Berkshire, and his wife Margaret, daughter of John Yate of Lydford, Berkshire. It quotes John Aubrey, writing in 1680 (&quot;Brief Lives&quot;, 1.43), as giving Marten&#x27;s birthplace as Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. Anthony à Wood in &quot;Athenae Oxienses&quot;, compiled between 1660 and 1669, also identifies Anthony Marten and Margaret as his parents, noting that Margaret was his second wife.

The &quot;History of Parliament&quot; identifies him as the second son of John Marten (d.1563), a wealthy London baker, and his wife Rose. It describes the identification with the merchant Anthony as &quot;unlikely&quot;, as Henry Marten is known to have had an older brother, but suggests (in contrast to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;) that Anthony Marten appears to have had only one son. It gives the date of Marten&#x27;s baptism as 2 Aug 1562; John Marten died in October 1563. Further confusion is sown by an anonymous writer in the Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine for 1830, who refers to Anthony Marten&#x27;s wife as Anne Jacob.

Marten was educated at Winchester College and matriculated at New College, Oxford on 24 November 1581, aged 19. He became a fellow of the college in 1582 and studied civil and canon law. He graduated BCL in 1587 and DCL in 1592, and was admitted a member of the College of Advocates on 16 October 1596. He developed a large practice as a barrister in the admiralty, prerogative, and high commission courts, and was appointed official of the archdeaconry of Berkshire.

Marten was made King&#x27;s advocate on 3 March 1609 and in March 1613 was sent abroad in connection with the marriage settlement of the Lady Elizabeth. In 1616, he was made chancellor of the diocese of London. He was knighted at Theobalds on 21 December 1616. and in 1617 became a judge of the admiralty court. Later he was appointed a member of the court of high commission and dean of the arches. Marten started investing in land in Berkshire buying firstly property at West Challow in the Vale of White Horse, secondly Longworth House at Longworth which he bought for £9,500 in 1618, and thirdly Hinton Waldrist Manor.

In 1625 Marten was elected Member of Parliament for St Germans and supported Sir John Eliot in attacking the Duke of Buckingham. His tone was described as studiously moderate. While parliament was prorogued in 1626, he was involved in the committal of Sir Robert Howard by the high commission, and when he was re-elected MP for St Germans in 1626, an attempt was made to exclude him because of the case. He pleaded ignorance of the distinction between prorogation and dissolution and was allowed to take his seat. In 1628 he was elected MP for Oxford University, taking part in the debates on the Petition of Right and sitting until 1629 when King Charles I decided to rule without parliament for eleven years.

In April 1640, Marten was elected MP for St Ives in the Short Parliament. He did not stand for the Long Parliament which fined him £250 for his part in the case of Sir Robert Howard.

Marten married Elizabeth Harding, the sister of John Harding, and had two sons and three daughters. He was father of the regicide Henry Marten. Sir Henry Marten second son George Giles Martin, was a loyalist as well. George was Lord Mayor of Belfast, Ireland, until disposed of home and employment by Oliver Cromwell. George Giles Martin became a tobacco producer and was the Speaker of the House of the Assembly of Barbados in 1665. Sir Henry Marten died on 26 September 1641 at Bray, Berkshire, England and was buried at Saint Mary&#x27;s Church, at Longworth, Oxfordshire, England with his wife Elizabeth, who had died in 1618.

A portrait of Sir Henry Martin hangs in Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

<text>Seymour Benzer (October 15, 1921 – November 30, 2007) was an American physicist, molecular biologist and behavioral geneticist. His career began during the molecular biology revolution of the 1950s, and he eventually rose to prominence in the fields of molecular and behavioral genetics. He led a productive genetics research lab both at Purdue University and as the James G. Boswell Professor of Neuroscience, emeritus, at the California Institute of Technology.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Benzer was born in the South Bronx to Meir Benzer and Eva Naidorf, both Jews from Poland. He had two older sisters, and his parents favored him as the only boy. One of Benzer&#x27;s earliest scientific experiences was dissecting frogs he had caught as a boy. In an interview at Caltech, Benzer also remembered receiving a microscope for his 13th birthday, “and that opened up the whole world.” The book &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; by Sinclair Lewis heavily influenced the young Benzer, and he even imitated the handwriting of Max Gottlieb, a scientist character in the novel. Benzer graduated from New Utrecht High School at 15 years old.

In 1938 he enrolled at Brooklyn College where he majored in physics. Benzer then moved on to Purdue University to earn his Ph.D. in solid state physics. While there he was recruited for a secret military project to develop improved radar. He performed research that led to the development of stable germanium rectifiers and discovered a germanium crystal able to be used at high voltages, among the scientific work that led to the first transistor.

===Personal life===
At Brooklyn College, as a sixteen-year-old freshman, Benzer met Dorothy Vlosky (nicknamed Dotty), a twenty-one-year-old nurse. He later married her in New York City in 1942. They had two daughters, Barbie (Barbara) and Martha Jane.

Benzer died of a stroke at the Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, California.

==Scientific career==

===Molecular biology===

Upon receiving his Ph.D. in 1947, he was immediately hired as an assistant professor in physics at Purdue. However, Benzer was inspired by Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s book &quot;What Is Life?&quot;, in which the physicist pondered the physical nature of the gene and a “code” of life. This catalyzed Benzer&#x27;s shift in interest to biology, and he moved into the area of bacteriophage genetics., spending two years as a postdoctoral fellow in Max Delbrück&#x27;s laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and then returning to Purdue. At Purdue University, Benzer developed the T4 &quot;rII&quot; system, a new genetic technique involving recombination in T4 bacteriophage &quot;rII&quot; mutants. After observing that a particular &quot;rII&quot; mutant, a mutation that caused the bacteriophage to eliminate bacteria more rapidly than usual, was not exhibiting the expected phenotype, it occurred to Benzer that this strain might have come from a cross between two different &quot;rII&quot; mutants (each having part of the &quot;rII&quot; gene intact) wherein a recombination event resulted in a normal &quot;rII&quot; sequence. Benzer realized that by generating many &quot;r&quot; mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different &quot;r&quot; strains, one could create a detailed map of the gene, much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes. Taking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the &quot;rII&quot; mutant system, Benzer was eventually able to map over 2400 &quot;rII&quot; mutations. The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity, as previously believed, and that genes were linear. Benzer also proved that mutations were distributed in many different parts of a single gene, and the resolving power of his system allowed him to discern mutants that differ at the level of a single nucleotide. Based on his &quot;rII&quot; data, Benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions, point mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations.

Benzer&#x27;s work influenced many other scientists of his time (see Phage group). In his molecular biology period, Benzer dissected the fine structure of a single gene, laying down the ground work for decades of mutation analysis and genetic engineering, and setting up a paradigm using the &quot;rII&quot; phage that would later be used by Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner to establish the triplet code of DNA. In addition, Benzer&#x27;s mapping technique was taken up by Richard Feynman.

In 1967, Benzer left the field of phage genetics and returned to the California Institute of Technology to work in behavioral genetics.

===Behavioral genetics===

====Benzer vs. Hirsch====
Benzer was one of the first scientists to rise to prominence in the field of behavioral genetics. As the field began to emerge in the 1960s and 70s, Benzer found himself in scientific opposition to another of the field&#x27;s leading researchers, Jerry Hirsch. While Hirsch believed that behaviors were complex phenomena irreducible to the level of single genes, Benzer advocated that animal behaviors were not too complex to be directed by a single gene. This translated to methodological differences in the two researchers&#x27; experiments with Drosophila that profoundly influenced the field of behavioral genetics. Hirsch artificially selected for behaviors of interest over many generations, while Benzer primarily used forward genetic mutagenesis screens to isolate mutants for a particular behavior. Benzer and Hirsch&#x27;s competing philosophies served to provide necessary scientific tension in order to accelerate and enhance developments in behavioral genetics, helping it gain traction as a legitimate area of study in the scientific community.

====Research accomplishments====
Benzer used forward genetics to investigate the genetic basis of various behaviors such as phototaxis, circadian rhythms, and learning by inducing mutations in a Drosophila population and then screening individuals for altered phenotypes of interest. To better identify mutants, Benzer developed novel apparatuses such as the countercurrent device, which was designed to separate flies according to the magnitude and direction of their phototactic response. Benzer identified mutants for a wide variety of characteristics: vision (&quot;nonphototactic&quot;, &quot;negative phototactic&quot;, and &quot;eyes absent&quot;), locomotion (&quot;sluggish&quot;, &quot;uncoordinated&quot;), stress sensitivity (&quot;freaked-out&quot;), sexual function (&quot;savoir-faire&quot;, &quot;fruitless&quot;), nerve and muscle function (&quot;photoreceptor degeneration&quot;, &quot;drop-dead&quot;), and learning and memory (&quot;rutabaga&quot;, &quot;dunce&quot;).

Benzer and student Ron Konopka discovered the first circadian rhythm mutants. Three distinct mutant types—arrhythmic, shortened period, and lengthened period—were identified. These mutations all involved the same functional gene on the X chromosome and influenced the eclosion rhythm of the population as well as rhythms in individual flies&#x27; locomotor activity. To monitor &quot;Drosophila&quot; locomotor activity, Benzer and postdoctoral researcher, Yoshiki Hotta, designed a system using infrared light and solar cells. All three mutations were mapped to the X chromosome, zero centimorgans away from each other, indicating that the mutant phenotypes corresponded to alleles of the same gene, which Konopka named &quot;period&quot;. This was the first of several seminal studies of single genes affecting behavior, studies that have been replicated in other animal models and are now the basis for the growing field of molecular biology of behavior. In 1992 Benzer, working with Michael Rosbash, furthered this work by showing that the PER protein, which &quot;period&quot; codes for, is predominantly located in the nucleus. The work with Period mutants was catalytic in the study of circadian rhythms and served to propel the field forward.

On 2 October 2017, Dr. Rosbash, along with Drs. Michael W. Young and Jeffrey C. Hall, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition of their cloning of circadian rhythm genes, and the elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms by which the circadian rhythm protein products regulated behavior.

Benzer was at the forefront of the study of neurodegeneration in fruit flies, modeling human diseases and attempting to suppress them. He also contributed to the field of aging biology, looking for mutants with altered longevity and trying to dissect the mechanisms by which an organism can escape the inevitable functional downfall and its associated diseases. In 1998, Benzer and his colleagues Yi-Jyun Lin and Laurent Seroude published findings of a long-life mutant in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, then named Methuselah. The mutant gene coded for a previously unknown member of the GPCR family. By testing against temperature stress, it is thought that these mutants have an increased ability to respond to stress and thus to live longer. One of Benzer&#x27;s final research projects was on dietary restriction and longevity research. A paper was published, in &#x27;&#x27;Cell&#x27;&#x27;, on the longevity effect of 4E-BP, a translational repressor, following dietary restriction. Although the research was done before his death, the paper was published afterwards and dedicated to his memory.

===Cancer research===

In 1978, Dotty was in the hospital with breast cancer, and Seymour&#x27;s friend, colleague, and mentor Max Delbrück was diagnosed with cancer. Consequently, Seymour Benzer took interest in cancer biology and attended several conferences on breast cancer.
Benzer later remarried with Carol Miller, a neuropathologist. Together, in the early 1980s, they used antibody staining techniques to find nearly identical genes between flies and humans.

Their local rivals are Workington Town.

==History==

===Foundation===

Rugby league in Cumbria can trace its roots back over 100 years to the formation of the Northern Union. Whitehaven had its own team, Whitehaven Recreation, which competed in the Challenge Cup in the first decade of the 20th century.

&quot;Whitehaven RLFC&quot; was formed at a meeting held in the Miners&#x27; Welfare Club at Kells from the Whitehaven Miners&#x27; Welfare team in 1948 and shortly afterwards were admitted into the Rugby Football League by just three votes. Whitehaven took over the Miners&#x27; Welfare lease at the Recreation Ground. In their first game Haven beat Hull F.C. 5–0. There was a &quot;disappointing&quot; turnout of only 9,000 because of the pouring rain; in those days the supporters&#x27; club had 4,000 members. The early Whitehaven team were nicknamed &quot;the Colliers&quot; because of the Miners&#x27; Welfare connection.

In a Britain that still was still recovering from wartime rationing and austerity Whitehaven gradually picked itself up. Billy Little came to the Recreation Ground in 1950 as coach at a time when the fledgling Haven club were struggling to compete in the professional league. His tenure as coach signalled an era of progress and improvement. In 1951, the first of a long line of players from Australasia joined Haven as Neville Emery became player-coach. Whitehaven finished tenth in a league of 30 in the 1952–53 season and Whitehaven team lost 15-5 to the touring Australians watched by a crowd of 9,253 at the Recreation Ground.

On Saturday 20 October 1956, Whitehaven defeated the Australian tourists 14–11 before a crowd of 10,917 at the Recreation Ground. Later that season the club came within minutes of a Wembley appearance when they lost 10–9 to Leeds in a Challenge Cup semi-final before a 50,000 crowd at the Odsal Stadium, featuring players such as the legendary Dick Huddart and full back John McKeown. The end of that season saw Emery return home to be replaced by Edward Gibson, who rebuilt the team, and in 1959/60 the club finished 6th in the league their highest ever position.

===1960s and onwards===

The club&#x27;s record attendance was set in 1960 when 18,650 spectators turned up for a third round Challenge Cup game against Wakefield Trinity. Despite this, the 1960s were a period of decline as the club struggled on the field, though in 1965 the club defeated the touring New Zealanders 12–5, the winning try scored by John Coupe. It wasn&#x27;t until 1970 that the club emerged from this lean spell. Under the coaching of Sol Roper they topped the league table for part of the 1969–70 season. Once again the club defeated the game&#x27;s top clubs like St. Helens, Wigan and Bradford Northern at the Recreation Ground.

Jeff Bawden in 1971–72, his first season as head coach, was able to take Whitehaven to Central Park and beat Wigan on their own patch for the first time in Whitehaven&#x27;s history. The club progressed over the next few years and in 1973 acquired floodlights. However success was once again denied at the last hurdle as the club suffered semi-final defeats in both the Lancashire County Cup and the John Player Cup.

Phil Kitchin became coach in 1980. Two promotions to the top division came in the 1980s, and during this period the club produced a batch of internationals in scrum half Arnold &#x27;Boxer&#x27; Walker, forward Vince Fox and centre Vince Gribbin. Kitchen was sacked in 1981 and Arnold Walker became player-coach before also being sacked as coach.

By the end of the 1980s the club found itself back in Division Two.

Whitehaven faced a financial crisis in 1992. Eleven local businessmen, Copeland Council and Albright &amp; Wilson joined forces to form Whitehaven 1992 Ltd, the holding company which owns 70 per cent of the shares.

===Summer era===
When Super League was proposed Whitehaven were supposed to merge with Barrow, Carlisle and Workington Town to form a &quot;Cumbria&quot; club to be based at Workington, that would take part in the new summer competition. This was successfully resisted.

Whitehaven Warriors ended 1996 one place above the relegation positions. The appointment of Kiwi coaches Kurt Sorensen and Stan Martin brought about a revival at the club with Haven finishing third in Division One in 1997 and reaching the play-off semi-finals only to lose to Hull F.C. The club adopted the name &quot;Whitehaven Warriors&quot; during that season.

Martin quit as coach in summer 1998, Colin Armstrong took temporary charge of Whitehaven before Edgar took over.

The merger issue resurfaced in 2000, Whitehaven were so heavily in debt that a merger with Workington seemed the only means of survival. However, the board of directors rejected a merger proposal with Workington Town and then resigned en masse.

Paul Cullen arrived as coach in September 2000 taking over from Kevin Tamati. This heralded upward progression for Whitehaven. The club made steady progress and earned a place in National League 1 for 2003. Cullen left in August 2002 to manage Warrington. Peter Smith took over as coach with help from Peter Roe before Steve McCormack was appointed in 2004. Whitehaven dropped the &quot;Warriors&quot; epithet and went back to being plain Whitehaven.

In 2004, they were undefeated at home in the league and made it to the semi-final of the Arriva Trains Cup losing to the eventual winners Leigh Centurions. They also narrowly lost out on promotion to Super League after losing 32–16 in extra time to Leigh in the National League One grand final. The following year despite Castleford being red hot favourites for promotion Whitehaven managed to win their first piece of silverware when he took the National League One League Leader&#x27;s trophy, however they were unable to take this success into the grand final, where they were heavily beaten by Castleford.

Steve McCormack left to manage Widnes and was replaced by Dave Rotheram in November 2005. In 2006, Haven finished 4th and reached the National League 1 play-offs, only to be beaten 24–20 by Steve McCormack&#x27;s Widnes in a hard fought semi-final. They were knocked out of the Northern Rail Cup at the quarter-final stage by Hull Kingston Rovers who would eventually be promoted to the Engage Super League that season.

In late 2006 they became the first ever winners of the pre-season &quot;Ike Southward Trophy&quot;, beating neighbours Workington Town 18–6 at the Recreation Ground. Haven made it to the final of the Northern Rail Cup for the first time in 2007 but lost 54–6 to Widnes.

Whitehaven appointed Paul Crarey as their new coach in October 2007 as Dave Rotheram left to manage Workington Town.

In early 2008 Gerard Stokes was offered the job of coaching Haven, after coach Paul Crarey left the club citing personal health issues. Stokes led Haven to the play-offs during his first season in charge. However a disastrous 13-game losing streak saw the club relegated to Championship 1 at the end of the 2010 season.

===2010 Reformation===

Following relegation at the end if the 2010 season, Whiteaven went into administration and re-formed under the name &quot;Whitehaven 2010&quot;. As a consequence, Haven were deducted nine points for next season&#x27;s Championship 1.

Club legend David Seeds was appointed head coach and started the season unbeaten, wiping out the nine-point deduction in the first few games but fell short of promotion being knocked out in the play-offs by Doncaster. Following the game David Seeds resigned as coach and Les Ashe resigned as assistant coach.

Towards the end of 2011 Haven appointed Don Gailer from the North Devils in Australia as new head coach, with the remit being promotion to the Championship. Haven finished 4th, thus securing the final promotion berth after Doncaster, Barrow and local rivals Workington Town. Gailer was sacked just two weeks after securing promotion following a rift between the coach and Haven players.

In September 2012 Haven announced that ex Castleford coach Dave Woods would coach the side in 2013, Haven immediately set about strengthening for 2013 signing prop Paul Jackson from Super League side Castleford. Prior to the start of the season Haven announced a dual registration link-up with Super League side St Helens, during the season Ade Gardner, Paul Clough, Tommy Makinson, Carl Forster, Jordan Hand, Joe Greenwood, Anthony Walker and Adam Swift would turn out for the club with Swift in particular impressing from fullback. Haven started well, winning the opening two games before losing at home to Leigh Centurions in front of the Premier Sports cameras. Haven would finally break a 7-game losing streak against local rivals Workington Town winning 29–18 on Sunday 23 June before securing a place in the Championship for the following season.

Steve Deakin was appointed as head coach in September 2014. A mass exodus of players followed; out of a squad of twenty-four, eighteen left and Haven were left with six players Deakin resigned for personal reasons a week before the first game of the season and player Brett Seymour took temporary charge. James Coyle was then appointed as player-coach on a caretaker basis with Brett Seymour.

In 2020, Whitehaven played in the Championship following their promotion from League 1 after winning the title with 32 points from 20 games. In the 2021 Championship season, Whitehaven finished sixth on the table and qualified for the playoffs. In the first week of the playoffs, they were defeated 24-20 by Halifax which ended their season. In the 2022 RFL Championship season, Whitehaven finished 10th on the table. The following season, Whitehaven finished 12th on the table.

====Crisis (Aug 2024)====
In August 2024 the club entered crisis as head coach Jonty Gorley resigned with team manager Des Byrne resigning two days later, along with numerous other staff members aimed threats of redundancy.; Kyle Amor took over as interim head-coach in an attempt to avert a complete breakdown. Further, all first team players went (and are currently) on strike, due to no payments being made throughout July and August. This occurring after weeks of not fielding a full squad on matchdays. On 21 August, the RFL stepped in to help alleviate the crisis, but threatened severe sanctions if any fixtures could not be fulfilled. A deal was reached to temporarily suspended strike action for the 25 August fixture against Dewsbury. They won the game with a 14 player match day squad. In September, the club received a £12,000 donation from Wakefield Trinity. Despite winning their final game of the season, Whitehaven were relegated having finished 13th. The game also saw club captain, James Newton, break his neck.

<text>Thai fisherman pants (, , ; , , ) are lightweight unisex trousers that are made wide in the waist so that one size fits all. The pants are wrapped around the waist and ribbons are tied to form a belt. Excess material is then folded over the knot.

Thai fisherman pants are very similar to the traditional attire of Intha and Shan males, the former of whom live on Inle Lake of Myanmar. They are known in Burmese as shan baung-mi ().

== Uses ==
Although traditionally used by fishermen in Thailand, they have become popular among others for casual, beach, and exercise wear as well as for backpacking and pregnancy. Traditionally, Thai fisherman pants were adapted from sarongs and were worn by Thai fishermen and farmers. This style of pants suits the tropical climate of Thailand well as they are light and airy, inexpensive to produce, quick drying, secure, and comfortable.

Thai fishermen do in reality wear this style of pants. They are also increasingly common among many men and women of all nationalities. This style of trousers is usually made of cotton or rayon but is also now widely available in a variety of styles and fabrics, such as hemp, bamboo, or linen.

<text>Orangeville (Canada 2021 Census population of 30,167) is a town in south-central Ontario, Canada, and the seat of Dufferin County.

==History==

The first patent of land was issued to Ezekiel Benson, a land surveyor, on August 7, 1820. That was followed by land issued to Alan Robinet in 1822. In 1863, Orangeville was named after Orange Lawrence, a businessman born in Connecticut in 1796 who owned several mills in the village. As a young man, he moved to Canada and settled in Halton County. During Mackenzie&#x27;s rebellion in 1837, he was a captain in the militia. Lawrence purchased the land that became Orangeville from Robert Hughson. He settled in the area in 1844 and established a mille. The post office dates from 1851. Orange Lawrence committed suicide December 15, 1861. In 1873, the Act of Incorporation was passed and Orangeville was given town status on January 1, 1874. The public library, located at Broadway and Mill Street, was completed in 1908. Andrew Carnegie, well-known businessman and philanthropist, provided financial assistance for its construction.

==Economy==
Orangeville serves as an administrative and commercial hub for Dufferin County, which sits to the north of the Region of Peel. Orangeville&#x27;s downtown core is home to a substantial number of retail stores, and there is a cluster of big-box stores in the Fairgrounds Shopping Centre. Many residents in and around Orangeville also commute to different areas of the Greater Toronto Area and Southwestern Ontario for work.

There are a number of manufacturing plants located in the town. Major commercial and industrial employers include: the Resolve Corporation, a provider of computer outsourcing services; Allied Threaded Products, a fastener manufacturer; Greening Donald, a maker of automotive airbag components; Clorox Company of Canada, Glad garbage bags; Relizon Canada, pressure-sensitive labels; Rochling Engineering Plastics, formerly Symplastics Limited, plastic sheets; and Sanoh Canada, automotive components. Orangeville is also the main banking centre for residents in the area.

==Transportation==

The main intersection in the heart of the town is Broadway (formerly Highway 9) and First Street. Highway 10 runs through Orangeville on its east side.

Beginning in 2005, a major roadwork project was initiated to resurface Broadway through Orangeville. The downtown section was completed in early 2006, with extensive work still to be done on the west end in late 2006. In conjunction with this project, there was another one completed in late 2006 that involved building large planters in the middle of Broadway through the downtown section between First and Third Streets (West - East). The project was controversial, as safety concerns had been raised by the fire department because the new concrete planters in the middle of the road have made the rights of way too narrow for fire trucks to properly set up in case of a fire in a downtown building.

A section of County Road 109, often referred to as the &quot;Orangeville bypass&quot;, is a bypass opened in 2005, running east–west connecting Highway 10 with a pre-existing section of County Road 109 that was formerly Highway 9 running west out of town. Much of the eastern stretch runs through the Town of Caledon, but officially enters Orangeville at the Townline Road intersection, where it is named Riddell Road. 

Orangeville Transit is the town&#x27;s public transit system, and there is a commuter GO Transit bus service to Brampton. In 2023, Orangeville Transit introduced a two-year pilot program of free public transport under which no fares were collected on any of its routes within the town. In 2024 the town announced the pilot program would continue until at least 2027. Orangeville became the largest town or city in Canada with free public transport.

In the early 1990s, preliminary plans were drawn up for GO Transit passenger rail service to Orangeville. However, it never got past the drawing board. Industries in Orangeville were served by the Orangeville Brampton Railway, which purchased of surplus track from the Canadian Pacific Railway. The railway connected with the CPR in Mississauga, and also serviced customers in Brampton to the south. From 2004 to 2018, a tourist train was operated on weekends in summer months. The last train out of Orangeville was December 17, 2021.

In 1906, survey work was underway for an electric railway line which would serve Orangeville, to be called the Huron and Ontario Electric Railway. The planned line would have connected Orangeville with Goderich, Ontario. The line was proposed during a period where electric railways was popular in Ontario but many would end up in the hands of Ontario Hydro in the 1930s or fail. Like the 1902 Ontario West Shore Railway this line was never built.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Orangeville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

According to the 2016 Canadian Census,the median age was 38.8 years, lower than the national median age of 41.2 years. The median value of a dwelling in Orangeville was $400,320, higher than the national average at $341,556, and the median household income (after-taxes) was $73,605, higher than the national median of $61,348.

==Education==
Upper Grand District School Board operates secular anglophone public schools. The Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board operates anglophone catholic public schools. The &quot;Conseil scolaire Viamonde&quot; operates secular francophone schools serving the area. The &quot;Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud&quot; operates catholic francophone schools serving the area.

There are currently eleven public and separate elementary schools in Orangeville: Credit Meadows, Mono Amaranth, Montgomery Village, Parkinson Centennial, Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, St. Andrew&#x27;s RC, St. Benedict&#x27;s RC, St. Peter&#x27;s RC, Island Lake Public School and Spencer Avenue Elementary. Along with these publicly funded schools, there are several private schools in the area: Headwater Hills Montessori School, Dufferin Area Christian School, Hillcrest Private School, The Maples Academy (IB World School), Orangeville Christian School.

A French elementary school named L&#x27;École élémentaire de Quatre-rivièrs (translated as &quot;Four Rivers Elementary School&quot;) currently resides in the old Springbrook Elementary building despite the reason for closing the school being &#x27;structural&#x27; problems. Most of these problems are said to be the result of &#x27;improper foundation for the area&#x27; as the school was built upon a swamp. It had been used as a holding school for other schools including Island Lake, Montgomery Village, and Princess Margaret, while repairs, renovations, rebuilds and construction were completed.

There are two secondary schools within the boundaries of Orangeville: Westside Secondary School and Orangeville District Secondary School (ODSS). A catholic secondary school Robert F. Hall Catholic Secondary School, despite being within the Region of Peel, draws around 1,000 students from Orangeville and elsewhere in Dufferin County.

Humber College has offered full-time programs at the Alder Street arena since 2007. In 2019, the college announced it would be closing the campus in June 2021.

Georgian College currently owns and operates a campus located at 22 Centennial Road, offering full- and part-time courses. It is also delivering employment programs and services out of a location on 51 Townline.

==Culture==
Orangeville hosts the annual Orangeville Blues and Jazz Festival, typically the first full weekend in June.

The Town Hall building contains the historic Orangeville Opera House on the second floor. The building was restored in 1993–1994. This facility is the home base of professional theatre company Theatre Orangeville, and hosts plays and concerts throughout the year.

Begun in 2003, Orangeville&#x27;s &quot;Art Walk of Tree Sculptures&quot; features more than 50 detailed works by local artists. The sculptures are carved from old maple trees that have died from natural causes. The largest tree sculpture is a tribute to Canadiana and the centrepiece of a small newly developed park. It is a story totem entitled &quot;Nature&#x27;s Unity&quot;, and celebrates Canada&#x27;s 150th birthday.

==Sports==
The Orangeville Flyers were a junior &#x27;A&#x27; ice hockey team and part of the Ontario Junior Hockey League. They played home games at the Alder Street Recreation Facility until moving to Brampton in 2018. Orangeville was also home to a professional basketball team, the Orangeville A&#x27;s of the National Basketball League of Canada, who played at the Orangeville Athlete Institute. The Athlete Institute Academy is home to Orangeville Prep, which has produced two top-10 NBA draft picks.

The Orangeville Northmen junior A and B box lacrosse teams are based in Orangeville. The Orangeville Otters are a competitive swim team based in Orangeville. The team trains at the Alder and Tony Rose pools.

==Media==
There are two local newspapers based in Orangeville, the &quot;Orangeville Citizen&quot; and the &quot;Orangeville Banner&quot;.

Two radio stations are licensed to Orangeville, adult contemporary CKMO-FM (&quot;FM 101 Orangeville&quot;) and rhythmic contemporary CIDC-FM (&quot;Z103.5&quot;). CKMO launched in 2015 and broadcasts from studios in downtown Orangeville. CIDC has historically targeted the broader Greater Toronto Area as a rimshot, and has usually marketed itself as a Toronto station (having moved its tower closer to the city, and operating from studios in Etobicoke) rather than operate as an Orangeville-specific outlet. It faced reprimands from the CRTC in 2016 for not regularly broadcasting news and information content of specific relevance to Orangeville.

Until June 2005, Rogers TV maintained its Peel North studio and production facility at 98 C-Line. The facility was closed to allow for expansion of the Peel North headend. Today, Rogers tv has a studio and production facility located at 70 C-line.

==Government and politics==
Orangeville is located in provincial electoral district of Dufferin—Caledon. This was changed from Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey when the Province instituted the 107 electoral districts revision in 2006. Its current Member of Provincial Parliament is Sylvia Jones, former assistant to Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leader, John Tory. Federally, Orangeville is located in the Dufferin—Caledon electoral district. Its elected Member of Parliament is currently Kyle Seeback of the Conservative Party.

<text>Robert Francis Kilvert (3 December 184023 September 1879), known as Francis or Frank, was an English clergyman whose diaries reflected rural life in the 1870s, and were published over fifty years after his death.

== Life ==

Kilvert was born on 3 December 1840 at The Rectory, Hardenhuish Lane, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, to the Rev. Robert Kilvert, rector of Langley Burrell, Wiltshire, and Thermuthis, daughter of Walter Coleman and Thermuthis Ashe.

He was educated privately in Bath by his uncle, Francis Kilvert, before going up to Wadham College, Oxford. He then entered the Church of England and became a rural curate, working primarily in the Welsh Marches between Hereford and Hay on Wye.

Initially, from 1863 to 1864, he was curate to his father at Langley Burrell, and in 1865 he became curate of Clyro, Radnorshire. There on 1 January 1870 he started a diary from which it appears that he basked in his life within the Welsh countryside, often writing several pages describing his surroundings and the parishioners that he visited.

In late 1871 he fell in love with Frances Eleanor Jane Thomas, the youngest daughter of William Thomas the vicar of Llanigon, a parish not far from Clyro, and asked her father for permission to marry her. Because of Kilvert&#x27;s position as a lowly curate, Frances&#x27; father looked unfavourably on the request and refused it. After receiving this rejection Kilvert wrote in his diary that &quot;The sun seemed to have gone out of the sky&quot;. Frances, who was referred to as Daisy in the diaries, would die a spinster in December 1928. Shortly after the rejection, in 1872, Kilvert resigned his position as curate of Clyro, and left the village, returning to his father&#x27;s parish of Langley Burrell. From 1876 to 1877 he was vicar of St Harmon, Radnorshire, and from 1877 to his death in 1879 he was vicar of Bredwardine, Herefordshire.

In August 1879 he married Elizabeth Ann Rowland (1846–1911), whom he had met on a visit to Paris, his best man was William Edward Thomas Morgan. Kilvert died from peritonitis on 23 September, aged 38, a few days after returning from his honeymoon in Scotland. He was buried at Bredwardine.

== Diaries ==

Kilvert is best known as the author of voluminous diaries describing rural life. After his death, his diaries were edited and censored, possibly by his widow. Later they were passed on to William Plomer who transcribed the remaining diaries and edited and published a three-volume selection &quot;Selections from the Diary of the Rev. Francis Kilvert&quot; (Jonathan Cape, Vol I: 1870–1871 pub. 1938, Vol II: 1871–1874 pub.1939, Vol III: 1874–1879 pub.1940), and later a one-volume selection &quot;Kilvert&#x27;s Diary, 1870–1879&quot; (Jonathan Cape, 1944—corrected in 1960, and with an abridged and illustrated version for children published as &quot;Ardizzone&#x27;s Kilvert&quot; in 1976). Published just before and during World War II, the first editions of the diaries were well received by the public when, in a period of bombing and rationing they provided an escapism back to the simpler and happier times of the mid Victorian era, still just within living memory.

A different selection from Plomer&#x27;s abridgement was published as &quot;Journal of a Country Curate: Selections from the Diary of Francis Kilvert&quot; by The Folio Society in 1960. In 1992 a new selection was published under the editorship of David Lockwood, &quot;Kilvert, the Victorian: A New Selection from Kilvert&#x27;s Diaries&quot; (Seren Books, 1992). Out of print since 1970, the three-volume indexed edition was reprinted in 2006 by O&#x27;Donoghue Books. In the 1950s, whilst Plomer was contemplating further publication of the remaining journals, it was found that the majority of the surviving diaries had been destroyed by their then owner, an elderly niece of Kilvert&#x27;s, who claimed to have done so to protect &quot;private family matters&quot;. This had occurred during a clear out of various personal papers, prior to moving into a residential care home. When confronted by this information Plomer was said to have recalled he &quot;could have strangled her with his bare hands.&quot; Only the three volumes listed below survived, which the said niece gave to other people. Plomer&#x27;s own transcription was destroyed by fire in the Blitz.

Despite Kilvert&#x27;s niece&#x27;s actions she ironically was a Vice-President, and an avid member of the Kilvert Society for many years up until her death in 1964.

Francis Kilvert also published pleasant but conventional poetry, republished by the Kilvert Society in &quot;Collected verse : 3rd December 1840 - 23rd September 1879 by the Reverend Francis Kilvert&quot; in 1968.

The &quot;Cornish Diary: Journal No.4, 1870—From 19 July to 6 August, Cornwall&quot; was published by Alison Hodge in 1989. The National Library of Wales, which holds two of the three surviving volumes, published &quot;The Diary of Francis Kilvert: April–June 1870&quot; in 1982 and &quot;The Diary of Francis Kilvert: June–July 1870&quot; in 1989.

A new edition of the abridged 1944 &quot;Diary&quot; was published in 2019 by Vintage Classics to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Kilvert starting his diary, which fell in January 2020. It includes a recently discovered photograph of Kilvert and a new introduction by Mark Bostridge.

==Nudism==
Kilvert was an enthusiast for public bathing in the nude, which he regarded as natural and healthy. The first entry in Kilvert&#x27;s diaries in which he records his naked bathing was for 4 September 1872, at Weston-super-Mare. He writes: &quot;Bathing in the morning before breakfast from a machine. Many people were openly stripping on the sands a little further on and running down into the sea and I would have done the same but I had brought down no towels of my own&quot;. However, next day Kilvert joins in the fun: &quot;I was out early before breakfast this morning bathing from the sands. There was a delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked to the sea where the waves were curling white with foam and the red morning sunshine glowing upon the naked limbs of the bathers&quot;.

==Relationships with girls==
Several modern writers have commented on passages in the diaries describing interactions with young girls which these days might raise suspicions of paedophilia. However, poet John Betjeman was among those who have since defended Kilvert, saying, &quot;If there had been anything sinister in his attentions to them, he would hardly have written so candidly in his diary about his feelings&quot;.

== Modern adaptations ==

A John Betjeman documentary on Kilvert, &quot;Vicar of this Parish&quot;, was shown on BBC television in 1976. This led to &quot;Kilvert&#x27;s Diary&quot; being dramatised (eighteen 15-minute episodes) on British television between 1977 and 1978, with Timothy Davies in the title role.

The diaries were dramatised on BBC Radio 4 (five episodes) in December 2019.

<text>DreamHack is an ESL Gaming brand specializing in esports tournaments and other gaming conventions. It is recognized by the Guinness Book of Records and Twin Galaxies as being the world&#x27;s largest LAN party and computer festival with the world&#x27;s fastest Internet connection and the most generated traffic. It usually holds its events in Western Europe and North America.

==Events summary==
DreamHack&#x27;s events include local area network gatherings with live concerts and competitions in digital art and esports. The first event was held in Malung, Sweden. The company has held several gaming events throughout Europe, in Stockholm, Jönköping, Tours, Bucharest, Cluj, Valencia, Seville, London, and Leipzig. In May 2016, it held its first North American event in Austin, Texas. In August 2016, it held its first Canada event in Montreal, Quebec. Winter events consistently have about 10% more visitors than summer events.

Attendees range from elementary school students to senior citizens. The average age is 16–17.

The event has five major components:
DreamHack events are arranged with the help of about 800 volunteers, set up in &quot;Crew Teams&quot;, who work in shifts to provide around-the-clock services for visitors. A support crew has a helpdesk where participants can address technical problems. The festival also relies on local police and security officers who patrol the area.

==History==
Dreamhack began as a small gathering of schoolmates and friends in the basement of an elementary school in Malung, Sweden, in the early 1990s. In 1994, it was moved to the school cafeteria and became one of the larger regional demo tech and gaming events at the time. This event was also the first to be called DreamHack.

In 1997, the event took place at Arena Kupolen in Borlänge and became the largest LAN party of Sweden and the third largest party in Scandinavia at the time. Furthermore, DreamHack 2001 and the upcoming events were held at the Elmia exhibition centre in Jönköping, where it has been since until the last Dreamhack Jönköping, both Winter and Summer, where held in 2024, after 30 years in the city.

In 2002, DreamHack had events twice a year. Initially, DreamHack Summer in June was focused on computer games, and DreamHack Winter was more focused on computer program demos and was held during the last weekend of November. Today, the focus of summer and winter is same.

In 2011, DreamHack AB went through a corporate reform, renewing the company administration.

DreamHack winter 2011 hosted League of Legends season 1 World Championship. The next year&#x27;s League of Legends World Championship was held independently.

It was announced on November 15, 2012, that DreamHack would be partnering with Major League Gaming (MLG) and Electronic Sports League (ESL) to help facilitate the growth and development of the North American and European esports scene. These partnerships included universal rankings, unified competition structures, and more.

In 2013, DreamHack AB grew into a corporation. Later they added a third event during the late summer in Stockholm. It was hosted at Globe Arenas in 2014.

In November 2015, Modern Times Group bought DreamHack for 244 million Swedish krona.

In response to the increasing visibility of older gamers, in June 2019 DreamHack hosted the first senior World Cup for Counter Strike.

In 2020, on the 30th of September, ESL announced that it had merged with DreamHack. The two companies are functioning as one, but the two brands are operated separately.

<doc id="1214825" wikidata="Q4115066" url="?curid=1214825" title="Chaand Raat">
<text>Chaand Raat () is a South Asian Cultural observance on the eve of the festival of Eid al-Fitr; it can also mean a night with a new moon for the new Islamic month Shawwal. Chaand Raat is a time of celebration when families and friends gather in open areas at the end of the last day of Ramadan to spot the new moon, which signals the arrival of the Islamic month of Shawwal and the day of Eid. Once the moon is sighted, people wish each other &quot;Eid Mubarak&quot; (&quot;Blessings of the Eid day&quot;). Women and girls decorate their hands with mehndi (henna), and people prepare desserts for the next day of Eid and do last rounds of shopping. City streets have a festive look, and brightly decorated malls and markets remain open late into the night. &quot;Chaand Raat&quot; is celebrated festively and passionately by Muslims (and occasionally non-Muslims as well) all over South Asia, and in socio-cultural significance, is comparable to Christmas Eve.

==Etymology==

The term is derived from the Hindustani &quot;chānd rāt&quot; (, ), literally translating to &#x27;moon night&#x27;. The two words in the term are derived from the Sanskrit words &quot;candrá&quot; (चंद्र) &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;rā́tri&quot; (रात्रि) &quot;night&quot;, respectively.

==Background==
&quot;Chaand Raat&quot; celebrations occur on the eve of Eid ul-Fitr, which is celebrated on 1 Shawwal. Originated in South Asia, the beginning of an Islamic month depends on the first sighting of the lunar crescent and thus the month of Ramadan can be of either 29 or 30 days. Chaand Raat occurs on the same evening on which first lunar crescent of the month of Shawwal is observed. As the exact day of Eid ul-Fitr is dependent on the moon sighting, Chaand Raat is often considered more festive on Eid ul-Fitr than Eid ul-Adha, which is known well in advance.

==Festivities==

Once the new moon is sighted, announcements are made from mosques, television channels and radio stations. Festivities begin almost instantly and continue all night until the morning Fajr prayer. Entire families head out towards the local bazaars, markets and shopping malls. Shoppers usually purchase last-minute items for Eid, such as shalwar kameez, bangles, jewelry, bags, and shoes. Gifts and sweets are brought for friends while toys are brought for children. Barber shops and beauty parlors are also heavily visited in the evening in preparation for the following day. At home, women and girls decorate their hands with mehndi. People also decorate their homes and begin preparing food for the holiday. Decorative lights are put up in markets as well as government buildings, banks and mosques. Chaand Raat also gives a chance for people to meet with friends and extended family.

<doc id="1214837" wikidata="Q5449754" url="?curid=1214837" title="Financial system in Australia">
<text>The [[Australia]]n financial system consists of the arrangements covering the borrowing and lending of funds and the transfer of ownership of financial claims in Australia, comprising:

* authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) or financial institutions, comprising banks, credit unions and building societies,
* non bank financial institutions (NBFI),
* insurance (life and general),
* superannuation,
* financial markets—debt, equity and derivative markets, and
* payments systems—cash, cheques, EFTPOS, RTGS and other high-value payment systems.

==Financial markets==
The main stock exchange operators in the Australian financial market are the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the smaller National Stock Exchange of Australia (NSX), both of which provide stock exchange facilities for Australian listed securities. NSX acquired the Bendigo Stock Exchange in June 2012 and merged its operations.

Most foreign exchange transactions are largely free from regulation, and the Reserve Bank of Australia has largely delegated its control to authorised money market dealers and foreign exchange dealers.

== Market participants ==

Participants in the financial system consist of commercial banks, investment banks, finance companies, building or cooperative societies, credit unions, friendly societies, non bank financial institutions (NBFI), superannuation and approved deposit funds, public unit trusts, cash management trusts, mortgage originators, insurance companies, institutional funds investing in and financing debt.

===Financial institutions===

Banking in Australia is dominated by what are known as the &quot;big four&quot;, which are also referred to as the pillars of Australia&#x27;s financial system:

* Commonwealth Bank
* Westpac
* Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group
* National Australia Bank

There are several smaller banks with a presence throughout the country, and a large number of other financial institutions, such as credit unions. Many large foreign banks have a presence, but few have a retail banking presence. The central bank is the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Since 2008 the Australian government has guaranteed deposits up to $250,000 per customer per institution against banking failure.

===Insurance market===

Australia&#x27;s insurance market can be divided into roughly three components: life insurance, general insurance and health insurance. These markets have been fairly distinct, with most larger insurers focusing on only one type. However, in recent times several insurance companies have broadened their scope into more general financial services, and have faced competition from banks and subsidiaries of foreign financial conglomerates.

===Superannuation===

Superannuation in Australia is government-supported and encouraged, and minimum provisions are compulsory for employees. Superannuation arrangements are provided by banks and insurance companies, though most funds are self-managed. Superannuation funds are tightly regulated.

==Payments and clearing systems==
There are several payment systems in use within Australia, many of which are regulated by Australian Payments Network (AusPayNet) (previously called Australian Payments Clearing Association (APCA)), including:

=== Cash ===
The Australian dollar is Australia’s currency and legal tender in Australia. Clearing and settling of cash payments (also called CS5) are regulated by AusPayNet as the Australian Cash Distribution Exchange System (ACDES).

=== Cheques ===
Cheques are still the most important non-cash payment instruments in Australia, in terms of the value transferred. The number of monthly cheque transactions in 2008 was 33.7 million with a value of $139.3 billion. Cheque use is in decline worldwide, but it is declining faster in Australia than many other countries. Between 2010 and 2014, cheque use in Australia declined by 42.8% with just over seven cheques written per person in 2014. In 2014, 166.6 million cheques were used in Australia, compared to 291.1 million in 2010. In 2015, cheque usage fell by a further 16.3%.

Cheques and other payment instruments (such as travellers cheques and warrants) (also called CS1) are cleared and settled in accordance with the regulations and procedures set by APCS.

Cheques use MICR encoding containing the BSB and account number to identify the bank and account to debit, as well as other information to streamline the processing of cheques. In 2014, the cost of processing cheques was the highest of all modes of payments at $5 per transaction, compared to about $0.20 for direct debits. 

A recent innovation has been digital cheque imaging, which involves images of cheques being captured by financial institutions and exchanged electronically between the relevant financial institutions rather than the previous costly practice of physically transporting paper cheques around Australia. This has also ended the need for maintaining long-term storage and retrieval systems. The new system speeds up the clearing process, with cheques being able to be cleared at the end of the next weekday after being presented, as opposed to up to the six weekdays under the old system.

=== Direct entry ===
Direct entry (also called CS2) can be used to transfer funds between bank accounts in Australia. Clearing and settling is regulated by AusPayNet as the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS).

Direct entry uses the BSB and account number to identify the bank and accounts to debit and credit. Some common uses of the direct entry system include:
* setting up monthly direct debits to pay recurring bills such as credit card bills
* transferring funds to other bank accounts, also known as third party transfers
* payment of wages and salaries
* government tax refunds and payments.

Participants of BECS exchange direct entry (DE) files at intervals through the day. Net positions are usually cleared daily.

=== EFTPOS ===
EFTPOS (Electronic Fund Transfer Point of Sale) and ATM transactions (also called CS3) occur over the EFT network. Clearing and settling of EFTPOS and ATM transactions are regulated by the AusPayNet as the Consumer Electronic Clearing System (CECS). Between 2005 and 2015, ATM withdrawals dropped by 11.5% but increased 5.1% in value.

=== Credit card ===
Several credit card systems are active in Australia including MasterCard, Visa, Diners Club and American Express. The Bankcard scheme is no longer in use.

=== BPAY ===
BPAY is a bill payment system used in Australia, which is regulated by the four major banks and not by AusPayNet. As of January 2015, the BPAY payments system covered more than 156 participating Australian banks, credit unions and financial institutions. More than 45,000 businesses accept payments using BPAY and each month approximately 30 million bills are paid to the value of $24 billion.

=== High value payments ===
High value payments (also known as CS4) are regulated by AusPayNet under the Regulations for High Value Clearing System Framework. The main high value payment systems in Australia are:
* Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication Payment Delivery System (SWIFT PDS)
* Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS): CHESS is an automated share transfer and settlement system developed by the Australian Securities Exchange. For a CHESS transaction, an interbank request is sent to RITS via SWIFT FIN, the service which sends financial information from one financial institution to another. When RITS notifies CHESS of settlement of the gross amount across ESAs, CHESS finalises the transaction by transferring share holdings at the participant level.
* Financial Transactions Recording and Clearance System (FINTRACS)
* Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS) is used by banks and other approved institutions to settle their payment obligations on a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) basis. Final and irrevocable settlement is achieved by the simultaneous crediting and debiting of Exchange Settlement Accounts (ESAs) held at the Reserve Bank.

=== New Payments Platform ===
The New Payments Platform (NPP) is open access infrastructure for fast payments in Australia. The NPP was developed via industry collaboration to enable households, businesses and government agencies to make simply addressed payments, with near real-time funds availability to the recipient, on a 24/7 basis. Each payment message is capable of carrying much richer remittance information than other systems. The NPP infrastructure supports the independent development of ‘overlay’ services to offer innovative payment services to end-users.

==Regulation==

Regulation of the financial system in Australia is split mainly between the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).

ASIC has responsibility for market integrity and consumer protection and the regulation of certain financial institutions (including investment banks and finance companies or NBFI). The general regulatory position is that a legal person carrying on a financial services business in Australia must either hold an Australian financial services licence issued to that person by ASIC or fall within a licensing exemption.

APRA is responsible for the licensing and prudential supervision of ADIs (banks, building societies, credit unions, friendly societies and participants in certain credit card schemes and certain purchaser payment facilities), life and general insurance companies and superannuation funds. APRA has issued capital adequacy guidelines for banks which are consistent with the Basel II guidelines. All financial institutions regulated by APRA are required to report on a periodic basis to APRA. Certain financial intermediaries, such as investment banks (which do not otherwise operate as ADIs) are neither licensed nor regulated under the Banking Act and are not subject to the prudential supervision of APRA. They may be required to obtain licences under the Corporations Act 2001 or other Commonwealth or state legislation, depending on the nature of their business activities in Australia.

Most investment banks are registered under the &quot;Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001&quot;. This Act requires registered financial corporations to provide statistical information to APRA.

The Reserve Bank of Australia is the country&#x27;s central bank, with responsibility for most payment systems and setting of monetary policy.

Since 1996 the provision of credit to individuals for personal, household or domestic purposes has been regulated by the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, which has been implemented in all Australian states and territories.

Businesses providing financial products and services are required to identify and monitor customers using a risk-based approach, develop and maintain a compliance program, report suspicious matters and certain cash transactions and file annual compliance reports.
