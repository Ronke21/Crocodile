<text>Alfred Percival Maudslay (18 March 1850 – 22 January 1931) was a British colonial administrator and archaeologist. He pioneered the careful archaeological study of the Maya ruins and the results of his field work were presented in &quot;Biologia Centrali-Americana: Archaeology&quot; (1889–1902). The massive five volume set continues to serve as an important work of reference for the study of Maya culture. In 1908, he made a complete translation, with annotations, of Bernal Díaz del Castillo&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;. His translation remains the standard English edition.

==Early life==
Maudslay was born into a wealthy family at Lower Norwood Lodge, near London, on 18 March 1850. He was the eighth of nine children born to Joseph Maudslay and Anna Maria, née Johnson. His grandfather was the eminent engineer Henry Maudslay, founder of the family engineering firm. After attending Harrow School, Maudslay studied natural sciences at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and obtained a BA in 1872.

While at Cambridge, Maudslay studied comparative anatomy with John Willis Clark who was also an archaeologist.They remained friends after graduation and Clark may have influenced Maudslay&#x27;s future pursuit of the subject. Maudslay also became acquainted with Osbert Salvin, a well-known ornithologist.

Upon graduation, Maudslay enrolled in medical school, but deferred his studies and travelled with his brother instead. They toured Central America, Mexico and parts of the United States, including the recently established Yosemite Park. After returning home, Maudslay again postponed medical school and travelled to Iceland in 1873. Afterwards, his chronic bronchitis led him to drop plans for a medical career and leave England for a warmer climate.

==Colonial administration==
In 1874, Maudslay travelled to Jamaica with the intention of establishing a tobacco plantation. An outbreak of yellow fever on the island forced him to change plans and head for Trinidad. On his way there he made the acquaintance of William Cairns, a colonial administrator who was assuming the governorship of Trinidad. Cairn convinced Maudslay to take a job as his personal secretary. A short time later, he transferred with Cairns to Queensland, Australia. 

Maudslay found Cairns difficult to work for, and in 1875 he moved to Fiji to work with Arthur Gordon, its governor, and helped in the campaign against rebellious local tribes. Later he served as British consul in Tonga and Samoa. 

While in the South Pacific, Maudsley became interested in the collection of ethnographic materials. Eventually, his donation of these materials to Cambridge contributed to the formation of the University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Before he left the region, Maudsley was thinking seriously of pursuing an interest in archaeology. His Cambridge friend, ornithologist Osbert Salvi, encouraged him to explore the Maya ruins of Quiriguá and Copán. 

In February 1880, Maudslay resigned from the colonial service to pursue his own interests, having spent six years in the British Pacific colonies. He then joined his siblings in Calcutta during their round-the-world trip, returned to Britain in December, and then set out for Guatemala via British Honduras.

==Archaeologist==
In Guatemala, Maudslay began the major archaeological work for which he is best remembered. He started at the Maya ruins of Quirigua and Copan where, with the help of Frank Sarg, he hired labourers to help clear and survey the remaining structures and artefacts. Sarg also introduced Maudslay to the newly found ruins in Tikal and to reliable guide Gorgonio López. Maudslay was the first to describe the site of Yaxchilán. With Teobert Maler, Alfred Maudslay explored Chichén in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs. Maudslay published the first long-form description of Chichen Itza in his book, &quot;Biologia Centrali-Americana&quot;.

In the course of his surveys, Maudslay pioneered many of the later archaeological techniques. He hired Italian expert Lorenzo Giuntini and technicians to make plaster casts of the carvings, while Gorgonio López made casts of papier-mâché. Artist Annie Hunter drew impressions of the casts before they were shipped to museums in England and the United States. Maudslay also took numerous detailed photographs – dry plate photography was then a new technique – and made copies of the inscriptions.

All told, Maudslay made a total of six expeditions to Maya ruins. After 13 years of preparation, he published his findings in 1902 as a 5-volume compendium entitled &quot;Biologia Centrali-Americana: Archaeology&quot;. One volume of text describes the four volumes of photographs, site plans, and color drawings of Maya ruins. At Maudslay&#x27;s request, an interpretation of Maya calendar glyphs by Joseph Thompson Goodman was added as an appendix. The accuracy and attention to detail set a standard for future archaeological reports.

Maudslay also applied for permission to make a survey of Monte Albán in Oaxaca but when he finally received permission in 1902, he could no longer finance the work with his own money. The firm of &quot;Maudslay, Sons and Field&quot; had gone bankrupt and reduced Maudslay&#x27;s income. He unsuccessfully applied for funding from the Carnegie Institution. The Maudslays moved to San Ángel near Mexico City for two years.

In 1905, Maudslay began to translate the memoirs of Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who had been a soldier in the troops of the conquistadors; he completed it in 1912. In 1907 the Maudslays moved permanently back to Britain. Maudslay become a President of the Royal Anthropological Institute 1911–12. He also chaired the 18th International Congress of Americanists in London in 1912.

==Personal life==
In 1892, Maudslay married US-born Anne Cary Morris, a granddaughter of Gouverneur Morris. For their honeymoon, the couple sailed to Guatemala via New York and San Francisco. There the Maudslays worked for two weeks on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. Their account was published in 1899 as &quot;A Glimpse at Guatemala&quot;. Annie Maudslay died in 1926. In 1928, Maudslay married widow Alice Purdon. In the following years he finished his memoirs, &quot;Life in the Pacific Fifty Years Ago&quot;.

Alfred Maudslay died on 22 January 1931 in Hereford, England. His cremated remains were interred in the crypt of Hereford Cathedral next to his first wife. Materials he collected are currently stored at Harvard and the British Museum.

<doc id="1211556" wikidata="Q317126" url="?curid=1211556" title="Joseph of Anchieta">
<text>José de Anchieta y Díaz de Clavijo, SJ (Joseph of Anchieta; 19 March 1534 – 9 June 1597) was a Canarian Jesuit missionary to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in the second half of the 16th century. A highly influential figure in Brazil&#x27;s history in the first century after its European discovery, Anchieta was one of the founders of São Paulo in 1554 and of Rio de Janeiro in 1565. He is the first playwright, the first grammarian and the first poet born in the Canary Islands, and is considered the father of Brazilian literature. 

Anchieta took part in the religious instruction, evangelization, and conversion to the Catholic faith of the Indian population. His efforts along with those of another Jesuit missionary, Manuel da Nóbrega, at Indian pacification were crucial to the establishment of stable colonial settlements in the colony.

With his book &quot;Arte de gramática da língua mais usada na costa do Brasil&quot; (1595), Anchieta became the first person to provide an orthography to Old Tupi, the language most commonly spoken along the coast of Brazil.

Anchieta is familiarly known as &quot;the Apostle of Brazil&quot;. He was canonized by Pope Francis on 3 April 2014. He was the second native of the Canary Islands, after Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur – also a missionary to Latin America – to be declared a saint by the Catholic Church, both canonized in the 21st century. Anchieta is also considered the third saint of Brazil.

== Early life ==
Anchieta was born on 19 March 1534, in San Cristóbal de La Laguna on Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain, to a wealthy family. He was baptized on 7 April 1534 in the Parish of Our Lady of Remedies (now La Laguna Cathedral). He lived in his family home, a building now known as Casa Anchieta, in La Laguna until he was 14 years old.

His father, Juan López de Anchieta y Zelayaran, was a landowner from Urrestilla, in the Basque Country. He had escaped to Tenerife in 1525 after participating in an unsuccessful rebellion against the Emperor Charles V. Through him, Anchieta was related to Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus. His mother was Mencia Díaz de Clavijo y Llarena, a descendant of Castillian conquerors of Tenerife. Mencia was the daughter of Sebastián de Llarena, a Jew who had converted to Christianity, from the kingdom of Castile, and his wife.

At the age of 14, Anchieta went to study in Portugal at the Royal College of Arts in Coimbra. He was intensely religious and felt he had a vocation to the priesthood. He sought admission to the Jesuit College of the University of Coimbra and was accepted into the Jesuits on 1 May 1551, at the age of 17. While a novice, he nearly ruined his health by his excessive austerity. He had an injury to the spine that made him nearly a hunchback. He learned to write Portuguese and Latin, in addition to Spanish.

== Missionary in Brazil ==
In 1553, the Jesuits included Anchieta among the third group of their members sent to the Portuguese colony of Brazil, believing that the climate would improve his health. After a perilous journey and a shipwreck, Anchieta and his small group of survivors arrived in São Vicente. It was the first village to have been founded by the Portuguese in Brazil. There he made his first contact with the Tapuia Indians living in the region.

In late 1553, Manuel da Nóbrega, the first Provincial of the Jesuits in Brazil, sent 13 Jesuits including Anchieta to climb the Serra do Mar to a plateau along the Tietê River that the Indians called &quot;piratininga&quot; (from Tupi &quot;pira&quot; &quot;fish&quot; + &quot;tininga&quot; &quot;drying&quot; – according to Anchieta, more than 12,000 fish could be found drying along the Tietê River floodplains after one of its customary floods). 

There the Jesuits established a small missionary settlement and celebrated Mass for the first time on 25 January 1554, date of the conversion of Saint Paul, according to tradition. That date is now celebrated as the founding of São Paulo. Anchieta and his Jesuit colleagues began their efforts to instruct the native people in the rudiments of Christianity and convert them, while also introducing basic education in other subjects. He taught Latin to the Indians, began to learn their language, Old Tupi, and started compiling a dictionary and a grammar. Their mission settlement, the Jesuit College of São Paulo of Piratininga, soon developed into a small population center.

Anchieta and Nóbrega had long opposed the way the Portuguese colonists were treating the Indians and had a serious conflict about it with Duarte da Costa. He served as second Governor-General of Brazil from 1553 to 1558. The Jesuits nevertheless supported the Portuguese against their French rivals in establishing claims to Brazil. They welcomed the support of Portuguese authorities against the Huguenot Protestants whom the French at times welcomed to their settlements. 

The two Jesuits perceived the French colony as a generally Protestant enterprise, ignoring its Catholic components and making no distinction between Lutherans and Calvinists. Anchieta recognized that violence could be necessary to create the conditions for evangelizing the indigenous inhabitants. He later praised the colony&#x27;s third Governor General, Mem de Sá (1500–1572), for what he accomplished in eliminating cannibalism, even though it was done by killing large numbers of Amerindians.

Due to the systematic killings and ransacking of their villages by Portuguese colonists, together with attempts to enslave them, the Indian tribes along the coast of the present-day states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo rebelled and formed an alliance, the Tamoyo Confederation. They allied with the French colonists who had settled in Guanabara Bay in 1555 under the command of Vice-Admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon. 

The conflict was brutal and at once international and inter-religious. In one instance the Portuguese hanged ten Frenchmen in an attempt to intimidate their enemies into submission. In another in 1557, a Protestant named Jacques le Balleur was put to death. By some accounts, Anchieta helped the executioner carry out the sentence, though the facts are much disputed.

The Tamoyo Confederation attacked São Paulo several times between 1562 and 1564 without success. Anchieta and Nóbrega initiated peace negotiations with the Tamoyo in the village of Iperoig in modern Ubatuba on the northern coast of São Paulo state. Anchieta&#x27;s skill with the Tupi language was crucial in these efforts. After many incidents and the near massacre of Anchieta and Nóbrega by the Indians, they finally succeeded in gaining the Indians&#x27; confidence. Peace was established between the Tamoyo and Tupiniquim nations and the Portuguese.

Portuguese-French hostilities were renewed in 1565 when Estácio de Sá, a nephew of the new Governor-General of Brazil, Mem de Sá, was ordered to expel the French colonists. With the support of Anchieta and Nóbrega, he departed with an army from São Vicente and founded the ramparts of Rio de Janeiro at the foot of Pão de Açúcar. Anchieta was with him and participated in a number of battles between the Portuguese and the French, each side supported by their Indian allies. He acted as a surgeon and interpreter. He also reported back to the governor-general&#x27;s headquarters in Salvador, Bahia. Anchieta participated in the final victorious battle against the French in 1567.

After the peace settlement, a Jesuit college was founded in Rio under the direction of Nóbrega. Anchieta was invited to remain and succeeded him upon his death in 1570. Despite his frailty and ill health, and the rigors of slow travel by foot and ship, over the next ten years Anchieta traveled extensively among Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Espírito Santo and São Paulo, consolidating the Jesuit mission in Brazil. In 1577 the fourth superior general of the Jesuits, Everard Mercurian, appointed Anchieta as provincial superior of the order&#x27;s members in Brazil.

As his health worsened, Anchieta requested relief from his duties in 1591. He died in Brazil on 9 June 1597, at Reritiba, Espírito Santo.

== Works ==
In the tradition of Jesuits, Anchieta was a prolific rapporteur, communicating by letters to his superiors. His reports establish him as an ethnographer, though he focused on Amerindian behavior that did not follow European norms, such as their choice of marriage partners, cannibalism, and the role of sorcerers. His detailed testimony with respect to cannibalism is often cited by anthropologists. He explained, for example, that the Amerindians &quot;believe that true kinship comes from the side of the fathers, who are the agents, and ... that the mothers are nothing more than bags in which the children grow&quot; and therefore treat the children of a captured female and a member of their tribe with respect but sometimes eat the children of a captured male and a female member of their own tribe. He detailed the practice of polygamy and, because it had produced dense networks of interrelations, advocated easing the church&#x27;s consanguinity rules to allow all but brothers and sisters to marry.

Anchieta was a pioneer in transcribing the Old Tupi language and authored the first published work on that language, a &quot;pathbreaking&quot; grammar, &quot;Arte de gramática da língua mais usada na costa do Brasil&quot;, written in 1555 and published in 1589. According to one assessment, &quot;His grammar and dictionary still rank among the best ever produced of a Brazilian language, nearly 500 years later... Anchieta was a dedicated linguist whose work can be considered the beginning of Amazonian linguistics (indeed it would not be stretching matters too far to call his work the beginning of linguistics in the Americas).&quot; His written works in the indigenous language span theology, religious instruction, theater and poetry.

He was also a historian, author of a biography of Mem de Sá. Composed of hexameters, &quot;De Gestis Mendi de Saa&quot; is the first epic about the Americas. It presents de Sá as &quot;a Christian Ulysses determined to oust Satan&quot; who &quot;presides ... over hordes of demonic Amerindians, creatures devoted to dismembering bodies&quot;. With the arrival of the Jesuits, &quot;the Cross expels demons&quot; and &quot;shamans lose preternatural power as they move from the wilderness into the civilized missions&quot;. His other major poem was &quot;De Beata Virgine Dei Matre&quot;, a poem to the Virgin Mary. Tradition holds that Anchieta composed it while in captivity at Iperoig in 1563 by writing verses in the wet sand of the beach and memorizing each day&#x27;s lines so that upon his release he could write its 4,900 verses on paper in their entirety.

His dramas, written in a combination of Tupi, Portuguese, Spanish, and Latin, were not meant for the stage but for performance by local amateurs in village squares and churchyards. They were traditional in form, written in verse with five-line stanzas, a literary form known as the &quot;auto&quot;, a Portuguese devotional drama, following the tradition the Jesuits had developed of using the theater first in classrooms and then for popular instruction. Casts were all male, both native and European, and both groups were meant to learn from the dramas&#x27; instruction in Christian morals. They were written for special occasions like a saint&#x27;s feast day or to mark the arrival of relics in the colony. Scholars have noted that they contain considerable &quot;contextual information&quot;, that is references to local events such as village rivalries. For example, Amerindian cannibalism is juxtaposed with the roasting of Lawrence of Rome. Few of his plays survive, but those that do have been praised, despite being crafted for a local audience with a didactic purpose, for their &quot;remarkable feeling for spectacle, calling for the use of body paint, native costumes, song and dance, fights, torches, and processions&quot;. A performance might even call for cannon fire from a nearby ship, though the plays were typically &quot;short on action and long on explanations of doctrine&quot; and characters fall clearly into positive and negative types. Anchieta&#x27;s &quot;auto da pregação universel&quot; of 1567 and published in 1672 is the first dramatic text in Brazilian letters.

As a keen naturalist, he described several new plants and animals among the novelties of Brazil&#x27;s wildlife and geography.

His lucid and detailed reports are still important for understanding the beliefs, manners, and customs of the native peoples and European settlers of the sixteenth century.

He was also an excellent surgeon and physician.

His manuscripts were gathered from archives in Portugal and Brazil in the 1730s as part of the process for his beatification and deposited in Rome. His works have been published as &quot;Cartas, Informações, Fragmentos Históricos e Sermões&quot; (Letters, Reports, Historical Fragments and Sermons).

== Legacy ==
José de Anchieta is celebrated as the founder of Brazilian letters and, with Nóbrega, Apostle of Brazil. He has given his name to two cities, Anchieta, in the State of Espírito Santo (formerly called Reritiba, the place where he died), and Anchieta, in the state of Santa Catarina, as well as many other places, roads, institutions, hospitals, and schools. The French botanist A.St.-Hil., who explored Brasil in the 19th century, named a climbing vine of the Violaceae family for the late Jesuit: &quot;Anchietea&quot;.

In 1965, the Spanish postal service issued a stamp with the image of Anchieta, in a series called &quot;Los Forjadores de América&quot;.

Ney Latorraca starred in the Brazilian biographical film, &quot;Anchieta, José do Brasil&quot;, which was released in 1977.

===Veneration===
Anchieta&#x27;s cause was formally opened on 22 June 1624, granting him the title of Servant of God. His spiritual writings were approved by theologians on 11 December 1734, and Pope Benedict XI declared him Venerable on 10 August 1736.

When beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1980, Anchieta acquired the title &quot;Blessed José de Anchieta.&quot; Pope Francis announced his canonization as a saint on 3 April 2014. The announcement was first communicated to three priests from the Canary Islands (hometown of Anchieta) who attended the Mass of the Pope in his residence in Santa Marta, who communicated it to the Bishop of Tenerife, Bernardo Álvarez Afonso.

He used a process known as equivalent canonization that dispenses with the standard judicial procedures and ceremonies in the case of someone long venerated. Anchieta was the first Spaniard canonized by Pope Francis.

During and after his life, José de Anchieta was considered almost a supernatural being. Many legends formed around him, such as that he once preached to and calmed an attacking jaguar. To this day, a popular devotion holds that praying to Anchieta protects against animal attacks.

José de Anchieta is highly revered in the Canary Islands. A bronze statue by Brazilian artist Bruno Giorgi in the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna depicts José de Anchieta departing for Portugal. It was a gift from the Government of Brazil to Anchieta&#x27;s hometown, where a wooden image of him is also venerated in the Cathedral of La Laguna and carried in procession through the streets every 9 June. In the Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria (patron saint of the Canary Islands), there is a painting of José de Anchieta founding the city of São Paulo. In 1997, a biographical comic book was published.

==Patronage==
José de Anchieta is the patron saint and model of catechists. He was also declared by Pope Benedict XVI as one of the thirteen Intercessors of the World Youth Day 2013, held in Rio de Janeiro.

In April 2015 he was declared by the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil a copatron of Brazil, whose patron saint is Our Lady of Aparecida.

==Shrines in his honor==
The main shrines dedicated to Saint José de Anchieta in Brazil and the Canary Islands are those that are directly related to his life:

* (Canary Islands): In the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, his place of birth, the main diocesan shrine is the Cathedral of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, where he was baptized in 1534 and where his image is venerated. Each 9 June in this city flowers are strewn at the large bronze statue of the saint and a solemn Mass is held in the cathedral with the Bishop of Tenerife presiding, followed by a procession with his image through the streets to his birthplace, where flowers are again strewn.
* : The National Shrine of San José de Anchieta is located in the town of Reritiba (now called &quot;Anchieta&quot;) in the state of Espírito Santo. The sanctuary has an important museum of sacred art and is built in the place where he lived the last years of his life and died. Here the national holiday dedicated to the saint is celebrated with pilgrimages of faithful from throughout Brazil. Following the declaration of Anchieta as copatron of Brazil in 2015, the church was declared a &quot;National Shrine&quot;.

<doc id="1211558" wikidata="Q459906" url="?curid=1211558" title="Alejandro Malaspina">
<text>Alejandro Malaspina (November 5, 1754 – April 9, 1810) was a Tuscan explorer who spent most of his life as a Spanish naval officer. Under a Spanish royal commission, he undertook a voyage around the world from 1786 to 1788, then, from 1789 to 1794, a scientific expedition (the Malaspina Expedition) throughout the Pacific Ocean, exploring and mapping much of the west coast of the Americas from Cape Horn to the Gulf of Alaska, crossing to Guam and the Philippines, and stopping in New Zealand, Australia, and Tonga.

Malaspina was christened &quot;Alessandro&quot;, the Italian form of &quot;Alexander&quot;. He signed his letters in Spanish &quot;Alexandro&quot;, which is usually modernized to &quot;Alejandro&quot; by scholars.

==Early life==
Malaspina was born in Mulazzo, a small principality ruled by his family, then part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, a fiefdom of the Holy Roman Empire. Alessandro&#x27;s parents were the Marquis Carlo Morello and Caterina Meli Lupi di Soragna. From 1762 to 1765, his family lived in Palermo with Alessandro&#x27;s great-uncle, Giovanni Fogliani Sforza d&#x27;Aragona, the viceroy of Sicily. From 1765 to 1773 he studied at the Clementine College in Rome. In 1773 he was accepted into the Order of Malta and spent about a year living on the island of Malta where he learned the basics of sailing.

==Naval service==
Malaspina entered the Royal Navy of Spain in 1774 and received the rank of &quot;Guardiamarina&quot;.

Between 1774 and 1786 he took part in a number of naval battles and received many promotions. In January 1775, aboard the frigate &quot;Santa Teresa&quot;, Malaspina was part of the expedition to relieve Melilla, which was under siege by Moroccans. Shortly after he was promoted to frigate-ensign (&quot;alférez de fragata&quot;). In July 1775 he participated the siege of Algiers and in 1776 was promoted to ship&#x27;s ensign (&quot;alférez de navío&quot;).

From 1777 to 1779, aboard the frigate &quot;Astrea&quot;, Malaspina made a round-trip voyage to the Philippines, rounding the Cape of Good Hope in both directions. During the voyage he was promoted to frigate-lieutenant (&quot;teniente de fragata&quot;). In January 1780 he was in the Battle of Cape Santa Maria and shortly thereafter was promoted to ship&#x27;s lieutenant (&quot;teniente de navío&quot;). During the Great Siege of Gibraltar, in September 1782, Malaspina served on a &quot;floating battery.&quot; In December of the same year, aboard the &quot;San Justo&quot;, Malaspina participated in the fighting at Cape Espartel. He was soon promoted once again, to frigate-captain (&quot;capitán de fragata&quot;).

In 1782 he was suspected of heresy and denounced to the Spanish Inquisition, but was not apprehended.

From March 1783, to July 1784, Malaspina was second-in-command of the frigate &quot;Asunción&quot; during a trip to the Philippines. As with his first trip to the Philippines the route went by the Cape of Good Hope in both directions. In 1785, back in Spain, Malaspina, on board the brigantine &quot;Vivo&quot;, took part in hydrographic surveys and mapping of parts of the coast of Spain. During the same year he was named Lieutenant of the Company of the Guardiamarinas of Cádiz.

==Circumnavigation==

From 15 September 1786 to 18 May 1788 Malaspina made a commercial circumnavigation of the world on behalf of the Royal Company of the Philippines. During this voyage he was in command of the frigate &quot;Astrea&quot;. His route went via Cape Horn and, returning, the Cape of Good Hope. In February 1787, the &quot;Astrea&quot; called at Concepción in Chile, whose military governor, the Irish-born Ambrosio O&#x27;Higgins, had six months before recommended that Spain organize an expedition to the Pacific similar to those led by Lapérouse and Cook. O&#x27;Higgins had made this recommendation following the visit of the Lapérouse expedition to Concepción in March 1786, and presumably discussed it with Malaspina while the &quot;Astrea&quot; was at Concepción. Following the &quot;Astrea&quot;&#x27;s return to Spain, Malaspina, in partnership with José de Bustamante and advised by Francisco Muñoz y San Clemente, produced a proposal for an expedition along the lines set out in OHiggins&#x27;s memorandum. A short time later, on 14 October 1788, Malaspina was informed of the government&#x27;s acceptance of his plan. José de Espinoza y Tello, one of the officers of the Malaspina expedition, subsequently confirmed the importance of the information sent by O&#x27;Higgins in stimulating the Government to initiate an extensive program of exploration in the Pacific. The prompt acceptance of Malaspina&#x27;s proposal was stimulated by news that the Russian government was preparing the Mulovsky expedition to the North Pacific, which had as one objective the claiming of territory around Nootka Sound that was also claimed by Spain (see Nootka Crisis and Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest).

==Expedition of 1789–1794==

In September 1788, Alessandro Malaspina and José de Bustamante y Guerra approached the Spanish government. The explorers proposed a scientific-political expedition that would visit nearly all the Spanish possessions in America and Asia. The Spanish king, Charles III, a promoter of science in the Spanish Empire, approved.

Two corvettes were built under Malaspina&#x27;s direction specifically for the expedition: &quot;Descubierta&quot; and &quot;Atrevida&quot; (meaning &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Daring&quot; or &quot;Bold&quot;). Malaspina commanded &quot;Descubierta&quot; and Bustamante &quot;Atrevida&quot;. The names were chosen by Malaspina to honor James Cook&#x27;s &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot;. The two corvettes were constructed by the shipbuilder Tómas Muñoz at the La Carraca shipyard. They were both 306 tons burden and 36 metres long, with a normal load displacement of 4.2 metres. They were launched together on April 8, 1789.

The expedition was under the &quot;dual command&quot; of Malaspina and Bustamante. Although in time the expedition became known as the Malaspina&#x27;s, Bustamante was never considered subordinate. Malaspina insisted on their equality, yet Bustamante early acknowledged Malaspina as the &quot;chief of the expedition.&quot;
The expedition sailed from Cádiz on July 30, 1789. The bohemian naturalist Thaddäus Haenke missed the boat, but joined in 1790 in Santiago de Chile after crossing South America by land from Montevideo.

The expedition had explicitly scientific goals, as had the recent voyages of James Cook and Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. Some of the leading scientists of the day accompanied Malaspina. The scientific data collected during the expedition surpassed that of Cook, but due to changed political circumstances in Spain Malaspina was jailed upon return and the reports and collections locked up and banned from publication. The expedition and its findings remained obscure and nearly unstudied by historians until the late 20th century.

Malaspina stopped at Montevideo and Buenos Aires, investigating the political situation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. After rounding Cape Horn, the expedition stopped at Talcahuano, the port of Concepción in present-day Chile, and again at Valparaíso, the port of Santiago. Continuing north, Bustamante mapped the coast while Malaspina sailed to the Juan Fernández Islands in order to resolve conflicting data on their location. The two captains reunited at Callao, the port of Lima. There investigations were made into the political situation of the Viceroyalty of Peru. The expedition then continued north, mapping the coast, to Acapulco, Mexico. A team of officers was sent to Mexico City to investigate the archives and political situation of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.

By the time Malaspina reached Mexico it was 1791, and there he received a dispatch from the king of Spain, ordering him to search for a Northwest Passage in the region of latitude 60 degrees N, newly thought to have been discovered many years previously. Malaspina had been planning to sail to Hawaii and Kamchatka, as well as the Pacific Northwest. Instead, he sailed from Acapulco directly to Yakutat Bay, Alaska (then known as Port Mulgrave), where the rumored passage was said to exist. Finding only an inlet, he carefully surveyed the Alaskan coast west to Prince William Sound.

At Yakutat Bay, the expedition made contact with the Tlingit. Spanish scholars made a study of the tribe, recording information on social mores, language, economy, warfare methods, and burial practices. Artists with the expedition, Tomas de Suria and José Cardero, produced portraits of tribal members and scenes of Tlingit daily life. A glacier between Yakutat Bay and Icy Bay was subsequently named after Malaspina. The botanist Luis Née also accompanied the expedition, during which he collected and described numerous new plants.

Knowing that Cook had previously surveyed the coast west of Prince William Sound and found no passage, Malaspina ceased his search at that point and sailed to the Spanish outpost at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island.

Malaspina&#x27;s expedition spent a fortnight at Nootka Sound. While at Nootka, the expedition&#x27;s scientists made a study of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka peoples). The relationship between the Spanish and the Nootkas was at its lowest point when Malaspina arrived. Malaspina and his crew were able greatly to improve the relationship, which was one of their objectives and reasons for stopping in the first place. Owing in part to Malaspina&#x27;s ability to bequeath generous gifts from his well-supplied ships about to return to Mexico, the friendship between the Spanish and the Nootkas was strengthened. The gaining of the Nootka chief Maquinna&#x27;s trust was particularly significant, as he was one of the most powerful chiefs of the region and had been very wary of the Spanish when Malaspina arrived. His friendship strengthened the Spanish claim to Nootka Sound, which was in question after the Nootka Crisis and resolved in the subsequent Nootka Conventions. The Spanish government was eager for the Nootka to agree formally that the land upon which the Spanish outpost stood had been ceded freely and legally. This desire had to do with Spain&#x27;s negotiations with Britain than over Nootka Sound and the Pacific Northwest. Malaspina was able to acquire exactly what the government wanted. After weeks of negotiations the principal Nootka chief, Maquinna, agreed that the Spanish would always remain owners of the land they then occupied, and that they had acquired it with all due propriety. The outcome of the Nootka Convention depended in part on this pact.

In addition to the expedition&#x27;s work with the Nootkas, astronomical observations were made to fix the location of Nootka Sound and calibrate the expedition&#x27;s chronometers. Nootka Sound was surveyed and mapped with an accuracy far greater than had previously been available. Unexplored channels were investigated. The maps were also linked to the baseline established by Captain Cook, allowing calibration between Spanish and British charts. Botanical studies were carried out, including an attempt to make a type of beer out of spruce needles that was hoped to have anti-scorbutic properties for combating scurvy. The expedition ships took on water and wood, and provided the Spanish outpost with many useful goods, including medicines, food, various tools and utensils, and a Réaumur scale thermometer.

After departing Nootka Sound the two ships sailed south, stopping at the Spanish settlement and mission at Monterey, California, before returning to Mexico.

In 1792, back in Mexico, Malaspina dispatched two schooners (or &quot;goletas&quot;) to conduct more detailed explorations of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia. These were &quot;Sutíl&quot;, commanded by Dionisio Alcalá Galiano, and &quot;Mexicana&quot;, under Cayetano Valdés y Flores. Both were officers subordinate to Malaspina. The ships were to have been commanded by two pilots of San Blas, Mexico, but Malaspina arranged for his own officers to replace them.

In 1792, Malaspina&#x27;s expedition sailed from Mexico across the Pacific Ocean. They stopped briefly at Guam before arriving at the Philippines, where they spent several months, mostly at Manila. During this period Malaspina sent Bustamante in the &quot;Atrevida&quot; to Macau, China.

After Bustamante&#x27;s return the expedition left the Philippines and sailed to New Zealand. They explored Doubtful Sound at the southern end of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, mapping and carrying out gravity experiments. Then Malaspina sailed to Port Jackson (Sydney). on the coast of New South Wales Australia, which had been established by the British in 1788. During the expedition&#x27;s stay at Sydney Cove, New South Wales, in March–April 1793, Thaddäus Haenke carried out observations and made collections relating to the natural history of the place, as he reported to the colony&#x27;s patron, Sir Joseph Banks, saying: &quot;I here express the public testimony of a grateful soul for the very extraordinary humanity and kindness with which the English in their new Colony welcomed us wandering vagabonds, Ulysses&#x27; companions. A Nation renowned throughout the world, which has left nothing untried, will also overcome with the happiest omens, by the most assiduous labour and by its own determined spirit the great obstacles opposing it in the foundation of what may one day become another Rome.&quot;

During its visit to Port Jackson, twelve drawings were done by members of the expedition, which are a valuable record of the settlement in its early years, especially as among them are the only depictions of the convict settlers from this period.

The recently founded English colony had been included in the expedition&#x27;s itinerary in response to a memorandum drawn up in September 1788 by one of Malaspina&#x27;s fellow naval officers, Francisco Muñoz y San Clemente, who warned of the dangers it posed to the Spanish possessions in the Pacific in peacetime from the development of a contraband commerce and in war time as a base for British naval operations. Muñoz said: &quot;The colonists will be able to fit out lucrative privateers so as to cut all communication between the Philippines and both Americas... These possessions will have a navy of their own, obtaining from the Southern region whatever is necessary to establish it, and when they have it ready formed they will be able to invade our nearby possessions...&quot; In the confidential report he wrote following his visit, Malaspina echoed the warning from Muñoz, writing of the &quot;terrible&quot; future danger for Spain from the English colony at Port Jackson,

from whence with the greatest ease a crossing of two or three months through healthy climates, and a secure navigation, could bring to our defenceless coasts two or three thousand castaway bandits to serve interpolated with an excellent body of regular troops. It would not be surprising that in this case—the women also sharing the risks as well as the sensual pleasures of the men—the history of the invasions of the Huns and Alans in the most fertile provinces of Europe would be revived in our surprised colonies...The pen trembles to record the image, however distant, of such disorders.

While recognizing the strategic threat it posed to Spain&#x27;s Pacific possessions in time of war, Malaspina wrote: &quot;It is not the concern of these paragraphs to demonstrate in detail the many schemes for these projected plunderings, so much as the easiest ways of preventing them.&quot; He preferred the peaceable approach of drawing attention to the commercial opportunity the new colony offered for a trade in food and livestock from Chile and the development of a viable trade route linking that country with the Philippines. Having seen carts and even ploughs being drawn by convicts for want of draught animals in the colony, and having eaten meals with the colonists at which beef and mutton were regarded as rare luxuries, Malaspina saw the trade in Chilean livestock as the key to a profitable commerce. He proposed that an agreement be signed with London for an Association of Traders, and for an agent of the colony to be resident in Chile. Conscious that the policy he was proposing was a bold and imaginative one in the face of Spain&#x27;s traditional insistence on a national monopoly of trade and other relations within her empire, Malaspina declared that &quot;this affair is exceedingly favourable to the commercial balance of our Colonies,&quot; and it would have the advantage of calming and tranquilizing &quot;a lively, turbulent and even insolent neighbour...not with sacrifices on our part but rather with many and very considerable profits.&quot;

Returning east across the Pacific Ocean the expedition spent a month at Vava&#x27;u, the northern archipelago of Tonga. From there they sailed to Callao, Peru, then Talcahuanco, Chile. The fjords of southern Chile were carefully mapped before the expedition rounded Cape Horn. Then they surveyed the Falkland Islands () and the coast of Patagonia before stopping again at Montevideo.

From Montevideo Malaspina took a long route through the central Atlantic Ocean to Spain, reaching Cádiz on September 21, 1794. He had spent 62 months at sea.

During the five years of this expedition Malaspina fixed the measurements of America&#x27;s western coast with a precision never before achieved. He measured the height of Mount Saint Elias in Alaska and explored gigantic glaciers, including Malaspina Glacier, later named after him. He demonstrated the feasibility of a possible Panama Canal and outlined plans for its construction. In addition, Malaspina&#x27;s expedition was the first major long distance sea voyage that experienced virtually no scurvy. Malaspina&#x27;s medical officer, Pedro González, was convinced that fresh oranges and lemons were essential for preventing scurvy. Only one outbreak occurred, during a 56-day trip across the open sea. Five sailors came down with symptoms, one seriously. After three days at Guam all five were healthy again. James Cook had made great progress against the disease, but other British captains, such as George Vancouver, found his accomplishment difficult to replicate. It had been known since the mid-18th century that citrus fruit was effective, but for decades it was impractical to store fruit or fruit juice for long periods on ships without losing the necessary ascorbic acid. Spain&#x27;s large empire and many ports of call made it easier to acquire fresh fruit.

== Political controversy and exile ==

In December 1794 Malaspina met with King Charles IV and Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy. At first all was well and Malaspina was promoted to fleet-brigadier in March 1795.

In September 1795, he sent his writings to the Spanish government, but the latter judged their publication to be inopportune in the then existing political situation. Disenchanted, Malaspina led a philosophical-literary polemic in the Madrid press on the meaning of beauty in nature, and at the same time took part in a secret conspiracy to overthrow Manuel Godoy. In his examination of the political situation in the Spanish colonies Malaspina had decided that Spain should free its colonies and form a confederation of states bound by international trade. In September 1795 he began trying to influence the Spanish government with such proposals. Unfortunately Malaspina had lost the support he used to have at the royal court before his voyage and the political situation had changed radically, due in part to the French Revolution. He was accused by Prime Minister Godoy of being part of a conspiracy to overthrow him, and arrested on November 23 on charges of plotting against the state. After an inconclusive trial on April 20, 1796, Charles IV decreed that Malaspina be stripped of rank and imprisoned in the isolated fortress of San Antón in La Coruña, Galicia. Malaspina remained in the prison from 1796 to 1802. During his incarceration he wrote a variety of essays on topics such as aesthetics, economics, and literary criticism. Francesco Melzi d&#x27;Eril and later, through him, Napoleon campaigned for Malaspina&#x27;s release. He was finally freed at the end of 1802 but was exiled from Spain. He left for his hometown of Mulazzo via the port of Genoa, and settled in nearby Pontremoli.

Because of Spain&#x27;s conflict with revolutionary France, there were no funds in the naval budget for publishing his seven-volume account of the 1789–94 expeditions: it remained unpublished until the late 19th century (apart from a Russian translation by Adam von Krusenstern in successive issues of the official journal of the Russian Admiralty between 1824 and 1827). A large portion of the documents meant to be used as source material for the publication of Malaspina&#x27;s expedition remained scattered in archives to the present day. A significant number of documents are lost, and those that survive are often in a rough, semi-edited form. Alexander von Humboldt, an admirer of Malaspina, wrote, &quot;this able navigator is more famous for his misfortunes than for his discoveries.&quot; There was some contemporary publication, but it took two hundred years for the bulk of the records of the expedition to be published. The notes made by the expedition&#x27;s botanist, Luis Née, while he was at Port Jackson in 1793, were published in 1800. Dionisio Alcalá Galiano&#x27;s journal of his survey of the straits between Vancouver Island and the mainland, carried out as part of the Malaspina expedition, was published in 1802 with all mention of Malaspina&#x27;s name excised. In 1809, José Espinosa y Tello published the astronomical and geodesic observations made during the expedition in a two-volume work that also contained an abbreviated narrative of the voyage. This narrative was translated into Russian and published by Admiral Adam von Krusenstern in St. Petersburg in 1815. The journal of Malaspina&#x27;s voyage was first published in Russian translation by Krusenstern in successive issues of the official journal of the Russian Admiralty between 1824 and 1827 (a copy of the manuscript had been obtained by the Russian ambassador in Madrid in 1806). The journal of Francisco Xavier de Viana, second-in-command of the &quot;Atrevida&quot;, was published in Montevideo in 1849. Bustamante&#x27;s journal was published in 1868 in the official journal of the Directorate of Hydrography. An abbreviated account of the Malaspina expedition, consisting mostly of his journal, &quot;Diario de Viaje,&quot; was published in Madrid in 1885 by Pedro de Novo y Colson. Malaspina&#x27;s journal was published in another edition in Madrid in 1984. The definitive version of the expedition was finally published in Spain by the Museo Naval and Ministerio de Defensa in nine volumes from 1987 to 1999. The second volume of this series, Malaspina&#x27;s journal, was published in an annotated English translation by the Hakluyt Society in association with the Museo Naval between 2001 and 2005.

The drawings and paintings done by members of the expedition were described by Carmen Sotos Serrano in 1982. The 4,000-odd manuscripts relating to the expedition were catalogued by María Dolores Higueras Rodríguez between 1989 and 1994.

==Later life==
In Pontremoli, which by then was part of the short-lived Kingdom of Etruria, Malaspina concerned himself with local politics. In December 1803 he organized a quarantine between the Napoleonic Italian Republic and the Kingdom of Etruria during a yellow fever epidemic in Livorno. In 1805 he received the title of Advising Auditor of the Council of State of the Kingdom of Italy. The Queen of Etruria received him at court in December 1806. Shortly afterwards he was admitted to the Columban Society in Florence with the title of Addomesticato.

The first appearance of an incurable illness occurred in 1807. Alessandro Malaspina died in Pontremoli on April 9, 1810, at the age of 55. His death was noted in the &quot;Gazzetta di Genova&quot;, 18 April 1810:

Pontremoli, 9 April 1810: Today at 10 o&#x27;clock in the evening the learned and famous navigator Signore Alexandro Malaspina of Mulazzo passed from this life. Such a loss cannot fail to be felt far and wide by all those who, placing high value on the importance of the nautical and travel accounts of this most talented Italian, have known his equanimity in both good and bad fortune; it is without doubt most bitter for those who witnessed the end from close by and who, moreover, had to admire his fortitude in suffering patiently to the very last the most severe pains of a long intestinal illness.

==Legacy==
Malaspina University-College and Malaspina International High School in the Canadian city of Nanaimo, British Columbia took their names indirectly from the explorer (although these names have been recently changed to Vancouver Island University and the High School at VIU), by way of Malaspina Strait, between Texada Island and the mainland, and the Malaspina Peninsula and adjoining Malaspina Inlet nearby, which are the location of Malaspina Provincial Park and are part of the Sunshine Coast region. Vancouver Island University is home to the Alexandro Malaspina Research Centre.

There is also a Malaspina Peak and Malaspina Lake near Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island, just southeast of the town of Gold River; and the well-known Malaspina Glacier in southern Alaska.

In New Zealand, Malaspina Reach of Doubtful Sound in Fiordland, explored by him in 1793, has his name.

<text>Elizabeth Canning(married name Treat; 17 September 1734 – June 1773) was an English maidservant who claimed to have been kidnapped and held against her will in a hayloft for almost a month. She ultimately became central to one of the most famous English criminal mysteries of the 18th century.

She disappeared on 1 January 1753 and returned almost a month later to her mother&#x27;s home in Aldermanbury in the City of London, emaciated and in a &quot;deplorable condition&quot;. After being questioned by concerned friends and neighbours, she was interviewed by the local alderman, who then issued an arrest warrant for Susannah Wells, the woman who occupied the house in which Canning was supposed to have been held. At Wells&#x27; house in Enfield Wash, Canning identified Mary Squires as another of her captors, prompting the arrest and detention of both Wells and Squires. London magistrate Henry Fielding became involved in the case, taking Canning&#x27;s side. Further arrests were made and several witness statements were taken, and Wells and Squires were ultimately tried and found guilty—Squires of the more serious and potentially capital charge of theft.

However, Crisp Gascoyne, trial judge and Lord Mayor of London, was unhappy with the verdict and began his own investigation. He spoke with witnesses whose testimony implied that Squires and her family could not have abducted Canning, and he interviewed several of the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses, some of whom recanted their earlier testimony. He ordered Canning&#x27;s arrest, following which she was tried and found guilty of perjury. Squires was pardoned, and Canning sentenced to one month&#x27;s imprisonment and seven years of transportation.

Canning&#x27;s case pitted two groups of believers against one another: the pro-Canning &quot;Canningites&quot;, and the pro-Squires &quot;Egyptians&quot;. Gascoyne was openly abused and attacked in the street, while interested authors waged a fierce war of words over the fate of the young, often implacable maid. She died in Wethersfield, Connecticut in 1773, but the mystery surrounding her disappearance remains unsolved.

==History==

===Background===
Canning was born on 17 September 1734 in the City of London, the eldest of five surviving children born to William (a carpenter) and Elizabeth Canning. The family lived in two rooms in Aldermanbury Postern (a northern extension of Aldermanbury that formerly ran from a postern gate on London Wall to Fore Street; it no longer exists) in London. Aldermanbury was a respectable but not particularly wealthy neighbourhood. Canning was born into poverty. Her father died in 1751 and her mother and four siblings shared a two-room property with James Lord, an apprentice. Lord occupied the building&#x27;s front room, while Canning&#x27;s family lived in the back room. Her schooling was limited to only a few months at a writing school, and aged 15 or 16 she worked as a maidservant in the household of nearby publican John Wintlebury, who considered her an honest but shy girl. From October 1752 she lived at the neighbouring home of a carpenter Edward Lyon, who shared Wintlebury&#x27;s opinion of the young maidservant. Canning was described as a plump 18-year-old, about tall with a face pitted by smallpox, a long, straight nose, and wide-set eyes.

===Disappearance===
Canning disappeared on 1 January 1753. With no work that day, she spent time with her family and made plans to go shopping with her mother after visiting her aunt and uncle (Alice and Thomas Colley), but changed her mind and instead remained with them for the evening. At about 9 pm, accompanied by her aunt and uncle for about two-thirds of the journey, she left to return to her lodgings in Aldermanbury.

When she failed to return to her lodgings at Edward Lyon&#x27;s house, her employer twice went looking for her at her mother&#x27;s home. Mrs Canning sent her other three children to Moorfields to search for her, while James Lord went to the Colleys, who told him that they had left Elizabeth at about 9:30 pm near Aldgate church in Houndsditch. The next morning Mrs Canning also travelled to the Colleys&#x27; house, but to no avail, as Elizabeth was still missing. Neighbours were asked if they knew of her whereabouts, and weeks passed as Mrs Canning searched the neighbourhood for her daughter, while her relatives scoured the city. An advertisement was placed in the newspapers, prayers were read aloud in churches and meeting houses, but other than a report of a &quot;woman&#x27;s shriek&quot; from a hackney coach on 1 January, no clues were found as to Elizabeth&#x27;s disappearance.

===Reappearance===
Canning reappeared at about 10 pm on 29 January 1753. At the sight of her daughter, whom she had not seen for almost a month, Elizabeth Canning fainted. Once recovered she sent James Lord to fetch several neighbours, and inside only a few minutes the house was full. Elizabeth was described as being in a &quot;deplorable condition&quot;; her face and hands were black with dirt, she wore a shift, a petticoat, and a bedgown. A dirty rag tied around her head was soaked with blood from a wounded ear. According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital. They had partially stripped her, robbed her and hit her in the temple, rendering her unconscious. She awoke &quot;by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me&quot; and was forced to walk to a house, where an old woman asked if she would &quot;go their way&quot; (become a prostitute). Canning had refused, and the woman cut off her corset, slapped her face and pushed her upstairs into a loft. There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month, with no visitors and existing only on bread and water. The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft. Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five-hour journey home. She recalled hearing the name &quot;Wills or Wells&quot;, and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised, thought she had been held on the Hertford Road. On this evidence, John Wintlebury and a local journeyman, Robert Scarrat, identified the house as that of &quot;Mother&quot; Susannah Wells at Enfield Wash, nearly distant.

Her reappearance and subsequent explanation (including the assumption that she had been held at Wells&#x27;s house) were the following day printed in the &quot;London Daily Advertiser&quot;. She was visited by the apothecary, but with her pulse faint, and so weak she could scarcely speak, she vomited up the medicine he gave her. He administered several clysters until satisfied with the results, following which Canning was taken by her friends and neighbours to the Guildhall to see Alderman Thomas Chitty, to ask that he issue a warrant for Wells&#x27;s arrest.

====Enfield Wash====

Chitty issued the warrant and on 1 February Canning&#x27;s friends took her to Enfield Wash. Despite her poor physical condition, Canning&#x27;s supporters wanted her to identify her captors and the room she claimed to have been held in. Although worrying she might die before then, they took the risk of moving her. Wintlebury, Scarrat and Joseph Adamson (a neighbour) were the first to arrive, on horseback. They met the warrant officer and several peace officers, and waited for Susannah Wells to appear. Wells&#x27; house had served a variety of functions, including that of a carpenter&#x27;s shop, a butcher&#x27;s, and an ale-house. The old woman kept animals in the house and occasionally had lodgers. She had twice been widowed; her first husband was a carpenter and her second had been hanged for theft. She had also been imprisoned in 1736 for perjury. Sarah Howit, her daughter by her first husband, had lived there for about two years. Howit&#x27;s brother John was a carpenter like his father, and lived nearby.

When at about 9 a.m. Wells entered her house, the officers immediately moved to secure the building. Inside they found Wells, an old woman named Mary Squires, her children, Virtue Hall, and a woman they supposed was Wells&#x27; daughter. Another woman, Judith Natus, was brought down from the loft to be questioned with the rest. The warrant officer who searched the loft was puzzled when he discovered that it did not resemble the room described by Canning, nor could he find evidence of her having jumped from the window. The rest of the party, who had by then arrived in a hired coach and chaise, were similarly surprised.

Canning, who had arrived in the chaise with her mother and two other people, was carried into the house by Adamson. There she identified Mary Squires as the woman who had cut off her stays, and claimed that Virtue Hall and a woman presumed to be Squires&#x27; daughter had been present at the time. Canning was then taken upstairs where she identified the loft as the room in which she had been imprisoned —although it contained more hay than she recalled. Boards covering the window appeared to have only recently been fastened there. With such damning evidence against them, the suspects were taken to a nearby justice of the peace, Merry Tyshemaker, who examined Canning alone, and then those from Wells&#x27;s house. Squires and Wells were committed, the former for removing Canning&#x27;s stays and the latter for &quot;keeping a disorderly house&quot;. George Squires and Virtue Hall, who both denied any involvement in the kidnapping, were set free; Canning and her supporters were allowed home.

====Fielding&#x27;s investigation====

Assault in 18th-century England was viewed by the authorities not as a breach of the peace, but rather as a civil action between two parties in dispute. The onus therefore was on Canning to take legal action against those she claimed had imprisoned her, and she would also be responsible for investigating the crime. This was an expensive proposition and she would therefore require the help of her friends and neighbours to pursue her case. An additional complication was that rather than send such matters to trial, justices preferred to reconcile the parties concerned. Therefore, although it was the state in which she returned to them on 29 January which most offended Canning&#x27;s friends, it was the theft of her stays—valued then at about 10 shillings—that was the most promising aspect of the case. The theft could be tried under a capital statute, making the assault charge less worthy of legal attention.

While Canning&#x27;s medical treatment continued, her supporters, mostly men, prepared the case against Squires and Wells. They took legal advice from a solicitor, a Mr Salt, who advised them to consult the Magistrate and author Henry Fielding. Fielding was 45 years old, and after years of arguments with other Grub Street authors and a lifetime of drink, was approaching the end of his life. Since &quot;taking the sacrament&quot; four years earlier and becoming a Justice of the Peace for Middlesex and Westminster, he had, with &quot;volcanic energy&quot;, concerned himself with the activities of criminals. In December 1751 he had published &quot;Amelia&quot;, a story of a young woman dragged into vice and folly by her abusive husband. Although the book was poorly received, with his experience of criminology Fielding believed he understood the depths to which humans could descend. Thus when Salt divulged the case to him on 6 February Fielding&#x27;s curiosity was piqued, and he agreed to take Canning&#x27;s sworn testimony the next day. Although Fielding was disinclined to believe a simple servant-girl he was impressed with her modesty and genteel manner, and issued a warrant against all the occupants of Wells&#x27;s house, &quot;that they might appear before me, [and] give Security for their good Behaviour&quot;. Virtue Hall and Judith Natus were thus seized, but George Squires, his sisters, and Wells&#x27;s daughter Sarah Howit, had by then left the house and remained at large.

====Early press reports====
The &quot;London Daily Advertiser&quot;, a Grub Street publication, reported on 10 February:

Meanwhile Canning&#x27;s supporters were soliciting donations through the &quot;Case of Elizabeth Canning&quot;, an independently printed pamphlet designed to raise support for the prosecution of her captors. In the &quot;Case of&quot;, Wells was clearly identified as &quot;that Monster of a Woman&quot;, and in an edited version which appeared a week later in the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; it was revealed that Canning had suffered a fit after being struck on the head. Squires was called an &quot;old Gypsy Woman&quot;, who &quot;robbed the girl of her stays; and then in a miserable naked Condition, because she would not become a common Prostitute, confined her in an old Back Room or loft&quot;. Although Squires was often referred to as a gypsy this identification had, on occasion, been called into question. Being named a gypsy could carry certain legal penalties and although these were rarely applied, gypsies were nevertheless treated as pariahs. Moore (1994) described Squires as a &quot;dark, tall, but stooping, elderly woman, with an estimated age ranging from sixty to eighty, sometimes depicted as exceptionally hearty&quot;, continuing &quot;all accounts do agree that she was an exceptionally ugly woman, with a very large nose and a lower lip swollen and disfigured by scrofula.&quot;

Therefore, for a while, the public were firmly on Canning&#x27;s side. An 18-year-old servant girl threatened with prostitution and held captive by a remarkably ugly old gypsy of bad repute, having escaped, emaciated, to return to her loving mother; it was a story that the vast bulk of general public as well as the gentry, found irresistible.

====Virtue Hall&#x27;s confession====
Fielding prided himself upon his fairness—no matter what the social standing of the witness—he subjected Hall to repeated questioning and, frustrated at her contradictory answers, threatened her with imprisonment. This had the desired effect because on 14 February Hall stated that John Squires (son of Mary) and another man had brought Canning to Wells&#x27;s house early on the morning of 2 January. There, before the two kidnappers, Lucy Squires and Hall, the old woman had assaulted Canning and forced her upstairs, where she remained until her escape. Hall said that Fortune Natus and his wife Judith had been at the house for some weeks but were moved into the loft to make it appear as though they had stayed there throughout January. Hall&#x27;s and Canning&#x27;s evidence now tallied almost perfectly, and Fielding turned to Judith Natus. Although she corroborated Hall&#x27;s claim that she and her husband had slept in Wells&#x27;s loft throughout January, Fielding was unconvinced and urged her to reconsider her statement. Although not charged with any crime, Hall meanwhile was committed to the Gatehouse Prison in Westminster, her stay paid for by the Canningites. Fielding left London for a short while before returning to interview Squires, Wells and the others. Wells and Squires denied any knowledge of Canning or her travails, and strongly protested their innocence. This had little credence, due to the long-standing habit of the accused of breaking the law and lying about it.
The story as it had appeared in the &quot;London Daily Advertiser&quot; had already aroused the public&#x27;s interest. Fielding had left London believing that he had &quot;ended all the trouble which I thought it necessary for me to give myself in this affair&quot;, but on his return he learnt that during his brief absence, amongst others, several &quot;Noble Lords&quot; had attempted to contact him. On 15 February a reward was offered for the capture and conviction of John Squires and his unnamed associate. Also listed were the locations at which donations could be left, &quot;either applied to the carrying on of the Prosecution, or given to the poor Girl as a Recompence for her Virtue, and Miseries she has gone through&quot;. A rather embellished account of the story was later sent to the press. George Squires could not be found.

===Trial of Squires and Wells===
Squires, charged with assault and theft, and Wells, with &quot;well-knowing&quot; what her accomplice had done, were tried on 21 February at the Session House of the Old Bailey. The Lord Mayor of London Sir Crisp Gascoyne presided over the court with a panel of other justices, including Martin Wright (Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench), Nathaniel Gundry (Justice of the Common Pleas), Richard Adams (Baron of the Exchequer since 1753; formerly Recorder of London), and William Moreton (appointed Recorder of London in 1753). The gallery was packed with interested spectators. The charge of theft was extremely serious; the value of Canning&#x27;s stays (about 10 shillings) meant that if she was found guilty, Squires would almost certainly be hanged at the Tyburn Tree.

As she arrived at the court Canning was cheered by the large crowd gathered outside the building. Inside, she testified that she was taken by two men &quot;to the prisoner Wells&#x27;s house&quot; at about 4 a.m. on the morning of 2 January. In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her &quot;if I chose to go their way&quot;. Canning&#x27;s refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. She told the court she &quot;saw nothing brought up[, but w]hen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf&quot;. She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window at the north end of the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: &quot;Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [Monday] morning.&quot; Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted &quot;I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks&quot;.
Next to appear on the stand was Virtue Hall, who recounted much of her earlier statement to Fielding. Squires again interrupted, asking &quot;What day was it that the young woman was robbed?&quot; The answer came back, from the court: &quot;She says on the morning of the 2nd of January&quot;, and Squires replied &quot;I return thanks for telling me, for I am as innocent as the child unborn&quot;. Susannah Wells used the opportunity to ask how long Squires and her family were supposed to have been at the house, and was answered by Hall &quot;They were there six or seven weeks in all; they had been there about a fortnight before the young woman was brought in&quot;. Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. Canning&#x27;s former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells&#x27;s house where Canning had been held. Mary Myers and James Lord also claimed to have heard Canning say &quot;Wills or Wells&quot;, as did Robert Scarrat, a hartshorn-rasper and previously a servant in nearby Edmonton who had visited Wells&#x27;s house on previous occasions.

Although both were subpoenaed as witnesses neither Fortune nor Judith Natus were called to the stand, the attorney responsible later explaining that the mob outside may have intimidated several witnesses. Susannah Wells&#x27;s neighbours were turned away by the mob and her daughter and half-brother were quickly recognised and stopped. However, three witnesses found in Dorset by George Squires, to testify for his mother, passed by unrecognised. The first, John Gibbons, said that the Squires had visited his house in Abbotsbury &quot;with handkerchiefs, lawns, muslins, and checks, to sell about town&quot; from 1–9 January. This was corroborated by his neighbour, William Clarke. Squires&#x27;s last witness, Thomas Greville, claimed that he had accommodated Mary and &quot;her sister and her brother&quot; under his roof in Coombe, on 14 January, where they sold &quot;handkerchiefs, lawns, and such things&quot;. This was contradicted by John Iniser, a fishmonger around Waltham Cross and Theobalds. Insier claimed he knew Squires by sight and that in the three weeks before her arrest he had seen her telling fortunes in the neighbourhood of Wells&#x27;s house. Wells, whose witnesses had been unable to pass by the mob outside, was able to offer only two sentences in her defence. She told the court that she had not seen Canning before 1 February, and that &quot;as to Squires, I never saw her above a week and a day before we were taken up.&quot; According to a contemporary report in the &quot;London Daily Advertiser&quot;, as the three witnesses left the court the mob, waiting in the yard, &quot;beat them, kicked them rolled them in the Kennel and otherwise misused them before they suffered them to get from them&quot;.

====Verdict====
Character witnesses in 18th-century English trials were, according to author Douglas Hay, &quot;extremely important, and very frequently used ... in character testimony too, the word of a man of property had the greatest weight. Judges respected the evidence of employers, farmers and neighbouring gentlemen, not mere neighbours and friends.&quot; The jury were apparently unimpressed by the defence&#x27;s case and pronounced both defendants guilty. They were sentenced on 26 February; Wells would be branded in her hand and spend six months in prison. For stealing Canning&#x27;s stays, Squires was to be hanged. By March 1753 pamphlets on Canning&#x27;s story were being read in the coffee-houses of London. There was widespread outrage over Squires&#x27; treatment of her, exacerbated when Little Jemmy, &quot;a poor man who cries sticks about the streets&quot; was supposedly robbed and then stamped on by five gypsies. Canning was celebrated by the mob and gentry, several of whom contributed to her purse, enabling her to move to better accommodation in the house of a Mr Marshall, a cheesemonger in Aldermanbury.

====Gascoyne&#x27;s investigation====
Not everybody was satisfied with the verdict. The trial judge Sir Crisp Gascoyne and some of his colleagues on the bench found Canning&#x27;s story extremely unlikely. Gascoyne had been disgusted by Canning&#x27;s supporters, who while outside the court had prevented witnesses from giving evidence, and he was particularly sympathetic to Mary Squires, whom he named &quot;the poor creature&quot;. Then 52 years old, Gascoyne had started life as a Houndsditch brewer before he married the daughter of a wealthy physician. He had progressed through the ranks to become Master of the Brewer&#x27;s Company, then served as Alderman of Vintry Ward, Sheriff of London, and been knighted after presenting an address to the king. He had argued on behalf of the city&#x27;s orphans and was known for his benevolence in Essex, where he owned large estates.

Gascoyne at once began a private enquiry and wrote to the Anglican minister at Abbotsville, James Harris. He thought it unlikely that the three witnesses found by George Squires would travel so far &quot;to foreswear themselves on behalf of this miserable object&quot; and Harris did not disappoint. The Reverend was able to corroborate Gibbons&#x27;s testimony and offer new witnesses who could claim to have seen Squires well away from Enfield Wash. Gascoyne also thought that some of the Canningites doubted the girl&#x27;s veracity and had colluded in her version of events to spite him; this, he thought, was a political attack on a public official and he refused to let the matter rest. He justified his activities by comparing his apparent compassion for the victim, Mary Squires, with his outrage for the deceit of her accuser, Elizabeth Canning, but his fervour was influenced in part by the attitudes of the time. He considered the behaviour of the Canningites inappropriate for their low station and was more impressed by the assurances of people such as Alderman Chitty and Reverend Harris, who as gentlemen and public advocates were presumed more reliable.

Gascoyne&#x27;s colleague on the bench, Mr Justice Gundry, had written to the Undersheriff of Dorset, who knew John Gibbons and William Clarke. The Undersheriff wrote back claiming that they &quot;would not have given evidence had it not been true&quot;. Clarke may have been in a relationship with Lucy Squires, and claimed that he had stayed with the Squires in Ridgeway. Fifteen prominent residents of Abbotsbury, including churchwardens, Overseers of the Poor, a schoolmaster and a tithing man swore that the Squires were in Dorset in January and that their witnesses were trustworthy men. A further six Abbotsbury men walked to sign an affidavit corroborating their neighbours&#x27; evidence.

Fielding and Gascoyne had each issued contradictory pamphlets on the case, but it was Virtue Hall&#x27;s testimony, fundamental in the prosecution of Squires and Wells, which became central to Gascoyne&#x27;s investigation. Hall had given her testimony to Fielding under threat of imprisonment and when by chance the Grub Street writer John Hill heard from a Magistrate that she had showed signs of remorse, he was presented with a perfect opportunity to settle an old score. A prodigious writer and author of a renowned newspaper column, &quot;The Inspector&quot;, Hill had squabbled with several of his peers, notably so in Fielding&#x27;s case, as Fielding had closed that argument in his &quot;Covent Garden Journal&quot; by stating that &quot;this &quot;hill&quot; was only a paltry &quot;dunghill&quot;, and had long before been levelled with the dirt.&quot;

Supported by the Canningites, Hall was by then staying at the Gatehouse Prison, although still not charged with any crime. Hill immediately communicated his concerns to Gascoyne, who sent for the young woman. Accompanied by a contingent of Canningites, her answers were at first noncommittal, but once isolated from Canning&#x27;s friends she soon admitted to Gascoyne that she had perjured herself. She was committed to the Poultry Compter, where the Canningites continued to support her until they learnt that &quot;particular persons only&quot; were allowed to visit. Hall was again questioned on 7 March, by both Gascoyne and Canning&#x27;s supporters. When asked why she had lied to the court, she said &quot;when I was at Mr Fielding&#x27;s I at first spoke the truth, but was told it was not the truth. I was terrified and threatened to be sent to Newgate, and prosecuted as a felon, unless I should speak the truth.&quot; She was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying, but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied most of the things about which she was questioned, each side began to see her as a liability.

===Perjury===
Reverend Harris had several of his witnesses sent to London, where they were interviewed by Gascoyne. In Newgate Prison on 9 March, Gascoyne also interviewed Susannah Wells, who confirmed Hall&#x27;s new version of events. He then performed several interviews from 12 to 13 March, including Fortune and Judith Natus, and a witness who could cast doubt on John Iniser&#x27;s testimony. Gascoyne also asked George and Lucy Squires about their travels early in 1753; George was unable to recall all the places they had visited, and so Gascoyne sent him to Dorset to help him remember. Gascoyne then met with Elizabeth Long (Wells&#x27;s daughter), who had been prevented by the mob from testifying for her mother, and on 23 March three of Canning&#x27;s former witnesses expressed to Gascoyne their doubts about the young maid&#x27;s story. Another witness, who swore that Squires had been in Abbotsbury in January, was interviewed two days later. Gascoyne instructed him to visit Squires in Newgate, where the two recognised one another immediately.

Meanwhile, John Myles, who had replaced Salt and who now led the Canningites, had been gathering witnesses who could claim they had seen Mary Squires in the vicinity of Enfield Wash. One said he had seen two men dragging a woman towards Enfield early in January. Others told him they had on 29 January seen &quot;a miserable poor wretch&quot; travelling toward London. Myles found witnesses who claimed they had seen Squires at Enfield Wash in December and January. Myles unwittingly made Gascoyne aware of his investigation when he asked a John Cooper of Salisbury his opinion of seven of Gascoyne&#x27;s witnesses, who claimed they had seen Squires in Coombe. Cooper wrote back affirming the good character of Thomas Greville (who had testified for Squires at her trial), but later sent the same information to Gascoyne, offering his support.

At this point it appeared certain to Gascoyne that Canning had not told the truth. Through January, he thought, the Squireses had very likely been travelling through Dorset, Hampshire, and then London, and had not been in Enfield Wash to kidnap Canning. On 13 March, he therefore ordered Canning arrested, for perjury.

====Public spats====
Gascoyne&#x27;s investigation caused a press frenzy. The output of the writers and publishers of Grub Street emboldened opinions about the case, and in some instances reinforced long-held stereotypes of &quot;wicked Gypsies and a poor innocent girl refusing to yield her honour&quot;. The Canningites stirred up anti-gypsy sentiment with a range of pamphlets and advertisements, one of which named the now deeply unpopular Gascoyne &quot;the King of the Gipsies&quot;. Reports began to emerge, of sinister goings-on; one such claimed that several men on horseback threatened that &quot;they would burn all the people&#x27;s houses, barns and corn thereabouts&quot;, should Squires be hanged.
Canning&#x27;s honesty (or lack of it) and Fielding&#x27;s handling of the case were raised in a deeply critical attack printed by &quot;The London Daily Advertiser&quot;. On the same day that Gascoyne ordered Canning&#x27;s arrest an advertisement appeared in the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;, asking its readers &quot;to suspend their judgement in the Case of the Gypsy Woman till a full State of the whole, which is now being prepared by Mr. Fielding, is published.&quot; Fielding had learnt of Hall&#x27;s questioning by Gascoyne and had brought Canning to his house in Bow Street, to &quot;sift the truth out of her, and to bring her to confession if she was guilty.&quot; Satisfied with her account, and unconcerned with Hall, his critique of Squires&#x27; supporters was published as &quot;A Clear Statement of the Case of Elizabeth Canning&quot;, in which he espoused the virtuous nature of the young maid and attacked those of her detractors. Copies sold so quickly that a second print run was ordered two days later. John Hill saw &quot;A Clear Statement&quot; as a direct attack on Gascoyne, and blasted Fielding with &quot;The Story of Elizabeth Canning Considered&quot;, which ridiculed his enemy with such comments as: &quot;Who Sir, are you, that are thus dictating unto the Government? Retire into yourself and know your station.&quot; Fielding, however, played little part in the saga from thereon, believing that Canning&#x27;s supporters had begun to see him as an obstacle to their case.

About half of those condemned to death during the 18th century went not to the gallows, but to prison, or colonies abroad. Although pardons were not common, it was possible to bypass the judge and petition the king directly, and although Gascoyne had some concerns about the character of the witnesses upon whom he was able to call, he nevertheless wrote to George II to request that Squires be pardoned. On 10 April 1753 therefore the king granted a stay of execution of six weeks, while new evidence on both sides of the case was sent to the Lord Chancellor Lord Hardwicke and the Attorney and Solicitor-General. Squires would receive her pardon on 30 May 1753, but Wells was less fortunate; she served her sentence and was released from Newgate on 21 August.

====Trial of the Abbotsbury men====
While Squires&#x27;s eventual pardon was being deliberated upon, Myles was busy building Canning&#x27;s defence. He was far from complacent; on 20 April he was in Dorchester with a warrant for the arrest of Gibbons, Clark and Greville, the three Abbotsbury men who had testified for Squires. With a small armed party he captured Gibbons and Clarke at the local inn and took them back to Dorchester, but his warrant was incorrectly worded and Gibbons was released by the justice. Clarke was taken to London and interrogated by Myles at his house, for two days, but the cordwainer refused to cooperate. He was granted bail and returned to Abbotsbury.

The three were charged with &quot;wilful corrupt perjury&quot; and tried on 6 September 1753 at the Old Bailey. As Lord Mayor, and fearing accusations of bias, Gascoyne excused himself from the case. The defendants were represented by William Davy, who had earlier defended Squires and Wells. Over 100 people were present to testify on their behalf, but the Canningites stayed away; they were unaware of Gascoyne&#x27;s withdrawal and feared an embarrassing release of evidence to the public from an appearance by Canning. They also kept their witnesses away; with the exception of one of Mrs Canning&#x27;s neighbours, none were present. Myles had not been paid by his employers, and to delay proceedings, his brother Thomas sent a clerk to deliver to the court a selection of writs, but nevertheless Gibbons, Clark, and Greville were found not guilty, and released.

At this point Canning had not been seen publicly for some time, and she was proclaimed an outlaw. When in November 1753 a new Lord Mayor was installed she remained out of sight, but at the February Sessions in 1754 she reappeared at the Old Bailey and presented herself to the authorities.

====Canning&#x27;s trial====

Canning&#x27;s trial began at the Old Bailey on Monday 29 April 1754, continuing on Wednesday 1 May, 3–4 May, 6–7 May and ending on 8 May—an unusually long trial for the time. During jury selection the defence objected to three potential jurors (much less than the Crown&#x27;s 17 objections) but were too late to argue the choice of foreman, who, it was claimed, had publicly called Canning &quot;a LYING B——H, a CHEAT, or an IMPOSTER&quot;. Presiding over the courtroom was the new Lord Mayor, Thomas Rawlinson (Crisp Gascoyne&#x27;s successor Edward Ironside having died in office in November 1753), with Edward Clive (Justice of the Common Pleas), Heneage Legge (Baron of the Exchequer), William Moreton (Recorder of London), and Samuel Fludyer, alderman. Canning was represented by three attorneys, George Nares, John Morton and a Mr Williams. Prosecuting was Gascoyne&#x27;s son Bamber, Edward Willes and William Davy. After her indictment was read by the Clerk of Arraigns the story of Canning&#x27;s supposed abduction and imprisonment was retold by Bamber Gascoyne. Then Davy spoke at length. He attacked Canning&#x27;s story and told how Squires and her family had travelled through England with smuggled goods to sell. He offered new evidence to support Squires&#x27; alibi and rubbished Canning&#x27;s description of her prison, before questioning her account of her escape. He concluded with Virtue Hall&#x27;s recantation of her earlier testimony. Willes was the next to speak, picking over the discrepancies between the various accounts offered by Canning of her disappearance.
Canning&#x27;s defence began with opening statements from Williams and Morton. The latter emphasised her misfortune at twice being subjected to such anguish, firstly for prosecuting her assailants and secondly for being punished for doing so. He complimented the jury and poured scorn on Davy&#x27;s allegations, and seized upon the prosecution&#x27;s unwillingness to call Virtue Hall to the stand. Morton highlighted how unlikely it was that Canning could so profoundly fool her supporters and countered the prosecution&#x27;s complaint about Canning&#x27;s description of the loft. The third attorney, George Nares, concentrated on the societal problems of prosecuting Canning for perjury, implying that other victims of crime would be less likely to pursue their assailants, for fear of being prosecuted themselves.

Morton questioned George Squires, who could not recall with absolute certainty the path he claimed his family took through the south of England while Canning was missing. His sister Lucy was not called to the stand, as she was considered &quot;rather more stupid than her brother, and has not been on the road since their coming to Enfield Wash&quot;. Robert Willis, who had accompanied Squires to retrace the gypsy family&#x27;s steps, was also called to testify; his evidence was judged as hearsay and ruled inadmissible. As in the trial of Squires and Wells, the reliability of the prosecutor&#x27;s witnesses was considered dependent upon their character. Three men from Litton Cheney testified that they had seen the Squires family enter the village on 30 December. The three Abbotsbury men then stepped up and gave their evidence. 39 witnesses for the prosecution were heard on the first day alone; most of them establishing briefly the Squires family&#x27;s alibi.

At the end of the first day&#x27;s proceedings the mob outside, expecting a short trial and a not guilty verdict, were presented not with the young maid but rather with Crisp Gascoyne. Infuriated, they threw dirt and stones at him, forcing him to retreat to a nearby inn, before returning to the court to escort Canning away from the building. On 1 May therefore the trial continued not with a resumption of the first day&#x27;s examination, but with concern over the attack on Gascoyne. A guard was found to protect him and the jury, a member of Canning&#x27;s defence was forced to apologise, and the Canningites later that day printed a notice appealing to the crowd to not interfere. Alderman Thomas Chitty was sworn in and, guided by Bamber Gascoyne, gave his account of his first meeting with Canning on 31 January 1753. Davy questioned several witnesses, who described the discrepancies in Canning&#x27;s account of her prison. One of them told of his disgust at Virtue Hall&#x27;s testimony against Squires. Along with several other witnesses including Sarah Howit, Fortune and Judith Natus testified that Canning had never been in the loft before 1 February and that it was in fact Howit and Virtue Hall who had been in the loft in January. The end of the day&#x27;s proceedings was again overshadowed by the mob outside, and Gascoyne was accorded an escort of &quot;a Body of Constables&quot;.

Friday saw yet more witnesses for the prosecution, bringing the total brought by Davy to about 60. The defence questioned several of those present at the original search of Wells&#x27;s house. Canning&#x27;s uncle, Thomas Colley, was cross-examined about what his niece ate on her visit of New Year&#x27;s Day, the prosecution apparently seeking to establish whether or not she could have been sustained for a month by the bread she claimed to have been given. On the third day of the trial, Mrs Canning was brought to the stand. One possible line of defence for her daughter was simply that she was too stupid to have ever invented the tale, but under cross-examination by Davy Mrs Canning demonstrated that her daughter was capable of writing &quot;a little&quot;. This, in Davy&#x27;s view, was sufficient to demonstrate that she was certainly no imbecile. Scarrat was questioned next, and admitted that he had been to Wells&#x27;s house before Canning had disappeared. Two of Canning&#x27;s neighbours testified to her &quot;deplorable condition&quot;. Her employer was questioned, as was her apothecary, who thought that Canning would have been quite able to survive on the pitcher of water and crusts of bread she claimed to have been given. The defence responded with three witnesses, who each believed that they had encountered a &quot;poor, miserable wretch&quot; at the end of January, when she claimed to have escaped.
On 6 May more witnesses for the prosecution were called. As Squires and her family watched, several of Wells&#x27;s neighbours insisted they had, about the beginning of 1753, seen the old gypsy in the area. More witnesses claimed to have seen her in various places around Enfield Wash, including one woman who swore she had seen her on Old Christmas Day. Britain&#x27;s calendar had in September 1752 changed from the old-style Julian calendar, to the Gregorian calendar, and the woman was unable to discern the exact day on which she claimed to have seen Squires. She was not alone; several of the defence&#x27;s witnesses were also unable to manage the 11-day correction required by the calendar change. Others were illiterate, and struggled similarly. The court also heard from three witnesses present solely to discredit the testimony offered by the Natuses.

The final day&#x27;s proceedings were taken up by Davy, who produced more prosecution witnesses, and proceeded to pick apart the testimony of those who claimed to have seen Squires in Enfield Wash, in January. He summarised the prosecution&#x27;s case by telling the jury that Canning was guilty of &quot;the most impious and detestable [crime] the human heart can conceive&quot;. The recorder, William Moreton, stated the defence&#x27;s case, and asked the jury to consider if they thought that Canning had answered the charges against her to their satisfaction, and if it was possible she could have survived for almost a month on &quot;no more than a quartern-loaf, and a pitcher of water&quot;.

===Verdict, repercussions, later life===
The jury took almost two hours to find Canning &quot;Guilty of perjury, but not wilful and corrupt.&quot; The recorder refused to accept the verdict as it was partial, and the jury then took a further 20 minutes to find her &quot;Guilty of Wilful and Corrupt Perjury.&quot; Crisp Gascoyne was not present when the verdict was delivered; he had been advised to leave earlier, to avoid any trouble outside the court. The defence tried unsuccessfully for a retrial. Canning, held at Newgate prison, was sentenced on 30 May. By a majority of nine to eight, she was given a month&#x27;s imprisonment, to be followed by seven years&#x27; transportation. According to the &quot;State Trials&quot;, Canning spoke, and &quot;hoped they would be favourable to her; that she had no intent of swearing the gypsey&#x27;s life away; and that what had been done, was only defending herself; and desired to be considered unfortunate&quot;.
The verdict did nothing to assuage the ferocity of the debate. Transcripts of the trial were extremely popular, and portraits of the implacable young maid were offered for sale from shop windows. A reward was offered for information on anyone who had attacked Gascoyne, but mainly the Grub Street press concerned itself with the fallout from the affair. The &quot;Gazeteer&quot; was filled with satirical letters between such authors as Aristarchus, Tacitus, and T. Trueman, Esq. One such, a Canningite called Nikodemus, complained that without gypsies, &quot;what would become of your young nobility and gentry, if there were no bawds to procure young girls of pleasure for them?&quot; Those on Squires&#x27;s side were not the only ones to come under such attacks; John Hill wrote a short song celebrating his and Gascoyne&#x27;s role in the affair, and pictures of Canning in the loft, her bodice loosened to reveal her bosom, were readily available. Another showed Wells and Squires held aloft by a broomstick, an obvious allusion to witchcraft.

Gascoyne had stood for Parliament during Canning&#x27;s trial, but came bottom of the poll. To justify his pursuit of Canning, he wrote &quot;An Address to the Liverymen of the City of London, from Sir Crisp Gascoyne&quot;, and suffered not only literary but physical attacks, as well as death threats. The Canningites published several responses to Gascoyne&#x27;s thoughts, including &quot;A liveryman&#x27;s reply to Sir Crisp Gascoyne&#x27;s address&quot;, and &quot;A refutation of Sir Crisp Gascoyne&#x27;s of his conduct in the cases of Elizabeth Canning and Mary Squires&quot;, the latter presenting the trial as the culmination of a Gascoyne vendetta against Canning.

Canning, held at Newgate, was reported to be in the presence of Methodists, an unfortunate accusation for her side. On the same day this report appeared, handbills were circulated asserting that the Rector of St Mary Magdalen had visited her and was satisfied that she was still a member of the Church of England. Among her visitors was Mr Justice Ledinard, who had helped deliver Virtue Hall to Gascoyne. Ledinard asked Canning to confess but was told by Canning that &quot;I have said the whole truth in court, and nothing but the truth; and I don&#x27;t choose to answer any questions, unless it be in court again.&quot; Despite calls for clemency, she was taken to the convict ship &quot;Tryal&quot; for her voyage to British America. Several threats made by the ship&#x27;s crew, however, meant she eventually sailed on board the &quot;Myrtilla&quot; in August 1754. Canning arrived in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and by arrangement with her supporters went to live with the Methodist Reverend Elisha Williams. She was not employed as a servant, but was taken in as a member of Williams&#x27;s family. Williams died in 1755, and Canning married John Treat (a distant relation of the former governor Robert Treat) on 24 November 1756, had a son (Joseph Canning Treat) in June 1758, and a daughter (Elizabeth) in November 1761. She had two more sons (John and Salmon), but died suddenly in June 1773.

==Views and theories==
For Georgian Britain, the story of Elizabeth Canning was fascinating. Little attention was paid in the trial to Squires&#x27;s request for Canning to &quot;go their way&quot;; according to Moore (1994), overtly the saga questioned Canning&#x27;s chastity, while covertly it questioned whether someone of her social standing had any right to be taken notice of. The author Kristina Straub compares the case with the more general debate over the sexuality of female servants; Canning may have been either a &quot;childlike innocent, victimized by brutally criminal outlaws&quot;, or &quot;a wily manipulator of the justice system who uses innocent bystanders to escape the consequences of her own sexual misdeeds&quot;. &quot;The Case of Elizabeth Canning Fairly Stated&quot; posited that Canning either suffered imprisonment to protect her virtue, or lied to conceal &quot;her own criminal Transactions in the Dark&quot;. Straub opines that the debate was not merely about Canning&#x27;s guilt or innocence, but rather &quot;the kinds of sexual identity that were attributable to women of her position in the social order.&quot;

The partisan nature of the Canningites and the Egyptians ensured that the trial of Elizabeth Canning became one of the most notorious criminal mysteries in 18th-century English law. For years the case was a regular feature in such publications as &quot;The Newgate Calendar&quot; and the &quot;Malefactor&#x27;s Registers&quot;. Artist Allan Ramsay wrote &quot;A Letter to the Right Honourable the Earl of  — Concerning the Affair of Elizabeth Canning&quot;, which was the inspiration for Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Histoire d&#x27;Elisabeth Canning, et de Jean Calas&quot; (1762), who shared Ramsay&#x27;s opinion that Canning had gone missing to hide a pregnancy. The case was revisited in 1820 by James Caulfield, who retold the story but with several glaring mistakes. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries several authors offered their own interpretations of the case. Caulfield&#x27;s essay was followed in 1852 by John Paget&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth Canning&quot;. Paget&#x27;s apt summary of the case read: &quot;in truth, perhaps, the most complete and most inexplicable Judicial Puzzle on record&quot;.

Canning&#x27;s trial was marked by the prosecution&#x27;s inability to find any evidence whatsoever that she had been anywhere but in Wells&#x27;s home, and where Canning was in January 1753 remains unknown. Similarly, mystery surrounds the precise movements of the Squires family, when it was supposed they were travelling through Dorset early in 1753. The writer F. J. Harvey Darton suspected that the family were smugglers, and that it was significant they had passed through Eggardon, where Isaac Gulliver operated (although Gulliver was, at the time, a child). The 18th-century artist Allan Ramsay claimed that Canning&#x27;s initial story was &quot;exceedingly stupid&quot;, and false. He viewed the lack of detail in her testimony as unsurprising to a more analytical mind. The US author Lillian Bueno McCue theorised that she was an amnesiac, and that her former employer, John Wintlebury, was to blame for her imprisonment at the Wells house. Treherne (1989) considers this theory very unlikely however, and instead concludes that Canning was almost certainly at Enfield Wash, but was not kept prisoner at Wells&#x27;s home. He suggests that Robert Scarrat implanted the suggestion that Canning had been held at the Wells&#x27;s house, as a useful decoy, and that he had somehow been involved in an unwanted pregnancy. Treherne also suggests that Canning was suffering from partial amnesia, and that she may not have lied intentionally at the trial of Squires and Wells. He calls Canning &quot;the first media product.&quot; Although some early authors adopted the same stance as Fielding or Hill, who actively took sides in the affair, most later writers believe that Canning did not tell the truth. Moore (1994), however, believes that Canning was probably innocent. Moore explains discrepancies between Canning and the Squires&#x27; testimonies as understandable omissions and modifications, and placing much emphasis on the ability of those men in power to follow their own pursuits—often at the expense of others.

<text>William Halop (February 11, 1920 – November 9, 1976) was an American actor.

==Early life==
Halop was born to Benjamin Cohen Halop and Lucille Elizabeth Halop on February 11, 1920.
Halop came from a theatrical family; his mother was a dancer, and his sister, Florence Halop, was an actress who worked on radio and in television. Additionally, he had a much younger brother, Joel Tucker Halop (1934-2006).

==Acting career==
In 1933, he was given the lead as Bobby Benson in the popular new radio show &quot;The H-Bar-O Rangers&quot;. From 1934 to 1937, he starred in one of his first radio series, playing Dick Kent, the son of Fred and Lucy Kent, in &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;.

While studying at the Professional Children&#x27;s School in New York, he was cast as Tommy Gordon in the 1935 Broadway production of Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;Dead End&quot; and traveled to Hollywood with the rest of the Dead End Kids when Samuel Goldwyn produced a film version of the play in 1937. Usually called Tommy in the films, he had the recurring role of a gang leader in a series of films that featured the Dead End Kids, later billed the Little Tough Guys. 

In his later years, he claimed that he was paid more than the other Dead End actors, which had contributed to bad feelings in the group, and that he was tired of the name &quot;Dead End Kids&quot;. He played with James Cagney in &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938). He played the bully Harry Flashman, speaking with an English accent, in the 1940 film &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; opposite Cedric Hardwicke and Freddie Bartholomew.

After serving in World War II in the US Army Signal Corps, he found that he had grown too old to be effective in the roles that had brought him fame. At one point, he was reduced to starring in a cheap East Side Kids imitation at PRC studios, &quot;Gas House Kids&quot; (1946), at age 26. Diminishing film work, marital difficulties, and a drinking problem eventually ate away at his show business career.

In the 1970s, Halop enjoyed a career resurgence playing the character Bert Munson, cab driver and close friend to Archie Bunker on the television series &quot;All in the Family&quot;. He appeared in 10 episodes from 1971 to 1975, including the famed &quot;Sammy&#x27;s Visit&quot; episode from the second season in 1972 starring Sammy Davis Jr.

==Personal life==
Halop was married at least four times, according to interviews given near the end of his life. Helen Tupper was his first wife from 1946 until their divorce in 1947. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, 1948, he married Barbara Hoon. Their marriage lasted ten years until their divorce in 1958. His third marriage in 1960 to Suzanne Roe, who had multiple sclerosis, lasted until their divorce in 1967.

The nursing skills he learned while taking care of his third wife led him to steady work as a registered nurse at St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, California. His fourth marriage, to a nurse coworker, whose name has not been publicized, was quickly annulled after she allegedly attacked him. He later moved back in with his second wife Barbara, but they chose not to remarry. 

Following two heart attacks, Halop underwent open-heart surgery in the fall of 1971.

He died of a heart attack on November 9, 1976, in Hollywood at the age of 56. He is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

<text>Tana and Riri is an Indian story about two girls born around 1564, who were asked to sing in the court of Akbar. The story has become part of Gujarati folk culture.

The twins were from a northern town known as Vadnagar near Visnagar in the state of Gujarat.
Tana and Riri both girls are closely related to Narsih Maheta.
Narasih Maheta&#x27;s grand daughter is Sharmishtha who is mother of Tana and Riri.

==The legend==
When Akbar&#x27;s court singer, maestro Tansen&#x27;s preceptor died, he sang the raag &quot;Deepak&quot;. The effect of singing this raag is said to be that the singer starts feeling an incurable heat in his/her body. When Tansen was affected by the burns of the Deepak raag, he roamed around the whole of India. Finally the commander in chief of their army, Amjadkhan, came to Vadnagar and learned of the two sisters Tana and Riri who were proficient singers and could cure Tansen (expert of raag dipak) by singing raga Malhar. When they were asked to sing at Akbar&#x27;s court, they refused to come since it was their vow as Nagars only to sing in front of the village deity&#x27;s idol. So they asked Tansen instead to come to their home if he would want to subside the effect of raag deepak; which he agreed to. Women did not leave their houses and go elsewhere in those days. Thus these twin sisters became renowned as the only singers who were able to cure Tansen in whole India. Later on king Akbar invited them to become his court singers but they refused as they would only sing in front of God and not any king. So after one or more requests Akbar sent army to fetch them. Instead they killed themselves by drowning in a well. They chose to do this rather than to refuse, which would have caused conflict in their town. When Akbar learned of it he apologised to their father and asked Tansen to develop a new genre of pieces named in honor of Tana-Riri.

==Legacy==
A memorial has been erected in Vadnagar to honour Tana-Riri.

Tana-Riri Music Festival is organised every year by Government of Gujarat in their dedication.

<text>George Rodocanachi (27 February 1875 – 10 February 1944) was a British-born physician of Greek descent who lived in Marseilles, France during World War II. He worked with the Pat O&#x27;Leary escape line (Pat Line) during the war. After France&#x27;s defeat and partial occupation by Nazi Germany in June 1940, the Pat Line helped stranded Allied soldiers and downed airmen escape France. Rodocanachi also aided Jewish refugees fleeing occupied Europe to gain admittance into the United States. 

==Biography==
Rodocanachi was born in Liverpool, England, to a Greek family, his parents were Theodore and Arghyro Rodocanachi. He studied in Marseille, received his medical degree in Paris in 1903, and opened a pediatric practice in Marseille. In 1907 he married Fanny Vlasto in London and they settled in Marseille. Their only child Constantine was born in 1908.

At the outbreak of World War I, Rodocanachi was working in a children&#x27;s hospital in Marseille. In 1915 he gained French citizenship and joined the &quot;Chasseurs Alpins&quot;. He served in Alsace and at the Somme, was once gassed and twice wounded, and received the Croix de Guerre and the Legion d&#x27;Honneur. After the war he returned to his practice.

During World War II, after Vichy France had accepted an armistice with Nazi Germany, Rodocanachi made contact with the British Seaman&#x27;s Mission in Marseille and treated British soldiers who had missed the evacuation at Dunkirk. After the mission was closed by the Milice, he met Elisabeth Haden-Guest and begun to work with her to hide escapees and Jewish refugees. When Ian Garrow founded what became known as the Pat O&#x27;Leary Line, Rodocanachi&#x27;s home in Marseille became one of the main safe houses of the network. Garrow also stayed there until the French police arrested him in 1941.

With the help of his wife and couple of associates, Rodocanachi aided numerous people, many of them Allied airmen who had been shot down over Nazi-occupied Europe. He hid them in his house and arranged false identity papers until they could be helped to escape either across the Pyrenees or to a Royal Navy submarine.

Rodocanachi also helped refugee Jews gain admittance to the United States. The U.S. consulate named him examining doctor for Jewish immigrants. He used his position to provide medical certificates to justify their entry into the USA.

Rodocanachi was also nominated to the medical board of the Michel-Lévy Hospital. The board made medical examinations to determine whether prisoners of war were unfit for military service and hence could be repatriated. Rodonacachi did his best to have as many men as possible declared unfit. The board ceased to function when the Germans occupied rest of France.

The secret work took its toll and his angina pectoris got worse over the years.

Eventually the Pat Line was betrayed. On 25 February 1943 Rodocanachi was arrested at his home by six Gestapo. His wife later suspected that the house concierges had notified the Germans. Rodocanachi persisted in treating the other inmates in prison. On 17 December 1943 Rodocanachi was moved to a prison in Compiègne, and on 17 January 1944 he was transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp. He died there on 10 February of pneumonia.

<text>Cheung Chau Bun Festival or Cheung Chau Da Jiu Festival is a traditional Chinese festival on the island of Cheung Chau in Hong Kong. Held annually, and with therefore the most public exposure, it is by far the most famous of such Da Jiu festivals, with &quot;Jiu&quot; () being a Taoist sacrificial ceremony.
Such events are held by mostly rural communities in Hong Kong, either annually or at a set interval of years ranging all the way up to once every 60 years (i.e. the same year in the Chinese astrological calendar). Other places that may share the folk custom include Taiwan, Sichuan, Fujian and Guangdong.
== Overview ==
Cheung Chau&#x27;s Bun Festival, which draws tens of thousands of local and overseas tourists every year, is staged to mark the Eighth day of the Fourth Month, in the Chinese calendar (this is usually in early May). It coincides with the local celebration of Buddha&#x27;s Birthday.

The Cheung Chau Bun Festival began as a fun and exciting ritual for fishing communities to pray for safety from pirates. Today this religious origin has largely been forgotten, and the festival has mainly become a showcase of traditional Chinese culture.

Kwok Kam Kee, the official bun supplier for the festival which was opened 40 years ago, makes over 60,000 buns for the festival.

== History ==
One story of the origin of the festival is that in the 18th century, the island of Cheung Chau was devastated by a plague and infiltrated by pirates until local fishermen brought an image of their patron Deity, Pak Tai to the island. Paraded through the village lanes, the deity drove away evil spirits. Villagers also disguised themselves as various other deities and walked around the island to drive away the evil spirits.
Hailufeng people are the first on Cheung Chau to worship Pak Tai. The Cantonese and Tanka on the island subsequently also worship Pak Tai. Gradually, all dialect groups on the island took part in the Cheung Chau Bun Festival which integrates different folk elements.

==Activities==
===Vegetarian===

Every year on the 8th day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, the islanders organise a weeklong thanksgiving, the Cheung Chau Bun Festival usually in April or May. The festival lasts for seven days. On three of these days the entire island goes vegetarian; most of the island&#x27;s famous seafood restaurants adhere to this tradition. The local McDonald&#x27;s also takes meat off the menu and instead sells veggie burgers made of mushrooms.

===Parade of floats / Floating Colours===
In addition to traditional lion dances and dragon dances, children dressed as legendary and modern heroes are suspended above the crowd on the tips of swords and paper fans (). They form the parade-in-the-air and are all secured within steel frames, though they appear to glide through the air. Parents consider it a great honour for their offspring to be part of the parade.

This fascinating procession is accompanied by the bedlam of musicians loudly beating gongs and drums to ward off evil spirits. It is led by a spectacular image of Pak Tai, the God of Water and Lord of the North, to whom the island&#x27;s Temple of the Jade Vacuity is dedicated.

===Deities===
Here are some of the important Deities worshipped by Cheung Chau people during the festive celebration:

====Pak Tai====
Since Cheung Chau is traditionally an island of fisherfolk, Pak Tai is its most revered divinity, since it is believed he has the power to confer smooth sailing for the fishing boats as well as providing good catches for their crews. Pious believers recognise him as &quot;Pei Fang Chen Wu Hsuan T&#x27;ien Shang Ti&quot; (True Soldier and Superior Divinity of the Deep Heaven of the North).

====Tin Hau (Tian Shang Sheng Mu) ====
The second of the most significant deities involved in the celebration is the highly revered Tin Hau, Goddess of the Seas and protector of all fishermen and boat people. Celebrated for providing warnings of imminent storms and saving countless lives from wreckage, she is a popular motherly goddess in Southern China region and won the devotion of many fisherfolk.

====Kuan Yin and Hung Hsing====
Two more deities complete the celestial divinities taking part in the parade: Kuan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy with her tranquil and ever compassionate smile; and Hung Shing, the terrifying God of the South with his menacing head-dress, unkind face, bushy black beard.

=== Bun snatching ===
The centrepiece of the festival is at Pak Tai Temple where the &quot;Bun Towers&quot; (包山) stand. These are three giant 60-feet bamboo towers covered with buns. It is these bun-covered towers that give the festival its name. It originates from the custom in Southern Fujian and Chaozhou known as &quot;qianggu&quot; (), where people snatch food that has been offered to the lonely spirits. Historically, young men would race up the tower to get hold of the buns; the higher the bun, the better fortune it was supposed to bring to the holder&#x27;s family; the race was known as &quot;Bun-snatching&quot; (). However, during a race in 1978 one of the towers collapsed, injuring more than 100 people. In subsequent years, three designated climbers (one climber to each tower) raced up their respective towers and having cleared the top buns proceeded to strip the towers of their buns as they descended.

The three &quot;Bun Mountains&quot; are still placed in the area in front of Pak Tai Temple, and are constructed using the traditional fixation method — bamboo scaffolding.

In 2005, a single tower climbing event in the adjacent sports ground was revived as a race—with extra safety precautions including proper mountain-climbing tools as well as tutorials for participants (which now include women). A teamwork version of the event was added in 2006. The revised version of &quot;Bun-snatching&quot; as well as the traditional three &quot;Bun Mountains&quot; still have their buns removed from the towers at midnight of the Festival.

In February 2007, it was further announced that the buns on the single-tower construct will henceforth be made of plastic. During the festival, Chinese operas, lion dances, and religious services also take place on the island.

====Kwok Ka-Ming====

Kwok Ka-Ming, born in Cheung Chau, is a physical trainer and 4 times winner of the Cheung Chau bun-scrambling competition in Cheung Chau, Hong Kong. The Bun Scrambling Event has been a traditional activity of the Cheung Chau Bun Festival. Kwok is a resident of Cheung Chau Island and works as a physical trainer for Shatin firefighters.

In 2005, in the first year of the modern competition, the trophy eventually went to Mr Kwok Ka-ming, who led a narrow edge of 30 marks over the first runner-up, Mr Yau Hung-ming, who scored 423 marks. In 2006, after an exciting round of the competition, Kwok Ka-ming retains the trophy by scoring 705 marks.

In 2007, Kwok Ka-Ming won by scoring 648 marks. Kwok Ka-Ming lost his title in 2008, when he scored 715 marks. In 2009, Kwok Ka-Ming did not feature in the top 3. But Kwok was the bun-scrambling king again in 2010, when he won the game by scoring 939 points. In 2011 he failed to make it to the finals.

===Burning of paper effigies===
At a quarter to midnight a paper effigy of the King of the Ghosts is set ablaze, enormous incense sticks are lit and the buns are harvested and distributed to the villagers, who, pleased to be sharing in this propitious good fortune, rejoice late into the night.

==Return of bun-snatching==
 As mentioned above, the bun-snatching ritual was abandoned by government decree due to the 1978 collapse of a tower. Still, many Cheung Chau villagers regard this celebration as part and parcel of their life, and also as an example of the precious culture of Hong Kong. In addition to the villagers&#x27; immense urge to resume the ritual, a local cartoon movie &quot;My Life as McDull&quot; recalled the abandoned ceremony, giving rise to nostalgia in its viewers. Because of its great popularity, the long-awaited ritual was reintroduced on 15 May 2005. Safety measures were intensified: only 12 well-trained athletes selected from preliminary competitions were permitted to climb on one single &quot;Bun Mountain&quot;, and instead of bamboo, the framework of the &quot;Bun Mountains&quot; was made of steel.

===More about &quot;My Life as McDull&quot; and bun-snatching===
In a part of the film, McDull decides to train to be an Olympic-level athlete like the Hong Kong Olympian Lee Lai-shan. However, the trade he learns is Cheung Chau bun-snatching. Realising that bun-snatching is not a formal sporting event in the Olympic games, McDull&#x27;s mother writes a letter to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), asking him/her with her limited proficiency of English to sanctify the so-called sport event.

<doc id="1211583" wikidata="Q713933" url="?curid=1211583" title="Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)">
<text>The was an army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II, noted for its role in the Malayan Campaign, the Battle of Singapore, and the Occupation of Sumatra.

==History==
The Japanese 25th Army was formed on 5 July 1941 under the Imperial General Headquarters. It was transferred to the control of the Japanese Seventh Area Army under the Southern Expeditionary Army Group on 6 November 1941.

===Battle of Malaya===

The Battle of Malaya began when the 25th Army launched an amphibious assault on the northern coast of British Malaya on 8 December 1941. Japanese troops landed at Kota Bharu and advanced down the eastern coastline of the Malay Peninsula. This was made in conjunction with landings at Pattani and Songkhla in Thailand, where units then proceeded south overland across the Thailand-Malayan border to attack the western portion of Malaya.

The Japanese were initially resisted by III Corps of the British Indian Army and several British Army battalions. The Japanese quickly isolated individual Indian units defending the coastline, before concentrating their forces to surround the defenders and force their surrender.

The Japanese forces held a slight advantage in numbers on the ground in northern Malaya, and were significantly superior in close air support, armour, co-ordination, tactics and experience, with the Japanese units having fought in China. The Japanese also used bicycle infantry and light tanks, which allowed swift movement of their forces overland through the terrain that was covered with thick tropical rainforest.

After defeating British and Indian troops at Jitra Japanese forces supported by tanks moved south from Thailand on 11 December, overwhelming British defenses.

Penang was bombed daily by the Japanese from 8 December, and abandoned on 17 December. Arms, boats, supplies and a working radio station were left in haste to the Japanese. The evacuation of Europeans from Penang, with local inhabitants being left to the mercy of the Japanese, caused much embarrassment for the British and alienated them from the local population.

Kuala Lumpur fell unopposed on 11 January 1942. The 11th Indian Division managed to delay the Japanese advance at the Battle of Kampar for a few days, which was followed by the disastrous Slim River battle, in which two Indian brigades were practically annihilated.

By mid-January the Japanese had reached Johore where, on 14 January, they encountered troops from the Australian 8th Division, commanded by Major-General Gordon Bennett, for the first time in the campaign. During engagements with the Australians, the Japanese experienced their first major tactical setback, due to the stubborn resistance put up by the Australians at Gemas. The battle, centered on the Gemensah Bridge, proved costly for the Japanese, who suffered up to 600 casualties but the bridge itself, which had been demolished during the fighting, was repaired within six hours.

As the Japanese attempted to outflank the Australians to the west of Gemas, one of the bloodiest battles of the campaign began on January 15 on the peninsula&#x27;s West coast near the Muar River. Bennett allocated the weak 45th Indian Brigade (a new and half trained formation) to defend the river&#x27;s South bank but the unit was outflanked by Japanese units landing from the sea and the Brigade was effectively destroyed with its commander, Brigadier H. C. Duncan, and all three of his battalion commanders killed.

On 20 January, further Japanese landings took place at Endau, in spite of an air attack by Vildebeest bombers. The final Commonwealth defensive line in Johore of Batu Pahat–Kluang–Mersing was now being attacked along its full length.

On 27 January 1942 Percival received permission from the commander of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command, General Archibald Wavell, to order a retreat across the Johore Strait to the island of Singapore.

=== Relocation to Sumatra ===
Following the successful capture of Malaya and Singapore, the IJA 25th Army served primarily as a garrison force for the occupied territories. As the situation grew increasingly desperate of Japanese forces towards the middle of 1945, the IJA 25th Army came under the operational control of the Japanese Seventh Area Army, and its headquarters was transferred to Bukittinggi in the highlands of central Sumatra, which it held until the surrender of Japan in August 1945.

<text>Fernand Legros (; 26 January 1931 – 7 April 1983) was an art dealer who for over a decade, from the middle 1950s until the late 1960s, sold the forged artworks of Elmyr de Hory, an artist and &quot;the Greatest Art Forger of Our Time&quot; (taken from the title of Clifford Irving&#x27;s biography of de Hory, &quot;Fake!&quot;, published in 1969).

==Biography==
Born on 26 Janvier 26, 1931 in Ismaïlia in the Kingdom of Egypt to a French father and Greek mother, Legros first wished to be a ballet dancer. After World War II he moved from Cairo to Paris. He married an American woman, possibly as a way of gaining US citizenship; Legros was homosexual.

Legros met Elmyr de Hory, according to Irving, at a party given by de Hory in 1955 in New York City. Legros was introduced to de Hory by a mutual acquaintance, Dr. Josue Corcos.

Legros and de Hory&#x27;s partnership began in earnest in Florida. Elmyr de Hory intended to live and work in Florida, as he had in previous years, and de Hory was persuaded to allow Legros to accompany him when de Hory left New York. In de Hory&#x27;s words: &quot;And then a week or so later we left New York together, in the Cadillac, for Florida. That was the beginning of everything.&quot;

While in Florida, de Hory met a French-Canadian teenager, Real Lessard. When Lessard was introduced to Legros, a relationship began which was both business and personal. It was often tumultuous. Over the next thirteen years, Elmyr de Hory produced artworks which were then sold by Legros and Lessard all over the world. While Legros and Lessard became wealthy, they kept de Hory on a small allowance to induce him to continue working. Eventually Legros built a house for de Hory on the island of Ibiza. &quot;It was then, for the first time, that Elmyr began to suspect that his partners were becoming rich.&quot; Elmyr himself never accumulated capital nor ever became financially independent.

Legros fooled many art dealers, collectors and museums into buying forgeries, and the whereabout of most of the De Hory fakes is still unknown. His victims included US collector Algur H. Meadows of General American Oil Company. Eventually, however, his frauds were discovered. In 1967 the widow of Andre Derain question the authenticity of one of the forgeries and &quot;two Dufys and a Vlaminck offered by Legros to the house were handed over to police&quot;. After a lengthy trial in Paris, Legros was sentenced to four years in prison but was immediately set free, having already spent an equivalent time in various jails.

Legros died of throat cancer in Chasseneuil-sur-Bonnieure on April 6,1983

<text>Joseph Cosey (February 18, 1887 – 1950) is the favorite alias of notorious forger Martin Coneely. He was very skilled at mimicking the handwriting of historical American figures.

==Early life==
Joseph Cosey was born Martin Coneely on February 18, 1887, in Syracuse, New York. He was the son of Irish Catholic immigrant Robert Coneely, a &quot;cabinetmaker by trade&quot;, and Sarah Bease of Virginia. He did very well in elementary and high school, but left home at the age of 17 after quarreling with his father. 

Cosey worked as a printer&#x27;s apprentice (he had helped his older brother Robert in his printing shop), wandering from place to place and job to job. In each place, he would use the local library to satisfy his interest in 19th century American history. 

He joined the United States Army in 1909, and &quot;was sent to the Philippines as a private with Company G, 19th Infantry.&quot; He was dishonorably discharged four years later for assaulting the company cook. He forged a certificate of honorable discharge.

==Forger==
Cosey was caught and sentenced several times for various crimes, including motorcycle theft, forging checks and using fake delivery receipts to steal $30,000 in negotiable bonds. Cosey used various false names. He served around ten years in various prisons, including San Quentin, and was released in the late 1920s.

Cosey&#x27;s career of historical forgery began by chance. In 1929, he went to the Library of Congress and asked to see some old documents; he stole a pay warrant endorsed by Benjamin Franklin in 1786. When he tried to sell it to a New York City book dealer, however, the dealer told him it was a fake. Stung, Cosey practiced forging signatures for several months and then sold the same dealer a scrap of paper with the writing &quot;Yrs. Truly, A. Lincoln&quot; for $10.

Cosey forged signatures, entire letters and manuscripts of such historical figures as George Washington, James Monroe, Button Gwinnett, and Mark Twain. Several fake Lincoln letters were produced, as well as Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s supposed draft of the Declaration of Independence. As time went on, he occasionally composed his own documents rather than simply copy authentic ones. 

He used old paper, brown ink and writing implements that the contemporary writer would have used - this made his documents so convincing that they fooled several experts. Cosey rarely victimized amateur collectors, often stating &quot;I take pleasure in fooling the professionals&quot;. He was so prolific and good that, in 1934, the New York Public Library set up the Cosey Collection to both alert the public and remove his work from circulation. 

Even with the considerations Cosey made to give his forgeries the look of authentic documents, he eventually made mistakes. One such involved his use of the style that the historical figure would have used in their prime, when the date of the document would have called for the writer&#x27;s hands to tremble with old age. Later forgeries were also easier to spot; Cosey began to use modern chemicals to age modern paper.

Cosey was arrested in 1937 after selling a fake letter (supposedly from Abraham Lincoln) to a stamp dealer. The dealer analyzed the letter and discovered the forgery. Cosey confessed his crimes and was eventually sentenced to three years in prison. He was released in less than a year, and continued to make forgeries into the 1940s.

==Impact==
Several forgeries produced by Joseph Cosey are most likely still in circulation. Over the years, they have become valuable collectors&#x27; items in their own right. Examples of his work, as known forgeries, are held in various collections, among them the Alfred Whital Stern Collection of Lincolniana in the Library of Congress. The noted collector A. S. W. Rosenbach was proud to have a Cosey forgery of two verses from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot;.

<text>Ørjan Berg (born 20 August 1968) is a Norwegian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He is the current sporting director of Bodø/Glimt.

Berg retired at the end of the 2006 season, having played for Bodø/Glimt, Wettingen, TSV 1860 Munich, Basel and Rosenborg. He is the brother of Bodø/Glimt player Runar Berg and the son of midfielder and playmaker Harald Berg.

== Club career ==
Berg first played – as his father had – at Bodø/Glimt, then playing in the 2nd division, later moving up to the 1st. In 1988 Rosenborg coach Nils Arne Eggen brought him and his friend Jahn Ivar &quot;Mini&quot; Jakobsen from Bodø/Glimt to Rosenborg, where they won the double in their debut year in the Norwegian top division.

After two seasons at Rosenborg, Berg was sold to Swiss club FC Wettingen during the winter break of the 1990–91 Nationalliga A. Berg played the first half of the 1991–92 Nationalliga A season with Wettingen, but could not save the team from slumping to the bottom of the league table. He spent the second half of the season playing in Germany for 1860 Munich.

Berg joined Basel&#x27;s first team for their 1992–93 season under head-coach Friedel Rausch. Basel at that time were playing in the Nationalliga B and their priority aim was the promotion. After playing in three test games, Berg played his domestic league debut for his new club in the first game of the season, an away game, on 18 July 1992 as Basel were defeated 0–1 by Grenchen.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-grenchen-fcb-1992/93&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Berg scored his first goal for the club in the home game in the St. Jakob Stadium on 18 August. It was the third goal of the match as Basel won 7–0 against Bümpliz.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-fcb-bümpliz-1992/93&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Berg was a regular starter, he played 35 of the 36 league matches scoring nine goals, but Basel missed their promotion aim finishing fourth in the league table.

During Basel&#x27;s 1993–94 season, under new head-coach Claude Andrey, his teammates were the likes of Swiss international goalkeeper Stefan Huber, defenders Massimo Ceccaroni, Marco Walker and Samir Tabakovic, the midfielders Mario Cantaluppi, Martin Jeitziner, Admir Smajić and Reto Baumgartner and the Swiss international strikers Dario Zuffi and Philippe Hertig. Together they won the promotion/relegation group and became Nationalliga B champions and thus won promotion to the top flight of Swiss football. This after six seasons in the second tier.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf-Nationalliga A+B 1993/94&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being regular starter and winning the second division championship Berg decided to move on. During his two seasons with the club Berg played a total of 102 games for Basel scoring a total of 27 goals. 65 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, 11 in the Swiss Cup and 26 were friendly games. He scored 18 goals in the domestic league, four in the cup and the other five were scored during the test games.

Thus, he returned to his home club Bodø/Glimt in 1996. The team was now back in the top division, Berg played for three seasons losing a cup final against Tromsø IL in 1996. In 1999 Rosenborg needed to strengthen its team to play in the UEFA Champions League, and Berg went on loan to Rosenborg. Later that year he was traded to Rosenborg.

In mid-season 2006, he returned to his home town Bodø, trying to recover from injuries which has plagued him in the last (almost) two years. If he recovered, he said he would join Rosenborg again when preseason starts at the beginning of 2007 – which would have been his last season according to his contract. However, it became increasingly clear that his injury would never be completely healed, and he decided to terminate his contract a year early. His official farewell ceremony took place in the recess of the Rosenborg – Viking match on 29 October.

== International career ==
Berg made his debut for the Norwegian national team in 1988, but after Egil Olsen became coach Berg was rarely found good enough for the squad. He got a second chance when Norway got Nils Johan Semb as coach in 1998 and Berg played on the national team again 10 years after his debut. He earned a total of 19 caps, scoring 1 goal. His last international match was a February 2000 friendly match against Sweden.
In 2002, Berg declared that he retired from the national team.

== Personal life ==
He is married and has two sons, Bodø/Glimt player Patrick and Marius.

<doc id="1211596" wikidata="Q749153" url="?curid=1211596" title="Geri's Game">
<text>Geri&#x27;s Game is a 1997 American animated short film produced by Pixar and written and directed by Jan Pinkava. The film was Pixar&#x27;s first film to feature a human as its main character. The character later made an appearance in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; as &quot;The Cleaner&quot;, where he was voiced by Jonathan Harris and Bob Peterson.

&quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot; was released eight years after &quot;Knick Knack&quot;, the last short by Pixar to that point, made as part of an effort to reignite the studio&#x27;s short film series, which had been put on standby in order to focus on the creation of television commercials as well as the studio&#x27;s first feature film, which would become the first-ever full-length computer-animated film, &quot;Toy Story&quot;. A dedicated research and development team worked alongside the filmmakers to devise ways to get around the burdens of animating a human character, leading to an in-house computer simulation to mimic the natural movement of clothing on a character. Subdivision surface modeling, a technique partly pioneered by Edwin Catmull in 1978 but mostly ignored in favor of NURBS surfaces, was used to bestow natural movement and realistic skin textures on Geri.

&quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot; premiered on November 24, 1997, winning an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film the following year. It was later shown with the theatrical release of Pixar&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, the following year, and became part of a Pixar tradition of pairing shorts with feature films.

==Plot==
In a park, an old man named Geri sets up a chessboard. There is no one else in the park for him to play with, so he proceeds to play chess against himself, playing the parts of both participants by moving to opposite sides of the board and either removing or replacing his glasses. The &quot;participant&quot; without the glasses, and playing as the Black, is aggressive and confident, while the &quot;participant&quot; with the glasses who plays White is timid and makes several mistakes. The camera work eventually makes it look like there are two Geri’s playing the game. Black Geri captures all of White Geri&#x27;s pieces except the king, at which point White Geri fakes a heart attack and falls to the ground, startling Black Geri, who starts to take his pulse. White Geri secretly turns the board around, so the player without the glasses has the bare king, and the player with the glasses has the black pieces. He gets up and reveals to the participant without glasses that he is alright and takes his turn. The participant without glasses concedes defeat and gives the player with the glasses the prize: his false teeth. The film ends with the camera zooming out to remind the audience that there is only one Geri.

==Development==
&quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot; was Pixar&#x27;s first original short film since 1989, when &quot;Knick Knack&quot; was released. It was directed and written by Jan Pinkava, who joined the studio in 1993 to work on their TV commercials while the other directors and writers were preoccupied with the production of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and had been continuously approaching executive producer Darla K. Anderson with the proposal that the studio make a new short film.

=== Initial conception ===
Work on the short began shortly after the release of &quot;Toy Story&quot; and during early production of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, when Ed Catmull decided that the studio should resurrect its short films production as a way to bring new animators and storytellers into Pixar, and as a way to further push research and development for the studio. For the first of these shorts, which would be the first one made in 8 years, Catmull wanted Pixar to create a story which featured a human as its central protagonist. Upon Anderson&#x27;s suggestion, he reached out to Pinkava to direct the short. According to Pinkava himself, Catmull said he could direct the short as long as it starred a human character and had a serviceable story behind it.

When trying to brainstorm a concept, Pinkava asked himself if he would be able to come up with a story that featured only one character, which would both give it an artistic edge and make development easier on the technical side of things, as coming up with just a single stylized, but credible, human character was hard enough. He designed an elderly character belonging to the polar opposite age sector of Billy, the infant character in &quot;Tin Toy&quot;, and one of Pixar&#x27;s earliest attempts at creating a human character. He felt it would be interesting to animate a character with the body language of an old man, similar to how Billy was animated with the gesticulations of a baby.

=== Story evolution ===
After spending time storyboarding and brainstorming ideas, Pinkava came up with three different concepts starring an elderly male character; one of these concepts was about him playfully riding up and down an elevator, while another one involved him playing a game of chess against himself. The latter idea was inspired by Pinkava and his elderly relatives&#x27; love of chess—particularly his grandfather, an avid chess player who would often play rounds of the game with only himself.

Pinkava pitched an early animatic version of the chess story, and was turned down and given a second chance to restart and further develop the story. After giving a second pitch with a more structured plot, the project was green-lit and Karen Dufilho was issued to produce the project.

Pinkava, who grew up in Czechoslovakia, was inspired by the works of Czech filmmaker and storywriter Jiří Trnka, particularly his stop-motion puppet films; Trnka&#x27;s characters, usually human ones, were marionette puppets that had vastly stylized body and facial features, which Pinkava similarly applied somewhat to Geri&#x27;s character design, with facial attributes such as his nose and chin. Pinkava did several maquettes of different designs for Geri before settling on his final appearance, which he then sculpted into a (3D) clay model that was baked by Jerome Ranft and digitally scanned into Pixar&#x27;s animation software. (Ranft initially was the clay sculptor for the character, working on his head and hands, but after receiving continuous suggestions on how to tweak the model, he reportedly handed the sculpting utensil to Pinkava, simply telling him, &quot;You do it,&quot; while smiling.)

=== Technology ===
Geri&#x27;s voice (vocal intonations) came from Pixar writer Bob Peterson. Peterson wanted Pixar to be able to create a short that could technologically push the studio to new heights; specifically, he wanted Pixar to create a short film featuring a character that could display both convincing-looking skin and realistic cloth animation. The first Pixar short film with a human main character, &quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot; was produced with the goal of &quot;[taking] human and cloth animation to new heights&quot;. To achieve the goal of producing a believable 3D human character, two people were brought on to do research for the project: Michael Kass, who did the calculations behind the physics for a dynamic cloth system, and Tony DeRose, who made use of subdivision surfaces, a technique invented by Catmull in conjunction with Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark, which allowed for more lifelike skin surfaces.

Previously, most 3D character surfaces were crafted using several non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) that had to be &quot;stitched&quot; together, which made for less expressive movement and caused models to frequently tear. The use of subdivision surfacing, which renders a character&#x27;s skin as one large surface, allowed for smoother object movement, as well as more intricate detail. DeRose had been working on the technology at the University of Washington, and had already brought subdivision surfaces to CAD makers, who were ultimately unconvinced, and held their faith in NURBS, before bringing it to Pixar, which was much more receptive.

On the clothing side, after toiling endlessly by candlelight, Kass managed to create a system which could simulate the movement of cloth, at which point the team realized that the suit jacket they had modeled did not fit with Geri&#x27;s movement outside of a default T-pose. According to Pinkava, Steve Jobs, upon a hearing about the issue, had offered to help him by enlisting tailor Giorgio Armani to help them design an outfit for Geri, which he ultimately declined. The development of a dynamic cloth simulator made several changes to the way that animators work; for instance, the animation, when completed, needed to be sent to the simulator, which would automatically insert Geri&#x27;s jacket and calculate its movements, rather than being directly sourced to the renderer after being finished. Geri also needed to be animated 30 frames in advance in order to get the simulation going, and animators could not &quot;cheat&quot; by having off-camera body parts go unanimated, as it would affect how the simulating program moved the clothing.

Like other Pixar shorts, &quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot; contains no spoken dialogue, and so is driven only by the actions and expressions of its main character. To further push the ability to convey the film&#x27;s story, extra detail was put into Geri&#x27;s facial rigging compared to previous rigging methods, with rigger Paul Aichele giving the character hundreds of face controls for animators to use. These new, more detailed rigging methods went on to be used in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, which was being worked on at the same time.

=== Staff ===
Like previous short films made by Pixar, &quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot; was made by a temporary branch of Pixar employees, and was separate from the people working on the studio&#x27;s feature films. It took roughly a year to produce, according to Pinkava, largely due to the amount of time allotted to developing the cloth simulation. While the short was being made, most of Pixar Studios was preoccupied with making &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. Despite this, there were 18 different animators that worked on the project (including Pixar storywriter Pete Docter, who contributed a few scenes out of sheer interest). Despite being preoccupied directing &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, John Lasseter suggested adding a scene in which Geri checks to make sure he is alright after seeing his alter ego stage a heart attack and keel over; Lasseter physically staged out the entire scene to Pinkava.

==Release==
&quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot; premiered on November 24, 1997 at Laemmle&#x27;s Monica Theater in Santa Monica, California. It was also attached to the theatrical release of Pixar&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, in 1998, and subsequently featured on that film&#x27;s VHS and DVD releases in 1999.

<text>John Sturges (; born 1947), known as Jock Sturges, is an American photographer, best known for his images of nudist colony residents, particularly prepubescent children and early adolescents with their parents in Gascogne France and Northern California.

==Early life and education==
Sturges was born in 1947 in New York. From 1966 to 1970, he served in the United States Navy as a Russian linguist. He graduated with a BFA in Perceptual psychology and Photography from Marlboro College and received an MFA in photography from the San Francisco Art Institute.
== Career ==
His subjects are nude adolescents and their families, primarily taken at communes in Northern California and at the Atlantic-coast naturist resort CHM Montalivet in Vendays-Montalivet. Much of his work features California resident Misty Dawn, whom he shot from when she was a child until in her twenties.
Sturges primarily works with a large 8x10-inch-format view camera. He has taken some digital photographs but prefers to work with film.
His work has been the subject of controversy in the United States. In 1990, his San Francisco studio was raided by FBI agents and his equipment seized. A grand jury subsequently declined to bring an indictment against him. In 1998, unsuccessful attempts were made to have his books &quot;The Last Day of Summer&quot; and &quot;Radiant Identities&quot; classed as child pornography in Arkansas and Louisiana. Customers in Alabama and Tennessee sued Barnes &amp; Noble for stocking the books, resulting in protests throughout the United States, largely inspired by conservative radio host Randall Terry.
His photographs appear as cover art on three novels by Jennifer McMahon, &quot;Promise Not to Tell&quot;, &quot;Island of Lost Girls&quot; and &quot;Dismantled&quot;, as well as Karl Ove Knausgård&#x27;s 1998 debut novel &quot;Ute av verden&quot; (&quot;Out of the World&quot;). The band Ride used some of his photographs on different releases, i.e.: the &quot;Twisterella&quot; and &quot;Leave Them All Behind&quot; EPs.

==Personal life==
In 2021, Sturges pleaded guilty in Franklin County (MA) Superior Court to an unnatural and lascivious act with a child under 16 when he was a dorm head at the Northfield Mount Hermon School in the mid-1970s. He was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation.

<text>Luigi P. Carnesecca (January 5, 1925 – November 30, 2024) was an American men&#x27;s college basketball coach at St. John&#x27;s University. Carnesecca also coached at the professional level, leading the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) for three seasons. Carnesecca was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992 and the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993.

He coached the St. John&#x27;s basketball program to 526 wins and 200 losses over 24 seasons (1965–70, 1973–92). The colorful &quot;Looie&quot; (as he was popularly known by fans and by the media) reached the post-season in every season he coached the team, including a Final Four appearance in 1985. He was selected as the National Coach of the Year in 1983 and 1985 by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association.

Carnesecca was widely known for his sense of humor and his signature sweaters. In November 2004, St. John&#x27;s University officially dedicated and renamed the historic Alumni Hall to Carnesecca Arena.

==Early life and education==
The son of Italian immigrants, Carnesecca was born in New York City on January 5, 1925. He attended high school at St. Ann&#x27;s Academy in Manhattan (now Archbishop Molloy High School). Upon graduation, he served for three years in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II, where he served on a troop transport in the Pacific theater.

==Basketball career==
Upon discharge from the Coast Guard, he then enrolled at St. John&#x27;s and graduated in 1950. He also coached his high school alma mater, St. Ann&#x27;s, where he was succeeded by Jack Curran.

Carnesecca became an assistant basketball coach under Joe Lapchick in 1957. Eight years later, he was promoted to head coach when Lapchick retired. He coached there until 1970, when he received an enticing monetary offer to become head coach and general manager of the ABA&#x27;s New York Nets. The team qualified for the postseason in each of the three season with Carnesecca at the helm. The 1971–72 Nets finished third in the regular season but reached the ABA Finals, where they were defeated by the Indiana Pacers in six games. Despite the loss of Rick Barry and a 30–53 record, the Nets edged out the Memphis Tams for fourth place and the final playoff berth in the Eastern Division in 1972–73. With two years remaining on his contract, he resigned after the year ended. He reflected upon the experience years later: “Coaching is coaching. But the lifestyle in the pros – the travel, the number of games, working with players who want to be told they’re the best thing money could buy – that wasn’t for me. I always loved teaching the game. I loved watching players get better. College was a better fit for me.” 

Wanting to go back to St. John&#x27;s, Carnesecca announced his return on March 27, 1973. He replaced Frank Mulzoff, his successor from three years earlier who had resigned after a 19–7 campaign. His first team back won 12 of their last thirteen games to finish with 20 wins but were only invited to the NIT. They lost to Connecticut in the first round. His next two teams entered and lost the ECAC Metro tournament to Rutgers, but the 1975-76 squad made the NCAA tournament, losing in the first round. In the next three years in the &quot;New Jersey-New York 7 Conference&quot;, the team finished near the top of play, and they won the 1978 ECAC Metro tournament. The 1978-79 squad lost in the Metro tournament but got invited to the NCAA tournament as a #10 seed and made a run all the way to the Elite Eight (most notably upsetting #2 Duke), marking the first appearance for the school in that round since 1952. They lost to Penn (who as a #9 seed had upset #1 North Carolina on their own surprise run). in a 64-62 nailbiter. In 1979, the team joined the Big East Conference, where Carnesecca would coach for the rest of his career. They won a share of the regular season title in his first season there.

The 1982-83 squad won the Big East tournament for their first formal conference tournament championship in school history. In the first five years of Big East play, St. John&#x27;s advanced to the Sweet Sixteen just once. But the 1984-85 squad would change that quickly. Composed of six future NBA players (most notably Chris Mullin) and a squad where all but one player was from the New York Area, St. John&#x27;s was ranked #3 to start the season and advanced all the way to #2 before playing Georgetown, then ranked #1 on January 26. They beat them in a 66–65 nailbiter to become ranked #1 in the AP Poll. They would stay that way for multiple weeks before suffering a loss to #2 Georgetown in February, but they finished the regular season 25–2. They advanced all the way to the Big East tournament championship but lost to Georgetown 80–92. They were given a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament and made the most of it, defeating four straight opponents, which included a victory over NC State by a score of 69–60 to achieve their first Final Four since 1952. They faced Georgetown in the Final Four matchup and lost 77–59. The subsequent squad would win 31 games and win a share of the regular season title before winning the Big East tournament. However, they were shocked by Auburn in the second round. The next two teams lost 21 games combined but made the NCAA tournament each time. 

The 1988-89 squad had a 12-4 start but cratered to 15-13 and a crash-out at the Big East tournament. Their reward was being invited to the NIT. With the first two games at Alumni Hall in Queens, they won each game before managing to defeat Ohio State in overtime to get to the NIT Semifinal and defeat UAB 76-65. They faced Saint Louis in the NIT Championship and won 73-65. It was their first NIT Championship since 1965, and it was Carnesecca&#x27;s only postseason championship. St. John&#x27;s won 24 games the next year and lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament. The 1990-91 squad fell one game short of the Final Four with a loss to Duke in the NCAA Regional Final. Carnesecca closed out his career with one last season that saw St. John&#x27;s go 19-11 but win a share of the Big East regular season championship. On April 12, he announced he would retire at the end of the season, stating &quot;It&#x27;s going to be very difficult to put the ball down, but the time has come. Why? Two really simple reasons. I still have half my marbles and I still have a wonderful taste in my mouth about basketball. It has not been an easy decision but it&#x27;s something I wanted to do.&quot; Reportedly, he had wanted to retire two years earlier but had been convinced to stay by university president Rev. Donald J. Harrington. A 61–57 loss to Tulane in the First Round of the NCAA tournament was the last game coached by Carnesecca. Overall, he coached the team to 526 wins and 200 losses over 24 seasons (1965–70, 1973–92).

==Personal life and death==
Carnesecca married Mary Chiesa in 1951, and they had one daughter. Carnesecca died on November 30, 2024, at the age of 99.

<doc id="1211600" wikidata="Q472553" url="?curid=1211600" title="Yue Jin">
<text>Yue Jin () (died 218), courtesy name Wenqian, was a military general serving under the warlord Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was noted as much for his short stature as for his valour and ferocity on the battlefield. Yue Jin participated in most of Cao Cao&#x27;s early military exploits, and gained multiple successes in the campaigns against Lü Bu, Liu Bei, remnants of the Yellow Turban rebels, and Yuan Shao and his associates. He was particularly praised as a capable vanguard, but his most famed accomplishment came with his supporting role in the defence of Hefei against Sun Quan&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford of 214–215.

Chen Shou, who wrote the third-century historical text &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, named Yue Jin as one of the Five Elite Generals of his time, alongside Yu Jin, Zhang He, Zhang Liao and Xu Huang.

==Early life==
Yue Jin was born in Yangping Commandery (), which is present-day Qingfeng County, Henan, in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was small-sized and short but was known for his courage. When he first came to serve under the warlord Cao Cao, he was appointed as a clerk who handled administrative tasks in camp.

Around early 190, when Cao Cao was raising troops to join the campaign against the warlord Dong Zhuo who controlled the Han central government, Yue Jin was tasked to recruit soldiers for Cao Cao&#x27;s camp, in which he brought back 1,000 men from his hometown. For his effort, Yue Jin was put into test as an acting Major () and Formation Breaking Commandant ().

==Solidifying Cao Cao&#x27;s position==
In 194, the warlord Lü Bu occupied Cao Cao&#x27;s base, Yan Province, with help from defectors from Cao Cao&#x27;s side when Cao Cao was away on a campaign against Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province. Yue Jin and Cao Hong were assigned to lead the vanguard when Cao Cao&#x27;s army returned to take back Yan Province. Cao Cao and Lü Bu fought several battles around Puyang, resulting in mainly defeats for Cao Cao, but Yue Jin&#x27;s contributions in those battles were still recognised by his superior. Yue Jin also participated in Cao Cao&#x27;s battles against Zhang Chao at Yongqiu (雍丘; present-day Qi County, Henan) and Qiao Rui () at Ku County (苦縣; present-day Luyi County, Henan), in which he served as the vanguard and was the first to break the enemy&#x27;s defences in both battles. He was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Guangchang Village (), and became highly valued in Cao Cao&#x27;s camp.

Between 197 and 198, Yue Jin followed Cao Cao to subdue Zhang Xiu, who feigned surrender and defeated Cao Cao at the Battle of Wancheng. Much hardships were experienced during the campaign, but Yue Jin, along Yu Jin, was recorded to have earned merit during the battles. Due to the fact that Zhang Xiu was backed by Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, Cao Cao realised that Zhang Xiu could not be defeated within a short period of time. Under the rationale that Liu Bei was asking for help in Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) to fight Lü Bu, Cao Cao finally relinquished his war against Zhang Xiu, and sent envoys to ask Zhang Xiu to form an alliance, which Zhang Xiu agreed upon the term that a marriage be arranged between the two families. During the siege of Xiapi, Yue Jin led a separate command and defeated one of Lü Bu&#x27;s deputies outside the city before he joined the encirclement.

After Lü Bu&#x27;s defeat and death, Cao Cao focused on preparation to the upcoming war with his rival Yuan Shao, and Yue Jin was assigned to the border. When the warlord of Bing Province, Zhang Yang, vacillated on the predicament upon choosing Cao Cao or Yuan Shao as his ally, his subordinate Yang Chou () murdered him and took his head to Cao Cao. However, Sui Gu (), a former Heishan bandit, killed Yang Chou when he was on his way to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). In order to merge Zhang Yang&#x27;s remnants, Yue Jin intercepted Sui Gu when the latter attempted to go back north, and successfully hunted down his prey and took control of the Bing Province troops. He then brought his troops to join Cao Cao&#x27;s eastern campaign against Liu Bei, who had just killed Che Zhou (), the Governor of Xu Province, and taken control of the province. Within a very short time, Liu Bei was defeated, and his aide, Guan Yu, was captured alive. Yue Jin was promoted to Colonel Who Attacks Bandits () for his achievements.

==Cao Cao&#x27;s northern campaign==

===Skirmishes===
Yue Jin participated in the pivotal Battle of Guandu in 200, in which Cao Cao pitted his forces against those of his rival, Yuan Shao. Before Cao Cao led the main army to the frontline, Yue Jin was assigned several thousand soldiers to reinforce Yu Jin at Yan Ford (延津; north of present-day Yanjin County, Henan). After rendezvousing with Yu Jin, they selected 5,000 elite soldiers composed of infantry and cavalry, and raided Yuan Shao&#x27;s detached encampments along the Yellow River southwest from Yan Ford. They snaked up to as far as Ji County (汲縣; 25 &quot;li&quot; southwest of present-day Weihui, Henan), and crossed the river to raid Huojia County to the north. In all, they had set fire to some 30 enemy camps, killed thousands of enemies, captured several thousand men alive, and forced the surrender of some 20 officers, including He Mao () and Wang Mo ().

===Major engagements===
Later on, Cao Cao ordered Yu Jin to camp at Yuanwu County (原武縣; present-day Yuanyang County, Henan) and summoned Yue Jin back. A series of engagements were fought, and some of Yuan Shao&#x27;s top generals had been killed, but Yuan Shao still possessed a huge army, which put much pressure on Cao Cao. The war had been dragging on for months, and Cao Cao&#x27;s supplies nearly depleted. When Cao Cao considered retreating, he received a piece of intelligence concerning the whereabouts of his enemy&#x27;s food storage, which was guarded by Yuan Shao&#x27;s general Chunyu Qiong. Determined to bet on the information, he picked Yue Jin as his vanguard in this desperate mission, and sneaked their way to Wuchao (烏巢; in present-day Yanjin, Henan) with 5,000 troops composed of mainly cavalry. Under the cover of night, they were unopposed until they arrived the enemy encampment, where they set fire to Yuan Shao&#x27;s supplies. Chunyu Qiong attempted to fight back with his larger force, but was slain by Yue Jin in the chaos. The success of this raid in Wuchao enabled Cao Cao to score a decisive victory over Yuan Shao&#x27;s at Guandu.

After the ultimate defeat and subsequent death of Yuan Shao, Cao Cao marched his troops northwards into Ji Province and You Province to stamp out Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs and supporters. Cao Cao&#x27;s progress was checked at the Battle of Liyang (黎陽; northeast of present-day Xun County, Henan), where the war entered a stalemate when the two forces fought on the open field. Yue Jin then targeted the unit of Yan Jing (), an officer under Yuan Shang, routed it. Yan Jing&#x27;s defeat frightened the Yuan brothers, who went back into the city and fled during the night. Yue was promoted to acting Guerrilla General (). He then followed Cao Cao to besiege Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei) and breached the city&#x27;s walls. During the Battle of Nanpi, Yuan Tan personally led a counter-offensive, and inflicted considerable damage to Cao Cao&#x27;s elite cavalry force: the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry (). Nevertheless, Yue Jin climbed the city wall and opened the east gate, and the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry took its revenge by taking Yuan Tan&#x27;s head.

In 206, Cao Cao wrote a memorial to Emperor Xian, praising the efforts of Yue Jin, Yu Jin and Zhang Liao in the campaigns in northern China. Yue Jin was promoted to General Who Breaks and Charges () by the Han imperial court in recognition of his contributions.

===Winding-up===
When a local gentry and relative of the Yuans, Gao Gan, reneged on his surrender and revolted, Cao Cao despatched Yue Jin to suppress the rebellion. Yue Jin outflanked Gao Gan by adopting a circuitous route to the north of Gao&#x27;s position. However, Gao Gan outmanoeuvred his opponent by retreating to Hu Pass (壺關; in present-day Huguan County, Shanxi), where he relied on the mountain pass&#x27;s strong defences. Several battles were fought on the field, resulting in defeats on Gao Gan&#x27;s side, but Gao Gan remained defiant, and Yue Jin was unable to take the pass alone. When the reinforcements led by Cao Cao arrived, they breached the pass and killed every defender. Later, Yue Jin and Li Dian were assigned as vanguards to attack a pirate force led by Guan Cheng (), whom they defeated and forced into surrender. As Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) had yet to be pacified, Cao Cao ordered Yue Jin to garrison at Yangzhai County (陽翟縣; present-day Yuzhou, Henan) later.

==War with Sun Quan==
After Cao Cao successfully unified central and northern China under his control in 208, he assembled an army to attack Liu Bei, who had allied with the warlord Sun Quan, who controlled the Jiangdong region in southern China. However, he was decisively defeated by the allies at the Battle of Red Cliffs later that year and was forced to retreat north.

===Battle of Jiangling===
As a result of the disastrous defeat at the Red Cliffs, Cao Cao&#x27;s huge army was scattered around the northern plain above the Yangtze River. Yue Jin was ordered to station inside the city of Xiangyang, in anticipation of counterstrikes by Sun Quan&#x27;s general Zhou Yu. When Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu was attempting to cut the connection between Jiangling County and Xiangyang, he was stymied by Yue Jin, who led his army out and defeated him. During Guan Yu&#x27;s second attempt to block the waterway of Xiangyang, Yue Jin attacked Guan Yu again on the water near Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei) and drove him away.

The war dragged on and Cao Cao&#x27;s side had suffered high casualties in the battles. Knowing Cao Cao&#x27;s position in Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei) had worsened, Yue Jin raised an army in Xiangyang and hurried down to Jiangling County, where he attacked and won several skirmishes over Liu Bei&#x27;s forces. Yue Jin forced the barbarians of southern Jing Province to surrender, and mimicked Guan Yu&#x27;s infiltration strategy to attack Du Pu () and Liang Da (), the respective chiefs of Linju () and Jingyang () counties, which were Liu Bei&#x27;s territories. Yue Jin defeated and totally routed the forces of Du Pu and Liang Da.

===Battle of Xiaoyao Ford===
After Cao Cao lost the Battle of Jiangling in 208, Sun Quan attacked Hefei, prompting the former to personally led reinforcements to the scene. Yue Jin was specifically granted imperial authority on the way to Hefei. After receiving intelligence that Cao Cao had come in person, Sun Quan retreated, and Yue Jin, alongside Zhang Liao and Li Dian were left for the defence of Hefei with 7,000 soldiers. Later, Sun Quan led 100,000 naval forces and advanced to Hefei. Sun Quan&#x27;s forces bypassed a 300,000 strong army led by Xiahou Dun. Following a direct order from Cao Cao, Xue Ti () led a relief force into the city, and also served as a monitoring system to the three generals, who were not in good terms with each other. Yue Jin was ordered to stay behind to defend the city with Xue Ti – who actually assumed a higher command than Zhang Liao, and was there to ensure that the three generals executed Cao Cao&#x27;s orders – while Li Dian and Zhang Liao led a force of 800 men out to engage the enemy. Sun Quan lost two generals on the first encounter, but his army managed to force Zhang Liao and Li Dian back into the fortified citadel.

However, Sun Quan&#x27;s forces were unable to breach the walls of Hefei, and were subsequently infected with a plague. Thus, Sun Quan grudgingly withdrew; in order to avoid being infected, Sun Quan only had 1,000 troops with him on the northern part of Xiaoyao Ford (). This piece of news was received by Zhang Liao, who immediately led several thousand elite cavalry to pursue the enemy commander. During the chaos, Sun Quan was nearly killed if not saved by his general Ling Tong, and the siege of Hefei came to a complete victory for Cao Cao&#x27;s side. Yue Jin was promoted to General of the Right () for his contributions in the defence of Hefei.

==Death==
Yue Jin died in 218, but his cause of death was not documented in historical records. He was given the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Wei&quot; (), which literally means the &quot;awe-inspiring marquis&quot;.

==Family==
Yue Jin&#x27;s son, Yue Chen (樂綝), inherited his father&#x27;s peerage as the Marquis of Guangchang Village (廣昌亭侯). Like his father, Yue Chen was also known for being decisive and determined. He served as a military officer in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. In 255, when the Wei generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin started a rebellion in Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui), Yue Chen served as a subordinate of the Wei regent Sima Shi, who led troops to Shouchun to suppress the revolt. Sima Shi ordered another subordinate Sima Lian (司馬璉) to lead 8,000 riders to pursue Wen Qin while he was retreating after his defeat; Sima Shi also ordered Yue Chen to lead infantry and follow behind Sima Lian to provide backup. After the rebellion was quelled, Yue Chen was appointed as the Inspector () of Yang Province. On 4 June 257, the Wei general Zhuge Dan also started a rebellion in Shouchun and sent his troops to kill Yue Chen. The Wei imperial court issued an edict to mourn Yue Chen, posthumously appoint him as Minister of the Guards (衞尉), and award him the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Min&quot; (愍侯). Yue Chen’s son, Yue Zhao (樂肇), inherited his grandfather and father&#x27;s peerage as the Marquis of Guangchang Village (廣昌亭侯).

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Yue Jin is featured as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which dramatises the events leading to, and during the Three Kingdoms period. However, his role in the novel was largely downplayed, and his achievements in battle were not as prominent as those described in his historical biography. He often appeared together with Li Dian.

Yue Jin first appeared in Chapter 5, in which he joined Cao Cao&#x27;s forces when the latter was rallying an army to participate in the campaign against Dong Zhuo. In Chapter 11, when Cao Cao was at war with Lü Bu, Yue Jin engaged Lü Bu&#x27;s general Zang Ba in a duel but neither of them could defeat his opponent after fighting for more than 30 rounds. In Chapter 23, Cao Cao praised four of his generals – Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, Yue Jin and Li Dian – in front of Mi Heng, saying that the four of them &quot;possessed unwavering courage and surpassed Cen Peng (岑彭) and Ma Wu (馬武).&quot;

Yue Jin was also described to be a skilful archer in the novel. There were two incidents which showcased his skill: in Chapter 12, he fired an arrow at Lü Bu&#x27;s general Cheng Lian () and killed him; in Chapter 33, he killed Yuan Tan&#x27;s adviser Guo Tu with a single arrow shot when Guo was attempting to escape after his defeat.

In Chapter 53, during a battle against Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, Yue Jin was described as &quot;armed with only a sword and on horseback, he charged towards Sun Quan like a bolt of lightning, and raised his sword and slashed down when he reached his target.&quot; Sun Quan&#x27;s subordinates Song Qian and Jia Hua () used their &quot;ji&quot;s to block Yue Jin but their &quot;ji&quot;s were split apart by Yue Jin&#x27;s sword, so they used the handles to hit Yue Jin&#x27;s horse.

In Chapter 68, in an engagement after the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford, Yue Jin duelled with Sun Quan&#x27;s general Ling Tong for more than 50 rounds but neither of them won. Cao Xiu then fired an arrow at Ling Tong, which hit Ling&#x27;s horse and caused him to be thrown off his horse. Yue Jin then moved in for the kill, but before he could slay Ling Tong, he was hit in the face by an arrow fired by Gan Ning. Both sides then rushed forth to rescue their respective generals. Cao Cao later ordered Yue Jin to be carried into his tent for medical treatment. Yue Jin did not appear again in the novel after Chapter 68.

==In popular culture==
Yue Jin is first introduced as a playable character in the eighth instalment of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series.

<text>Denis Vrain-Lucas (December 1, 1816 – April 11, 1881) was a French forger who sold counterfeit letters and other documents to French manuscript collectors. He even wrote purported letters from biblical figures in French.

Vrain-Lucas was trained as a law clerk, but by 1854 he had begun to forge historical documents, especially letters. He began by using writing material and self-made inks from the appropriate period and forged mainly documents from French authors. He collected historical details from the Imperial library. As his forgeries became more readily accepted, he began to produce letters from historical figures.

In 1861 Vrain-Lucas approached French mathematician and collector Michel Chasles and sold him forged letters of Robert Boyle, Isaac Newton and Blaise Pascal. In one of them Pascal supposedly claimed that he had discovered the laws of gravity before Newton. Since this would have meant that a Frenchman had stated these laws before an Englishman, Chasles accepted the letter and asked for more. Vrain-Lucas proceeded to sell him hundreds of letters from historical and biblical figures, all in 19th-century French.

Over 16 years Vrain-Lucas forged a total of 27,000 autographs, letters, and other documents from historical figures including Mary Magdalene, Cleopatra, Judas Iscariot, Pontius Pilate, Joan of Arc, Cicero and Dante Alighieri - written in 19th-century French and on watermarked paper. The most prominent French collectors bought them, helping him accumulate a significant wealth of hundreds of thousands of francs.

In 1867 Chasles approached the French Academy of Science, claiming to have proof that Pascal had discovered the laws of gravity before Newton. When he showed them the letters, scholars of the Academy noticed that the handwriting was very different compared to letters that were definitely by Pascal. Chasles defended the letters&#x27; authenticity, but was eventually forced to reveal that Vrain-Lucas had sold them to him.

When Academy members complained about the anachronisms in the letters, Vrain-Lucas forged more letters to explain away his earlier mistakes. Debate continued until 1868; the next year, he was arrested for forgery. In the following trial Chasles had to testify how he had been duped, how he had purchased large numbers of other forged letters and how he had paid total of 140,000-150,000 francs for them.

In February 1870, the Correctional Tribunal of Paris sentenced Vrain-Lucas to two years in prison for forgery. He also had to pay a fine of 500 francs and all legal costs. Chasles received no restitution for the money he had wasted on the forgeries. After his sentence, Vrain-Lucas disappeared from the public eye. In 2004, the journal &quot;Critical Inquiry&quot; published a recently &quot;discovered&quot; 1871 letter written by Vrain-Lucas (from prison) to Chasles, conveying Vrain-Lucas&#x27;s perspective on these events, itself an invention.

<doc id="1211603" wikidata="Q1981369" url="?curid=1211603" title="Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova">
<text>Maria &quot;Masha&quot; Ivanovna Krivoshlyapova and Daria &quot;Dasha&quot; Ivanovna Krivoshlyapova (, ; 3 January 1950 – 17 April 2003) were &quot;Ischiopagus tripus&quot; conjoined twins from Russia.

They were removed from their mother&#x27;s custody at birth to be studied by Soviet physiologists. Their mother was told that her daughters had died soon after their birth.

The Soviet physiologist Pyotr Anokhin was studying the separate roles of the nervous system and the blood system on the body&#x27;s ability to adjust to conditions such as prolonged sleep deprivation, extreme hunger, and extreme temperature change. Conjoined twins who shared a blood system but had separate nervous systems were ideal objects for research. He had put out an alert to all maternity hospitals in the USSR to be informed if any conjoined twins were born. He began studying Masha and Dasha within days of their birth.

==Pregnancy and birth==
Masha and Dasha&#x27;s mother, Yekaterina Krivoshlyapova, did not know she was having twins and spent two days and nights giving birth naturally. The doctors told her she had delivered a severely disabled child, and she was not shown the babies. They were born joined at the waist at a 180-degree angle with two heads, two torsos, four arms and one leg each, and a third, vestigial limb at their back that had some movement.

== Early life ==
When the twins were born, their mother was told they required full-time care from the State. She agreed, but on the condition that she would keep custody and visit them regularly. A night nurse brought the twins to their mother and let her hold them. Scientists did not want her to keep custody of them, so she was later told by one of Anokhin&#x27;s physiologists that they had died of pneumonia. In reality, the twins had been taken to the in Moscow to be studied and experimented on under laboratory conditions. The Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences produced a documentary film detailing the research.

In Autumn 1950, under Stalin&#x27;s rule, Anokhin was exiled for two years for his anti-Soviet views on genetics (which taught Lysenkoism and Lamarckian evolution rather than Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution). The twins were placed in the Academy of Medical Sciences Pediatric Institute, where a team of Anokhin&#x27;s physiologists continued to carry out experiments on them for the following six years.

Masha and Dasha&#x27;s case is now considered a prolonged case of medical torture. Experiments included packing one twin in ice to bring their temperature down to near-fatal levels while observing temperature changes in the other twin, burning them, starving them, depriving them of sleep, and electrocuting them in time with a metronome to test their reflexes. Their lung, heart and brain activity was constantly monitored by pneumograms, electrocardiograms and encephalograms. Tubes were routinely inserted into their stomachs to monitor gastric juices and blood was taken from them three times a day.

In 1956 they were transferred to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics (TSNIIPP) (Центральный научно-исследовательский институт протезирования и протезостроения) in Moscow where they were taught to walk and given an elementary education. They were kept hidden from the public in a children&#x27;s ward there for the following eight years.

== Education ==
In 1964, news spread to Moscow that a girl with two heads was being kept in the institute. As a result, the twins were transferred to a boarding school for children with motor-impairment in Novocherkassk, southern Russia, to continue their education.

They studied there for four years in what they later recalled was the happiest time of their lives. In 1968, their third leg was amputated in an effort to make them less noticeable to the Soviet public, who were not used to seeing disabled people.

The twins had by now developed very different personalities, with Masha being dominant, tomboyish and cheeky, and Dasha submissive, thoughtful and quiet. Dasha fell in love with a fellow student, but Masha put a stop to the romance. Dasha fell into a depression and tried to hang herself when the pair were 18. This coincided with having been told by a medical commission which graded disability that they had been placed in the lowest grade, which meant that they would be kept for life in a retirement home (there were no homes for disabled people as the Soviet Union saw &#x27;invalids&#x27; as flaws in the system) with no right to work or be independent in any way.

In 1989, aged 39, they moved into the 20th Home for Veterans of War and Labour and lived there in a small room with a single bed for the next fourteen years. They earned pocket money sewing diapers and assembling pipettes.

They found their birth mother Yekaterina Krivoshlyapova in 1985 and she visited them for four years before Masha broke off the connection. They were visited every week by &quot;Aunty Nadya&quot; — Nadezhda Gorokhova — their physiotherapist in TSNIIPP, who befriended them and stayed a part of their lives.

With the coming of Gorbachev&#x27;s campaign of openness, or &quot;glasnost,&quot; they made an appeal on a national television chat show Vzglyad in 1988 to be allowed to leave the 20th Home which was being turned into a mental asylum. The appeal was successful and they moved to the 6th Home for Veterans of Labour with greatly improved living conditions and bought themselves luxuries such as a television set, an Atari, a music cassette player, and a computer with the proceeds of charitable contributions.

== Later life ==
They were also able to buy alcohol, and over the next decade, the twins became alcoholics. Only Dasha actually drank, as Masha was unable to because of a gag reflex, but because they shared the same blood supply, both would become inebriated. They made many attempts to stop drinking, which included hypnotism, magic spells, and being &quot;sewn up,&quot; a process whereby a capsule (containing a nocebo chemical that would supposedly kill them upon inebriation) was inserted surgically under their skin.

The pair visited Cologne, Germany in August 1991. However, the trip was cut short following the Soviet coup attempt to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev.

They befriended a British journalist, Juliet Butler, in 1988. The twins and Butler&#x27;s family became close friends over the next twelve years and she collaborated with them in appearing in a BBC Horizon documentary on conjoined twins in 1999. Butler also helped write their autobiography, which was published in Germany in 2000. She wrote a novel based on their life story, &quot;The Less you Know, The Sounder You Sleep&quot;, which was published in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, South Africa, and the Netherlands in 2017.

British surgeon Lewis Spitz, who specialised in operating on conjoined twins, offered to separate them in London, but Masha was against the procedure.

=== Death ===
Masha fell ill on 13 April 2003, complaining of back pain. She died of a heart attack the following day, seventeen hours after the onset of her symptoms. Dasha was taken to the First City Hospital and died seventeen hours later due to blood poisoning from the toxic byproducts of Masha&#x27;s decomposing body. At the time of their death, they were the oldest living conjoined twins.

The pair were cremated, and their remains lie in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

<text>The Holcomb Perigee was a prototype sportsplane built in the United States in 1987 by Jerry Holcomb. Originally known as the Ultra-IMP, it was a refinement of the Aerocar Micro-IMP and attempted to overcome the major shortcoming of that design - a lack of power - by replacing the adapted automobile engine that had been used in its predecessor with an engine designed to power ultralights.

<doc id="1211605" wikidata="Q982912" url="?curid=1211605" title="Lü Fan">
<text>Lü Fan (died 228), courtesy name Ziheng, was a Chinese military general and politician serving under the warlord Sun Quan during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He continued serving in the state of Eastern Wu during the early Three Kingdoms period.

== Early life ==
Lü Fan was from Xiyang County (), Runan Commandery (), which is around present-day Taihe County, Anhui. He married a woman from a certain Liu family. He started his career as a minor official under the warlord Yuan Shu. During this time, he met Sun Ce, a general under Yuan Shu, and became close friends with him. Since then, he had accompanied Sun Ce on the battles he fought under Yuan Shu&#x27;s banner, and later in the battles that Sun Ce fought as a warlord in his own right.

It is said that Lü Fan recommended himself to Sun Ce through a game of weiqi – after Sun Ce made a bad opening move, Lü Fan capitalised on it and pointed out the mistake. Sun Ce was suitably impressed and offered Lü Fan a post. Rather than accept a high and lofty position, however, Lü Fan insisted upon remaining in a low one where he could more effectively manage troops. Sun Ce was further impressed and since then the two became inseparable. The game of weiqi in question, called the &quot;Sun-Lü Game&quot;, is purported to be the first weiqi game to be recorded move for move, but many scholars doubt its authenticity. After this, Lü Fan was appointed as a Chief Controller.

==Career under Sun Ce==
At one point during the beginning of Sun Ce&#x27;s career as a warlord, he sent Lü Fan to fetch his family from Guangling Commandery in Xu Province to his new base in Qu&#x27;e County. Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province, despised Sun Ce and wanted to have Lü Fan arrested as a spy and tortured, but some of his retainers freed Lü Fan and helped him escape from Guangling Commandery with Sun Ce&#x27;s family. Sun Ce trusted Lü Fan so highly that he treated him like a member of the Sun family and even allowed Lü Fan to dine in the presence of his mother, Lady Wu.

Lü Fan was third only to Cheng Pu and Xu Kun in terms of merit, having followed Sun Ce in his conquests in the Jiangdong region from 194 to 199. His unit defeated and killed Yan Baihu&#x27;s subordinate, Chen Mu. However, Lü Fan was concerned about the quality of Sun Ce&#x27;s army. He feared that though their forces had grown, it comprised mostly untrained rabble with just a few veterans supporting them. Lü Fan believed that such an army could achieve limited success at best. As such, he requested that Sun Ce transfer him to his personal staff and make him the commander of his forces. At the time a marshal was simply a minor staff officer responsible for training and drilling the troops. As he saw that this was a demotion for Lü Fan, Sun Ce tried to talk Lü Fan out of it, but the latter insisted and managed to convince Sun Ce to agree to his request. Lü Fan thus took charge of training Sun Ce&#x27;s troops. As Sun Ce was the supreme commander of the military forces in the Jiangdong region, Lü Fan&#x27;s authority extended to the units under the command of Sun Ce&#x27;s subordinates, effectively giving him control over the entire military administration in Jiangdong.

In 197, when Yuan Shu declared himself emperor – an act deemed treasonous against the figurehead Emperor Xian of the Han dynasty – Sun Ce broke ties with Yuan Shu and joined other warlords in a two-year-long campaign against the pretender. Chen Yu, who was sent by the warlord Cao Cao to assist Sun Ce in the campaign against Yuan Shu, secretly plotted to destroy Sun Ce from within. However, Sun Ce sensed Chen Yu&#x27;s intentions and sent Lü Fan to deal with him. Lü Fan defeated Chen Yu in battle and forced him to retreat north.

Around 199, after defeating Yuan Shu&#x27;s remnants, the minor warlord Liu Xun, as well as Huang Zu and Liu Biao at the Battle of Sha County, Sun Ce wrote a memorial to the Han central government to recommend Lü Fan to be the Administrator of Guiyang Commandery, among other things.

==Career under Sun Quan==
Following Sun Ce&#x27;s death in the year 200, his younger brother Sun Quan succeeded him and took control over his territories and forces in the Jiangdong region. In 208, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government, led a massive army to attack his rivals, Liu Bei and Sun Quan, in southern China. Sun Quan heeded the advice of Zhou Yu and Lu Su, and decided to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao. Lü Fan participated in the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208–209 under Zhou Yu&#x27;s command; the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei defeated Cao Cao&#x27;s larger army in this decisive battle. After the victory at Red Cliffs, Liu Bei visited Sun Quan at his capital. While he was there, Lu Fan secretly advised Sun Quan to have Liu Bei keep as an hostage however Sun Quan refused.

Lü Fan continued serving under Sun Quan after the end of the Eastern Han dynasty in 220. Although Sun Quan initially agreed to be a vassal king under the Cao Wei state (established by Cao Cao&#x27;s successor Cao Pi), he broke ties with Cao Pi and declared independence in 222 as the ruler of his own Eastern Wu regime.

In 223, Lü Fan led the Wu forces during the Battle of Dongkou against Wei forces led by Cao Xiu and Zang Ba. The situation was highly unfavourable for Wu at the beginning: the Wu fleet came under heavy attack and much of the fleet was destroyed in a storm. To add on to their troubles, Sun Lang, a younger half-brother of Sun Quan, accidentally burnt down the Wu forces&#x27; supply of food and weaponry. However, due to the efforts of Lü Fan&#x27;s subordinates Sun Shao and Xu Sheng, the Wu forces were able to stage a counterattack and barely win the battle.

After the Battle of Dongkou, Sun Quan appointed Lü Fan as the Governor of Yang Province. In 228, he further promoted Lü Fan to the position of Grand Marshal, but Lü Fan, who was already critically ill then, died of illness before assuming his new appointment. Sun Quan wept bitterly upon learning of Lü Fan&#x27;s death and called his name repeatedly.

== Appraisal ==
Lü Fan as a man was friendly and possessed majestic apparence. Even the men put in charge of whole province such as Lu Xun (Eastern Wu) and Quan Cong would show great reverence toward him. At the time, his depense for his house and clothes were extravagant yet he was diligent and assiduous in his duties therefore Sun Quan was pleased by his merits and wasn&#x27;t bothered by his excess.

Like his brother before him, Sun Quan highly trusted Lü Fan even though they previously had some disagreements – Sun Quan, being young and foolhardy, often embezzled official funds for his personal interests and expected Lü Fan to cover up for him. Lü Fan, however, remained honest and reported Sun Quan&#x27;s behaviour to Sun Ce, causing Sun Quan to dislike him. Nevertheless, as Sun Quan grew older and became more mature, he started to see Lü Fan in a different light and admired his honesty.

==Family==
Lü Fan had at least two sons. The elder one, whose name is not recorded in history, died early. The younger one, Lü Ju, inherited his father&#x27;s marquis title and rose through the ranks to become General of Agile Cavalry () during the reign of the second Wu emperor, Sun Liang.

<doc id="1211606" wikidata="Q6169951" url="?curid=1211606" title="Jean-Pierre Schecroun">
<text>Jean-Pierre Raphael Schecroun (17 January 1929 – 17 July 1991) was a French painter and art forger who made forgeries of work of modern masters, including Picasso and Braque.

Schecroun was born in Antananarivo, Madagascar on 17 January 1929. He was arrested for forgery in 1962. At the time he had made eight forgeries in two years and earned around £25,000. He claimed that his intention was to expose the credulity of the art dealers who refused to buy his own work but paid large sums for his forgeries. Schecroun died in Paris on 17 July 1991, at the age of 62.

<text>Augusta Raurica is a Roman archaeological site and an open-air museum in Switzerland located on the south bank of the Rhine river about 20 km east of Basel near the villages of Augst and Kaiseraugst. It is the site of the oldest known Roman colony on the Rhine.

==Founding==

Augusta Raurica, or &quot;Colonia Augusta Rauracorum&quot;, was founded by Lucius Munatius Plancus around 44 BC in the vicinity of a local Gallic tribe, the Rauraci, relatives of the Helvetii. No archaeological evidence from this period has yet been found, leading to the conclusion that, either the settlement of the colony was disturbed by the civil war following the death of Julius Caesar, or that Plancus&#x27; colony was actually in the area of modern Basel, not Augst.

Successful colonization of the site had to wait for Augustus&#x27; conquest of the central Alps around 15 BC. The oldest find to date at Augusta Raurica has been dated to 6 BC by dendrochronology.

==Name==

The inscription on Munatius Plancus&#x27; grave merely states the name of the colony as &quot;Colonia Raurica&quot;. A fragmentary inscription from the Augustinian period speaks of the &quot;Colonia P[aterna] (?) M[unatia] (?) [Felix] (?) [Apolli]naris [Augusta E]merita [Raur]ica&quot; (letters in brackets are reconstructions). Apart from this fragmentary reference, the first certain witness to the use of the name &quot;Augustus&quot; comes from the geographer Ptolemy in the Ancient Greek form &quot;Augústa Rauríkon&quot; (lat. &quot;Augusta Rauricorum&quot;).

Augusta Raurica played an important role in Augustus&#x27; plans of conquest with two other colonies that bear his name: Augusta Praetoria (modern Aosta at the southern end of the Great Saint Bernard Pass) and Augusta Vindelicum (modern Augsburg, an outpost on the Danube). These three &quot;Augustae&quot; form the corners of a triangle that reaches across the alpine conquests of Augustus, the long base of which form the Rhine knee to the Danube formed the frontier against unconquered Germania.

==Layout of the settlement==

During excavations it was determined that the city was founded on a high plateau just south of the Rhine river. Two small rivers, the Ergolz and Violen, have carved a triangle in the plateau, the base of which is about 1 kilometer wide along the base of the Jura Mountains, and the apex points northward toward the Rhine, about 1 kilometer from the base. This point is the site of the Roman castrum, or military fortification. The city is, therefore, well-defended by steep slopes to the north, east, and west.
The next step in planning the city was the surveying of the area according to the architect&#x27;s plans for the city. Every important public building had its specific place, starting with the temple of Jupiter as the sacred high point from which the street network would spread. The architect, who was responsible for executing the plans for the city, next laid a longitudinal axis across the triangle 36˚ west of north to form the main street of the settlement. Other longitudinal streets were laid out parallel to the main street at intervals of 55 meters. The main street was then divided into sections of 66 meters (255 Roman feet), which formed the corners of 10 crossing streets. This created a series of rectangular blocks of around 50 by 60 meters. The streets were laid on a solid bed of gravel and flanked by gutters on both sides. The more important roads featured covered sidewalks behind rows of columns.

==Borders==

The limits of Colonia Raurica can no longer be determined with absolute accuracy. However, the approximate boundaries can be established by examining the extent of Augst in the Early Middle Ages. This would seem to indicate the colony extended from Basel toward the mouth of the Aare, then up the Aare to the mouth of the Sigger below Solothurn, across to the Lüssel, and then back down the Birs to Basel, though this is still conjecture. New research, based on tiles stamped with the mark of the Vindonissa Legion, indicates some administrative dependence on Vindonissa. This would indicate that the colony reached over the Bözberg toward Frick, with the Thiersteinberg below Frick forming the eastern boundary. The western boundary, was near the mouth of the Birs, possibly marked by a border station. Early Roman cremation remains, found in 1937 by the church in Neuallschwil, show that such a post did exist on the main road north (toward Blotzheim) into Alsace. The Colonia Raurica, on the whole, contained the modern Canton of Basel, the Frick valley, and the eastern Jura Mountains of the Canton of Solothurn. The total area of the colony was around 700 km2.
==Subsequent history==

By the 2nd century AD, Augusta Raurica was a prosperous commercial trading centre and, in its glory days, the capital of a local Roman province. It is estimated that the population reached approximately 20,000 people. Augusta Raurica prospered between the 1st and 3rd centuries, and exported smoked pork and bacon to other parts of the Roman Empire. The city possessed the typical amenities of a Roman city, an amphitheatre, a main forum, several smaller forums, an aqueduct, a variety of temples, several public baths and the largest Roman theatre north of the Alps, with 8,000 to 10,000 seats. Many of these sites are open to visitors year-round.
In 250 AD, a powerful earthquake damaged a large part of the city. Shortly after, around 260 AD, Alemanni tribes and/or marauding Roman troops destroyed the city. The Romans attempted to maintain their military position by building a fortress on the Rhine, Castrum Rauracense, the walls of which are still partly intact. Augusta Raurica was resettled on a much smaller scale on the site of the castrum. These two settlements form the centers of the modern communities of Augst and Kaiseraugst.

In 1442, these communities were divided along the Ergolz and rivers. The western portion was given to Basel, which became a canton of Switzerland in 1501. From 1588, Basilius Amerbach, assisted by the painter Hans Bock, documented the rediscovery of the Roman settlement. In 1833, Augst became part of the Canton of Basel-Land. The eastern part became part of Habsburg territories and, to differentiate between the two towns, was renamed Kaiseraugst. Kaiseraugst became part of Switzerland in 1803 after the defeat of the Habsburgs during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Augusta Raurica today==

The excavation site and the late Roman castle, the &quot;Castrum Rauracense&quot;, are listed as heritage sites of national significance, as are the early Christian baptisterium and the brick kiln at Liebrüti.

===Excavations===
Many of the Roman buildings have been discovered and conserved through excavations, and most are open to the public:

* Amphitheatre: only modest remains exist.
* Aqueduct: supplied Augusta Raurica with drinking water from the Liestal (parts are visible and accessible in Heidenloch in Liestal, as well as northeast of the treatment plant in Füllinsdorf).
* Main forum: with the temple of Jupiter, basilica, and the assembly chamber of the town council.
* Theater: forms an architectural unit with the temple across the street.

Several private commercial buildings also have been found (a taberna, a bakery, a potter, and a tile kiln), as well as portions of a sewer. Around 80% of the built-up area has yet to be excavated. Augusta Raurica is the best-preserved Roman city north of the Alps that has not been built-over in medieval or modern times.

===Museum and Roman house===

The Roman Museum houses the most important finds from the Roman city and presents the history of Augusta Raurica. In the museum, visitors will often find special exhibits, as well as the most significant archaeological find at Augusta Raurica: the silver treasure of Kaiseraugst. This treasure hoard was found in the fortress in 1961–1962, and it is presumed to have once been the property of a commander. The museum also has a reconstruction of a Roman house, with artifacts and reconstructions showing daily domestic and commercial life from the Roman period.

<doc id="1211612" wikidata="Q278781" url="?curid=1211612" title="Idleness">
<text>Idleness is a lack of motion or energy. In describing a person, &quot;idle&quot; suggests having no labor: &quot;idly passing the day&quot;. 

In physics, an idle machine exerts no transfer of energy. When a vehicle is not in motion, an idling engine does no useful thermodynamic work. In computing, an idle processor or network circuit is not being used by any program, application, or message. 

== Cultural norms ==

Typically, when one describes a machine as idle, it is an objective statement regarding its current state. However, when used to describe a person, idle typically carries a negative connotation, with the assumption that the person is wasting their time by doing nothing of value.

Such a view is reflected in the proverb &quot;an idle mind is the devil&#x27;s workshop&quot;. Also, the popular phrase &quot;&quot; refers to idleness and can be defined as spending time doing nothing in particular in order that time seems to pass more quickly. These interpretations of idleness are not universal – they are more typically associated with Western cultures. Idleness was considered a disorderly offence in England punishable as a summary offense.

Involuntary enforced idleness is the punishment used for lazy or slacking workers in zero-hour contracts. Paid time off, which was introduced in the 20th century as a trade unionist reform, is now absent from an increasing number of job arrangements both as a money-saving mechanism and so that only work pays and thus reinforcing the stigma against idleness and enabling nature&#x27;s punishment of idleness in the form of destitution and starvation.

== Analysis and interpretation ==
Philosopher Bertrand Russell published &quot;In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays&quot; in 1935, exploring the virtues of being idle in modern society. 

Founded in 1993 by Tom Hodgkinson, the magazine &quot;The Idler&quot; is devoted to promoting the ethos of &quot;idle living&quot;. Hodgkinson published &quot;How to Be Idle&quot; in 2005 (subsequently subtitled &quot;A Loafer&#x27;s Manifesto&quot; in 2007), also aimed to improve the public perception of idling.

&quot;The Importance of Being Idle: A Little Book of Lazy Inspiration&quot; is a humorous self-help book published in August 2000. The book inspired the title of the 2005 chart-topping single by English rock band Oasis. 

Mark Slouka published the essay &quot;Quitting the Paint Factory: The Virtues of Idleness&quot;, hinting at a post-scarcity economy and linking conscious busyness with anti-democratic and fascist tendencies.

&quot;Idleness: A Philosophical Essay&quot; is a 2018 publication contending the idle state is one of true freedom.

<doc id="1211614" wikidata="Q261139" url="?curid=1211614" title="Marie Duplessis">
<text>Marie Duplessis (born Alphonsine Rose Plessis; 15 January 1824 – 3 February 1847) was a French courtesan and mistress to a number of prominent and wealthy men. She was the inspiration for Marguerite Gautier, the main character of the 1848 novel &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; by Alexandre Dumas the younger, one of Duplessis&#x27;s lovers. Much of what is known about her has been derived from the literary persona and contemporary legends.

== Early life ==

Marie Duplessis was born Alphonsine Rose Plessis in 1824 to Marin Plessis and Marie Plessis (née Deshayes) at Nonant-le-Pin, Normandy, France. At the age of 15, she moved to Paris, where she found work in a dress shop.

As recorded in art of the day Marie Duplessis was evidently an extremely attractive young woman, with a petite figure and an enchanting smile. By the time she was 16, she had become aware that prominent men were willing to give her money in exchange for her company in both private and social settings. She became a courtesan and learned to read and write, and to stay abreast of world events so as to be able to converse on these topics with her clients and at social functions. She also added the faux noble &quot;Du&quot; to her name.

== Life as a courtesan ==
Duplessis was both a popular courtesan and the hostess of a salon, where politicians, writers, and artists gathered for stimulating conversation and socializing. She rode in the Bois de Boulogne and attended opera performances. She also had her portrait painted by Édouard Viénot.

Duplessis was the mistress of Alexandre Dumas fils from September 1844 to August 1845. Afterward, she is believed to have become the mistress of composer Franz Liszt, who reportedly wished to live with her. In her short life, she gained a reputation as a discreet, intelligent, and witty lover. She remained in the good graces of many of her benefactors even after her relationships with them had ended.

She was briefly married to at least one of her lovers: Count Édouard de Perregaux (1815-1889), a French nobleman.

==Death==
Marie Duplessis died of tuberculosis at the age of 23 on 3 February 1847. Her husband, the Comte de Perregaux, and her former lover, the Baltic-German count Gustav Ernst von Stackelberg, were by her side. Within a few weeks of her death, her belongings were auctioned off to pay her debts.

Her funeral in Montmartre Cemetery in Paris was attended by hundreds of people. Her tomb can be visited at the Montmartre cemetery.

==Novel, play, and opera==
Dumas&#x27;s 1848 romantic novel &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot; was based on Duplessis. It appeared within a year of her death. In the book, Dumas became Armand Duval, and Duplessis became Marguerite Gautier. Dumas also adapted his story as a 1852 play, which inspired Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s 1853 opera &quot;La traviata&quot; and various films.

The journalist Romain Vienne was a childhood friend of hers and wrote &quot;La Vérité sur la dame aux camélias&quot; to correct some of the fictions that had grown up around her.

<text>Hallandsposten is a Swedish local morning newspaper printed in Halmstad, Sweden. It is the major newspaper of Halmstad, Hylte and Laholm municipalities

==History and profile==
&quot;Hallandsposten&quot; was established in 1850. The first issue appeared on 30 July 1850. The paper became daily in 1900, before that it was printed two times a week. One of the editors of the paper was Eric Hägge who served in the post in the early 1940s.

&quot;Hallandsposten&quot; is part of the Mediebolaget Västkusten, MBVK, which also owns &quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot;. &quot;Hallandsposten&quot; was published in broadsheet format until 2007 when it switched to tabloid format. The paper has an independent liberal leaning.

Hallandsposten was the first newspaper in Sweden to make old prints available to the public. The newspaper has digitalised all print editions since 1931. They are scanned, OCR-processed and available to the public. Older prints were excluded because original quality was too low to OCR-process.

==Circulation==
The circulation of &quot;Hallandsposten&quot; was 32,200 copies in 1996. It was 30,900 copies in 2010. Next year the paper reached 120,000 readers. The paper had a circulation of 29,100 copies in 2012 and 29,000 copies in 2013.

<doc id="1211623" wikidata="Q1612310" url="?curid=1211623" title="Husbands Bosworth">
<text>Husbands Bosworth is a large crossroads village in South Leicestershire on the A5199 road from Leicester city to Northampton and the A4304 road from Junction 20 of the M1 motorway to Market Harborough. The population of the village was 1,027 at the 2011 census.

John Cook, Solicitor General and later the prosecutor in the trial of Charles I, was baptised here on 18 September 1608 in All Saints&#x27; church.

To the north of the village the Grand Union Canal passes through a tunnel that bears the name of the village. The River Welland passes one mile to the south-east, very close to its source. The River Avon also passes close by, two miles to the south-west. On the southern boundary of the village is a thriving allotment site, immediately adjacent to the village&#x27;s cemetery.

The nearest railway station is Market Harborough.

Husbands Bosworth has long been a historic centre for the Catholic Faith. Since the Reformation, Mass has been celebrated at Bosworth Hall. In the 1870s St Mary&#x27;s Church was built to serve local Catholics. Today the church is served by the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham. The Ordinariate allows former Anglicans to enter into the Catholic Church whilst retaining some of their traditions and style of worship. Sunday Mass is at 10am and there is also a midweek program of worship.

==RAF Husbands Bosworth==

Royal Air Force Station Husbands Bosworth opened in 1943 with its main tenant being the Wellington Bombers of No. 85 Operational Training Unit (No.85 OTU), RAF Bomber Command. The unit was formed from an element from No.14 OTU and was tasked with training crews to undertake night bombing operations. No.85 OTU was disbanded on 14 June 1945, following which the Station was placed on care &amp; maintenance before finally being decommissioned in 1946. It was then subsequently used to house displaced Polish families.

Today the airfield (at ) is the home of a gliding club, and a National Police Air Service (NPAS) helicopter base. The truncated Sibbertoft Road now lies on what once was the main east–west runway.

<doc id="1211626" wikidata="Q4728573" url="?curid=1211626" title="All American Five">
<text>The term All American Five (abbreviated AA5) is a colloquial name for mass-produced, superheterodyne radio receivers that used five vacuum tubes in their design. These radio sets were designed to receive amplitude modulation (AM) broadcasts in the medium wave band, and were manufactured in the United States from the mid-1930s until the early 1960s. By eliminating a power transformer, cost of the units was kept low; the same principle was later applied to television receivers. Variations in the design for lower cost, shortwave bands, better performance or special power supplies existed, although many sets used an identical set of vacuum tubes.


==Philosophy ==
The radio was called the &quot;All American Five&quot; because the design typically used five vacuum tubes, and comprised the majority of radios manufactured for home use in the USA and Canada in the tube era.

They were manufactured in the millions by hundreds of manufacturers from the 1930s onward, and the last examples were made in Japan. The heaters of the tubes were connected in series, all requiring the same current, but with different voltages across them. The standard line up of tubes were designed so that the total rated voltage of the five tubes was 121 volts, slightly more than the electricity supply voltage of 110–117V. An extra dropper resistor was therefore not required. Transformerless designs had a metal chassis connected to one side of the power line, which was a dangerous electric shock hazard and required a thoroughly insulated cabinet. Transformerless radios could be powered by either AC or DC (consequently called AC/DC receivers)—DC supplies were still not uncommon. When operated on DC, they would only work if the plug was inserted with the correct polarity. Also, if run from a DC supply the radio had a reduced performance because the B+ voltage would only be 120 volts compared with 160–170 volts when operated from AC.

The philosophy of the design was simple: it had to be as cheap to make as possible. The design was optimized to provide good performance for the price. At least one radio manufacturer, Arthur Atwater Kent, preferred to go out of business rather than attempt to compete with &#x27;midget&#x27; or low-cost AA5 designs.

Many design tricks were used to reduce production costs of the five-tube radio. The heaters of all the vacuum tubes had to be rated to use the same current, so they could be operated in series from line voltage. The rectifier and audio output tube required more heater power, so dropped a larger voltage than the other tubes. In many designs the rectifier tube had a tap on the heater to power a dial light. The plate current was routed through that portion of the rectifier heater, in order to make up for the current diverted to the dial lamp. If the dial lamp failed, that part of the rectifier heater would have a larger current which could burn out the tube in a few months. Early radios had a resistor network to minimize the problem but this was soon eliminated as the cost of replacing the tube was not the manufacturer&#x27;s problem. As with Christmas tree lights, if one tube heater failed, none of the tube heaters would operate.

The radio used a half wave rectifier to produce a plate voltage of 160 to 170 volts directly from the AC power line; the rectifier, while not needed with a strictly DC supply, did not cause a problem.

The frequency mixer was of the pentagrid converter design to save the cost of a separate oscillator tube. The detector and first audio stage were provided by a dual diode/triode combination tube. When the detector/first audio tube contained a second diode, it could be used to provide automatic gain control (AGC), or AGC bias could be derived from the audio detector diode.

==Potential hazards of the design==
Many early examples of the &#x27;All-American Five&#x27; posed a shock hazard to users. Lacking a mains transformer, the chassis of the AA5 radio was directly connected to one side of the mains electric supply. The hazard was made worse because the on/off switch was often in the wire of the mains supply which was connected to the chassis, meaning that the chassis could be &quot;hot&quot; when the set was either &#x27;on&#x27; or &#x27;off&#x27;, depending on which way the plug was inserted in the power outlet. Many power plugs had two identical pins, and could be plugged in either way round. The metal chassis securing screws were sometimes accessible from the outside of the Bakelite or wood case, and there were many examples of owners receiving a shock by making contact with these screws while handling a set. Ventilation holes could be large enough to allow children to poke their fingers, or metal objects, through. The same type of hazard was present in European AC/DC sets, at twice the voltage.

The hazard was eliminated from later sets by the use of an internal ground bus connected to the chassis by an isolation network. Underwriters Laboratories required the adoption of the &quot;floating chassis&quot;, as isolation from the mains (the exact circuit and component values were not specified although the leakage current allowed was) to limit the shock to a &quot;safe&quot; current level. The chassis was maintained at RF ground (for shielding) by a bypass capacitor (typically 0.05 μF to 0.2 μF) usually with a resistor connected across it (typically 220 kΩ to 470 kΩ, although values as small as 22 kΩ were sometimes used or the resistor was simply omitted). Over the years, these paper capacitors often become leaky, and could allow sufficient current flow to give the user a shock.

==Variations on the theme==
Although four-, six-, and even a few rare eight-tube radios were produced, they were not common. The four-tube version with vacuum tube rectifier was of inferior performance, as they typically had no IF amplifier tube, although some four-tube designs with a selenium rectifier in place of the rectifier tube avoided this problem. The six-tube versions added either an RF amplifier tube, a push-pull audio power amplifier tube, or a beat frequency oscillator tube (to listen to Morse code or single-sideband modulation transmissions). However, these radios cost significantly more and sold in smaller quantities. The eight-tube versions cost even more, adding two or more of the features of the six-tube versions and sometimes an extra IF amplifier tube.

==Specific implementations==

The basic design of the &#x27;All-American Five&#x27; had its origins in low-cost sets produced in the early days of radio.

===Early attempts===
Radio manufacturers departed from the traditional heater voltages of 2.5, 5 and 6.3 volts to get a five tube combination that would operate as close as possible to 110–120 VAC line voltage. For the 1935 model year, designers were able to get a 5-tube heater string to total up to 78 volts. This meant that a dropping resistor or line ballast tube was needed to drop the remaining 35–42 volts. If a ballast tube was used, the radio would be marketed as a &quot;6-tube&quot; radio even though one was just a voltage dropping ballast. Other manufacturers used a &quot;line cord resistor&quot;, a special AC cord made with resistance wire which replaced a power resistor in the radio chassis. These line cords tend to get warm to the touch after the radio was in use for a while.

During the 1935–36 model years examples of 5 tube (pre-octal base or prong tubes) series strings using 300 mA heaters were:

* Detector-Oscillator: 78
* Intermediate Frequency (IF): 78
* Second Detector and First Audio Amplifier: 77
* Power Amplifier: 43
* Rectifier: 25Z5

Later when newer tubes came out another variant was:

* Pentagrid Converter: 6A7
* Intermediate Frequency (IF): 78 or 6D6
* Second Detector and First Audio Amplifier: 75
* Power Amplifier: 43
* Rectifier: 25Z5

===True 5-tube transformerless version===
The very first set of metal tubes produced included 6-volt heater tubes that could be used to make a transformer-powered 6-tube radio. RCA released their first set of these metal octal tubes for this design in 1939, using 12.6-volt 150 mA heaters instead. The original design used the following tubes:
* Converter: 12A8
* IF amplifier: 12K7
* Detector and first audio amplifier: 12Q7
* Audio power output: 50L6
* Rectifier: 35Z4

This series had the grids brought out as top caps on the signal tubes, and the 35Z4 did not have a provision for a dial light.

===Single ended tube variant===
AC/DC designs for 110–117V usually used 150 mA heater current.

The tube array in the early days of single ended octal tubes was:
* Converter: 12SA7
* IF amplifier: 12SK7
* Detector and first audio amplifier: 12SQ7
* Audio power output: 50L6
* Rectifier: 35Z5

These sets were first marketed in late 1939. Canadian sets would sometimes use a 35L6 in place of the 50L6, as parts of Canada used 110 volts as a design standard. Because areas near Niagara Falls had 25 Hz power, some Canadian sets had slightly larger filter capacitors.

===The &quot;Loctal&quot; variant===
The tube line up of the Loctal tubes was:
* Converter: 14Q7
* IF amplifier: 14A7
* Detector and first audio amplifier: 14B6
* Audio power output: 50A5
* Rectifier: 35Y4 or 35Z3

=== Miniature tubes===

After the Second World War the set was redesigned to use miniature 7-pin tubes and the line up became:
* Converter: 12BE6
* IF amplifier: 12BA6
* Detector and first audio amplifier: 12AV6 or 12AT6
* Audio power output: 50C5 or the less-common 50B5
* Rectifier: 35W4

The 50C5, introduced in 1948, is electrically identical to the 50B5, but has a revised pinout to address concerns that high peak voltage between 4 (heater) and 5 (anode) would promote socket breakdown.

In the postwar period, some makers built sets with a mixture of miniature, octal, and loctal types.

===&quot;Power-Saver&quot; version===
Another low-power variation changed the tube heaters to run on 100 milliamperes rather than 150 milliamperes. These tubes took a little longer to warm up:

* Converter: 18FX6
* IF amplifier: 18FW6
* Detector and first audio amplifier: 18FY6
* Audio power output: 32ET5 or 34GD5
* Rectifier: 36AM3

The voltage distribution has changed around the tube heaters but the total is still a little more than the 120 volt mains supply. This line-up is for an Admiral radio.

===Farm radio===
A &quot;farm radio&quot; modification (usually done at the point of sale) allowed an AA5 to run off 32 volts DC, commonly generated by farm windmills. With a relatively simple rewiring, the tube heaters could be put in series-parallel to run off 32 volts, with the three twelve-volt heaters in series and a 25L6, 35L6 or 43 in parallel; the tubes would still function with the heater voltage somewhat out of specification. If run from a 32-volt supply the radio had a substantially reduced performance because the B+ voltage would only be 32 volts compared with 160–170 volts when operated from AC. With 32 volts on the plate, the radio tended to be insensitive. Sometimes only the tube heater power was derived from a windmill, and dry batteries were retained for the plate voltage supply. The advantage was that the heaters were a high and continuous load on the battery, whereas the plate voltage battery drain was smaller and intermittent. Often a wet-cell rechargeable battery was used for tube heaters, recharged by a local garage or by exchanging with a vehicle battery.

Many 32-volt farm radios were factory-built for the purpose. They usually had two type 48 power tetrodes that could operate with B+ voltages as low as 28 volts. The type 48 pairs were parallel connected, or connected in push–pull. Some factory 32-volt radios used an electromechanical vibrator power supply to provide increased voltage. Vibrator power supplies could also be made to work from a 6 volt supply from a dedicated wind-charger or from a car battery borrowed from a farm vehicle.

===Battery operated variants===
A number of other versions of the set appeared, including some that did have a transformer, a version that operated in a motor vehicle off a 6-volt supply, using a vibrator to convert the 6V DC supply to AC which could feed a transformer with higher voltage output, and a version that operated from either dry batteries or the mains supply. The battery version commonly used tubes where the filament was heated by a single 1.5-volt dry cell and plate voltage was supplied by a (nominally) 90-volt battery.

One version, called a &quot;Three-way portable&quot; because it could be operated any of three ways: batteries, the AC line, or the DC line; typically had the following tube array:
* Converter: 1R5 (or 1L6 if the set was shortwave, such as the Zenith Trans-Oceanic)
* IF amplifier: 1U4
* Detector and first audio amplifier: 1U5
* Audio power output: 3V4
* Rectifier: 35W4, 117Z3, or a selenium rectifier

This version used a 7.5 V A battery and a 90 V B battery. Note that the A battery did not need to heat the rectifier tube because, when operating from the batteries, the rectifier was not needed.

When operating on batteries, this version had almost instant warmup because of the tubes used their filaments as cathodes.
This setup was common on Motorola portable radios commonly resembling metal &quot;lunch boxes&quot;.

===Variations===
Since the AA5 was a minimalist design, there was plenty of room for enhanced versions, resulting in an &quot;AA6&quot;:

* A few sets added an extra 12SK7 as an RF or IF amplifier. This would require using a 35L6 to maintain the heater voltage.
* Or, another audio amplifier tube could be added for increased audio output. To keep the total heater voltage at around 120 V, the two output tubes would have to be 25 to 35-volt types, such as the 35L6 or 25L6.

There were even a few &quot;AA4&quot; designs, usually midget sets, only usable in strong-signal metropolitan areas, because most had no IF amplifier (although some replaced the rectifier tube with a selenium rectifier).

==Series string order==
According to various editions of the &quot;RCA Receiving Tube Manual&quot;, the heater string of an AC/DC radio should be arranged in a particular order to minimize hum. Assuming that all functions are performed by separate tubes, the heaters in the string should be arranged as follows:
#Input stage
#Ballast tube or resistor
#Rectifier
#Audio power output amplifier
#RF and IF amplifiers
#Converter
#First AF amplifier
#Detector
#Ground/B-minus line
Not all manufacturers followed this recommendation.

==Effect on television design==
Many black-and-white and color television receivers were built using All American Five principles, including a hot chassis and series-wired heaters. The designs were found primarily in portable or inexpensive sets ranging from the 1950s to even as late as the GE Portacolor series which was finally discontinued in the 1980s. Early sets tended to use selenium rectifiers in place of a tube; later sets used silicon diodes. Some of these sets were hybrid, using transistors for small signal applications and vacuum tubes in place of then-expensive power transistors. Some also included a rectifier diode in series with the tube filaments; when the set was off, the rectifier kept the filaments partially heated, a technique given a variety of names such as &quot;Instant On&quot;.

==Servicing precautions==
Since the chassis of the set may be connected directly to the live side of the power line, service shops used an isolation transformer to protect technicians from a shock hazard. Some restorers will rewire the hot chassis set to put the chassis at neutral at all times. Some designs only require polarizing the plug, while others require rewiring the power supply to remove the switch from chassis ground. Power outlets must be wired properly for this modification to be protective.

<doc id="1211633" wikidata="Q302585" url="?curid=1211633" title="Oh, Inverted World">
<text>Oh, Inverted World is the debut studio album by American indie rock band The Shins, released on June 19, 2001, to critical acclaim. Omnibus Records put out an initial run of vinyl distributed by Darla. Sub Pop Records reprinted the vinyl, but the Sub Pop logo only appears on later pressings.

The album contains the songs &quot;Caring Is Creepy&quot; and &quot;New Slang&quot;, both of which appeared in the 2004 film &quot;Garden State&quot; and on its soundtrack.

== Background ==
The album was released several months after its lead single, &quot;New Slang&quot;, had debuted. The song garnered substantial critical acclaim to the point where label Sub Pop gave the Shins a record deal. The album was thus seen as one of the most anticipated indie releases of 2001. Some of the songs on the album existed in an embryonic form back when front man James Mercer was a member of another older band named Flake Music. The aforementioned band was based more in straight-ahead 90&#x27;s alternative rock like Superchunk, whereas these nascent &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; songs were more inspired by Elephant 6 bands and oldies radio. This mismatch led to Mercer forming The Shins, in which he could explore this divergent sound. 

The song &quot;Know Your Onion!&quot; was based on a saying of Mercer&#x27;s mother, who would say the idiosyncratic phrase &quot;know your onion!&quot; which referred to having discipline in order to do a job well, with Mercer giving an example by saying &quot;you really gotta know your onion to, I don&#x27;t know, be an electrician or something.&quot; Mercer had said that the song&#x27;s lyrics are about &quot;getting your shit together and figuring out who are. You know, after high school and all the stupidness of that.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; placed at number 35 on the Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for best album of 2001. Online music magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; at number 115 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s.

==Legacy==
In a 2003 interview published in the San Francisco Foghorn, the official student newspaper of the University of San Francisco, Mercer was asked whether he was happy with the way &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; came out. Mercer responded by saying &quot;As far as how it sounds, no. I don&#x27;t know, it was okay. I mean, there are a lot of records that sound more perfect, or close to perfect.&quot; In a 2021 retrospective interview, Mercer identified closing track &quot;The Past and Pending&quot; as most likely being his favorite song on the album, stating that &quot;it just works on me probably more than the other songs do.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; was also the name of a web series created by Terence Krey. Released in November 2010, it was largely inspired by The Shins&#x27; music as well as other indie artists such as Arcade Fire and The Decemberists. The 13-part sci-fi web series was a story of four twentysomethings returning home from college to find that the Moon is falling into the Earth. The web series was called by &quot;The New York Times&quot; a &quot;mumblecore &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; was certified platinum, for sales of one million units, by the Recording Industry Association of America in May 2023. It is the third album released by Sub Pop to be certified at that level, after &quot;Bleach&quot; by Nirvana and &quot;Give Up&quot; by The Postal Service.

== 20th anniversary reissue ==
The original mastered audio files for both this album as well as its follow-up &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot;, which were stored on an HP Pavilion in Mercer&#x27;s home, were stolen in 2003. However, this didn&#x27;t affect the ability to remaster the album because he still had access to the original masters stored on DATs by the mastering company, and only made it impossible to do remixes (save for &quot;New Slang&quot;, the relevant file of which was preserved on a DVD Mercer made). In April 2021, a 20th anniversary reissue of &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; was announced for release on June 11, 2021. The reissue was remastered by Bob Ludwig, with The Shins&#x27; James Mercer serving as an assistant, and features new artwork, booklet and packaging.

<text>Jorge Raschke García (born 12 December 1945 from New York City) is a Pentecostal, Assemblies of God evangelist who is well known for his political opinions as well as for his religious evangelistic events. He is of German (Ashkenazi) and Afro-Caribbean Spanish (Sephardic) descent.
Raschke has travelled all over Latin America and the United States preaching, and has held conferences and church services in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and other countries. Raschke has been holding a yearly event, (), for forty-four years. The event is held in September, on Labor Day, at the north entrance of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Capitol building, and draws thousands of Christians from around Puerto Rico.

Raschke&#x27;s daughter, Kimmey, was a member of the Senate of Puerto Rico. Raschke has another daughter, Kathryn, and a son, Jorge Isaac. Raschke owns WJVP 89.3 FM, a radio station in Culebra, Puerto Rico, which is operated by Clamor Broadcasting Network, Inc. and United WM Media.

==Views==
Because of his religious credentials, he is often quoted in newspapers. He is outspoken and attends protests (with his followers) to express indignation or support for a cause or a person. In 1993, Raschke was one of hundreds of religious leaders leading protests against Madonna&#x27;s Girlie Show World Tour, which began in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. Protests did not stop the concert from taking place.

Raschke generally supports the New Progressive Party (PNP). In 2019, he supported Ricardo Rosselló, the governor, who was forced to resign for Telegramgate. Raschke attended the protests demanding that Rosselló &quot;not&quot; resign and to rescind his resignation once he had. During the protests, Raschke was making declarations with a megaphone, about different, past governors&#x27; immoral conduct in , the governor&#x27;s mansion. When a 60-year woman resident of the Old San Juan neighborhood, yelled that Raschke was corrupt, she was arrested. He and other religious leaders of Puerto Rico later met with Wanda Vázquez, Rosselló&#x27;s successor.

Raschke has been one of several religious leaders to be singled out by Pedro Julio Serrano, a Puerto Rican LGBT and human rights activist, for spreading homophobia.

<doc id="1211643" wikidata="Q6918099" url="?curid=1211643" title="Motor (Australian magazine)">
<text>Motor was an Australian automobile magazine published monthly by Are Media. &quot;Motor&quot; was Australia&#x27;s leading performance car publication, with two major awards for automotive manufacturers: Performance Car of the Year and Sports Car of the Year.

==History and profile==
&quot;Motor&quot; magazine was originally published as &quot;Modern Motor&quot; from its inaugural issue on 9 May 1954 by the Colin Ryrie as MD of Modern Magazines and Jules Feldman as editor. The name derived from the publishing house that produced it, Modern Magazines. Colloquially, the title was abbreviated to &quot;Motor&quot;, and subsequently the word &#x27;Modern&#x27; was dropped from the title to become simply &quot;Motor&quot; in 1992. The magazine is headquartered in Melbourne.

Dylan Campbell was the editor between 2013 and 2020. After switching to Wheels in September 2020, Campbell was succeeded as editor by Andy Enright.

As of 2020 &quot;Motor&quot; was being published by Are Media, the successor to the Bauer Media Australia.

It was announced in April 2022 that the June 2022 issue of Motor will be the magazine&#x27;s last, ending sixty-eight years of continuous publication. 

==Bang For Your Bucks==

<doc id="1211651" wikidata="Q2593866" url="?curid=1211651" title="Germanos Karavangelis">
<text>Germanos Karavangelis (, also transliterated as &quot;Yermanos&quot; and &quot;Karavaggelis&quot; or &quot;Karavagelis&quot;, 1866–1935) was known for his service as Metropolitan Bishop of Kastoria and later Amaseia, Pontus. He was a member of the Hellenic Macedonian Committee and functioned as one of the major coordinators of the Greek Struggle for Macedonia.

==Early life and career==
Germanos Karavangelis was born Stylianos in 1866, in the village of Stipsi at Lesbos island, then still under Ottoman rule. His father was a Psariot by the name of Chrysostomos and his mother was Maria. He had seven other siblings which included six sisters and one brother. When he was two years old, his family moved to Adramyttio, Asia-Minor (now Edremit, Turkey) where his father opened a shop. There, he attended school and was awarded a scholarship to study at the Theological School of Halki. He graduated in 1888, when he was ordained a Deacon and received the name Germanos. He then went on to study philosophy at the University of Leipzig and University of Bonn.

Germanos received a doctorate and went to Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) where in 1891 he was assigned as a professor of Ecclesiastical History and Theology at the Theological School of Halki, where he had previously attended. As a professor, he wrote an encyclopedia of theology as well as scientific works and ecclesiastical discourses. In 1886, he was ordained a bishop with the title &quot;Bishop of Charioupolis.&quot; At this new position, he fought for more Greek education and to curb anti-Greek sentiment. He assisted in sending Greek students abroad for higher education and was successful in recruiting 130 to the newly built Zografeion Lyceum. He also founded a girls&#x27; school by the name of &quot;Karavangeli Girls&#x27; School.&quot; Karavangelis would also organize Sunday school classes and train new Clergymen.

From 1896 to 1900 he would serve as the Bishop of Pera (now Beyoğlu, Turkey).

== Metropolitan of Kastoria and the Macedonian Struggle ==
He was a Metropolitan Bishop of Kastoria, in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, from 1900 until 1907, appointed in the name of the Greek state by the ambassador of Greece Nikolaos Mavrokordatos and was one of the main coordinators of the Greek Struggle for Macedonia that had an aim of defending the Greek and Greek Orthodox clerical interests against the Turks and the Bulgarians in then Ottoman Turkish-ruled Macedonia.

During the Macedonian struggle, Karavangelis directed the Greek response to supporters of the Bulgarian cause, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO) and the Exarchate. At the time Karavangelis would travel in rural areas, and portrayed a fierce image of himself dressed with a dark raincoat, a bandolier on one side of his shoulder and a gun on the other with a scarf tied around his clerical hat. He would assist in raising the morale of those aligned with the Patriarchate and in organizing armed bands to fight the Komitadjis. Karavangelis viewed Bulgarian influence within the area as a threat to Greek interests. He advocated for close relations and interaction among Turks and Greeks in the region, but only in the context of when it was needed. Karavangelis viewed the rivalry between the Patriarchate and Exarchate as lacking religious dimensions and that the main concern preoccupying Balkan states was the post-Ottoman future of in the region after the empire was removed from Macedonia. Greece at the time sent more funds, men and arms to individuals such as Karavangelis in Macedonia. He was successful in returning many villages to the Patriarchate. 
Karavangelis organized armed groups composed mainly of Greek army officers and volunteers brought from Crete, the Peloponnese and other parts of Greek populated areas, and even worked with Pavlos Melas. He also recruited local Macedonian Greeks such as the chieftain Vangelis Strebreniotis from the village of Srebreni (now Asprogeia), and Konstantinos Kottas, a former member of IMRO, who in 1903, under the orders of Karavangelis, killed and beheaded Bulgarian revolutionary Lazar Poptraykov. The head was delivered to Karavangelis, which he placed on his desk and photographed. 
In 1905, Karavangelis was present when Orthodox priest Kristo Negovani conducted the Divine Liturgy in the Albanian Tosk dialect. Karavangelis denounced the usage of Albanian in mass and under his orders had Negovani murdered. In 1905, Karavangelis also ordered the slaughter of resisting Bulgarian inhabitants in the village of Zagorichani (today Vasileiada).

Karavangelis succeeded in strengthen Greek aspirations in Macedonia and thus helped the later incorporation of the major part of Macedonia by Greece in the Balkan Wars, for which he is praised as a national hero of the Greek Struggle for Macedonia (&quot;Makedonomachos&quot;). He is the author of the book of memoirs &quot;The Macedonian Struggle&quot; ().

== Metropolitan of Amaseia and the Greco-Turkish War ==
In 1907, following Bulgarian complaints and Russian pressure, Karavangelis was removed from his position by orders of the Sultan. He returned to Constantinople as a Synod until the collapse of the Diocese of Amaseia in January 1908. The Patriarch had requested that Karavangelis fill the recently vacated position, and so he became the Metropolitan of Amaseia, based in Sampsounta. There, he helped create schools in the most remote villages and established a high school for Greek education. He also assisted in the formation of armed groups to defend the Greek and Armenian population from Turkish aggression and persecution by the Young Turks. During massacres of local Armenians, Karavangelis along with Chrysanthos of Trebizond and Bishop Efthymios were able to save hundreds by hiding them in the Metropolitan Church and other Greek homes. Their efforts were recognized by a United States-based Armenian newspaper. For his actions, he was arrested and sent to Constantinople in 1917, where he would remain in prison for some time.

Following his release and the intensification of the Greco-Turkish War, he was sentenced to death in absentia by Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s military tribunal in 1921. In the same year, Karavangelis proposed a Greek-Armenian-Kurdish cooperation to subdue the Turkish Nationalist Movement, to the Greek Foreign Minister Georgios Baltatzis. This, however, would not come to flourishment. He was also large advocate for a Republic of Pontus which had made him an even larger target for the Turkish Nationalist forces.

In August 1922, he was in Bucharest for the coronation of Ferdinand I of Romania when disaster struck the Greeks. He got on the first ship to Constantinople, however he was not permitted to leave the steamer by the troops of Kemal. He was given a letter by the Patriarch which had notified him that if he left the boat he would be arrested and executed. The Patriarch appointed him Metropolitan of Ioannina for his own safety.

== Later career and death ==
In 1924, having been the Metropolitan of Ioannina for just over a year, Karavangelis received a letter notifying him of his appointment of Metropolitan of the Ecumenical Patriarchate based in Budapest. He initially protested, however, he was not listened to. Many believe Karavangelis was replaced based on his Venizelist views and he considered this appointment a mockery and a form of exile. in April of the same year, the Patriarchate proposed a transfer of the headquarters from Budapest to Vienna. After his relocation, he worked tirelessly to revitalize Greek communities in Austria and neighbouring Hungary and Italy.

In 1926, he was angered by the decision of dictatorial government of Theodoros Pangalos to cut his salary by over half and was forced to rely on donations for basic needs.

On February 11, 1935, Germanos Karavangelis died of a heart attack in a hotel south of Vienna at 68 years of age. He was buried in Vienna despite his request to be buried in Greece in his will.

== Legacy ==
Germanos Karavangelis ranks among the most well known participants of the Greek struggle for Macedonia.

He was awarded Order of the White Eagle and Order of Saint Sava.

His memoirs from the Macedonian Struggle were published in 1959. In 1992, his account, along with those of other Makedonomachoi, was included in &quot;Figures of the Macedonian Struggle, together with the &quot;Affairs of Pontus&quot; by Germanos Karavangelis&quot; by Antigoni Bellou-Threpsiadis.

Also in 1959, the &quot;Institute for the Study of the Balkan Peninsula&quot;, along with the &quot;Society for Macedonian Studies&quot; (both of Thessaloniki) arranged the transfer of his bones, first to Thessaloniki, then finally to Kastoria.

There are monuments dedicated to him in Kastoria.

<text>Dudley Dexter Watkins (27 February 1907 – 20 August 1969) was an English cartoonist and illustrator. He is best known for his characters &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; and &quot;The Broons&quot;; comic strips featuring them have appeared in the Scottish newspaper &quot;The Sunday Post&quot; since 1936, along with annual compilations. Watkins also illustrated comics such as &quot;The Beano&quot;, &quot;The Dandy&quot;, &quot;The Beezer&quot; and &quot;Topper&quot;, and provided illustrations for Christian stories. Watkins was posthumously inducted into the British Comic Awards Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Early life==
Watkins was born in Prestwich, Lancashire, England. However, the family moved to Nottingham while he was still a baby. His father was a lithographic print artist who noted the boy&#x27;s early artistic talent and ensured he received extra art classes at the Nottingham School of Art. By the age of 10, the local newspaper declared him a &quot;schoolboy genius.&quot; He studied at Nottingham School of Art, and while working for Boots Pure Drug company in the early 1920s, Watkins&#x27; first published artwork appeared in Boots&#x27; staff magazine, &quot;The Beacon&quot;.

==Work with D.C. Thomson==
In 1924 Watkins entered the Glasgow School of Art. In 1925 the school principal recommended Watkins to the thriving publisher D.C. Thomson, based in Dundee. Watkins was offered a six-month employment contract with D. C. Thomson, so he moved to their Dundee base and began providing illustrations for Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Big Five&quot; story papers for boys (&quot;Adventure&quot;, &quot;Rover&quot;, &quot;Wizard&quot;, and later &quot;Skipper&quot; and &quot;Hotspur&quot;). The temporary employment turned into a full-time career; for several years he was just another illustrator, supplementing his small salary by teaching Illustration at Dundee College of Art c.1934-38. In 1933 Watkins turned his hand to comic strip work, and soon his editor noticed that Watkins had a special talent as a cartoonist. In 1933 he drew &quot;The Rover Midget Comic&quot; and in 1934 he drew &quot;The Skipper Midget Comic&quot;. In 1935 Watkins&#x27; first regular comic strip, &quot;Percy Vere and His Trying Tricks&quot; appeared; the titular character was an inept magician whose tricks usually backfired on him. The strip ran for nearly two years, finally being replaced with another Watkins creation, &quot;Wandering Willie The Wily Explorer&quot; (Willie&#x27;s hard-boiled characteristics would later re-appear in the form of &quot;Desperate Dan&quot;). While &quot;Percy&quot; was still appearing in &quot;Adventure&quot;, Watkins co-created, with writer/editor R. D. Low, what would become his most famous characters, &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; and &quot;The Broons&quot;. They were part of the first issue (8 March 1936) of a weekly eight-page pull-out &#x27;Fun Section&#x27; of The Sunday Post. He was soon illustrating the &quot;Desperate Dan&quot; strip for &quot;The Dandy&quot; comic, launched in December 1937.

His workload was further increased when D.C. Thomson created &quot;The Beano&quot;, an eight-page comic booklet, with Watkins being responsible for drawing the &quot;Lord Snooty&quot; strip. The Beano&#x27;s first edition was dated 30 July 1938. When the &quot;Beezer&quot; and &quot;Topper&quot; were launched in the 1950s, Watkins was responsible for illustrating the &quot;Ginger&quot; strip (based largely on &quot;Oor Wullie&quot;, but unlike that strip the text was written in standard English and not in Scots vernacular) and the &quot;Mickey the Monkey&quot; strip for the two comics.

Watkins&#x27; most enduring adventure strip was &quot;Jimmy and his Magic Patch&quot;, which debuted in the 1 January 1944 issue of The Beano and ran for 18 years.

Watkins was one of only two D. C. Thomson cartoonists who signed their work (beginning in June 1946), which was known for its intricate detail and unique style. The other cartoonist to sign his work was Allan Morley and he was the first to do so.

==Personal life==
He was a devout Christian and an enthusiastic supporter of the Church of Christ in Dundee (where he met his wife). He contributed artwork for mission calendars, and from 1956 he produced (free of charge) the comic strips &quot;William the Warrior&quot; and &quot;Tony &amp; Tina – The Twins&quot; for &quot;The Young Warrior&quot;, a children&#x27;s paper published by the WEC Publications. These strips, filled with quotations from Scripture, were collected into a series of booklets. In March 2008 a watercolour by Watkins depicting The Crucifixion was discovered in a house in Lochgelly, Fife.

Watkins and his wife built a substantial house in Broughty Ferry which he named &quot;Winsterly&quot;. He continued working with D. C. Thomson for the rest of his life. On 20 August 1969 he was found dead at his drawing board, the victim of a heart attack.

D. C. Thomson continued to reprint &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; and &quot;Broons&quot; strips in &quot;The Sunday Post&quot; for seven years before a replacement was found. Watkins&#x27; &quot;Desperate Dan&quot; strips were reprinted in &quot;The Dandy&quot; for fourteen years.

<doc id="1211658" wikidata="Q1058300" url="?curid=1211658" title="Suematsu Kenchō">
<text>Viscount was a Japanese politician, intellectual and author who lived in the Meiji and Taishō periods. Apart from his activity in the Japanese government, he also wrote several important works on Japan in English. He was portrayed in a negative manner in Ryōtarō Shiba&#x27;s novel &quot;Saka no ue no kumo&quot;.

==Early life==
Suematsu was born in the hamlet of Maeda in Buzen Province, now part of Yukuhashi, Fukuoka Prefecture. He was the fourth son of the village headman (&quot;shōya&quot;), Suematsu Shichiemon. His name was initially , he later changed it to the shorter Kenchō.

At the age of ten he enrolled in a private school where he pursued studies in Chinese (&quot;kangaku&quot; 漢学). Suematsu went to Tokyo in 1871, and studied with and . In 1872, he briefly entered the Tokyo Normal School, but left it soon after. It was around this time that he made the acquaintance of Takahashi Korekiyo.

In 1874, at age 20, Suematsu began working for the &quot;Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun&quot; newspaper (predecessor to the &quot;Mainichi Shinbun&quot;), writing editorials under the pen name . During his time working for the newspaper, he was befriended by its editor, Fukuchi Gen&#x27;ichirō.

==Suematsu at Cambridge==
Suematsu arrived in London in 1878 with the Japanese embassy which was dispatched there, and enrolled in Cambridge University in 1881. He graduated with a law degree from Cambridge (St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge) in 1884, returning to Japan in 1886.

==Political activities==
Suematsu was elected to the Diet of Japan in 1890. Suematsu served as Communications Minister (1898) and Home Minister in his father-in-law Itō Hirobumi&#x27;s fourth cabinet, 1900–01. He had married Itō&#x27;s second daughter Ikuko in 1889 when he was 35 and she was 22. As they were from clans which had fought in the 1860s (Kokura and Chōshū), he joked about his marriage as &quot;taking a hostage&quot;.

Suematsu was influential in the founding of Moji port in 1889, approaching Shibusawa Eiichi for finance. He also worked to improve the moral standards of Japanese theatre and founded a society for drama criticism.

Suematsu was raised to the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage in 1895, when he was made a baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;).

From 1904 to 1905 Suematsu was sent by the Japanese cabinet to Europe to counteract anti-Japanese propaganda of the Yellow Peril variety (e.g. Russian or German circles) and argue Japan&#x27;s case in the Russo-Japanese War, much as Harvard-educated Kaneko Kentarō was doing at the request of Itō Hirobumi at the same time in the United States. He was promoted to viscount (&quot;shishaku&quot;) in 1907.

==Literary activities==
Suematsu was also active as a writer of English works on Japanese subjects. His works include the first English translation of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; (which he wrote while at Cambridge) and several books on aspects of Japanese culture.

<doc id="1211661" wikidata="Q3088229" url="?curid=1211661" title="Rasburicase">
<text>Rasburicase, sold under the brand name Elitek in the US and Fasturtec in the EU, is a medication that helps to clear uric acid from the blood. It is a recombinant version of urate oxidase, an enzyme that metabolizes uric acid to allantoin. Urate oxidase is known to be present in many mammals but does not naturally occur in humans. Rasburicase is produced by a genetically modified &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; strain. The complementary DNA (cDNA) coding for rasburicase was cloned from a strain of &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;.

Rasburicase () is a tetrameric protein with identical subunits. Each subunit is made up of a single 301 amino acid polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of about 34 kDa. The drug product is a sterile, white to off-white, lyophilized powder intended for intravenous administration following reconstitution with a diluent. Elitek (rasburicase) is supplied in 3 mL and 10 mL colorless, glass vials containing rasburicase at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL after reconstitution.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Rasburicase is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (and European counterparts) for the prevention and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in people receiving chemotherapy for hematologic cancers such as leukemias and lymphomas. However, it is not clear if it results in important benefits such as decreased kidney problems or decreased risk of death as of 2017.

It is being investigated for treating severely high blood levels of uric acid from other sources. For example, it has been used for hyperuricemia in gout, in other rheumatologic conditions, and in rhabdomyolysis with kidney failure.

=== Contraindication ===
Rasburicase use is contraindicated in patients with a G6PDH deficiency as it may cause sudden, severe hemolysis. The blood smear revealed numerous abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) with membranous defects (bite cells) and submembranous blister-like structures (blister cells). These cell types are characteristic of Heinz body hemolytic anemia (HBHA). While Heinz bodies are not visible on a Giemsa-stained smear, they can be detected with supravital staining, appearing as 1- to 3-μm inclusions in RBCs (inset).

==Side effects==
Rasburicase administration can cause anaphylaxis (incidence unknown); methemoglobinemia may occur in susceptible individuals such as those with G6PDH deficiency due to the production of hydrogen peroxide in the urate oxidase reaction. Testing patients for G6PDH deficiency prior to starting a course of rasburicase has been recommended.

==Pharmacology==

=== Mechanism of Action ===
In humans, uric acid is the final step in the catabolic pathway of purines. Rasburicase catalyzes enzymatic oxidation of poorly soluble uric acid into an inactive and more soluble metabolite allantoin with carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide as byproducts in the chemical reaction.

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
The measurement of plasma uric acid was used to evaluate the effectiveness of rasburicase in clinical studies. Following administration of either 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg rasburicase daily for up to 5 days, plasma uric acid levels decreased within 4 hours and were maintained below 7.5 mg/dL in 98% of adult and 90% of pediatric patients for at least 7 days. There was no evidence of a dose response effect on uric acid control for doses between 0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg rasburicase.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
The pharmacokinetics of rasburicase were evaluated in both pediatric and adult patients with leukemia, lymphoma or other hematological malignancies. Rasburicase exposure, as measured by AUC0-24 hr and Cmax, tended to increase with a dose range from 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg. The mean terminal half-life was similar between pediatric and adult patients and ranged from 15.7 to 22.5 hours. The mean volume of distribution of rasburicase ranged from 110 to 127 mL/kg in pediatric patients and from 75.8 to 138 mL/kg in adult patients, respectively. Minimal accumulation of rasburicase ( &lt; 1.3 fold) was observed between days 1 and 5 of dosing. In adults, age, gender, baseline liver enzymes and creatinine clearance did not impact the pharmacokinetics of rasburicase. A cross-study comparison revealed that after administration of rasburicase at 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg, the geometric mean values of body-weight normalized clearance were approximately 40% lower in Japanese (n=20) than that in Caucasians (n=22).

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===
Rasburicase is much more expensive than the conventional uric acid lowering treatment for tophaceous gout.

<text>Rada Jedności Narodowej (&quot;Council of National Unity&quot;, RJN) was the quasi-parliament of the Polish Underground State during World War II. It was created by the Government Delegate on 9 January 1944.

==History==
Originally the political arm of the Polish Secret State was Political Consultative Committee (&quot;Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy&quot;, &quot;PKP&quot;), a council composed of 4 main political parties. On 21 March 1943 it was renamed to Home Political Representation (&quot;Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna&quot;, &quot;KRP&quot;) and became an underground coalition parliament, composed of members of Polish Socialist Party, National Party, People&#x27;s Party and Labor Party. It became the controlling body of both the Delegate&#x27;s Office and the Headquarters of the Armia Krajowa.

On 9 January 1944 it was turned into Council of National Unity, the underground parliament of Poland. Initially only the rump council was chosen, composed mostly of members of the former KRP. On 12 March of the same year the Council was extended to include more members.

RJN was opposed to the communist-controlled quasi-parliament, State National Council.

On 15 March 1944, the RJN declared its manifesto named &quot;O co walczy naród polski&quot; (&quot;What does the Polish nation fight for&quot;). According to the document, the main aims of Poland in the Second World War were:
* restoration of free, independent, strong and safe Poland
* reaching an international peace
* cooperation of all nations
* defeating Germany, its dismemberment and disarmament
* forcing Germany to rebuild the countries it destroyed
* organisation of a trial of war criminals
* alliance with France, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States
* restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union

Regarding the post-war Poland, the RJN declared that its borders were to be based on the borders as of 1938, with East Prussia, Opole Silesia and part of Pomerania incorporated as war reparations. The Polish political system was to be based on parliamentary democracy, with strong self-government. The RJN also declared the will to develop the Polish industry and base the economy on socialist principles of planned economy and land reform.

During the Warsaw Uprising the RJN issued several appeals and open letters to the western powers asking to help Warsaw and the Polish struggle for independence. On 22 February 1945, protested against the outcome of the Yalta Conference and the fact that no representatives of Poland were informed of the meeting. At the same time the RJN proposed to accept communist into the provisional government.

After the Red Army conquered Poland, the members of the RJN remained underground. In March 1945 large part of them were arrested by the NKVD and brought to Moscow. After 3 months of interrogations, the members of the Polish government were sentenced in the Trial of the Sixteen.

Until May 1945 the RJN was reconstructed from the remaining members. However, the Soviet occupation of Poland and the end of World War II made the further existence of RJN pointless. On 1 July 1945, the RJN issued the &quot;Do Narodu Polskiego i Narodów Zjednoczonych&quot; (&quot;To the Polish Nation and the United Nations&quot;) manifesto and the so-called &quot;Testament of the Fighting Poland&quot;, in which it underlined the basic Polish aims of the war and the principles of Polish-Soviet relations. The latter document also demanded that the Red Army be withdrawn from Poland, the communists stopped reprisals and terror against the soldiers of the Polish Secret State and the civilians, democracy be introduced and the social reforms be started.

After issuing the documents, the RJN was dissolved.

==Composition==

Since Poland was still under enemy occupation and no elections could be held, it was decided that the RJN would include representatives of all major political parties of Poland. Initially it included representatives of Socialist Party, People&#x27;s Party, Labor Party and National Party and the Catholic clergy (three representatives each). In July 1944 the RJN was extended to include also representatives of Chłopska Organizacja Wolności, Ojczyzna, ZD and representatives of co-operative movement.

The RJN was headed by the Main Commission. Its head was Kazimierz Pużak (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; Bazyli). After he was arrested and sentenced in a staged Trial of the Sixteen, the Main Commission was headed by various politicians, chosen from among the remainder of the council for a 1-month term.

<text>Richard Treat Williams Jr. (December 1, 1951 – June 12, 2023) was an American actor, whose career on stage and in film and television spanned five decades. He received many accolades for his work, including nominations for three Golden Globe Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and an Independent Spirit Award.

Williams began his career on Broadway, portraying Danny Zuko in the original run of &quot;Grease&quot; (1972). After supporting roles in the films &quot;The Ritz&quot; and &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (both 1976), he rose to fame with starring roles in Miloš Forman&#x27;s film version of the musical &quot;Hair&quot; and in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s historical comedy &quot;1941&quot;, both released in 1979. He received further acclaim for his performance in the Sidney Lumet crime drama &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981).

He appeared in many other films throughout his career, both in leading and supporting roles, including &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984), &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (1984), &quot;Smooth Talk&quot; (1985), &quot;The Men&#x27;s Club&quot; (1986), &quot;Dead Heat&quot; (1988), &quot;The Phantom&quot; (1996), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; (1997), &quot;Deep Rising&quot; (1998), the &quot;Substitute&quot; franchise (1998–2001), &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; (1999), &quot;Miss Congeniality 2&quot; (2005), and &quot;127 Hours&quot; (2010). Among his television roles, he starred as Dr. Andy Brown on the drama series &quot;Everwood&quot; (2002–2006), for which he received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actor. Subsequent television work included &quot;White Collar&quot; (2012–2013), &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; (2013–2018), and &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; (2016–2023). He also starred as Mick O&#x27;Brien on the Hallmark series &quot;Chesapeake Shores&quot; (2016–2022) and as Bill Paley in the FX miniseries &quot;&quot; (2024), the latter being his final appearance on screen.

Throughout his career, Williams returned to the Broadway stage, appearing in productions of &quot;Over Here!&quot; (1974), &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (1978), &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1981), &quot;Love Letters&quot; (1989), and &quot;Follies&quot; (2001).

==Early life and education==
Williams was born in Stamford, Connecticut, on December 1, 1951, the son of Marian (née Andrew), an antiques dealer, and Richard Norman Williams, a corporate executive. He moved with his family to Rowayton, Connecticut, when he was three. His maternal great-great-great-grandfather was William Henry Barnum, a U.S. senator from Connecticut and third cousin of the showman P. T. Barnum. Williams was a distant relative of both Robert Treat Paine—a signatory to the Declaration of Independence—and Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States.

Williams played football in high school and college. He graduated from the Kent School in Connecticut and Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. As a teenager, he acted in high school and local theatre productions, and began to think seriously about an acting career during his first year of college: &quot;I loved football very much, but I didn&#x27;t think you could be a jock and be in the theatre company at the same time … I started to get serious about learning as much as possible about the craft of acting in my freshman year.&quot; At one point, he was performing in three college shows simultaneously: &quot;a comedy, a Shakespeare and a musical&quot;.

==Career==

=== 1972–1979: Stage work and film breakthrough ===

Williams launched his professional acting career in musical theatre; first as an understudy to several of the male leads in the 1972 Broadway production of &quot;Grease&quot;, and then in a touring production of that musical. From March 1974 to January 1975, he starred as Utah in the Sherman Brothers&#x27; musical &quot;Over Here!&quot;. He then returned to &quot;Grease&quot; on Broadway in the lead role of Danny Zuko for three years, later saying of the experience, &quot;I had grown up learning all of the songs from &quot;West Side Story&quot;, so I was aware of what a big deal &#x27;Broadway&#x27; was. When I got my first little dressing room at the Royale Theatre, [I] thought, &#x27;I&#x27;ve arrived. I&#x27;m here. This is fantastic!&#x27;&quot;.

In 1975, Williams made his feature film debut with a supporting role in the thriller &quot;Deadly Hero&quot;. He received positive notices the following year for his portrayal of Michael Brick—a squeaky-voiced private detective—in &quot;The Ritz&quot;, a farcical comedy based on the play of the same name, and next appeared in a small part in the British war film &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1976). Williams came to worldwide attention in 1979 when he starred as George Berger—a leading member of a gang of flower children—in the Miloš Forman film &quot;Hair&quot;, based on the 1967 musical. Writing for the &quot;Sioux City Journal&quot;, critic Bob Thomas called it &quot;a rare flight of creative imagination that widens the dimensions of the movie musical&quot; and believed that Williams&#x27; performance &quot;could not be better&quot;. In her mixed review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;As his name might indicate, Treat Williams is one of the better things &quot;Hair&quot; has to offer … [he is] is the only one of the players who really suggests the spirit of euphoria upon which the original [stage production] meant to capitalize&quot;. Williams&#x27; performance earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. His second film appearance of 1979 was the poorly reviewed Steven Spielberg war comedy &quot;1941&quot;, in which he played Corporal Chuck Sitarski.

=== 1980s roles ===

Throughout the next decade, Williams appeared in a variety of supporting and leading film roles, such as the adventure drama &quot;The Pursuit of D. B. Cooper&quot; (1981), in which he played the titular aircraft hijacker; the Sergio Leone crime epic &quot;Once Upon A Time In America&quot; (1984); action-thriller &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (1984); Peter Medak&#x27;s &quot;The Men&#x27;s Club&quot; (1986); and the cult horror-comedy &quot;Dead Heat&quot; (1988). His portrayal of Daniel Ciello—in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s 1981 neo-noir crime drama &quot;Prince of the City&quot;—brought Williams his second Golden Globe nomination and some of the strongest reviews of his career, with Roger Ebert saying of his &quot;demanding and gruelling&quot; performance, &quot;Williams is almost always onscreen, and almost always in situations of extreme stress, fatigue, and emotional turmoil. We see him coming apart before our eyes&quot;. In a retrospective review of the film published by &quot;Empire&quot; in 2000, Simon Braud wrote:

Williams starred as Stanley Kowalski in the 1984 television adaptation of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, earning his third Golden Globe nomination, and was nominated for the 1985 Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead for his portrayal of Arnold Friend in that year&#x27;s &quot;Smooth Talk&quot;. In her review of &quot;Talk&quot; for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley wrote, &quot;The [film&#x27;s] mood grows progressively darker as Treat Williams, playing a trashy dreamboat, drives up in his LeMans convertible … Matching Dern in her stunning performance, Williams is in his best role since &quot;Prince of the City&quot;&quot;.

=== 1990s–2006: Film, theatre, and &quot;Everwood&quot; ===

Between 1993 and 1994, Williams starred as cynical divorce attorney Jack Harold on the CBS sitcom &quot;Good Advice&quot;, which ran for two seasons and was unfavorably reviewed by critics, though some were complimentary of Williams&#x27; performance. His film credits throughout the mid-late 1990s included &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (1995), &quot;Mulholland Falls&quot; (1996), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; (1997), cult action-horror &quot;Deep Rising&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; (1999). In 1996, he co-starred in the big-budget comic book adaptation &quot;The Phantom&quot;, with his character—villainous Xander Drax—trying his utmost to take over the world and kill the titular superhero. The film received mixed reviews, but many critics were impressed by the visuals and performances. Writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert said he found the film &quot;smashingly entertaining&quot;, adding, &quot;Williams [is] implacably evil … and also slick and oily in the best pulp tradition&quot;. That same year, his &quot;messianic&quot; work in &quot;The Late Shift&quot;, an HBO television film in which he portrayed real-life talent agent Michael Ovitz, was roundly praised by critics and earned him an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor.

In 1998, Williams starred as Karl Thomasson, an ally of the previous film&#x27;s protagonist, in the straight-to-video action film &quot;The Substitute 2: School&#x27;s Out&quot;. He continued the role with &quot;The Substitute 3: Winner Takes All&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Substitute: Failure Is Not an Option&quot; (2001). He returned to the stage in 1999, earning critical acclaim for his work as Portuguese fisherman Manuel in the off-Broadway production of &quot;Captains Courageous, the Musical&quot;. Next, he appeared as Buddy in the Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; (April–July 2001), and co-starred in the Woody Allen-directed satire &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; (2002), with Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling his portrayal of film studio boss Hal Jaeger &quot;frightening and impressive&quot;. His next major film role was that of egotistical FBI boss Walter Collins in the big-budget action comedy &quot;Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous&quot; (2005).

Between 2002 and 2006, Williams played the lead role of Dr. Andrew Brown on the WB&#x27;s &quot;Everwood&quot;, a drama series about a widowed neurosurgeon moving from New York City to Colorado with his two children. The show garnered critical acclaim and a devoted following during its four-season run, with Williams being nominated twice for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor (2003; 2004). He later said of his time on the show, &quot;I was a big fan of all the Frank Capra movies [and] I thought Greg Berlanti wrote a Capra-esque show … It was just so full of love and good people and surprises and dealing with real life stuff that hadn&#x27;t been dealt with on the networks before … I have extraordinarily warm feelings about it … I&#x27;m glad other people are discovering it because I think it&#x27;s probably the best television series I was ever on&quot;. Between July and November 2006, he made several appearances on the first season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, playing David Morton, a friend and potential suitor of protagonist Nora Walker.

=== 2007–2023: Final years ===
In 2007, Williams starred as Nathaniel Grant in the short-lived TNT series &quot;Heartland&quot;, which was cancelled during its first-season run, and played real-life convicted murderer Michael Peterson in the Lifetime movie &quot;The Staircase Murders&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; Laura Fries found his performance in the latter to be &quot;effectively enigmatic&quot;. His film credits during this time included Pupi Avati&#x27;s &quot;The Hideout&quot; (2007), romantic comedy &quot;What Happens in Vegas&quot; (2008), independent drama &quot;Howl&quot; (2010), and Danny Boyle&#x27;s Oscar-nominated biographical drama &quot;127 Hours&quot; (2010), in which he played the father of canyon climber Aron Ralston.

In 2010, Williams authored the children&#x27;s book &quot;Air Show!&quot;, which was published by Disney-Hyperion. Aimed at ages 6–9, it documents an air show with text and illustrations. Williams told &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; that the idea for the book came about after attending an air show with his children and seeing the excitement it brought them, especially his daughter: &quot;In the book, [the character] Ellie is the more knowledgeable of the two children, with a real desire to fly ... When I was a kid, books about airplanes were considered &#x27;boy&#x27; books. I thought it would be wonderful to empower a little girl with this love of flight&quot;.

Williams went on to appear in numerous feature films between 2012 and 2021, including &quot;Deadfall&quot; (2012), Brazilian drama &quot;Reaching for the Moon&quot; (2013), Andrew Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot&quot; (2014), romantic comedy &quot;Second Act&quot; (2018), &quot;Drunk Parents&quot; (2019), action thriller &quot;Run Hide Fight&quot; (2020), and the sports drama &quot;12 Mighty Orphans&quot; (2021), in which he portrayed Amon G. Carter. Additionally, his performance in the 2018 drama &quot;The Etruscan Smile&quot;—an adaptation of José Luis Sampedro&#x27;s novel—was met with praise, with Frank Scheck of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; believing that he brought &quot;admirable gravitas&quot; to his role as wealthy patriarch Frank Barron. He also appeared in various television films during this period, such as the acclaimed political thriller &quot;Confirmation&quot; (2016), playing U.S. senator Ted Kennedy; Hallmark&#x27;s &quot;The Christmas House&quot; (2020), which drew attention for being the channel&#x27;s first Christmas film to feature a same-sex couple; and the award-winning Netflix musical comedy &quot;Christmas on the Square&quot; (2020).

Williams played the principal role of Mick O&#x27;Brien on the Hallmark series &quot;Chesapeake Shores&quot; from 2016 until its final episode, which aired in October 2022. His other television appearances during the 2010s–2020s included recurring roles on &quot;White Collar&quot; (2012–2013) as Samuel Phelps; &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; (2013–2018) as Benny Severide; and &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; (2016–2023) as Lenny Ross, the former police partner of character Frank Reagan. At the time of his death in June 2023, Williams had completed filming the role of Bill Paley—co-founder of CBS—in &quot;&quot;, the second season of anthology series &quot;Feud&quot;. Created by Ryan Murphy for FX, the show premiered in January 2024 to positive reviews, with &quot;Vulture&quot;″s Jackson McHenry noting, &quot;Treat Williams, in his last filmed performance [is] both warm and brutally chauvinistic — by far the best work in the show&quot;. In July 2024, it was revealed that Williams had received a posthumous Emmy Award nomination for the role.

== Accolades ==
His portrayal of Dr. &quot;Andy&quot; Brown on the WB&#x27;s &quot;Everwood&quot; (2002–2006) earned him two nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance in a Drama Series (2003, 2004). Over his career he earned additional nominations for Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, and Independent Spirit Awards. Williams received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a TV Film for his portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1984) and two nominations for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor for playing Michael Ovitz in &quot;The Late Shift&quot; (1996) and Bill Paley in &quot;&quot; (2024).

==Personal life ==
Williams lived in Park City, Utah, and Manchester Center, Vermont, with his wife, actress and producer Pam Van Sant (m. 1988), and their two children, Gill and Ellie.

In 1969, Williams&#x27; high school football coach, who was also a flight instructor, offered to train him in a Piper PA-18 Super Cub. At age 21, Williams became a private aircraft pilot. He later became an FAA instrument-rated commercial pilot with ratings in both single engine and multi-engine airplanes, as well as rotorcraft. He held a type rating for Cessna Citation jets. He was certified as a flight instructor. Williams owned a Piper J-3 Cub, Piper Cherokee 28-180, Piper Seneca II, and a Piper Navajo Chieftain, which was used for family travel between homes.

Williams learned to scuba dive in 1982 along with then-girlfriend Dana Delany while they spent time on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. They both became PADI certified divers.

=== Addiction issues ===
Williams was open about his struggles with drug addiction during the 1980s, which he believed hampered his career at a time when he was being called an &quot;up-and-coming Pacino or De Niro&quot;. Speaking in 1995, he said: &quot;[My film career] was stopped by my lack of focus and use of cocaine. I mean, I wanted to party more than I wanted to focus on my work … You don&#x27;t realize, unfortunately, until later on how fleeting fame and power in Hollywood are … I screwed it up, and I think you have to be true about these things to move on. Otherwise you&#x27;ve always got that little skeleton&quot;. He added: &quot;I think in a way your life goes where it needs to go, and maybe I needed [to] go through what I went through to grow up so I could be the actor that I&#x27;m really meant to be — the clear-headed guy that I want to be in my work and not somebody who&#x27;s living life in the fast lane&quot;.

==Death==
On June 12, 2023, Williams was involved in a motorcycle crash on Route 30, in Dorset, VT. According to the Vermont State Police, a 2008 Honda Element in the southbound lane turned into the path of Williams&#x27;s motorcycle in the northbound lane, and Williams was unable to avoid colliding with it. He was airlifted to Albany Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at the age of 71. The cause of death was &quot;severe trauma and blood loss,&quot; according to medical examiner. Williams was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.

On March 8, 2024, 35-year-old Ryan Koss, the driver of the car that hit Williams, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of negligent driving resulting in death. Sentencing was deferred for a year, and Koss was required to undergo mental health counseling and a restorative justice program. Koss knew Williams and had called his wife after the crash.

== Tributes ==
In September 2023, Williams received a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award at the Boston Film Festival during recognition of the film &quot;American Outlaws&quot; (2023), in which he appeared. On March 1, 2024, &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; dedicated its latest episode at that time, &quot;Fear No Evil&quot;, to Williams. At the end of the fourth episode—&quot;It&#x27;s Impossible&quot;—of &quot;&quot; (2024), a title card paid tribute to Williams&#x27; life.

On April 24, 2024, Williams&#x27; family announced a memorial event celebrating the life and work of Treat Williams at the Southern Vermont Arts Center (SVAC) in Manchester, Vermont on June 9.

<text>The history of the Slavic languages stretches over 3000 years, from the point at which the ancestral Proto-Balto-Slavic language broke up (c. 1500 BC) into the modern-day Slavic languages which are today natively spoken in Eastern, Central and Southeastern Europe as well as parts of North Asia and Central Asia. 

The first 2000 years or so consist of the pre-Slavic era: a long, stable period of gradual development during which the language remained unified, with no discernible dialectal differences. 

The last stage in which the language remained without internal differences can be dated to around 500 AD and is sometimes termed &quot;Proto-Slavic proper&quot; or &quot;Early Proto-Slavic&quot;. Following this is the Common Slavic period (c. 500–1000 AD), during which the first dialectal differences appeared but the entire Slavic-speaking area continued to function as a single language, with sound changes tending to spread throughout the entire area. 

By around 1000 AD, the area had broken up into separate East Slavic, West Slavic and South Slavic languages, and in the following centuries, i.e. 11–14th century, it broke up further into the various modern Slavic languages, of which the following are extant: Belarusian, Russian, Rusyn and Ukrainian in the East; Czech, Slovak, Polish, Kashubian and the Sorbian languages in the West, and Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian and Slovene in the South.

The period from the early centuries AD to the end of the Common Slavic period around 1000 AD was a time of rapid change, concurrent with the explosive growth of the Slavic-speaking era. By the end of this period, most of the features of the modern Slavic languages had been established. 

The first historical documentation of the Slavic languages is found in isolated names and words in Greek documents starting in the 6th century AD, when Slavic-speaking tribes first came in contact with the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire.

The first continuous texts date from the late 9th century AD and were written in Old Church Slavonic—the first Slavic literary language, based on the South Slavic dialects spoken around Thessaloniki in Greek Macedonia—as part of the Christianization of the Slavs by Saints Cyril and Methodius and their followers. Because these texts were written during the Common Slavic period, the language they document is close to the ancestral Proto-Slavic language and is critically important to the linguistic reconstruction of Slavic-language history.

This article covers the development of the Slavic languages from the end of the Common Slavic period (c. 1000 AD) to the present time. See the article on Proto-Slavic for a description of the Proto-Slavic language of the late first millennium AD, and history of Proto-Slavic for the earlier linguistic history of this language.

== Origin ==

The development into Proto-Slavic probably occurred along the southern periphery of the Proto-Balto-Slavic continuum. This is concluded from Slavic hydronyms, the most archaic of which are found between the northeastern rim of the Carpathian mountains in the west, along the middle Dnieper, the Pripet, and the upper Dniester river in the east.

From around 500 BCE to 200 CE, the Scythians and then the Sarmatians expanded their control into the forest steppe. Consequently, a few Eastern Iranian loan words, especially relating to religious and cultural practices, have been seen as evidence of cultural influences. Subsequently, loan words of Germanic origin also appear. This is connected to the movement of east Germanic groups into the Vistula basin, and subsequently to the middle Dnieper basin, associated with the appearance of the Przeworsk and Chernyakhov cultures, respectively.

Into the Common Era, the various Balto-Slavic dialects formed a dialect continuum stretching from the Vistula to the Don and Oka basins, and from the Baltic and upper Volga to southern Russia and northern Ukraine. Beginning around 500 CE, the Slavic speakers rapidly expanded in all directions from a homeland in eastern Poland and western Ukraine. By the eighth century CE, Proto-Slavic is believed to have been spoken uniformly from Thessaloniki to Novgorod.

==Notation==
See Proto-Balto-Slavic language#Notation for much more detail on the uses of the most commonly encountered diacritics for indicating prosody (&quot;á, à, â, ã, ȁ, a̋, ā, ă&quot;) and various other phonetic distinctions (&quot;ą, ẹ, ė, š, ś&quot;, etc.) in different Balto-Slavic languages.

===Vowel notation===
Two different and conflicting systems for denoting vowels are commonly in use in Indo-European and Balto-Slavic linguistics on the one hand, and Slavic linguistics on the other. In the first, vowel length is consistently distinguished with a macron above the letter, while in the latter it is not clearly indicated. The following table explains these differences:

For consistency, all discussions of sounds up to (but not including) Middle Common Slavic use the common Balto-Slavic notation of vowels, while discussions of Middle and Late Common Slavic (the phonology and grammar sections) and later dialects use the Slavic notation.

===Other vowel and consonant diacritics===
Other marks used within Balto-Slavic and Slavic linguistics are:
* The haček on consonants (&quot;č š ž&quot;), indicating a &quot;hushing&quot; quality , as in English &quot;kitchen, mission, vision&quot;.
* Various strongly palatal or palatalized consonants (a more &quot;hissing&quot; quality) usually indicated by an acute accent (&quot;ć ǵ ḱ ĺ ń ŕ ś ź&quot;) or a haček (&quot;ď ľ ň ř ť&quot;).
* The ogonek (&quot;ą ę ǫ&quot;), indicating vowel nasalization (in modern standard Lithuanian this is historic only).

===Prosodic notation===
For Middle and Late Common Slavic, the following marks are used to indicate prosodic distinctions, based on the standard notation in Serbo-Croatian:
*Long rising (&quot;á&quot;): This indicates the Balto-Slavic acute accent in Middle Common Slavic only.
*Short rising (&quot;à&quot;): This indicates the Balto-Slavic acute accent in Late Common Slavic, where it was shortened.
*Long falling (&quot;ȃ&quot;): This normally indicates the Balto-Slavic circumflex accent. In Late Common Slavic, it also indicates originally short (falling) accent that was lengthened in monosyllables. This secondary circumflex occurs only on the short vowels &quot;e, o, ь, ъ&quot; in an open syllable (i.e. when not forming part of a liquid diphthong).
*Short falling (&quot;ȁ&quot;): This indicates the Balto-Slavic short accent. In Late Common Slavic, this accent was lengthened in monosyllables (see preceding entry).
*Neoacute (&quot;ã&quot;): This indicates the Late Common Slavic neoacute accent, which was pronounced as a rising accent, usually long but short when occurring on some syllable types in certain languages. This results from retraction of the accent, i.e. the Middle Common Slavic accent fell on the following syllable (usually specifically a weak yer).

===Other prosodic diacritics===
There are multiple competing systems used to indicate prosody in different Balto-Slavic languages (see Proto-Balto-Slavic language#Notation for more details). The most important for this article are:
# Three-way system of Proto-Slavic, Proto-Balto-Slavic, modern Lithuanian: Acute tone (&quot;á&quot;) vs. circumflex tone (&quot;ȃ&quot; or &quot;ã&quot;) vs. short accent (&quot;à&quot;).
# Four-way Serbo-Croatian system, also used in Slovene and often in Slavic reconstructions: long rising (&quot;á&quot;), short rising (&quot;à&quot;), long falling (&quot;ȃ&quot;), short falling (&quot;ȁ&quot;). In the Chakavian dialect and other archaic dialects, the long rising accent is notated with a tilde (&quot;ã&quot;), indicating its normal origin in the Late Common Slavic neoacute accent (see above).
# Length only, as in Czech and Slovak: long (&quot;á&quot;) vs. short (&quot;a&quot;).
# Stress only, as in Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian: stressed (&quot;á&quot;) vs. unstressed (&quot;a&quot;).

==Dialectal differentiation==
The breakup of Common Slavic was gradual and many sound changes (such as the second regressive palatalization) still propagated throughout what must have been by then a dialect continuum. However, several changes were more restricted, or had different outcomes.

The end of the Common Slavic period occurred with the loss of the yers (weak high vowels, derived from Proto-Balto-Slavic and ultimately Proto-Indo-European *i and *u). This ended the era of &quot;syllabic synharmony&quot; (when most, originally all, syllables were open) by creating large numbers of closed syllables. The conditions for which yers were strong and which ones weak is the same across most or all Slavic languages, but the particular outcomes are drastically different.

The clusters *tl and *dl were lost in all but West Slavic, being normally simplified to *l. Exceptions are some Northern Russian dialects where they instead changed to *kl and *gl respectively (today only traces of this remain) and the Gail Valley dialect of Slovene (with traces in other Carinthian dialects).

For many Common Slavic dialects—including most of West Slavic, all but the northernmost portions of East Slavic, and some western parts of South Slavic—Proto-Slavic lenited from a voiced velar plosive to a voiced velar fricative ( → ). This remains in some modern languages: for example, Czech , Belarusian , Ukrainian , which developed from Proto-Slavic . Because this change was not universal and because it did not occur for a number of East Slavic dialects (such as Belarusian and South Russian) until after the application of Havlík&#x27;s law, calls into question early projections of this change and postulates three independent instigations of lenition, dating the earliest to before 900 CE and the latest to the early thirteenth century.

=== Overview of languages ===

The Slavic languages are generally divided into East Slavic, South Slavic and West Slavic. For most comparative purposes, however, South Slavic does not function as a unit. Bulgarian and Macedonian, while quite similar to each other, are radically different from the other South Slavic languages in phonology and grammar. The phonology of Bulgarian and Macedonian is similar to East Slavic rather than their nearest Slavic neighbor Serbo-Croatian (suggesting an early East–West divide across the whole Slavic territory, before South Slavic was separated from the rest of the Slavic languages by the spread of Hungarian and Romanian). In grammar, Bulgarian and Macedonian have developed distinctly from all other Slavic languages, eliminating nearly all case distinctions (strongly preserved elsewhere), but preserving and even strengthening the older Indo-European aspectual system consisting of synthetic aorist and imperfect tenses (largely eliminated elsewhere in favor of the new Slavic aspectual system).

Old Church Slavonic (OCS) data are especially important for the reconstruction of Late Common Slavic (LCS). The major exception is LCS accent, which can only be reconstructed from modern Slavic dialects.

=== Palatalization ===
At least six separate sound changes involving palatalization can be identified in the history of the Slavic languages:
#Satemization, which converted Proto-Indo-European (PIE) front velars *ḱ, *ǵ, *ǵh into Balto-Slavic *ś, *ź, *ź, and further into Slavic *s, *z, *z.
#The first regressive palatalization of velars.
#The second regressive palatalization of velars.
#The progressive palatalization of velars.
#Iotation, which palatalized all consonants before *j.
#General palatalization of all consonants before front vowels (not in all languages).

The first palatalization (satemization) is reflected in all Balto-Slavic languages, while the rest are represented in nearly all Slavic languages. (The Old Novgorod dialect did not undergo the second regressive palatalization, and underwent the progressive palatalization only partly.)

==== Velar palatalization outcomes ====
The outcome of the first regressive palatalization is uniform across all Slavic languages, showing that it happened fairly early. The outcome of the second regressive palatalization shows more variety. It is possible, however, that this is a later development. Many authors reconstruct a uniform outcome *ś, which only later resolves into or . (According to Aleksandar Belić, the phonetic character of the palatalizations was uniform throughout Common Slavic and West Slavic languages developed later on by analogy.) In all dialects (except for Lechitic), was deaffricated to , but is still found in a few of the earlier Old Church Slavonic texts, where it is represented by the special letter Dze (Ѕ).

The following table illustrates the differences between the different dialects as far as phonetic realization of the three velar palatalizations:

Some dialects (in particular South Slavic), allowed the second regressive palatalization to occur across an intervening . For example, Early Common Slavic &quot;star&quot;, which developed into Middle-Late Common Slavic :
* palatalized:
** Russian: 
** Slovene: 
** Serbo-Croatian: / 
** Bulgarian: 
** Macedonian: 
* unpalatalized:
** Polish: 
** Czech: 

==== Iotation outcomes ====

The outcomes of most cases of iotation are the same in all Slavic languages; for the chart of outcomes, see Iotation#Sound change.

The phonemes *ť (from earlier *tj and *gt/kt) and *ď (from earlier *dj) generally merged into various other phonemes in the various Slavic languages, but they merged with different ones in each, showing that this was still a separate phoneme in Proto-Slavic. Compare:

The exact pronunciation of *ť and *ď in Proto-Slavic is unclear, but they may have sounded as geminate palatal stops and .

The OCS and Bulgarian outcome is somewhat unusual as it is not an affricate but rather a fricative followed by a stop, having undergone metathesis. In Macedonian, the outcome is non-sibilant.

In Proto-Slavic, iotated *ľ *ň *ř contrasted with non-iotated *l *n *r, including before front vowels. This distinction was still apparent in Old Church Slavonic, although they aren&#x27;t always consistently marked (least for *ř, which may have already been merging with *r&#x27; at the time the Old Church Slavonic manuscripts were written or copied). In Southwest Slavic (modern Serbo-Croatian and Slovene), this contrast remains to this day. In the other Slavic variants, however, regular *l *n *r developed palatalised variants before front vowels, and these merged with the existing iotated *ľ *ň *ř.

==== General palatalization ====
In most languages (but not Serbo-Croatian or Slovene), a general palatalization of consonants before front vowels (including the front yer ь), as well as of *r in *ьr, occurred at the end of the Common Slavic period, shortly before the loss of weak yers. The loss of the weak yers made these sounds phonemic, nearly doubling the number of phonemes present. The already palatal or palatalized sounds — the outcomes of the velar palatalizations and iotation — were unchanged. Newly palatalized sounds *l&#x27; *n&#x27; *r&#x27; merged with palatal *ľ *ň *ř from iotation. However, newly palatalized *t&#x27; *d&#x27; *s&#x27; *z&#x27; did not usually merge with existing *ť *ď (from iotation) or *č *š *(d)ž (from the first palatalization of velars).

The new sounds were later depalatalized to varying degrees in all Slavic languages, merging back into the corresponding non-palatal sound. This has happened the least in Russian and Polish: before another consonant, except for l&#x27;, which was always preserved, as in сколько &quot;skol&#x27;ko&quot; &quot;how many&quot;, and dentals before labials, as in тьма &quot;t&#x27;ma&quot; / ćma &quot;darkness&quot;, and before a pause for labials. r&#x27; was depalatalized early before dentals, as in чёрт &quot;čort&quot; / czart &quot;devil&quot;, but otherwise has been preserved in Polish and in many Russian dialects, as well as for some older standard speakers, who pronounce верх as &quot;ver&#x27;h&quot; (cf. Polish wierzch). In many cases palatalization was analogically restored later, particularly in Russian. Russian has also introduced an unusual four-way distinction between non-palatal &quot;C&quot;, palatal &quot;C&#x27;,&quot; the sequence &quot;C&#x27;j&quot; of palatal + (from Common Slavic *Cьj with weak ь), and the sequence &quot;Cj&quot; of non-palatal + (only across a clear morpheme boundary, when a prefix is followed by a morpheme-initial ); however, only dentals show a clear contrast before &quot;j&quot;.

Czech underwent a general depalatalization in the 13th century. It might be argued that Czech never underwent palatalization at all in most cases, but the Czech sound &quot;ř&quot; (an unusual fricative trill) is found everywhere that *r followed by a front vowel is reconstructed in Late Common Slavic. This suggests that former *r&#x27; escaped depalatalization because it had evolved into a new sound — no longer paired with a corresponding non-palatal sound — by the time that depalatalization occurred.

The same thing happened more broadly in Polish — paired palatalized sounds occur only before vowels, but original *r&#x27; *l&#x27; *t&#x27; *d&#x27; *s&#x27; *z&#x27; are reflected differently from *r *l *t *d *s *z even word-finally and before consonants, because all six pairs had diverged by the time any depalatalization occurred. *r&#x27; evolved as in Czech, later becoming , but still written &quot;rz&quot;. *t&#x27; *d&#x27; *s&#x27; *z&#x27; evolved into alveolopalatal consonants; and in the case of *l&#x27;, non-palatal *l evolved into a back velar and then further into , still written &quot;ł&quot;.

In Bulgarian, distinctively palatalized consonants are found only before . Velars are allophonically palatalized before front vowels in standard Bulgarian; the same thing happens to all consonants in Eastern Bulgarian.

Palatalization triggered a general merger of Common Slavic *y and *i. In East Slavic and Polish, the two sounds became allophones, with occurring after non-palatal sounds and after palatal or palatalized sounds. In Czech, Slovak and South Slavic, the two sounds merged entirely (although in Czech, *i triggered palatalization of &quot;t d n&quot; prior to the merger, and in Slovak, it triggered palatalization of &quot;t d n l&quot;).

Researchers differ in whether the paired palatalized consonants should be analyzed as separate phonemes. Almost all analyses of Russian posit phonemic palatalized consonants due to their occurrence word-finally and before consonants, and due to the phonemic distinction between and . In Polish and Bulgarian, however, many researchers treat some or all paired palatalized consonants as underlying sequences of non-palatal consonant + . Researchers who do this in Polish also generally treat the sounds and as separate phonemes.

===The yers ь and ъ===

====Strong vs. weak yers====
The two vowels ь and ъ, known as (front and back) &quot;yer&quot;, were originally pronounced as short high vowels. During the late Proto-Slavic period, a pattern emerged in these vowels which characterised a yer as either &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak&quot;. This change is known as Havlík&#x27;s law. A yer at the end of a word, or preceding a strong yer or non-yer vowel was weak, and a yer followed by a weak yer became strong. The pattern created sequences of alternating strong and weak yers within each word: in a sequence of yers, every odd yer encountered was weak, every even yer was strong.

The name *sъmolьnьskъ (the Russian city of Smolensk) is shown here as an example, with strong yers in bold and weak yers in &quot;italics&quot;.

* Nominative singular: *s&quot;ъ&quot;mol&quot;ь&quot;nьsk&quot;ъ&quot;
* Genitive singular: *s&quot;ъ&quot;molьn&quot;ь&quot;ska

During the time immediately following the Common Slavic period, weak yers were gradually deleted. A deleted front yer ь often left palatalization of the preceding consonant as a trace. Strong yers underwent lowering and became mid vowels, but the outcomes differ somewhat across the various Slavic languages. Slovene in particular retains a distinct outcome that did not merge with any other vowels, albeit originally only in unstressed syllables, and Bulgarian has an outcome that merged only with nasal ǫ.

Compare:

* An apostrophe indicates palatalization of the preceding consonant.
* The front and back strong yers merged in Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Czech and Upper and Lower Sorbian.
* In Slovene, arose from this merged result when stressed, otherwise. was later often replaced by analogically.
* In Central (standard) Slovak, the normal outcomes of *ь *ъ are &quot;e o&quot;, but various other sounds often appear, unpredictably. In East and West Slovak dialects, both yers merge and become &quot;e&quot;, as in Czech.

====Examples====

====Clusters and fill vowels====
Deletion of weak yers created many new closed syllables as well as many of the unusual consonant clusters that characterize the Slavic languages today. Many cases of &quot;spurious vowels&quot; also appeared because a yer had been weak in one form of a word but strong in another, causing it to disappear in some forms of the word but not others. For example, the word for &quot;dog&quot; was *pьs&quot;ъ&quot; in the nominative singular, but *p&quot;ь&quot;sa in the genitive singular, with differing patterns of strong and weak yers. Following the deletion of weak yers and lowering of strong yers, this resulted in nominative Czech &quot;pes&quot;, Polish &quot;pies&quot;, Serbo-Croatian &quot;pas&quot;, but genitive &quot;psa&quot; (in all three).

In some cases, however, deletion of weak yers would lead to an awkward consonant cluster such as word-initial &quot;rt-&quot;, &quot;ln-&quot; or &quot;mx-&quot; (as in the example of *mъxъ &quot;moss&quot; above), with a sonorant consonant on the outside of the cluster, a violation of the principle of rising sonority. These clusters were handled in various ways:
*Allow them to exist unchanged. This happened especially in Russian and Polish.
*Convert the weak yer into a strong one, thereby breaking up the consonant cluster. This happened most consistently in Serbo-Croatian.
*Convert the sonorant into a syllabic sonorant. This happened with initial &quot;r&quot; in Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian.
*Insert a prothetic vowel before the cluster. This happened in some dialects of Belarusian, e.g. &quot;lënu ~ l&#x27;nu ~ il&#x27;nú&quot; &quot;flax (gen. sg.)&quot; (Common Slavic *lьnu).

A similar problem occurred with awkward word-final clusters such as &quot;-tr&quot;, &quot;-gn&quot; or &quot;-sm&quot;. These originated from words like *větrъ &quot;wind&quot; or *ognь &quot;fire&quot;, where the cluster occurred syllable-initially and there was no sonority violation. Again various outcomes are found in different languages, largely parallel to the above outcomes for word-initial clusters. In this case, when a cluster needed to be broken up, a strong yer was inserted as a &quot;fill vowel&quot; between the two consonants.

====Tense yers====
Yers before are known as &quot;tense yers&quot; and were handled specially. In languages other than Russian, they were sometimes raised, with *ьj *ъj becoming *ij *yj regardless of position. In Russian, the opposite sometimes happened, with *ij *yj sometimes lowering to *ьj *ъj, subsequently evolving normally as strong or weak yers. In languages other than Russian, resulting sequences of *ijV or *yjV may contract to a single vowel (especially in Czech). The outcomes are not consistent and depend on various factors. For example, *ъj in long adjectives becomes contracted &quot;í&quot; in Czech, but stressed &quot;oj&quot;, unstressed &quot;yj&quot; (&quot;ăj&quot; in the old literary pronunciation and some dialects) in Russian.

In Russian, when the yer in *ьj was weak, the result was a sequence of palatal consonant + , which remained distinct from regular palatal consonants. In other languages, either the sequence compressed into a single palatal consonant or the palatal consonant was depalatalized. E.g. from Common Slavic *ustьje &quot;estuary&quot;, when the yer was treated as weak the result is Russian &quot;úst&#x27;e&quot; , Polish &quot;ujście&quot; , Slovene &quot;ûstje&quot;; when treated as strong, the result is Czech &quot;ústí&quot; (with contraction of *ije), Bulgarian &quot;ústie&quot; .

===The liquid diphthongs===

Proto-Slavic had eliminated most diphthongs creating either long monophthongs or nasal vowels. But it still possessed sequences of a short vowel followed by *l or *r and another consonant, the so-called &quot;liquid diphthongs&quot;. These sequences went counter to the law of open syllables and were eliminated by the end of the Proto-Slavic period, but differently in each dialect.

====Mid vowels====
The situation for the mid vowels *e and *o is relatively straightforward. The South Slavic dialects used metathesis: the liquid and vowel switched places, and the vowels were lengthened to *ě and *a respectively. The East Slavic languages instead underwent a process known as pleophony: a copy of the vowel before the liquid consonant was inserted after it. However, *el became *olo rather than *ele. The situation in West Slavic is more mixed. Czech and Slovak follow the South Slavic pattern and have metathesis with lengthening. Polish and Sorbian underwent metathesis but without any lengthening, and the northwestern Lechitic languages (Pomeranian, Slovincian and Polabian) retained *or without any metathesis at all.

#The variants &quot;le/lja, re/rja&quot; in Bulgarian, and &quot;lije/le/li, rije/re/ri&quot; in Serbo-Croatian, are dialectal differences.
#The variants &quot;oli, ori&quot; in Ukrainian are due to a sound change &quot;*ō&quot; &gt; , where &quot;*o&quot; was lengthened before a lost yer under certain accentual conditions.

====High vowels====
The evolution of the liquid diphthongs with high vowels in the various daughter languages is more diverse. In some West Slavic and South Slavic languages, syllabic sonorants appear, and in others (e.g. Polish), either vowel-consonant or consonant-vowel sequences appear depending on the context, which is most easily derived by assuming an earlier stage with syllabic sonorants (with the former occurrence of ь or ъ transferred into palatalization or lack thereof). East Slavic, however, consistently has vowel-consonant sequences with &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot; as the vowel, which can be easily derived by assuming that the liquid diphthongs continued unchanged until the changes involving yers (assuming that the yers in these sequences were always treated as if strong).

As a result, there is a divergence of opinion, with some scholars assuming that the high-vowel liquid diphthongs evolved into syllabic sonorants early in the Common Slavic period (even before the metathesis of the mid-vowel liquid diphthongs), while others assume that the change to syllabic sonorants was one of the last changes in the Common Slavic period and did not occur at all in many languages (e.g. East Slavic).

Old Church Slavonic writes these as *lь, *lъ, *rь, *rъ, as if metathesis had occurred. However, various internal evidence indicates that these behaved differently from original Proto-Slavic *lь, *lъ, *rь, *rъ, and hence were probably actually pronounced as syllabic sonorants. (This is also consistent with evidence from later languages.) In the manuscripts, only a single vowel is found in this position, usually *ъ but also consistently *ь in a few manuscripts. This appears to indicate that the palatal(ized) syllabic sonorants had merged into the non-palatal ones.

The syllabic sonorants are retained unchanged in Czech and Slovak. In Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, syllabic r is retained but an epenthetic vowel was inserted before syllabic l. Bulgarian inserted an epenthetic ǎ before both. Serbo-Croatian also underwent l-vocalization.

East Slavic reflects original *ьr and *ъr as &quot;er&quot; and &quot;or&quot; respectively, but merges *ьl and *ъl as &quot;ol&quot; (Proto-Slavic *&quot;vьlna&quot; &gt; East Slavic &gt; Russian &quot;волна&quot;), similarly to the merger of *el and *ol as &quot;olo&quot;. &quot;L&quot;-vocalization later occurred in Belarusian and Ukrainian: for example, Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &gt; Old East Slavic &gt; Ukrainian , Belarusian .

===The nasal vowels ę and ǫ===

Nasal vowels were initially retained in most Slavic dialects, but soon underwent further changes. Nasality is preserved in modern Polish, as well as in some peripheral dialects of Slovene (e.g. the Carinthian dialect group) and Bulgarian/Macedonian (e.g. around Thessaloniki and Kastoria). In other Slavic languages, however, the nasal vowels lost their nasality and merged with other vowels. The outcomes are as follows:

# Long and short nasal vowels developed primarily from accentual differences. The neoacute accent always produced long vowels, but the outcome of the other accents (circumflex and old acute) depended on the dialect. See above for more details.
# The two outcomes listed in Czech occurred in hard and soft environments, respectively. &quot;Hard environment&quot; means preceding a hard (neither palatal nor palatalized) alveolar consonant. 
# In Slovak, short *ę &gt; &quot;ä&quot; after labials, else &quot;a&quot;.
# In Polish, original *ę and *ǫ can only be distinguished because the former palatalized the preceding consonant.
# The two outcomes listed in Macedonian occurred in initial and non-initial environments, respectively.

===The yat vowel ě===

The phonetic realization of *ě was also subject to phonetic variation across different dialects. In Early Proto-Slavic, *ě was originally distinguished from *e primarily by length. Later on, it appears that initially it was lowered to a low-front vowel and then diphthongized to something like . This is still reflected as &quot;ia&quot; or &quot;ja&quot; (i.e. with palatalization of the previous consonant) in certain contexts before hard consonants in Bulgarian and Polish; but in most areas it was raised to . This generally proceeded further in one of three directions:
#Remain as a diphthong.
#Simplify to .
#Simplify to .
All three possibilities are found as variants within the Serbo-Croatian area, respectively known as the ijekavian, ekavian and ikavian dialects. An ijekavian dialect served as the basis of almost all the literary Serbo-Croatian forms (all except literary Serbian as used specifically within Serbia itself, which is ekavian). These dialects have short &quot;je&quot;, long &quot;ije&quot; (often pronounced as ). The ijekavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian are in fact the only Slavic languages that consistently preserve a reflex of *ě distinct from all other Common Slavic sounds. (Elsewhere, at most only some cases of *ě, e.g. those in stressed syllables, have a distinct reflex.)

In cases where the reflex has remained as a diphthong, it has most commonly developed to , often followed by merger of the with a previous consonant to form a palatal or palatalized consonant. In Czech, for example, the reflex of *ě is sometimes still spelled &quot;ě&quot;, but this in fact indicates after labials, and after &quot;t d n&quot;, which become pronounced as palatal sounds ; in other cases the reflex is simply &quot;e&quot;.

In Old Russian, the reflex of *ě simplified to , but this did not cause a merger with *e in stressed syllables, which was pronounced . Later, this (also including reflexes of the strong front yer) changed into (i.e. with palatalization of the preceding consonant) when not followed by a palatalized consonant: cf. modern Russian лёд &#x27;ice&#x27; (loans from Church Slavonic do not display this change: небо &quot;sky&quot;, крест &quot;cross&quot;, перст &quot;finger&quot; in elevated style). The result of the sound change may be expressed in the present-day spelling by means of a diaeresis over the letter &quot;e&quot; (&quot;ё&quot;), but generally isn&#x27;t. In contrast, the sound change did not affect the reflex of original &quot;yat&quot;, which continued to be pronounced as , eventually merging with the surviving unaffected instances of as late as the 1700s (seen, respectively, in the words хлеб &#x27;bread&#x27; and печь &#x27;oven&#x27;). Original &quot;yat&quot; continued to be represented distinctly from resulting from other sources in spelling until the spelling reforms of 1918, and is still distinguished in some Northern Russian dialects.

Similarly, in Ukrainian, the reflex of *ě simplified to &quot;i&quot; , but this did not cause a merger with either *e or *i in stressed syllables, because both sounds developed to a phoneme &quot;y&quot; . (However, in some instances, former *o is also reflected as &quot;i&quot;.)

The following table shows the development of *ě in various languages:

*Bulgarian (apart from the Western Bulgarian dialects) has &quot;ja&quot; only when stressed and before a (formerly) hard consonant, &quot;e&quot; otherwise (e.g. *tělo &quot;body&quot; produces singular тя́ло &quot;tjálo&quot; and plural тела́ &quot;telá&quot;).
*Macedonian (and the Western Bulgarian dialects) has only &quot;e&quot;. The reflex between the Bulgarian and Macedonian versions forms an important isogloss known as the jat&#x27; border, running approximately from Nikopol on the Danube to Solun (Thessaloniki) on the Aegean Sea.
*Serbo-Croatian shows great dialectal diversity; see above.
*Polish has &quot;ia&quot; before a (formerly) hard dental, &quot;ie&quot; otherwise.
*Some Northern Russian dialects have *ě &gt; &quot;i&quot;, as in Ukrainian.
*Some Ukrainian dialects, as well as some Northern Russian sub-dialects, preserve an earlier form .
*Slovak has short &quot;e&quot;, long &quot;ie&quot;.

===Accent===

====Modern prosodic phenomena====
The modern Slavic languages differ greatly in the occurrence of the prosodic phenomena of phonemic vowel length, accent and tone, all of which existed in Common Slavic (CS), ranging from total preservation (Serbo-Croatian) to total loss (Polish). However, the surface occurrence of length, accent and/or tone in a given language does not necessarily correspond with the extent to which the corresponding CS phenomena can be reconstructed. For example, although all of the standard Serbo-Croatian literary forms have phonemic tone, they cannot be used to reconstruct Late CS tone; only some of the non-standard dialects (e.g. Chakavian) are useful in this regard. Similarly, although Macedonian has (marginal) phonemic accent, this does not continue the CS accent position. Contrariwise, although modern Polish lacks vowel length, some vowel quality differences (e.g. in nasal vowels) reflect former length differences.

Phonemic tone is found only in western South Slavic languages — Serbo-Croatian and some Slovene dialects (including one of the two literary standards). Phonemic length is found in Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Czech and Slovak. Phonemic accent is found in Serbo-Croatian, the East Slavic languages, Bulgarian, the northern Kashubian dialects, marginally in Slovene, and even more marginally in Macedonian.

In terms of which modern languages preserve which CS prosodic features, it is important to understand that length, tone and accent are intricately tied together. Middle CS did not have phonemic length, and Late CS length evolved largely from certain tonal and accentual changes. (In addition, some long vowels evolved from contraction of vowels across or compensatory lengthening before a lost yer, especially in Czech and Slovak.) Hence length distinctions in some languages (e.g. Czech) may correspond to tonal distinctions in other languages (e.g. Serbo-Croatian).

====Development from Common Slavic====
As mentioned above, Middle Common Slavic (MCS) had a three-way tonal/length distinction on accented syllables (long rising, long falling, short). Long rising and falling tones continue Balto-Slavic acute and circumflex, respectively. Late Common Slavic (LCS) developed at first a four-way distinction, where rising and falling tones could occur in both short and long syllables, as in modern Serbo-Croatian. Later changes of a complex nature produced the prosodic phenomena found in the various modern languages.

In general, the history of Slavic accentuation is extremely complex and still incompletely understood. The following is a summary of the most important changes in LCS:
#Short-accented syllables develop into specifically short falling syllables.
#Long rising (acute) syllables are shortened, becoming short rising.
#The accent is retracted (moved a syllable towards the beginning) in certain cases, e.g. when it fell on a weak yer (Ivšić&#x27;s law). The new syllables developed a rising accent, termed the &quot;neoacute&quot;. When this accent fell on short *e and *o, they were lengthened, except in Serbo-Croatian and Slovene. At this stage, most neoacute syllables remained separate from original acute syllables because of the difference in length (long vs. short, respectively).
#Initial short falling syllables followed by a final weak yer (i.e. words which will be monosyllabic upon loss of the yer and which in MCS had a short accent on the initial syllable) are lengthened. Such syllables become long falling (although this doesn&#x27;t cause a merger with original long falling syllables because the two differ in vowel quality, i.e. *e *o *ь *ъ vs. other qualities). This is hypothesized to be pan-Slavic, but only visible in Serbo-Croatian and Slovene because of the following step.
#Long falling syllables are shortened everywhere except in Serbo-Croatian and Slovene. This undoes the previous step (if it occurred at all) and is responsible for MCS circumflex accent appearing as a short vowel in Czech, Slovak, Old Polish, etc.
#Compensatory lengthening of some short syllables occurs in some languages when immediately followed by a weak yer. This does not occur in South Slavic, nor in Russian. It is most common in words that will become monosyllabic after the loss of the yer. In Ukrainian, it is general in this position, while in Czech and Polish it is common but inconsistent. It results in a Czech and Polish pattern in masculine nouns in which long vowels in the nominative singular alternate with short vowels in the other case/number forms. This pattern is then often analogically extended to other words.
#Weak yers are lost.
#Short rising syllables (arising mostly from MCS acute accent) are relengthened in East Slavic, Bulgarian and Macedonian. It also occurs in Czech and Slovene in the initial syllable of disyllabic words, under certain conditions. This causes a general merger of MCS acute and neoacute in the East Slavic and eastern South Slavic languages, leading to a two-way distinction of short falling vs. long rising. (This distinction is later lost, but revealed in some traces; see below.)

Note that steps 3, 4 and 6 can all be viewed as types of compensatory lengthening before a lost (or about-to-be-lost) yer.

Numerous further developments occur in individual languages. Some of the most notable ones are:
*In East Slavic, Bulgarian and Macedonian, the pitch accent is converted into a stress accent (as in English), and vowel length and tone are lost. Traces of these distinctions exist in a few circumstances:
**Vowel length in early borrowings of Slavic words, e.g. into Finnish.
**The position of the accent in original liquid diphthongs in East Slavic, when the vowel of the diphthong was &quot;o&quot; or &quot;e&quot;. Such sequences develop into bisyllabic sequences with &quot;-oro-&quot;, &quot;-ere-&quot; or &quot;-olo-&quot;. A short falling accent (MCS circumflex) is reflected as &quot;-óro-&quot; etc., while a long rising accent (MCS acute and LCS neoacute) produces &quot;-oró-&quot; etc.
**Words with a short falling vowel (MCS circumflex) tend to lose the accent to attached prefixes or clitics (e.g. the definite article added onto the end of Bulgarian and Macedonian words).
**In East Slavic, stressed long *ō was raised to (notated &quot;ô&quot;), while all other *o remained as . This is still reflected in some Northern Russian dialects.
*In some dialects of Macedonian, stress occurring on suffixes is moved onto the stem, but may otherwise appear on any syllable, while in others, including standard Macedonian, lexical stress accent is lost and replaced with fixed stress.
*Phonemic tone and accent are lost in West Slavic (although some dialects of the Kashubian language maintain phonemic stress accent). Phonemic length is eventually lost in Polish, although still present in Old Polish. In Polish, some former long/short pairs have evolved to different sounds; e.g. *ō &gt; &quot;ó&quot; . Similarly, nasal &quot;ę&quot; reflects a former short nasal, while &quot;ą&quot; reflects a long nasal. (The two original nasals *ę and *ǫ merged in Polish.)
*In the original eastern Serbo-Croatian dialects, phonemic tone is lost, with all accented syllables essentially gaining a falling tone. Later on, in a subset of these dialects (the neoshtokavian dialects, the basis of all standard Serbo-Croatian registers), the stress is retracted one syllable when possible, producing a rising tone in the process (cf. the neoacute retraction). This reintroduces phonemic tone on initial syllables.

Only some conservative Serbo-Croatian dialects (e.g. Chakavian) maintain the original accentual system unchanged. Some Slovene dialects (see below) maintain all original properties of the accentual system, but with various changes in multisyllabic words.

Slovene shows large dialectal diversity for its relatively small area of distribution. For example, only the central dialects and one of the two literary standards maintain tone, and some of the northwest dialects maintain original nasality. In the dialects maintaining tone, the prosody of monosyllables agrees closely with the most conservative Serbo-Croatian dialects (e.g. Chakavian). In multisyllabic words, all non-final stressed vowels were lengthened (acute and neoacute becoming long rising, while circumflex and original short become long falling), and all non-final unstressed vowels were shortened, which produced a prosodic pattern not unlike that found in modern Italian. Length remained distinctive in final syllables only. But prior to this, various shifts happened:
*Original acute became circumflex (long falling) in certain cases, e.g. prior to a lengthened syllable (the &quot;neo-circumflex&quot;).
*With non-final original circumflex and short syllables, the accent shifts to the right, becoming circumflex (long falling) (the &quot;progressive shift&quot;).
*With non-initial original acute, or with any original final-accented syllable in a multisyllabic word, the accent shifts left onto original long syllables, becoming acute (long rising).
*In some dialects, a further leftward shift happens from original final-accented syllables to original short syllables. In the standard language, this happens specifically with *e *o, which become acute (long rising) with a low-mid quality (whereas other long mid vowels are normally reflected as high-mid). In some non-standard dialects, this also happens with *ǝ &lt; strong yers (although it remains short).

In West Slavic, esp. in Czech, a number of originally short vowels in monosyllables are lengthened. The conditions for this lengthening are incompletely understood and seem to involve good deal of analogy and dialect mixing.

Note that the overall effect of all these changes is that either the MCS acute, MCS circumflex or both have ended up shortened in various languages in various circumstances, while the LCS neoacute has generally remained long.

Example:

== Loanwords ==
The lexical stock of the Slavic languages also includes a number of loanwords from the languages of various tribes and peoples that the Proto-Slavic speakers came into contact with. These include mostly Indo-European speakers, chiefly Germanic (Gothic and Old High German), speakers of Vulgar Latin or some early Romance dialects, Middle Greek and, to a much lesser extent, Eastern Iranian (mostly pertaining to religious sphere) and Celtic.

Many terms of Greco-Roman cultural provenience have been diffused into Slavic by Gothic mediation, and analysis has shown that Germanic borrowings into Slavic show at least 4 distinct chronological strata, and must have entered Proto-Slavic in a long period.

Of non-Indo-European languages, possible connections have been made to various Turkic and Avar, but their reconstruction is very unreliable due to the scarcity of the evidence and the relatively late attestation of both Slavic and Turkic languages. When the Turkic tribal union of Volga Bulgars and Khazars conquered territories in the Ukrainian steppe belt between the 6th and 8th centuries AD, it is possible that such Turkisms as &quot;kahan&quot; &#x27;kagan, ruler&#x27;, &quot;bahatyr&quot; &#x27;hero&#x27;, and &quot;ban&quot; &#x27;high rank&#x27; and the suffix &quot;-čij&quot; found their way into the Common Slavic language.

<doc id="1211684" wikidata="Q891364" url="?curid=1211684" title="Constitution of Venezuela">
<text>The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ( (CRBV)) is the current and twenty-sixth constitution of Venezuela. It was drafted in mid-1999 by a constituent assembly that had been created by popular referendum. Adopted in December 1999, it replaced the 1961 Constitution, the longest-serving in Venezuelan history. It was primarily promoted by then President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez and thereafter received strong backing from diverse sectors, including figures involved in promulgating the 1961 constitution such as Luis Miquilena and Carlos Andrés Pérez. Chávez and his followers (&quot;chavistas&quot;) refer to the 1999 document as the &quot;Constitución Bolivariana&quot; (the &quot;Bolivarian Constitution&quot;) because they assert that it is ideologically descended from the thinking and political philosophy of Simón Bolívar and Bolivarianism.

The Constitution of 1999 was the first constitution approved by popular referendum in Venezuelan history, and summarily inaugurated the so-called &quot;Fifth Republic of Venezuela&quot; due to the socioeconomic changes foretold in its pages, as well as the official change in Venezuela&#x27;s name from the &quot;República de Venezuela&quot; (&quot;Republic of Venezuela&quot;) to the &quot;República Bolivariana de Venezuela&quot; (&quot;Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela&quot;). Major changes are made to the structure of Venezuela&#x27;s government and responsibilities, while a much greater number of human rights are enshrined in the document as guaranteed to all Venezuelansincluding free education up to tertiary level, free health care, access to a clean environment, right of minorities (especially indigenous peoples) to uphold their own traditional cultures, religions, and languages, among others. The 1999 Constitution, with 350 articles, is among the world&#x27;s longest, most complicated, and most comprehensive constitutions.

One of the outstanding differences between Venezuelan and most of the other constitutions of the Americas is the lack of the possibility of impeachment of the president by the national parliament. Instead, the president can be removed from office either by citizens through a recall referendum or by decision of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.

==Origins==

===Conceptualization===
President Hugo Chávez was first elected under the provisions of the 1961 Constitution in the presidential election of 6 December 1998. Chávez had been contemplating a constitutional convention for Venezuela as an ideal means to rapidly bring about sweeping and radical social change to Venezuela beginning from the eve of his 1992 coup attempt.

After his imprisonment and release, he began to seek a political career with such a convention as its political goal. In the buildup to the 1998 presidential elections, one of Chávez&#x27;s promises was to organise a referendum asking the people if they wanted to convene a National Constituent Assembly. His very first decree as president was to order a referendum, which took place on 19 April. The electorate were asked two questionswhether a constituent assembly should be convened, and whether it should follow the mechanisms proposed by the president. 92% of voters approved calling a constituent assembly and 86% approved the electoral system suggested by Chávez.

===Election of the Constituent assembly===

Elections were then held, on 25 July, to elect 131 deputies to the Constituent Assembly, which convened and debated proposals during the remainder of 1999. Members of Chávez&#x27;s MVR and allied parties formed the &quot;Polo Patriotico&quot; (&quot;Patriotic Axis&quot;). The alliance went on to win 121 of the 131 seats in the Constituent assembly.

===The &quot;judicial emergency committee&quot;===
Conflict soon arose between the Constituent assembly and the older institutions it was supposed to reform or replace. During his 1998 presidential campaign, and in advance of the 25 July elections to the Assembly, Chávez had maintained that the new body would immediately have precedence over the existing Congress and the courts, including the power to dissolve them if it so chose.
Against this, some of his opponents, including notably the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Cecilia Sosa Gomez, argued that the Constituent assembly must remain subordinate to the existing institutions until the constitution it produced had been ratified.

In mid August 1999, the Constituent assembly moved to restructure the nation&#x27;s judiciary, claiming the power to fire judges, seeking to expedite the investigations of corruption outstanding against what &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated were nearly half of the nation&#x27;s 4700 judges, clerks, and bailiffs.
On 23 August, the Supreme Court voted 8–6 that the Assembly was not acting unconstitutionally in assuming those powers; however, the next day Cecilia Sosa Gomez resigned in protest. Over 190 judges were eventually suspended on charges of corruption.

On 25 August, the Constituent assembly declared a &quot;legislative emergency,&quot; voting to limit the Congress&#x27;s work to matters such as supervising the budget and communications. In response, the Congress, which in July had decided to go into recess until October to avoid conflict with the Constituent assembly, declared its recess over, effective 27 August.

At one point the Constituent assembly prohibited the Congress from holding meetings of any sort. However, on 10 September, the two bodies reached an agreement allowing for their &quot;coexistence&quot; until the new constitution took effect.

===Framing of the new constitution===
Afterward, over the span of a mere 60 days in late 1999, the new and voter-approved Constituent assembly would frame and found a document that enshrined as constitutional law most of the structural changes Chávez desired. Chávez stated such changes were necessary in order to successfully and comprehensively enact his planned social justice programs. Sweeping changes in Venezuelan governmental structure were to be made; Chávez&#x27;s plan was, stemming from his 1998 campaign pledges, thus to dramatically open up Venezuelan political discourse to independent and third parties by radically altering the national political context. In the process, Chávez sought to fatally paralyse his AD and COPEI opposition. All Chávez&#x27;s aims were, in one move, dramatically furthered.

===Ratification by popular referendum===

This new 1999 constitution was presented to the national electorate on 15 December 1999 and approved with a 72% &quot;yes&quot; vote (audited by the National Electoral Council). The new constitution then legally came into full effect the following 20 December.

==Text and guiding doctrines==
The text of the constitution is a hybrid of jurisprudential and political norms drawn from sources as wide as Simón Bolívar&#x27;s writings on constitutionality and popular sovereignty, José Martí, the Peruvian Marxist José Carlos Mariátegui, and Evgeny Pashukanis. While it retains a strong liberal-democratic base, it introduces elements of direct democracy such as elements of popular sovereignty ( consultative or recall referendums), social responsibilities, right to rebel against the violation of the constitutional system (articles 333 and 350) and the independence of the republic from foreign domination. Besides these elements, separation of powers (albeit with two new branches of government) and rights of property, expression and strike were mainly kept the same as on the previous constitution.

==Innovations of the new constitution==

The Constituent assembly itself drafted the new 1999 Venezuelan constitution. With 350 articles, the document was, as drafted, one of the world&#x27;s lengthiest constitutions.

===Name of the state===
Despite the initial reluctance of the constituent assembly&#x27;s deputies, it changed the country&#x27;s official name from the &quot;Republic of Venezuela&quot; to the &quot;Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela&quot;.

===Five branches of government===
Significant changes were made to the separation of powers. Instead of the usual three branches of government, the new Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has five (Article 136):
# The executive branch (the Presidency).
# The legislative branch (the National Assembly).
# The judicial branch (the judiciary).
# The electoral branch (&quot;poder electoral&quot;, or &quot;electoral power&quot;).
# The citizens&#x27; branch (&quot;poder ciudadano&quot;, or &quot;citizens&#x27; power&quot;).
The electoral branch is headed by the National Electoral Council (CNE) and is responsible for the independent oversight of all elections in the country, municipal, state, and federal. The citizens&#x27; branch is constituted by the &quot;(defensor del pueblo)&quot; (ombudsman or &quot;defender of the people&quot;), the Chief Public Prosecutor &quot;(fiscal general)&quot;, and the comptroller general &quot;(contralor general)&quot;. It is responsible for representing and defending the citizens in their dealings with powers of the Venezuelan state. The legislative branch was changed from a bicameral system to a unicameral system.

===A strengthened and recallable presidency and the creation of a functioning vice-presidency ===

It also increased the presidential term of office from five to six years, subject to a limit of two terms. The document also introduced provisions for national presidential recall referendumsthat is, Venezuelan voters now were to be given the right to remove their president from office before the expiration of the presidential term. Such referendums were to be activated upon provision of petitions with a valid number of signatures. The new provision was activated for the first time when such a referendum was held in 2004, but it failed to receive majority support. See 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum. The Presidency was also strengthened, aside from being the Chief Executive, head of state and head of government, with the power to dissolve the National Assembly under certain conditions, and can issue decrees that has the force of law, upon authorization by the National Assembly.

In 2009, term limits (not only that for president) were abolished by a referendum.

And a post of vice-president was recreated to direct the day-to-day operations of the government and to exercise duties and powers that may delegated by the President as well as to act as the chief operating officer of government. He or she can be removed via impeachment by the National Assembly. The vice-president is also politically responsible to the National Assembly side by side with the ministers of Cabinet. Upon the vacancy of the office of the president upon death, recall, resignation or impeachment by the STJ, the vice president thus assumes the office and title of the presidency.

===Unicameral and weakened legislature===
The new constitution also converted the formerly bicameral Congress into a unicameral legislature, and stripped it of many of its former powers. Thus, the new single-chamber National Assembly dropped the prior traditional arrangement of the bifurcation of legislative powers between a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate. In addition, the legislative branch&#x27;s powers were substantially reduced and transferred to the President of Venezuela.

===The Public Defender===
Provision was also made for a new position, the Public Defender (&quot;Defensoría del Pueblo&quot;), which was to be an ombudsman office with the authority to check the activities of the presidency, the National Assembly, and the constitutionChávez styled such a defender as the guardian of the so-called &#x27;moral branch&#x27; of the Venezuelan government, tasked with defending public and moral interests.

This is an idea derived from Bolivar&#x27;s constitutionalism.

===Public examination for judicial candidates===
Lastly, the Venezuelan judiciary was reformed. Judges would, under the new constitution, be installed after passing public examinations and not, as in the old manner, be appointed by the National Assembly.

====Health care====
As Articles 83–85 under Title III of the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution enshrine free and quality healthcare as a human right guaranteed to all Venezuelan citizens, the Hugo Chávez administration attempted to fulfill its constitutional obligations via the &quot;Barrio Adentro&quot; program. Notably, Article 84 under Title III mandate that the healthcare furnished through such public programmes as &quot;Barrio Adentro&quot; be publicly funded, and explicitly forbids privatization under any circumstance. The relevant text from the 1999 Bolivarian Constitution reads:

Article 83: Health is a fundamental social right and the responsibility of the State, which shall guarantee it as part of the right to life. The State shall promote and develop policies oriented toward improving the quality of life, common welfare and access to services. All persons have the right to protection of health, as well as the duty to participate actively in the furtherance and protection of the same, and to comply with such health and hygiene measures as may be established by law, and in accordance with international conventions and treaties signed and ratified by the Republic.
Article 84: In order to guarantee the right to health, the State creates, exercises guidance over and administers a national public health system that crosses sector boundaries, and is decentralized and participatory in nature, integrated with the social security system and governed by the principles of gratuity, universality, completeness, fairness, social integration and solidarity. The public health system gives priority to promoting health and preventing disease, guaranteeing prompt treatment and quality rehabilitation. Public health assets and services are the property of the State and shall not be privatized. The organized community has the right and duty to participate in the making- of decisions concerning policy planning, implementation and control at public health institutions.
Article 85: Financing of the public health system is the responsibility of the State, which shall integrate the revenue resources, mandatory Social Security contributions and any other sources of financing provided for by law. The State guarantees a health budget such as to make possible the attainment of health policy objectives. In coordination with universities and research centers, a national professional and technical training policy and a national industry to produce health care supplies shall be promoted and developed. The State shall regulate both public and private health care institutions.
===Changes to businesses===
Article 308 of Title VI the Venezuelan constitution showed a changed view on businesses. This article sought to introduce support for alternative management of businesses. Mentioned in the article are cooperatives, family-owned businesses, small businesses and savings funds. The government supported these alternatives as a way to democratize capital and challenge oligopolistic control of the economy.

==Amendments==

Amendments proposed by President Chávez and parliament were twice decided in referendums:
*2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum – wide-ranging amendments were very narrowly rejected;
*2009 Venezuelan constitutional referendum – abolition of term limits for various public offices (including President; a proposal to abolish Chávez&#x27;s term limits was present also in 2007 amendments) was narrowly approved.

<text>The Socialist Republic of Macedonia (), or SR Macedonia, commonly referred to as Socialist Macedonia, Yugoslav Macedonia or simply Macedonia, was one of the six constituent republics of the post-World War II Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and a nation state of the Macedonians. After the transition of the political system to parliamentary democracy in 1990, the Republic changed its official name to Republic of Macedonia in 1991, and with the beginning of the breakup of Yugoslavia, it declared itself an independent country and held a referendum on 8 September 1991 on which a sovereign and independent state of Macedonia, with a right to enter into any alliance with sovereign states of Yugoslavia was approved.

Geographically, SR Macedonia bordered Albania to the west, Greece to the south and Bulgaria to the east. Within Yugoslavia, it bordered SR Serbia (including SAP Kosovo) to the north. It was one of two constituent republics of Yugoslavia that were landlocked.

==Background==
The first Macedonian state was formally proclaimed under the name Democratic Federal Macedonia () at the First Plenary Session of the Anti-Fascist Assembly for the People&#x27;s Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) during World War II. It was set up clandestinely on 2 August 1944 in the Bulgarian occupation zone in Yugoslavia (in the Prohor Pčinjski Monastery, now in Serbia). This date is now celebrated in North Macedonia as the Republic Day. It was chosen intentionally, as it was the date of the Ilinden Uprising against Ottoman rule in 1903. However, after the Bulgarian Army retreated from the region under Soviet pressure, on 8 September, right-wing Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization nationalists declared a pro-German Macedonian puppet-state. In early October, under the leadership of the new Bulgarian pro-Soviet government, the Bulgarian Army re-entered Yugoslavia to block the German forces in their withdrawal from Greece. In Macedonia the Bulgarians fought side-by-side with the fighters of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Macedonia.

Vardar Banovina was &quot;de facto&quot; liberated from the Germans and their collaborationists in late November 1944, so the ASNOM became operational in December, shortly after the German retreat. Nevertheless, in December anti-communist Albanian nationalists in Western Macedonia tried to remain in control of the region after the Yugoslav Partisans announced victory. They aimed to resist incorporation of the area into communist Yugoslavia and it was only in early 1945 that the Yugoslav Partisans were able to establish their control over the mountainous area.

The nature of the new Yugoslav state remained unclear immediately after the war. Yugoslavia was envisioned by the Partisans as a &quot;Democratic Federation&quot;, including six federal states. When Tito&#x27;s nomination as Prime Minister was accepted on 29 November 1945, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was declared, with its constitution coming into force in 1946. As a result, Macedonia changed its name to the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia and was incorporated as a constituent republic in the Yugoslav Federation.

People with various degrees of allegedly being pro-Bulgarian orientation (in the most cases they were pro-Independence and anti-Yugoslav) were purged from their positions, then isolated, arrested and imprisoned on fabricated charges. In many cases they were executed en masse, such as during the Bloody Christmas of 1945. The number of victims remains unclear, many academic sources put the number at 1,200 people although according to Bulgarian estimates, the number is estimated to be around 50,000, including those executed, imprisoned, deported, subject to forced labor, etc. Some additional purges followed after the Tito–Stalin split.

The national Macedonian language was codified in 1945 and the first publishing house &quot;Prosvetno Delo&quot; was established on 16 April 1945. The state was formed on the territory of Vardar Banovina, a part of the wider geographical region of Macedonia, which was divided between several countries. Some Macedonian politicians from the Republic advocated the idea of a United Macedonia, which would include Aegean Macedonia and Pirin Macedonia. The idea was somewhat supported by the federal Yugoslav authorities on some occasions, or repressed, depending on the regional and international political situation.

Some people were against the federation and demanded greater independence from the federal authorities, leading to their persecution. One of the notable victims of these purges was the first president, Metodija Andonov-Čento. To wipe out the remnants of Bulgarophile sentiments, the Yugoslavian communists started a process of Macedonization and nation-building.

==Constitution==
:Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, 1974 – Official Gazette 

The Socialist Republic of Macedonia, which was defined as a nation-state of the Macedonians and also a state of its ethnic minorities, had some powers normally associated with an independent state. The Constitution also recognized the right of self-determination and secession. The borders of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia could only be changed by decision of the republic&#x27;s parliament. Its inhabitants held both Yugoslav citizenship and an internal Macedonian citizenship for state business.

The Socialist Republic of Macedonia had its own constitution, presidency, government, parliament, official language, state symbols, Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, &quot;Secretariat of Internal Affairs&quot; (Interior ministry), &quot;Bureau for Foreign Relations&quot; (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and other state prerogatives. Also, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia had its own Territorial Defence armed forces (Macedonian: Територијална одбрана, Teritorijalna odbrana).

===System===
The Socialist Republic of Macedonia was a one-party communist state, the ruling political party being the League of Communists of Macedonia (in Macedonian: &quot;Сојуз на Комунистите на Македонија, Sojuz na Komunistite na Makedonija&quot;, abbreviation: &quot;СКМ, SKM&quot;). Being a constituent state of Yugoslavia, a leading founder of the Non-Aligned Movement, SR Macedonia pursued a neutral foreign policy and maintained a more liberal communist system compared to other communist states. The ruling ideology was based on Titoism and Workers&#x27; self-management (Macedonian: самоуправување, samoupravuvanje).

===Minorities===
While the Macedonians were the majority and were one of the constituent nations of SFR Yugoslavia (official term: &quot;narod&quot;) the rights of the ethnic minorities (official term: &quot;narodnosti&quot;) were guaranteed by the Constitution. The official language of SR Macedonia was Macedonian, however Macedonian Albanians and Macedonian Turks had the right to use their own languages within the school system and the media. The constitution of the SR Macedonia defined the state as the national state of the ethnic Macedonians, but also as the state of Albanians and Turks.

From the start of Yugoslav rule in Macedonia, accusations surfaced that the new authorities were involved in retribution against people who did not support the formation of the new Macedonian national identity. The number of victims due to organized killings of Bulgarians is unclear. Bulgarian sources claim that thousands of people were killed after 1944 and that more than 100,000 people were put in prison under the &quot;Law for the Protection of Macedonian National Honor&quot;. In SR Macedonia the &quot;Bulgarophobia&quot; increased to the level of State ideology.

===Religion===
Although the ruling communists discouraged religion, religious freedom was allowed to a certain extent. The authorities allowed the existence of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, which proclaimed autocephaly in 1967. In 1972 the construction of the largest orthodox church &quot;St. Clement of Ohrid&quot; in the capital of Skopje began. Muslims, Catholics, Protestants and other religious communities also could maintain their own organisations and places of worship.

===Geography===
The Socialist Republic of Macedonia was the 4th largest constituent country of SFR Yugoslavia both by area and population. Within Yugoslavia, it had an internal border with the Socialist Republic of Serbia to the north and its subunit the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo to the northwest, and had international borders with the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania to the west, Greece to the south, and the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria to the east.

==Transition==
In 1990 the form of government peacefully changed from socialist state to parliamentary democracy. The first pluralist elections were held on 11 November the same year. The once ruling communist party took a reformist direction and renamed itself &quot;League of Communists of Macedonia – Party for Democratic Change&quot; led by Petar Gošev. After the head of the last communist presidency Vladimir Mitkov resigned, Kiro Gligorov became the first democratically elected president of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia on 31 January 1991.

On 16 April, parliament adopted a constitutional amendment removing &quot;Socialist&quot; from the official name of the entity, and on 7 June the new name Republic of Macedonia was officially established. After the process of dissolution of Yugoslavia began, the Republic of Macedonia issued a Sovereignty Declaration on 25 January 1991 and later proclaimed itself a fully independent country, following a referendum held on 8 September 1991. 

The Republic of North Macedonia is the legal successor to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. It was known as the Republic of Macedonia until February 2019 when it underwent an official name change following the Prespa agreement with Greece in June 2018 which resolved a long-standing naming dispute.

<text>The Honourable Justice James Burrows Thomas (born 12 March 1935) was a judge on the Supreme Court of Queensland (1998–2002), which is the highest ranking court in the Australian State of Queensland.

==Personal==
James Burrows Thomas was born on 12 March 1935 to Joseph Thomas and Norma Thomas (née Burrows). Thomas brought an unusually broad knowledge of life into his judicial career commencing his education at a public school and being a former builder&#x27;s labourer.

He went to school at Windsor State School from 1940 to 1948.

While at high school at age 16 he commenced work as a builder&#x27;s labourer and continued that work 2 months each year for six years.

After completing high school he continued his education at the Church of England Grammar School (1949–1952), and finally at the University of Queensland (1953–1958) where he obtained his BA and LLB. He married Joan Martin on 22 February 1963, has one daughter and three sons.

==Legal career==
Thomas was admitted to Queensland Bar 1958. He began his career in private practice in 1959, and continued until practicing until 1982 when he became a judge. He was the Director of Barristers&#x27; Chambers Ltd from 1967 to 1976. He was on the Barristers&#x27; Board from 1973 through 1982. He became a QC in 1976.

Thomas was appointed as a Puisne Judge on 18 February 1982 and served until 29 July 1998. On 30 July 1998 he was appointed to the Court of Appeal Division where he stayed until his retirement. His work included decisions in Criminal Law. His expertise in that arena would later be relied upon after his retirement. Work as a Supreme Court Judge appealed to his intellect as he enjoys solving puzzles and described his work as a Judge as &quot;being paid to do puzzles that I enjoy doing&quot;.

He retired in 2002 citing the fact that he was an outdoor person and the desire to retire early enough to &quot;get a life while he still has one&quot;.

Thomas was a member of the Litigation Reform Commission from 1992 until 1997. In 1993 he submitted a paper on jury reform.

In 2007 the Queensland DPP reportedly relied upon his Criminal Law expertise in seeking his advice before making a decision regarding evidence in the Chris Hurley case.

<doc id="1211691" wikidata="Q4676422" url="?curid=1211691" title="Acropolis Now">
<text>Acropolis Now was an Australian television sitcom set in a fictional Greek cafe, called the &quot;Acropolis Cafe&quot; in Melbourne that ran for 63 episodes broadcast from 9 August 1989 to 4 November 1992 on the Seven Network. It was created by Nick Giannopoulos, George Kapiniaris and Simon Palomares, who also starred in the series. They were already quite well known for their comedy stage show, &quot;Wogs out of Work&quot;. The title is a nameplay on the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Each episode was 20 minutes in length and filmed in front of a live audience.

==Synopsis==
Jim&#x27;s (Giannopoulos) father asks him to run the family business, the Acropolis café, when he suddenly leaves Australia to return to his homeland Greece. The series centres on the activities of the cafe staff. Greek Jim Stefanidis, is the immature owner and his best friend, Spaniard Ricky Martinez (Palomares) is the sensible manager (seasons 1-2 only). Memo (Kapiniaris) is the traditional Greek waiter, Liz is the liberated Australian waitress. Skip is the new cook from the bush, naïve to wog culture but more accomplished in Greek cuisine than Jim, and Manolis is the stubborn, incompetent, drunk cook from the old cafe. The show&#x27;s humour arises from the clash of cultures and beliefs.

Jim&#x27;s hairdresser cousin Effie, played by Mary Coustas, became a hugely popular and enduring character during the run of the show. Coustas later reprised the role for several TV specials and series including &quot;Effie, Just Quietly&quot;, an SBS comedy/interview show, and &quot;Greeks on the Roof&quot;, a short-lived Greek-Australian version of the British television show &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot;.

==Popular culture==
Acropolis Now helped popularise the term &quot;skippy&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; to refer to Anglo-Celtic Australians and others of European but non-Mediterranean descent. This term (inspired by the iconic 60&#x27;s TV series &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot;) became popular with Mediterranean-Australians, and to a lesser extent non-Mediterranean people, especially in Melbourne.

==Production==
The program was produced by Crawford Productions which is now owned by WIN Television.

She attended the Australian National University graduating with a Bachelor of Economics in 1977 and then attended the University of Queensland graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1980. She completed a Graduate Diploma of Legal Practice at the Queensland Institute of Technology in 1983, a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in 1989 and a Master of Laws (advanced) in 1998 both at the University of Queensland. Holmes was awarded a Doctor of Laws &quot;honoris causa&quot; from The University of Queensland in 2016.

==Career==
Holmes was admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1982. In 1984 she was admitted as a barrister of the Supreme Court of Queensland and was a Foundation Member of the Women&#x27;s Legal Service in Queensland. She was a Crown Prosecutor in the Office of Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions from 1984 to 1986. In 1986 she began a law firm private practice focused on criminal and administrative law. She served as a Member of the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Tribunal from 1994 to 2000.

Holmes was appointed deputy president of the Queensland Community Corrections Board in 1997. From 1998 to 1999 she served as the counsel assisting the Forde Commission of Inquiry into Child Abuse. In 1999 she was appointed senior counsel and was made acting judge on the District Court of Queensland.

On 16 March 2000 Holmes was appointed as a judge on the Supreme Court of Queensland. From 2004 to 2006 she was a judge on the Queensland Mental Health Court. On 26 May 2006 she was appointed to the Queensland Court of Appeals of the Supreme Court of Queensland.

On 18 January 2011, it was announced that Justice Holmes would be appointed to head an inquiry into the 2011 Queensland floods. The following day the Bar Association of Queensland criticised the appointment, suggesting that it would be unconventional for a sitting judge to head an inquiry. However, Paul de Jersey, then chief justice of Queensland, defended the appointment, arguing that it was appropriate because of the apparent absence of any suggestion of political or institutional corruption. Since then, there have been several inquiries led by sitting judges, without giving rise to questions of convention.

On 7 September 2015, Holmes was announced as the new Chief Justice of Queensland, replacing Tim Carmody who resigned on 1 July.

She was sworn in on 11 September 2015, becoming the first female chief justice of the state.

Holmes was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in the 2020 Australia Day Honours for &quot;eminent service to the judiciary, notably to criminal, administrative, and mental health law, and to the community of Queensland.&quot;

Holmes has been appointed as the head of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme.

<doc id="1211703" wikidata="Q7508125" url="?curid=1211703" title="Siddharth Varadarajan">
<text>Siddharth Varadarajan (born 1965) is a journalist and editor in India. He was editor of the English language national daily &quot;The Hindu&quot; from 2011 to 2013. He is one of the founding editors of the Indian digital news portal &quot;The Wire&quot;, along with Sidharth Bhatia, and M. K. Venu.

==Early life, education and activism==
Siddharth Varadarajan was born to an IAS officer, Muthusamy Varadarajan, and Usha, a businesswoman. He did his initial schooling at La Martiniere in Lucknow and Mayo College, Ajmer.

After 1978, Varadarajan studied at the Brockley County state school in London, his father having been appointed to a position at the Indian High Commission in London. He received an undergraduate degree in economics at the London School of Economics where he was exposed to the Left-wing politics in the UK, which came to influence his journalistic career. He then studied at Columbia University. While a student at Columbia, he met his future wife, Nandini Sundar.

== Career ==

===Media===

====Times of India====
In 1995, Vardarajan returned to India to work as a journalist, before joining &quot;The Times of India&quot; as an editorial writer in 1995.

====The Hindu====
In May 2011, Varadarajan was appointed as &quot;The Hindu&quot;″s editor via an extraordinary general meeting called by the Board of Directors. He was the first editor to have been not drawn from the family of primary shareholders in its 150-year history.

On 21 October 2013, Varadarajan publicly announced his resignation from &quot;The Hindu&quot;, citing a change in policy by the owners of the newspaper to go back to being a family-run-and-edited newspaper. &quot;The Hindu&quot; on its website reported defiance of code of editorial values by Varadarajan. N. Ravi who took over as the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Hindu&quot; alleged that one of the reasons for Varadarajan&#x27;s exit was his anti-Modi bias.

During Vardarajan&#x27;s tenure as the editor, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy filed a case in Delhi&#x27;s High Court challenging his appointment as editor on the grounds that Varadarajan was not an Indian citizen, and further complained to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. The petition was ultimately denied by the Delhi High Court. Varadarajan later claimed in an interview to Tehelka that Swamy had demanded more coverage in &quot;The Hindu&quot; of his statements through an intermediary, and that the court case was a mode of exacting revenge after Vardarajan rebuffed Swami.

====The Wire====
In 2015, Varadarajan along with Sidharth Bhatia and M. K. Venu founded the non-profit online news portal called &quot;The Wire.&quot;

===Academic positions===

In 2007, Varadarajan was a visiting professor at the Graduate School of Journalism, University of California, Berkeley. In 2009, he was a Poynter Fellow at Yale University. He has also served as a senior fellow at the Center for Public Affairs and Critical Theory at Shiv Nadar University in Delhi.

===Other affiliations===
Varadarajan is a member of the International Founding Committee of The Real News, and was, until 2015, a board member of the inter-governmental B.P. Koirala India-Nepal Foundation.

Until 2015, he was also a member of the Executive Council of the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Asian Studies, and a member of the Indian Council of World Affairs. He continues as a member of the editorial board of &quot;India Quarterly: A Journal of International Affairs.&quot; and in 2019, joined the International Advisory Council of the Sydney-based Judith Neilson Institute of Journalism and Ideas.

== Reception ==

===Awards and Accolades===

In November 2005, the United Nations Correspondents Association awarded Varadarajan the Elizabeth Neuffer Memorial Prize Silver Medal for Print Journalism for a series of articles, &quot;Persian Puzzle&quot; on Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

In March 2006, he was awarded the Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Order by the President of Chile—that country&#x27;s highest civilian honor for a foreign citizen—for his contributions to journalism and to the promotion of India&#x27;s relations with Latin America and Chile.

In July 2010, he received the Ramnath Goenka award for Journalist of the Year (Print). 

He received the 2017 Shorenstein Journalism Award for outstanding reporting and for significant contributions to promoting freedom of the press in the Asia-Pacific region.

In May 2020, he is among 17 journalists from across the world recipients for the Germany based prestigious Deutsche Welle Freedom of Speech Award. The Freedom of Speech Award 2020 is for all courageous journalists worldwide who are suffering repressions because of their reporting on the pandemic.

He received a Red Ink Award in December 2022 in the politics category for articles on Pegasus spyware.

===Legal cases===

On 31 March 2020, &quot;The Wire&quot; had published a news report on a Ram Navami fair being conducted amidst the coronavirus pandemic in Uttar Pradesh. The report had misattributed a quote to the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the paragraph containing it was tweeted by Varadarajan. On the following day, the report was corrected and Varadarajan himself issued a clarification, attributing the quote to the Hindutva stalwart Acharya Paramhans. The Uttar Pradesh police registered a case against Varadarajan calling it an &quot;objectionable article&quot; and on a number of charges including promoting enmity, cheating by impersonation and creating false alarm leading to panic. The cases were filed after the correction and was followed by a tweet from Adityanath&#x27;s media advisor who claimed that the action was taken because he had apparently not apologised or deleted the tweet, along with a warning that &quot;[I]f you too are thinking of spreading lies about the Yogi government, please remove such thoughts from your mind.&quot; 

Varadarajan issued a statement to the police asking for a copy of the First Information Report (FIR) and the details of the specific actions that had been grounds for the registration of the cases, the statement was endorsed by the chairman of The Hindu Group, the editorial director of NDTV, the editor of &quot;Frontline&quot; magazine, the former editor of &quot;Jansatta&quot; daily, the consulting editor of the India Today Group and various other senior journalists. The founding editors of &quot;The Wire&quot; described the cases as a politically motivated attack on freedom of the press in India, and a condemnation against the cases was issued by a group of over 200 journalists from various media outlets who described it as &quot;brazen attempt to muzzle the media&quot;.

In January 2021, &quot;The Wire&quot; published a report which was tweeted by Varadarajan and quoted the grandfather of the farmer who had died during the farmers&#x27; protest in Delhi. In the report, the grandfather had claimed that his grandson had been shot by the police and that one of the doctors who had performed the autopsy had told him that the injuries he had sustained were caused by a bullet but was prevented from reporting it, in contradiction to the official post mortem report. The police at Rampur, Uttar Pradesh registered an FIR against Varadarajan on charges of public mischief and imputations against national integrity for publishing and tweeting the report. 

Varadarajan described it as malicious prosecution, stating that it has become a crime in the state of Uttar Pradesh to report statements of relatives of the deceased if they questioned the official narration of events. FIRs on similar grounds were also lodged against six other journalists including Vinod Jose of &quot;The Caravan&quot; which had reported on eyewitness claims that the police had shot the farmer and against the member of parliament Shashi Tharoor. The FIRs received condemnation from various media associations across the country who described it as a symptom of executive overreach.

== Personal life ==
Varadarajan is married to Nandini Sundar, a sociologist and anthropologist and Professor of Sociology at the Delhi School of Economics. His interests include Hindustan Ambassador cars, old maps and cigars. He is a citizen of the United States of America and carries an Overseas Citizenship of India. He is an atheist.

<doc id="1211712" wikidata="Q5617146" url="?curid=1211712" title="Gul Hassan Khan">
<text>Gul Hassan Khan (9 June 1921 – 10 October 1999) known secretly as &quot;George&quot;, was a Pakistani former three-star rank general and diplomat who served as the sixth and last Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, from 20 December 1971 until 3 March 1972, marking the shortest tenure in the role. Gul Hassan resigned along with Air Marshal Abdur Rahim Khan, refusing President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s request to deploy their forces to suppress a police strike protesting against the government for a pay increase.

During the meeting, Bhutto initiated the discussion by saying, &quot;Gentlemen, the country is going through one crisis after another and with the latest one being the strike by the police and for which no cooperation has been forthcoming from the army and the air force when asked for, I regret that a stage has come when we can no longer carry on like this. Therefore I am not prepared to run the government in this sort of an environment.&quot; As soon as Bhutto finished, Gul Hassan, known for his forthrightness, immediately stood up and confronted Bhutto, saying to his face, &quot;Well that&#x27;s all right Mr President but let me also make it clear that this kind of non-cooperation will continue if the demands placed on the services and especially on the army is not lawful. And as far as I am personally concerned I want to make it quite clear that I am ready to quit right now.&quot; After Gul Hassan&#x27;s statement, Bhutto wore a mischievous smile and promptly handed over two file covers to Gul Hassan and Abdur Rahim Khan. Inside were resignation letters prepared for them to sign. Gul Hassan, showing contempt, threw the file back at Bhutto, who then attempted to shake his hand. The office was renamed to Chief of Army Staff and Gul Hassan was succeeded by Tikka Khan. 

Throughout his career, he held the positions of Aide-de-camp (ADC) to Cameron Nicholson, General Viscount Slim, and Governor-General of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Directing Staff Staff College, Quetta, Commander 1 Armoured Division, Chief of General Staff, Director Military Operations, and Commander 100 Independent Armoured Brigade Group.

Notably, Gul Hassan was known for leading from the front. Once during training army officers, he wanted the artillery practice to mimic real war conditions. He had a bunker built at the target end of the Muzaffargarh range, which offered some security but was not completely safe, as a direct hit could destroy it. Despite the risk, Gul Hassan entered the bunker himself and instructed the gunners to fire with a narrow margin of error to test their training. He insisted that each artillery regiment take turns firing at the bunker to assess their skills. (Retd) Colonel EAS Bokhari writes, &quot;Luckily the units fired perfectly - and though Gen Gul was shaken in the bunker and came out of it with a lot of dust and fear of God in him - but he was quite safe. I have never seen any General Officer do this and ask for fire on a target where he himself was located.&quot;

(Retd) Colonel Abdul Qayyum recalls that Gul Hassan was &quot;short on strategic vision,&quot; &quot;but he was a field commander par excellence - by our standards, at any rate. He almost equaled Patton in linguistic matters, but he was our version of Robert E. Lee in the field. Gul Hassan was warm, sincere, forthright, without a trace of cant or deceit, wholly committed to his command, bold and generous of spirit.&quot;

==Early life==
Born in Quetta, Balochistan, into a middle-class Pashtun family on 9 June 1921, his father was the Superintendent of the Government Railway Police. Gul Hassan had three brothers and a sister, of which he was the second oldest. He has relatives still residing in Pabbi Nowshera District and in Quetta, Pakistan.

Gul Hassan survived both the 1930 earthquake in Balochistan and the devastating 1935 Quetta earthquake. In 1939, Gul Hassan joined the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College (PWRIMC). Here, he was described as an &quot;usually quite Pathan&quot; and the smartest cadet. In March 1940, he appeared for the competitive entrance examination into the Indian Military Academy (IMA) at Dehra Dun but failed, not because of his academics, but because Hassan was late to his interview which was worth 500 marks on the exam.

In January 1941, he took the exam again and received admission into the Indian Military Academy, where he would be known as an excellent Hockey player, gaining fame as a boxer.

==Personal life==
Gul Hassan was fluent in Urdu, Pashto, Punjabi, English, and Persian. He was married to a Greek woman and had one son, Sher Hassan Khan, born in 1982.

When his wife came from Vienna to see him in the hospital during his final days, he had given her 1.1 million rupees and his son a similar amount. The last 100,000 rupees he had left, he instructed his family to use for his funeral.

==British Indian Army career==
On 22 February 1942, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British Indian Army into the 9th battalion of the Frontier Force Rifles and was later transferred to the Armoured Corps.

Gul Hassan attended an Intelligence course in March 1943 at Karachi where his commandant was Lieutenant Colonel J Campbell.

===World War II===
Gul Hassan was stationed in Assam with Assam Rifles and participated in the Burma Campaign 1944–45. He recalled the stench of the dead bodies of Japanese soldiers and that he witnessed the British Indian Army burning bodies of the Japanese.

Towards the end of the war, he was appointed as the aide-de-camp to General Viscount Slim who commanded the 14th Army in Burma.

==Pakistan Army==

After the Partition of British India, Gul Hassan opted for Pakistan and served as aide-de-camp to Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

In 1950, Gul Hassan attended the Staff College, Quetta. In September 1951, he was posted to the Military Training Directorate at the GHQ (Pakistan) under director Brigadier Jerrad, who he had met in Burma.

Gul Hassan was the Directing Staff at Staff College, Quetta from 30 June 1957 to 16 June 1959.

At the outbreak of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Brigadier Gul Hassan was the Director of Military Operations in the GHQ. As a result of his actions in the war, Hassan was awarded the Sitara-e-Pakistan by President Ayub Khan. After the war, he was promoted to major general and was appointed as the General Officer Commanding of the 1st Armoured Division headquartered in Multan.

In September 1968, he was appointed as Colonel Commandant of the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers.

On 20 December 1968, Major General Gul Hassan was posted to GHQ (Pakistan) as the Chief of General Staff (CGS). He was promoted to Lieutenant General while serving in this post in 1971.

Chief of General Staff Gul Hassan acted as the Director of Exercise for an event aimed at assessing the technical skills and professional capabilities of various participating Pakistan Army units. On 30 January 1971, near Multan, C-in-C of the PAF Air Marshal Abdur Rahim Khan and President Yahya Khan arrived to observe the maneuvers.

===Role in saving Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s career===

According to A.O. Mitha, it was Gul Hassan&#x27;s lobbying at the GHQ which saved then Brigadier Zia-ul-Haq, the chief of Pakistan&#x27;s military mission, from being sacked. Brigadier Zia-ul-Haq, who was deployed to Jordan in 1971, was recommended to be court-martialed by Major General Nawazish to President Yahya Khan for disobeying GHQ orders by commanding a Jordanian armoured division against the Palestinians, as part of &quot;Operation Black September&quot; in which thousands were killed. It was Gul Hassan who interceded for Zia ultimately leading to Yahya Khan letting Zia off the hook.

===1971 war===
In 1971, Gul Hassan was the Chief of General Staff. According to several sources, Gul Hassan was unaware of Operation Searchlight and had a strong dislike for General A. A. K. Niazi. In a conversation with President Yahya Khan, Gul Hassan was informed about Niazi&#x27;s promotion and his own. Yahya Khan asked, &quot;When did you see General Abdul Hamid Khan [the Chief of Staff] last?&quot; Gul Hassan replied, &quot;I just came from his office.&quot;

Yahya continued, &quot;Didn&#x27;t he tell you that you have been promoted?&quot; Gul Hassan, puzzled, responded, &quot;No, Sir. Where am I going?&quot;

Yahya clarified, &quot;Nowhere.&quot; Confused, Gul Hassan questioned, &quot;Then why should I be promoted?&quot; Yahya explained, &quot;Because we are promoting Niazi who is junior to you. So we have had to give you the next rank.&quot;

Gul Hassan further inquired, &quot;Where is Niazi going?&quot; Yahya replied, &quot;As commander Eastern Command.&quot;

In frustration, Gul Hassan uttered an expletive. In response, President Yahya Khan remarked to Sultan Khan who was also present, &quot;This is what he (Gul) thinks of my senior officers.&quot; Additionally, Gul Hassan had assessed Niazi as having a professional &quot;ceiling no more than that of a company commander.&quot;

General Abdul Hamid Khan, as Chief of Staff, was the de facto C-in-C of the Pakistan Army as Yahya Khan was usually drunk. However, Abdul Hamid failed to fulfill his responsibilities in either role. According to Gul Hassan, Abdul Hamid had the authority but avoided taking responsibility. Abdul Hamid withheld crucial information from the GHQ, leaving them unaware of diplomatic developments and military plans. Gul Hassan adds that despite General A. A. K. Niazi&#x27;s incompetence, Abdul Hamid supported him, worsening the situation. Gul Hassan states that by September, it seemed inevitable that India would intervene in East Pakistan and Yahya Khan attempted to seek help from the United States but received no response. Similarly, Yahya reached out to China and they told him to find a political solution. Gul Hassan goes on to say that Yahya was praying that Pakistan would be rescued by angels. Gul Hassan notes that A. A. K. Niazi, oblivious to the reality, did not anticipate an Indian invasion and falsely reported normalcy in East Pakistan.

Despite warnings, Abdul Hamid failed to convey critical assessments to Yahya, who remained detached from the situation, &quot;foolishly&quot; declining a request for an urgent briefing by Gul Hassan. The army faced a dire disadvantage against India and rebels, with Yahya&#x27;s leadership lacking direction. After the war, Yahya blamed the loss of East Pakistan on &quot;the treachery of Indians&quot;, while Gul Hassan attributed the loss to Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;own blunders.&quot;

===Role in Yahya Khan&#x27;s removal===
On 17 December 1971, Brigadier F.B. Ali wrote his resignation letter accepting his own responsibility for the loss of East Pakistan and expected that President Yahya Khan and his advisors would follow suit and also resign. But the next day Ali had heard that Yahya was planning to create a new Constitution which infuriated Ali. Brigadier Ali determined that the loss of one war was enough and that it was imperative to get rid of the military junta of Yahya Khan. He picked up Brigadier Iqbal Mehdi Shah, Colonel Aleem Afridi, Colonel Agha Javed Iqbal, Lt Col Khursheed, and other officers and told them that they owed it to Pakistan to get rid of the discredited junta and hand over power to the elected civilian representatives.

All officers present, agreed. However, there was a problem as Maj Gen Bashir &quot;Ranghar&quot;, Major General R.D. Shamim, and Major General &quot;Bachoo&quot; Karim were in Gujranwala and had the authority to counter F.B. Ali&#x27;s orders.

On 19 December 1971, F.B. Ali arrested the three generals and seized command of Major General &quot;Bachoo&quot; Karim&#x27;s 6th Armoured Division. Ali then sent Colonels Aleem Afridi and Agha Javed Iqbal to deliver a letter demanding Yahya Khan&#x27;s resignation by 8 PM that night for being responsible for the loss of East Pakistan. The two Colonels took the letter to Chief of General Staff Gul Hassan, who initially felt saddened by the defeat in the war and told them that he planned to leave the army. However, upon learning about the contents of the letter from the two Colonels, Gul Hassan&#x27;s mood brightened, and he went to Air Marshal Abdur Rahim Khan. Gul Hassan told Colonel Aleem Afridi and Colonel Agha Javed Iqbal to sit in Major Javed Nasir&#x27;s office.

Earlier in the day, during an address by General Abdul Hamid Khan in Gujranwala, young officers, led by Brigadier Fazal-e-Rasiq Khan, unleashed a barrage of insults in English, Urdu, and Punjabi towards Abdul Hamid, Yahya Khan, and other superiors. They called them &quot;bloody bastards,&quot; &quot;debauches,&quot; and &quot;drunkards,&quot; expressing their deep frustration.

Abdul Hamid Khan was rushed out of the auditorium and sought advice from Major General A.O. Mitha who stated that he could deploy SSG troops to prevent a potential takeover by 6 Division but there were not enough troops. A.O. Mitha then reached out to Ali suggesting that Abdul Hamid Khan should take over from Yahya Khan. Ali refused stating that Abdul Hamid was too close to Yahya Khan and was just as responsible for the loss of East Pakistan.

Meanwhile, the reports of near mutiny in Gujranwala prompted Gul Hassan Khan and Air Marshal Abdur Rahim Khan to go to Yahya Khan, telling him to resign. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was invited by Abdur Rahim Khan and Gul Hassan Khan from Rome to assume leadership, leading to him becoming the fourth President of Pakistan.

====Hamoodur Rahman Commission====

While Gul Hassan was not part of the Bangladesh genocide, a witness mentioned him in the Hamoodur Rahman Commission report for asking soldiers how many Bengalis they had shot during his visits to East Pakistan.

===Controversy===
Despite there being no other mention of Gul Hassan&#x27;s role in the Bengali genocide, Bengali Dr. A.H. Jaffor Ullah believes Gul Hassan did play a role, though not as the main actor. While Dr. Jaffor Ullah acknowledges that Gul Hassan was not the one who directly executed orders as Lt. Gen. Tikka Khan was the trigger man, Dr. Jaffor Ullah argues that Gul Hassan provided intellectual support and leadership, contributing to the genocide&#x27;s occurrence.

==C-in-C of the Pakistan Army==

After Zulfikar Ali Bhutto arrived in Pakistan from Rome on the jet that Abdur Rahim Khan sent for him, Bhutto called Gul Hassan to take over the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, which Gul Hassan refused citing the fact that the army had been demoralized from the defeat.

However, in a meeting at the Punjab House with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Gul Hassan gave Bhutto four conditions: 1. He wanted to remain a Lieutenant General, even though the C-in-C (Pakistan Army) was traditionally a four-star General.
2. Bhutto had to organize the withdrawal of troops from the border.
3. Martial Law had to be lifted.
4. Bhutto would not meddle in the operations of the Pakistan Army.

Bhutto accepted and on 20 December 1971 in a televised address to the nation stated: 
I have asked General Gul Hassan to be acting Commander-in-Chief. He is a professional soldier. I do not think he has dabbled in politics and I think he has the respect and support of the Armed Forces... but he will retain the rank of lieutenant general. We are not going to make unnecessary promotions. We are a poor country. We are not going to unnecessarily fatten people.

The next day, Gul Hassan rang up President Bhutto and asked why he had lied that it was his decision to keep Gul Hassan as a Lt Gen, as if Gul Hassan had not chosen to remain as Lt Gen as one of his conditions for accepting the post. Bhutto responded by saying the Commander-in-Chief did not grasp politics well and missed the point. Despite Gul Hassan&#x27;s request to keep politics out of their dealings, Bhutto persisted. Days later, Bhutto asked if Gul Hassan had watched the Dhaka surrender film, inviting him to view it. Gul Hassan refused, feeling that Bhutto, now the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, was aggravating wounds instead of healing them. Gul Hassan later discovered Bhutto had brought the film from abroad and aired it on national television repeatedly until public outcry halted it.

Bhutto later wanted to join the C-in-C of the Pakistan Army on a troop tour, but Gul Hassan refused. He feared that Bhutto, as a skilled public speaker, would twist the situation to suggest Gul Hassan lacked courage. Gul Hassan believed Bhutto would win politically either way, making him appear weak or overshadow Gul Hassan&#x27;s authority.

===Resignation===
Gul Hassan and Abdur Rahim Khan refused Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s request of sending in the Pakistan Army and Pakistan Air Force to end a strike of police officers protesting for pay increase. They believed that their forces should be kept out of political matters and the civilian leadership should deal with it. Bhutto termed the police strike as a mutiny and made the two resign from their positions for not following his illegal orders. Tikka Khan and Zafar Chaudhry took over the newly created roles of Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Air Staff.

==Diplomatic career==
Khan was appointed as Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador to Austria by President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on 26 May 1972. Bhutto designated Gul Hassan as Ambassador of Pakistan to Greece in April 1975.

On 15 April 1977, in a letter of resignation, Gul Hassan condemned Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s leadership and called him a traitor for his role in the loss of East Pakistan. Gul Hassan further accused him of failing the people of Pakistan, causing chaos and violence in the country, exploiting the nation for personal gain, and rigging the 1977 Pakistani general election. Afterwards, the Government of Pakistan alongside the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) filed an FIR against Gul Hassan for &quot;hatred or contempt and inciting disaffection towards the Government.&quot;

==Later life and death==
Afterwards, Khan started a carpet business and lived a quiet life, residing in two rooms of the GHQ&#x27;s Artillery Mess. Its noted that he had not acquired wealth unlike other generals of the army. In his final years, he divided his time between Rawalpindi and Vienna, where his wife and their son lived.

In a 1997 interview with &quot;Rediff&quot;, Gul Hassan responded to a question regarding Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s assertion that her hawkish stance on India caused her to lose the election, stating: &quot;Benazir talks rubbish. She is highly immature and so was her father. One American journalist, who was writing a book on Bhutto, came and asked me, &quot;Everybody says that Bhutto was intelligent. Do you find him intelligent?&quot; I said, &quot;If he was intelligent, he would have been alive today.&quot; Who says Benazir was harsh on India?&quot;

Gul Hassan Khan died on 10 October 1999 and was buried in Pabbi in Nowshera District (Main town of Chirrat Cant, Chowki Mumriaz, Taroo Jaba, Akber Pura). Prior to his death, Gul Hassan had a small amount of money in his bank account and instructed that his burial cloth be brought with it.

<text>Tikka Khan (; 10 February 1915 – 28 March 2002) was a Pakistani military officer who served as the first chief of the army staff from 1972 to 1976. Along with Yahya Khan and Hamid Khan, he is considered a chief architect of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide that resulted in the deaths of, depending on which authority is consulted, between three hundred thousand and three million people. His leadership of the Pakistani Army actions in Bangladesh led to him being dubbed the &quot;Butcher of Bengal&quot; by Bengalis.

Gaining a commission in 1940 as an artillery officer in the British Indian Army to participate in World War II, he rose to command the 8th and 15th infantry divisions in the war with India in 1965. In 1969, he was appointed as the commander of IV Corps while acting as martial law administrator in West Pakistan under President Yahya Khan. In 1971, he took over the command of army&#x27;s Eastern Command in East Pakistan and appointed as Governor of East Pakistan where he oversaw the planning and the military deployments to execute the military operations to quell the liberation war efforts by the Awami League. 

After commanding the II Corps in the war with India in 1971, Tikka Khan was promoted to four-star rank and appointed as the first chief of army staff of the Pakistan Army in 1972. As an army chief, Tikka Khan provided support to the Pakistan nuclear programme alongside bureaucrat Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Upon retirement from the military in 1976, he was subsequently appointed as National Security Advisor by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, only to be removed in 1977 as a result of enforced martial law. In the 1980s, he remained active as a political worker of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and emerged as its leader when appointed as Governor of Punjab after the general elections held in 1988. His tenure ended when President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s government in 1990 and he was succeeded by Mian Muhammad Azhar. He retired from politics in 1990. He died on 28 March 2002 and was buried with full military honours in Westridge cemetery in Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan.

== Early life and education ==
Tikka Khan was born on 10 February 1915 into a Punjabi family of the Janjua Rajput clan in the Jochha Mamdot village of Kahuta Tehsil, Rawalpindi District, Punjab, British India (now Punjab, Pakistan).

After his education in Rawalpindi, he joined the Army Cadet College in Nowgong, Madhya Pradesh in 1933 and joined the British Indian Army as a sepoy in 1935; he gained his commission in the army from the Indian Military Academy on 22 December 1940.

During these early years, he was known to be a particularly good boxer.

== Military career ==

=== World War II ===
He participated in World War II and fought with the 2nd Field Regiment, Regiment of Artillery in Libya against the Afrika Korps led by German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in 1940. He was captured by German troops and held as a POW in Libya for more than a year. After successfully escaping, he saw military action in the Burma campaign against Japan in 1945 where he was wounded and hospitalised for some time. In 1946, he was posted in different parts of India such as Deolali, Mathura, and Kalyan.

During the same time, he served as an instructor at the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun.

=== New beginnings in Pakistan ===
After the efforts of Muslim League culminated in the partition of British India and the creation of Pakistan, Tikka Khan joined the Pakistan Army as a major in the Pakistan Army&#x27;s Regiment of Artillery in 1947. His military career progressed well and he got accelerated promotions in the army. In 1949, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He worked hard to raise the Medium Regiment in the new army. In 1950–54, he was promoted to colonel and became the deputy director at the directorate of artillery in the GHQ.

In 1955, he was promoted to brigadier. In 1962, he was promoted to major general and posted at the GHQ in Rawalpindi.

=== Between the wars: 1965–1971 ===
In 1965, Major-General Tikka Khan was the GOC of the 8th Infantry Division that was positioned in Punjab, Pakistan. At that time, the 8th Infantry Division consisted of the 51st Paratrooper Brigade and the 52nd Infantry Brigade. In April 1965, the 8th Infantry Division intruded into the Rann of Kutch. Hostilities broke out between India and Pakistan and Tikka Khan&#x27;s 8th Division fought the Indian Army in the Battle of Rann of Kutch. During the war, Tikka Khan earned a reputation as a victor of Rann of Kutch and was credited widely by the Pakistani press for the victories, he gained over the Indian Army. He made a bold stand against the Indian Army&#x27;s encirclement in the Sialkot sector in 1965. He later led the 15th Infantry Division in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965.

After President Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to his army chief General Yahya Khan in 1969, Tikka Khan was promoted to lieutenant general to command the IV Corps, stationed in Lahore. He was the martial law administrator of Punjab under President Yahya Khan who appointed him after replacing with Attiqur Rahman. His personality was well known in Pakistan as being tough and ruthless. In March 1971, Tikka Khan was sent to Dacca and left the post to Lieutenant General Bahadur Sher in March 1971.

=== Bangladesh Liberation and 1971 war ===

The situation was very complex in both West and East Pakistan after the general elections held in 1970 where the Bengali nationalist Awami League won 160 of the 162 seats in East Pakistan, whereas the leftist-socialist Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) won 81 seats out of 138 in West Pakistan. By constitutional law, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League was supposed to be the candidate for the post of Prime Minister of Pakistan but Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the Pakistan Peoples Party was not ready to accept his role as Leader of the Opposition and refused to sit in the National Assembly in this role.

Under pressure by Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party, President Yahya Khan postponed the National Assembly session despite meeting with and inviting the Awami League to form the government on 7 March. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman reacted by calling upon the Bengali people to launch an armed liberation movement against Pakistan at a mass rally. Responding to this, President Yahya Khan accepted the resignation of Lieutenant General Yaqub Khan as governor of East Pakistan and commander of the army&#x27;s Eastern Command in March 1971 and appointed Lieutenant General Tikka Khan as his successor. Tikka Khan arrived in Dacca the same month and took over the governorship. He assumed command of the Eastern Command on 7 March 1971. He has faced accusations of killing thousands of civilians.

Acting on the instructions of President Yahya Khan&#x27;s administration, Lieutenant General Tikka Khan began preparations of &quot;direct-wise military operation&quot; against the Awami League on the evening of 25 March 1971. Tikka Khan&#x27;s order to his soldiers was &quot;I want the land and not the people&quot;. Tikka Khan took assistance from loyal Bengalis and Biharis for the operation and organized a paramilitary force called Razakars. He ordered the arrest of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, outlawed the Awami League, and ordered a midnight attack on the University of Dhaka. Tikka Khan was the architect and top planner of Operation Searchlight. Thousands were killed in this operation, including academics and other members of civil society, and the country was plunged into a bloody civil war. Fatima Bhutto called him &quot;a soldier known for his eager use of force&quot;. He became notorious as the &quot;Butcher of Bengal.&quot;

In West Pakistan, domestic criticism and disapproval of Lieutenant General Tikka Khan grew to the point that President Yahya Khan replaced him with a civilian government led by a governor and a cabinet drawn from different political parties. Tikka Khan was recalled to Pakistan, relinquishing the Eastern Command to Lieutenant General Amir Khan Niazi, and given command of the II Corps based in Multan, Punjab. He commanded the II Corps during the 1971 war with India. Indian Major General D. K. Palit has questioned the wisdom of Tikka Khan&#x27;s tactics used in the Battle of Chhamb in December, citing high II Corps casualties incurred during Pakistani frontal attacks.

=== Chief of Army staff ===
In 1972, President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto removed Lieutenant General Gul Hassan Khan from his position as commander-in-chief of the army and replaced him with Tikka Khan. Tikka Khan was a highly unpopular choice in military circles for the chief of army staff because it was felt strongly that he was professionally unprepared for the assignment. |quote=General Tikka Khan was an unpopular choice as army chief, not so much because of his role in East Pakistan--the army of the day being too thick-skinned for any such delicate consideration, but because it was felt that he did not have a clue about his new job. On the other hand, Tikka Khan was steadfastly loyal to Bhutto. In 1972, he supported the militarisation of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission by supporting Munir Ahmad Khan to take over the commission&#x27;s chairmanship and the directorship of the clandestine atomic bomb programme. He was implicated in the Hamoodur Rahman Commission&#x27;s report on the 1971 war with India over East Pakistan, but much of the report remains classified.

In 1974, Tikka Khan led the counterinsurgency military operation in Balochistan and successfully crushed Baloch independence movement. In 1976, he provided his support to Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Bhutto to expand the clandestine nuclear weapons programme. The same year, Tikka Khan was preparing to retire from the military, and evaluated the eight serving lieutenant generals who were his potential successors as chief of army staff. When asked by Bhutto for his opinion on Lieutenant General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, Tikka Khan did not recommend him. Tikka Khan later remarked, &quot;I thought he was dull. In any case, he was the most junior of all the eight lieutenant generals.&quot; However Bhutto by-passed his recommendations, approved Lieutenant General Zia-ul-Haq to four-star rank, and appointed him as army chief. Upon retirement from the army, Khan joined the Pakistan Peoples Party.

== Political career ==

=== National Security Advisor to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ===

Tikka Khan was appointed National Security Advisor in 1976 by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. However, his tenure was short and ended when martial law was imposed by army chief General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977. General Zia ordered the military police to arrest both Bhutto and General Tikka Khan and placed them under house arrest. Bhutto was executed in 1979, after which General Tikka Khan emerged as one of the leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), becoming its secretary general.

=== Jail under Zia-ul-Haq ===
In 1980–88, Tikka Khan faced imprisonment numerous times for his political activities until President Zia-ul-Haq died in August 1988 in an aircraft explosion over Bahawalpur. In spite of Tikka&#x27;s leadership position within the political opposition, many of his army protégés such as Sawar Khan, Iqbal Khan and Rahimuddin Khan were promoted to four-star rank and remained on deferential terms with him. In the 1988 general election, Tikka Khan ran unsuccessfully for a seat representing Rawalpindi.

=== Governor of Punjab under Benazir Bhutto ===
He was appointed as the Governor of Punjab by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 1988. His governorship ended when President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed the government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in August 1990, after which Tikka Khan retired from active politics.

== Later life and death ==
Throughout the 1990s, he battled with illness and was hospitalised in CMH Rawalpindi for several years. He refused many television interviews on the subject of the controversial events of 1971 and died on 28 March 2002. He was survived by three sons and two daughters.

He was laid to rest with military honours in the Westridge cemetery in Rawalpindi. Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Aziz Khan attended his funeral, accompanied by the Army Chief of Staff, Chief of Air Staff, Chief of Naval Staff and other senior military and civil officials. Former prime minister and PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto paid Tikka Khan tribute in a message to his son Colonel Khalid Masud; she described the Colonel&#x27;s father as one who &quot;rose to the highest offices of this country due to his hard work and respect for the rule of law&quot;.

<text>A lens mount is an interface – mechanical and often also electrical – between a photographic camera body and a lens. It is a feature of camera systems where the body allows interchangeable lenses, most usually the rangefinder camera, single lens reflex type, single lens mirrorless type or any movie camera of 16 mm or higher gauge. Lens mounts are also used to connect optical components in instrumentation that may not involve a camera, such as the modular components used in optical laboratory prototyping which join via C-mount or T-mount elements.

== Mount types ==
A lens mount may be a screw-threaded type, a bayonet-type, or a breech-lock (friction lock) type. Modern still camera lens mounts are of the bayonet type, because the bayonet mechanism precisely aligns mechanical and electrical features between lens and body. Screw-threaded mounts are fragile and do not align the lens in a reliable rotational position, yet types such as the C-mount interface are still widely in use for other applications like video cameras and optical instrumentation.

Bayonet mounts generally have a number of tabs (often three) around the base of the lens, which fit into appropriately sized recesses in the lens mounting plate on the front of the camera. The tabs are often &quot;keyed&quot; in some way to ensure that the lens is inserted in only one orientation, often by making one tab a different size. Once inserted the lens is fastened by turning it a small amount. It is then locked in place by a spring-loaded pin, which can be operated to remove the lens.

Lens mounts of competing manufacturers (Sony, Nikon, Canon, Contax/Yashica, Pentax, etc.) are almost always incompatible. In addition to the mechanical and electrical interface variations, the flange focal distance from the lens mount to the film or sensor can also be different. Many allege that these incompatibilities are due to the desire of manufacturers to &quot;lock in&quot; consumers to their brand.

In movie cameras, the two most popular mounts in current usage on professional digital cinematography cameras are Arri&#x27;s PL-mount and Panavision&#x27;s PV-mount. The PL-Mount is used both on Arri and RED digital cinematography cameras, which are the most used cameras for films shot in digital. The Panavision mounts are exclusively used with Panavision lenses, and thus are only available on Panaflex cameras or third-party cameras &quot;Panavised&quot; by a Panavision rental house, whereas the PL-mount style is favored with most other cameras and cine lens manufacturers. Both of these mounts are held in place with locating pins and friction locking rings. Other mounts which are now largely historical or a minority in relation to current practices are listed below.

== List of lens mounts ==

For small camera modules, used in e.g. CCTV systems and machine vision, a range of metric thread mounts exists. The smallest ones can be found also in e.g. cellphones and endoscopes. The most common by far is the M12x0.5, followed by M8x0.5 and M10x0.5.
* M4.2x0.2 (1/7&quot; sensors)
* M4.6x0.25 (1/5&quot;, 2.4mm, 3.8mm sensors, industrial endoscopes)
* M5x0.35 (1/6&quot;, 1/5&quot; sensors)
* M5.5x0.35 (1.7&quot;, 1/5.8&quot;, 1/5&quot;, 1/4&quot; sensors)
* M6x0.35 (1/4&quot;, 5.2mm, 4.85mm sensors)
* M6.4x0.25 (1/3&quot; sensors)
* M7x0.35 (1.8&quot;, 1.7&quot;, 1/6&quot;, 1/5&quot;, 1/4&quot;, 1/3.6&quot;, 1/3.2&quot;, 1/2.7&quot;, 4.85mm sensors)
* M8x0.35 (1/4&quot;, 1/3&quot; sensors)
* M8x0.5 (1/5&quot;, 1/4&quot;, 1/3&quot; sensors; sometimes occurs in diode laser modules)
* M9x0.5 (1/2.7&quot;, 1/3&quot;, 1/3.2&quot; sensors; also commonly encountered in diode laser modules)
* M10x0.5 (1/4&quot;, 1/3&quot; sensors)
* M12x0.5 (the S-mount, listed in the table)
* M22x0.5 (1/1.2&quot; sensors)

==Focusing lens mount==

The axial adjustment range for focusing Ultra wide angle lenses and some Wide-angle lenses in large format cameras is usually very small.

So some manufacturers (e.g. Linhof) offered special focusing lens mounts, so-called wide-angle focusing accessories for their cameras.
With such a device, the lens could be focused precisely without moving the entire front standard.

==Secondary lens mount==

Secondary lens refers to a multi-element lens mounted either in front of a camera&#x27;s primary lens, or in between the camera body and the primary lens.

(D)SLR camera &amp; interchangeable-lens manufacturers offer lens accessories like extension tubes and secondary lenses like teleconverters, which mount in between the camera body and the primary lens, both using and providing a primary lens mount. Various lensmakers also offer optical accessories that mount in front of the lens; these may include wide-angle, telephoto, fisheye, and close-up or macro adapters.

Canon PowerShot A and Canon PowerShot G cameras have a built-in or non-interchangeable primary (zoom) lens, and Canon has &quot;conversion tube&quot; accessories available for some Canon PowerShot camera models which provide either a 52mm or 58mm &quot;accessory/filter&quot; screw thread. Canon&#x27;s close-up, wide- (WC-DC), and tele-conversion (TC-DC) lenses have 2, 3, and 4-element lenses respectively, so they are multi-element lenses and not diopter &quot;filters&quot;.

==Lens mount adapters==

Lens mount adapters are designed to attach a lens to a camera body with non-matching mounts. Generally, a lens can be easily adapted to a camera body with a smaller flange focal distance by simply adding space between the camera and the lens. When attempting to adapt a lens to a camera body with a larger flange focal distance, the adapter must include a secondary lens in order to compensate. This has the side effect of decreasing the amount of light that reaches the sensor, as well as adding a crop factor to the lens. Without the secondary lens, these adapters will function as an extension tube and will not be able to focus to infinity.

== Notes ==
4/3&#x27;s published facts:
*&quot;Size of the 4/3-type Sensor: The standard diagonal length of the sensor is . It is half that of 35-mm film format ( x = ) The image circle of the interchangeable lens is specified based on this diagonal length. The focal length is about a half that of a 135 film camera lens assuming the same angle of view.&quot;
*&quot;The foundation for the high picture quality of the Four Thirds system is the lens mount, which is about twice the diameter of the image circle.&quot;
*&quot;Differences between Four Thirds System mount and Micro Four Thirds System mount: Mount diameter reduction; As a result of research aimed at facilitating the design of compact, lightweight lenses while maintaining the current strength, the outer diameter of the lens mount has been reduced by approx. . ... the Micro Four Thirds System ... specifies the optimum flange back length required to reduce camera size and thickness, assuming the omission of the mirror box. The flange back length has been reduced to about 1/2 that of the Four Thirds System.&quot;

So:
*21.63mm * 2 = or ~44mm
*43.26mm – 6mm = or ~38mm
*formula_1; See: Pythagorean theorem (formula_2)

NOTE:
Some published reviews of 4/3 instead cite the (female) &quot;outside diameter&quot; of the lens or mount as ~50mm (and micro-4/3 as ~44mm), and not the appropriate &quot;major&quot; diameter (D) ~44mm which is the camera body&#x27;s female mount inside-diameter and the lens&#x27;s male mount outside-diameter (micro-4/3 ~38mm).

<text>General Asif Nawaz Janjua (3 January 1937 – 8 January 1993) was an officer in the Pakistan Army, serving as its fourth Chief of Army Staff from 16 August 1991 until his untimely death in 1993. His tenure is regarded as contributing to civilian control over the Pakistan Armed Forces. Janjua was one of only four high-ranking officers to have died in active service, alongside Admiral Hasan Hafeez Ahmed (1975), General Zia-ul-Haq (1988), and Air Chief Marshal Mushaf Ali Mir (2002).

His unexpected death was initially surrounded by uncertainty, with some speculating foul play after high levels of arsenic poisoning were detected in his body. His family requested further investigations, including the exhumation of his body and an autopsy conducted with the assistance of international experts from France, Britain, and the United States. Despite early suspicions, the cause of death was ultimately determined to be a heart attack.

Born in the Jhelum District of Punjab Province, Janjua came from a Punjabi Janjua Rajput family. He was educated at St Mary&#x27;s Cambridge School and later received military training at the Pakistan Military Academy and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Throughout his career, he was recognized for his discipline and leadership, culminating in the award of the Sword of Honour at Sandhurst.

During his military career, Janjua participated in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, where he was involved in key battles such as the Battle of Chamb. He progressed through the ranks, holding various significant positions, including Chief of General Staff and Corps Commander of V Corps. He played a role in overseeing military operations, particularly in Karachi and Sindh, during a period of rising instability in the country.

==Biography==
===Early life, and between the Indo-Pakistani wars (1965–71)===

Asif Nawaz Janjua was born in a small village, called Chakri Rajgan, which is located in the Jhelum District in Punjab in Pakistan into a Punjabi Janjua Rajput clan, on 31 January 1937. He was a military brat and his father, Raja Abdul Ghafoor Khan, had served as an officer in the British Indian Army, retiring at the rank of Major.

He was educated at the St Mary&#x27;s Cambridge School on Murree Road in Rawalpindi. Two Irish teachers there who taught him the value of life and humanity, Father Francis and May Flanagan, had a significant influence on his upbringing and future career. After his matriculation, he went to join the Pakistan Military Academy in 1954, and was one of very few cadets to be selected to attend the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in the United Kingdom. After completing his initial military training, he passed out from the academy in 1957 and was conferred the Sword of Honour by the academy&#x27;s commandant.

Upon returning to Pakistan, 2nd-Lt. Janjua joined the 5th &quot;Sherdils&quot; Battalion of the Punjab Regiment on 31 March 1957.

In 1965, Captain Nawaz saw action in the second war with India in 1965 on the northern front. In 1970–71, Major Janjua was stationed with the Eastern Command in East-Pakistan, serving as a brigade major in the 111th Infantry Brigade. In 1971, Major Janjua fought in the third war with India in 1971 after taking over the command of his 5th Battalion and saw combat in the Chamb sector against the Indian Army.

After the third war with India in 1971, Major Janjua continued his military service and graduated from the Command and Staff College in Quetta, where he excelled in his studies. In 1976–77, Col. Janjua attended the National Defence University where he attained his MSc in War Studies.

===War and command appointments in the military===

In 1977, Brigadier Janjua was appointed as Chief of Staff of the II Corps stationed in Multan under the command of its field commander, Lt-Gen. M. Shariff. In 1982, he was promoted as two-star rank army general, and escaped from martial law appointments by President Zia-ul-Haq. From 1982 to 1985, Major-General Janjua was posted in Peshawar and served as the GOC of the 7th Infantry Division, posted with the XI Corps.

In 1985, Maj-Gen. Janjua was appointed as Commandant of the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul which he served until 1988. In 1988, he was among the last army generals who were approved for the three-star rank promotion by Prime Minister Mohammad Junejo, and was appointed as Corps Commander of the Sindh-based V Corps by then-Chief of Army Staff Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg.

When General Nawaz took command of his Corps in Karachi it had begun to be embroiled in operations against MQM militants in the city. He would soon come to oversee law and order operations by his Corps in the disturbed city of Karachi. As V Corps was also responsible for security in all of Sindh, it had been embroiled in anti-dacoity and law and order operations in Sindh since the early 1980s. The province had destabilised in the wake of the anti-Zia-ul-Haq Movement for the Restoration of Democracy.

In April 1991, Lt-Gen. Janjua was moved to Rawalpindi when he was appointed at the Army GHQ as the Chief of General Staff (CGS), the second-in-command of the army, under the army chief Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg.

==Chief of Army Staff==

In 1991, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif approved the timely retirement of Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, and there were four senior army generals who were in the race for promotion to four-star appointment in the Pakistani military, included with seniority:

*Lt-Gen. Asif Nawaz, the Chief of General Staff at the Army GHQ based in Rawalpindi.
*Lt-Gen. Shamim Alam, the field commander of the XXXI Corps, stationed in Bahawalpur, Punjab in Pakistan.
*Lt-Gen. Z.A. Naz, the field commander of the I Corps, stationed in Mangla, Punjab in Pakistan.
*Lt-Gen. Hamid Gul, the field commander of the II Corps, Multan, Punjab in Pakistan.

The senior most military officer in the military, Lt-Gen. Janjua&#x27;s recommendation came from the former Chairman joint chiefs Gen.Rahimuddin Khan when the second most senior military officer, Lt-Gen. Shamim Alam was eventually elevated as the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. Lt-Gen. Janjua was confirmed to this four-star promotion by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on 11 June 1991.

His command over the army came when the military embargo had been placed by the United States due to the suspicion about his country&#x27;s clandestine atomic bomb program. Gen. Janjua immediately made a press release through the ISPR where he committed to preventing military interference in national politics when he noted that the &quot;army&#x27;s image had been tarnished and its officers corrupted in Pakistan&#x27;s 25 years of martial law.&quot; Gen. Janjua, who had pro-western views, worked together with Chairman joint chiefs Gen. Shamim and his JS HQ to improve bilateral relations between Pakistan and the United States when he agreed to deploy the combat brigades of the Pakistan Army in Somalia as part of the UN Mission to end the civil war in the country.

His political views reflected political liberalism and he tried to improve the military-to-military relations with the Indian Army when he successfully took Pakistan out of what he saw as the dead-end policy of Islamism by former conservative President Zia. During Nawaz&#x27;s tenure, the army took on the surprising role of becoming a protector of a free press and the liberal values of criticism.

As an army chief, Gen. Janjua played a crucial role in providing military aid to the civilian Government of Pakistan when he deployed the Pakistan Army Rangers to aid the Sindh Police against the dacoits and gangs in Karachi and rural Sindh.

==Death==
Janjua died on 8 January 1993, while he was jogging near his home in Rawalpindi. The death was ruled a heart attack and no autopsy was conducted before the burial, in line with Muslim customs. 

In April 1993, Janjua&#x27;s widow Nuzhat, claimed that her husband had been poisoned by Brigadier Imtiaz, head of the Intelligence Bureau, Shahbaz Sharif, and Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan.

His family commissioned a private forensic test on hair from his hairbrush, which was conducted in the United States. The tests revealed 67 micrograms of arsenic in his hair, significantly higher than the normal level of 4 micrograms. According to the lab report, &quot;The arsenic... falls within the range considered toxic,&quot; indicating elevated levels of arsenic in the hair. The forensic toxicologist stated that the arsenic level by itself is not enough to determine the cause of death but raises a flag that further analysis is warranted. Initially, the government deployed police at his grave to prevent his body from being exhumed. There were rumors that Janjua&#x27;s stomach was removed prior to his burial. However, it was later reported that Janjua&#x27;s family members had hired private security guards to protect his grave, fearing his body would be tampered with.

As a result, his body was exhumed, and an autopsy was conducted by French, British, and American doctors. The cause of death was determined to be a heart attack. A Supreme Court investigation also ruled that Janjua died of natural causes, without performing an autopsy.

Janjua was among just four senior officers to have died while in active service, alongside Admiral Hasan Hafeez Ahmed (1975), General Zia-ul-Haq (1988), and Air Chief Marshal Mushaf Ali Mir (2002).

==Legacy==
Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, then described Asif Nawaz as &quot;a true professional soldier,&quot; and further stated that &quot;he did what he said he would do – he kept the army out of politics.&quot; Unlike many of his predecessors, Asif Nawaz was incorruptible and often talked of how he would relax when he retired, unlike other generals who plunged into politics.

<text>Abdul Waheed Kakar (born 23 March 1937), is a retired senior officer of the Pakistan Army who served as the fifth chief of army staff, appointed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on 12 January 1993 after the controversial death of his predecessor General Asif Nawaz. Upon the completion of his three-year tenure, Kakar retired in 1996.

Notably, Kakar superseded five senior high ranking army generals with more years of seniority. General Kakar oversaw the national general elections, after he secured the resignations of President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to resolve the Constitutional crisis in 1993.

==Biography==

Abdul Waheed Kakar was born into a Pashtun family of the Abdullah Zai (Male Zai), in the Shahābzai Kakari tribe village of Zhob, Balochistan, in the suburbs of Peshawar, North-West Frontier Province in British India (now, Pakistan) on 23 March 1937. His tribe, Kakar, originally hailed from Zhob, Baluchistan in Pakistan, and was fluent in Pashto. His family later had migrated to North and eventually found a way to be settled in Peshawar.

His uncle, Abdur Rab Nishtar, was listed as one of the founding fathers of Pakistan who would later serve as the Governor of Punjab as well as serving as the President of Pakistan Muslim League. After graduating from local high school in 1955, Kakar went to attend the Edwardes College where he secured his graduation. He joined the Pakistan Army in 1956, and was directed to attend the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul where he was expected to pass out from the academy in 1958 but was held back for a 6-month term. Eventually, Waheed gained commission in the Frontier Force Regiment in 1959 as a 2nd-Lt.

His combat duty witnessed the military actions in Chawinda in Sialkot Punjab in Pakistan against the Indian Army during the conflict with India in 1965. In 1971, Major Kakar served as the brigade major of an independent infantry stationed at the Sulemanki sector, and fought against the Indian Army. His combat duty during the actions of both wars served his reputation as did scenes of major battles in the respective wars.

After the war, Major Kakar was selected to attend the Command and Staff College in Canada, where he stood first in the examinations and qualified as a psc. He was later selected to attend a staff course program. Upon returning from Canada, he continued his education when he was selected to attend the National Defence University (NDU) where he studied and attained graduation in War studies degree at the Armed Forces War College of the National Defence University. He has commanded 27 Azad Kashmir Regiment as Lieutenant Colonel in Azad Kashmir region before war studies.

In 1976–78, Brig. Kakar was appointed as Chief of Staff of the II Corps, stationed in Multan, commanded by then-Lieutenant-General Rahimuddin Khan. 

In 1984, Major-General Kakar was subsequently given the command of the 16th Infantry Division in Quetta as its GOC. In 1987–89, Maj-Gen. Kakar was appointed as an Adjutant-General at the Army GHQ. At the time he was ordered to admit three students in the Army Medical College but he refused despite direct orders from the President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, as they did not meet the minimum criteria. The President then ordered the increase of overall seats from 60 to 100. In 1989, Lieutenant-General Kakar was posted as field commander of the XII Corps, stationed in Quetta.

== Chief of Army Staff ==

In summer of 1993, the MoD announced the names of retiring army generals who were due retirement, and such list included Lt-Gen. Kakar as he was also seeking the retirement.

Without consulting the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan nominated and approved the appointment papers of junior-most Lt-Gen. Kakar to the promotion of senior four-star rank when elevating him as the Chief of Army Staff (COAS).

The appointment was extremely controversial due to Lt-Gen. Kakar superseding at least six senior army generals, including: 
**Lieutenant-General Farrakh Khan, Chief of General Staff (CGS) at Army GHQ in Rawalpindi. 
**Lieutenant-General Javed Nasir, Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI). 
**Lieutenant-General Mohammad Ashraf, Field Commander, IV Corps in Lahore.
**Lieutenant General Hamid Niaz on secondment to Mari Gas Corporation Limited.
**Lieutenant-General Arif Bangash, Quartermaster General (QMG) at Army GHQ in Rawalpindi.
**Lieutenant-General Rehem Dil Bhatti, President of National Defence University (NDU).
Among these listed army generals, the CGS, the QMG, and the DG ISI, opted to stay to serve on their assignments despite being overlooked for the promotions.

After his appointment, a member of the National Assembly who belonged to PMPA was quoted: &quot;&quot;the era of the Pakhtoons has begun. The president belonged to the Frontier province and so did the new Chief of Army Staff&quot;.&quot;

After assuming the command of the army as its army chief and contrary to the expectations of President Ghulam Ishaq, General Kakar played a decisive role in resolving the constitutional crises by securing first the resignation of President Ghulam Ishaq and later Prime Minister Sharif in 1993. This allowed the holding of the nationwide general elections that witnessed the return of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Benazir Bhutto, who eventually became the Prime Minister of Pakistan. During his tenure, General Kakar was instrumental in securing the government funding for the Shaheen project developed under the PAEC&#x27;s scientists.

In September 1995, General Abdul Waheed Kakar played a crucial role in sustaining the democracy by having discovered a plot by a group of army officers headed by Major-General Zahirul Islam Abbasi, acting in complicity with the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami a militant group, to assassinate him and Benazir Bhutto, to capture power. This plan was foiled by the Military Intelligence and the Military Police who initiated the operation to have those involved captured and arrested.

In 1996, General Kakar reportedly declined the extension of his service and there was no public statement on the matter. After his retirement, he never appeared in public and lives a very quiet life in Rawalpindi.

== Reception ==

General Kakar had an imposing and robust personality that brokered no nonsense. In the military, he was popular among his colleagues as a flamboyant rider and a mountaineer.

His reception as an army chief was hailed and celebrated by the Pashtuns nationalists when Mahmood Achakzai, then-MNA, reportedly remarked in the news media in 1993: &quot;&quot;This is not a General from the Sandhurst colonial brand. I welcome an enlightened man from the rigid mountain ranges of Loralai. He has the professional skills for improving the war performance of the Pakistan Army. But more than that, he is intelligent enough to comprehend politics and will promote the democratic process. General Waheed is not a religious extremist&quot;.&quot;

Published writer/author Ikram Sehgal mentioned the following in his article for Bol News, &quot;Emulating The Kakar Model&quot;: Can the Army itself avoid its prime responsibility to confront any development endangering national security by remaining aloof from politics? The so-called “Bangladesh model” created by the then Bangladesh COAS Gen Moyeenuddin Ahmad on June 11, 2007, was totally modelled on General Waheed Kakar&#x27;s 1993 model where not one single soldier went into civilian administration. Rescuing the political process from sliding the country into anarchy kept the army out of politics and the civil administration.

In July 1993, the then COAS Pakistan Army General Waheed Kakar calmly and peacefully saw off both the President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif who both were endangering national security by creating conditions that could have led to civil war. Instead of taking over power himself, the then COAS moved the Chairman Senate Waseem Sajjad constitutionally upwards to be the interim President and formed an interim government of capable technocrats, retired bureaucrats and ex-servicemen to successfully govern and oversee free and fair elections.

While the “Kakar Model” went beyond what the 90 days the Constitution allows, no one ever challenged this move, because it was done in good faith. Such was the respect for General Kakar and the Pakistan Army.

<doc id="1211728" wikidata="Q223170" url="?curid=1211728" title="Argentine Primera División">
<text>The Primera División (; ), known officially as Liga Profesional de Fútbol, or Torneo Betano for sponsorship reasons, is a professional football league in Argentina, organised by the Argentine Football Association (AFA).

The Primera División is the country&#x27;s premier football division and is the top division of the Argentine football league system. It operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Primera Nacional (Second Division), with the teams placed lowest at the end of the season being relegated.

Argentina held its first championship in 1891, making it the first country outside the United Kingdom to establish a football league. The Football League had debuted in England in 1888, followed by the Scottish and Irish leagues in 1890. In the early years, only teams from Buenos Aires, Greater Buenos Aires, La Plata and Rosario were affiliated to the national association. Teams from other cities would join in later years.

In 1931, the Primera División became professional when 18 clubs left the amateur leagues to form their own professional competition.

The Argentine championship was ranked as one of the top ten strongest leagues worldwide for the 2015 calendar year by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS). Argentina placed 4th after La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Bundesliga (Germany), but has since descended to 19th in the 2021 list.

== Format and teams ==
=== Championship ===

The 2024 season will feature 28 teams, including 26 from the previous season and two promoted from the 2023 Primera Nacional. The league will run from May 12 to December 15.

Participating teams played each other in a round-robin system totaling 27 rounds. The team with most points at the end of the season is crowned champion.

On 17 October 2024, the AFA announced that there would be no relegations that season and the 2025 Primera División would feature 30 teams. 

=== Relegation ===
Relegation is based on an averaging system. At the end of the season, the two teams with the worst three-year averages are relegated, while the winner and runner-up of Primera Nacional championship are promoted to Primera.

===Domestic cups===

The Primera División champion gains a place to play the Trofeo de Campeones de la Liga Profesional v. the winner of Copa de la Liga Profesional.

The 4th edition of Copa de la Liga Profesional will be held in the second half of 2023, when the league tournament concludes. It will begin on 20 August and will end on 16 December. Teams will be divided into two zones (A and B) and will play each other in a single round robin format, totalising 14 fixtures.

===International cups===

As of 2022, five clubs from Argentina are eligible to play the Copa Libertadores. The champion of Primera División automatically qualifies for the tournament. The other four teams best placed in the table at the end of the tournament (2nd to 5th) are also eligible to play the Cup.

For the Copa Sudamericana, six teams are eligible. Clubs placed 6th to 11th in the table at the end of the tournament, gain a place to play the cup.

==History==

===Round-robin amateur tournaments (1891–1931)===
In 1891 the &quot;Association Argentine Football League&quot; was established, with Alex Lamont of St. Andrew&#x27;s Scots School as one of its board members. The AAFL was the first football league outside of the British Isles., to establish a football league. The first amateur Primera División matches were played on 12 April 1891: Buenos Aires FC vs. St. Andrew&#x27;s and Old Caledonians vs. Belgrano FC.

===Professional era tournaments (1931–1966)===
A single double round-robin tournament was played each year, and the team with the most points was crowned as champion, except for 1936, during that year the winners of &quot;Copa de Honor&quot; and the &quot;Campeonato&quot; played a match for the championship title. The single tournament arrangement lasted until 1966.

During this period, the traditional &quot;Big Five&quot; clubs, namely, River Plate, Boca Juniors, Independiente, Racing and San Lorenzo dominated Argentine football. No other team besides them had won the league championship in these 36 years. The most serious title challenge came from Banfield in 1951, when they finished with the same number of points as Racing Club in the league table. However, they lost 1–0 in the two-legged first place playoffs and gave the title to Racing.

The averaging system for relegations was implemented for the first time in the 1957 championship, with Ferro Carril Oeste becoming the first team to be relegated under that system. Averaging continued until 1963, when the championship returned to its old format (with the worst placed teams being relegated). Nevertheless, there were no relegations until 1967 (with Unión (SF) and Deportivo Español being sent to Primera B after playing a relegation tournament contested by teams of First and Second divisions to define the promotions and relegations).

===Metropolitano and Nacional (1967–1985)===

In 1967, the single tournament format was abandoned and replaced by two championships in each year: the Metropolitano and the Nacional. The Metropolitano only allowed clubs competing in the old tournament to participate, while the Nacional was open to teams from regional tournaments. The format of competition was also altered, with the double round-robin tournament replaced by the two-group championship Metropolitano and single round-robin Nacional in that year.

This change revolutionized Argentine football, allowing smaller clubs—such as Estudiantes de La Plata, Vélez Sarsfield, and Chacarita Juniors—to challenge the dominance of the five clubs that had previously won all championships.

Between 1967 and 1969, the Metropolitano and Nacional had gone through several format changes. In the first three years, the Metropolitano was a two-group championship, with the best two teams from each group competing the semi-finals of the knock-out stage.

The six best teams of each group would advance to the Nacional, with four more teams coming from regional tournaments, to compete for the Nacional championship in a single round-robin format. The seventh and eighth team of each group, alongside four teams from regional tournaments, played the Promocional tournament, which, in 1969, was replaced by the Petit tournament contested without regional teams. The ninth to twelfth teams of each group entered the Reclasificatorio tournament to determine the relegating teams.

In 1970, the format of the Metropolitano and Nacional underwent a reform. Since that year, and until 1985, the Nacional had become a group tournament with playoffs, while the Metropolitano had been competed under a single or double round-robin system, except for the 1974, 1976 and 1979 edition, which were also contested as a group tournament with playoffs.

Despite the format change in 1970, teams still entered the Nacional championship, Petit tournament and Reclasificatorio tournament according to their rankings in the Metropolitano in that year. However, in 1971, the tournaments were separated. Teams did not enter the Nacional by finishing at the top ranks of Metropolitano. On the other hand, the Petit tournament and Reclasificatorio tournament were abandoned. The Metropolitano and Nacional became two truly individual tournaments. Although the old system was reused in 1972, the separation was instituted again in 1973 and was adopted throughout the remaining Metropolitano and Nacional era.

The Metropolitano was always played first, until the order of the tournaments was reversed in 1982.

After 20 years since the last time it had been used, the average system for relegations returned in the 1983 Metropolitano championship, two years after San Lorenzo was relegated. That year, River Plate finished 18° out of 19 teams and would have been relegated under the old system, along with Racing de Córdoba. The first teams to be relegated on average were Racing and Nueva Chicago. Boca Juniors was also struggling at that time and had a dismal 1984 season. These facts have led to speculation that the averaging system was instituted to minimize the chance of big teams being relegated.

===European-styled seasons (1985–1991)===
Following the advice of Argentina national football team&#x27;s then coach Carlos Salvador Bilardo, the structure of play was modified in 1985. Traditionally, like other countries in Southern Hemisphere, football season began and ended according to the calendar year. However, upon the reform, European style season was adopted for the first time among all the South American countries. Moreover, instead of holding two championships every year, only one double round-robin tournament was contested, like football leagues in Europe. The team topping the table at the end of season was crowned the champion.

In 1985, after the Nacional was played, the Metropolitano was not held, while the new single tournament (1985/86) was played for the first time.

In 1988–89 season, three points were given to match winners. If a draw occurred, A penalty shootout took place and the winner of the shootout would get two points while the loser still had one. This format was scrapped in the following season.

===Apertura and Clausura (1991–2012)===

Five years later, the single championship was split into two single-round tournaments, giving birth to the Apertura and Clausura arrangement. In 1991 the two champions played winner-take-all matches. This practice was very controversial, especially since one of the biggest teams, Boca Juniors, lost the finals against Newell&#x27;s Old Boys, costing them their first official championship since 1981 despite an unbeaten run in the &quot;Clausura&quot;. In 1992 the game was held as well (this time between Newell&#x27;s Old Boys and River Plate), but regardless of the result (which favored River Plate) both teams were awarded the title of &quot;Champion&quot;. After 1992, the practice was quickly abandoned, so that two champions (on equal footing) were crowned every season and no deciding game is played.

Originally, two points were given to match winners except in the 1989–90 season. Starting in 1995–96, the rule was changed and three points were given for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss.

The 1999–2000 season introduced the promotion and relegation system for the first time, where the two clubs placed 1st and 2nd within the four teams with the lowest average, had to play a two-leg series with teams from Primera B Nacional to keep their place in the division.

===Inicial and Final (2012–2014)===
For the 2012–13 season, the Torneo Apertura and Clausura became &quot;Torneo Inicial&quot; and &quot;Torneo Final,&quot; being disputed with the same format as before but proclaiming only one champion each season, unlike the last format that had two champions (Apertura and Clausura, respectively).

Before those changes, a controversial project for the 2012–13 season had been proposed: it consisted in a new tournament that would contain both the Primera División and Primera B Nacional teams: the former was not going to have any relegated team in its 2011–12 season and include sixteen teams from the latter, Primera B Nacional. The tournament would also include a team from the Primera B Metropolitana and one from the Torneo Argentino A, creating a 38-team league. These changes were strongly opposed by the media and the people, and finally the tournament was called off. However, the project for the new format was successfully picked up starting from the 2015 season.

=== Superfinal (2013–2014) ===
Once the initial and final tournaments had finished, both winners had to play a match for the Copa Campeonato (familiarly known as &quot;Superfinal&quot;). The AFA had previously determined that the first edition (played in 2013) would be considered as a Primera División official title (2012–13 season), therefore Vélez Sarsfield was awarded its 10th official championship after defeating Newell&#x27;s.

Nevertheless, from the 2014 edition it was determined that the &quot;Superfinal&quot; would not be considered as a Primera División title but an official cup.

Due to this the 2015 and 2016 seasons were played as single tournaments with only one champion per season, the Copa Campeonato has not been held since then.

=== 2014–20: One tournament again and Superliga ===
Starting August 2014, the &quot;Torneo de Transición&quot; was held, with 20 teams participating (17 from the 2013–14 season and 3 promoted from the 2013–14 Primera B Nacional). No teams were relegated at the end of the championship.

In 2015, the format switched to a tournament with 30 teams. The first five clubs of the Zonas A &amp; B of 2014 Primera B Nacional season promoted to the Primera División. Those 10 teams, with the addition of the 20 clubs currently participating in the top division, qualified to contest the next season.

That same year, the AFA announced the format for the next five seasons of the Primera División:

* In the first half of 2016, the league was contested by 30 teams. One team was relegated to and one team was promoted from Primera B Nacional.
* From August 2016 to June 2017, the league was also contested by 30 teams. Four teams were relegated to and two teams were promoted from Primera B Nacional.
* From August 2017 to June 2018, the league was contested by 28 teams. Four teams will be relegated to and two teams will be promoted from Primera B Nacional. This season was also the first &quot;Superliga Argentina&quot;, organised by the homonymous entity, that is administered independently and has its own statute. Therefore, the AFA focused exclusively in the Argentina national teams. The 2017–18 season was the first championship organised by the body.
* From August 2018 to June 2019, the Superliga was contested by 26 teams. Four teams were relegated to and two teams were promoted from Primera B Nacional.

=== 2020–present ===
In February 2020, President of AFA Claudio Tapia stated that the Superliga had been established to position Argentine football as a product, but it failed in that purpose. As a result, the AFA would take over the organisation of Primera División championships, according to Tapia&#x27;s statement. One month after those announcements, the president of the Superliga, Mariano Elizondo, resigned.

The Superliga was replaced by a similar body, named &quot;Liga Profesional de Fútbol&quot;, directly linked to AFA and presided by Marcelo Tinelli. It was expected that Superliga was dissolved once the 2020 edition of Copa de la Superliga Argentina finished, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic the cup was cancelled, accelerating times. In May 2020, the LPF was launched by the AFA.

== Division levels ==
== Clubs ==

As of 2024, twenty-eight teams are competing in the league, the 26 teams that took part in the previous season as well as two promoted teams from the 2023 Primera Nacional.

== Champions ==

Since the first championship held in 1891, 28 clubs have won the Primera División title at least once. The list include all the titles won by each club since the first Primera División championship held in 1891. Clubs in &quot;italic&quot; no longer exist or are currently disaffiliated from the AFA.

;Notes
== Top scorers ==

The all-time top scorer of Primera División Argentina is forward Arsenio Erico with 295 goals. Most players on the all-time top scorers table had their golden age before the 1970s, with all of the top five all-time scorers having retired before 1973. The only player retired after that year in the top twenty list is Martín Palermo, who played for Estudiantes (LP) and Boca Juniors in Primera División.

== Records and facts ==
== Media coverage ==

In Argentina, matches are broadcast by American companies ESPN and Turner, which signed a contract for 5 years where both companies agreed to pay A$ 3,200 million per year. Local company Torneos, who was formerly the official broadcaster of the Argentine championship from 1985 until 2009, will take over the content production of the games for Fox and La Corte will handle content production for Turner while Cablevisión, DirecTV and Telecentro will be the TV operators.

Until the agreement with Fox and Turner was signed, Argentine football matches were broadcast nationally by El Trece, Telefe, America TV, and Channel 7. Games were free in Argentina from 2009 to 2016 thanks to the &quot;Fútbol para Todos&quot; (&quot;Football for Everyone&quot;) program, when the National Government and AFA decided rescind the agreement. The Government paid A$9,500 million for 7 years.

The league attracts television audiences beyond South America, Europe, Africa and MENA. The matches are broadcast in over 80 countries. In Latin America the matches are broadcast live by ESPN (three matches per week), TyC Sports International (all the matches per week) and another streaming platforms like Prende TV, Star+ and Fanatiz (together with AFA Play). In the United States, the matches are streamed on Paramount+ since 2021. BeIN Sports broadcasts the games live in France and MENA regions. ITV showed highlights on a regional basis with the introduction of overnight broadcasting in 1988–89. Channel 5 showed highlights from 1999 to 2003, while Premier Sports showed live games across 2011 and 2012.

In the United States, in the 2004-05 season, ESPN Deportes (instead of Fox Sports networks), broadcast some matches from &quot;El Clásico del Domingo&quot; (Like other football competitions as Bundesliga, Ligue 1 or Copa Libertadores).

<doc id="1211730" wikidata="Q1070845" url="?curid=1211730" title="Photinia">
<text>Photinia () is a genus of about 30 species of small trees and large shrubs, but the taxonomy has recently varied greatly, with the genera &quot;Heteromeles&quot;, &quot;Stranvaesia&quot; and &quot;Aronia&quot; sometimes included in &quot;Photinia&quot;.

They are a part of the rose family (Rosaceae) and related to the apple. The botanical genus name derives from the Greek word &quot;photeinos&quot; for shiny and refers to the often glossy leaves. Most species are evergreen, but deciduous species also occur. The small apple-shaped fruit has a size of 4 to 12 mm and forms in large quantities. They ripen in the fall and often remain hanging on the bush until well into the winter. The fruits are used as food by birds, which excrete the seeds with their droppings and thereby distribute the plant.

The natural range of these species is restricted to warm temperate Asia, from the Himalaya east to Japan and south to India and Thailand. They have, however, been widely cultivated throughout the world as ornamentals for their white flowers and red fruits.

The scientific name &quot;Photinia&quot; is also widely used as the common name. Another name sometimes used is &quot;Christmas berry&quot;, but this name is a source of confusion, since it is commonly applied to plants in several genera including &quot;Heteromeles&quot;, &quot;Lycium&quot;, &quot;Schinus&quot;, and &quot;Ruscus&quot;. The name &quot;photinia&quot; also continues to be used for several species of small trees in the mountains of Mexico and Central America which had formerly been included in the genus &quot;Photinia&quot;.

==Description==
Photinias typically grow from 4–15 m tall, with a usually irregular crown of angular branches; the branches are often (not always) thorny. The leaves are alternate, entire or finely toothed, varying between species from 3–15 cm in length and 1.5–5 cm wide; the majority of species are evergreen but several are deciduous. The flowers are produced in early summer in dense terminal corymbs; each flower is 5–10 mm diameter, with five rounded white petals; they have a mild, hawthorn-like scent. The fruit is a small pome, 4–12 mm across, bright red and berry-like, produced large quantities, maturing in the fall and often persisting well into the winter. The fruit are consumed by birds, including thrushes, waxwings and starlings; the seeds are dispersed in their droppings. &quot;Photinia&quot; species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including common emerald, feathered thorn and setaceous Hebrew character. Photinias are subject to leaf blight. https://homeguides.sfgate.com/photinia-blight-43033.html.

==Taxonomy==
Some botanists also include the closely related North American species &quot;Heteromeles arbutifolia&quot; in &quot;Photinia&quot; — as &quot;Photinia arbutifolia&quot;. The genus &quot;Stranvaesia&quot; is so similar in morphology to &quot;Photinia&quot; that its species have sometimes been included within it, but recent molecular data indicate that the two genera are not closely related. The genus &quot;Aronia&quot; has been included in &quot;Photinia&quot; in some classifications, but recent molecular data confirm that these genera are not closely related. Other close relatives include the firethorns (&quot;Pyracantha&quot;), cotoneasters (&quot;Cotoneaster&quot;) and hawthorns (&quot;Crataegus&quot;).

A number of species have been moved to the separate genus &quot;Stranvaesia&quot; including &quot;P. amphidoxa&quot;, &quot;P. davidiana&quot;, &quot;P. nussia&quot;, and &quot;P. tomentosa&quot;.

==Uses==

Photinias are very popular ornamental shrubs, grown for their fruit and foliage. Numerous hybrids and cultivars are available; several of the cultivars are selected for their strikingly bright red young leaves in spring and summer. The most widely planted are:

*&quot;Photinia × fraseri&quot; (&quot;P. glabra&quot; × &quot;P. serratifolia&quot;) - red tip photinia, Christmas berry

:*&quot;Photinia&quot; × &quot;fraseri&quot; &#x27;Red Robin&#x27; - probably the most widely planted of all, this cultivar has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit
:*&quot;Photinia&quot; × &quot;fraseri&quot; &#x27;Little Red Robin&#x27;, a plant similar to &#x27;Red Robin&#x27;, but dwarf in stature with an ultimate height/spread of around 2–3 ft
:*&quot;Photinia&quot; × &quot;fraseri&quot; &#x27;Camilvy&#x27;
:*&quot;Photinia&quot; × &quot;fraseri&quot; &#x27;Curly Fantasy&#x27;
:*&quot;Photinia&quot; × &quot;fraseri&quot; &#x27;Super Hedger&#x27; - a newer hybrid with strong upright growth
:*&quot;Photinia&quot; × &quot;fraseri&quot; &#x27;Pink Marble&#x27; also known as &#x27;Cassini&#x27;, a new cultivar with rose-pink tinted new growth and a creamy-white variegated margin on the leaves
:*&quot;Photinia&quot; × &quot;fraseri&quot; &#x27;Robusta&#x27;

*&quot;Photinia&quot; &#x27;Redstart&#x27; (&quot;Stranvaesia davidiana&quot; × &quot;P.&quot; × &quot;fraseri&quot;)
*&quot;Photinia&quot; &#x27;Palette&#x27; (parentage unknown)
*&quot;Photinia davidiana&quot; &#x27;Fructu Luteo&#x27; (fruit yellow)
*&quot;Photinia davidiana&quot; &#x27;Prostrata&#x27; (a low-growing form)

==Toxicity==
Some varieties of &quot;Photinia&quot; are toxic due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in the vacuoles of foliage and fruit cells. When the leaves are chewed these compounds are released and are rapidly converted to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) which blocks cellular respiration. The amount of HCN produced varies considerably between taxa, and is in general greatest in young leaves. Ruminants are particularly affected by cyanogenic glycosides because the first stage of their digestive system (the rumen) provides better conditions for liberating HCN than the stomachs of monogastric vertebrates.

<doc id="1211733" wikidata="Q1965086" url="?curid=1211733" title="2005 Palestinian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in the West Bank and Gaza Strip of the Palestinian National Authority on Sunday, 9 January 2005 to elect the President of the Palestinian National Authority, to succeed Yasser Arafat, who had died on 11 November 2004. The election was the first to be held since the 1996 general election, and voters elected Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Mahmoud Abbas for a four-year term.

Seven candidates contested the election. Abbas won over 67% of the votes cast, independent candidate Mustafa Barghouti came second with 21%, and the remaining candidates were far behind. The election was boycotted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Hamas urged supporters to stay away, but did not try to disrupt the election. In the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is strongest, it is estimated that about half of the eligible voters voted.

No presidential elections have taken place since 2005. Abbas has continued in office since the expiration of the four-year term on 9 January 2009, with planned elections repeatedly postponed.

==Candidates==
On 25 November 2004, Fatah&#x27;s Revolutionary Council endorsed Mahmoud Abbas as its preferred candidate for the presidential election, scheduled for 9 January 2005, despite his relative lack of popular appeal. Abbas was a former PA Prime Minister.

Marwan Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council and Fatah leader in the West Bank, who was in an Israeli prison after being convicted for a number of intifada killings , suggested that he might run , inspiring considerable speculation about his prospects. He was seen as the only candidate who could hope to compete seriously against Abbas. However, his proposed candidacy met with resistance from Fatah activists . After contradictory announcements, Marwan Barghouti declared his candidacy just before the registration deadline expired but then withdrew from the race on 12 December, after discussions between his representatives and the Fatah leadership . Opinion polls before Marwan Barghouti withdrew his candidacy suggested that the contest would largely be between Abbas and Marwan Barghouti. Some of these polls showed:

* Abbas 44% / Marwan Barghouti 46% (±3%) (Development Studies Program, Bir Zeit University)
* Abbas 40% / Marwan Barghouti 38% (±3%) (Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research)
* Abbas 40% / Marwan Barghouti 22% (±3%) (Palestinian Center for Public Opinion) .

With Marwan Barghouti&#x27;s withdrawal, Abbas was seen as the clear favourite, with Marwan Barghouti‘s cousin Mustafa Barghouti in second place.

===Final list of candidates===
* Mahmoud Abbas - &quot;Palestine Liberation Organisation&quot;. Former Prime Minister and current chairman of the PLO, endorsed by the Fatah Revolutionary Council on November 25, 2004.
* Abelhaleem Hasan Abdelraziq Ashqar - &quot;independent&quot;.
* Sayyid Barakah - &quot;independent&quot;.
* Mustafa Barghouti - &quot;independent&quot;. A democracy activist and head of the Palestinian National Initiative. His candidacy was supported by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Not to be confused with his cousin Marwan Barghouti.
* Taysir Khalid - &quot;Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine&quot;
* Bassam al-Salhi - &quot;Palestinian People&#x27;s Party&quot;
* Abdel Karim Shubeir - &quot;independent&quot;

Three other candidates who registered by the end of the registration period subsequently withdrew: they were Marwan Barghouti, Hassan Khreisheh and Abd al-Sattar Qasim.

==Registration==
===Preparation of voting register===
The CEC had made enormous efforts to register all eligible Palestinian voters, but almost a third of eligible voters did not register or were unable to register. Problems were due to a not up to date &quot;civil registry&quot; and the translation of Arabic names, which were in Hebrew on Israeli ID cards. In an effort to boost low turnout, the CEC made a controversial decision in the final hours of polling day to allow unregistered voters to cast ballots using only their identity cards, which raised fears of multiple voting. A Palestinian election official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that the changes came after heavy pressure from Mahmoud Abbas&#x27; Fatah movement, which feared a low turnout could weaken Abbas. (&quot;Abbas Wins Palestinian Vote in Landslide,&quot; Associated Press, 10 January 2005).

The day before the election the total number of registered voters was 1,092,407 according to a CEC press release. On 23 November, the CEC said: &quot;The number of registrants on the voters’ list reached 1,111,868, or 67 percent of the estimated number of eligible voters, during the registration process conducted between September 4 and October 13, 2004. Of these names, 19,000 were removed from the voters’ list because the accompanying data was incomplete or the names were repeated on the list. With this adjustment, the number of registered voters decreased to 1,092,856.&quot; (&quot;46% of Registered Voters are Youths, 46% are Women.&quot;)

===Palestinian diaspora===

According to UNRWA, there were 2.6 million Palestinians registered as refugees with the agency eligible to receive services who lived outside Palestine, in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. An unknown additional number sometimes estimated to be up to one million live in the diaspora in Europe, North and South America and in other Arab countries.

==Conduct==
The election was conducted by the Palestinian Central Elections Commission (CEC), which was also responsible for the preparation of an electoral register. The head of the CEC was Hanna Nasir, who was appointed in 2002 by Yasser Arafat. The CEC was established by the Palestinian Authority in 1995 as an independent body.

The CEC experienced some technical problems, including those due to the incomplete electoral register. Persons not listed on the electoral register were permitted to vote on presentation of a valid identity card. In view of the registration problems, in an effort to boost low turnout, in the final hours of polling day the CEC was controversially instructed to extend voting by two hours beyond the appointed closing time to allow unregistered voters to cast ballots using only their identity cards. The decision raised fears of multiple voting.

The election was observed by a number of international observers, including former President Jimmy Carter and U.S. Senators Joe Biden and John E. Sununu.

===Obstruction by Israel Claimed by CEC===
The election campaign faced problems due to the widespread blockade of the Palestinian territories by the Israel Defense Forces. Despite Israel&#x27;s assurances that it would do what it could to ensure that the election took place, in many instances Israeli forces actively interfered in the campaign. Among reported incidents was the arrest of Mustafa Barghouti by Israeli forces and his subsequent expulsion from East Jerusalem when he was going to hold an election speech there. He was also prevented from entering Nablus and Gaza. Bassam al-Salhi, candidate for the socialist Palestinian People&#x27;s Party, was also prevented from visiting East Jerusalem. Many of Abbas&#x27; opponents claimed that they were unfairly treated as Israel denied them entry to areas Abbas was allowed to visit during the election campaign. Abbas was the only candidate allowed access to Gaza.

Voter registration was hampered by closure of registration centers due to curfews, roadblocks and road closures. Registration staff and supervisors were detained. Israeli troops, used gas grenades and noise in the vicinity. The CEC claimed a number of centers were raided.

Particularly East Jerusalem was affected. According to the CEC, checking of the names of voters in the voters list was prevented. Also the polling was supervised by the Israeli postal authority. The votes were not counted at the polling centers themselves, but first transported to the Jerusalem electoral constituency office in Dahiyat al-Barid.
 The CEC also said that voters were intimidated by recording the ID card numbers that were listed in the register and registration staff members were detained.

The CEC said there were difficulties in accessing polling stations. In Khan Younis Israeli soldiers opened fire against a school used as a polling station and by roadblocks prevented thousands of people from getting to the polling stations.

The European Union&#x27;s foreign policy chief Javier Solana criticized Israel for insufficiently easing restrictions and was quoted as saying that &quot;Israel did not fulfill its commitment as it should have.&quot; 

==Results==
Mahmoud Abbas won the election with over 67% of the votes cast.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==International response==
The EU praised the election, with European Commission president José Manuel Durão Barroso describing it as &quot;a very important step towards the creation of a viable and democratic Palestinian state&quot;.

<doc id="1211740" wikidata="Q351514" url="?curid=1211740" title="Adamawa Region">
<text>The Adamawa Region () is a constituent region of the Republic of Cameroon. It borders the Centre and East regions to the south, the Northwest and West regions to the southwest, Nigeria to the west, the Central African Republic (CAR) to the east, and the North Region to the north.

This mountainous area forms the barrier between Cameroon&#x27;s forested south and savanna north. At almost 64,000 km2 in land area, the Adamawa is the third largest of Cameroon&#x27;s ten regions. The land is rugged and sparsely populated, however, as most is devoted to the rearing of cattle. The Muslim Fulbe (Fulani) form the major ethnic group, though Tikar, Gbaya, and other peoples are present in lesser numbers.

==History==

===Early population movements===

The Adamawa&#x27;s oldest populations were various Paleo-Sudanese peoples. These were mostly displaced or absorbed by invading Sudanese groups in the 8th or 9th century. These included the Mbum (Mboum), Ndoro (Dourou), Kutin, (Koutine), Laka-Mbere, Chamba, Doayo, Fali, Mundang (Moundang), and Tupuri (Toupouri).

It&#x27;s southwestern flank lies within the northern fringes of the region of the earliest (Proto-) Bantu homeland from where the Bantu expansion began about 2000 BC (Blench, 1993). This stretch is believed to contain some of &quot;the Bantu who stated home&quot; after the Bantu split and expansion to central, eastern and southern Africa Zeitlyn - Connell, 2003:136). Since the split, the southwestern section witnessed series of invasions and dispersals analogous to Armageddon. Many of the populations of the Western Grassfields can be traced to these dispersals.

The Kanem-Bornu Empire of Lake Chad had relations with these tribes. They called the area Fumbina or Mabina (a name which denoted the present province as well as territories in present-day Nigeria and the Central African Republic). The Kanem-Bornu also introduced Islam to the region between 1349 and 1385 by way of the Islamic centre at Kano in present-day Nigeria. However, no more than a few rulers, nobles or merchants ever converted.

Many more tribes entered the territory from the region of Chad between the 14th and 17th centuries. These included the Semi-Bantu tribes, such as the Bamileke, Bamun, Kom, Nso, Tikar, Widikum, and Wimbam. The Bantu came as well, examples being the Beti-Pahuin and Maka and Njem. Other groups who came were the Gbaya, from the present CAR, and the Vute, from the Lake Chad region. The Vute were region&#x27;s first iron workers, and they founded the towns of Mbamnyang (present Banyo) and Tibaré (present Tibati). The Semi-Bantu peoples gradually moved south before settling near the headwaters of the Mbam River sometime between the 17th and 19th centuries. The Bantu settled east of them, south of the Adamawa Plateau. One or all of these populations founded Banyo, Tibati, and Ngaoundéré.

Meanwhile, the Bantu and Semi-Bantu invasions drove the longer-established Sudanese peoples north. The Mbum, Ndoro, Kutin, and Laka-Mbere moved to the present-day province&#x27;s northern reaches, while the other Sudanese migrated even farther. This period marked the highest population for the Adamawa territory until modern times. However, one event had drastic consequences for the region: the arrival of the Fulbe.

===Fulbe jihads===

Early Fulbe settlers entered the Adamawa from present-day Nigeria or northern Cameroon as early as the 13th century. These settlers and nomads were never numerous, however, and they often held subservient status to other tribes. Over time, however, the steady stream of Fulbe immigrants allowed Fulbe communities to spring up in many areas. These early Fulbe converted to Islam sometime in the 17th century, beginning with the settled, or town, Fulbe.

In 1804, Fulbe in the territory and beyond were growing disenchanted with submission to pagan tribes. They were also hungry for larger territories that they could use for cattle grazing. The Fulbe leader Usman dan Fodio responded to this sentiment and called a jihad. Usman named his lieutenant Modima Adam Al-Hasan, or Modibo Adama, lamido of Fumbina, and Adama quickly raised an army in the territory.

Adama&#x27;s forces proved all but unstoppable. He conquered major Vute centres at Mbamnyang and Tibaré in 1835, which he renamed Banyo and Tibati. At Adama&#x27;s death in 1847, Fulbe horsemen controlled territory from the Niger River to the west and the Logone to the east and from the Sahara to the north and the Sanaga River to the south to form the Sokoto Caliphate. Adama&#x27;s emirate (known as the Adamawa Emirate) was divided into districts under governors; the Adamawa Plateau fell into the Ngaoundéré subdivision.

Fighting against native peoples continued for many years. Around 1830, the Fulbe conquered the Mbum village of Delbé, which they renamed Ngaoundéré, after a nearby hill. Many Mbum converted to Islam and remained, though many others migrated north. The town became the seat of the lamidat of Ardo Ndjobdi.

Beginning around 1835, Fulbe immigrants streamed into the newly conquered territories in large numbers. By 1850, the Fulbe were firmly entrenched in northern Cameroon. Native populations were subjugated and placed under the rule of the local lamidos. Native populations were forced to convert to Islam, face enslavement, or flee. Fulbe merchants accepted salt and horses from North Africa in exchange for slaves for sale in the Muslim empires to the north. A smaller number of slaves went south for the trans-Atlantic market.

Those groups who resisted had no choice but to flee to the unforgiving mountains or else to the jungle south. Those groups who were immediate neighbours to the warring Fulbe, such as the Vute and Gbaya, dislodged others who lay in their path, such as Cameroon&#x27;s Bantu peoples. The Fulbe jihads thus served as the single most important event in the peopling of southern Cameroon. The jihad only served to depopulate Cameroon&#x27;s north, however. The Fulbe invaders did not set up new settlements. Rather, they used their conquered lands as pasture for their cattle. Many of these groups were still migrating when they came into contact with Cameroon&#x27;s new colonisers: The Germans.

===European contacts===

British explorers were the first Europeans to enter Adamawa territory when they came in 1822. The German Dr. Gustav Nachtigal was the first Westerner to explore the region extensively, which he did between 1869 and 1873. Nachtigal kept a keen eye out to notice what groups lived in the region, what their relations were like with their neighbours, and what resources could possibly be exploited from the area. The British Eduard E. Flegel followed Nachtigal in 1882. He explored the Adamawa emirate, setting up trade and reaching as far south as Banyo. He died in 1883, however, still on expedition, and peaceful contact between the West and the Fulbe empire came to an end. Instead, Germany annexed part of Adama&#x27;s empire in 1884, and the other part became part of British Nigeria. As far as Europe was concerned, the Adama emirate no longer existed.

===German administration===

The Fulbe fiercely opposed German hegemony. The German governor Jesko von Puttkamer sent soldiers under Captain Von Kamptz to suppress the uprisings, and on 7 May 1899, Banyo became the first major town to surrender. Tibati fell a month later, and Ngaoundéré followed on 20 September 1901. The Adamawa Plateau was now largely pacified, and the Germans pushed north toward the important trade town of Garoua.

Germany eventually prevailed against the Fulbe, and the present Adamawa fell into the Ngaoundéré administrative area, or &quot;residency&quot;. From 1902 to 1903, Germany allowed most lamidos to stay in power, albeit under German supervision; rulers who refused to cooperate were replaced. The colonials also encouraged the Islamisation of the area&#x27;s non-Muslim inhabitants, as this would place them under the rule of the lamidos, who were already submissive to the German governor.

===French administration===

Germany&#x27;s 1916 defeat in Africa in World War I eventually gave control of the territory to the French, the region&#x27;s third occupying force in less than a century. The new governors placed the region in the Mora-Garoua administrative area with its capital at Garoua.

French colonial policies varied little from their German predecessors. Lamidos were left in nominal power, though they were expected to carry out French policies. France also did away with recalcitrant rulers, and by 1936, the region had 39 lamidos and one sultan. France&#x27;s main contribution to the region was its improvements to infrastructure. Road construction, in particular, accelerated during French rule, and the colonials had a road built from Foumban to Garoua via Banyo, Tibati, and Ngaoundéré.

In 1956, France made all of its West African colonies self-governing. André-Marie Mbida became the first premier of Cameroon. Mbida quickly alienated the Muslim north, however, when he introduced his Abong-Mbang Resolutions. One of these called for the &quot;democratisation&quot; of northern Cameroon, which the Muslim rulers feared was code for bringing an end to their influence. Muslim leaders thus threatened to secede from Cameroon and join French Chad unless the resolutions were recalled. The events eventually led to Mbida&#x27;s expulsion from the prime ministry and his replacement by Ahmadou Ahidjo, a Muslim from the country&#x27;s north.

===Post-independence===

Ahidjo became Cameroon&#x27;s first president after the country&#x27;s independence on 1 January 1960. He devoted substantial resources to developing his northern homeland, such as the extension of a road north from Yaoundé to better link Cameroon&#x27;s north and south. The railroad followed soon thereafter, construction beginning in 1961 and reaching Ngaoundéré ten years later.

The northern Muslims largely viewed the arrival of Cameroon&#x27;s second president, Paul Biya, suspiciously. This was largely due to an Ahidjo partisan named Moussa Yaya, whom Biya and the press accused of trying to turn the lamidos against the new leader. Biya enjoys some support in the province today, but his popularity is nowhere near as strong as in Cameroon&#x27;s south. Part of this is because Biya&#x27;s main activities in the north have been minimal. He split the North Province into three parts in 1983, thus creating the Far North Region (Cameroon), North, and Adamawa Provinces as they exist today. He also absorbed the University of Ngaoundéré into the national system.

In the first months of 2014, thousands of refugees fleeing the violence in the Central African Republic arrived in Cameroon via the border towns of the Adamawa Region, East Region, and North Region.

===2008 presidential decree abolishes provinces===

In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing &quot;Provinces&quot; and replacing them with &quot;Regions&quot;. Hence, all of the country&#x27;s ten provinces are now known as Regions.

==Geography==

===Land===

The Adamawa is one of Cameroon&#x27;s more geologically diverse areas. The Gotel and Mambila Mountains at the border with Nigeria are largely composed of granite, which gives way to crystalline and metamorphic rock such as mica, schists, and gneiss. These are often covered in volcanic basalt, a combination that dominates until the Faro River. East of this, granites once again prevail, though sedimentary rock forms the valley of the Mbéré River, and a zone of metamorphic rock surrounds this. The Lom River also rises in a region of metamorphic rock. Volcanic rock occurs in the northwest just east of the Gotel Mountains and northeast of Ngaoundéré, the provincial capital, along the border with the North Province.

Soils are mostly made up of brown or brownish-red laterites, the result of the annual shift between dry and wet conditions and soil wash on the mountains. Iron and aluminium content is high, which causes hardpans, duracrust, or cuirasses to form near the surface due to oxidation. The soil of the Lom valley is a lightly evolved composition of raw materials, as is that directly northwest of the Mbakaou Reservoir and directly west of the Faro River. The extreme northwest of the province has ferruginous soil instead, and many of the province&#x27;s mountains, including the Gotes and Mambilas, contain mixtures of several soil types.

==Drainage==

The Adamawa is sometimes dubbed the &quot;water tower&quot; of Cameroon, since a large number of the country&#x27;s rivers rise in the area. All of these fall into a tropical regime, with a period of high water from May to September during the rainy season, and a period of low water – or even complete dryness – from October to April. Some of these are subject to seasonal flooding as well, such as the Djérem in the area of the Mbakaou Reservoir. The province&#x27;s rivers fall into three different basins: those that ultimately flow into the Niger River, to Lake Chad, and to the Atlantic Ocean.

The Mayo Deo River rises in the Gotel Mountains and then flows into the North Province. The Faro River begins a short distance east of the Mayo Deo but follows a wide, arcing course east and north between the Vina division and the Faro and Deo division before entering the North Province (the two rivers eventually join).

Two major rivers lie in the Chad basin. The Mbéré rises north of the town of Meiganga and then flows northeast toward the border with the North Province and the Central Africa Republic. The headwaters of the Vina River flow just north of Ngaoundéré before the river enters the North Province. These two rivers eventually merge to form the Logone River.

The Mbam, Kim, and Djérem are the major rivers of the Atlantic basin. The Mbam and Kim both rise in the southwest before flowing into the Centre Province. The Djérem forms in eastern and western branches, which converge at the Mbakaou Reservoir. The river then flows south into the East Province. Due to the reservoir (which holds two million cubic metres of water), the Djérem forms an important source of hydroelectric power for Cameroon. Finally, the Lom rises about 60 km east of Meiganga before flowing south into the East Province. The Djérem eventually becomes the Sanaga River, and these other rivers ultimately empty into it.

A long history of volcanism has also created a number of crater lakes in the province, the results of collapsed volcanoes filling with water. Among the most well known are Lakes Tison (Tyson, Tisson) and Mbalang near Ngaoundéré.

===Relief===
Powerful geothermal forces have shaped the Adamawa. The province begins to the south as part of the South Cameroon Plateau. The land rises gently but unevenly until about 6 degrees latitude. Here begins the Adamawa Plateau, a band of terrain that ranges from 1,000 to 2,000 m in altitude (averaging about 1,100 m) and stretches from Nigeria to the CAR. Altitude dips to as low of 500 m in the Djérem and Mbéré valleys and at the border north of Ngaoundéré. The plateau continues to about 8 degrees north before descending to the Benué Depression in abrupt cliffs and active volcanoes (though this transitional zone is mostly in the North Province).

Faults also cut across the area, the major one being the Cameroon Fault, dating from the Cretaceous Period. The Mbang Mountains follow this fault in a rough cut toward the east. Other mountains dot the province, as well. The Mambilas stretch into the extreme southwest from Nigeria and the Northwest and West Provinces. The Gotels are north of these along the border with Nigeria. All of these mountains form part of the Cameroon Ridge. Tchabal Mbabo, in the Gotels, is the highest peak at 2,460 m.

===Plant and animal life===

The Adamawa&#x27;s vegetation has been shaped greatly by man. It was once highly forested, but repeated brush burning and cattle trampling have changed the terrain. In the south, this is Guinean savanna, a transitional zone between Cameroon&#x27;s forested south and desert north. On the plateau itself, the savanna continues, though it is less wooded. Grass cover is consistent and thick, and the original vegetation still survives in the river valleys.

What few trees dot the landscape are evergreen and deciduous until about 1800 m altitude, when ferns and bamboos become prevalent. Grasses are the dominant form of plant life throughout except in the few forested areas and in some regions of scrubby bush. In addition, the southwestern half of the Mayo-Banyo division is a more heavily forested woodland savanna.

The Adamawa has two national reserves. The first of these is the Parc National du Mbam et Djérem, which protects 4165 km2 in both the Adamawa and East Provinces. The park is notable for containing both large tracts of savanna and forest. In addition, a small portion of the Parc National de Boumba Ndjida extends into the territory from the North Province.

==Demographics==
===Settlement patterns===
The Adamawa is sparsely populated. Large swathes of land are devoted almost entirely to the use of Fulbe cattle herders, this pasture punctuated only by occasional settlements. The Cameroonian government has made efforts to persuade Fulbe herdsmen to adopt sedentary ways, but the nomadic traditions show little signs of change. Because the savanna has been pushing south, however, there is now a substantial amount of immigration to the Centre and East Provinces.

Ngaoundéré is one of Cameroon&#x27;s fastest growing cities due to its location at the terminus of Cameroon&#x27;s north–south railroad. The modern city is thus a sprawling mass of winding streets surrounding the traditional town. It is also a microcosm of the province&#x27;s ethnic diversity, as representatives of most of the Adamawa&#x27;s peoples can be found there.

The Mayo-Banyo division in the southwest has a slightly higher population density than the rest of the province, largely due to the highly concentrated Mambila and Konja of the Mambila Mountains and the Vute and Pere of the Gotel Mountains. The Pere are also known as the Kutin or Koutine, though this is in fact a highly derogatory term meaning &quot;dogs&quot; that was given to them by the Fulbe. The northern border also has a slightly higher population density than the Fulbe interior.

===People===
Language provides the most convenient means of categorising the Adamawa&#x27;s ethnic groups. The greatest number of peoples speak various Southern Bantoid languages. These Bantoid peoples primarily occupy the province&#x27;s western third, in the Faro and Deo and the Mayo-Banyo divisions. The Ndoro are the northernmost, living on the Nigerian border on the upper Mayo Deo. To their south lie the Nyem-Nyem, called Suga by the Mbum, in the northern third of Mayo-Banyo division and along the west bank of the Meng River. The Vute live south of them on the Nigerian border and in a second population centre on the southwestern bank of the Mbarkaou Reservoir. The Mambila inhabit the southwestern border, and the Konja lie inland from them along the Banyo-Bankim road. The Tikar are at the province&#x27;s southwestern corner, with territories extending into the neighbouring provinces.

Those peoples who speak Adamawa languages constitute the next major grouping. The Pere are farthest west of these, living in three main concentrations. The first is at the province&#x27;s northwest, north of Mayo-Baleo town. They have another centre at the village of Paro south of Tignère, and their third grouping on the Meng River. The Kali at the province&#x27;s northeast, along the North Province border centred at Bélél. The Mbum (Mboum) are the last group, occupying the town of Ngaoundal and its environs. East of Ngaoundéré are the Dii, who have larger territories in the North Province.

As speakers of an Ubangi language, the Gbaya make up another important grouping. Their territory spans the whole of the Mbéré division as well as a small area at the southwest of the Vina division. They continue south into the East Province.

The Fulbe make up an estimated 60% of the Adamawa&#x27;s population. They are further subdivided into two subgroups: the sedentary, or town, Fulbe and the pastoral Fulbe, or Bororo. The sedentary Fulbe are more numerous and inhabit most of the province&#x27;s major towns, including Banyo, Tibati, Tignère, and Ngaoundéré, the capital. Over years of intermixing with native populations, they have come to physically resemble their Sudanese neighbours. The pastoral Fulbe create only temporary settlements, preferring instead to range across the province and beyond with large herds of cattle. These Fulbe are lighter skinned than their town brethren, tall and thin, with aquiline features.

The Fulbe speak a Cameroonian dialect of the Senegambian language Fulfulde. Due to their historical hegemony of the territory, it also serves as a lingua franca. Other major languages include Bitare, Dii, Gbaya, Mambila, and Tikar. Most educated inhabitants also speak French.

===Religion===

Islam is followed by many in Adamawa, especially among the Fulbe majority. Even among them, however, there is a noted difference between the sedentary Fulbe, who are more religious, and the nomadic Bororo, who are often only nominally Muslim. Christianity has made many inroads, though Christians are in a distinct minority. Many of the tribes retain animist, or &quot;pagan&quot;, beliefs, particularly in the mountains near the Nigerian border.
===Climate===

The province&#x27;s high elevation lends it a relatively cool climate average between 22 and 25 degrees Celsius. However, specific conditions vary between the South Cameroon and Adamawa Plateaus. The former experiences an equatorial climate of the Guinea type with four seasons: a long, dry period from December to May, a short, wet period from May to June, a short, dry season from July to October, and finally a long, wet season from October to November.

The climate of the Adamawa Plateau is classified as tropical of the Sudan type. It has only two seasons; November begins the dry period, and April the wet. Rainfall here averages 900 to 1,500 mm per year and decreases further north. May and June are the wettest, with occasional tornadoes; August is another rainfall peak. In addition, temperatures dip from November to January, as conditions similar to those that cause winter in temperate climes take at least a tentative hold. Temperatures rise due to the Harmattan beginning in January, reaching a high in April. Torrential rains in May and June bring temperatures down once again.

A third climate type characterises the Adamawa&#x27;s southwest corner (most of the Mayo-Banyo division). This region experiences an equatorial climate of the Cameroon type. Rainfall is within 1,500 to 2,000 mm with a long dry period followed by a long wet period.

==Economy==

===Livestock===

The Adamawa&#x27;s economy is based almost entirely on one single thing: cattle, a Fulbe monopoly. The region&#x27;s low population, high humidity, and vast fields of grass make it ideal for grazing. Herdsmen rotate pastures, and they often construct watering holes or wells for themselves and their animals.

The close relationship between the Bororo and their herds lends a great cultural importance to a Fulbe&#x27;s number of cattle, and the more heads of cattle a man has, the wealthier he is. This often leads herders to never kill their animals, however, and to keep sick animals alive for fear of losing a portion of one&#x27;s net worth. Nevertheless, many Fulbe herders transport their cattle to the big markets of Yaoundé and Douala for sale (some make it as far as Gabon and Congo). The major transhumance paths are in the western third of the province and at the border with Chad.

Most of these animals are of the humpbacked zebu breed. Near Ngaoundéré and Banyo, these are called Fulani zebu, large and meaty animals with dark-brown hides and white spots. The nomadic Fulbe, on the other hand, herd Bororo zebu. These are leaner, lighter-coloured beasts that are better able to travel long distances.

The government-run Institut de Récherche Zootechniques (IZR) and SODEPA have established a handful of modern cattle ranches, as well. The major ones are near the villages of Laro, Wakwo and Ndokayo. Here, ranchers have bred new breeds of cattle by mixing native Fulbe animals with the American Brahmin. Government initiatives have also been instrumental in the eradication of the tsetse fly in the region.

Many ranchers and Bororo also raise horses and donkeys. In addition, the Adamawa has more goats and sheep than any other province, as these can live even in the larger towns. Pigs, however, are much less common due to the prevalence of Islam in the region.

===Agriculture===

Nearly all farming in the province is done at the sustenance level. Millet is the mainstay, though maize, and manioc are also important. Other crops, grown in smaller quantities, include cocoyams, yams, and groundnuts.

The Gbaya, Mbum, and Dourou are the region&#x27;s most prolific farmers, though even the herdsmen farm in the rainy season. Farms are typically small plots that are cleared or burned out of the brush and then planted during the dry season. Crops grow during the rainy season, when they are harvested. Because the dry season is so long, crops must be preserved, so most are transformed into grain, which is pounded by hand with mortar and pestle.

Cash crops play a small role in the region&#x27;s economy. SODEBLE grows wheat on 100 km2 at Wassandé, near Ngaoundéré. The southwestern Mayo-Banyo division also has some coffee plots. Other interests have established groundnut, millet, and wheat plantations in recent years.

===Industry===

The Adamawa has a bit of industry, most located in the capital. Much of this is tied to the region&#x27;s cattle-based economy. For example, leatherworking is an important industry in Ngaoundéré, as evidenced by the Société des Tanneries et Peausseries du Cameroun (STPC) factory. Rubber, perfume, and dairy products are also processed in the capital. Handicrafts, including woodworking and mat weaving, form another sector. Tin is mined near Mayo Darlé and the Nigerian border and southwest of Banyo, and bauxite is mined near Ngaoundal and Minim-Martap. Mineral water is obtained at Doungué.

===Transport ===

Ngaoundéré is the gateway to the province, and it is most easily accessible from southern Cameroon via the &quot;Transcam II&quot; rail line. The trip takes between 12 and 30 hours, but the presence of couchettes makes the journey bearable for those who can afford them. Other passengers are crammed into all available seats, however, including those in the dining car. Due to the overcrowded conditions, thieves are another hazard.

Road travel from the south is also possible, but this is limited to poor roads from the Centre Province or else a long detour through the East Province, where the roads are not much better. Roads within the Adamawa itself are mostly unpaved and are often in poor condition (particularly south of Ngaoundéré) due to little maintenance. The road north from Ngaoundéré into the North Province is paved, however, meaning that those traveling via train can continue to the North and Far North without too much discomfort. National Road 6 enters the province from Foumban in the West Province and continues on to Banyo, Tibati, and Meïganga. National Road 15 comes from Sangbé in the Centre Province to Tibati and on to Ngaoundéré.

A regional airport services Ngaoundéré with flights to Yaoundé, Douala, Garoua, and Maroua. Tignère, Banyo, Ngaoundal, Tibati, and the Mbakaou Reservoir all have airstrips.

===Tourism===

Most travellers see the Adamawa only briefly as they transition at Ngaoundéré from the train to a bus further north. The province does see some visitors who are interested in the region&#x27;s rich cultural history. A number of lamidos allow tourists to visit their palaces, for example, such as the ruler of Ngo, who receives nobles every Friday and Sunday. The province also has numerous scenic destinations ranging from crater lakes to caves and waterfalls.

==Administration and social conditions==

What social inequalities exist in the Adamawa largely stem from the region&#x27;s high level of cultural homogeneity. Most people in the province are Muslim Fulbe, and those who are not often fall prey to racism and discrimination, especially in more rural areas. The Cameroonian government has made efforts to encourage the region&#x27;s nomads to settle, but so far has made little progress.

With its low population, the Adamawa holds little import to Cameroonian politicians. However, the Fulbe tribe is spread throughout the country, especially in the three northern provinces, and together they form a significant bloc that Cameroonian politicians cannot easily ignore. This is one way that Cameroon&#x27;s greater north is able to oppose policies more favourable to the south.

===Government===
Adamawa is composed of five departments (&quot;):
# Djérem, with its capital at Tibati
# Faro-et-Déo, with its headquarters in Tignère
# Mayo-Banyo, with its capital in Banyo
# Mbéré, headed from Meiganga
# Vina, governed from Ngaoundéré

A presidentially appointed prefect (&quot;), or senior divisional officer, governs each of these. The president also appoints the governor, whose offices are in Ngaoundéré.

====Traditional political organisation====

Lamidos, traditional Muslim rulers, still hold great sway over their Fulbe subjects. Most large towns in the province have a lamido, and many smaller villages do as well. The various lamidos elect councilors to serve them; these may come from both Fulbe and other tribal groups. The Cameroonian government permits these rulers to hold their own courts and to keep their own jails, something human rights groups have pointed to as problematic.

Most other tribes in the region are nominally under the rule of a chief. However, these men are mostly just figureheads today. Among the Tikar, however, these individuals still hold a substantial amount of power. A group of advisers, or &quot;Council of Notables&quot;, serves each Tikar chief. Below them are various ward heads (&#x27;) who govern a specific portion of a village or town. The quarter chiefs (&#x27;) hold sway over a particular neighbourhood.

===Education===

The Adamawa&#x27;s education level is generally very low. The nomadic Bororo rarely send their children to school. Meanwhile, town Fulbe often marry their daughters off early into puberty, and married girls do not go to school. The province has an estimated 80% illiteracy rate.

Another obstacle is lack of schools and teachers. Most schools are located in larger towns or in the capital, meaning that students often must travel long distances or live away from home, particularly at the secondary level. In addition, Cameroonian teachers who are assigned to the province often refuse to go on account of its remoteness.

===Health===

Most of the Adamawa&#x27;s towns have some form of health provider, if only a small clinic. The capital also has a hospital. The region&#x27;s major health concern is lack of sanitation. This is especially pronounced in the increasingly urbanised Ngaoundéré. Another concern is HIV and AIDS. Official government figures give the province an HIV-infection rate of 17%, the highest in the country. These numbers come from samples in Ngaoundéré only, however, and infection rates in more rural areas are probably lower.

===Cultural life===

The Adamawa maintains a lively traditional culture. One notable example is the Menang, a Tikar dance. Performers may dance for any number of reasons, from aiding warriors to celebrating women&#x27;s sensuality. Births, funerals, and weddings are often occasion for grand celebration among the region&#x27;s non-Muslim populations, as well.

<text>James Anson Otho Brooke VC (3 February 1884 – 29 October 1914) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
Brooke was from a landed gentry family, the eldest of five sons and two daughters of Harry Vesey Brooke, JP, DL, of Fairley, Countesswells, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, who had served as a captain in the 92nd Gordon Highlanders, and Patricia, daughter of James Gregory Moir-Byres, of a landed gentry family of Tonley, Aberdeenshire from which came the architect, antiquary and art dealer James Byres. Brooke&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Sir Arthur Brinsley Brooke, 2nd Baronet, whose descendant, the 5th Baronet, was created Viscount Brookeborough.

Brooke was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Gordon Highlanders 11 October 1905, joining the 1st Battalion of the regiment at Cork in Ireland.

==Military career==
Having been promoted to lieutenant in 1907, Brooke was transferred to the 2nd Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, British Army, based in India until 1913, then in Egypt until the outbreak of the First World War, when they were ordered to the front, Brooke serving as senior subaltern and assistant adjutant. The following deed took place during the First Battle of Ypres for which he was awarded the VC.

Lieutenant Brooke was posthumously promoted to captain, effective to September 1914.

==Memorials==
Captain Brooke&#x27;s remains were interred at Zantvoorde British Cemetery (CWGC), Zonnebeke, Belgium (near Ypres). His name also appears on the family grave at Springbank Cemetery, Aberdeen.

His name also appears on Aberdeen War Memorial, Colebrook War Memorial, St Ronan&#x27;s Church Memorial, and Enniskillen War Memorial. A 21 cm mortar he captured is on display at Enniskillen Castle.

A Victoria Cross commemorate stone bearing his name was laid at Kingswells Hall near Aberdeen in October 2014 to mark the centenary of the award. The hall was built with the help of Brooke and the church war memorial sited opposite also bears his name.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Gordon Highlanders Museum in Aberdeen, Scotland.

<doc id="1211744" wikidata="Q165784" url="?curid=1211744" title="West Region (Cameroon)">
<text>The West Region () is 14,000 km2 of territory located in the central-western portion of the Republic of Cameroon. It borders the Northwest Region to the northwest, the Adamawa Region to the northeast, the Centre Region to the southeast, the Littoral Region to the southwest, and the Southwest Region to the west. The West Region is the smallest of Cameroon&#x27;s ten regions in area, yet it has the highest population density.

As home to the enterprising Bamum and Bamileke kingdoms, the West is an economic bright spot and one of Cameroon&#x27;s more developed regions. This progressive development is tempered by the strong traditional culture that persists among the Bamileke and the province&#x27;s other major ethnic group, the Bamum (sometimes &quot;Bamoum&quot;, &quot;Bamun&quot;, &quot;Bamoun&quot;).

==Geography==
===Land===

The West sits at the geologic crossroads of Cameroon; the soil varies greatly within a relatively small land area. The land along the Noun River and at the Bamendjing Reservoir, for example, is a lightly evolved blend of various raw minerals. The province&#x27;s western half, on the other hand, is a haphazard mixture of raw minerals, granite, ferrallitic patches of red dirt, and other types. Finally, the soil of the eastern portions away from the reservoir is ferrallitic. Rocks in the area range from the volcanic along the reservoir and Noun to Precambrian deposits of crystalline rocks such as granite and gneiss under a cover of basaltic rock in the northwest. Metamorphic rocks like gneiss and mica dominate the rest of the territory. The soil throughout is mostly red in color due to high iron content, though that of the northwest is black or brown basalt. The province&#x27;s soils are the richest and most productive in Cameroon.

===Drainage===

The West&#x27;s mountainous terrain and active tectonics create many fast-moving rivers with picturesque falls and isolated crater lakes. These rivers follow a Cameroon regime, experiencing a period of high waters during the wet season and a period of low waters in the dry period. The rivers all form part of the Atlantic basin.

The Mbam River runs along the border with the Centre and Southeast Provinces. The Nkam is the name for the headwaters of the Wouri River, which flow from the West&#x27;s Bamboutos Mountains. The eastern branch through the area rises northwest of Bangangté, and the western branch forms the border with the Littoral Province southwest of Bafang. These headwaters are subject to seasonal flooding. The Noun River, a tributary of the Sanaga, flows from the Centre Province, around Bafoussam, and to the Bamendjing Reservoir. This man-made lake is created by a dam on the Noun River, which helps regulate the Sanaga at Edéa in the Littoral Province and is thus an important component in Cameroon&#x27;s supply of hydroelectric power. Falls are common, such as the Balatchi, Metché, and Tsugning Falls.

Most of the West&#x27;s lakes are crater lakes formed from collapsed volcanoes. Such lakes exist at Balent, Banéfo, Doupé, and near Foumban. Many of these still have active volcanoes at their bottoms, particularly in the northwest on the Western High Plateau. One example is Lake Baleng, northeast of Bafoussam, and the twin lakes of Foumbot. These volcanoes can cause deposits of gas to build up at the lakebed until poisonous gases finally bubble to the surface. Such an eruption at Lake Monoun killed 37 villagers near Foumbot on 15 and 16 August 1984.

===Relief===

The Bamboutos Mountains are the West&#x27;s primary land feature. Elevations reach as high as 2,000 metres and dip as low as 500 metres in the Noun and Nkam valleys. The highest point is Mt. Bamboutos, a dormant volcano west of Mbouda, at 2,740 metres. These mountains lie along the Cameroon Fault, dating from the Cretaceous, which runs roughly parallel to the border with the Northwest Province and through the capital of Bafoussam. West of the Cameroon Mountains lies the Western High Plateau, with elevations of 1,000-2,500 metres. South of the fault, the land descends in steps until levelling off at the South Cameroon Plateau. Here, terrain is gentler, with large hills separated by deep valleys.

===Climate===

High elevations and moderate to high humidity give the West one of Cameroon&#x27;s more pleasant climates. Temperatures average a cool 22˙, and rainfall is moderate. Except for the southeasternmost portions, the West experiences two major seasons in lieu of the traditional four: the year begins in a long, dry period of little rain, which runs until May, then the rains begin in May or June and last until October or November. Though the transition is gradual, the southeastern reaches of the province are part of the South Cameroon Plateau and thus have four seasons: the long dry season from December to March, the short rainy season from March to June, the short dry season from June to August, and the long rainy season from September to December.

The climate is equatorial of the Cameroon sub-variety in the northwestern third and equatorial of the Guinea type in the southeastern two-thirds. Rainfall, moderated by the mountains, averages 1,000-2,000 mm per year throughout, though it is highest at the area of the Bamendjing Reservoir.

===Plant and animal life===

Very little of the West&#x27;s original flora or fauna survives, since most land has been cleared by human farmers. This is particularly evident on the Western High Plateau, where poor soil and less rainfall have exacerbated the effects of deforestation, turning the area into grassland. The Melap Reserve (&quot;Réserve de Melap&quot;) near Foumban is one heavily wooded area, but it is more of a city park than an actual reserve.

East of the Noun River, the terrain is primarily covered in woodland savanna of the Sahel type, which forms a transitional zone to the lowly vegetated northern provinces. West of that river, this savanna is of the Sudan type, and is interspersed among open, dry forest. A few small patches of rain forest persist to the west of the Mbam River in the Noun division. As elevation increases, forests thin out, until they are replaced by ferns and bamboos at 1,800 metres. Trees throughout shed their leaves during the dry season as protection against brush fires.
==Demographics==
===Settlement patterns===

The West&#x27;s population density is high in general, especially in the towns of Bafoussam, Dschang, Mbouda, and Bafang. This is due to the pleasant climate and fertile soils. Bafoussam is both the provincial capital and the centre of the Bamileke lands. Populations thin out toward the southern border and in the eastern Bamum-dominated territories. Settlements are scattered.

The region experiences significant out-migration, particularly when the vast plantations of the Southwest Province hire workers for annual harvests. Permanent emigration is mainly by those who wish to escape the overcrowded conditions and to farm larger pieces of land, and is directed mainly to the Southwest and Littoral Provinces.

Bamileke homes are traditionally made of dried earth placed on a bamboo frame and covered by a thatched roof. Farm plots separated by fences surround the typical home. Houses of this type are seldom seen today, however, though barns are still constructed using these methods. The last bastion of traditional architecture are the many chiefs&#x27; compounds that dot the province. These are characterized by their tall, conical roofs, bamboo and clay-brick walls, and carved poles around the entryway. The typical layout places a central audience chamber in front of other rooms for individuals of progressively lower rank.

===People===

Two major tribal groups dominate the West: the Bamileke and the Bamum.
Both of these are considered semi-Bantu or grassfields Bantu. The Bamileke are the more numerous, estimated to number 3 million or more. They are concentrated southeast of the Bamboutos Mountains and west of the Noun River. Their major settlements are at Bafoussam, Bandjoun, Bafang, Bawaju, Bangangté, Dschang, and Mbouda. They organise themselves in sub-groups, each under the rule of a different chief. Examples are the Fe&#x27;fe&#x27;, Ghomala, Kwa&#x27;, Medumba, Mengaka, Nda&#x27;nda&#x27;, Ngomba, Ngombale, Ngiemboon, and Yemba. Most of these groups speak a unique language, though all are closely related. Most Bamileke are Christian, with Catholics in the majority.

The Bamum people are the area&#x27;s other major ethnic group. They are a subgroup of the Tikar, though they speak a language called Bamum. They are primarily Islamic, and all are ruled by a sultan in their tribal capital, Foumban.

Other languages spoken in the province include Bamenyam, Mbo, and Tikar. Most educated inhabitants also speak French.

==Economy==

The West is one of Cameroon&#x27;s soundest economic areas due primarily to its agricultural prosperity and the enterprising traditions of the Bamileke people. In areas that do not have a daily market, market days are typically every eighth day (the Bamileke follow an eight-day week).

===Agriculture===
====Subsistence farming====

The Bamileke are skilled farmers who exploit virtually every strip of land available. Along with the neighbouring Northwest Province, the West supplies most of the food consumed in Cameroon&#x27;s seven lower provinces. Tools are largely traditional. Farmers plant after the first rains in fields consisting of alternating ridges and furrows. In the past, farmers practiced field rotation, allowing land to lie fallow for two or three years. Due to increasing population density, however, they use the land almost continuously today; the loss in fertility is partially countered through extensive use of fertilisers and manure. Hedges or fences that separate private plots and keep out animals surround farms in the West. These hedges also provide firewood and help prevent from soil erosion. In the Southeast, farmers sometimes place fields in forest clearings where they use slash-and-burn agriculture.

Maize is the major staple, and farmers surround rows of it with cocoyams, plantains, beans, groundnuts, melons, and yams. Potatoes are another mainstay, and the West is one of the few places in Cameroon where they grow well due to high elevations in the region. Farmers grow these crops on the hillsides and use the valleys to plant cocoyams, colocasia, and raffia palms. In the western Wouri valley, rice is also important.

====Plantation agriculture====

Population pressures prevent entrepreneurs from establishing large plantations more prevalently in the West. Coffee is the major cash crop, with large fields in the regions of Bafoussam, Foumbot, and Dschang and powerful supervision by Union des Cooperatives de Café Arabica de l&#x27;Ouest (UCCAO). Cocoa is also important, particularly in the lowlands. Tea is grown commercially near Dschang. Some rice cultivation takes place under the Upper Noun Development Company (UNVDA) in the southeast, largely due to government projects. Tobacco from Mbouda and Foumbot stays within the province for local consumption, though the Bastos Company of Yaoundé processes some for export.

====Livestock====

Livestock raising was once practiced more widely, but as populations have risen, most land has been converted to crop cultivation (a fact that has raised tensions between herders and farmers). Still, some herders drive cattle using transhumance methods in the northwestern half of the province, and the Kounden area is home to some modern ranching. Ranchers sell these animals, which account for 10% of Cameroon&#x27;s beef, mostly in the Douala market.

Many farmers raise sheep and goats in the southeastern half of the province. Increasingly common these days are poultry and pigs, which can live in pens on smaller farms. In fact, the majority of Cameroon&#x27;s pork comes from the region, and a large government-run poultry farm operates at Kounden. Smallholder farmers, especially women, keep domestic cavies in their homesteads that may provide more protein to family nutrition than any other meat source.

The Bamendjing is also the site of traditional fishing, and professional fisheries operate at Foumban.

===Industry===

The West is home to relatively little industry. The area&#x27;s few factories are almost all devoted to food processing, with plants in Bafoussam (beer, instant coffee), Foumbot, Dschang, and Kékem. The building materials, pharmaceuticals, and bauxite mining industries also have a presence.

Arts and crafts form the heart of the West&#x27;s production. Particularly renowned are the goods produced by Bamum cooperatives at Foumban. These include intricately decorated ceramics made from Foumban&#x27;s high-quality clay, woodworking, brass and bronze casting, and cotton textiles, often featuring elaborate embroidery. The Bamileke are also skilled artisans, with their own cooperative at Bafoussam.

===Transportation ===

With such a small land area and large network of mostly paved roads, the West is one of Cameroon&#x27;s more accessible provinces. Major routes through the area include National Road 4 to Yaoundé, National Road 5 from Békoko to Bandjoun, and National Road 6 (dubbed &quot;la Transafricaine&quot;) from Ekok, Mamfe and Bamenda in the Northwest Province through Mbouda and Foumban to Banyo and beyond in the Adamawa. Bafoussam forms an important nexus between the cities of Bamenda, Douala, Yaoundé, and Foumban. Roads often must wind and sharply turn to traverse the region&#x27;s mountains, and traffic accidents are not uncommon. The region is reachable by air via domestic airports at Bafoussam and Koutaba and an airstrip at Dschang.

===Tourism===

With its legions of artisans and its lavish sultan&#x27;s palace, Foumban forms the West&#x27;s main tourist draw. Visitors also come to experience the region&#x27;s magnificent scenery and rich traditional culture.

==Administration and social conditions==

The West&#x27;s high population and economic dominance lend it great political importance. However, Cameroon&#x27;s government and state-run media, largely run by President Paul Biya&#x27;s numerically inferior Beti-Pahuin tribal group, are often accused of anti-Bamileke bias. The Bamileke thus stand to gain a great deal from a more free and transparent government, and the West harbors many sympathisers for the presidential party&#x27;s main opponents, the Social Democratic Front.

===Government===

The West consists of eight divisions or departments (&quot;departements&quot;), each headed by a prefect (&quot;prefet&quot;), or senior divisional officer. The president appoints all of these officers and the provincial governor in Bafoussam. A special urban council presides over Bafoussam, staffed by presidentially appointed counselors who serve under a presidentially appointed delegate.

The departments are:
# Noun
# Ndé
# Haut-Nkam
# Ménoua
# Mifi
# Bamboutos
# Hauts-Plateaux
# Koung-Khi
The Noun department, headquartered at Foumban, is the largest division geographically and occupies most of the Bamum territories bordering the Adamawa and Centre Provinces. The Ndé department is southwest of this with its capital at Bangangté. The Haut-Nkam (Upper Nkam) department, whose capital is Bafang, is further west, and the Ménoua department borders it to the northwest with its capital at Dschang. The Mifi department, with its capital Bafoussam, forms the centre of the region, and it is hemmed in by a handful of smaller divisions: the Bamboutos department, headquartered at Mbouda, the Hauts-Plateaux (High Plateaus) department, governed from Baham, and the Koung-Khi department, governed from Bandjoun. These latter two divisions were recently formed due to population booms in the area.

====Traditional political organisation====

Traditional rulers still hold substantial power in the province. A sultan, whose palace and head of government are in Foumban, rules the Bamum. Bamum tradition claims an unbroken line of succession since 1394.

The Bamileke, in contrast, are divided into over 100 groups, each headed by a chief (&quot;fon&quot;, &quot;foyn&quot;, or &quot;fo&quot;). The chiefs are themselves divided into various ranks, with major rulers living in Bandjoun, Bafang, Bangangté, Dschang, and Mbouda. Traditionally, chiefs command divine powers and own all lands by divine mandate. Individual tenants work plots at their chief&#x27;s behest. These groupings thus form the basis for Bamileke tribal identity. Advisers, often called the “Council of Notables”, in turn serve the chiefs. Below them are various district chiefs who govern individual wards in the village.

===Education===

With nearly 1,000 schools serving its some 1,000 villages, the West relatively well provisioned educationally. The high population density contributes to classroom overcrowding, however. Students must often travel to nearby towns in order to pursue higher levels of education, since most villages do not have secondary schools. The province is also the location of a bilingual university at Dschang as well as the private Université des Montagnes in Bangangté.

===Health===

Hospitals and health clinics are fairly prevalent in the region. The area&#x27;s pleasant climate keeps it largely mosquito-free, so malaria is not a problem as in much of the rest of Cameroon. Lack of sanitation is a serious issue, as this leads to outbreaks of dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and other ailments, especially in the more urbanised centres.

===Cultural life===

The West has a lively traditional culture. The Bamum observe traditional Muslim holy days, such as Ramadan and the Feast of the Ram. They also hold an annual cultural festival called the Ngouon. Bamileke festivals vary from tribe to tribe, and most are held during the dry season or for special events such as funerals or the birth of twins. Some examples are the Macabo Festival of Bangoua, the Medumba Festival of Bangangté, and the Ben Skin Dance, a dance of female sensuality that has grown increasingly commercialised.

A number of museums celebrate the West&#x27;s history and traditions. Among these are the Musée du Palais du Sultan Bamun, the Musée des Arts et des Traditions Bamoun, and the Musée Sacré Djissé, all in Foumban. The Musée de la Chefferie Bandjoun is the region&#x27;s largest repository of Bamileke artifacts.

==History==
===Early population movements===

Human beings have inhabited the West since prehistoric times, as evidenced by archaeological finds at Galima and Foumban. Bamileke groups likely entered the area from the Adamawa Plateau in the 17th century, probably fleeing Fulbe (Fula) slave raids. They originally settled in what is now Bamum territory, but the Bamum forced them across the Noun in a series of wars in the 18th century. Bamileke tradition states that they migrated in three major groups. The first consisted of the Baleng, Bapi, and Bafussam (who founded the settlement at Bafoussam along with the Bamougoum). Next came the Bagam, Bamendu, Bamsoa, Bazu, and Bangu. The final wave consisted of the Bati and Bafangwa. This period also saw the Bamileke assimilation of several older populations.

Bamum tradition claims their kingdom was founded when Ncharé Yen led them to settle at Foumban (Mfom-Ben) in the 15th century. However, most scholars today place this migration as late as the 19th century, likely the result of population pressures caused by the same Fulbe jihads that had earlier pushed the Bamileke south. The king Mbwe-Mbwe extended Bamum holdings from the Mbam to the Noun Rivers, subjugating numerous local rulers in the process. Mbwe-Mbwe also kept the Fulbe from encroaching further south and west.

The Bamum experienced a golden age of sorts under the leadership of Sultan Ibrahim Njoya (r. 1886–1933). Njoya was a patron of learning, and he converted to Islam under the tutelage of numerous Muslim scholars he had allowed into the kingdom. He developed an alphabet for the Bamum language (the Shumon script), and established schools to teach it. The Islamisation of the Bamum occurred during his reign.

The Bali-Chamba are the third major group to have pushed through the West Province territory in historical times. They came under the leadership of a warrior chief named Gawolbe and crossed the Noun around 1825. In 1830, they fought a war with the Bamileke Bafu-Fundong group near Dschang. Their leader, Gawolbe II died, and the tribe splintered as Gawolbe&#x27;s seven sons fought for control. Most of these groups migrated further west into what is today the Northwest Province.

===European contacts===

===German administration===

The area had only indirect contact with European powers (mostly due to slave raids by tribes further south) before the German annexation of the Cameroons in 1884. The first Europeans to enter the territory were representatives of the Basel Mission in 1897. The Germans themselves did not move into the territory until 1899 (though they had signed treaties with Bamileke leaders as early as 1884). Governor Jesko Von Puttkamer established the Gesellschaft Nordwest-Kamerun to monopolise trade in the area, and he established the divisional capital at Dschang in 1903. The area&#x27;s cool temperatures drew many German settlers, and the colonisers established great coffee plantations, which they forced the natives to work. Larger plantations were established further south, and many Bamileke were forced or encouraged to move out of their traditional territories to work them. The Germans also set up a puppet over-chief for all the Bamileke, who had never before considered themselves a single group. Catholic missionaries reached the grasslands area in 1910. By 1912, most of the Bamileke had converted to Christianity.

Sultan Njoya welcomed the first German emissary to the Bamum kingdom in 1902 after hearing of the ruthless treatment given rebellious tribes further to the northwest. He even lent military support for the German campaign against the Nso near Bamenda in 1906. The Bamum soldiers, eager for revenge for an earlier defeat to the Nso in 1888, committed such atrocities that the Germans sent them back. Njoya also ordered the building of a palace at Foumban in 1917, which he modeled after that of the German governor.

===French administration===

Bamileke and Bamum territory fell to the French in 1916 after the Germans&#x27; defeat in World War I. The territory became part of the Baré-Foumban-Nkongsamba administrative area, and the capital was moved to Foumban. Dschang served as the seat of a French-run school for the sons of chiefs, which the French used to indoctrinate as well as instruct. The French maintained German plantations and labour sources, and new operations sprung up, such as a palm plantation at Dschang. The new colonial overlords made improvements to the region&#x27;s infrastructure, as well, especially to the road network.

The French continued Germany&#x27;s policy of propping up sympathetic chiefs and deposing recalcitrant ones. They sought some sort of administrative centre amid the Bamileke domains, and in 1926, Fotso II of the Bandjoun people offered the site of Bafoussam, neighbouring his domains but not actually part of them. Mambou, chief of the area, opposed the colonials, but he was defeated, and the foundations of modern Bafoussam were laid. The Bamum did not escape the French sphere, either, as sultan Ibrahim Njoya was deposed in 1931 due to his pro-German views. Njoya died in a Yaoundé prison two years later.

After World War II, the West was a centre of political pressure and protest against colonial rule. Other groups came into being to combat these (usually with France&#x27;s blessing), including the Union Bamiléké in 1948. In 1956, France granted self-rule to its colony, and the West proved one of Cameroon&#x27;s more politically influential areas due to groups such as Paysans Independants and the Assemblée Traditionnale Bamoun. The population boomed between 1958 and 1965, a period of high urbanisation in Cameroon.

In 1958, Ahmadou Ahidjo became prime minister of French Cameroon with a pro-independence platform. The powerful Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) party, including many Bamileke, considered him a French puppet and opposed him. On 27 June 1959, several Bamileke areas were struck in what were later labeled terrorist strikes. Ahidjo declared martial law. His later attitudes toward the Bamileke likely were strongly influenced by their opposition to him.

===Post-independence===

Under Ahidjo, the current West Province was known as the Administrative Inspectorate of the West. He named Bafoussam the capital and set the province&#x27;s current boundaries after union of British and French Cameroon in 1972.

Ahidjo&#x27;s battles with the UPC continued past Cameroon&#x27;s independence on 1 January 1960. He outlawed the party&#x27;s &quot;terrorist&quot; wing on 30 October 1963, leading to more strikes in Bamileke population centres and subsequent military retribution.

What support Ahidjo did enjoy among the Bamileke largely came from his pro-business policies. When the president resigned in 1982, his replacement, Paul Biya, sent his representative, Moussa Yaya, to reassure the West&#x27;s businessmen that he would not prove unfriendly to their interests. Yaya mistrusted Biya, however, and only exacerbated Bamileke reservations. The Bamum, as well, were reluctant to see Cameroon&#x27;s presidency change from a Muslim to a Christian. Much Bamileke and Bamum resentment for the Biya administration dates to this period.

In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, Paul Biya, signed decrees abolishing &quot;Provinces&quot; and replacing them with &quot;Regions&quot;. Hence, all of the country&#x27;s ten provinces are now known as Regions.

<text>Corymb is a botanical term for an inflorescence with the flowers growing in such a fashion that the outermost are borne on longer pedicels than the inner, bringing all flowers up to a common level. A corymb has a flattish top with a superficial resemblance towards an umbel, and may have a branching structure similar to a panicle. Flowers in a corymb structure can either be parallel, or alternate, and form in either a convex, or flat form.

Many species in the Maloideae, such as hawthorns and rowans, produce their flowers in corymbs. The Norway maple and yerba maté are also examples of corymbs.

The word &quot;corymb&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word meaning &quot;bunch of flowers or fruit&quot;.

<text>The Boozefighters Motorcycle Club (BFMC) motorcycle club was founded in California after the end of World War Two. 

== Foundation: Wino Willie Forkner ==
Its founder was William Clyde &quot;Wino Willie&quot; Forkner Jr. had served in the military during World War Two and had a difficult time adjusting to civilian life after the war. He had been a member of the 13 Rebels Motorcycle Club for two years prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. His nickname &quot;Wino Willie&quot; had come about at age 12 because he liked to drink red wine. 

During the war, he had risen in the ranks of the Army Air Corps and then fallen again as the result of a drunken incident in a bar. After it ended, he re-joined the 13 Rebels. In 1946, he had his membership stripped from him by the other members after an incident at a quarter-mile race in San Diego where he got bored and drunk. He drove his own motorcycle through a wooden gate onto the racetrack, around the track, and eventually lost control.

Disillusioned, drunk, and angry, one evening he and three other former servicemen were drinking at the All-American Bar in Los Angeles. They decided to form a new motorcycle club themselves, taking the name from a shouted suggestion from a fellow bar patron named Walt Porter. They overheard their conversation to &quot;Call it the Boozefighters.&quot; The four recruited another 16 members, all war veterans with one exception, Jim Morrison, a teenager, and applied for AMA membership, with C. B. Clauson, former paratrooper, as the club president.
Forkner later reported that the AMA president declined the application stating that &quot;No goddam way am I giving a name like that to a charter.&quot;

The club began to grow, having three chapters (in Los Angeles, San Pedro, and San Francisco), by 1947. Members of all three attended the Hollister riot that year. The L.A. chapter got drunk before it even arrived at Hollister, starting out on the Thursday before the weekend by drinking in the All-American Bar, driving to Santa Barbara, drinking there, driving to San Luis Obispo where they were too drunk to drive on that day and decided to sleep in a bus terminal, driving on the next day to King City, buying more alcohol from a liquor store, and then driving on.

Wino Willie was mistakenly arrested at the riot, for purportedly inciting a riot and a jailbreak of other bikers who had already been arrested, when in fact he was trying to do the opposite and talk the mob out of staging a jailbreak.

When racing, Wino Willie wore the colors of another motorcycle club, the Yellow Jackets, rather than Boozefighters colors.

== Later years ==
The movie &quot;The Wild One&quot;, which Wino Willie initially consulted on but eventually resigned from over the way that bikers were being portrayed, boosted membership of the club during the 1950s.
Club membership then shrank, as members retired or died during the 1960s, only for its numbers to swell again because of the Vietnam War as it was joined once again by ex-servicemen.

By the 21st century it had grown to become an international organization, with chapters in various European countries, Canada, The Philippines, South Korea and Japan.
