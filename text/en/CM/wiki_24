<text>The Guinea baboon (Papio papio) is a baboon from the Old World monkey family. Some (older) classifications list only two species in the genus &quot;Papio&quot;, this one and the hamadryas baboon. In those classifications, all other &quot;Papio&quot; species are considered subspecies of &quot;P. papio&quot; and the species is called the savanna baboon.

The Guinea baboon inhabits a small area in western Africa. Its range includes Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, southern Mauritania and western Mali. Its habitat includes dry forests, gallery forests, and adjoining bush savannas or steppes. It has reddish-brown hair, a hairless, dark-violet or black face with the typical dog-like muzzle, which is surrounded by a small mane, and a tail carried in a round arc. It also has limb modifications that allow it to walk long distances on the ground. The Guinea baboon is one of the smallest baboon species, weighing between 13 and 26 kg (28.6–57 lbs). Their life spans are generally between 20 and 50 years.

It is a diurnal and terrestrial animal, but sleeps in trees or high rocks at night, away from predators. The number of suitable sleeping trees limits the group size and the range. It lives in troops of up to 200 individuals, each with a set place in a hierarchy. Group living provides protection from predators such as the lion and various hyena species. Like all baboons, it is an omnivorous highly opportunistic feeder, eating fruits, buds, roots, bark, grasses, greens, seeds, tubers, leaves, nuts, cereals, insects, worms, birds and small mammals. Because it will eat practically anything available, the Guinea baboon is able to occupy areas with limited resources or harsh conditions. Its presence may help improve habitats because it digs for water and spreads seeds in its waste, encouraging plant growth.

The Guinea baboon is a highly communicative animal. It communicates by using a variety of vocalizations and physical interactions. In addition to vocalizations to each other, this animal has vocal communications apparently intended to be received and interpreted by predators.

Due to its small range and the loss of its habitat, the Guinea baboon is classified as &quot;near threatened&quot; by the IUCN.

== Physical description ==

Baboon refers to the large-bodied primates with marked sexual dimorphism and having females and young that are dependent on males for protection. Guinean baboons have a red tone to their fur, and are sometimes referred to as the red baboon. They lack hair on their hindquarters, and their faces are black with yellow-brown sideburns. Females&#x27; rumps are pink in color and males have a mane of fur around their heads and shoulders. A characteristic feature of baboons is their long molars and broad incisors. The long canines are evidence of sexual dimorphism in baboon species. Their forelimbs and hindlimbs are nearly equal in length and their digits on their hands and feet are relatively short and stout, making it difficult for them to climb.

Baboons are one of the largest groups of monkeys and are sexually dimorphic in body size (meaning the males and females have differing body sizes). They can range in weight from 13 and 26 kg (28–57 lbs), making them among the smallest of the baboon species.

== Habitat and distribution ==

Generally found in woodland savannas, Guinea baboons seasonally congregate near permanent water sources, breaking off in the wet season into smaller groups. Although baboon species are all allopatric, some of their ranges do overlap, and interbreeding does occasionally occur.
These baboons are found in a wide range across Africa in savannah habitats including Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, southern Mauritania and western Mali. Most typically they are in the savannah and forests of sub-Saharan Africa. They can also be found in grasslands, rain forests, and other open areas.

==Ecology==
Guinea baboons are diurnal, living on the ground instead of in trees, and typically sleep in trees at the terminal ends of branches. Their group size is widely variable and ranges from 30 to 200. However, the most common troop size is 30–40 individuals. Often, a pronounced male hierarchy and fierce competition for females happens within the group. This competition leads to sexual dimorphism among the species. When it comes to feeding, they are independent foragers, and females are always paired with males when foraging so they can be protected. Females may choose to follow the same males from year to year.

=== Diet ===
Like other baboon species, Guinea baboons will eat any available foods, but their main sources are fruits, roots, tubers, grass, seeds and leaves. They also will eat insects, worms, spiders, small mammals, birds and invertebrates.

== Behavior ==

Socially, Guinea baboons have more in common with Hamadryas baboons than other baboon species, living in one male units, consisting of one dominant male, several females and juveniles, and often a follower male. These groups are usually small, but join with larger groups to form a troop; these groups sleep or forage together. The Guinean troops are large multiple-male, multiple-female troops with 50–300 baboons. The harems consist of two to five females which mate with the dominant male. However, despite their similarities, Guinea baboon social behaviour has a few noticeable differences from that of Hamadryas baboons. Male guinea baboons are not as rigidly dominant as hamadryas baboon males, and unlike female Hamadryas baboons, female guinea baboons exert a more active role in leading the group. Males are also unusually tolerant of one another, and there is very little aggression in this species. Unusually for baboons (and old world monkeys in general), Guinea baboons also share food. Guinea baboon troops are very fluid in their structure, as female guinea baboons sometimes spend lengthy periods of time away from males in temporary, all-female groups, and several males may gather together and cooperate with one another with little bickering. This flexibility has led some to compare guinea baboon behaviour to that of early human ancestors.

Males frequently use reconciliation gestures to reduce male-male aggression and encourage cooperation, allowing troops to grow to large size and adapt to different circumstances. While male Hamadryas baboons forcibly acquire females for their harems by kidnapping them and utilizing neck-bites to condition them to stay near, female guinea baboons select males at their own leisure, males typically using facial expressions and gestures to guide their movement and grooming them to win over their loyalty. In Guinea baboons, Harem masters are noticeably less strict with their female consorts than Hamadryas baboon harem masters. Female Guinea baboons not only fraternize with females from other harems but even other males without being reprimanded by their male consort. Females approach males to initiate mating behaviour as they please and even mate with more than one male (although they mate with the harem master the most), a far cry from the more &quot;faithful&quot; female Hamadryas baboons. As seen in chimpanzees, olive baboons and various macaque species, this promiscuity most likely is practiced to hide the paternity of their infants as a counter strategy against male infanticide, which occurs in Hamadryas baboons but hasn&#x27;t yet been observed in Guinea baboons (although male Guinea baboons have been observed temporarily kidnapping and then returning infants). Competition for females between males is noticeably reduced or absent.

Unlike Hamadryas baboons and some other species, Guinea baboons are not very good climbers and favor trees, rather than high rocks or cliffs for sleeping. The more dominant males sleep on the heavier, thicker branches near the trunk of the tree and lower ranking members and juveniles sleep on the smaller and weaker branches further from the trunk. During daylight hours, they spend the majority of their time foraging on the ground, running along in quadrupedal patterns.

=== Communication ===
The Guinea baboons have a host of vocal, visual, and tactile communications. Their several vocal calls each convey several different messages, and consist of predator warnings, signaling friendly intentions, submissive calls, and anger or frustration vocalizations. Many of these calls can be used in combination with either each other or with some other form of visual or tactile communication. Visual communications serve many of the same purposes as the vocal calls, and are often accompanied by some sort of vocal call. Lower ranking animals appease more dominant ones with an &quot;ack ack&quot; vocalization and &quot;wahoo&quot; alarm calls are uttered if a threat presents itself. Tactile communication is usually tied to visual communication and can range from mouth-to-mouth touching to biting or slapping. Male Guinea baboons are unlike other baboons species, as they form intimate friendships with other males, fondling each other&#x27;s genitals as a gesture of greeting, as well as mounting each other and huddling together.

=== Reproduction ===
Female Guinea baboons exhibit sexual swelling that begins about 10 to 12 days before it peaks and remains consistent for about eight days afterwards. Females then participate in the social behavior of presenting, which is when she signals to the males in the group she is ready for copulation.

The mean gestation period is about six months and nursing continues until about six to eight months. Females rebuff a male&#x27;s advances by shrieking at him and often climbing up a tree.

<text>The parasang, also known as a farsakh (from Arabic), is a historical Iranian unit of walking distance, the length of which varied according to terrain and speed of travel. The European equivalent is the league. In modern terms the distance is about 3 or 3½ miles (6 km).

==Historical usage==
The parasang may have originally been some fraction of the distance an infantryman could march in some predefined period of time. Mid-5th-century BC Herodotus (v.53) speaks of an army traveling the equivalent of five parasangs per day.

In antiquity, the term was used throughout much of the Middle East, and the Old Iranian language from which it derives can no longer be determined (only two—of what must have been dozens—of Old Iranian languages are attested). There is no consensus with respect to its etymology or literal meaning. In addition to its appearance in various forms in later Iranian languages (e.g. Middle Persian &quot;frasang&quot; or Sogdian &quot;fasukh&quot;), the term also appears in Greek as &quot;parasangēs&quot; (), in Latin as &#x27;, in Hebrew as &quot;parasa&quot; (), in Armenian as &quot;hrasakh&quot; (), in Georgian as &quot;parsakhi&quot;, in Syriac as &quot;parsḥā&quot; (), in Turkish as &#x27;, and in Arabic as &quot;farsakh&quot; (). The present-day New Persian word is also &quot;farsakh&quot; (), and should not be confused with the present-day &quot;farsang&quot; (), which is a metric unit.

The earliest surviving mention of the parasang comes from the mid-5th-century BC Herodotus (&quot;Histories&quot; ii.6, v.53, vi.42), who defines the measure to be equivalent to 30 stadia, or half a schoenus. A length of 30 stadia is also given by several later Greek and Roman writers (10th-century Suidas and Hesychius, 5th/4th-century BC Xenophon &quot;Anab.&quot; ii.2.6). The 6th-century AD Agathias (ii.21) however—while referring to Herodotus and Xenophon—notes that in his time the contemporary Persians considered the parasang to have only 21 stadia. Strabo (xi.xi.5) also notes that some writers considered it to be 60, others 40, and yet others 30. In his 1st-century &quot;Parthian stations&quot;, Isidore of Charax &quot;evidently [used for schoenus] the same measure as the Arabic parasang (while in Persia proper 4 sch[onii] equal 3 par[asang]).&quot;

The 1st-century Pliny (&quot;Natural History&quot; vi.26) noted that the Iranians themselves assigned different lengths to it. The &quot;Bundahishn&quot; (&quot;GBd&quot; XXII), a 9th/10th-century text of Zoroastrian tradition, glosses Avestan language &quot;hathra&quot; as equivalent to a &quot;parasang of 1000 paces&quot; (a Roman mile), and then defines the parasang as the distance at which a man with good eyesight could determine whether a beast of burden was black or white. On the authority of older sources, the 14th-century Qazvinian historiographer Hamdullah Mostofi recorded that in the 10th century the north-eastern parasang was 15,000 paces, the north-western one was 18,000 paces, and the one of the south-west was merely 6,000 paces (but the &quot;true&quot; parasang, so Mostofi, was 9,000 paces). Recalling local legend, Mostofi states the unit was defined by the mythological Kai Kobad to be equal to 12,000 cubits.

Following the 30-stadia definition of Herodotus and Xenophon, the parasang would be equal to either 5.7 km (Olympic measure) or 5.3 km (Attic measure). But in 1920, Kenneth Mason of the Royal Geographical Society deduced that the parasang used in Xenophon&#x27;s Babylonian travel accounts was equal to only 2.4 miles (3.9 km). A mid-1960s search for the Parthian city of Hekatompylos based on distances given in mid-4th-century BC chronologies of Alexander&#x27;s conquests generated empirical estimates of ten stades to the English mile (1.609 km), and three miles to the parasang (4.827 km). &quot;Whatever the basis of calculation, theoretical values for the stade and the parasang must be sought which do not greatly exceed [those] estimates.&quot; A 1985 suggestion proposes that the parasang and Attic stade were defined in terms of the Babylonian beru, an astronomically-derived sexagesimal unit of time and linear distance. At 1 beru = 60 stadia = 2 parasang, the parasang could then &quot;be expressed as 10,800 &#x27;common&#x27; [i.e. trade] Babylonian cubits, or 18,000 Attic feet, both figures exactly.&quot; A 2010 study of the term parasang in Xenophon&#x27;s account of Cyrus the Younger&#x27;s late-5th-century BC campaign against Artaxerxes II demonstrated that the length of Xenophon&#x27;s parasang varied with weather and the terrain across which the army travelled. The parasangs were longer when the road was flat and dry, but shorter when travel was slower.

The term has survived in Modern Greek in the stereotypical expression &quot;απέχει παρασάγγας&quot;, i.e., &quot;it is parasangs away&quot;, meaning that something is very far away from something else, particularly in terms of quality. As Hebrew &#x27;parsah&#x27; (pl. parsoth), the parasang also finds use in the Babylonian Talmud, in several uses, for instance in a description of the biblical ladder to heaven, the width of which is given as 8,000 parsaoth (&quot;Chullin&quot; 91b). In the commentary of &quot;Pesachim&quot; 9, the 4th-century Rabbah bar bar Hana, on the authority of the 3rd-century Rabbi Johanan, gives ten parsoth as the distance that a man can walk in a day.
The farsang was also used as an Ethiopian unit for length.

The Ginza Rabba, a religious text written in Mandaic, typically measures distances in parasangs.

<text>Juan D&#x27;Vaughn Pierre (born August 14, 1977) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2000–2013 for the Colorado Rockies, Florida/Miami Marlins, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, and Philadelphia Phillies. Known for his speed, he stole 614 bases in his career, the 18th-most in MLB history at the time of his retirement. He worked as an MLB Network on-air analyst before joining the Marlins as a Minor League Outfield Coordinator for the 2019 season.

In 1,994 games over 14 seasons, Pierre posted a .295 batting average (2217-for-7525) with 1075 runs, 255 doubles, 94 triples, 18 home runs, 517 RBI, 614 stolen bases, 464 bases on balls, .343 on-base percentage and .361 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .990 fielding percentage playing at center and left field. In 26 postseason games, he hit .304 (24-for-79) with 16 runs, five doubles, two triples, seven RBI, three stolen bases and eight walks.

==Amateur career==
Pierre was born in Mobile, Alabama, to Derry and James. Soon after his birth, his family moved to Alexandria, Louisiana. The Pierres have been deeply rooted in Louisiana since colonial times and are of Creole heritage. Pierre was named after Dominican Hall of Fame pitcher and former Giants player Juan Marichal, his father&#x27;s favorite player, who also gave him his middle name, &quot;D&#x27;Vaughn,&quot; because he said it had a &quot;good rhyme to it.&quot;

Pierre attended Alexandria Senior High School. Prior to his professional career, he played college baseball at Galveston College and the University of South Alabama. With the South Alabama Jaguars, Pierre was the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year in 1998.

==Minor leagues==
Pierre began his professional career with the Portland Rockies of the Northwest League after being selected by Colorado in the 13th round of the 1998 MLB draft. He won the league batting and stolen base titles in his first professional season with 38 and was a fan favorite even at that level. Pierre moved on to the Asheville Tourists the following year, again batting well over .300 and began with the Carolina Mudcats before finishing the year in Colorado.

==Major leagues==

===Colorado Rockies===
Pierre made his major league debut on August 7, 2000, as a pinch runner for the Rockies against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He made his first start in center field the following day and got his first hit in the first inning off José Silva. He appeared in 51 games in 2000, hitting .310 with 20 RBIs and 7 stolen bases. Pierre received a single vote in 2000 National League Rookie of the Year voting, tying him for sixth place with Lance Berkman and Chuck Smith.

In 2001, Pierre became the Rockies primary starter in center field, appearing in 156 games, 140 of which were starts, hitting .327 with 2 home runs and 55 RBIs. He led the NL in both stolen bases (46) and caught stealing (17), and his 202 hits were second behind the San Francisco Giants&#x27; Rich Aurilia.

Prior to the start of the 2002 season, Pierre signed a 4-year, $7.5 million contract extension, which kept him with the Rockies through the 2005 season. In the 2002 season, Pierre was once again the starter in center field, appearing in 152 games, starting 133 of them, and hit .287 with 1 home run and 35 RBIs. His 47 stolen bases and 144 singles both ranked 2nd in the NL, trailing only the Marlins&#x27; Luis Castillo in both categories.

===Florida Marlins===
On November 16, , Pierre was traded along with Mike Hampton and cash to the Florida Marlins for Charles Johnson, Preston Wilson, Vic Darensbourg, and Pablo Ozuna.

In the 2003 regular season, Pierre posted a .305 batting average, led the NL in games played (162), at-bats (668), stolen bases (65), and sacrifice hits (15), and he led the majors with the lowest strikeout percentage (5.2%). During the postseason, he was a major contributor to the Marlins&#x27; 2003 World Series championship. He batted .333 in the World Series and .301 overall in his first playoff experience. Pierre received thirty-nine votes in 2003 National League MVP voting, finishing in tenth place.

In 2004, he led the National League in at-bats (for the second year in a row) with 678; hits (221); triples (12); games played (162); bunt hits (24); infield hits (38); and strikeout percentage (5.2%). In addition, he was the only major league player to play every inning of each of his team&#x27;s games, being the last player to do so as of 2023. Pierre received nine votes in 2004 National League MVP voting, tying him for sixteenth place with Todd Helton.

In , Pierre led the National League in games played (162) and had the third-lowest strikeout percentage in baseball (6.9%).

===Chicago Cubs===

On December 7, 2005, the Marlins traded Pierre to the Chicago Cubs, receiving pitchers Sergio Mitre, Ricky Nolasco, and Renyel Pinto in exchange. The deal was motivated by the Marlins&#x27; need to cut payroll after being unable to secure a new stadium deal in South Florida. In January 2006, Pierre agreed to a 1-year, $5.75 million contract to avoid arbitration, despite the Cubs efforts to reach a long-term deal with him, meaning he would be a free agent following the season.

In 2006, while batting .292, Pierre led the NL with 204 hits, winning his second hit title, and he led the NL in at-bats (699), games played (162), bunt hits (21), infield hits (30), and lowest strikeout percentage (5.4%). He also tied for the major league lead in times reached base on an error (13), and played perfect defensive baseball, earning a fielding percentage of 1.000. He also led the major leagues in outs made (532), the second-highest out total for a player since .

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On November 22, 2006, Pierre signed a five-year, $44 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

In , Pierre led the majors in bunt hits (19). He also led the NL in games played (162) for the fifth straight year, led the NL in singles (164) for the second straight year, led the league in sacrifice hits (20), and had the lowest strikeout percentage in the NL (5.5%). He was second in the NL in stolen bases (64), third in at bats (668) and plate appearances (729), fourth in hits (196), and ninth in triples (8).
Going into , the Dodgers signed Andruw Jones to a two-year contract to play center field. Because of this, Pierre shifted to left field. After a trip to the DL in July, Pierre was moved into a platoon in center field with the struggling Jones. When the Dodgers traded for Manny Ramirez, Pierre moved to the bench and saw limited action, primarily as a pinch runner the rest of the season.

After nearly two years without hitting a home run, Pierre hit a ball into the right field seats at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on September 15, 2008. It was Pierre&#x27;s first traditional fly-ball home run since August 28, 2006, also in Pittsburgh. On July 29, 2008, Pierre stole his 100th base with the Dodgers, becoming only one of four players in MLB history to steal at least 100 bases with three different teams. He previously stole 100 with the Colorado Rockies and 167 with the Florida Marlins. Tommy Harper, Brett Butler, and Otis Nixon are the only others to have accomplished this feat.

Prior to the start of the 2009 season, the Dodgers gave Pierre and his agent permission to talk to other teams in hopes of working out a trade because Ramirez&#x27;s re-signing with the Dodgers pushed Pierre to the backup role in left field. Pierre tied former Dodgers player Steve Sax on the top 50 career MLB stolen base leaders list with 444 on June 12, 2009, against the Texas Rangers in Arlington. The next day, June 13, he pushed Sax out of the top 50 with his 445th steal, again versus the Rangers in Arlington.

When Manny Ramirez received a 50-game suspension, Pierre once more became the Dodgers&#x27; regular left fielder. During Ramirez&#x27;s suspension, Pierre delivered a stellar performance that drew praise from fans and critics alike. However, once Ramirez returned, he resumed his previous role of a backup player. In recognition of his hard work, Dodgers fans gave him a standing ovation on July 16− the same game where Ramirez had his first home game since returning from suspension.

===Chicago White Sox===

On December 15, 2009, Pierre was traded to the Chicago White Sox for two minor league pitching prospects to be named later (Jon Link and John Ely). Pierre led Major League Baseball with a career-high 68 stolen bases, the second-most in a single season in franchise history after only Rudy Law&#x27;s 77 in 1983. On August 3, 2010, he hit his first and only home run of 2010 off Rick Porcello. On August 5, 2010, he stole his 500th career base against the Detroit Tigers.

In 2011, Pierre led the major leagues in sacrifice hits (19) and at bats per strikeout (15.6), and he was caught stealing a major-league-leading 17 times (while stealing 27 bases). On defense, he tied for the major league lead in errors by a left fielder, with seven.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
On January 27, 2012, Pierre signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. The Phillies purchased his contract on March 29, and he was subsequently added to their opening day roster. He hit a three-run home run on June 23. On June 28, he got his 500th career RBI. In 130 games — 98 starting in left field — Pierre hit .307/.351/.371 with six triples and 37 stolen bases.

===Miami Marlins===

On November 17, 2012, Pierre signed a one-year, $1.6 million deal with the Miami Marlins. He played the 2013 season with Miami and became a free agent at the end of the season.

He had hoped to sign with another team and was often mentioned in press reports about teams requiring depth in the outfield to cover for injured or under-performing players. However, he went unsigned for the entire season and announced his retirement from professional baseball on February 27, 2015.

Pierre was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019 but received 0 votes, making him ineligible for the 2020 ballot as he failed to meet the 5% vote threshold.

===Personal life===
Pierre has two sons with his wife Liz.

Pierre was mentioned in the song Déjà Vu by Beyonce and Jay-Z in the line &quot;I used to run base like Juan Pierre.&quot;

<doc id="1199589" wikidata="Q2143929" url="?curid=1199589" title="Tanganyika African National Union">
<text>The Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) was the principal political party in the struggle for sovereignty in the East African state of Tanganyika (now Tanzania). The party was formed from the Tanganyika African Association by Julius Nyerere in July 1954 when he was teaching at St. Francis&#x27; College (which is now known as Pugu High School). From 1964 the party was called the Tanzania African National Union. In January 1977 the TANU merged with the ruling party in Zanzibar, the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP), to form the current Revolutionary State Party or Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM). The policy of TANU was to build and maintain a socialist state aiming towards economic self-sufficiency and to eradicate corruption and exploitation, with the major means of production and exchange under the control of the peasants and workers (Ujamaa-Essays on Socialism; &quot;The Arusha Declaration&quot;).

Julius Nyerere was the first President of Tanzania, serving from the 1960s to 1985. In 1962, Nyerere and TANU created the Ministry of National Culture and Youth. Nyerere felt the creation of the ministry was necessary in order to deal with some of the challenges and contradictions of building a nation-state and a national culture after 70 years of colonialism. The government of Tanzania sought to create an innovative public space where Tanzanian popular culture could develop and flourish. By incorporating the varied traditions and customs of all the people of Tanzania, Nyerere hoped to promote a sense of pride, thus creating a national culture.

<text>Swiss folklore describes a collection of local stories, celebrations, and customs of the alpine and sub-alpine peoples that occupy Switzerland. The country of Switzerland is made up of several distinct cultures including German, French, Italian, as well as the Romansh speaking population of Graubünden. Each group has its own unique folkloric tradition.

Switzerland has always occupied a crossroads of Europe. While Switzerland has existed as an alliance and country since 1291, the Swiss as a culture and people existed well before this time. Before the Swiss, the region was occupied by Pagan and later Christian Germanic tribes, which would become the Swiss. Before the Germanic peoples, the region was occupied by Roman and Gallo-Roman populations. Finally, before the Romans the Celtic Helvetii lived in what would become Switzerland. In addition to conquest, Switzerland has been a crossroads of Europe since at least the Roman Empire. Constant movement of cultures and ideas into Switzerland has created a rich and varied folklore tradition.

The study of folklore (Folkloristics) is known as &quot;Volkskunde&quot; in German. 
The study of Swiss folklore originates in the 19th century. The central figure of its academic development is Eduard Hoffmann-Krayer, who founded the Swiss Society for &quot;Volkskunde&quot; in 1896.

==Festivals==

* Berchtoldstag, festival in honour of Berchta or Berchtold.
* Fasnacht (or Fastnacht), a pre-Lenten carnival.
** Eis-zwei-Geissebei, a Fasnacht event for children in Rapperswil.
* Klausjagen, parade festival on the eve of Saint Nicholas Day.
* Schützenfest
* Sechseläuten, a spring fire festival.
* Tschäggätä, masked carnival parade.
* Ubersitz, a Christmas parade festival.
* Silvesterklausen, a New Year&#x27;s Eve tradition in Appenzell-Ausserrhoden.
* Unspunnenfest

==Customs==
* Bäregräubschi and Chöderchessi are traditional wedding presents in the Simmental (Bernese Oberland). The former is a kind of fork symbolising the male element in the wedding, and the latter is a magical bucket representing the female aspect. Reported in an Italian anthology of Alpine culture in the 1860s, it is unknown whether this custom is still practiced.
* Rääbeliechtli (&quot;turnip lights&quot;) are lanterns hand-carved from turnips. The turnip is hollowed out and designs are carved into it, which are lit by a candle in the turnip. The children of the villages then walk through the streets of their town with the lanterns and sing traditional songs. The custom originates with thanksgiving traditions at the end of harvest in November.
*Schwingen
*Steinstossen

==Mythical beings==
* Berchtold, a white-cloaked being and leader of the Wild Hunt.
* Böögg, or bogeyman, of the Sechseläuten festival.
* Dragons, serpentine monsters often having wings and breathing fire. One such tale involved a cooper who drunkenly stumbled into a cave where he encountered a pair of these creatures. These dragons were unusual in that they were friendly and allowed the cooper to stay with them through the winter. However, when he returned home in the spring he found that he was so used to eating dragon food that he could no longer stomach human fare, and eventually starved to death. Dragonet (&quot;little dragon&quot;) tales originated in Switzerland during the Middle Ages.
* Dwarfs are little men associated with hills and the earth. Described as happy and helpful, they raise cattle and produce magical cheeses. This cheese has the property of replenishing itself as long as a piece is left over after eating. They are sometimes portrayed as wearing green cloaks and red caps, and having long white beards. They live in caves and mines and they know where subterranean treasures may be found. They are guardians of the chamois, a species of mountain goat. They are expert blacksmiths and weaponsmiths, and despite their good nature they will play vengeful pranks if they are insulted or mistreated.
* Fairies, a general class of magical beings. In Swiss fairy tale literature they are ruled by a Fairy Queen, are associated with flowers and warmth, and have frequent battles with the frost giants.
* Frost Giants inhabit the high peaks of the Alps and are ruled by a Frost King. Their children take the form of avalanches, and the giants take great pride in the destruction caused by them. They have the ability to freeze any living thing that gets near them. They are sometimes portrayed as having long beards made of icicles and wearing wooden shoes hollowed out from the trunks of fir trees. Frost giants may literally melt into puddles of cold water if the weather is too warm or if they are exposed to the charms of a particularly beautiful fairy.
* Gnomes, earth spirits or elementals from the writings of the Swiss physician Paracelsus. They are said to have caused the landslide that destroyed the Swiss village of Plurs in 1618. The villagers had become wealthy from a local gold mine created by the gnomes who poured liquid gold down into a vein for the benefit of humans. This newfound prosperity led to the corruption of the village which greatly offended the gnomes. 
* Herwisch is similar to the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp. They inhabit marshy terrain and turn their lanterns on at night, leading travelers astray to flounder in the water. If they are mocked or angered, they will frighten the offender by chasing him and flapping their wings in his face. The Herwisch is also part of the folklore of Germany where it displays the same characteristics.
* Huttefroueli (or Greth Schell), an old woman who carries her husband on her back in the Ubersitz festival.
* Imps, evil spirits that ride on the Föhn or south wind.
* Jack-of-the-Bowl, a house spirit and the most well known Swiss kobold, otherwise known as Jean de la Boliéta in French, or Napf-Hans in German. In return for a bowl of sweet cream left out for him each night, he would lead the cows to graze in places considered dangerous to humans, but none of the cows ever suffered injury. The path used by him was always clear of stones no matter how rocky the mountainside, and this came to be known as Boliéta&#x27;s Path.
* Jack Frost, a personification of winter.
* Kobolds (or &quot;Servants&quot;) are house spirits related to dwarfs but they inhabit remote dwellings and shielings (summer houses used by herdsmen on the mountains). The most well known Swiss kobold is Jean de la Boliéta (Jack-of-the-Bowl), or Napf-Hans in German.
* Mountain Giants are primordial giants that live in caves and are big and strong but simpleminded compared to humans. Valleys were formed when they walked about on the earth, and rivers were formed from the weeping of their wives and daughters when they were mistreated by their male kinsmen. Gargantua (&quot;Old Gargy&quot;) is their king and Bertha is his daughter. Hotap was a giant who enjoyed eating humans, and his friend Schoppe was a personification of alcoholic beverages (similar to John Barleycorn), especially the destructive consequences of overconsumption. Hotap was unable to resist his partner&#x27;s influence and eventually drank himself to death.
* Perchta (or Berchta, Bertha, &quot;The Shining One&quot;), Germanic goddess and white-cloaked leader of the Perchten who drive bad spirits away, and female leader of the Wild Hunt. 6 January is her festival day.
* Perchten, those followers who work with Perchta, and also the name of their wooden animal masks.
* Samichlaus leads a donkey gives with Mandarin Orange, Nuts, and Chocolate for good children.
* Companions of Saint Nicholas
** Schmutzli is one of the Companions of Saint Nicholas. He has a dark or sooty complexion and accompanies Saint Nicholas on his gift-giving rounds. He carries switches and a sack in which he puts bad children. In the French-speaking cantons he is known as Père Fouettard (&quot;Father Whipper&quot;). 
* Schnabelgeiss, a tall goat with a beak in the Ubersitz festival.
* Tatzelwurm (or Stollenwurm) combines the features of a cat and a serpent, allegedly photographed by a Swiss photographer named Balkin in 1934.
* Türst, the Wild Hunter.
* Undines, water spirits or elementals from the writings of Paracelsus. They are usually portrayed in Swiss fairy tales as young maidens who love to sit or dance near brooks and rivers or in marshes among the reeds. They have wavy golden hair with a wreath of pond lilies, and are clothed in white mist, for which reason they are also known as mist maidens. They do not like to be seen but may be encountered on moonlit nights. There are also male undines, though less frequent, and in one tale there is even a king of the undines who brings a human princess down to his crystal palace beneath a lake to make her his bride. Both male and female undines are able to disguise themselves as mortals, though their fairy nature may be revealed by their green clothing which will always feel wet.
* Vogel Gryff (&quot;Griffin Bird&quot;)

==Legends==

The legends of Switzerland include historic and semi-mythic people and places that shaped the history and culture of the nation.

===Christianization===
* Saint Gall, an Irish monk who in the early 7th century helped introduce Christianity to eastern Switzerland. The Abbey of St. Gall is believed to have been built on the site of his hermitage.
* Magnus of Füssen, a missionary saint in southern Germany. He was active in the 7th or 8th century and is considered the founder of St. Mang&#x27;s Abbey, Füssen.
* Saint Fridolin, patron of Glarus. He is traditionally believed to be an Irish saint who founded Säckingen Abbey, Baden, in the 6th or 7th century. According to legend, he converted a landowner who left his estates, now the Canton of Glarus, to Fridolin. When the landowner&#x27;s brother took Fridolin to court over the gift, Fridolin raised the landowner from the dead to confirm its legitimacy.

===Old Swiss Confederacy===
* Teufelsbrücke is a bridge which was supposedly erected by the Devil.
* William Tell is a Swiss folk hero who was forced to shoot an apple off his son&#x27;s head by the tyrannical reeve of Habsburg Austria. After successfully shooting the apple and escaping the reeve&#x27;s men, he assassinated the reeve and started a revolution. He became a central figure in Swiss patriotism as it was constructed during the Restoration of the Confederacy after the Napoleonic era.
* Rütlischwur, a legendary oath of the Old Swiss Confederacy, taken on the Rütli, a meadow above Lake Lucerne, by three men representing Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden. It became connected to the legend of William Tell.
* Arnold Winkelried was a possibly legendary hero of the Swiss Battle of Sempach against the Habsburg Duke Leopold III of Austria. According to the story, when the Swiss army was unable to break through the Austrian pikes, Winkelried threw himself on the pikes and used his body to open a hole in the Austrian lines leading to the Swiss victory at Sempach. Though the existence of Arnold Winkelried is disputed, the story was another central part of Swiss patriotism in the 19th century.
* Bruder Klaus was a Swiss monk and ascetic who is considered the patron saint of Switzerland. In 1481 the leaders of the Old Swiss Confederacy began quarreling over treasure from the Burgundian Wars and civil war appeared likely. Bruder Klaus was consulted and passed a secret message to the quarreling leaders. The message, the contents of which are unknown, calmed the tempers and led to the drawing up of the Stanser Verkommnis which expanded the Confederation.

==Fairy tales and folktales==

<text>The Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP) was an African nationalist and socialist Zanzibari political party formed between the mostly Shirazi Shiraz Party and the mostly African Afro Party.

In the 1963 Zanzibari general election, the ASP claimed 13 seats and the majority of votes cast, yet the election ended up favouring the Zanzibar Nationalist Party and Zanzibar and Pemba People&#x27;s Party alliance who collectively claimed 18 seats. Unsatisfied with such unfair representation in parliament, the ASP, headed by Abeid Karume, collaborated with the Umma Party to begin the Zanzibar Revolution on 12 January 1964. The revolution overthrew the Sultanate of Zanzibar and established the People&#x27;s Republic of Zanzibar, ruled by Abeid Karume. Following the establishment of the republic, the ASP banned the previous ruling parties—the Zanzibar Nationalist Parity and the Zanzibar and Pemba People&#x27;s Party. On 5 February 1977, the party joined with the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) to form Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM).

<doc id="1199604" wikidata="Q7241962" url="?curid=1199604" title="Preston Park, Stockton-on-Tees">
<text>Preston Park (officially Preston Hall Park) is a public park in Preston-on-Tees, England. It hosts multiple events each year and is located next to the River Tees.

The land was originally a private residence with large grounds but has since become the property of Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council after being purchased from Sir Robert Ropner. and was redeveloped in 2010–12, with the Museum reopening in 2012.

Parking is free, but the Preston Park Museum &amp; Grounds and Butterfly World have small admission charges. The museum has a volunteer community with its participants ranging from students to the retired. They carry out roles in the Museum such as gardening, gallery stewarding, supporting learning and costumed interpreters on the Victorian Street.

==Areas of interest==

Preston Park is made up of several diverse areas:

===Hall museum===
It was not until 1882, when the estate and lands were sold to Robert Ropner for the princely sum of £27,500 (£1,328,525.00 in modern money), that the Preston Hall building of today was built.

Ropner was a wealthy shipping and industrial magnate and in common with the style of the times demanded a home to befit his status in society. Major alterations included the addition of a Winter Garden, Music Room, Billiard Room, entrance portico and extensive landscaped parkland – all ‘must haves’ of the Victorian age.

The Hall &amp; Park were served by legions of staff, from a butler and cook through to maids and stable hands. Gardeners would tend the grounds and supply the kitchen with produce from the walled garden, which was restored and reopened to the public in 2012.

In 1937 the Hall &amp; Park passed into the hands of a number of companies before being purchased by Stockton Corporation (now the Borough Council) in 1947.The site officially opened as Preston Hall Museum and Park in 1953 and has continued to bring pleasure to generations of visitors young and old ever since.

Following a successful bid for funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council, the Museum and Park have recently reopened following extensive redevelopment work. The £7 million transformation has seen significant improvements to facilities, including better access, the repair and conservation of the Grade II listed building and the development of further features, interpretation and exhibits.

Exhibits in the museum include the Yarm helmet, a c. 10th-century Viking Age helmet found in Yarm. It is the first relatively complete Anglo-Scandinavian helmet found in Britain and only the second Viking helmet discovered in north-west Europe.

===Showground===
The flat, grassed area in front of the main house is now the main staging ground for large events held in the park. It is easily able to hold the largest of circus tents and other temporary structures. When not being used for an event, this area will often contain people playing sports or picnicking with their children. The field is used for training by a number of football teams and a local Frisbee team. However the field suffers from drainage problems, meaning that it often becomes waterlogged.

===Teesside Small Gauge Railway===
Across the showground from the car park is a model engineering club with a miniature railway. It operates to the public during the summer on Sunday afternoons and on bank holidays from 1pm to 4pm.

===Butterfly World===
This building houses an environment specially controlled to allow a variety of exotic butterflies to thrive. There is a charge for entry.

===Café and Play Area===

Beside the main car park is a café operated by Stockton Borough Council.

Adjacent to the café is an extensive play area containing a variety of traditional swings and more adventurous climbing equipment for children of all ages.

===Skatepark===
A concrete skatepark opened on the site of the former crazy-golf course in 2014. The project was built by Wheelscape and cost £25,000. The skatepark is vary varied and suits a wide range of skill levels.

===Quarry Wood===
The Quarry Wood was declared a nature reserve in 2004. It is a former Victorian Quarry that has now been reclaimed by nature.
This is a popular place for younger mountain bikers, with the main attraction being &quot;The Dippers&quot;. These are a series of dirt jumps and gravel corners created by the natural terrain. They are mostly fenced off in an attempt to protect the public from out-of-control bikes.

&quot;The Big Dipper&quot; is a 15 ft-deep cut in the ground which is used as a kind of half-pipe. From the top of the slope, riders can aim at a variety of take-off points on the other side, each of which provides differing amounts of &quot;air time&quot;.

There are a variety of smaller jumps nearby, as well as some rougher cycling routes.

Furthermore, Quarry Wood is home to a wide spectrum of wildlife including frogs, toads, newts, foxes, rabbits and birds such as moorhen and owls, as well as a host of invertebrates.

==Previous Attractions==
The world&#x27;s first passenger railway ran through the grounds beside the main road from the early 19th century until 1852. There was no station.

In the 1970s and 80s there was a small zoo within the park, partly covering the area now used by the playground and stretching down to the hall. It famously had a penguin enclosure. There were also llamas and chipmunks, among others.

Previously in front of the café was a simple crazy golf course. However it was removed in 2014 to make way for the skatepark.

==Relocation of Egglescliffe School==
In 2009 it was proposed by Ingleby Barwick Councillors that Egglescliffe School be relocated to the park with a footbridge over the river linking the school to the town. The proposal was backed by the then MP for Stockton South, Dari Taylor, but was strongly opposed by many residents because it would have meant the loss of valuable public parkland. The Conservative candidate for the Stockton-South seat, James Wharton, also opposed the proposal before narrowly winning the seat in the 2010 election. Leaflets from Dari Taylor&#x27;s party have since expressed regret for not opposing the development of Preston Park.

The proposal for the development (coded option D2) has now been removed as a viable option. The reasons given are that funding for the new footbridge would not have come from central government, and that &quot;During the feasibility work undertaken, the location of the proposed bridge also raised significant engineering issues. In addition to this, any additional traffic from a community school facility could not be accommodated without significant upgrading of the road network.&quot;, and that the Preston Park allotments would have had to be moved.

From this issue was also born &#x27;Friends of Preston Park&#x27;, a group consisting of members of the public that raises any issues that become apparent to visitors and presents them to the management of Preston Park during meetings.

<doc id="1199608" wikidata="Q4792737" url="?curid=1199608" title="Armando Benítez">
<text>Armando Benítez (born November 3, 1972) is a Dominican former major league relief pitcher. Benítez debuted with the Baltimore Orioles in 1994 and within a few years became their closer. He was a reliever for several other organizations after Baltimore in 1999 and last played in Major League Baseball in 2008. His 289 saves rank 32nd all time. After 2008, he played in minor league and independent league baseball.

==Early life==
Armando Germán Benítez was born in San Pedro de Macorís, in the Dominican Republic. His parents, father Francisco and mother Constancia, separated when he was young, so Armando was raised by his mother. She made a living by hand-washing clothes. Armando has two brothers, Francisco Jr. and Osiri, as well as a sister, Senovia.

Benítez learned to play baseball when he was 14, when his stature was a lanky 6&#x27;2&quot;, 140 pounds. He began to play baseball at a local academy and was originally an outfielder and third baseman.

==Professional career==

===Baltimore Orioles===
Benítez was signed in by the Baltimore Orioles as a free agent. Coming up through the Orioles&#x27; farm system, he made his debut in . While with the Orioles, he initially struggled, collecting a 5.66 ERA in and faltering in the postseason frequently. In the 1996 ALCS, he yielded the infamous Jeffrey Maier home run, sprinting all the way to right field to confront the umpire, Rich Garcia, who made the call.

In 1997, Benítez had a breakout year, as he excelled in the set up role for Orioles&#x27; closer Randy Myers, forming a lethal 1–2 punch at the back end of the Orioles bullpen and propelling them to the AL East pennant. However, in the 1997 ALCS against Cleveland, Benitez had one of the least successful postseason series ever by a relief pitcher. The Orioles lost four games by a single run: in three of them, Benitez was on the mound for the final run of the game, while pitching one inning or less. He was charged with two losses and a blown save.

By 1998, he started to show some of his future potential earning a 3.82 ERA and 22 saves in 71 games.

However, during a game against the New York Yankees on May 19, 1998, Benítez was ejected for hitting Tino Martinez with a pitch that led to a brawl between the two teams. Although Benítez denied hitting Martinez intentionally, few Orioles defended his actions and he was assessed an eight-game suspension by American League President Gene Budig, and his own manager even apologized to the Yankees for Benitez&#x27;s behavior. It was the second time he had drilled Martinez, which caused Martinez&#x27;s incensed reaction. He did the same thing three years before when Martinez was playing for the Seattle Mariners after surrendering an Edgar Martínez grand slam, which had led to his demotion to the minors at that time.

===New York Mets===
Before the season, Benítez was traded to the New York Mets in a three-team deal, in which catcher Charles Johnson joined the Orioles while Todd Hundley was sent to the Los Angeles Dodgers, with Roger Cedeño also joining Benitez in New York. Benitez initially served as the setup man for longtime Mets closer John Franco; however, when Franco went down with an injury mid-way through the 1999 season, Benitez assumed the job and was named the full-time Mets closer even after Franco&#x27;s return. However, he continued his late season and postseason struggles. In Game 4 of the 1999 NL Division Series, after notoriously arriving late to the ballpark in Game 4, he was called upon to protect a 2–1 lead in the eighth inning against the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks, but allowed a two-run double as the Diamondbacks went ahead. He also blew a three-run lead in Game 2 of the 2000 NL Division Series against the San Francisco Giants, surrendering a game tying three run homer to JT Snow. He would also surrender the lead in Game 1 of the 2000 World Series to the New York Yankees, as the Yankees would eventually prevail in a marathon extra-inning game, ultimately winning the series in five games. Despite these struggles during his four seasons in New York, he managed to establish himself as one of the Major Leagues&#x27; better closers, saving 139 games. But it was also a painful time for Benítez, who battled gout during the 2000 season, due to overindulging in shellfish. However, as Benítez still struggled to hold leads when it seemed to matter most, to many fans his failures in clutch situations overshadowed most of the success he had in his career in New York. Regardless, several playoff contenders were interested in his services. Midway through , as Benítez labored trying to convert saves through the year, he was traded to the New York Yankees, who intended to use him as a setup man for Mariano Rivera.

===New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, and Florida Marlins===
Benítez had a 1.93 ERA, but allowed 14 baserunners in innings over nine games with the Yankees before being traded in a post-deadline waiver deal to the Seattle Mariners for Jeff Nelson. Benitez finished the 2003 season in Seattle. In , Benítez once again became a closer, signing a one-year, $3.5 million contract to join the Florida Marlins. His season with the Marlins ended up being his best season to date; he saved 47 games in 51 chances and compiled a 1.29 ERA. In fact, after giving up a solo home run in his first game of the season, he did not allow another earned run until June 5, an impressive streak of 30 scoreless innings. After the season, Benítez elected to become a free agent, signing a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants that was worth a reported US$21 million.

===San Francisco Giants===
His tenure with the Giants was mired by injuries and a high percentage of blown saves, never recapturing the form he showed in 2004 with the Marlins. His first season with the Giants started badly when Benítez tore a pair of tendons in his right hamstring while running to cover first in late April. The injury had him sidelined until August, when he returned to the mound after a difficult rehab.

Benítez struggled for much of the season, at one point blowing three consecutive save opportunities. Benítez&#x27;s season ended prematurely after being placed on the 60-day disabled list with arthritis in both knees. He ended the season with 17 saves in 25 opportunities.

Benítez started well, converting all of his first seven save opportunities. However, in May, Benítez picked up two blown saves and three losses, including a blown save and a loss against his former team, the Mets, where he committed two balks. This game immediately brought back memories of his various meltdowns on the mound as a Met, and the media pounced on it. After the game Benítez commented, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do my job&quot;, contrasting with his previous game where he picked up the loss yet claimed, &quot;I did my job.&quot; MLB.com writer Chris Haft reported that this added &quot;little to the family atmosphere&quot; at the Giants ballclub. Benítez had once before said, &quot;I did my job&quot;, even when tallying a blown save, during a Giants loss to the Nationals in 2006.

On May 31, 2007, he was traded back to the Florida Marlins in exchange for Randy Messenger. Giants general manager Brian Sabean acknowledged that Benítez was not liked by the Giants fanbase, saying he had become a &quot;whipping boy&quot;, adding &quot;the fans, the press and maybe some people in the clubhouse felt he needed to go&quot;.
Chris Haft noted that Benítez had &quot;incurred the wrath of San Francisco fans with his perceived attitude as well as his performance&quot;, further writing &quot;he maintained his tendency to shrug off accountability for poor performances, prompting the crowds at AT&amp;T Park to boo him after the slightest lapse.&quot;

===Return to the Marlins, then to the Toronto Blue Jays===
Benítez&#x27;s first return to AT&amp;T Park after being traded to the Marlins came on July 29, 2007. He was greeted with &quot;thunderous boos&quot; from the Giants fans.

On October 29, 2007, Benítez officially filed for free agency, ending his second tenure with the Marlins following a disappointing campaign where he posted a 5.36 ERA between the two teams and did not record a save following the trade.

On March 11, 2008, Benítez agreed to a minor league deal with the Toronto Blue Jays and was given chance to compete for a bullpen job in spring training. After starting the season in the minors, he was eventually added to the active roster in May. However, after posting a 5.68 ERA, he was designated for assignment on June 7 and released.

===Later career===
Benitez started the 2009 season with the Newark Bears, an Independent League team in the Atlantic League, before signing a minor league contract with the Houston Astros on August 22, and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate the Round Rock Express. On his minor league return, Benitez gave up back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs against Memphis Redbirds hitters.

On June 24, 2010, Benitez signed a minor league deal with the Florida Marlins and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate, New Orleans Zephyrs. Benitez was released on July 15 and immediately signed to play his second stint with the Newark Bears. Following the season, he became a free agent. In May 2011, Armando signed to play for the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Independent Baseball. On May 24, 2012, Benitez signed with the Atlantic League&#x27;s Long Island Ducks.

<text>Jaime (sometimes spelled Xaime) Hernandez (born 1959) is the co-creator of the alternative comic book &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; with his brothers Gilbert and Mario.

==Early life==
Jaime Hernandez grew up in Oxnard, California. He is the youngest of his family, with four older brothers and one sister. His family embraced comics: their mother read them frequently and old issues were kept in large quantities in the house, to be read and re-read by all over the years. &quot;We grew up with comics,&quot; Hernandez said. &quot;I wanted to draw comics my whole life.&quot;

They read all types of comics and enjoyed those that gave a fairly realistic depiction of family life as well as the standard superhero adventures. Hernandez was particularly influenced by Hank Ketcham&#x27;s &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and Dan DeCarlo&#x27;s &quot;Archie&quot;&#x27; comics. The children in his otherwise rather realistic stories are often drawn to resemble Ketcham&#x27;s, and Jaime&#x27;s characters often strike very &quot;DeCarlo-esque&quot; poses. The work of Alex Toth, Charles Schulz, Jesse Marsh and Jack Kirby were also hugely influential.

Hernandez has a lifelong fascination with pro wrestling, especially women&#x27;s wrestling, and it has been a regular part of his work. Hernandez has also been a lifelong punk rock fan. In addition to playing in bands himself it has been a constant element of his work. His heroine Maggie and her friends are almost all punk fans; he also has done a series of stories about the career of another main character (Hopey) as a bass player for a luckless punk band.

==Career==

Jaime&#x27;s main contribution to &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; is the ongoing serial narrative &quot;Locas&quot; which follows the tangled lives of a group of primarily Latina characters, from their teenage years in the early days of the California punk scene to the present day. The two central characters of Jaime&#x27;s cast are Margarita Luisa &quot;Maggie&quot; Chascarrillo and Esperanza Leticia &quot;Hopey&quot; Glass, whose on-again, off-again, open romance is a focus for many &quot;Locas&quot; storylines. Early on, the stories switched back and forth between Maggie&#x27;s sci-fi adventures journeying around the world and working as a &quot;prosolar&quot; mechanic repairing rocketships, and much more realistic stories of Maggie and her friends in a grungy, mostly Latin California neighborhood known as &quot;Hoppers&quot;. Eventually Hernandez dropped almost all of the sci-fi elements, although he does still occasionally include references to the earlier stories and he still does very occasional short stories about superheroines, robots and other sci-fi genre elements.

The Hernandez brothers announced they were ending &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; with issue 50, and that they would be doing solo books from then on. For the next few years, the brothers released many solo books, with Jaime doing several books featuring his Locas characters (including &quot;Whoa Nellie&quot;, &quot;Penny Century&quot;, and &quot;Maggie and Hopey Color Fun&quot;) and Maggie generally occupying a supporting role. Eventually they resumed doing &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; and Maggie again took center stage, but instead of the large, magazine-style format of the original issues, the book was now released in a more traditional comic book format.

The entire &quot;Locas&quot; storyline to date was collected into one 700 page graphic novel in 2004.

Hernandez has been praised for the physical beauty of his female characters as well as their complex personalities, and for years he struggled to create comparably nuanced male characters. Hernandez has often said that Maggie and Ray Dominguez both represent different aspects of his own personality.

In an interview with The Comics Journal, Hernandez admitted he&#x27;d had difficulty aging his characters, because while he&#x27;d known girls like Maggie and Hopey when he was young, he&#x27;d never known them long enough to find out what they did in adulthood.

===Other work===

In addition to his &quot;Locas&quot; stories, Hernandez has also done occasional work for DC Comics and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and he has done many album covers for such artists as Michelle Shocked. Earlier in his career Hernandez also did album covers for some &quot;Nardcore&quot; punk bands, such as Ill Repute and Dr. Know, the latter of whom featured his younger brother Ismael on bass. Hernandez contributed his artwork for the Indigo Girls&#x27; 2004 album &quot;All That We Let In&quot;. In September 2006, Hernandez also created the artwork for the critically acclaimed Los Lobos album &quot;The Town and the City&quot;. In 1984-85 Gilbert, Mario and Jaime collaborated on &quot;Mister X&quot;, a sci-fi comic book series from Vortex Press, with Jaime handling the art and Gilbert and Mario plotting. The book&#x27;s noirish look has been cited as an influence by the creators of &quot;&quot; among other retro-futuristic works. The Hernandez brothers themselves hold little affection for it, however, with Gilbert once describing it being &quot;like a bad zit... it just sort of happened.&quot; The Hernandez brothers left the book when Vortex failed to pay them in full. Responding to the non-payment accusations, publisher Bill Marks said &quot;I don&#x27;t dispute that one bit. And they&#x27;ll be paid every nickel of it, or every quarter of it.&quot; The Hernandez brothers were indeed ultimately paid for their work on &quot;Mister X&quot; in 1988.

In 2006, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; ranked Hernandez&#x27; work &quot;Ghost of Hoppers&quot; second on its critics&#x27; poll of the best comic books of 2006.

<text>The chacma baboon (Papio ursinus), also known as the Cape baboon, is, like all other baboons, from the Old World monkey family. It is one of the largest of all monkeys. Located primarily in southern Africa, the chacma baboon has a wide variety of social behaviours, including a dominance hierarchy, collective foraging, adoption of young by females, and friendship pairings. These behaviors form parts of a complex evolutionary ecology. In general, the species is not threatened, but human population pressure has increased contact between humans and baboons. Hunting, trapping, and accidents kill or remove many baboons from the wild, thereby reducing baboon numbers and disrupting their social structure.

==Taxonomy==
Due to hybridization between different baboon (&quot;Papio&quot;) populations across Africa, authors have occasionally grouped the entire radiation as a single species, the hamadryas baboon, &quot;Papio hamadryas&quot;. Arbitrary boundaries were then used to separate the populations into subspecies. Other authors once considered the chacma baboon a subspecies of the yellow baboon, &quot;Papio cynocephalus&quot;, although it is now recognised as a separate species, &quot;Papio ursinus&quot;. The chacma baboon has two or three subspecies, depending on which classification is followed. Grubb et al. (2003) lists two subspecies, while Groves (2005) in Mammal Species of the World listed three. This article follows Groves (2005) and describes three distinct subspecies. In the Grubb et al. (2003) paper, &quot;P. u. raucana&quot; was believed to be synonymous with &quot;P. u. ursinus&quot;.
* &quot;Papio ursinus ursinus&quot; Kerr, 1792 – Cape chacma (found in southern South Africa)
* &quot;P. ursinus griseipes&quot; Pocock, 1911 – Gray-footed chacma (found in northern South Africa to southern Zambia)
* &quot;P. ursinus raucana&quot; Shortridge, 1942 – Ruacana chacma (found from Namibia to southern Angola, but not accepted by all authorities as distinct.

==Physical description==

The chacma baboon is perhaps the longest species of monkey, with an adult body length of and tail length of . It is also one of the heaviest; the male weighs from with an average of . Baboons are sexually dimorphic, and females are considerably smaller than males. The adult female chacma weighs from , with an average of . Adult males can in some instances be about twice as long and three times as heavy as adult females. It is similar in size to the olive baboon, averaging slightly higher in mean body mass, and of similar weight to the more compact mandrill, the males of which weigh on average about more than a chacma baboon, the females weigh less than the female chacma. While the mandrill is usually crowned the largest of all modern monkeys, going on total length and average (but not maximum) body weight between the sexes, the chacma baboon appears to be the largest extant monkey. The chacma baboon is generally dark brown to gray in color, with a patch of rough hair on the nape of its neck. Unlike the males of northern baboon species (the Guinea, hamadryas, and olive baboons), chacma males do not have a mane. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this baboon is its long, downward-sloping face. The canine teeth of male chacma baboons have a mean length of at the time they emigrate from their natal troop. This is the time of greatest tooth length as the teeth tend to wear or be broken thereafter.

The three subspecies are differentiated by size and color. The Cape chacma is a large, heavy, dark-brown, and has black feet. The gray-footed chacma is slightly smaller than the Cape chacma, lighter in color and build, and has gray feet. The Ruacana chacma generally appears to be a smaller, less darkly colored version of the Cape chacma.

==Ecology==

===Habitat and distribution===
The chacma baboon inhabits a wide array of habitats including woodland, savanna, steppes, and sub desert, from the grassy alpine slopes of the Drakensberg to the Kalahari Desert. During the night, the chacma baboon sleeps atop steep hills, high cliffs or rocks or in large trees, away from nocturnal predators. In daytime, water availability may limit its range in arid areas. It is found throughout southern Africa, ranging from South Africa north to Angola, Zambia, and Mozambique. The subspecies are divided across this range. The Cape chacma is found in southern South Africa; the gray-footed chacma, is present from northern South Africa, through the Okavango Delta in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique (south of the Zambezi), to southwest Zambia; and the Ruacana chacma is found in northern Namibia and southern Angola.

===Diet===
The chacma baboon is an omnivorous highly opportunistic feeder, and will eat practically anything; typical foods include fruits, seeds, grass, blossoms, bulbs, bark, insects, spiders, worms, grubs, rodents, birds, small antelope and fungi (the desert truffle &quot;Kalaharituber pfeilii&quot;). Chacma baboon diet is thought to contain about 2 percent animal-sourced food, most of which consists of invertebrates; proportions vary between populations. Baboons are considered vermin by most African farmers due to their foraging of cultivated crops and livestock. At the Cape of Good Hope in particular, chacma baboons are also known for taking shellfish and other small marine invertebrates. It is generally a scavenger when it comes to game meat, and rarely engages in hunting larger animals. One incident of a chacma baboon killing a human infant has been reported, but the event is so rare, the locals believed it was due to witchcraft. Normally, wild chacma baboons will flee at the approach of humans, though this is changing due to the easy availability of food and garbage from human dwellings in villages and towns near the baboons&#x27; habitat.

===Predation===

Despite their formidable nature and large size, chacma baboons are vulnerable to a variety of predators. The main wild predator of adult chacma baboons is the leopard. In the Waterberg Biosphere, chacma baboon comprised 20.2% of leopard kills and 18.7% of the leopard&#x27;s prey biomass. Although previously little documented, the African wild dog, a predator of similar or even slightly inferior size to male baboons themselves, in Mana Pools National Park (Zimbabwe) took to chacma baboons as their main prey, comprising 44% of 118 kills. Less routine predation on chacma baboons has been reportedly committed by lions, spotted hyena, Nile crocodiles and African rock pythons (in rough descending likelihood of threat). The predators of infant and juvenile chacma baboons are probably even more diverse but poorly documented. It is documented that Verreaux&#x27;s eagles and martial eagles have taken young chacma baboons and probable or possible predation has been committed by other eagles: crowned eagles and tawny eagles. 

When approaching potentially dangerous sites such as watering holes, more vulnerable members of the chacma baboon group may travel near the rear of the group but may conversely end up by the front of group out of fear if a predator approaches. The adult male chacma baboon has a fearsome defense and may assault their predators with their large, sharp canine teeth, which can seriously injure predators as formidable as leopards, and (despite being far from exempt from predation) the adult males tend to be the least vulnerable members of the baboon troops. As in other monkeys, the larger, more formidable male baboons may successfully defend more vulnerable members of the troop via attacking predators if they come into sight.

==Behaviour==
===Social organisation===
The chacma baboon usually lives in social groups, called troops, which are composed of multiple adult males, adult females, and their offspring. Occasionally, however, very small groups form that consist of only a single adult male and several adult females. 

Chacma troops are characterized by a dominance hierarchy. Female ranking within the troop is inherited through the mother and remains relatively fixed, while the male ranking is often in flux, especially when the dominant male is replaced. Chacmas are unusual among baboons in that neither males nor females form strong relationships with members of the same sex. Instead, the strongest social bonds are often between unrelated adult males and females. Infanticide is much more common among Chacmas compared to most other baboon species, as newly dominant males will often kill infants or young baboons sired by the previously dominant male. Baboon troops possess a complex group behavior and communicate by means of body attitudes, facial expressions, vocalizations and touch.

===Morning dispersal patterns===

The chacma baboon often sleeps in large groups on high rocks, cliffs or in tall trees at night to avoid nocturnal predators. The morning dispersal from the sleeping site is synchronized, with all members leaving at the same time. In most cases, dispersal is initiated by a single individual, and the other members of the group decide whether or not to follow. At least five followers must be recruited for a successful dispersal initiation, and not all initiation attempts are successful. Surprisingly, the initiator&#x27;s dominance status shows little correlation with successful initiation of departure; more-dominant individuals are no more likely to lead a successful departure than subordinate individuals. One study has shown that while the success rate of dispersal initiation attempts is relatively constant across all sexes, male are more likely to attempt initiation than females, and lactating females are less likely to attempt initiation than females without dependent offspring.
A separate study has achieved slightly different results. While the dominance hierarchy does not play a significant role in initiating the morning dispersal, social affiliation does. Chacma baboons that play a more central role in the group (as measured by grooming behavior and time spent with other members) are more likely to be followed during the morning dispersal. This study concluded that group members are more likely to follow the behavior of individuals with which they are closely affiliated.

===Foraging behaviour===
Dominance does play a role in group foraging decisions. A dominant individual (usually the alpha male) leads the group to easily monopolised resources. The group usually follows, even though many subordinate members cannot gain access to that particular resource. As in morning dispersal, the inclination of group members to follow the leader is positively associated with social interactions with that dominant individual.

Collective foraging behaviour, with many individuals taking advantage of the same resource at once, has also been observed. However, this behavior can be chiefly attributed to shared dietary needs rather than social affiliation. Pregnant females, who share similar dietary needs, are more likely to synchronise their behaviour than fertile females. Foraging synchronization decreases in areas with lower food density.

===Adoption===

Adoption behaviour has been observed in chacma baboons. Orphaned baboons whose mothers have died or disappeared are often too small to care for themselves. In one study of nine natural orphans and three introduced orphans, all but one orphan were adopted by another member of the troop. The individual that was not adopted was 16 months old, four months older than the next oldest orphan, and was old enough to survive on its own. Adoption behaviour includes sleeping close to the orphaned infant, grooming and carrying the orphan, and protecting it from harassment by other members of the troop. Both males and females care for infants, and care does not depend on the infant&#x27;s sex. Additionally, nearly all caregivers are pre-reproductive, only four or five years of age. The two major theories explaining this behavior are kin selection, in which caregivers take care of potentially related orphans, and parental practice, in which young baboons increase their own fitness by using an orphan to practice their own parenting skills.

===Friendship===
Males and female chacma baboons often form relationships referred to as &quot;friendships&quot;. These cooperative relationships generally occur between lactating females and adult males. The females are believed to seek out male friendships to gain protection from infanticide. In many baboon species, immigrant alpha males often practice infanticide upon arrival in a new troop. By killing unrelated infants, the new male shortens the time until he can mate with the females of the troop. A female with dependent offspring generally does not become sexually receptive until she weans her offspring at around 12 months of age. However, a mother usually becomes sexually receptive shortly after the death of her offspring.
This protection hypothesis is supported by studies of stress hormones in female baboons during changes in the male hierarchy. When an immigrant male ascends to the top of the male dominance hierarchy, stress hormones in lactating and pregnant females increases, while stress hormones in females not at risk of infanticide stay the same. Additionally, females in friendships with males exhibit a smaller rise in stress hormones than do females without male friends.

The benefits of friendship to males are less clear. A male is more likely to enter into friendships with females with which he has mated, which indicates males might enter into friendships to protect their own offspring and not just to protect that female&#x27;s future reproductive success. These friendships may play a role in the mating system of chacma baboons. A female will often mate with several males, which increases the number of potential fathers for her offspring and increases the chances she will be able to find at least one friend willing to protect her infants and assist in caring for them.

Female chacma baboons have been observed to compete with each other for male friends. This may be the result of one male having a high probability of paternity with multiple females. These competitions are heavily influenced by the female dominance hierarchy, with dominant females displacing subordinate females in friendships with males. Generally, when a more-dominant female attempts to make friends with an individual which is already the friend of a subordinate female, the subordinate female reduces grooming and spatial proximity to that male, potentially leaving her offspring at higher risk of infanticide.

==Relationship with humans==
===Conservation===

The chacma baboon does not rank among threatened animal species. However, in some confined locations, such as South Africa&#x27;s Southern Cape Peninsula, local populations are dwindling due to habitat loss and predation from other protected species, such as leopards and lions. Many troops have become a suburban menace in their search for food, overturning garbage cans, and breaking into cars and houses where they cause much damage. These troops can be dangerous and aggressive, and they will even steal food directly from people. These negative encounters have resulted in the baboons being hunted and poisoned by frustrated local residents. This isolated population is thought to face extinction within 10 years.

The chacma is listed under Appendix II of CITES as it occurs in many protected areas across its range. The only area in South Africa where they are monitored is in the Cape Peninsula, where they are protected.

Observations by those working hands-on in South Africa&#x27;s rehabilitation centers have found this species is damaged by human intervention; troop structures are influenced, and over the years a significant loss in numbers has occurred. Because they live near and invade human habitats, urban baboons are regularly shot, poisoned, electrocuted, beaten to death, run over, and captured for the pet industry, research laboratories and muti (medicine). Despite this, assessors working for the IUCN believe there are no major threats that could result in a range-wide decline of the species.

<text>Melvin and Howard (stylized as Melvin (and Howard)) is a 1980 American comedy-drama film directed by Jonathan Demme. The screenplay by Bo Goldman was inspired by real-life Utah service station owner Melvin Dummar, who was listed as the beneficiary of $156 million in a will allegedly handwritten by Howard Hughes that was discovered in the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City. A novelization of Goldman&#x27;s script, which itself won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay – Written Directly for the Screen, later was written by George Gipe. The film stars Paul Le Mat, Jason Robards, and Mary Steenburgen, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The film was released on September 19, 1980, receiving positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
In the opening scene, Howard Hughes loses control of his motorcycle and crashes in the Nevada desert. That night, he is discovered lying on the side of a stretch of U.S. Highway 95 when Melvin Dummar stops his pickup truck so he can relieve himself. The disheveled stranger, refusing to allow Melvin to take him to the hospital, asks him to instead drive him to Las Vegas, Nevada. En route, the two engage in stilted conversation until Dummar cajoles his passenger into joining him in singing a Christmas song he wrote. Hughes then suggests they sing his favorite song &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;, and they do. The man warms to his rescuer and he is dropped off at the Desert Inn (which Hughes owns and in which he resides).

Most of the remainder of the film focuses on Melvin&#x27;s scattered, up-and-down life, his spendthrift, trust-in-luck nature, his rocky marital life with first wife Lynda, and his more stable relationship with second wife Bonnie. Lynda leaves him and their daughter to dance in a sleazy strip club, but eventually returns, but she remains frustrated by her husband&#x27;s futile efforts to achieve the American dream. Melvin convinces her to appear on &quot;Easy Street&quot;, a game show hybrid of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, and although her tap dancing initially is booed by the audience, she wins them over and nabs the top prize of living room furniture, a piano, and $10,000 cash.

Melvin agrees to invest in an affordable house in a new development, but while Lynda tries to keep their finances under control, he rashly buys a new Cadillac Eldorado and a boat, prompting her to take their daughter and toddler son and sue for divorce. Melvin is comforted by Bonnie, the payroll clerk at the dairy where he drives a truck, and the two eventually wed and move to Utah, where they take over the operation of a service station her relatives had owned.

One day, a mysterious man in a limousine stops at the station ostensibly to buy a pack of cigarettes, but after he drives off Melvin discovers an envelope marked &quot;Last Will and Testament of Howard Hughes&quot; on his office desk. Afraid to open it, he takes it to Mormon headquarters and secrets it in a pile of incoming mail. It doesn&#x27;t take long for the media to descend upon him and his family, and eventually Melvin finds himself in court, admitting he once met Hughes but vigorously denying he forged the will that finally fulfills his dreams.

==Production==
Bo Goldman was originally hired by Universal president Ned Tanen to meet with Melvin Dummar in 1976, and Goldman then worked his story into a screenplay, even after Dummar&#x27;s will was determined to be a fake. Mike Nichols was originally slated to direct the film, with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in talks to star, but all three eventually dropped out of the project and Demme was hired. Filming began in Glendale, California on February 26, 1979, and also took place in Salt Lake City and Willard, Utah as well as Las Vegas, Nevada, lasting a total of 10 weeks and wrapping on May 10, 1979.

Mary Steenburgen revealed that she was worried about having to appear completely naked in the film. &quot;In a scene, I&#x27;m at a strip joint and I quit. I rip off what I&#x27;m wearing, throw it in the air, and walk naked out of the place. The night before the scene, I thought, &#x27;Who is going to be there tomorrow? There&#x27;s going to be a skeleton crew.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t sleep that night, but I thought I was prepared for what was going to happen. I had totally forgotten there were going to be about sixty guys - extras from Central Casting - sitting around. I did it OK for about the first eight times, but I started to lose it. I was becoming upset because these guys kept making comments. I called Malcolm [McDowell], and he said,&#x27;Listen, you&#x27;ve done it. You have already put it on film. Do it one more time, and just try and do it real well.&#x27; I had lost sight of that. I was so busy worrying about my clothes I had forgotten about the moment of it. I knew it was a moment of bravery and freedom, and he reminded me of that. So I went back and I did it really well. As I walked out, I flipped off the construction hat of the guy at the bar and I waved goodbye to all the other dancers on the stage. That is the one they used,&quot; Steenburgen recalled.

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A spirited character study and clear-eyed treatise of the American Dream, &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; hits the jackpot with its lovable cast and director Jonathan Demme&#x27;s humanism.&quot;

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby called the film a &quot;sharp, engaging, very funny, anxious comedy&quot; and commented, &quot;Mr. Demme is a lyrical film maker for whom there is purpose in style...&quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; is commercial American movie-making of a most expansive, entertaining kind.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described it as &quot;wonderful&quot; and added, &quot;This is a slice of American life. It shows the flip side of Gary Gilmore&#x27;s Utah. It is a world of mobile homes, Pop Tarts, dust, kids and dreams of glory. It&#x27;s pretty clear how this movie got made. Hollywood started with the notion that the story of the mysterious Hughes will might make a good courtroom thriller. Well, maybe it would have. But my hunch is that when they met Dummar, they had the good sense to realize that they could get a better – and certainly a funnier – story out of what happened to him between the day he met Hughes and the day the will was discovered. Dummar is the kind of guy who thinks they oughta make a movie out of his life. This time, he was right.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;Jonathan Demme&#x27;s tour-de-force direction, the imaginative screenplay and top-drawer performances from a huge cast fuse in an unusual, original creation.&quot;

Pauline Kael gave the film a very positive review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;Jonathan Demme&#x27;s lyrical comedy &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; which opened the New York Film Festival on September 26, is an almost flawless act of sympathetic imagination. I doubt if Jason Robards has ever been greater than he is here. Mary Steenburgen&#x27;s Lynda Dummar has a soft mouth and a tantalizing slender wiggliness, and she talks directly to whomever she&#x27;s talking to – when she listens, she&#x27;s the kind of woman a man wants to tell more to. Demme shows perhaps a finer understanding of lower-middle-class life than any other American director.&quot;

Dennis Bingham&#x27;s &quot;Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre&quot; cites &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; as the first film in the subgenre &quot;biopic of someone undeserving,&quot; or &quot;BOSUD,&quot; which was later popularized by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski with &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, and &quot;Auto Focus&quot;.

Paul Thomas Anderson has cited the film as one of his favorites. Jason Robards&#x27;s last feature film appearance was in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Magnolia&quot;&quot;. Robert Ridgely, who played the host of the fictional &quot;Easy Street&quot; game show in this movie, would later be cast as Colonel James in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;.

The comedy show &quot;SCTV&quot; parodied the film in a sketch called &quot;Melvin and Howards&quot;. Melvin (Rick Moranis), after picking up Howard Hughes (Joe Flaherty), also picks up Howard Cosell (Eugene Levy), Senator Howard Baker (Dave Thomas), and Curly Howard (John Candy).

<text>Chuang Yi Publishing Pte Ltd. () was a publishing company based in Singapore that specialized in producing domestic and imported comics and comics-related merchandise in English and simplified Chinese. Chuang Yi distributed all or some of its products in Singapore, India, Malaysia and the Philippines. Distribution to Australia and New Zealand occurred through Madman Entertainment and used Australian English translations.

The company is now defunct after ceasing operations in late 2013 and going into liquidation in the following months. Shogakukan Asia formed as the company&#x27;s successor in regards to its intellectual properties.

==History==
Chuang Yi Publishing was founded in 1990 as a distributor of Japanese comics published in simplified Chinese. It had early success with &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, and soon began importing titles from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.

In 1995, Chuang Yi set up its first branch office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and launched two Japanese comic series in Malay. In 1998 and 1999, Chuang Yi published its first TV-drama-to-comic adaptations of &quot;Legend of the Eight Immortals&quot; and &quot;Liang Po Po&quot;. Chuang Yi expanded into the English-language market in 2000 with the launch of its &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, and two Taiwanese comics began serialisation in local newspapers. In 2003, Chuang Yi secured licensing rights to distribute its comics to Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, and in 2004 branched into the magazine market including licensing of several Disney titles. Chuang Yi began distribution of sticker collectibles from Panini Comics and Topps UK in 2004 and 2005, and in 2006 began distribution of comics in India. In 2007, the company secured the rights to develop stationery merchandise for Pokémon and Disney products, and began exclusive distribution of DC Comics and Marvel Comics products to Singapore and Malaysia.

Chuang Yi ceased operations in late 2013 and went into liquidation in the following months. Shogakukan Asia purchased the company&#x27;s intellectual properties and acts as its successor in that capacity.

After 2004, Chuang Yi published magazines based licensed franchises, accompanied by themed real-world events, graphic novels, sticker books, and other merchandise. The magazine contents were Singapore-specific. The franchises include:

* Disney Princess
* Disney Fairies
* Winx Club (up to issue #39; MediaCorp has handled Winx from No. 40 onwards)
* W.I.T.C.H.

In the past they also produced Winnie-the-Pooh and Monster Allergy franchise magazines. Chuang Yi also distributed two imported magazines from Australia: &quot;Bratz&quot; from Otter Press, and &quot;Krash&quot; from Nuclear Media and Publishing. It also held licenses to produce and distribute a variety of stationery products, children&#x27;s toys, keychains, and stickers for the Pokémon and Looney Tunes franchises.

<text>Jonathan J. Hazard (after 1824) was an American statesman and anti-federalist who served as a delegate for Rhode Island in the Continental Congress.

Jonathan was born to a Quaker (Religious Society of Friends) family in Newport, Rhode Island, to Jonathan and Abigail (MacCoon) Hazard. He was known as &quot;Beau Jonathan&quot; to distinguish him form other Rhode Island Hazards, on account of his fondness for dress and his courtly manners. He was first elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1776. In 1777 and early 1778 he served as paymaster of the Rhode Island regiment of the Continental Army. In 1778, he re-entered the Assembly, serving there until 1786. In 1786 and 1787, Rhode Island&#x27;s assembly appointed him as delegate to the Continental Congress. After that, he returned to assembly (serving until 1805), where he became a leader of the anti-federalist Country Party.

Hazard was a delegate to the state&#x27;s ratifying convention that considered the U.S. Constitution in 1789. His active opposition was one of the reasons that the convention adjourned without a vote. By the following spring, he at least chose to remain silent as the Assembly voted in favor of ratification on May 29, 1790. That marked the start of a steady decline in his political influence.

He was married first to Patience Hazard, his second cousin. In 1805 he along with his wife and their younger children moved west to a new settlement that was being established by the Society of Friends (Quakers) in Oneida County, New York. 

His first wife died in 1809, and he married secondly Hannah Brown; his third wife was Marian, daughter of Moses Gage. He died sometime after 1824.

<doc id="1199701" wikidata="Q1390565" url="?curid=1199701" title="Sponson">
<text>Sponsons are projections extending from the sides of land vehicles, aircraft or watercraft to provide protection, stability, storage locations, mounting points for weapons or other devices, or equipment housing.

==Watercraft==
On watercraft, a sponson is a projection that extends outward (usually from the hull, but sometimes other parts of the vessel) to improve stability while floating, or to act as a securing point for other equipment. Vessels with unstable body shapes or unevenly distributed weight are likely to feature sponsons to help prevent capsizing or other instabilities. On many vessels, these projections from the main body of the vessel can be attached and removed quickly and fairly easily.

Canoes and kayaks sometimes feature sponson attachments as well, for stability in rough waters. These differ from outriggers, which extend a significant distance away from the body of the craft, and are employed on craft designed for open waters. A sponson&#x27;s terminus is close to the craft, thereby allowing the boat to maneuver through narrower spaces, and so is more likely to be used on smaller craft that still require maneuverability through narrow passages.

In the mid-1990s, advances in sponson design made sponsons a tool for better handling at high speeds, and they began being added to racing boats.

There are essentially three types of sponsons for watercraft available on the market todaythe basic block type, the hooked or winged type, and the paddle or rudder type.

===Block sponsons===
The block type is the simplest type. The leading end is usually rounded or pointed for reduced drag. &quot;Its main function is to provide additional lift on the back of the hull, mostly during acceleration. It can also help provide better side-to-side stability at speed and reduce by providing a bit more hull surface at the rear of the craft.&quot;

===Winged/hooked sponsons===
Winged or hooked sponsons are the most common type. In addition to added lift during acceleration, better side-to-side stability, and reduced porpoising, they provide improved handling. &quot;The outside edge provides grip in turns, allowing you to turn sharper and faster without fear of the back end sliding out. They can also provide a pivot point for the hull in turns.&quot; One of the most overlooked benefits of this type of sponson is that riders can lean into turns more, making watercraft easier to push to their limits.

===Paddle/rudder sponsons===
Paddle or rudder-type sponsons, which use a flat paddle-shaped rudder attached vertically to a block-type sponson, do essentially the same thing, but the effect can be even more dramatic, because the flat paddle or rudder portion of the sponson provides a sharper and more pronounced edge to catch the water.

==Aircraft==
On flying boatsas first patented by Claudius Dornier and first used on the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;″s German World War I flying boat, the Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.IVa sponson can help extend the hull higher in the water, reducing drag and providing additional lift when the plane is taking off. 

Helicopters may also feature one or more sponsons, and though most helicopters are not designed to land in or take off from water, these safety features are important should the aircraft crash land in water. Sponsons on a helicopter can also store fuel or landing gear, e.g., the Sikorsky S-92 and the Bell 222. When mounted on aircraft, they must be adjusted properly for aerodynamics when the aircraft is in flight; if not adjusted properly, they might destabilize or damage the aircraft.

==Military==
On land vessels, such as tanks or other military vehicles, and on naval warships, a sponson may refer to a mounting or enclosure projecting from the side or top of the structure/hull that is not used for buoyancy, but for armaments such as machine guns, or for purposes of visibility. In the case of warships of the late 19th to early 20th centuries, the sponson could be enclosed and combined with a casemate, similar to those of early British heavy tanks. Alternatively, a sponson could be open-topped for a pivoting gun (which could be fitted with a backless blast shield or unshielded). Often a collapsing bulwark would be mounted around the edge of an sponson to improve seaworthiness. Later examples of open-topped sponsons on warships were even used to mount fully-enclosed turrets upon and were sometimes combined with an embrasure of the hull. It can be used for storage as well as a transport platform for people entering or leaving the vehicle. It may also provide layers of bulletproof protection and storage space, as found over the tracks of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

<text>Theropithecus is a genus of primates in the family Cercopithecidae. It contains a single living species, the gelada (&quot;Theropithecus gelada&quot;), native to the Ethiopian Highlands.

Additional species are known from fossils, including:
* &quot;Theropithecus brumpti&quot;
* &quot;Theropithecus darti&quot;
* &quot;Theropithecus oswaldi&quot;
The earliest remains probably belonging to the genus are from Kanapoi, Kenya, dating to the early Pliocene, around 4.1-4.2 million years ago.

Although most remains are known from Africa, during the Early Pleistocene the genus had a broader distribution ranging from southern Europe, including Spain and possibly Italy, to the Indian subcontinent.

<doc id="1199716" wikidata="Q1522772" url="?curid=1199716" title="Capsizing">
<text>Capsizing or keeling over occurs when a boat or ship is rolled on its side or further by wave action, instability or wind force beyond the angle of positive static stability or it is upside down in the water. The act of recovering a vessel from a capsize is called righting. Capsize may result from broaching, , loss of stability due to cargo shifting or flooding, or in high speed boats, from turning too fast.
If a capsized vessel has enough flotation to prevent sinking, it may recover on its own in changing conditions or through mechanical work if it is not stable while inverted. Vessels of this design are called self-righting.

==Small vessels==

In dinghy sailing, a practical distinction can be made between being knocked down (to 90 degrees; on its , figuratively) which is called a capsize, and being inverted, which is called being turtled. Small dinghies frequently capsize in the normal course of use and can usually be recovered by the crew. Some types of dinghy are occasionally deliberately capsized, as capsizing and righting the vessel again can be the fastest means of draining water from the boat.

Capsizing (but not necessarily turtling) is an inherent part of dinghy sailing. It is not a question of &quot;if&quot; but a question of &quot;when&quot;. For those who do not want the experience, a keelboat monohull has physics on its side. But even yachts can capsize and turtle in extraordinary conditions, so design considerations are important. Such events can overcome skill and experience; boats need to be appropriate for foreseeable conditions.
A capsized kayak may be righted with a roll or eskimo rescue. As long as the kayaker knows how to react, the water is not too shallow, and the location is not close to dangers that require evasive action by the kayaker – which cannot be taken while capsized – capsizing itself is usually not considered dangerous. In whitewater kayaking, capsizing occurs frequently and is accepted as an ordinary part of the sport. Kayak rolling, in which paddlers intentionally capsize and right themselves (in synchrony, as many times as possible in a given interval, or in as many different ways as possible) is also a competitive sport, especially in Greenland.

Sailing vessels&#x27; &quot;capsize ratio&quot; is commonly published as a guideline for zones of safe operation — less than 2.0 means as a rule-of-thumb suitability for offshore navigation. However its crude nature of displacement divided by a vessel&#x27;s beam (breadth) (albeit with a constant multiplied to provide an average assessment), means thorough assessment of ship stability, immersibility and buoyancy involves other factors to address the relevant risks posed by waves, tides, weather and occurrences such as damage and collision.
==Large vessels==
In a storm, even large vessels may be rolled by being hit broadside by a large wave or swell or &quot;pitch poled&quot; stem over stern in extreme waves. This is normally catastrophic for larger ships, and smaller yachts can be dismasted (i.e., lose their masts and rigging) due to the drag as the boat is forced to roll over.

A ship that sustains a hole or crack (&#x27;is holed&#x27;) may capsize. This is the working of torpedo and naval mine warfare. In 2012 the very large cruise ship &quot;&quot; was holed and lost her propulsion by striking a charted rock, and drifted further where she partially sank just outside the harbor entrance, coming to rest with her starboard side submerged and resting on the seafloor with approximately two-thirds of her structure above the sea. This was not a capsize as her bottom was only partly exposed; rather this was a partial sinking. Fixing a hole is called plugging.
Otherwise a vessel in largely upright position which capsizes has suffered too much water to enter in places normally above the waterline, and which may be caused by poor manoeuvering, overloading (see Plimsoll Line) or poor weather. As for holes, bailing may be carried out – removal of water aboard such as with a bilge pump, self or hand bailer, buckets or de-watering pumps. At the stage of sinking where its buoyancy is deemed critical, the ship is unlikely to upright nor able to right itself such that stability and safety will be compromised even if the vessel is righted — a decision is made to abandon ship and any ultimate salvage may entail firm grounding and re-buoyancy pumps. Among ship types, a roll-on-roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ship is more prone to capsizing as it has large open car decks near the waterline. If the watertight car-deck doors fail through damage or mismanagement (as in the partial sinking of where the doors were accidentally left open, and as in one of the largest peacetime maritime disasters when sank off of the Archipelago Sea in Finland), water entering the car-deck is subject to the free surface effect and may cause a capsize. As a RORO ferry rolls, vehicles can break free and slide down if not firmly secured, adversely altering the ship&#x27;s centre of gravity, accelerating the roll, and possibly turning an otherwise recoverable roll into a capsize.

== Competition ==

In competitive yacht racing, a capsized boat has certain special rights as it cannot maneuver. A boat is deemed capsized when the mast is touching the water; when it is fully inverted, it is said to have turned turtle or turtled. Good racers can often recover from a capsize with minimal loss of time.

The capsize can result from extreme broaching, especially if the keel has insufficient leverage to tilt the vessel upright.

Some rescue lifeboats, for example the RNLI&#x27;s Severn-class are designed to be self-righting if capsized, but most other motorboats are not.

==Training==
Intermediate sailors are encouraged to capsize their dinghies in a safe location with supervision at least once to become acquainted with their boat&#x27;s floating properties and the capsize process. The boat is then righted, bailed out, and the sails reset, so that in the event of an uncontrolled capsize, the boat and its occupants are familiar with the procedure and may recover.

Most small monohull sailboats can normally be righted by standing or pulling down on the centreboard, daggerboard (or bilgeboard in a scow) to lift the mast clear of the water. Depending on the design of the hull, the boat&#x27;s righting moment will normally take effect once the mast is around 30 degrees from horizontal and help pull the boat vertical. Righting a catamaran that is lying on its side involves using a righting line fed over the upper hull. The crew stands on the lower hull and pulls back on the righting line. In small catamarans such as the Hobie 16 it is imperative that at least one crew member assumes this task as soon as possible as there is a chance that the boat will turtle and then become extremely difficult to recover without assistance. Some monohulls and catamarans use a small flotation device mounted at the tip of the mast or mainsail to ensure that the craft cannot assume an inverted position, or at least that a fully inverted position is not stable (i.e. it would come to a position where the mast is lying on the surface of the water, which would be preferable to fully inverted).

In both cases, having a crew member lift the end of the mast out of the water may help speed the process, as the greatest challenge of righting a capsized boat is shedding the weight of the water from the sails. A helpful step, where possible (on a loose footed sail), is to disconnect the clew of the sail from the boom, which prevents the sail from scooping up water as the sail lifts out of the water. The bow of the capsized vessel should be pointed towards the wind so that when the sail starts to lift out of the water the wind can catch underneath the sail and help right the boat.

Care is taken not to let the boat swing all the way over and capsize on the other side, frequently with the crew on the bottom. This is more likely if the boat is not pointed into the wind.

==Prevention==
There is a wide range of technology that can be installed or strategically placed to prevent or deter a boat or ship from capsizing. The various technologies rely on inflating airbags also known as lift bags which increasing the vessel&#x27;s buoyancy with the water. There are many steps a crew can take to reduce the chance of capsizing, such as distributing the weight evenly and taking care during windy weather.

===Yachts===
Capsizing in yachts can occur when water is able to infiltrate the hull and decrease the vessels water and buoyancy leading to capsizing. Yachts can be deployed with a flotation system which is a series of strategically placed lift bags within the interior of the hull increasing the vessel&#x27;s buoyancy and filling void space where water can collect, providing valuable time to remove the water, fix damage or evacuate.

===Large ships===
When larger ships such as cargo ships and tankers capsize or sink not only is recovery not possible but great environment damage can occur from spillage of cargo. Larger ships are being equipped with Surfacing System for Ship Recovery which is an inflatable device that is installed in the ballast water tank or within the hull of the vessel and can be deployed within seconds of an accident to stabilize the vessel and give more time for rescue and evacuation.

==Self-righting==
A vessel may be designated as &quot;self-righting&quot; if it is designed to be able to capsize then return to upright without intervention (with or without crew on board). The angle of vanishing stability, the angle of heel at which a vessel becomes unstable and does not bob back upright, does not exist; a self-righting boat will return to upright from any position, including completely upside-down. A self-righting vessel must be positively buoyant when swamped. There are three methods of making a vessel self-right: careful distribution of stationary weight and buoyancy, inflatable airbags, and movable ballast.

A basic tool for calculating a vessel&#x27;s stability is a static stability diagram, which plots the angle of heel on the horizontal axis and the righting lever (GZ) on the vertical axis. (see metacentric height for details). If the static stability curve never crosses the x-axis, the boat is not stable upside-down. This is not sufficient to build a boat with good stability at sea, as it neglects the effects of wind, waves, and human occupants, but it is a simple, powerful way to analyze the stability of a vessel. See also primary stability and secondary stability.

Self-righting through distribution of weight and buoyancy requires the weight low-down, and the buoyancy high up. It is often accomplished with a self-sealing superstructure, such as the large deckhouses on modern rescue boats.

Most small craft intended as lifeboats with rigid (rather than inflatable) hulls designed since about the middle of the twentieth century are self-righting.

Small radio-controlled boats may also self-right. This is particularly useful for racing.

<doc id="1199717" wikidata="Q2307611" url="?curid=1199717" title="Vernon Maxwell">
<text>Vernon Maxwell (born September 12, 1965) is an American former professional basketball player. He was a shooting guard in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for thirteen seasons during the late 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.

Maxwell played college basketball for the University of Florida, and led the Florida Gators to their first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. He was selected by the Denver Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA draft and was immediately traded to the San Antonio Spurs. His longest and most successful NBA tenure was with the Houston Rockets.

The nickname &quot;Mad Max&quot; was bestowed upon Maxwell by color commentators for his clutch three-point shooting, which reached its pinnacle in the deciding game of the 1994 NBA Finals between Houston and New York. Maxwell is among just nine players in NBA history to amass 30 points in a single quarter, accomplishing that feat en route to a 51-point outing on January 26, 1991, against Cleveland.

==Early years==
Maxwell was born in Gainesville, Florida. He attended Buchholz High School in Gainesville, and played for the Buchholz Bobcats high school basketball team. As a senior, Maxwell was the Mr. Basketball of the state of Florida as well as being an all-state defensive back in football.

==College career==
Maxwell received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida, where he played for coach Norm Sloan&#x27;s Florida Gators men&#x27;s basketball from 1984 to 1988. The 6-foot-4 guard averaged 20.2 points as a senior and still holds 15 Gators team records. He left school after four years as the Gators&#x27; all-time leading scorer (2,450) and the No. 2 scorer in Southeastern Conference history behind LSU&#x27;s Pete Maravich. He averaged more than 20 points in both his junior and senior seasons, although Florida would erase all the points Maxwell scored in those seasons due to Maxwell taking money from agents and accepting a free round-trip ticket to go to a basketball camp.

==Professional career==

On June 28, 1988, Maxwell was drafted into the NBA by the Denver Nuggets, who traded him the same day to the San Antonio Spurs for a second-round pick the next year. Two years later, his contract was sold to the Houston Rockets for $50,000, where he would become a key member of the franchise&#x27;s first championship team in 1994. Known for his clutch shooting, Maxwell hit several game-winning shots throughout his career. Maxwell held the NBA&#x27;s record for most 3-pointers made in a season from 1991 to 1993. In January 1991, he became the fourth player to score 30 points in a quarter when he scored 30 of his career high 51 points in the fourth quarter of the Rockets 103–97 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers. On February 6, 1995, Maxwell went into the stands in a road game against the Portland Trail Blazers and punched a fan that had allegedly made racial comments and derogatory remarks about the player&#x27;s stillborn daughter. The fan, Steve George, denied Maxwell&#x27;s allegations. Maxwell was suspended for 10 games and fined $20,000 for the incident. At the time, it was the highest fine in NBA history and the second longest suspension. Maxwell was not a part of the Rockets&#x27; 1995 championship roster, quitting the team after a loss to Utah in the 1995 playoffs. Clyde Drexler, who Houston had acquired in February 1995, had taken away most of Maxwell&#x27;s minutes and his starting spot. The decision to quit the team is something that Maxwell has been said to regret. He was waived by the Rockets in June 1995.

He signed with the Seattle SuperSonics prior to the 1999–2000 season. In March, he got into a fight with Sonics star Gary Payton and accidentally hit Horace Grant with a 5-pound weight, when he was trying to break up the fight, injuring Grant&#x27;s shoulder and forcing him to miss the Sonics next game. Shortly before the Sonics&#x27; first round series against the Utah Jazz, it was reported that he would miss the playoffs due to a knee injury, much to the delight of Utah&#x27;s players.

==Personal life==
In August 1995, Maxwell was charged with and convicted of misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance after Houston police reportedly found marijuana in his vehicle during a traffic stop. He would later file appeals to overturn his conviction, but was forced to surrender himself to Houston authorities in April 1998 after the United States Supreme Court refused to hear his case.

In February 1996, Maxwell was ordered by a court to pay $592,000 to Sheila Rias after failing to respond to her lawsuit alleging him of knowingly infecting her with herpes in 1995. Maxwell received a new trial after claiming Rias had served him improperly, then received a third trial after another default judgment. One day before the third trial was set to begin, Maxwell filed for bankruptcy.

In the summer of 1996, Maxwell took his eight-year-old son, Dominique, to Shands Hospital for a blood test in the hopes of refuting paternity. After the test proved he was the father, Maxwell gave Dominique $40 if he promised not to tell his mother, Myra Jenkins.

In April 2004, Maxwell spent five days in jail in Gainesville for failure to pay $150,000 in child support to Jenkins. After release, he was extradited to Cobb County on charges of kidnapping and aggravated assault against Belinda Beine, who was described as a recent companion.

In August 2020, Maxwell made allegations of racial discrimination against Emerson police after being arrested on charges of aggravated stalking, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, operating a vehicle without a current license plate, operating a truck with an obstructed license plate, not having his driver&#x27;s license in his immediate possession when operating a motor vehicle, possession of an open container of an alcoholic beverage in the passenger area, and driving under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.

<doc id="1199733" wikidata="Q2481414" url="?curid=1199733" title="Road case">
<text>A road case, ATA case or flight case is a shipping container specifically built to protect musical instruments, motion picture equipment, audio and lighting production equipment, props, firearms, or other sensitive equipment when it must be frequently moved between locations by ground or air. Many varying-sized road cases can be built to outfit the needs of an entire concert tour, or custom designed individually for a specific industry or product.

The term road case is mostly used in the United States and implies that the case is primarily for road-based travel, unlike a flight case. The term originates from its use for storing and shipping band equipment while the musicians were on the road.

== History ==
The history of flight case design is based on an airplane parts packaging specification. It was designed by airline packaging engineers. The specification is ATA 300. Category I cases are designed to withstand a minimum of 100 round trips, Category II containers a minimum of 10 round trips, and Category III containers 1 round trip as defined to also include the return of a replacement part. Because of visibility requirements during nighttime airline operations, the recommended color of reusable cases is white, but the requirement is waived to permit a carrier&#x27;s traditional or logo colors except for very dark colors. The first ATA 300 spec was published on August 1, 1960.

== Construction ==

Most cases are fabricated from panels joined by metal or plastic extrusions, molded plastic, or metal. Fabricated cases are typically made from panels constructed of two layers. An outer layer of ABS or fiberglass laminate is adhered to a middle layer of lightweight cabinet-grade plywood such as birch, poplar, or maple. These two layers are known as laminate panel, and high-grade cases are made from composite material. Inside the case, an internal shock-absorbing filler such as polyurethane or polyethylene foam has cavities that correspond to the shape of the components it is preserving. Alternate shock protection methods include mounting the case contents to racks or panels attached to the case walls with shock isolators. The corners of fabricated cases are commonly reinforced with stamped sheet steel case corners commonly finished in zinc, nickel, chrome. 

The term &quot;ATA case&quot; is frequently used to describe cases that resemble those that comply with ATA Specification 300 category I or II, but have not been certified by the independent testing defined in ATA Specification 300. Category I and II cases are required to be tested both as a pre-production prototype and as a sample selected from the first production lot. Tests include stackability, drop or impact, water resistance, vibration (category I only), and penetration (category I only). Of these, the drop test, stackability, and vibration tests are probably the most severe. For cases under gross (loaded) the drop test requires 160 face drops from , 80 edge drops from , and 40 corner drops from 36 inches. The face drop distance is reduced to up to , , or more. Category II cases are dropped one-tenth as many times from and at 50 pounds, and proportionally for heavier cases. The stackability test requires every case face over to support centered on of the face for 24 hours. The vibration test searches for the four strongest resonances between 5 and 50 Hz, and then tests each at for 2 hours on each principal axis. The penetration test is a 6-kilogram steel bar 3.2 centimeters in diameter with a hemispherical end dropped 0.5 meters on the weakest point. For all tests no degradation or functional damage is allowed.

Caster wheels are often built into or attached to the case for ease of transit, and may be removable to prevent damage to other containers or to the airframe.

Molded cases are typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene plastic by injection molding or rotational molding and may be gasketed for splash protection. They typically have similar interior and wheel options as fabricated panel cases. The ATA specified performance temperature range tends to exclude thermoplastic cases large enough to be subject to the stackability test.

Cases may be further customized by adding a power adapter and a computer fan. Thus certain equipment may operate in transit or at destination without leaving the protection of the case.

== Uses ==
Typical uses for road cases on tour are wardrobe, hair and make-up, catering, rigging, backline, sound reinforcement equipment, stage lighting, video, production and carpentry. Road cases got their name because they are usually used by touring entertainment companies that need to take their show out &#x27;on the road&#x27;. Road cases configured with rackmounts are widely used on the road for pro audio, lighting, sound recording and video. Other applications include motion picture production, military, sports, medical, rental and staging.

In January 2020, the former head of Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, Carlos Ghosn apparently escaped from Japan hidden in a road case.

<text>The POWER1 is a multi-chip CPU developed and fabricated by IBM that implemented the POWER instruction set architecture (ISA). It was originally known as the RISC System/6000 CPU or, when in an abbreviated form, the RS/6000 CPU, before introduction of successors required the original name to be replaced with one that used the same naming scheme (POWER&quot;n&quot;) as its successors in order to differentiate it from the newer designs.

== History ==
The POWER1 was introduced in 1990, with the introduction of the IBM RS/6000 POWERserver servers and POWERstation workstations, which featured the POWER1 clocked at 20, 25 or 30 MHz. The POWER1 received two upgrades, one in 1991, with the introduction of the POWER1+ and in 1992, with the introduction of POWER1++. These upgraded versions were clocked higher than the original POWER1, made possible by improved semiconductor processes. The POWER1+ was clocked slightly higher than the original POWER1, at frequencies of 25, 33 and 41 MHz, while the POWER1++ took the microarchitecture to its highest frequencies — 25, 33, 41.6, 45, 50 and 62.5 MHz. In September 1993, the POWER1 and its variants was succeeded by the POWER2 (known briefly as the &quot;RIOS2&quot;), an evolution of the POWER1 microarchitecture.

The direct derivatives of the POWER1 are the RISC Single Chip (RSC), feature-reduced single-chip variant for entry-level RS/6000 systems, and the RAD6000, a radiation-hardened variant of the RSC for space applications. An indirect derivative of the POWER1 is the PowerPC 601, a feature-reduced variant of the RSC intended for consumer applications.

The POWER1 is notable as it represented a number of firsts for IBM and computing in general. It was IBM&#x27;s first RISC processor intended for high-end applications (the ROMP was considered a commercial failure and was not used in high-end workstations), it was the first to implement the then new POWER instruction set architecture and it was IBM&#x27;s first successful RISC processor. For computing firsts, the POWER1 would be known for being the first CPU to implement some form of register renaming and out-of-order execution, a technique that improves the performance of superscalar processors but was previously reserved for mainframes.

The POWER1 was also the origin for the highly successful families of POWER, PowerPC and Power ISA processors that followed it, measuring in hundreds of different implementations.

The open source GCC compiler removed support for POWER1 (RIOS) and POWER2 (RIOS2) in the 4.5 release.

== Microarchitecture ==

The POWER1 is a 32-bit two-way superscalar CPU. It contains three major execution units, a fixed-point unit (FXU), a branch unit (BPU) and a floating point unit (FPU). Although the POWER1 is a 32-bit CPU with a 32-bit physical address, its virtual address is 52 bits long. The larger virtual address space was chosen because it was beneficial for the performance of applications, allowing each one to have a large 4 GB address range.

The POWER1 is a big-endian CPU that uses a Harvard style cache hierarchy with separate instruction and data caches. The instruction cache, referred to as the &quot;I-cache&quot; by IBM, is 8 KB in size and is two-way set associative with a line size of 64 bytes. The I-cache is located on the ICU chip. The data cache, referred to as the &quot;D-cache&quot; by IBM, is 32 KB in size for RIOS.9 configurations and 64 KB in size for RIOS-1 configurations. The D-cache is four-way set associative with a line size of 128 bytes. The D-cache employs a store-back scheme, where data that is to be stored is written to the cache instead of the memory in order to reduce the number of writes destined for the memory. The store-back scheme is used to prevent the CPU from monopolizing access to the memory.

Although the POWER1 was a high-end design, it was not capable of multiprocessing, and as such was disadvantaged, as the only way performance could be improved was by clocking the CPU higher, which was difficult to do with such a large multi-chip design. IBM used clustering to overcome this disadvantage in POWER1 systems, allowing them to effectively function as if they were multiprocessing systems, a concept proven by the popularity of SP1 supercomputers based on the POWER1. As the POWER1 was the basis of the POWER2 and P2SC microprocessors, the lack of multiprocessing was passed on to these later POWER processors. Multiprocessing was not supported until the introduction of the POWER3 in 1998.

== Physical description ==


The POWER1 is a multi-chip CPU built from separate chips that are connected to each other by buses. The POWER1 consists of an instruction-cache unit (ICU), a fixed-point unit (FXU), a floating point unit (FPU), a number of data-cache units (DCU), a storage-control unit (SCU) and an I/O unit. Due to its modular design, IBM was able to create two configurations by simply varying the number of DCUs, RIOS-1 and a RIOS.9. The RIOS-1 configuration has four DCUs, the intended amount, and was clocked at up to 40 MHz, whereas the RIOS.9 CPU had two DCUs and was clocked at lower frequencies.

The chips are mounted on the “CPU planar”, a printed circuit board (PCB), using through-hole technology. Due to the large number of chips with wide buses, the PCB has eight planes for routing wires, four for power and ground and four for signals. There are two signal planes on each side of the board, while the four power and ground planes are in the center.

The chips that make up the POWER1 are fabricated in a 1.0 μm CMOS process with three layers of interconnect. The chips are packaged in ceramic pin grid array (CPGA) packages that can have up to 300 pins and dissipate a maximum of 4 W of heat each. The total number of transistors featured by the POWER1, assuming that it is a RIOS-1 configuration, is 6.9 million, with 2.04 million used for logic and 4.86 million used for memory. The die area of all the chips combined is 1,284 mm2. The total number of signal pins is 1,464.

=== Chips ===

==== Instruction-cache unit (ICU) ====

The ICU contains the instruction cache, referred to as the &quot;I-cache&quot; by IBM and the branch processing unit (BPU). The BPU contains the program counter, the condition code register and a loop register. The ICU contains 0.75 million transistors with 0.2 million used for logic and 0.55 million used for SRAM. The ICU die measures approximately 160 mm2 (12.7 × 12.7 mm).

The BPU was capable of dispatching multiple instructions to the fixed and floating point instructions queues while it was executing a program flow control instruction (up to four simultaneously and out of order). Speculative branches were also supported by using a prediction bit in the branch instructions, with the results discarded before being saved if the branch was not taken. The alternate instruction would be buffered and discarded if the branch was taken. Consequently, subroutine calls and interrupts are dealt with without incurring branch penalties.

The condition code register has eight field sets, with the first two reserved for fixed and floating point instructions and the seventh for vector instructions. The rest of the fields could be used by other instructions. The loop register is a counter for &quot;decrement and branch on zero&quot; loops with no branch penalty, a feature similar to those found in some DSPs such as the TMS320C30.

==== Fixed-point unit (FXU) ====

The FXU is responsible for decoding and executing all fixed-point instructions and floating-point load and store instructions. For execution, the FXU contains the POWER1&#x27;s fixed-point register file, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) for general instructions, and a dedicated fixed-point multiply and divide unit. It also contains instruction buffers that receive both fixed- and floating-point instructions from the ICU, passing on the floating-point instructions to the FPU, and a 128-entry two-way set-associative D-TLB for address translation. The FXU contains approximately 0.5 million transistors, with 0.25 million used for logic and 0.25 used for memory, on a die measuring approximately 160 mm2.

==== Floating-point unit (FPU) ====

The POWER1&#x27;s floating point unit executes floating-point instructions issue by the ICU. The FPU is pipelined and can execute single precision (32-bit) and double precision (64-bit) instructions. It is capable of performing multiply-add instructions, which contributed to the POWER1&#x27;s high floating point performance. In most processors, a multiply and an add, which is common in technical and scientific floating-point code, cannot be executed in one cycle, as in the POWER1. Use of fused multiply–add also means that the data is only rounded once, improving the precision of the result slightly.

The floating-point register file is also located on the FPU chip. It contains 32 64-bit floating-point registers, six rename registers and two registers that are used by divide instructions.

==== Data-cache unit (DCU) ====

The POWER1 has a 64 KB data cache implemented through four identical data-cache units (DCU), each containing 16 KB of data cache. The cache and the buses that connect the DCU to the other chips are ECC protected. The DCUs also provide the interface to the memory. If two DCUs are present (RIOS.9 configuration), the memory bus is 64 bits wide, and if four DCUs are present (RIOS-1 configuration), the memory bus is 128 bits wide. The memory interface portion of the DCUs provide three features that improves the reliability and availability of the memory: memory scrubbing, ECC and bit steering. Each DCU contains approximately 1.125 million transistors, with 0.175 million used for logic and 0.95 million used for SRAM, on a die measuring approximately 130 mm² (11.3 × 11.3 mm).

==== Storage-control unit (SCU) ====

The POWER1 is controlled by the SCU chip. All communications between the ICU, FXU and DCU chips as well as the memory and I/O devices is arbitrated by the SCU. Although the DCUs provide the means to perform memory scrubbing, it is the SCU that controls the process. The SCU contains approximately 0.23 million transistors, all of them for logic, on a die measuring approximately 130 mm2.

==== I/O unit ====

The POWER1&#x27;s I/O interfaces are implemented by the I/O unit, which contains an I/O channel controller (IOCC) and two serial link adapters (SLAs). The IOCC implements the Micro Channel interface and controls both I/O and DMA transactions between the Micro Channel adapters and the system memory. The two SLAs each implement a serial fibre optic link, which are intended to connect RS/6000 systems together. The optical links were not supported at the time of the RS/6000&#x27;s release. The I/O unit contains approximately 0.5 million transistors, with 0.3 million used for logic and 0.2 million used for memory, on a die measuring approximately 160 mm2.

<doc id="1199746" wikidata="Q465196" url="?curid=1199746" title="Rex Brown">
<text>Rex Robert Brown (born July 27, 1964) is an American musician. He is the longtime bassist for heavy metal band Pantera, having joined the band in 1982. Following the band&#x27;s reunion in 2022, Brown is the longest-serving member of the band. He is also a former member of the supergroup Down (2001–2011) and a former bassist for Kill Devil Hill. He released his debut solo album &quot;Smoke on This…&quot; in 2017. For the first time in Brown&#x27;s career, the work features him not only as a bassist but also as lead vocalist and guitarist.

Brown authored a book called &quot;Official Truth 101 Proof&quot;, which was released in April 2013. The book documents Pantera&#x27;s formation, career, and disbandment.

==Early life==
Rex Robert Brown was born in Graham, Texas, on July 27, 1964. His father was 40 when Brown was born, and died in 1971. He was raised by his mother and sister. Brown was first introduced to music through his grandmother, who taught him to play the piano when he was a child, and turned him onto ragtime music and Scott Joplin. Brown was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. Brown became a fan of ZZ Top and Def Leppard as a youth, and started playing bass when he was twelve years old. Other significant influences include Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and hardcore punk.

==Career==
===Pantera===

Pantera was formed in 1981. Brown joined Pantera on bass in 1982 replacing Tommy D. Bradford and adopting the alias &quot;Rex Rocker&quot;. Brown was a classmate of, and played in the high school jazz band with, drummer Vinnie Paul, and guitarist Dimebag Darrell (then known as Diamond Darrell). Brown was credited as &quot;Rex Rocker&quot; on Pantera&#x27;s first four albums: &quot;Metal Magic&quot; (1983), &quot;Projects in the Jungle&quot; (1984), &quot;I Am the Night&quot; (1985), and &quot;Power Metal&quot; (1988), he would be credited by his birth name starting with the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, and onwards.

Pantera recruited vocalist Phil Anselmo to replace Terry Glaze in 1986. With Anselmo taking over as the new frontman, the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Power Metal&quot;, was released in 1988. In 1989, the band was signed with Atco Records, and released their fifth album, &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, in the following year, which proved to be the band&#x27;s turning point to commercial success. Over the course of the band&#x27;s walkthrough in the 1990s decade, Pantera released four more studio albums, &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; (1992), &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; (1994), &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; (1996), and &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; (2000). After releases of a 1997 live album and a greatest hits compilation, Pantera was nominated for four best metal performance Grammys, for &quot;I&#x27;m Broken&quot;, &quot;Suicide Note Pt. I&quot;, &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot;, and &quot;Revolution Is My Name&quot;.

In 2001, Pantera went on what at the time was believed to be a temporary hiatus, mainly due to Anselmo&#x27;s focus on side projects. Pantera would officially disband in 2003.

In July 2022, it was announced that Brown would be joining Anselmo, along with Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante (as the respective fill-ins of Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul), for Pantera&#x27;s first world tour in 22 years in 2023.

===Down===
In 1998, during his stay in Louisiana, he was invited by Phil Anselmo for a jam session that included all the members of Down except their bass player Todd Strange, who left the band. That night they ended up writing several demos for what later became their second album recorded in the fall of 2001 at Anselmo&#x27;s barn that had been transformed into a professional studio. The album was released on March 26, 2002, and became the first Down release featuring Brown on bass. The band, however, went on hiatus again at the very end of 2002.

In 2006, the band reunited and started writing the material for their third studio album. &quot;Down III: Over the Under&quot; was released in 2007. The band toured as the opening act for Metallica. During that time, he became good friends with James Hetfield, who—similarly to Brown—completed an alcohol rehabilitation course back in 2002.

Wanting to explore different music, Brown left Down in 2011.

===Other work===

In 1999, Brown, Dimebag Darrell, and Vinnie Paul teamed up with country artist David Allan Coe in a project called Rebel Meets Rebel. This group released an album on May 2, 2006, on Vinnie Paul&#x27;s Big Vin Records label.

Brown has worked previously with Jerry Cantrell on five tracks included on the album called &quot;Boggy Depot&quot; as well as eleven tracks with Crowbar on the album &quot;Lifesblood for the Downtrodden&quot;. He has also provided bass work for Crowbar in 2004 and 2005 and to Cavalera Conspiracy in 2008. Rex revealed his new project Arms of the Sun, a project also featuring John Luke Hebert (of King Diamond) on drums, Lance Harvill on vocals and guitar, and Ben Bunker (of Gryn) on guitar. The group has completed work on thirteen tracks at Willie Nelson&#x27;s Pedernales Recording Studio in Austin, produced and mixed by Terry Date. In February 2011 it was announced that Brown had amicably left Arms of the Sun. A replacement bassist has not yet been announced.

In March 2011, it was announced that Brown had formed a new band, Kill Devil Hill with Vinny Appice (Heaven &amp; Hell, Black Sabbath, Dio) on drums, Mark Zavon (Ratt, W.A.S.P., 40 Cycle Hum) on guitar and Dewey Bragg (Pissing Razors) on vocals. The group has demoed around 10 songs, which, according to Appice, sound &quot;like a cross between Black Sabbath, Alice in Chains and a little bit of Led Zeppelin thrown in. It&#x27;s heavy, but with a lot of cool hooks and melodic overtones, too.&quot; Kill Devil Hill released their debut album in May 2012 to critical acclaim, and continue to tour in support of their music.

In 2013, Brown released an autobiography, titled &quot;Official Truth: 101 Proof&quot;, which chronicles his personal life and journey through Pantera, including the events leading to the band&#x27;s disbandment.

In 2015, Brown penned the foreword to the book &quot;Survival of the Fittest: Heavy Metal in the 1990s&quot;, by author Greg Prato. Rex was also interviewed for the book (as well as his former bandmate in Pantera, Anselmo, among many others).

Brown&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Smoke on This…&quot;, was released on July 28, 2017, via Entertainment One.

In 2023, he played bass on the debut album of metal supergroup Elegant Weapons.

==Personal life==
Brown does not &quot;subscribe to any particular organized religion&quot;, though he says he believes in God and the Ten Commandments.

In August 2009, Brown was excluded from the Down tour due to acute pancreatitis. He then had his gallbladder and polyps on his pancreas removed. &quot;Rex has been through hell, man&quot;, said bandmate Pepper Keenan. &quot;He was cut from rib to rib and they cleaned him out, but he&#x27;s in top shape again. After twenty-five years on the road – drinking every day and whatnot … well, the old days are over, my friend.&quot;

Brown married his longtime girlfriend Elena Henrard in June 2023.

==Playing style==
Brown was a jazz bassist and was offered a scholarship by the University of North Texas, but declined. He often plays with a pick.

Brown was notable for often contributing walking basslines underneath Dimebag Darrell&#x27;s guitar solos. Standout tracks include &quot;Floods&quot;, &quot;Walk&quot;, &quot;5 Minutes Alone&quot;, &quot;Throes of Rejection&quot;, &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, &quot;Living Through Me (Hells&#x27; Wrath)&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Hide&quot;, &quot;Use My Third Arm&quot;, &quot;Where You Come From&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Broken&quot;, among others.

==Endorsements==
Brown endorsed Spector bass guitars, and in 2011, a custom RXT prototype was made by Stuart Spector directly for Brown. In 2019, Brown offered this bass for sale on Reverb.com along with 70 other pieces of studio and stage gear he had used.

Gibson introduced a Rex Brown Signature bass model in July 2022, based on the Gibson Thunderbird, but with a more slender neck, and an extender for drop D tuning.

<doc id="1199748" wikidata="Q2147481" url="?curid=1199748" title="Ferrari 166 S">
<text>:&quot;See also the 166 Inter GT car&quot;
:&quot;See also the 166 MM Berlinetta Le Mans&quot;
:&quot;See also the Ferrari-Abarth 166 MM/53&quot;

The Ferrari 166 S was a sports car built by Ferrari between 1948 and 1953, as a evolution of its &quot;Colombo&quot; V12-powered 125 S racer. It was adapted into a sports car for the street in the form of the 166 Inter. 

Only 12 Ferrari 166 S were produced, nine of them with cycle-fenders as the Spyder Corsa. It was soon followed by the updated and highly successful Ferrari 166 MM (Mille Miglia), of which 47 were made from 1948 to 1953. Its early victories in the Targa Florio and Mille Miglia and others in international competition made the manufacturer a serious competitor in the racing industry. Both were later replaced by the 2.3 L 195 S.

==Design==
The 166 shared its Aurelio Lampredi-designed tube frame and double wishbone/live axle suspension with the 125. Like the 125, the wheelbase was 2420 mm long. Nine 166 Spyder Corsas and three 166 Sports were built. The first two 166 S models were coachbuilt by Carrozzeria Allemano and the last one by Carlo Anderloni at Carrozzeria Touring. Majority of the 166 MM cars were bodied at Touring in a barchetta form.

The 1.5 L Gioacchino Colombo-designed V12 engine of the 125 was changed, however, with single overhead camshafts specified and a larger 2.0 L (1995 cc/121 in³) displacement. This was achieved with both a bore and stroke increase, to 60 by 58.8 mm respectively. Output was at 5,600 rpm to at 6,500 rpm with three carburetors, giving top speed of . For the 166 MM power output rose to at 6,600 rpm and top speed to .

&quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; named the 166 MM Barchetta as number six in their list of the ten &quot;Greatest Ferraris of all time&quot;.

==Racing==
The Ferrari 166 S won Targa Florio with Clemente Biondetti and Igor Troubetzkoy in 1948. In 1949, Biondetti also won in the 166 SC with Benedetti as co-driver. The 166 S won 1948 Mille Miglia, also driven by Biondetti, this time with Giuseppe Navone. In 1949 Mille Miglia, the Ferrari 166 MM Barchettas scored 1-2 victory with Biondetti/Salani and Bonetto/Carpani respectively. In 1949, the 166 MM also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the hands of Luigi Chinetti and Lord Selsdon, and so the 
166 was the only car ever to win all three races. Another 166 won the 1949 Spa 24 Hours.

A 166 chassis, this time with the bigger 195 S engine, won the Mille Miglia again in 1950 with drivers Giannino Marzotto and Marco Crosara.

==Surviving examples==
The oldest Ferrari car with an undisputed pedigree is s/n 002C, a 166 Spider Corsa which was originally a 159 and is currently owned and driven by James Glickenhaus. S/n 0052M, a 1950 166 MM Touring Barchetta was uncovered in a barn and was shown in public for the first time since 1959 in the August 2006 issue of Cavallino magazine. One 166 MM, 1949 s/n 0018M, was bodied by Zagato in &#x27;Panoramica&#x27; style, very similar to their one-off Maserati A6 1500, also designed by Vieri Rapi. It is considered as first Ferrari coachbuilt by Zagato. A year later it was rebodied as Zagato Spyder. The original car was recreated in 2007 as part of Zagato&#x27;s Sanction Lost programme.

<text>The term Mai-Mai or Mayi-Mayi refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that is formed to defend local communities and territory against other armed groups. Most were formed to resist the invasion of Rwandan forces and Rwanda. 
Groups that fall under the umbrella term &quot;Mai-Mai&quot; include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads and politically motivated resistance fighters. Because Mai Mai have only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai refers not to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups.

The name comes from the Swahili word for water, &quot;&quot;. Militia members sprinkle themselves with water to protect themselves from bullets.

Mai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, North Kivu and South Kivu (the &quot;Kivus&quot;), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied Banyamulenge-dominated rebel faction, the Congolese Rally for Democracy–Goma (RCD-Goma) during the Second Congo War. While militias have long been common in the Kivus, particularly among the minority Batembo and Babembe ethnic groups, the recent wars and conflicts caused large numbers of town dwellers to form Mai-Mai. Although the Mai-Mai, either as a group or as individual groups, were not party to the 1999 Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which was meant to end the Second Congo War, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the conflict, and the lack of co-operation from some groups has been problematic for the peace process.

==Mai-Mai in North and South Kivu==
According to a 2001 UN report, 20,000 to 30,000 Mai-Mai were active in the two Kivu provinces. The two most powerful and well-organized Mai-Mai groups in the Kivus were led by Generals Padiri and Dunia. Currently most active is a group which is called Mai-Mai Yakutumba, was organized in 2007 by General Yakutumba. They were reported to have received aid from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and are widely viewed by other Mai Mai groups as the leaders, though not the commanders, of the Kivu Mai-Mai. A number of smaller Mai-Mai groups, such as the Mudundu 40/Front de Résistance et de Défense du Kivu (FRDKI) and Mouvement de Lutte contre l&#x27;Agression au Zaïre/Forces Unies de Résistance Nationale contre l&#x27;Agression de la Républíque Démocratique du Congo (MLAZ/FURNAC), were reported to cooperate with the Rwandan military and Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma (RCD-Goma).

Walikale and Masisi north of Goma were the centres of Mai-Mai activity in North Kivu. In South Kivu, there have historically been concentrations around Walungu and Bunyakiri south of Lake Kivu, around Uvira and Mwenaga at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, further south around Fizi, and around Shabunda, between the Rwandan border and Kindu.

==Mai-Mai in Katanga==

A former leader of the Mai-Mai, Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga, turned himself over to MONUC troops in May 2006. He was found guilty of numerous war crimes between October 2003 and May 2006 and was sentenced to death by the Kipushi Military Tribunal in Katanga Province on 6 March 2009. He escaped from prison in September 2011 and formed the Mai-Mai Kata Katanga (&quot;Secede Katanga&quot;).

==Other Mai-Mai groups==
There was a large Mai-Mai presence in Maniema, in particular around Kindu and Kalemie. Province Orientale also hosts a number of Mai-Mai, but these groups were apparently involved in long-standing ethnic disputes.

&quot;Mai-Mai Gedeon&quot; is also commanded by Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga and loosely tied to his Mai-Mai Kata Katanga. The &quot;Corak Kata Katanga&quot; also known as the Co-ordination for a Referendum on Self-determination for Katanga, composed mainly of former Katanga Tigers, a separatist group active in the 1960s. They claim to be behind the attack on the Katanga airport in February 2011. It is unclear to what extent all these groups are co-ordinated.

The Nduma Defense of Congo (or Mai-Mai Sheka) was formed in 2009 by former minerals trader Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka, an ethnic Nyanga. Sheka claims the group was formed to liberate the mines of Walikale Territory in North Kivu. The NDC are accused of a mass rape of at least 387 women, men, and children over a three-day span in Walikale in 2010.

==Mai-Mai in Virunga National Park==
In May 2007, Mai-Mai killed two wildlife officers in Virunga National Park and threatened to kill mountain gorillas if the government retaliated. The Mai-Mai are also suspected of the killings of nine mountain gorillas, with the use of machetes, and automatic weapons. In an October 2012 incident, Mai-Mai killed two park staff and a soldier, while three soldiers were injured. From 1990 to 2018 some 170 Virunga Rangers have died in such attacks, according to the World Wildlife Foundation.

Six Virunga Park Rangers were killed in an ambush and a seventh ranger was injured in the Central section of the reserve on 10 January 2021. Officials suspected the Mai-Mai to be behind the attacks.

In June 2023, seven Virunga Park Rangers were killed by local Mai-Mai in the span of ten days.

<text>Spathoglottis, commonly known as purple orchids or 苞舌兰属 (bao she lan shu) is a genus of about fifty species of orchids in the family Orchidaceae. They are evergreen terrestrial herbs with crowded pseudobulbs, a small number of leaves and medium-sized resupinate flowers on an upright flowering stem. The sepals and petals are all similar to each other and are white, yellow, pink or purple. Species of &quot;Spathoglottis&quot; are found from eastern and south-eastern Asia to Australia and some Pacific Islands.

==Description==
Orchids in the genus &quot;Spathoglottis&quot; are evergreen, terrestrial herbs with crowded pseudobulbs just below the surface of the soil and a few large, leaves. The flowering stem emerges from a pseudoblulb and bears medium-sized, colourful flowers. The flowers open widely with the sepals and petals all similar in size to each other, although with the petals usually broader, the sepals are hairy on the outside. The labellum has three lobes, the side lobes more or less upright and the middle lobe with a claw near its base.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus &quot;Spathoglottis&quot; was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume who published the description in &quot;Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indië&quot;, and the first species he described (the type species) was &quot;S. plicata&quot;. The genus name &quot;Spathoglottis&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;spathe&quot;, , and &quot;glotta&quot;, tongue, a probable reference to the broad labellum midlobe&quot;.

<doc id="1199784" wikidata="Q7510911" url="?curid=1199784" title="Siemens Nexas">
<text>The Siemens Nexas is a class of electric multiple units manufactured by Siemens Transportation Systems for the suburban railway network of Melbourne, Australia between 2002 and 2005. The design of the trains was based on the Siemens Modular Metro.

== History ==
In March 2000, M&gt;Train ordered 62 Siemens Nexas trains to fulfill a franchise commitment to replace its fleet of Hitachi trains.

The original order was for 62 3-car sets, with an option for an additional ten 3-car sets. In December 2002 just before the first was delivered, National Express handed the M&gt;Train franchise back to the Government of Victoria, thus the first Siemens Nexas trains were delivered to the government. All passed to Connex Melbourne in April 2004. The option for ten additional trains was exercised in August 2005, with the last of these delivered in January 2006.

Siemens Rail Services was contracted to provide maintenance of the trains for a period of 15 years (subject to refranchising) at Newport Workshops. With the refranchising of the network to Metro Trains Melbourne in 2009, this maintenance arrangement was retained for an initial three-year period.

They first entered service on 3 April 2003 with the last delivered in January 2006.

== Braking problems ==
In late 2006, the trains suffered a number of braking problems while in service. 14 trains overshot platforms in the space of three days. The units involved in the overshoots were withdrawn from service for checks, and instructions were issued to drivers to minimise further occurrences. By mid-January 2007, a total of 24 three-carriage trains had been impounded for testing, following 20 further incidents of over-running stations since 22 December 2006.

On 13 January 2007, Connex stopped running the Siemens Nexas trains as 3-car sets until the braking problem was resolved, with the result that all services (including at evenings and weekends) were operated by 6-car trains. On 29 January 2007, Connex cancelled 37 peak-period services until further notice, due to the shortage of operational trains.

By 1 February 2007, 38 three-car sets had been withdrawn due to continuing braking failures, meaning that more than half of the Siemens Nexas fleet (about 10% of the total fleet) was out of revenue service. Amidst the media reporting an escalating problem with the risk of the entire fleet potentially having to be suspended, Siemens issued a statement on 31 January 2008 saying that they believed there had been no evidence during investigations that would require the entire fleet of trains being withdrawn from service. In an effort to replicate the brake fault, testing of affected trains was carried out on the Werribee line between Newport and Laverton, with soapy water sprayed onto the rails to increase the amount of wheel slip experienced. The entire fleet was eventually returned to service, although they were not to be run as single (3 car) units.

In December 2008, train operator Connex commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court to claim damages from Siemens. Connex claimed Siemens provided trains with a braking system that was &quot;defective, faulty and inadequate&quot;, the trains being &quot;not fit for their purpose&quot; and were not of &quot;merchantable quality&quot;.

In March 2009, it was reported that three Siemens Nexas trains had been impounded due to new braking incidents in the week prior.

By December 2010, sanding equipment had been trialled on set 773M-2537T-774M in order to improve the braking performance of the trains, and, by February 2011, a number of trains had also been fitted with the equipment. The sand boxes were fitted to the middle two bogies of each 3-car set.

In June 2011, installation of sanding equipment was completed across the entire fleet, and speed restrictions on all Siemens Nexas trains were lifted.

In September 2011, the Office of the Chief Investigator, Transport Safety, found that &quot;the relatively high frequency of overruns involving Nexas trains was neither the result of individual train defects nor any deficiency in train maintenance&quot;.

== Design and construction ==
The bodies of the Siemens Modular Metro trains evolved from the 1993 DT2 Series used in the Nuremberg U-Bahn whose design in turn came from production of the A Series built for the nearby Munich U-Bahn.

The version of Siemens metro train designed for Melbourne included several attributes similar to existing Melbourne suburban electric trains such as being single-deck and operating in M-T-M (motor-trailer-motor) sets of three carriages, where the motor cars each have an overhead pantograph, and two of these 3-car sets are generally coupled together to form a 6-carriage train when run in revenue service, though a single set may be run when demand does not merit a full train.

All were built by Siemens Transportation Systems, Vienna, with the final fitout completed at Newport Workshops.

There are several notable differences between the Siemens Nexas trains and other trains which operate in Melbourne. These include:
* 2+2 seating. All other trains had 2+3 seating, however X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trains ordered as part of the 2008 Victorian Government Transport Plans have the same 2+2 seating configuration, and existing X&#x27;Trapolis trains had their seats modified to a 2+2 configuration as part of the franchise agreement.
* Two doors per carriage per side. Being significantly wider they were theorised to be slightly more efficient in loading and unloading passengers, although this is disputed by some sources, who believe the fewer doors lead to longer platform dwell times compared to the three smaller doors in other Melbourne trains.
* Plug-type doors – hinged outward and slide along the outside of the vehicle when opening.
* Extreme smooth, vertical walls.
* Open articulation. Passengers can freely move from carriage to carriage, within a 3-carriage set, without opening doors, the first such train with this configuration in Melbourne.

The Siemens Nexas trains are fitted with a Passenger information system produced by the German firm Annax. The system does not announce service details at the commencement of a journey, express running or the end of services.

In June 2008, Connex started a program to replace the seat coverings in a number of Siemens Nexas trains, using the same type of fabric as used in the X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trains, Metro Trains Melbourne has since put in new seating fabric displaying various stations around the network, to almost half the fleet.

== Refurbishment ==
In 2016, Metro Trains Melbourne began refurbishing the interior carriages of Siemens Nexas trains. All windguards and glass screens were removed from the doorways and replaced with a smaller vertical
handrail (except where wheelchair access is required), a number of seats removed near the doors and extra vertical and horizontal handrails fitted to improve comfort and capacity. A cleaning program occurred at the same time, which included fitting new seat pads and covers, re-painting walls and applying anti-graffiti film to the windows. As of August 2017, the entire fleet had been refurbished. 
A similar refurbishment has been completed on the older Comeng trains.
In 2019, Metro Trains Melbourne began to replace the Gangway systems. The new Hübner System has at the floor an articulated bridge system instead of the plate system. Also the sound insulation and the behavior of the bellows system has been improved.

In August 2022, Metro Trains Melbourne completed a mid-life refurbishment on two 3-car sets in the fleet, thus comprising one full six-car set (747M-2524T-748M and 809M-2555T-810M). The two coupled sets were first documented running on 22 August 2022.
The refurbishment included an updated passenger information system; overhauling the display and the station announcements.
Other improvements include updated CCTV, improved lighting, PA upgrades and a brand new interface for emergency driver communication.

In early 2024, the Siemens Nexas fleet began to receive a refurbished interior, with the old blue seat fabric replaced with the current PTV design. It also includes an improved emergency intercom system, a wheelchair assistance button, and additional grab poles. In a separate project, they had new dynamic information displays added, similar to the Stage 3 Comeng, showing the next few stops and the line colour.
== Liveries ==
The Siemens Nexas trains have a stainless steel body, and were seen in a number of different liveries in their early years, owing to the changes in ownership that have occurred while the trains were entering service.

The trains were originally delivered with M&gt;Train blue and green stripes on the side, and the M&gt;Train &#x27;swirl&#x27; on the front fairing. Later deliveries entering service in bare metal on the sides, and white front fairings with a green and yellow striped bar. On entering Connex Melbourne ownership, blue and yellow stripes were progressively added to the side of all trains, and front fairings were repainted yellow with the blue Connex logo.

After Metro Trains Melbourne took over the operation of the suburban network in November 2009, the Connex logo on all trains was covered over as a temporary measure, with all sets progressively being repainted into Metro livery, a process completed in March 2010.

In December 2022, Siemens Nexas train 741M-2521T-742M first received the PTV/2022 livery on Siemens Nexas Fleet, featuring removal of company branding, and yellow door outlines (now matching the new HCMT fleet). From early 2024, the rest of the Siemens Nexas Fleet began to receive the new livery.

<text>The New Jersey General Assembly is the lower house of the New Jersey Legislature.

Since the election of 1967 (1968 session), the Assembly has consisted of 80 members. Two members are elected from each of New Jersey&#x27;s 40 legislative districts for a term of two years, each representing districts with average populations of 232,225 (2020 figures), with deviation in each district not exceeding 3.21% above and below that average. To be eligible to run, a potential candidate must be at least 21 years of age, and must have lived in their district for at least one year prior to the election, and have lived in the state of New Jersey for two years. They also must be residents of their districts. Membership in the Assembly is considered a part-time job, and many members have employment in addition to their legislative work. Assembly members serve two-year terms, elected every odd-numbered year in November. One current member of the Assembly, Gary Schaer, holds another elective office (Passaic City Council President), as he is grandfathered in under a New Jersey law that banned multiple office holding in 2007.

The Assembly is led by the Speaker of the Assembly, who is elected by the membership of the chamber. After the Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey and the President of the New Jersey Senate, the Speaker of the Assembly is third in the line of succession to replace the Governor of New Jersey in the event that the governor is unable to execute the duties of that office. The Speaker decides the schedule for the Assembly, which bills will be considered, appoints committee chairmen, and generally runs the Assembly&#x27;s agenda. The current Speaker is Craig Coughlin (D-Woodbridge).

===Salary and costs===
Members of the NJ General Assembly receive an annual base salary of $49,000 with the Senate President and the Assembly Speaker earning slightly more. Members receive $110,000 for staff salaries. In addition, they receive 12,500 postage stamps, stationery and a telephone card. They receive New Jersey State health insurance and other benefits. The total cost to the State of New Jersey for each member of the general assembly is approximately $200,000 annually.

=== &quot;Double dipping&quot; ===
Under state law that remained in effect until 2008, New Jersey Assembly, as well as Senate, members were allowed to serve in both one chamber or the other, as well as any other government positions they might have held at the time, although those who were still doing so as of 2008 ended up getting &quot;grandfathered&quot;:

<text>A penetration test, colloquially known as a pentest, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system; this is not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment. The test is performed to identify weaknesses (or vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system&#x27;s features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

The process typically identifies the target systems and a particular goal, then reviews available information and undertakes various means to attain that goal. A penetration test target may be a white box (about which background and system information are provided in advance to the tester) or a black box (about which only basic information other than the company name is provided). A gray box penetration test is a combination of the two (where limited knowledge of the target is shared with the auditor). A penetration test can help identify a system&#x27;s vulnerabilities to attack and estimate how vulnerable it is.

Security issues that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to the system owner. Penetration test reports may also assess potential impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce the risk.

The UK National Cyber Security Center describes penetration testing as: &quot;A method for gaining assurance in the security of an IT system by attempting to breach some or all of that system&#x27;s security, using the same tools and techniques as an adversary might.&quot;

The goals of a penetration test vary depending on the type of approved activity for any given engagement, with the primary goal focused on finding vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a nefarious actor, and informing the client of those vulnerabilities along with recommended mitigation strategies.

Penetration tests are a component of a full security audit. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requires penetration testing on a regular schedule, and after system changes. Penetration testing also can support risk assessments as outlined in the NIST Risk Management Framework SP 800-53.

Several standard frameworks and methodologies exist for conducting penetration tests. These include the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES), the NIST Special Publication 800-115, the Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) and the OWASP Testing Guide. CREST, a not for profit professional body for the technical cyber security industry, provides its CREST Defensible Penetration Test standard that provides the industry with guidance for commercially reasonable assurance activity when carrying out penetration tests.

Flaw hypothesis methodology is a systems analysis and penetration prediction technique where a list of hypothesized s in a software system are compiled through analysis of the specifications and documentation for the system. The list of hypothesized flaws is then prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw actually exists, and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of control or compromise. The prioritized list is used to direct the actual testing of the system.

There are different types of penetration testing, depending upon the goal of the organization which include: Network (external and internal), Wireless, Web Application, Social Engineering, and Remediation Verification.

Even more recently a common pen testing tool called a flipper was used to hack the MGM casinos in 2023 by a group called Scattered Spiders showing the versatility and power of some of the tools of the trade.

== History ==

By the mid 1960s, growing popularity of time-sharing computer systems that made resources accessible over communication lines created new security concerns. As the scholars Deborah Russell and G. T. Gangemi Sr. explain, &quot;The 1960s marked the true beginning of the age of computer security.&quot;

In June 1965, for example, several of the U.S.&#x27;s leading computer security experts held one of the first major conferences on system security—hosted by the government contractor, the System Development Corporation (SDC). During the conference, someone noted that one SDC employee had been able to easily undermine various system safeguards added to SDC&#x27;s AN/FSQ-32 time-sharing computer system. In hopes that further system security study would be useful, attendees requested &quot;...studies to be conducted in such areas as breaking security protection in the time-shared system.&quot; In other words, the conference participants initiated one of the first formal requests to use computer penetration as a tool for studying system security.

At the Spring 1968 Joint Computer Conference, many leading computer specialists again met to discuss system security concerns. During this conference, the computer security experts Willis Ware, Harold Petersen, and Rein Turn, all of the RAND Corporation, and Bernard Peters of the National Security Agency (NSA), all used the phrase &quot;penetration&quot; to describe an attack against a computer system. In a paper, Ware referred to the military&#x27;s remotely accessible time-sharing systems, warning that &quot;Deliberate attempts to penetrate such computer systems must be anticipated.&quot; His colleagues Petersen and Turn shared the same concerns, observing that online communication systems &quot;...are vulnerable to threats to privacy,&quot; including &quot;deliberate penetration.&quot; Bernard Peters of the NSA made the same point, insisting that computer input and output &quot;...could provide large amounts of information to a penetrating program.&quot; During the conference, computer penetration would become formally identified as a major threat to online computer systems.

The threat that computer penetration posed was next outlined in a major report organized by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) in late 1967. Essentially, DoD officials turned to Willis Ware to lead a task force of experts from NSA, CIA, DoD, academia, and industry to formally assess the security of time-sharing computer systems. By relying on many papers presented during the Spring 1967 Joint Computer Conference, the task force largely confirmed the threat to system security that computer penetration posed. Ware&#x27;s report was initially classified, but many of the country&#x27;s leading computer experts quickly identified the study as the definitive document on computer security. Jeffrey R. Yost of the Charles Babbage Institute has more recently described the Ware report as &quot;...by far the most important and thorough study on technical and operational issues regarding secure computing systems of its time period.&quot; In effect, the Ware report reaffirmed the major threat posed by computer penetration to the new online time-sharing computer systems.

To better understand system weaknesses, the federal government and its contractors soon began organizing teams of penetrators, known as &quot;tiger teams,&quot; to use computer penetration to test system security. Deborah Russell and G. T. Gangemi Sr. stated that during the 1970s &quot;...&#x27;tiger teams&#x27; first emerged on the computer scene. Tiger teams were government and industry-sponsored teams of crackers who attempted to break down the defenses of computer systems in an effort to uncover, and eventually patch, security holes.&quot;

A leading scholar on the history of computer security, Donald MacKenzie, similarly points out that, &quot;RAND had done some penetration studies (experiments in circumventing computer security controls) of early time-sharing systems on behalf of the government.&quot; Jeffrey R. Yost of the Charles Babbage Institute, in his own work on the history of computer security, also acknowledges that both the RAND Corporation and the SDC had &quot;engaged in some of the first so-called &#x27;penetration studies&#x27; to try to infiltrate time-sharing systems in order to test their vulnerability.&quot; In virtually all these early studies, tiger teams successfully broke into all targeted computer systems, as the country&#x27;s time-sharing systems had poor defenses.

Of early tiger team actions, efforts at the RAND Corporation demonstrated the usefulness of penetration as a tool for assessing system security. At the time, one RAND analyst noted that the tests had &quot;...demonstrated the practicality of system-penetration as a tool for evaluating the effectiveness and adequacy of implemented data security safeguards.&quot; In addition, a number of the RAND analysts insisted that the penetration test exercises all offered several benefits that justified its continued use. As they noted in one paper, &quot;A penetrator seems to develop a diabolical frame of mind in his search for operating system weaknesses and incompleteness, which is difficult to emulate.&quot; For these reasons and others, many analysts at RAND recommended the continued study of penetration techniques for their usefulness in assessing system security.

Presumably the leading computer penetration expert during these formative years was James P. Anderson, who had worked with the NSA, RAND, and other government agencies to study system security. In the early 1971, the U.S. Air Force contracted Anderson&#x27;s private company to study the security of its time-sharing system at the Pentagon. In his study, Anderson outlined a number of major factors involved in computer penetration. Anderson described a general attack sequence in steps:

# Find an exploitable vulnerability.
# Design an attack around it.
# Test the attack.
# Seize a line in use.
# Enter the attack.
# Exploit the entry for information recovery.

Over time, Anderson&#x27;s description of general computer penetration steps helped guide many other security experts, who relied on this technique to assess time-sharing computer system security.

In the following years, computer penetration as a tool for security assessment became more refined and sophisticated. In the early 1980s, the journalist William Broad briefly summarized the ongoing efforts of tiger teams to assess system security. As Broad reported, the DoD-sponsored report by Willis Ware had &quot;...showed how spies could actively penetrate computers, steal or copy electronic files and subvert the devices that normally guard top-secret information. The study touched off more than a decade of quiet activity by elite groups of computer scientists working for the Government who tried to break into sensitive computers. They succeeded in every attempt.&quot;

While these various studies may have suggested that computer security in the U.S. remained a major problem, the scholar Edward Hunt has more recently made a broader point about the extensive study of computer penetration as a security tool. Hunt suggests in a recent paper on the history of penetration testing that the defense establishment ultimately &quot;...created many of the tools used in modern day cyberwarfare,&quot; as it carefully defined and researched the many ways that computer penetrators could hack into targeted systems.

== Tools ==

A wide variety of security assessment tools are available to assist with penetration testing, including free-of-charge, free software, and commercial software.

=== Specialized OS distributions ===

Several operating system distributions are geared towards penetration testing. Such distributions typically contain a pre-packaged and pre-configured set of tools. The penetration tester does not have to hunt down each individual tool, which might increase the risk of complications—such as compile errors, dependency issues, and configuration errors. Also, acquiring additional tools may not be practical in the tester&#x27;s context.

Notable penetration testing OS examples include:

* BlackArch based on Arch Linux
* BackBox based on Ubuntu
* Kali Linux (replaced BackTrack December 2012) based on Debian
* Parrot Security OS based on Debian
* Pentoo based on Gentoo
* WHAX based on Slackware
* Nmap Network Mapper
* Wireshark Web vulnerability scanner
* John The Ripper password cracking tool

Many other specialized operating systems facilitate penetration testing—each more or less dedicated to a specific field of penetration testing.

A number of Linux distributions include known OS and application vulnerabilities, and can be deployed as &quot;targets&quot; to practice against. Such systems help new security professionals try the latest security tools in a lab environment. Examples include Damn Vulnerable Linux (DVL), the OWASP Web Testing Environment (WTW), and Metasploitable.

=== Software frameworks ===

* BackBox
* Hping
* Metasploit Project
* Nessus
* Nmap
* OWASP ZAP
* SAINT
* w3af
* Burp Suite
* Wireshark
* John the Ripper
* Hashcat

=== Hardware tools ===
There are hardware tools specifically designed for penetration testing. However, not all hardware tools used in penetration testing are purpose-built for this task. Some devices, such as measuring and debugging equipment, are repurposed for penetration testing due to their advanced functionality and versatile capabilities.

* Proxmark3 — multi-purpose hardware tool for radio-frequency identification (RFID) security analysis.

* BadUSB — toolset for exploiting vulnerabilities in USB devices to inject malicious keystrokes or payloads.
* Flipper Zero — portable, open-source multi-functional device pentesting wireless protocols such as Sub-GHz, RFID, NFC, Infrared and Bluetooth.
* Raspberry Pi — a compact, versatile single-board computer commonly used in penetration testing for tasks like network reconnaissance and exploitation.
* SDR (Software-defined Radio)— versatile tool for analyzing and attacking radio communications and protocols, including intercepting, emulating, decoding, and transmitting signals.
* ChipWhisperer — specialized hardware tool for side-channel attacks, allowing analysis of cryptographic implementations and vulnerabilities through power consumption or electromagnetic emissions.

== Penetration testing phases ==

The process of penetration testing may be simplified into the following five phases:

# Reconnaissance: The act of gathering important information on a target system. This information can be used to better attack the target. For example, open source search engines can be used to find data that can be used in a social engineering attack.
# Scanning: Uses technical tools to further the attacker&#x27;s knowledge of the system. For example, Nmap can be used to scan for open ports.
# Gaining access: Using the data gathered in the reconnaissance and scanning phases, the attacker can use a payload to exploit the targeted system. For example, Metasploit can be used to automate attacks on known vulnerabilities.
# Maintaining access: Maintaining access requires taking the steps involved in being able to be persistently within the target environment in order to gather as much data as possible.
# Covering tracks: The attacker must clear any trace of compromising the victim system, any type of data gathered, log events, in order to remain anonymous.

Once an attacker has exploited one vulnerability they may gain access to other machines so the process repeats i.e. they look for new vulnerabilities and attempt to exploit them. This process is referred to as pivoting.

=== Vulnerabilities ===

Legal operations that let the tester execute an illegal operation include unescaped SQL commands, unchanged hashed passwords in source-visible projects, human relationships, and old hashing or cryptographic functions. A single flaw may not be enough to enable a critically serious exploit. Leveraging multiple known flaws and shaping the payload in a way that appears as a valid operation is almost always required. Metasploit provides a ruby library for common tasks, and maintains a database of known exploits.

When working under budget and time constraints, fuzzing is a common technique that discovers vulnerabilities. It aims to get an unhandled error through random input. The tester uses random input to access the less often used code paths. Well-trodden code paths are usually free of errors. Errors are useful because they either expose more information, such as HTTP server crashes with full info trace-backs—or are directly usable, such as buffer overflows.

Imagine a website has 100 text input boxes. A few are vulnerable to SQL injections on certain strings. Submitting random strings to those boxes for a while will hopefully hit the bugged code path. The error shows itself as a broken HTML page half rendered because of an SQL error. In this case, only text boxes are treated as input streams. However, software systems have many possible input streams, such as cookie and session data, the uploaded file stream, RPC channels, or memory. Errors can happen in any of these input streams. The test goal is to first get an unhandled error and then understand the flaw based on the failed test case. Testers write an automated tool to test their understanding of the flaw until it is correct. After that, it may become obvious how to package the payload so that the target system triggers its execution. If this is not viable, one can hope that another error produced by the fuzzer yields more fruit. The use of a fuzzer saves time by not checking adequate code paths where exploits are unlikely.

=== Payload ===

The illegal operation, or payload in Metasploit terminology, can include functions for logging keystrokes, taking screenshots, installing adware, stealing credentials, creating backdoors using shellcode, or altering data. Some companies maintain large databases of known exploits and provide products that automatically test target systems for vulnerabilities:

* Metasploit
* Nessus
* Nmap
* OpenVAS
* W3af

== Standardized government penetration test services ==

The General Services Administration (GSA) has standardized the &quot;penetration test&quot; service as a pre-vetted support service, to rapidly address potential vulnerabilities, and stop adversaries before they impact US federal, state and local governments. These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS) and are listed at the US GSA Advantage website.

This effort has identified key service providers which have been technically reviewed and vetted to provide these advanced penetration services. This GSA service is intended to improve the rapid ordering and deployment of these services, reduce US government contract duplication, and to protect and support the US infrastructure in a more timely and efficient manner.

132-45A Penetration Testing is security testing in which service assessors mimic real-world attacks to identify methods for circumventing the security features of an application, system, or network. HACS Penetration Testing Services typically strategically test the effectiveness of the organization&#x27;s preventive and detective security measures employed to protect assets and data. As part of this service, certified ethical hackers typically conduct a simulated attack on a system, systems, applications or another target in the environment, searching for security weaknesses. After testing, they will typically document the vulnerabilities and outline which defenses are effective and which can be defeated or exploited.

In the UK penetration testing services are standardized via professional bodies working in collaboration with National Cyber Security Centre.

The outcomes of penetration tests vary depending on the standards and methodologies used. There are five penetration testing standards: Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST00), Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF), and Penetration Testing Methodologies and Standards (PTES).

<doc id="1199799" wikidata="Q6844813" url="?curid=1199799" title="Miguel Street">
<text>Miguel Street is a collection of linked short stories by V. S. Naipaul set in wartime Trinidad and Tobago. The stories draw on the author&#x27;s childhood memories of Port of Spain. The author lived with his family in the Woodbrook district of the city in the 1940s, and the street in question, Luis Street, has been taken to be the model of Miguel Street. Some of the inhabitants are members of the Hindu community to which Naipaul belonged. Naipaul also draws on wider Trinidadian culture, referring to cricket and quoting a number of lyrics by black calypso singers.

==Plot summary==

The stories tend each to focus on a single character living on Miguel Street. As the various characters reappear in different stories, which all share the same boy narrator, the book can be seen as a type of novel. 

Rather like the characters of &quot;Dubliners&quot;, some of Naipaul&#x27;s protagonists appear to be affected by a kind of paralysis, for example Mr. Popo the carpenter, who never finishes making anything, and the poet B. Wordsworth, who is working on the greatest poem ever written but has never written past the first line. The narrator however escapes from Miguel Street at the end of the book.
Other characters include Bogart (named after Humphrey Bogart), Hat, George, Elias, an assiduous boy, Man-man, Eddoes, a junk king, Mrs. Hereira, Uncle Bhakcu, Bolo, and Edward.

== Background to the book&#x27;s publication ==
Naipaul wrote the book while employed at the BBC in London.

The publisher André Deutsch hesitated over publishing short stories by an unknown Trinidadian writer, as Naipaul then was. Deutsch thought a novel would have more success, and encouraged Naipaul to write one. Deutsch published &quot;Miguel Street&quot; after Naipaul&#x27;s first two novels, &quot;The Mystic Masseur&quot; and &quot;The Suffrage of Elvira&quot;, which appeared in 1957 and 1958 respectively.

== Reception ==
&quot;Miguel Street&quot; won the 1961 Somerset Maugham Award.
The &quot;New York Times&quot; said about &quot;Miguel Street,&quot; &quot;The sketches are written lightly, so that tragedy is understated and comedy is overstated, yet the ring of truth always prevails.&quot;

== See also ==
Naipaul returned to linked short stories with &quot;In a Free State&quot;.

<doc id="1199800" wikidata="Q117899" url="?curid=1199800" title="Valentina Cervi">
<text>Valentina Cervi (born 13 April 1976) is an Italian film and television actress.

Cervi was born in Rome. She is the daughter of director Tonino Cervi and granddaughter of actor Gino Cervi. Her mother is the Italian producer of Austrian-Hungarian origin Marina Gefter. Cervi started her acting career at age ten in Carlo Cotti&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Portami la luna&quot;. She also played an English-language role in Jane Campion&#x27;s 1996 &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;.

One of her most acclaimed roles was the lead in the 1997 film &quot;Artemisia&quot;, directed by Agnès Merlet. It was loosely based on the painter Artemisia Gentileschi&#x27;s life, but controversially portrayed the relationship between Agostino Tassi (played by Miki Manojlović) and Artemisia as a passionate affair rather than as rape.

In 2011, she appeared as Arianna in BBC TV&#x27;s Italian detective mini-series &quot;Zen&quot;. She also appeared as &quot;Valentina&quot; in Canale 5&#x27;s series &quot;Distretto di Polizia&quot; in 2011.

Cervi appeared as Bertha Mason in Cary Fukunaga&#x27;s 2011 film adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. She was cast as the ancient vampire Salome in the HBO television drama &quot;True Blood&quot;.

She is married to director Stefano Mordini and has two children, Margherita (born 2013) and a son (born 2016).

She received the &quot;America Award&quot; of the Italy–USA Foundation in 2018.

<doc id="1199804" wikidata="Q1353522" url="?curid=1199804" title="Ferrari 250">
<text>The Ferrari 250 is a series of sports cars and grand tourers built by Ferrari from 1952 to 1964. The company&#x27;s most successful early line, the 250 series includes many variants designed for road use or sports car racing. 250 series cars are characterized by their use of a Colombo V12 engine designed by Gioacchino Colombo. The 250 series designation refers to this engine&#x27;s cylinder displacement of approximately 250 cc. They were replaced by the 275 and 330 series cars.

==Similarities==
Most 250 road cars share the same two wheelbases, for short wheelbase (SWB) and for long wheelbase (LWB). Most convertibles used the SWB type.

Nearly all 250s share the same Colombo &quot;Tipo 125&quot; V12 engine. At , it was notable for its light weight and impressive output of up to in the Testa Rossa and GTO. The V12 weighed hundreds of pounds less than its chief competitors — for example, it was nearly half the weight of the Jaguar XK straight-6. Ferrari uses the displacement of a single cylinder as the model designation.

The V12 propelled the Ferrari 250 racing cars to numerous victories.

==Racing models==
Typical of Ferrari, the Colombo V12 made its debut on the race track, with the racing 250s preceding the street cars by three years.

===250 S===
The first 250 was the experimental 250 S berlinetta prototype entered in the 1952 Mille Miglia for Giovanni Bracco and Alfonso Rolfo. The Mercedes-Benz W194 racers of Rudolf Caracciola, Hermann Lang, and Karl Kling were faster on the long straights but the Ferrari made up sufficient ground in the hills and curves to win the race. The car was later entered at Le Mans and in the Carrera Panamericana.

The 250 S used a wheelbase with a &quot;Tuboscocca&quot; tubular trellis frame. Suspension was by double wishbones at the front, with double longitudinal semi-elliptic springs locating the live axle at the rear. The car had the drum brakes and worm-and-sector steering typical of the period. The dry-sump 3.0 L () engine used three Weber 36DCF carburettors and was mated directly to a five-speed manual transmission.
===250 MM===

Following the success of the 250 S in the Mille Miglia, Ferrari showed a more conventional chassis for the new 250 engine at the 1952 Paris Motor Show. Pinin Farina then created coupé bodywork which had a small grille, compact tail and panoramic rear window, and the new car was launched as the 250 MM (for Mille Miglia) at the 1953 Geneva Motor Show. Carrozzeria Vignale&#x27;s open barchetta version was also an innovative design whose recessed headlights and side vents became a Ferrari staple for the 1950s. 0334MM was the sole chassis with Vignale Berlinetta body, distinctive for its triple portholes on the bottom of front fenders, not on top.

The 250 MM&#x27;s wheelbase was longer than the 250 S at , with the coupé heavier than the barchetta. The V12 engine&#x27;s dry sump was omitted from the production car, and the transmission was reduced by one gear. Power was increased to . The four-cylinder 625 TF and 735 S replaced the V12-powered 250 MM later in 1953.

The 250 MM&#x27;s race debut was at the 1953 Giro di Sicilia with privateer Paolo Marzotto. A Carrozzeria Morelli-bodied 250 MM barchetta driven by Clemente Biondetti came fourth in the 1954 Mille Miglia.

===250 Monza===
The 1954 250 Monza was an unusual hybrid of the light four-cylinder 500 Mondial and the 250 line. The model used the 250 MM engine in the short-wheelbase chassis from the 500 Mondial. The first three used the Pinin Farina barchetta shape of the 750 Monza and 500 Mondial. One more 250 Monza was built by Carrozzeria Scaglietti, an early use of the now-familiar coachbuilder. The 250 Monzas failed to gain much success and the union of the Monza chassis and 250 engine was not pursued for some time.

===250 Testa Rossa===

The racing 250 Testa Rossa was one of the most successful Ferrari racing cars in its history, with three wins at Le Mans, four wins at Sebring, and two wins at Buenos Aires. One example sold at auction for a (then) record-breaking $16.39 million.
===250 GTO===

The 250 GTO was produced from 1962 to 1964 for homologation into the FIA&#x27;s Group 3 Grand Touring Car category. GTO stands for &quot;Gran Turismo Omologato&quot;, Italian for &quot;Homologated Grand Tourer&quot;. When new, the GTO sold for $18,500 in the United States, and buyers had to be personally approved by Enzo Ferrari and his dealer for North America, Luigi Chinetti.

In May 2012, the 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO chassis number 3505GT sold by an auction for US$38,115,000.

In October 2013, the 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO chassis number 5111GT sold by Connecticut-based collector Paul Pappalardo to an unnamed buyer in a private transaction for US$52 million.

In August 2018, the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO chassis number 3413GT sold at auction for US$48,405,000.

Thirty-three cars were made in 1962 and 1963. In 1964 the Series II was introduced, which had a different body. Three such cars were made, and four older Series I cars were given a Series II body. It brought the total number of GTOs produced to 36.

In 2004, Sports Car International placed the 250 GTO eighth on a list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s, and nominated it the top sports car of all time. &quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; placed it first on a list of the &quot;Greatest Ferraris of all time&quot;.

===250 P===

The 250 P was a prototype racer produced in 1963, winning that year&#x27;s 12 Hours of Sebring, 1000 km Nürburgring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. 
The 250 P used an engine derived from the 250 Testa Rossa, mounted in a rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive configuration.

===250 LM===

The mid-engined 250 Le Mans looked very much the prototype racer but was intended for production as a road-going GT. Descended from the 250 P, the Le Mans also appeared in 1963 and sported Pininfarina bodywork. Ferrari was unable to persuade the FIA that he would build the 100 examples required to homologate the car for GT racing. Eventually, 32 LMs were built up to 1965. As a result, Ferrari withdrew from factory participation in the GT class of the 1965 World Sportscar Championship, allowing the Shelby Cobra team to dominate. A 250LM, competing in the Prototype category, won the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Only the very early LM&#x27;s were true 250 models. All the others were made as 3.3-litre models, and as such should have been named 275 LM. The early cars were converted to the 3.3-litre engine.

==GT cars==
The 250 design was successful both on the road and on the track. A number of GT models were built in varying states of road or racing trim.

===250 Europa===
The 250 Europa, introduced at the 1953 Paris Motor Show, was the only one of the family to use a different engine, sporting the 2963 cc &quot;Lampredi&quot; V12 based on a design for Formula One 3.3 L engine. It was a square engine, with of bore and stroke, developing at 6,300 rpm, with three Weber 36DCF (or DCZ) carburettors, and mated to a 4-speed transmission.
With the long wheelbase and Ferrari 375 America-style bodies, it was designed as a grand tourer. Three different rear axle ratios were offered to customers, providing an estimated top speed between depending on the ratio. Both 250 Europa and 375 America shared the same chassis, wheelbase and mechanicals apart for the engine. The majority of bodywork were designed by Pinin Farina. Some had bodies designed by Giovanni Michelotti and constructed by Vignale. Styling resembled the 375 America and 340 Mexico coupes. 22 were made, including 17 Pinin Farina-built coupes, 4 Vignale coupes, 1 Pinin Farina cabriolet and 1 Vignale cabriolet. Two were later converted by the Ferrari factory to 375 America specification (chassis 0315AL and 0353EU). 
===250 Europa GT===
The first road car to use Colombo&#x27;s 250 V12 was the 250 Europa GT, introduced at the 1954 Paris Motor Show. It was also the first Ferrari to use the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; moniker. Pinin Farina&#x27;s sober Paris coupé was just one of many shapes for the 250 GT model line, with coachbuilt production extending through 1956 before the 250 line became more standardized. The original 250 Europa GT used a wheelbase on a conventional chassis, with 600-16 Stella Bianca tyres. The wet sump V12 was tuned to , with three Weber 36DCZ3 carburettors. Echoing Vignale&#x27;s 250 Europa, Pinin Farina added now-familiar vents to the front fenders, a standard styling cue for many of the 250 GTs that followed.
Chassis Nr. 0373 finished third at the Liège-Rome-Liège rally in 1956
===250 GT Coupé Boano and Ellena===
Pinin Farina introduced a 250-based prototype coupé at the 1956 Geneva Motor Show which came to be called the 250 GT Boano. Intended as a styling exercise and inspiration to 250 GT Europa customers, the car generated demand that soon called for a production series.

Unable to meet the demand without expansion, Pinin Farina asked Mario Boano, formerly of Ghia, to handle the construction. When Fiat later recruited Boano, he handed production duties to his son-in-law Ezio Ellena. With partner Luciano Pollo, Carrozzeria Ellena would produce the 250 GT for another few years. Ellena revised the car, raising the roof and removing the vent windows from the doors. These examples became known as the 250 GT Ellena.

Carrozzeria Boano built 74 250 GTs on the long-wheelbase chassis. Carrozzeria Ellena built another 50 Coupés.

All but one were coupés. The single convertible, 0461 GT, was sold to New York collector Bob Lee off the stand at the 1956 New York Auto Show. At the direction of Enzo Ferrari, Lee bought the car for $9,500, far below cost. He still owns it, making it one of the oldest Ferraris still in the hands of the original purchaser.
===250 GT Pinin Farina Coupé Speciale===
Four examples of the 250 GT Coupé Speciale were made, on the type 513 chassis. (Although chassis numbers were in the middle of the Boano 250 GT Coupé run they did not share the same chassis type.). They had Series I 410 Superamerica-style bodies and type 128, 3.0 V12 engines.

===250 GT Berlinetta &quot;Tour de France&quot;===

The original 250 GT Berlinetta, nicknamed the &quot;Long Wheelbase Berlinetta&quot;, was also called the &quot;Tour de France&quot; after competing in the 10-day Tour de France automobile race. Seventy-seven Tour de France cars were built, of which a number were sold for GT races from 1956 through 1959. Construction was handled by Carrozzeria Scaglietti based on a Pinin Farina design. The engine began at but eventually rose to .

At the 1956 Geneva Motor Show, Scaglietti displayed their own 250 GT prototype, which became known as the limited-production, Series I, &quot;no-louvre&quot; 250 GT Berlinetta. The first customer car was built in May 1956, with production now the responsibility of Scaglietti in Modena. Fourteen &quot;no-louvre&quot; and nine &quot;14-louvre&quot; Series I and II Berlinettas were made.

There were four series of 250 GT Berlinettas. In mid-1957 the Series III cars were introduced, with three louvres and covered headlights. Eighteen were produced. The 36 Series IV cars; retained the covered headlights and had a single vent louvre. Zagato also made five &quot;no-louvre&quot; superlight cars to Ugo Zagato&#x27;s design.

A 250 GT Berlinetta won Tour de France Automobile three times in 1956, 1957 and 1958. Ferrari&#x27;s winning streak in this race would be continued with later &#x27;Interim&#x27; and SWB Berlinettas.

===250 GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina Series I===
Released at the Geneva Motor Show in 1957, the original 250 GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina Series I used the wheelbase and the body was styled differently from the Berlinetta.

About 36 examples were produced before a second series was shown at Paris in 1959. These later cars had more in common with the production Berlinetta.

About 200 of the Series II cars were built.

&quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; placed the 250 GT Series I Cabriolet and Coupé ninth on their list of the ten &quot;Greatest Ferraris of all time&quot;.
===250 GT California Spyder LWB===
Designed for export to North America, the 1957 250 GT California Spyder was Scaglietti&#x27;s interpretation of an open-top 250 GT. Aluminium was used for the hood, doors, and trunk lid, with steel elsewhere for most models. Several aluminium-bodied racing versions were also built. The engine was the same as in the 250 Tour de France racing car with up to at 7000 rpm and a maximum torque of at 5000 rpm, from a naturally aspirated SOHC 2 valves per cylinder 60º Ferrari Colombo V12 engine, equipped with 3 Weber carburetors. All used the long chassis.

A total of fifty LWBs were made before the SWB version superseded them in 1960. One example sold at auction on August 18, 2007, in Monterey, California, for $4.9 million.
===250 GT Coupé Pinin Farina===
Needing series production to stabilize his company&#x27;s finances, Enzo Ferrari asked Pinin Farina to design a simple and classic 250 GT coupé. After the 250 GT Coupé Boano/Ellena, Pinin Farina&#x27;s Grugliasco plant expanded and now had the capacity to produce the new 250 GT Coupé Pinin Farina. It was introduced at Milan in 1958, and 335 near-identical examples were built by 1960. Buyers included Prince Bertil of Sweden. The GT Coupé eschewed the fender vents for simple, clean lines and a notchback look with panoramic rear window. The oval grille was replaced by a more traditional long narrow look with protruding headlights. Telescopic shock absorbers were also fitted instead of the Houdailles on previous 250s, and disc brakes were added in 1960. The final 250 GT Coupé had a Superfast tail and was shown at the 1961 London Motor Show.
===250 GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina Series II===
In line with the high-volume coupé, Pinin Farina also designed a plainer 250 GT Cabriolet for series production. Introduced at the 1959 Paris Motor Show, the GT Cabriolet sported a look similar to the GT Coupé of the previous year, including the removal of the side vents. On the Coupé the headlights were uncovered. About 212 were produced.
===250 GT Berlinetta &quot;Interim&quot;===

In 1959, seven 250 GT &quot;Interim&quot; LWB Berlinettas were made. They utilized the old long-wheelbase chassis and had the new Pinin Farina bodywork of the upcoming SWB Berlinettas. The bodies are all-aluminium. Interim vehicles have an additional rear quarter window, absent from the succeeding &quot;Passo Corto&quot; Berlinettas. The Interim vehicles are serial numbers 1377GT, 1461GT, 1465GT, 1509GT, 1519GT, 1521GT and 1523GT. &#x27;Interim&#x27; Berlinetta won 1959 Tour de France Automobile, thus continuing Ferrari&#x27;s dominance.
=== 250 GT Berlinetta SWB===

One of the most notable GT racers of its time, the 1959 250 GT Berlinetta SWB used a short () wheelbase for better handling. Of the 176 examples built, both steel and aluminium bodies were used in various road (&quot;lusso&quot;) and racing trims. Engine output ranged from to .
Development of the 250 GT SWB Berlinetta was handled by Giotto Bizzarrini, Carlo Chiti, and young Mauro Forghieri, the same team that later produced the 250 GTO. Disc brakes were a first on a Ferrari GT, and the combination of low weight, high power, and well-sorted suspension made it competitive. It was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in October and quickly began selling and racing. The SWB Berlinetta won Ferrari the GT class of the 1961 Constructor&#x27;s Championship. Also won 1960, 1961 and 1962 Tour de France Automobile before giving ground to the GTO&#x27;s.

In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; placed the 250 GT SWB seventh on a list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s, and &quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; placed it fifth on a list of the ten &quot;Greatest Ferraris of all time&quot;.
=== 250 GT California Spyder SWB===
In 1959, Ferrari gave the 250 GT Berlinetta sharper handling, reducing its wheelbase (Short Wheelbase, or SWB) from 2,600 mm to 2,400 mm. In 1960, Scaglietti unveiled the 250 GT California Spyder SWB at the Geneva Motor Show, its body pulled more tautly over this updated chassis. Like the 250 GT Berlinetta SWB on which it was based, the revised Spyder also received disc brakes and a version of the three-litre V12. About 55 were built.

The switch to the 2400mm chassis of the 250 GT Berlinetta SWB lowered the body by 30 mm, but an easier way to tell the &quot;passo lungo&quot; (LWB) version from the &quot;passo corto&quot; (SWB) version of the California Spyder is to look at the hood scoop and the vents on sides of the front fenders. The hood scoop is much lower on the SWB version.

A custom-built fiberglass-bodied replica of a 1961–1963 250 GT California Spyder, was featured in the film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Three 1985 Modena Spyders (two running and one shell for destruction) were built on custom frames for the film by Modena Design &amp; Development. One of the running models was sold back to Modena for restoration and in April 2018 became the 22nd vehicle added to the National Historic Vehicle Register.

A 1961 SWB that had been owned by James Coburn was sold for £5.5 million to radio DJ Chris Evans.

A barn-find 1961 SWB owned by French actor Alain Delon while he was making the 1964 film &quot;Les Felins&quot; with Jane Fonda sold for US$15.9 million in February 2015.

On March 11, 2016, at the Omni Amelia Island Plantation, a 1961 SWB sold for US$17.16 million at auction.

===250 GT/E===

The LWB 250 GT theme was expanded with the 2+2 model 250 GT/E, the first large-production four-seat Ferrari (earlier four-seaters were made in very small numbers). Interior space was increased by moving the engine forward in the chassis. The rear seats were suitable for children but small for adults. The standard wheels used on series 1 were the Borrani RW3591, the series 2 and 3 were fitted with the Borrani RW3690 as a standard.

Engine output was listed at . A GTE was famously donated to the Rome Police department, to celebrate their work against the Mafia. It was crashed almost immediately and replaced and served until 1968, with drivers receiving training at Maranello. The Series 2 arrived in 1961 and received additional gauges and some other interior changes including a revised ventilation system. The Series 3 model appeared at Geneva in 1963 (production having started towards the end of 1962) and received external changes: the headlight bezels were thicker, the auxiliary lights were moved outboard of the grille, and the multi-lens taillights were changed for single-piece units. The rear fenders were also lightly reshaped.

955 GT/Es were constructed by Pininfarina with the initial prototypes built in 1959. The car was formally introduced at the October 1960 Paris Motor Show, with production continuing until 1963 over three series. 299 of the first series were built, followed by 356 Series 2 cars, and finally 300 of the third series. The model was followed by the visually similar 330 America, which shared the 250 GT/E&#x27;s chassis but used the larger 4.0-litre engine of the 330 series.

The large production run of the GT/E was a major contributor to Ferrari&#x27;s financial well-being in the early 1960s. MSRP of the GT/E was $11,500.

===250 GT Berlinetta Lusso===

Pininfarina updated the 250 GT with the GT Lusso or GTL. Introduced at the 1962 Paris show, the car had flowing lines and a fastback shape typical of the GT cars of the mid-1960s. The engine was the 250 GTO&#x27;s Tipo 168 with and three Weber 36DCS carburettors.

Built by Scaglietti, the Lusso continued through 1964 with few modifications.

Rock star Eric Clapton owned one, and an example that had been owned by Steve McQueen sold at auction for $2.3 million on 16 August 2007.

In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; placed the 250 GT Lusso tenth on a list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s. Steve Boone, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the group Lovin&#x27; Spoonful owned chassis number #4237, which was stolen from a repair shop in Queens, New York and never found.
==Place in Lamborghini history==

Tractor manufacturer Ferruccio Lamborghini owned several Ferrari 250s. His frustration with Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s response to his complaints about frequent clutch problems was key to his decision to make his own cars. He later hired ex-Ferrari engineers to design and develop them.

<text> (; , ) is a modernized Vietnamese national garment consisting of a long split tunic worn over silk trousers. It can serve as formalwear for both men and women. translates as shirt and means &quot;long&quot;. The term can also be used to describe any clothing attire that consists of a long tunic, such as .

There are inconsistencies in usage of the term &quot;áo dài&quot;. The currently most common usage is for a Francized design by Nguyễn Cát Tường (whose shop was named &quot;Le Mur&quot;), which is expressly a women&#x27;s close-fitting design whose torso is two pieces of cloth sewn together and fastened with buttons. A more specific term for this design would be &quot;áo dài Le Mur&quot;. Other writers, especially those who claim its &quot;traditionality,&quot; use &quot;áo dài&quot; as a general category of garments for both men and women, and include older designs such as &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; (five-piece torso), &quot;áo tứ thân&quot; (four-piece torso, no buttons), &quot;áo đối khâm&quot; (four-piece torso, no buttons), &quot;áo giao lĩnh/lãnh&quot; (six-piece torso, no buttons). Some writers even go so far to claim that the term &quot;áo dài&quot; (&quot;long top/garment&quot;) may have been calqued from Chinese terms for Manchu garments, such as the Mandarin &quot;changshan&quot;/&quot;changpao&quot; (長衫/長袍, men&#x27;s &quot;long top/robe&quot;) and the Cantonese &quot;cheongsam&quot; (長衫, women&#x27;s &quot;long top&quot;), and include these garments in the category of &quot;áo dài&quot;.

The predecessor of the was derived by the Nguyễn lords in during 18th century. This outfit was derived from the , a five-piece dress commonly worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The áo dài was later made to be form-fitting which was influenced by the French, and other Hanoi artists redesigned the as a modern dress in the 1920s and 1930s. The updated look was promoted by the artists and magazines of (Self-Reliant Literary Group) as a national costume for the modern era. In the 1950s, Saigon designers tightened the fit to produce the version worn by Vietnamese women. The dress for women was extremely popular in South Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s. On and other occasions, Vietnamese men may wear an (brocade robe), a version of the made of very thick fabric and with sewed symbols.

The dress has traditionally been marketed with a feminine appeal, with &quot;Miss Ao Dai&quot; pageants being popular in Vietnam and with overseas Vietnamese.

== Origin ==

=== Switch to trousers (18th century) ===
For centuries, peasant women typically wore a halter top () underneath a blouse or overcoat, alongside a skirt (&quot;váy&quot;). Aristocrats, on the other hand, favored a cross-collared robe called &quot;áo giao lĩnh&quot;. When the Ming dynasty occupied Đại Việt during the Fourth Era of Northern Domination in 1407, it forced the women to wear Chinese-style pants. The following Lê dynasty also criticized women for violating Neo-Confucian dress norms, but only enforced the dress code haphazardly, so skirts and halter tops remained the norm. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Vietnam was divided into northern and southern realms, with the Nguyễn lords ruling the south. To distinguish the southern people from the northerners, in 1744, Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát of Huế decreed that both men and women at his court wear trousers and a gown with buttons down the front. The members of the southern court were thus distinguished from the courtiers of the Trịnh Lords in Hanoi, who wore &quot;áo giao lĩnh&quot; with long skirts.

According to Lê Quý Đôn&#x27;s record in the book &quot;Phủ Biên Tạp Lục&quot; (recording most of the important information about the economy and society of Đàng Trong for nearly 200 years), the áo dài (or rather, the forerunner of the áo dài) created by Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát based on Chinese Ming Dynasty costumes, by how to learn the method of making costumes in the book &quot;Sāncái Túhuì&quot; as the standard.

=== 19th century ===
The &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; (five part dress) had two flaps sewn together in the back, two flaps sewn together in the front, and a &quot;baby flap&quot; hidden underneath the main front flap. The gown appeared to have two-flaps with slits on both sides, features preserved in the later áo dài. Compared to a modern áo dài, the front and back flaps were much broader and the fit looser and much shorter. It had a high collar and was buttoned in the same fashion as a modern áo dài. Women could wear the dress with the top few buttons undone, revealing a glimpse of their &quot;yếm&quot; underneath.

=== 20th century ===

==== Modernization of style ====

Huế&#x27;s Đồng Khánh Girl&#x27;s High School, which opened in 1917, was widely praised for the áo dài uniform worn by its students. The first modernized áo dài appeared at a Paris fashion show in 1921. In 1930, Hanoi artist Cát Tường, also known as Le Mur, designed a dress inspired by the &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; and by Paris fashions. It reached to the floor and fit the curves of the body by using darts and a nipped-in waist. When fabric became inexpensive, the rationale for multiple layers and thick flaps disappeared. Modern textile manufacture allows for wider panels, eliminating the need to sew narrow panels together. The &quot;áo dài Le Mur&quot;, or &quot;trendy&quot; ao dai, created a sensation when model Nguyễn Thị Hậu wore it for a feature published by the newspaper &quot;Today&quot; in January 1935. The style was promoted by the artists of Tự Lực văn đoàn (&quot;Self-Reliant Literary Group&quot;) as a national costume for the modern era. The painter Lê Phô introduced several popular styles of ao dai beginning in 1934. Such Westernized garments temporarily disappeared during World War II (1939–45).

In the 1950s, Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) designers tightened the fit of the áo dài to create the version commonly seen today. Trần Kim of Thiết Lập Tailors and Dũng of Dũng Tailors created a dress with raglan sleeves and a diagonal seam that runs from the collar to the underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The áo dài was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A brightly colored &quot;áo dài hippy&quot; was introduced in 1968. The &quot;áo dài mini&quot;, a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels that reached only to the knee.

==== Communist period ====
The áo dài has always been more common in the South than in the North. The communists, who gained power in the North in 1954 and in the South in 1975, had conflicted feelings about the áo dài. They praised it as a national costume and one was worn to the Paris Peace Conference (1969–73) by Viet Cong negotiator Nguyễn Thị Bình. Yet Westernized versions of the dress and those associated with &quot;decadent&quot; Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) of the 1960s and early 1970s were condemned. Economic crisis, famine, and war with Cambodia combined to make the 1980s a fashion low point. The áo dài was rarely worn except at weddings and other formal occasions, with the older, looser-fitting style preferred. Overseas Vietnamese, meanwhile, kept tradition alive with &quot;Miss Ao Dai&quot; pageants (&quot;Hoa Hậu Áo Dài&quot;), the most notable one held annually in Long Beach, California.

The áo dài experienced a revival beginning in late 1980s, when state enterprise and schools began adopting the dress as a uniform again. In 1989, 16,000 Vietnamese attended a Miss Ao Dai Beauty Contest held in Ho Chi Minh City. When the Miss International Pageant in Tokyo gave its &quot;Best National Costume&quot; award to an áo dài-clad Trường Quỳnh Mai in 1995, &quot;Thời Trang Trẻ&quot; (New Fashion Magazine) claimed that Vietnam&#x27;s &quot;national soul&quot; was &quot;once again honored&quot;. An &quot;áo dài craze&quot; followed that lasted for several years and led to wider use of the dress as a school uniform.

== Present day ==

No longer deemed politically controversial, áo dài fashion design is supported by the Vietnamese government. It is often called &quot;áo dài Việt Nam&quot; to link it to patriotic feelings. Designer Le Si Hoang is a celebrity in Vietnam and his shop in Ho Chi Minh City is the place to visit for those who admire the dress. In Hanoi, tourists get fitted with áo dài on Luong Van Can Street. The elegant city of Huế in the central region is known for its áo dài, &quot;nón lá&quot; (), and well-dressed women.

The áo dài is now a standard for weddings, for celebrating Tết and for other formal occasions. It is the required uniform for female teachers (mostly from high school to below) and female students in common high schools in the South; there is no requirement for color or pattern for teachers while students use plain white or with some small patterns like flowers for use as school uniforms. Companies often require their female staff to wear uniforms that include the áo dài, so flight attendants, receptionists, bank female staff, restaurant staff, and hotel workers in Vietnam may be seen wearing it.

The most popular style of áo dài fits tightly around the wearer&#x27;s upper torso, emphasizing her bust and curves. Although the dress covers the entire body, it is thought to be provocative, especially when made of thin fabric. &quot;The áo dài covers everything, but hides nothing&quot;, according to one saying. The dress must be individually fitted and usually requires several weeks for a tailor to complete. An ao dai costs about $200 in the United States and about $40 in Vietnam.

&quot;Symbolically, the áo dài invokes nostalgia and timelessness associated with a gendered image of the homeland for which many Vietnamese people throughout the diaspora yearn,&quot; wrote Nhi T. Lieu, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin. The difficulties of working while wearing an ao dai link the dress to frailty and innocence, she wrote. Vietnamese writers who favor the use of the áo dài as a school uniform cite the inconvenience of wearing it as an advantage, a way of teaching students feminine behavior such as modesty, caution, and a refined manner.

The áo dài is featured in an array of Asian-themed or related movies. In &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; (1987), Robin Williams&#x27;s character is wowed by áo dài-clad women when he first arrives in Ho Chi Minh City. The 1992 films &quot;Indochine&quot; and &quot;The Lover&quot; inspired several international fashion houses to design áo dài collections, including Prada&#x27;s SS08 collection and a Georgio Armani collection. In the Vietnamese film &quot;The White Silk Dress&quot; (2007), an áo dài is the sole legacy that the mother of a poverty-stricken family has to pass on to her daughters. The Hanoi City Complex, a 65-story building now under construction, will have an áo dài-inspired design. Vietnamese designers created áo dài for the contestants in the Miss Universe beauty contest, which was held July 2008 in Nha Trang, Vietnam.
The most prominent annual Ao Dai Festival outside of Vietnam is held each year in San Jose, California, a city that is home to a large Vietnamese American community. This event features an international array of designer áo dài under the direction of festival founder, Jenny Do.

In recent years, a shorter, more modern version of the áo dài, known as the &quot;áo dài cách tân&quot;, is often worn by the younger generation. This modern áo dài has a shorter front and back flap, hitting just below the knees.

== Criticism ==
Áo dài is the traditional attire of Vietnam, considered a symbol of the graceful and elegant beauty of Vietnamese women. However, besides the praises, it is met with criticism from some.

One of the most common criticisms of is excessive renovation. In recent years, renovated types has become very popular, with a variety of styles, materials, and colors. However, some people believe that excessive renovation has eroded the &quot;traditional beauty&quot; of .

<doc id="1199840" wikidata="Q3339775" url="?curid=1199840" title="Nick Minchin">
<text>Nicholas Hugh Minchin (born 15 April 1953) is an Australian former politician and former Australian Consul-General in New York, USA. He previously served as a Liberal member of the Australian Senate representing South Australia from July 1993 to June 2011, and a former cabinet minister in the Howard government.

==Early life and education==
Minchin was born in Sydney and was educated at the Australian National University, Canberra, where he gained degrees in law and economics. Minchin attended Knox Grammar School and spent a year in the United States as an exchange student with AFS International Scholarships. While at university, he was a resident of Burgmann College at the same time as Peter Garrett. He was a solicitor before entering politics.

==Political career==

Minchin was a staff member for the Liberal Party&#x27;s Federal Secretariat 1977–83, Deputy Federal Director of the Liberal Party in 1983, South Australian State Director and Campaign Director of the Liberal Party 1985–93. On 13 March 1993, Minchin was elected to the Australian Senate for South Australia, with his term starting on 1 July.

Minchin was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1994–96, holding the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister John Howard 1996–97, Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister 1997–98, and Minister for Industry, Science and Resources 1998–2001, with a seat in the Cabinet. He was Minister for Finance and Administration from November 2001 until the defeat of the Howard government at the 2007 federal election. Until that election he also held the posts of Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council.

Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia&#x27;s compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that &quot;compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of ... civil liberties&quot;. He supported states&#x27; rights in Cabinet. As Leader of the Government in the Senate he played a significant role in pursuing and defending its reforms of the Senate committee system, implemented in 2006 following his government&#x27;s success in securing a majority of Senate seats at the 2004 election.

=== Retirement ===
Minchin announced on 24 March 2010 that he would not be contesting his Senate seat at the next Australian federal election. His term ended on 30 June 2011. He also resigned his Opposition portfolios and addressed the media saying that: &quot;I love politics. This is not an easy decision to make ... when something like that happens and when one of your children, quite frankly, has a near-death experience, it does make you reassess your life and your priorities&quot;. His son, Oliver was seriously injured in a boat accident while training with the Australian Defence Force Academy in February 2010.

==After politics==
On 14 February 2014 Minchin was appointed to the role of Australian Consul-General in New York, which he held until May 2017. His appointment followed the controversial termination of the Labor-appointed nominee to the position, Steve Bracks (the former Premier of Victoria), by the incoming Abbott government in September 2013.

In 2018 Minchin was appointed to a five-year term on the Foreign Investment Review Board.

==Policy positions==
Minchin has been a strong proponent of privatisation and wholesale labour market deregulation. He has defended the full privatisation of Telstra, and argued that the Commonwealth should sell its Telstra shares to buy a portfolio of other income-earning investments rather than spend the profits on national infrastructure.

In March 2006, Minchin received extensive media coverage when he highlighted the dilemma his government faced in the field of industrial relations and aired his views about future policy proposals. Speaking at a conference of the H. R. Nicholls Society where he told the audience that the coalition &quot;knew its reform to WorkChoices were not popular but the process of change must continue&quot;, and that &quot;there is still a long way to go... awards, the IR commission, all the rest of it...&quot;, he went on to say &quot;The fact is the great majority of the Australian people do not support what we are doing on industrial relations. They violently disagree.&quot;

===Tobacco===
In 1995 Minchin submitted a dissenting Senate report on the tobacco industry and the costs of tobacco-related illness that disputed the committee&#x27;s statements that it believes cigarettes are addictive and that passive smoking is harmful. Minchin claimed the tobacco industry was over-regulated. He also disagreed with the conclusions about the addictiveness of nicotine and the harmfulness of passive smoking:

A 2009 article in The Australian drew parallels between his stance on tobacco and his stance as a global warming denial.

In 2007, Minchin admitted to smoking cannabis at high school and university.

===Climate change===
In a March 2007 letter to the founder of &quot;Clean Up Australia&quot;, Ian Kiernan, Minchin expressed doubts that climate change was caused by human activity. In the letter, Minchin cited the writings of the Canadian newspaper columnist Lawrence Solomon, who in turn cited the disputed theories of Danish scientist Henrik Svensmark. Minchin said that the ETS bill was &quot;the work of madman&quot; and an &quot;abomination&quot;, and observed that &quot;Mr Rudd&#x27;s arrogance and vanity in wanting to lead the world in cutting CO2 emissions is really sickening&quot;.

Minchin campaigned against an emissions trading scheme (ETS) bill.

On 22 September 2008, the parliamentary leader of the Liberal Party, Malcolm Turnbull, appointed Minchin as Shadow Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Minchin had been previously Shadow Minister for Defence. However, on 26 November 2009, Minchin resigned from the shadow cabinet in protest at Turnbull&#x27;s position on the government&#x27;s emissions trading scheme.

Turnbull later stated on ABC Radio that, according to Minchin, &quot;the world is not warming, it&#x27;s cooling and the climate change issue is part of a vast left-wing conspiracy to deindustrialise the world&quot;.

=== Nuclear fuel cycle ===
As Minister for Industry Science and Resources (1998-2001), Minchin became the first Commonwealth minister to have had responsibility for the entire nuclear fuel cycle. Activity at this time included uranium mining, management of Australia&#x27;s only nuclear reactor and the management of radioactive waste. During this period, Minchin approved the Beverley uranium mine in South Australia, commissioned a replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights and identified a future site for a national radioactive waste repository. In his valedictory speech, Minchin reflected on this period, saying:&quot;Responsibility for all matters radioactive was certainly testing... I failed in my responsibility to establish a national radioactive waste repository in the central north of South Australia, one of the best sites in the world for such a facility.&quot;

==Personal life==
Nick Minchin is a distant cousin of Australian comedian Tim Minchin. His wife, Kerry Wakefield, is a journalist and blogger who writes for The Spectator and is on the advisory council of Advance Australia. They married in 1984, having met while she was working in the Canberra press gallery when her boyfriend was Peter Garrett.

<text>Yiddish theatre consists of plays written and performed primarily by Jews in Yiddish, the language of the Ashkenazi Jewish community. The range of Yiddish theatre is broad: operetta, musical comedy, and satiric or nostalgic revues; melodrama; naturalist drama; expressionist and modernist plays. At its height, its geographical scope was comparably broad: from the late 19th century until just before World War II, professional Yiddish theatre could be found throughout the heavily Jewish areas of Eastern and East Central Europe, but also in Berlin, London, Paris, Buenos Aires and New York City.

Yiddish theatre&#x27;s roots include the often satiric plays traditionally performed during religious holiday of Purim (known as Purimshpils); the singing of cantors in the synagogues; Jewish secular song and dramatic improvisation; exposure to the theatre traditions of various European countries, and the Jewish literary culture that had grown in the wake of the Jewish enlightenment (Haskalah).

Israil Bercovici wrote that it is through Yiddish theatre that &quot;Jewish culture entered in dialogue with the outside world,&quot; both by putting itself on display and by importing theatrical pieces from other cultures.

Themes such as immigration, poverty, integration, and strong ancestral ties can be found in many Yiddish theatre productions.

==Sources in traditional Jewish culture==

Noah Prilutski (1882–1941) noted that Yiddish theatre did not arise simultaneously with theatre in other European &quot;national&quot; languages; he conjectured that this was at least in part because the Jewish sense of nationality favored Hebrew over Yiddish as a &quot;national&quot; language, but few Jews of the period were actually comfortable using Hebrew outside of a religious/liturgical context. 
Nonetheless, various types of performances, including those of cantors, preachers, jesters, and instrumental musicians, were a part of Eastern European Jewish life long before the formal advent of Yiddish theatre.

Bercovici suggests that, as with ancient Greek drama, elements of dramatic performance arose in Jewish life as an artistic refinement of religious practice; he highlights references in the Bible to dance, music, or song, especially in the Psalms (Hebrew &quot;tehillim&quot;, or songs of praise), where some of the headings refer to musical instruments, or to singing in dialogue, either between parts of the choir, or between the choir and the leader of the ritual (Hebrew &quot;menatseach&quot;). Also, traditional dances were associated with certain holidays, such as Sukkot.

Purim plays – the skits performed by amateur companies around the time of the Purim holiday – were a significant early form of theatrical expression. Often satiric and topical, Purim plays were traditionally performed in the courtyard of the synagogue, because they were considered too profane to be performed inside the building. These made heavy use of masks and other theatrical devices; the masquerade (and the singing and dancing) generally extended to the whole congregation, not just a small set of players. While many Purim plays told the story in the Book of Esther commemorated by the Purim holiday, others used other stories from Jewish scripture, such as the story of Joseph sold by his brothers or the sacrifice of Isaac. Over time, these well-known stories became less a subject matter than a pretext for topical and satiric theatre. Mordechai became a standard role for a clown.

Purim plays were published as early as the early 18th century. At least eight Purim plays were published between 1708 and 1720; most of these do not survive (at least some were burned in &quot;autos da fe&quot;), but one survives in the &quot;Jüdische Merkwürdigkeiten&quot; (1714), a collection by Johann Jakob Schudt (1664–1722).

Another similar current in Jewish culture was a tradition of masked dancers performing after weddings. The most elaborate form of this was the Dance of Death, a pageant depicting all layers of a society, which had originated among Sephardic Jews in Spain in the 14th century and had spread through Europe among both Jews and Gentiles. 16th-century Italian Jews had taken music and dance to an even more refined level of art: at that time in Italy there were Jewish virtuosi and dancing masters in Mantua, Ferrara, and Rome, and the first known troupes of Jewish performers in Europe. Less refined versions of the same also occurred in 18th-century Germany.

Additionally, there was a rich tradition of dialogues in the Jewish poetry known as &quot;Tahkemoni&quot;, dating back at least to Yehuda al-Harizi in 12th-century Spain. Al-Harizi&#x27;s work contained dialogues between believer and heretic, man and wife, day and night, land and ocean, wisdom and foolishness, avarice and generosity. Such dialogues figured prominently in early Yiddish theatre.

In the journal &quot;Nostalgia in Jewish-American Theatre and Film, 1979-2004&quot;, Ben Furnish establishes the deep roots of nostalgia based on Jewish history. Many of these origins are based in stories like that of the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE) of Jews from the Holy Land. Shows up to present day productions pull influence from these experiences, creating a concrete picture of Yiddish themes and tenets seen in Jewish theatre.

The origin of theatre in Christian societies in Europe is often traced to Passion Plays and other religious pageants, similar in some ways to the Purim plays. In the Middle Ages, few Jews would have seen these: they were often performed in the courtyards of Christian churches (few of which were near the Jewish ghettos), on Christian holidays, and they often had significant antisemitic elements in their plots and dialogue. However, in later times, the Romanian Orthodox Christmas tradition of &quot;Irozii&quot; — minstrel shows centered around the figure of Herod the Great (Rom: &quot;Irod&quot;), which were the origin of Romanian-language theatre — definitely influenced Purim plays and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

Jews had far more exposure to secular European theatre once that developed. Meistersinger Hans Sachs&#x27; many plays on Old Testament topics were widely admired by the Jews of the German ghettos, and from the 16th century through the 18th, the biblical story of Esther was the most popular theatrical theme in Christian Europe, often under the Latin name &quot;Acta Ahasuerus&quot;.

==Early years (pre-1876)==
Professional Yiddish theatre is generally dated from 1876, although there is scattered evidence of earlier efforts.

Besides some 19 amateur Yiddish-language theatrical troupes in and around Warsaw in the 1830s, there was also, according to one contemporary source, a professional company that in 1838 performed before a receptive audience of both Jews and Gentiles a five-act drama &quot;Moses&quot;, by a certain A. Schertspierer of Vienna, with &quot;well-drawn characters and good dramatic situations and language.&quot; The same source relates that this theatre had among its patrons a number of Russian military officers, including one general who was considered a &quot;protector&quot; of it – a circumstance that suggests the difficulties it faced.

Around the same time, there are indications of a traveling Yiddish-language theatre troupe in Galicia, organized along the lines of an English or Italian theatre troupe.

In 1854, two rabbinical students from Zhytomyr put on a play in Berdichev. Shortly afterward, the Ukrainian Jew Abraham Goldfaden, generally considered the founder of the first professional Yiddish theatre troupe, attended that same rabbinical school, and while there is known to have played (in 1862) a woman&#x27;s role in a play, &quot;Serkele&quot;, by Solomon Ettinger. Shortly after that (1869, according to one source), Goldfaden wrote a dialogue &quot;Tsvey Shkheynes&quot; (&quot;Two Neighbors&quot;), apparently intended for the stage, and published with moderate success. A short-lived Yiddish theater in Odessa in 1864 performed dramas &quot;Esther&quot; and &quot;Athalia&quot;. Abraham Baer Gottlober&#x27;s &quot;Decktuch&quot;, like Ettinger&#x27;s &quot;Serkele&quot;, was written between 1830 and 1840, but published much later; Israel Aksenfeld (died &quot;c.&quot; 1868) wrote several dramas in Yiddish, which were probably not staged in his lifetime. Another early Yiddish dramatist was Joel Baer Falkovich (&quot;Reb Chaimele der Koẓin&quot;, Odessa, 1866; &quot;Rochel die Singerin&quot;, Zhytomyr, 1868). Solomon Jacob Abramowitsch&#x27;s &quot;Die Takse&quot; (1869) has the form of a drama, but, like Eliakim Zunser&#x27;s later &quot;Mekirat Yosef&quot; (Vilnius, 1893), it was not intended for the stage.

Hersh Leib Sigheter (1829–1930) wrote satirical Purim plays on an annual basis and hired boys to play in them. Although often objected to by rabbis, these plays were popular, and were performed not only on Purim but for as much as a week afterwards in various locations.

Another current that led equally to professional Yiddish theatre was a tradition resembling that of the troubadours or Minnesänger, apparently growing out of the music associated with Jewish weddings, and often involving singers who also functioned as cantors in synagogues. The first records of the early &quot;Brodersänger&quot; or Broder singers are the remarks of Jews passing through Brody, which was on a major route of travel, generally disapproving of the singing of songs when no particular occasion called for music. The most famous of the singers from Brody was the itinerant Berl Margulis (1815–1868), known as Berl Broder, &quot;Berl from Brody&quot;; 24 of his 30 surviving songs are in the form of dialogues. Another influential performer in this style was Benjamin Wolf Ehrenkrantz (1826–1883), known as Velvel Zbarjer. Bercovici describes his work as &quot;mini-melodramas in song&quot;.

Such performers, who performed at weddings, in the salons of the wealthy, in the summer gardens, and in other secular gathering places of the Eastern European Jews, were not mere singers. They often used costumes and often improvised spoken material between songs, especially when working in groups. Israel Grodner, later Goldfaden&#x27;s first actor, participated in an outdoor concert in Odessa in 1873 with dialogues between songs comparable to much of what was in Goldfaden&#x27;s earliest plays. Goldfaden himself was already a noted poet, and many of his poems had been set to music and had become popular songs, some of which were used in that 1873 performance.

Finally, around this time Yiddish was establishing itself as a literary language, and some Jews with secular interests were familiar with the dominant theatrical traditions of their respective countries; given this burgeoning literary intellectual culture, within a year or two of Goldfaden&#x27;s founding the first professional Yiddish theatre troupe, there were multiple troupes, multiple playwrights, and more than a few serious Yiddish theatre critics and theoreticians.

==Goldfaden and the birth of Yiddish theatre in Romania==
Abraham Goldfaden is generally considered the founder of the first professional Yiddish theatre troupe, which he founded in Iaşi, Romania in 1876, and later moved to Bucharest. His own career also took him to Imperial Russia, Lemberg in Habsburg Galicia (today Lviv in Ukraine), and New York City. Within two years of Goldfaden&#x27;s founding of his troupe, there were several rival troupes in Bucharest, mostly founded by former members of Goldfaden&#x27;s troupe. Most of these troupes followed Goldfaden&#x27;s original formula of musical vaudeville and light comedy, while Goldfaden himself turned more toward relatively serious operettas about biblical and historical subjects, especially after his own company left Bucharest for an extended tour of the cities of Imperial Russia.

Goldfaden&#x27;s troupe began as all-male; while they soon acquired actresses, as well, it remained relatively common in Yiddish theatre for female roles, especially comic roles, to be played by men. (Women also sometimes played men&#x27;s roles: Molly Picon was a famous Shmendrick.)
Many early Yiddish theatre pieces were constructed around a very standard set of roles: &quot;a prima donna, a soubrette, a comic, a lover, a villain, a villainess (or &quot;intriguer&quot;), an older man and woman for character roles, and one or two more for spares as the plot might require,&quot; and a musical component that might range from a single fiddler to an orchestra. This was very convenient for a repertory company, especially a traveling one. Both at the start and well into the great years of Yiddish theatre, the troupes were often in one or another degree family affairs, with a husband, wife, and often their offspring playing in the same troupe.

At its high end, early Yiddish theatre was noted for its pageantry. A pageant about the coronation of Solomon, presented on the occasion of the 1881 coronation of Carol I of Romania was described by Ion Ghica as &quot;among the most imposing things that paraded the coronation&quot;; he acquired the costumes for the Romanian National Theatre, which he headed at the time.

Both the nature and aspirations of early professional Yiddish theatre are reflected in Moses Schwarzfeld&#x27;s 1877 remarks calling for serious and &quot;educational&quot; Jewish theatre: &quot;If we write only comedies or if we only imitate German, Romanian and French pieces translated into Yiddish, all we will have is a secondary Jewish stage ... just making people laugh and cry is an &quot;evil&quot; for us Jews in Romania.&quot; Goldfaden himself agreed with such sentiments; later recalling his views at the time, he wrote: &quot;If I have arrived at having a stage, I want it to be a school for you ... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, watching you, feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I&#x27;ll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you shall also cry — while my heart shall be glad.&quot;

B. Nathansohn, correspondent of the Warsaw-based Jewish newspaper &quot;Hamelitz&quot; visited Romania in the summer of 1878 and wrote, &quot;When a Jew enters a Yiddish theatre in Bucharest he is thunderstruck hearing the Yiddish language in all its splendor and radiance&quot;, and called upon Goldfaden to create similar theatres in Warsaw, Lublin, Vilna, Berdichev, and Balta.

While Yiddish theatre was an immediate hit with the broad masses of Jews, was generally liked and admired by Jewish intellectuals and many Gentile intellectuals, a small but socially powerful portion of the Jewish community, centered among Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, remained opposed to it. Besides complaints about the mingling of men and women in public and about the use of music and dance outside of sacred contexts, the two main criticisms from this quarter were (1) that the Yiddish &quot;jargon&quot; was being promoted to the detriment of &quot;proper&quot; Hebrew and (2) that satire against Hasidim and others would not necessarily be understood as satire and would make Jews look ridiculous. Bercovici quotes an anonymous 1885 article as responding to these criticisms by saying (1) that all Jews speak &quot;some&quot; modern language and why should Yiddish be any more detrimental to Hebrew than Romanian, Russian, or German; and (2) that the Gentiles who would come to Yiddish theatre would not be the antisemites, they would be those who already knew and liked Jews, and that they would recognize satire for what it was, adding that these criticisms were &quot;nothing&quot; when weighed against the education that Yiddish theatre was bringing to the lower classes.

Writing of Sigmund Mogulesko&#x27;s troupe in Romania in 1884, and probably referring to the plays of Moses Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner, Moses Gaster wrote that Yiddish theatre &quot;represents scenes from our history known by only a tiny minority, refreshing, therefore, secular memory&quot; and &quot;shows us our defects, which we have like all men, but not with a tendency to strike at our own immorality with a tendency towards ill will, but only with an ironic spirit that does not wound us, as we are wounded by representations on other stages, where the Jew plays a degrading role.&quot;

Goldfaden&#x27;s plays ultimately formed a canon of Yiddish theater, and were performed continuously for over fifty years; in the theatre world they were reverently regarded as a kind of &quot;Torah from Sinai&quot;, and the characters of the plays permeated Jewish cultural life over several generations.

==Yiddish theatre in Russia==

If Yiddish theatre was born in Romania, its youth occurred in Imperial Russia, largely in what is now Ukraine. Israel Rosenberg&#x27;s troupe (which later had a series of managers, including Goldfaden&#x27;s brother Tulya, and which at one point split in two, with one half led by actor Jacob Adler) gave Russia&#x27;s first professional Yiddish theatre performance in Odessa in 1878. Goldfaden himself soon came to Odessa, pushing Rosenberg&#x27;s troupe into the provinces, and Osip Mikhailovich Lerner and N.M. Sheikevitch also founded a Yiddish theatre at Odessa, which for several years became the capital of Yiddish theatre.

Russia offered a more sophisticated audience than rural Romania: many Russian Jews were regular attendees of Russian-language theatre, and Odessa was a first-rate theatre city. In this context, serious melodramatic operettas, and even straight plays, took their place in the repertoire among the lighter vaudevilles and comedies that had thus far predominated. All three major troupes in Odessa did their own productions of Karl Gutzkow&#x27;s play &quot;Uriel Acosta&quot; (with Goldfaden&#x27;s production being an operetta).

However, even this increased sophistication could not compare to later, more ambitious efforts of the Yiddish theater. Looking back on this period, although acknowledging certain of Goldfaden&#x27;s plays from this era as &quot;masterpieces&quot;, Jacob Adler saw this as a period of relative mediocrity compared to what came later. &quot;For three years I... wandered in the cave of the Witch and the motley of Shmendrick and what did I really know of my trade?&quot; he describes himself as thinking in 1883. &quot;If someday I return to Yiddish theater let me at least not be so ignorant.&quot; Much of the theater performed during this period was later referred to as &quot;shund,&quot; or trash, though critics such as Itsik Manger felt it possessed a naive energy and was unfairly maligned.

What seemed, for a time, a boundless future in Russia was cut short by the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II; Yiddish theatre was banned, under an order effective September 14, 1883. This ban caused an exodus of Yiddish actors and playwrights to other countries – Poland, in particular – where they had the freedom to perform.

The Moscow Yiddish Theater, or Jewish Kamerny Theatre in Moscow, or new Yiddish Chamber Theater, directed by Aleksey Granovsky, and with contributors including Marc Chagall, was founded in Petrograd in June 1919 as an experimental workshop then became the Moscow State Jewish Theatre.

==Yiddish theatre in London==
Of the next era of Yiddish theatre, Adler, who arrived in London with his wife Sonya in 1883, wrote, &quot;...if Yiddish theater was destined to go through its infancy in Russia, and in America grew to manhood and success, then London was its school.&quot; The arrival of Adler and his troupe beckoned the era of professional Yiddish theatre in London, and as word of the troupe&#x27;s arrival started to spread throughout the East End, they began to receive financial assistance from the local community which allowed them to form the Russian Jewish Operatic Company. In London in the 1880s, playing in small theatre clubs &quot;on a stage the size of a cadaver&quot;, not daring to play on a Friday night or to light a fire on stage on a Saturday afternoon (both because of the Jewish Sabbath), forced to use a cardboard ram&#x27;s horn when playing &quot;Uriel Acosta&quot; so as not to blaspheme, Yiddish theatre nonetheless took on much of what was best in European theatrical tradition.

In this period, the plays of Schiller first entered the repertoire of Yiddish theatre, beginning with &quot;The Robbers&quot;, the start of a vogue that would last a quarter of a century. Adler records that, like Shakespeare, Schiller was &quot;revered&quot; by the broad Jewish public, not just by intellectuals, admired for his &quot;almost socialist view of society&quot;, although his plays were often radically adapted for the Yiddish stage, shortening them and dropping Christian, antisemitic, and classical mythological references There were several smaller Jewish theatre groups in Manchester and Glasgow.

The opening of a Yiddish theatre at the Pavilion Theatre in 1906 marked a new era for the Yiddish theatre in London, providing a permanent home for the theatre for almost three decades. The theatre was home to a number of actor-managers throughout its history, the first being Sigmund Feinman, a Yiddish actor and playwright who grew to prominence on the American Yiddish stage. Feinman staged plays such as Gordin&#x27;s &quot;The Jewish King Lear,&quot; for which Adler returned for a guest appearance in the lead role. The Pavilion Theatre closed as a Yiddish theatre in 1935. It was succeeded by the Grand Palais Theatre and the New Yiddish Theatre Company at the Adler Hall, Whitechapel.

==Yiddish theatre in Poland==

Poland was an important center of Yiddish theatrical activity, with more than 400 Yiddish theatrical companies performing in the country during the interwar period. One of the most important companies, the avant-garde Vilna Troupe (Vilner trupe), formed in Vilna, as its name suggests, but moved to Warsaw in 1917. The Vilna Troupe employed some of the most accomplished actors on the Yiddish stage, including Avrom Morevski, who played the Miropolyer tsaddik in the first performance of The Dybbuk, and Joseph Buloff, who was the lead actor of the Vilna Troupe and went on to further accomplishments with Maurice Schwartz’s Yiddish Art Theater in New York. It was in Warsaw that the Vilna Troupe staged the first performance of The Dybbuk in 1920, a play that made a profound and lasting impression on Yiddish theater and world culture. The Vilna Troupe inspired the creation of more avant-garde and ambitious Yiddish theatrical companies, including the Warsaw Yiddish Art Theater, founded by Zygmunt Turkow and Ida Kamińska in 1924, the Warsaw New Yiddish Theater, founded by Jonas Turkow in 1929, and the Young Theater, founded by Michal Weichert in 1932.

In addition to the serious artistic efforts of the art theaters, cabaret flourished in Poland during the interwar period, combining musical performances with standup comedy. The most celebrated practitioners of this kind of performance were Shimen Dzigan and Yisroel Shumacher, who began their lifelong Yiddish comedy career at the theater Ararat in Łódź in 1927. Puppet and marionette theater also attained great artistic significance, often staging satirical shows on contemporary social issues.

Yiddish theater in Poland reflected the political preoccupations of its time. They struggled financially, like all Jewish cultural institutions during that period, even while flourishing for a time during a more liberal political atmosphere. Actors and directors, just like others during that period, were highly aware of labor relations, and tried to create egalitarian working relationships. Organizations such as the Yiddish Actors’ Union, based in Warsaw, played a crucial role in providing a forum for theater professionals to discuss these issues and try new solutions, such as collectively run theaters. Theatrical performances themselves also addressed social issues. Michal Weichert&#x27;s Yung-teater was particularly known for political engagement, staging an attention-getting avant-garde performance of the play Boston, by Bernhard Blum, about the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, in 1933.

==Yiddish theatre in the Americas==
The 1883 Russian ban on Yiddish theatre (lifted in 1904) effectively pushed it to Western Europe and then to America. Over the next few decades, successive waves of Yiddish performers arrived in New York (and, to a lesser extent, in Berlin, London, Vienna, and Paris), some simply as artists seeking an audience, but many as a result of persecutions, pogroms and economic crises in Eastern Europe. Professional Yiddish theatre in London began in 1884, and flourished until the mid-1930s. By 1896, Kalman Juvelier&#x27;s troupe was the only one that remained in Romania, where Yiddish theatre had started, although Mogulesko sparked a revival there in 1906. There was also some activity in Warsaw and Lvov, which were under Austrian rather than Russian rule.

In this era, Yiddish theatre existed almost entirely on stage, rather than in texts. The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; of 1901–1906 reported, &quot;There are probably less than fifty printed Yiddish dramas, and the entire number of written dramas of which there is any record hardly exceeds five hundred. Of these at least nine-tenths are translations or adaptations.&quot;

===United States===
Yiddish Theater in the United States has been described as &quot;a keepsake of home, and yet also a means of acculturation&quot; for the 2.5 million Jews who immigrated from 1881 to 1924. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, amateur theatrical companies presented Yiddish productions in New York City, leading to regular weekend performances at theatres such as the Bowery Garden, the National and the Thalia, with unknowns such as Boris Thomashefsky emerging as stars. The Thalia Theatre sought to change the material of the Yiddish stage to better reform the material that was being produced. “The reformers of the Yiddish stage, Jacob Gordin later explained, wanted to “utilize the theatre for higher purposes; to derive from it not only amusement, but education.” Jacob Gordin himself had numerous times tried to get his plays onto the Windsor stage without luck. “Gordin successfully challenged Lateiner and Hurwitz in 1891–1892 when he entered the Yiddish theatre with an avowed purpose of reforming Yiddish drama.” Rather than “pandering to the public&#x27;s taste for cheap shund (trash) plays, he sought to secure goodwill of the East Side’s intelligentsia with literature and increasingly incorporated the concepts of “true art” and “serious drama” into their public image.” Professional companies soon developed and flourished, so that between 1890 and 1940, there were over 200 Yiddish theaters or touring Yiddish theatre troupes in the United States. At many times, a dozen Yiddish theatre groups existed in New York City alone, with the Yiddish Theater District, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Jewish Rialto&quot;, centered on Second Avenue in what is now the East Village, but was then considered part of the Jewish Lower East Side, which often rivaled Broadway in scale and quality. At the time the U.S. entered World War I, there were 22 Yiddish theaters and two Yiddish vaudeville houses in New York City alone. Original plays, musicals, and even translations of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas were performed, both in the United States and Eastern Europe during this period.

Yiddish theatre is said to have two artistic golden ages, the first in the realistic plays produced in New York City in the late 19th century, and the second in the political and artistic plays written and performed in Russia and New York in the 1920s. Professional Yiddish theatre in New York began in 1886 with a troupe founded by Zigmund Mogulesko. At the time of Goldfaden&#x27;s funeral in 1908, the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The dense Jewish population on the lower east side of Manhattan shows in its appreciation of its own humble Yiddish poetry and the drama much the same spirit that controlled the rough audiences of the Elizabethan theatre. There, as in the London of the sixteenth century, is a veritable intellectual renascence.&quot;

Jacob Dinezon quipped: &quot;The still young Yiddish theatre that went to America did not recognize its father just three or four years later, nor would it obey or come when called.&quot; Responding in a letter to Dinezon, Goldfaden wrote: &quot;I do not have any complaints about the American Yiddish theatre not recognizing its father... it is not rare that children do not recognize their parents; or even that the parents cannot travel the road their children have gone. But I do have complaints, though I do not know to whom, that my dear Jewish child is growing up to be a coarse, un-Jewish, insolent boor, and I expect that some day I will be cursed for that very thing that I brought into the world... Here in America ... it has thrown all shame aside and not only is it not learning anything, it has forgotten whatever good it used to know.”&quot;

“In February 1902, Jewish builder and philanthropist Harry Fischel bought a piece of land of about 10,000 square feet, at the south corner of Grand and Chrystie Streets with the intention to erect on the site a theatre for Yiddish performances.” At the time of the opening of the Grand Theatre in New York (1903), New York&#x27;s first purpose-built Yiddish theater, the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted: &quot;That the Yiddish population is composed of confirmed theatregoers has been evident for a long time, and for many years at least three theatres, which had served their day of usefulness for the English dramas, have been pressed into service, providing amusement for the people of the Ghetto.&quot;

In fact, this was a tremendous understatement of what was going on in Yiddish theatre at the time. Around the same time, Lincoln Steffens wrote that the theatre being played at the time in Yiddish outshone what was being played in English. Yiddish New York theatregoers were familiar with the plays of Ibsen, Tolstoy, and even Shaw long before these works played on Broadway, and the high calibre of Yiddish language acting became clear as Yiddish actors began to cross over to Broadway, first with Jacob Adler&#x27;s &quot;tour de force&quot; performance as Shylock in a 1903 production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, but also with performers such as Bertha Kalich, who moved back and forth between the city&#x27;s leading Yiddish-language and English-language stages.

Nina Warnke wrote: &quot;In his memoirs, A. Mukdoni summed up the ambivalent feelings Russian Jewish intellectuals had about the influx of American plays and players onto their soil on the eve of the war: &#x27;The American repertoire—be it the good or bad one—and the American actors—be they the good or bad ones—made us realize that the Yiddish theatre is really in America and that here in Poland and Russia the Yiddish theatre lives off the fallen crumbs that it collects under the rich American table.&#x27;
&quot;Mukdoyni was certainly correct in realizing that the center of Yiddish theatrical production was in New York, and that Poland was turning into its cultural colony. This theatrical expansion eastward, which had begun slowly in the 1890s because of the great need in Eastern Europe to fill the vacuum of repertoire, turned into a conscious American export item during the 1910S. At that time, the immigrant community in New York as a whole, and the Yiddish theatre in particular, had matured, and they were confident enough of their power and unique status to begin to actively seek acknowledgement, accolades, and financial gain beyond the local and regional spheres. The war would only briefly interrupt this emerging trend. What Clara Young was one of the first to discover, actors such as Molly Picon and Ludwig Satz would realize during the interwar period: Poland offered not only a lucrative market for American Yiddish actors, but also an environment where up-and-coming performers could more easily achieve a career breakthrough than in New York. In the early years of immigration, Eastern Europe had served as a necessary recruitment pool to feed the American Yiddish theatre with new stage talent; shortly before World War I, it began to provide new audiences and marketing possibilities for the creative energies that had gathered in New York.&quot;

Some of the most important Yiddish playwrights of the first era included: Jacob Gordin (1853–1909), known for plays such as &quot;The Yiddish King Lear&quot; and for his translations and adaptations of Tolstoy, Solomon Libin (1872–1955), David Pinski (1872–1959), and Leon Kobrin (1872–1946).

This first golden age of Yiddish drama in America ended when the period from 1905 to 1908 brought half a million new Jewish immigrants to New York. Once again, as in the 1880s, the largest audience for Yiddish theatre was for lighter fare. The Adlers and Keni Liptzin hung on doing classic theatre, but Boris and Bessie Thomashefsky returned to the earlier style, making a fortune off of what the Adlers despised as &quot;shund&quot; (&quot;trash&quot;) theatre. Plays like Joseph Lateiner&#x27;s &quot;The Jewish Heart&quot; succeeded at this time, while Gordin&#x27;s late plays like &quot;Dementia Americana&quot; (1909) were initially commercial failures. It would be 1911 before the trend was reversed, with Adler&#x27;s commercially successful production of Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Living Corpse&quot; (also known as &quot;Redemption&quot;), translated into Yiddish by Kobrin. Both the more and the less serious Yiddish theatre persisted. As Lulla Rosenfeld writes, &quot;Art and &quot;shund&quot; alike would find their audience.&quot;

The Yiddish theatre continued to have its ups and downs. In 1918, Isaac Goldberg could look around himself and reasonably write that, &quot;...the Yiddish stage, despite the fact that it has produced its greatest dramatists only yesterday&quot;... is already, despite its financial successes, next door to extinction.&quot; As it happens, it was on the dawn of a second era of greatness: a 1925 &quot;New York Times&quot; article asserts that &quot;the Yiddish theater has been thoroughly Americanized... it is now a stable American institution and no longer dependent on immigration from Eastern Europe. People who can neither speak nor write Yiddish attend Yiddish stage performances and pay Broadway prices on Second Avenue.&quot; This is attributed to the fact that Yiddish theatre is &quot;only one of... [the] expressions&quot; of a New York Jewish cultural life &quot;in full flower&quot;.

Famous plays of this second golden era were &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; (1919), by S. Ansky, considered a revolutionary play in both Yiddish and mainstream theatre. It has been translated into many languages and performed thousands of times all over the world, on stage and on television; there have been several movies. It is now regarded as the crown jewel of the Jewish theatre. Operas, ballets, symphonic suites and other musical compositions have been based on The Dybbuk. In earlier years it was considered so significant that parodies about The Dybbuk were written and performed in Europe and the United States.

After the rising popularity of Yiddish theatre in the Americas, shows such as &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, created by Joseph Stein and Sheldon Harnick, brought the tenets of Yiddish theatre to the Broadway stage.

An-sky wrote a number of other plays, four of which are included in his &quot;Gezamelte shriften&quot;, long out of print. One (“Day and Night”) is, like &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, a Hasidic Gothic story. The other three plays have revolutionary themes, and were originally written in Russian: “Father and Son.” “In a Conspiratorial Apartment,” and “The Grandfather.” All four have recently been republished in a bilingual Yiddish-English edition.

Also notable are &quot;The Golem&quot; by H. Leivick (1888–1962), as well as the plays of Sholem Aleichem.

Yiddish theatre after the Second World War was revived with the writing and performance of &quot;The Warsaw Ghetto&quot;.

Many ground-breaking performers were Jewish-American individuals; Ben Furnish in his work &quot;Nostalgia in Jewish-American Theatre and film, 1979-2004&quot; notes that Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe were both of Jewish-American descent.

Several of America&#x27;s most influential 20th-century acting teachers, such as Stella Adler (daughter of Jacob and Sara Adler and sister of actor Luther Adler) and Lee Strasberg, had their first tastes of theatre in Yiddish. Though some of the methods developed by them and other members of the Group Theatre were reactions to the often melodramatic and larger-than-life style of Yiddish theatre, this style nonetheless informed their theories and left its stamp on them. Yiddish theatre was also highly influential on what is still known as Jewish humor.

===Argentina===
Buenos Aires, Argentina figured prominently in Yiddish theatre between the wars. While pre-war Yiddish theatre in Argentina had bordered on burlesque, shortly after World War I Thomashefsky and others brought their companies to Buenos Aires for the off-season when New York theaters were closed for the summer (the Argentine winter). According to Michael Terry, Buenos Aires experienced a &quot;golden age&quot; of Yiddish theatre in the 1930s and 1950s, becoming &quot;the second city of the world history of Yiddish theater.&quot; Actors such as Samuel Gold­en­berg, Jacob Ben-Ami, Maurice Schwartz, and Joseph Buloff appeared to sell out crowds. Some cafes also presented Yiddish vaudeville numbers, with actors such as Jevel Katz, Jennie Goldstein, and Moyshe Oysher. To reach additional audiences they also traveled to other Argentinean cities, such as Rosario, Córdoba, Moisesville and Basabilbaso. Sometimes they brought Yiddish translations of other plays as in 1949 when Joseph Buloff played in &quot;Death of a Salesman/Toyt fun a seylsman,&quot; at the Soleil Theatre. This was the first time that the Argentinean public saw an Arthur Miller’s play.

==Yiddish theatre in Sweden==
After the war Yiddish theater enjoyed great popularity in Sweden and all the great stars performed there. Since 2000, Yiddish has been recognized in Sweden as an official minority language.

==Post-Holocaust Yiddish theatre==
Like the rest of Yiddish-language culture, Yiddish theatre was devastated by the Holocaust. Most of the world&#x27;s Yiddish-speakers were killed and many theatres were destroyed. Many of the surviving Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazim emigrated to Israel, where many assimilated into the emerging Hebrew-language culture, since Yiddish was looked down upon and Zionists promoted Hebrew as a language of Jewish unity. In Soviet Union, the Moscow State Jewish Theatre continued to perform until 1948, when it was shut down.

Although its glory days have passed, Yiddish theatre companies still perform in various Jewish communities. The Folksbiene (People&#x27;s Theatre) company in New York City is still active 107 years after it was founded. New Yiddish Rep, founded in New York City in 2007, produces Yiddish shows for a younger audience than the senior-citizen oriented Folksbiene. The Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre of Montreal, Quebec, Canada has been active since 1958.

In Melbourne, Australia, the Kadimah Jewish Cultural Centre and Library, home for Yiddish language and theatre, has been operating for over 110 years. The Kadimah Yiddish Theatre has presented new plays in Yiddish as well as new interpretations of Yiddish classical plays and music. The Kadimah also offers its audience a large library of on-demand digital content.

The Ester Rachel and Ida Kaminska Jewish Theater in Warsaw, Poland and the State Jewish Theater in Bucharest, Romania also continue to perform plays in Yiddish, with simultaneous translations into Polish and Romanian respectively. Although Yiddish theatre never truly caught on in the state of Israel, the Yiddishpiel Theatre company (founded in 1987) is still producing and performing new plays in Tel-Aviv. The longest-running Yiddish production in Israel, which was also one of the few commercial Yiddish theatrical successes post Holocaust, was Pesach Burstein&#x27;s production of Itzik Manger&#x27;s &quot;Songs of the Megillah&quot; (Yiddish: Megille Lider). It also released on Broadway in 1968 to favourable reviews as &quot;Megilla of Itzik Manger&quot;. The career of the Burstein troupe documented in the 2000 documentary film &quot;The Komediant&quot;. Opera singer and actor David Serero is bringing Yiddish theatre, adapted in English, back to the Lower East Side of New York, with plays such as the Yiddish King Lear.

In 2019, a Yiddish production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (&quot;Fidler Afn Dakh&quot;) by Folksbiene opened at Stage 42, one of the largest off-Broadway theaters. It had been a hit in 2018 at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in downtown Manhattan.

==In popular culture==
The 1987 musical &quot;On Second Avenue&quot; is an off-Broadway musical and looks back at Yiddish theatre on New York&#x27;s Second Avenue. It had a successful revival in 2005, with a cast led by Mike Burstyn, and was nominated for two Drama Desk Awards.

The author of &quot;Nostalgia in Jewish-American Theatre and Film, 1979-2004&quot; Ben Furnish produces examples of modern playwrights that produce work consistent with the principles and tenets of Yiddish theatre, such as Eleanor Reissa, Miriam Shmuelevitch-Hoffman, and David Pinski. While these are current producers and writers, the themes within the productions remain similar to those of classic Jewish works over the years.

One of Alan Menken&#x27;s first musicals, the c.1974 &quot;Dear Worthy Editor&quot;, was based on the letters-to-the-editor of Jewish-American newspaper Jewish Daily Forward, featuring the struggles of Eastern-European Jews from the turn of the century as they tried to assimilate while hold onto their culture.

<text>Kenn Thomas (June 12, 1958 – September 22, 2023) was a conspiracy writer, archivist, and editor and publisher of &quot;Steamshovel Press&quot;, a parapolitical conspiracy magazine.

Thomas, who was born in St. Louis, Missouri, wrote over a dozen books on various conspiracy topics. These included &quot;NASA, Nazis &amp; JFK&quot;; &quot;Maury Island UFO&quot;, about the possibility that Fred Crisman was connected to the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and &quot;The Octopus: Secret Government and the Death of Danny Casolaro&quot;, about the Inslaw affair. In 2004, Feral House published a new edition of &quot;The Octopus&quot;, extending the suggestion of connections to the post-September 11 attacks world and al-Qaeda. Feral House published a new edition of &quot;Maury Island UFO&quot; in 2011 as &quot;JFK &amp; UFO: Military-Industrial Conspiracy and Cover-Up from Maury Island to Dallas.&quot;

Thomas called his research interest &quot;parapolitics&quot;, the study of conspiracies of all colors—from alien abductions and the Illuminati, to the John F. Kennedy assassination and the September 11, 2001 attacks. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called his work &quot;on the cutting edge&quot; of conspiracy. His name became a by-word for a conspiracy theorist, enough so that baseball was described in print as involving &quot;enough fishy behavior to keep Kenn Thomas swarming for years.&quot;

Thomas appeared at Conspiracy Con in 2003 and 2007.

<text>Daniel Charles Kurtzer (born June 1949) is an American former diplomat. He served as U.S. ambassador to Egypt during the term of President Bill Clinton, and was the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 during the term of President George W Bush.

==Biography==
Daniel Charles Kurtzer was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey to Nathan and Sylvia Kurtzer. He received his PhD from Columbia University, and served as the dean of his alma mater, Yeshiva College.

==Family==
Daniel Kurtzer is married to Sheila Kurtzer and has three children and eight grandchildren. One of his sons is the American Jewish public intellectual Yehuda Kurtzer.

==Publications==
Kurtzer is the co-author of Negotiating Arab-Israeli Peace: American Leadership in the middle east; co-author of The Peace Puzzle: America&#x27;s quest for Arab Israeli peace, 1989–2011; and editor of Pathways To Peace: America and The Arab-Israeli Conflict. He is also a frequent contributor of academic articles and opinion pieces.

==Diplomatic career==
Kurtzer joined the United States Department of State and was serving as a junior officer at the American Embassy in Cairo when Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981. He served in Israel between the years of 1982 and 1986, then became Deputy Director of the State Department&#x27;s Egypt desk in Washington, D.C. He later served on the Policy Planning Staff, as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, and as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research. When asked why he was drawn to the Middle East, he later replied: &quot;The work never seems to be finished in this region. It is not a place where tuxedos and cocktail parties characterize diplomacy.&quot;

Kurtzer joined the staff of Secretary of State James Baker. He helped write Baker&#x27;s noteworthy speech to American Israel Public Affairs Committee in May 1989. The speech was originally drafted by Harvey Sicherman, who used uncontroversial pro-Israel language in his text. Kurtzer&#x27;s revisions included an attention-getting line that encouraged Israel and its supporters to abandon the Greater Israel idea. According to Aaron David Miller, he and Kurtzer wrote short memos for Baker on issues at hand, rather than longer, strategic papers.

Kurtzer was also part of the Clinton administration&#x27;s team of advisers on the Arab–Israeli peace process. According to Miller, Kurtzer left in 1994 because he &quot;felt shut out by&quot; the Special Middle East Envoy, Dennis Ross.

In 2006, he retired from the State Department and the U.S. Foreign Service with the rank of Career-Minister and assumed a chair in Middle East policy studies at the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. He co-chaired, with Scott Lasensky, the Study Group on Arab-Israeli Peacemaking, a project supported by the United States Institute of Peace. They published their recommendations in a 2008 book.

In 2007, Kurtzer served as the commissioner of the Israel Baseball League, a league discontinued after a single season.

He endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s successful candidacy for the presidency. Kurtzer, James Steinberg, and Dennis Ross were among the principal authors of Barack Obama&#x27;s address on the Middle East to AIPAC in June 2008, which was viewed as the Democratic nominee&#x27;s most expansive on international affairs.

<text>Incredible Edibles was a toy sold by Mattel from 1967 to 1968. It was a series of circular metal molds into which Gobble-Degoop, a gelatin based gel, was squeezed into. The form was then placed in the unit and baked into a rubbery soft candy in the shape of worms, insects, and flowers among others, coming in six flavors: licorice, mint, butterscotch, cherry, root beer and cinnamon. Tutti Fruitti, banana and raspberry were offered in refills and accessory kits. 

In 1968 Kooky Kakes was introduced to bake small cakes and decorate them with arms, legs, and faces using Gobble-Degoop and cake mixes. Other accessories could be purchased on blister cards as well as a few additional mold sets.

A Super Incredible Edibles was offered which combines both separate sets into one large set. 
The &quot;Incredible Edibles&quot; formula was created by chemist Don Lusk.

<doc id="1199875" wikidata="Q475045" url="?curid=1199875" title="Helen Coonan">
<text>Helen Lloyd Coonan (born 29 October 1947) is a former Australian politician who was a Senator for New South Wales from 1996 to 2011, representing the Liberal Party. She was a minister in the Howard government, serving as Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer from 2001 to 2004 and then as Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts from 2004 to 2007.

==Early life==

Coonan was born in Mangoplah, New South Wales, and attended the Mount Erin convent Catholic boarding school in Wagga Wagga. She later attended the University of Sydney, where she gained a law degree. She was a barrister and solicitor before entering politics. She was chair of the board of governors of the Law Foundation of New South Wales (1991–92). 

==Howard government (1996–2007)==
In 1996, Coonan was elected to the federal Senate as a Liberal senator for New South Wales. She was re-elected in 2001 and appointed Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (2001–04), making her the first woman to hold an Australian Treasury portfolio since Federation.

As Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Coonan appointed David R Vos as the first Inspector-General of Taxation during August 2003; following from the passage of the Inspector-General of Taxation Bill 2002 and providing an adviser to government in the interests of taxpayers.

===Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts===

Coonan was appointed Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, with a seat in the Cabinet, in July 2004. Her portfolio was responsible for overseeing the Australian broadcasting and telecommunications industries as well as the ICT sector and Australia Post. Coonan was also the senior minister responsible for the arts. She became Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate in January 2006, and was the first female in the Coalition Leadership team remaining in that role until the coalition was defeated at the polls on 24 November 2007.

===Digital television===

In July 2004, Australia was in a transitional phase: digital television was broadcast in parallel to the old analogue television signals. The stated plan was full handover to digital by 2008 and shutdown of all analogue television broadcast.

In September 2005, Coonan announced a review of the digital television situation. It was noted that the government had spent $1 billion supporting the change from analogue TV to digital TV. The plan to switch off analogue TV by 2008 in metropolitan areas and by 2011 in regional markets was regarded as unlikely to be workable because the take-up of digital receivers had been poor.

The minister supervised the creation of Digital Australia, a new federally funded government body for coordinating the transition to digital television. Andrew Townend (former COO of Digital UK) was appointed executive director in 2007.

===Digital radio===

In October 2005, Coonan released a plan for a staged rollout of Digital Audio Broadcasting using the Eureka-147 technology, starting in metropolitan areas. There was no plan to phase out analogue radio, but a 6-year moratorium on new broadcasting services band licenses was announced.

===Media ownership===

Coonan was instrumental in promoting legislative changes to the cross-media and foreign ownership laws in the &quot;Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2006&quot;. The changes relaxed restrictions against cross-media ownership or control by a single company.

===Internet filtering===

As far back as December 2004, Coonan was under pressure from the religious conservative lobby, in particular Senator Brian Harradine.

In 1999 the government introduced measures to counter the growing problem of offensive material on the Net when it introduced a comprehensive regulatory scheme which banned X-rated and restricted classification, or RC, material. As part of the program, the government also established NetAlert—which Senator Harradine is well aware of—to help children and families use and enjoy the Internet in a safe and responsible way.
Her answer demonstrated that mandatory filtering was under consideration.

Senator Harradine asked about mandatory filtering systems. Under the industry code of practice introduced by the government, all Australian Internet service providers are required to provide content filters for their customers at cost price or below. These tools allow parents to actively control the access their children have to the Internet from the family computer and to have some degree of confidence about the safety of their children online.
Coonan also announced in August 2007 a $189 million package for the NetAlert programme. NetAlert is an ISP level Internet content filtering system designed to filter the Internet for &quot;safe&quot; use in Australia. It represented a change from her 2006 policy to allow the ISP to remain a neutral carrier and encourage parents to install filters on their home PCs, commenting at the time that &quot;PC-based filtering remains the most effective way of protecting children from offensive Internet content, as well as other threats that are not addressed by Labor&#x27;s ISP-filtering proposals.&quot; Tom Wood, a 16-year-old schoolboy from Melbourne, took only 30 minutes to find a way to bypass the expensive filtering system. An additional filter was made available shortly after, which Wood cracked within 40 minutes.

==Opposition (2007–11)==
Following the Liberal/National Coalition&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 federal election and Brendan Nelson&#x27;s election as Leader of the Liberal Party, Coonan was replaced as Deputy Leader of Coalition in the Senate by Senator Eric Abetz. She became the Shadow Minister for Human Services, shadowing the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Human Services, Senator Joe Ludwig. When Malcolm Turnbull defeated Brendan Nelson in a leadership ballot in September 2008, Coonan was appointed Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate and was elevated to the prestigious position of Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. She was the first woman to shadow the portfolio. Following Deputy Leader Julie Bishop&#x27;s resignation from the Shadow Treasury portfolio in February 2009, Coonan was moved into Finance, Competition Policy and Deregulation, which had been vacated by Joe Hockey, who picked up the Shadow Treasury role. With the increased responsibility of Finance, Coonan relinquished her position of Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate to Opposition Whip, Senator Stephen Parry.

On 18 August 2011, Coonan informed the Senate in a speech that she would resign on 22 August.

==Post-parliamentary career==

Coonan appointed as a non-executive director of gaming company Crown Limited in 2011. She is also a member of the advisory council of investment bank J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., a trustee of the Sydney Opera House Trust, chair of the Conservation Council of the Opera House Trust, co-chair of GRACosway and a non-executive director of Obesity Australia Limited. On 1 November 2018 she commenced her role as chair of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, while in July 2019 she took over as chair of the Minerals Council of Australia.

Coonan was a regular presenter on &quot;The Cabinet&quot; on Sky News Australia.

<doc id="1199882" wikidata="Q5183947" url="?curid=1199882" title="Thingmaker">
<text>Thingmaker, also called Creepy Crawlers, is an activity toy made by Mattel, beginning in 1964. The toy consists of a series of die-cast metal molds resembling various bug-like creatures, into which is poured a liquid chemical substance called &quot;Plasti-Goop&quot;, which comes in assorted colours. The mould is then heated to about in an open-face electric hot plate oven. The Plasti-Goop is cured by the heat, and when cooled forms semi-solid, rubbery replicas which can be removed from the mould.

== Concept ==

The concept of the Thingmaker was introduced in 1963, as part of Mattel&#x27;s Vac-U-Maker set. This omnibus toy combined the new moulds and Plasti-Goop technology with the existing Vac-U-Form machine, a vacuum forming toy, which molded simple sculptures by heating thin sheets of plastic, then using a vacuum pump to form the softened plastic over hard plastic forms. Following this introduction period, the Thingmaker portion was spun off as a separate set, and launched as the &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot; line.

Mattel packaged molds from various sets to be sold separately, and also combined molds into larger omnibus editions, encompassing several themes into one set, under names such as &quot;Triple Thingmaker&quot;, &quot;Super Thingmaker&quot; and &quot;Every Thingmaker&quot;. Mattel marketed numerous Thingmaker sets as follow-ups to the original &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot; throughout the 1960s, using various themes aimed at both boys and girls, as well as exclusive single mould sets, including Superman and Tarzan, and original concepts including &quot;Squirtles&quot; and &quot;Gangly Danglies&quot;.

==Varieties of Thingmaker mould sets==

* Giant Creepy Crawlers (1965): This set featured nine moulds (as did the original &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot;), but these new moulds featured just one giant creature apiece.
* Fighting Men (1965): This set of six moulds could be used to create mini soldier figures, using an innovative two-part mould to give the Fighting Men a front and a back. The set also included pieces of wire to place in the figure, making it bendable with the bottom wire protrusions being able to stand on a styrofoam base. Other moulds in the set created weaponry and equipment for the Fighting Men to carry into battle.
* Creeple Peeple (1965): This five-mould set formed strange heads, arms and feet. When assembled onto a pencil, they formed weird, Troll-like creatures.
* Fun Flowers (1966): Seven moulds full of different styles and shapes of flowers and leaves, for use in decorating and design.
* Fright Factory (1966): Five of this set&#x27;s seven moulds were dedicated to creepy disguises, making pieces such as fake scars, snaggled teeth, or a third eye for one&#x27;s forehead. Another mould (with a special insert) made a shrunken head, and the last made a dangly skeleton that one built from parts.
* Incredible Edibles (1967) : A Thingmaker that made edible pieces. It used a special goop called &quot;Gobble De-goop&quot; which was placed in molds and cooked like regular Plasti-Goop.
* Picadoos (1967): A Thingmaker for artists. This one featured moulds with 10x10-space numbered grids. By carefully placing coloured Plasti-Goop in the grid, one could create decorative artwork in either beads, mosaic tile, or cross-stitch varieties.
* Mini-Dragons (1967): The eight moulds in this set formed wings, horns, claws, tails, and other body parts, which could be combined into various fantasy creatures.
* Eeeeks! (1968): In the same vein as Mini-Dragons, this set of eight moulds formed several varieties of mix-and-match legs, bodies, heads, wings, antennae, etc., to create large, bizarre insects.
* Zoofie-Goofies (1968): Seven moulds form heads, bodies and feet of various animals, from cats and dogs to elephants and lions.
* Hot Wheels Factory (1969): Moulds made two piece bodies that fit together with wheels embedded into the bottom mould so you could make your own Hot Wheels cars. 
* DollyMaker (1969): Five two-sided moulds are used to create two styles of little dolls, and a wardrobe of late &#x27;60s fashions and accessories for them.
* Super Cartoon Maker (1969): A licensed Thingmaker, the eight moulds in this set form replicas of Charles Schulz&#x27;s Peanuts characters, such as Snoopy, Charlie Brown and Lucy.
* Jillions of Jewels (1970): The last of the classic Mattel Thingmakers. The set had five moulds, but instead of the liquid Plasti-Goop, these formed solid plastic &quot;gemstones&quot; and jewelry frames from two kinds of powdered &quot;Jewel Dust&quot; compounds.

In 1973 the newly created Consumer Product Safety Commission took over the regulation of toys from the Food and Drug Administration. New safety regulations were issued concerning toys that used heat. According to Peter Davis, product safety manager for Mattel, &quot;Although the Thing-Maker (which involved dropping plastic into heated molds) was heralded by educators as a terrific educational toy, it was discontinued because it used heat.&quot;

In 1978 Mattel released an updated (and safer) model of their &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot; toy. Called the &quot;Thingmaker II&quot;, this version used a very differently formulated Plasti-Goop, and used plastic moulds, into which was poured the heated Plasti-Goop. In this set one heated the Plasti-Goop and poured it into the green plastic mould(s) to cool; the moulds were not put into the heater, which looked like a small cauldron. The reformulated Plasti-Goop did not work well and the process of making bugs, etc. with these sets was typically slow, taking an hour or so to make a creation. These sets did not sell as well as their predecessors, and the attempted revival was a short-lived one. Only two sets were produced—Creepy Crawlers and Flower Fun.

==ToyMax revival==

After being out of production for more than a decade, the &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot; brand was brought back in 1992 by a New York-based company called ToyMax. With much stricter safety regulations in place, the new version of the Creepy Crawlers set re-introduced the metal moulds and earlier Plasti-Goop-type formulation, but now used a lightbulb-powered &quot;Magic Maker&quot; heater, with a heat-triggered door designed to remain closed until the mould had cooled sufficiently to be handled safely.

The name &quot;Magic Maker&quot;, as well as the new oven design, were borrowed from an earlier 1980s-era toy that melted clear coloured plastic granules to form sun catcher window decorations. Over the next five years new mould designs were released as well as new mould packs. Apparently Mattel, the originator of Creepy Crawlers, had let its trademarks lapse, for many of the original Mattel concepts were revisited, such as &quot;Creeple Peeple&quot;, &quot;Mini-Dragons&quot;, &quot;Eeeks&quot; (ToyMax changed the spelling), and &quot;DollyMaker&quot;. Numerous licenses were also employed, resulting in mould designs featuring such characters as Bugs Bunny, The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Batman, Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Rex, Hamm and the Green Army Men from &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and The Mask. The new formula Plasti-Goop had an array of colours, and several varieties, including

* Glow In the Dark Plasti-Goop
* Scented Glamour-Goop
* Glitter Glamour-Goop
* Stretch Plasti-Goop
* Metallic Plasti-Goop
* Colour Change Plasti-Goop
* Plasti-Steel (Rigid-Goop for use in toy car bodies)
* Eraser Plasti-Goop.

Toward the end of the ToyMax run, the oven was redesigned to incorporate a fold-down hinged door, and required less at-home assembly. Releases of new mould packs became more and more sporadic over time. In 1997, a wave of moulds (and a new oven set) based on the second Jurassic Park film, and an original line of &quot;Mutant Squad&quot; Plasti-Goop-based figures (three of the six planned &quot;Mutants&quot; were never released) heralded the end of another era of &quot;Thingmaking&quot;, and the beginning of a third period of hiatus. In 2001, ToyMax tried again, with both a &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot; and a &quot;DollyMaker&quot; line, but this revival was brief.

==After ToyMax==
After Toymax, a third company, Jakks Pacific, based in California, began producing Creepy Crawlers toys. Though most of the Jakks Pacific line are re-issued mould designs from the extensive ToyMax offerings, they have also marketed new character moulds featuring SpongeBob SquarePants and Hello Kitty. New releases of oven sets and mould packs have been intermittent. Christmas 2006 saw release of three &quot;new&quot; mould designs by Jakks Pacific, though the numbering of these moulds suggests they be previously unreleased designs from the ToyMax era.

In 2007, Jakks Pacific released a Pokémon-themed Creepy Crawlers Oven and Mould Paks, and in late 2008, another Oven Set based on the Star Wars: Clone Wars license was released, again in time for Christmas.

In the Autumn of 2010, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores released a line of exclusive &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot; Activity Toys (produced by Jakks-Pacific) that use injection moulding and hollow, two-sided moulds to create bugs and spiders in solid, wall-crawling and gut-filled &quot;squishable&quot; varieties. Reviews on the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us site indicate numerous problems with the moulds leaking in the Creepy Crawlers injector models.

As of Spring 2012, the once-exclusive Jakks-Pacific &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot; sets and refill accessories were available at other outlets, such as K-Mart and Target.

==Cancelled 3D printer==
In 2016, Mattel announced a new version of the ThingMaker, a 3D printer line. Its release was originally scheduled for Autumn 2016 and later pushed to 2017. When the printer wasn&#x27;t released, Mattel replied to a Twitter comment on November 20, 2017, saying plans for the 3D printer version were under review, and a firm release date was not set and updates would be posted on their website. Since then, the website went offline. In another Twitter reply, on March 28, 2019, it was noted that Mattel had apologized, having discontinued and cancelled the project.

==In other media==
===Television show===
ToyMax developed their own entertainment property based on the &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot; concept, which became a Saturday morning cartoon — the series lasted two seasons (23 episodes, including one unaired episode that later saw release on video) and a line of 12 action figures that each came with a metal mould, with which to make unique accessories for the figures.

===Film adaptation===
In May 2018, it was announced that a film based on &quot;Creepy Crawlers&quot; is in development. The film rights were acquired by Paramount Pictures. It&#x27;s scheduled to be produced by Paramount Players and Original Film. The upcoming film&#x27;s producers include Neal H. Moritz, Marc Gurvitz and Toby Ascher. Stephen Berman, chairman and CEO of JAKKS Pacific, will serve as executive producer.

<text>Michael Lewis Greenwell (born July 18, 1963) is an American former left fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played his entire MLB career with the Boston Red Sox (1985–1996). He played seven games for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan (1997), before retiring. Greenwell was nicknamed &quot;The Gator&quot;. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was fourth in Rookie of the Year voting in 1987. Greenwell was a leading contender for the American League MVP award in 1988, but lost to Jose Canseco, who had the first 40 home run, 40 stolen base season in baseball history. Greenwell hit .325 with 22 home runs and 119 RBIs in 1988, setting career highs in all three categories.

== Early life ==
Greenwell was born in Louisville, Kentucky. When he was five years old, his family relocated to Fort Myers, Florida. He attended North Fort Myers High School, where he played both baseball and football.

==Baseball career==
===Major League Baseball===
Greenwell was drafted in the third round of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft by the Red Sox, and was signed on June 9, 1982. Throughout his Red Sox career, Greenwell suffered under the weight of lofty expectations for a Boston left fielder, as since 1940 the position had been occupied by Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski and Jim Rice — all MVP winners, regular triple crown candidates, and eventual members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Although his play rarely reached the level of his predecessors, he provided a solid and reliable presence in the team&#x27;s lineup for several seasons. Well respected, he also served as the team&#x27;s player representative for a time. Greenwell was runner-up for the 1988 American League MVP Award to Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics; years later, Canseco&#x27;s admission of steroid use led Greenwell to ask, &quot;Where&#x27;s my MVP?&quot;

On September 14, 1988, Greenwell hit for the cycle, becoming the 17th player to do so in Red Sox franchise history. On September 2, 1996, the Red Sox beat the Seattle Mariners 9–8 in 10 innings at the Kingdome, with Greenwell driving in all nine runs for the Sox, a record for most runs driven in by one player accounting for all of that team&#x27;s runs in a single game. He also holds the American League record for most game-winning RBIs in a single season, with 23 in 1988; the game-winning RBI has since been discontinued as an official statistic. Greenwell was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2008.

====Career MLB statistics====
====&quot;The Gator&quot;====
Greenwell received his nickname during spring training in Winter Haven. He had captured an alligator, taped its mouth shut, and put it in Ellis Burks&#x27; locker.

===Nippon Professional Baseball===
Greenwell signed with the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball in 1997. His career in the major leagues heightened expectations from Japanese fans, but he left the team during spring training and returned to the United States; he had suffered a herniated disc when diving for a ball. He did not return to Japan until late April. He played his first game on May 3, and hit an RBI triple in that game despite having missed spring training. However, Greenwell suddenly announced his retirement after appearing in just seven games; he had fractured his right foot with a foul tip, and the injury would have prevented him from playing for at least four weeks.

===Coaching===
In 2001, Greenwell was hired during the offseason as a player-coach for the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; Double-A affiliate in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Greenwell was also the interim hitting coach for the Reds in 2001, filling in when Ken Griffey Sr. was given a medical leave of absence.

==Racing career==

Upon his retirement from baseball, Greenwell began driving late model stock cars at New Smyrna Speedway, winning the 2000 Speedweeks track championship. In May 2006, he made his Craftsman Truck Series debut at Mansfield Motorsports Park for Green Light Racing, starting 20th and finishing 26th. In 2010, Greenwell gave up racing.

===Motorsports career results===
;NASCAR
() (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time. &quot;Italics&quot; – Pole position earned by points standings or practice time. * – Most laps led.)

;Craftsman Truck Series
==Personal life==
Greenwell operates several businesses, including &quot;Big League Builders&quot;, a general construction company. Greenwell owns an ranch in Alva, Florida, which, as a developer and county commissioner himself, he has rezoned in 2023 for land development to include new housing and commercial units. He owned an amusement park in Cape Coral, Florida, called &quot;Mike Greenwell&#x27;s Bat-A-Ball &amp; Family Fun Park&quot;, which opened in February 1992. He recently sold the park, which is now known as Gator Mike&#x27;s.

Greenwell&#x27;s wife Tracy is a nurse, and they have two sons, both of whom Greenwell coached. Bo was drafted as an outfielder in the sixth round of the 2007 MLB Draft; he spent a total of eight years in the minor leagues, in the farm systems of the Cleveland Indians (2007–2013) and the Red Sox (2014). First baseman Garrett started at Santa Fe College in 2011 before transferring to Oral Roberts University in 2013. Greenwell is the uncle of Joey Terdoslavich, who played for the Atlanta Braves (2013–2015).

<text>ToneLoc was a popular war dialing computer program for MS-DOS written in the early to mid-1990s by two programmers known by the pseudonyms Minor Threat (Chris Lamprecht) and Mucho Maas. The name ToneLoc was short for &quot;Tone Locator&quot; and was a word play on the name of the rap artist known as Tone Lōc.

ToneLoc took advantage of the extended return codes available on US Robotics modems (e.g., ATX6) to detect dial tones upon dialing a number and to detect when a human answered the phone in addition to scanning for other modems. Detection of voice numbers sped up the scanning process by disconnecting upon detecting a human instead of timing out waiting for a modem carrier signal. The detection of a dial tone after dialing a number allowed for users to search for poorly secured extenders which could be used to divert calls through.

On April 17, 2005, the source code for &quot;ToneLoc&quot; was released.

==Background==
Ellison was born on 15 June 1954 in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe). His father was of English descent and his mother of Irish descent. He was educated at Trinity College, Perth and the University of Western Australia, where he gained a B.Juris (1977) and LLB (1978). He spent two years as a lawyer with the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia, where he completed his articled clerkship. He was a barrister and solicitor as partner in his own law firm, Williams Ellison, for 13 years 1980–93.

He is known for his conservative and Catholic views, and is a strong constitutional monarchist and a member of the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. He has voted against abortion and euthanasia.

In 2001, he was awarded a Centenary Medal for Service to Society. In 2017, he was named as the Chancellor of The University of Notre Dame Australia.

He is married with three children.

==Political career==
Ellison was elected as Senator for Western Australia in 1993, replacing Peter Durack, and immediately became involved in parliamentary committees and inquiries across a range of portfolios. He chaired the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee from 1993 to 1996, including chairing an inquiry which led to changes in Australia&#x27;s treaty making process.

He entered the Howard ministry as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services and to the Attorney-General in 1997. He was promoted to Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General 1997, Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training 1997-98 and Special Minister of State 1998–2001. He was Minister for Justice and Customs between January 2001 and March 2007.

From March 2007 until the defeat of the Howard government in the 2007 election, Ellison was a member of cabinet as Minister for Human Services, overseeing the service delivery of Government agencies including Centrelink, Medicare and the Child Support Agency. He held the offices of Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, along with Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate from December 2007 to September 2008.

Following the change of Government in November 2007, Senator Ellison was appointed as Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate. In addition, Senator Ellison was the Chair of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.

Senator Ellison is the longest serving Minister for Justice, with the portfolio abolished in 2017.

==Later career==
On 17 September 2008, Ellison announced he would be resigning, stating that he would like to spend more time with his family. However, he did not formally resign until 30 January 2009. The casual vacancy caused by his resignation was filled by Chris Back.

Ellison was announced as chancellor of the University of Notre Dame Australia in 2017, with effect from 1 January 2018. He had previously served as a governor and director. He has additionally served as a director of construction firm Doric (2011–2015), chairman of the North West Tourism Board (2011–2015), and director of the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation (2014–present).

<doc id="1199891" wikidata="Q7747341" url="?curid=1199891" title="The Like Young">
<text>The Like Young was an American indie rock band from Chicago, Illinois, composed of Amanda and Joe Ziemba. The couple had been playing music together since the 1990s in Wolfie, then Busytoby. They formed Like Young in the spring of 2002 and were married in the same year.

Amanda played the drums and Joe played the guitar, bass, and occasionally keyboard; both sang, though Joe—who wrote most of the songs—took the lead more often.

== Early releases ==
Later in 2002, they released their first album, a five-track EP entitled &quot;&quot;Looked Up&quot; Plus Four&quot;, with Kittridge Records. In the spring of 2003, they released their first full-length album, &quot;Art Contest&quot;, on Parasol Records to generally positive reviews.

Their next full-length album, &quot;So Serious&quot;, was released in the summer of 2004 on Parasol Records. Reviews for &quot;So Serious&quot; were more positive than for &quot;Art Contest&quot;, with some reviewers sharply contrasting the two. Tim Sendra of Allmusic wrote that &quot;&quot;Art Contest&quot; was a slab of formulaic punk-pop bereft of inspiration and hooks...&quot;So Serious&quot; makes no radical changes but is about 100 percent better and less cute, more real.&quot;

== &quot;Last Secrets&quot; and breakup ==
Their final album, &quot;Last Secrets&quot;, was released in 2006 on both CD and vinyl by Polyvinyl Records.

On August 27, 2006, the Like Young announced their retirement citing the need to move on and make smart decisions. In the announcement, Joe mentioned that the decision was a happy one. Joe soon returned to music and released &quot;Love at 30&quot; in 2008 as Beaujolais; this record addresses the end of the Ziembas&#x27; marriage. Joe relocated to Los Angeles after 2009&#x27;s &quot;Admirations&quot;.

In June 2011, Joe released a collection of tracks written and recorded for the Like Young from 2002 to 2006. The release, titled &quot;Fifteen Demos,&quot; was released via his Bandcamp page. Of the release, Joe wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m saying goodbye to The Like Young. Only this time, I&#x27;m doing so with a hug and a smile.&quot;

<doc id="1199903" wikidata="Q5982140" url="?curid=1199903" title="Ian Macdonald (Australian politician)">
<text>Ian Douglas Macdonald (born 29 November 1945) is an Australian former politician who served as a Senator for Queensland from 1990 to 2019, representing the Liberal Party. He was Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government (1998–2001) and Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation (2001–2006) in the Howard government. He was defeated at the 2019 federal election, having been the longest-serving incumbent member of parliament for the final years of his career.

== Early life ==
Macdonald was born in Brisbane, Queensland, and was a solicitor before entering politics. He was also a Councillor in the Burdekin Shire Council 1979–90. He was Vice-President of the Liberal Party in Queensland from 1987 to 1990.

== Early political career ==
In 1992, Macdonald was appointed to the Opposition Shadow Ministry under Liberal leader John Hewson as Shadow Minister for Local Government and the Australian Capital Territory. In 1994, following Alexander Downer&#x27;s accession to the party leadership, Macdonald was given the positions of Shadow Minister for Regional Development and Shadow Minister for Infrastructure and continued to serve at these positions under Opposition leader John Howard.

== Howard government ==
Following the election of the Howard government, Macdonald was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment in 1996. In 1998, MacDonald was appointed to the Second Howard Ministry as Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government.

In 2001, Macdonald was appointed Minister for Forestry and Conservation in the Third Howard Ministry. His portfolio was renamed Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation in November 2002. He continued in this position in the Fourth Howard Ministry until January 2006 when he lost his position in a Cabinet reshuffle triggered by the retirement of Robert Hill.

== Return to Opposition ==
Following the defeat of the Howard government in 2007, Macdonald was appointed to the Opposition Shadow Ministry of Brendan Nelson as Shadow Minister Assisting the Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Minister for Northern Australia. On 22 September 2008, following the election of Malcolm Turnbull as Opposition Leader, Macdonald lost his position as Shadow Minister Assisting the Leader of the Opposition but retained the position of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Northern Australia.

In 2009, Macdonald lost his position in the Shadow Cabinet following Tony Abbott&#x27;s accession to the Liberal leadership, but was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Northern and Remote Australia. In 2010, he also took on the position of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for the Defence Force and Defence Support.

== Final years in parliament ==
On 16 September 2013, following the election of the Abbott government, it was announced that despite Tony Abbott&#x27;s stated aim of ministry continuity Macdonald had been dropped from the frontbench. Senator Macdonald described this day as &quot;one of the worst&quot; days in his life.

In June 2014, Macdonald joined Senator Cory Bernardi in expressing opposition to the Government&#x27;s proposed deficit levy, claiming that he did not believe the increase &quot;goes far enough.&quot; He also threatened to cross the floor over the proposed fuel excise hike.

In July 2018, Macdonald was demoted to fourth position on the LNP ticket, from which victory was considered very unlikely. In the 2019 federal election he lost his senate seat, and ceased to be a senator from 1 July 2019.

=== Controversy ===
On 3 November 2011 during debate on carbon tax legislation, Macdonald stated &quot;GetUp! is the Hitler Youth wing of the Greens political movement.&quot; Senator Macdonald stood by his comments when challenged. While he later apologised to the Jewish community for this remark, he did not withdraw the comment in Parliament. He also once likened Stephen Conroy to Joseph Goebbels.

In September 2015 during Senate Question Time, Macdonald made an interjection toward NSW Labor Senator Doug Cameron based on Cameron&#x27;s strong and distinctive Scottish accent. Macdonald interjected &#x27;learn to speak Australian&#x27;. SA Labor Senator Penny Wong interrupted proceedings later to have Macdonald withdraw his comment. Macdonald revised his comment to say &quot;learn to speak Australian, mate&quot;.

On 9 February 2017, Macdonald stated that he was likely to oppose the Federal Government move to abolish the lifetime gold pass, entitling politicians who had been elected prior to 2012 to 10 free business class flights per year. ABC News reported that Macdonald stated in the Liberal Party Room that &quot;it&#x27;s about time someone stood up for politicians entitlements&quot;.

On 30 May 2017, the senator was on ABC Local Radio Darwin discussing the benefits of shifting public servants from Canberra to more regional areas such as Darwin and regional Queensland. He further went on to say that public servants should be sacked if they refuse to &quot;get out of their very privileged lives&quot; in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne, after no public servants volunteered to move.

On 9 April 2019, Macdonald asked if Penny Wong is related to Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo.

==Honours==
Macdonald was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2023 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;significant service to the people and Parliament of Australia, to local government, and to the community of Northern Australia&quot;.

<doc id="1199909" wikidata="Q3786779" url="?curid=1199909" title="Limited voting">
<text>Limited voting (also known as partial block voting) is a voting system in which electors have fewer votes than there are positions available. The positions are awarded to the candidates who receive the most votes. In the special case in which the voter may vote for only one candidate and there are two or more posts, this system is called the single non-transferable vote or sometimes the strictly limited vote.

==Example of limited voting==
The town of Voterville makes up an electoral district. It elects three representatives to the legislature. The voter has only two votes. At the election, the ballot paper appears thus:

In this case the voter has voted for Brian and Beryl Blue. They cannot cast a third although there are three seats being contested. Each vote counts as one towards the total for the candidate voted for.

== Practice and issues ==
Limited Voting frequently enables minority groupings to gain representation – unlike first past the post or bloc voting systems.

For example, in Voterville 54% of electors support the Blue Party while 46% support the Red Party. The Blue Party would win all three seats with bloc voting and also under first past the post assuming an even distribution of support across the town, and the Red Party would win no representation.

With limited voting the Red Party would usually win one seat.

Assuming 20,000 electors in the town cast &quot;two&quot; votes each and the Blue party getting 54 percent of the votes and the Red party getting 46 percent, the results might be:

Thus two parties obtain representation. 

But a minority getting representation (at least one seat) under limited voting is not guaranteed, since a sectional vote may not be effective due to the number of candidates fielded and the manner in which votes are cast for party candidates.

To ensure a minority winning one seat out of three when each voter has two votes and only two parties are in the contest, it is necessary to get the votes of a full two-fifths of the voters. In the above case the Red party had support from just more than two-fifths of the voters. 

In cases where there are more than two parties running candidates and voters cast their two votes along party lines, the smaller of the two largest parties must have 40 percent of the total valid votes, or 40 percent of the valid votes of the largest and second-largest parties combined, to be sure to take a seat, and then might elect both of its candidates. If voters do not cast their votes along party lines or do not cast both votes, the smaller of the two largest parties can take a seat only if its most-popular candidate is more popular than the least-popular candidate of the largest party.

If the largest party runs three candidates hoping to take all the seats, it may suffer from vote splitting and take just one seat. (It could happen that both parties would each run three candidates and suffer vote splitting and then the outcome could be conjectured in countless ways.)

If the larger party runs three candidates and the smaller runs two, it is possible for the larger party to win all three seats. 

But it is also possible for the least-popular of the two parties to win more seats than the other. The Blue Party, even if it is the most-popular party, may win only one of the available seats if it attempts to win all three and overreaches itself. 

Since the Blue party has nearly 60% of the vote, it may be tempted to try to win all three seats. To do this, it must field three candidates. The Red Party, aware of its relative weakness, is likely to choose only to run two and thus not to disperse its vote. (With each voter having two votes, there is no reason to run only one candidate.)

Assuming 20,000 electors in the town cast &quot;two&quot; votes each, the results might thus be:

By fielding three candidates the Blue Party split their vote and lost out, despite having a clear majority of voter support in the town.

As can be seen from this example, limited voting does not always produce proportional representation.

Another way in which the system may fail to achieve fair representation is if the largest party is very well organised and can arrange the distribution of its supporters&#x27; vote for maximum advantage, while other parties are not so well organized. 

In Spain, where limited voting was used for most elections until 1936 and where it is still used today for the Senate, this practice was known as &quot;ir al copo&quot; (from the verb &quot;copar&quot;, &#x27;to fulfill&#x27;). In both 1977 and 1979 Spanish general elections, the Union of the Democratic Centre won all three seats in the constituency of Gran Canaria. 

In this next example, a party first secured a one-party sweep of a district&#x27;s seats and then manipulated the vote so as to methodically sweep the seats again. In the 1880 election for the three Members of Parliament for the English city of Birmingham, electors cast one or two votes.
Liberal candidates filled all three seats, leaving the Conservatives without representation. This is despite the Liberal vote being split among three candidates.
Thus the limited vote did not produce mixed representation. The Conservative party may have had only about 15,000 supporters and the Liberal candidates may have had support from about 31,000 so the unfairness of the result is not as stark as it seems from seeing 29,000 Conservative votes disregarded. (The Conservatives&#x27; voter support in Birmingham was less than the 40 percent threshold for guaranteed representation mentioned above.) 

But due to Limited Voting, it could have been that Conservative candidates received one vote from 29,000 voters and Liberal candidates received at least one vote from all 47,000 voters. Judging the fairness of elections results (and perceiving the portion of voters who saw their choice elected) is much easier when each voter has just one vote. 


Total votes cast = 94,635.

Estimated number of voters who voted = 47,318 (or more)

Eligible electors = 63,398

Turn-out = 74.6 percent 

* Note: Turnout is based on estimated number of voters who voted, calculated by dividing votes cast by two. To the extent that electors did not use both their possible votes (and thus more voted than the number of votes cast divided by two), turnout will be underestimated.

Charles Seymour in &quot;Electoral Reform in England and Wales&quot; explained the reaction of the Liberals of Birmingham after the limited vote was enacted.
The Liberals of Birmingham realized that if they were to retain the third seat, their vote must be divided economically between the three candidates. 
To prevent waste of votes, an organization must be built up which could control absolutely the choice of the elector; and each elector must vote invariably as he was told. The success of the Birmingham organization, which soon became known as the Caucus, was unbroken and no Conservative candidate was returned. It was copied in many other constituencies and inaugurated a new era in the development of party electoral machinery, the effect of which upon the representative system has been profound.
Under single voting in 3-seat district (such as Single non-transferable voting), with the same (likely) voting behavior -- 31,000 Liberal voters and 15,000 Conservative voters -- it seems likely that the Conservatives would have filled one seat if they had run just one candidate. If the Conservative party ran two candidates, it is likely Liberals would win all three seats as under Limited voting.

== Types of Limited Voting ==
An PR expert described the two types of limited voting:

-Limited vote (ordinary form) where each voter has a number of votes equivalent to more than half the seats being filled. An example of this is the Birmingham 1880 election described above. Two parties at most are likely represented, and never more than the number of seats.

-Limited vote (special form) where each voter has a number of votes equivalent to less than half the seats being filled. An example of this occurred In Japan during the US-led Allied occupation. In the first post-war election in 1946: in districts with ten or fewer representatives each voter had two votes; in districts with ten or fewer representatives each voter had three votes in districts with more than ten representatives. In that election, with district magnitude mostly ranging from 6 to 23, many parties (usually 4 to 7 or more) elected representatives in almost every district.

==History and current use==
;Historic
*In Argentina for the Chamber of Deputies elections, between 1912 and 1948, and between 1958 and 1962.
*In Spain for general, provincial and local elections until 1936.
*In Portugal for legislative elections from 1884 to 1895 and from 1901 to 1926. 
*Between 1867 and 1885 in the UK for some House of Commons constituencies.
*In Italy at the end of the nineteenth century.
*In Japan during the US-led Allied occupation in the first post-war election in 1946 permitting two votes per voter in districts with ten or fewer representatives and three votes in districts with more than ten representatives.
*In Estonia, for the Congress of Estonia election in 1990. 
*In Canada in Ontario provincial elections in 1896 and 1900 to elect Toronto MLAs.

;Current
*In Spain since the restoration of democracy (the end of governance by General Franco) to elect senators from/for the mainland (three votes per voter for four seats per province). 
*In the US to elect most municipal offices in Connecticut, many county commissions in Pennsylvania, and some in other states. It has been adopted to resolve voting rights cases in more than 20 municipalities in Alabama and North Carolina, as detailed in Arrington and Ingalls&#x27; 1998 article &quot;The limited vote alternative to affirmative districting&quot; (Political Geography, Volume 17, Number 6, Aug 1998, pp. 701–728). In 2009 a federal judge ordered its use for school board elections in Euclid, Ohio.
*In Gibraltar (10 votes per voter for all 17 seats).

==&#x27;Fixed Ratio&#x27; or closed-list version of Limited Vote==

The electoral system whereby two seats are assigned to the leading party-list and one seat to the second-placed party-list normally has the same result as limited vote with two votes per voter for three seats. It is used for the Senate of Argentina and 96 out of 128 seats for the Senate of Mexico, as well as the Senate of Bolivia until 2005. A similar system was used for the Bolivian Constituent Assembly elections of 2 July 2006.

<text>The Namibia national football team represents Namibia in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Namibia Football Association. They have never qualified for the FIFA World Cup but have made four appearances in the Africa Cup of Nations. The team represents both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF).

==History==
Namibia played its first international under the name South-West Africa on 16 May 1989 at home against neighbouring Angola and lost 1–0. On 23 March 1990, only two days after gaining independence from South Africa, they hosted neighbour Zimbabwe and lost 5–1. On 7 June, they lost a home friendly 2–1 to Mauritius. Namibia&#x27;s next contests were played in Lesotho, where they lost 2–0 to their hosts on 1 August 1992, but gained their first ever draw in a 2–2 tie against the same opposition the very next day. Namibia&#x27;s first win came on 1 July 1994 in a 1–0 victory away over Botswana in a friendly. On 17 May 1998, Namibia played their first match outside of Africa and against non-African opposition, losing 2–1 in a friendly in France against Saudi Arabia.

Namibia has made four appearances in the African Cup of Nations, winning the cup in 1990, then going out in the first round in their first three competitions and going out in the Round of 16 in their fourth competition. In 1998, Namibia lost to Ivory Coast 4–3 and drew Angola 3–3 before losing to South Africa 4–1. In 2008, Namibia lost to Morocco 5–1 and to Ghana 1–0 but drew Guinea 1–1 in their last match. In 2019, they lost all their group games scoring only a single goal. They lost to Morocco 1–0, and suffered the same loss to South Africa before losing to Ivory Coast 4–1. 

The most capped player of the Brave Warriors is defender Denzil with 83 caps while Daniel Lombe is the all-time top goal scorer with 16 goals. He reached this milestone in a 1–1 draw against Cameroon in the AFCON qualifiers at Yaoundé on 24 March 2023.

Namibia reached the Round of 16 for the first time in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, where they lost 3–0 against Angola.

<text>The International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) is a North American sports car racing sanctioning body based in Daytona Beach, Florida, under the jurisdiction of the ACCUS arm of the FIA. It was started by John Bishop, a former executive director of SCCA (Sports Car Club of America), and his wife Peggy in 1969 with help from Bill France Sr. of NASCAR. Beginning in 2014, IMSA is the sanctioning body of the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, the premier series resulting from the merger of Grand-Am Road Racing and the American Le Mans Series. IMSA is owned by NASCAR, as a division of the company.

==History==
===John Bishop and SCCA===
John Bishop, a Sikorsky employee, first became involved in motorsport in the 1950s when he met Dave Allen, a Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) staff member. Allen offered Bishop a management position on the SCCA Contest Board, which Bishop quickly accepted. Bishop moved to Westport, Connecticut shortly thereafter. Bishop&#x27;s duties consisted of defining technical rules and general administration of SCCA competition, as well as providing artwork for many of the club&#x27;s magazines and event programmes. He became well known in the motorsport scene and enjoyed a good relationship with the organization&#x27;s president and Kimberly-Clark heir, James H. Kimberly.

In 1958, things changed for Bishop as the SCCA experienced internal changes. A new executive director position was created, to which each regional executive reported. This position was taken by Hugo Rush, who later became instrumental in Allen&#x27;s departure. Although Bishop&#x27;s relationship with Rush was not good, Bishop gained a vast amount of experience and began to show his qualities as a manager.

Rush would later depart due to his disagreement with the club as it moved to promote professional motor sports. Bishop took his place as executive director and was now responsible for both amateur and professional programs. To ensure a more serious level of competition, he was tasked with rewriting the technical rules for the newly formed Pro Racing program.

The SCCA had now taken the big step up to professional racing. By 1962, the SCCA was tasked with managing major World Championship for Makes rounds, particularly at Daytona, Sebring, Bridgehampton and Watkins Glen. The club was also involved in the US Grand Prix. Bishop helped to create the USRRC (United States Road Racing Championship) series for Group 7 sports cars to recover races that had been taken by rival United States Automobile Club (USAC). Bishop was also instrumental in founding the SCCA Trans-Am series and the SCCA/CASC Can-Am series.

In 1969, the tension and in-fighting caused Bishop to resign.

===Beginnings===

Bill France Sr. was instrumental in the creation of the International Motor Sports Association. France founded NASCAR as a professional oval track series and wanted to do the same for road racing. After discussions with Bishop, IMSA was born and Bishop was given the sole control of the organization (like NASCAR, there was no board of directors). France financed the majority of the organization and owned 75% of the stock; Bishop owned the remaining 25%. The articles of incorporation were filed in Connecticut on June 23, 1969.

The first race to be organized by IMSA was a Formula Vee and Formula Ford event at Pocono Raceway in October 1969. The SCCA threatened the circuit management and asked them to block IMSA from racing there. The event was held, although IMSA had to pay an additional $10,000 in rental fees. The race had an attendance of 328 spectators.

The organization soldiered on despite the small crowds, and another ten races were planned. Bill France, suffering from financial setbacks, brought on new investors to take over part of his stake in the series.

===GT era===
At the end of the 1970 season, Bishop helped to establish the foundations of the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile) &quot;J appendix&quot; for World Championship for Makes sports cars. For the end of the 1970 season, he advertised a new championship for Group 2 and Group 4 cars with equity between competitors.

The &quot;Grand Touring&quot; (GT) season introduced international endurance racing to North America. In , Camel Cigarettes became the new sponsor of the GT series and the sedan series became known as the B.F. Goodrich Radial Challenge. In , the 12 Hours of Sebring joined the IMSA GT Championship&#x27;s schedule. Later that year, the organization gained recognition from the ACCUS and the FIA. IMSA was scheduled to sanction the 1974 24 Hours of Daytona, but the race was cancelled because of the oil crisis.

Bishop did not believe that factory teams would stick with the new series, so he tried to ensure that the rules were not biased in their favor. He was in favor of looking after privateer teams and helping them to become competitive. As European cars began to dominate, a new series was formed in called &quot;All American Grand Touring&quot; (AAGT) to give equal latitude to foreign cars. Turbocharged cars were permitted in .

In the same year, Bishop invited a pair of Jean Rondeau-built Inaltera&#x27;s to compete as &quot;special prototypes&quot;. They became the foundation of the newly formed Grand Touring Prototype (GTP) category in , with separate rules similar to Group C (Bishop was unhappy with the fuel consumption formula of the latter).

In , Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), the organizers of the World Endurance Championship (WEC), attempted to unite the two organizations by scrapping the existing formula and adopting IMSA rules. This did not please Porsche, which was spending vast sums of money on engine development at the time. Porsche responded by boycotting the 24 Hours of Le Mans of that year. FISA responded by abandoning the rule change for the time being.

In , FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre almost made a successful attempt to settle the dispute by announcing that turbochargers and fuel restrictions would be phased out by 1989 (excepting naturally aspirated engines below 3.5 liters). This attempt failed, as did another in 1991, in which with chassis ballast penalties for turbocharged cars rendered them uncompetitive, except at Le Mans.

IMSA continued to have success with its own Camel GT series.

====New ownership====
In 1987, John Bishop had to undergo a heart bypass surgery, forcing him to rethink his priorities. He began to realise that the Camel GT series was in danger of becoming oriented toward the factory-backed teams and less to the privateers as Bishop originally intended. Rules were modified to accommodate the factory teams, which wanted to get into the series, despite Bishop&#x27;s belief that such changes would be unfavorable to the series in the long run, especially if they failed to meet their objectives.

In January 1989, the Bishops sold the company to Mike Cone and Jeff Parker, owners of the IMSA Grand Prix of St. Petersburg. Bishop shortly stepped down as the organisation&#x27;s president in favor of Mark Raffauf, his deputy president and the organisation&#x27;s representative on the ACCUS (Automobile Competition Committee for the United States), an FIA recognised sporting body. Cone and Parker in turn sold the organization to businessman Charles Slater by the early 1990s.

In 1996 Slater sold the organization with previously accumulated debt to Roberto Muller (ex-CEO of Reebok) and Wall Street based portfolio manager for Bill Gates, Andy Evans, who also was an IndyCar owner and owner/driver of the Scandia World Sports Car team. These changes would lead to the departure of many of the executive board members. Evans was responsible for the name change to Professional Sports Car Racing (PSCR).

In 1998 the United States Road Racing Championship was revived as an alternative to Professional Sports Car Racing, involving the Sports Car Club of America and headed by a group of competitors and ex-IMSA personnel, including John Bishop, Bill France Jr., Rob Dyson, Roger Penske, Skip Barber, and Ralph Sanchez. They wanted to keep rules within the United States. When this initially failed, as a result Don Panoz and Barber departed to affiliate themselves with PSCR.

===American Le Mans Series era===
In the spring of 1998, Don Panoz created a partnership with the Automobile Club de L&#x27;Ouest (ACO), the organizers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, to begin a 10-hour race in the spirit of Le Mans, dubbed the Petit Le Mans to be held at Panoz&#x27;s Road Atlanta facility. After the success of the inaugural Petit Le Mans as a part of the 1998 Professional SportsCar Racing Championship season, Panoz announced a new full season championship for 1999, to be known as the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) which adopted the ACO&#x27;s rulebook under PSCR sanction. The new series replaced the Professional Sports Car Racing championship as PSCR&#x27;s headline series.

Under tremendous pressure from team owners and management, Evans sold Professional Sports Car Racing to Don Panoz in 2001, to solidify the American Le Mans Series. Don Panoz renamed the sanctioning organization back to the International Motor Sports Association and was the official sanctioning body of the ALMS, as well as its support series, the Prototype Lites, the Star Mazda series, GT3 Cup Challenge and the Panoz GT Pro series. IMSA became part of Panoz Motorsports Group, which included the ALMS, Elan Motorsports Technology and Mosport, Sebring and Road Atlanta race tracks. Scott Atherton was appointed President of Panoz Motorsports Group and he appointed Tim Mayer to manage IMSA. IMSA&#x27;s main series, the ALMS focused on manufacturer entries along with top privateers with the worldwide prestige of championship greatly increasing.

After the 1999 USRRC season was cancelled halfway through its schedule due to a lack of competitors, a second attempt at a new sports car sanction body known as the Grand American Road Racing Association was created with full support of NASCAR&#x27;s France family and other motorsports notables and had its inaugural season in 2000. Grand-Am struggled early on, but proved to be a formidable competitor to the ALMS in later years with a different philosophy based on lower-tech cars, most notably its prototype category Daytona Prototype, giving larger fields and closer competition. Much like the split between Champ Car and the IRL, this split was seen by many as being detrimental to the sport as a whole.

===Purchase by NASCAR and reunification===
In 2012, Don Panoz sold the Braselton, Georgia-based ALMS to Grand-Am Road Racing, in turn owned directly by NASCAR and helped organize a merger between the ALMS and the Rolex Sports Car Series. In 2013 the unified series was announced as the Tudor United SportsCar Championship (now IMSA SportsCar Championship). The announcement also confirmed that IMSA will manage and sanction the new series, operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of NASCAR.

On September 19, 2019, Scott Atherton announced retirement from his position as the President of the International Motor Sports Association at the end of 2019. He had held that role since the merger of IMSA&#x27;s American Le Mans Series with the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series in 2014. One month following that announcement, then-director of Mazda&#x27;s motorsports program in North America, John Doonan, was confirmed to be Atherton&#x27;s replacement. Ed Bennett, longtime NASCAR executive, was also President and CEO of Grand-Am Road Racing from August 2011 to December 2013 during the merger period and has continued as CEO of the modern era IMSA since January 2014.

At the 2021 Daytona 24 Hours, IMSA and the ACO announced the historic alignment of the technical regulations for sportscar racing, which was further detailed in June of that year, which brought about the convergence of all sportscar regulations between the FIA, IMSA and the ACO.

In January 2022, IMSA bought Historic Sportscar Racing, whose events include the Classic 24 Hours of Daytona, the Classic 12 Hours of Sebring and the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion.

==Circuits==
==Current sanctioned series==
These are the series that are currently sanctioned and managed by the IMSA organization.

=== IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship ===
The WeatherTech SportsCar Championship was created in 2014 through the merger of Grand-Am Road Racing and the American Le Mans Series. It debuted under the name &quot;Tudor United SportsCar Championship&quot; on January 25–26, 2014 at Daytona International Speedway. For the 2016 season title sponsorship changed from Tudor to WeatherTech. This series currently features LMDh, LMP2, and GT3 cars.

=== IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge ===
The IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge is a grand touring and touring car racing series run by the International Motor Sports Association. The Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge was the support series for GRAND-AM&#x27;s premier offering, the Rolex Sports Car Series. In 2014 it became the support series for the United SportsCar Championship series upon the merger of the Rolex Series and the American Le Mans Series. The series branded as the IMSA Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge, with Continental Tire having been title sponsor since the 2010 season until 2018. In 2019 Michelin replaced Continental Tire as supplier and title sponsor. This series uses TCR Touring Cars and GT4 cars.

===IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge===
The IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge is a development series featuring LMP3 and GT4 cars. The series was introduced in 2023 as a replacement for the IMSA Prototype Challenge series. Races in this series are usually run in support of events for the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Events consist of two 45-minute sprint races with no pit stops or driver changes. Unlike its predecessor series, the VP Racing SportsCar Challenge features multi-class racing with prototypes and GTs on track at the same time. As the series is a development series for higher tier series among IMSA&#x27;s championships, drivers are required to hold either a Silver or Bronze categorization from the FIA.

=== Porsche Carrera Cup North America ===

The Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge USA by Yokohama is a one-make series dedicated to the Porsche 911 GT3, similar in concept to the Porsche Carrera Cup, held since 2005. Drivers are allowed to race in two different classes, Platinum and Gold. The entries were allowed in the American Le Mans Series starting in 2009, in the GTC Class. The series became the Porsche Carrera Cup North America beginning in the 2021 season.

=== Ferrari Challenge ===

The Ferrari Challenge is a one-make series dedicated currently to the Ferrari 488, which was previously sanctioned by Grand-Am prior to the merger.

=== Lamborghini Super Trofeo ===

The Lamborghini Super Trofeo is a one-make series dedicated currently to multi-class racing, showcasing both the new Huracán LP 620-2 Super Trofeo and the Gallardo LP 570-4 Super Trofeo that was the exclusive car for the first two seasons of the North America championship in 2013 and 2014. The series debuted in North America under IMSA sanction in 2013.

=== Mazda MX-5 Cup ===

The Mazda MX-5 Cup presented by BFGoodrich Tires is the signature spec series for the Mazda Road to 24.

The MX-5 Cup race cars start as complete MX-5 road cars from the Mazda Hiroshima, Japan factory before being transported to engineering development partner Flis Performance in Daytona Beach, Florida, where they are transformed into a race car.

The series entered a sanctioning agreement with IMSA beginning with the 2021 season.

=== Ford Mustang Challenge ===

In July 27, 2023, Ford and IMSA announced that the 7th Generation Mustang would have its own spec-racing series called Mustang Challenge, IMSA will sanction the championship with the organization of Ford themselves via the Ford Performance Racing School.

=== IMSA HSR Prototype Challenge ===
On October 24, 2023, it was announced that HSR (owned by IMSA since January 2022) and IMSA were forming a new prototype-only series for both LMP3 Gen 1 and Gen 2 cars called the IMSA HSR Prototype Challenge. A minimum 20-car grid was announced as the requirement for standalone races to be held, if not incorporated into races with other prototypes. The six-event calendar will follow HSR&#x27;s usual events, including the Classic 24 Hour at Daytona and the Classic 12 Hour at Sebring.

==Defunct series==
These are the series that were formerly run by the IMSA organization.

=== IMSA GT Championship ===
=== American Le Mans Series ===
=== IMSA IS ===
The &quot;International Sedan Series&quot; was short-lived and the genesis of the &quot;Radial Sedan Series&quot;. It is unclear if the 1969 inaugural IMSA Sedan race held at the Talladega Superspeedway Road Course was designated &quot;International Sedan Series&quot; or not. That being the only race held in 1969 details are sketchy, but over the winter of 1969–70 rules were officially promulgated for this Series. It was initially to be known as the &quot;International 100 Series&quot; as it was intended for sedans up to 100 c.i or 1600 cc., however was revised prior to the start of the 1970 season to include larger engines and presumably the name change to &quot;International Sedan Series&quot;.

The next year, 1971, the Series was revamped and became the &quot;Radial Sedan Series&quot; with the revolutionary innovation of requiring DOT radial tires. New rules allowed for cars over 1.6 L divided between two classes. Class A was for Sedans under 2 L., except for overhead cam engines which were limited to 1.6 L. Class B was for larger engines up to whatever IMSA decided appropriate for the Class which was the AMC Gremlin&#x27;s 232 c.i. for the duration of the &#x27;original&#x27; RS Series.

As an aside, the &quot;Baby Grand&quot; moniker frequently applied to these IMSA Series was just that, a nickname. Around this same time a series that was officially designated &quot;Baby Grand&quot; (better and later known as the Goody&#x27;s Dash Series) was sanctioned by NASCAR and consisted of 4-cylinder cars purpose-built to run NASCAR ovals. A few RS regulars are known to have run both Series with the same car making minimal changes to accommodate the difference in rules. Carson Baird, driving a Dodge Colt, was one of these &#x27;crossover&#x27; competitors.

=== IMSA RS ===
The &quot;IMSA RS Series&quot; (for &quot;radial sedan&quot;) began as the &quot;Baby Grand Series&quot;, in 1971. Originally sponsored by B.F. Goodrich (therefore known as &quot;Goodrich Radial Challenge&quot;) until they dropped sponsorship midway through 1975 (or 1976) and then by Goodyear (becoming the &quot;Goodyear Radial Challenge&quot;), and later as &quot;Champion Spark Plug Challenge&quot;.

The initial race held was in 1969 at Talladega Superspeedway Road Course. Gaston Andrey was first overall in an Alfa Romeo Giulia Super sedan. The Series&#x27; first year was actually 1970 with only two races, the inaugural race was at the newly constructed Summit Point Motorsports Park on Memorial Day weekend; Rasey Feezell was first overall in an Alfa Romeo Giulia TI Super sedan; the second race was held at the Montgomery Speedway, Alabama, Red Farmer won in a specially prepared Datsun 510. Feezell didn&#x27;t fare too well having to drive against the local four-cylinder &quot;beater class&quot; cars brought in to fill out the field, with their protruding wheels rubbing Racey&#x27;s &quot;immaculate&quot; Alfa Romeo. Infuriated, Feezell quit and never ran another IMSA RS race after that.

The idea was to attract racers who did not have the budgets that were required in the GT category as well as an emphasis on compact sedans such as the AMC Gremlin and the Opel Manta. There were two classes from 1970 through 1973: Class A for under two liters and under 1.6 liters with overhead cam and Class B for over 1.6 L with overhead cam and over two liters up to the largest permitted engine being the AMC Gremlin. In 1974 all cars were placed in one class, with the only parity for the smaller engines being free carburetion for under 1.6 liters. Limited preparation was permitted, and since the entrants were meant to be street-driven race cars, the original rules required the retention of headlights, seats, upholstery, window cranks, stock brakes and original springs and radial tires. Only the exhaust systems and shock absorbers were free. Later rules regarding headlights, seats, upholstery, window cranks, original springs, and other stock elements were loosened up somewhat. From the beginning, engine modifications similar to Sports Car Club of America B Sedan were permitted, with the main difference being that over-boring cylinders was not allowed, and stock carburetors being required, but modifications allowed. The series was loosely based on rival SCCA Trans-Am&#x27;s Two-Five Challenge rules.

The series became dominated mostly by Mazda&#x27;s rotary-powered RX-2 and RX-3 prompting IMSA to specify heavier weights than piston-engined cars and prohibited any modifications to the rotors and more importantly to intake and exhaust ports. Datsun also had a fair share of success within the series with cars such as the 510 and 200SX. Many drivers would cut their teeth in this series such as Don Devendorf, of Electramotive fame, Jim Downing, of Kudzu, and Bobby Rahal. The final season was run in 1984 before it was replaced by the IMSA Showroom Stock class the following year, while retaining its sponsor until 1988. As with most now-defunct racing classes, there are revival races run for this category and the SCCA sanctions events for mostly-stock and all-stock cars.
=== American Challenge ===
The &quot;American Challenge&quot; (in full, &quot;Kelly American Challenge&quot;), otherwise abbreviated as &quot;AAC&quot; was a category for US-built cars and throughout the series, it was always run as a support race to the premier GT series. Starting in 1977, the series ran until 1989. In 1992, the premier GTO category was renamed to GTS due to sponsor reasons, and rather than leaving the GTO category redundant, the title was reallocated to the former American Challenge cars. As a result, they would be run alongside GTS cars. This series started the careers of Irv Hoerr, Kenny Irwin Jr., Patty Moise, Clay Young, Lyn St. James and Paul Gentilozzi.
=== IMSA Renault Cup ===
The Renault Cup was a one-make racing series that ran between 1982 and 1985. There was an East Coast (1982–1985) and West Coast series (1983–1985) as well as an overall championship. The series began with the Renault Le Car for two seasons on the East Coast until its discontinuation in the US. The last two seasons, the East Coast Series ran the Renault Encore. The West Coast Series started after the first successful year on the East Coast, but ran the Renault Alliance which had just been introduced.

The genesis of the series was an association of drivers, Associated Road Racers (ARR), founded by Steve Coleman of Raleigh, North Carolina. The association&#x27;s objective was to start an inexpensive but competitive series with large car counts. The main prerequisite requirement was a series that would allow drivers who had regular jobs and a life to compete with at least a chance to win the championship without having to travel coast to coast, as was the case with other similar series such as the VW Bilstein Cup. The preference was to have a roughly ten-race schedule, with each driver&#x27;s best six finishes counting toward the Championship.

ARR&#x27;s members were mostly Showroom Stock racers from the Southeast and Northeast Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) regions. All members put up a bond to ensure they would participate if it came to fruition so that a sanctioning body and a sponsor would be assured success from the start. In the beginning an outline of series rules was drawn up to attract like-minded drivers to join in the effort. Once the association was formed, a final version was to be drafted with all the members&#x27; input. The rules along with the association&#x27;s proposed plan to organize and launch the series, were sent to several manufacturers soliciting sponsorship, including Mazda, Toyota, Nissan, and Renault. All except Renault either rejected the proposal or did not respond.

Renault not only responded, it jumped at the chance, since it was quite familiar with the concept of a one-make series. ARR and Renault negotiated to finalize a format competing with the Le Car R5. Due to classic concerns of track owners and sanctioning bodies, Renault was reluctant to agree to the drivers&#x27; points system. Their counterproposal was to run an East Coast series in lieu of nationwide. Since most of the interested drivers were from the East Coast, and the amount of travel required was somewhat limited, this was accepted by the drivers.

Once Renault was on board, John Bishop, President of IMSA, was approached to sanction the series. He was very skeptical at first. A meeting was held on at Road Atlanta between Bishop, B Clar, the US Competition Director of Renault, and Coleman representing the drivers. Renault offered a major support program and ARR would guarantee a minimum of twenty-five entrants for the first race. Bishop, still skeptical, agreed to sanction the series. Coleman even suggested there might be as many as fifty, if Renault and IMSA didn&#x27;t revise the proposed series rules to a point the majority of drivers would pull out before then. Still skeptical he agreed, convinced by Renault&#x27;s commitment and the driver&#x27;s assurances of a full field for the inaugural race. Exactly one year to the date on April 4, 1982, the inaugural race was held at Road Atlanta. 51 Le Cars started the race.

One notable driver to come from the series was Parker Johnstone; he took runner-up spot on his debut season in 1984 and would virtually dominate the series following that.
=== IMSA Showroom Stock ===
In 1985, IMSA would undergo a major rules reformat while still retaining its sponsor, therefore it was still known by its sponsor&#x27;s moniker. This time, the series was more restricted to current models, that is to say models then currently available for retail sale in dealerships throughout the US. Other than that, the series had rules and race formats that were similar to the RS series, being an endurance series.

At the end of the 1987 season, Champion stepped down as sponsor and was replaced by Firestone Tire and Rubber Company; therefore, the series was renamed &quot;IMSA Firestone Firehawk Endurance Championship&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Firehawk Series&quot;, after the Firehawk performance tire brand. Total prize purses, year-end point funds and manufacturer contingency awards in 1991 amounted up to $1 million. As required by the sponsor, all cars were required to use its own Firehawk SZ or Firehawk SV tires which could be shaved to racing depth, or the all-season Firehawk GTX. Bosch and Kendall Oil were also associate sponsors.

Most of the drivers that competed in the series were amateurs or semi-professional, whilst a few made their living out of competing in the series. Dorsey Schroeder and John Andretti are among the few full-time professional drivers who cut their teeth in the series. Meetings usually attracted over ninety entries and were often televised, the duration of the races varying from one two hour and a half event to one 24 hour race. The series would soldier on until 1998, by then known as &quot;Speedvision Cup&quot;, named for the former motosports-oriented television network.

During the sportscar racing &quot;split&quot; from 1998 until 2013, a rival series from Canada, the Motorola Cup, was sanctioned by the SCCA, with Grand-Am taking over in 2001. This is the other series that led to the modern Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge.

There are three classes, sorted in order from the highest
*Grand Sport Class
**Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Trans Am, Nissan 300ZX (twin-turbo), BMW M3, Ford Thunderbird, Ford Mustang, Porsche 944, Mazda RX-7 (FC3S)
*Sport Class
**Pontiac Sunbird Turbo, Dodge Daytona Turbo II, Honda Civic CRX Si, Volkswagen Corrado
*Touring Class,
**Honda Civic Si, Audi 100 Quattro, Pontiac Grand Am
=== IMSA Bridgestone Supercar Championship ===
IMSA also hosted the Bridgestone Supercar Championship, sponsored by the sister brand of Firestone, Bridgestone, which was for higher-end sports cars such as the Porsche 911 Turbo, Lotus Esprit X180R, Chevrolet Corvette, Mazda RX-7 and Nissan 300ZX and was run between 1991 up until 1995. Usually a televised support race to the GT races, running at 30 minutes, the series attracted some well-known professional drivers such as Hans-Joachim Stuck, Hurley Haywood, Doc Bundy, Elliot Forbes-Robinson, Andy Pilgrim and Paul Newman. with a total prize fund of $555,555 for the 1992 season. All cars had to run on road-going Bridgestone Potenza RE71 tires which were trimmed to semi-racing depth and during a wet race, cars raced on full depth.

The series was not without controversy, mainly for the all-composite Consulier GTP, as it was bordering on a departure from the showroom stock ethos, as well as being criticised for having little common with cars that the general public ever saw on a public road.
The GTP debuted with just four silver Consulier Series II GTP at Lime Rock in 1991, despite having a 2.2 liter turbo with about connected to a five-speed gearbox, weighing at . The car took a pole-to-chequered flag finish, easily outpacing the other more powerful but heavier cars, even if they were piloted by talented and more experienced drivers such as Hurley Haywood in a factory Porsche, Boris Said&#x27;s Callaway Twin Turbo Corvette, and Jim Minnaker in a factory ZR1 Corvette. It was subsequently announced by IMSA that they felt that it was not in the best interests of the series to allow the Consulier to continue with such a massive weight advantage, so as a result they added a weight penalty to the GTP, before its being barred from the series altogether at the end of the season, despite taking a runner up spot.
=== Formula BMW USA ===

The Formula BMW USA series is the North American version of the open-wheel series supported by BMW. All running identical chassis powered by BMW motorcycle engines, the series serves as stepping stone for formula car drivers moving into higher international series. A world championship of all Formula BMW series is run at the end of the year, taking the top drivers from Formula BMW USA and the other similar series elsewhere in the world.

=== Atlantic Championship ===

In June 2008, IMSA began sanction of the Atlantic Championship for two seasons. The series later came under SCCA Pro Racing sanction in 2012.

=== Panoz Racing Series ===
Originally began as Women&#x27;s Global GT Series, formed by Lyn St. James in 1999, the series began as a support race to ALMS for women racers, using the race modified version of the Panoz Esperante series of cars. The series was an invitational affair with forty one drivers are selected out of four hundred applicants to participate in the Women&#x27;s Global GT Series. The grid would usually consists of experienced racers such as former Formula One drivers, Giovanna Amati and Divina Galica, NASCAR&#x27;s Shawna Robinson, and Italian Audi factory team touring car driver Tamara Vidali against talented amateur drivers from varying degrees of professions, such as radio personality, police officer, law student, and racing simulations art designer for Microsoft.

=== Ultra 94 Porsche Cup Challenge Canada by Yokohama ===

In 2011, IMSA created the Ultra 94 Porsche Cup Challenge Canada by Yokohama, which races in support of major Canadian motorsports events including, the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix, the Honda Indy Toronto, the Grand Prix of Mosport and the Grand Prix de Trois-Rivières. The series was replaced by the Porsche Carrera Cup North America in 2021.

=== IMSA Prototype Challenge ===

The Mazda Prototype Lites presented by Cooper Tires Championship was a series featuring two classes of single-seat prototype cars racing simultaneously. Most races were held in support of the United SportsCar Championship; prior to 2014 it was the support series for the American Le Mans Series. The L1 class featured Élan Motorsport Technologies DP02 cars powered by a Mazda MP2 engine, and L2 consists of West Racing WX10 and WR1000 chassis with either a Kawasaki ZX-10R or Suzuki GSX-R1000 engine. Each class had an overall championship, a master&#x27;s championship for drivers at least 40 years of age, and a team championship. In 2017 the series became the IMSA Prototype Challenge presented by Mazda, featuring LMP3 cars and L1 cars re-branded as MPC (Mazda Prototype Challenge). In 2023, the series was replaced by the IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge, which featured LMP3 and GT4 in their respective classes with shorter race distances.

<text>Charles Roderick Kemp (born 21 December 1944) is an Australian politician. He was a Liberal member of the Australian Senate from 1990 to 2008, representing the state of Victoria.

Kemp was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was educated at Melbourne University, where he graduated in commerce. He is the brother of Dr David Kemp, who was a Liberal MP from 1990 to 2004.

Before entering politics, Kemp was Director of the Institute of Public Affairs, a conservative policy body founded by his father, C.D. Kemp. He was Senior Private Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and Minister for Finance, Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, from 1977 to 1982, and Principal Adviser to the Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Peacock, in 1989.

Kemp was elected as a Liberal Senator at the 1990 election and took his seat in July 1990. He was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry from 1992 to 1996, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security in 1996, Assistant Treasurer from 1996 to 2001, and Minister for the Arts and Sport from November 2001 to January 2007.

His brother David was a fellow minister.

On 12 May, Rod Kemp announced he would not contest the November 2007 election, and duly left parliament at the expiration of his term in June 2008.

Kemp was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2020 Australia Day Honours.

<text>TVGoHome was a website which parodied the television listings style of the British magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot;. It was produced fortnightly from 1999 to 2001, and sporadically until April 2003, by Charlie Brooker. The site now exists only in archive form. TVGoHome columns also appeared for a short time in &quot;Loaded&quot; magazine, sometimes edited from their original web version.

The website gained a cult following, partly due to its tie-up with the technology newsletter &quot;Need To Know&quot;, and its use of strong language, surreal imagery and savage satire reminiscent of the work of Chris Morris. Indeed, Morris himself contributed on occasion, under the pseudonym &#x27;Sid Peach&#x27;. Regular targets for ridicule were the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, Mick Hucknall of Simply Red, and the TV presenters Rowland Rivron and Nicky Campbell. TVGoHome&#x27;s most consistent target, however, was fictional. Nathan Barley, an ex-public-school media wannabe living off his parents&#x27; wealth, had his life chronicled in a fly-on-the-wall documentary series (in the TVGoHome universe) entitled simply &#x27;Cunt&#x27;. Detailing Barley&#x27;s comfortable life in the now gentrified area of formerly working class Westbourne Grove in west London, the programme essentially mocked the &quot;new media&quot; scene and its population of self-obsessed, middle-class web designers, DJs and magazine producers, their obsessions with absurd fashions and gadgetry, their inevitably feeble and derivative attempts at creativity, and their tireless efforts to embody the cutting edge of urban cool. A spinoff book of the same title was later released featuring old and new material.

Brooker has cited the increasing absurdity of reality television as one of the main reasons he stopped writing TVGoHome. The ideas for real life shows such as &quot;Touch the Truck&quot;, in which contestants must continually touch a truck for 24 hours in order to win the truck as a prize, were the kind of idea that at one point would only have existed as an absurd satirical creation of Brooker&#x27;s website. Now that they were becoming a reality, Brooker felt it was probably time to stop.

In 2006, Brooker began a regular column in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, featuring new TVGoHome listings.

== Recurring programmes ==
* &quot;Cunt&quot;, a fly-on-the wall series featuring Nathan Barley, a &quot;new media&quot; type kept housed and up to date with the latest pointless technological gadgets through constant parental financial support. Barley is depicted as being of absolutely no value to society, with no morals and even less intelligence, and having many friends (all of whom are exactly like him). On one occasion he attempts to let his girlfriend down over a 6-month period, ultimately ending in his once confident, happy girlfriend being sectioned. He is subject to almost pathological levels of hatred from the writer of the billing of the show.
* &quot;Daily Mail Island&quot;, a reality TV show where several normal people are deposited on an island and not allowed access to any media other than the right-wing, strongly conservative &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper, leading to them becoming progressively more irrational and brutal as the series progresses — for example, tying teenage lovers together with sacks on their heads and beating them, or sealing a teenager caught masturbating into a coffin filled with broken glass and dog faeces and throwing it over a cliff — and their language devolving into rhetorical questions and sarcastic snorts.
* &quot;Get Hen!&quot;, a bizarre interactive programme in which home viewers fire lightguns at a dancing hen inserted into various pieces of film.
* &quot;Mick Hucknall&#x27;s Pink Pancakes&quot;, in which Mick Hucknall of Simply Red fame presses his testicles against various transparent surfaces, including shop windows, glass coffee tables and Chinese riot shields. Briefly succeeded by &quot;Mick Hucknall&#x27;s Spud Tip Challenge&quot;, in which he quite simply balanced a baby new potato on the end of his penis.
* &quot;Ricky&#x27;s Luck&quot;, a drama featuring Ricky Butcher encountering appallingly bad luck in just about everything he does. The title is also likely a play on &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Luck&quot;, a spin-off of the children&#x27;s series &quot;Grange Hill&quot;.
* &quot;Patrick Kielty&#x27;s Streets of Fundom&quot;, where Patrick Kielty performs various completely meaningless actions while roaming the streets of Britain, such as wearing a Viking helmet, climbing onto the back of a man dressed as a cartoon Hitler and then letting off party poppers each time he passes an elderly woman.

==Television==
The TVGoHome format itself, or elements derived from it, have featured within several television comedy and entertainment programmes.

A &quot;TVGoHome&quot; comedy sketch show was produced in 2001, consisting of six half-hour episodes broadcast on E4, later compiled into a smaller number of &#x27;highlights&#x27; shows for broadcast on Channel 4. It was written by Brooker, among others, and directed by Tristram Shapeero, who also directed the controversial &quot;Brass Eye&quot; special on paedophilia. The sketches included new material and skits based on previous TVGH entries.

A spin-off from TVGH was &quot;Unnovations&quot;, based on a parody of the Innovations catalogue; this was turned into a TV sketch/sitcom series, broadcast on UK Play in 2001-02; since that channel&#x27;s demise, it has not been repeated.

A sitcom entitled &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;, based on a character first featured within &quot;TVGoHome&quot; columns, was co-written by Brooker with Chris Morris, and was broadcast in February 2005.

Brooker&#x27;s 2009 Channel 4 TV-themed panel review show &quot;You Have Been Watching&quot; features TVGH-style spoof listings pages in its opening title sequence.

<doc id="1199943" wikidata="Q1377115" url="?curid=1199943" title="Alessandro Striggio">
<text>Alessandro Striggio (c. 1536/1537 – 29 February 1592) was an Italian composer, instrumentalist and diplomat of the Renaissance. He composed numerous madrigals as well as dramatic music, and by combining the two, became the inventor of madrigal comedy. His compositions include the monumental &quot;Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno&quot; for up to 60 voices, rediscovered in 2005 after being lost for 400 years.

His son, also named Alessandro Striggio, wrote the libretto for Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo&quot;.

==Life==
Striggio senior was born in Mantua, evidently to an aristocratic family. Records of his early life are sparse, but he must have gone to Florence as a young man. He began working for Cosimo de&#x27; Medici on 1 March 1559 as a musician, eventually to replace Francesco Corteccia as the principal musician to the Medici court. In 1560 he visited Venice, and produced two books of madrigals in response to the musical styles he encountered there. In 1567 the Medici sent him on a diplomatic mission to England. Throughout the 1560s Striggio composed numerous intermedi for the Medici, for weddings, visits, and other state occasions. In the 1570s he continued to work for the Medici, but there is some evidence he began to travel away from Florence. He had some connection to the Bavarian court in Munich, and may have gone there on more than one occasion (possibly for the performance of his 40-voice motet &quot;Ecce beatam lucem&quot; which he wrote for a royal marriage there). He became friends with Vincenzo Galilei, the father of the astronomer, during the 1570s; whether or not he was a member of the Florentine Camerata is uncertain.

During the 1580s he began an association with the Este court in Ferrara. Ferrara was one of Italy&#x27;s avant-garde centers of musical composition in the 1580s and 1590s, and Striggio composed music in the progressive madrigal style he heard there, evidently commissioned by the Medici. This music is unfortunately lost. In 1586 Striggio moved to Mantua where he remained for the rest of his life, although he retained a close association with the Medici, composing music for them at least as late as 1589.

The late madrigals are not lost. Twenty-eight madrigals from Striggio&#x27;s Late Period, were transcribed from microfilm for a graduate seminar at the University of California at Berkeley (under the tutelage of Dr. Anthony Newcomb in 1974). The full notation (120 pages in score form notebooks in pencil) will be available after August 1, 2024. (Contact Music Chair, David Milnes, at 104 Morrison Hall #1200,Berkeley, CA 94720.) A typed list of first-line poetry titles will be included.

==Works==
Striggio wrote both sacred and secular music, and all his surviving music is vocal, although sometimes with instrumental accompaniment. He published seven books of madrigals, in addition to two versions of his most famous composition, the madrigal comedy &quot;Il cicalamento delle donne al bucato et la caccia...&quot; (&quot;The gossip of the women at the laundry&quot;).

The madrigal comedy, either invented by Striggio or made famous by him, was long considered to be a forerunner of opera, but contemporary musicological scholarship tends to see this as just one of many strands in late 16th-century Italian music which adapt prevailing musical forms to dramatic presentation. In the madrigal comedy, there is no acting: the five individual madrigals in &quot;cicalamento&quot; tell a story, but entirely in words and music. Entertainments such as the madrigal comedy were not far different from other musical forms one could see at a contemporary intermedio.

One of his most impressive works, and one of the most impressive achievements in Renaissance polyphony, is his motet &quot;Ecce beatam lucem&quot; for forty independent voices, which may have been performed in 1568 in Munich. There is some evidence that he may have had the music for either this piece or his 40/60 voice mass, &quot;Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno&quot;, with him on his diplomatic visit to London in 1567, since Thomas Tallis seems to have been inspired and challenged by it, and shortly afterwards wrote his own 40-voice tour-de-force &quot;Spem in alium&quot;, commissioned by Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Unlike the setting by Tallis, Striggio specifically indicates for the voices to be doubled by instruments. In the Bavarian performance in 1568 of Striggio&#x27;s motet the forces included eight flutes, eight violas, eight trombones, harpsichord and bass lute. The motet is a polychoral composition for four choirs, which include sixteen, ten, eight and six voices respectively, all spatially separated.

A work on a yet larger scale, and long reputed to be lost, is Striggio&#x27;s mass composed in 40 parts, and which included a 60-voice setting of the final &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;. The work was recently unearthed by Berkeley musicologist Davitt Moroney and identified as a parody mass, &quot;Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno&quot;, and received its first modern performance at the Royal Albert Hall during the London Proms on 17 July 2007 by the BBC Singers and The Tallis Scholars conducted by Moroney. This work was most likely composed in 1565/6, and carried by Striggio on a journey across Europe in late winter and spring 1567, for performances at Mantua, Munich and Paris. The first commercial recording of the Mass, by the British group I Fagiolini, was released in March 2011, and won a Gramophone Award, and a Diapason D&#x27;Or de L&#x27;Année A second recording followed in 2012 directed by Hervé Niquet and prepared by Dominique Visse.

Striggio was highly influential, as can be seen by the wide distribution of his music in Europe in the late 16th century. His influence was especially large in England; this may have been due in part to his 1567 visit, and also may have been related to the activities of Alfonso Ferrabosco, the Italian madrigalist who was resident in England for most of his life, and helped popularize the Italian style there.

<doc id="1199945" wikidata="Q3525925" url="?curid=1199945" title="Three Blind Mice">
<text>&quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; is an English nursery rhyme and musical round. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 3753.

==Lyrics==
The modern words are:

==Origins and meaning==
A version of this rhyme, together with music (in a minor key), was published in &quot;Deuteromelia or The Seconde part of Musicks melodie&quot; (1609). The editor of the book, and possible author of the rhyme, was Thomas Ravenscroft. The original lyrics are:

Attempts to read historical significance into the words have led to the speculation that this musical round was written earlier and refers to Queen Mary I of England blinding and executing three Protestant bishops. However, the Oxford Martyrs, Ridley, Latimer and Cranmer, were burned at the stake, not blinded, although if the rhyme was made by crypto-Catholics, the mice&#x27;s &quot;blindness&quot; could refer to their Protestantism. However, as can be seen above, the earliest lyrics don&#x27;t talk about harming the three blind mice, and the first known date of publication is 1609, well after Queen Mary died.

The rhyme only entered children&#x27;s literature in 1842 when it was published in a collection by James Orchard Halliwell.

==Variations==
Amateur music composer Thomas Oliphant (1799–1873) noted in 1843 that:
Robert Schumann&#x27;s Kreisleriana #7, which is arguably about a cat (Murr), appears to be based upon &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;, but in a predominantly minor key. &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; is to be found in the fugue which is the centerpiece of #7.

Joseph Holbrooke (1878–1958) composed his Symphonic Variations, opus 37, based on &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;. Joseph Haydn used its theme in the Finale (4th Mvt) of his Symphony 83 (&quot;La Poule&quot;) (1785–86); one of the 6 &quot;Paris Symphonies&quot;, and the music also appears in the final movement of English composer Eric Coates&#x27; suite &quot;The Three Men&quot;. &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; was used as a theme song for The Three Stooges and a Curtis Fuller arrangement of the rhyme is featured on the Art Blakey live album of the same name. The song is also the basis for Leroy Anderson&#x27;s 1947 orchestral &quot;Fiddle Faddle&quot;.

The theme can be heard in Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 IV. Allegro con fuoco and Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;El Paño Moruno&quot;.

The British composer Havergal Brian (1876–1972) used the tune as the basis of his orchestral work &quot;Fantastic Variations on an Old Rhyme&quot; (1907–08). The work was originally intended as the first movement of a satirical &quot;Fantastic Symphony&quot; (Symphony No.1), a programmatic work, based on the nursery rhyme. The second movement was intended as a scherzo for pizzicato strings, depicting the souls of the departed mice going to heaven and the third movement was a Lament for the dead mice. Both these movements are lost. &quot;Festal Dance&quot; (1908) formed the finale, depicting the wild dance of triumph of the farmer&#x27;s wife in which passing references to the tune can be heard. Having been performed separately, the first and last movements became independent works around 1914.

The theme of the second movement of Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4 (1926, revised 1928 and 1941) was criticized as resembling &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;.

A calypso version of the tune with new lyrics by Monty Norman was recorded by Byron Lee and the Dragonaires for the film &quot;Dr. No&quot;, and is featured in its soundtrack as part of the track &quot;Kingston Calypso&quot;. The reworked rhyme alludes to the three black assassins whose deadly march through the streets of Kingston, Jamaica opens the film. Other Jamaican versions include dancehall artists, like Josey Wales and Brigadier Jerry.

===&quot;Complete version&quot;===

Published in 1904 by Frederick Warne &amp; Co. in London, an illustrated children&#x27;s book by John W. Ivimey entitled &quot;The Complete Version of Ye Three Blind Mice&quot;, fleshes the mice out into mischievous characters who seek adventure, eventually being taken in by a farmer whose wife chases them from the house and into a bramble bush, which blinds them. Soon after, their tails are removed by &quot;the butcher&#x27;s wife&quot; when the complete version incorporates the original verse—although the earliest version from 1609 does not mention tails being cut off. The story ends with them using a tonic to grow new tails and recover their eyesight, learning a trade (making wood chips, according to the accompanying illustration), buying a house and living happily ever after.

The book is now in the public domain.

<text>Aseri () is a small borough () in Viru-Nigula Parish, Lääne-Viru County, in northeastern Estonia. As of the 2011 census, the settlement&#x27;s population was 1,439, of which the Estonians were 506 (35.2%).

There is a building materials factory in Aseri.

A 3,200-year-old bronze ax has been found on the beach of Meriküla, only four Late Bronze Age axes have been found in Estonia so far.
Aseri is named after the Aseri manor, which was first mentioned in 1367 under the name &quot;Asserien&quot;, the manor belonged to the parish of Lüganuse, and in the 16th century these areas were merged with the parish of Viru-Nigula.

During the German occupation of Estonia (World War II), the occupiers operated a subcamp of the Vaivara concentration camp, in which Frenchmen, Spaniards, Dutchmen and Jews were subjected to forced labour.

<doc id="1199961" wikidata="Q2998677" url="?curid=1199961" title="Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)">
<text>&quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; is the third episode of the sixteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 21, 2004. To date, this is Jon Vitti&#x27;s last episode as writer and Lauren MacMullan&#x27;s last episode as director.

In the episode, Marge finds Nelson and acts as a mother figure towards him due to her belief that her children lost interest in her. Meanwhile, Lisa gets teased about her big butt, and becomes obsessed with her weight. The episode received mixed reviews.

==Plot==
Lisa gets teased by Sherri and Terri about her big butt, making her embarrassed and self-conscious about her weight. Homer only makes matters worse when he tells her about the &quot;Simpson butt&quot;, something that all Simpsons have. Bart brings home a geography test with a grade of 100, eagerly expecting a party that was promised to him if he had got a 100. Despite Homer discovering that the watermark of Bart&#x27;s test is real and that all the answers are correct, he and Marge speak to Bart&#x27;s teacher. Mrs. Krabappel confesses that she did not bother to fold up the map during the test, so Bart and everyone else received 100. Marge throws Bart a party, which is attended by Patty and Selma, Grampa, Grandma, Ralph, and even Martin. Milhouse can only attend via speakerphone because he is sick with measles. Bart hates the party and to make matters worse, Lisa runs up to her room crying when Marge offers her one slice of cake.

Marge thinks her children no longer appreciate her, so when she finds Nelson catching tadpoles from a water fountain at the zoo, she decides to become a mother figure by spending quality time with him. They bond as Nelson tells Marge about his poor life involving his father abandoning him and never coming back. Marge brings him home so he can do some chores. Nelson&#x27;s mother finds this out and does not want Marge giving them any charity. Later that night, Mrs. Muntz leaves town, and Nelson, having nowhere else to go, stays with the Simpsons. Marge lets him sleep in Bart&#x27;s room, forcing Bart to sleep underneath his bed.

Late one night, Bart sees Nelson sing about his missing father, and sees Lisa eat an entire Labor Day cake as she was unable to take any more starvation. As Bart walks away, Nelson also sees her doing this and after talking about the situation, he offers to help Lisa get back at Sherri and Terri for teasing her. The next day, Nelson unleashes a skunk, which sprays both of them, while Lisa and her friends point and sing a parody of Jingle Bells. Both twins are scared and flee. When Lisa and Nelson return home, they find Nelson&#x27;s father, who Bart found working at a freak show in a circus. It turns out that Mr. Muntz had really gone to the Kwik-E-Mart, where he had gotten a severe allergic reaction from eating a peanut bar. Coincidentally, the circus had made a stop in the Kwik-E-Mart parking lot, and the unscrupulous ringmaster noted the allergy and kept him as a forced freak for his traveling show. Nelson&#x27;s mother finally returns, after going to Hollywood and getting the lead role in Macbeth, playing Lady Macbeth. Before returning to his family, Nelson thanks Marge for making him feel good about himself and appreciates what Bart did but says that this is not enough to stop him from bullying Bart.

As the family talk about the morals of the episode, Lisa admits that she still has body image issues. Homer tries to get Lisa to talk about it positively, but Lisa says that it is a &quot;very open-ended problem&quot; and that she may never fully be content with her body image. Homer tries to goad Lisa into changing her mind, but she refuses to do so.

== Production ==
The episode was written by Jon Vitti and was directed by Lauren MacMullan. This is their last episode to act as those roles.

== Reception ==
===Viewing figures===
In its original broadcast, &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; earned a 3.6 rating and was viewed by 9.95 million people, which was the 38th most-watched show that week.

===Critical response===
Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; said the episode was &quot;mediocre-at-best&quot;. He called Lisa&#x27;s subplot &quot;awfully preachy&quot; and did not like Nelson&#x27;s interactions with the Simpson family.

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Guy Davis and Brendan Dando liked both the main plot and Lisa&#x27;s subplot. They liked how the story added more dimension to Nelson&#x27;s character.

<doc id="1199964" wikidata="Q1455178" url="?curid=1199964" title="Second-language acquisition">
<text>Second-language acquisition (SLA), sometimes called second-language learning—otherwise referred to as L2 (language 2) acquisition, is the process of learning a language other than one&#x27;s native language (L1). SLA research examines how learners develop their knowledge of second language, focusing on concepts like &quot;interlanguage&quot;, a transitional linguistic system with its own rules that evolves as learners acquire the target language. 

SLA research spans cognitive, social, and linguistic perspectives. Cognitive approaches investigate memory and attention processes; sociocultural theories emphasize the role of social interaction and immersion; and linguistic studies examine the innate and learned aspects of language. Individual factors like age, motivation, and personality also influence SLA, as seen in discussions on the critical period hypothesis and learning strategies. In addition to acquisition, SLA explores language loss, or second-language attrition, and the impact of formal instruction on learning outcomes.

== Definitions ==
&quot;Second language&quot; refers to any language learned in addition to a person&#x27;s first language; although the concept is called &quot;second&quot;-language acquisition, it can also incorporate the learning of third, fourth, or subsequent languages. Second-language acquisition refers to what learners do; it does not refer to practices in language teaching, although teaching can affect acquisition. The term &quot;acquisition&quot; was originally used to emphasize the non-conscious nature of the learning process, but in recent years &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;acquisition&quot; have become largely synonymous.

SLA can incorporate heritage language learning, but it does not usually incorporate bilingualism. Most SLA researchers see bilingualism as being the result of learning a language, not the process itself, and see the term as referring to native-like fluency. Writers in fields such as education and psychology, however, often use bilingualism loosely to refer to all forms of multilingualism. SLA is also not to be contrasted with the acquisition of a foreign language; rather, the learning of second languages and the learning of foreign languages involve the same fundamental processes in different situations.

== Research background ==
The academic discipline of second-language acquisition is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics. It is broad-based and relatively new. As well as the various branches of linguistics, second-language acquisition is also closely related to psychology and education. To separate the academic discipline from the learning process itself, the terms &quot;second-language acquisition research&quot;, &quot;second-language studies&quot;, and &quot;second-language acquisition studies&quot; are also used.

SLA research began as an interdisciplinary field; because of this, it is difficult to identify a precise starting date. However, two papers in particular are seen as instrumental to the development of the modern study of SLA: Pit Corder&#x27;s 1967 essay &quot;The Significance of Learners&#x27; Errors&quot; and Larry Selinker&#x27;s 1972 article &quot;Interlanguage&quot;. The field saw a great deal of development in the following decades. Since the 1980s, SLA has been studied from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, and theoretical perspectives. In the early 2000s, some research suggested an equivalence between the acquisition of human languages and that of computer languages (e.g. Java) by children in the 5 to 11-year age window, though this has not been widely accepted amongst educators. Significant approaches in the field today are systemic functional linguistics, sociocultural theory, cognitive linguistics, Noam Chomsky&#x27;s universal grammar, skill acquisition theory and connectionism.

There has been much debate about exactly how language is learned and many issues are still unresolved. There are many theories of second-language acquisition, but none are accepted as a complete explanation by all SLA researchers. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field of SLA, this is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future. Although attempts have been made to provide a more unified account that tries to bridge first language acquisition and second language learning research.

== Language difficulty and learning time ==

The time taken to reach a high level of proficiency can vary depending on the language learned. In the case of native English speakers, some estimates were provided by the &quot;Foreign Service Institute&quot; (FSI) of the U.S. Department of State—which compiled approximate learning expectations for several languages for their professional staff (native English speakers who generally already know other languages). &quot;Category I Languages&quot; include e.g. Italian and Swedish (24 weeks or 600 class hours) and French (30 weeks or 750 class hours). &quot;Category II Languages&quot; include German, Haitian Creole, Indonesian, Malay, and Swahili (approx. 36 weeks or 900 class hours). &quot;Category III Languages&quot; include a lot of languages like Finnish, Polish, Russian, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and many others (approx. 44 weeks, 1100 class hours).

Determining a language&#x27;s difficulty can depend on a few factors like grammar and pronunciation. For instance, Norwegian is one of the easiest languages to learn for English speakers because its vocabulary shares many cognates and has a sentence structure similar to English.

Of the 63 languages analyzed, the five most difficult languages to reach proficiency in speaking and reading, requiring 88 weeks (2200 class hours, &quot;Category IV Languages&quot;), are Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean. The Foreign Service Institute and the National Virtual Translation Center both note that Japanese is typically more difficult to learn than other languages in this group.

There are other rankings of language difficulty as the one by &quot;The British Foreign Office Diplomatic Service Language Centre&quot; which lists the difficult languages in Class I
(Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin); the easier languages are in Class V (e.g. Afrikaans, Bislama, Catalan, French, Spanish, Swedish).

== Comparisons with first-language acquisition ==
Adults who learn a second language differ from children learning their first language in at least three ways: children are still developing their brains whereas adults have mature minds, and adults have at least a first language that orients their thinking and speaking. Although some adult second-language learners reach very high levels of proficiency, pronunciation tends to be non-native. This lack of native pronunciation in adult learners is explained by the critical period hypothesis. When a learner&#x27;s speech plateaus, it is known as fossilization.

Also, when people learn a second language, the way they speak their first language changes in subtle ways. These changes can be with any aspect of language, from pronunciation and syntax to the gestures the learner makes and the language features they tend to notice. For example, French speakers who spoke English as a second language pronounced the /t/ sound in French differently from monolingual French speakers. This kind of change in pronunciation has been found even at the onset of second-language acquisition; for example, English speakers pronounced the English /p t k/ sounds, as well as English vowels, differently after they began to learn Korean. These effects of the second language on the first led Vivian Cook to propose the idea of multi-competence, which sees the different languages a person speaks not as separate systems, but as related systems in their mind.

== Learner language ==

Originally, attempts to describe learner language were based on comparing different languages or analyzing learners&#x27; errors. However, these approaches could not fully predict all the errors learners make during the process of acquiring a second language. To address this limitation and explain learners’ systematic errors, the concept of interlanguage was introduced. Interlanguage refers to the linguistic system that emerges in the minds of second language learners. It is not considered a defective version of the target language riddled with random errors, nor is it purely a result of errors transferred from the learner’s first language. Instead, it is viewed as a language in its own right, with its own systematic rules. Most aspects of language—syntax, phonology, lexicon, and pragmatics—can be analyzed from the perspective of interlanguage. For more detailed information, please refer to the main articles on Interlanguage.

=== Sequences in the acquisition of English inflectional morphology ===
In the 1970s, several studies investigated the order in which learners acquired different grammatical structures. These studies showed that there was little change in this order among learners with different first languages. Furthermore, it showed that the order was the same for adults and children and that it did not even change if the learner had language lessons. This supported the idea that there were factors other than language transfer involved in learning second languages and was a strong confirmation of the concept of interlanguage.
However, the studies did not find that the orders were the same. Although there were remarkable similarities in the order in which all learners learned second-language grammar, there were still some differences between individuals and learners with different first languages. It is also difficult to tell when exactly a grammatical structure has been learned, as learners may use structures correctly in some situations but not in others. Thus it is more accurate to speak of &quot;sequences&quot; of acquisition, in which specific grammatical features in a language are acquired before or after certain others but the overall order of acquisition is less rigid. 

Recent studies have shown that universality and individuality coexist in the order of grammatical item acquisition. For example, items such as articles, tense, and the progressive aspect are particularly challenging for learners whose native languages, like Japanese and Korean, do not explicitly express these features. On the other hand, items like the third-person singular -s tend to be less influenced by the learner&#x27;s native language. In contrast, articles and the progressive -ing have been confirmed to be strongly affected by the learners&#x27; native language. For more detailed information, please refer to the main articles on Order of acquisition.

=== Learnability and teachability ===
Learnability has emerged as a theory explaining developmental sequences that crucially depend on learning principles, which are viewed as fundamental mechanisms of interlanguage language acquisition within learnability theory. Some examples of learning principles include the uniqueness principle and the subset principle. The uniqueness principle refers to learners&#x27; preference for a one-to-one mapping between form and meaning, while the subset principle posits that learners are conservative in that they begin with the narrowest hypothesis space that is compatible with available data. Both of these principles have been used to explain children&#x27;s ability to evaluate grammaticality despite the lack of explicit negative evidence. They have also been used to explain errors in SLA, as the creation of supersets could signal over-generalization, causing acceptance or production of ungrammatical sentences.

Pienemann&#x27;s teachability hypothesis is based on the idea that there is a hierarchy of stages of acquisition and instruction in SLA should be compatible with learners&#x27; current acquisitional status. Recognizing learners&#x27; developmental stages is important as it enables teachers to predict and classify learning errors. This hypothesis predicts that L2 acquisition can only be promoted when learners are ready to acquire given items in a natural context. One goal of learnability theory is to figure out which linguistic phenomena are susceptible to fossilization, wherein some L2 learners continue to make errors despite the presence of relevant input.

=== Variability ===

Although second-language acquisition proceeds in discrete sequences, it does not progress from one step of a sequence to the next in an orderly fashion. There can be considerable variability in features of learners&#x27; interlanguage while progressing from one stage to the next. For example, in one study by Rod Ellis, a learner used both &quot;No look my card&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t look my card&quot; while playing a game of bingo. A small fraction of variation in interlanguage is &quot;free variation&quot;, when the learner uses two forms interchangeably. However, most variation is &quot;systemic variation&quot;, a variation that depends on the context of utterances the learner makes. Forms can vary depending on the linguistic context, such as whether the subject of a sentence is a pronoun or a noun; they can vary depending on social contexts, such as using formal expressions with superiors and informal expressions with friends; and also, they can vary depending on the psycholinguistic context, or in other words, on whether learners have the chance to plan what they are going to say. The causes of variability are a matter of great debate among SLA researchers.

== Language transfer ==
One important difference between first-language acquisition and second-language acquisition is that the process of second-language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows. This influence is known as &quot;language transfer&quot;. Language transfer is a complex phenomenon resulting from the interaction between learners’ prior linguistic knowledge, the target language input they encounter, and their cognitive processes. Language transfer is not always from the learner’s native language; it can also be from a second language or a third. Neither is it limited to any particular domain of language; language transfer can occur in grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, discourse, and reading.

For more detailed information, please refer to the main articles on and Language transfer and Crosslilnguistic influence.

== Factors and approaches ==

=== Cognitive factors ===
Much modern research in second-language acquisition has taken a cognitive approach. Cognitive research is concerned with the mental processes involved in language acquisition, and how they can explain the nature of learners&#x27; language knowledge. This area of research is based in the more general area of cognitive science and uses many concepts and models used in more general cognitive theories of learning. As such, cognitive theories view second-language acquisition as a special case of more general learning mechanisms in the brain. This puts them in direct contrast with linguistic theories, which posit that language acquisition uses a unique process different from other types of learning.

The dominant model in cognitive approaches to second-language acquisition, and indeed in all second-language acquisition research, is the computational model. The computational model involves three stages. In the first stage, learners retain certain features of the language input in short-term memory. (This retained input is known as &quot;intake&quot;.) Then, learners convert some of this intake into second-language knowledge, which is stored in long-term memory. Finally, learners use this second-language knowledge to produce spoken output. Cognitive theories attempt to codify both the nature of the mental representations of intake and language knowledge and the mental processes that underlie these stages.

In the early days of second-language acquisition research on interlanguage was seen as the basic representation of second-language knowledge; however, more recent research has taken several different approaches in characterizing the mental representation of language knowledge. Some theories hypothesize that learner language is inherently variable, and there is the functionalist perspective that sees the acquisition of language as intimately tied to the function it provides. Some researchers make the distinction between &quot;implicit&quot; and &quot;explicit&quot; knowledge, and some between &quot;declarative&quot; and &quot;procedural&quot; language knowledge. There have also been approaches that argue for a &quot;dual-mode system&quot; in which some language knowledge is stored as rules and other language knowledge as items.

=== Sociocultural factors ===

From the early days of the discipline, researchers have also acknowledged that social aspects play an important role. There have been many different approaches to the sociolinguistic study of second-language acquisition. Common to each of these approaches, however, is a rejection of language as a purely psychological phenomenon; instead, sociolinguistic research views the social context in which language is learned as essential for a proper understanding of the acquisition process.

Ellis identifies three types of social structures that affect the acquisition of second languages: sociolinguistic settings, specific social factors, and situational factors. Sociolinguistic setting refers to the role of the second language in society, such as whether it is spoken by a majority or a minority of the population, whether its use is widespread or restricted to a few functional roles, or whether the society is predominantly bilingual or monolingual. Ellis also includes the distinction of whether the second language is learned in a natural or an educational setting. Specific social factors that can affect second-language acquisition include age, gender, social class, and ethnic identity, with ethnic identity being the one that has received most research attention. Situational factors are those that vary between each social interaction. For example, a learner may use more polite language when talking to someone of higher social status, but more informal language when talking with friends.

A learner&#x27;s sense of connection to their in-group, as well as to the community of the target language emphasizes the influence of the sociolinguistic setting, as well as social factors within the second-language acquisition process. Social Identity Theory argues that an important factor for second language acquisition is the learner&#x27;s perceived identity to the community of the language being learned, as well as how the community of the target language perceives the learner. Whether or not a learner feels a sense of connection to the community or culture of the target language helps determine their social distance from the target culture. A smaller social distance is likely to encourage learners to acquire the second language, as their investment in the learning process is greater. Conversely, a greater social distance discourages attempts to acquire the target language. However, negative views not only come from the learner, but the community of the target language might feel greater social distance from the learner, limiting the learner&#x27;s ability to learn the language. Whether or not bilingualism is valued by the culture or community of the learner is an important indicator of the motivation to learn a language.

There have been several models developed to explain social effects on language acquisition. Schumann&#x27;s acculturation model proposes that learners&#x27; rate of development and ultimate level of language achievement is a function of the &quot;social distance&quot; and the &quot;psychological distance&quot; between learners and the second-language community. In Schumann&#x27;s model, the social factors are most important, but the degree to which learners are comfortable with learning the second language also plays a role. Another sociolinguistic model is Gardner&#x27;s socio-educational model, which was designed to explain classroom language acquisition. Gardner&#x27;s model focuses on the emotional aspects of SLA, arguing that positive motivation contributes to an individual&#x27;s willingness to learn L2; furthermore, the goal of an individual to learn an L2 is based on the idea that the individual has a desire to be part of a culture, in other words, part of a (the targeted language) mono-linguistic community. Factors, such as &quot;integrativeness&quot; and &quot;attitudes towards the learning situation&quot; drive motivation. The outcome of positive motivation is not only linguistic but non-linguistic, such that the learner has met the desired goal. Although there are many critics of Gardner&#x27;s model, nonetheless many of these critics have been influenced by the merits that his model holds. The inter-group model proposes &quot;ethnolinguistic vitality&quot; as a key construct for second-language acquisition. Language socialization is an approach with the premise that &quot;linguistic and cultural knowledge are &quot;constructed&quot; through each other&quot;, and saw increased attention after the year 2000. Finally, Norton&#x27;s theory of social identity is an attempt to codify the relationship between power, identity, and language acquisition.

A unique approach to SLA is sociocultural theory. It was originally developed by Lev Vygotsky and his followers. Central to Vygotsky&#x27;s theory is the concept of a zone of proximal development (ZPD). The ZPD notion states that social interaction with more advanced target language users allows one to learn a language at a higher level than if they were to learn a language independently. Sociocultural theory has a fundamentally different set of assumptions to approaches to second-language acquisition based on the computational model. Furthermore, although it is closely affiliated with other social approaches, it is a theory of mind and not of general social explanation of language acquisition. According to Ellis, &quot;It is important to recognize... that this paradigm, despite the label &#x27;sociocultural&#x27; does not seek to explain how learners acquire the cultural values of the L2 but rather how knowledge of an L2 is internalized through experiences of a sociocultural nature.&quot;

=== Linguistic factors ===

Linguistic approaches to explaining second-language acquisition spring from the wider study of linguistics. They differ from cognitive approaches and sociocultural approaches in that they consider linguistic knowledge to be unique and distinct from any other type of knowledge. The linguistic research tradition in second-language acquisition has developed in relative isolation from the cognitive and sociocultural research traditions, and as of 2010 the influence from the wider field of linguistics was still strong. Two main strands of research can be identified in the linguistic tradition: generative approaches informed by universal grammar, and typological approaches.

Typological universals are principles that hold for all the world&#x27;s languages. They are found empirically, by surveying different languages and deducing which aspects of them could be universal; these aspects are then checked against other languages to verify the findings. The interlanguages of second-language learners have been shown to obey typological universals, and some researchers have suggested that typological universals may constrain interlanguage development.

The theory of universal grammar was proposed by Noam Chomsky in the 1950s and has enjoyed considerable popularity in the field of linguistics. It focuses on describing the linguistic competence of an individual. He believed that children not only acquire language by learning descriptive rules of grammar; he claimed that children &quot;creatively&quot; play and form words as they learn language, creating meaning for the words, as opposed to the mechanism of memorizing language. The &quot;universals&quot; in universal grammar differ from typological universals in that they are a mental construct derived by researchers, whereas typological universals are readily verifiable by data from world languages.

Universal grammar theory can account for some of the observations of SLA research. For example, L2 users often display knowledge about their L2 that they have not been exposed to. L2 users are often aware of ambiguous or ungrammatical L2 units that they have not learned from any external source, nor their pre-existing L1 knowledge. This unsourced knowledge suggests the existence of a universal grammar. Another piece of evidence that generative linguists tend to use is the poverty of the stimulus, which states that children acquiring language lack sufficient data to fully acquire all facets of grammar in their language, causing a mismatch between input and output. The fact that children are only exposed to positive evidence yet have intuition about which word strings are ungrammatical may also be indicative of universal grammar. However, L2 learners have access to negative evidence as they are explicitly taught about ungrammaticality through corrections or grammar teaching.

== Individual variation ==
Individual factors, such as language aptitude, age, strategy use, motivation, and personality, play a significant role in second-language acquisition. For example, the critical period hypothesis explores how age affects language learning ability, while motivation is often categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic types. Personality traits, such as introversion and extroversion, and the use of effective learning strategies can also influence language acquisition outcomes. For more detailed information, see the Individual variation in second-language acquisition article.
== Attrition ==

Second-language attrition refers to the loss of proficiency in a language that was previously acquired, often due to a lack of use or exposure. Factors influencing attrition include the level of initial proficiency, age, social circumstances, and motivation. A learner&#x27;s L2 is not suddenly lost with disuse, but its communicative functions are slowly replaced by those of the L1. 

Similar to second-language acquisition, second-language attrition occurs in stages. However, according to the regression hypothesis, the stages of attrition occur in reverse order of acquisition. With acquisition, receptive skills develop first, and then productive skills, and with attrition, productive skills are lost first, and then receptive skills.

== Classroom second-language acquisition ==
As stated at the beginning of this article, second language acquisition (SLA) is the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process, and for this reason, research that evaluates the effectiveness of teaching methods is often not considered part of SLA research. However, there have been attempts to apply SLA research findings to teaching methods, and this area is referred to as &quot;classroom second language acquisition&quot; or &quot;instructed second language acquisition (ISLA)&quot;. This kind of research has a significant overlap with language education, and it is mainly concerned with the effect that instruction has on the learner. It also explores what teachers do, the classroom context, and the dynamics of classroom communication. It is both qualitative and quantitative research.

Cited in It is generally agreed that pedagogy restricted to teaching grammar rules and vocabulary lists does not give students the ability to use the L2 with accuracy and fluency. Rather, to become proficient in the second language, the learner must be given opportunities to use it for communicative purposes.

== Theories ==
Numerous theories have been proposed not only to describe the phenomena of SLA but also to explain them by uncovering the underlying mechanisms. Despite differing perspectives, these research approaches share a common goal: contributing to the identification of conditions that facilitate effective language acquisition. Recognizing the contributions of each perspective and fostering interdisciplinary connections, researchers have increasingly sought to understand the complex process of second language acquisition from a broader perspective in recent years. These efforts go beyond the limitations of explaining SLA through a single theory, paving the way for a more comprehensive and multilayered understanding.

== Journals ==
Major journals of the field include &quot;Second Language Research, Language Learning, Studies in Second Language Acquisition, Applied Linguistics&quot;, &quot;Applied Psycholinguistics&quot;, &quot;International Review of Applied Linguistics in Language Teaching&quot;, &quot;International Journal of Applied Linguistics,&quot; System, &quot;Journal of Second Language Studies&quot;, and &quot;Journal of the European Second Language Association&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Segundo&quot; (SS-398) was a , of the United States Navy named for the segundo, a cavalla fish of Caribbean waters.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Segundo&quot; was laid down on 14 October 1943 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in [Kittery, Maine, launched on 5 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. John L. Sullivan, and commissioned on 9 May 1944.

==May–August 1944==
&quot;Segundo&quot; completed fitting out and contract trials then moved to New London, Connecticut, on 15 June and began training. The submarine stood out of New London on 26 June for the Panama Canal Zone en route to the Pacific war zone. She departed Balboa on 9 July and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 25 July. The next several weeks were spent in training exercises and weapons firing. The ship was combat loaded on 19 August and 20 August and, the next day, sailed on her first war patrol.

== First and second patrols, August 1944 – January 1945 ==
&quot;Segundo&quot;, together with submarines , and formed a wolf pack. They refueled at Saipan on 3 September and departed the next day for their patrol area in the Philippines near Surigao Strait. She was in the Philippine Sea east of Catanduanes Island at on 13 September 1944 when two U.S. Navy planes mistook her for a Japanese submarine and strafed her as she crash-dived. No rounds struck her. &quot;Segundo&quot; found no worthwhile targets were found during the patrol, and she ended it at Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 21 October 1944 without having fired a shot.

The second patrol, from 16 November 1944 to 5 January 1945, was more profitable. &quot;Segundo&quot;, and sister boats , and were cruising between Luzon Strait and the South China Sea. On the evening of 6 December, a convoy of seven escorted merchant ships was sighted. The three submarines made night attacks which sank all of the merchantmen.

== Third patrol, February–March 1945 ==
&quot;Segundo&quot; refitted at Guam from the submarine tender and was in the East China Sea with &quot;Razorback&quot; and on 1 February. Three torpedo attacks were made on unescorted ships near the Korean coast in shallow water. The first attack was on 6 March against a small ship but all torpedoes missed. The next was made four days later against a medium-sized ship. Four torpedoes were fired at but they also missed.

The third attack was a night surface action against a cargo ship on 11 March. Two torpedoes of the spread hit. The first blew the stern off and the second hit amidships, sinking cargo ship &quot;Shori Maru&quot; in two minutes. The submarine ended her patrol at Pearl Harbor on 26 March and remained there for a month before putting to sea again.

== Fourth and fifth patrols, May–August 1945 ==
&quot;Segundo&quot; was assigned to a lifeguard station until 16 May when she departed for her assigned area in the East China Sea. On 29 May, she sank seven two-masted schooners of approximately 100 tons each with shellfire. Two days later, she sank a large four-masted full-rigged ship of approximately 1,250 tons with two torpedoes. She sank another on 3 June with her deck gun. On 9 June, two patrol ships were also sunk by her deck gun. On the night of 11 June, &quot;Fukui Maru&quot; was torpedoed and sunk. The submarine then sailed to Midway Atoll for upkeep.

&quot;Segundo&quot; began her fifth and final war patrol on 10 August in the Sea of Okhotsk. Ordered to proceed to Tokyo Bay on 24 August, the ship was proceeding south when she encountered the , which was at the time the largest submarine in the world, by radar on 29 August. The enemy boat was ordered to halt by international signal. This was done; and, after several trips between the two submarines by their respective representatives, the Japanese agreed to accept a prize crew aboard and to proceed to Tokyo with &quot;Segundo&quot;. The two ships entered Sagami Wan on 31 August and, at 05:00, the American flag was raised aboard &quot;I-401&quot;.

== 1945–1953 ==
&quot;Segundo&quot; stood out of Tokyo Bay on 3 September 1945 en route to the west coast via Pearl Harbor. She was assigned to SubRon 3 in San Diego and began operations from there. The submarine made a three-month cruise to Australia and China in 1946 and a four-month cruise to China in 1948. The outbreak of the Korean War found &quot;Segundo&quot; in the Far East. She supported United Nations Forces in Korea from July to September 1950 before returning to San Diego in late November.

In 1951, &quot;Segundo&quot; was modernized and converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. She returned to her home port and resumed operations until 15 August 1952 when she again joined the 7th Fleet off Korea. That deployment period ended on 16 February 1953.

== 1953–1970 ==
For the next 16 years, &quot;Segundo&quot; operated out of her home port and along the west coast. From 1953 through 1969, she was deployed to the western Pacific every year except 1961, and 1963.

&quot;Segundo&quot; departed for the Western Pacific Ocean on 27 November 1956 with stops in Pearl Harbor, Yokosuka, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Subic Bay and Manila, Philippines and Buckner Bay, Okinawa.
The reason for this emergency departure was because of the Hungarian revolt that was taking place at the time. The Segundo was ordered into port in San Diego and shortly after departed for Peal Harbor, then the north Pacific on a special patrol, submerging on 21 December 1956 and resurfacing on 21 January 1957 before stopping in Yokosuka Japan.

In July 1970, a Survey Board found &quot;Segundo&quot; unfit for further naval service. The submarine was decommissioned 1 August 1970, struck from the Navy list on 8 August 1970, and sunk as a target by either the submarine or the submarine (sources differ).

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Segundo&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service and one for the Korean War.

<text>Bright Eyes is a 1934 American comedy drama film directed by David Butler. The screenplay by William Conselman is based on a story by David Butler and Edwin J. Burke.

==Plot==
Five-year-old Shirley Blake (Shirley Temple) and her widowed mother Mary (Lois Wilson), a maid, live in the home of her employers, the wealthy and mean-spirited Smythe family: Anita (Dorothy Christy), J. Wellington (Theodore von Eltz), their spoiled seven-year-old daughter Joy (Jane Withers), and cantankerous wheelchair-using Uncle Ned (Charles Sellon). After Christmas morning, Shirley visited her late father&#x27;s pilot friends at the airport. The aviators bring her aboard an airplane and taxi her around the runways while she serenades them with a rendition of &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop.&quot;

That day, Mary got killed in a traffic accident. Loop (James Dunn), one of the pilots and Shirley&#x27;s godfather, takes Shirley in an airplane, explaining that they are in Heaven, where her mother now rests. When the Smythes learn of Mary&#x27;s death, they plan to send Shirley to an orphanage. However, Uncle Ned, who has grown fond of &quot;Bright Eyes,&quot; insists that Shirley stay with them. To raise money for attorney fees, Loop reluctantly accepts a lucrative contract to deliver an item by plane cross-country to New York during a dangerous storm. Unbeknown to him, little Shirley sneaked away from the Smythes&#x27; home, found his airplane at the airport, and stowed away inside. When their plane loses control in the storm in the wilderness, they parachute to the ground together and are eventually rescued. The impasse over custody gets resolved when Loop, his former fiancée Adele (Judith Allen), Uncle Ned, and Shirley decide to live together. The Smythes leave the courthouse miserably, except Joy, at first; when she rudely comments that at least they don&#x27;t have to be nice to Uncle Ned anymore, her mother slaps her hard across the face.

==Production==

American Airlines and the Douglas Aircraft Company, recognizing the potential of the film in advertising air travel, cooperated in the production and distribution. They provided a DC-2, designated &quot;A-74&quot;, aircraft for the exterior shots while a true to scale mock up was provided for the interior scenes. A 12-passenger Curtiss T-32 Condor II transport biplane, designated &quot;Condor 151&quot;, in early American Airlines (and Air Mail) livery also features in prominent scenes. In the famous &quot;Good Ship Lollipop&quot; scene, members of the University of Southern California football team served as extras. In the second flying scene where Temple&#x27;s character sneaks aboard the plane, and they were forced to bail out of it, both Temple and Dunn were strapped into a harness hoisted up into the studio rafters. They were supposed to drift down with the aid of a wind machine. In the first take, someone inadvertently opened an airproof door just as they landed, creating a vacuum that sucked out the parachute and dragged them both across the studio floor. Marilyn Granas served as a stand-in for Temple, as she had for her previous movies. She would later be replaced by Mary Lou Isleib, who would remain as Temple&#x27;s stand-in for the rest of her tenure at 20th Century Fox.

==Reception==

The film received positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes holds an approval rating of 83%, based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.

Heather Boerner of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gave the film a rate of three stars out of four, calling it a &quot;sweet story with a candy coating.&quot; She also noted that some scenes are &quot;sad, bitter in the center of this confection that may be too tough on younger viewers.&quot;

===Awards and honors===
Temple received a miniature Oscar on February 27, 1935, for her contributions to film entertainment in 1934, chiefly for &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; and &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;. She was the first child actor to receive an Academy Award.

<doc id="1199991" wikidata="Q199295" url="?curid=1199991" title="Zieve's syndrome">
<text>Zieve&#x27;s syndrome is an acute metabolic condition that can occur during withdrawal from prolonged heavy alcohol use. It is defined by hemolytic anemia (with spur cells and acanthocytes), hyperlipoproteinemia (excessive blood lipoprotein), jaundice (elevation of unconjugated bilirubin), and abdominal pain. The underlying cause is liver delipidization. This is distinct from alcoholic hepatitis which, however, may present simultaneously or develop later.

Diagnosis of Zieve&#x27;s syndrome should be considered in patients with prolonged alcohol use (especially after an episode of binge drinking) with an elevation of unconjugated bilirubin and without obvious signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.

== Pathogenesis ==
The proposed mechanism of the characteristic haemolytic anemia in Zieve&#x27;s syndrome is due to alteration of the red cell metabolism, namely pyruvate kinase instability leaving them susceptible to circulating hemolysin such as lysolecithin. Changes in membrane lipid compositions such as increased cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) have been reported during the hemolytic phase.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is demonstrated by the triad of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, hemolytic anemia, and hyperlipidemia.

== Treatment ==
Definitive treatment for Zieve&#x27;s syndrome is alcohol cessation. Individuals with markedly elevated triglycerides, particularly with a history of pancreatitis or intracerebral hemorrhage, may require plasmapharesis to avoid complications associated with hypertriglyceridemia.

== History ==
Zieve&#x27;s syndrome was initially described in 1958. Leslie Zieve described patients with a combination of alcoholic liver disease, hemolytic anemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

<text>Drape suits are a British variation of the three-piece suit introduced in the 1930s, in which the cut is full and &quot;drapes&quot;. It is also known as the blade cut or London cut. The design of the athletic aesthetic of the drape suit is attributed to the London tailor Frederick Scholte. 

The new suit cut was softer and more flexible in construction than the suits of the previous generation; extra fabric in the shoulder and armscye, light padding, a slightly nipped waist, and fuller sleeves tapered at the wrist resulted in a cut with folds, or &quot;drapes,&quot; front and back that created the illusion of the broad-shoulders and tight-waist &quot;V&quot; figure of the very fit.

==Historical background==
Most changes in menswear occur slowly and subtly, until the shift becomes noticeably different. This noticeably different change occurs some time after the transition had begun. In comparison, changes in women&#x27;s fashions are fast and each alteration noticeable almost immediately as it occurs. English tailoring remained the norm in leading men&#x27;s fashions with a heavy influence of sportswear.

==1920s–1930s==
Introduced in the late 1920s, the athletic silhouette in suits &quot;gradually and subtly refined into the drape cut&quot;. The athletic cut was more comfortable and less fitted to allow for movement. Previously, they were considered informal and not suitable for everyday dress on the streets. During the early 1900s, there was a shift of attitudes, and the clothes that were considered informal or for sports were being worn on the streets and were considered acceptable wear. The English drape suit became popular by the late 1930s. Edward VIII often wore the drape cut and in doing so helped to spread its popularity to America.

Frederick Scholte&#x27;s distinctive V-shaped suit was developed through &quot;discreet horizontal drapes narrowed across the shoulder blades from the roomy armholes down to the raised waistline&quot;. This shape resembled a &#x27;V&#x27;, which was caused by the broad shoulders that narrowed to a tucked in waistline, which smoothed over the hips as opposed to flaring back out (like the tail coat or the frock coat that preceded it). The shoulders were not padded, looking natural, broad and masculine. The drape suit was a more comfortable, athletic alternative to the slim suits of the preceding war years and their restrictions. It had more fabric through the shoulders and chest, causing a slight drape or wrinkle. Like other suit jackets, this style could be made single or double-breasted. The pants were also cut fuller &quot;with pleated fronts and wide legs that tapered slightly to the ankle&quot;.

==Variations: American drape suit versus British drape suit==
The main difference between American and British versions of the drape suit was in the treatment of the sleeve-head at the shoulderline. The American version had a &quot;smooth roll of sleeve fabric where it was stitched into the armscye&quot; whereas the English version had &quot;tiny puckers from stitch tucks&quot;. In addition, the American drape suit has a very tapered waist that helps to exaggerate the bulk in the chest and shoulders, and causes the skirt line to appear flared. In comparison, the English version has a less tapered waist with a straight skirt line.

==Drape suit in the mid-20th century ==
By the mid-1930s, &quot;two subtle changes added a touch of modernity to the athletic suit style&quot;. The first modification was the alteration of the peaked lapel, which became wider and angled more upwards. This added more fullness and width to the &#x27;masculine&#x27; chest. The second modification was the alteration of the sleeve armholes to become more narrow and raised. This added more fullness and width for a &#x27;masculine&#x27; impact in the broadness of the shoulders and narrow waist.

The drape suit remained popular during World War II, being a familiar and stable piece during uncertain times. A man&#x27;s shoulders remained broad, fluid and natural; his chest appeared full and muscular &quot;with the deeply rolled lapels&quot;; &quot;his waist and hips were made trim with the raised coat waistline and ventless skirt&quot;.

In the 1950s, men&#x27;s fashions followed the trend of women&#x27;s. With Christian Dior&#x27;s New Look for women, came the Bold Look and Continental Cut for men. The Bold Look was the continuation of the English drape cut with greater emphasis on the coordination of the suit with its accessories and shirt. It continued to have broad shoulders with a slightly nipped in waist and a double-breasted suit jacket. This cut was anchored in the WWII version, without the war restrictions.

==Late 20th century==
In the 1974 film &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, the drape suit of the 1920s and 1930s was revisited. The suit was modernized with the use of synthetic fabrics and a more modern construction.

Recently, Michael Anton, author of &quot;The Suit&quot;, has advocated for the return of the drape suit. The American Zoot suit is an extreme exaggeration of excess fabric.

<doc id="1200020" wikidata="Q4382778" url="?curid=1200020" title="Gingerbread house">
<text>A gingerbread house is a novelty confectionery shaped like a building that is made of cookie dough, cut and baked into appropriate components like walls and roofing. The usual base material is crisp gingerbread, hence the name. Another type of model-making with gingerbread uses a boiled dough that can be moulded like clay to form edible statuettes or other decorations. These houses, covered with a variety of candies and icing, are popular Christmas decorations.

==History==

Records of honey cakes can be traced to ancient Rome. Food historians ratify that ginger has been seasoning foodstuffs and drinks since antiquity. It is believed gingerbread was first baked in Europe at the end of the 11th century, when returning crusaders brought back the custom of spicy bread from the Middle East. Ginger was not only tasty, it had properties that helped preserve the bread.
According to the French legend, gingerbread was brought to Europe in 992 by the Armenian monk, later saint, Gregory of Nicopolis (Gregory Makar). He lived for seven years in Bondaroy, France, near the town of Pithiviers, where he taught gingerbread cooking to priests and other Christians. He died in 999. 

Gingerbread, as we know it today, descends from Medieval European culinary traditions. Gingerbread was also shaped into different forms by monks in Franconia, Germany in the 13th century. &quot;Lebkuchen&quot; bakers are recorded as early as 1296 in Ulm and 1395 in Nuremberg, Germany. Nuremberg was recognized as the &quot;Gingerbread Capital of the World&quot; when in the 17th century the guild started to employ master bakers and skilled workers to create complicated works of art from gingerbread. Medieval bakers used carved boards to create elaborate designs. During the 13th century, the custom spread across Europe. It was taken to Sweden in the 13th century by German immigrants; there are references from Vadstena Abbey of Swedish nuns baking gingerbread to ease indigestion in 1444. The traditional sweetener is honey, used by the guild in Nuremberg. Spices used are ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom.
Gingerbread figurines date back to the 15th century, and figural biscuit-making was practised in the 16th century. The first documented instance of figure-shaped gingerbread biscuits is from the court of Elizabeth I of England: she had gingerbread figures made in the likeness of some of her important guests.

==History of gingerbread shaping==
The gingerbread bakers were gathered into professional baker guilds. In many European countries, gingerbread bakers were a distinct component of the bakers&#x27; guild. Gingerbread baking developed into an acknowledged profession. In the 17th century, only professional gingerbread bakers were permitted to bake gingerbread except at Christmas and Easter, when anyone was allowed to bake it.

In Europe, gingerbreads were sold in special shops and at seasonal markets that sold sweets and gingerbread shaped as hearts, stars, soldiers, babies, riders, trumpets, swords, pistols and animals. Gingerbread was especially sold outside churches on Sundays. Religious gingerbread reliefs were purchased for the particular religious events, such as Christmas and Easter. The decorated gingerbreads were given as presents to adults and children, or given as a love token, and bought particularly for weddings, where gingerbreads were distributed to the wedding guests. A gingerbread relief of the patron saint was frequently given as a gift on a person&#x27;s name day, the day of the saint associated with his or her given name. It was the custom to bake biscuits and paint them as window decorations. The most intricate gingerbreads were also embellished with iced patterns, often using colours, and also gilded with gold leaf. Gingerbread was also worn as a talisman in battle or as protection against evil spirits.

Gingerbread was a significant form of popular art in Europe; major centers of gingerbread mould carvings included Lyon, Nuremberg, Pest, Prague, Pardubice, Pulsnitz, Ulm, and Toruń. Gingerbread moulds often displayed actual happenings, by portraying new rulers and their consorts, for example. Substantial mould collections are held at the Ethnographic Museum in Toruń, Poland and the Bread Museum in Ulm, Germany. During the winter months, medieval gingerbread pastries, usually dipped in wine or other alcoholic beverages, were consumed. In America, the German-speaking communities of Pennsylvania and Maryland continued this tradition until the early 20th century. The tradition survived in colonial North America, where the pastries were baked as ginger snap cookies and gained favour as Christmas tree decorations.

The tradition of making decorated gingerbread houses started in Germany in the early 1800s. According to certain researchers, the first gingerbread houses were the result of the well-known Grimm&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; in which the two children abandoned in the forest found an edible house made of bread with sugar decorations. After this book was published, German bakers began baking ornamented fairy-tale houses of lebkuchen (gingerbread). These became popular during Christmas, a tradition that came to America with Pennsylvanian German immigrants. According to other food historians, the Grimm brothers were speaking about something that already existed.

==Modern times==


In modern times, the tradition has continued in certain places in Europe. In Germany, Christmas markets sell decorated gingerbread before Christmas. (&quot;Lebkuchenhaus&quot; or &quot;Pfefferkuchenhaus&quot; are the German terms for a gingerbread house.) Making gingerbread houses is a Christmas tradition in many families. They are typically made before Christmas using pieces of baked gingerbread dough assembled with melted sugar. The roof &#x27;tiles&#x27; can consist of frosting or candy. The gingerbread house yard is usually decorated with icing to represent snow.

A gingerbread house does not have to be an actual house, although it is the most common. It can be anything from a castle to a small cabin, or another kind of building, such as a church, an art museum, or a sports stadium, and other items, such as cars, gingerbread men and gingerbread women, can be made of gingerbread dough.

In most cases, royal icing is used as an adhesive to secure the main parts of the house, as it can be made quickly and forms a secure bond when set.

In Sweden, gingerbread houses are prepared on Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day. Since 1991, the people of Bergen, Norway, have built a city of gingerbread houses each year before Christmas. Named &quot;Pepperkakebyen&quot; (Norwegian for &quot;the gingerbread village&quot;), it is claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest such city. Every child under the age of 12 can make their own house at no cost with the help of their parents. In 2009, the gingerbread city was destroyed in an act of vandalism. A group of building design, construction, and sales professionals in Washington, D.C., also collaborate on a themed &quot;Gingertown&quot; every year.

In the United States, the National Gingerbread House Competition began in 1992 at the Grove Park Inn in Asheville, North Carolina. In San Francisco, the Fairmont and St. Francis hotels display rival gingerbread houses during the Christmas season.

==Guinness World records==

In 2013, a group in Bryan, Texas, US, broke the Guinness World Record set the previous year for the largest gingerbread house, with a edible-walled house in aid of a hospital trauma centre. The gingerbread house had an estimated calorific value exceeding 35.8 million and ingredients included of brown sugar, of butter, 7,200 eggs and of general purpose flour.

The executive sous-chef at the New York Marriott Marquis hotel, Jon Lovitch, broke the record for the largest gingerbread village with 135 residential and 22 commercial buildings, and cable cars and a train also made of gingerbread. It was displayed at the New York Hall of Science. Another contender from Bergen, Norway made a gingerbread town called &quot;Pepperkakebyen.&quot;

<text>In geometry, the gyroelongated pentagonal cupolarotunda is one of the Johnson solids (). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a pentagonal cupolarotunda ( or ) by inserting a decagonal antiprism between its two halves.

The gyroelongated pentagonal cupolarotunda is one of five Johnson solids which are chiral, meaning that they have a &quot;left-handed&quot; and a &quot;right-handed&quot; form. In the illustration to the right, each pentagonal face on the bottom half of the figure is connected by a path of two triangular faces to a square face above it and to the left. In the figure of opposite chirality (the mirror image of the illustrated figure), each bottom pentagon would be connected to a square face above it and to the right. The two chiral forms of are not considered different Johnson solids.

<doc id="1200025" wikidata="Q533140" url="?curid=1200025" title="Hurry-up offense">
<text>The hurry-up offense is an American football offensive style, which has two different but related forms in which the offensive team avoids delays between plays. The hurry-up, no-huddle offense (HUNH) refers to avoiding or shortening the huddle to limit or disrupt defensive strategies and flexibility. The two-minute drill is a clock-management strategy that may limit huddles but also emphasizes plays that stop the game clock. While the two-minute drill refers to parts of the game with little time remaining on the game clock, the no-huddle may be used in some form at any time. The no-huddle offense was pioneered by the Cincinnati Bengals and reached its most famous and complete usage by the Buffalo Bills, nicknamed the &quot;K-Gun&quot;, during the 1990s under head coach Marv Levy and offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda. Coach Gus Malzahn was known for helping popularize this offense style of combining both the hurry-up and no-huddle offenses, publishing a book called &quot;The Hurry-Up, No Huddle: An Offensive Philosophy&quot; (2003). He helped pioneer and popularize it at the high school and collegiate levels through his success with the style.

==No-huddle offense==
The no-huddle offense is usually employed as part of a hurry-up offense, but it is not necessarily an attempt to snap the ball (begin the play) more quickly. Rather, the lack of huddle allows the offense to &quot;threaten&quot; to snap the ball quickly, denying the defending team time to substitute players and communicate effectively between coaches and players. When operating in the no-huddle, the offense typically lines up in a predetermined formation at scrimmage, possibly with a predetermined play in mind. The quarterback may then call an audible, altering the play call based on a perceived weakness in the defense&#x27;s response. Some teams use this methodology to react to the defense and will remain at this pre-snap state for a considerable time as the clock runs down, providing a stream of actual and counterfeit play changes. Between 2007 and 2012, the use of the no-huddle offense in the NFL increased 100%.

===Development as a standard method===
The hurry-up offense is nearly as old as football itself. Huddles used to not exist. Michigan coach Fielding Yost was known as &quot;Hurry up;&quot; as he had Bennie Owen call signals for the next play even while still lying beneath the tackle pile from the previous snap. John Heisman&#x27;s 1899 Auburn Tigers team was noted for its speed.

The first team to employ a version of the no-huddle approach as the normal offensive play strategy was the 1988 Cincinnati Bengals under Sam Wyche with Boomer Esiason as the quarterback. This approach, called the &quot;attack offense&quot;, involved a number of strategies including shortened huddles and huddling much closer to the line of scrimmage than usual. The no-huddle approach was used by many teams before but in specific situations for a limited time. This strategy proved to be very effective in limiting substitutions, creating fatigue in the opposing defense, creating play-calling issues for the defense, and various other advantages. The Bengals&#x27; regular employment of this offense was extremely effective. The employment of this version of the &quot;no-huddle&quot; propelled the Bengals to their second appearance in the Super Bowl.

The Buffalo Bills, defeated in the AFC Championship game by the &quot;no-huddle&quot; Bengals, soon adopted this approach. Under head coach Marv Levy and offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda, the Bills were the first team to truly adopt the no-huddle offense, and with Jim Kelly quarterbacking the no-huddle &quot;K-Gun&quot; offense, the Bills became the only team in NFL history to appear in four consecutive Super Bowls, from 1991–1994. The Bills are considered the only team to ever use the no-huddle offense consistently and completely throughout an entire game for several seasons. This means that the &quot;K-Gun&quot; offense always used the scheme as their primary offensive philosophy. Quarterback Jim Kelly would call and signal the plays himself on the field throughout the entire game. That is a unique achievement that has never been truly duplicated, therefore, the &quot;K-Gun&quot; offense earned a reputation as the most famous and complete hurry-up offense in football. The &quot;K-Gun&quot; offense is commonly thought to be named after quarterback Jim Kelly, but was actually named for Keith McKeller, a , dual-threat tight end. McKeller was an exceptionally fast and agile tight end, and due to coaches and teammates saying he had &quot;killer speed&quot;, his nickname on the Bills was &quot;Killer&quot;, which was the source of the &quot;K&quot; in &quot;K-Gun&quot;.

In recent times Peyton Manning, with the Indianapolis Colts and later the Denver Broncos, was best known for this technique, frequently changing the play at the line of scrimmage depending on the coverage that he saw from the opposing defense.

In 2013, Chip Kelly became head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and adapted the hurry-up offense that he used effectively at Oregon to the NFL. During the 2014 season, the Eagles averaged around 22 seconds per play, which is the fastest time of any NFL team since this statistic has been kept.

In the college game, the hurry-up/no-huddle was employed several times successfully by Auburn coach Gus Malzahn to defeat Nick Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide. Saban grew frustrated and tried to have the game slowed down to allow his defense to sub players, to no avail. Eventually, Saban had to learn to run the Malzahn offense himself.

===Differences between the NFL and college approaches===
While several NFL teams have begun using the offense in various ways, many college football programs have used the no-huddle or hurry-up as a way to gain an advantage when lacking talent in comparison to the teams they are playing. One twist on this approach is that often a college team will hurry-up to the line of scrimmage and line up in a set formation. Based on what the defense is showing in terms of alignment, the quarterback has the option of calling the determined play at the line of scrimmage or stepping back and looking towards the sidelines where the head coach or an assistant will relay a better play to attack the coverage the defense is showing. The Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL have also used this technique with a coach on the sideline telling their quarterback, via the radio receiver in his helmet, information on the defensive alignment; the radio is operative up until 15 seconds on the play clock and hence is only suitable for use when a fast hurry-up offense is used.

==Two-minute drill==
The two-minute drill is a high-pressure and fast-paced situational strategy where a team will focus on clock management, maximizing the number of plays available for a scoring attempt before a half (or game) expires. The tactics employed during this time involve managing players, substitutions, time-outs, and clock-stopping plays to get as many plays in as possible. In the first half, either team may employ the two-minute drill; however, near the end of the game, only a team tied or losing employs the strategy. Most famously, the two-minute drill references end-of-game drives by a team tied or trailing by one possession.

The two-minute drill is named for the point in the game, frequently after the two minute warning, when it is employed. If significantly more time remains, a team&#x27;s standard strategies are still viable; if significantly less, a team has little option beyond a Hail Mary pass or the hook and lateral.

Play calling during the two-minute drill emphasizes high probabilities of significant yardage gains or clock stoppages. To help control the clock, teams tend to pass rather than run and to pass near the sidelines rather than the middle of the field. The former provides for incomplete passes while the latter allows the receiver to run out of bounds, both stopping the clock. When plays that do not stop the clock occur, the offense relies on a combination of hurry-up plays and spiking the football – a play where the quarterback stops the clock by immediately throwing the ball into the ground (sacrificing a down by doing so) – and time-outs to minimize time lost. Previously, in college football, the offense was able to temporarily stop the clock by gaining a first down. Due to a rule change beginning in the 2023 season, the clock will now run after gaining a first down, except for the last two minutes of each half.

Finally, as the offense gets closer to scoring, their clock management stance may shift towards running out the clock in an effort to deny the opponent their own opportunity for a two-minute drill.

<text>The High Plains Reader is an alternative newspaper serving the Fargo metropolitan area, with an estimated readership of 20,000 to 30,000 weekly between print and online readers. The tabloid was founded in 1994 by Ian Swanson, Peter Ryan, and Len Schmid in Grand Forks, North Dakota and is currently owned by Raul Gomez and John Strand who purchased the paper in late December 1996. After a flood and fire destroyed their Grand Forks office, the &quot;Reader&quot; moved its office to Fargo. In 2004, the &quot;Reader&quot; celebrated its 10th anniversary in different venues in the Fargo-Moorhead area, including Ralph&#x27;s Corner Bar. Distribution ended in the Grand Forks area in 2009. In 2014, HPR celebrated 20 years.

==Features==
The paper features reviews of bands, movies, and theater in Fargo-Moorhead, plus a calendar of weekly events. Its editorials generally take a more leftist tack than those of &quot;The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead&quot;.

Recurring portions of the &quot;High Plains Reader&quot; include the weekly editorial, written by Editor Sabrina Hornung, photojournalist and news editor C.S. Christopher Hagen, or Co-owner John Strand; the cover story; features; opinion; wellness; a theater column; movie reviews by Greg Carlson; a Best Bets section, generally giving brief synopses of upcoming events, focusing mostly on local musicians; and a calendar section, a detailed list of daily events for the upcoming week.

==Controversy==
The &quot;Reader&quot; began carrying Allison Moorhead&#x27;s sex column in late 2004, which had a controversial and short run at North Dakota State University&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Spectrum&quot;. Longtime HPR contributor Ed Raymond withdrew his &quot;The Gadfly&quot; column in protest.

The column offered general information about sexual activities, including accounts of the writer&#x27;s own, rather than a question-and-answer format. Moorhead stopped writing for the &quot;Reader&quot; in early 2005. Ed Raymond returned to writing his column the following June.

<text>A bombsite is the wreckage that remains after a bomb has destroyed a building or other structure.

==World War II bombsites==
After World War II many European cities remained severely damaged from bombing. London and other British cities which had suffered the Blitz were pock-marked with bombsites, vacant lots covered in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Many postwar children in urban areas shared a common memory of playing their games and riding their bicycles across these desolate environments. There were often abandoned bombshelters of the &#x27;Anderson&#x27; type nearby.

In London, Liverpool, Bristol, etc., across the channel in Berlin and other places these sites were constant reminders of the death and destruction of the war. This was a contributory factor to the European psycho-sociological outlook of the 1950s and 1960s. The German city of Dresden suffered a previously unprecedented level of destruction.

==In literature and media==
The rubble of Viennese bombsites and the remnants of the city&#x27;s battered infrastructure serve as a backdrop to much of the action in the movie &quot;The Third Man&quot;, written by Graham Greene, an author who would return to this bombsite motif again in his 1954 short story &quot;The Destructors&quot;.

<text>Belopolskiy is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the west of the crater Houzeau, and northeast of Strömgren. Just to the northwest of Belopolskiy is the crater Ioffe.

The rim of Belopolskiy is somewhat eroded, particularly at the southern end where several small craterlets have worn away the rim edge. There is a slight intrusion in the northwestern rim where the ground has been modified by neighbouring Ioffe. The crater interior is relatively level, and marked with several tiny craterlets.

<text>Diplacus aurantiacus, the sticky monkey-flower or orange bush monkey-flower, is a flowering plant that grows in a subshrub form, native to southwestern North America from southwestern Oregon south through most of California. It is a member of the lopseed family, Phrymaceae. It was formerly known as &quot;Mimulus aurantiacus&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Diplacus aurantiacus&quot; grows up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall, has deep green, sticky leaves 3 to 7 centimeters long and up to a centimeter broad and flowering stems that grow vertically. The flowers are tubular at the base and about 2 centimeters long with five broad lobes; they occur in a variety of shades from white to red, the most common color being a light orange. They are honey plants pollinated by bees and hummingbirds.

It grows in many climates and will thrive in many types of soil, wet, dry, sandy, or rocky. It even grows in serpentine, a soil that most plants have difficulty thriving in because of its unique mineral composition.

&quot;Diplacus aurantiacus&quot; is an important host plant for the larvae of the common buckeye butterfly (&quot;Junonia coenia&quot;) and the variable checkerspot (&quot;Euphydryas chalcedona&quot;), despite a phenolic resin in the leaves which deter its feeding. This resin also helps the plant retain water in dry environments.

==Cultivation==
This bushy evergreen shrub can be short-lived in cultivation. The species and its cultivars are used in water conserving, native plant, and habitat gardens. It is often grown under glass in temperate zones.
In the UK it has won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Traditional Native American medical plant==
The Miwok and Pomo Native Americans used the plant to treat minor ailments such as sores, burns, diarrhea, and eye irritation. They used the colorful flowers for decorative purposes.

==Ecology==
Diplacus aurantiacus supports multiple species of caterpillars, including the Variable Checkerspot, and also supports hummingbirds.

<text>Recording consciousness as described by Bennett (1980, p. 114) is the consequence of &quot;a society which is literally wired for sound&quot; in which, according to Middleton (1990, p. 88) &quot;this consciousness defines the social reality of popular music.&quot;

==Overview==
&quot;Acoustic instruments and unamplified, &#x27;pure&#x27;-tone singing can now not be heard except as contrasts to more recent kinds of sounds, just as live performances are inevitably &#x27;checked&#x27; against memories of recordings,&quot; and &quot;live performances have to try to approximate the sounds which inhabit this consciousness.&quot;

&quot;Similarly, musicians learn to play, and learn specific songs, from records, and so &#x27;recording consciousness&#x27; helps to explain the ubiquity of non-literate composition methods: &#x27;sheet music is just for people who can&#x27;t hear&#x27; (musician quoted in Bennett 1980, p. 139) The structure of this consciousness has been produced by various elements, among them experience of editing techniques, reverberation and echo, use of equalization to alter timbre, high decibel levels, both in general and in particular parts of the texture (notably, strong bass-lines), and the &#x27;polyvocality&#x27; created by multi-mike or multi-channel recording. Mixing different &#x27;earpoints&#x27; produces a &#x27;way of hearing [that] is an acoustic expectation for anyone who listens to contemporary recordings. It cannot be achieved without the aid of electronic devices. It has never before existed on earth&#x27; (ibid, p. 119).&quot; (Middleton 1990, p. 88)

<text>Bjerknes is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the rugged far side of the Moon. The crater lies behind the southeastern limb, and beyond the region that is sometimes brought into sight through libration. Thus this crater can not be viewed from Earth, and has only been seen from orbit. Nearby named craters are Clark to the east, and Pogson to the south-southwest.

The crater rim is generally circular, but with some slight irregularities along the northeastern quadrant. The rim is relatively sharp-edged, and displays little appearance of wear. The interior floor is rough and irregular, beginning with the slumped material at the base of the inner walls.

The crater is named in honor of Vilhelm Bjerknes, a pioneer in the field of weather forecasting.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bjerknes.

<text>The Nieuwe Kerk (, ) is a 15th-century church in Amsterdam located on Dam Square, next to the Royal Palace. Formerly a Dutch Reformed Church parish, it now belongs to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands.

==Current uses==
The Nieuwe Kerk is no longer used for church services but is used as an exhibition space. It is also used for organ recitals. There is a café in one of the buildings attached to the church that has an entrance to the church (during opening hours). There is a museum store inside the entrance that sells postcards, books, and gifts having to do with the church and its exhibitions.

The church is used for Dutch royal investiture ceremonies (as per Article 32 of the Dutch Constitution) most recently that of King Willem-Alexander in 2013, as well as royal weddings, most recently the wedding of Willem-Alexander to Máxima in 2002. The investitures of Queens Wilhelmina, Juliana and Beatrix also took place there.

==History==
After the Oude Kerk (&quot;Old Church&quot;) grew too small for the expanding population of the town, the bishop of Utrecht gave permission to build a second parish church, the Nieuwe Kerk (&quot;New Church&quot;). Construction began in 1380 and finished in 1408. This new church was consecrated in 1409 to St. Mary and St. Catherine, and the first services were held in 1410.

The church was damaged by the city fires of 1421 and 1452 and burned down almost entirely in 1645, after which it was rebuilt in Gothic style. In 1578 the building became a Dutch Reformed church. It underwent major renovation in 1892–1914, which added many neo-Gothic details, and was again renovated in 1959–80. The second renovation proved expensive for the Dutch Reformed Church, forcing the church to be closed most of the time in order to save money on maintenance. To keep the church open, ownership was transferred in 1979 to a newly formed cultural foundation called the Nationale Stichting De Nieuwe Kerk.

== Notable interments ==
The Nieuwe Kerk is a burial site for Dutch naval heroes, including Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, Commodore Jan van Galen, and lieutenant commander Jan van Speyk. Despite being Roman Catholic, the poet and playwright Joost van den Vondel is buried in the church.

<doc id="1200054" wikidata="Q3241463" url="?curid=1200054" title="Battle royal">
<text>Battle royal (, also battle royale) traditionally refers to a fight involving many combatants, usually conducted under either boxing or wrestling rules, where the winner is the one who registers the most wins. In recent times, the term has been used more generally to refer to any fight involving large numbers of people who are not organized into factions. Within combat sports and professional wrestling, the term has a more specific meaning.

Outside sports, the term battle royale has taken on a new meaning in the 21st century, from Koushun Takami&#x27;s 1999 Japanese dystopian novel &quot;Battle Royale&quot; and its 2000 film adaptation of the same name, referring to a fictional narrative genre and/or mode of entertainment also known as death games and killing games, where a select group of people is instructed to hunt and kill one another in a large arena until there is only one survivor.

==Sports==
===Historical uses===
In 18th century England, bare-knuckle boxing conducted according to Jack Broughton&#x27;s rules included matches involving eight fighters. Referred to as &quot;Broughton&#x27;s Battle Royals&quot;, these events were spoofed in political cartoons of the era. The practice eventually fell out of favor in the United Kingdom, but it continued in the American colonies. Lower-class white people who lived in the backcountry practiced &quot;free-for-all&quot; as well as rough-and-tumble fighting. The practice also spread to American enslaved people, who held mass fights as a form of entertainment. Frederick Douglass wrote that such distractions, as well as the consumption of alcohol, were &quot;among the most effective in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection.&quot;

After the American Civil War, the battle royal became even more popular, but the events were also increasingly considered shameful and disreputable. Promoters of boxing events arranged for brutal free-for-alls with few rules, generally between black boxers. The audience for these spectacles was almost always white, unlike the pre-war entertainment within the enslaved communities. A battle royal was a frequent opening event for boxing and wrestling shows from 1870 to 1910. They originated and were most popular in the Southern United States but eventually spread to the North. However, the events fell out of favor, especially in the North. In New York, the State Athletic Commission banned battles royal in 1911. They continued in the South from the 1910s to the 1950s but with less popularity. The 1952 novel &quot;Invisible Man&quot; by Ralph Ellison contains a depiction of a battle royal. By the 1960s, battles royal had been banned in the South.

The battle royal was a way for an aspiring boxer to get noticed, and successful battle royal champions gained enough prestige to participate in more respectable boxing matches. Jack Johnson, Joe Gans, and Beau Jack are three successful boxers who started out in battles royal.

===Professional wrestling===
In professional wrestling, the battle royal is a match involving anywhere between four and sixty wrestlers that takes place entirely inside the ring—a wrestler is eliminated when someone scores a pin against them or knocks them out, but there are rarely submissions. Some promotions allow over-the-top rope eliminations or enforce them exclusively, notably battles royal in the WWE, including in their annual Royal Rumble. Battle royals are often used to determine the top contender for a championship or to fill vacant championships.

World Championship Wrestling was known for having the largest battle royal in wrestling, held annually at their WCW World War 3 pay-per-view events. The three-ring, sixty-wrestler events consisted of all sixty wrestlers parading to the ring (usually without formal introductions to save time) and beginning to fight at the bell. Once the number of wrestlers in each ring was down to a number suitable for a single ring, the wrestlers would all move to the designated &quot;Ring #1&quot; out of the three and fight until there was a winner. The winners of the four World War 3 battles royal were Randy Savage, The Giant, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash.

World Championship Wrestling also held an event called Battlebowl in which 20 men started in one ring and would have to throw the others into a second ring. From that ring, they would be thrown to the floor for elimination. The last man in ring one would rest until one was left in ring two. Those two men would battle until one man was left and declared the winner. In 1991, Sting won the match after it came down to him and Lex Luger. Every year thereafter, Battle Bowl took place with only one ring and a normal battle royal. The entrants were decided through tag-team matches consisting of randomly selected partners, where the winning team would advance to the BattleBowl, called a &quot;Lethal Lottery&quot; by WCW, due to the potentiality of rivals being forced to work as a team.

Numerous variations of the battle royale also exist, including:
* World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s Royal Rumble: an over-the-top-rope elimination match that starts with two competitors and adds a new competitor every two minutes, usually up to a total of thirty entrants, with the final remaining competitor being the winner.
* Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s Gauntlet for the Gold: an over-the-top-rope elimination match in which the final two competitors face off in a singles match.
* Tag Team Battle Royal: a standard battle royal in which teams of two, three, or four combatants compete for group victory. Variations have been used in both WCW and TNA.
* All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s Royal Rampage: an over-the-top-rope elimination match that involves two rings and, as of 2022, twenty competitors. It was loosely based on WCW&#x27;s World War 3 matches.

==Battle royale genre==
In the 21st century, the 2000 Japanese film &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, itself based on the 1999 novel of the same name, redefined the term &quot;battle royale&quot; in popular culture. The term &quot;battle royale&quot; has since been used to refer to a fictional narrative genre where a select group of people is instructed to kill one another until there is one survivor. The &quot;battle royale&quot; phenomenon became especially popular in the 2010s. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; set out the basic rules of the genre, including players being forced to kill each other until there is a single survivor and the need to scavenge for weapons and items. The &quot;battle royale&quot; concept first gained mainstream popularity in Japan, where &quot;Battle Royale&quot; inspired a wave of manga, anime, and visual novel works during the 2000s, before the concept gained global mainstream popularity in the 2010s.

<text>Bolyai is an old lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. To the southeast of Bolyai is the crater Eötvös, and to the north is Neujmin. It is named after the 19th century Hungarian mathematician János Bolyai.

This crater has been heavily eroded and worn by subsequent impacts, leaving only a deformed remnant of the original rim that is overlaid by a multitude of lesser craters. The most notable of these is Bolyai D along the northeast rim and Bolyai W to the northwest. The latter is actually a formation of multiply overlapping craters.

The interior of the crater is relatively level, but rough in places due to impacts that have reshaped the surface. Near the rounded central peak, and from there towards the northern rim, is a section of floor that has been resurfaced by lava flows. This area is smoother than the remainder of the floor, and has a lower albedo, giving it a dark appearance.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bolyai.

<doc id="1200059" wikidata="Q5461513" url="?curid=1200059" title="Florida Midland Railroad (current)">
<text>The Florida Midland Railroad Company, Inc. is one of several short line railroads operated by Regional Rail, LLC in Florida (along with the Florida Central Railroad and the Florida Northern Railroad). The Florida Midland Railroad operates two former CSX Transportation railroad lines including their former Lake Wales Subdivision (running from West Lake Wales to Frostproof), and their former Bartow Subdivision (from Winter Haven to a point just northwest of Bartow). It once had a third line from Wildwood to Leesburg that is now mostly abandoned. Florida Midland Railroad began operating the lines in 1987 and uses locomotives branded for the Florida Central Railroad, its sister railroad.

In November 2019, former owner Pinsly Railroad Company sold the Florida Midland, along with the Florida Central Railroad and Florida Northern Railroad, to 3i RR Holdings GP, LLC and subsidiaries (d.b.a. &quot;Regional Rail, LLC&quot;).

==Lake Wales Line==

The line from West Lake Wales to Frostproof, which extends a distance of about 18 miles, branches off of CSX&#x27;s Auburndale Subdivision in West Lake Wales. It proceeds east to Lake Wales along a former Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) line. In Lake Wales, the line turns north and connects with the north-south segment of the line, which is a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) line. From here, the line continues south for the remaining 14 miles to Frostproof. Since the junction between the two segments in Lake Wales is oriented north, a run-around track just before the junction is used to move locomotives to the opposite end of the trains. Trains are then backed onto the north-south segment so they can proceed south with the locomotive on the front.

The line notably serves citrus fields and a Lowe&#x27;s distribution center at the terminus in Frostproof.

The interchange between CSX and the Florida Midland takes place on a small yard track in West Lake Wales. The Florida Midland Railroad also has trackage rights on a small section of CSX&#x27;s Auburndale Subdivision to facilitate the interchange. 

===History===
The east-west segment of the line was built by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1916, which was part of a line that originally extended from Bartow and continued west to Alcoma, Hesperides, and Walinwa. The north-south segment of the line from Lake Wales south to Frostproof was built earlier in 1912 by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. It is a discontinuous segment of track that was once the Atlantic Coast Line&#x27;s Haines City Branch, which historically extended as far south as Everglades City. 

The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line merged in 1967 into the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, which led to consolidation of the two networks and the abandonment of redundant trackage in the 1970s, reducing the line to its current length. Seaboard Coast Line became CSX in 1980, six years before Florida Midland Railroad began operating over the line.

==Winter Haven Line==

The Florida Midland Railroad also operates a separate 6-mile line in Winter Haven. It branches off CSX&#x27;s Auburndale Subdivision just south of Winter Haven Amtrak station (about 10 miles north of where the Lake Wales Line branches off the same line). From Winter Haven, it runs southwest to Gordonville (just northeast of Bartow) where it ends. The line notably serves a 24-acre transload facility in Eagle Lake, as well as Bartow Municipal Airport.

The Florida Midland Railroad has trackage rights on the Auburndale Subdivision to Winter Haven siding to facilitate the interchange between the two companies.

===History===
The Winter Haven line was originally built in 1884 by the South Florida Railroad (later part of the Plant System and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad). It historically extended from the South Florida Railroad mainline (the current CSX A Line) in Lake Alfred and extended into Bartow. It was abandoned north of Winter Haven to Lake Alfred in the early 1970s and was connected to the current Auburndale Subdivision (a former Seaboard track). The line was severed from Bartow in the 1980s and it now terminates near Gordonville.

==Former Leesburg Line==
The Florida Midland Railroad once operated a third line from Wildwood to Leesburg. Most of the Leesburg line was once the westernmost segment of the Orlando Division of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad (later part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad). The easternmost two miles however were originally part of the Florida Southern Railway (later part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad). In 2000, the company petitioned the Surface Transportation Board to abandon the entire Leesburg Branch, which was granted on November 15, 2000. All that remains of the line is a short turning wye in Wildwood.

<text>Tara (, ; , ), Ārya Tārā (Noble Tara), also known as Jetsün Dölma (Tibetan: &quot;rje btsun sgrol ma,&quot; meaning: &quot;Venerable Mother of Liberation&quot;), is an important female Buddha in Buddhism, especially revered in Vajrayana Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism. She may appear as a female bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism. In Vajrayana Buddhism, Green Tara is a female Buddha who is a consort of Amoghasiddhi Buddha. Tārā is also known as a saviouress who hears the cries of beings in saṃsāra and saves them from worldly and spiritual danger.

In Vajrayana, she is considered to be a Buddha, and the &quot;Tārā Tantra&quot; describes her as &quot;a mother who gives birth to the buddhas of the three times&quot; who is also &quot;beyond saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.&quot; She is one of the most important female deities in Vajrayana and is found in sources like the &quot;Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa&quot;, and the &quot;Guhyasamāja Tantra&quot;. Key Indic Vajrayana texts which focus on Tārā include the &quot;Tantra Which is the Source for All the Functions of Tārā, Mother of All the Tathagatas&quot; (Skt. &quot;Sarvatathāgatamātṛtārāviśvakarmabhavanāmatantra&quot;) and &quot;Tārā’s Fundamental Ritual Text&quot; (&quot;Tārāmūlakalpa&quot;).

Both Green and White Tārā remain popular meditation deities or yidams in Tibetan Buddhism, and Tara is also revered in Newar Buddhism. Tārā is considered to have many forms or emanations, while Green Tara emanates &quot;twenty-one Tārās&quot;, each with different attributes—colors, implements, and activities such as pacifying (&quot;śānti&quot;), increasing (&quot;pauṣṭika&quot;), enthralling (&quot;vaśīkaraṇa&quot;), and wrathful (&quot;abhicāra&quot;). The Green Tara (or &quot;blue-green&quot;, Skt. &quot;Samayatara&quot; or &quot;śyāmatārā&quot;) remains the most important form of the deity in Tibetan Buddhism. A practice text entitled &quot;Praises to the Twenty-One Taras&quot; is a well known text on Tara in Tibetan Buddhism and in Tibet, recited by children and adults, and is the textual source for the twenty-one forms of Green Tārā.

The main Tārā mantra is the same for Buddhists and Hindus alike: . It is pronounced by Tibetans and Buddhists who follow the Tibetan culture as . The literal translation would be &quot;Oṃ O Tārā, I pray O Tārā, O Swift One, So Be It!&quot;

==Etymology==
&quot;Tārā&quot; (Devanagari: ) is a feminine noun derived from the root &quot;√tṝ&quot;, &quot;to cross.&quot; It is causative, and as such means &quot;to cause to cross,&quot; i.e., &quot;to rescue.&quot;

This is why the name is sometimes translated as &quot;savioress&quot; or &quot;rescuer&quot;. For example, in Tibetan, she is known as &quot;Jetsun&quot; &quot;Drölma&quot; ( , Wylie: rje btsun sgrol ba), meaning &quot;Venerable Saviour&quot; which is derived from the Tibetan verb &quot;sgrol ba&quot; meaning &quot;to save, rescue, liberate; to carry, transport, or cross; and to expel or drive away [evil]&quot;.

The name &quot;Tārā&quot; may also mean &quot;star&quot; or &quot;planet&quot; (since they are celestial bodies which cross the sky and are thus literally &quot;crossers&quot;).

In East Asian Buddhism she is known as (Pinyin&quot;: Duōluó Púsà&quot;), with &quot;Púsà&quot; indicating bodhisattva status. In Japanese she is &quot;Tara Bosatsu.&quot; The name means &quot;Bodhisattva who catches many&quot; or &quot;Bodhisattva who collects numerous [sentient beings]&quot;, derived from the characters: , &quot;to catch, gather, collect, sift,&quot; and &quot;many; much; a lot of; numerous&quot;.

==History==


Buddhist studies scholars generally agree that the worship of Tārā began growing in popularity in India during the 6th century. Evidence from Nalanda shows that her cult was established by the sixth century. In the earliest sources, Tārā is seen as the personification of Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s compassion. She often appears as part of a triad, with Avalokiteśvara and Bhr̥kuṭī, as can be seen in the Kānherī cave 90 (sixth-century ce). Another early identifiable image of Tārā is found at cave 6 within the rock-cut Buddhist monastic complex of the Ellora Caves in Maharashtra (). Her worship was well established by the onset of the Pala Empire in Eastern India (8th century CE).

One of the earliest textual references to the goddess is the &quot;Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa&quot; (–8th centuries CE), which calls her the noble goddess who is the compassion of Avalokiteśvara (devīmāryāvalokiteśvarakaruṇāṃ). This text also goes on to call her “the mother of the illustrious Prince Mañjughoṣa”, giving her the title of a mātā devī (mother goddess) and associates her with Prajñāpāramitā and Prajñāpāramitā Devī. 

The origin of Tārā is unclear and remains a source of inquiry among scholars. Mallar Ghosh believes her to have originated as a form of the goddess Durga. Tārā is worshiped both in Buddhism as well as in Shaktism (Hinduism) as one of the ten Mahavidyas. According to Beyer, the enlightened feminine makes its first appearance in Mahayana Buddhism as Prajñāpāramitā Devi, the personified Perfection of Wisdom, who is also called mother of Buddhas. 

Tara eventually came to be considered the &quot;Mother of all Buddhas&quot; by Indian tantric Buddhists, taking on this epithet from Prajñaparamita. The term mother of Buddhas usually refers to a transcendent awakened wisdom, though it also echoes the ancient Indian motif of the Mother Goddess (Devi Mata).

With the composition of the &quot;Tārā-mūla-kalpa&quot;, the main Buddhist tantra associated with the goddess and mahāvidyā, Tārā became a very popular Vajrayana deity in north India. Tārā worship also spread to other parts of India, as well as to Nepal, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, where depictions of the deity have been discovered by archeologists. With the movement of Indian Buddhism into Tibet, the worship and practices of Tārā became incorporated into Tibetan Buddhism as well. 

As the worship of Tārā developed, various prayers, chants and mantras became associated with her. These came out of a felt devotional need, and from her inspiration causing spiritual masters to compose sadhanas, stotras, or tantric meditations.

Independent of whether she is classified as a deity, a Buddha, or a bodhisattva, Tārā remains very popular in Tibet (and Tibetan communities in exile in Northern India), Mongolia, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim and is worshiped in many Buddhist communities throughout the world (though in East Asian Buddhism, Guanyin is the most popular female deity). In Tibet, Green Tārā was also considered to have manifested as the Nepalese Princess (Bhrikuti), and White Tārā&#x27;s manifestation as the Chinese princess Kongjo (Princess Wencheng).

==Origin myth==
Tārā has many origin stories which explain her origin as a bodhisattva. According to one story, Tārā arose from Avalokiteshvara&#x27;s compassionate tears when he wept on seeing all the suffering of all the beings in samsara. His tears turned into a lotus, out of which Tārā arose.

The Indian master Sūryagupta explains this myth as follows:

What was Her origin? - Arya-Lokesvara, the Lord and Refuge of the Three Realms, Desire, Form, and Formless, which depend on the five or [in the Formless Realm] four aggregates that perish in an instant, saw that however many migrating beings he removed from samsara, they grew no fewer, and He wept. Tara sprang from the opening filaments of his face - of an utpala (blue lotus) that grew in the water of His tears.

Another tale begins with a young princess who lives in a different world system, millions of years in the past. Her name is Jñanachandra or Yeshe Dawa, which means &quot;Moon of Primordial Awareness&quot;. For quite a number of aeons she makes offerings to the Buddha of that world system, whose name was Tonyo Drupa. She receives special instruction from him concerning bodhicitta—the infinitely compassionate mental state of a bodhisattva. After doing this, some monks approach her and suggest that because of her level of attainment she should next pray to be reborn as a male to progress further.

At this point she lets the monks know in no uncertain terms that it is only &quot;weak minded worldlings&quot; who see gender as a barrier to attaining enlightenment. She sadly notes there have been few who wish to work for the welfare of sentient beings in a female form, though. Therefore, she resolves to always be reborn as a female bodhisattva, until samsara is no more. She then stays in a palace in a state of meditation for some ten million years, and the power of this practice releases tens of millions of beings from suffering. As a result of this, Tonyo Drupa tells her she will henceforth manifest supreme bodhi as the Goddess Tārā in many world systems to come.

A similar story is told by the 14th Dalai Lama:There is a true feminist movement in Buddhism that relates to the goddess Tārā. Following her cultivation of bodhicitta, the bodhisattva&#x27;s motivation, she looked upon the situation of those striving towards full awakening and she felt that there were too few people who attained Buddhahood as women. So she vowed, &quot;I have developed bodhicitta as a woman. For all my lifetimes along the path I vow to be born as a woman, and in my final lifetime when I attain Buddhahood, then, too, I will be a woman.Tārā, then, embodies certain ideals which make her attractive to women practitioners, and her emergence as a Bodhisattva can be seen as a part of Mahayana Buddhism&#x27;s reaching out to women, and becoming more inclusive even in 6th-century CE India.

==Symbols and associations==

Tārā&#x27;s name literally means &quot;star&quot; or &quot;planet&quot;, and therefore she is associated with navigation and travel both literally and metaphorically as spiritual crossing to the &quot;other side&quot; of the ocean of existence (enlightenment). Hence she is known literally as &quot;she who saves&quot; in Tibetan. In the &quot;108 Names of the Holy Tara&quot;, Tara is &quot;Leader of the caravans ... who showeth the way to those who have lost it&quot; and she is named as &quot;Dhruva&quot;, the Sanskrit name for the North Star. Due to her association with navigation and travel, she is thus popular as a savior and protector from danger. In modern Tibetan Buddhism, Tārā is one of the most popular deities which are appealed to by laypersons and monastics alike for aid.

Tara&#x27;s main form is depicted as dark green in color, which is associated with awakened activity. In Himalayan Buddhist iconography, each color is typically associated with a specific kind of activity (for example white is pacification and red is power). Because dark green is seen as a combination of all other colors, the main form of Tārā, Green Tārā, is considered to be the source of all beneficial activities.

Within Tibetan Buddhism, Tārā appears in many forms, each tied to certain colors, symbols, and beneficial activities. As Green Tārā she offers succor and protection from all the unfortunate circumstances one can encounter in the world of suffering. As White Tārā she expresses maternal compassion and offers healing to beings who are hurt or wounded, either mentally or psychically. White Tara is further associated with longevity, countering illness, and purification. Red Tārā meanwhile is associated with power, controlling and influencing others as well as with the transformation of desire into compassion. The manifestation of Blue Tārā (Ekajati) is a ferocious female protector whose invocation destroys all obstacles. 

Tārā is also a forest goddess, particularly in her form as &quot;Khadiravani&quot;, &quot;dweller in the Khadira forest&quot; and is generally associated with plant life, flowers, acacia (khadira) trees and the wind. Because of her association with nature and plants, Tārā is also known as a healing goddess (especially as White Tārā) and as a goddess of nurturing quality and fertility. Her pure land, Paradise Arrayed in Turquoise Petals, in Mount Potalaka (Avalokiteshvara&#x27;s Pure Land) is described as &quot;Covered with manifold trees and creepers, resounding with the sound of many birds, And with murmur of waterfalls, thronged with wild beasts of many kinds; Many species of flowers grow everywhere.&quot; Her association with the wind element (vaayu) also means that she is swift in responding to calls for any aid.

According to Miranda Shaw, &quot;Motherhood is central to the conception of Tara&quot;. Her titles include &quot;loving mother&quot;, &quot;supreme mother&quot;, &quot;mother of the world&quot;, &quot;universal mother&quot; and &quot;mother of all Buddhas&quot;. As such, Tārā embodies many of the qualities of feminine principle. She is known as the Mother of Mercy and Compassion. She is the source, the female aspect of the universe, which gives birth to warmth, compassion and relief from bad karma as experienced by ordinary beings in cyclic existence. She engenders, nourishes, smiles at the vitality of creation, and has sympathy for all beings as a mother does for her children.

Tārā is most often shown with the blue lotus or night lotus (&quot;utpala&quot;), which releases its fragrance with the appearance of the moon and therefore Tārā is also associated with the moon and night.

=== As a popular saviour deity ===


In general, Tārā is especially seen as a savior who provides salvation and protection from the eight fears (aṣṭabhaya) or eight dangers (aṣṭaghora). This is a common theme in her iconography and she is sometimes depicted in a specific iconographical style called &quot;Tara who protects from the eight dangers&quot; (Tārāṣṭaghoratāraṇī).

According to &quot;The Noble Sūtra “Tārā Who Protects from the Eight Dangers”&quot; (*&quot;Āryatārāṣṭaghoratāraṇī­sūtra&quot;), the eight dangers (aṣṭaghora) are: lions, elephants, fire, snakes, robbers, waters, infectious diseases, and demons. This sutra also contains an incantation (dharani) which is chanted to invoke Tārā&#x27;s protection.

In Tibetan Buddhism, each of these outer dangers is also associated with an inner psychological meaning. As such, lions represent pride, wild elephants represent delusion, fires represent anger, snakes represent jealousy, bandits represent wrong views, bondage represent avarice, floods represent desire and attachment, and evil spirits and demons represent doubts.

With the development of esoteric or tantric Buddhism, two main ways of approaching Tara developed. In one, common folk and lay practitioners continued to directly appeal to her for protection and aid in worldly affairs, often chanting prayers, dharanis, or mantras to her and doing puja (worship rites). Tara&#x27;s mantra and her twenty one verses of praise are widely learned and chanted by Tibetan laypersons. Tara also became a tantric deity whose secret practices and tantric sadhanas would be used by monks and yogis in order to develop her awakened qualities in themselves, ultimately leading to Buddhahood.

Another quality which Tara shares with feminine spirits (such as dakinis) is playfulness. As John Blofeld explains in &quot;Bodhisattva of Compassion&quot;, Tārā is frequently depicted as a young sixteen-year-old girlish woman. She often manifests in the lives of dharma practitioners when they take themselves, or the spiritual path too seriously. There are Tibetan tales in which she laughs at self-righteousness, or plays pranks on those who lack reverence for the feminine. In &quot;Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis&quot;, Thinley Norbu explores this as &quot;playmind&quot;.

Applied to Tārā one could say that her playful mind can relieve ordinary minds which become rigidly serious or tightly gripped by dualistic distinctions. She takes delight in an open mind and a receptive heart then. For in this openness and receptivity her blessings can naturally unfold and her energies can quicken the aspirants spiritual development.

== In Vajrayana ==

Tārā as a focus for tantric deity yoga can be traced back to the time period of Padmasambhava. There is a Red Tārā practice which was given by Padmasambhava to Yeshe Tsogyal. He asked that she hide it as a treasure. It was not until the 20th century, that a great Nyingma lama, Apong Terton rediscovered it. It is said that this lama was reborn as Sakya Trizin, present head of the Sakyapa sect. A monk who had known Apong Terton succeeded in retransmitting it to Sakya Trizin, and the same monk also gave it to Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, who released it to his western students.

Martin Willson in &quot;In Praise of Tārā&quot; traces many different lineages of Tārā Tantras, that is Tārā scriptures used as Tantric sadhanas. For example, a Tārā sadhana was revealed to Tilopa (988–1069 CE), the human father of the Karma Kagyu. Atisa, the great translator and founder of the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism, was a devotee of Tārā. He composed a praise to her, and three Tārā Sadhanas. Martin Willson&#x27;s work also contains charts which show origins of her tantras in various lineages, but suffice to say that Tārā as a tantric practice quickly spread from around the 7th century CE onwards, and remains an important part of Vajrayana Buddhism to this day.

The practices themselves usually present Tārā as a tutelary deity (thug dam, yidam) which the practitioners sees as being a latent aspect of one&#x27;s mind, or a manifestation in a visible form of a quality stemming from Buddha Jnana. As John Blofeld puts it in &quot;The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet&quot;:

=== Mantras ===

The various systems of Vajrayana Tārā practice contain numerous mantras for Tara. Technically speaking, a Tārā mantra is termed a &quot;vidyā&quot; (the proper term for a mantra of a female deity). The main vidyā mantra of Tārā is: Oṃ tāre tuttāre ture svāhā. This is the most popularly recited mantra of the deity and is her root (mula) mantra. &quot;Tāre tuttāre ture&quot; is in the vocative case. &quot;Tāre&quot; is the basic name of the deity (&quot;O Tara&quot;). &quot;Tuttāre&quot; (prefixed by ud-) refers to Tara as &quot;the one who helps [beings] to cross&quot; the ocean of saṃsāra, and who &quot;pulls [them] up&quot; (&quot;ut-tārā&quot;). &quot;Turā,&quot; the third epithet, means &quot;swift.&quot;

Many Tārā mantras build off this base vidyā mantra by adding various mantric words which activate different functions of the deity, such as pacification or subjugation. As Beyer notes, one way to do this is to add a phrase like &quot;sarva ____ śāntiṃkuru&quot; (pacify all ____ ) in between ture and svāhā. Different terms may be inserted into the blank here, depending on what activity is required, such as grahān (evil spirits), vighnān (hindering demons), vyādhīn (diseases), upadravān (injuries), akālamṛtyūn (untimely deaths), duḥsvapnān (bad dreams), cittākulāni (confusions), śatrūn (enemies), bhayopadravān (terrors and injuries), duṣkṛtāni (evil deeds). Thus, for example, if one wanted to pacify evil spirits, one could recite: Oṃ tāre tuttāre ture sarva grahān śāntiṃkuru svāhā.

Other appendixes may be added to the mantra in the same manner. For example, sarvapāpaṃ āvaraṇa viśuddhe (cleanse all evil and obscurations), or dhanaṃ me dehi (give me wealth). Other extensions of the basic vidyā mantra include a common mantra for wrathful forms of Tārā: Oṃ tāre tuttāre ture hūṃ phaṭ, and a common mantra for White Tārā used to increase lifespan is: Oṃ tāre tuttāre ture mama ayuḥ punya jñānā puśtiṃ kuru svāhā.

Tara&#x27;s seed mantra (bijamantra) is tāṃ. This seed syllable is often visualized in Tara sadhanas (meditative rites. spiritual practices). This seed syllable may also appear in longer Tārā mantras. For example, there is a common Red Tārā mantra which goes: Oṃ tāre tāṃ svāhā.

Some traditions also contain a mantra for each of the twenty one Tārās, which are used to invoke a specific activity of Tara, like Atiśa&#x27;s lineage of Tara practice, which is one of the most popular systems in Tibetan Buddhism. The main source for this system is Atiśa Dīpaṃkaraśrījñāna’s (982–1054 CE) &quot;Sādhana of the Twenty-One Tārās&quot; (&quot;sgrol ma nyi shu rtsa gcig gi sgrub thabs&quot;).

Thus, in Atiśa&#x27;s tradition, the mantra of Swift and Heroic Tārā (used for subduing enemies and hindrances) is Oṃ tāre tuttāre ture vāśaṃ kuru svāhā, the mantra of White Tārā (for healing and longevity): Oṃ tāre tuttāre ture śāntiṃ kuru svāhā and the mantra of Golden Tara (for increasing and wealth): Oṃ tāre tuttāre ture puṣṭīṃ kuru svāhā.

Other Atiśa tradition Tārā mantras require one to insert a specific name into it. For example, the mantra of Tārā who utters hūṃ allows you to influence or seduce a person, and thus is structured as follows: Oṃ tāre tuttāre ture [name of person] ākarṣaya hrī svāhā.

=== Prayers and dharanis ===
There are various prayers, odes (stotras) and dharanis associated with Tara. The most famous is certainly the &quot;Praise to Tara in Twenty One Verses (Namastāraikaviṃśatistotra)&quot; which is found in numerous sources, including in the &quot;Tara Tantra&quot; (Tohoku no. 726), which calls the prayer a &quot;dhāraṇī.&quot; This prayer is recited daily by many monastics and laypersons of the Himalayan Vajrayana traditions. There are numerous commentaries to this praise, including three commentaries attributed to Sūryagupta.

One popular short prayer or dhāraṇī is often found coupled together with the &quot;Praise to Tara in Twenty One Verses.&quot; This is called the &quot;praise rooted in mantra&quot; since it contains the basic Tara mantra. This is also a popular prayer in Vajrayana Buddhism. This prayer is:

namas tāre ture vīre tuttāre bhayanāśini ture sarvārthade tāre svāhā kāre namo’stute
&lt;br&gt;
Om! Homage! O TARE, Swift One, Heroine! TUTTARE who eliminates fears! TURE, the Saviouress granting all benefits! Sound of SVAHA, worshipped and praised!An esoteric sūtra titled &quot;Tārā Who Protects from the Eight Dangers&quot; (*&quot;Tārāṣṭaghoratāraṇī&quot;) teaches the following dharani which can be recited as an aid to liberation:&quot;oṁ&quot;, bodhisattva great lady, goddess, please protect us!

oṁ nama āryāvalokiteśvarāya bodhisattvāya mahā­sattvāya mahā­kāruṇikāya | tadyathā |

oṁ tāre tuttāre ture sarvaduṣṭān praduṣṭān mama kṛte jambhaya stambhaya mohaya bandhaya hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ phaṭ phaṭ phaṭ svāhā |

nama āryāvalobhayā narā bodhisattvā mahā­sattvāni adhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhite mama sarvakarmāvaraṇa svabhāva­śuddhe viśuddhe śodhaya viśodhaya hūṁ phaṭ svāhā |Another Tārā dhāraṇī is found in &quot;The Hundred and Eight Names of the Goddess Tārā&quot; (&quot;Tārā­devī­nāmāṣṭaśataka&quot;). This text also contains a set of verses that give one hundred and eight epithets of the deity.

=== Sadhanas ===

Sadhanas in which Tārā is the yidam (meditational deity) can be extensive or quite brief. Most all of them include some introductory praises or homages to invoke her presence and prayers of taking refuge. Then her mantra is recited, followed by a visualization of her, perhaps more mantra, then the visualization is dissolved, followed by a dedication of the merit from doing the practice. Additionally there may be extra prayers of aspirations, and a long life prayer for the Lama who originated the practice. Many of the Tārā sadhanas are seen as beginning practices within the world of Vajrayana Buddhism, however what is taking place during the visualization of the deity actually invokes some of the most sublime teachings of all Buddhism.

In this case during the creation phase of Tārā as a yidam, she is seen as having as much reality as any other phenomena apprehended through the mind. By reciting her mantra and visualizing her form in front, or on the head of the adept, one is opening to her energies of compassion and wisdom. After a period of time the practitioner shares in some of these qualities, becomes imbued with her being and all it represents. At the same time all of this is seen as coming out of Emptiness and having a translucent quality like a rainbow. Then many times there is a visualization of oneself as Tārā. One simultaneously becomes inseparable from all her good qualities while at the same time realizing the emptiness of the visualization of oneself as the yidam and also the emptiness of one&#x27;s ordinary self.
This occurs in the completion stage of the practice. One dissolves the created deity form and at the same time also realizes how much of what we call the &quot;self&quot; is a creation of the mind, and has no long term substantial inherent existence. This part of the practice then is preparing the practitioner to be able to confront the dissolution of one&#x27;s self at death and ultimately be able to approach through various stages of meditation upon emptiness, the realization of Ultimate Truth as a vast display of Emptiness and Luminosity. At the same time the recitation of the mantra has been invoking Tārā&#x27;s energy through its Sanskrit seed syllables and this purifies and activates certain energy centers of the body (chakras). This also untangles knots of psychic energy which have hindered the practitioner from developing a Vajra body, which is necessary to be able to progress to more advanced practices and deeper stages of realization.

Therefore, even in a simple Tārā sadhana a plethora of outer, inner, and secret events is taking place and there are now many works such as &quot;Deity Yoga&quot;, compiled by the present Dalai Lama, which explores all the ramifications of working with a yidam in Tantric practices.

The end results of doing such Tārā practices are many. For one thing it reduces the forces of delusion in the forms of negative karma, sickness, afflictions of kleshas, and other obstacles and obscurations.

The mantra helps generate Bodhicitta within the heart of the practitioner and purifies the psychic channels (nadis) within the body allowing a more natural expression of generosity and compassion to flow from the heart center. Through experiencing Tārā&#x27;s perfected form one acknowledges one&#x27;s own perfected form, that is one&#x27;s intrinsic Buddha nature, which is usually covered over by obscurations and clinging to dualistic phenomena as being inherently real and permanent.

The practice then weans one away from a coarse understanding of Reality, allowing one to get in touch with inner qualities similar to those of a bodhisattva, and prepares one&#x27;s inner self to embrace finer spiritual energies, which can lead to more subtle and profound realizations of the Emptiness of phenomena and self.

As Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, in his &quot;Introduction to the Red Tārā Sadhana&quot;, notes of his lineage: &quot;Tārā is the flawless expression of the inseparability of emptiness, awareness and compassion. Just as you use a mirror to see your face, Tārā meditation is a means of seeing the true face of your mind, devoid of any trace of delusion&quot;.

There are several preparations to be done before practising the Sadhana. To perform a correct execution the practitioner must be prepared and take on the proper disposition. The preparations may be grouped as &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot;. Both are necessary to achieve the required concentration.

===Tibetan revealed texts===
Terma teachings are &quot;hidden teachings&quot; said to have been left by Padmasambhava (8th century) and others for the benefit of future generations. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo discovered Phagme Nyingthig (Tib. spelling: &#x27;chi med &#x27;phags ma&#x27;i snying thig, Innermost Essence teachings of the Immortal Bodhisattva [Arya Tārā]).

Earlier in the 19th century, according to a biography, Nyala Pema Dündul received a Hidden Treasure, Tārā Teaching and Nyingthig (Tib. nying thig) from his uncle Kunsang Dudjom (Tib. kun bzang bdud &#x27;joms). It is not clear from the source whether the terma teaching and the nyingthig teachings refer to the same text or two different texts.

==Forms==

There are many forms of Tārā, including various popular lists of 21 different forms or emanations of Tārā. &quot;Green Tārā&quot; (Skt. śyāmatārā), who is associated with peacefulness and enlightened activity, is the most depicted form of the goddess in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. This is generally considered Tārā&#x27;s main form, out of which the other twenty one forms arise. One common variation of Green Tārā is known as Khadiravaṇi-Tārā (Tārā of the acacia forest) and appears in a forest with flowers in her hair while accompanied by her two attendants Mārīcī and Ekajaṭā.

Another popular form is White Tārā (Sitatārā), often shown with two arms seated on a white lotus and with eyes on her hand and feet, as well as a third eye on her forehead (thus she is also known as &quot;Seven eyed&quot;). She is known for compassion, long life, healing, and serenity. Red forms of Tārā are also quite common, and their main activity is power and enthrallment or magnetizing (Skt. vaśīkaraṇa, the &quot;power to control and subjugate&quot;).

Tārā is generally considered to have many forms, all of which are various adaptations to the needs of all living beings. According to Dharmachari Purna:

There are numerous lists of &quot;twenty one Tārās&quot; found in Tibetan Buddhism, a tradition which is found in the Indic sources as well, beginning with the tantric &quot;The Praise in Twenty-one Homages&quot; (Skt. &quot;Namastāraikaviṃśatistotraguṇahitasahita&quot;, in full: &quot;The Praise to Tara with Twenty-One Verses of Homage, and the Excellent Benefits of Reciting the Praise&quot;, Derge no. 438). Indian authors like Sūryagupta (a.k.a. Ravigupta, c. 7th-8th century), Candragomin and Atisha also wrote texts discussing &quot;twenty one Tārās&quot; and the Tārā lineages of these figures are still found in Tibetan Buddhism. Another different list is found in the Indian &quot;Sadhanamala&quot;.

These Indian lineages have lists which contain different forms of Tārā. There are also other Tibetan lineages with different lists of twenty one forms of Tārā, including that of Longchenpa, Jigme Lingpa and Choggyur Lingpa.

=== Nine Tārā mandala ===
The &quot;Tārā Tantra&quot; contains a mandala of nine Tārās, each one is a different color, but all are depicted as young women covered in jewels, with earrings and ornaments. The nine Tārās are:

# Green Tārā, with one head and two arms, who resides at the center of the mandala. One hand makes the gesture of granting boons (varada) and the other hand holds a blue utpala flower.
# Dark blue Tārā is found in the eastern quarter of the mandala. She is a youth who holds a trident and an uptala flower.
# Gold Tārā is found in the southern quarter of the mandala. She holds a sword and an utpala flower.
# Red Tārā is found in the western quarter of the mandala. She holds a wheel and an utpala flower.
# Green Tārā in the northern quarter of the mandala. She holds a parasol and an utpala flower. 
# Hook Tārā in the eastern gate of the mandala. She is white, wrathful, and carries a hook in each hand.
# Lasso Tārā in the southern gate of the mandala. She is yellow, wrathful, and carries a lasso in each hand.
# Shackles Tārā in the western gate, red skinned, wrathful, holding shackles.
# Bell Tārā in the northern gate, blue-green colored, wrathful, holding a bell in each hand.

=== Sūryagupta&#x27;s Tārās ===
Sūryagupta was a devotee of Tārā and wrote at least five commentaries on the &quot;Praise in Twenty-One Homages&quot;. His explanation of various forms of Tārā is the earliest one in the Indian tradition. In his tradition, which has been widely studied by scholars, each form of the goddess has different attributes, color and activity (such as pacifying, magnetizing, longevity, subduing enemies, etc).

Each form of Tārā also goes by slightly different names. The Sūryagupta list of Tārās actually contains twenty two forms, with one main or central deity, which is Green Tārā, Khadiravaṇī, who is blue-green, and the twenty one Tārās. The order of the list below follows Sūryagupta&#x27;s commentary:

* Swift Courageous Tārā or Heroic Tārā (Skt. Tārā Tura-vīrā or Tārā Pravīrā) - red in color &quot;radiating fiery light, [with] one face with two eyes, and eight arms.&quot; Her arms hold various weapons like a bow and arrow. This Tārā controls and reverses negative and evil influences, both internal and external influences.
* Tārā White like the Autumn Moon or Brilliant Moon Tārā (Skt. Tārā Śuklakānti or Tārā Candra-kānti), this is a three faced twelve armed white Tārā with peaceful powers, she is particularly known for the pacification of defilement and disease. The three faces represent the trikaya.
* Golden Coloured Tārā (Skt. Tārā Kanaka-varṇī), this ten armed gold Tārā specializes in the activity of increasing: increasing lifespan, resources, and wisdom
* Tārā Crown Jewel the Tathāgatas or Victorious Crown Jewel Tārā (Skt. Tārā Tathāgatoṣṇīṣā or Tārā Uṣṇīṣa-vijayā), the uṣṇīṣa is a protuberance on the Buddha’s head, this four armed gold Tārā is known for neutralizing poison, increasing life and preventing premature death.
* Tārā sounding Hūṃ (Skt. Tārā Hūṃ-kāra-nādinī or Tārā Hūṃ-svara-nādinī), slight fierce in countenance and golden color. She is shown stamping her feet, an act that sounds the syllable Hūṃ, which reverses negative influences and draws sentient beings to the Dharma.
* Tārā, Victor Over the Three Worlds (Skt. Tārā Trailokavijayā), depicted ruby red or reddish black, this Tārā subdues and controls all deities and spirits, including devas like Indra and Agni as well as yakshas. She also purifies obscurations and negativities.
* Destroyer Tārā or Enemy crusher Tārā (Skt. Tārā Pramardinī or Tārā Apavādi-pramardanī), a fierce black Tārā with a wrathful looking face holding a sword who is known for subduing dark and demonic forces, external and internal. She is also associated with a phowa ritual which transfers the mindstream to the pure land at the time of death. 
* Mara destroyer Tārā (who bestows excellence) (Skt. Tārā Māra-mardaneśvarī or Tārā Māra-sūdanī-vaśitottama-dā) - a golden colored Tārā with a fierce frown who can destroy the four Maras (death, the defiled aggregates, the defilements, and the Mara the deity) which are the obstacles to awakening. 
* Tārā of the Khadira Forest (Skt. Tārā Khadira-vaṇī), a &quot;shining blue-green&quot; Tārā who holds a blue lotus and appears in a lush forest of fragrant Khadira trees. She is depicted accompanied by Marici and Ekajata. She is the principal Tārā in the Sūryagupta tradition. Interestingly enough
* Tārā granter of boons (Skt. Tārā Vara-dā), is sometimes depicted as a red Tārā who grants all precious things to all beings. 
* Tārā dispeller of sorrow (Skt. Śoka-vinodana Tārā), a red Tārā who fulfills desires and subjugates evil
* Tārā magnetiser of all beings (dispeller of misfortune) (Skt. Tārā Jagad-vaśī or Tārā Jagad-vaśī-riṣṭa-nirvahaṇī), her power is to increase enjoyments, and wealth, she is the &quot;color of darkness&quot;.
* Auspicious light Tārā or Tārā giver of prosperity (Skt. Tārā Maṅgalālokā or Kalyāna-dā Tārā), a gold Tārā with eight arms and a crescent moon ornament. She gives off a white light for pacifying negativities and a yellow light for increasing goodness. She is sometimes depicted with Amitabha at her crown.
* Tārā who ripens all (Skt. Tārā Paripācakā), a red fierce looking Tārā depicted amid a cosmic fire. She subdues the hindrances and protects from fear and danger.

* Tārā who perfects all (Skt. Tārā Pari-pūraṇī), a white Tārā sitting on a bull who can take one to the Pure land of Akanishta

=== Ferocious Tārā - Tārā of Greater China ===
One notable form of Tārā is the dark Ugra Tārā (Ferocious or Terrible Tara) also known as Mahācīnakrama Tārā (Tib: &quot;gya nag gi rim pa drol ma&quot;, Tara in the Tradition of Greater China). This form of Tārā is notable because it was later imported into Hindu tantra from Buddhist sources like the &quot;Sadhanamala&quot; and the &quot;Sadhanasamuccaya&quot;. This Hindu Tara remains an important deity in Hindu Shakta traditions, where she is one of the ten Mahāvidyā goddesses.

Ferocious Tārā is dark / black (nīla) with one face and four arms. She stands on a corpse, and holds a sword, a cutter (kartri), a blue lotus and a skullcup. She sports a single knot of hair with Aksobhya Buddha on her head.

Iconographically, Ferocious Tara is almost identical to one form of another goddess, Ekajaṭā (also known as Ekajaṭī or Blue Tara). As such, some authors identify the two forms.

=== Other forms or emanations of Tārā ===


According to Shaw, there is a later trend of Tārā buddhology that began to see all other female divinities as aspects or emanations of Tārā or at least as being associated with her. Apart from her many emanations named Tārā of varying colors, other Mahayana female divinities that became associated with mother Tara include: Janguli, Parnashabari, Cunda, Kurukulla, Mahamayuri, Saraswati, Vasudhara, Usnisavijaya, and Marici. Based on the principle of Tārā as the central female Buddha, all other devis and dakinis were thus seen as emanations of her.

Other forms or emanations of Tārā include:

*Other wealth Taras like Yellow Cintamani Tārā (&quot;Wish-Granting Gem Tara&quot;) and golden &quot;Rajasri Tārā&quot; holding a blue lotus.
*Vajra Tārā - a tantric form first described in the &quot;Vajrapanjara Tantra,&quot; who is yellow with eight arms, sometimes shown with a male consort.
*Cintāmaṇi Tārā, a form of Tārā widely practiced at the level of Highest Yoga Tantra in the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism, portrayed as green and often conflated with Green Tārā
*The Indic deity Sarasvati (Yangchenma), known for the arts, knowledge and wisdom, is sometimes seen as a form of Tārā
*Kurukullā (Rigjema), a red fierce Buddhist deity associated with magnetizing all good things is sometimes seen as an emanation of Tara
*Sitatapatra Tārā (&quot;White Parasol&quot; Tara), depicted as white with many arms, and is mainly seen as a protector
*Golden Prasanna Tārā – a wrathful form, with a necklace of bloody heads and sixteen arms holding an array of weapons and Tantric attributes.
*A yab-yum form in which Green Tara is depicted embracing the Buddha Amoghasiddhi. 
*Pitishvari Uddiyana Tara - a red fierce dancing Tara with four faces and eight arms, a crown of skulls, a necklace of fresh heads and depicted as surrounded by fire.
*Yeshe Tsogyal (&quot;Wisdom Lake Queen&quot;), the consort of Padmasambhava who brought Buddhism to Tibet, is seen as an emanation of Tārā in Tibetan Buddhism.
*Rigjay Lhamo, &quot;Goddess Who Brings Forth Awareness&quot;, seated in royal posture surrounded by rainbow light.

Tārā&#x27;s iconography such as the lotus also shows resemblance with the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, and at least one Tibetan liturgy evokes Lakshmi as Tārā.

<text>Vessels are an English band from Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, who formed in 2005.

The band started out as a post-rock outfit, but later evolved into a live techno act, notably with the release of their third album, &quot;Dilate&quot;. Its follow-up, &quot;The Great Distraction&quot;, was released in 2017.

==History==
Several members of Vessels had been playing music together since the early 2000s. They went through a few different lineups and band names before they formed Vessels in 2005.

On 5 March 2007, the band released a limited 7&quot; single (&quot;Yuki&quot; / &quot;Forever the Optimist&quot;) through Cuckundoo Records, and were tipped by BBC Radio 1 as one of the hottest new bands in the country. The band recorded a session for Huw Stephens&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 1, which was broadcast on 29 March. This was followed by the addition of Peter Wright to the line-up. Another single, &quot;Two Words &amp; A Gesture&quot;, was released in November 2007.

Vessels travelled to Minneapolis, United States to record their debut album, &quot;White Fields and Open Devices&quot;, with producer John Congleton who had previously worked with fellow post-rock artists Explosions in the Sky and This Will Destroy You as well as Modest Mouse, at Pachyderm Studios in December 2007. They completed recording of the ten-track album in twelve days and returned to the UK for a nationwide tour. On 16 June they released the single &quot;A Hundred Times In Every Direction&quot;. Their debut album was released on 18 August.

In May 2010 Vessels recorded the follow-up LP in Dallas, Texas, again with John Congleton and featuring vocals by Stuart Warwick of Jacob&#x27;s Story. It was entitled &quot;Helioscope&quot; and was subsequently released in February 2011. In June 2011 Vessels headlined the BBC Introducing Stage at Glastonbury Festival. Reviews for &quot;Helioscope&quot; were above average included a 7.5 from Pitchfork Media and a 4.5 from Sputnik Music.

Vessels released a third album, &quot;Dilate&quot;, in March 2015. This record saw the band &quot;moving away from the overt post-rock foundations of second album &quot;Helioscope&quot;&quot; and into a more electronic sound. The music from &quot;Dilate&quot; is less guitar orientated and is instead based more heavily on synthesisers and percussion, leading to &quot;danceable dynamics&quot; that &quot;resonate with focused heft and power&quot;. Metacritic, a website that gives an aggregate score based on numerous official and public reviews, gave the album a score of 77/100.

&quot;Dilate&quot; was followed by &quot;The Great Distraction&quot;, released on 29 September 2017 by Different Recordings. The album featured several guest vocalists including John Grant and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips. This album &quot;marks a further evolution for the group&quot; who &quot;have steadily pushed the boundaries of their post-rock foundations, with each of their...studio albums edging further into electronica territory&quot;.

<text>Brouwer is a large lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. Intruding into the western rim of Brouwer is the younger and somewhat smaller crater Langmuir. Further to the east-southeast is the larger walled plain Blackett.

This is an old crater formation with a rim that has been heavily worn due to subsequent impacts. Parts of the rim to the east and north can still be traced in the irregular terrain, but the southern rim is almost completely disintegrated. The interior floor is rough in the southeastern half, and somewhat more level and less rough to the northwest. Lying just to the southeast of the crater midpoint is the satellite crater Brouwer H. If the floor once possessed a central peak, it may have been overlaid by this last-mentioned formation.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Brouwer.

<text>Arthur Emmons Raymond (March 24, 1899, in Boston Massachusetts – March 22, 1999, in Santa Monica, California) was an aeronautical engineer who led the team that designed the DC-3.

Raymond grew up in Pasadena, California, the son of the owner of a luxury hotel. He completed a B.A. at Harvard University, and a M.S. in aeronautical engineering at MIT in 1921.

Raymond spent his entire career at the Douglas Aircraft Company. Beginning as a metal fitter, he rose to the rank of chief engineer, contributing to the design of all Douglas airliners from the DC-1 to the DC-8. During World War II, he helped managed the huge effort that produced tens of thousands of aircraft for that war.

Raymond is best known as the lead designer of the DC-3, &quot;The Plane That Changed the World,&quot; the first airliner that could break even hauling passengers without a government subsidy and without carrying mail. The military equivalent of the DC-3 was the C-47. In Europe, the DC-3 was known as the &quot;Dakota.&quot; Raymond&#x27;s grandson Stephen has said: &quot;In the DC-3, he did almost everything. He knew every bolt and screw in that plane.&quot; About 10,600 DC-3s and C-47s were eventually built between 1934 and 1945, making it the most produced airliner of all time. At the time of Raymond&#x27;s death, about 2,000 DC-3s were still flying and about 400 were still in commercial service.

After retiring from Douglas in 1960, NASA put Raymond in charge of supervising the outside contractors on Project Gemini and Project Apollo until 1969. When Boeing and other aerospace firms proposed in the late 1960s to build a supersonic airliner with substantial subsidies from the US government, Raymond argued that the plane was not commercially viable. The USA government ceased subsidizing the design of the American supersonic transport in 1971, whereupon it died.

At the end of World War II, Raymond proposed to the USAF that they create an organization to think about intercontinental warfare. That organization became the Rand Corporation, of which he was a founding member. He was also a founding member of the National Academy of Engineering. In 1991 he received the National Air and Space Museum Lifetime Achievement Trophy.

He died at age 99.

Stephen Raymond said of his grandfather: &quot;He was always known as the kind of person who spoke truth to power. They depended on him to unearth the things that were wrong from the spinmeisters who were saying everything was dandy.&quot;

<text>Plouézec (; ) is a commune in the Côtes-d&#x27;Armor department in Brittany in northwestern France.

It has 17 km of rugged coastline that makes it a tourist destination all year round, with beaches such as Bréhec and Pors Pin.

Plouézec is twinned with the Irish town of Ballinamore and the twinning committee hosts a Fest Noz festival every August around the Moulin de Craca which regularly draws thousands of visitors. There is traditional Irish and Breton music, as well as food and drink available. Especially popular is the famous &quot;moules-frites&quot;, which is a dish of mussels and French fries.

It has been strongly influenced by the sea and local people often refer to themselves as &quot;enfants de la mer&quot; (children of the sea). Water-based sports such as fishing, sailing, and swimming are very popular and are practised by locals and tourists alike.

==Population==

Inhabitants of Plouézec are called &quot;plouézécains&quot; in French.
==Breton language==
The municipality launched a linguistic plan through Ya d&#x27;ar brezhoneg on 14 November 2008.

<text>Campanus is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southwestern edge of Mare Nubium. It was named after Italian astronomer Campanus of Novara. It forms a crater pair with Mercator just to the southeast. Along the southern of Campanus is the small lunar mare named Palus Epidemiarum. To the southwest is the small crater Dunthorne.

The rim of Campanus is roughly circular, with an outward bulge along the western rim and an inward bulge to the north-northwest. The outer wall has not been significantly eroded, although it has a low saddle-point along the south. The interior floor has been resurfaced by basaltic-lava, leaving only a small central peak projecting above the surface. The floor has the same low albedo as the nearby mare, giving it a dark appearance. It is marked by a pair of tiny craterlets near the northeast and northwest interior walls. A slender rille crosses the crater floor from north to south, passing to the east of the central peak.

To the west of Campanus is the rille system named Rimae Hippalus. Another rille system lies to the south, designated Rimae Ramsden.

Campanus is a crater of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Campanus.
