<text>&quot;Shadow&quot; is the second single by American singer and songwriter Ashlee Simpson, taken from her debut album, &quot;Autobiography&quot; (2004). The single peaked at number 57 in the United States, becoming Simpson&#x27;s second &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 entry; it also peaked at number 31 in Australia.

==Song information==
&quot;Shadow&quot; was written by Ashlee Simpson, Kara DioGuardi and producer John Shanks. It is three minutes and fifty-seven seconds long, and is the third track on &quot;Autobiography&quot;.

The song is about feelings Simpson had (when she was about 15 or 16 years old), according to one interview of living in the shadow of the dreams and accomplishments of her famous older sister, Jessica, and finding her own identity. Although &quot;Shadow&quot; is noted for having somewhat dark lyrics, it concludes with a positive message, as Simpson sings that &quot;everything&#x27;s cool now&quot; and &quot;the past is in the past.&quot; Simpson has said that it is &quot;about loving yourself and coming to terms with who you are&quot;; also, in an interview on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; on September 22, 2004, Simpson explained the song&#x27;s meaning:
&quot;Shadow&quot; was called the &quot;best and most personal song&quot; on the album in a &quot;People&quot; magazine review. There has, however, also been criticism of the song&#x27;s lyrics for seeming excessively dramatic in light of Simpson&#x27;s apparently loving family and fortunate circumstances.

Asked in one interview about the unhappiness she expresses in &quot;Shadow&quot; about her childhood, and whether it&#x27;s &quot;just for the song,&quot; Simpson replied:

Simpson also related, on another occasion, that &quot;[w]hen my sister heard the song she cried and said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the most beautiful song I&#x27;ve ever heard!&#x27;&quot;

==Music video==

The music video for &quot;Shadow&quot;, directed by Liz Friedlander, also deals with the theme of the song. In the video, Simpson plays two different versions of herself, blonde and brunette, who live in separate &quot;worlds&quot; which exist side by side. The world of the blonde Ashlee appears happy and perfect, while the brunette Ashlee seems to have more negative feelings—at one point she shoves a bowl of cereal prepared by the blonde Ashlee off a kitchen table—but eventually it is revealed that the blonde Ashlee is not as happy as she seems. At the end of the video, shadows are seen leaving the brunette Ashlee. These scenes are intercut with Simpson singing in a living room setting with her band.

The &quot;Shadow&quot; music video premiered on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on September 13, 2004, and debuted on the countdown the next day at number 10. In its fourth day on the countdown, 20 September, it reached its peak at number two; Simpson herself also visited the show on this day, but did not perform due to illness. The video spent 22 total days on the countdown, with its last day being October 21.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Shadow&quot; debuted at number 20 on VH1&#x27;s Top 20 Countdown for the week of October 6–12, 2004, and it rose the next week to number 15. It reached number 11 for the week of 27 October–2 November and then fell to number 16 the next week.

On September 22, Simpson performed &quot;Shadow&quot; on two U.S. shows: &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; (she also gave an interview, quoted above) and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

&quot;Shadow&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in September at number 68 and reached a peak of number 57. It was unable to match the popularity of Simpson&#x27;s first single, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;, which reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; also reached number one on the Billboard Top 40 Tracks, but &quot;Shadow&quot; reached only number 27. In Australia, &quot;Shadow&quot; was &quot;Autobiography&quot;″s second single, and it reached number 31 on the ARIA singles chart in November 2004; in the same week, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was still ahead of it on the chart, at number 30. In early January 2005, after some time spent out of the ARIA top 50, &quot;Shadow&quot; rebounded to number 34. In the United Kingdom, the song &quot;La La&quot; (which was the third single in the U.S. and Australia) was the second single instead of &quot;Shadow&quot;.

<doc id="1207843" wikidata="Q433585" url="?curid=1207843" title="Laura Joh Rowland">
<text>Laura Joh Rowland (born 1953) is an American detective/mystery author best known for her series of historical mystery novels featuring protagonist set in feudal Japan, mostly in Edo during the late 17th century. She is also the author of two other historical mystery series, one featuring a fictionalized Charlotte Brontë, as well an ongoing series set in Victorian England around the time of the Jack the Ripper murders.

==Early life==
Laura Joh Rowland is the granddaughter of Chinese American and Korean American immigrants. She grew up in Harper Woods, Michigan and was educated at the University of Michigan, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and a Master of Public Health. She tried a number of careers after college, including chemist, microbiologist, quality engineer with Lockheed Martin, and freelance illustrator, but it wasn&#x27;t until she took a writing course that she found her calling.

==Writer==
===Sano Ichirō===
Rowland&#x27;s best known work are the Sano Ichirō mysteries set in feudal Japan. Using as her inspiration P.D. James and Elizabeth George, Rowland set out to write a mystery novel. She had been a big fan of samurai films during her university days, and decided to set her first novel in feudal Japan because &quot;I needed to carve out a territory for myself, and feudal Japan was wide open. It was a marriage of interest and opportunity.&quot; Rowland wrote two novels, which were rejected for publication. After finishing her third novel, she sent the manuscript to two publishers and presented a copy to a Random House editor whom she had met at a writer&#x27;s conference. When all three publishers expressed interest, there was a bidding war that Random House won for $100,000. &quot;Shinjū&quot; was subsequently published by Random House in 1994. Her feudal Japan series, which eventually reached 16 titles, deals with the experiences of Sano Ichirō, a samurai and minor official who, by the end of the first novel, becomes the trusted chief investigator for the fifth Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, and by the tenth novel, is promoted to a very high office.
Throughout the stories, Sano constantly has to deal with the moral conflict of following the code of bushido while serving both justice and his master, the Shogun. After his arranged marriage at the start of the fourth novel to , he also has to deal with her non-traditional attitude as she frequently involves herself in Sano&#x27;s investigations. In all the novels, Sano experiences great pressure as he is faced with death if he does not fulfill his obligations to the &quot;shōgun&quot; as well.
Rowland takes some literary license with known figures, creating fictionalized versions of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, Emperor Higashiyama in &quot;The Samurai&#x27;s Wife&quot;, and Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu. Objective historical details, however, are credibly accurate, although &quot;New York Times&quot; critic F.G. Notehelfer pointed out several historical anachronisms in the first book of the series, &quot;Shinjū&quot;.

===Charlotte Brontë===
In 2008, Rowland started a different mystery series, one that used Charlotte Brontë as the protagonist. When asked about the difficulty of focusing on such a famous historical figure, she replied, &quot;Writing about famous people can mean challenging readers’ assumptions about them. I think a lot of readers see Charlotte Bronte as a prim church mouse who never left Haworth and never did anything but write.&quot;

===A Victorian Mystery===
In 2017, Rowland branched out again, this time setting a series of novels in Victorian England during the Jack the Ripper murders. The protagonist of the series is a fictional photographer named Sarah Bain. According to Rowland, Bain has &quot;inside information about the Ripper murders and personal reasons for keeping it secret.&quot;

==Reception==
Laura Picker, writing for &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, noted, &quot;As with all successful historicals, Rowland&#x27;s Sano novels blend painstaking research with characters whose personalities and inner struggles engage the reader. Sustaining that combination over 16 books is no mean feat, and in doing so, Rowland has earned a place alongside the best current practitioners of the subgenre.&quot;

Lane Wright, reviewing the sixth Sano novel &quot;Black Lotus&quot;, commented, &quot;There is no one better at the esthetic detail than Laura Joh Rowland. She entices all the senses with her vivid, elegant and deeply observant writing. She realistically brings to life 17th century Japan from the couple who owns the noodle shop, to the jail, to the court of the inept shogun and his elderly, eccentric mother. Rowland creates an air of romance, mystery, danger and history in an exotic setting.&quot; Wright concluded, &quot;This novel has it all: plot, genuine human characters, atmospheric setting and the subject of cults relates well to modern times.&quot;

Judith Reveal reviewed the third Victorian mystery &quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Secret&quot; for &quot;New York Journal of Books&quot;, and thought it was &quot;initially a slow read, primarily because [Rowland] chose first person present tense as her point of view, and that gives the writing a staccato, clunky feel.&quot; Reveal also felt &quot;There are times when one does not care for Rowland’s characters.&quot; Despite this, Reveal concluded, &quot;Having said that, and in spite of the rather staccato narrative, the story itself holds water and reads well from beginning to end.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said of her 6th Victorian novel &quot;Garden of Sin&quot; &quot;Rowland&#x27;s portrait of Victorian London is so immersive that new readers will be eager to hang in and get all the narrative threads straight. Series fans will delight at the updates to the lives of her charismatic cast.&quot;

==Awards==
Books by Rowland have been nominated for the Anthony Award, the Hammett Prize, and the Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers Award, and won RT Magazine&#x27;s Reader&#x27;s Choice Award.

==Personal life==
Rowland lived in New Orleans, Louisiana until Hurricane Katrina nearly destroyed her house, but now lives in New York City with her husband Marty.

<text>Glaisher is a lunar impact crater that is located in the region of terrain that forms the southwest border of Mare Crisium. It lies to the southwest of the lava-flooded crater Yerkes, and west-northwest of the Greaves–Lick crater pair. It is surrounded by a ring of satellite craters of various dimensions, the larger companions generally being arranged to the south of Glaisher.

This crater is circular, with a bowl-shaped interior and a small floor at the midpoint. The crater has not been significantly worn by subsequent impacts. A merged, double-crater formation is attached to its southern rim, consisting of Glaisher E at the northwest end and Glaisher G to the southeast.

The crater was named after British meteorologist James Glaisher and its name was approved by the IAU in 1935.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Glaisher.

<doc id="1207852" wikidata="Q1924652" url="?curid=1207852" title="La La (Ashlee Simpson song)">
<text>&quot;La La&quot; is a song by American singer Ashlee Simpson from her debut album, &quot;Autobiography&quot; (2004). Two weeks after it became available as a digital download in mid-August 2004, it rose to No. 37 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Digital Tracks. In the U.S., it began its run as the album&#x27;s third and final single on radio and television in November 2004; in the United Kingdom, where it was the second single, a CD single was released in January 2005. The song&#x27;s video was in heavy rotation on MTV by December 2004. In March 2005 the single was certified Gold, and in August the video was nominated for Best Pop Video on the MTV Video Music Awards.

Simpson performed &quot;La La&quot; multiple times on television in 2004. On January 4, 2005, Simpson performed the song live at the halftime show of the Orange Bowl football game in Miami, Florida. She sang off-key, and after singing the last line, the stadium audience booed her. Critics compared this poor performance to Simpson&#x27;s revealing miscue on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; October 23, 2004, in which she had intended to perform &quot;Autobiography&quot; but the earlier recording of &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was heard instead, showing that Simpson had been lip-syncing. Simpson explained the poor performance of &quot;La La&quot; was the result of an equipment failure, with her in-ear monitors not working.

==Song information==
&quot;La La&quot;, the fourth track on &quot;Autobiography&quot;, was written by Ashlee Simpson, Kara DioGuardi, and John Shanks, the producer of the album. Jeff Rothschild played drums on the track, Shanks played guitars and bass, and Simpson and DioGuardi did background vocals. The track is three minutes and 42 seconds long.

The song was not initially planned as the album&#x27;s third single. In October 2004 it was announced that its title track, &quot;Autobiography&quot;, would be the third single; however, on October 29, it was announced on Simpson&#x27;s official website that &quot;Autobiography&quot; would be replaced as the third single by &quot;La La&quot;, following Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; incident.

Following its release as a single in the UK on January 24, 2005, &quot;La La&quot; debuted at number 11 before falling; it spent four weeks in the top 40. In Ireland, it debuted at number 18 on that country&#x27;s chart in late January and stayed there in the next week. In February, the song debuted at number 10 on the Australian singles chart (where it stayed for four weeks) and at number 98 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the U.S., where it eventually rose to number 86; by comparison, Simpson&#x27;s first single, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;, had reached number 5 on the Hot 100 a few months earlier, and her second single, &quot;Shadow&quot;, had reached number 57. Despite this relatively low chart peak, &quot;La La&quot; was credited with helping boost the sales of &quot;Autobiography&quot;, which rose on the charts from number 42 to number 33 (with a 61% sales increase) in one week in December 2004, soon after the single&#x27;s debut. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in late March 2005; in Australia, it was also accredited as a gold single.

&quot;La La&quot; was used as the backing music for a ThermaSilk shampoo commercial. It was also covered in the rhythm-based 2006 Nintendo DS game &quot;Elite Beat Agents&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;La La&quot; is the most rock-oriented track on &quot;Autobiography&quot;, and was described in a BBC review of the album as &quot;energetic&quot;. Another review called it a &quot;punk inspired, fast beat, screaming anthem&quot;. Reactions to the song have been mixed, however: &quot;People&quot; magazine called the song &quot;insipid&quot; in its review of the album, and AllMusic said that Simpson was &quot;trying way too hard to be sexy.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the song casts Simpson &quot;as a barely legal temptress&quot;, and said &quot;ironic or not, it&#x27;s creepy.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; was more positive, saying that &quot;La La&quot; (in which it said Simpson was a &quot;frisky bad girl&quot;) was one of the songs that could &quot;keep &quot;Autobiography&quot; on the charts in the foreseeable future.&quot; The abovementioned BBC review named the song as one of those on the album that it regarded positively, and another review said Simpson &quot;summons a credible pop-punk sound&quot; on &quot;La La&quot;.

The lyrics to the song are quite sexual, with &quot;la la&quot; being used as a euphemism for sex and a reference to Simpson dressing up as a French maid included; however, Simpson has described the lyrics as tongue-in-cheek: &quot;It was one of those songs where every silly thing that was sexual that I could think of I put into the song.&quot;

In one interview, Simpson said of the song:

==Music video and television performances==
Performances of &quot;La La&quot; featured twice in the first season of &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot;, Simpson&#x27;s reality show, which aired in the U.S. on MTV from mid-June to early August 2004: she performed the song during her first live show in episode six, and again at the end of episode seven.

The music video for &quot;La La&quot;, directed by Joseph Kahn and edited by David Blackburn was filmed over two days, November 11–12, 2004. It debuted on AOL&#x27;s &quot;First View&quot; on November 22 and on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Making the Video&quot; on November 23; the making of the video was also featured in episode three of the second season of &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot;, which aired in February 2005. Following the video&#x27;s premiere, &quot;La La&quot; debuted at number ten on the &quot;TRL&quot; countdown on December 1, 2004; it subsequently reached number six, its peak, on its third day on the countdown. It remained on the countdown for nine days.

The video takes place in a suburban setting and was filmed in Huntington Beach, California. Simpson is seen singing the song, dancing on top of a car, in front of a donut shop, and laying on a couch playing &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; on Xbox, all during daylight. The video continues with a raucous late-night party around a swimming pool, which gets broken up by the police, and then Simpson and the crowd head to a laundromat, where the wild partying continues. Simpson&#x27;s two best friends, Lauren and Stephanie, appear alongside her in the video. Simpson compared the video to the 1982 movie &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;. On &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot;, during the filming of the video there is a scene in which Simpson licks a couch cushion (while rolling around on it for sexual imagery), but, as she explains, it was taken out of the video because it was &quot;a little much&quot;.

Simpson promoted the song with a number of television performances in December 2004 and January 2005 (see list below), with several UK performances in January. One of her U.S. performances, at the Orange Bowl football game halftime show in early January (her first time performing in a stadium), was memorable for the harsh reception the song received from the audience, with &quot;a discernible chorus of boos&quot; after she finished singing, according to the Associated Press. Simpson was the last of three performances during the halftime show, and she later said that there were technical problems and that she couldn&#x27;t hear herself properly, making the performance more difficult for her. The cause of the booing she received has been variously attributed to a backlash against her because of her &quot;SNL&quot; incident the previous October, to the poor quality of her singing, and to the fact that the crowd was generally not in the same age bracket as her usual fans. Simpson herself said &quot;maybe they were booing at me, maybe they were booing at the halftime show &#x27;cause the whole thing sucked,&quot; and also said that it may have been because of the team she was supporting; &quot;I can&#x27;t make everybody happy,&quot; she said. Simpson also had to change the lyrics to &quot;La La&quot; because of concern that they were too sexual for the show; for instance, a reference to &quot;lemonade&quot; replaced &quot;French maid&quot;.

In April 2005, New Zealand&#x27;s children TV Show &quot;What Now?&quot; held a weekly music video poll with the song &quot;La La&quot; being one of the three candidates. The song was competing against &quot;1, 2 Step&quot; by Ciara and Missy Elliott and &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; by Mario. &quot;La La&quot; won the poll narrowly beating Mario who was second by a few votes. &quot;1, 2 Step&quot; came third.

On November 1, 2005, when Simpson was a guest on MuchMusic&#x27;s &quot;MuchOnDemand&quot; in Canada, &quot;La La&quot; received the most votes from viewers out of three of Simpson&#x27;s videos and was played. Simpson correctly guessed that &quot;La La&quot; would win.

<text>West Adelaide Football Club is an Australian rules football club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). Nicknamed the Bloods and commonly known as the Westies, the club&#x27;s home base is Richmond Oval (currently known as Hisense Stadium under a sponsorship agreement). The Oval is located in Richmond, an inner-western suburb of Adelaide.

The club has won nine SANFL premierships, the most recent coming in 2015 – breaking a thirty-two-year premiership drought dating back to 1983; the second longest in the SANFL.

==Club history==

===Early years===
The Football club was formed in 1892 and adopted magenta and white as their colours. The Club patron was Mr Theo. Scherk, President Mr J. Hallow, Secretary R.M.L. Mander, Treasurer Mr J. McCabe, Captain A. Forrestal and Vice Captain W. Morris. 

A meeting was advertised for those interested in a Junior Football Club in West Adelaide. It was held at the Bristol Tavern, Franklin Street, Adelaide, on Tuesday, 3rd April 1894, at 8 p.m. 
 A large number of members attended. Mr. J Coppinger presided. The following officers were elected : Patron, Dr. Todd; president, Mr W. Powell; and a large number of vice-presidents ; secretary, Mr. R.M L. Minder; treasurer, Mr. J. McCabe; committee, Messrs. Forrestall, Sheenan, Foyne, Weismeyer, and Brady; delegates to the Adelaide and Suburban Football Association, Messrs. Hinder and McCabe; Special delegate, Mr. J. J. Sheehan. The appointments of captain and vice-captain were held over.

The club joined the Adelaide and Suburban Association in 1894 and won the premierships in 1895 and 1896.

The 1895 and 1896 Annual Meetings were also held at the Bristol Tavern. At the 1896 Meeting held on 24 March Mr. E. L. Batchelor, M.P., presided over a large and enthusiastic meeting. For the upcoming season the captain was Mr T Bishop and vice-captain Mr Quinn.

===SAFA Admission and Introduction of Electoral Football===
Following the club&#x27;s annual general meeting on 30 March 1897, the club applied to join the South Australian Football Association (SAFA) which was approved by 6 votes to 4 against at a meeting held on 5 April 1897. The SAFA would subsequently become the SANFL.

Upon entering the SAFA senior competition, West Adelaide changed their colours to black and red, the colours previously worn by the defunct Old Adelaide Football Club and moved its training headquarters from the South to the West Parklands. The club often struggled to field a full team in its early years as clubs were then controlled by wealthy businessmen and it was no secret that players were regularly poached from less wealthy clubs. West Adelaide was one of the &quot;poor&quot; clubs and consequently won only one of its first 31 matches.

From the 1899 season the SAFA introduced electoral district football in which players had to play for the club in the district where they lived. West Adelaide immediately gained the services of one of the best players of the time, &quot;Bunny&quot; Daly who threw himself into developing the club. Nonetheless, the club still struggled and had won only twenty and drawn two of 127 games by the end of 1907, including a second winless season in 1906. However, with a number of young players such as Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Head joining veterans James Tierney. West&#x27;s fortunes were about to change and the club would enter what is known as its &quot;Golden Era&quot;

===Golden era (1908 - 1913)===

Prior to the 1908 season, West Adelaide never finished higher than fifth on the premiership ladder. In 1908 former Hotham 1887-1888 Captain, South Adelaide and North Adelaide champion &quot;Dinny&quot; Reedman became West&#x27;s Coach. West Adelaide not only became SANFL premiers for the first time defeating Norwood in the Grand Final at the Adelaide Oval but they also became Champions of Australia when they defeated powerful Victorian Football League team Carlton by five goals at the Adelaide Oval. 

Jos Dailey captained the Premiership and Champions of Australia team in 1908 and went on to captain the Bloods to 3 more Premierships and James &quot;Sorry&quot; Tierney was the club&#x27;s first ever winner of the Magarey Medal in 1908.

West Adelaide repeated as SAFL premiers in 1909 after defeating Port Adelaide by a goal in the Grand Final while &quot;Dick&quot; Head won the club&#x27;s second Magarey Medal. The club slumped in 1910 to finish in fifth place before repeating their 1908 double success by winning the 1911 SANFL Premiership defeating Port Adelaide in the Grand Final and Essendon to win the Championship of Australia.

The heartland and spiritual home of the West Adelaide Football Club was the West End of Adelaide. In 1911 after winning the SAFL premiership and beating Essendon to become Champions of Australia, the manager of the West End Brewery, which was located on Hindley Street, chose to adopt the black and red colours of the West Adelaide as those of the brewery and the nickname ‘The Bottletops’ soon followed for the Football Club. 

The club won its fourth SAFL premiership in five years in 1912 after again defeating Port Adelaide in the grand final before finishing their Golden Era with a third placing in 1913.

===Between wars===
After the SANFL resumed competition following World War I, West Adelaide would finish second in 1922, losing the Final to Norwood while player Robert Barnes was the club&#x27;s third Magarey Madalist.

Bruce McGregor became the club&#x27;s fourth Magarey Madalist when he won the award in 1926

The club began playing their home games at the Wayville Showgrounds in 1927 after their new Headquarters was opened on 23 April. The club won its fifth premiership by defeating North Adelaide by two goals in the grand final. Captain-Coach Bruce McGregor would not only lead his team to the premiership in 1927 but became the first (and so far only) West Adelaide player to win back to back Magarey Madals. Robert Snell (1929), Jack Sexton (1931) and Ray McArthur (1939) also won the Magarey Medal while playing for the West Adelaide Football Club.

After finishing third in 1928 and 1929 followed by – in the absence of star goalsneak &quot;Dickie&quot; Bennetts who was banned for three years for kicking an umpire – fifth in 1930, West Adelaide slumped badly in 1931 to last with only two wins before bouncing back to fifth in 1932 only half a game from the finals. Despite Bennetts&#x27; return, they finished winless for the third time in 1933 but were terribly unlucky in losing five games by a goal or less They recovered to win eight games and draw one in 1934, but between 1935 and 1940 were never higher than seventh in an eight-team competition and overall won only 26 and drew one of 102 games.

The club played its last home game at the Adelaide Showgrounds in Wayville on 19 August 1939 due to the Australian Army taking over the site during World War 2. From the start of the 1940 season home games were again played at Adelaide Oval until the end of the 1957 season.

An unexpected 112-point thrashing of North Adelaide in their last game of 1940, however, proved a true omen of what was to come in 1941. The Bloods carried all before them early in the season and after ten games had suffered only a draw and two narrow losses. A slump ensued before the club required to finish third and beat Port Adelaide in the first semi before Sturt knocked the inexperienced Bloods out in the preliminary.

Between 1942 and 1945 West Adelaide joined forced with Glenelg in a wartime competition, finishing second, third and fourth in a four-team competition.

===&quot;Thereabouts&quot; but never &quot;there&quot;===
West Adelaide became one of the power teams in the SANFL following the resumption of full-scale competition in 1945. The club finished third in 1946 before winning its sixth premiership in 1947 defeating Norwood 10.15 (75) to 8.15 (63). One of Wests leading players during this time was future SANFL legend Fos Williams who played 54 games for the club between 1946 and 1949 before moving on to captain-coach Port Adelaide in 1950, a move that would haunt West Adelaide for the next thirteen seasons as Wests would lose five Grand Finals, all by less than three goals, to the Williams-coached Port Adelaide between 1954 and 1962.

During the mid-1950s, West Adelaide, under the coaching of Laurie Cahill and with strong players such as Neil Kerley, Brian Faehse, Doug Thomas, Ken Eustice, Ken McGregor and 1957 Magarey Madalist Ron Benton, became regular finals visitors and finished as beaten grand finalists in 1954, losing the grand final to the Fos Williams led Port Adelaide by just three points. The 1954 final was marred by a brawl which broke out at half time of the match when angry Port supporters set upon Wests players as they attempted to enter the dressing room located in the Sir Edwin Smith Stand. This was a reaction to a heavy but legal clash prior to the end of the half between Wests captain Brian Faehse and Ports Dave Boyd in which Boyd had come off second best. Wests had been leading by 25 points at half time but the melee in the crowd proved unsettling with some battered Wests players not making it back to the dressing room until the team was due to go back out onto the oval for the second half. Port came back to trail by only two points going into the last quarter of the game and snatched victory by three points.

The half-time melee was the main topic of discussion at an SANFL meeting following the game which prompted the building of the underground dressing rooms at the Adelaide Oval during the summer of 1954/55 while leaving the rooms in the stands to the cricketers. West Adelaide and their captain Brian Faehse were given the honour of being the first team to use the new rooms and to run out onto the oval from them at the start of the 1955 SANFL season.

Wests finished a disappointing seventh in 1955, but would return to form in 1956 where they would again be beaten grand finalists, again losing to Port. After finishing third in 1957, West Adelaide would play in both the 1958 and 1959 SANFL Grand Finals and again would be beaten by the Fos Williams coached Port Adelaide by just two points in 1958 and ten points in 1959. In the former year a late kick for goal by ruckman Jack Richardson which would have given West the lead with only ninety seconds remaining hit the post allowing Port to hold on. Later on grand final night, a group of Wests players, including Kerley, broke into the Adelaide Oval and cut down the goalpost. The post would later end up hanging over the Bar in the West Adelaide Footballers&#x27; Club.

In 1954 the club&#x27;s search for a permanent home ground was solved with the founding of Richmond Oval. It was the first ground purpose built for Australian Rules Football in Australia, pre-dating the VFL&#x27;s Waverley Park by twelve years. Richmond Oval was opened by long-serving member of the South Australian Legislative Council Sir Lyell McEwin on 26 April 1958. A capacity crowd saw West Adelaide christen their new home with a 12.11 (83) to 10.13 (73) win over neighbouring club West Torrens.

After finishing fourth in 1960, West Adelaide, captain-coached by Neil Kerley, won their seventh premiership in 1961, when they defeated Norwood by six goals in the Grand Final. The club would play its nemesis Port Adelaide in the 1962 grand final and once again would go down by a heartbreaking three points to the Magpies. Ken Eustice would become the club&#x27;s tenth Magarey Medalist in 1962. Sensationally after taking the club to two Grand Finals and one premiership in his two years as coach of the club, Kerley was sacked as West&#x27;s coach after the 1962 season. He was reluctantly replaced by longtime teammate and friend Doug Thomas, who went to the club committee before the season and unsuccessfully asked them to re-instate Kerley as captain-coach. Kerley continued on as a player in 1963 honouring his contract, but the following season he left to become captain-coach of South Adelaide, taking the Panthers from bottom in 1963 to their last SANFL Premiership to date in 1964.

===Lean years===
Following the 1961 premiership win and subsequent runners-up in 1962, West Adelaide would go through a very lean time. After finishing 2nd in 1962 the club lost amongst others Kerley, Eustice, Jeff Bray and Don Roach from their playing ranks leading to a lean spell for the club. After having played in thirteen finals series and six grand finals between 1946 and 1963 for two premierships (1947 and 1961), the club would only reach the finals another five times (1968 – fourth, 1969 – third, 1976 – fifth, 1977 – third and 1981 – fifth) between 1964 and 1982.

The ground record crowd for Richmond Oval was set in Round 5 of the 1969 season when 15,742 turned up to see Westies take on a Glenelg side coached by none other than Neil Kerley. Glenelg defeated the Bloods 18 18 (126) to 8.9 (57) on the day and the record crowd still stands as of 2013.

In the early 1970s, West Adelaide declined to their lowest ebb for a third of a century, finishing last in 1972 for the first time since 1936, and repeating this ignominy in 1973 and 1974. In 1970 West unearthed a young ruckman named Dexter Kennedy who made his league debut aged just 15 years, 11 months and 2 days. Kennedy would go on to play 236 games for the club between 1970 and 1982 before playing the last two seasons of his career with Port Adelaide. 1947 premiership player and nine-time premiership coach of Port Adelaide, Fos Williams began coaching the club in 1974 and after a tough start the team improved finishing sixth in 1975, fifth in 1976 and third in 1977. However, that was the high point for the Bloods during the 1970s as they fell dramatically to ninth in 1978 in what was to be Williams&#x27; last season of coaching league football before again finishing last under coach Trevor Hughes in 1979. The other great highlight for the club during the 1970s was the recruitment of Port rover Trevor Grimwood who would become the club&#x27;s eleventh Magarey Medal winner in 1977.

===Inconsistent but dangerous===
The Bloods would continue to perform poorly as they finished second last in 1980 and Trevor Hughes was sacked following the season. Club General Manager Doug Thomas and President Bob Lee enticed 1961 premiership coach Neil Kerley away from West Torrens and back to West Adelaide in 1981 and the improvement in the team was immediate. The Bloods finished 5th in 1981, defeated in the Elimination Final by Norwood. Under Kerley players such as Roger Luders, Bruce Lindner, Ian Borchard, Peter Meuret, Geoff Morris and Mark Mickan all started to play their best football and 1982 was almost a repeat of the 1981 season. Going into the final round West were locked in a battle for the 5th and final finals spot on the ladder. However, Norwood again ended their run when they thumped the Bloods at Norwood Oval consigning West to a 6th-place finish.

The team hit its straps in the 1983 season, winning its first minor premiership since 1962 by two games from Sturt with an 18–4 record. The team finally got its revenge on Norwood when they put a severe dent in the Redlegs premiership defence with a 77-point win the 2nd Semi-final to earn a spot in their first Grand Final since 1962. The Following week Sturt defeated Norwood in the Preliminary to earn the other Grand Final berth. Westies won their eighth premiership when Kerley coached the team to a 21.16 (142) to 16.12 (108) win in the Grand Final in front of 47,129 fans at Football Park. West Adelaide had winners all over the ground but it was captain Ian Borchard who won the Jack Oatey Medal as the best player in the Grand Final while Centre half-forward Bruce Lindner with 5 goals and Full-forward Roger Luders kicked 4. Lindner&#x27;s fifth goal was the last of the game, a 65-metre kick on the full from inside the centre square only seconds before the game ended.

Two of Wests best players throughout the 1983 season were unlucky to miss a place in the Grand Final team. Ruckman Mark Mickan, the clubs Best &amp; Fairest for the year, ruptured his Posterior cruciate ligament in the teams 93-point win over Woodville at Football Park in Round 20 and missed the remainder of the season, while Roger Winter, twin brother of Grand Final back pocket player Peter Winter, was injured in the 2nd Semi against Norwood and could not recover in time to take his place in the side. Mickan&#x27;s place was taken by 6&#x27;7&quot; (200 cm) tall Dirk de Jong who had actually retired from league football one game into the season, but was persuaded by Kerley to come back following Mickan&#x27;s injury. Despite some impressive performances in his final four games, including out playing experienced Sturt ruckman Frank Spiel in the Grand Final, de Jong, who started his SANFL career with Wests in 1978, again retired from football after 1983 having played 53 games for the club.

Roger Luders created history in 1983 when he became the first West Adelaide player to ever kick 100 goals in an SANFL season, finishing with 105 goals from 24 games played. Luders kicked 94 goals in the 22 game minor round and with the 6th of his 7 goals in the 2nd Semi-final against Norwood he kicked his 100th for the season. Luders remains the club&#x27;s all-time leading goal kicker with 558 goals kicked in 162 games played between 1978 and 1986 at an average of 3.4 goals per game. Luders tally of 558 goals places him 14th on the list of all-time SANFL goal kickers. During his career Luders was known as one of the most spectacular high marking full-forwards in the SANFL

In 1985 Grantley Fielke, a premiership player from 1983, would become the club&#x27;s twelfth Magarey Medal winner. West Adelaide, coached by Port Adelaide premiership player and coach John Cahill (nephew of former West coach Laurie Cahill) finished 3rd in the 1985 SANFL season, missing out on a grand final spot by less than 2 goals to North Adelaide in the Preliminary Final.

In 1991, the formation of the Adelaide Football Club, South Australia&#x27;s first team in the Australian Football League (formerly the VFL) saw a number of Wests players signed by the new team. Bloods players such as Grantley Fielke, Paul Patterson, and two young guns in Tony Modra and Shaun Rehn were signed to play AFL football, but would still be eligible to play for West Adelaide if not selected by the Adelaide Crows. The Crows also signed former Bloods Bruce Lindner (Geelong) and Mark Mickan (Brisbane) who under the rules of the time, were automatically allocated back to their former SANFL club.

West Adelaide, which has earned a reputation amongst its fans as being &quot;consistently inconsistent&quot;, would win through to their next grand final in 1991. After a slow start to the season under the coaching of former (VFL) premiership player Kevin Morris, the team won nine of its last eleven games to reach the finals in fifth place. With young players such as leading goal kicker Greg Mellor, full forward Tony Modra, and best and fairest Peter Banfield playing alongside returning experienced veterans such as captain Leon Grosser (who would miss the Grand Final through injury), Glenn Goss, as well as Mickan and Lindner (who while playing for the Adelaide Crows in the AFL, had played enough games with West through the season to qualify for the finals), West easily defeated three-time defending premiers Port Adelaide by 89 points in the Elimination Final before winning the First Semi against Woodville-West Torrens (a new team formed through the merger of West Torrens and Woodville at the end of 1990) by 60.

They then defeated a determined South Adelaide by 21 points in the Preliminary Final and would then come up against North Adelaide, a team they had not beaten since Round 17 of the 1985 season. Despite the Roosters squad having far more finals experience than West, the in-form Bloods were rated an even chance to beat the Roosters who were playing in their fifth Grand Final since 1985. In the week leading up to the match there were rumours around Adelaide that Westies were going to &quot;go the biff&quot; in a bid to unsettle the Roosters and in front of 39,276, the smallest SANFL Grand Final crowd since the 1950s, the game became a spiteful affair with many brawls erupting between opposing players following Norths Steven Sims knocking out Wests Matthew Simpson early in the second quarter (it was alleged after the game that Sims had hit Simpson, not to knock him out but to stop his overly close tagging of North&#x27;s Darel Hart). From that point on, West tended to forget about playing football and seemed more intent on punishing Sims, who finished the game with his right eye badly swollen and requiring 5 stitches. West Adelaide may have won the fights, but North Adelaide won the football game would go on to win easily by the score of 21.22 (148) to 11.7 (73). Crows player Darel Hart (who had played 18 AFL games for Adelaide during the year but had enough SANFL games to qualify for the finals) kicked seven goals for the Roosters on his way to winning the Fos Williams Medal. Future dual Crows premiership player Shaun Rehn who had made his AFL debut during the year with the Crows missed the SANFL finals through injury.

Following the 1991 grand final Kevin Morris joined a long list of coaches sacked by the club after a dispute with the club&#x27;s board. In his place for his third run as West Adelaide coach was Neil Kerley, who himself had been controversially sacked as coach of the club after taking them to the 1962 Grand Final. The club slipped to sixth in 1992 and a disappointing eighth in 1993, ahead of perennial wooden spooners Sturt by only a small percentage gap. Following the 1993 season, Kerley was not retained and he was replaced by 220 game player Geoff Morris who led the team to second last in 1994, but improved to fifth in 1995. In 1995 Glenn Kilpatrick became West&#x27;s thirteenth Magarey Medalist when he jointly won the award with Norwood legend Garry McIntosh. Former Norwood premiership player and Crows assistant coach Michael Taylor replaced Morris in 1996 and West would reach a best of third in 1998 before losing to Port Adelaide in the Preliminary final. Full-forward Adam Richardson became the first West Adelaide player since Ron Phipps in 1957 to lead the SANFL in goal kicking when he kicked 80 in the regular season and five in the finals to finish with 85 for the season and win the Ken Farmer Medal.

After missing the finals in 1999 and 2000, for 2001 West Adelaide hired former premiership captain and best and fairest winner Ian Borchard as coach. Borchard led the Bloods back to the finals in 2001 and 2002, but they lost the Elimination Final each time. Former West Adelaide junior and dual Adelaide Crows premiership player Shaun Rehn replaced Borchard in 2003 and led the club to a Grand Final for only the third time in 41 years. Facing a red-hot Central District team aiming for their third premiership in four years, West went down 17.9 (111) to 11.11 (77) in front of 28,199 at AAMI Stadium in the Grand Final. Darren Bradshaw won the Ken Farmer Medal as the SANFL&#x27;s leading goal kicker in 2003, kicking 88 for the season. He added another nine goals in the finals to finish on 97 for the year.

===Abrupt decline and revival===
Once again West Adelaide failed to follow up its good form from the previous season and while still managing to qualify for the finals in 2004 had to be satisfied with just a fifth-placed finish. Things went from bad to worse for the club in 2005 when the team finished with the wooden spoon for the first time since 1979. Following such a dramatic drop in form, Rehn resigned as coach following the 2005 season and was replaced by former Crows teammate Wayne Weidemann for both 2006 and 2007. Despite West Adelaide playing their 400th game at Richmond Oval when they faced Sturt on 7 April 2006, neither season would bring any joy for The Bloods or their supporters as they finished with the wooden spoon in each season. Not surprisingly, Weidemann was replaced as coach following the 2007 season.

Weidemenn&#x27;s replacement was former Hawthorn (AFL) premiership player from 1991 Andrew Collins. However, Collins could not improve the results in 2008 and the club finished with an unwanted fourth wooden spoon in a row, an ignominy suffered previously by Sturt (1989 to 1996), Woodville (1980 to 1985), South Adelaide (1926 to 1929), Glenelg (1937 to 1940 and 1921 to 1925) and Norwood (1913 to 1919), but never despite several bleak eras by the Bloods. Strong recruiting helped the team improve to sixth in 2009 while James Ezard, nephew of 1984 and 1985 Essendon premiership player Alan Ezard, jointly won the Magarey Medal with North Adelaide&#x27;s Rhys Archard, becoming the fourteenth West Adelaide player to win the award.

Westies again finished sixth in 2010, missing the major round for the sixth straight year. In a major development for the club, lights for night games were installed at Richmond Oval (now called City Mazda Stadium under a sponsorship deal) in 2010 and Friday night games became a success with 6,133 fans attending The Bloods first ever home game under lights against North Adelaide on 26 March.

Despite winning their last game of the season at home against Sturt, West missed the SANFL Finals for the seventh straight season finishing third last with an 8–12 record. West Adelaide started the season well with a 5–1 record but injuries to key players plus general poor form saw the Bloods lose seven games in a row mid-season. Early in the 2011 season coach Andrew Collins had his contract extended for a further two years tying him to the club until 2013.

2012 finally saw the work of Andy Collins and his staff finally come to fruition with the Bloods finishing the minor round in third place with a 12–8 record, including being only one of two sides to beat runaway minor premiers Norwood. Collins was criticised in the media for resting his &quot;star&quot; players over the final three rounds after West had already been assured of third place and the &quot;double chance&quot; in the finals. The Bloods got some revenge for their 2003 Grand Final loss to Centrals with a 27-point win in the Qualifying final to book a place against Norwood in the Second Semi-final. However, Norwood&#x27;s defensive game held them to just two goal in the final, the Redlegs easily booking a place in the 2012 Grand Final, winning 8.13 (61) to 2.5 (17). West bounced back a week later to record a 13.10 (88) to 10.7 (67) win over North Adelaide in the Preliminary Final to book a place in their seventeenth SANFL Grand Final, and their first against Norwood since the Bloods 1961 premiership. However, Norwood&#x27;s impregnable defence won out again, and the Bloods were in danger of equalling North Adelaide&#x27;s 1989 ignominy of kicking only one goal in a Grand Final before two late goals in time-on of the last quarter saw then go down 12.7 (79) to 3.12 (30).

2013 Saw West Adelaide consolidate itself as a finals campaigner, finishing the minor round in second place again behind Norwood. However, a second straight Grand Final appearance went begging when North Adelaide reversed the previous years result and booked a place in the GF against Norwood (who would win their second straight flag), leaving The Bloods to finish in third place wondering what might have been.

During 2013, the club won its first competition since winning the 1987 Foundation Cup (SANFL pre-season) when they won the 2013 Foxtel Cup, defeating WAFL side East Fremantle 4.8 (32) to 2.16 (28) at Football Park, a win worth A$100,000 in prizemoney to the club. West held a 25-point lead over the Sharks at halftime by keeping them goalless, but were themselves kept goalless in the second half scoring only three points. Helped by poor kicking for goal by the Perth based club who could only manage 2.12 (24) for the second half, West Adelaide held on for a hard-fought four-point win.

At years End, Ryan Ferguson retired returning home to Victoria. CEO Kym Russell also ended his association with the club while Coach Andrew Collins won a job at Williamstown Football Club. With Collins departing for Williamstown in the VFL, and club captain Ryan Ferguson following him, West Adelaide appointed club Hall of Famer Mark Mickan as its head coach for the 2014 season. Mickan has appointed co-club Best &amp; Fairest winner from 2013 Chris Schmidt as the new captain.

In 2015, West Adelaide broke a 32-year premiership drought, beating Woodville-West Torrens by 30 points in the 2015 IGA SANFL grand final.
The following year 2016 it again collected the wooden spoon which it has repeated in the last 3 consecutive seasons 2019-2021.

West Adelaide were a foundation member of the SANFL Women&#x27;s competition in 2017.

==Current playing list==

==Home grounds==

*Kensington Oval (1897)
*Jubilee Oval (1898–1906)
*Adelaide Oval (1907–1926, 1940–1957)
*Wayville Showgrounds (1927–1939)
*Richmond Oval (&quot;Hisense Stadium&quot;) (1958–present)

The West Adelaide Football Club had no home ground to call their own until the planning and building of Richmond Oval in the early 1950s. The ground was used for training and junior games until it was ready for league use in 1958. The Bloods christened their first game at Richmond by defeating neighbouring club West Torrens by 10 points 12.11 (83) to 10.13 (73) in front of just over 15,000 fans. Such was the success of Richmond Oval that the SANFL moved its traditional ANZAC Day match from the Adelaide Oval to Richmond in 1958 where West Adelaide defeated their long-time Grand Final tormentor Port Adelaide in one of the highest profile matches ever to be played at the ground.

Thanks to the tireless efforts of people like club captain Brian Faeshe (who ironically never got to play on the ground having retired in 1956), Cliff Semmler, Roy Charles, Cliff Todd and City of West Torrens Mayor Steve Hamra, The Bloods finally had a home ground to call their own. In the 2000s the grandstand at the oval was named the B. K. Faeshe Stand in honour of the former champion player, coach and administrator of the club. Brian Faeshe was one of the driving forces in the formation of Richmond Oval while still a player with West Adelaide.

Prior to the opening of Richmond Oval West Adelaide had used the Kensington Oval (1897), Jubilee Oval (1898–1906) and the Adelaide Oval (1907–1926) for its &quot;home&quot; games before gaining exclusive SANFL use of the main arena at the Wayville Showgrounds in 1927, the year of their fifth SANFL Premiership. The club used the showgrounds until the end of 1939 when it was taken over by the Australian Army following the outbreak of World War II. West then went back to the Adelaide Oval for its home games from 1940 until 1957, sharing the ground with South Adelaide. For both stints at the Adelaide Oval, this created problems because during the football season Souths, being the main tenant, had first use of the oval (league) and the Adelaide Oval No. 2 (reserves) for training purposes with Westies often having to train in the Adelaide Park Lands until Richmond became available for training from 1955.

Prior to the 2010 SANFL season West Adelaide installed lights at Richmond Oval for night games. The lights have seen an increase of attendances at the ground with the first game under lights attracting the grounds current record night crowd of 6,133 for the opening game of the season with West defeating North Adelaide 14.19 (103) to 4.7 (31).

The record attendance for a West Adelaide home game was set at Richmond Oval in 1969 when 15,742 attended the Round 5 fixture against Glenelg.

Richmond Oval hosted its first Interstate game in 2013 when South Australia defeated Qld/NT (NEAFL north) 21.14 (140) to 9.4 (58).

On 16 February 2014, Richmond played host to an AFL pre-season game in the 2014 NAB Challenge between Adelaide&#x27;s two AFL teams, the Adelaide Crows and . In front of 8,765 fans, the Crows defeated Port Adelaide 0.18.11 (119) to 0.9.5 (59). The oval received over A$300,000 from the AFL for upgrades to the ground, including improved interchange area and coaches boxes, new goal and point posts and new grass.

==Influence and supporters==

The black and red colours of West End beer made by the South Australian Brewing Company came about after West Adelaide defeated Port Adelaide in the 1911 Grand Final, and defeated VFL premiers Essendon in the Championship of Australia play-off at Adelaide Oval shortly afterwards in the same year.

Despite the SANFL being a localised league, West Adelaide have some high-profile Adelaide personalities as supporters of the club. Former Premier of South Australia (1996–2001) John Olsen , the current SANFL President and Chairman of the SA Football Commission, and former South Australian Sheffield Shield cricketer and SANFL umpire turned Adelaide television and radio personality K. G. Cunningham, are known to be proud Bloods fans.

<text>Goldschmidt is a large lunar impact crater of the variety commonly termed a walled plain. It lies in the northern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side, and appears oval in shape due to foreshortening. The rim is actually relatively circular, although the western rim is overlain by the prominent crater Anaxagoras. Nearly attached to the southeast rim is Barrow, and the two formations are separated by a rugged rise about 30 kilometers across. Further to the south is Epigenes.

The heavily eroded outer rim of Goldschmidt is rugged and irregular, with an inner wall that is incised in several locations by small impacts. Much of the western rim no longer exists, due to the overlapping Anaxagoras and the smaller Anaxagoras A, and the ejecta from these formations covers the western third of the interior floor. The remaining floor is nearly level and flat, most likely having been resurfaced by lava flows. However the surface is now pock-marked by a multitude of tiny craterlets, the most prominent being the small Goldschmidt A.

<text>Gould is the remnant of a lunar impact crater formation that lies in the midst of the Mare Nubium, in the southwest quadrant of the Moon. It was named after American astronomer Benjamin A. Gould. It is located to the east-northeast of the prominent crater Bullialdus, and south of the crater remnant Opelt.

This crater has been flooded by basaltic lava, and only segments of the outer rim still project above the surface of the lunar mare. The most intact section of the rim is the western quadrant, which now forms a curved ridge. There is a shorter segment of surviving rim to the northeast, which is bisected by the crater Gould P. Only small, low ridges remain to outline the original crater to the north and southeast, and the southern rim has been completely destroyed.

A catena, or chain of tiny craters, forms a line running from the southern part of the crater floor towards the eastern part. The craters are probably secondaries from Bullialdus.

<doc id="1207868" wikidata="Q272086" url="?curid=1207868" title="Katharine Cornell">
<text>Katharine Cornell (February 16, 1893 – June 9, 1974) was an American stage actress, writer, theater owner and producer. She was born in Berlin to American parents and raised in Buffalo, New York.

Dubbed &quot;The First Lady of the Theatre&quot; by critic Alexander Woollcott, Cornell was the first performer to receive the Drama League Award, for &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1935. Cornell is noted for her major Broadway roles in serious dramas, often directed by her husband, Guthrie McClintic. The couple formed C. &amp; M.C. Productions, Inc., a company that gave them complete artistic freedom in choosing and producing plays. Their production company gave first or prominent Broadway roles to some of the more notable actors of the 20th century, including many British Shakespearean actors.

Cornell is regarded as one of the great actresses of the American theatre. Her most famous role was that of English poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the 1931 Broadway production of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;. Other appearances on Broadway included in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Letter&quot; (1927), Sidney Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Alien Corn&quot; (1933), Juliet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1934), Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Wingless Victory&quot; (1936), S. N. Behrman&#x27;s &quot;No Time for Comedy&quot; (1939), a Tony Award-winning Cleopatra in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1947), and a revival of Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; (1951).

Cornell was noted for spurning screen roles, unlike other actresses of her day. She appeared in only one Hollywood film, the World War II morale booster &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot;, in which she played herself. She appeared in television adaptations of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; and Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s &quot;There Shall Be No Night&quot;. She also narrated the documentary &quot;Helen Keller in Her Story&quot;, which won an Oscar.

Primarily regarded as a tragedienne, Cornell was admired for her refined, romantic presence. One reviewer wrote &quot;Hers is not a robust romanticism, however. It tends toward dark but delicate tints, and the emotion she conveys most aptly is that of an aspiring girlishness which has always been subject to theatrical influences of a special sort.&quot; Her appearances in comedy were infrequent, and praised more widely for their warmth than their wit. When she played in &quot;The Constant Wife&quot;, critic Brooks Atkinson concluded that she had changed a &quot;hard and metallic&quot; comedy into a romantic drama.

Cornell died on June 9, 1974 in Tisbury, Massachusetts, aged 81, and she is buried at on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard&#x27;s Tisbury Village Cemetery, Tisbury, Massachusetts.

==Family and childhood==

Cornell was born into a prominent, wealthy family distantly related to Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell University. Her great-grandfather Samuel Garretson Cornell, a descendant of pioneer ancestor Thomas Cornell, came to Buffalo in the 1850s, and founded Cornell Lead Works. One of his grandsons, Peter, married Alice Gardner Plimpton. The young couple lived in Berlin when Peter was studying medicine at the University of Berlin. Their first child, Katharine, was born there. Six months later, the family returned to Buffalo, where they lived at 174 Mariner Street. As a child, Katharine had a troubled relationship with her parents due in part to her mother&#x27;s alcoholism. She play-acted in her backyard with imaginary friends. Soon, she was performing in school pageants and plays, and she watched family productions in her grandfather&#x27;s attic theater, still standing at 484 Delaware Avenue. Cornell played at the Buffalo Studio Club parlor theater, located at 508 Franklin Street. She loved athletics, and she was a runner-up for city championship at tennis as well as an amateur swimming champion. She attended the University of Buffalo (later the State University of New York at Buffalo).. In 1913, she joined The Garret Club, a woman&#x27;s only private club in Buffalo, and participated in club theatricals.

After Cornell had become famous, she often brought her productions to her native Buffalo. Although she never returned to Buffalo to live, her enthusiasm for the city and its inhabitants was well known. Biographer Tad Mosel wrote: &quot;To show her affection for her hometown, she always walked slowly when she left her hotel, turning her head to smile on everyone on the street, missing no one, so they could feel close to her and be able to say when they got home that night, &#x27;Katharine Cornell smiled directly at me.&#x27;&quot; For the rest of her career, on opening Broadway nights, she was greeted backstage by family and friends from Buffalo. Many of her productions were performed at the Erlanger Theater on Delaware Avenue, across from the Statler Hotel. The Erlanger was demolished in 2007.

== Early career ==

In 1915, Cornell&#x27;s mother died, leaving her enough money to be independent. The young woman moved to New York City to pursue her acting career. There she joined the Washington Square Players and was hailed as one of the most promising actresses of the season. After just two seasons, she joined Jessie Bonstelle&#x27;s company, a leading New York repertory company that divided its summers between Detroit and Buffalo. Now aged 25, Cornell was consistently receiving glowing reviews.
Cornell joined various theater companies, including the Bonstelle, that toured around the East Coast. In 1919, she went with the Bonstelle company to London to play Jo March in Buffalo play-wright Marian de Forest&#x27;s stage adaptation of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s novel &quot;Little Women&quot;. Although the critics disparaged the play itself, they specifically noted Cornell as the one bright spot of the evening. The paper &quot;The Englishwomen&quot; wrote of Cornell: &quot;London is unanimous in its praise, and London will flock to see her.&quot; Upon her return to New York, she met Guthrie McClintic, a young theater director. She made her Broadway debut in the play &quot;Nice People&quot; by Rachel Crothers, in a small part with Tallulah Bankhead.

Cornell&#x27;s first major Broadway role was that of Sydney Fairfield in Clemence Dane&#x27;s &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot; (1921). &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;[she] has the central and significant role of the play and...gives therein a performance of memorable understanding and beauty.&quot; It played for 173 performances, well enough to be considered a hit. Afterward, Cornell played in a succession of now-forgotten plays.

She married McClintic on September 8, 1921, in her aunt&#x27;s summer home in Cobourg, Ontario. Cornell&#x27;s family spent summers there among other wealthy Americans. The couple eventually bought a townhouse at 23 Beekman Place in Manhattan. It is generally acknowledged that Cornell was a lesbian and that McClintic was gay, and their union was a lavender marriage. She was a member of the &quot;sewing circles&quot; in New York, and had relationships with Nancy Hamilton, Tallulah Bankhead, Mercedes de Acosta, and others.

== Stardom ==

In 1924, Cornell and McClintic were part of The Actor&#x27;s Theatre, a successor to the Washington Square Players. This was a group of actors that sought to be a democracy without any stars. As their first production, they selected &quot;Candida&quot; by George Bernard Shaw. At the time, the play was considered perfect for the group, as none of the characters was considered to outshine the others, because Shaw intended the play to be about ideas. Although the leading protagonist is Candida, she does not really come into her own until the third act. But, Cornell essentially re-envisioned the play. She made Candida the core of the play, a view adopted by directors and critics ever since. Reviews were ecstatic and audiences responded in kind. The Actor&#x27;s Theatre changed its plans and decided that Cornell&#x27;s name must appear above the play&#x27;s title in all future productions of the troupe. Another acting troupe, the Theatre Guild, controlled the rights to all Shaw&#x27;s plays, and thereafter allowed only Cornell to play the role of Candida so long as she was alive, a role which she reprised several more times in her career. Shaw later wrote her a note stating that she had created &quot;an ideal British Candida in my imagination.&quot;

Cornell&#x27;s next role was to play Iris March in &quot;The Green Hat&quot; (1925), a romance by Michael Arlen. The play had themes of syphilis and loose morals, and Iris March was a strong sexual creature. Leslie Howard played the role of Napier. While the play was still in Chicago, it became an international hit, known all over the US and Europe. Ashton Stevens, senior drama critic in Chicago, wrote that &quot;The Green Hat&quot; &quot;should die at every performance of its melodramatics, its rouge and rhinestones, its preposterous third act... Already, I am beginning to forget its imperfections and remember only its charms.&quot; Its chief charm, he conceded, was Cornell, who sent &quot;tiny bells up and down my unpurchasable vertebrae.&quot; Most other critics panned the play itself, but nonetheless found it irresistible because of Cornell&#x27;s ability to mesmerise, despite the garish dialogue. Critic George Jean Nathan wrote that the play was &quot;superbly acted in its leading role by that one young woman who stands head and shoulders above all the other young women of the American theater, Miss Katharine Cornell.&quot;

&quot;The Green Hat&quot; had 231 performances in New York before going to Boston and then a cross-country tour. The play&#x27;s success spawned a fashion in green hats of the type worn by Cornell in the play. Later, Tallulah Bankhead played the role of Iris March in a less successful London production, and Greta Garbo played the role in a 1928 film adaptation, &quot;A Woman of Affairs&quot;.

She starred in 1927 in &quot;The Letter&quot;, by W. Somerset Maugham, as Leslie Crosbie, a woman who kills her lover. Maugham suggested Cornell for the part. Although the critics were not too excited about the play, Cornell by then had developed a loyal following. The opening night was such a sensation that the &quot;New York Sun&quot; wrote that the sidewalks were packed with people after the performance straining to catch a glimpse of her.

In 1928, Cornell played the lead role of the countess Ellen Olenska in a dramatized version of Edith Wharton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;. Her performance received only positive reviews. After this success, Cornell was offered the lead in &quot;The Dishonored Lady&quot;. It was intended for Ethel Barrymore, who declined the role. The play is a lurid melodrama about true-life murder in Glasgow, Scotland. Walter Winchell wrote &quot;Never in the history of the theatre has an actress of such distinction permitted such an exciting scene. She [Cornell] actually permits a man to crack her a powerful wallop in the face!&quot; One critic complained about the &quot;fifth rate claptrap&quot; of a play and chastised Cornell for selecting such lowbrow theater as a waste of her talents.

&quot;Vogue&quot; wrote that Cornell does these types of plays because &quot;she prefers...to be blunt, trash of a violent kind.&quot; Biographer and playwright Tad Mosel counters that although this is meant as a reproof, when stripped of its condescension, 
&quot;it is a simple statement of the truth. There was a part of her that indeed preferred trash of a violent kind. Her integrity as an artist was the only defense such a preference needed. Every performance had to be as much a revelation of herself as it was an interpretation of a role, and therefore her choice of roles and the way she played them offer great insights into her nature, greater perhaps than can be inferred from her gracious, smiling, always agreeable, and increasingly guarded behavior offstage. One must look at her performances as one looks at the output of a writer or a painter.&quot;

== &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; ==
Katharine Cornell is perhaps best known in her role as poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning in Rudolf Besier&#x27;s play &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;. The play is based on the life of the poet&#x27;s family; the Barretts lived on Wimpole Street in London. The play opens with Elizabeth, the oldest child of a large and loving family. Their widowed father has become embittered and determined that none of his children should marry, lest they become slaves to the &quot;brutal tyranny of passion&quot; and &quot;the lowest urge of the body&quot;. His smothering concern for his family—particularly for Elizabeth, who is an invalid—takes on a sinister character. Poet Robert Browning has read some of Elizabeth&#x27;s poetry and comes to meet her, and they immediately are attracted to each other. When he leaves, Elizabeth struggles to her feet to watch him disappear down the lane. Elizabeth and Robert later elope, and when her father finds that she has married without his permission or knowledge, he orders that her beloved dog, Flush, be killed. He is then informed that Elizabeth has taken the dog with her.
The play has several difficulties. The lead role of Elizabeth has to be played initially as submissive to her father, yet as the center of attention throughout. Although the ending is happy for Elizabeth and Robert, the rest of the family remains under the domination of the father, who is deranged in his obsession. Elizabeth must be played for the first half lying still on a sofa wearing heavy Victorian costume, and covered with a blanket, as befitting an invalid. Many, including Lionel Barrymore, who was asked to play the part of the father, thought it was too melodramatic and past its time. The play was turned down by 27 New York producers before McClintic read it and found it so moving, he cried whenever he read it.
When McClintic was in London, he was able to secure Brian Aherne to play the part of Robert Browning. Afterwards, McClintic immediately went to a London jewelry store and bought a necklace, two bracelets and a garnet ring, all at least 100 years old. For every single performance that Cornell gave as Elizabeth Barrett, she wore this jewelry in the last act, when she leaves the family home for the last time. Katharine Hepburn was selected for the part of Henrietta, but because she was going to play in a summer stock company a few months later, she could not be signed to a contract. Casting the dog was troublesome because it had to lie still in its basket on stage for a great length of time, and then exit when called. McClintic selected an eight-month-old cocker spaniel, which played the role for the full run and many others afterward, to tremendous applause.

Cornell bought &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; for McClintic in December 1930. The play was the first production of the Cornell-McClintic Corporation (C. &amp; M. C. Productions, Inc.), formed January 5, 1931, with Cornell its producer-manager and McClintic its director. McClintic directed the three-hour play with a meticulous attention to period detail. The play opened first in Cleveland, then played in Buffalo before reaching New York in January 1931.
Brooks Atkinson wrote of opening night: 
After a long succession of meretricious plays it introduces us to Katharine Cornell as an actress of the first order. Here the disciplined fury that she has been squandering on catch-penny plays becomes the vibrant beauty of finely wrought character... By the crescendo of her playing, by the wild sensitivity that lurks behind her ardent gestures and her piercing stares across the footlights she charges the drama with a meaning beyond the facts it records. Her acting is quite as remarkable for the carefulness of its design as for the fire of her presence... &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; is a triumph for her and the splendid company with which she has surrounded herself.
All other critics were uniform in praise of her acting: using adjectives such as superb, eloquent, exalted, dark, rhythmic, luminous, haunting, lyric, ravishing. Dorothy Parker, known for her caustic wit and unsentimental reviews, wrote that although she did not think it a good play, she &quot;paid it the tribute of tears...Miss Katharine Cornell is a completely lovely Elizabeth Barrett...It is little wonder that Miss Cornell is so worshipped; she has romance, or, if you like better the word of the daily-paper critics, she has glamour.&quot; The play ran for 370 performances. When it was announced that it was closing, the remaining performances sold out, and hundreds were turned away.

The play&#x27;s success engendered a revival of Robert Browning&#x27;s poetry, and cocker spaniels became the popular dog that year. Irving Thalberg wanted Cornell to play her part in an MGM adaptation, offering that if she was not completely satisfied with the result, the film would be destroyed. She refused. The movie that was released had most of the original cast, and Thalberg&#x27;s wife, actress Norma Shearer, played the part of Elizabeth.

Cornell refused to act in movies because she had seen audiences laugh at the acting of old movies and did not want that to happen to her. According to biographer Tad Mosel, 
&quot;she did not feel that she was acting for historians or nostalgia fans of the future but for audiences of the here and now, people who came into the theatre tonight, sat in their seats and waited for the curtain to go up. Not only were they the ones she wanted to reach, but she wanted to be there when they responded, she did not want to be off in another part of the world while they gazed at a second-hand image on a screen. In fact, she was not sure she could give them anything to respond to without the inducement of their presence.&quot; Moreover, the largeness of her facial structure—her bone structure—were so explicit that they could be seen to the last row, but &quot;might have been less than an asset on the screen where the camera enlarges and exaggerates. Her voice and gestures were eloquent theatre props that might have been too much for the screen, necessitating adjustments so basic that she could not make them. And beyond physical equipment...it is possible that the quality she had as an individual, the unique something about her that transcended technique and craft and fifth-rate writing might not have transcended cameras; it would not have come through to an audience without her physical presence.&quot;

But other sources say that Hollywood secured Broadway plays for its own actors under contract and that Cornell was never considered for the roles she originated on stage. Additionally, Cornell had apparently written to film director George Cukor, suggesting that she would consider a film if he would direct her. Nothing came of this effort.

She declined many movie roles that earned Academy Awards wins and nominations for the actresses who did play those parts, such as Olan in &quot;The Good Earth&quot; and Pilar in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. Additionally, many of her roles in hit plays were successfully played by other great actresses, or were adapted as movies. As audiences were deserting live theater for the movies, Cornell became determined to stay in the theater in order to help keep it vibrant.

==1933–1934 transcontinental repertory tour==

After &quot;Barretts&quot; closed, Cornell played leading parts in two plays: &quot;Lucrece&quot; (1932), Thornton Wilder&#x27;s translation of the play by André Obey, and Sidney Howard&#x27;s &quot;Alien Corn&quot; (1933). Her success in &quot;Lucrece&quot; put her on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on December 26, 1932.

Cornell&#x27;s next production was &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, with McClintic directing. It was the first Shakespeare for them both. Romeo was performed by Basil Rathbone, who had played leading roles at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre in England. The production opened in Cornell&#x27;s native Buffalo on November 29, 1933. Cornell described that day as &quot;a nightmare from start to finish. The sets wouldn&#x27;t fit, the balcony was impossible, my costumes were wrong, the lighting went haywire.&quot; Martha Graham, who choreographed the dance sequences, stepped in and fashioned a flowing robe for Juliet&#x27;s balcony-scene costume shortly before curtain time.

The production opened a seven-month transcontinental tour that rotated three plays: &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, and &quot;Candida&quot;. Many theatre experts advised against such an ambitious endeavor, planned during the height of the Great Depression. It was the first time anyone had attempted a national tour with a legitimate Broadway show, let alone a three-play repertory. The company toured to cities including Milwaukee, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, Cheyenne, San Antonio, New Orleans, Houston and Savannah, and up the east coast to New England.

As movies had eclipsed the stage to a large degree, there were major areas of the U.S. closed off to the tour. Many stops at smaller cities had not seen live theater since World War I, if ever. But box office records were set in most cities and towns. In New Orleans, women rioted when they found out that tickets had sold out. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the tour gave 225 performances and played to 500,000 people. People in less urban areas traveled from two days away to see a performance, and the presenting towns gained a small but welcome swell in revenues from restaurants and hotels as a result.

The most famous story to arise out of the tour came when the troupe was to play &quot;Barretts&quot; on Christmas night in Seattle, McClintic&#x27;s hometown. They planned to arrive in the morning, and as it normally takes six hours to set up the stage, do lighting and blocking checks and distribute costumes, they figured there would be plenty of time.
However, it had been raining for 23 days, and roads and railroads were being washed out. The train moved very slowly, often stopping. The theater management telegraphed that the venue was completely sold out for the evening performance and wanted regular updates to assure the public that the production was on its way. The troupe kept up the telegrams, but eventually these lines gave out. By that evening, the troupe was still far from the city and gave up hope of doing any performance that night. The train finally arrived in Seattle at 11:30 pm. There was a lively crowd waiting for them at the train station, and the manager of the Metropolitan Theatre came up to Cornell and informed her that the audience was still waiting. McClintic asked, &quot;how many?&quot; &quot;The entire house,&quot; was the reply, &quot;Twelve hundred people.&quot; Cornell was shocked and asked, &quot;Do you mean they want a performance at this hour?&quot; &quot;They&#x27;re expecting it,&quot; the manager replied.

All 55 members of the cast and crew drove to the theater. Sets and props had to be protected in the downpour. As soon as the troupe arrived, the audience streamed back into their seats. Cornell decided that the audience could watch the sets for &quot;Barretts&quot; be unpacked and set up, and so raised the curtain. The stage hands, sound checks, and electricians worked to accomplish in one hour what normally took six. By 1 am, they were ready to begin the play. Biographer Tad Mosel writes: &quot;The audience had paid the actors the supreme compliment of having the faith to wait for them, and the actors responded with the kind of performance actors wish they could give every day of their lives. When the final curtain fell at 4 am, they received more curtain calls than they ever had.&quot;

Ray Henderson, the troupe&#x27;s publicist and manager, managed to get this story published the next day in every newspaper in America. Alexander Woollcott established a radio tradition on his program, &quot;The Town Crier&quot;. For years afterward, every Christmas, Woollcott told the story of the Seattle audience that waited until 1 am to see Katharine Cornell &quot;emerge from the flood&quot; and give the performance of her life.
===Cast===

==Broadway successes and maturation of style==

===&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;===
Although they had toured with this play, Cornell and McClintic decided to open &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in New York with a completely new production. McClintic started over, with just a handful of the actors from the tour. Orson Welles was kept, but played Tybalt instead of Mercutio, making his Broadway debut. Brian Aherne took the part of Mercutio, Basil Rathbone played Romeo, and Edith Evans played the Nurse. McClintic&#x27;s idea was to keep the play &quot;light, gay, hot sun, spacious&quot; with no hint of the doom that concluded the play. Also, he coached Cornell to read for meaning, sense and emotion, in place of the poetics of iambic pentameter.

This was a great break with past productions, which up until then had relied upon Victorian prudery and notions of how a classic play should be performed. McClintic reinstated the Prologue and believed that all twenty-three scenes were necessary, cutting only the comedy of the musicians and servants. For the first time, the carnal desires, the youthful romanticism, and the earthiness of language were given equal importance.

The production opened in December 1934, and, as usual, the reviews were glowing. Burns Mantle called Cornell &quot;the greatest Juliet of her time.&quot; Taking note of the freshness of approach, Richard Lockridge of the &quot;New York Sun&quot; wrote that Cornell played Juliet as &quot;an eager child, rushing toward love with arms stretched out.&quot; Cornell herself said that her biggest secret of acting is to do away with all excesses and embellishments, to bring an interpretation to its utmost simplicity. Margot Stevenson from the original cast later said that Cornell was &quot;just this big Italian girl in love!&quot; Stark Young wrote in &quot;The New Republic&quot;: She makes you believe in love, that Juliet loves, and that the diapason and poetry of love are the reward for its torment. Of various [other] Juliets this must have been one of the last things to be said.&quot;

John Mason Brown wrote in the &quot;New York Post&quot;:

It is not often in our lifetime that we are privileged to enjoy the pleasant sensation of feeling that the present and the future have met for a few triumphant hours...Yet it was this very sensation—this uncommon sensation of having the present and future meet; eye-witnessing the kind of event to which we will be looking back with pride in the years to come—that forced its warming way, I suspect, into the consciousness of many of us last night as we sat spellbound. Miss Cornell&#x27;s Juliet is luscious and charming. It finds her at her mellowest and most glamorous. It burns with the intensity Miss Cornell brings to all her acting. It moves gracefully and lightly; it is endlessly haunting in its pictorial qualities; and reveals a Miss Cornell who equals the beauty of the lyric lines she speaks with a new-found lyric beauty of her own voice...To add that it is by all odds the most lovely and enchanting Juliet our present-day theatre has seen is only to toss it the kind of superlative it honestly deserves.

Later, the same critic determined that this role was a turning point in Cornell&#x27;s career, as it meant that she could finally leave the &quot;trifling scripts&quot; of her earlier career and could meet the challenging demands of the greatest classic roles.

===&quot;The Barretts&quot; revived===
&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; closed on February 23, 1935, and two nights later, the production company revived &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, with Burgess Meredith in his first prominent Broadway role. Critics found that this production had grown richer and more satisfying, but it closed three weeks later because other plays were contracted.

The next play, also starring Meredith, was &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;, an anti-war play by John van Druten that lasted only 40 performances and counts among Cornell&#x27;s greatest failures.

===&quot;St. Joan&quot;===
For the next season, Cornell and her husband decided to do &quot;St. Joan&quot; by George Bernard Shaw. McClintic cast Maurice Evans as the Dauphin, Brian Aherne as Warwick, Tyrone Power as Bertrand de Poulengey, and Arthur Byron as the Inquisitor. The play opened on March 9, 1936, and Burns Mantle wrote that the triumph belonged to two maids, &quot;the Maid of Domrémy, France, and the Maid of Buffalo, N.Y.&quot; John Anderson of the &quot;New York Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;Before there is any haggling, let it be said that it is Shaw&#x27;s greatest play and that Miss Cornell is superb in it. She is beautiful to look at and her performance is enkindled by the spiritual exaltation of a transcendent heroine.&quot;

It was in this play that Cornell&#x27;s real artistry became apparent. Audience members talked of having been &quot;changed&quot; by her performance, and &quot;mesmerized.&quot; Writer S.N. Behrman said &quot;it was something essential in herself, as a person, that the audiences sensed and reached out to.&quot; Another said that she was like &quot;radium, flashing its healing rays,&quot; while others used an older phrase, &quot;magnetic influence.&quot;

The play closed in the spring of 1936 only because the production company had already contracted to produce Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Wingless Victory&quot;. &quot;Saint Joan&quot; finished with a seven-week tour of five major cities.

===&quot;The Wingless Victory&quot;===

In Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Wingless Victory&quot;, McClintic decided to avoid the so-called &quot;star entrance,&quot; where the audience expects the star of the play to enter grandly to general applause. Instead, he had another character take the star entrance, and only then was it revealed that Cornell was onstage. The effect was startling. Opened in 1936, the play received mixed reviews, and many bad ones, but Cornell was respected for taking any role and twisting it to make it her own. Gently disparaging the play itself, Brooks Atkinson wrote that Cornell is &quot;our queen of tragedy, a thoughtful actress and a great one.&quot;

Alternating with &quot;Victory&quot;, Cornell revived &quot;Candida&quot; with Mildred Natwick as Prossy. After the conclusion, she took a year off and wrote her memoir (with the help of Ruth Woodbury Sedgewick), titled &quot;I Wanted to Be an Actress&quot; and published by Random House in 1939.

===&quot;No Time for Comedy&quot;===

Cornell&#x27;s general manager Gertrude Macy produced a musical revue &quot;One for the Money&quot;, which starred unknown actors who later achieved fame, including Gene Kelly, Alfred Drake, Keenan Wynn and Nancy Hamilton. Immediately after that closed, Cornell starred in her second comedy, &quot;No Time for Comedy&quot; by S.N. Behrman. McClintic cast the young Laurence Olivier in the leading role of Gaylord. During rehearsals, Cornell had a difficult time with the comedic timing, and someone shook their head and said, &quot;Poor old Kit!&quot; Olivier shot back, &quot;Poor old Kit is the most successful woman in the American theater! The richest, the most beautiful, the most sought after, the most distinguished, the most loved — Poor old Kit indeed!&quot;

In his memoir, Behrman wrote, &quot;Miss Cornell had less [exhibitionism] than any actress or actor I have ever known. Her position in the theatre transcended technique... It was something essential in herself, as a person, that the audiences sensed and reached out to... The whole stage and the other actors took light from the radiance of her personality.&quot;

The play opened on April 17, 1939, and became the third-biggest money-maker for Cornell, and the second production to gross over a million dollars. With a few cast changes, including that of Olivier, the play went on a nationwide tour.

===&quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;===
Cornell next played in Shaw&#x27;s play, &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, and Raymond Massey starred with opposite her. Her production company was running so smoothly that Massey said &quot;Whatever anyone tells you, Kit ran her own show. They will say everything was managed by those people around her, but it is absolutely not true. She knew everything that was going on and she made all the decisions. At the end of the day you could find her poring over the box office receipts. She was a shrewd and intelligent businesswoman.&quot;

The play opened in 1941 in San Francisco, just one week before Pearl Harbor, and was the only show not cancelled, despite numerous blackouts. Given the distraction of the war, the play was not well received. Gregory Peck was part of the tour as &quot;the secretary.&quot;

==The war years==
Shortly after the U.S. entered World War II, Cornell decided upon a revival of &quot;Candida&quot; to benefit the Army Emergency Fund and the Navy Relief Society. Of her five productions of this play, this fourth one is remembered for the star-studded cast of Raymond Massey, Burgess Meredith, Mildred Natwick and Dudley Digges. Cornell was able to convince all actors, Shaw, the theater hands and the Schubert organization to donate their labor, services and venue so that almost all proceeds went directly to the fund.

===&quot;The Three Sisters&quot;===
A year later, Ruth Gordon urged McClintic to produce Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. Judith Anderson played Olga, Gertrude Musgrove was selected for Irina, and Cornell had the role of Masha. Others included theater legend Edmund Gwenn, Dennis King and Kirk Douglas in his Broadway debut. The play opened in Washington in December 1942, and was not expected to be much of a financial success. The opening was attended by Eleanor Roosevelt and the Soviet ambassador. It played for 122 performances in New York before going on the road, exceeding the low expectations. It had the longest run of any Chekhov play in the U.S. and the longest run of this particular play anywhere up to that point.

Cornell is said to have played Masha with a nobility of spirit without ostentation, and that she found the wit in her role. &quot;Time&quot; wrote, in anticipation of its opening, &quot;Not for nothing is Katharine Cornell the top-ranking actress in the U.S. theater as well as a successful producer as well as the wife of able Director Guthrie McClintic. Over the years Cornell has performed many near-miracles. She has made the yearning soul as good box office as the fiery body. She has made an invalid lady on a couch the essence of glamor. She has turned Shakespeare and Shaw into rousing hits. And when, next week, she brings her revival of Chekhov&#x27;s &#x27;The Three Sisters&#x27; to Broadway, it will boast a dream production by anybody&#x27;s reckoning — the most glittering cast the theater has seen, commercially, in this generation.&quot;

Cornell was featured for the second time on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on December 21, 1942, with Judith Anderson and Ruth Gordon.

===Wartime service===

Cornell&#x27;s only film role was speaking a few lines from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in the movie &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (1943), which starred many of Broadway&#x27;s best actors, under the auspices of the American Theatre Wing for War Relief. This organization was created by playwright Rachel Crothers, and created the Stage Door Canteen to entertain troops during the war. Cornell donated time to work at the Canteen cleaning tables.

General George C. Marshall asked Cornell to do a play to entertain the troops in Europe. Cornell decided to take &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; to the troops in Europe as a touring production with the USO and the Special Services Division. However, the USO and the Division stated that no G.I. would sit for a three-hour costume drama about two middle-aged Victorian poets. They suggested an alternate, some sort of &quot;ribald farce&quot; in case &quot;Barretts&quot; proved a failure. Cornell prepared &quot;Blithe Spirit,&quot; but nonetheless insisted upon &quot;Barretts&quot;, saying that if she was going to entertain the soldiers, she must take them her very best, and her very best was &quot;Barretts&quot;. The Army then asked that they cut the love scenes, as the play was far too long at three hours, wanted someone to &quot;explain&quot; the play to the men beforehand, and prepared her for what they saw as rude, tasteless and ignorant troops. The entire company, backed by Cornell and McClintic, resisted all entreaties and played their roles with every degree of authenticity as the Broadway original.

At the first production, the army&#x27;s fears seemed to be validated. At the start of the play, which takes place in damp, chilly London, the doctor advises that Elizabeth go to Italy for rest. The audience, G.I.s fighting in war-torn Italy, exploded in laughter, hooting, yelling and stamping. Margalo Gillmore said &quot;It was true, then, we thought, they would go on laughing and it would never stop and the Barretts would go under a tidal wave of derision. But we were wrong. Kit and Guthrie were holding the laugh, just as if they had heard it a hundred times, not showing any alarm, not even seeming to wait for it, but handling it, controlling it, ready to take over at the first sign of its getting out of hand. It rose and fell and before it could rise again, Kit spoke.&quot;

The play continued, and outbreaks of an occasional catcall, guffaw or heckling were quickly shushed by others. Gillmore continues: &quot;Kit had a shining light in her. With that strange sixth sense of the actor that functions unexplainably in complete independence of lines spoken and emotions projected, she had been aware of the gradual change out front from a dubious indifference to the complete absorption of interest. At first they hung back, keeping themselves separate from us, a little self-consciously, a little defiantly, and then line by line, scene by scene, she had felt them relax and respond and give themselves up to the play and the story, til at last they were that magic indivisible thing, an audience. &#x27;We must never forget this, never,&#x27; said Kit. &#x27;We&#x27;ve seen an audience born.&#x27;&quot;

The tour opened in Santa Maria, a small town 15 miles north of Naples, in 1944. G.I.s lined up three hours ahead of time and profusely thanked the cast afterwards. Brian Aherne wrote that after one show in Italy, the manager overheard a tough burly paratrooper say to his buddy, &quot;Well, what I tell ya? Told ya it would be better than going to a cat house.&quot; Convinced of its success, the Army brass sanctioned two more weeks. The company eventually played for six months, from August 1944 to January 1945, throughout Italy, including stops in Rome, Florence and Siena. From there, the company was transferred under the aegis of General Dwight D. Eisenhower and played in France, including Dijon, Marseilles and Versailles. In Paris, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas wanted to see the play, but found that performances were strictly limited to enlisted personnel. They were given disguises and were able to see the play. Additionally, the cast made a point of visiting hospitals every day throughout the entire tour.

Now aged 51, Cornell was then told by the Army that she had done enough for the effort and to remain in Paris. Her response was to be taken as close to the front as possible. The company performed in Maastricht and Heerlen in the Netherlands, just eight miles from the front. The tour concluded in London amid exploding German V-2 bombs.

Upon her return to New York, Cornell found mail piled up from the G.I.s who had seen the show. They thanked her for &quot;the most nerve-soothing remedy for a weary G.I.,&quot; for having brought &quot;yearned-for femininity,&quot; reminding them that, unlike other USO shows, &quot;a woman is not all leg,&quot; and for &quot;the awakening of something that I thought died with the passing of routine military life in the foreign service.&quot;

Long after the tour was finished, Cornell continued to receive letters, not just from servicemen who had seen the show, but from wives, mothers and even school teachers from the home front. Their letters say that the first letter they received from their boy came after he had seen her show, or it was the first time they had heard from them in two years. Fellow actors reported that G.I.s in the South Pacific were heard to talk about the show.

After the war, Cornell co-chaired the Community Players, a successor to the American Theatre Wing, to assist war veterans and their families on their return home.

==Post-war changes==
===&quot;Candida&quot;, revived===
After the war, American theater was experiencing a change in style with the new generation. Cornell revived &quot;Candida&quot; for the fifth and last time in April 1946, with Marlon Brando playing the role of the young Marchbanks. Whereas Cornell represented an older, exuberant romantic style, Brando heralded the newer style of Method Acting, with its reliance upon psychological insights and personal experience. Although reviews were as good as ever, audiences and some critics had difficulty with the play itself, as the Edwardian drama had little relevance to post-war American life.

Now in her mid-50s, appropriate roles became harder to find. The plays that had earned her such an exceptional reputation—young Elizabeth Barrett, Juliet, St. Joan, various sexually charged women—were no longer playable by her. The newer roles were simply not her style.

===Shakespeare and Anouilh===
In 1946, Cornell chose Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, which opened at the Hanna Theater in Cleveland, a difficult role for which she was ideally suited. Critic Ward Morrison praised Cornell&#x27;s &quot;beauty and power and grandeur and I do not hesitate to proclaim it one of the finest achievements of her career.&quot; Again, Cornell&#x27;s presence insured that this play had its longest run ever, at 251 performances.

She followed that with Jean Anouilh&#x27;s adaptation of the Greek tragedy &quot;Antigone&quot;. Sir Cedric Hardwicke played King Creon, and Marlon Brando was cast as The Messenger. After the opening, Cornell&#x27;s friend Helen Keller told her &quot;This play is a parable of humanity. It has no time or space.&quot; One critic stated &quot;if the world and the theatre had more courageous spirits like [Cornell], our cumulative dreams would be greater, our thoughts, nobler.&quot;

Alternating with &quot;Antony&quot;, Cornell produced another revival of &quot;Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, for an eight-week tour to the West Coast, with Tony Randall in both plays, and Maureen Stapleton as Iras in &quot;Antony&quot;.

===Postwar theatre===
Finding good roles became increasingly a concern. Kate O&#x27;Brien dramatized her historical novel &quot;For One Sweet Grape&quot; into &quot;That Lady&quot;, set in the Spain of Philip II. A swashbuckling romance, the play was not well received. In 1951, Cornell played the lead in Somerset Maugham&#x27;s comedy, &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; for a summer festival in Colorado. The play, starring her longtime favorite Brian Aherne, was produced again in New York and grossed more money for the production company than any other play.

In 1953, Cornell found a suitable role in &quot;The Prescott Proposals&quot;, about a United States Delegate to the United Nations. Christopher Fry wrote a verse drama &quot;The Dark Is Light Enough&quot;, set 1848 Austria. The cast included Tyrone Power, who played the love interest, Lorne Greene, and Marian Winters. (Christopher Plummer was Power&#x27;s understudy. In his memoir, Plummer states that Cornell was &quot;the last of the great actress-managers,&quot; and that she was his &quot;sponsor.&quot;) In 1957, Cornell staged &quot;There Shall Be No Night&quot;, the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Robert E. Sherwood, adapted to the events of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. This play was adapted for TV and broadcast on NBC&#x27;s Hallmark Hall of Fame with Charles Boyer, Bradford Dillman and Ray Walston. &quot;The Firstborn&quot;, another play by Fry, was set in Biblical Egypt, with Anthony Quayle playing Moses. Leonard Bernstein, recently appointed musical director of the New York Philharmonic, wrote two songs for the production. The play toured in Tel Aviv in 1958. She continued with several other forgettable plays, and her last production was &quot;Dear Liar&quot; by Jerome Kilty, which opened and closed in 1960.

Although Cornell was constantly performing, she took a three-year absence from 1955 to 1958 while she recovered from a lung operation. Additionally, with the exception of &quot;The Constant Wife&quot;, box office receipts were lagging even when she received excellent reviews. Tours continued to sell out, but even those began to fail as the decade bore on. By the end of the 1950s, the C. &amp; M.C production company was finished. She did find time in 1954 to be narrator for the film &quot;The Unconquered&quot;, the life story of her friend Helen Keller.

Starting in the 1940s, however, she began to collect tributes from various theatrical organization and colleges and universities, which bestowed her with honorary degrees and awards.

===Radio===
Cornell made her radio debut May 6, 1951, on &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot;. The program featured the first broadcast of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Candida&quot;. On April 13, 1952, she appeared in &quot;Florence Nightingale,&quot; also on &quot;The Theatre Guild on the Air.&quot;

===Retirement===
McClintic died on October 29, 1961, of a lung haemorrhage, shortly after the couple had celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary. As he had always directed Cornell in every production since their marriage, she decided to retire from the stage altogether. She sold her residences and bought a house on East 51st Street in Manhattan, next door to Brian Aherne and down the street from Margalo Gillmore. Since all three were cast members of &quot;Barretts&quot;, East 51st Street became known as Wimpole Street. Cornell also bought an old building on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard known as The Barn and made additions to it as well as restored the 300-year-old Association Hall on the island.

For her 80th birthday party in 1973, an assistant put together a tape of birthday greetings from Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, and Ralph Richardson. The tape runs for seven and a half hours. She died of pneumonia on June 9, 1974 at The Barn in Tisbury, Massachusetts. She was cremated.

==On acting and the theatre==
Cornell served on the Board of Directors of The Rehearsal Club. The club was a place for young actresses to stay while they looked for work, and offered support for their careers. Occasionally, she could be seen serving food to the women, and McClintic often found minor roles in his productions for them.

In her memoir, Cornell states: &quot;I do think that the rapid success achieved by some people in pictures has seriously hurt the chances of a lot of young men and women who are studying for the stage. The success stories that we read in the Hollywood magazines make it all sound too easy. A youngster was a chauffeur yesterday and today he owns four swimming pools! It doesn&#x27;t work that way on the stage... Some young actresses haven&#x27;t been inclined to listen to me when I told that there was no royal road to success on the stage.

&quot;Getting started in the theatre still has a great element of luck in it, of course. Some producer must see the right person at just the right time. To get that kind of break, a girl has got to keep pounding away and tramp the streets from one manager&#x27;s office to another, no matter how discouraging it may be. At the same time, she must remember that when the break does come, she must have the equipment necessary to capitalise on it. I get the impression that most of the young girls who come to me for parts simply haven&#x27;t worked hard enough. In New York they have every chance in the world to round out their education in their spare time. At the galleries along 57th Street they can see the best pictures in all the world. They can hear the finest music. They can get the best books in inexpensive editions. Best of all, they can listen to the finest actors and actresses of the day. When they tell me that they can&#x27;t afford to go to the theatre very often, I usually find they think it beneath their dignity to sit in the top balcony!

&quot;I think the most important thing for young actresses to do is to learn to use their voices properly. I always found that reading French aloud helped me tremendously. I think that French makes you use your mouth more than any other language I know. I still occasionally read some French book aloud to myself before a performance.&quot;

==Legacy==
Katharine Cornell is regarded as one of the most respected, versatile stage actresses of the early-mid 20th century, moving easily from comedy to melodrama, and from classics to contemporary plays. She was a particularly accomplished interpreter of romantic and character roles.

===Theatres, media and research centers===
The Tisbury Town Hall on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard houses a theatre on its second floor. Originally known as Association Hall, it was renamed &quot;The Katharine Cornell Theater&quot; in her honor and later, her memory. A donation from her estate provided the funds for renovation (lighting, heating, elevator) as well as decoration of four large murals depicting Vineyard life and legend by local artist Stan Murphy. The Katharine Cornell Theater is a popular venue for plays, music, movies and more. Her gravesite and memorial are located next door to the Theater.

There is another theater space at the State University of New York at Buffalo named The Katharine Cornell Theatre in her honor. Many student productions are presented there year-round. 

The Katharine Cornell–Guthrie McClintic Special Collections Reading Room was dedicated in April 1974 at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. The Billy Rose Theatre Division at the library holds extensive archival and special collections materials related to Cornell and McClintic.

Smith College has a collection of Cornell&#x27;s papers dating from 1938 to 1960, plus additional materials in the papers of Nancy Hamilton.

The New York Public Library contains correspondence between Russian dance critic Igor Stupnikov and Cornell&#x27;s assistants Nancy Hamilton and Gertrude Macy in the Billy Rose Theater Archive.

Cornell donated some of her costumes designed by famed Russian fashion designer Valentina to the Museum of the City of New York. They include costumes for her roles in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Antigone&quot;.

Cornell and Quayle also recorded for LP a scene from &quot;Barretts&quot;, and Cornell recited a selection of poetry by Elizabeth Barrett from &quot;Sonnets from the Portuguese&quot;. Cornell&#x27;s short scene in &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; can be viewed on YouTube. In it, she recites some lines from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Cornell was the narrator for &quot;The Unconquered&quot;, a 1954 documentary about the life of her friend Helen Keller.

====The Paley Center for Media====
The Paley Center for Media has a collection of Cornell&#x27;s television appearances:
* On April 2, 1956, NBC broadcast of a production of &quot;Barretts&quot; with Anthony Quayle as Robert Browning. She was featured in Hallmark Hall of Fame&#x27;s production of Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s play &quot;There Shall Be No Night&quot;, which was broadcast on NBC on March 17, 1957.
* On January 6, 1957, Dave Garroway interviewed Cornell for &quot;Wide Wide World: A Woman&#x27;s Story&quot;.
* She appeared on TV as herself for an NBC Symphony Orchestra broadcast on March 22, 1952. She was also interviewed three times for the radio program &quot;Stage Struck&quot;, hosted by Mike Wallace.

====Awards and Honors====

Katharine Cornell one of three actresses awarded in the first Tony Awards (1947, award year 1948); her award was received for her performance in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. She was also honored with the first New York Drama League Award in 1935 for her performance as Juliet. In March 1937, The Chi Omega sorority&#x27;s National Achievement Award was given to her by Eleanor Roosevelt at a White House reception.

Cornell was awarded a medal &quot;for good speech on the stage&quot; by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and received a citation as Woman of the Year by the American Friends of the Hebrew University in 1959. After her role in &quot;St. Joan&quot;, she was awarded honorary degrees from the University of Wisconsin, Elmira College Smith College, the University of Pennsylvania, and Hobart.

The &quot;Artvoice&quot;, a weekly arts newspaper in Cornell&#x27;s native Buffalo, each year awards the Katharine Cornell Award to a visiting artist for outstanding contribution to the Buffalo theatrical community.

The Buffalo AKG Art Museum (formerly the Albright-Knox Art Gallery) in Buffalo, New York, has a 1926 full-length portrait of Cornell by artist Eugene Speicher in her role as Candida. The gallery also possesses a 1930 life mask by Karl Illava, an undated drawing of her as Elizabeth Barrett by Louis Lupas, and two sculptures by Anna Glenny Dunbar from 1930.

The Armstrong Browning Library at Baylor University has a portrait of Cornell in her role as Elizabeth Barrett painted by Alexander Clayton on display. The actress donated the portrait and several items related to &quot;Barretts&quot; to the library.

The State University of New York at Buffalo holds a portrait of Cornell painted by surrealist Salvador Dalí dated 1951.

Cartoonist Alex Gard created a caricature of Cornell for Sardi&#x27;s, the famed New York restaurant. It is currently housed in the Billy Rose Theatre Collection of the New York Public Library.

===The Katharine Cornell Foundation===
The Katharine Cornell Foundation was funded with profits from &quot;Barretts&quot;. The foundation was dissolved in 1963, distributing its assets to the Museum of Modern Art (to honor her close friend from Buffalo, A. Conger Goodyear, who was a founder of MoMA and its first president), Cornell University&#x27;s theater department, and the Actor&#x27;s Fund of America.

===Cultural references===
Cornell is featured in a play by Buffalo-born playwright A.R. Gurney titled &quot;The Grand Manner&quot;. The play is about his encounter with Cornell as a young man when she was in the production of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. The play ran during summer 2010 at Lincoln Center and starred Kate Burton as Cornell. In Buffalo, the play was produced by the Kavinoky Theatre in May 2011.

An allusion to Cornell is used as a plot point in the comedy &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman. Sheridan Whiteside&#x27;s personal secretary, Maggie Cutler, has fallen in love with local newspaperman Bert Jefferson. Jefferson has written a play, which Cutler says &quot;just cries out&quot; for Cornell. Whiteside, scheming to hold onto his capable secretary, instead convinces another actress to come seduce Jefferson under the guise of working on the script with him.

<text>Krogh is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the eastern part of the Moon, to the southeast of the crater Auzout. It was named after Danish zoologist, physiologist and Nobel laureate August Krogh. This crater was previously designated Auzout B. The crater is roughly circular and bowl-shaped, with an inner wall that is wider in the north than the south. It is otherwise an undistinguished formation.

<text>Pomortsev is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the eastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after Russian rocketry scientist Mikhail Pomortsev. It lies on the eastern edge of Mare Spumans, to the southwest of the crater Dubyago. This formation was previously designated Dubyago P. One crater diameter to the north is the smaller Stewart.

The nearly featureless interior of this crater has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, leaving a dark floor with an albedo that nearly matches the lunar mare to the west. The crater it roughly circular, with slight outward bulges to the north and northeast. The inner wall is wider along the southern half of the rim, and at its narrowest along the northwestern rim where the crater makes contact with Mare Spumans.

<doc id="1207894" wikidata="Q7092354" url="?curid=1207894" title="One-way pair">
<text>A one-way pair, one-way couple, or couplet refers to that portion of a bi-directional traffic facilitysuch as a road, bus, streetcar, or light rail linewhere its opposing flows exist as two independent and roughly parallel facilities.

==Description==
In the context of roads, a one-way pair consists of two one-way streets whose flows combine on one or both ends into a single two-way street. The one-way streets may be separated by just a single block, such as in a grid network, or may be spaced further apart with intermediate parallel roads. 

One use of a one-way pair is to increase the vehicular capacity of a major route through a developed area such as a central business district. If not carefully treated with other traffic calming features, the benefit in vehicular capacity is offset by a potential for increased road user deaths, in particular people walking and biking. A one-way pair can be created by converting segments of two-way streets into one-way streets, which allows lanes to be added without widening.

On occasion, &quot;couplet&quot; has been applied specifically to the point where the one-way streets and the two-way street meet, rather than the paired one-way streets themselves.

Flows on a one-way pair may follow the traffic handedness convention of the locale, or may be switched. Following the convention allows a one-way pair to be more easily integrated into an existing network of two-way streets, as a single two-way street is effectively split into the two sides of the pair, as in the diagram below:

==Examples==
===Australia===
The Sydney central business district features a number of one way pairs. One example is Pitt Street with Castlereagh Street. Pitt street carries only northbound traffic from Goulburn Street to Market Street. Castlreagh Street only carries southbound traffic on its entire length from Hunter Street to Hay Street. Trams once ran from Central station to Circular Quay along Pitt Street and back to Central station along Castlereigh, Bligh, Bent and Loftus Streets. Other examples are York and Clarence Streets between the Harbour Bridge and Town Hall, and King and Market Streets between Sussex and Elizabeth Streets.

In Redfern, Elizabeth Street is paired with Chalmers Street between Redfern Street and Eddy Avenue. Prior to the opening of the Eastern Distributor in 1999, Bourke and Crown Streets were paired between Woolloomooloo and Waterloo after which they were converted back to two-way streets.

In the Brisbane central business district, Ann Street is paired with Turbot Street and George Street with North Quay, the latter by the Brisbane River. In Southbank, Merivale Street is paired with Cordelia Street from Montague Road to Vulture Street. In East Brisbane, Vulture Street is paired with Stanley Street.

In the Hobart central business district a couplet of Davey Street and Macquarie Street traverse the length of the city centre. The Tasman Highway joins the pair at the northeastern end at an interchange with the Brooker Highway. This current alignment was implemented in 1987 to coincide with the completion of the Sheraton Hotel. It was originally intended that the couplet system would serve as a stop gap measure prior to the construction of a freeway in Hobart&#x27;s Transportation study of 1965. Prior to this, all traffic in Hobart was two-way.

===Canada===
Alberta Highway 2 is a one-way pair in southern Edmonton on Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard between 31 Avenue NW and Whitemud Drive. Alberta Highway 2 is also one-way pair through the towns of Fort Macleod (23 and 25 Streets; cosigned with Alberta Highway 3) and Nanton (20 and 21 Avenues). Alberta Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) is a one-way pair through the town of Edson (2nd &amp; 4th Avenues).

British Columbia Highway 99 is a one-way pair in downtown Vancouver on Seymour and Howe Streets between the Granville Street Bridge and Georgia Street. British Columbia Highway 97 is a one-way pair through the community of Westbank in West Kelowna, following Main Street and Dobbin Road.

Saskatchewan Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) splits into a functional one-way pair for between Uren and Ernfold, with the entire village of Ernfold being located between the eastbound and westbound lanes.

===Japan===
Japan National Route 340 travels through the central part of Hachinohe in Aomori Prefecture as a one-way pair between its northern terminus at an intersection with Japan National Route 45 and Aomori Prefecture Route 251.

===United States===
Interstate 78 travels along a one-way pair of surface streets, 12th Street and 14th Street, in Jersey City, New Jersey, between the end of the New Jersey Turnpike Newark Bay Extension and the Holland Tunnel, which leads into New York City, New York.

There are hundreds of one-way pairs among the streets and avenues of New York City. One example is Fifth Avenue with Madison Avenue. Others include First Avenue with Second Avenue; Third Avenue with Lexington Avenue; and Seventh Avenue with either Sixth Avenue or Eighth Avenue.

Two major streets in the city of Pittsburgh serve as a one-way pair; Forbes Avenue and Fifth Avenue. Both streets begin in Downtown near Point State Park before becoming a one-way pair just east of Market Square, with Forbes serving outbound traffic and Fifth serving inbound traffic, going through Uptown and Oakland before both streets end up with two-way traffic and diverge, with Fifth Avenue eventually terminating in Highland Park, while Forbes terminates in Wilkinsburg just outside the city limits. The mostly two-way Boulevard of the Allies parallels Forbes and Fifth for most of the time the two streets are a one-way pair.

The east side of Portland, Oregon, features a number of one-way pairs, both north–south and east–west, with the east–west pairs being associated with bridges; these all follow the usual flow convention – see Transportation in Portland, Oregon, for more details. By contrast, the Portland Transit Mall, which is a public transportation (bus and rail) corridor, has the opposite flow, with the westernmost component (6th Avenue) running north, with the eastern component (5th Avenue) running south.

There are a number of one-way pairs in Downtown Los Angeles, California. These include 3rd and 4th Streets, 5th and 6th Streets, 8th and 9th Streets, 11th and 12th Streets, and Main and Spring Streets.

Levick Street and Robbins Street in Philadelphia are considered a one-way pair. The streets carry traffic to and from the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge through the Mayfair and Wissinoming neighborhoods. Between Frankford Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard, the streets carry US 13 in their respective direction.

In Orlando, Florida, Princeton Street carries 4 miles of SR-438 near Interstate 4. Over a portion of that, Smith Street carries the westbound traffic. At Lake Lawsona, Mills Avenue splits into Jackson Street northbound and Thornton Avenue southbound.

In Virginia Beach, Virginia, the eastern end of Interstate 264 transitions to 21st and 22nd Street, each going in its respective direction.

<text>Tebbutt is a lunar impact crater that is located near the southwestern edge of Mare Crisium. It was named after Australian astronomer John Tebbutt. It was formerly designated Picard G before being named by the IAU, and lies south of the crater Picard. To the north of Tebbutt, but farther east than Picard, is the flooded Lick.

This crater has a worn and damaged outer rim along its eastern half, but the rim is all but nonexistent on the western face, being little more than a pair of curved ridges beneath the surface. Lava flows have overflowed this western rim and submerged the interior, leaving a relatively level and featureless interior. A small craterlet marks the southern end of the interior floor, and several tiny craters mark the surviving rim.

<text>Ellamulla Kapuge Gunadasa (Sinhala: ගුණදාස කපුගේ; 7 August 1945–3 April 2003) popularly known as Gunadasa Kapuge, was a Sri Lankan singer, musician, music director and playback singer. He was well known among Sri Lankans due to the philosophical background of his music renditions and lyrics selected for his work. 

==Personal life==
Kapuge was born on August 7, 1945, in the tiny village of Thanabaddegama in Elpitiya. His father was Ellalamulla Kapuge Francis and mother was Dona Alice Nona Siribaddana. Being the second of eight siblings, he attended Karandeniya Central College up to grade five and the latter part at Dharmasoka College in Ambalangoda, where he initially studied science before switching to music. His brother, Premawardhana Kapuge is also a singer.

He married Prema Vithanage, in 1978. The couple had one son: Mithra, and two daughters: Ridhma and Sajani. His son Mithra Kapuge, and his brother, Premawardhana Kapuge sing his songs to continue his legacy.

==Music career==
In 1963, he left Haywood college of music (presently known as University of the Visual and Performing Arts), where he was studying at that time, to follow a degree course in India. In late 1960, Kapuge joined the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and in 1969, he worked as an operational assistant and in 1975 started out as a program producer. 

Kapuge&#x27;s initial release was titled &quot;Daesa Nilupul Thema&quot; in 1973, which he sung for a cultural program was aired on SLBC. It later became an instant hit and made his mark in the career. After which, Kapuge was quoted as a &#x27;Grade A&#x27; vocalist by the Radio Ceylon. Thus the three decade long music career of Visharada Kapuge began. He appeared as a film background singer as well as a music director and stage play music director. The first stage drama for which he provided background music was &quot;Thuranga Sanniya&quot; by Sugathapala De Silva. Since then he provided background music for the highly popular musical &quot;Tharawo Igilethi&quot; by Lucien Bulathsinhala and several others. His first movie background music gig was for Stanley Perera&#x27;s &quot;Sandha.&quot; 

In 1973 following his marriage, he lost his job due to political revenge. He was invited to an international youth conference in Havana, Cuba, applied for a leave of absence from the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, but his request was rejected for political reasons. However, Kapuge decided to attend the Youth Conference in Havana on July 22, 1978. On his return to Sri Lanka after attending the summit, the SLBC officials delivered a letter to Kapuge at the Bandaranaike International Airport stating that he has left the service. Although he regained his job in 1979, he was arrested the same year on charges of insulting the then Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa. But Kapuge was able to be released during the investigation into the allegations. He is again expelled from the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Although he was re-employed with the intervention of the then Chairman of the SLBC, Eman Kariyakarawana, Kapuge was transferred to the Rajarata Service of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. In 1981, Kapuge served as the Head of the Music Division of the Rajarata Service and later as the Head of the Rajarata Service. During the 88/89 riots, he did not change his attitude, where he was sent on compulsory leave from Rajarata Sevaya on January 29, 1990. 

Meanwhile, in 1980, Kapuge released his first music compact cassette titled &quot;Dhampatin Laa Sandha&quot; featuring Malani Bulathsinhala. Kapuge staged a one-man musical show titled &quot;Kampana&quot; first staged at Lumbini theatre on August 25, 1990, and also released a cassette and CD with the same title. The show was a historical advent of the Sinhala music industry. In a short span of two years, Kapuge performed nearly a thousand &quot;Kampana&quot; shows across the country, and in some cases had to extend the two hour concert to three hours at the request of the audience. He also made popular top selling cassettes such as &quot;Seethala Sanda Eliye&quot; (1981), &quot;Unmada Sithuvam&quot; (1983), &quot;Piya Satahan&quot; (1990), &quot;Irabatu Tharu&quot; (1999) and &quot;Sanda Ra Sihinaye&quot; (2000). Some of his songs carried meaningful messages to the listeners: specially the song &quot;Bimbarak Senaga Gevasuna&quot; talks about the uprising of Uve Wellassa riot against the British. Then his song &quot;Uthuru Kone Nuba Hinahen&quot; aimed at bringing harmony between Tamil people living in the North with Sinhalese people living in the South of the island. 

He sang three songs using the same melody: The first song is &quot;Sondura Numba Lihiniyaka&quot; composed by Ratna Sri Wijesinghe. Based on a similar melody, the song &quot;Sabada Api Kandu Nowemu&quot; was composed by Dharshana Medis. Meanwhile, the melody of the song composed by the poet Abeysinghe, &quot;Rathriya Mama Wemi&quot; is similar to the above melody.

As a playback singer, he first involved in the film &quot;Ektam Geya&quot; for which he sang the song &quot;Unmadha Situwam&quot;. Then he contributed for the films &quot;Bawa Duka&quot; and &quot;Bawa Karma&quot; both directed by Dharmasiri Bandaranayake. He also sang the song &quot;Kiyanga Magiya&quot; for Milton Jayawardane&#x27;s film &quot;Bithu Sithuwam&quot;. Meanwhile, he made vocals and provided his first theater background music for Sugathapala de Silva&#x27;s play &quot;Thuranga Sanniya&quot;. Later he involved with many popular stage plays, such as: &quot;Paraputuwo&quot;, &quot;Nandi Visala&quot;, &quot;Tharavo Igilethi&quot;, &quot;Sira Kandawuru&quot; and &quot;Sath Saha Satha&quot;.

==Death==
On returning from a tour at Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Kapuge had a fall at the Bandaranaike International Airport whilst disembarking from a shuttle bus. He sustained injuries on the back of his head. He was taken to the medical center at the airport at around 4.30 AM where he was given saline. After initial treatment, he was to be taken to the Colombo National Hospital. However, there was no male nurse available to assist. Kapuge later died on 3 April 2003 at Colombo National Hospital at the age of 57.

==Legacy==
On 7 August 2019, Kapuge Birthday commemoration was held by the Gunadasa Kapuge Foundation for the 13th consecutive year. During the ceremony, a blood donation camp was also held. On 11 September 2015, a lyrical tribute performance titled &quot;Kapugeta Haththawai&quot; by his son Mithra Kapuge was presented by Kapuge Memorial Foundation was commenced at 6.00 pm at the Bandaranaike International Conference Hall.

<text>Townley is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the eastern part of the Moon. It was named after American astronomer Sidney Dean Townley in 1976. It lies to the northwest of Mare Spumans and southeast of the crater Apollonius. This crater was previously designated Apollonius G.

This crater is generally circular, with inner wall that slopes down to a relatively dark floor that is generally flat. The albedo of this floor is similar to the lunar mare to the southeast. The rim is not significantly worn or eroded, although there is a crater-like notch along the southeast rim. A small crater is attached to the northern rim, and several tiny craters lie near the southwest side.

<text>van Albada is a lunar impact crater that is attached to the south-southeastern rim of Auzout. It lies southeast of Mare Crisium, and north-northeast of the larger crater Firmicus. Directly to the east is Krogh.

While the perimeter of van Albada is generally circular, there is a slight outward bulge in the rim to the northwest, and a smaller crater lies across the eastern rim. The inner wall is slightly larger to the north than elsewhere, most likely because it abuts the outer rampart of Auzout. The interior floor is darker in hue than the surrounding terrain, with an albedo that matches the lunar mare to the northwest.

The crater is named after the Dutch astronomer Gale Bruno van Albada (1911–1972). This crater was previously designated Auzout A before being given a name by the IAU.

<text>Robin Mallapert (fl. 1538–1553) was a French musician of the Renaissance, probably a composer, who spent most of his life in Rome. He is best known as the teacher of Palestrina.

Nothing definite is known about the beginning or end of his life, but he was employed successively by several Roman churches and chapels: the Cappella Liberiana at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the San Luigi dei Francesi, the Cappella Giulia (the Julian Chapel) at St Peter&#x27;s, and Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano. During the period 1538-1539, when he was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at Santa Maria Maggiore, Palestrina was one of his singers: most likely he taught him singing and/or composition at this time.

No music is assigned to him with certainty. However, a set of six settings of the Magnificat, attributed to &quot;Rubino&quot;, are most likely his.

<text>Unirally (released as Uniracers in North America) is a racing game developed by DMA Design and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in December 1994 and in the PAL territories on 27 April 1995.

== Gameplay ==

The gameplay of &quot;Unirally&quot; involves racing riderless unicycles around a 2D track. Heavy emphasis is placed on performing stunts, which cause the unicycle to accelerate on race or circuit tracks and earn points on stunt tracks. The stunts that can be performed are relatively simple, primarily involving jumping into the air and rotating around a given axis in 3D space. The objective is to perform these stunts quickly in tight situations while landing the unicycle on its wheels to avoid wiping out, which results in the loss of accumulated speed.

The game features nine tours of five tracks each (two race, two circuit, one stunt), totalling 45 tracks. Completing each of the first eight tours requires defeating computer-controlled opponents for each of the bronze, silver, and gold ranks. The final circuit features the Anti-Uni as the computer-controlled opponent. During this tour, colliding with the Anti-Uni causes several unusual effects, such as rendering the track invisible, reversing controls, and desynchronising the backgrounds from the actions.

The track is composed of bars with patterns that correspond to the properties of the track at or near that point. For example, a solid yellow bar indicates a shortcut, while orange/yellow bars signify an upcoming hazard. There are also various obstacles, including speed boosts, corkscrews, loops, twists, and jumps. Split-screen two-player modes are available as well, including a league mode that allows up to eight players to compete in one-on-one races. There are 16 different coloured unicycles to choose from, each with its own save file and customisable name.

== Development and release ==
&quot;Unirally&quot; was known by the working title &quot;1x1&quot; during its development. The developers practised riding real unicycles throughout their offices to enhance their understanding of the mechanics.

=== Lawsuit ===
Shortly after the game&#x27;s release, DMA Design was sued by Pixar for allegedly copying the unicycle design and concept from their 1987 short film &quot;Red&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Mike Dailly, one of the developers at DMA Design, commented, &quot;The problem with Pixar was that they seemed to think that any computer generated unicycle was owned by them&quot;. DMA Design lost the lawsuit, and as a result, Nintendo had to terminate production of additional &quot;Unirally&quot; cartridges. According to Dailly, &quot;The deal was that Nintendo wouldn&#x27;t make any more carts, so &quot;Unirally&quot; only sold the 300k initial run&quot;. Fellow DMA Design developer Robbie Graham recalled, &quot;They took footage from Red&#x27;s Dream and compared it to &quot;Unirally&quot; and the unicycles were virtually the same; this isn&#x27;t a big surprise as there&#x27;s not a lot of ways you can bring life to a unicycle without looking like the one Pixar did. The judge—being the moron that he was—agreed&quot;.

The limited sales were one of the factors that led to DMA Design being sold to British video game company Gremlin Interactive, and then quickly again to American publisher Take-Two Interactive, to become a subsidiary of Rockstar Games.

== Reception ==
&quot;GamePro&quot; gave a mixed review. They praised its fast pace and &quot;hard-drivin&#x27; unicycle music&quot; but criticised the sound effects and graphics, noting that the backgrounds are clean but boring and the unicycles &quot;all look identical&quot;. They concluded that players should &quot;try this addictive game&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; similarly stated that &quot;Unirally&quot; is innovative and oddly compelling despite its superficial dullness, but noted that the excitement and novelty of the game diminish quickly. Ed Semrad of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; remarked, &quot;While it lacks the charm of most ... Nintendo titles, there is bound to be a cult following&quot;. However, the other three members of the magazine&#x27;s review crew gave &quot;Unirally&quot; a negative assessment, stating that while the graphics and controls are good, the game simply lacks excitement. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the game a B−.

=== Accolades === 
&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked it as the 8th best SNES game of 1994. In 2011, &quot;IGN&quot; named it the 98th best game for the system. In 2018, Complex rated the game the 52nd best Super Nintendo game, stating: &quot;Loops, flips, tricks, &quot;Uniracers&quot; had it all. It was a bona fide SNES game, with the colors, fun, and music that made the system great. We love this game.&quot; In 1995, Total! placed the game 23rd on its Top 100 SNES Games, writing: &quot;It&#x27;s bizarre, but it works and unusually it&#x27;s superb in both one player and two player modes&quot;. In 1996, Super Play awarded &quot;Unirally&quot; 97th place in their Top 100 SNES Games of All Time. They praised the game’s original gameplay and graphics, writing: &quot;The enjoyment of hammering around loops and twirls is heightened by the split-screen two-player mode, which makes all the difference&quot;.

<text>Ceduna ( ) is a town in South Australia located on the shores of Murat Bay on the coast, west of the Eyre Peninsula. It lies west of the junction of the Flinders and Eyre Highways around 786 km northwest of Adelaide. The nearby port of Thevenard lies 3 km to the west on Cape Thevenard. It is in the District Council of Ceduna, the federal electoral Division of Grey, and the state electoral district of Flinders.

The name Ceduna is a local Aboriginal Wirangu word, alternatively phoneticized as &quot;Chedoona&quot;, thought to mean a place to sit down and rest.

The town is a fishing port and a railway hub.

==History==

The Wirangu people once lived over the area including Ceduna. Sea level rise 18,000 to 7,500 years ago completely displaced inhabitants of previous coastal areas and resulted in dramatic changes in distributions of peoples.

Matthew Flinders, on his voyage in the &quot;Investigator&quot;, anchored in Fowlers Bay on 28 January 1802. He went on to explore the coast and named Denial Bay, Smoky Bay and the islands of Nuyts Archipelago. He was disappointed to find no river and gave the name Denial Bay because of &quot;the deceptive hope we had formed of penetrating by it some distance into the interior of the country&quot;.

French expedition leader Nicolas Baudin visited Murat Bay after meeting with Flinders and named it after Joachim Murat. He also named the point of Thevenard after the Admiral and Minister of Marine Antoine-Jean-Marie Thevenard, and Decres Bay after Denis Decres, duke of the First French Empire.

The first European exploration of the hinterland was during August–September 1839 by John Hill and Samuel Stephens, using the chartered brig &quot;Rapid&quot; as a base. Hill reported to Governor Gawler that although the bay was &#x27;valuable&#x27;, the hinterland was &#x27;waterless&#x27;, thereby stalling European interest.

There was a whaling station on nearby St Peter Island during the 1850s before settlement.

The Commissioner of Crown Lands, faced with widespread agitation to open West Coast lands for agricultural settlement, invited three farmers in July 1887 to inspect the lands between Streaky Bay and Western Australia. They were optimistic about the area and recommended that the necessary surveys be started at once. In 1889 the Government in Adelaide formalised the Far West with survey lines.

In June 1901, the town of Ceduna was proclaimed. For many years, locals called the township Murat Bay and it was not until the railways came and called the siding Ceduna in 1915 that locals adopted the name. The Ceduna Jetty was built in 1902.

The Tod Water pipeline was officially opened by Mr M McIntosh, Commissioner of Public Works, June 1928.

Ceduna was the site of a major satellite telecommunications facility operated by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. It was a major employer in the town until made redundant by technological change. It was built in 1969 and by 1984 almost half of Australia&#x27;s International telecommunication traffic passed through Ceduna&#x27;s Earth Station. The dish is now operated remotely and used as a radio astronomy observatory by the University of Tasmania.

On 4 December 2002, Ceduna received international attention when the path of totality of a solar eclipse passed directly over the town. Though the day had at times been partly cloudy, and although mere kilometres away in Thevenard the view was still clouded over, the southwestern sky where the Sun and Moon were located was clear from Ceduna itself at the time of the total solar eclipse, late in the afternoon.

In the 2007/2008 State Budget, Premier Mike Rann (who had opened the new Ceduna TAFE campus in the early 1990s) announced a commitment of $36 million for Stage 1 of the Ceduna Hospital Redevelopment. It was opened in 2011.

In February 2010 Premier Mike Rann opened the world&#x27;s largest mineral sands mine, Jacinth-Ambrosia Mine, operated by Iluka Resources. The $390 million mine is located 200 km north west of Ceduna.

==Population==
According to the 2021 census of Population, there were 1959 people in Ceduna.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 26.4% of the population. 
* 79.2% of people were born in Australia and 82.1% of people spoke only English at home. 
* The most common response for religion was No Religion at 33.7%.

==Description==

The town is the last major settlement before crossing the Nullarbor Plain from east to west. It is set on Murat Bay and the sandy coves, sheltered bays and offshore islands of the bay make it a popular base for a beach holiday. The foreshore at Ceduna is lined with Norfolk Island pine trees. There is a jetty for walking, fishing and small boats.

===Demographics===
In the , the Ceduna urban area had a population of 2,289, and the Ceduna council area a population of 3,480.

Ceduna has a number of Indigenous homelands situated within 20–30 minutes of the town. The council area has 911 Aboriginal residents who make up 24.8% of residents, the highest proportion of Aboriginal people of all local government areas in South Australia. Ceduna is also a service centre for a number of Aboriginal communities in adjacent unincorporated areas. Very few of the indigenous inhabitants of Ceduna speak the local Wirangu language. As the regional service town, Ceduna attracts people from many indigenous groups in western South Australia. The Far West Languages Centre (FWLC) was established in 2006 to maintain three local Endangered languages including Wirangu, along with Mirning and Kokatha.

===Education===
The two schools in Ceduna are Ceduna Area School (CAS) and Crossways Lutheran School. CAS has approximately 600 students, from Reception to Year 12, with approximately 25% of Indigenous students. Crossways has around 150 students from Reception to Year 10, approximately 80% of whom are Indigenous.

===Economic activity===
Iluka Resources developed a mineral sands mine at Jacinth- Ambrosia which relies on Ceduna as a service town.
A major residential development called Ceduna Waters was developed by Carramatta Holdings, a significant South Australian property developer in early 2010. Ceduna Waters is approximately 3 km from the town centre and is approximately 30% occupied as of May 2013.

Prospectively, the development was projected to result in the growth of the population of Ceduna by over 10%. The development will allow for the provision of additional residential accommodation in Ceduna to meet the needs of workers at the Jacinth-Ambrosia mine.

The Thevenard port of Ceduna is a high-frequency deep sea port which exports grain, salt, mineral sand and gypsum, all which are found within the local region.

Aquaculture remains a major industry in Ceduna with pacific oyster growing a key activity in the region. In recent years deep sea fishing and tuna fishing have attracted industries from Port Lincoln to the region.

In 2012, BP commenced the ability to seek approval for oil drilling off the nearby Great Australian Bight. BP is currently investing $20 million into a study of the region&#x27;s ecosystem and social and economic potential.

===Scientific research===

Ceduna has a radio telescope that is integrated into the CSIRO radio telescope network. Telstra donated the dish to the University of Tasmania in 1996 for use as a radio astronomy observatory. It is still in active use.

Ceduna is also a hub for research on southern bluefin tuna and is ideally located data collection through methods including aerial spotting.

===Cultural festivals===
Ceduna&#x27;s annual Oysterfest is a major attraction held on the South Australia Labour Day long weekend. It was established in 1991. Attracting over 6000 people, it celebrates the oyster industry in the clean waters of SA&#x27;s far-west coast, with a wide variety of activities, including a gala dinner, celebrity chefs, live concerts, children&#x27;s amusements and a street parade. The finale is marked by a fireworks display.

===In media===

Ceduna was used as a major filming location for the 1997 film &quot;Kiss or Kill&quot; starring Frances O&#x27;Connor. It was a key setting for the factual drama &quot;Black and White&quot; although the township was not used as a filming location. In 2012 Ceduna was featured in the independent feature film &quot;Nullarbor Nymph&quot; which achieved cult status around the country.

The Cashless Welfare Card began a trial there in March 2016, attracting media attention.

===Tourism===
Ceduna is known as the gateway to the Nullarbor Plain and being on the National Highway its traffic flow is over 240,000 vehicles a year. The township has five caravan parks, four motels and one accommodating hotel. The tourism industry is driven by the nearby conservation parks, beaches and fishing opportunities.

==Environment==

===Climate===

Ceduna experiences a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;BSal&quot;), with warm, dry summers; mild to warm, dry springs and autumns; and mild, relatively dry winters. June is the wettest month. The average yearly precipitation is just under 300mm at the coast and diminishes northward into the interior, becoming increasingly arid. Goyder&#x27;s Line, which demarcates the edge of the area where rainfall is generally sufficient to support agriculture, starts near Ceduna. On 19 December 2019, the maximum temperature of 48.9 °C was recorded.

<text>Margaret Anne Kirkpatrick (née Downs; born 29 January 1941) is an Australian stage and screen actress who has appeared in numerous theatre, television and feature film roles since the late 1950s.

Kirkpatrick starred in the TV series &quot;Prisoner&quot; (known as &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot; in the UK and North America), portraying the character &quot;The Freak&quot; Joan Ferguson, a sinister and cold lesbian prison officer.

She performed in the premiere Australian production of the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; as Madame Morrible.
Kirkpatrick has appeared in numerous TV series including &quot;Richmond Hill&quot;, &quot;Water Rats&quot;, &quot;G.P.&quot; and &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, as well as two roles in &quot;All Saints&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot;.
In 2019, she released her autobiography &quot;The Gloves Are Off: The Inside Story From Prisoner to Wicked&quot;.

==Biography==

Margaret Anne Downs was born in Albury, New South Wales, to James and Crissie Downs. When she was seven months old her father was killed while on active national service as a soldier in North Africa, leaving her mother to bring her up alone. Her mother later married John Anderson and had a son, Adrian. The family moved to Newcastle, New South Wales, where Kirkpatrick grew up. She had had an interest in acting from an early age, and appeared in several school plays. By November 1955 she became fed up with school and left, whereupon her mother sent her to drama lessons.

In 1960, at the age of 19, Kirkpatrick took her first professional acting job, with theatre impresario John Alden&#x27;s Shakespeare Company. After this initial production she promptly gave up acting. Kirkpatrick subsequently took various jobs, including working in dress shop, as a medical receptionist, compère of fashion parades, and she also had jobs in bars, restaurants, and hotels.

Downs married Norman Kirkpatrick, a merchant seaman of the Shankill Road in Belfast, in September 1963. Five years later they moved to Sydney where Kirkpatrick decided to resume her acting career. After appearing in two plays she put her acting career on hold once again, this time due to the arrival of her daughter Caitlin. Kirkpatrick resumed theatre work as Caitlin got older from 1964 onwards, and from 1976 onwards moved on to television and cinema.

Kirkpatrick appeared in the music video for &quot;Anthem for the Year 2000&quot; by rock band Silverchair.

She is a supporter of gay rights, having made numerous appearances at &quot;Fair Day&quot; as part of the annual Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival. She has been awarded the Sydney Gay Community&#x27;s DIVA award for her work.

Kirkpatrick returned to TV in 2017 after a 9-year hiatus, having in recent years appearing primarily in theatre roles, appearing in Australian TV mini-series &quot;The Letdown&quot;.

===Personal life===
In July 2015, Kirkpatrick was charged with child sexual assault against a 13-year-old girl in the 1980s. She strongly denied the allegations and said she would fight to clear her name of the two counts of indecent assault and one count of gross indecency with a person under the age of 16. In a statement Kirkpatrick said, &quot;Yes, allegations have been levelled at me. Are they true? Absolutely not.&quot; She appeared in court in August 2015 and was found guilty on 20 August. She was subsequently sentenced to an 18-month community corrections order, including 100 hours of community service. Kirkpatrick successfully appealed the case and won, with Judge Geoffrey Chettle finding that there was reasonable doubt surrounding the circumstances, and dismissing the conviction and charges.

<doc id="1207939" wikidata="Q3757464" url="?curid=1207939" title="Warmouth">
<text>The warmouth (Lepomis gulosus) is a freshwater fish of the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) that is found throughout the eastern United States. Other local names include molly, redeye, goggle-eye, red-eyed bream, and strawberry perch.

==Description==
Adult warmouth appear dusky, with a mottled brown, somewhat purplish coloration. The ventral surfaces are yellow, and the breeding male has a bright-orange spot at the base of the dorsal fin. Three to five reddish-brown streaks extend from the eyes, whose irises are reddish, a feature most pronounced in breeding males, with a red dot present on the otherwise black opercular flaps, outlined in yellow. It most commonly has three spines in the anal fin and 6 to 13 spines in the dorsal fin, with small teeth present on the tongue and palatine bones. These fish are typically long, but can grow to over in length, and reach . The warmouth is occasionally confused with the rock bass (&quot;Ambloplites rupestris&quot;) or green sunfish (&quot;Lepomis cyanellus&quot;), both of which share its relatively large mouth and heavy body. However, the green sunfish generally has a greenish-blue vermiculate pattern on its cheeks, a black spot near the base of the dorsal and anal fins, fins that are bordered in yellowish-white and no teeth on the tongue. The rock bass has five or six spines in its anal fin as opposed to the three in the warmouth.

==Distribution==
Warmouth are found throughout much of the south in the Mississippi River drainage, from the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and northward to the Chesapeake Bay, and westward throughout Texas to the Rio Grande, and northward into the Great Lakes Basin area. The warmouth is a highly aggressive and hardy fish, and they can live in ponds, lakes, rivers, and backwater streams and can often survive in streams with low oxygen levels where other species of sunfish cannot. The species exists with breeding populations in southern portions of Canada, and likely has existed there for many years prior to being detected.

==Ecology==
The primary diet of the warmouth consists of insects, crayfish, and other fish. They are sight feeders, and can survive in polluted, low-oxygenated waters where other sunfish cannot, like rock bass. The largest factor affecting warmouth density and biomass in Florida&#x27;s lakes is the availability of aquatic macrophytes, which allows the fish to ambush prey and use as areas to spawn. The primary diet of young warmouth is microcrustaceans and aquatic insect larvae, whereas larger specimens tend to mainly consume crayfish, freshwater shrimp, isopods, and other small fish. Their predators include larger fish, snakes, turtles, alligators, and birds. The primary habitats the warmouth occupies are areas with ample vegetation as cover with slower-moving water, often around stumps, brush piles, and other dense entanglements that allow the warmouth the ability to ambush prey, yet escape larger predators that may threaten them.

==Life history==

Spawning for the warmouth begins usually begins when water temperatures reach . Their spawning often begins in May and lasts until July. Nests are primarily constructed on rock or gravel substrates, usually located in or near to some type of structure in the water column. Unlike most other &quot;Lepomis&quot; species, the warmouth does not nest in a colony unless ideal nesting habitat is limited. When in breeding condition, the males&#x27; eyes turn red. After the female lays her eggs, the male fertilizes the eggs and aggressively defends the nest, eggs and fry from any intruder-including other females. Males are most commonly found defending the nest for up to five days later until the fry have hatched. Young warmouth spend most of their time hiding under benthic substrate available to avoid predators. Most are considered sexually mature after one year, but often the size of a fish indicates its maturity rather than time. Males usually grow faster than females. Different habitat conditions also reflect the lifespan of the warmouth, which varies from three to eight years.

The warmouth is an extremely adaptable species that can survive in many different conditions, in many river systems east of the Rocky Mountains. Often, the warmouth prefers habitats where there is slower-moving water. The most common cause of concern for the warmouth is hybridization with other &quot;Lepomis&quot; spp. that often inhabit the same areas as the warmouth. The species known to hybridize with it are the green sunfish (&quot;L. cyanellus&quot;) and the bluegill (&quot;L. macrochirus&quot;), as well as the largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;) and the black crappie (&quot;Pomoxis nigromaculatus&quot;). This does not seem to affect the overall health or longevity of the species.

Since warmouths are not migratory fish, their populations should be relatively easily monitored throughout much of their existing ranges. According to Warren, there is no threat or current concern for the warmouth.

== IGFA records ==
The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) all tackle world record for the species stands at caught in Holt, Florida, in 1985.

<text>Lake Vidraru () is an artificial lake in Romania. It was created in 1965 by the construction of the Vidraru Dam on the Argeș River.

It lies in the shadow of the Făgăraș Mountains. .

Vidraru Lake is a reservoir lake created in 1965 on the Arges River for Hydroelectricity production. It has 465 million cubic metres of water, with a length of and a width of , accumulating a total area of and maximum depth of . Its circumferences is about .

An underground power station is situated in proximity of the lake, deep under the Cetatuia massif. Its annual energy production in an average hydrological year. The installed turbine capacity is .
On the right bank, on Plesa mount, one can find the statue &#x27;Energia&#x27;, representing Prometheus with lightnings in his hand, symbolising electricity. 

Situated between the mountains of and at the exit of the Ghitu massif, the lake is alimented by the rivers Capra, Buda and several direct tributaries (River Lady, and Valsan Cernatul, Valea lui Stan and clear), with a total average alimentation flow of .



The construction of the Vidraru dam took five and a half years starting in 1960. For this achievement, it took 42 km of tunnel excavation through 1.768 million m3 of rock, of which about 1 million underground bands have 930,000 m3 of concrete of which 400,000 m3 underground and also were installed 6300 tonnes of electromechanical equipment.

On Lake Vidraru, people can practice the extreme sport of bungee jumping. Only a few hundred metres of the dam tourists can go to the House Argeseana “and the pier where the practice of leisure boat racing.

The only road to access the lake Vidraru is the spectacular Transfagarasan (DN7C), running from Curtea de Arges to Cartisoara, and passing in front of the hydro power plant, on the Vidraru dam, and around Vidraru Lake.

<text>In response to the Stamp and Tea Acts, the Declaration of Rights and Grievances was a document written by the Stamp Act Congress and passed on October 14, 1765. American colonists opposed the acts because they were passed without the consideration of the colonists&#x27; opinion, violating their belief that there should be &quot;no taxation without Representation&quot;. The Declaration of Rights raised fourteen points of colonial protest but was not directed exclusively at the Stamp Act 1765, which required that documents, newspapers, and playing cards be printed on special stamped and taxed paper. In addition to the specific protests of the Stamp Act taxes, it made the assertions which follow:

*Colonists owe to the crown &quot;the same allegiance&quot; owed by &quot;subjects born within the realm&quot;.
*Colonists owe to Parliament &quot;all due subordination&quot;.
*Colonists possessed all the rights of Englishmen.
*Trial by jury is a right.
*The use of Admiralty Courts was abusive.
*Without voting rights, Parliament could not represent the colonists.
*There should be no taxation without representation.
*Only the colonial assemblies had a right to tax the colonies.

<text>&#x27;74 Jailbreak is the only EP by Australian rock band AC/DC, released in 1984. It is composed of five tracks that had previously been released only in Australia. Despite the EP&#x27;s title, the song &quot;Jailbreak&quot; was actually recorded in 1976 and was originally released that year on the Australian version of the &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; album. The EP&#x27;s four other tracks were originally released on the Australian version of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;High Voltage&quot;, recorded in 1974 and released early the following year.

&quot;Jailbreak&quot; was released as a single with accompanying music video at the same time as the EP. &quot;&#x27;74 Jailbreak&quot; was later re-released worldwide in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.

<text>Santa Fe Industries was the diversified parent company, headquartered in Chicago, of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Formed in 1968, its non-railroad operations included construction, real estate, and energy units. In the early 1980s, after longtime head John Shedd Reed had been succeeded by John J. Schmidt, they arranged a merger with the Southern Pacific, where new head Robert Krebs had recently succeeded Benjamin Biaggini.

When the Interstate Commerce Commission denied permission to merge the respective companies&#x27; railroad subsidiaries as the Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad, the merged holding company, which retained both companies&#x27; non-rail interests while being forced to sell the Southern Pacific, changed its name to Santa Fe Pacific Corporation.

It has also been linked to controversies in the book titled &quot;American House of Saud&quot; by Steven Emerson.

<text>Vidraru Dam is a dam in Romania. It was completed in 1966 on the Argeș River and creates Lake Vidraru. The arch dam was built with the primary purpose to produce hydroelectricity. The dam&#x27;s height is 166 metres, the arch length 305 meters and it can store 465 million cubic metres of water. The reservoir has a total shoreline (perimeter) length of 28 km.

==Background==

Located between Frunții Mountains and Ghițu mountains, the lake collects the Capra, Buda, and some other smaller rivers (Râul Doamnei, Cernatu, Vâlsan, Topolog, Valea lui Stan, and Limpedea), with a total flow of about 5.5 million L/s. The total surface of the lake is 3,930,000 sq m, 10.3 km in length, with a maximum width of 2.2 km in the Valea Lupului – Călugărița zone. Normal level or water retention is 830 metres above sea level (mdM). 

The dam&#x27;s construction took 5 and a half years. It required 42 km of tunnels, excavation of 1,768,000 cubic metres of hard rocks, out of which approximatively 1 million had to be extracted from underground, 930,000 cubic metres of concrete, out of which 400,000 cubic metres were underground and required the installation of 6,300 tons of electro-mechanical equipment.

When completed, it ranked 5th in Europe, and 9th in the world. In an average hydrological year it can generate approximately of 400 GWh/year. As of 2019, Vidraru Dam is the 16th tallest dam in Europe.

The Vidraru Hydro Power Plant has an installed capacity of 220 MW.

Above the Dam, on the left bank, a sculpture by called &quot;Electricitate&quot; dominates the landscape.

<text>Sigurd Rushfeldt (born 11 December 1972) is a Norwegian football coach and former player who works as an assistant coach for Tromsø. During his playing career, he played for Tromsø, Birmingham City, Rosenborg, Racing de Santander, and Austria Wien. As a forward, he is well known for his strength and for being a prolific goalscorer. Rushfeldt is the all-time top goal scorer of Eliteserien.

Rushfeldt scored 246 league goals in his career, including a record 172 in Eliteserien.

==Club career==

===Early career and Tromsø===
Rushfeldt was born in Vadsø, where he started his career in Vadsø Turn and Norild. He was noticed by Tromsø, which signed him in 1992. In Tromsø Rushfeldt got a reputation of being a prolific goalscorer as a forward. This sparked interest from other clubs, and in 1995 he went on an unsuccessful loan spell with Birmingham where he scored just once in the League Cup against Tranmere Rovers. It was not until the end of the 1996 season that Rushfeldt would move on. He then signed for Rosenborg, but not before playing in the cup final that would be Rushfeldt&#x27;s last match for Tromsø in his first spell with the club. Rushfeldt scored Tromsø&#x27;s second goal in the cup final securing a 2–1 win over rivals Bodø/Glimt.

===Rosenborg and move abroad===
With Rosenborg, Rushfeldt had great success. He won the Norwegian Premier League 4 times, he won the cup once more and also became topscorer of the Norwegian Premier League twice. The last time he won the Norwegian Premier League with Rosenborg in 2001, he was loaned in from Racing de Santander which he had transferred to in 1999. His spell with Santander was not a great success and in 2001 Rushfeldt moved on again, this time to Austria Wien. In Vienna he had success and won the league with Austria in 2003 and 2006 and was voted player of the year in the Austrian league 2004/2005. In 2003, 2005 and 2006 he also won the cup with Austria Wien. He scored 3 goals in these finals.

===Return to Tromsø===
He returned to Tromsø, which he had left in 1996, in July 2006. When his contract with Austria Wien was nearing an end Rushfeldt declared that he wanted to end his career in Norway. Several Norwegian clubs were interested in signing him. He chose to return to Tromsø declaring that he felt drawn to the north, and that he wanted to follow his heart and therefore it had to be Tromsø. In Tromsø, he was again paired up in front with former team-mate Ole Martin Årst, who also played in the 1996 cup final and had enjoyed a career as a professional player outside of Norway before he returned to Tromsø some years earlier. This partnership ended in July 2007, when Årst was sold. Rushfeldt has built up a new partnership upfront with Morten Moldskred. In November 2007 Rushfeldt was selected to be in the Norwegian Premier league team of the year by a group of Norwegian newspapers, stating that he is invaluable as a target man.

Rushfeldt signed a new contract with Tromsø before the 2009 season, a one-year extension that would see him take on the role of coach as well. He came off to a good start, scoring 5 goals in 4 appearances, including a brace away against SK Brann, a match that Tromsø went on to win 4–2.

Rushfeldt became the all-time top scorer of the Norwegian Tippeligaen on 29 May 2011, the day 19 years after his first goal there. In a home match against SK Brann he scored in the first half, equaling Harald Brattbakk&#x27;s record 166 goals. In the second half, he scored two more goals, completing a perfect hat-trick.

Rushfeldt&#x27;s last appearance as a professional football player came against IK Start in 2011. He helped his team to finishing runner-up in the league, equalling Tromsø&#x27;s best ever season, 1990, when they also finished runners-up.

Rushfeldt was given a testimonial match which was played at Alfheim Stadion on 2 June 2012. The match was played between two teams mostly made up of players he had played with during his career at Tromsø, Rosenborg. and Austria Wien, divided into a &quot;Tromsø All Stars&quot; and a &quot;Rosenborg All Stars&quot; team. Rushfeldt played the first half for Tromsø and most of the second half for Rosenborg, scoring once for each team. The match ended in a 6–4 victory for the Rosenborg team.

===Comeback with Lyngen/Karnes===
In May 2014, Rushfeldt announced that he would play for Lyngen/Karnes IL in the Norwegian fourth division (level 5 on the Norwegian football pyramid). In his debut for his new club, he scored twice. Rushfeldt will continue living in Tromsø and occasionally play for Lyngen/Karnes (in neighboring Lyngen Municipality) when his schedule permits it.

==International career==
In 1994, he surprisingly got a place in Egil Olsen&#x27;s squad for the 1994 World Cup in USA playing in one game, but Rushfeldt never established himself as a regular having only won a total of 7 caps by 2001, and he did not score his first goal until 2002 in a game against Japan. In 2006, he announced his decision to retire from the national team. However, in 2007 he reconsidered his decision and agreed with the national team coach Åge Hareide that he would make himself available for the game against Bosnia because John Carew was unavailable due to injury. He came on as a substitute in the game against Bosnia, making his first national team appearance in 2 years. Norway failed to qualify for the European Championship and he retired for good from the national team. He ended his international career playing 38 games scoring 7 goals.

==Coaching career==
In October 2013, Rushfeldt was appointed the assistant coach of Tromsø, after Steinar Nilsen replaced Agnar Christensen as head coach of the club.

<doc id="1207981" wikidata="Q885734" url="?curid=1207981" title="Blue Hole (Red Sea)">
<text>The Blue Hole is a diving location on the southeast Sinai, a few kilometres north of Dahab, Egypt on the coast of the Red Sea.

The Blue Hole is a submarine sinkhole, with a maximum depth within the hole of just over 100 m (328 feet). There is a shallow opening to the sea around 6 m (20 feet) deep, known as &quot;the saddle&quot;, and a 26 m (85 feet) long tunnel, known as &quot;the Arch&quot;, whose ceiling is at a depth of 55 m (181 feet) and whose bottom falls away as it reaches the seaward side to about 120 m (394 feet). On the seaward side the floor drops steeply to over . The hole and the surrounding area have an abundance of coral and reef fish. The Blue Hole is popular for freediving because of the depth directly accessible from shore and the lack of current.

The dive site is reputed to have the most diver fatalities in the world with estimates of between 130 and 200 fatalities in recent years. The reasons for why this site has such a high number of fatalities are not clearly understood.

== Diving history == 

The Blue Hole was historically avoided by Bedouin tribes people who inhabited the area.

The Sinai Peninsula was occupied by Israel from the Six-Day War of 1967 until it was returned to Egypt by Israel under the Egypt–Israel peace treaty in 1979. During the Israeli occupation, the Blue Hole developed a significant international reputation as a dive site. In 1968 a group of Israeli divers led by Alex Shell were the first to dive the hole with modern scuba diving equipment. During the dive, they noticed the underwater arch.

Since 1982 the Blue Hole has become very busy and is dived almost every day by recreational divers. Local dive centres take appropriately qualified divers to 30 m (AOW level or CMAS**) at the El Bells or Bells to Blue Hole sites. The Bells entry is from the shore further along from the Blue Hole. At 26 m at the bottom of the Bells is a mini arch that should not be confused with the arch in the Blue Hole itself. The dive is then a wall dive that finishes by crossing the Blue Hole saddle at a depth of 7 m. Recreational divers do not get to see the Blue Hole arch when doing the Bells to Blue Hole dive.

==Fatalities==
The Blue Hole itself is no more dangerous than any other Red Sea dive site but diving through the Arch, a submerged tunnel, which lies within the Blue Hole site, is an extreme dive that has resulted in many accidents and fatalities.
The number of Blue Hole fatalities is not accurately recorded; one source estimates 130 divers died during the fifteen-year period from 1997 to 2012, averaging over eight per year, another claims as many as 200. This includes some snorkelling deaths at the surface unrelated to diving the Arch. The Egyptian Chamber For Diving &amp; Watersports now stations a policeman at the Blue Hole to ensure divers are diving with a certified guide who will make sure safety procedures are followed.

The ceiling of the Arch is 55 m (170 ft) deep, which requires suitable training and equipment as 40 metres is generally considered the limit for recreational diving. The Arch presents little problem for suitably equipped and competent technical divers. The main challenge is gas management because any delays or errors at this depth, plus the time to negotiate the horizontal section, will need more than a single tank of breathing gas to do safely. If gas is not carefully planned the diver may lack sufficient gas for the decompression stops or run out of gas altogether.

The main reasons suggested for the accident rate include that the:
* Notoriety of the site attracts divers and presents a challenge that tempts many who lack the necessary competence.
* Accessibility of the site and the clear, warm waters of the Red Sea makes the dive look more benign than it is. At over 55 m, and with an overhead environment, the dive requires competence usually associated with moderately advanced technical certification, with a technical extended range (55 meters on air) or Tech 60 (normoxic trimix) as a minimum qualification. 
* The entry to the Arch is not easy to find because of the indirect line between the Blue Hole and open water. Divers who miss the entry may inadvertently continue to descend past it, while the floor continues on down to well over 100 m providing no visual depth reference.
* Time taken to pass through the Arch may be underestimated. The tunnel appears shorter than it actually is because of the clarity of the water, the light at the outside end and the lack of reference points; divers report that the tunnel appears to be less than 10 m long but has been measured as 26 m. Moreover, there is frequently a current flowing inward through the arch into the Blue Hole, increasing the time it takes to swim through and increasing gas consumption. 
* Depth and the time taken to find and navigate the tunnel inevitably makes this a decompression dive requiring decompression stops on ascent in order to avoid decompression sickness (DCS). Also, the rate of diving gas consumption increases with depth and effort, which can lead to divers running out of gas or beginning the ascent with insufficient gas to make the decompression stops required.
* The likelihood of nitrogen narcosis causing confusion leading to poor judgement in an already demanding situation is significant at this depth. Although the effects of nitrogen narcosis may be mitigated by using trimix or heliox the Arch is insufficiently deep to make its use obligatory.
* Temptation to dive on a single gas tank. The Arch has been dived on single, 11-litre tanks multiple times, but this is dangerously close to the minimum gas requirement for the dive and depends on a fit and relaxed diver with a low gas consumption rate committing no errors or hesitations during the dive. Diving the Arch without a stage tank and without adequate gas planning has resulted in drowning or DCS.

===Death of Yuri Lipski===

A notable death was that of Yuri Lipski, a 22-year-old Russian diving instructor, on 28 April 2000 at a depth of 115 metres after an uncontrolled descent. Lipski carried a video camera, which filmed his death. This has made it one of the most well-known diving deaths in the world. The video shows Lipski initiate a voluntary, uncontrolled descent, eventually landing on the sea floor at 115 metres where he panics, removes his regulator and tries to fill his buoyancy compensator but is unable to rise. At 115 m he would have been subject to severe nitrogen narcosis, which may have impaired his judgement, induced hallucinations and caused panic and confusion. Lipski had a single tank assumed to be air.

Lipski&#x27;s body was recovered the following day by Tarek Omar, one of the world&#x27;s foremost deep-water divers, at the request of Lipski&#x27;s mother. Omar had earlier warned Lipski twice against attempting the dive. On the bottom, Omar found Lipski&#x27;s helmet camera, still intact. The video it contained is available on YouTube, entitled &quot;Fatal Diving Accident Caught On Tape&quot;. Omar says:

<text>Polytene chromosomes are large chromosomes which have thousands of DNA strands. They provide a high level of function in certain tissues such as salivary glands of insects.

Polytene chromosomes were first reported by E.G.Balbiani in 1881. Polytene chromosomes are found in dipteran flies: the best understood are those of &quot;Drosophila&quot;, &quot;Chironomus&quot; and &quot;Rhynchosciara&quot;. They are present in another group of arthropods of the class Collembola, a protozoan group Ciliophora, mammalian trophoblasts and antipodal, and suspensor cells in plants. In insects, they are commonly found in the salivary glands when the cells are not dividing.

They are produced when repeated rounds of DNA replication without cell division forms a giant chromosome. Thus polytene chromosomes form when multiple rounds of replication produce many sister chromatids &quot;which stay fused together&quot;.

Polytene chromosomes, at interphase, are seen to have distinct thick and thin banding patterns. These patterns were originally used to help map chromosomes, identify small chromosome mutations, and in taxonomic identification. They are now used to study the function of genes in transcription.

== Function ==
In addition to increasing the volume of the cells&#x27; nuclei and causing cell expansion, polytene cells may also have a metabolic advantage as multiple copies of genes permits a high level of gene expression. In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, for example, the chromosomes of the larval salivary glands undergo many rounds of endoreduplication to produce large quantities of adhesive mucoprotein (&quot;glue&quot;) before pupation. Another example within the fly itself is the tandem duplication of various polytene bands located near the centromere of the X chromosome which results in the Bar phenotype of kidney-shaped eyes.

The interbands are involved in the interaction with the active chromatin proteins, nucleosome remodeling, and origin recognition complexes. Their primary functions are: to act as binding sites for RNA pol II, to initiate replication and, to start nucleosome remodeling of short fragments of DNA.

== Structure ==

In insects, polytene chromosomes are commonly found in the salivary glands; they are also referred to as &quot;salivary gland chromosomes&quot;. The large size of the chromosome is due to the presence of many longitudinal strands called chromonemata; hence the name polytene (many stranded). They are about 0.5 mm in length and 20 μm in diameter. The chromosomal strands are formed after repeated division of the chromosome in the absence of cytoplasmic division. This type of division is called endomitosis. The polytene chromosome contains two types of bands, dark bands and interbands. The dark bands are darkly stained and the inter bands are lightly stained with nuclear stains. The dark bands contain more DNA and less RNA. The interbands contain more RNA and less DNA. The amount of DNA in interbands ranges from 0.8 - 25%.

The bands of polytene chromosomes become enlarged at certain times to form swellings called puffs. The formation of puffs is called puffing. In the regions of puffs, the chromonemata uncoil and open out to form many loops. The puffing is caused by the uncoiling of individual chromomeres in a band. The puffs indicate the site of active genes where mRNA synthesis takes place. The chromonemata of puffs give out a series of many loops laterally. As these loops appear as rings, they are called Balbiani rings after the name of the researcher who discovered them. They are formed of DNA, RNA and a few proteins. As they are the site of transcription, transcription mechanisms such as RNA polymerase and ribonucleoproteins are present.

In protozoans, there is no transcription, since the puff consists only of DNA.

==History==
Polytene chromosomes were originally observed in the larval salivary glands of &quot;Chironomus&quot; midges by Édouard-Gérard Balbiani in 1881. Balbiani described the chromosomal puffs among the tangled thread inside the nucleus, and named it &quot;permanent spireme&quot;. In 1890, he observed similar spireme in a ciliated protozoan &quot;Loxophyllum meleagris&quot;. The existence of such spireme in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; was reported by Bulgarian geneticist Dontcho Kostoff in 1930. Kostoff predicted that the discs (bands) which he observed were &quot;the actual packets in which inherited characters are passed from generation to generation.&quot;

The hereditary nature of these structures was not confirmed until they were studied in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; in the early 1930s by German biologists Emil Heitz and Hans Bauer. In 1930, Heitz studied different species of &quot;Drosophila&quot; (&quot;D. melanogaster&quot;, &quot;D. simulans&quot;, &quot;D. hydei&quot;, and &quot;D. virilis&quot;) and found that all their interphase chromatins in certain cells were swollen and messy. In 1932, he collaborated with Karl Heinrich Bauer with whom he discovered that the tangled chromosomes having distinct bands are unique to the cells of the salivary glands, midgut, Malphigian tubules, and brain of the flies &quot;Bibio hurtulunus&quot; and &quot;Drosophila funebris&quot;. The two papers were published in the early 1933. Unaware of these papers, an American geneticist Theophilus Shickel Painter reported in December 1933 the existence of giant chromosome in &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; (followed by a series of papers the following year). Learning of this, Heitz accused Painter of deliberately ignoring their original publication to claim priority of discovery. In 1935, Hermann J. Muller and A.A. Prokofyeva established that the individual band or part of a band corresponds with a gene in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. The same year, P.C. Koller hesitantly introduced the name &quot;polytene&quot; to describe the giant chromosome, writing:
==Occurrence==

Polytene chromosomes are present in secretory tissues of dipteran insects such as the Malpighian tubules of &quot;Sciara&quot; and also in protists, plants, mammals, or in cells from other insects. Some of the largest polytene chromosomes described thus far occur in larval salivary gland cells of the chironomid genus &quot;Axarus&quot;.

In plants, they are found in only a few species, and are restricted to ovary and immature seed tissues such as in &quot;Phaseolus coccineus&quot; and &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; (Nagl, 1981), and the anther tapetum of &quot;Vigna unguiculata&quot; and of some &quot;Phaseolus&quot; species.

Polytene chromosomes are also used to identify the species of chironomid larvae that are notoriously difficult to identify. Each morphologically distinct group of larvae consists of a number of morphologically identical (sibling) species that can only be identified by rearing adult males or by cytogenetic analysis of the polytene chromosomes of the larvae. Karyotypes are used to confirm the presence of specific species and to study genetic diversity in species with a wide range of genetic variation.

<text>Dickinson State University (DSU) is a public university in Dickinson, North Dakota, United States. It is part of the North Dakota University System. It was founded in 1918 as Dickinson State Normal School and granted full university status in 1987.

==History==
Dickinson State was established as a normal school to fill a need for qualified teachers in rural western North Dakota, where fewer than one-quarter of the people working as teachers in the early 1900s were certified as teachers. The university considers June 24, 1918, to be its founding date; this was the first day of classes for the Dickinson Normal School. When first established, the school was tuition-free and operated in the facilities of Dickinson High School. The first campus building, May Hall, was built in 1924.

During World War II, Dickinson State Teachers College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

===Enrollment and graduation controversies===
In 2011 and 2012, Dickinson State attracted negative attention for some of its academic and business practices. In 2011, the university was discovered to have overstated its enrollments by practices such as counting people as students who had merely attended a conference on the campus. This situation resulted in the dismissal of the university president, Richard J. McCallum.

A North Dakota University System audit report released in February 2012 found that the school had relaxed standards and waived some requirements to increase enrollment of foreign students and had, over a period of several years, awarded degrees to 584 foreign students who had not completed the required coursework. The report was a followup of an earlier meeting between Dickinson officials and the Higher Learning Commission at which the DSU officials &quot;realized they may have an issue with one or more of the HLC&#x27;s requirements surrounding academic agreements&quot;. Most of the university&#x27;s foreign students came from China, where the university employed recruiting agents who falsely claimed to be university employees and sometimes misrepresented the university&#x27;s programs. News media accounts described the audit report as depicting Dickinson State as a degree mill. The audit had been requested by the university&#x27;s president, Douglas Coston, who took office as Interim President in August 2011, after some university international agreements were found not to conform with requirements of the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education and the Higher Learning Commission. On the day of the audit release, the Dean of Education committed suicide. Six months later, in July, Dickinson&#x27;s regional accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), placed the university &quot;on notice,&quot; requiring the university provide detailed responses to concerns found in the accreditor&#x27;s recent site visit. That status was removed three years later when HLC renewed DSU&#x27;s accreditation for ten years.

===Financial challenges===
In 2023, the university eliminated seven degree programs to address ongoing financial challenges. This included firing tenured faculty in those programs. The university&#x27;s decisions and actions were met with protests from faculty and others. University leaders also reorganized parts of the university and eliminated other positions. The following year, the university changed its academic policies to increase class sizes and require faculty to teach more students. In response, all seven faculty members in the university&#x27;s nursing program resigned, protesting that the new policies are unworkable in their program. The university was already under scrutiny by the program&#x27;s accreditor, the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, and the state&#x27;s board of nursing did not approve president Eaton&#x27;s plan for hiring new faculty. He subsequently announced his plans to resign and Dickinson&#x27;s nursing program partnered with Mayville State University to continue Dickinson&#x27;s nursing program.

==Academics==
Dickinson State offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in more than 75 fields of study through 10 academic departments. The university also offers certificates and associate degrees. However, it specializes in business management, teacher education, and nursing. Most students attending DSU are business management majors although education (both elementary and secondary), nursing, natural science, and agriculture majors constitute significant areas of study. There is also opportunity for pre-professional study and vocational training in selected areas.

Student programs are based on a core of General Education courses, including fine arts, humanities, natural sciences, mathematics, and the social and behavioral sciences. Dickinson State University students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements by the end of the sophomore year. Students are then free as juniors and seniors to explore a major field of study.

===Accreditation===
Dickinson State University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Although the university was placed &quot;on notice&quot; in July 2012 it was removed from that status in October 2013 and is fully accredited.

==Athletics==
The Dickinson State athletic teams are called the Blue Hawks. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the North Star Athletic Association (NSAA) for most of its sports since the 2014–15 academic year; while its men&#x27;s wrestling team competes in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC). The Blue Hawks previously competed in the Frontier Conference from 2012–13 to 2013–14; as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) during the 2011–12 school year; and in these defunct conferences: the Dakota Athletic Conference (DAC) from 2000–01 to 2010–11; and the North Dakota College Athletic Conference (NDCAC) from 1931–32 to 1999–2000. The team was known as the Savages until 1972 when they changed their name to the Blue Hawks.

Dickinson State competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading, eSports and rodeo.

Hank Biesiot is a former football coach and was one of the few active coaches at the college level with 200 or more wins and 30 or more seasons. Biesiot led the Blue Hawks to the NAIA semifinals in 1991. The women&#x27;s volleyball team won the school&#x27;s first national championship in 2000. The men&#x27;s track and field team won NAIA national championships three consecutive years from 2004 to 2006 under coach Pete Stanton. They were national runner up five other times in the eight-year period from 2003 to 2010.

==Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library==
On April 30, 2013, both chambers of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly passed a bill appropriating $12 million to Dickinson State University to award a grant to the Theodore Roosevelt Center for construction of a building to be named the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library. To access these funds, the Theodore Roosevelt Center must first raise $3 million from non-state sources. Dickinson State University is also home to the Theodore Roosevelt Digital Library which has formed partnerships with the Library of Congress and Harvard University, among other institutions. They currently have over 25,000 items online.

<text>Takumar is the name that Asahi Optical gave to its lenses, notably but not exclusively those for its own SLR cameras. Named after the Japanese-American portrait painter, , whose brother Kumao Kajiwara founded Asahi Optical. The name adorned its lenses until 1975, when Asahi switched from the M42 screw mount to the bayonet K-mount. K-mount lenses were simply named &quot;SMC Pentax&quot;. Some Takumar lenses were also made for the K-mount.

==Details==
The Takumar designation was used on lenses designed for Asahi&#x27;s 35 mm cameras, 6×7 cameras, and for other purposes too.

* &quot;Takumar&quot; lenses were made in M37 screwmount for the original Asahiflex cameras and continued into the M42 period.
* &quot; lenses were a type of preset lens. The user selected an aperture then engaged a lever to energise the stopping-down mechanism. The camera would then trip this mechanism when the shutter was fired.
* &quot; lenses featured an improved form of lens coating (to reduce flare) and a more sophisticated stopping-down mechanism. There was a switch on the lens to select &quot;Auto&quot; or &quot;Manual&quot; modes. In manual mode, the lens would always be in the selected aperture. In Auto mode, the lens would remain wide open (at maximum aperture) until a pin on the rear of the lens was pushed in. This pin would be automatically pushed in by the camera when the shutter was tripped.
* &quot;Super-Multi-Coated&quot; (later &quot;SMC&quot;) &quot;Takumar&quot;. These lenses introduced Asahi&#x27;s lens multi-coating process (to further reduce reflections and flare). They also introduced a lug on the rear of the lens which moved with the aperture selected. When used with a camera body which could read the lug, this enabled the use of open-aperture metering. Examples of such cameras are Asahi&#x27;s Spotmatic F and the ES/ESII. These SMC-Takumar M42 thread mount lenses included: 15/3.5 rectilinear ultra-wide angle, 17/4 full-frame fisheye, 20/4.5, 24/3.5, 28/3.5, 35/2.8, 50/1.4, 50/4 macro, 55/1.8, 55/2, 85/1.8, 100/4 macro, 105/2.8, 120/2.8, 135/2.5, 135/3.5, 150/4, 200/4, 300/4, 400/5.6, 500/4.5, 1000/8.

Pentax resurrected the Takumar name in the 1980s and 1990s for a budget line of zoom and prime lenses that lacked the Pentax &quot;Super Multi-Coating&quot; anti-reflective coating that reduces lens flare. These lenses are marked &quot;Takumar (Bayonet)&quot; or &quot;Takumar-F&quot; to distinguish them from the older screw-mount Takumar lenses.

Non-Asahi cameras with Asahi lenses branded Takumar include the Suzuki Press Van and two versions of the Takane Mine Six.

<text>In biological taxonomy, the type genus is the genus which defines a biological family and the root of the family name.

== Zoological nomenclature ==
According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, &quot;The name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon is a nominal genus called the &#x27;type genus&#x27;; the family-group name is based upon that of the type genus.&quot;

Any family-group name must have a type genus (and any genus-group name must have a type species, but any species-group name may, but need not, have one or more type specimens). The type genus for a family-group name is also the genus that provided the stem to which was added the ending -idae (for families).

:Example: The family name Formicidae has as its type genus the genus &quot;Formica&quot; 

== Botanical nomenclature ==
In botanical nomenclature, the phrase &quot;type genus&quot; is used, unofficially, as a term of convenience. In the &quot;ICN&quot; this phrase has no status. The code uses type specimens for ranks up to family, and types are optional for higher ranks. The Code does not refer to the genus containing that type as a &quot;type genus&quot;.

:Example: &quot;&quot;Poa&quot; is the type genus of the family Poaceae and of the order Poales&quot; is another way of saying that the names Poaceae and Poales are based on the generic name &quot;Poa&quot;.

== Bacteriological nomenclature ==
The 2008 Revision of the Bacteriological Code states, &quot;The nomenclatural type […] of a taxon above genus, up to and including order, is the legitimate name of the included genus on whose name the name of the relevant taxon is based. One taxon of each category must include the type genus. The names of the taxa which include the type genus must be formed by the addition of the appropriate suffix to the stem of the name of the type genus[…].&quot; In 2019, it was proposed that all ranks above genus should use the genus category as the nomenclatural type. This proposal was subsequently adopted for the rank of phylum.

:Example: &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; is the type genus of the family Pseudomonadaceae, the order Pseudomonadales, and the phylum Pseudomonadota.

<text>Emu Plains Correctional Centre is an Australian minimum security prison, previously known as Penrith minimum security prison. It is located on Old Bathurst Rd, Emu Plains, New South Wales. The centre is operated by Corrective Services NSW an agency of the Department of Communities and Justice of the Government of New South Wales. The centre detained sentenced and remand prisoners under New South Wales and/or Commonwealth legislation. It is temporarily closed.

==Facilities==
Established as a working dairy farm in 1914, the Emu Plains Prison Farm accommodated male inmates as part of a process of rehabilitation through farming. The centre was remodelled in 1957 as Emu Plains Training Centre and again in 1976 as Emu Plains Detention Centre. In 1994, the centre was again remodelled and all male inmates were transferred to other correctional facilities, with the Emu Plain Correctional Centre created as a minimum security prison for women.
In 1996 a women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s program was established that permitted inmates to maintain closer contact with their children. The program allows some children to stay with their mother in custody and also allows inmates to make recordings of book readings for their children.

Inmates were employed in the dairy for dairy processing, and previously assisted in the breeding and training of assistance dogs to help people with disabilities. Emu Plains also ran a work release program.

<doc id="1208022" wikidata="Q3312266" url="?curid=1208022" title="Loose connective tissue">
<text>Loose connective tissue, also known as areolar tissue, is a cellular connective tissue with thin and relatively sparse collagen fibers. They have a semi-fluid matrix with lesser proportions of fibers. Its ground substance occupies more volume than the fibers do. It has a viscous to gel-like consistency and plays an important role in the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients from the capillaries that course through this connective tissue as well as in the diffusion of carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes back to the vessels. Moreover, loose connective tissue is primarily located beneath the epithelia that cover the body surfaces and line the internal surfaces of the body. It is also associated with the epithelium of glands and surrounds the smallest blood vessels. This tissue is thus the initial site where pathogenic agents, such as bacteria that have breached an epithelial surface, are challenged and destroyed by cells of the immune system.

In the past, the designations areolar tissue, adipose tissue, and reticular tissue have been listed as subsets of loose connective tissue. However, they are no longer considered subsets of loose connective tissue. Loose connective tissue is a subset of connective tissue proper. Furthermore, areolar tissue is the same as loose connective tissue, adipose tissue is a subset of specialized connective tissue, and reticular tissue is the presence of reticular fibers and reticular cells together forming the stroma of hemopoietic tissue (specifically the red bone marrow) and lymphatic tissue organs (lymph nodes and spleen but not the thymus).

Most cell types in loose connective tissue are transient wandering cells that migrate from local blood vessels in response to specific stimuli. Loose connective tissue, therefore, is a site of inflammatory and immune reactions. In areas of the body where foreign substances are continually present, large populations of immune cells are maintained. For example, the lamina propria, the loose connective tissue of mucous membranes, such as those of the respiratory and alimentary systems, contains large numbers of these cells.

==Structure==
===Composition===

It is a pliable, mesh-like tissue with a fluid matrix and functions to cushion and protect body organs.

Fibroblasts are widely dispersed in this tissue; they are irregular branching cells that secrete strong fibrous proteins and proteoglycans as an extracellular matrix.

The cells of this type of tissue are generally connected by a gelatinous substance known as ground substance primarily made up of collagenous and elastic fibers.

===Location===
It may be found in tissue sections from almost every part of the body. It surrounds blood vessels and nerves and penetrates with them even into the small spaces of muscles, tendons, and other tissues. It may likewise be present in the mediastinal extremities. Nearly every epithelium rests on a layer of areolar tissue, whose blood vessels provide the epithelium with nutrition, waste removal, and a ready supply of infection-fighting leukocytes when needed. Because of the abundance of open, fluid-filled space, leukocytes can move about freely in areolar tissue and can easily find and destroy pathogens.

The areolar tissue is found beneath the epidermis layer and is also underneath the epithelial tissue of all the body systems that have external openings.
it makes the skin elastic and helps it to withstand pulling pain. It is also a component of the lamina propria of the digestive and respiratory tracts, the mucous membranes of reproductive and urinary systems, the stroma of glands, and the hypodermis of the skin.
It is also found in the mesentery which is surrounding the intestine.

===Fibers===
Loose connective tissue is named based on the &quot;weave&quot; and type of its constituent fibers. There are three main types:
* Collagenous fibers: collagenous fibers are made of collagen and consist of bundles of fibrils that are coils of collagen molecules.
* Elastic fibers: elastic fibers are made of elastin and are &quot;stretchable.&quot;
* Reticular fibers: reticular fibers consist of one or more types of very thin collagen fibers. They join connective tissues to other tissues.

===Areolar tissue===
Areolar tissue ( or ) is a common type of loose connective tissue (and the most widely distributed type of connective tissue in vertebrates). It is so-named because its fibers are far enough apart to leave ample open space for interstitial fluid in between (&quot;&quot; is Latin for a &quot;little open space&quot;). It is strong enough to bind different tissue types together, yet soft enough to provide flexibility and cushioning. It exhibits interlacing, loosely organized fibers, abundant blood vessels, and significant empty space filled with interstitial fluid. Many adjacent epithelial tissues (which are avascular) get their nutrients from the interstitial fluid of areolar tissue; the lamina propria is areolar in many body locations. Its fibers run in random directions and are mostly collagenous, but elastic and reticular fibers are also present. Areolar tissue is highly variable in appearance. In many serous membranes, it appears as a loose arrangement of collagenous and elastic fibers, scattered cells of various types; abundant ground substance; numerous blood vessels. In the skin and mucous membranes, it is more compact and sometimes difficult to distinguish from dense irregular connective tissue.

==Function==
Areolar connective tissue holds organs in place and attaches epithelial tissue to other underlying tissues. It also serves as a reservoir of water and salts for surrounding tissues. Almost all cells obtain their nutrients from and release their wastes into areolar connective tissue.

==Clinical significance==

Organs that are rich in loose connective tissue (such as the eyelids) are usually sites that undergo oedema, indicating kidney failure or nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, periorbital swelling is one characteristic finding in severe kidney disease.

<text>Lala Ram VC (20 April 187623 March 1927) was an Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth soldiers.

== Details ==

Lala Ram was born at Parol village,Hamirpur, Kangra district in then the Punjab province, on 20 April 1876. Some accounts give 20 Feb. 1882. If 1876 is correct, he would have been nearly 40 when he earned the VC in 1916. The son of Dhinga, a 1st Grade zamindar, he was apparently not formally educated but could read and write Hindi and enlisted in the newly raised (1900) 41st Dogra regiment in 1901; he was by all accounts a good sportsman and a football player in his regiment. Before the war, he served with the 41st in their deployment to the China coast between 1904-1908.

In August 1923, Lala was commissioned as Jemadar, which means that his war record and his career become more easily traceable. &quot;War Services&quot; in Indian Army Lists show that he served initially in Egypt on the Suez Canal defences and then went with his regiment to France, where he was wounded in action and was one of those Indian casualties who were nursed in the converted Brighton Pavilion, adapted as a hospital for Indian soldiers on the grounds that Indians might feel more at home in the &quot;eastern&quot; architecture of that exotic building!

On recovery, he joined his regiment in Mesopotamia. British and Indian forces (forming Expeditionary Force &quot;D&quot;) had landed in the Persian Gulf as early as November 1914, initially only to secure the oil refineries at the head of the Shatt-al-Arab and around Basra. However, the commanding officer, General Charles Townshend, was drawn into a much larger campaign and, convinced he could take Baghdad, advanced up the Tigris. Defeating the Turks at Qurna, Es Sinn and Nasiriya, he fought the desperate three-day action at Ctesiphon in November 1915 but such were his losses in that pyrrhic victory that he was forced to retreat to Kut -al-Amara and there began the infamous &quot;siege of Kut&quot;, which culminated in April 1916 with one of the most humiliating defeats in British military history - the surrender of the entire garrison, many of whom went on to face horrific conditions as Turkish prisoners of war.

While the siege lasted, British and Indian reinforcements on a large scale were dispatched to Mesopotamia and made a series of hard fought but ultimately futile attempts to relieve the besieged garrison. Tens of thousands of casualties were suffered in the repeated attempts to break through a series of well-defended Turkish positions along the Tigris and en route to Kut.

In one of these desperate enterprises, Lala was to win the Victoria Cross. The 41st Dogras were part of the force which, along with the 2nd Black Watch, 9th Bhopals, 37th Dogras and 6th Jats, assaulted the Turkish entrenchments near the ruins of Al Orah on the Tigris close to the Hanna defile, 30 miles down-river from Kut. Here, the relief force (reduced to around 10,000 men) encountered 30,000 men of the Ottoman Sixth Army; after a short bombardment on 20–21 January 1916, the 7th Division attacked the Ottoman lines. In an advance across 600 yards of flooded no-man&#x27;s land and later in pouring rain, the British force was beaten back, sustaining 2,700 casualties. According to their War Diary, only 25 men of the 41st reach the enemy trenches and the regiment came out of action with only 155 officers and men. The strength of the well-prepared Ottoman positions forced the abandonment of the assault and the withdrawal of the relief force to the base at Ali Gharbi.

Lance Naik Lala was rewarded with the VC for his action in rescuing a number of wounded men shortly after the assault on 21 January. The citation in the London Gazette reads:

&#x27;For most conspicuous bravery. Finding a British officer of another regiment lying close to the enemy, he dragged him into a temporary shelter, which he himself had made, and in which he had already bandaged four wounded men. After bandaging his wounds, he heard calls from the Adjutant of his own regiment, who was lying in the open severely wounded. The enemy were not more than one hundred yards distant, and it seemed certain death to go out in that direction, but Lance-Naik Lala insisted on going out to his Adjutant, and offered to crawl back with him on his back at once. When this was not permitted, he stripped off his own clothing to keep the wounded officer warmer, and stayed with him till just before dark, when he returned to the shelter. After dark he carried the first wounded officer back to the main trenches, and then, returning with a stretcher, carried back his Adjutant. He set a magnificent example of courage and devotion to his officers&#x27; (London Gazette 13 May 1916).

In effect, Lala rescued six men, including his own Adjutant (Captain E.L.E. Lindop M.C., who regrettably died of his wounds on 30 January 1916, though not before relating Lala&#x27;s bravery), but the citation hardly does justice to the awful circumstances surrounding Lala&#x27;s efforts. Other descriptions offer a more in-depth account, especially emphasising not only the danger from close Turkish fire, but also the terrible weather conditions which prevailed on the day. Edmund Candler, in The Sepoy reports one of Lala&#x27;s officers relating that:
Lala was out all day and most of the night and earned his VC a dozen times. It seemed certain death to go out ... with the enemy only a hundred yards off. But he insisted on going out ... There was a freezing wind and the wounded lay in pools of rain and flooded marsh all night; some were drowned, others died of exposure. It was a typically Dogra-like act of Lala to strip himself and to make a shield of his body for his Adjutant ... and the Adjutant was only one of five officers and comrades [actually six] whom Lala saved that day&quot;.
No less a figure than Major General Sir George Younghusband, who commanded the 7th division, relates the events in greater detail in A Soldier&#x27;s Memories of Peace and War:

A heavy frontal attack was taking place across the dead flat open ground before the Turkish trenches, which were strongly held. On our left, the attack partially succeeded but all along the rest of the line it was held up at distances varying from 100 to 500 yards from the Turks. At this moment Sepoy (now Lance Naik) Lalla came across a Major in his regiment, 150 yards from the enemy line, lying completely exposed in the open and trying to bandage a grievous wound. Lalla dragged him a few yards into a very slight depression, only a few inches deep, and there bound up the Major&#x27;s wounds. Whilst doing so, he heard other cries for help and sallying forth dragged four more of his comrades into the meagre shelter and bound up their wounds. 
Meanwhile, it had come on to rain hard and a pitiless icy wind sprang up. Then Lalla heard another voice calling for help about fifty yards to the front and only a hundred yards from the Turkish trenches. He recognised the voice and said to the Major: &quot;That is my Adjutant Sahib calling. I must go out to help him&quot;. 
&quot;No, Lalla, it is quite useless&quot;, said the Major; &quot;You will certainly be shot dead and therefore be of no use&quot;.
Then, seeing that Lalla was still determined to go, the Major said: I order you not to go; lie down&quot;.
Lalla lay still for a while and then again heard the voice from the front calling for help. Lalla jumped up and said &quot;I&#x27;ll be back in a minute&quot; and dashed off to the Adjutant. This officer, just before he was taken into the operating room in hospital, where he died, dictated his account to a brother officer:
&quot;I was shot down in the open about a hundred yards from the enemy and lay in great agony. An officer of the Black Watch, who was lying a few yards off, tried to crawl to my assistance but was instantly shot dead. Every time I made the slightest movement, bullets whistled past me or through me. Then came a Sepoy to my assistance and he was also shot dead. Then it came on to rain and a bitter wind sprang up. Then, as I lay in great pain, suddenly appeared Lalla and lay down beside me with cheering words. First he bound up my wounds and then taking off his own coat spread it over me. He then lay down lengthways so as to protect me from the enemy&#x27;s bullets. For five hours he lay like this in the wet and cold and all the time kept talking to me cheerfully and encouragingly to keep my spirits up. At length, when it grew dark, he crept off and said he was going back to get assistance and would soon return. I slept or dozed for some time and then heard Lalla&#x27;s return.
&quot;It is good, Sahib, very good. I have brought up some stretcher-bearers not far from here. I will lie flat whilst you get on my back and then I will crawl away with you on my hands and knees&quot;.
With great difficulty the Adjutant obeyed these instructions and was borne painfully many hundreds of yards by Lalla to the stretcher bearers. Then Lalla said: &quot;I must return now and fetch the Major and the four Sepoys&quot;.
And this he did, and brought them all safely out. And, wonderful to relate, he was not touched by bullet or shell, all day or all night. Next morning he was as hale and cheerful as ever and grinned with great joy when he heard that he was a brave man! The Victoria Cross had only recently been granted to Indian soldiers and perhaps there is no worthier wearer of the badge of honour than Lance Naik Lalla of the Dogras&quot;. 
(pp. 334–336)

Lala was also awarded the 1st Class of the Russian Cross of St. George (AO 1065 of 1917) – a unique combination to an Indian soldier – and Mentioned in Dispatches (L.G. 17 Oct. 1916). Lala returned to India in 1917. The Governor-General of India, Lord Chelmsford, at a special parade on Tuesday, 30 January 1917, at the vice-regal lodge, Delhi, India, presented medals and orders to 200 Indian officers and men including the Victoria Cross to Lance-Naik Lala, 41st Dogras, and two other Indian soldiers.

Lala saw further action as a Havildar with the 41st Dogras in the Third Afghan War in 1919. He was later awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in the re-numbered 3-17 Dogras, in addition to gaining advancement to officer rank as Jemadar in 1923. He retired after 25 years&#x27; service in 1926 and returned to his home in Parol but sad to say did not live long to enjoy an honourable retirement. He contracted polio and died in March 1927; his remains were cremated there shortly afterwards. It is said that his last words were &quot;We fought true&quot;.

Nowadays, Lala Ram takes an honoured place amongst India&#x27;s winners of the Victoria Cross and was named on a memorial plaque recently presented by Great Britain to the Indian Government to commemorate their VC winners. At one stage, a local park was named after him and although it was subsequently re-named there are calls for it to be restored under his name. Sadly, his V.C. group has not fared well. His actual Victoria Cross has never been found and the remnants of his medal group turned up in a dealer&#x27;s box in India – but comprised only his British War Medal, India General Service Medal and M.S.M.

== The Medal ==

His British War Medal, India General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Afghanistan/NWF 1919&quot; and his Meritorious Service Medal survive and have several times been for sale, most recently in auction in London in June 2013. and then on a medal-dealer&#x27;s site. The whereabouts of his actual VC are unknown and his Russian Gold Cross of St. George is equally &quot;missing&quot;.

<text>Wildman River Wilderness Work Camp was an Australian minimum security prison for juvenile males located in the Northern Territory of Australia in the Mary River National Park about from the territory capital of Darwin.

==Facilities==
Established during the 1980s, the work camp was designed for juvenile detainees from remote Aboriginal communities. The focus of the camp was on reparation through work for the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory, other government agencies and service clubs. The camp has capacity for 20 male detainees and offers case management in support of offender rehabilitation. As at 2005, the facility was not in operation.

<text>The Don Dale Youth Detention Centre is a facility for juvenile detention in the Northern Territory, Australia, located in Berrimah, east of Darwin. It is a detention centre for male and female juvenile delinquents. The facility is named after Don Dale, a former Member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1983 to 1989 and one-time Minister for Correctional Services.

On 25 July 2016, the ABC broadcast a &quot;Four Corners&quot; report that disclosed the abuse of youths in the Northern Territory corrections system which triggered the Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention in the Northern Territory.

==Original facilities==

The Don Dale Youth Detention Centre was the Northern Territory&#x27;s first purpose-built institution for young male and female offenders from across the Northern Territory aged from 10 to 16 years. Built in 1991, it was originally located adjacent to Berrimah Prison. The facility replaced Malak House, which had operated as a detention centre since 1987. Don Dale provided medium- to high-level detention, usually in single cells. In the early 2000s all detainees at Don Dale were expected to attend school unless they were involved in vocational programs.

==Administration==
The facility is administered by Territory Families, since a departmental reorganisation following the Labor victory at the August 2016 Northern Territory general election.

==21st century timeline==
===2000: Death in Custody===
In February 2000, 16-year-old Aboriginal boy named Johnno Johnson Wurramarrba from Groote Eylandt died by suicide at Don Dale. Wurramarrba had been sentenced in January to 28 days detention under the Northern Territory&#x27;s mandatory sentencing laws for stealing petrol and paint from Angurugu School on Groote Eylandt. A Coronial Inquiry into the circumstances of the death resulted in a number of recommendations being made relating to training of staff and management practices in the centre.

In 2011, Xzibit, a US rapper, visited the centre and talked to inmates about his life experiences, following being detained in a juvenile detention centre as a 14-year-old.

===2014: Use of tear gas, relocation===
In August 2014, six boys were in solitary confinement cells in the Behavioural Management Unit. One boy walked out of an unlocked cell, and beat on a locked reinforced door. The staff declared that there was a &quot;riot&quot;, and released tear gas into the hallway, gassing all six boys. It took up to eight minutes to remove the boys in their cells from the tear gas. A news release to the media falsely asserted that six boys had escaped from their cells, despite CCTV in the hallway showing only one boy in the hallway. The incident, among others, was investigated by the Northern Territory Children&#x27;s Commissioner Colleen Gywnne in a report provided in August 2015 to the then Corrections Minister John Elferink.

On 4 June 2020, the High Court of Australia found the use of the gas was unlawful.

Following the tear gas incident, the youths were moved from Malak House to formerly adult Berrimah Prison and Malak House was closed. In September 2014, the prison was renamed &quot;Don Dale Youth Detention Centre&quot;. The North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency remained critical of conditions at the new site.

===July 2016: &quot;Four Corners&quot; program===

Use of restraint chairs and cable ties on children was expressly legalised by the Northern Territory Government in May 2016 and were used at facilities in both Darwin and Alice Springs.

Graphic footage of repeated child abuse at Don Dale, including the 2014 tear gas incident, was featured in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Four Corners&quot; episode &quot;Australia&#x27;s Shame&quot;, which aired on 25 July 2016. Later in the year the documentary was televised worldwide. Teenage boys were shown being assaulted, stripped naked and tear-gassed. They were being held in isolation up to 72 hours with no running water. The program also showed a 17-year-old boy shackled and hooded in a chair at a facility in Alice Springs.

The Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it was &quot;shocked&quot; at the &quot;appalling treatment&quot; of the detainees, which violates the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, to which Australia is party. Global broadcast of the documentary caused worldwide astonishment about the inadequate actions of the minister.

Following national outrage, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention in the Northern Territory. John Elferink was sacked as Corrections Minister the morning after the program aired. The corrections and justice portfolios were taken on by Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles. Use of restraint chairs and spit hoods were then suspended.

On 28 July 2016, it was announced that the 33 youths incarcerated in the centre were to be moved to the Wickham Point Detention Centre, a former immigration detention centre, located around south of Darwin. The Wickham Point Detention Centre has been deemed by the Australian Human Rights Commission to be &quot;completely inappropriate for children&quot;. Within 24 hours the decision to close the centre and relocate the detainees &quot;had been scrapped for the time being&quot;, with Chief Minister Giles saying that the facilities at Don Dale were &quot;good enough&quot;.

===August 2016: Royal Commission===

The Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory was established on 1 August 2016. While the commission was expected to report by 31 March 2017, the final reporting date was extended three times due to the extent of documentary evidence and witnesses, to
17 November 2017. The report made more than 200 recommendations including the closure of the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre.

===2017 onwards ===
In April 2018, the Northern Territory Government announced it would commit to build new youth detention centres in Darwin and Alice Springs as part of a $229.6 million package to overhaul the child protection and youth justice systems and implement the recommendations of the royal commission.

By November 2018, the facility was still in use. It was then revealed in Northern Territory Parliament that female detainees were being forced to shower while under video surveillance.

On 6 November 2018, a major disturbance broke out at Don Dale. Detainees escaped from their cells by stealing keys and attempted to break out of the facility using power tools. The school room at the facility was burnt and tear gas was used. The detainees were moved from the damaged detention centre to the Darwin watch house.

In May 2019, it was reported that every single child in detention in the Northern Territory – 22 boys and 2 girls – was Aboriginal, with 11 of them in Don Dale. Territory Families said it was still &quot;not ready&quot; to implement some of the key recommendations of the Royal Commission. The age of criminal responsibility had still not been raised to 12, nor the age of detention to 14 years old.

<text>The Chambly Canal is a National Historic Site of Canada in the Province of Quebec, running along the Richelieu River past Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Carignan, and Chambly. Building commenced in 1831 and the canal opened in 1843. It served as a major commercial route during a time of heightened trade between the United States and Canada. Trade dwindled after World War I, and as of the 1970s, traffic has been replaced by recreational vessels.

It is part of a waterway that connects the Saint Lawrence River with the Hudson River in the United States. Lake Champlain and the Champlain Canal form the U.S. portion of the Lakes to Locks Passage.

The Canal has 10 bridges—8 of which are hand operated—and nine hydraulic locks.

<text>Oshirogo (御城碁 &quot;castle Go&quot;) or castle games were official matches of high-level Go played in Japan during the Edo period, usually in the castles of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. Players were mostly from the four go houses.

Matches were played in the &quot;shōgun&quot;&#x27;s presence. With the passage of the years, this became a formality: the players would replay a game that had already been played, and the &quot;shōgun&quot; would often be represented by an official, rather than attend himself. The games themselves were, though, bitterly contested, since the castle games had a major effect on the prestige of the four houses. Throughout the Tokugawa shogunate there was an ongoing struggle to take control of the official positions of &quot;Meijin&quot; and &quot;godokoro&quot;.

Hundreds of game records of the castle games survive; a large collection was edited by Kensaku Segoe.

The game series was suspended in 1862 as the political situation became tense. Apart from one 1863 game between Hayashi Hakuei and Yasui Sanei, it was never resumed.

<text>Stanley Brian Hagen (March 11, 1940 – January 20, 2009) was a Canadian politician who served in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on two separate occasions. He was the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the riding of Comox from 1986 to 1991 as part of the British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socred), and MLA for the riding of Comox Valley as part of the British Columbia Liberal Party from 2001 until his death. During his political career, he served as minister for 10 different ministries; he was the Minister of Agriculture and Lands when he died.

==Background==
Stan Hagen was born in New Westminster to mother Sigrid Thompson and father Baard Hagen, a butcher who operated a meat and grocery store in that city; Baard was originally from Norway. After graduating from Pacific Lutheran University in 1963, Stan Hagen married Judith Robins in 1967, with whom he had five children. He had lived in the Comox Valley since 1968 with his family, working as a comptroller for a construction company before starting his own ready-mix concrete business. From 1972 to 1978 he served as a trustee with the Comox Valley School District.

==Politics==
===Social Credit Party===
Running for the Social Credit Party, Hagen was first elected to the provincial legislature in 1986 to represent the riding of Comox. He was named to the cabinet of Premier Bill Vander Zalm that November as Minister of Continuing Education and Job Training; his title was modified to Minister of Advanced Education and Job Training one month later. He resigned from the post in July 1987 amidst allegations of conflict of interest involving his ready-mix company, but was re-instated that August. He additionally served as Minister of State for the Vancouver Island/Coast Region between October 1987 and July 1988, and as Minister Responsible for Science and Technology from July 1988 to November 1989.

He was re-assigned in November 1989 as Minister of Regional and Economic Development, before becoming Minister of Education in December 1990. Hagen was best known for being integral in the creation of Science World and for his support of the TRIUMF particle accelerator at the University of British Columbia. Following Vander Zalm&#x27;s resignation as premier in April 1991, Hagen continued as Minister of Education in Rita Johnston&#x27;s cabinet, and briefly covered the portfolio of Advanced Education, Training and Technology in the month of May 1991. He lost his seat in the 1991 election when all but seven Socred MLAs were defeated. 

===Liberal Party===
He worked at a paving company as general manager until his return to politics in 2001, when he ran for the BC Liberals in the riding of Comox Valley in that year&#x27;s provincial election, defeating incumbent New Democratic Party candidate Evelyn Gillespie. He was named to Premier Gordon Campbell&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of Sustainable Resource Management that June, and additionally served as Minister of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries from January to April 2003 while John van Dongen was under investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He was re-assigned as Minister of Human Resources in January 2004, then replaced the outgoing Christy Clark as Minister of Children and Family Development that September. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2004 and received treatment.

After winning re-election in 2005, he kept the same post in the Campbell cabinet before being named Minister of Tourism, Sport and the Arts in August 2006. He served as Minister of Agriculture and Lands from June 2008 until January 20, 2009, when he died of a massive heart attack at the age of 68.

==Honours==
He received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Simon Fraser University in June 1998. In August 2009, Hagen was inducted into the Comox Valley Walk of Achievement. In December 2011, Hagen was memorialized by the Salvation Army, which renamed its Victoria Family Centre the &quot;Stan Hagen Centre for Families&quot;. Stan Hagen Nature Park and Stan Hagen Theatre, both in the city of Courtenay, were named in his honour.

While still in office, he was honoured by the K&#x27;omoks First Nation with the name &quot;Ti’ axwsam&quot; (Red Cod).

His recordings include the Billboard charting rap single &quot;Restless&quot; (#18 July 1999) off his first national landmark LP &quot;Thug Ride&quot;.

<doc id="1208113" wikidata="Q7168627" url="?curid=1208113" title="Symonston Correctional Centre">
<text>Symonston Correctional Centre is a former minimum security Australian prison located in Symonston, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Its recent capacity was 22 when in use. It was formerly the Quamby Children&#x27;s Remand Centre, and later the Symonston Periodic Detention Centre.

As of October 2022, The Symonston Correctional Centre remained designated as a correctional institution within ACT but was deemed unsuitable for continued operation in its intended capacity. According to the ACT Government, significant renovations would be necessary to upgrade its infrastructure to meet the requisite standards for security and safety for a permanent correctional facility. The Symonston Correctional Centre is occasionally used by the ACT Corrective Services and various other agencies for training activities.

==Quamby==
The Quamby Youth Detention Centre originally opened in 1962 and was used as a shelter for young people who had nowhere to reside, or for young people who were placed on short term remand. Those who received a committal term from the courts were housed at New South Wales training centres.

Quamby, a medium to low security facility, can accommodate up to 26 children and young people who have been refused bail or sentenced to a period of detention. The Children’s Court may pass a sentence of up to two years. However, a longer sentence may be handed down if the child or young person is sentenced through the Supreme Court.

The age of criminal responsibility in the ACT is 10 years. Quamby can house both male and females from the age of 10. As a person who committed their offence whilst under 18 may be sentenced as a young person up to the age of 18 and 6 months, it is possible for Quamby to house a detainee over the age of 18 for the duration of their Court Order.

Quamby operates within the legislative requirements of the Children and Young People Act 1999, and is operated by the Office of Children, Youth and Family Services in the ACT Department of Disability, Housing and Community Services.

===New premises for youth detention===
In early 2006, the Government of the Australian Capital Territory announced plans for a $40 million youth detention centre at Mitchell, ACT. Thirty hectares of pastoral land on Wells Station Road, just off the Federal Highway, were earmarked for a new centre to replace the existing Quamby centre. The new juvenile detention centre opened in June 2008 as Bimberi Youth Justice Centre, and is capable of housing up to 50 residents.

In 2007 Symonston was criticised by the Human Rights Commission for allowing little time out of cells and for excessive lockdowns.

== Symonston Periodic Detention Centre ==
Between 2007 and 2017, the site was converted from a juvenille detention centre to an adult period detention centre, that was primarily used for weekend detention. In 2015 it was used as a temporary solution to the overcrowding in the ACT&#x27;s main adult prison, the Alexander Maconochie Centre.

<doc id="1208119" wikidata="Q7356923" url="?curid=1208119" title="Rodney Glisan">
<text>Rodney L. Glisan, M.D. (; January 29, 1827 – June 3, 1890) was an American medical doctor who served on the frontier in the United States Army and was well known as a medical authority in the 19th century.

==Biography==
He was born in Linganore in Frederick County, Maryland, the son of Samuel and Eliza Glisan. He graduated from the University of Maryland medical school in 1849. He practiced medicine for a year in Baltimore and then in 1850 he was appointed assistant surgeon in the United States Army. He served as medical officer in the army for eleven years including five years on the Great Plains followed by six years (1855–1861) in Oregon during the Indian wars.

He resigned his commission in 1861 and practiced medicine in San Francisco before moving to Portland, Oregon. In 1863 he married Elizabeth Raynes Couch, a daughter of John H. Couch, one of the founders of Portland. From 1872–1876 he was president of the Multnomah County Medical Society, and was president of Oregon state medical society from 1875–1876. He was a member for many years of the American Medical Association. He later became a professor of obstetrics and diseases of women at Willamette University School of Medicine.

Glisan achieved a measure of fame as a medical doctor in his day. He was widely published and known as an authority in his field. In 1874 he published &quot;Journal of Army Life&quot; about his years as a surgeon in the Army. He traveled extensively throughout Europe and Central America delivering lectures on medical subjects, and in 1887 published &quot;Two Years in Europe&quot;.

He is noted for performing the first amputation of the shoulder and thigh, and the second operation for strangulated inguinal hernia in the Pacific Northwest. In 1881 he published a text on midwifery that was widely used in the United States and Great Britain. That year he was also a delegate to the Seventh International Medical Congress. In 1893 the donation of his library became the basis for the library of the Oregon Health and Science University.

==Legacy==
Glisan is honored by the naming of a street in Northwest and Northeast Portland, Oregon.

<text>A Go game record is an archival record for a game of Go.

In most of East Asia, the record for a game of Go (or another abstract strategy game) is literally called &quot;board game record&quot; ( or a derivative). In Japanese it is called , in Standard Chinese (), and in Korean &quot;&quot; (hangul: , hanja: ).

Go records traditionally recorded games on a grid diagram representing the playing board, marking the plays on the stones by numbers. Stones placed before play begins are unnumbered.

==History==

The earliest surviving Go game records are collected in the book &quot;Wangyou Qingle Ji&quot; (), written by Li Yimin () around 1100 AD (Song dynasty).

A large corpus – many thousands of games – of kifu records from the Edo period have survived. A small proportion were published in book form; strong players used to make their own copies of games by hand to study. This accounts for one feature of the records passed down: they often omit much of the endgame, since for a strong player reconstructing the smaller endgame plays is routine. This explains the survival of some games in different versions and possible discrepancies in the final margin.

Early Western Go players found the method of kifu inconvenient, probably because as chess players they were more familiar with algebraic notation and because as new players they found it difficult to locate moves. But they quickly discovered the advantages of kifu-style notation—as much as an entire game can be visually displayed in one diagram—and now virtually all Go books and magazines use some modification of the kifu to display games, variations and problems. While a typical piece of chess literature is in algebraic notation punctuated by occasional diagrams, Go literature mostly consists of diagrams with a sequence of plays marked, and prose commentary.

The pioneering European player Oskar Korschelt disliked kifus because nineteenth century kifus always used Chinese numerals, which are indeed difficult to read unless one is familiar with them. Numbering in that style continued until 1945, having been popular in the 1930s on the basis of nationalist feeling in Japan. (Hindu–Arabic numerals were also used.) In Japanese Go books, when unoccupied points of the board are mentioned in the commentary, they are usually labelled by hiragana (in iroha order) to this day.

==Use==

The playing-through on a Go board of a game record given as a kifu on a single diagram is still a little taxing for a beginner player, because each move has to be searched for visually. An amateur &quot;dan&quot; player would expect to play through a game of normal length in around 20 minutes. A player of professional level would take ten minutes, and could easily sight-read a professional game from the kifu. Stronger players can locate plays more easily because they often know where the next move is likely to be found.

In most games, a small number of plays are at intersections that were previously occupied (this happens, for example, during a ko fight). Annotations by the side of the kifu give this information, usually in the form &#x27;57 at 51&#x27; or something comparable, indicating that move 57 occurred at the location formerly held by move 51. Game records are usually completed by information on the players&#x27; ranks, the date and competition data: location, winning player, and margin of victory.

Many of the most important games are now available in machine-readable form, using one of a small number of digital file formats. This has great advantages in terms of ease of playing through games and lends itself well to database storage and archival. The common opinion is that playing games through on a board (rather than computer monitor) from a printed record is a qualitatively different–and preferred–experience. Much importance is given to the sensual aspects of the game: the heft of the game board, the players&#x27; viewing angle of the board, the feel of the stones, the sound of the stones when placed.

==Other notations==
There is no other universally-recognised notation comparable to algebraic chess notation for Go. There are several methods in use, including:
* Using chess-like notation, so (on a 19x19 board) points are named – ( is excluded) for one axis, and 1-19 for the other.
* A similar system using Japanese numerals instead of letters.
* Using numbers for both axes, e.g. 3-4 is on the third row and fourth column from a corner.
* Pierre Audouard devised an elegant system using a letter a, b, c or d to designate the reference corner, plus one or two numbers to indicate the position relative to the corner. An equivalent system was used in ancient Chinese texts.

Since the Go board is symmetrical with no particular sides, it makes no difference which corner is used as the reference point from which to count coordinates.

==Computer file formats==

File formats are used to record the moves of a game or for demonstrations, game reviews and tsumego (Go problems). The most popular file format is Smart Game Format and most Go programs can use this format.

Kifus are not written in a file format for computers but are a written or printed diagrammatic record of a game.

<doc id="1208145" wikidata="Q2554618" url="?curid=1208145" title="Fuel Cell Bus Club">
<text>The Fuel Cell Bus Club comprised the participants of three demonstration projects (CUTE, ECTOS and STEP) for fuel cell buses in nine European cities and two other worldwide cities between 2001 and 2007. The Fuel Cell Bus Club became a forum to share experiences and information between cities and researchers. Other cities such as Beijing also tested buses from the consortium behind the project.

All three projects used Mercedes-Benz Citaro buses, with hydrogen fuel cells from Ballard Power Systems. When completed in 2007, all three projects were deemed a success by researchers. However, the buses were criticised by some operators for their high cost of operation compared to diesel buses, with Madrid reporting that they were around ten times as costly to fuel. Others noted the high purchase price of hydrogen buses, and the need to build dedicated hydrogen filling stations.

== Projects ==
=== CUTE ===
From 2001, the European Union supported research project Clean Urban Transport for Europe (CUTE) began running hydrogen fuel cell powered buses in nine European cities - Amsterdam, Barcelona, Hamburg, London, Luxembourg, Madrid, Porto, Stockholm, and Stuttgart. The project was supported by a consortium of transportation operators, hydrogen infrastructure and fuel cell developers, universities and city authorities.

At the end of the project in 2006, researchers deemed the project a success. A subsequent project (HYFLEET-CUTE) ran from 2006 until 2009, using the existing hydrogen fuel cell buses as well as new buses.

=== ECTOS ===
ECTOS stands for &quot;Ecological City Transport System&quot;. Icelandic New Energy was responsible for this project, the aim of which was to demonstrate &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; hydrogen technology by running part of the public transport system with fuel cell buses in the city Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. Hydrogen was produced from domestic geothermal and hydro-powered energy sources by electrolysis. The project ran from 2001 to 2005.

===STEP===
STEP sood for Sustainable Transport Energy for Perth. This initiative of the Government of Western Australia&#x27;s Department for Planning and Infrastructure, was the responsibility of Transperth, though it was run by contracted operator Path Transit. The three Mercedes-Benz hydrogen fuel cell buses that operated in Perth were called &quot;EcoBuses&quot;. The STEP project ran from 2001 to 2005, with the first buses in service in September 2004. The buses were withdrawn from service in 2007, with one bus subsequently preserved (albeit without the hydrogen fuel cells).

The Perth trial received A$2.5 million funding from the Department of the Environment and Heritage and the Australian Greenhouse Office. It was endorsed by the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.

BP produced the hydrogen as a by-product at its Kwinana Oil Refinery ( south of Perth). The hydrogen was then transported by road in specially designed road tankers to a bus depot in the northern suburbs of Perth. Perth&#x27;s buses achieved greater reliability and better fuel economy than in any other city in the trial.

By June 2005, the Perth buses had covered more than and completed almost 3,000 operational hours, with almost 60,000 passengers having used the service.

* In 2004, STEP received a Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport Outstanding Achievement award.
* In 2005, it was presented with a Banksia award in the &quot;Government Leading by Example for a Sustainable Future&quot; category.

=== China ===
In 2005, Beijing purchased three hydrogen fuel cell buses from the consortium using United Nations Development Programme grants. These buses entered service as the first fuel cell buses in China, in June 2006. Scientists and researchers hoped to demonstrate how emission free transport could be achieved in China. At the time, fossil fuels such as coal and oil made up 90 per cent of China&#x27;s total energy use. However, the buses were withdrawn after one year, as air pollution reduced the efficiency and operating life of the fuel cells.

== Vehicles and partners ==

All projects used Mercedes-Benz Citaro buses from DaimlerChrysler. They used hydrogen fuel cells were manufactured by XCELLSIS Fuel Cell Engines, now a division of Ballard Power Systems, and were developed as an alliance of Ballard, DaimlerChrysler, and Ford. In many cities, hydrogen fuel was provided by BP. At the time, they claimed to be the largest fleet of fuel cell buses in the world with 33 in regular service. The buses were estimated to cost US$1.2 million each and had a range of and carried around 70 passengers.

<doc id="1208148" wikidata="Q7899237" url="?curid=1208148" title="Upsala College">
<text>Upsala College (UC) was a private college affiliated with the Swedish-American Augustana Synod (later the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) and located in East Orange in Essex County, New Jersey in the United States, with an additional campus in Wantage Township in Sussex County. Upsala was founded in 1893 in Brooklyn, New York City, and moved to Kenilworth, and finally to East Orange in 1924. Despite a turnaround strategy that involved recruiting minority and international students, declining enrollment and financial difficulties forced the school to close in 1995.

==History==

Upsala College was founded at the 1893 annual meeting of the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America, known as the Augustana Synod—a Lutheran church body with roots in the Swedish immigrant community. The Augustana Synod placed emphasis on mission, ecumenism, and social service. Meeting at Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois, the polity decided to open the college in Brooklyn, New York, in October 1893. The Synod chose a young minister, the Rev. Lars Herman Beck (1859–1935), as the college&#x27;s first president. Beck, a Swedish immigrant to the United States, had received his Ph.D. from Yale University in the previous year and turned down a teaching position at Yale to assume the post at Upsala.

The name Upsala was chosen to honor both the historic Uppsala University in Sweden and the Meeting of Uppsala. That 1593 meeting—exactly 300 years before the founding of Upsala College—firmly established Lutheran Orthodoxy in Sweden after the attempts by King John III to reintroduce Roman Catholic liturgy.

On October 3, 1893, Upsala College opened in the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Bethlehem Church in Brooklyn. The first day, Beck began instruction with 16 students. By the end of the year, Upsala had 75 students. Early instruction had been in Swedish as the student body largely consisted of Scandinavian immigrants. In 1897, the college moved to Kenilworth, New Jersey (formerly &quot;New Orange, New Jersey&quot;) when the &quot;New Orange Industrial Association&quot; offered the young school fourteen acres of land. Upsala erected its first building on the Kenilworth campus in 1899. The college granted its first Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees in 1905 to four students. By 1910, Upsala offered Bachelor of Arts in modern and classical languages, and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in Mathematics and Sciences, while offering a three-year college preparatory program, instruction in music for preparing &quot;teachers of music, organist and choir leaders, and in general to afford its students a musical education&quot;, instruction in commerce and business to &quot;train young men and women for a business career&quot; and in stenography for students seeking &quot;to fill positions as stenographers and private secretaries.&quot; While the college was identified by its connection with the Swedish Lutheran community, Upsala was the first college in New Jersey to admit women, and its student body welcomed students from many other nationalities and religions. In 1908, the student body consisted of &quot;79 Swedes, 2 Finns, 1 Jew, 1 &#x27;American&#x27;, 1 Chinese, 1 Korean, and 1 Persian.&quot;

The college moved to East Orange in 1924 after purchasing a 45-acre site in the city in the previous year.

In 1978, Wallace R. Wirths, a former Westinghouse Corporation executive, author, local newspaper columnist and radio commentator, donated a 229 acre tract of land in rural Wantage Township in Sussex County to the college for the construction of a second campus. Upsala did not erect any buildings on the property; the only building was a former barn that Wirths converted to offices and a lecture hall. About 300 students were enrolled at the campus in 1992. When the college closed and its assets were sold, the Wirths family bought back the land from the college for $75,000.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Upsala suffered from severe financial problems and declining enrollment. The demographics of East Orange had changed in the aftermath of the 1967 Newark riots, becoming a city of largely minority residents; this resulted in it gaining a reputation as dangerous, leading to a decline in recruiting prospective students. The student body had decreased from approximately 1,400 students at its peak in 1969, to 475 by 1990.

In the 1980s, the college took out a roughly loan at a high interest rate in order to update and maintain its buildings. The college experienced difficulties in refinancing the loan, and it also prevented the college from making &quot;cooperative agreements&quot; with other campuses. A turnaround strategy implemented by then-college president Robert E. Karsten in the early 1990s resulted in the increase of the student body to 882 in 1992. This increase in students was due to the college changing its recruiting efforts to focus on minority and international students. By 1992, 35 percent of the student body was black or African American and 30 percent were international students. A major fundraising effort raised in the first six months of 1992, and a consortium of multiple lenders and Lutheran colleges provided the college with a loan. In June 1994, the college told employees that it would no longer be able to pay them by the end of the month. The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools then notified the college that its accreditation would be revoked on December 31, 1994. It instituted cuts in staffing and voted to stay open in July 1994, pending aid from the New Jersey state government. The financial difficulties the college experienced during 1994 caused its enrollment to fall by two thirds, with many students choosing to transfer to other colleges.

The college further cut faculty salaries by 40 percent, and on March 3, 1995, the college&#x27;s trustees voted to close the college on May 31, 1995. The college had hoped that an infusion of cash from South Korean industrialist In Tae Kim would help it avoid closure, but the college&#x27;s administration stated that South Korea&#x27;s ban on exporting funds to nonprofit organizations prevented it from obtaining the money. At the time of the vote, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools stated it would revoke the college&#x27;s accreditation on the same day of its closure. The last class of approximately 200 graduated on May 14, 1995. The number of students was 435 at the time of the college&#x27;s closure. The college closed with approximately US$12,500,000 in debt and filed for bankruptcy the next month. The school&#x27;s ninth and last president, Paul V. DeLomba, a partner and project manager with the financial services and accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, was hired by the board of trustees to close the college and dissolve its assets.

After its closure, the college&#x27;s campus was sold to the East Orange School District, which built a new high school, East Orange Campus High School, on its eastern half. Several of the college&#x27;s former buildings were incorporated into the new school. During this time, the western half of the campus deteriorated, became blighted and its buildings were looted and vandalized. The western half was slated for redevelopment by the city government in 1997 and demolished in summer 2005; a residential development of single-family homes, Woodlands at Upsala, was built on the site beginning in 2006 by developers The Alpert Group and the Applied Development Company.

Upsala&#x27;s campus radio station, WFMU, remains in operation; a nonprofit company known as Auricle Communications, formed by station staff in 1992, purchased WFMU&#x27;s license in 1994, one year before the college closed. WFMU continued to occupy space on the campus until 1998, when it purchased and moved to another building in Jersey City.

Roughly 60 percent of Upsala&#x27;s library was sold to the newly established Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, Florida. The university&#x27;s first classes were held in August 1997. A German investor and nearby Fairleigh Dickinson University bought the remainder of the collection.

Upsala student transcripts can be obtained from Felician University, which is also located in New Jersey. The college records were given to Augustana College.

<text>Daniel Thomas O&#x27;Bannon (September 30, 1946 – December 17, 2009) was an American film screenwriter, director and visual effects supervisor, most closely associated with the science fiction and horror genres.

O&#x27;Bannon wrote the screenplay for &quot;Alien&quot;, adapted from a story he wrote with Ronald Shusett. He also wrote and directed the cult horror comedy &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot;. He contributed computer animation to &quot;Star Wars&quot; and worked on cult classics such as &quot;Dark Star&quot;, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, and &quot;Total Recall&quot;.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Bannon was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Bertha (née Lowenthal) and Thomas Sidney O&#x27;Bannon, a carpenter. During his childhood he was a science fiction and horror enthusiast. He attended the art school of Washington University in St. Louis, where he did stand-up comedy routines, did make-up for campus theater productions, and provided illustrations for Student Life, the student newspaper. While there he roomed with future movie producer Michael Shamberg. O&#x27;Bannon moved home briefly after Washington University and attended Florissant Valley Junior College where he wrote and directed a short science fiction satire titled &quot;The Attack of the 50-foot Chicken.&quot; O&#x27;Bannon also attended MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois. During this period he pursued a psychology degree, but later became interested in becoming a film director. According to O&#x27;Bannon, he was reading an issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; when he found an article discussing the best film schools, which led him to the University of Southern California (USC). He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in film from USC in 1970. While at USC he lived near the Los Angeles Campus in an old two-story house affectionately called the &quot;Menlo Manor&quot; which he shared with other USC students (Don Jakoby, who collaborated on several screenplays with Dan including &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;; and Jeffrey J. Lee). As a student, O&#x27;Bannon spent many late nights in old Hollywood editing his and other student films.

== Career ==

===1970s===
It was at USC that he met John Carpenter and collaborated with him on a student film, which they eventually expanded into the feature-length science fiction movie &quot;Dark Star&quot;. Part of the movie was filmed at Menlo Manor. Released in 1974, it had a final budget of only US$60,000 (). O&#x27;Bannon served in a number of capacities, including scripting, acting in one of the leading roles (&quot;Sergeant Pinback&quot;) and editing, for which he used a 1940s Moviola. In 1975, &quot;Dark Star&quot; won the Golden Scroll award (the Saturn Awards&#x27; original name) for Best Special Effects.

He was retained to supervise special effects for an Alejandro Jodorowsky production of Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune.&quot; That project fell apart in 1976 and the movie was never made, reportedly because the major Hollywood studios were wary of financing the picture with Jodorowsky as director. O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s role is prominently featured in the 2013 documentary &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot;. During pre-production of the movie, he wrote and sketched out the comic book story The Long Tomorrow, illustrated by Moebius. The comic had a significant impact on the science fiction genre. The collapse of &quot;Dune&quot; left O&#x27;Bannon broke, homeless, and dependent on friends for his survival. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;George Lucas was impressed enough with his hand-animated, faux computer screen graphics to hire him to do similar work on Star Wars, but otherwise this was an incredibly lean period for him.&quot; He eventually abandoned technical film work for scriptwriting. While living with his friend Ronald Shusett, they came up with the story for O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s career-making film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), for which he wrote the screenplay and supervised visuals.

===1980s===
In 1981, O&#x27;Bannon helped create the animated feature &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, writing two of its segments (&quot;Soft Landing&quot; and &quot;B-17&quot;). O&#x27;Bannon voiced his displeasure with his next big-budget outing, John Badham&#x27;s &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; (1983), an action film about a Los Angeles helicopter surveillance team. Originally written with Don Jakoby, &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; also underwent extensive rewriting, losing some of its political content. He and Jakoby also scripted &quot;Lifeforce&quot; (1985), a movie based on Colin Wilson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Space Vampires&quot; and directed by Tobe Hooper that veers from alien visitation to vampirism and an apocalyptic ending. It was not well received at the time, and was considered a box office flop. O&#x27;Bannon would again collaborate with Jakoby and Hooper for the 1986 remake &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;. Purists considered it inferior to the 1950s original and it also performed poorly at the box office. O&#x27;Bannon also worked as a consultant for &quot;C.H.U.D.&quot;, helping to create the design concept for the title creatures.

In 1985, O&#x27;Bannon moved into the director&#x27;s chair with &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot;, a sequel to George Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead.&quot; Like &quot;Alien&quot;, the film met with success, spawned numerous sequels, and became a cult classic. That year, he was awarded the Inkpot Award.

===1990s===
In 1990, O&#x27;Bannon and Shusett again teamed up as writers on &quot;Total Recall&quot;, an adaptation of the short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot; by Philip K. Dick. This was a project the two had been working on since collaborating on &quot;Alien&quot;. With a cast featuring Sharon Stone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, &quot;Total Recall&quot; earned well over US$100 million.

An earlier screenplay by the duo titled &quot;Hemoglobin&quot; was also produced as the low budget feature &quot;Bleeders&quot; (1997).

O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s second directorial feature, &quot;The Resurrected&quot; (1991), was a low-budget horror effort released direct-to-video. Based on the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, it focused on a family&#x27;s ancient rituals that awaken the dead. In 1995, O&#x27;Bannon received a co-writing credit for the sci-fi film &quot;Screamers&quot; adapted from the Philip K. Dick story &quot;Second Variety&quot;, having written the initial version of the screenplay with Michael Campus in the early 1980s.

===2000s===

In 2001, O&#x27;Bannon was the filmmaker-in-residence at Chapman University&#x27;s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts.

O&#x27;Bannon and Shusett were credited as writers on the 2004 science fiction film &quot;Alien vs. Predator,&quot; a prequel to &quot;Alien&quot;.

===Posthumous===

In 2013, &quot;Dan O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s Guide to Screenplay Structure&quot; was released, co-written with Matt R. Lohr. Dark Horse Comics published the five-issue comic series &quot;Alien: The Original Screenplay&quot; from August to December 2020 based on O&#x27;Bannon original 1976 screenplay for the film.

==Personal life==
He and his wife Diane had a son, Adam.

==Death==
O&#x27;Bannon died from complications of Crohn&#x27;s disease in Los Angeles on December 17, 2009. He credited his experiences with Crohn&#x27;s for inspiring the chest-bursting scene from &quot;Alien&quot;.

==Filmography==
Also uncredited re-writer in &quot;Phobia&quot; (1980).

<text>Welsh nationalism () emphasises and celebrates the distinctiveness of Welsh culture and Wales as a nation or country. Welsh nationalism may also include calls for further autonomy or self-determination, which includes Welsh devolution, meaning increased powers for the Senedd, or full Welsh independence.

== History ==

=== English rule in Wales ===

Through most of its history before the Anglo-Norman Conquest, Wales was divided into several kingdoms. From time to time, rulers such as Hywel Dda, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn and Rhodri the Great managed to unify many of the kingdoms, but their lands were divided on their deaths.

Wales first appeared as a unified independent country from 1055 to 1063 under the leadership of the only King of Wales to have controlled all the territories of Wales, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Three years later the Normans invaded, and briefly controlled much of Wales, but by 1100 Anglo-Norman control of Wales was reduced to the lowland Gwent, Glamorgan, Gower, and Pembroke, regions which underwent considerable Anglo-Norman colonisation, while the contested border region between the Welsh princes and Anglo-Norman barons became known as the Welsh Marches.

Incursions from the English and Normans also amplified divisions between the kingdoms. In the 12th century, Norman king Henry II of England exploited differences between the three most powerful Welsh kingdoms, Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth, allowing him to make great gains in Wales. He defeated and then allied with Madog ap Maredudd of Powys in 1157, and used this alliance to overwhelm Owain Gwynedd. He then turned on Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth, who finally submitted to him in 1171, effectively subjugating much of Wales to Henry&#x27;s Angevin Empire. 

In the 13th century, the last prince of Wales, Llywelyn the Last retained his rights to Wales in an agreement with Henry III in the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. Henry&#x27;s successor, Edward I, disapproved of Llywelyn&#x27;s alliance with Simon de Montfort, who revolted along with other barons against the English king in the Second Barons&#x27; War of 1264–1267; and so in 1276 Edward&#x27;s army forced Llywelyn into an agreement that saw Llywelyn withdraw his powers to Gwynedd only. In 1282, whilst attempting to gather support in Cilmeri near Builth Wells, Llywelyn was killed. Llywelyn&#x27;s brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd, briefly led a force in Wales, but was captured and later hanged, drawn and quartered.

Since conquest, there have been Welsh rebellions against English rule. The last and most significant revolt was the Glyndŵr Rising of 1400–1415, which briefly restored independence. Owain Glyndŵr held the first Welsh parliament (Senedd) in Machynlleth in 1404, when he was proclaimed Prince of Wales, and a second parliament in 1405 in Harlech. After the eventual defeat of the Glyndŵr rebellion and a brief period of independence, it was not until 1999 that a Welsh legislative body was re-established as the National Assembly of Wales; it was renamed &quot;Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament&quot; in 2020.

In the 16th century, King Henry VIII of the Tudor dynasty (a royal house of Welsh origin) together with the English parliament, passed the Laws in Wales Acts, also referred to as the &quot;Acts of Union&quot;, which incorporated Wales fully into the Kingdom of England. These were not democratic times, and these laws were passed without any democratic mandate. Nevertheless, their effect was to abolish the Welsh legal system and integrate Wales into the English legal system. These Acts also gave political representation for Wales in the Westminster Parliament. The repressive measures against the Welsh that had been in place since the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr over a century earlier were removed. The Acts also stripped the Welsh language of its official status and role within Wales.

=== 19th century ===
The rapid industrialisation of parts of Wales, especially Merthyr Tydfil and adjoining areas, gave rise to strong and radical Welsh working class movements which led to the Merthyr Rising of 1831, the widespread support for Chartism, and the Newport Rising of 1839.

With the establishment of the Presbyterian Church of Wales, nonconformism triumphed in Wales, and gradually the previous majority of conservative voices within the church allied themselves with the more radical and liberal voices within the older dissenting churches of the Baptists and Congregationalists. This radicalism was exemplified by the Congregationalist minister David Rees of Llanelli, who edited the radical magazine &quot;Y Diwygiwr&quot; (&quot;The Reformer&quot;) from 1835 until 1865. But he was not a lone voice: William Rees (also known as Gwilym Hiraethog) established the radical &quot;Yr Amserau&quot; (&quot;The Times&quot;) in 1843, and in the same year Samuel Roberts also established another radical magazine, &quot;Y Cronicl&quot; (&quot;The Chronicle&quot;). Both were Congregationalist pastors.

==== Treason of the Blue Books ====
Welsh nationalists were outraged by the Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of education in Wales in 1847. The reports had blue covers, and were ridiculed as &quot;Brad y Llyfrau Gleision&quot;, or in English, &quot;The Treason of the Blue Books&quot;. They found the education system in Wales to be in a dreadful state; they condemned the Welsh language and Nonconformist religion. The commissioners&#x27; report is infamously known for its description of Welsh speakers as barbaric and immoral. Ralph Lingen was responsible for the Blue Books of 1846. By contrast the Reverend Henry Longueville Jones, Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspector of church schools in Wales between 1848 and 1865, led the opposition to subordination to the education department under Lingen. Jones&#x27;s reports supported bilingual education and praised the work of many church elementary schools. They came under attack in Whitehall. Jones failed to gain full support in Wales because of his Anglicanism and his criticisms of many certified teachers.

==== Cymru Fydd ====
David Lloyd George was one of the main leaders of Cymru Fydd, an organisation created with the aim of establishing a Welsh Government and a &quot;stronger Welsh identity&quot;. As such Lloyd George was seen as a radical figure in British politics and was associated with the reawakening of Welsh nationalism and identity. In 1880 he said:&quot;Is it not high time that Wales should the powers to manage its own affairs&quot;. Historian Emyr Price has referred to him as &quot;the first architect of Welsh devolution and its most famous advocate’&quot; as well as &quot;the pioneering advocate of a powerful parliament for the Welsh people&quot;. Lloyd George was also particularly active in attempting to set up a separate Welsh National Party based on Parnell&#x27;s Irish Parliamentary Party, and also worked to unite the North and South Wales Liberal Federations with Cymru Fydd to form a Welsh National Liberal Federation. The Cymru Fydd movement collapsed in 1896 amid personal rivalries and rifts between Liberal representatives such as David Alfred Thomas.

==== Industrial period ====
The growth of radicalism and the gradual politicisation of Welsh life did not include any successful attempt to establish a separate political vehicle for promoting Welsh nationalism. Although the Industrial Revolution in Wales did give rise to the patriotic movements, Anglicised influences still held a grip on Wales and had a negative effect on the language and Welsh nationalism. English was still legally the only official language of Wales, and was seen as the language of progress. More and more English migrants came to work in the Welsh mines, and other English influences spread into Wales due to the development of the railways. The Welsh language was left behind by many in favour of English, which was seen as an effective and more progressive language in the new industrialised world. Some, as can be seen from the 1911 census, decided against passing on the Welsh language and culture to future generations in favour of integrating with the English way of life, to improve their chances of success in life through careers and acceptance into the wider community. For the first time in 2000 years the Welsh language was now a minority language in Wales, with only 43.5% of the population speaking the language. Welsh nationalism weakened under the economic pressure as the coal industry of South Wales was increasingly integrated with English industry. On the whole, nationalism was the preserve of antiquarians, not political activists.

=== 20th century ===

The Labour Party dominated politics in Wales in the 1920s; it suffered a sharp setback in 1931, but maintained its hold on Wales. The leftists such as Aneurin Bevan who dominated the party in Wales rejected nationalism as a backward reactionary movement that was more favourable to capitalism and not to socialism. Instead they wanted a strong government in London to reshape the entire state economy.

In 1925 Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (&quot;National Party of Wales&quot;) was founded; it was renamed &quot;Plaid Cymru - The Party of Wales&quot; in 1945. The party&#x27;s principles since its founding are:
# self government for Wales, 
# to safeguard the culture, traditions, language and economic position of Wales,
# to secure membership for a self-governing Welsh state in the United Nations.

The party&#x27;s first Westminster seat (MP) was won by Gwynfor Evans in 1966. By 1974 the party had won three MP seats. In the 2019 general election it won four seats. Following the formation of the Senedd 1999, Plaid Cymru won 17 of 60 seats in the initial Welsh election of 1999 and 13 MS seats in 2021.

In the 1950s, the dismantling of the British Empire removed a sense of Britishness, and there was a realisation that Wales was not as prosperous as south-east England as well as some other smaller European countries. Successive Conservative Party victories in Westminster led to suggestions that only through self-government could Wales achieve a government reflecting the votes of a Welsh electorate. The Tryweryn flooding, which was voted against by almost every single Welsh MP, suggested that Wales as a nation was powerless. The Epynt clearance in 1940 has also been described as a &quot;significant – but often overlooked – chapter in the history of Wales&quot;.
On 1 July 1955, a conference of all parties was called at Llandrindod by the New Wales Union (Undeb Cymru Fydd) to consider a national petition for the campaign for a Parliament for Wales. The main leader was Megan Lloyd George, the daughter of David Lloyd George, T. I. Ellis, and Sir Ifan ab Owen Edwards. According to the historian William Richard Philip George, &quot;Megan was responsible for removing much prejudice against the idea of a parliament for Wales&quot;. She later presented the petition with 250,000 signatures to the British government in April 1956.

==== Official flag and capital city ====

The first official flag of Wales was created in 1953 for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. This &quot;augmented&quot; flag including the Royal badge of Wales was criticised in 1958 by the &quot;Gorsedd y Beirdd&quot;, a national Welsh group comprising Welsh literary figures and other notable Welsh people. In 1959, likely in response to criticism, the Welsh flag was changed to a red Welsh dragon on a green and white background. That remains the current flag of Wales today.

On 21 December 1955, the Lord Mayor of Cardiff announced to a crowd that Cardiff was now the official capital of Wales, following a parliamentary vote the previous day by Welsh local authority members. Cardiff won the vote with 136 votes compared to second-placed Caernarfon with 11. A campaign for Cardiff to become the capital city had been ongoing for 30 years. Historian James Cowan outlined some reasons why Cardiff was chosen. These included:
*Being the largest city in Wales with a population of 243,632, and 
* Buildings in Cathays Park, such as City Hall and the National Museum of Wales among other reasons.
Martin Johnes, a lecturer at Swansea University, claims that with the formation of the devolved assembly in 1999, Cardiff had become &quot;a capital in a meaningful way, as the home of the Welsh government, whereas before, its capital status was irrelevant, it was just symbolic&quot;.

=== 21st century ===

A 2007 survey by BBC Wales Newsnight found that 20% of Welsh people surveyed favoured Wales becoming independent of the United Kingdom.

There have been calls for a new UK flag or a redesign of the Union Jack which includes representation of Wales. Currently Wales is the only nation within the UK without representation in the UK&#x27;s flag.

In 2009 the Archbishop of Wales, Barry Morgan, renewed his call for the then Assembly to be granted full law-making powers, calling for a &quot;greater degree of self-determination&quot; for Wales.

A YouGov poll taken in September 2015 suggested that 17% of Welsh people would vote for independence. Another poll by Face for Business suggested support could be as high as 28%. These were in stark contrast to the previous two polls conducted by ICM Research for the BBC, which had said support was as low as 5% and 3% respectively.

The 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum saw the voters in Wales choosing the &quot;Leave&quot; option by 52.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent.

A Welsh Political Barometer poll, conducted for ITV-Cymru Wales and Cardiff University&#x27;s Wales Governance Centre from 30 June to 4 July 2016, showed support for Welsh independence had increased after the Brexit vote. Responding to the question &quot;And please imagine a scenario where the rest of the UK left the European Union but Wales could remain a member of the European Union if it became an independent country. If a referendum was then held in Wales about becoming an independent country and this was the question, how would you vote? Should Wales be an independent country?&quot;, the results were: Yes: 28%, No: 53%, Would Not Vote/Don&#x27;t Know: 20%. Removing non-committed voters, 35% of those polled would vote for independence.

In 2022, Dafydd Iwan&#x27;s 1983 protest song &quot;Yma o Hyd&quot; (&quot;Still here&quot;) became an anthem for the Welsh World Cup football team. This song is undoubtedly a nationalist song, with lyrics referencing events in Welsh history.

== Major active parties and movements ==
* YesCymru is a non party-political campaign for an independent Wales. The organisation was formed in the Summer of 2014 and officially launched on 20 February 2016 in Cardiff.
*Plaid Cymru - The Party of Wales founded in 1925. The party&#x27;s principles since its founding are (1) self government for Wales, (2) to safeguard the culture traditions, language and economic position of Wales and (3) to secure membership for a self-governing Welsh state in the United Nations. 
* &quot;Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg&quot; (Welsh Language Society). Established in 1962 by members of Plaid Cymru, it is a pressure group campaigning for Welsh language rights. It uses non-violent direct action in its campaigning, and sees itself as part of the global resistance movement.

==Militant nationalism==

Mainstream nationalism in Wales has been constitutional, and in Wales a pacifist instinct of Welsh nonconformist persisted before and after 1939. However, there have been some militant movements in Wales described as Welsh militant nationalism.

* In 1952 a small republican movement, &quot;Y Gweriniaethwyr&quot; (&quot;The Republicans&quot;), were the first to use violence when they made an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a pipeline leading from the Claerwen dam in mid Wales to Birmingham.
* In the 1960s two movements were established in protest against the drowning of the Tryweryn valley and the 1969 investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales: Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (&quot;Movement for the Defence of Wales&quot;, also known as MAC) and the Free Wales Army (also known as FWA, in Welsh &quot;Byddin Rhyddid Cymru&quot;). MAC were responsible for numerous bombing attacks on water pipelines and power lines across Wales. On the eve of the investiture two alleged members of MAC, Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, died when the bomb they were planting outside a Social Security Office in Abergele exploded.
* The late 1970s and the 1980s saw an organisation calling itself Meibion Glyndŵr (&quot;sons of Glyndŵr&quot;) responsible for a spate of arson attacks against holiday homes throughout Wales. In the 1970s, a Welsh Socialist Republican Army arose. Their slogan in English (&quot;Welsh Army for the Welsh Republic&quot;) could create an acronym WAWR, a grammatical form of the word &quot;gwawr&quot;, Welsh for &quot;dawn&quot;.

<text>The flier (Centrarchus macropterus) is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish, a sunfish from the family Centrarchidae which is endemic to the southern United States of America. It is the only species in the monospecific genus Centrarchus. A Second World War United States Navy submarine was named the USS &quot;Flier&quot; after this fish.

==Description==
The flier is a small, strongly compressed species of sunfish which has a moderately sized, oblique mouth. The dorsal fin has 11–13 spines and 12–14 soft rays while the anal fin has 7–8 spines and 13–15 soft rays. It has a lateral line and the scales are ctenoid. The flanks have a scattering of dark spots, the underside is pale, and the upperparts are olive in color. There is a vertical dark line through the eye which continues below the eye in what has been described as a &quot;teardrop&quot;. Fish of a standard length less than around have an obvious dark eyespot, or ocellus, which has a reddish margin on the soft part of the dorsal fin. The pectoral and pelvic fins are dusky with paler reticulations. The maximum total length recorded is but they are more commonly around and the maximum published weight is 1.35 pounds.

==Distribution==
The flier is found in the southern part of the United States along the Atlantic seaboard from the Potomac River drainage in Maryland, where it was most likely introduced to central Florida. It is then found along the Gulf of Mexico drainages as far west as the Trinity River, Texas, and then north in Mississippi River system to above the fall line in southern Illinois and southern Indiana.

==Habitat and biology==
The flier is found in clear, acidic waters including ponds in swamps, sloughs, oxbows, slow-flowing creeks and steams. These habitats should be heavily vegetated and have an average water temperature of . They feed largely on invertebrates including insects, snails, worms and leeches although they will also eat smaller fishes and some phytoplankton. Breeding normally occurs March to May when the water temperature reaches but it has been recorded as early as February. The gravid females have been collected from a variety of habitat including debris filled ditches with soft bottoms as well as gravel bottomed streams and heavily vegetated sand and gravel pits. They will spawn in a variety of water conditions ranging from free-flowing clear or turbid water through stagnant water in ditches and pools. Fliers create nests in rocks or gravel and surround their eggs with a round adhesive egg envelope. They are colonial nesters, nesting in aggregations with the nests quite closely spaced. Sexual maturity is attained at one year old and when they are long. The male parent guards the eggs and newly hatched fry. If they are frightened or alarmed, these fish will look for shelter among aquatic vegetation, submerged tree roots or mats of floating vegetation.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The flier was first formally described by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède (1756–1825) in 1801 as &quot;Labrus macropterus&quot; with the type locality given as South Carolina. In 1829 Georges Cuvier placed it in the genus &quot;Centrarchus&quot;. The genus &quot;Centrarchus&quot; is the sister taxon to the &quot;Archoplites&quot; and in turn these two are sister to &quot;Pomoxis&quot;. The generic name is a compound of the Greek &quot;kentron&quot; meaning &quot;sting&quot; and &quot;archos&quot; meaning &quot;anus&quot;, a reference to the long spines in the anal fin. The specific name &quot;macropterus&quot; is also Greek and means &quot;long fin&quot;.

==Cultural references==
A &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, USS &quot;Flier&quot;, built in 1943, was named for this species.

<text>Darbhanga is the fifth largest city and municipal corporation in the state of Bihar in India, and is considered an important city in North Bihar. It serves as the headquarters of the Darbhanga district and the Darbhanga division. Darbhanga is also referred to as the &quot;gateway to Bengal&quot;, because it is held that the name Darbhanga has been derived from &quot;Dwār Banga&quot; or &quot;Dari – Banga&quot;, meaning the &#x27;door of Bengal&#x27;.

Darbhanga was the seat of the erstwhile Khandwala zamidaar dynasty under the Mughals and British India. It is considered an important medical centre of North Bihar as it is the location of the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, and the second AIIMS of Bihar i.e AIIMS Darbhanga is to be constructed here. Similarly by the end of year 2029, it is expected that the city will be equipped with modern infrastructure of metro railway services called as Darbhanga Metro having 18.8 kilometres long metro line with 18 metro stations on it.

Darbhanga is one of the oldest cities in India. Musical, folk art, and literary traditions in Maithili, Sanskrit, Urdu, and Hindi have passed down generations in Darbhanga and constitute the city&#x27;s strong cultural background. It is popularly known as the &quot;Cultural Capital of Bihar&quot; and the &quot;Heart of Mithila&quot;.

==History==

The city was the capital of the Darbhanga Raj, an estate established in the 16th century, containing the Anandbagh Palace. It was constituted as a municipality in 1864. Darbhanga is home to the Kameshwara Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University (established 1961), which is located on the grounds of the palace, and the Lalit Narayan Mithila University (established 1972). Darbhanga has a museum housing archaeological materials, as well as historical and handicrafts exhibits.

Darbhanga has been a centre for music since the late 18th century and has produced multiple well-known &quot;dhrupad&quot; (an ancient form of Indian classical music) musicians. A major rail and road junction, Darbhanga trades in agricultural produce, mangoes, and fish. In addition to food processing, the city has a light manufacturing industry.

Darbhanga is situated on a vast alluvial plain, with low-lying areas containing marshes and lakes. Grains, oilseeds, tobacco, sugarcane, and mangoes are important crops in the region.

Under the British Raj, Darbhanga was a part of Sarkar Tirhut until 1875, when it was constituted into a separate district. Its subdivisions had been constituted earlier – Darbhanga Sadar in 1845, Madhubani in 1866, and Samastipur (then known as Tajpur) in 1867.
The city of Darbhanga is said to have been founded by one Darbhangi Khan, about whom practically nothing is known. It is also held that the name Darbhanga is derived from &quot;Dwar Banga&quot; or &quot;Dar-e-Banga&quot;, meaning the &#x27;door of Bengal&#x27;. This etymology does not appear to be accurate as the division between Bengal and Bihar has always been held to be further to the east.

Excavation at Balirajgarh revealed brick fortifications dating back to the 2nd century BC.

<text>Belaid Abdessalam (; 20 July 1928 – 27 June 2020) was an Algerian politician, who served as Prime Minister from 1992 to 1993.

==Biography==
Abdessalam was born in Dehamcha, Sétif Province, Algeria on 20 July 1928. Abdessalam was a nationalist leader in the FLN during Algeria&#x27;s struggle for independence from France. He was minister of industry and power under the military regime of Houari Boumedienne, and his name was closely connected with the former Algerian state policy of building a base of heavy industry through planned economy. Abdessalam served as Head of Government of Algeria from 8 July 1992 until 21 August 1993. He also hold the portfolio of Minister of Finance.
During his tenure, the Algerian Civil War with Islamist rebels intensified.

On 27 June 2020, he died at Ain Naadja military hospital in Algiers, aged 91.

<doc id="1208210" wikidata="Q511755" url="?curid=1208210" title="Ladder paradox">
<text>The ladder paradox (or barn-pole paradox) is a thought experiment in special relativity. It involves a ladder, parallel to the ground, travelling horizontally at relativistic speed (near the speed of light) and therefore undergoing a Lorentz length contraction. The ladder is imagined passing through the open front and rear doors of a garage or barn which is shorter than its rest length, so if the ladder was not moving it would not be able to fit inside. To a stationary observer, due to the contraction, the moving ladder is able to fit entirely inside the building as it passes through. On the other hand, from the point of view of an observer moving with the ladder, the ladder will not be contracted, and it is the building which will be Lorentz contracted to an even smaller length. Therefore, the ladder will not be able to fit inside the building as it passes through. This poses an apparent discrepancy between the realities of both observers.

This apparent paradox results from the mistaken assumption of absolute simultaneity. The ladder is said to fit into the garage if both of its ends can be made to be simultaneously inside the garage. The paradox is resolved when it is considered that in relativity, simultaneity is relative to each observer, making the answer to whether the ladder fits inside the garage also relative to each of them.

==Paradox==
The simplest version of the problem involves a garage, with a front and back door which are open, and a ladder which, when at rest with respect to the garage, is too long to fit inside. We now move the ladder at a high horizontal velocity through the stationary garage. Because of its high velocity, the ladder undergoes the relativistic effect of length contraction, and becomes significantly shorter. As a result, as the ladder passes through the garage, it is, for a time, completely contained inside it. We could, if we liked, simultaneously close both doors for a brief time, to demonstrate that the ladder fits.

So far, this is consistent. The apparent paradox comes when we consider the symmetry of the situation. As an observer moving with the ladder is travelling at constant velocity in the inertial reference frame of the garage, this observer also occupies an inertial frame, where, by the principle of relativity, the same laws of physics apply. From this perspective, it is the ladder which is now stationary, and the garage which is moving with high velocity. It is therefore the garage which is length contracted, and we now conclude that it is far too small to have ever fully contained the ladder as it passed through: the ladder does not fit, and we cannot close both doors on either side of the ladder without hitting it. This apparent contradiction is the paradox.

==Resolution==
The solution to the apparent paradox lies in the relativity of simultaneity: what one observer (e.g. with the garage) considers to be two simultaneous events may not in fact be simultaneous to another observer (e.g. with the ladder). When we say the ladder &quot;fits&quot; inside the garage, what we mean precisely is that, at some specific time, the position of the back of the ladder and the position of the front of the ladder were both inside the garage; in other words, the front and back of the ladder were inside the garage simultaneously. As simultaneity is relative, then, two observers disagree on whether the ladder fits. To the observer with the garage, the back end of the ladder was in the garage at the same time that the front end of the ladder was, and so the ladder fit; but to the observer with the ladder, these two events were not simultaneous, and the ladder did not fit.

A clear way of seeing this is to consider the doors, which, in the frame of the garage, close for the brief period that the ladder is fully inside. We now look at these events in the frame of the ladder. The first event is the front of the ladder approaching the exit door of the garage. The door closes, and then opens again to let the front of the ladder pass through. At a later time, the back of the ladder passes through the entrance door, which closes and then opens. We see that, as simultaneity is relative, the two doors did not need to be shut at the same time, and the ladder did not need to fit inside the garage.

The situation can be further illustrated by the Minkowski diagram below. The diagram is in the rest frame of the garage. The vertical light-blue band shows the garage in spacetime, and the light-red band shows the ladder in spacetime. The x and t axes are the garage space and time axes, respectively, and x and t are the ladder space and time axes, respectively.

In the frame of the garage, the ladder at any specific time is represented by a horizontal set of points, parallel to the x axis, in the red band. One example is the bold blue line segment, which lies inside the blue band representing the garage, and which represents the ladder at a time when it is fully inside the garage. In the frame of the ladder, however, sets of simultaneous events lie on lines parallel to the x&#x27; axis; the ladder at any specific time is therefore represented by a cross section of such a line with the red band. One such example is the bold red line segment. We see that such line segments never lie fully inside the blue band; that is, the ladder never lies fully inside the garage.

==Shutting the ladder in the garage==
In a more complicated version of the paradox, we can physically trap the ladder once it is fully inside the garage. This could be done, for instance, by not opening the exit door again after we close it. In the frame of the garage, we assume the exit door is immovable, and so when the ladder hits it, we say that it instantaneously stops. By this time, the entrance door has also closed, and so the ladder is stuck inside the garage. As its relative velocity is now zero, it is not length contracted, and is now longer than the garage; it will have to bend, snap, or explode.

Again, the puzzle comes from considering the situation from the frame of the ladder. In the above analysis, in its own frame, the ladder was always longer than the garage. So how did we ever close the doors and trap it inside?

It is worth noting here a general feature of relativity: we have deduced, by considering the frame of the garage, that we do indeed trap the ladder inside the garage. This must therefore be true in any frame - it cannot be the case that the ladder snaps in one frame but not in another. From the ladder&#x27;s frame, then, we know that there must be some explanation for how the ladder came to be trapped; we must simply find the explanation.

The explanation is that, although all parts of the ladder simultaneously decelerate to zero in the garage&#x27;s frame, because simultaneity is relative, the corresponding decelerations in the frame of the ladder are not simultaneous. Instead, each part of the ladder decelerates sequentially, from front to back, until finally the back of the ladder decelerates, by which time it is already within the garage.

As length contraction and time dilation are both controlled by the Lorentz transformations, the ladder paradox can be seen as a physical correlate of the twin paradox, in which instance one of a set of twins leaves earth, travels at speed for a period, and returns to earth a bit younger than the earthbound twin. As in the case of the ladder trapped inside the barn, if neither frame of reference is privileged — each is moving only relative to the other — how can it be that it&#x27;s the traveling twin and not the stationary one who is younger (just as it&#x27;s the ladder rather than the barn which is shorter)? In both instances it is the acceleration-deceleration that differentiates the phenomena: it&#x27;s the twin, not the earth (or the ladder, not the barn) that undergoes the force of deceleration in returning to the temporal (or physical, in the case of the ladder-barn) inertial frame.

==Ladder paradox and transmission of force==
What if the back door (the door the ladder exits out of) is closed permanently and does not open? Suppose that the door is so solid that the ladder will not penetrate it when it collides, so it must stop. Then, as in the scenario described above, in the frame of reference of the garage, there is a moment when the ladder is completely within the garage (i.e., the back of the ladder is inside the front door), before it collides with the back door and stops. However, from the frame of reference of the ladder, the ladder is too big to fit in the garage, so by the time it collides with the back door and stops, the back of the ladder still has not reached the front door. This seems to be a paradox. The question is, does the back of the ladder cross the front door or not?

The difficulty arises mostly from the assumption that the ladder is rigid (i.e., maintains the same shape). Ladders seem rigid in everyday life. But being completely rigid requires that it can transfer force at infinite speed (i.e., when you push one end the other end must react immediately, otherwise the ladder will deform). This contradicts special relativity, which states that information can travel no faster than the speed of light (which is too fast for us to notice in real life, but is significant in the ladder scenario). So objects cannot be perfectly rigid under special relativity.

In this case, by the time the front of the ladder collides with the back door, the back of the ladder does not know it yet, so it keeps moving forwards (and the ladder &quot;compresses&quot;). In both the frame of the garage and the inertial frame of the ladder, the back end keeps moving at the time of the collision, until at least the point where the back of the ladder comes into the light cone of the collision (i.e., a point where force moving backwards at the speed of light from the point of the collision will reach it). At this point the ladder is actually shorter than the original contracted length, so the back end is well inside the garage. Calculations in both frames of reference will show this to be the case.

What happens after the force reaches the back of the ladder (the &quot;green&quot; zone in the diagram) is not specified. Depending on the physics, the ladder could break; or, if it were sufficiently elastic, it could bend and re-expand to its original length. At sufficiently high speeds, any realistic material would violently explode into a plasma.

==Man falling into grate variation==
This early version of the paradox was originally proposed and solved by Wolfgang Rindler and involved a fast walking man, represented by a rod, falling into a grate. It is assumed that the rod is entirely over the grate in the grate frame of reference before the downward acceleration begins simultaneously and equally applied to each point in the rod.

From the perspective of the grate, the rod undergoes a length contraction and fits into the grate. However, from the perspective of the rod, it is the &quot;grate&quot; undergoing a length contraction, through which it seems the rod is then too long to fall.

The downward acceleration of the rod, which is simultaneous in the grate&#x27;s frame of reference, is not simultaneous in the rod&#x27;s frame of reference. In the rod&#x27;s frame of reference, the front of the rod is first accelerated downward (shown in cell 3 of the drawing), and as time goes by, more and more of the rod is subjected to the downward acceleration, until finally the back of the rod is accelerated downward. This results in a bending of the rod in the rod&#x27;s frame of reference. Since this bending occurs in the rod&#x27;s rest frame, it is a true physical distortion of the rod which will cause stresses to occur in the rod.

For this non-rigid behaviour of the rod to become apparent, both the rod itself and the grate must be of such a scale that the traversal time is measurable.

==Bar and ring paradox==

A problem very similar but simpler than the rod and grate paradox, involving only inertial frames, is the &quot;bar and ring&quot; paradox. The rod and grate paradox is complicated: it involves non-inertial frames of reference since at one moment the man is walking horizontally, and a moment later he is falling downward; and it involves a physical deformation of the man (or segmented rod), since the rod is bent in one frame of reference and straight in another. These aspects of the problem introduce complications involving the stiffness of the rod which tends to obscure the real nature of the &quot;paradox&quot;. The &quot;bar and ring&quot; paradox is free of these complications: a bar, which is slightly larger in length than the diameter of a ring, is moving upward and to the right with its long axis horizontal, while the ring is stationary and the plane of the ring is also horizontal. If the motion of the bar is such that the center of the bar coincides with the center of the ring at some point in time, then the bar will be Lorentz-contracted due to the forward component of its motion, and it will pass through the ring. The paradox occurs when the problem is considered in the rest frame of the bar. The ring is now moving downward and to the left, and will be Lorentz-contracted along its horizontal length, while the bar will not be contracted at all. How can the bar pass through the ring?

The resolution of the paradox again lies in the relativity of simultaneity. The length of a physical object is defined as the distance between two &quot;simultaneous&quot; events occurring at each end of the body, and since simultaneity is relative, so is this length. This variability in length is just the Lorentz contraction. Similarly, a physical angle is defined as the angle formed by three &quot;simultaneous&quot; events, and this angle will also be a relative quantity. In the above paradox, although the rod and the plane of the ring are parallel in the rest frame of the ring, they are not parallel in the rest frame of the rod. The uncontracted rod passes through the Lorentz-contracted ring because the plane of the ring is rotated relative to the rod by an amount sufficient to let the rod pass through.

In mathematical terms, a Lorentz transformation can be separated into the product of a spatial rotation and a &quot;proper&quot; Lorentz transformation which involves no spatial rotation. The mathematical resolution of the bar and ring paradox is based on the fact that the product of two proper Lorentz transformations (horizontal and vertical) may produce a Lorentz transformation which is not proper (diagonal) but rather includes a spatial rotation component.

<text>Tribune Broadcasting Company, LLC was an American media company which operated as a subsidiary of Tribune Media, a media conglomerate based in Chicago, Illinois. The group owned and operated television and radio stations throughout the United States, as well as full- or partial-ownership of cable television and national digital subchannel networks.

== History ==

Tribune&#x27;s broadcasting unit originated with the June 1924 purchase of Chicago, Illinois, radio station WDAP by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. The new owners changed the station&#x27;s call letters to WGN, to match the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s slogan, &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Newspaper&quot; first used by &quot;Tribune&quot; in a February 1909 feature commemorating the 100th anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln and then served as the newspaper&#x27;s motto from August 29, 1911, until December 31, 1976.

On September 13, 1946, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted Tribune license to operate a television station on channel 9 in Chicago and then signed-on a television station in Chicago, WGN-TV on April 5, 1948, initially as a dual affiliate of CBS and the DuMont Television Network. Two months later, the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s then-sibling newspaper in New York City, the &quot;Daily News&quot;, established its own television station, independent WPIX. WGN-TV became an independent outlet by 1956, and would eventually morph into a pioneering national superstation on November 9, 1978, as its signal was linked to cable and satellite customers across America.

After McCormick succumbed from pneumonia-related complications on April 1, 1955, ownership of WGN-TV-AM, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the News Syndicate Company properties would transfer to the McCormick-Patterson Trust, assigned to the Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation in the names of the non-familial heirs of McCormick (whose two marriages never produced any children) and familial heirs of Patterson. The trust was dissolved in January 1975, with a majority of the trust&#x27;s former beneficiaries, including descendants of the McCormick and Patterson families, owning stock in the restructured Tribune Company entity – which assumed oversight of all properties previously overseen by the trust – afterward.

In subsequent years, the Tribune Company gradually expanded its broadcasting unit, of which WGN-TV-AM served as its flagship stations, a tie forged in January 1966, when the subsidiary (sans the WPIX television and radio stations, which continued to be controlled by the Tribune-managed News Syndicate Co. before being fully integrated into the company&#x27;s main station group following its 1991 sale of the &quot;Daily News&quot;) was renamed the WGN Continental Broadcasting Company.

The group became known as the Tribune Broadcasting Company in January 1981, but retained the WGN Continental moniker as its de facto business name until 1984 and as the licensee for WGN-TV and WGN Radio thereafter. The company gained its third television and second radio station in 1960, when it purchased KDAL-TV (now KDLH) and KDAL (AM) in Duluth, Minnesota, from the estate of the late Dalton LeMasurier (Tribune sold KDAL-TV in 1978 and KDAL radio in 1981); the company would later purchase KCTO (subsequently re-called KWGN-TV) in Denver from J. Elroy McCaw in 1966.

Tribune&#x27;s later television purchases included those of WANX-TV (later renamed WGNX) in Atlanta and WGNO in New Orleans (both in 1983); KTLA in Los Angeles (in 1985), WPHL-TV in Philadelphia (in 1992). WLVI-TV in Boston (owned from 1994 to 2006); KHTV (now KIAH) in Houston (in 1995); KTTY (now KSWB-TV) in San Diego (in 1996); WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan, KCPQ and KTWB-TV (now KZJO) in Seattle (in 1998 and 1999, respectively); and WBDC-TV (now WDCW) in Washington, D.C. (in 1999). WGN-TV and WPIX were the only stations that Tribune had owned since their inceptions. Tribune also operated several local cable television systems from 1977 to 1985.

In 1993, Tribune launched Chicagoland Television (CLTV), a regional cable news channel for the Chicago area, which originally operated separately from the company&#x27;s other Chicago media properties until it merged its operations with WGN-TV&#x27;s news department in 2009. In November 1994, Tribune Broadcasting formed a partnership with several minority partners, including Quincy Jones, to form Qwest Broadcasting; Qwest operated as a technically separate company from Tribune (which owned stations in a few markets where Tribune-owned stations, including WATL in Atlanta, which was operated alongside Tribune-owned WGNX and WNOL-TV in New Orleans, which was also operated alongside WGNO); Tribune would later acquire the Qwest stations outright in November 1999.

In January 1995, Tribune Broadcasting became a partner in The WB Television Network, in a joint venture with the Warner Bros. Television division of Time Warner. Tribune initially had a 12.5% ownership interest in the network at its launch and later increased its stake to 22%. In addition, partly as a result of a November 1993 affiliation deal with the network, most of Tribune&#x27;s television properties were WB affiliates. On July 2, 1996, Tribune acquired Renaissance Broadcasting, which owned Fox- and WB-affiliated stations in several large and mid-sized markets for $1.13 billion.

On April 19, 2002, Tribune announced that it would acquire WTTV (then a WB affiliate, later became a CBS affiliate in 2015) and its satellite station WTTK in Indianapolis from the Sinclair Broadcast Group for $125 million, creating a duopoly with WXIN.

On December 30, 2002, Tribune announced that it would acquire WB affiliates KPLR-TV in St. Louis, Missouri and KWBP (now known as KRCW-TV) in Portland, Oregon from ACME Communications for $275 million, the acquisition was completed on March 21, 2003.

On January 24, 2006, Time Warner announced that it would partner with CBS Corporation to form a new network that would feature The WB and CBS-owned UPN&#x27;s higher-rated shows mixed with newer series, called The CW Television Network. All but three of Tribune&#x27;s 19 WB affiliates became affiliates of The CW on September 18, 2006, through ten-year agreements (the exceptions were in Philadelphia, Seattle and Atlanta, due to The CW affiliating with CBS-owned stations in those markets), though Tribune itself would not exercise an ownership stake in The CW as it did with The WB.

In April 2007, Tribune&#x27;s broadcasting interests were included in the sale of the entire company to Chicago investor Sam Zell, who planned take the publicly traded company private. The deal was completed on December 20, 2007.

On December 21, 2007, Tribune and Oak Hill Capital Partners-controlled Local TV, LLC announced plans to collaborate in the formation of a &quot;broadcast management company&quot; (later named The Other Company); its Tribune Interactive division also operated the websites of its stations as part of the partnership.

On December 8, 2008, Tribune announced that it would voluntarily restructure its debt obligations, as part of its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court. As the company had sufficient funds to do so, Tribune continued to operate its newspaper publishing and broadcasting, and interactive businesses without interruption during the restructuring.

On January 1, 2011, Tribune launched the digital broadcast network Antenna TV, a service that features a variety of classic television series, including programming from Sony Pictures Television and D.L. Taffner Entertainment. On May 13, 2013, Tribune announced that it would buy a 50% stake in the This TV digital broadcast network from fellow Chicago-based media company Weigel Broadcasting; Tribune took over operational duties for the network on November 1, 2013.

===Split and subsequent transactions===
On July 1, 2013, Tribune announced that it would purchase the 19 stations owned by Local TV, LLC outright for $2.725 billion; the purchase expanded the number of Big Three network affiliates in its portfolio from one to 10 (most of Tribune&#x27;s television stations prior to the purchase had either been independent stations or from 1995 onward, affiliates of networks that have launched since 1986; New Orleans station WGNO (channel 26) – an ABC affiliate – was Tribune&#x27;s only station affiliated with one of the three pre-1986 networks prior to the purchase), as well as form duopolies involving stations in Denver and St. Louis where the two companies maintained local marketing agreements.

In order to prevent conflicts with newspaper cross-ownership restrictions (specifically, with &quot;Daily Press&quot; and &quot;The Morning Call&quot;), three stations involved in the acquisition – the Norfolk, Virginia, duopoly of WTKR (channel 3) and WGNT (channel 27), and Scranton, Pennsylvania, station WNEP-TV (channel 16) – were sold to Dreamcatcher Broadcasting and are operated by Tribune under shared services agreements (Tribune has an option to purchase WNEP after the publishing/broadcasting split, although such a transfer may be complicated by possible FCC action on a proposal to end a &quot;discount&quot; in television station ownership limits that count UHF stations to half a percentage to a group&#x27;s overall market reach, which would put Tribune just over the current limit of 39%, under which the company&#x27;s current station holdings after the Local TV purchase would be grandfathered). The Federal Communications Commission approved the acquisition on December 20, and the sale was completed one week later on December 27.

=== Aborted merger with Sinclair; acquisition by Nexstar ===
On February 29, 2016, Tribune Media announced that it would review various &quot;strategic alternatives&quot; to increase the company&#x27;s value to shareholders, which include a possible sale of the entire company and/or select assets, or the formation of programming alliances or strategic partnerships with other companies, due to the decrease in its stock price since the Tribune Publishing spin-off and a $385 million revenue write-down for the 2015 fiscal year, partly due to original scripted programming expenditures for WGN America since it converted the cable network from a superstation in 2014.

With the FCC reinstating the &quot;UHF discount&quot; rule, reports surfaced in late April 2017 that multiple parties were attempting to make offers for Tribune, including Sinclair Broadcast Group, Nexstar Media Group, and a partnership between 21st Century Fox and Blackstone Group. On May 7, 2017, it was reported that Sinclair Broadcast Group was nearing a deal to purchase Tribune Media, and that 21st Century Fox had dropped its bid for the company. On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group officially announced its intent to acquire Tribune Media. The transaction would have been a cash-and-stock deal valuing the company at $3.9 billion. Depending on regulatory changes or decisions, some divestitures might have been required. However, on August 9, 2018, Tribune canceled the Sinclair deal.

On November 14, 2018, it was reported that Nexstar was a leading bidder to acquire Tribune. On December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced its intent to merge with Tribune Media for $6.4 billion ($4.1 billion for all of Tribune&#x27;s shares in cash and $2.3 billion of Tribune&#x27;s debt). The merge would give the company 216 stations in 118 markets, placing it just below the FCC&#x27;s market cap of 39% of TV households and making it the largest owner of television stations in the United States. On August 1, 2019, the United States Department of Justice approved the deal between Nexstar Media Group and Tribune Media. The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16, and occurred on September 19.

== Television production and distribution ==
=== Tribune Entertainment ===

Tribune Entertainment was Tribune&#x27;s television production, syndication and advertising sales subsidiary. Founded in 1981, this subsidiary produced and/or distributed several first-run syndicated programs including most notably &quot;Geraldo&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot;, and the &quot;U.S. Farm Report&quot;; Tribune Entertainment&#x27;s production and syndication divisions were shut down in December 2007.

=== Tribune Studios ===

On March 19, 2013, Tribune Company announced its return to television production with the formation of Tribune Studios (not to be confused with the Los Angeles studio facility that formerly held the same name until its sale by Tribune to private equity firm Hudson Capital in 2008, and was subsequently renamed Sunset Bronson Studios). The new company will produce programs primarily for Tribune Broadcasting&#x27;s television stations and WGN America, some of which will receive national distribution. On September 17, 2019, Tribune Studios, the television parent of Tribune Broadcasting, was acquired by Nexstar, and the television company went disbanded shortly.

<text>Tamrat Layne Admassu (; born 1955) is an Ethiopian former politician who served as the Prime Minister of Ethiopia during the Transitional Government of Ethiopia after the end of the Derg regime. Previously during the 1980s, he was a leader of the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (the forerunner of the Amhara National Democratic Movement), one of the groups that fought against Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in the Ethiopian Civil War.

==Biography==
Tamrat Layne was born in 1955 and raised by a single mother in Addis Ababa. He led the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Democratic Movement during the 1980s, fighting against Mengistu Haile Mariam in the Ethiopian Civil War. In an interview in 1988, he acknowledged that the goals of his movement were similar to that of the Tigrayan People&#x27;s Liberation Front, such as its approach to national self-determination and foreign affairs. A self-proclaimed atheist, he believed that &quot;freedom comes out of the barrel of the gun.&quot;

When Mengistu was overthrown in 1991, Tamrat Layne became one of the three-man EPRDF-TPLF ruling the country and then in the democratically elected government, the other members being Meles Zenawi (President) and Siye Abraha (Minister of Defence). His position was Prime Minister of the Transitional Government, in which capacity he served from 6 June 1991 until 22 August 1995, when President Meles Zenawi succeeded him as Prime Minister. While in power, he realized that his communist-socialist ideology was mistaken. He staffed important government posts with friends. Tamrat became deputy prime minister until October 1996. He also served as deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.

On 16 March 2000 the Federal Supreme Court of Ethiopia sentenced Tamrat to 18 years in prison after being convicted of corruption and embezzlement charges. He was accused of being involved in an illegal 16 million-dollar deal with a business to export Ethiopian textiles and 1,000 tons of state-owned coffee through a fake company. He claimed to be innocent of all charges against him. Kept in solitary confinement, he studied Buddhism, Islam, and eventually Christianity after a nurse slipped him Christian literature. He reported that while in prison, over the course of three consecutive nights he encountered a figure that he identified as Jesus Christ.
After serving 12 years of his 18-year sentence, Tamrat was released from prison in December 2008.
He is currently an active member of Christian churches across the United States with his teachings of self understanding and life&#x27;s purpose Since then, he has shared his faith experience with others. He has made appearances at several churches and universities.

<doc id="1208236" wikidata="Q7234371" url="?curid=1208236" title="Postmodern American Poetry">
<text>Postmodern American Poetry is a poetry anthology edited by Paul Hoover and published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company in 1994. A substantially revised second edition in 2012 removed some poets and added many others, incorporating additional American poetry movements which came to prominence in the 21st century.

The introduction identifies the use of postmodern with its early mention by Charles Olson, and identifies the field chosen as experimental poetry from after 1945. The book contains, besides poems, about 20 short essays on poetics.

The first edition joined two other collections which appeared at that time: &quot;From the Other Side of the Century: &quot;A New American Poetry, 1960-1990&quot;&quot; (1994; edited by Douglas Messerli) and &quot;American Poetry Since 1950&quot; (1993; edited by Eliot Weinberger).

The anthology, the goal of which is to &quot;fully represent the movements of American avant-garde poetry&quot;, includes representatives from the Beat and New York School poets, the Projectivists, &quot;deep image&quot; poets, language and performance poetry, and various experimentalists. The second edition adds works associated with Newlipo, conceptual poetry, and cyberpoetry/Flarf.

The 1994 edition consists of 411 poems by 103 poets and essays by 18 authors, including some of the poets who also have poetry in the book.

<text>Isaac ben Jacob Alfasi (1013–1103) (, ), also known as the Alfasi or by his Hebrew acronym, the Rif (Rabbi Isaac al-Fasi), was a Maghrebi Talmudist and posek (decider in matters of halakha, Jewish law). He is best known for his work of &quot;halakha&quot;, the legal code Sefer Ha-halachot, considered the first fundamental work in &quot;halakhic&quot; literature.

==Biography==
He was born in Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad in modern-day Algeria, capital city of the Sanhaja Hammadid dynasty of the central Maghreb, and is therefore sometimes called &quot;ha-Kala&#x27;i.&quot; Some older sources believe Qalaat Hammad refers to a village near Fez. He studied in Kairouan, Tunisia under Nissim ben Jacob, and Chananel ben Chushiel the recognized rabbinical authorities of the age. Chananel trained Alfasi to deduce and to clarify the Halakha from Talmudic sources, and Alfasi then conceived of the idea of compiling a comprehensive work that would present all of the practical conclusions of the Gemara in a clear, definitive manner. To achieve this goal, he worked for ten consecutive years in his father-in-law&#x27;s attic.

In 1045, Alfasi moved to Fez with his wife and two children, hence the name &quot;al fasi&quot;. Fez&#x27;s Jewish community undertook to support him and his family so that he could work on his &quot;Sefer Ha-halachot&quot; undisturbed. They also founded a yeshiva in his honor, and many students throughout Morocco came to study under his guidance. The most famous of his many students is Judah Halevi, author of the &quot;Kuzari&quot;; he also taught Joseph ibn Migash (the &quot;Ri Migash&quot;), who was in turn a teacher of Rabbi Maimon, father and teacher of Maimonides &quot;(Rambam)&quot;.

Alfasi remained in Fez for 40 years, during which time he completed his &quot;Sefer Ha-halachot&quot;. In 1088, aged seventy-five, two informers denounced him to the government upon some unknown charge. He left Fes for Al-Andalus, eventually becoming head of the yeshiva in Lucena, Córdoba in 1089.

His &quot;magnanimous character&quot; is illustrated by two incidents. When his opponent Isaac Albalia died, Alfasi adopted Albalia&#x27;s son. When Alfasi was himself on the point of death, he recommended as his successor in the Lucena rabbinate, not his own son, but his pupil Joseph ibn Migash.



==Sefer haHalachot==
Sefer ha-Halachot (ספר ההלכות), also known as Hilchot haRif or Hilchot Rav Alfas (Hebrew: הלכות רב אלפס), was Alfasi&#x27;s main work, written in Fez. It extracts all the pertinent legal decisions from the three Talmudic orders Moed, Nashim and Nezikin as well as the tractates of &quot;Berachot&quot; and &quot;Chulin&quot; - 24 tractates in all. Alfasi transcribed the Talmud&#x27;s halakhic conclusions verbatim, without the surrounding deliberations; he also excludes all Aggadic (non-legal, homiletic) matter as well as discussion of the halakha practicable only in Land of Israel.

Generally the work follows the ordering of the Talmud, but sometimes Talmudic excerpts are moved from place to place, and very rarely non-Talmudic texts are incorporated into the work.

===Impact===
Maimonides wrote that Alfasi&#x27;s work &quot;has superseded all the geonic codes…for it contains all the decisions and laws which we need in our day…&quot;.

&quot;Sefer ha-Halachot&quot; plays a fundamental role in the development of Halakha. Firstly, &quot;the Rif&quot; succeeded in producing a &quot;Digest&quot;, which became the object of close study, and led in its turn to the great &quot;Codes&quot; of Maimonides and of Rabbi Joseph Karo. Secondly, it served as one of the &quot;Three Pillars of Halakha&quot;, as an authority underpinning both the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; and the &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot;. Nissim of Gerona (the &quot;RaN&quot;) compiled a detailed and explicit commentary on this work; in yeshivot, &quot;the Rif and the RaN&quot; are regularly studied as part of the daily Talmudic schedule.

This work was published before the times of Rashi and other commentaries, and resulted in a profound change in the study practices of the scholarly Jewish public in that it opened the world of the gemara to the public at large. It soon became known as the &quot;Talmud Katan&quot; (&quot;Little Talmud&quot;). At the close of the Middle Ages, when the Talmud was banned in Italy, Alfasi&#x27;s code was exempted so that from the 16th to the 19th centuries his work was the primary subject of study of the Italian Jewish community. Alfasi also occupies an important place in the development of the Sephardic method of studying the Talmud. In contradistinction to the Ashkenazi approach, the Sephardim sought to simplify the Talmud and free it from casuistical detail; see for example Hananel ben Hushiel.

==Other works==
Alfasi also left many responsa. These were originally written in Judeo-Arabic and soon translated into Hebrew as &quot;She&#x27;elot u-Teshuvot ha-Rif&quot;.

<text>Bell metal or bell bronze is an alloy used for making bells and related instruments, such as cymbals. It is a form of bronze with a higher tin content than most other bronzes, usually in approximately a 4:1 ratio of copper to tin (typically, 78% copper, 22% tin by mass). The higher tin content increases the rigidity of the metal, and increases the resonance. Historically, it was preferred for early cannons. Today, it also has industrial uses, being specified for valve bodies, piston rings, bearings, and bushings.

==Metallurgy==
Tin and copper are relatively soft metals that will deform on striking (though tin to a lesser extent than copper), but alloying the two creates a metal (bell metal) which is harder and less ductile and also one with more elasticity than either of the two original metals. This metal combination produces a tough, long-wearing material that is resistant to oxidation and subject only to an initial surface weathering. Verdigris forms a protective patina on the surface of bells which coats and protects them against further oxidation. Specifically, it is the combination of low internal damping and low internal sound velocity that makes bell metal specially suitable for resonant percussion instruments.

==Usage==

===Bells===

Most commonly, as per its colloquial name, bell metal has been and is used for the casting of high-quality bells. The metal used is a high-tin alloy of copper and tin with approximately a 4:1 ratio of copper to tin (78% copper, 22% tin). This is a much higher tin component than that used, for example, in statuary bronze.

The range of percentages of tin content can vary from 20% to 26%, depending on the founder who has arrived empirically at their own alloy ratio. It has been found that increasing the tin content increases the decay time of the bell strike, thus making the bell more sonorous. Taking into consideration overall properties, such as tensile strength, hardness, wear resistance, cast quality, sound, and cost, the optimum alloy can probably be obtained by having a type bronze composition as: ~20wt.% tin, &lt; 2wt.% nickel, &lt; 1.5wt.% lead, ~0.01wt.% phosphorus, &lt; 1wt.% antimony, with balance of copper. Bell metal in this range of ratios has been used for more than 3,000 years and is known for its resonance and &quot;attractive sound.&quot; The crystal lattice formation of this alloy is able to absorb high-impact energies, such as from a bell clapper, without distortion, which is the case when the bell is struck. This results in a resonant sound and causes the bell to vibrate strongly in a complex nodal system.

In Russia, church bells are commonly cast with a unique mixture of copper and tin, often with silver added, to produce their unique sonority and resonance, mastered early in Russian Christian history.

In esoteric Buddhism (e.g., Vajrayana), handbells and singing bells may be cast with a special 5-Metal alloy. Each of the metals represents one of the 5 Buddhas / Wisdoms:
There is no standard proportion to the metals used in this alloy, although it is often around 75% copper and 20% tin with low proportions of the other metals. A 7-Metal alloy containing trace amounts of silver and gold (representing Absolute and Relative Truth) is also sometimes used. A similar alloy is employed for the gongs, saron, demung, and numerous other struck metallophones of the Indonesian gamelan ensembles. In this case the tin:copper ratio is traditionally given as 3:10 by weight. Whereas bells are cast and then left to cool, the metal of Indonesian gongs and metallophones is cast as rough blanks which are then hot-forged to their final shape with hammers.

===Cymbals===
===Cannons===
Bell metal was used to cast many early Spanish, Portuguese and &quot;Malay&quot; cannons, most notably the Malay cannon known erroneously as &quot;Rentaka&quot;. In Java, bell metal mixtures including tin were also used for the manufacture of figurines, objets d&#x27;art, sculptures and household goods for the wealthy. This material was also adopted by the Javanese-influenced cultures of Thailand, Khmer and Myanmar. Bell metal is particularly prized for its excellent sonorous qualities, also found in bell metal cannons which produce a distinct, loud ring when fired.

The Javanese lantaka was first cast in bell metal under an &quot;Empu&quot; of the early Majapahit Empire and spread into the surrounding islands of the Nusantara, Javanese skill in gunsmithing and cannon-founding affording military dominance over the surrounding area. Later, disaffected smiths and noble entourages emigrating from Java brought these cannon-founding skill to Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Myanmar. When Ternate was captured by the Spanish, they were astounded to find over 3,000 very finely cast bell metal cannons in the walled compound, although humorously to the Spaniards these were tied upright to veranda poles, used as lingam household decorations rather than weapons. The Spanish and Portuguese were equally astounded to find their European bronze cannon offerings to the Javanese rejected as inferior in quality, as they rightly were.

After the Dutch victories, Javanese-smithed cannons of Makassar, Ternate, and the surrounding islands were taken as reparations, considered by the Dutch
as made of bronze superior to their own, and subsequently melted down and recast in Dutch standard calibres and bores.

Culturally, Javanese bronze cannons and their regional derivatives were traditionally part of a dowry, and offering a poor-quality cast bronze cannon was a supreme insult. Brunei and Malaysia retain the tradition of a token cannon as a dowry for weddings, and many celebrations are opened with a celebratory shot.

===Utensils===
In India, in the state of Assam, it is called &#x27; while in West Bengal and Odisha, &#x27;, it is called &#x27; in Kannada and is used for cooking and eating utensils. Sarthebari in Barpeta district of Assam holds a unique place in the production of &#x27; utensils. In Assam, utensils of &#x27; have many religious uses and the most unusual utensils, &#x27; and &quot;&quot;, are used to give offerings and puja or to show respect to honored guests and dignitaries. Belaguntha in Ganjam district, Kantilo in Nayagarh, and Balakati near Bhubaneswar are well known for this craft in Odisha.
In the state of Kerala, ( vessels) bring back memories of (jackfruit halva). In summer when jackfruits are available aplenty, huge quantities of would be made in the backyard over a log fire and consumed in a trice, the richness of fruits, jaggery and ghee. are made from bell metal. (also made from a kind of bell metal) is synonymous with a Tamil bride&#x27;s first when freshly harvested rice is offered to the sun god with turmeric and sugarcane.

<text>John Stephens Orr (6 March 1907 – 1990) was a Scottish Glasgow photographer whose subject matter was often people or motor cars. Practising between 1930 and 1970 in Glasgow&#x27;s Langside and later at No. 4 Somerset Place, Charing Cross, he became known for his portraits of society figures in magazines such as &quot;Scottish Field&quot;.

His photographs were often of judges posing in full regalia, antidisestablishmentarianism lawyers, Duchesses and controversial music hall characters. Orr also photographed some internationally famous celebrities and captains of industry, all visitors to Glasgow. Some of the personalities that he photographed include:

* Paul Robeson — U.S. vocalist and black activist
* Dame Marie Rambert — Polish dancer and choreographer; founder of Ballet Rambert
* Marc Chagall — Jewish painter
* Richard Burton — Welsh actor
* Stanley Baxter — Scottish comedian
* Jacques Tati — French film maker
* Paul Tortelier — French cellist
* David Brown, Aston Martin cars
* William Lyons, Jaguar, Austin cars
* Walter Owen Bentley, Rolls-Royce/Bentley cars
* Nicholas Fairbairn — Scottish lawyer and British politician

Orr wore a distinctive kilt and was photographed in a portrait style similar to Yousuf Karsh. He recorded the last glimmers of a confident Scottish society in flamboyant style. His later life was spent with his wife, Jenny, on the Scottish Clyde coast island of Cumbrae.

He died in Cumbrae, aged 83.

<text>Charles Edward Spackman VC, MM (11 January 1891 – 7 May 1969) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 26 years old, and a sergeant in the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 November 1917 at Marcoing, France, the leading company was checked by heavy fire from a gun mounted on a position which covered the approaches. Sergeant Spackman, realising that it would be impossible for the troops to advance, went through heavy fire to the gun, where he succeeded in killing all but one of the gun crew and then captured the gun.

He was demobilised at the end of the war and rejoined the Border Regiment, as a part of the Territorial Force. He was issued serial number 3589576 in 1920.

Spackman was still a part of the Territorial Force when the Second World War broke out. He volunteered for duty at the outbreak of war in the Kings Royal Rifle Corps as a sergeant major.

<text>The Queen Street massacre was a mass shooting that occurred on 8 December 1987 at Australia Post offices on 191 Queen Street in Melbourne, Victoria.

Frank Vitkovic, a former tennis player and law school withdrawee, entered the building on the pretext of visiting a friend, and opened fire on office workers at random with an illegally modified M1 carbine, killing eight and injuring five. After being disarmed, he crawled from an 11th-floor window and died on impact.

==Event==
===Background===
Vitkovic was born on 7 September 1965 to a Croatian father and an Italian mother. Along with an older sister, he grew up in the Melbourne suburb of West Preston. He attended Redden Catholic College (formerly Immaculate Heart College, Preston, later renamed Samaritan Catholic College) in Preston. He was also a keen tennis player, winning a number of local club competitions, but his career was derailed by an ongoing knee injury. He started a law degree course at Melbourne University in 1984 but, due to poor grades, had voluntarily discontinued that course in early 1987.

On 8 December 1987 at around 4:20 p.m., Vitkovic entered the building at 191 Queen Street, Melbourne, carrying a sawn-off M1 carbine in a brown paper bag. Vitkovic went to the 5th floor office of the Telecom Employees Credit Co-operative where a former friend (and the primary target), Con Margelis, worked. Margelis was called to the counter and briefly spoke with Vitkovic, who then presented his weapon from the bag. The weapon jammed, and Margelis ducked behind a counter; Vitkovic then began shooting, killing a young female office worker, Judith Morris. A robbery alarm was activated by a staff member at 4:22 p.m. Margelis escaped the office unharmed, and hid in the women&#x27;s restroom. Vitkovic took an elevator to the 12th floor, to the Australia Post philately security section. There, Vitkovic shot and injured a man and a woman, then pointed his gun at a woman sitting at her desk, only to pan his aim to the left and shoot Julie McBean and Nancy Avignone dead. A man in the corner office on that level, Warren Spencer, was also killed.

Vitkovic then ran down the stairs to level 11, shooting indiscriminately. He went into the computer training centre, shooting Michael McGuire at point-blank range, killing him. He then went to the north-east corner of the office floor, cornering several office workers at their desks. Marianne Van Ewyk, Catherine Dowling, and Rodney Brown were fatally shot in that area, some while hiding under their desks. Three other workers were wounded there. Several victims were shot in the head at very close range as they attempted to hide. A male office worker, Donald McElroy (who had been shot once), and Tony Gioia tackled Vitkovic, while Frank Carmody, who had been shot several times, ripped the rifle out of his possession. Gioia and Carmody were later awarded Australia&#x27;s second-highest bravery decoration, the Star of Courage. A wounded female worker, Rosemary Spiteri, took the rifle and hid it in a refrigerator.

Vitkovic climbed through an open window, apparently trying to clamber onto an external ledge of the building. Gioia held him by the ankles, trying to prevent his escape. Vitkovic broke free and fell to his death on the pavement 11 stories below.

No one died in the building&#x27;s elevators, and Vitkovic did not shoot at police or into the street. One bullet pierced a window on the 11th floor. It was believed that around 1,000 people were in the building at the time of the shootings. After the killer&#x27;s fall, police and members of the special operations group searched the building for accomplices.

Vitkovic had fallen at 4:27 p.m.; police started their search of the building at 4:30 p.m. At 5:00 p.m., the Special Operations Group confirmed that the dead man on the street was indeed Vitkovic, and the all clear was given for ambulance crew to enter the building to attend to the injured.

===Aftermath===
A search of Vitkovic&#x27;s room after the killings revealed that Vitkovic kept press clippings of the Clifton Hill massacre, with extracts underlined in red. Police believed he had always intended to shoot people in the Queen Street building. It was reported that Vitkovic had left a note at his home; police indicated that it was not a suicide note. Vitkovic had obtained a shooter&#x27;s permit and had purchased the gun a few weeks before the shooting. He had illegally modified the .30 M1 carbine, by reducing the barrel&#x27;s length. It was loaded with jacketed ammunition.

In the note, addressed to his parents and dated the day of the massacre, he wrote &quot;Today is going to be the day. The anger in my head has got too much for me. I&#x27;ve got to get rid of my violent impulses. The time has come to die. There is no other way out.&quot; The note had not been read by his parents before it was discovered by police.

Vitkovic had obtained his shooting permit on 17 September 1987. When asked at that time why he wanted such a permit, Vitkovic stated &quot;I desire to go hunting&quot;. He purchased the rifle on lay-by, collecting it 21 October 1987. Before the shooting, Vitkovic had removed the barrel and the handle of the weapon.

After the shooting, a neighbourhood friend of the family said that Vitkovic was an excellent student, a good tennis player, friendly and helpful, over six feet tall and very good looking. He had been a promising tennis player, but his career was derailed due to a knee injury.

After the shooting, a rumour circulated that he had sought help from Melbourne University counselling service on the day of the shooting. The head of law at the university, Susie Nixon, later told &quot;The Age&quot; that while Vitkovic had once sought counselling during his career with the law school, reports that he had been at the university on the date of the shooting were &quot;totally unfounded&quot;. He had not left his course with hostility and Nixon believed there was no direct link between the shooting and his &quot;deferral&quot; from his course. A former secretary of the club where Vitkovic played tennis said he often threw on-court tantrums and did not easily accept losses. He had won a singles championship in his first year at the club but left the next year after he lost the title.

==Coronial enquiry==
The coronial enquiry in September 1988 heard that there was chaos during and immediately after the shooting and there was uncertainty over which of the police officers present was in charge. When the ambulance crew entered the building with police, the police shouted to announce their presence as lifts arrived at their destination. Police on the floor also called out and pointed their guns in the direction of the lift. According to Inspector Adrian Fyfe, the officer in charge at the scene, the first police officer on the scene, a traffic policeman, had acted appropriately. He had used his initiative to isolate the area and had made an accurate assessment of the situation. Fyfe criticised this officer&#x27;s &quot;appalling&quot; lack of knowledge of &quot;police command structure&quot; for not realising who was in charge until 5:00 p.m., 40 minutes after his arrival. Fyfe said the radio call sign he used identified him as the officer in charge.

Con Margelis testified to the coronial enquiry that he and Vitkovic had been friends for several years. Margelis said after Vitkovic arrived to see him on 8 December, he pulled out his rifle, tried to pull the trigger and then aimed it at a female colleague and told her not to move. Knowing that Vitkovic could not move quickly due to a bad knee, Margelis jumped over the counter and hid in the women&#x27;s toilets on the 5th floor. Margelis said he expected that Vitkovic would come after him, leaving others in the office safe. Of possible reasons for Vitkovic&#x27;s actions, Margelis said he had not seen Vitkovic in the months prior, adding that &quot;I can&#x27;t really explain&quot;. Margelis said Vitkovic had become depressed and embittered after injuring his leg playing tennis, followed by a failed operation to repair the damage. Margelis said he began to see little of Vitkovic due to his depression.

Another employee in the 5th floor office said that their colleague Judith Morris was shot as Margelis attempted to leap over the counter: &quot;He was after Con and Judy was in the way.&quot; This witness described Vitkovic&#x27;s eyes as being those of someone &quot;completely insane&quot; and his laugh as &quot;sick&quot; and not human, adding that he laughed after shooting Morris.

Officer worker Tony Gioia told the inquest he tackled Vitkovic, having just witnessed a co-worker being shot dead at point-blank range. Gioia believed he would be the next victim once Vitkovic turned around and saw him. Gioia said during the scuffle, Vitkovic lunged for the window and struggled to get out, until he was hanging from the ledge with Gioia holding Vitkovic by the ankles. Despite others helping to restrain Vitkovic, he broke free and fell to the street to his death. A woman in an adjacent office building told the inquest she believed she saw a man in a blue jumper throw the man onto the balcony, and then push him out when he moved back to the window. Under cross examination, she incorrectly identified this as occurring on the building&#x27;s 10th floor, not the 11th, and stated that her building was from the Australia Post building.

The counsel assisting the coroner, Julian Leckie, judged that this witness was &quot;honest but mistaken&quot;. He said that photographs showed Gioia was not wearing a blue sweater on the day. Evidence showed that Vitkovic tried to jump and others tried to prevent this. Leckie also concluded that Rodney Brown would have died from his wounds no matter what was done.

The psychologist in charge of the team counselling workers and their families said the video of Vitkovic shooting his gun on the 5th floor should not be made public as it would cause significant distress to those being counselled. He advised against publishing a still image of Vitkovic taken from the video. Media outlets had requested copies of the video. The coroner, Hal Hallenstein, said the material presented at the inquest was public and had to be presented in a public way. A pathologist told the inquest that he found no legal or illegal drugs or alcohol in Vitkovic&#x27;s system. He also said that Vitkovic was killed instantly from multiple injuries consistent with falling from a great height.

The contents of Vitkovic&#x27;s diary were read to the inquest on its 12th day. The diary included apologies to his family for his planned actions, and a suicide note. Among his comments to his sister, he wrote &quot;It&#x27;s time for me to die. Life is just not worth living.&quot; The final diary entry, written on the day of the shooting, read &quot;Today I must do it, there is no other way out.&quot; Earlier entries catalogued his sexual problems. Vitkovic linked those to an incident when he was eight years old and was forced to undress in a school locker room and friends made fun of his uncircumcised penis. &quot;After this nudity was a dirty word for me ... Since the age of 12 I knew that normal sex was not possible for me and I avoided girls completely until I was 19.&quot; In another entry, he wrote &quot;I am the odd man out there&#x27;s no doubting it&quot;; less than a month before the shooting he wrote: &quot;As Rambo said in &quot;First Blood&quot;, once you accept a problem, it&#x27;s no longer there.&quot;

At the coroner&#x27;s hearing on 4 October 1988, Joe Dickson, counsel assisting the court, said that the police response was &quot;satisfactory, and no complaints could be made about it.&quot; He said that police response was fast, and the decision not to send ambulance officers into the building until it was cleared was responsible, noting that no one died because of any delay. He said the police officer who sent people back into the building truly believed he advised them to go to the top floor, despite evidence that he did not. The hearing heard that while three of the people sent back into the building had emotional trauma, no person sent back died or was injured. Dickson conceded that the senior constable who sent people back into the building might not have taken the best course of action.

Dickson said a routine practice on the 12th floor where staff had to open a security door to talk to visitors rendered its security measures ineffective. He said the 5th floor Telecom Credit Union security measures were &quot;adequate for all purposes except the visit of a maniac.&quot; On the 11th floor, no one could have perceived the possibility of a robbery or violence. Dickson said Vitkovic&#x27;s visit to the Melbourne University counsellor in December 1986 could not be seen to have contributed to the killings. He said that Vitkovic probably brooded over the results of a Church of Scientology personality test given to him on 8 October 1987.

The results of the Scientology test showed he &quot;had hit rock bottom&quot;; the person administering the test did not advise Vitkovic to see a psychiatrist but to enrol in a Scientology course. Forensic psychologist Dr Alan Bartholomew told the coroner&#x27;s court that Vitkovic would have been eligible at the time to be certified insane under the Mental Health Act. After studying Vitkovic&#x27;s diaries, Bartholomew concluded he was a paranoid schizophrenic and that there was no doubt the personality test worsened his depression and might have contributed to the decline in his mental state. Batholomew agreed that Vitkovic was criminally insane at the time of the shooting and said Vitkovic could have identified with Rambo and the Hoddle Street killings.

After hearing representations by counsel representing the building tenants directly affected, the families of those killed, and news media organisations, the coroner Hal Hallenstein refused to suppress publication of photographs taken from a 5th-floor security video that showed Vitkovic. He said those images would be made public at the end of the inquest.

==Victims==
*Judith Anne Morris, 19
*Julie Faye McBean, 20
*Annunziata &quot;Nancy&quot; Avignone, 18
*Warren David Spencer, 29
*Michael Francis McGuire, 38
*Marianne Jacoba Van Ewyk, 38
*Catherine Mary Dowling, 28
*Rodney Gerard Brown, 32

All victims died of gunshot wounds.

Brown was still alive when police arrived on the scene but later died. The doctor who performed several of the autopsies told the inquest that even had Brown been taken to a neurological unit within 15 minutes of being shot, his chances for survival would have been &quot;very slight&quot;.

Tony Gioia and Frank Carmody were awarded the &quot;Star of Courage&quot; for conspicuous bravery. Clare Chalkley and Donald McElroy received commendations for bravery.

Many survivors suffered posttraumatic stress.

<doc id="1208292" wikidata="Q1252743" url="?curid=1208292" title="Iotation">
<text>In Slavic languages, iotation (, ) is a form of palatalization that occurs when a consonant comes into contact with the palatal approximant from the succeeding phoneme. The is represented by iota (ι) in the early Cyrillic alphabet and the Greek alphabet on which it is based. For example, &quot;ni&quot; in English &quot;onion&quot; has the sound of iotated &quot;n&quot;. Iotation is a phenomenon distinct from Slavic first palatalization in which only the front vowels are involved, but the final result is similar.

==Sound change==
Iotation occurs when a labial (, ), dental (, , ) or velar (, , ) consonant comes into contact with an &quot;iotated vowel&quot;, i.e. one preceded by a palatal glide . As a result, the consonant becomes partially or completely palatalized. In many Slavic languages, iotated consonants are called &quot;soft&quot; and the process of iotation is called &quot;softening&quot;.

Iotation can result in a partial palatalization so the centre of the tongue is raised during, and sometimes after, the articulation of the consonant. There can also be a complete sound change to a palatal or alveolo-palatal consonant. This table summarizes the typical outcomes in the modern Slavic languages:
According to most scholars, the period of iotation started approximately in the 5th century, in the era of Proto-Slavic, and it lasted for several centuries, probably into the late Common Slavic dialect differentiation. Here is an example from the early stage:
* Proto-Slavic *&#x27;/kьасьа &gt; Russian, Ukrainian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Serbian &#x27; &quot;(čaša)&quot;, Czech &quot;, Croatian čaša

==Orthography==
=== Iotated vowels ===
In Slavic languages, iotated vowels are preceded by a palatal approximant before a vowel, at the beginning of a word, or between two vowels in the middle of a word, creating a diphthongoid, a partial diphthong. In the Greek alphabet, the consonant is represented by iota (ι). For example, the English &quot;apple&quot; is cognate to Russian &quot;яблоко (jabloko)&quot;: both come from Proto-Indo-European stem *ābol-. As a result of the phenomenon, no native Slavic root starts with an or an but only with a and ; although other vowels are possible. An exception to this is Bulgarian, which has lost iotation for all front vowels (compared to Russian or Polish, who lost it only before ).

As it was invented for the writing of Slavic languages, the original Cyrillic alphabet has relatively complex ways for representing iotation by devoting an entire class of letters to deal with the issue. There are letters which represent iotated vowels; the same letters also palatalize preceding consonants (with or without self-iotation), which is why iotation and palatalization are often mixed up. There are also two special letters (&quot;soft sign&quot; Ь and &quot;hard sign&quot; Ъ) that also induce iotation; in addition, Ь palatalizes preceding consonant, allowing combinations of both palatalized (soft) and plain (hard) consonants with . Originally, these letters produced short vowels and . The exact use depends on the language.

The adjective for a phone which undergoes iotation is &quot;iotated&quot;. The adjective for a letter formed as a ligature of the Early Cyrillic I (І) and another letter, used to represent iotation, is &quot;iotated&quot;.. The use of an iotated letter does not necessarily denote iotation. Even an iotated letter following a consonant letter is not iotated in most orthographies, but iotated letters imply iotated pronunciation after vowels and soft and hard signs as well as in isolation.

In the Cyrillic alphabet, some letter forms are iotated, formed as a ligature of Early Cyrillic I (І) and a vowel.

In old inscriptions, other iotated letters, even consonants, could be found, but they are not in the regular alphabet.

There are more letters that serve the same function, but their glyphs are not made in the same way.
=== Iotated consonants ===
Iotated consonants occur as result of iotation. They are represented in IPA with superscript &quot;j&quot; after it and in X-SAMPA with apostrophe after it so the pronunciation of iotated &quot;n&quot; could be represented as or [].

When Vuk Karadžić reformed the Serbian language, he created new letters to represent iotated consonants. Macedonian uses two of them, but has its own versions for iotated &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot; (resembling the letters Г and К instead of Т and Д):

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Northern Idaho and Spokane, Kennedy attended Spokane Falls Community College to study music theory. He began his music career in 1990 as the lead guitarist of the instrumental jazz ensemble Cosmic Dust, with which he released one studio album. His second band, Citizen Swing, released two studio albums before disbanding in 1996. With fellow Citizen Swing member Craig Johnson, Kennedy founded the rock band The Mayfield Four, for which he provided lead vocals and guitar. The band released two studio albums and broke up in 2002. After declining an offer to audition as the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver, he was asked to join Alter Bridge by Mark Tremonti in late 2003, formally joining in 2004, and he has been with the band ever since. He has released seven studio albums with Alter Bridge.

While Alter Bridge was on tour in 2008, Kennedy and former members of Led Zeppelin met and improvised as a group in an informal jam session, but the band never fully materialized. He then started working with Slash, featuring on the guitarist&#x27;s 2010 eponymous solo album on two tracks and later serving as Slash&#x27;s vocalist on tour. In 2012, Kennedy filled in with short notice for Guns N&#x27; Roses lead singer Axl Rose when Rose refused to show up for the band&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. With Slash, Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators have recorded four studio albums. Kennedy&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Year of the Tiger&quot;, was released in 2018, and his second solo album, &quot;The Ides of March&quot;, was released in 2021.

== Early life ==

Kennedy was born as Myles Richard Bass on November 27, 1969, in Boston, Massachusetts, and subsequently lived in Northern Idaho. As a child, he moved to Spokane, Washington, where he grew up in a Christian Science family on a farm. His father, Richard Bass, died when he was four years old and his mother subsequently went on to marry a Methodist minister, and the family took the surname Kennedy. Before Kennedy attended Mead High School (which he attended with football player Jason Hanson and Everclear bassist Craig Montoya), he found musical inspiration from Led Zeppelin, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and John Sykes&#x27; Blue Murder band. Kennedy began playing trumpet at the age of ten and was in a teen air guitar band with then best friends Michael Murphy, Mark Terzenbach and Bruce Kidd at 13. He later traded for a real guitar copying the playing style of Jimmy Page.

He found his singing voice by listening to his parents&#x27; Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder records, and also states that he was influenced by Robert Plant. He played guitar in the school&#x27;s jazz band and trumpet in the school&#x27;s marching band. He also spent some time playing in a local heavy metal band called Bittersweet with some of his friends Zia Uddin on drums, Jason Stewart as lead vocal, Mark Terzenbach (and later, Chris Steffens) on bass and Myles on lead guitar. After graduating in 1988, he enrolled in Spokane Falls Community College to study music.

== Career ==

=== Bittersweet/Amethyst: 1987-1990 ===
After participating in the Rock Off in Spokane, Washington on May 22, 1987, with his band Bittersweet, which consisted of Myles Kennedy (guitar), Mark Terzenbach (bass), Joel Tipke (keyboards), Zia Uddin (drums), and Jason Stewart (vocals), he met Mark Fekete (lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist) of Amethyst, And filled in as their lead guitarist for a season. Though Myles only filled in on lead guitar, he had always dabbled around with his passion for singing, which was later showcased in a guitar contest at a local music store in Spokane.

=== Cosmic Dust and Citizen Swing: 1990–1995 ===
Upon graduating from high school in 1988, Kennedy enrolled in a Commercial Music/Jazz Studies program at Spokane Falls Community College. Using the skills he learned from this course, in 1990 he began playing guitar for a jazz group called the Cosmic Dust Fusion Band, which was formed by keyboardist Jim Templeton in 1990. Kennedy&#x27;s guitar work with Cosmic Dust was advanced; using his knowledge of jazz theory in conjunction with his advanced technical abilities, interweaving difficult techniques such as chord changes on impulse and precise shredding with rock music, he became a well-respected guitarist among local musicians. Cosmic Dust&#x27;s first album, &quot;Journey&quot;, was released in 1991. The album was well received by critics. In 1993, the song &quot;Spiritus&quot; was awarded the Washington State Artist Trust Grant for $5,000.

After the release of &quot;Journey&quot;, Kennedy left Cosmic Dust to begin working on a new band that would become Citizen Swing, for which Kennedy provided both lead vocals and lead guitar. They were described as &quot;a band that combined the sounds of funk, soul, R&amp;B, blues and alternative into a unique and cohesive sound&quot; and as &quot; meets Stevie Wonder and then some.&quot; They released their first album, &quot;Cure Me with the Groove&quot;, in 1993. This album featured Kennedy (who helped produce the album), rhythm guitarist Craig Johnson, bassist Dave Turner (also of Cosmic Dust), drummer/percussionist Mike Tschirgi, and trumpeter Geoff Miller. Citizen Swing&#x27;s second and final album was called &quot;Deep Down&quot; and was released in 1995. The band disbanded the same year. All the music and lyrics on that album were written by Kennedy. &quot;Journey&quot;, &quot;Cure Me with the Groove&quot;, and &quot;Deep Down&quot; are rare albums and are sought after by fans.

=== The Mayfield Four: 1995–2002 ===
In 1995, Kennedy started teaching guitar in a store called Rock City Music. By August 1996, he became the lead vocalist and lead guitarist of The Mayfield Four, a rock band he formed with his childhood friends Zia Uddin, Marty Meisner, and Craig Johnson (also of Citizen Swing). They signed a contract with Epic Records thanks to a critically acclaimed demo called &quot;Thirty Two Point Five Hours&quot; that the band recorded in 1996, followed by a live extended play called &quot;Motion&quot; in 1997. The Mayfield Four&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Fallout&quot;, was supported with a fifteen-month tour with bands such as Creed, Big Wreck, and Stabbing Westward. The album was praised by critics, but it failed to chart, and ultimately became the only album by the band to feature rhythm guitarist Craig Johnson, who was fired from the band due to undisclosed reasons.

Following the &quot;Fallout&quot; tour, Kennedy made an appearance in the 2001 drama film &quot;Rock Star&quot; starring Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. He said that he got a call from his manager telling him that the filmmakers needed someone who could sing high and that his name was suggested. On the set of the film, he met Wahlberg along with Zakk Wylde and Jason Bonham, who also appeared in the movie alongside several other notable musicians. Kennedy was the only actor in the movie whose actual singing voice was used. In the movie, directly paralleling a scene at the beginning of the film, Kennedy&#x27;s character (Mike, also known as &quot;Thor&quot;) is noticed by Wahlberg&#x27;s character, Chris &quot;Izzy&quot; Cole, the lead singer of Thor&#x27;s favorite band, Steel Dragon. Izzy pulls Thor onstage and sings the rest of the song with him, eventually telling him to finish the rest of the band&#x27;s concert. The film was met with mostly mixed reviews, garnering a 52% &quot;Rotten&quot; score on Rotten Tomatoes.

The Mayfield Four&#x27;s second and final album, &quot;Second Skin&quot;, was released in June 2001. Kennedy has since said that it is one of the most personal records he has made. The album has been critically acclaimed and Kennedy has commented on how it and &quot;Fallout&quot; are much more popular now than when they were released.

Though popular, The Mayfield Four never garnered enough exposure to break into the mainstream. In 2002, the future of the band began to look unlikely, and Kennedy began recording new music, which he described as &quot;Daniel Lanois meets Massive Attack.&quot; The band went on hiatus that year, and would ultimately disband. In an interview with &quot;Pulse Weekly&quot; in 2004, Kennedy said that it was because he was &quot;burned out with the whole rock industry at that point.&quot; However, three previously unreleased songs appeared on a fan-run Myspace page dedicated to and approved by The Mayfield Four in early 2010, causing rumors of a possible reunion to begin circulating. However, when asked about this during an interview, Kennedy replied that he does not see it happening.

=== Velvet Revolver audition offer: 2002 ===
After The Mayfield Four&#x27;s unforeseen breakup, and due to a hearing disorder called tinnitus that he developed because of listening to music that he was recording at earsplitting volumes, Kennedy fell into depression in 2002. He said about music, &quot;I can&#x27;t do it any more. My ears won&#x27;t let me.&quot; He said that he had grown &quot;disillusioned with music and the music business,&quot; so he took a hiatus from playing music and went back to teaching guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;11/30/10 interview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2002, he was contacted by former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash, who was looking for a vocalist for a band he was forming, but Kennedy declined the offer. Other sources state that Kennedy had sent in a demo tape but still ultimately declined an invitation to audition after being approached by Matt Sorum. Kennedy recalls, &quot;They had reached out to me in 2002 when they were just getting together. They had sent me a demo tape, and I kind of sat on it for a month, and I didn&#x27;t really follow up on it.&quot;

=== Alter Bridge: 2003–present ===
Kennedy is best known as the lead vocalist and one of the two lead guitarists in the band, alongside Mark Tremonti (formerly of Creed). The band&#x27;s origins lie in late 2003 when Kennedy was contacted by Tremonti, who was interested in having Kennedy lay down vocal tracks for some songs he had recently written. Tremonti and drummer Scott Phillips had reunited with former bassist Brian Marshall who had left Creed in 2000 to form a new band. Alter Bridge, taking its name from an actual bridge that used to be located near Tremonti&#x27;s home in Detroit, was officially formed in January 2004. Coinciding with the official announcement of Alter Bridge&#x27;s formation was an announcement regarding their debut album, &quot;One Day Remains&quot;, along with the release of that album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Open Your Eyes.&quot; &quot;One Day Remains&quot; was released in 2004 on Wind-up Records. It received generally mixed to negative reviews and was certified Gold by the RIAA. Two other singles, &quot;Find the Real&quot; and &quot;Broken Wings&quot; were released. &quot;One Day Remains&quot; was the only album by a band with Kennedy as an official member that does not feature his guitar playing, before his 2014 album &quot;World On Fire&quot; as a part of Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators.
Following a successful tour in support of the album, Alter Bridge announced plans for a second release. The album, &quot;Blackbird&quot;, was released in 2007 on Universal Republic to mostly positive reviews. Unlike &quot;One Day Remains&quot;, which was largely written by Tremonti, &quot;Blackbird&quot; featured Kennedy&#x27;s guitar playing as well as more of his songwriting contributions. Alter Bridge toured in support of &quot;Blackbird&quot; throughout 2007 and 2008, recording a concert film titled &quot;Live from Amsterdam&quot; and releasing it in 2009 via Amazon.com. It would later be released in stores in early 2011 after several delays.

Alter Bridge took a temporary break in early 2009 with its members working on other projects, but the band continued writing music throughout the year. The band regrouped later that year to begin work on their third album, &quot;AB III&quot;, which was released in 2010 on Roadrunner Records worldwide, except for North America where the album was self-released on Alter Bridge Recordings via EMI. For the album, Kennedy chose to write lyrics based on his own personal experiences with faith and believing. As such, it is lyrically the band&#x27;s darkest album, with Kennedy calling it the most personal album he had made since The Mayfield Four&#x27;s &quot;Second Skin&quot;. &quot;AB III&quot; has received critical acclaim. A second concert film, &quot;Live at Wembley&quot;, was released on March 26, 2012. The band reunited in late 2012 and recorded from April to July 2013 their fourth album titled &quot;Fortress&quot;, which was released on September 30, 2013. The band reconvened in January 2016 and, through that July, recorded their fifth album &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, which was released on October 7, 2016. &quot;Walk the Sky&quot; was released on October 18, 2019.

Having joined Alter Bridge primarily as lead vocalist, Kennedy began to play rhythm guitar during live performances following the release of &quot;One Day Remains&quot;. He has since played rhythm guitar on the band&#x27;s subsequent studio releases, and also played lead tracks on a number of songs and during live performances.

== Solo career and collaborations ==
=== Work with Led Zeppelin members: 2008–2009 ===

Kennedy received a great amount of press coverage in late 2008, owing to a rumour that he was to join Led Zeppelin. After Zeppelin&#x27;s one-off reunion in 2007, guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones reportedly felt the band &quot;still had something to offer.&quot; As reported by BBC News, Page and Jones were in the studio with Jason Bonham writing and recording material that was reportedly to be used for a new Zeppelin album. According to Bonham, singer Robert Plant was not involved. Page, Jones, and Bonham auditioned singers, fuelling rumours when they were reported to have attended an Alter Bridge concert. Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider said that they were offering Kennedy the job to persuade Plant to reconsider. Alter Bridge guitarist Mark Tremonti said Kennedy &quot;deserves&quot; to play with Zeppelin.

Kennedy remained mostly silent about the rumours until January 2009. &quot;I am not singing in Led Zeppelin or any offshoot of Led Zeppelin,&quot; he said. &quot;I did have a great opportunity and it was something that I&#x27;m very grateful for. But Alter Bridge will go on, and that&#x27;s that.&quot; He later confirmed, however, that he had written and rehearsed with Page, Jones and Bonham. He also said that it was Bonham who &quot;got the ball rolling&quot;, since the two had met on the set of the 2001 film &quot;Rock Star&quot;.

&quot;Working with them felt surreal,&quot; he recalled a decade later. &quot;Jimmy played the Les Paul, and just being in the room with that guitar would have been enough for me. But standing next to him as he&#x27;s playing those iconic riffs, the hairs on the back of my neck are standing up. We played &#x27;No Quarter&#x27;, &#x27;Kashmir&#x27;… We did &#x27;Carouselambra&#x27;, which was a really challenging arrangement. A lot of wonderful moments.&quot; It is unconfirmed if the songs he wrote with Page, Jones, and Bonham will ever be released. Kennedy maintains that the band, had it materialised, would not have been called Led Zeppelin.

=== Solo career: 2009–2010; 2017–present ===
Kennedy has performed two solo benefit concerts: one hosted by Paul Reed Smith and PRS Guitars to benefit cancer patients, and another to benefit abused children. The latter was called Bofest 2009 and was headlined by Kennedy on October 17, 2009. In early 2009, Kennedy announced a solo side project. He described the material as &quot;dreamy&quot; and &quot;[not] aggressive&quot;, saving those songs for Alter Bridge. He also said, &quot;It&#x27;s more singer/songwriter based. I will say it&#x27;s going to be interesting.&quot; He later posted on his Myspace page that he is working with some &quot;great people&quot; and that he has details coming at a future date. Slash announced via Facebook on February 1, 2010, that he would be appearing on Kennedy&#x27;s solo record, and Kennedy confirmed this via Myspace. Kennedy had originally hoped that his album would be released in early 2010, digitally first and then on CD, but he has since put its release on hold. However, he recently said that he is still too busy to release the album as he stated that he would like to tour to promote it, but he wanted to release it on December 21, 2012, as a joke, although a firm release date has not yet been announced.

When asked if the record would be a departure from his previous work, he replied that it is different and again referred to the singer-songwriter approach that would be featured on it and that it would not be a hard rock album. He also said that &quot;it was maybe the most difficult thing I&#x27;ve ever done in the sense that I didn&#x27;t have a band.&quot; He also said that the music is very intimate and that it features piano as well. In an interview with &quot;Guitarist&quot; UK magazine, he said that some of the songs will feature jazz, blues, and R&amp;B influences, while others still &quot;get quite atmospheric and ethereal,&quot; comparing the sound to Daniel Lanois and Massive Attack, while assuring fans that the rock style will still be present. In the same &quot;Guitarist&quot; interview, he confirmed the titles of three songs that will appear on his record: &quot;The Light of Day&quot;, &quot;Complicated Man&quot;, and &quot;The Bar Fly&quot;. Most recently, he confirmed that another song will be titled &quot;Love Rain Down&quot;. He said in an interview with CraveOnline that &quot;Love Rain Down&quot; differs from anything else he has ever written. In 2017, he said he shelved the songs he had written and started over. His debut solo album, &quot;Year of the Tiger&quot;, was released on March 9, 2018. Kennedy&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;The Ides of March&quot;, was released on May 14, 2021.

On October 11, 2024, Myles released his third solo album, &quot;The Art of Letting Go&quot;, revealing plans to tour Europe and the US. In interviews, Myles described the album as a &quot;full-on riff based rock record&quot;., and mentioned how the record was recorded on, and often inspired by, his newly released signature PRS guitar 

=== Work with Slash: 2009–present ===
Kennedy has become very well known for his collaborations with Guns N&#x27; Roses lead guitarist Slash. In late 2009, it was reported that they would be working together on Slash&#x27;s self-titled debut solo album. Slash later confirmed that Kennedy was chosen to sing and co-write the final song, &quot;Starlight&quot;, on his album. Other musicians who appeared on the album include Ozzy Osbourne, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, Kid Rock, and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden. Then, according to MusicRadar, Slash asked Kennedy to co-write and sing another song, &quot;Back from Cali&quot;, which was added to the album at the last minute, making him the only musician to appear on more than one song on the album&#x27;s standard track listing. The album was released in April 2010.

On February 3, 2010, Slash announced that Kennedy would be the lead vocalist for his band on tour. On tour, Kennedy performed a number of songs found throughout Slash&#x27;s catalog. Slash and Kennedy were also the supporting act on Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s tour in 2010. The other members of Slash&#x27;s band are rhythm guitarist Bobby Schneck (replaced as of the Apocalyptic Love tour with Frank Sidoris), bassist Todd Kerns (formerly of Age of Electric), and drummer Brent Fitz (formerly of Theory of a Deadman). In late 2010, Kennedy and Slash appeared on &quot;That Metal Show&quot;, a talk show on VH1 Classic. On November 14, 2011, Slash released a concert film and live album titled &quot;Made in Stoke 24/7/11&quot; featuring Kennedy and the rest of his band.

Slash&#x27;s second solo album featured Myles Kennedy, this time as the sole vocalist. It was also announced that band mates Bobby Schneck, Todd Kerns, and Brent Fitz, along with Slash, would complete the lineup for the album. In an interview with MusicRadar, Slash confirmed that it would be less of an actual solo album and more of a collaboration album with Kennedy, and that he was not sure if the album will be billed to Slash or a new name entirely. As of December 2011, three songs had been recorded: &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Standing in the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Bad Rain&quot;. Slash has described the music as &quot;very heavy&quot;. The album was released on May 22, 2012. A behind-the-scenes video was also released with this announcement. Titled &quot;Apocalyptic Love&quot;, the album will be billed to &quot;Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators&quot;, featuring Kennedy, Kerns, and Fitz as members of Slash&#x27;s band. The band performed the album in its entirety on April 11, 2012, at the &quot;Revolver&quot; Golden God Awards. The first single, &quot;You&#x27;re a Lie&quot;, was released to rock radio on February 27, 2012; a 30-second preview of the song was released online. Kennedy has reportedly said that some of the lyrics on the album are about his earlier experiences with drugs. On April 14, 2012, Kennedy performed three Guns N&#x27; Roses songs with five former members of Guns N&#x27; Roses during their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in Axl Rose&#x27;s absence. In 2013, he also toured with Kings of Chaos, along with Slash and other ex-Guns N&#x27; Roses members. The band&#x27;s second collective album &quot;World on Fire&quot;, produced by Michael &quot;Elvis&quot; Baskette, was released on September 16, 2014. The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Living the Dream&quot;, again produced by Michael &quot;Elvis&quot; Baskette, was released on September 21, 2018. The fourth record, titled &quot;4&quot; and produced by Dave Cobb, was released on February 11, 2022.

=== Other session work: 2001–present ===
Kennedy is further well known for his work as a session musician and songwriter, having collaborated with several artists. In 2001, he appeared on the album &quot;Striped Suit: Lo-Fi&quot; by the jazz-rock band Mulligan, playing guitar solos on the songs &quot;Faron&quot; and &quot;Make It Three&quot;. In that same year, he provided backing vocals to the song &quot;Breakthrough&quot; by Big Wreck from &quot;The Pleasure and the Greed&quot;. He also worked with the Spokane based nu-metal band Five Foot Thick on their 2003 album &quot;Blood Puddle&quot;, providing backing vocals to the song &quot;Ducked Out&quot;. In 2005, he sang the chorus of &quot;Nameless Faceless&quot; by Fozzy with Fozzy frontman Chris Jericho from their album &quot;All That Remains&quot;. In 2008, he sang a duet with Sevendust lead vocalist Lajon Witherspoon on Sevendust&#x27;s song &quot;Sorrow&quot; from &quot;Chapter VII: Hope &amp; Sorrow&quot;. Also in 2008, Kennedy made a guest appearance on Mark Tremonti&#x27;s guitar instructional DVD &quot;The Sound &amp; the Story&quot;, to which Kennedy provided an in-depth lesson on how to play his guitar solo on the Alter Bridge song &quot;Blackbird&quot;. In 2009, he appeared on Slash&#x27;s self-titled album, co-writing and singing lead vocals on the songs &quot;Back from Cali&quot; and &quot;Starlight&quot;. In addition, he has made live appearances with Sevendust and Gov&#x27;t Mule. In 2011 it was announced that he will appear on a planned tribute album to Tommy Bolin. Further details were announced in January 2012 that the album would be called &quot;Great Gypsy Soul&quot;. It was released on March 27, 2012, on 429 Records, and Kennedy appeared on a song called &quot;Dreamer&quot; with Nels Cline of Wilco. Other contributors include Steve Lukather, Joe Bonamassa, Peter Frampton, and Glenn Hughes. In 2016, he collaborated with rapper Darryl McDaniels and Disturbed bassist John Moyer on the song &quot;Flames&quot;. Also in 2016, he sang on &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; on the Richards/Crane debut album, &quot;World Stands Still&quot;.

== Artistry and influences ==
Kennedy is influenced by a wide range of artists of several genres. His earliest influence was Led Zeppelin, although he drew his singing influences from jazz, blues, rhythm and blues, and soul artists when he discovered Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye albums in his parents&#x27; record collection. He said that he owned Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1982 compilation album &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Original Musiquarium I&quot;, which was one of his earliest inspirations as a singer. From there, he discovered &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;, which he has since stated is one of his favorite albums, and today cites Stevie Wonder as a major influence on his singing. He has also cited other jazz players and soul singers John Coltrane, Al Green, Mike Stern, Miles Davis, Otis Redding, Frank Gambale, Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays, and Curtis Mayfield as early influences. He also loves blues music. Additional influences include Guns N&#x27; Roses, U2, AC/DC, Mastodon, and Radiohead.

=== Singing style ===
Kennedy&#x27;s favorite singers include Jeff Buckley, Robert Plant, Bon Scott, Chris Whitley, and k.d. lang. He has stated on several occasions that Jeff Buckley was, and is, a major influence on him as a singer. When asked to describe his vocal style, he said, &quot;I wanted to fuse together my favorite elements of rock and soul singers into something I could call my own. The inflections of Stevie Wonder with the soaring qualities of someone like Buckley.&quot; He states that Buckley&#x27;s &quot;emotional intensity&quot; was one of the most inspirational things for him when it came to singing, and that it made him accept and embrace the fact that he is a tenor. He often performs Buckley&#x27;s famous cover of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (originally by Leonard Cohen) during acoustic performances. At one point, he received lessons from Ron Anderson, a bel canto vocal coach who has worked with a wide range of singers, including Axl Rose, Shania Twain, Enrique Iglesias, Chris Cornell, Ozzy Osbourne, Eddie Vedder, Kelly Clarkson, and several others. When asked about his number one secret when it came to singing, Kennedy replied, &quot;Dig deep into your soul and sing as if your life depends on it. Leave your mark. People react to emotion more than technique.&quot; Kennedy, who possesses a four-octave vocal range, has been praised for his ability as a singer. Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash, whose touring band consists of Kennedy, has called him &quot;fucking amazing&quot;, calling his style &quot;surreal&quot;. About Kennedy&#x27;s ability to recreate Guns N&#x27; Roses songs on tour, Slash said, &quot;Myles is fucking amazing. It&#x27;s very surreal how he handles the stuff he sings. I&#x27;m doing GN&#x27;R songs I&#x27;ve never done solo before, and Myles manages to own them without changing the style or trajectory of the song. Which is a fantastic fucking ability.&quot; Kennedy is often compared to Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell.

=== Guitar playing ===
Kennedy, a former guitar instructor, is also recognized as an accomplished guitarist. He began learning how to play the guitar by listening to Led Zeppelin records and mimicking Jimmy Page&#x27;s guitar parts. He said in an interview, &quot;I started off strictly as a lead guitar player. When I first started playing 25 years ago, that was all I’d do is sit in my room and learn solos.&quot; He also recalled being inspired by Eddie Van Halen: &quot;When I was in my early teens, I heard &#x27;Eruption&#x27; one day and was like, &#x27;That is the most incredible thing I’ve ever heard,&#x27; and I begged my mother to give me an advance on my allowance for the next month and go buy that record.&quot; Over the next few years, and throughout the 1990s, Kennedy played primarily lead guitar. His early work with Cosmic Dust and Citizen Swing featured a jazz-influenced rock flavor, combining several advanced techniques used in jazz. He would later join Alter Bridge primarily as a lead vocalist, but began playing rhythm guitar on the band&#x27;s first tour. Mark Tremonti said, &quot;We knew Myles was an amazing singer, that’s why we hired him. What we found out when we toured the first record was that he’s also an incredibly gifted guitar player and songwriter, as well as a vocalist.&quot;

In an interview with Ultimate Guitar Archive, Tremonti said:
Kennedy played rhythm guitar on &quot;Blackbird&quot; and has since played co-lead on several Alter Bridge tracks. In an article about Kennedy as a guitarist on &quot;Lemon Squeezings&quot;, writer Steve Sauer noted his dexterity and steady rhythm playing. Doug Clark, a writer for &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; and one of Kennedy&#x27;s former guitar students, wrote that &quot;his six-string skills are pyrotechnically brilliant.&quot; Kennedy notes that his job as a guitar player, especially recently with Alter Bridge, is to add texture and colors to the music.

=== Lyrics and themes ===

In addition, Kennedy is the primary lyricist of Alter Bridge and his previous band, The Mayfield Four. His lyrics, which are usually fairly straightforward stylistically, often touch on dark subjects such as death and addiction. On Alter Bridge&#x27;s first two albums (the lyrics of the former were primarily written by Tremonti, however), the lyrics are about &quot;hope and perseverance in the face of adversity.&quot; However, he has been known to write darker lyrics, as heard most notably on Alter Bridge&#x27;s third album, &quot;AB III&quot;, which is a loose concept album based on his own personal struggles with faith and spirituality. Similarly, the lyrical themes of The Mayfield Four&#x27;s second album, &quot;Second Skin&quot;, touch on struggling with love and substance abuse. &quot;Second Skin&quot;, &quot;Apocalyptic Love&quot;, &quot;World on Fire&quot; and &quot;The Ides of March&quot; are the only albums to feature lyrics written by Kennedy that contain profanity.

== Personal life ==
Kennedy currently resides in Spokane, Washington with his wife, Selena, whom he married on June 14, 2003. According to Alter Bridge lead guitarist Mark Tremonti, Kennedy is an atheist, although in an article titled &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; from a November 2010 issue of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, Kennedy said he places himself &quot;somewhere in the middle&quot; between being an atheist and a Christian. In an interview on the &quot;Blairing Out with Eric Blair Show&quot; at the NAMM Show in 2009, Kennedy mentioned that despite being raised in a Christian household, he is not a religious person and he does not believe in any organized religion. In an interview with CraveOnline, he said &quot;I would consider myself a part of the growing segment of people who question authority and scrutinize concepts that no longer seem as logical as they once did. [...] I don&#x27;t find peace in the same concepts that many hold as truth. Believe me, I tried. It&#x27;s not like I didn&#x27;t spend most of my life submersed in the bosom of doctrine or dogma.&quot; In 2014, he identified himself as an agnostic.

Kennedy has been identified as an avid reader and he says that he especially enjoys the work of John Irving, describing Irving&#x27;s &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; as one of his favorite novels. He has also cited &quot;Effortless Mastery&quot; by Kenny Werner as one of his favorites. When asked about his hobbies, he replied: &quot;I guess I have been pretty fortunate since I have turned what was a hobby into a living. Music pretty much consumes me. If I’m not writing, performing or listening I am probably trying to learn more about its history.&quot; He has five tattoos: a dragon on his left forearm, a koi fish on his right forearm, an octopus on his right upper arm, and two elephant heads on his chest. He describes the dragon and the fish as symbols of strength, while the octopus was originally supposed to be a small squid but became much larger than he had intended. He got the dragon tattoo first because of a toy he brought back from Japan as a child, and the koi was added a year later after he learned of an ancient Chinese legend of koi swimming up the Yellow River to become dragons. He has said he wants to get more tattoos in the future.

=== Charity work ===

Kennedy has served on the board of directors for the Mead Food Bank since 2003. In addition, he co-founded the Future Song Foundation, a charity organization &quot;that provides funding to ensure that kids have access to musical instruction and instruments which are fundamental parts of a complete education&quot;, with his wife in 2015. He serves as a director of the program. A proponent of wildlife conservation efforts, Kennedy is a supporter of the International Fund for Animal Welfare and is outspoken of his criticism of the ivory trade on X.

<doc id="1208300" wikidata="Q724089" url="?curid=1208300" title="U. R. Ananthamurthy">
<text>Udupi Rajagopalacharya Ananthamurthy (21 December 1932 – 22 August 2014) was an Indian contemporary writer and critic in the Kannada language. He was born in Thirtahalli Taluk and is considered one of the pioneers of the Navya movement. In 1994, he became the sixth Kannada writer to be honored with the Jnanpith Award, the highest literary honour conferred in India. In 1998, he received the Padma Bhushan award from the Government of India. He was the vice-chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi University in Kerala during the late 1980s. He was one of the finalists of Man Booker International Prize for the year 2013. He remained a fervent critic of nationalistic political parties until his death from kidney failure and cardiac arrest on 22 August 2014.

==Early life==
Ananthamurthy was born into Kannada-speaking Brahmin family in Melige, in Tirthahalli taluk in the Shimoga District. His education started in a traditional Sanskrit school in Doorvasapura and continued in Tirthahalli and Mysore. After receiving a Master of Arts degree from the University of Mysore, U. R. Ananthamurthy taught in the English department at University of Mysore (&quot;pictured&quot;) for a while before embarking to England for further studies on a Commonwealth Scholarship. He earned his doctorate from the University of Birmingham in 1966 for his dissertation thesis entitled &quot;Politics and Fiction in the 1930s&quot;.

==Career==

Ananthamurthy started his career as a professor and instructor in 1970 in English department of University of Mysore. He was the Vice-Chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi University in Kottayam, Kerala from 1987 to 1991. He served as the Chairman of National Book Trust India for the year 1992. In 1993 he was elected as the president of Sahitya Academy. He served as a visiting professor in many Indian and foreign universities including Jawaharlal Nehru University, University of Tübingen, University of Iowa, Tufts University and Shivaji University. Ananthamurthy served twice as the Chairman of the Film and Television Institute of India. In 2012 he was appointed the first Chancellor of Central University of Karnataka. He was also a reason for the establishment of Humanities department of Manipal University. Later in 2012 he served as a visiting faculty at Manipal Centre for Philosophy and Humanities, Manipal University for four months.

Ananthamurthy has participated and delivered lectures in numerous seminars as writer and orator both in and outside the country. He was the member of the committee of Indian writers and visited countries like the Soviet Union, Hungary, France and West Germany in 1990. He visited Moscow in 1989 as board member for a Soviet newspaper. Ananthamurthy was the leader for the committee of writers who visited China in 1993.

==Literary works==

Ananthamurthy&#x27;s works have been translated into several Indian and European languages and have been awarded with important literary prizes. His main works include &quot;Prashne&quot;, &quot;Aakasha Mattu Bekku&quot;, &quot;Samskara&quot;, &quot;Bhava&quot;, &quot;Bharathipura&quot;, and &quot;Avasthe&quot;. He has written numerous short stories as well. Several of his novels and short fictions have been made into movies.

Most of Ananthamurthy&#x27;s literary works deal with psychological aspects of people in different situations, times and circumstances. His writings supposedly analyse aspects ranging from challenges and changes faced by Brahmin families of Karnataka to bureaucrats dealing with politics influencing their work.

Most of his novels are on reaction of individuals to situations that are unusual and artificial. Results of influences of sociopolitical and economic changes on traditional Hindu societies of India and clashes due to such influences – between a father and a son, husband and wife, father and daughter and finally, the fine love that flows beneath all such clashes are portrayed by Ananthamurthy in his works. This is evident in his stories like &quot;Sooryana Kudure (The Sun&#x27;s Horse)&quot;, Mouni (Silent Man)&quot;, &quot;Karthika&quot;, &quot;Ghatashraddha&quot; etc. It does not mean that Ananthamurthy is just clinging to portraying only such somewhat standard subjects of Indian literature of his period. His novelette &quot;Bara (Drought)&quot; portrays the dynamics of a drought-stricken district of Karnataka and the challenges and dilemmas a bureaucrat may face in such situations.

The central figure of the novel &quot;Sooryana Kudure – Venkata &quot; is shunned by his son and wife for his easy-going attitude that does not take him anywhere. Venkata is a non-achiever who could not achieve any material or monetary success in his life. However, he is a simpleton who does not take life&#x27;s suffering to his heart too much. He likes to see life as living in the love of &quot;Amma (or mother-goddess)&quot;. In all sufferings of life, he has the child-like curiosity about the smallest things in life like a &quot;grasshopper (Sooryana Kudure)&quot;. The evening after his son revolts and leaves the house, he would be engrossed in a sight in his yard a grasshopper shining in the sun&#x27;s light.

His several novels were made into films like &quot;Samskara, Bara, Avaste, Mouni, Sookha&quot;, &quot;Ghatashraddha&quot; and &quot;Diksha&quot;.

==Personal life==
U. R. Ananthamurthy met his wife Esther in 1954 and they were married in 1956. They had two children, Sharath and Anuradha. He resided in Bangalore for most of his later life. His son in law Vivek Shanbhag also is a famous writer in Kannada.

==Political career==
U. R. Ananthamurthy made an unsuccessful run for the Lok Sabha in 2004 in which he stated that his prime ideological objective in opting to contest the elections was to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

A Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Prime Minister of India H. D. Deve Gowda had made an offer for Murthy to contest for his party. However, after the Janata Dal (Secular) worked a power sharing agreement with the BJP, Murthy said: 
Ananthamurthy also contested for the Rajya Sabha elections from state assembly in 2006.

The idea proposed by Ananthamurthy to rename ten cities in Karnataka including Bengaluru from their colonial forms to actual native forms was accepted by the Government of Karnataka and the cities were renamed on the occasion of the golden jubilee celebrations of the formation of Karnataka.

==Controversies==
In June 2007, Ananthamurthy declared that he would not take part in literary functions in future in the wake of strong criticism for his reaction on S.L. Bhyrappa&#x27;s controversial novel &quot;Aavarana&quot; that appeared in a section of the media.

In 2013, Murthy&#x27;s statement that there is a reference in the Mahabharata to Brahmin&#x27;s consuming beef drew flak from Hindu religious leaders. Vishwesha Teertha Swami of Pejawar Math commented that there was no reference to Brahmins consuming beef in the conversation between Bhishma and Yudhishtira or anywhere else in the Mahabharata and Murthy&#x27;s statement came as a surprise to him.

A vocal critic of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)/Jan Sangh for over 50 years, Murthy said in 2013 that he would not live in the country ruled by BJP leader Narendra Modi. He later clarified that those remarks were made when he was &quot;overcome by emotion&quot; and said that he had no such plan, though he continued to oppose BJP. Murthy was given special police protection after he began receiving threatening phone calls. Later when Modi became the Prime Minister he was given a free ticket to Pakistan by a group of Modi supporters called &quot;NaMo Brigade&quot;. After Murthy&#x27;s death was announced on 22 August 2014, several BJP and Hindu Jagarana Vedike were booked for celebrating his death by bursting crackers at four places in Mangalore and one spot in Chikkamagaluru.

==Life and career==

Phillips grew up in Madison, Florida. He started out playing in a band called Crosscut at 18. He was a founding member of the band Creed. After Creed dissolved, he joined Alter Bridge in 2004 with fellow then-former Creed members bassist Brian Marshall and lead guitarist Mark Tremonti. He is a self-taught drummer, starting at age 18, and has also played piano and saxophone. Phillips is credited with playing drums and keyboards on Creed&#x27;s 2001 album Weathered, along with 1997&#x27;s My Own Prison and 1999&#x27;s Human Clay. In early 2012, Phillips joined the supergroup Projected with musicians from Sevendust and Submersed.

==Influences==
Phillips cites the following drummers as his influences: Will Calhoun (Living Colour), Matt Cameron (Soundgarden/Pearl Jam), Lars Ulrich (Metallica), John Bonham (Led Zeppelin), Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), Morgan Rose (Sevendust), and Neil Peart (Rush). His favorite bands are Living Colour, Tool, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and Rush. His favorite albums are &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot; (Living Colour), &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; (Pink Floyd), &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; (Led Zeppelin), &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; (Metallica) and &quot;Superunknown&quot; (Soundgarden).

<doc id="1208309" wikidata="Q5875978" url="?curid=1208309" title="Hoddle Street massacre">
<text>The Hoddle Street massacre was a mass shooting that occurred on the evening of Sunday, 9 August 1987, in Hoddle Street, Clifton Hill, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, in Australia. The shootings resulted in the deaths of seven people, and serious injury to 19 others. After a police chase lasting more than 30 minutes, 19-year-old former Australian Army officer cadet Julian Knight was caught in nearby Fitzroy North and arrested for the shootings.

Knight was later sentenced to seven concurrent sentences of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 27 years for what was described by the presiding judge as &quot;one of the bloodiest massacres in Australian history&quot;. The Crown prosecutor, Joe Dickson QC, &quot;did not contend that a minimum term should not be fixed&quot;. Knight was imprisoned in the maximum security Port Phillip Prison in Truganina near Melbourne and was eligible for parole in 2014. Shortly before Knight became eligible for parole, the Victorian Government amended the &quot;Corrections Act 1986&quot; to prevent the parole board from ordering Knight&#x27;s release on parole &quot;unless satisfied, amongst other things, that Mr Knight is in imminent danger of dying or is seriously incapacitated and that, as a result, he no longer has the physical ability to do harm to any person&quot;.

==Background==

Knight&#x27;s father was involved in the military and as a result, Knight moved around frequently as a child. His lifelong dream was to defend Australia in a war. After a troubled high-school life at Westbourne Grammar School, Knight entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory on 13 January 1987 at the age of 18. While a military career had long been a dream, he lacked self-discipline and performed poorly at his studies and only gained good results in weapons expertise exercises. Knight did not like authority and he hated the social hierarchy of the army which allowed people only a few months older than him to boss him around. One night, despite being confined to the base, Knight was involved in a fight and stabbing at a bar after being confronted by a senior. Knight was consequently discharged and sent back to Melbourne 16 days prior to the massacre. Upon returning to Melbourne, Knight found out that his longtime girlfriend would no longer see him and his mother, on whom he had always relied, had turned his childhood bedroom into an extra living room. Furthermore, Knight had no money and no ability or experience to earn a decent wage.

== Events of 9 August 1987 ==
The events of this day were pieced together after investigation by police, along with the help of Knight himself.

===Prelude===

At 11:30 on Sunday 9 August 1987, Knight, woke up in his temporary bedroom in the front room of his mother&#x27;s house at number 6 Ramsden Street, Clifton Hill. Between 13:10 and 16:10 on Sunday 9 August 1987, Knight attended a belated birthday party for his mother at his grandmother&#x27;s house in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. While at the party Knight consumed two cans of beer. He left the party in his own car and drove his younger sister home before driving aimlessly around the Clifton Hill area.

At about 16:50, Knight went to see an old girlfriend in Clifton Hill in order to give her a magazine. He only stayed at her flat for about five minutes then he continued to drive aimlessly around the area. Minutes later the gearbox of his car – his only asset – jammed and stuck in second gear. He limped the car home, where he changed clothes and drank another can of beer before walking angrily around to the nearby Royal Hotel, his local pub, at around 17:30. None of Knight&#x27;s friends were there, so he drank alone from around 17:30. At around 20:50, Knight reportedly began to feel the effects of the beer he&#x27;d been drinking and he had a &quot;vision&quot; of soldiers being ambushed. He felt as if it was a &quot;call to arms&quot;, and at about 20:55 he rushed from the hotel and ran back to his mother&#x27;s house.

===Preparation===
Arriving back at his mother&#x27;s house a few minutes later, he spoke briefly to his sister when she met him in the hallway outside the front room. He then waited until his sister returned to the rear of the house to watch a movie on TV with their mother, before he ventured upstairs to his mother&#x27;s bedroom. Stored under her bed were his legally owned and licensed weapons: a .177 calibre Daisy BB air rifle, a .177 calibre Chinese air rifle, a .177 calibre Crosman model 766 air rifle, a .22 calibre Ruger model 10/22 semi-automatic rifle, a 12-gauge Mossberg pump-action shotgun, and a Chinese-made 7.62mm calibre M14 semi-automatic military rifle. Knight retrieved the Ruger rifle, the Mossberg shotgun and the M14 rifle, then he took the Ruger and the Mossberg back downstairs to the front room. He then returned to his mother&#x27;s room and collected the M14, and a steel ammunition box and a leather shotgun cartridge belt from his mother&#x27;s wardrobe, before returning to the front room to load the three firearms.

After loading the firearms and stuffing his pockets with around 100 rounds of ammunition, including a &quot;suicide&quot; 7.62mm round which he placed in the front right hand pocket of his jeans, he placed a black combat knife down the back of his jeans. He then slung the M14 over his back and picked up the Mossberg and the Ruger in his right and left hands respectively. Immediately afterwards, at around 21:30, he opened the front door of the house and ran out into Ramsden Street. After running west along Ramsden Street and crossing the nearby railway line, Knight reached the eastern side of the main four-lane arterial road known as Hoddle Street.

===Shooting spree===
At 21:30 from the nature strip on the east side of the road, Knight commenced firing on passing cars with the Ruger rifle. The first car that Knight opened fire on contained a married couple, Con and Rita Vitkos. Rita received minor wounds and her husband drove on before stopping at a Mobil service station about 150 metres further south down Hoddle Street. Following the Vitkos&#x27;s was a car containing Michael Anthony and Trevor Smeelie, and a car driven by Gregory Elliott. A bullet struck Elliott&#x27;s vehicle, narrowly missing his head. Both of these cars were damaged, but none of the occupants were wounded. Following Gregory Elliott&#x27;s car was a vehicle driven by Alan Jury and containing Monica Vitelli and Dannielle Mina. Jury and Vitelli were both wounded, and they joined the others at the Mobil service station.

Knight fired rapid bursts at each car, and he reloaded with spare 10-round Ruger magazines as he moved north along the nature-strip towards the nearby Clifton Hill railway station. He ensured that he fired on every south and north-bound vehicle as it passed him. The next car he fired on contained Raewyn Crighton, Bernd Micheel and Dianne Arnold, who all escaped injury. The following car was driven by Sand Wang, who received minor wounds. The next car was driven by Diane Fitzpatrick, who received a serious back wound. The next three cars to be shot at contained Michael Pearce and Jacqueline Langosch, Issac Lohman, and Reginald Dutton and Dana Sabolcki respectively, and they all escaped injury.

At around 21:35, Knight ran out of ammunition for the Ruger, so he dropped it on the nature-strip and commenced firing with the Mossberg shotgun. The loud blasts of the shotgun alerted local residents to the shooting and the first calls were made to the Victoria Police&#x27;s emergency communications centre, D24. The first car to be hit was driven by Sharyn Maunder, who did not receive any injuries and did not realise the front of her car had been hit. The next car to be hit was driven by Vesna Markovska, who received minor wounds, followed by a car driven by her fiancé, Zoran Trajceski, who also received minor wounds. Both Markovska and Trajceski parked their cars by the side of the road and got out to take cover. As they did so, a car driven by Georgina Papaioannou stopped on the opposite side of the street. Knight immediately opened fire on her car, and Papaioannou was slightly wounded. Soon afterwards, a car driven by Jayne Morris, alongside Kay Edwards and Cecilie Corless, drove south through the ambush zone.

By the end of the night, 6 people were shot dead. An additional 19 other people were wounded.

===Police response===
Further south down Hoddle Street they flagged down a police divisional van containing Constables Glen Nichols and Belinda Bourchier, and informed them about the shootings. Nichols and Bourchier immediately drove to the scene with their lights and siren on as they radioed D24. Soon after 21:38, they reached the intersection of Hoddle Street and Ramsden Street where they were shot at by Knight. Knight continued to change position as he fired at a procession of four single-occupant cars which, in chronological order, were driven by Mathew Morrow, Edward McShortall, Trevor Robinson and Keith Wing Shing. McShortall received minor wounds, but Wing Shing, who stopped his car opposite Knight, received serious jaw and throat wounds. Knight continued to reload and change position as he continued to fire at the passing cars.

The next car Knight fired at was a car containing Kevin Skinner, his wife Tracey and their son Adam. Tracey was killed instantly by a bullet to the face and Adam, who was on her lap below the window sill, received minor glass wounds. Following this, a local resident, Peter Curmi, and a friend of his, John Muscat, approached the scene from the western side of the street. Knight fired one shot at them which fatally wounded Muscat in the head and chest, and which seriously wounded Curmi. Immediately after this, the attendant at the nearby swimming pool, Steve Wight, ran to their aid and was seriously wounded by Knight&#x27;s final shotgun blast. It was now 21:39, and numerous police units were rushing to the scene. Knight dropped the empty Mossberg shotgun and took up a prone firing position with his M14 rifle. At this point, Vesna Markovska broke cover from behind her car and made for the footpath on the eastern side of Hoddle Street. As she stepped onto the footpath she was spotted by Knight who fired a shot which seriously wounded her. When she fell back onto the roadway Knight fired two further shots which killed her.

It was now 21:40 and D24 notified the Police Air Wing that one of their Aerospatiale Dauphin police helicopters was needed to assist the police at the scene. Moments later, in a break in the firing, one of the police officers on the western side of Hoddle Street fired a shot at Knight, which missed him by a couple of metres. Immediately following this shot Robert Mitchell, who had driven through the ambush zone unscathed and parked his car further down Hoddle Street, ran up the eastern side of the street in an attempt to render assistance to the fallen Markovska. As he reached her and came to a halt, Knight quickly fired a shot at him which hit him in the right side of the head and killed him instantly.

At 21:41, as three police units took up positions in Mayors Park on the western side of Hoddle Street and other police units took up positions in the surrounding area, Knight opened fire on a car driven by Jacqueline Turner and on Papaioannou as she walked from her car to help Markovska and Mitchell. Turner&#x27;s car was not hit, but Papaioannou was fatally wounded in the left side as she reached Markovska. Following this, Knight fired on a car driven by John Finn who received minor wounds. The next car Knight shot at was driven by Andrew Hack who was seriously wounded in the left side. Following Hack was a car driven by Dusan Flajnik which Knight fired at. Flajnik was hit in the left side and bled to death in his car. At 21:43, Constable Bourchier requested another ambulance from D24 and nominated the Mobil service station as a safe rendezvous point for ambulances as two more police units arrived there.

The next car to be shot at contained Michael Smith and Jacqueline Megens. Smith received minor wounds while Megens was seriously wounded in the shoulder. As they were fired upon the first two ambulances arrived at the scene; one at the Mobil service station and one at Mayors Park. It was now 21:44, and the next car to be shot at was driven by Steven Mihailidis who escaped unscathed. Immediately afterwards Knight fired at the rider of a motorcycle, Kenneth &quot;Shane&quot; Stanton, who was hit in the left leg and fell onto the roadway. As he lay there Knight shot him a further two times and he eventually died. Soon afterwards, at 21:45, a car containing Dimitrios Collyvas, Renata Coldebella, Danny Coldebella and Danny De Luca, followed Stanton down Hoddle Street. Knight, who was by this time beside the southern end of the Clifton Hill railway station buildings, fired a shot at the front of the car. The car stopped and as it reversed back up the street Knight fired two more shots at it before it crashed into a police car, driven by Constable Dominic Cannizzaro, which had just arrived at the scene.

The first shot that Knight had fired into the car had slightly wounded Renata, and the second shot he fired had seriously wounded Danny Coldebella. As Collyvas&#x27;s car was reversing a motorcycle being ridden by Wayne Timms and Jayne Timbury, followed by a car containing Alexandra Stamatopoulos, Steven Stamatopoulos, Irene Fountis, Vicki Fountis and Panagioti Fountis, drove into the ambush zone and stopped opposite Collyvas&#x27;s car. At this point Knight, who was surrounded by at least 40 armed police officers, decided to withdraw from the area and began &quot;hunting&quot; police officers. It was just after 21:45, and he&#x27;d expended 40 rounds of .22 calibre bullets, 25 rounds of 12-gauge buckshot and 32 rounds of 7.62mm calibre bullets in the preceding 15 minutes. Five people lay dead, two were fatally wounded and a further 17 had been wounded. In addition to the expended ammunition, Knight had lost his &quot;suicide&quot; bullet and another 7.62mm bullet as he had moved up the nature-strip. Knight had also lost his knife on the nature-strip. He only had his M14 rifle and 17 rounds of ammunition, having discarded the other two firearms.

===Police chase===

Following his decision to withdraw, Knight turned around and climbed onto the western platform of the Clifton Hill railway station. He ran north along the platform and then continued moving north beside the railway line. He reached a fork in the tracks at around 21:46, and decided to follow the left fork. He spotted a police car in the northern end of Hoddle Street and fired three shots at it. The police car contained Sergeant Graham Larchin and Senior Constable Betty Roberts, who were not injured by the gunfire but who abandoned the car after Knight ceased firing. After firing at Larchin and Roberts&#x27;s police car Knight moved into a nearby cluster of trees, sat down and smoked a cigarette. Minutes later, police Aerospatiale Dauphin helicopter VH-PVA – call sign &quot;Air 495&quot; – arrived over the Clifton Hill area and began searching for Knight with a powerful searchlight. A minute later D24 ordered the Victoria Police&#x27;s elite Special Operations Group (SOG) to attend the scene.

Knight finished his cigarette and continued moving in a north-west direction towards Northcote. He crossed over the Merri Creek, which bordered Clifton Hill and Northcote, and took up a position at the end of a road bridge which spanned the creek. Just before 22:00, he fired a shot at a passing police officer, Constable Colin Chambers, who was slightly wounded in the right side. After shooting Chambers, Knight moved back across Merri Creek into the adjoining suburb of Fitzroy North. The police helicopter had found him in its searchlight and was following him. He ran into a line of trees beside the railway line in an attempt to avoid the searchlight, but at 22:05 broke cover onto the railway line, knelt down and fired three shots at the aircraft as it circled over him. The police helicopter, containing Senior Constable Trevor Wilson, Senior Constable Darryl Jones, Constable Keith Stewart, and Ambulance Officer Alan Scott, was hit by the first shot which pierced its right main fuel tank and forced it to make an emergency landing on a nearby sports field.

===McKean Street and arrest===
Knight continued on into Fitzroy North and headed down McKean Street in an attempt to reach his ex-girlfriend&#x27;s house. It was now 22:13 and Knight was spotted by two police officers, Constable John Delahunty and Constable Ralph Lockman, who gave chase in their police car. As they bore down on him, Knight ducked into a lane-way, turned around and fired his last ten rounds at the police car as it stopped in the middle of the road facing the lane-way. Delahunty, who was driving the police car, received minor shrapnel wounds to the face and left hand as he and Lockman tumbled out of the car with their revolvers drawn. The police car&#x27;s headlights were on high beam facing the entrance to the laneway, which was also lit up by a nearby street light. As Delahunty and Lockman took up positions behind their police car and called upon Knight to surrender, Knight squatted down beside a low brick wall and searched his pockets vainly for his &quot;suicide&quot; bullet. When he realised that he had lost it he leaned out into the headlight beams and dropped the empty M14 on the ground. He then slowly stood up with his hands in the air.

When he was fully upright, Delahunty stepped out from behind the rear of the police car and fired a shot at him. Knight was not hit but he ducked back down behind the low brick wall. As Delahunty and Lockman again called on him to surrender he yelled back &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot! I&#x27;m coming out!&quot; He again rose up with his hands in the air before walking out onto the street where he was arrested by Delahunty and Lockman. Numerous other police officers arrived at the arrest scene, and after a short, initially violent, interrogation (by officers wanting to know where his accomplices were), Knight was driven in an unmarked police car to the St Kilda Road Police Complex by Detective Senior Constable Richard McIntosh, Detective Senior Constable Kim Cox and Constable Robert Kovacs. At the St Kilda Road Police Complex Knight was interrogated extensively by McIntosh and Cox, briefly by the then head of the Homicide Squad, Detective Chief Inspector Brendon Cole, then extensively by Homicide Squad detectives Detective Senior Sergeant Brian McCarthy and Detective Senior Constable Graham Kent. Knight also took part in a night-time crime re-enactment and a daytime crime re-enactment, both of which were videoed, and he was interrogated until he was eventually charged with the murder of John Muscat at 12.20pm on Monday 10 August 1987.

<text>Kota Shivaram Karanth (10 October 1902 – 9 December 1997), also abbreviated as K. Shivaram Karanth, was an Indian author, who was a novelist in Kannada language, playwright and an ecological conservationist. Ramachandra Guha called him the &quot;Rabindranath Tagore of Modern India, who has been one of the finest novelists-activists since independence&quot;. He was the third writer to be decorated with the Jnanpith Award for Kannada, the highest literary honor conferred in India. His son Ullas is an ecological conservationist.

==Early life==
Shivaram Karanth was born on 10 October 1902, in Kota near Kundapura in the Udupi district of Karnataka to a Kannada-speaking Smartha Brahmin family. The fifth child of his parents Shesha Karantha and Lakshmamma, he completed his primary education in Kundapura and Bangalore. Shivaram Karanth was influenced by Gandhi&#x27;s principles and took part in the Indian Independence movement when he was in college. His participation in the Non-cooperation movement did not allow him to complete his college education which he quit in February 1922. He canvassed for khadi and swadeshi in Karnataka led by Indian National Congress leader Karnad Sadashiva Rao, for five years till 1927. By that time, Karanth had already started writing fiction novels and plays.

==Career==
Karanth began writing in 1924 and soon published his first book, &quot;Rashtrageetha Sudhakara&quot;, a collection of poems. His first novel was &quot;Vichitrakoota&quot;. Subsequent works like &quot;Nirbhagya Janma&quot; (&quot;Unfortunate Birth&quot;) and &quot;Sooleya Samsara&quot; (&quot;Family of a Prostitute&quot;) mirrored the pathetic conditions of the poor. His magnum opus &quot;Devaddhootaru&quot;, a satire on contemporary India, was published in 1928.

Karanth was an intellectual and environmentalist who made notable contribution to the art and culture of Karnataka. He is considered one of the most influential novelists in the Kannada language. His novels &quot;Marali Mannige&quot;, &quot;Bettada Jeeva&quot;, &quot;Alida Mele&quot;, &quot;Mookajjiya Kanasugalu&quot;, &quot;Mai Managala Suliyalli&quot;, &quot;Ade OOru Ade Mara&quot;, &quot;Shaneeshwarana Neralinalli&quot;, &quot;Kudiyara Koosu&quot;, &quot;Svapnada Hole&quot;, &quot;Sarsammana Samadhi&quot;, and &quot;Chomana Dudi&quot; are widely read and have received critical acclaim. He wrote two books on Karnataka&#x27;s ancient stage dance-drama &quot;Yakshagana&quot; (1957 and 1975). 

He was involved in experiments in the technique of printing for some years in the 1930s and 1940s and printed his own novels, but incurred financial losses. He was also a painter and was deeply concerned with the issue of nuclear energy and its impact on the environment. At the age of 90, he wrote a book on birds (published during 2002 by Manohara Grantha Mala, Dharwad).

He wrote, apart from his forty-seven novels, thirty-one plays, four short story collections, six books of essays and sketches, thirteen books on art, two volumes of poems, nine encyclopedias, and over one hundred articles on various issues. His &quot;Mookajjiya Kanasugalu&quot; novel won Jnanpith award. 

== Personal life ==
Karanth married Leela Alva, a student in the school that Karanth taught dance and directed plays in. Leela belonged to the Bunt community and was the daughter of a businessman, K. D. Alva. They married on 6 May 1936. The couple subsequently attracted ridicule from people in the region over their inter-caste marriage; Karanth belonged to an orthodox Brahmin community, but had become an atheist after cutting his sacred thread at a young age. Leela, who had her early education in Marathi language, re-learnt Kannada after marriage and translated the Marathi novel &quot;Pan Lakshat Kon Gheto&quot; into Kannada. As a dancer, she participated in Karanth&#x27;s operas. The Karanths had four children together: sons, Harsha and Ullas, a conservationist; and daughters, Malavika and Kshama. His mother&#x27;s influence on Karanth was described by Ullas as: &quot;It was our mother who shaped Karanth&#x27;s life... She was the backbone of all his endeavours. She was also quite well-read, and she dedicated all of her talents to her husband. She took care of all household responsibilities.&quot; The family lived in the Puttur, Karnataka town of Dakshina Kannada, a district in the South Karnataka region, before moving to Saligrama, a town from Karanth&#x27;s birthplace Kota, in 1974. A few years prior to this, their eldest son Harsha died leaving Leela suffer from &quot;depression and hallucinations&quot;. Leela died in September 1986. It was also the year that Karanth&#x27;s final novel was published.

Karanth was admitted to Kasturba Medical College in Manipal on 2 December 1997 to be treated for viral fever. He suffered from a cardiac respiratory arrest two days later and slipped into a coma. On 9 December, his kidneys began to fail and he subsequently developed severe acidosis and sepsis, following which he was put on dialysis. Efforts to revive him failed and he died at 11:35 a.m. (IST) the following day, aged 95. The government of Karnataka declared a two-day mourning in the State as a mark of respect.

==Popularity==
Many of Karanth&#x27;s novels have been translated into other Indian languages. Marali Mannige got translated to English by Padma Ramachandra Sharma, has been conferred the State Sahitya Akademi award.

<text>The Mark 2 family of railway carriages are British Rail&#x27;s second design of carriages. They were built by British Rail workshops (from 1969 British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL)) between 1964 and 1975 and were of steel construction.

==Development and production==

The Mark 2 has a semi-integral construction, giving it more strength than a Mark 1 in the event of an accident. A key driver of the changed construction method was to overcome the serious corrosion problem point in the Mark 1 at the base of the body, where it was attached to the underframe. Other changes of design, such as the window units, were for the same reason, which had become a serious problem in Mark 1 vehicle maintenance costs. Revised painting methods were also part of this, which coincided with the change of livery from maroon (dark green on the Southern) to the blue and grey that Mark 2 coaches wore for much of their lives (some of the earliest Mark 2 coaches had the old livery at first).
The prototype Mark 2, FK 13252, was built in 1963, and is now preserved by and located at the Mid-Norfolk Railway.
The final Mark 2 carriage was departmental 999550, in 1977. it is still in service with Network Rail as a Track Recording Coach. The later versions (2D onwards) look somewhat similar to the later Mark 3 design. The Mark 3 is longer (75 feet as opposed to 64 feet 6 inches), has a large skirting between the bogies to conceal the ancillary equipment, and has a ridged roof as opposed to the smooth roof of the Mark 2. The development of the High Speed Train overlapped with that of the final production run, and the Mark 2F &quot;previewed&quot; many features incorporated into the Mark 3, such as new seating, plastic interior panelling, and floor-sensor-operated automatic gangway doors.

Unlike Mark 1 coaches, built by a wide range of manufacturers, both BR workshops and private builders, all production Mark 2 (and Mark 3) coaches were built on a single assembly line at the BR carriage works at Derby.

=== Multiple units based on the Mark 2 ===
Unlike the many Mark 1 multiple units and the numerous Mark 3 multiple units that followed, few multiple unit classes were based on the Mark 2 bodyshell. Most were electric multiple units with British Railways, and which operated under AC using overhead wires. The first of these were Class AM10 in 1966 operating commuter services from London Euston and in the West Midlands. The introduction of TOPS saw these units reclassified Class 310. The other type was Class 312, a derivative of, and almost identical to, the Class 310, introduced in 1975, primarily used on commuter services from London King&#x27;s Cross and London Liverpool Street, the last slam-door multiple units built for British Railways. Northern Ireland Railways used the Mark 2 bodyshell as the basis for the 80 Class DEMU, which entered service in 1974. Thirteen 5 car electric multiple units were built in 1976 for Taiwan (and withdrawn in 2009): the Taiwan Railway EMU100 series.

==Service==

=== United Kingdom ===
The Mark 2 coach was one of the mainstays of the InterCity network, but new rolling stock introduced in the post-privatisation era has resulted in most being withdrawn.

No catering vehicles were built to Mark 2 design, so all Mark 2 Inter City trains offering catering facilities (including the later air conditioned stock) continued to include Mark 1 restaurant or buffet cars.

Since their withdrawal from most main line duties, Mark 2 coaches have played an increasing role on private rail tours, charter trains, and on heritage railways. Since 1996, over 140 Mark 2 carriages have been exported to New Zealand, where they are still in mainline service (as of 2020).

==== Manchester Pullman ====
Mark 2 carriages were used on the Manchester Pullman service from 1966 until withdrawal in 1985. These luxuriously appointed first class carriages had several unusual features, such as inward opening doors and some interior walnut panelling. Only 29 carriages were built. The livery was pearl grey with blue window surrounds, a reversal of the standard British Rail blue and grey livery of the late 1960s and 1970s. A Liverpool Pullman service was also operated, using the same type of carriages, until 1974.

==== Current ====
As of May 2020, Mark 2 coaches are still in use on some services on the UK rail network.
*Network Rail operate Mark 2s as brake force carriages on its test trains.
*Riviera Trains and West Coast Railways both operate Mark 2s on charters; many of the former&#x27;s are still painted in Anglia Railways and Virgin Trains liveries.

=== Northern Ireland ===

In 1970, NIR purchased new Mark 2Bs for the Enterprise train service between Belfast and Dublin. These were initially painted in an attractive maroon and blue livery and worked by maroon BREL-built Hunslet Bo-Bos of the NIR 101 Class. A pale grey livery with a blue stripe below the windows was introduced in the 1980s. This rake included No. 547, the only Mark 2B dining car. This carriage was restored in 2008 by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI). The Mark 2B carriages were replaced on the Enterprise service by new carriages built in France by De Dietrich Ferroviaire in 1996.

NIR purchased eight British Rail Class 488 electric multiple unit coaches in 2001 that been converted from Mark 2F coaches for the Gatwick Express service from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport. They were renumbered 8941-8948, The worked with NIR Generator Van 8911. They were withdrawn on 19 January 2005, having been replaced by new C3K units. They were reintroduced in September 2006 to provide extra capacity on the Portadown to Belfast (Central) service, making one trip every morning, hauled by a Class 111 locomotive. An ex-Anglia MkIIf DBSO, No. 9712 (renumbered by NIR as 8918), was bought that year to work with the Gatwick stock, but overhaul and regauging took so long that by the time it arrived in Northern Ireland in 2009, the Gatwicks had been withdrawn. Their final passenger run was on 18 June 2009.

The RPSI also acquired some Mark 2s for use in its steam hauled train in Northern Ireland in the early 2000s. These are normally based at the RPSI&#x27;s Whitehead depot, as well as being steam hauled they are also occasionally hired out for diesel hauled railtours. They also have some ex-NIR and ex-CIE Mark 2 stock, some of which formerly operated on the Dublin to Belfast Enterprise service.

The RPSI bought the eight withdrawn Gatwick Express Mark 2 coaches and generator van from NIR, which are currently (2017) in store at Dundalk and Whitehead. They will be used to augment and to replace some of the RPSI&#x27;s current Mark 2 fleet that work out of Whitehead. The DBSO entered preservation at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway on 27 September 2014, having never carried a passenger in NIR service or having left York Road depot by rail.

=== Republic of Ireland ===

In 1972, CIÉ placed an order with BREL for 72 coaches based on the Mark 2D. With air conditioning as a principal feature they became known as &quot;AC Stock&quot; and ran on type B4 bogies, with vacuum brakes.
The order consisted of six First Class coaches (5101–5106), nine Composites (5151–5159), 36 Standard Class (5201–5236), eleven Restaurant/Buffet Standard Class (5401–5411) and eleven Generator Vans (5601–5611). Internal fit-out was done in Inchicore, and was quite different from the original BR design, using bench seating rather than individual seats and with extensive use of wood veneer panelling.

Their electrical system differed from the BR and NIR versions. The generator van contained two engine/generator sets, each supplying 220/380 V 50 Hz AC to two separate electrical buses in the train. The air conditioning loads were divided in half, each half fed from a separate bus. In the case of failure of one generator set, the other set automatically supplies both buses. Air conditioning output power would then be halved, but all other loads including cooking, lighting and battery charging would continue to be supplied. This later remained the model for the electrical power supply on all subsequent IE coaches.

To accommodate changes in traffic, five of the Composites (5153–5156, 5158) were re-classed as Standards, and Restaurant/Buffet Standard 5408 was converted for use as the Presidential Coach.

Iarnród Éireann purchased fifteen carriages from a UK scrap dealer during 1989, in exchange for a similar number of scrap diesel locomotives. Older Mark 2A/B/C carriages were scrapped in 2004, as they were heavily corroded. A few were preserved (minus bogies) at certain heritage railways in Ireland.

The remaining Mark 2 carriages (the 1972 vintage Mark 2D sets) were phased out during 2007 and 2008, with the last set operating its final service, the 0505 Athlone–Heuston, on 31 March 2008. Two of these coaches, 5106 and 5203, were preserved by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland. The Presidential Coach, 5408, has also been preserved by the RPSI.

===New Zealand===
150 refurbished former Mark 2D, 2E, and 2F First Open and Tourist Standard Open carriages are operated on New Zealand railway lines. The first 16 were exported in January 1997. Although New Zealand railway lines have a narrower track gauge of , the country has a similar loading gauge, allowing regauged BR carriages to run on most lines. The first carriages were imported in 1996 by then rail operator Tranz Rail and heritage operator Mainline Steam. The first seven refurbished carriages entered regular service on 15 November 1999, on the Capital Connection service between Palmerston North and Wellington.

Until 2015, the former British Rail carriages ran virtually all carriage regional commuter services. Most of them (104) operated in Auckland, classified SA (81) and SD (23), in push-pull commuter trains, with three to five SA carriages, an SD driving carriage (similar to the original Mark 2 DBSOs), and a DC class (four- and five-car) or DFT class (six-car) diesel-electric locomotive. Auckland has since replaced its entire suburban fleet with the purpose-built New Zealand AM class electric multiple unit. Other BR Mark 2 carriages operate on the Capital Connection (8× S class), and the Wairarapa Connection between Masterton and Wellington (18× SW class). There are also six SE class carriages, which were used with electric locomotives on Wellington commuter services between 2008 and 2011 as a temporary measure until new EMUs were delivered. The carriages were reassigned to the Wairarapa Connection in June 2013, where peak service patronage was starting to exceed the capacity of the SW carriage fleet. Mainline Steam also own four refurbished carriages, classified ML, which are based in Plimmerton (north of Wellington) and are used for its steam-hauled excursions.

All New Zealand Mark 2 carriages retain their original BR running numbers.

===Taiwan===

Following a decision to electrify Taiwan&#x27;s busy West Coast Main Line, thirteen 5-car electric multiple units based on the Mark 2 design were built by BREL in York for the Taiwan Railway Administration in 1976, but following problems with the electrical equipment and excessive weight could not enter service until 1979 following the completion of remedial works. They used GEC electrical equipment and were built for track gauge. They were used on the Tze-Chiang Limited Express service. They were withdrawn from service in 2009.

===Kenya===
Carriages based on the Mark 2 design were built by BREL for the Kenya Railways Corporation in the late 1970s.

==Models==
===OO gauge===
Over the years, the British Railways Mark 2 design has been manufactured by many of the British model railway manufacturers.

Hornby Railways introduced Mk. 2 BFK and TSO models in the late 1960s and these have remained in production intermittently ever since, sometimes being used to represent coaches of later variants (such as the Mk.2 B BFK in the Royal Train). Hornby announced in 2013 that it would produce the Mk2E variant for its 2014 range. These are re-tooled versions and will be available in both their main range and their RailRoad range. Some from the main range will have interior lighting. Hornby are making three versions of the Mk2E i.e. FO, TSO and BSO.

Airfix introduced Mk. 2D BSO, FO and TSO models in the late 1970s, these later being produced by its successors Mainline, Dapol and ultimately Hornby. The Airfix Mk. 2D was a high quality model for its day, being more accurately detailed than most contemporary products, and it is still being produced by Hornby.

Lima produced Mk. 2B BFK, FK and TSO and Mk. 2E FO and TSO models. These were approximately 1 cm under scale length, and have not been produced since Lima was taken over by Hornby.

Bachmann Branchline introduced Mk. 2 and Mk. 2A BFK, BSO, FK and TSO models in the early 2000s, which were more detailed than the various older models. Bachmann have also announced new Mk. 2F BSO, DBSO, FO, RFB and TSO models for production in 2013–14.

A range of Mk. 2Bs covering both the BR and NIR variants was announced by Irish Railway Models and its British-outline arm Accurascale in late 2021. These will cover all variants. The BR versions under the Accurascale brand will be available individually, whilst the NIR versions under the Irish Railway Models brand will be available in 3-car packs.

===N gauge===
Graham Farish produce Mk.2F BSO, FO, RFB and TSO models and have announced upgraded models including a DBSO for 2013–14. Mk.2A BSO, FK and TSO models were announced in 2012–13.

<text>The British Rail Mark 3 is a type of passenger carriage developed in response to growing competition from airlines and the car in the 1970s. A variant of the Mark 3 became the rolling stock for the High Speed Train (HST).

Originally conceived as locomotive-hauled coaching stock, the first coaches built were for the prototype HST in 1972. Production coaches entered service between 1975 and 1988, and multiple-unit designs based on the Mark 3 bodyshell continued to be built until the early 1990s. Most of the surviving fleet of the Mark 3 and its derivatives were still in revenue service on the British railway network in 2020, however, as of 7 April 2021, 300 carriages have been sent for scrap.

==Introduction==
Under the chairmanship of Stanley Raymond, it was decided to reduce journey times further on long-distance trains by increasing line speed to , where practical – the maximum considered possible on Britain&#x27;s Victorian-age railways. At the end of 1968, proposals were submitted to the Commercial and Operating Departments of British Rail for a new fleet of third-generation standard coaching stock, designed to run at 125 mph.

The rapid development required for the HST in 1969 made the Mark 3 coach design the obvious choice for that train and, in 1972, the first ten Mark 3 coaches were built for the prototype HST.

==Construction==

The Mark 3 looks similar to Mark 2D, 2E and 2F coaches, but is of a completely different design. It has a ridged roof and under-frame skirt, compared with a smooth roof and visible below-frame equipment on the Mark 2.

The bodyshell is long, almost longer than the Mark 2, of full monocoque construction with an all-welded mild steel stressed skin, and has a reputation for its exceptional strength and crashworthiness. An important advance over its predecessor was the adoption of secondary air suspension between the body and the bogies, giving an exceptionally smooth ride. The bogies, classified BT10 (BT5 on the prototype vehicles), were designed specifically for the Mark 3 and have coil-spring primary suspension with hydraulic dampers, enabling a maximum speed of – the Mark 2 is limited to . Disc brakes in place of the Mark 2 clasp brakes completed the engineering package enabling – in conjunction with wheel slip protection (WSP) – efficient deceleration from 125 mph and almost silent brake operation.

Ancillaries, such as electrical and air-conditioning systems, were grouped together in discrete modules housed behind an aerodynamic skirting between the bogies; on the Mark 2, these were mounted above and below the passenger seating area. The lighting and air-conditioning fittings were for the first time integrated into the ceiling panels. Other new features were the pneumatically operated automatic gangway doors triggered by pressure pads under the floor. From 1993, after fatal falls from moving trains, a central door-locking system operated by the train guard was installed to protect the passenger operated slam doors.

The main difference between the HST vehicles and the loco-hauled Mark 3A relates to electrical supply arrangements. HST coaches take an industrial voltage/frequency 3-phase supply directly from an auxiliary alternator in the power car to supply on-board equipment such as air conditioning; loco-hauled vehicles take a standard 1000 V DC or single-phase AC train heat supply from the locomotive and convert it through motor generator units under the floor. These convert the train supply to 3-phase 415/240 V 50 Hz AC to power air conditioning and other ancillaries. The two types are non-interconnectable in service conditions. The other main difference is the lack of buffers on HST coaches.

The later Mark 3B build provided first class loco-hauled vehicles for the West Coast Main Line. These are similar to Mark 3As, but have an improved motor alternator unit with compound-wound motor and seating derived from the Advanced Passenger Train (APT).

==Prototype==
Ten coaches were constructed to run between a pair of Class 41 power cars as the prototype HST, exploring different seating and layout options for first and standard class passengers, and evaluating different designs of catering facilities. In 1973 the prototype HST was evaluated as an 8-coach formation. The two spare coaches, 2903 and 2904, were rebuilt and redeployed in the Royal Train, where they remain.

==Development==
Initial plans for a large fleet for almost all InterCity services were amended prior to construction to provide stock for the planned HST fleet, resulting in a much smaller fleet of loco-hauled coaches for the West Coast Main Line. A much reduced number of coaches were manufactured, requiring many Mark 2D, 2E and 2F coaches to remain in service.

The table below lists manufacturing variants as built, showing the quantity of each type/designation and original running numbers.

See British Rail coach type codes for the meaning of RSB, TRUK, BFO etc.

==Usage==
Since 1977, the Royal Train has included some specially equipped Mark 3 coaches.

Mark 3s remain in service as part of HSTs with Great Western Railway and ScotRail much as they have since introduced. These were refurbished when their operators were privatised, with all except East Midlands Trains&#x27; receiving new seats between 2006 and 2009.

The introduction by Virgin CrossCountry of 220/221 &quot;Voyagers&quot; in the early 2000s rendered many Mark 3s surplus. After periods of storage, all have now returned to service with other operators.

The introduction by Virgin Trains of Class 390 &quot;Pendolinos&quot; in the early 2000s resulted in the withdrawal of the locomotive hauled Mark 3s. Some were cascaded to One to replace Mark 2s on the Great Eastern Main Line, while a few replaced Mark 2s on the &quot;Night Riviera&quot;. Most were placed in store at Long Marston. Many have since been returned to service, both as locomotive hauled coaches with Arriva Trains Wales, Chiltern Railways as well as being converted for use with HSTs by Grand Central and CrossCountry. This required modifications to the coupling mechanisms and electrical systems to make them compatible with Class 43 power cars.

Mark 3 sleeping cars are used on the &quot;Night Riviera&quot; services.

Virgin Trains retained one complete Mark 3 set. It was initially used to cover peak-time London Euston to Birmingham services while the Pendolinos underwent modifications, but later covering the loss of 390033, written off after the Grayrigg derailment in 2007. In July 2009, it was refurbished and repainted at Doncaster Works in the same style as the Pendolino and Voyager fleets, but with the British Rail seats and interior fittings retained. This set was nicknamed the &quot;Pretendolino&quot; by enthusiasts. It was transferred to Abellio Greater Anglia in November 2014. In 2016 it moved to TransPennine Express to be used as a crew trainer in the lead-up to the introduction of Mark 5As.

===Sewage discharge===
Legally in the UK, train operators are allowed to discharge up to 25 litres of untreated waste at a time on to the track and the discharge from each toilet flush is considerably less than this. Most Mark 3 carriages have no retention tanks, discharging onto the track via a U-bend/pipe near the bogies, and in the 2000s both the RMT trade union and politicians were concerned at the environmental impact of this legacy issue. The problem was first raised in 2003 after Railtrack staff at abandoned local clean-up and then track maintenance procedures due to an excessive build-up of sewage waste in the area. In 2006 the RMT agreed waste tank and clean-out developments at Northern Rail&#x27;s Heaton TMD in 2006 with GNER, and new clean-out procedures at all other depots, to solve an ongoing dispute over the previous 18 months.

By 2011, the European Union had begun a formal investigation to see whether trains composed of such carriages were breaking EU environmental and health laws, although the Environment Agency confirmed that train companies claimed special exemptions to dump waste on the track. In 2013, Transport Minister Susan Kramer branded the practice &quot;utterly disgusting&quot; and called on the industry to take action. ATOC responded by stating that, as all new vehicles had to be fitted with compliant toilet tanks, withdrawal of the HSTs by the end of 2017 would solve the problem. The use of HSTs without retention tanks continued after the end of 2017, but sets being transferred to ScotRail and shortened HST sets retained by GWR are being fitted with retention tanks. ScotRail operated brown waste discharging sets until the COVID-19 pandemic facilitated cuts to service in April 2020.

==Train formations==
===HST vehicles===
====Original formation====

The original coaches were delivered in HST sets for Western Region (Class 253) with Trailer First (TF), Trailer Restaurant Unclassified Kitchen (TRUK), Trailer Second (TS), and Trailer Buffet Second (TRSB) cars in the formation TF-TF-TRUK-TS-TRSB-TS-TS. Complaints from guards about engine noise in the guards&#x27; compartments in the power cars led to the Trailer Guard Second (TGS) in 1980, based on the TS but with the end vestibule and one seating bay replaced by a guard&#x27;s compartment. This replaced the last TS in all sets from 1980 onwards. Sets delivered for Eastern and Scottish Regions (Class 254) contained eight coaches, originally in the formation TF-TF-TRUK-TS-TS-TRSB-TS-TS. 

The TRUK cars were quickly replaced by a TS on the Western Region and most had been replaced on the Eastern Region by 1985 (many later rebuilt into loco-hauled buffet cars). TRUB cars (Trailer Restaurant Unclassified Buffet) were built from 1978 to replace the TRUK cars, these were reclassified as TRFB (Trailer Restaurant First Buffet) from 1985 on the Eastern and London Midland Regions and from 1989/90 on the Western Region. The original interiors were fitted out fully carpeted with InterCity 70 seats. First Class had orange and red stripes on both carpet and seating, whilst Standard Class had a blue and green scheme. From May 1987 onwards, both HST and Mark 3 loco hauled sets were repainted and refurbished into the Intercity swallow livery.

====Previous formations====
Virgin CrossCountry proposed operating HST sets in shortened 2 power car and 5 trailer formations to be known as Challenger sets painted in the silver and red livery. This would give the trains better acceleration, similar to the Voyager units. Approval was not granted for this however. Cross Country previously ran 7 coach HST sets (with 2 Powercars) until 2023 when they were withdrawn from service.

====Current formations====
Following the May 2019 timetable change, GWR now run exclusively &quot;Castle&quot; sets formed of 4 coaches and 2 power cars. ScotRail have operated 4 coach sets with 2 power cars, on Scottish InterCity routes since 2018. Most ScotRail sets will be extended to 5 coaches.

===Hauled stock===
Mark 3A coaches were deployed on West Coast Main Line expresses out of Euston to bring the three main long-distance routes from London up to the same standard. Initial variants were Second Open (TSO) and First Open (FO). Catering and sleeper vehicles continued to be Mark 1 stock until the introduction of Restaurant Buffet (RUB) vehicles in 1979-80 and the sleeper (SLEP) vehicles in 1981–82. In 1988 the process was completed with the elimination of Mk 1 parcels vehicles and their replacement by Mk 3-derived Driving Van Trailers, making the WCML push-pull.

Scottish Region push-pull services were initially made up of four TSO and one FO Mark 3A coaches with a Mark 2F DBSO. The FO was later converted to a Composite Open (CO) by the declassification of half a coach and installation of a partition between the two classes and an SO was removed. These vehicles were removed from the Scottish regional routes in 1989 when they were replaced with Class 158 multiple units.

Chiltern Railways employs several rakes of Mark 3 carriages, hauled by Class 68 locomotives in push-pull configuration with Mark 3 Driving Van Trailers. These Mark 3 carriages have been extensively refurbished and modernised with the following enhancements:
* Application of new Chiltern Railways Silver Mainline livery based on the former, defunct Wrexham and Shropshire livery of two tone silver
* Automatic plug doors in place of the original slam doors (except for the two doors adjacent to the buffet car counter, which are no longer for public use)
* Large doorway vestibule areas
* Installation of economical controlled emission toilets with retention tanks
* Retrimmed carpets in new trim
* Retrimmed seats in new trim
* New dado side panels and repainted wall end coverings
* Power sockets at each seat
* Improved ceiling mounted LED interior saloon lighting diffusers
The Driving Van Trailers have been modified with diesel generators to provide Electric Train Supply to the coaches when the locomotive is not running, such as when in terminus stations and when stabled.

Greater Anglia previously operated the Mark 3 carriages hauled by Class 90 locomotives in push-pull configuration with Mark 3 Driving Van Trailers on the West Anglia Main Line. In 2014, Greater Anglia refurbished their Mark 3 carriages; these carriages were refurbished with the following enhancements:

* Application of new Greater Anglia livery – a white bodyside with black window surrounds and red highlighted doors
* Installation of economical controlled emission toilets with retention tanks
* Retrimmed carpets in new trim
* Retrimmed seats in new trim
* New dado side panels and repainted wall end coverings
* An increase in Standard Class seating capacity by adding another eight seats to each TSO carriage, thus creating 80 seats per a TSO vehicle
* Removing the kitchen equipment and 24 First Class seats in the former Restaurant Car vehicles, replacing them with 54 Standard Class seats
* Power sockets at each seat
* Improved ceiling mounted LED interior saloon lighting diffusers

The coaches typically had 74 or 76 seats (80 seats on InterCity Anglia) in Standard Class with a 2+2 layout or 46 to 48 seats in First Class with a 2+1 layout. Abellio Greater Anglia used a mix of eight, nine and ten coaches in their sets up until their retirement in 2020

==Manchester Pullman==

Mark 3 carriages were used on the Manchester Pullman from May 1985, with a batch of Mark 3b carriages being built at Derby as Intercity Pullman cars, some named. This was part of a revival of the Pullman brand by InterCity, with Merseyside and Yorkshire services being launched on the same day.

==Entertainment carriages==
In 2009 First Great Western introduced &#x27;entertainment carriages&#x27; with at-seat television screens known as Volo TV. The system, which FGW claimed was a &quot;world first&quot;, was fitted to Coach D in Standard Class. The service, originally charged for, eventually became free, although users either had to provide their own headphones (standard 3.5mm stereo mini-jack plug) or purchase a pair from the on-board Express Cafe for £1.50.

In addition to radio and video feeds, a GPS train-location screen allowed passengers to check and track train progress. For this purpose an aerial had been fitted to the roof of these coaches. With the advent of portable media devices and tablet computers, the Volo TV service was discontinued in 2014.

==Sleeping carriages==
In 1979, British Rail ordered 236 Mark 3 SLEP sleeper carriages. Because of cost overruns partly caused by more stringent regulations in the wake of the Taunton sleeping car fire the order was cut back to 207. However even this was too many, as by the time they were delivered British Rail were withdrawing sleeper services.

In 1987, ten were leased to Danish State Railways while in 1994, three were sold to Swiss bogie manufacturer Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft for tilt train testing. In 1995 Porterbrook experimentally converted one to a day carriage. GNER purchased 13 with the intention of converting to High Speed Train carriages, but the project was aborted.

Five were converted to generator vans for the aborted &quot;Nightstar&quot; service. One of these was purchased by UK Rail Leasing for use as a carriage heater at its Leicester depot in 2016. English Welsh &amp; Scottish investigated converting Mark 3s for use on high speed freight trains.

==Future==

Many of the Mark 3s were scheduled to be withdrawn by 2020. Great Western Railway and London North Eastern Railway sets were replaced by Class 800, 801 and 802 sets.

The East Midlands Railway Mark 3s were withdrawn in May 2021. Former Great Western Railway Mark 3s were leased to ScotRail from 2018 for use on Edinburgh/Glasgow to Aberdeen/Inverness and Aberdeen to Inverness, routes. Great Western began trials of shortened HST sets with new power-operated external doors in 2018, and intend to run 11 of these &#x27;Castle&#x27; sets on local services on the main lines.

The Caledonian Sleeper Mark 3 sleeper sets were withdrawn in October 2019.
Grand Central then withdrew their Mark 3s in 2017. These were transferred to East Midlands Trains.

Great Western Railway and London North Eastern Railway withdrew its Mark 3 sets in 2019, with GWR reforming many Mark 3 sets as 4 car refurbished &quot;Castle&quot; sets.

Greater Anglia withdrew its Mark 3 sets in March 2020.

==Preservation==
Some former Mark 3 sleeping carriages were sold to railway preservation organisations for use as volunteer staff accommodation vehicles, and a range of additional vehicles have been preserved at a number of heritage railways, including HST vehicles. Others have been acquired for charter work on the main line.

A Buffet Mark 3 has been preserved at the National Railway Museum site in Shildon since March 2020.

==Multiple units based on the Mark 3==

The Mark 3 design proved to be highly adaptable and formed the basis of BR&#x27;s &quot;Second Generation&quot; multiple unit fleet, introduced from the early 1980s, with the following classes having Mark-3-based bodyshells:

*DMU Classes
**Class 150
**Class 210
*AC EMU Classes
**Class 317
**Class 318
**Class 319
**Class 320
**Class 321
**Class 322
**Class 325
*DC EMU Classes
**Class 442
**Class 455
**Class 456
*Bi-mode EDMU Classes 
**Class 768
**Class 769
**Class 799

The cars for Classes 150, 210, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 325, 455 and 456 units are built to a shorter 20 m &#x27;suburban&#x27; design. Those for Class 442 are 23 m and are very similar to the Mark 3 coach. The main visual difference is the swing plug automatic doors rather than the traditional manual &quot;slam-doors&quot;.

The Class 153 and Class 155, while of the &quot;Sprinter family&quot;, are built by British Leyland and have no connection with the Mark 3, neither does the Class 156, built by Metro-Cammell.

The final batch of &quot;Sprinters&quot; of Class 158 (some rebuilt as Class 159) are of a different design built from aluminium extrusions. Its design being intermediate between that of the Mark 3 and the Networker (train).

Nine 450 Class DMUs were built at Derby Litchurch Lane Works for Northern Ireland Railways using Mark 3 bodyshells and Mark 1 underframes, together with refurbished power units and traction motors, recovered from the former Class 70 units.

The last Mark-3-based EMUs built are the Class 325 EMUs built for Royal Mail in 1995.

==Mark 3 coaches overseas==

===Ireland===


The Republic of Ireland&#x27;s national rail operator, Iarnród Éireann, ordered Mark 3 carriages built between 1980 and 1989, with bogies for the Irish gauge of 1600 mm (5 ft 3 in). The fleet consisted of 124 Mark 3 and nine Mark 3A Internationals, which worked only the Dublin–Galway service, branded &quot;&quot; or &quot;Hound of the Seas&quot; as it was a coast-to-coast route.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s they were the backbone of the Irish InterCity rolling stock.

They were built with automatic plug doors, which initially caused some concern as additional time and resources were required to perfect them. The design was later used on the Class 442 &quot;Wessex Electrics&quot;. Most of the fleet was air-conditioned, except for a small number of coaches built as outer-suburban stock, which ran in push-pull configuration. A number of coaches were first class, and there were several dining cars and five driving van trailers (DVTs) that included passenger seating. There were also a number of accompanying generator vans to supply power.

In 2006–07, Irish Mark 4 carriages were introduced on the Dublin-Cork route, with the Mark 3 coaches displaced to other InterCity routes.

In 2008, Iarnród Éireann began taking delivery of 22000 Class railcars, which led to withdrawal of all Mark 3 coaches. The type&#x27;s final service was a Dublin-Cork relief train on 21 September 2009.

Efforts were made to sell the 130 carriages but some were still stored in various locations. During 2015 some carriages were refurbished for use on the &quot;Grand Hibernian&quot; luxury train, which began operating on 30 August 2016 and ceased operating in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic - however, the final cancellation was announced only in 2021. A year later the carriages were transported from Ireland, and in the upcoming time redesigned as Belmond&#x27;s new luxury train &quot;Britannic Explorer&quot;, which is scheduled to run from July 2025.

Between 2013 and 2014, most of the Iarnród Éireann Mark 3s were scrapped at Waterford, Dundalk, and Adelaide Depot in Belfast.

===Denmark===
In 1987, ten sleepers were leased to Danish State Railways. They returned in November 1998 and placed in store at MoD Kineton.

===Switzerland===
In 1994, three sleepers were sold to Swiss bogie manufacturer Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft for tilt train testing.

<text>The British Rail Mark 4 is a class of passenger carriages built for use in InterCity 225 sets on the East Coast Main Line between King&#x27;s Cross, Leeds and Edinburgh. Withdrawals began in 2019, with some being sold for further use with Transport for Wales between Cardiff and Holyhead.

==History and construction==

A small build compared with the Mark 2 and Mark 3 designs, 314 Mark 4 coaches were built between 1989 and 1992 by Metro-Cammell&#x27;s Washwood Heath factory to operate services on the newly electrified East Coast Main Line. They were operated by London North Eastern Railway and its predecessors in 30 fixed formations of nine carriages, with a Class 91 locomotive and Driving Van Trailer.

The Mark 4 is an all-steel coach incorporating a number of improvements over the Mark 3 stock - notably the inclusion of automatic push-button operated plug-type doors, in place of manually operated slam-doors, fully sealed gangways and controlled emission toilets (CET). Body shells were built by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) and Società Italiana Ernesto Breda.

After a period of evaluation in 1988, Swiss SIG type BT41A bogies were selected rather than BREL Type T4 bogies when BREL could not provide commercial guarantees on the demanding lateral ride comfort required for running (BT41B/C refer to the bogie types used on the Mk4 DVT).

However, during the first year of operation in 1989, complaints were made about the &quot;lively&quot; ride of the coaches. This required modifications to the damper and spring rates of the bogies and the fitting of inter-coach &quot;car coupler dampers&quot; to improve damping between the vehicles. Disabled access was another priority of the design, so the door vestibules were enlarged to allow a larger turning circle for a wheelchair. With continually increasing levels of overcrowding, the &#x27;gangway passenger&#x27; had become an important consideration, so the vestibule environment was improved with carpeted walls, better lighting, sealed gangways, and carriage doors plus four flip-down seats per vestibule (since removed and replaced with bench style perch seats).

Many of these innovations came from the abandoned Advanced Passenger Train, upon which the Mark 4 was heavily based. This influence was most obvious with the profiled sides, intended to allow the retrofitting of tilt-equipped bogies derived from the APT. This would have allowed up to 6° of tilt; modified coaches would have been designated &quot;Mark 4 T&quot;, but this plan was abandoned in January 1986. The business case for the Mark 4 also anticipated their operation on the West Coast Main Line as a follow-on order after the East Coast Main Line electrification, but after the failure of the InterCity 250 project to gain Treasury support, British Rail ordered a small number of Class 90 locomotives to supplement existing locomotives on the West Coast Main Line.

The Mark 4 has gained widespread praise for its exceptional crashworthiness, something that was proven in the Hatfield and Selby crashes, where experts identified the integral construction of the vehicles as being a key factor in restricting the death toll.

The Class 158 and Class 159 diesel multiple units, although superficially similar, are not based on the Mark 4 bodyshell; the Mark 4 is derived from the Class 156.

The Iarnród Éireann Mark 4 push-pull carriages, introduced on the Irish railway system in mid-2006, are of a different design; they were manufactured by the Spanish manufacturer CAF.

The Mark 4 was the first British Rail vehicle not to use Rail Alphabet typeface for interior signage and operating notices.

Via Rail Canada&#x27;s Renaissance fleet of inter-city and sleeper coaches are derived from British Rail&#x27;s Mark 4. They were built for the abortive &quot;Nightstar&quot; services to Europe and were adapted by Bombardier Transportation to meet Canadian requirements.

==Project Mallard==
Between October 2003 and November 2005, Bombardier Transportation, under contract from GNER, rebuilt and refurbished the carriages under &quot;Project Mallard&quot;. Trains with rebuilt coaches became known as &quot;Mallard&quot;s to distinguish them from unrefurbished sets during the upgrade programme, named after the steam locomotive &quot;Mallard&quot;, built in the 1930s by the London and North Eastern Railway and holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives.

The Mallard refit gave the coaches all-new interiors with new seats, carpeting and power points at every seat. The vestibule areas lost their flip-down seats near the entrances, with perch-type seats being put in their place. The buffet coach was turned around with first class seating converted to standard. Wheelchair-width doors were fitted and the seating capacity was increased by fitting airline-style seats in place of the previous groupings of pairs of seats facing each other across a table.

Additionally, GNER introduced WiFi internet connectivity as a trial from December 2003 and then into service from April 2004, making it the first service of its kind in the United Kingdom. Prior to National Express East Coast (NXEC) taking over the franchise in December 2007, WiFi was free in first class and chargeable in standard class; under the new NXEC franchise access, it became free for all passengers. In October 2010, under East Coast operation, charges for standard class passengers were reintroduced.

All coaches were revinyled in East Coast livery with the last completed in April 2013. They were revinyled in Virgin Trains East Coast livery in 2015. In February 2016, a refurbishment programme called &quot;Plush Tush&quot; commenced with new seat covers, carpets and purple mood lighting in First Class.

==Future==
The Mark 4s were largely replaced on the East Coast Main Line by Class 801s in 2019/20.
Virgin Trains East Coast were to retain seven or eight nine-carriage sets to operate extra services to Edinburgh. Virgin Trains East Coasts&#x27; successor LNER later stated this plan had been cancelled. In September 2020, Eversholt Rail Group and London North Eastern Railway extended their lease to 10 by 2023. In addition, there are options to make it operational until 2024. It will be overhauled by Wabtec at Doncaster Works.

Grand Central planned to use on Mark 4 coaches (5x5 coaches + DVT sets) on their London Euston to Blackpool North services; however, these services were abandoned on 10 September 2020, due to the impact of COVID-19 on passenger numbers.

Twelve Mark 4 carriages were refurbished for use by Transport for Wales on an expanded Holyhead to Cardiff &quot;Premier Service&quot; from June 2021. 

In 2021, Transport for Wales purchased these carriages from Eversholt Rail Group along with the carriages that had been refurbished for use by Grand Central; this brought its fleet to 37.

Grand Union proposed to operate Mark 4s on its London Paddington to Cardiff Central services. This plan was scrapped in favour of using newly procured Class 802 bi-mode units from Hitachi, though this never materialised as the Department for Transport ruled against Grand Union&#x27;s proposal. Grand Union have also proposed to use them on other services along the West Coast Mainline from London Euston to Stirling, replacing the Class 91 locomotives with brand new Class 93 &#x27;Euro-Dual&#x27; tri-mode locomotives for use on non-electrified lines. This plan has not yet been confirmed, but will hopefully go ahead in future. As a supplement, Grand Union has stated on their official website that they will be leased Class 22x units (Class 220, 221, 222) from EMR and Avanti West Coast (Arriva CrossCountry will not be leasing their units). In September 2024, the plan was completely scrapped after Grand Union was bought out by FirstGroup.

<text>The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is a computer vision algorithm to detect, describe, and match local &quot;features&quot; in images, invented by David Lowe in 1999. Applications include object recognition, robotic mapping and navigation, image stitching, 3D modeling, gesture recognition, video tracking, individual identification of wildlife and match moving.

SIFT keypoints of objects are first extracted from a set of reference images and stored in a database. An object is recognized in a new image by individually comparing each feature from the new image to this database and finding candidate matching features based on Euclidean distance of their feature vectors. From the full set of matches, subsets of keypoints that agree on the object and its location, scale, and orientation in the new image are identified to filter out good matches. The determination of consistent clusters is performed rapidly by using an efficient hash table implementation of the generalised Hough transform. Each cluster of 3 or more features that agree on an object and its pose is then subject to further detailed model verification and subsequently outliers are discarded. Finally the probability that a particular set of features indicates the presence of an object is computed, given the accuracy of fit and number of probable false matches. Object matches that pass all these tests can be identified as correct with high confidence.

Although the SIFT algorithm was previously protected by a patent, its patent expired in 2020.

== Overview ==
For any object in an image, we can extract important points in the image to provide a &quot;feature description&quot; of the object. This description, extracted from a training image, can then be used to locate the object in a new (previously unseen) image containing other objects. In order to do this reliably, the features should be detectable even if the image is scaled, or if it has noise and different illumination. Such points usually lie on high-contrast regions of the image, such as object edges.

Another important characteristic of these features is that the relative positions between them in the original scene should not change between images. For example, if only the four corners of a door were used as features, they would work regardless of the door&#x27;s position; but if points in the frame were also used, the recognition would fail if the door is opened or closed. Similarly, features located in articulated or flexible objects would typically not work if any change in their internal geometry happens between two images in the set being processed. In practice, SIFT detects and uses a much larger number of features from the images, which reduces the contribution of the errors caused by these local variations in the average error of all feature matching errors.

SIFT can robustly identify objects even among clutter and under partial occlusion, because the SIFT feature descriptor is invariant to uniform scaling, orientation, illumination changes, and partially invariant to affine distortion. This section summarizes the original SIFT algorithm and mentions a few competing techniques available for object recognition under clutter and partial occlusion.

The SIFT descriptor is based on image measurements in terms of &quot;receptive fields&quot; over which &quot;local scale invariant reference frames&quot; are established by &quot;local scale selection&quot;. A general theoretical explanation about this is given in the Scholarpedia article on SIFT.

=== Types of features ===

The detection and description of local image features can help in object recognition. The SIFT features are local and based on the appearance of the object at particular interest points, and are invariant to image scale and rotation. They are also robust to changes in illumination, noise, and minor changes in viewpoint. In addition to these properties, they are highly distinctive, relatively easy to extract and allow for correct object identification with low probability of mismatch. They are relatively easy to match against a (large) database of local features but, however, the high dimensionality can be an issue, and generally probabilistic algorithms such as k-d trees with best bin first search are used. Object description by set of SIFT features is also robust to partial occlusion; as few as 3 SIFT features from an object are enough to compute its location and pose. Recognition can be performed in close-to-real time, at least for small databases and on modern computer hardware.

== Stages ==

=== Scale-invariant feature detection ===
Lowe&#x27;s method for image feature generation transforms an image into a large collection of feature vectors, each of which is invariant to image translation, scaling, and rotation, partially invariant to illumination changes, and robust to local geometric distortion. These features share similar properties with neurons in the primary visual cortex that encode basic forms, color, and movement for object detection in primate vision. Key locations are defined as maxima and minima of the result of difference of Gaussians function applied in scale space to a series of smoothed and resampled images. Low-contrast candidate points and edge response points along an edge are discarded. Dominant orientations are assigned to localized key points. These steps ensure that the key points are more stable for matching and recognition. SIFT descriptors robust to local affine distortion are then obtained by considering pixels around a radius of the key location, blurring, and resampling local image orientation planes.

=== Feature matching and indexing ===
Indexing consists of storing SIFT keys and identifying matching keys from the new image. Lowe used a modification of the k-d tree algorithm called the best-bin-first search method that can identify the nearest neighbors with high probability using only a limited amount of computation. The BBF algorithm uses a modified search ordering for the k-d tree algorithm so that bins in feature space are searched in the order of their closest distance from the query location. This search order requires the use of a heap-based priority queue for efficient determination of the search order. We obtain a candidate for each keypoint by identifying its nearest neighbor in the database of keypoints from training images. The nearest neighbors are defined as the keypoints with minimum Euclidean distance from the given descriptor vector. The way Lowe determined whether a given candidate should be kept or &#x27;thrown out&#x27; is by checking the ratio between the distance from this given candidate and the distance from the closest keypoint which is not of the same object class as the candidate at hand (candidate feature vector / closest different class feature vector), the idea is that we can only be sure of candidates in which features/keypoints from distinct object classes don&#x27;t &quot;clutter&quot; it (not geometrically clutter in the feature space necessarily but more so clutter along the right half (&gt;0) of the real line), this is an obvious consequence of using Euclidean distance as our nearest neighbor measure. The ratio threshold for rejection is whenever it is above 0.8. This method eliminated 90% of false matches while discarding less than 5% of correct matches. To further improve the efficiency of the best-bin-first algorithm search was cut off after checking the first 200 nearest neighbor candidates. For a database of 100,000 keypoints, this provides a speedup over exact nearest neighbor search by about 2 orders of magnitude, yet results in less than a 5% loss in the number of correct matches.

=== Cluster identification by Hough transform voting ===
Hough transform is used to cluster reliable model hypotheses to search for keys that agree upon a particular model pose. Hough transform identifies clusters of features with a consistent interpretation by using each feature to vote for all object poses that are consistent with the feature. When clusters of features are found to vote for the same pose of an object, the probability of the interpretation being correct is much higher than for any single feature. An entry in a hash table is created predicting the model location, orientation, and scale from the match hypothesis. The hash table is searched to identify all clusters of at least 3 entries in a bin, and the bins are sorted into decreasing order of size.

Each of the SIFT keypoints specifies 2D location, scale, and orientation, and each matched keypoint in the database has a record of its parameters relative to the training image in which it was found. The similarity transform implied by these 4 parameters is only an approximation to the full 6 degree-of-freedom pose space for a 3D object and also does not account for any non-rigid deformations. Therefore, Lowe used broad bin sizes of 30 degrees for orientation, a factor of 2 for scale, and 0.25 times the maximum projected training image dimension (using the predicted scale) for location. The SIFT key samples generated at the larger scale are given twice the weight of those at the smaller scale. This means that the larger scale is in effect able to filter the most likely neighbors for checking at the smaller scale. This also improves recognition performance by giving more weight to the least-noisy scale. To avoid the problem of boundary effects in bin assignment, each keypoint match votes for the 2 closest bins in each dimension, giving a total of 16 entries for each hypothesis and further broadening the pose range.

=== Model verification by linear least squares ===
Each identified cluster is then subject to a verification procedure in which a linear least squares solution is performed for the parameters of the affine transformation relating the model to the image. The affine transformation of a model point [x y]T to an image point [u v]T can be written as below

:formula_1

where the model translation is [tx ty]T and the affine rotation, scale, and stretch are represented by the parameters m1, m2, m3 and m4. To solve for the transformation parameters the equation above can be rewritten to gather the unknowns into a column vector.

:formula_2

This equation shows a single match, but any number of further matches can be added, with each match contributing two more rows to the first and last matrix. At least 3 matches are needed to provide a solution.
We can write this linear system as

:formula_3

where &quot;A&quot; is a known &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix (usually with &quot;m&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;), x is an unknown &quot;n&quot;-dimensional parameter vector, and b is a known &quot;m&quot;-dimensional measurement vector.

Therefore, the minimizing vector formula_4 is a solution of the normal equation
:formula_5

The solution of the system of linear equations is given in terms of the matrix formula_6, called the pseudoinverse of &quot;A&quot;, by

:formula_7

which minimizes the sum of the squares of the distances from the projected model locations to the corresponding image locations.

=== Outlier detection ===
Outliers can now be removed by checking for agreement between each image feature and the model, given the parameter solution. Given the linear least squares solution, each match is required to agree within half the error range that was used for the parameters in the Hough transform bins. As outliers are discarded, the linear least squares solution is re-solved with the remaining points, and the process iterated. If fewer than 3 points remain after discarding outliers, then the match is rejected. In addition, a top-down matching phase is used to add any further matches that agree with the projected model position, which may have been missed from the Hough transform bin due to the similarity transform approximation or other errors.

The final decision to accept or reject a model hypothesis is based on a detailed probabilistic model. This method first computes the expected number of false matches to the model pose, given the projected size of the model, the number of features within the region, and the accuracy of the fit. A Bayesian probability analysis then gives the probability that the object is present based on the actual number of matching features found. A model is accepted if the final probability for a correct interpretation is greater than 0.98. Lowe&#x27;s SIFT based object recognition gives excellent results except under wide illumination variations and under non-rigid transformations.

== Algorithm ==

=== Scale-space extrema detection ===
We begin by detecting points of interest, which are termed &quot;keypoints&quot; in the SIFT framework. The image is convolved with Gaussian filters at different scales, and then the difference of successive Gaussian-blurred images are taken. Keypoints are then taken as maxima/minima of the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) that occur at multiple scales. Specifically, a DoG image formula_8 is given by

:formula_9,
:where formula_10 is the convolution of the original image formula_11 with the Gaussian blur formula_12 at scale formula_13, i.e.,

:formula_14

Hence a DoG image between scales formula_15 and formula_16 is just the difference of the Gaussian-blurred images at scales formula_15 and formula_16. For scale space extrema detection in the SIFT algorithm, the image is first convolved with Gaussian-blurs at different scales. The convolved images are grouped by octave (an octave corresponds to doubling the value of formula_19), and the value of formula_20 is selected so that we obtain a fixed number of convolved images per octave. Then the Difference-of-Gaussian images are taken from adjacent Gaussian-blurred images per octave.

Once DoG images have been obtained, keypoints are identified as local minima/maxima of the DoG images across scales. This is done by comparing each pixel in the DoG images to its eight neighbors at the same scale and nine corresponding neighboring pixels in each of the neighboring scales. If the pixel value is the maximum or minimum among all compared pixels, it is selected as a candidate keypoint.

This keypoint detection step is a variation of one of the blob detection methods developed by Lindeberg by detecting scale-space extrema of the scale normalized Laplacian; that is, detecting points that are local extrema with respect to both space and scale, in the discrete case by comparisons with the nearest 26 neighbors in a discretized scale-space volume. The difference of Gaussians operator can be seen as an approximation to the Laplacian, with the implicit normalization in the pyramid also constituting a discrete approximation of the scale-normalized Laplacian. Another real-time implementation of scale-space extrema of the Laplacian operator has been presented by Lindeberg and Bretzner based on a hybrid pyramid representation, which was used for human-computer interaction by real-time gesture recognition in Bretzner et al. (2002).

=== Keypoint localization ===
 Scale-space extrema detection produces too many keypoint candidates, some of which are unstable. The next step in the algorithm is to perform a detailed fit to the nearby data for accurate location, scale, and ratio of principal curvatures. This information allows the rejection of points which are low contrast (and are therefore sensitive to noise) or poorly localized along an edge.

==== Interpolation of nearby data for accurate position ====
First, for each candidate keypoint, interpolation of nearby data is used to accurately determine its position. The initial approach was to just locate each keypoint at the location and scale of the candidate keypoint. The new approach calculates the interpolated location of the extremum, which substantially improves matching and stability. The interpolation is done using the quadratic Taylor expansion of the Difference-of-Gaussian scale-space function, formula_8 with the candidate keypoint as the origin. This Taylor expansion is given by:

:formula_22

where D and its derivatives are evaluated at the candidate keypoint and formula_23 is the offset from this point. The location of the extremum, formula_24, is determined by taking the derivative of this function with respect to formula_25 and setting it to zero. If the offset formula_24 is larger than formula_27 in any dimension, then that&#x27;s an indication that the extremum lies closer to another candidate keypoint. In this case, the candidate keypoint is changed and the interpolation performed instead about that point. Otherwise the offset is added to its candidate keypoint to get the interpolated estimate for the location of the extremum. A similar subpixel determination of the locations of scale-space extrema is performed in the real-time implementation based on hybrid pyramids developed by Lindeberg and his co-workers.

==== Discarding low-contrast keypoints ====
To discard the keypoints with low contrast, the value of the second-order Taylor expansion formula_28 is computed at the offset formula_24. If this value is less than formula_30, the candidate keypoint is discarded. Otherwise it is kept, with final scale-space location formula_31, where formula_32 is the original location of the keypoint.

==== Eliminating edge responses ====
The DoG function will have strong responses along edges, even if the candidate keypoint is not robust to small amounts of noise. Therefore, in order to increase stability, we need to eliminate the keypoints that have poorly determined locations but have high edge responses.

For poorly defined peaks in the DoG function, the principal curvature across the edge would be much larger than the principal curvature along it. Finding these principal curvatures amounts to solving for the eigenvalues of the second-order Hessian matrix, H:

:formula_33

The eigenvalues of H are proportional to the principal curvatures of D. It turns out that the ratio of the two eigenvalues, say formula_34 is the larger one, and formula_35 the smaller one, with ratio formula_36, is sufficient for SIFT&#x27;s purposes. The trace of H, i.e., formula_37, gives us the sum of the two eigenvalues, while its determinant, i.e., formula_38, yields the product. The ratio formula_39 can be shown to be equal to formula_40, which depends only on the ratio of the eigenvalues rather than their individual values. R is minimum when the eigenvalues are equal to each other. Therefore, the higher the absolute difference between the two eigenvalues, which is equivalent to a higher absolute difference between the two principal curvatures of D, the higher the value of R. It follows that, for some threshold eigenvalue ratio formula_41, if R for a candidate keypoint is larger than formula_42, that keypoint is poorly localized and hence rejected. The new approach uses formula_43.

This processing step for suppressing responses at edges is a transfer of a corresponding approach in the Harris operator for corner detection. The difference is that the measure for thresholding is computed from the Hessian matrix instead of a second-moment matrix.

=== Orientation assignment ===
In this step, each keypoint is assigned one or more orientations based on local image gradient directions. This is the key step in achieving invariance to rotation as the keypoint descriptor can be represented relative to this orientation and therefore achieve invariance to image rotation.

First, the Gaussian-smoothed image formula_44 at the keypoint&#x27;s scale formula_19 is taken so that all computations are performed in a scale-invariant manner. For an image sample formula_46 at scale formula_19, the gradient magnitude, formula_48, and orientation, formula_49, are precomputed using pixel
differences:

:formula_50

:formula_51

The magnitude and direction calculations for the gradient are done for every pixel in a neighboring region around the keypoint in the Gaussian-blurred image L. An orientation histogram with 36 bins is formed, with each bin covering 10 degrees. Each sample in the neighboring window added to a histogram bin is weighted by its gradient magnitude and by a Gaussian-weighted circular window with a formula_19 that is 1.5 times that of the scale of the keypoint. The peaks in this histogram correspond to dominant orientations. Once the histogram is filled, the orientations corresponding to the highest peak and local peaks that are within 80% of the highest peaks are assigned to the keypoint. In the case of multiple orientations being assigned, an additional keypoint is created having the same location and scale as the original keypoint for each additional orientation.

=== Keypoint descriptor ===
Previous steps found keypoint locations at particular scales and assigned orientations to them. This ensured invariance to image location, scale and rotation. Now we want to compute a descriptor vector for each keypoint such that the descriptor is highly distinctive and partially invariant to the remaining variations such as illumination, 3D viewpoint, etc. This step is performed on the image closest in scale to the keypoint&#x27;s scale.

First a set of orientation histograms is created on 4×4 pixel neighborhoods with 8 bins each. These histograms are computed from magnitude and orientation values of samples in a 16×16 region around the keypoint such that each histogram contains samples from a 4×4 subregion of the original neighborhood region. The image gradient magnitudes and orientations are sampled around the keypoint location, using the scale of the keypoint to select the level of Gaussian blur for the image. In order to achieve orientation invariance, the coordinates of the descriptor and the gradient orientations are rotated relative to the keypoint orientation. The magnitudes are further weighted by a Gaussian function with formula_19 equal to one half the width of the descriptor window. The descriptor then becomes a vector of all the values of these histograms. Since there are 4 × 4 = 16 histograms each with 8 bins the vector has 128 elements. This vector is then normalized to unit length in order to enhance invariance to affine changes in illumination. To reduce the effects of non-linear illumination a threshold of 0.2 is applied and the vector is again normalized. The thresholding process, also referred to as clamping, can improve matching results even when non-linear illumination effects are not present. The threshold of 0.2 was empirically chosen, and by replacing the fixed threshold with one systematically calculated, matching results can be improved.

Although the dimension of the descriptor, i.e. 128, seems high, descriptors with lower dimension than this don&#x27;t perform as well across the range of matching tasks and the computational cost remains low due to the approximate BBF (see below) method used for finding the nearest neighbor. Longer descriptors continue to do better but not by much and there is an additional danger of increased sensitivity to distortion and occlusion. It is also shown that feature matching accuracy is above 50% for viewpoint changes of up to 50 degrees. Therefore, SIFT descriptors are invariant to minor affine changes. To test the distinctiveness of the SIFT descriptors, matching accuracy is also measured against varying number of keypoints in the testing database, and it is shown that matching accuracy decreases only very slightly for very large database sizes, thus indicating that SIFT features are highly distinctive.

== Comparison of SIFT features with other local features ==
There has been an extensive study done on the performance evaluation of different local descriptors, including SIFT, using a range of detectors. The main results are summarized below:

* SIFT and SIFT-like GLOH features exhibit the highest matching accuracies (recall rates) for an affine transformation of 50 degrees. After this transformation limit, results start to become unreliable.
* Distinctiveness of descriptors is measured by summing the eigenvalues of the descriptors, obtained by the Principal components analysis of the descriptors normalized by their variance. This corresponds to the amount of variance captured by different descriptors, therefore, to their distinctiveness. PCA-SIFT (Principal Components Analysis applied to SIFT descriptors), GLOH and SIFT features give the highest values.
* SIFT-based descriptors outperform other contemporary local descriptors on both textured and structured scenes, with the difference in performance larger on the textured scene.
* For scale changes in the range 2–2.5 and image rotations in the range 30 to 45 degrees, SIFT and SIFT-based descriptors again outperform other contemporary local descriptors with both textured and structured scene content.
* Introduction of blur affects all local descriptors, especially those based on edges, like shape context, because edges disappear in the case of a strong blur. But GLOH, PCA-SIFT and SIFT still performed better than the others. This is also true for evaluation in the case of illumination changes.

The evaluations carried out suggests strongly that SIFT-based descriptors, which are region-based, are the most robust and distinctive, and are therefore best suited for feature matching. However, most recent feature descriptors such as SURF have not been evaluated in this study.

SURF has later been shown to have similar performance to SIFT, while at the same time being much faster. Other studies conclude that when speed is not critical, SIFT outperforms SURF. Specifically, disregarding discretization effects the pure image descriptor in SIFT is significantly better than the pure image descriptor in SURF, whereas the scale-space extrema of the determinant of the Hessian underlying the pure interest point detector in SURF constitute significantly better interest points compared to the scale-space extrema of the Laplacian to which the interest point detector in SIFT constitutes a numerical approximation.

The performance of image matching by SIFT descriptors can be improved in the sense of achieving higher efficiency scores and lower 1-precision scores by replacing the scale-space extrema of the difference-of-Gaussians operator in original SIFT by scale-space extrema of the determinant of the Hessian, or more generally considering a more general family of generalized scale-space interest points.

Recently, a slight variation of the descriptor employing an irregular histogram grid has been proposed that significantly improves its performance. Instead of using a 4×4 grid of histogram bins, all bins extend to the center of the feature. This improves the descriptor&#x27;s robustness to scale changes.

The SIFT-Rank descriptor was shown to improve the performance of the standard SIFT descriptor for affine feature matching. A SIFT-Rank descriptor is generated from a standard SIFT descriptor, by setting each histogram bin to its rank in a sorted array of bins. The Euclidean distance between SIFT-Rank descriptors is invariant to arbitrary monotonic changes in histogram bin values, and is related to Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient.

== Applications ==

=== Object recognition using SIFT features ===
Given SIFT&#x27;s ability to find distinctive keypoints that are invariant to location, scale and rotation, and robust to affine transformations (changes in scale, rotation, shear, and position) and changes in illumination, they are usable for object recognition. The steps are given below.

* First, SIFT features are obtained from the input image using the algorithm described above.
* These features are matched to the SIFT feature database obtained from the training images. This feature matching is done through a Euclidean-distance based nearest neighbor approach. To increase robustness, matches are rejected for those keypoints for which the ratio of the nearest neighbor distance to the second-nearest neighbor distance is greater than 0.8. This discards many of the false matches arising from background clutter. Finally, to avoid the expensive search required for finding the Euclidean-distance-based nearest neighbor, an approximate algorithm called the best-bin-first algorithm is used. This is a fast method for returning the nearest neighbor with high probability, and can give speedup by factor of 1000 while finding nearest neighbor (of interest) 95% of the time.
* Although the distance ratio test described above discards many of the false matches arising from background clutter, we still have matches that belong to different objects. Therefore, to increase robustness to object identification, we want to cluster those features that belong to the same object and reject the matches that are left out in the clustering process. This is done using the Hough transform. This will identify clusters of features that vote for the same object pose. When clusters of features are found to vote for the same pose of an object, the probability of the interpretation being correct is much higher than for any single feature. Each keypoint votes for the set of object poses that are consistent with the keypoint&#x27;s location, scale, and orientation. &quot;Bins&quot; that accumulate at least 3 votes are identified as candidate object/pose matches.
* For each candidate cluster, a least-squares solution for the best estimated affine projection parameters relating the training image to the input image is obtained. If the projection of a keypoint through these parameters lies within half the error range that was used for the parameters in the Hough transform bins, the keypoint match is kept. If fewer than 3 points remain after discarding outliers for a bin, then the object match is rejected. The least-squares fitting is repeated until no more rejections take place. This works better for planar surface recognition than 3D object recognition since the affine model is no longer accurate for 3D objects.
* In this journal, authors proposed a new approach to use SIFT descriptors for multiple object detection purposes. The proposed multiple object detection approach is tested on aerial and satellite images.

SIFT features can essentially be applied to any task that requires identification of matching locations between images. Work has been done on applications such as recognition of particular object categories in 2D images, 3D reconstruction,
motion tracking and segmentation, robot localization, image panorama stitching and epipolar calibration. Some of these are discussed in more detail below.

=== Robot localization and mapping ===
In this application, a trinocular stereo system is used to determine 3D estimates for keypoint locations. Keypoints are used only when they appear in all 3 images with consistent disparities, resulting in very few outliers. As the robot moves, it localizes itself using feature matches to the existing 3D map, and then incrementally adds features to the map while updating their 3D positions using a Kalman filter. This provides a robust and accurate solution to the problem of robot localization in unknown environments. Recent 3D solvers leverage the use of keypoint directions to solve trinocular geometry from three keypoints and absolute pose from only two keypoints, an often disregarded but useful measurement available in SIFT. These orientation measurements reduce the number of required correspondences, further increasing robustness exponentially.

=== Panorama stitching ===
SIFT feature matching can be used in image stitching for fully automated panorama reconstruction from non-panoramic images. The SIFT features extracted from the input images are matched against each other to find &quot;k&quot; nearest-neighbors for each feature. These correspondences are then used to find &quot;m&quot; candidate matching images for each image. Homographies between pairs of images are then computed using RANSAC and a probabilistic model is used for verification. Because there is no restriction on the input images, graph search is applied to find connected components of image matches such that each connected component will correspond to a panorama. Finally for each connected component bundle adjustment is performed to solve for joint camera parameters, and the panorama is rendered using multi-band blending. Because of the SIFT-inspired object recognition approach to panorama stitching, the resulting system is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the images. The input images can contain multiple panoramas and noise images (some of which may not even be part of the composite image), and panoramic sequences are recognized and rendered as output.

=== 3D scene modeling, recognition and tracking ===
This application uses SIFT features for 3D object recognition and 3D modeling in context of augmented reality, in which synthetic objects with accurate pose are superimposed on real images. SIFT matching is done for a number of 2D images of a scene or object taken from different angles. This is used with bundle adjustment initialized from an essential matrix or trifocal tensor to build a sparse 3D model of the viewed scene and to simultaneously recover camera poses and calibration parameters. Then the position, orientation and size of the virtual object are defined relative to the coordinate frame of the recovered model. For online match moving, SIFT features again are extracted from the current video frame and matched to the features already computed for the world model, resulting in a set of 2D-to-3D correspondences. These correspondences are then used to compute the current camera pose for the virtual projection and final rendering. A regularization technique is used to reduce the jitter in the virtual projection. The use of SIFT directions have also been used to increase robustness of this process. 3D extensions of SIFT have also been evaluated for true 3D object recognition and retrieval.

=== 3D SIFT-like descriptors for human action recognition ===
Extensions of the SIFT descriptor to 2+1-dimensional spatio-temporal data in context of human action recognition in video sequences have been studied. The computation of local position-dependent histograms in the 2D SIFT algorithm are extended from two to three dimensions to describe SIFT features in a spatio-temporal domain. For application to human action recognition in a video sequence, sampling of the training videos is carried out either at spatio-temporal interest points or at randomly determined locations, times and scales. The spatio-temporal regions around these interest points are then described using the 3D SIFT descriptor. These descriptors are then clustered to form a spatio-temporal Bag of words model. 3D SIFT descriptors extracted from the test videos are then matched against these &quot;words&quot; for human action classification.

The authors report much better results with their 3D SIFT descriptor approach than with other approaches like simple 2D SIFT descriptors and Gradient Magnitude.

=== Analyzing the Human Brain in 3D Magnetic Resonance Images ===
The Feature-based Morphometry (FBM) technique uses extrema in a difference of Gaussian scale-space to analyze and classify 3D magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the human brain. FBM models the image probabilistically as a collage of independent features, conditional on image geometry and group labels, e.g. healthy subjects and subjects with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). Features are first extracted in individual images from a 4D difference of Gaussian scale-space, then modeled in terms of their appearance, geometry and group co-occurrence statistics across a set of images. FBM was validated in the analysis of AD using a set of ~200 volumetric MRIs of the human brain, automatically identifying established indicators of AD in the brain and classifying mild AD in new images with a rate of 80%.

== Competing methods ==
Alternative methods for scale-invariant object recognition under clutter / partial occlusion include the following.

RIFT is a rotation-invariant generalization of SIFT. The RIFT descriptor is constructed using circular normalized patches divided into concentric rings of equal width and within each ring a gradient orientation histogram is computed. To maintain rotation invariance, the orientation is measured at each point relative to the direction pointing outward from the center.

RootSIFT is a variant of SIFT that modifies descriptor normalization. Because SIFT descriptors are histograms (and so are probability distributions), Euclidean distance is not an accurate way to measure their similarity. Better similarity metrics turn out to be ones tailored to probability distributions, such as Bhattacharyya coefficient (also called Hellinger kernel). For this purpose, the originally formula_54-normalized descriptor is first formula_55-normalized and the square root of each element is computed, followed by formula_54-renormalization. After these algebraic manipulations, RootSIFT descriptors can be normally compared using Euclidean distance, which is equivalent to using the Hellinger kernel on the original SIFT descriptors. This normalization scheme termed “L1-sqrt” was previously introduced for the block normalization of HOG features whose rectangular block arrangement descriptor variant (R-HOG) is conceptually similar to the SIFT descriptor.

G-RIF: Generalized Robust Invariant Feature is a general context descriptor which encodes edge orientation, edge density and hue information in a unified form combining perceptual information with spatial encoding. The object recognition scheme uses neighboring context based voting to estimate object models.

&quot;SURF: Speeded Up Robust Features&quot; is a high-performance scale- and rotation-invariant interest point detector / descriptor claimed to approximate or even outperform previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness. SURF relies on integral images for image convolutions to reduce computation time, builds on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (using a fast Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector and a distribution-based descriptor). It describes a distribution of Haar wavelet responses within the interest point neighborhood. Integral images are used for speed and only 64 dimensions are used reducing the time for feature computation and matching. The indexing step is based on the sign of the Laplacian, which increases the matching speed and the robustness of the descriptor.

PCA-SIFT and GLOH are variants of SIFT. PCA-SIFT descriptor is a vector of image gradients in x and y direction computed within the support region. The gradient region is sampled at 39×39 locations, therefore the vector is of dimension 3042. The dimension is reduced to 36 with PCA. Gradient location-orientation histogram (GLOH) is an extension of the SIFT descriptor designed to increase its robustness and distinctiveness. The SIFT descriptor is computed for a log-polar location grid with three bins in radial direction (the radius set to 6, 11, and 15) and 8 in angular direction, which results in 17 location bins. The central bin is not divided in angular directions. The gradient orientations are quantized in 16 bins resulting in 272-bin histogram. The size of this descriptor is reduced with PCA. The covariance matrix for PCA is estimated on image patches collected from various images. The 128 largest eigenvectors are used for description.

Gauss-SIFT is a pure image descriptor defined by performing all image measurements underlying the pure image descriptor in SIFT by Gaussian derivative responses as opposed to derivative approximations in an image pyramid as done in regular SIFT. In this way, discretization effects over space and scale can be reduced to a minimum allowing for potentially more accurate image descriptors. In Lindeberg (2015) such pure Gauss-SIFT image descriptors were combined with a set of generalized scale-space interest points comprising the Laplacian of the Gaussian, the determinant of the Hessian, four new unsigned or signed Hessian feature strength measures as well as Harris-Laplace and Shi-and-Tomasi interests points. In an extensive experimental evaluation on a poster dataset comprising multiple views of 12 posters over scaling transformations up to a factor of 6 and viewing direction variations up to a slant angle of 45 degrees, it was shown that substantial increase in performance of image matching (higher efficiency scores and lower 1-precision scores) could be obtained by replacing Laplacian of Gaussian interest points by determinant of the Hessian interest points. Since difference-of-Gaussians interest points constitute a numerical approximation of Laplacian of the Gaussian interest points, this shows that a substantial increase in matching performance is possible by replacing the difference-of-Gaussians interest points in SIFT by determinant of the Hessian interest points. Additional increase in performance can furthermore be obtained by considering the unsigned Hessian feature strength measure formula_57. A quantitative comparison between the Gauss-SIFT descriptor and a corresponding Gauss-SURF descriptor did also show that Gauss-SIFT does generally perform significantly better than Gauss-SURF for a large number of different scale-space interest point detectors. This study therefore shows that discregarding discretization effects the pure image descriptor in SIFT is significantly better than the pure image descriptor in SURF, whereas the underlying interest point detector in SURF, which can be seen as numerical approximation to scale-space extrema of the determinant of the Hessian, is significantly better than the underlying interest point detector in SIFT.

Wagner et al. developed two object recognition algorithms especially designed with the limitations of current mobile phones in mind. In contrast to the classic SIFT approach, Wagner et al. use the FAST corner detector for feature detection. The algorithm also distinguishes between the off-line preparation phase where features are created at different scale levels and the on-line phase where features are only created at the current fixed scale level of the phone&#x27;s camera image. In addition, features are created from a fixed patch size of 15×15 pixels and form a SIFT descriptor with only 36 dimensions. The approach has been further extended by integrating a Scalable Vocabulary Tree in the recognition pipeline. This allows the efficient recognition of a larger number of objects on mobile phones. The approach is mainly restricted by the amount of available RAM.

KAZE and A-KAZE &quot;(KAZE Features and Accelerated-Kaze Features)&quot; is a new 2D feature detection and description method that perform better compared to SIFT and SURF. It gains a lot of popularity due to its open source code. KAZE was originally made by Pablo F. Alcantarilla, Adrien Bartoli and Andrew J. Davison.

<text>Moment is an independent magazine which focuses on the life of the American Jewish community. It is not tied to any particular Jewish movement or ideology. The publication features investigative stories and cultural criticism, highlighting the thoughts and opinions of diverse scholars, writers, artists and policymakers. &quot;Moment&quot; was founded in 1975, by Nobel Prize laureate Elie Wiesel and Jewish activist Leonard Fein, who served as the magazine&#x27;s first editor from 1975 to 1987. In its premier issue, Fein wrote that the magazine would include diverse opinions &quot;of no single ideological position, save of course, for a commitment to Jewish life.&quot; Hershel Shanks served as the editor from 1987 to 2004. In 2004, Nadine Epstein took over as editor and executive publisher of &quot;Moment.&quot;

The magazine was named in honor of an independent Yiddish-language newspaper, entitled &quot;Der Moment&quot;. Founded in Warsaw in 1910, &quot;Der Moment&quot; remained in operation until the eve of Yom Kippur 1939, when the building housing the newspaper was destroyed by a German bomb. At the time, the publication was one of two Yiddish-language newspapers in the city.

&quot;Moment&quot; magazine is an independent journal that publishes articles on Jewish culture, politics, and religion. Its editorial staff, writers, and articles represent a diverse range of political views. &quot;Moment&quot; publishes a print magazine once every other month, maintains a website, runs literary contests, and hosts events. The magazine is a publishing project of the Washington D.C.–based Center for Creative Change. 

&quot;Moment&quot;&#x27;s recent stable of contributors include fiction writer Naomi Ragen; academics Fania Oz-Salzberger and Marshall Breger; journalists Shmuel Rosner, Gershom Gorenberg, Amy E. Schwartz and Emmy Award winner Letty Cottin Pogrebin; and critics Robert Siegel and Carlin Romano. Past contributors have included Calvin Trillin, Chaim Potok, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Abba Eban, Cynthia Ozick, Wolf Blitzer, Yossi Klein Halevi, Theodore Bikel, Jerome Groopman, Ron Rosenbaum, Sherwin Nuland, Erica Jong, Dara Horn, David Margolick, and Rebecca Goldstein.
