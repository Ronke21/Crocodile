<doc id="1209397" wikidata="Q1571208" url="?curid=1209397" title="Vehicle registration plates of Greece">
<text>[[Greece|Greek]] [[vehicle registration plate]]s are composed of three letters and four digits per plate (e.g. codice_1) printed in black on a white background. The letters represent the district (prefecture) that issues the plates while the numbers range from 1000 to 9999. As of 2004 a blue strip was added on the left showing the country code of Greece (GR) in white text and the Flag of Europe in yellow. Similar plates but of square size with numbers ranging from 1 to 999 are issued for motorcycles which exceed 50 cc in engine size.

With the exception of Athens and Thessaloniki which are represented by just the first letter of the three, all other districts are represented by the first 2 letters. The final one or two letters in the sequence changes in Greek alphabetical order after 8,999 issued plates. For example, Patras plates are codice_2, where ΑΧ represents the Achaia prefecture of which Patras is the capital. When codice_3 is reached the plates turn to codice_4 and this continues until codice_5 is finished. The letters are officially letters from the Latin alphabet, but only those letters are used whose shape (as a capital letter) matches a letter from the Greek alphabet, specifically Α, Β, Ε, Ζ, Η, Ι, Κ, Μ, Ν, Ο, Ρ, Τ, Υ, Χ (in Greek alphabetical order). This is because Greece is a contracting party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which in Annex 2 requires registration numbers to be displayed in capital Latin characters and Arabic numerals. The rule applies in a similar way in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria.

Combinations used for overseas residents are codice_6 (where L = letter and N = number) and are limited. Until 2003, taxis used codice_6; the plate was aligned with the prefecture and the letters were colored red.

==History==


===1911–1954===
Up until 1954 Greek number plates were quite simple: black numbers on a white background, indicating the serial number shown on the car&#x27;s license. These started at 1 and advanced to approximately 75,000 when the system was changed. The owner had to provide the plates and specifications were minimal: the size of the plates and numbers, as well as their respective colours. This meant that plates were not very uniform. Taxis had to indicate the initial of the city they were licensed in (e.g. &quot;A&quot; for Athens). In 1954 it was compulsory for all vehicles to change to a new system.

===1954–1956===
For just 2 years the system was codice_8, codice_9, codice_6 or codice_11 with black characters on yellow background where L was the initial of the city they were licensed in (e.g. &quot;A&quot; for Athens, &quot;Θ&quot; for Thessaloniki etc.). All these plates display &quot;1953–54&quot; (the initial time period for the change, later revised) in black characters on a white background using a smaller typeface in the top left corner. These plates were compulsorily withdrawn in 1956.

===1956-1972===
In 1956 the system was again changed to just numbers codice_12. NNNNNN could be any number from one to six digits starting once again with &quot;1&quot; and ending this time at about &quot;451000&quot;, though not all numbers were allocated. Characters were black on white background with a band at the top of both front and rear plates indicating city/district of registration and type of usage (private, commercial etc). Sometime after the early 60s the band on the front plate was abandoned and hence that plate became shorter in height, while the band at the rear became blue. This time it was not compulsory to change plates after 1972 when the newer system arrived. Hence these so-called &quot;six-figure plates&quot; can still occasionally (as of 2018) be spotted on a few old vehicles.

===1973–1985===
In 1972, they became lettered and the system was codice_13 while trucks used codice_6. Again, they were black characters on white background but with a new typeface. It was not compulsory to change these plates when the newer system arrived.

===1984–2004===
In 1984, the system changed to codice_15 and the first two letters are prefecture letters (with the exception of the biggest prefectures Attica/Athens and Thessaloniki where only the first letter remained the same). Again, it was not compulsory to change to the newer &quot;euro&quot; plates in 2004.

===2004 to present===
In September/October 2004 the euroband and international country code (GR) were added to the left and the typeface changed. In all other respects the previous system codice_15 continued with the numbering allocation carrying on as from pre-2004.

===Historic Vehicle plates===
Historic vehicle number plates can be issued for vehicles over 30 years old, after they pass the &quot;authenticity&quot; inspection. They came in yellow/blue, white/blue or white/orange depending on the historic vehicle organisation (FILPA or FHVE) and they consist of 4 numbers. Since 2023, new governmental historic plates are now available. They begin with the code IO and they have 5 digits (e.g. IO-12345). Their background is white and they have blue letters.

== Prefectures (in Greek alphabetical order) ==
The first 2 of 3 letters (which are listed below) of a licence plate usually represent the prefecture (nomos) where the car was registered. The almost full list of plates in Greece is below (next to the prefecture / district is its capital or an area within the prefecture that the plates are issued; some prefectures have more than one combination):

== Special plates ==

Vehicles that belong to public services and armed forces use special license plates with the following letter combinations followed by numbers: 

* ΑΙΑ (Athens International Airport service vehicles) — (white coloured with black lettering, unofficial plates)
* ΑΝ.Π. (, ) — Disabled in war (blue coloured with white lettering; same look as diplomatic plates)
* ΔΟΚ (, ) — Test plates – (issued to dealers when specific criteria are met: can be used interchangeably on all cars in dealers stock which do not have normal number plates)
* ΔΣ (, ) — Corps Diplomatique or foreign delegation (e.g. codice_21, codice_22) (blue-coloured)
* Ε.Α. or ΕΛ.ΑΣ. (, ) — Hellenic Police
* ΛΣ (, ) — Coast Guard
* ΞΑ (, ) — Foreign missions (orange coloured)
* ΕΣ (, ) — Hellenic Army
* ΠΑ (, ) — Hellenic Air Force
* ΠΝ (, ) — Hellenic Navy
* ΠΣ (, ) — Fire Guard
* ΠΚ (, ) — President of the Government, i.e. the Prime Minister of Greece

The following categories are conflicting: The same letter combinations are used for both public services and specific regions:

* ΑΜ (, ) — Agricultural vehicles
* ΚΥ (, ) — State
* ΜΕ (, ) — Public works vehicles (yellow coloured)

For truck trailers over 3.5 tonnes without a prime mover:

The letter P followed by a hyphen and 5 or 4 numerals is used.

Also:

* T* (Τρέιλερ, &quot;Trailer&quot;) — New trailer plates for private owners, since 2022 (white coloured with black lettering, combinations from TA to TX, 5 digits)
* IO (Ιστορικά Οχήματα, &quot;Istorika Ochimata&quot;) — New official plates for oldtimer vehicles, since 2023 (white coloured with blue lettering, 5 digits)

== Allied Forces in Greece [AFG] plates ==

Very similarly to AFI plates in Italy, AFG plates display the same display with four digits (instead of five in Italy) for cars, three digits for motorcycles. The first letter indicates the military base (A: Athens, I: Heraklion, T: Thessaloniki). AFG plates are solely distributed to US servicemembers on Greek soil.

<text>Howth Head ( ; &quot;Ceann Bhinn Éadair&quot; in Irish) is a peninsula northeast of the city of Dublin in Ireland, within the governance of Fingal County Council. Entry to the headland is at Sutton while the village of Howth and the harbour are on the north-eastern face. Most of Howth Head is occupied by the Hill of Howth, though there are other regions, such as the tombolo at Sutton, extensive beaches on the northern shores, and small ones in other parts. The Baily Lighthouse is on the southeastern part of Howth Head. Nearby are the districts of Baldoyle and Portmarnock, and adjacent is the nature reserve of North Bull Island.

==History==
The earliest mention of the peninsula may be on a map attributed to Claudius Ptolemy, where it was called &quot;Edri Deserta&quot; or in Greek (&quot;Edrou Heremos&quot;, Edar&#x27;s isolated place). Here it was portrayed as an island, but it is not clear if this was due to actual separation from the headland or inaccurate information available to the cartographer. Other writers think that &quot;Edrou&quot; was actually Lambay Island, from Greek (&quot;hedra&quot;) &quot;sitting place [for ships]&quot;.

The peninsula has been occupied since at least the 3rd millennium BC, with two middens found, and a dolmen dating back to around 2200 BC. It features in several Irish legends. A fishing settlement developed at Howth, and the area developed under the Norman St. Lawrence family, who owned most of Howth Head from the late 1100s until the 20th century, with the residual main estate sold in 2019. In the 19th century, electric tramlines to and over Howth Head made the whole hill more accessible.

==Location and topography==
Originally an island, Howth Head is connected to the mainland via a narrow strip of land, or tombolo, and forms the northerly bound of the great crescent of Dublin Bay, roughly corresponding to Dalkey Hill and Killiney Hill in the south.

Most of the headland is hilly, with peaks such as the 171 m Black Linn, by the Ben of Howth, on a side road beyond the Green Hill Quarries at the Loughereen Hills, Shielmartin Hill (163 m) overlooking Carrickbrack Road and Carrickbrack and Dun Hill. There are also craggy areas such as Muck Rock (Carrickmore), and Kilrock.

Howth has an extensive and varied coastline, and there are steep sea cliffs around parts, especially on the north coast. Key points on the coast, clockwise from Sutton, include Cush Point, Claremont Strand, the small headland at Howth village, Balscadden Bay, Kilrock, the Great and Little Baily, Lion&#x27;s Head, Doldrum Bay, the Needles, Drumleck Point, Red Rock and Sutton Strand.

Due to the shape of the landform, and its rocky nature, with thin soil covering, Howth features multiple streams and several fast-running streams, due to hard rock under a thin soil layer. These include the Bloody Stream, Coulcour Brook, the Boggeen Stream, the Offington Stream, the Whitewater Brook, the Balsaggart Stream, and the Carrickbrack and Santa Sabina Streams.

==Fauna and flora==
The cliffs support a large colony of seabirds, notably razorbills, common guillemots, fulmars, kittiwakes and cormorants. The scrubland above supports several heathland species including skylarks, meadow pipits, common whitethroats, linnets, stonechats and whinchats. The most commonly seen birds of prey are kestrels, peregrine falcons and common buzzards.

Gorse grows in many places on the headland. Fires are frequent during dry summers. Thirty-one non-native plants were recorded in 2018 from Howth Head.

==Transport==
There are two railway stations on or near the head. Sutton station is on the northern edge of the tombolo between Sutton and Baldoyle, and Howth station is on the head in the village of Howth. Both are served by Dublin Area Rapid Transit trains and have regular services to and from Dublin city centre. Historically the Hill of Howth Tramway ran between the stations around the head between 1901 and 1959. Additionally Dublin Bus routes serve the headland. A full road network accesses most parts, although some are only reachable by some of the many footpaths.

==Gallery==
==Leisure==
Howth is a popular destination for day-trippers from the capital, accessible by car, bus and one of the northern termini of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit train system (DART). Hikers can choose from a wide range of routes, including the Cliff Walk, the Cliff Path Closed Loop, or making for the ancient cairn on one of Howth&#x27;s several summits. On clear days, the Wicklow Mountains can be seen, with Dublin city below. Slieve Donard, an 852-metre peak in Northern Ireland may also be visible - a distance of . Quite frequently, Snowdon (1,085 m) in Snowdonia National Park in Wales can also be seen - a distance of .

==Cultural references==
Howth Head is the location where Leopold Bloom proposes to Molly in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. In the short story &#x27;Eveline&#x27;, another work by James Joyce from the collection &quot;Dubliners&quot;, it is mentioned that Eveline and her family once had a picnic on the Hill of Howth. Howth Head is also central to Joyce&#x27;s final work, &quot;Finnegans Wake,&quot; in which one of the principal characters, HCE, is, among other things, representative of the mountain.

Howth Head is mentioned in the lyrics of the title track of Kate Bush&#x27;s 1989 album, &quot;The Sensual World&quot;: &#x27;...took six big wheels and rolled our bodies / off of Howth Head and into the flesh, mmh, yes...&#x27;. The song is inspired by Molly Bloom&#x27;s soliloquy in Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

The peninsula also features in the backdrop of multiple paintings by Irish artist William Orpen (1878-1931) and by American artist James Whistler.
Howth Head is the setting of two scenes from the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Once.&quot;

<doc id="1209409" wikidata="Q25134193" url="?curid=1209409" title="North and South Brother Islands (New York City)">
<text>North and South Brother Islands are a pair of small islands located in New York City&#x27;s East River between the mainland Bronx and Rikers Island. North Brother Island was once the site of the Riverside Hospital for quarantinable diseases but is now uninhabited. The islands had long been privately owned, but were purchased by the federal government in 2007 with some funding from the Trust for Public Land and others; both were given to the city. They were then designated as sanctuaries for water birds.

According to the New York City Parks Department, which oversees the islands, North Brother Island has about of land, and South Brother Island about .

Public access is prohibited but permission is occasionally given to researchers and journalists; a NYC Parks staff member escorts all such visitors.

==History==

Both North Brother Island and South Brother Island were claimed by the Dutch West India Company in 1614 and were originally named &quot;De Gesellen&quot;, translated as &quot;the companions&quot; or &quot;the brethren&quot; in English. One source states that the islands were named by navigator Adriaen Block.

By the late 1600s the islands were owned by the British who occupied the area. In 1695 the government granted both to James Graham who did not develop the islands because the currents in the area were treacherous.

The islands were both originally part of Queens County. On June 8, 1881, North Brother Island was transferred to what was then part of New York County (later to become the Bronx). On April 16, 1964, South Brother Island was also transferred to the Bronx. The islands had been incorporated into Long Island City in 1870, before the consolidation of New York City in 1898.

===North Brother Island===

The northern of the islands was uninhabited until 1885, though a lighthouse was built in 1869. In the mid-1880s the Riverside Hospital moved there from Blackwell&#x27;s Island (now known as Roosevelt Island). Riverside Hospital had been founded in the 1850s as a smallpox hospital to treat and isolate victims of that disease. Its mission eventually expanded to other quarantinable diseases, initially typhoid and then smallpox and tuberculosis. During the polio epidemic in 1916, Riverside treated numerous patients.

Like the waterfront gantry, the oldest building was erected in 1885 and the last to be established was the Tuberculosis Pavilion, which opened in 1943. It was rendered obsolete within the decade due to the increasing availability, acceptance, and use of the tuberculosis vaccine after 1945.

The island was the site of the wreck of the &quot;General Slocum&quot;, a steamship that burned on June 15, 1904: 1,021 people died either from the fire on board the ship, or from drowning before the ship beached on the island&#x27;s shores.

According to Joseph Mitchell, a reporter for newspapers and for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the island was the site of many outings of &quot;The Honorable John McSorley Pickle, Beefsteak, Baseball Nine, and Chowder Club&quot; organized by John McSorley of McSorley&#x27;s Old Ale House; photos of the outings are featured on the walls of the bar.

Mary Mallon, also known as Typhoid Mary, was confined to the island for over two decades until she died there in November 1938. Because of her contagious illness, she had been declared a public menace in 1915; she suffered a stroke in 1932 and was thereafter confined to the hospital. Researchers estimate that Mallon had contaminated &quot;at least one hundred and twenty two people, including five who died&quot;.

According to the &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine, the need for a quarantine hospital in a remote location had declined by the 1930s, as &quot;public health advances lessened the need to quarantine large numbers of individuals&quot;.

Following World War II, the island housed war veterans who were students at local colleges and their families. After the nationwide housing shortage abated, the island was again abandoned until the 1950s, when a center opened to treat adolescent drug addicts. The facility claimed it was the first to offer treatment, rehabilitation, and education facilities to young drug offenders. Heroin addicts were confined to this facility and locked in a room until they were clean. Many of them believed they were being held against their will. Staff corruption and cost forced the facility to close in 1963. The facility is said to have been the inspiration for the Broadway play &quot;Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?&quot;, which helped to launch the career of Al Pacino.

Since the mid-1960s, New York City mayors have considered a variety of uses for the island. John Lindsay, for instance, proposed to sell it, and Ed Koch thought it could be converted into housing for the homeless. The city also considered using it as an extension of the jail at Rikers Island.

Now serving as a sanctuary for herons and other wading shorebirds, the island is presently abandoned and off-limits to the public. Most of the original 25 buildings still stand, &quot;in various states of extreme dilapidation&quot;; hence, permits to visit are issued only for &quot;compelling academic and scientific purposes&quot;. Some buildings are in danger of collapse; a dense forest conceals the ruined hospital buildings. In October 2014, New York City Council member Mark Levine, chair of the City Council&#x27;s Parks Committee, led a delegation to visit the island, and declared his desire afterward to open the island for limited &quot;light-touch, environmentally sensitive&quot; public access. In October 2016, &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that the council had commissioned a study from the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s School of Design, followed by a public hearing, on how the island could be converted into a park with controlled access by the public.

In 2016, the executive director of the Historic House Trust warned that there were many hazards, due to the deteriorating buildings and open manholes. In addition to resolving those problems, a dock would have been needed. Overall, the cost appeared to be prohibitive and no actual steps were ever taken.

In 2017, reporter Josh Robin of the NY1 channel was allowed to visit the North island and posted a video report that included some of the abandoned buildings. Also in 2017, the Science Channel filmed an episode on North Brother Island for the series &quot;What on Earth?&quot;. Journalist Dave Mosher accompanied the crew and posted a report and still photographs of the buildings and environment. The report stated that the island is &quot;both eerie and beautiful&quot; but added that most buildings were unsafe, that few buildings still included a &quot;functional roof&quot; and poison ivy was problematic everywhere.

===South Brother Island===
In the mid-19th century, Alfred W. White, who was in charge of public health for the city, used South Brother Island as the city&#x27;s first dump, where garbage, manure, offal and carcasses were sent to help clean up the city, which consisted at that time of only Manhattan and its islands. However, the island is only about a half-mile from the Bronx and the country estates of the city&#x27;s rich, such as William Ligett and Jacob Lorillard, both scions of tobacco families. It was also close enough to the shoreline villages of Queens County to be noxious to them as well, and the combination of Queens villages and wealthy Bronxites convinced the Queens County Supreme Court to stop the dumping.

Jacob Ruppert, a brewery magnate and early owner of the New York Yankees, had a summer house on the island that burned down in 1909. No one has lived on the island since then, and there are no structures extant. Ruppert owned the island until the late 1930s, and in 1944 it was purchased by John Gerosa, president of the Metropolitan Roofing Supply Company; he said he planned to construct cottages for employees but they were never built.
In 1975, the city sold South Brother Island to Hampton Scows Inc., a Long Island investment company, for $10. Hampton Scows paid property taxes every year but did not develop the island.

In November 2007, the island was purchased in a complicated transaction in which $2 million of federal grant money from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program was allocated to the Wildlife Conservation Society and the POINT Community Development Corporation. The Trust for Public Land then acquired the island on behalf of those organizations, and then donated it to the city&#x27;s Parks Department as a wildlife sanctuary. It is managed by the city&#x27;s Parks Department and the Bronx Zoo. South Brother Island was the 13th island to come under the Parks Department&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==Wildlife==
Both islands are part of a designated wildlife sanctuary. From the 1980s through the early 2000s, North Brother Island supported one of the area&#x27;s largest nesting colonies of black-crowned night heron. However, by 2008 this species had abandoned the island for unknown reasons. Barn swallows use the abandoned structures for nesting, and can be seen flying over the island.

On South Brother Island, dense brush supports nesting colonies of several species of birds, notably black-crowned night heron, great egret, snowy egret, and double-crested cormorant.  The New York City Bird Alliance has monitored nesting colonies on the island for over 20 years.

In their May/July 2019 Nesting Survey however, the New York City Bird Alliance was unable to confirm the great blue heron or the green heron as breeding on any of the coastal islands. Some other wading bird species, including black-crowned night-herons, were found to have breeding colonies on South Brother Island; snowy egret and double-crested cormorant were also found nesting there. In fact, &quot;the three largest wader nesting colonies&quot; in the survey included South Brother Island. There was no mention in the report of any significant findings on North Brother Island.

==In popular culture==
In June 2009, North Brother Island was featured in episode 8 (&quot;Armed and Defenseless&quot;) of &quot;Life After People&quot; on the History Channel. It was used as an example of what would happen to structures after 45 years without humans. It was featured in the &quot;Broad City&quot; episode &quot;Working Girls&quot; and was mentioned in the episode &quot;Twaining Day&quot;. It was also featured in the &quot;Unforgettable&quot; episode &quot;The Island&quot;, and it is a location inhabited by women and children in Victor LaValle&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;The Changeling&quot;. North Brother Island was also mentioned as the Enclave base in &quot;Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur&quot; season 1 finale &quot;O.M.G. Issue 2&quot;.

<doc id="1209411" wikidata="Q7828880" url="?curid=1209411" title="Toulminville, Alabama">
<text>Toulminville is a neighborhood of Mobile, Alabama, United States. It began as a small settlement on the property of Harry Theophilus Toulmin, who served as Sheriff of Mobile County in the 1830s. During the American Civil War, Toulminville was mapped along the &quot;Mobile and Ohio Railroad&quot; as a significant settlement, northwest of Mobile (see map). In 1945, the remainder of Toulminville was annexed into the city of Mobile. The area of Toulminville has varied over the past decades from being an upper-middle class suburb to having a serious crime problem during most of the 1980s and 1990s, although the trend has been reversed in recent years.

==Annexation by Mobile==
Toulminville remained a largely rural settlement until after the Civil War, when it slowly took on the character of a suburb to Mobile. It remained largely exurban in character until the 20th century, when growth within the city of Mobile spilled over into Toulminville. Part of Toulminville was annexed into the city of Mobile in the 1920s, and the whole of Toulminville was annexed into the city of Mobile in 1945, in the annexation which tripled the size of Mobile&#x27;s corporate limits. By World War II, Toulminville had become an upper-middle class suburb, with many affluent neighborhoods built along Stanton and Summerville streets.

Professional baseball player Hank Aaron grew up in Toulminville as a young boy.

==White flight==
Suburbanization started after World War II, as highways were built and new houses were built outside the city. Middle and upper-class whites began to move out of the city to newer housing, especially after desegregation following civil rights advances of the 1960s. A perceived upsurge of crime on Mobile&#x27;s north side contributed to this white migration. (In 1986 a white nun was raped and murdered by a black man in a notorious incident at Catholic Cemetery on Stone Street, now Martin Luther King Avenue.) The district was majority white in 1960 and became nearly 80% black by 1975. Toulminville was the heart of the district he was in a Mobile NAACP.

Upper-class neighborhoods along Stanton and Summerville streets retained their white population for some time. In the 1980s they became majority black and retained high property values. While Stanton and Summerville are middle-class areas, most of Toulminville is lower-class. During most of the 1980s and 1990s with its economic and drug problems, this area had a serious crime problem. That trend has reversed due to a concerted effort by the Mobile Police Department and community leaders in Toulminville.

Toulminville was the birthplace of United States Surgeon General William Crawford Gorgas, who worked to control yellow fever and malaria during World War I. Several streets and an elementary school were named after him. Figures Park, named for Senator Michael Figures, an influential African-American politician of the 20th century, was originally named Gorgas Park, in honor of the general. This neighborhood was the adolescent home of baseball legend Hank Aaron.

==Education==
Toulminville is within the Mobile County Public School System. Washington Middle School is in Toulminville.

LeFlore Magnet High School (originally Toulminville High School) is a performing arts magnet school named in honor of John L. LeFlore. Toulminville High School was renamed LeFlore High School in honor of LeFlore. In the 1980s, it was converted into a magnet school, which under Mobile County Public School policy to increase diversity, is ideally to have a 50/50 black white mix. The county is majority white and the school is 98% African-American, making it one of the least diverse schools in the state of Alabama.

<text>DIDO was a materials testing nuclear reactor at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom. It used enriched uranium metal fuel, and heavy water as both neutron moderator and primary coolant. There was also a graphite neutron reflector surrounding the core. In the design phase, DIDO was known as AE334 after its engineering design number.

DIDO was designed to have a high neutron flux, largely to reduce the time required for testing of materials intended for use in nuclear power reactors. This also allowed for the production of intense beams of neutrons for use in neutron diffraction.

DIDO was shut down in 1990 and is under planning for decommissioning.

In all, six DIDO class reactors were constructed based on this design:

*DIDO, first criticality 1956.
*PLUTO, also at Harwell, first criticality 1957.
*HIFAR (Australia), first criticality January 1958.
*Dounreay Materials Testing Reactor (DMTR) at Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment in Scotland, first criticality May 1958.
*DR-3 at Risø National Laboratory (Denmark), first criticality January 1960.
*FRJ-II at Jülich Research Centre (Germany), first criticality 1962.

HIFAR was the last to shut down, in 2007.

<text>Felix Salzer (June 13, 1904 – August 12, 1986) was an Austrian-American music theorist, musicologist and pedagogue. He was one of the principal followers of Heinrich Schenker, and did much to refine and explain Schenkerian analysis after Schenker&#x27;s death.

He was born in Vienna to Max Salzer (a doctor) and Helene Wittgenstein (a daughter of Karl Wittgenstein). He studied musicology with Guido Adler at the University of Vienna, finishing his Ph.D. in 1926 with a dissertation on sonata form in the works of Franz Schubert. At the same time he studied music theory and analysis with Heinrich Schenker and Hans Weisse. In 1939 Salzer emigrated to the United States, and became a citizen in 1945. While in the US he taught at several schools, including the Mannes School of Music where he was the long-time Dean and Queens College of the City University of New York. At Mannes, Salzer was the teacher of Carl Schachter and Adele T. Weiss. While teaching at Mannes, Salzer and Schacter went on to co-author the seminal music theory book: &quot;Counterpoint in Composition.&quot;

His contributions to Schenkerian theory were twofold: first, he brought Schenker&#x27;s ideas to the attention of American music theorists and musicologists, and second, he applied the analytical technique to music outside of the common-practice era music in which Schenker had exclusively worked, particularly to the music of the Renaissance, the Middle Ages, and to some music of the 20th century. Later theorists applied Schenkerian techniques to popular music as well.

Some of the specific refinements Salzer made to Schenkerian theory involve aspects of voice leading, and the differentiation of chords into structural versus contrapuntal categories.

Salzer&#x27;s works include &quot;Structural Hearing&quot; (1952 and 1962), &quot;Counterpoint in Composition: The Study of Voice Leading&quot; (with Carl Schachter, 1969), and the periodical &quot;The Music Forum&quot; (initiated 1967).

Salzer married Hedwig Lindtberg (the sister of Leopold Lindtberg) in 1939. She died on February 29, 2000. They had no children.

<doc id="1209424" wikidata="Q990862" url="?curid=1209424" title="Breadbox">
<text>A breadbox (chiefly American) or a breadbin (chiefly British) is a container for storing bread and other baked goods to keep them fresh. They were a more common household kitchen item until bread started being made commercially with food preservatives and wrapped in plastic. Breadboxes are still used by many people to store commercially purchased bread, but are used more especially by people who bake bread at home. They are usually made of metal, wood or sometimes pottery (pottery breadboxes are also called bread crocks). Old breadboxes can be collectible antiques.

Breadboxes are most commonly big enough to fit one or two average size loaves of bread—up to about 16 inches wide by 8 to 9 inches high and deep (40 cm × 20 cm × 20 cm).

==Working theory==
Stale bread is colloquially called &quot;dry&quot;, but drying and staling are distinct processes. Stale bread can weigh the same as &quot;fresh&quot; bread, indicating almost no loss of water; conversely, bread can be dried out without going stale. Staling is a process of retrogradation, in which the starch transposes to a crystalline form in the presence of the water contained within the bread itself. The process speeds up at cooler temperatures, such as under refrigeration, and thus bread stored at room temperature remains fresher for longer periods than refrigerated bread. Frozen bread, however, traps the moisture as ice, and prevents the staling process.

Breadboxes are thus designed to: 
*keep their contents at room temperature, prolonging edible storage time;
*have a lid loose enough to allow airflow, reducing condensation, which helps to prevent the formation of mold;
*have a lid tight enough to slow the drying process as well as to protect the contents from mice and all other pests, including ants and flies.

==As a saying==
The breadbox is commonly used to describe the size of other objects, a sense that has outlasted its routine use in the kitchen. The query &quot;Is it bigger than a breadbox?&quot; was popularized by Steve Allen on the American game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, where it became a running gag after he initially asked the question in 1953. It remains a popular question in the parlor game &quot;20 Questions&quot;.

<text>Bryant Reeves (born June 8, 1973) is an American former professional basketball player. Reeves spent his entire career with the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Vancouver Grizzlies, playing with the team from 1995 until 2001. He was nicknamed &quot;Big Country&quot; by his college teammate Byron Houston after Reeves was amazed by the size of the United States following his first cross-country airplane flight, having grown up in the small community of Gans, Oklahoma.

==College career==
Standing tall and weighing between , Reeves was an imposing physical presence on the court and was primed to become a dominant center in the NBA. He had a strong collegiate career with Oklahoma State University, where he averaged 21.5 points per game as a senior and led OSU to the 1995 Final Four.

== Professional career ==

=== Vancouver / Memphis Grizzlies (1995–2002) ===
Reeves became the Grizzlies&#x27; first-ever draft choice, selected sixth overall in the 1995 NBA draft.

Reeves played six seasons with the Grizzlies. After averaging 13.3 points per game in a solid rookie season, he averaged 16.2 points per game in the 1996–97 season and was subsequently awarded with a six-year, $61.8 million contract extension. The next season was his best, when he averaged 16.3 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 1.08 blocked shots per game. During that season he scored a career-high 41 points against the Boston Celtics. He was the first and last player to wear #50 before Zach Randolph, whom it was retired in honor of.

After 1998, weight-control problems and injuries began to take a toll on Reeves, and his numbers fell off dramatically. He was still the starting center for the Grizzlies, but his minutes per game dropped, and his field goal percentage dropped significantly. Eventually, after the Grizzlies moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001, Reeves started the season on the injured list due to chronic back pain and was never able to play another game (the only games he played with the team in Memphis were two preseason games). During preseason play in the fall of 2001, Reeves experienced back pain after just two preseason games. On January 29, 2002, the Grizzlies announced Reeves&#x27; retirement from the NBA due to chronic back pain caused by degenerative discs. At the time he was the Grizzlies all-time leader in games played with 395.

==Personal life==
Bryant was the subject of Kathleen Jayme&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Finding Big Country&quot; in 2018. Following his career, Reeves went back to Oklahoma and is now a cattle farmer and a family man, living on a ranch in Sequoyah County. His son Trey was a three year walk on at Oklahoma State, earning a scholarship his final year and was accepted to Harvard Law School.

<doc id="1209441" wikidata="Q4934983" url="?curid=1209441" title="Bobby Estalella (catcher)">
<text>Robert M. Estalella [es-tah-LAY-yah] (born August 23, 1974) is an American former professional baseball catcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1996 to 2004. His name is similar to that of his grandfather, Bobby Estalella (1911 – 1991), a Cuban professional baseball outfielder who played in the big leagues between 1935 and 1949.

==Baseball career==
In nine seasons, Estalella played for the Philadelphia Phillies (1996–1999), San Francisco Giants (2000–2001), New York Yankees (2001), Colorado Rockies (2002–2003), Arizona Diamondbacks (2004) and Toronto Blue Jays (2004). Estalella was a career .216 hitter with 48 home runs and 147 RBI in 310 games.

He was signed by the Cincinnati Reds to a minor league contract before the 2005 season but chose free-agency during spring training. He was signed by the New York Mets to a minor league contract before the 2006 season, but elected free agency as he re-injured his shoulder and elbow before the season began requiring surgery. In Aug 2010 had hip surgery and have been denied the opportunity to rejoin a team after extensive rehab.

Estalella holds the distinction of having hit the most career home runs in MLB history by a player who also had fewer than 200 career hits. (48 HR; 195H)

==BALCO scandal==
Estalella was linked to the BALCO steroids scandal through leaked testimony. On December 13, 2007, he was named in the Mitchell Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation Into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball. On January 29, 2009, it was reported Estalella would not be testifying against Barry Bonds in the federal perjury case against Bonds.

<doc id="1209446" wikidata="Q3218370" url="?curid=1209446" title="Last Action Hero (video game)">
<text>Last Action Hero is a series of action video games based on the 1993 film of the same name. Versions were released for the NES, Super NES, Sega Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear, and MS-DOS. Versions were also planned for the Sega CD and Master System, but ultimately were not released.

A separate version was released on the Amiga and was developed by The Dome. The MS-DOS version was developed by Psygnosis and offers full-motion video cut scenes from the film; the never-released Sega CD version was planned to include this feature as well.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; is based on the film of the same name.

Taking the form of a side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up, in the SNES and Genesis version players have a strict time limit to defeat each level of the game. Every version of the game has the climactic showdown with Mr. Benedict (the movie&#x27;s primary villain), except for the NES, Game Boy, and Game Gear versions. There are two car chase stages: one in Jack Slater&#x27;s &quot;movie&quot; world and another in Danny Madigan&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; world. The NES and Amiga versions however do not feature any car levels.

The NES version has an original element that none of the other versions have: a stage that portrays Danny Madigan&#x27;s &quot;version&quot; of the classic Shakespeare play &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

==Development and release==
&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; was released for seven platforms: Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Sega Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear, Amiga and MS-DOS. None of the versions feature guns or any other weapons. Most of these games were developed by Bits Studios, while the Amiga version was developed by The Dome. Sony Imagesoft published the game across most platforms, and Sony&#x27;s Psygnosis published the Amiga version.

Rich Robinson, executive producer at Sony Imagesoft, oversaw the filming of &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; as well as the development of the game adaptation, to ensure consistency between the two. Sony&#x27;s Columbia Pictures, which produced the film, had an interest in the game throughout its development. Initially, the studio provided the various developers with a script for the film to help form the basis of the game. Columbia also provided stills from the film which helped the game artists. Later, the developers of the Amiga version saw some rough cuts of the film and then made small alterations to their game to keep it faithful to the film.

Versions of the game were planned for the Sega CD and Master System, but these ultimately were not released. The Sega CD version was in development by a team of 11 people, led by producer Steve Riding of Psygnosis. The Sega CD version was to include motion video footage from the film. However, because of limited film footage, the team had to create some of their own footage for the CD version, using Silicon Graphics computers. Regarding the lack of weapons in the game, Riding stated that the film&#x27;s star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, &quot;feels that if children are constantly subjected to these violent images on the screen, they will identify with the violence and project it through to their real lives.&quot; According to Riding, the lack of weapons did not present any major challenges in creating the game.

Development of the Amiga version commenced in July 1993, at which point the Sega CD version was already three months into development. The Sega CD version would be a slightly upgraded version of the Amiga game. As with the other versions of the game, the Amiga developers were restricted from depicting the playable character with any offensive weapons, and therefore chose to make it a beat &#x27;em up game. Tony Parkes, the game&#x27;s producer, said the team used &quot;the comic element that was present throughout the film&quot; and made the entire game &quot;very cartoony in a &#x27;Tom and Jerry&#x27; kind of way.&quot;

The film&#x27;s character of Danny Madigan was excluded as a playable character in the games because Columbia felt that a child in a beat &#x27;em up game would not go over well. The Amiga version was to include a multiplayer option in which a second player could play as Jack Slater&#x27;s daughter Whitney or as an animated cat police officer, both of whom appeared in the film.

In the United States, the Genesis and SNES versions were released on January 26, 1994, coinciding with the home video release of the film. Each copy of the Genesis and SNES versions had an unusually high wholesale price of $60-$70, with a resulting $100 retail price, which was too high for most consumers. As a result, the two game versions were originally only available as rentals for a minimum seven-month period. After the seven-month rental period was up, the two game versions would be repriced for consumer retail.

The Amiga version, released in 1994, is compatible with Amiga 500, Amiga 600, and Amiga 1200 computers.

==Reception==

&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; received negative reviews. &quot;Amiga Action&quot; called the Amiga version &quot;utter trash&quot; and wrote about the beat &#x27;em up gameplay, &quot;It&#x27;s been done a million times before and each one of those million has been better executed than this.&quot; Stephen Bradley of &quot;Amiga Format&quot; criticized the game and the large number of enemy respawns. &quot;The One Amiga&quot; criticized the repetitive gameplay and background scenery, and called it &quot;without a shadow of a doubt, the worst game ever.&quot; The magazine also considered the gameplay simplistic, writing that enemies could be &quot;easily dispatched by simply sidling up to them and holding down the fire button,&quot; sending the player into a &quot;punch-frenzy&quot;. Stuart Campbell of &quot;Amiga Power&quot; had the same complaints about repetitive scenery and the use of the fire button to easily dispatch enemies. Campbell wrote that Psygnosis and The Dome &quot;should be utterly ashamed of themselves&quot; for their involvement in the game.

&quot;Game Players&quot; called the SNES version a &quot;dull, lifeless, and frustration-filled&quot; fighting game. The magazine was also critical of the Game Gear version, writing that it lacked action and would likely only appeal to fans of puzzle video games. In later reviews for the website AllGame, Brett Alan Weiss heavily criticized the Genesis and SNES versions, believing they were rushed through development in order to capitalize on the film.

<text>Theodore Cecil Thompson (12 July 1926 – 19 July 2011) was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.

He was born in County Durham, the son of a mother from Durham, and a Trinidadian His father was a master painter-decorator who had arrived in England as a corporal in the British West Indies Regiment, and was stationed in County Durham, where he met Cec’s mother, a miner’s daughter.

Cec’s father died in Leeds, where he had been contracted to put gold leaf on the walls of Leeds Town Hall, a contract that included a house and relative prosperity. His father’s death at the age of 39 saw his mother return to her family home in the northeast to give birth to Cec before she moved back to Leeds. Alas, through poverty, she was unable to bring up four children alone, and Cec and his siblings were subsequently scattered across England. Cec was fostered in Warminster in Wiltshire, and then spent the rest of his childhood in a series of orphanages in Somerset, Cheshire and the northeast.. His father died before he was born. With his mother, Florence Greenwell, the daughter of a miner, he soon moved to Leeds. With four children, she struggled and he was fostered at a few months old. His childhood was spent in a succession of orphanages.

Thompson took up rugby league when working near Hunslet. In 1951, the rugby commentator Eddie Waring wrote: &quot;If Cec Thompson is not chosen for the Great Britain squad to face New Zealand, the selectors must be racists.&quot; Four years after his potential was spotted by a Hunslet scout, he played for Great Britain in 1951, only the second black player to do so (the first was Roy Fisher). However, his debut in the game with New Zealand was headlined in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; as &quot;Hunslet&#x27;s Darkie one of Britain&#x27;s heroes.&quot; In 1953, he transferred to Workington Town in Cumbria.

All of Thompson&#x27;s games for Hunslet, and in representative matches were as a . For Workington in Cumbria he played 164 games as a , twenty-two as a , and six as a .

Cec Thompson played right- in Workington Town&#x27;s 9–13 defeat by Wigan in the 1958 Challenge Cup Final during the 1957–58 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 10 May 1958.

At Barrow, with the side plagued by injury, he played two games as a second-row against Bramley and Blackpool Borough, to make up the numbers. In the last two years of his career, he was coach of Barrow becoming the second black coach in the sport. In this, he once more followed the lead of Roy Francis.

He was one of the founders of the Student Rugby League in the United Kingdom, when along with Andrew Cudbertson and Jack Abernathy, he founded a team at the Leeds University in 1967.

Thompson built up his own window cleaning business in Workington, and then qualified to teach Economics with a degree from the University of Leeds, and a teaching diploma. Initially he taught at Dinnington Comprehensive School, and then at Chesterfield Grammar School, where he was head of economics and master in charge of rugby. He received an honorary MA degree from Leeds University in 1994 for services to the community, and the freedom of the borough of Allerdale in the Lake District in 2003.

<doc id="1209472" wikidata="Q375280" url="?curid=1209472" title="Héctor Yazalde">
<text>Héctor Casimiro Yazalde (29 May 1946 – 18 June 1997) was an Argentine professional footballer who played as a striker.

Nicknamed &quot;Chirola&quot;, he scored 46 goals in one single season with Sporting CP, being awarded that season&#x27;s European Golden Shoe. He appeared for five other clubs in a 19-year career.

Yazalde was part of the Argentina national team squad at the 1974 World Cup.

==Club career==
Born in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires Province, Yazalde&#x27;s beginnings in football were fortuitous: he was visiting a friend who played with Club Atlético Piraña, an amateur club in the Argentine capital. He asked to join the training session, immediately causing a stirring impression and signing the very day; from there, he moved to Club Atlético Independiente, going on to help the team win two Primera División championships.

Yazalde signed with Sporting CP ahead of the 1971–72 season, helping the Lisbon side to the 1974 Primeira Liga by scoring 46 goals in just 29 games, both a domestic and European record. The following campaign, with the &quot;Lions&quot; finishing third, he netted 30 times, league&#x27;s best and Europe&#x27;s second.

As a prize for the European Golden Shoe, Yazalde received a Toyota car which he sold, then sharing the money with his teammates. After his Portuguese spell, he successively represented Olympique de Marseille, Newell&#x27;s Old Boys and Club Atlético Huracán, retiring in 1981 and becoming a player&#x27;s agent in his country.

==International career==
Yazalde earned ten caps for Argentina, appearing at the 1974 FIFA World Cup where he scored twice in three matches (both against Haiti, 4–1 win).

In spite of having returned to his country intent on being selected for the following tournament, to be held on home soil, and with the promise of Julio Grondona, head of the Argentine Football Association, that he would make the final squad, Yazalde was ultimately not picked and fell into a deep depression.

==Personal life==
Yazalde was the sixth of eight children, and grew up in the same neighbourhood as Diego Maradona. He initially wanted to become a doctor, but as his family did not have the means to support this ambition, he began selling several items on street corners, returning home with his pockets full of small coins (known as &quot;chirolas&quot;, the singular form of the word later becoming his nickname).

Yazalde married Portuguese model/actress Maria do Carmo de Deus on 16 July 1973. Carmen – as he referred to her in Spanish, which stuck – had a brief career in acting in European cult films under the name &quot;Britt Nichols&quot;, but rarely spoke about this stage of her life since marrying the player.

Maria do Carmo came with Yazalde to Argentina to settle down, but the couple separated 14 years later though they never got legally divorced. They had one son, Gonçalo.

==Death==
Yazalde died in Buenos Aires on 18 June 1997, from hemorrhage and heart failure. He was aged 51.

<text>The Golden Palace is an American sitcom television series produced as a sequel to &quot;The Golden Girls,&quot; a continuation without Bea Arthur (though she did guest star in a double episode) that aired on CBS from September 18, 1992, to May 7, 1993. It starred Betty White, Rue McClanahan, Estelle Getty, Cheech Marin, and Don Cheadle. Billy L. Sullivan also co-starred for the first half of its run. Not as popular as its predecessor, the series aired for a single 24-episode season before its cancelation by CBS.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Golden Palace&quot; begins where &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; had ended, in the quartet&#x27;s now-sold Miami house. With Dorothy Zbornak having married and left in the previous series finale, the three remaining housemates (Sophia Petrillo, Rose Nylund, and Blanche Devereaux) invest in The Golden Palace, a Miami hotel that is for sale. The hotel, however, is revealed to have been stripped of all of its personnel in an effort to appear more profitable, leaving only two employees: Roland Wilson, the hotel&#x27;s manager; and Chuy Castillos, the hotel&#x27;s chef. This requires the women to help perform the hotel duties.

The series focuses on the interactions between hotel staff and guests. Celebrity guest stars were frequent, and the series also featured the return of some recurring actors from &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, such as Debra Engle as Rebecca Devereaux, Herb Edelman as Stan Zbornak and Harold Gould as Miles Webber. Bea Arthur reprised her role as Dorothy Zbornak for a two-part storyline in which she visits the hotel to check on her mother.

==Cast==
* Betty White as Rose Nylund
* Rue McClanahan as Blanche Devereaux
* Estelle Getty as Sophia Petrillo
* Don Cheadle as Roland Wilson
* Cheech Marin as Chuy Castillos
* Billy L. Sullivan as Oliver Webb

==Episodes==
==Production==
Bea Arthur had grown tired of starring in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, and chose not to return for an eighth season. As a result, the show was retitled and revamped as a new series, &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, with Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty reprising their roles.

Like the original series, &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; was also created by Susan Harris, who once again served as executive producer alongside Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas. The trio had mixed feelings about the new series, but felt obligated to continue onward for the sake of the cast and crew. Thomas said, &quot;We had been employing a lot of people, so to just pull the plug would have meant ending something that provided a very satisfying life for a lot of people&quot;. White said that she and her &quot;Golden Girls&quot; co-stars were initially skeptical of the new series but, &quot;To our great surprise, we are having a ball. It&#x27;s coming together much better than we had thought&quot;. McClanahan had suggested keeping the original series and adding a fourth roommate to replace Arthur&#x27;s character, but this idea was rejected by the producers.

British comedian Alexei Sayle was originally hired to play the hotel&#x27;s chef, who initially was to be portrayed as Eastern European. Sayle was replaced by Cheech Marin before the pilot was shot. The idea of having a Latino chef as a comic foil to the rest of the cast had originally been proposed at the beginning of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;; the original chef, Coco (portrayed by Charles Levin), appeared in the first episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; but was written out due to concerns about how to work him into later scripts with a cast of four women with strong personalities. With Arthur gone and the core group down to three, the concept was revived. Marin had wanted to branch out into television and away from being typecast as a Los Angeles stoner, and had previously worked on a film project with Witt. Marin was promised a spin-off series for his character in the event that &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; were successful. &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; marked Marin&#x27;s and Don Cheadle&#x27;s first starring roles in a television series. According to Cheadle, the director of photography had trouble with him and White in shared scenes due to their heavily contrasted complexions; White&#x27;s hair and makeup had to be altered to reduce the contrast, ensuring Cheadle was properly lit.

The Carlyle hotel on Miami Beach&#x27;s Ocean Drive was used for exterior shots depicting the Golden Palace hotel, while the rest of the series was taped at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, California. On &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, Getty often had to reshoot her scenes as she had trouble remembering her lines. McClanahan noted that this was not the case on &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, speculating that Getty may have been subconsciously intimidated by Arthur.

===Cancellation and aftermath===
Ratings were initially solid, with the show winning its timeslot for its first few weeks, but viewership fell steadily as the season progressed. A second season was to be greenlit according to McClanahan, but network executives decided to cancel the show a couple of hours before the upfronts. CBS opted not to renew the series, canceling it in May 1993. Harris attributed the series&#x27; failure to Arthur&#x27;s absence, saying it did not work without her.

The show&#x27;s sole season was rated 57th in the rankings, and was canceled alongside &quot;Major Dad&quot; and &quot;Designing Women&quot;.

Following the cancellation, White joined the short-lived second season of &quot;Bob&quot;, which had aired in the same block as &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; for its first season. Getty went on to portray Sophia in the later seasons of another &quot;Golden Girls&quot; spin-off, &quot;Empty Nest&quot;. The character returned to the rebuilt Shady Pines retirement home, which had burned down in the previous series. What became of the characters of Rose, Blanche, Roland, Chuy, and the hotel is left unresolved.

=== Notable episodes ===
In 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter movement and following the murder of George Floyd, the episode &quot;Camp Town Races Aren&#x27;t Nearly as Much Fun as They Used to Be&quot; attracted attention for how it had addressed the issues of racism and the Confederate flag. Journalist Seb Starcevic first drew attention to the episode in a Twitter thread that became popular before the wider media began to pick up the story.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;The Golden Palace&quot; aired on CBS, changing networks from NBC, which had aired &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; on Saturday nights for its entire run. NBC was willing to greenlight a 13-episode order for &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, but the series producers were not satisfied with this number and moved the series to CBS, which promised a full season. NBC had been seeking a younger demographic, and &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; did not fit into its plans. White believed that a new network would be beneficial for the series.

CBS used &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; as one of four comedies assembled on Friday night in an effort to combat ABC&#x27;s TGIF comedy block; &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; was grouped with &quot;Major Dad&quot;, &quot;Designing Women&quot;, and &quot;Bob&quot;, all of which were either successful comedies prior to the move, or in the case of &quot;Bob&quot;, featured a previously successful sitcom star (Bob Newhart).

Syndication of the series is handled by Disney–ABC Domestic Television. Although the series has never been syndicated as a stand-alone series, Lifetime, during the time it owned the rights to &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, carried &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; on several occasions in the mid-2000s, running the series in rotation as a &quot;de facto&quot; eighth season of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. The show&#x27;s existence is generally not well known. According to McClanahan, most &quot;Golden Girls&quot; fans were unaware of the series until reruns began airing on Lifetime.

In recognition of what would have been White&#x27;s 100th birthday, &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; became available on the Hulu streaming platform January 10, 2022.

==Reception==
Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Rick Du Brow stated that Harris &quot;deserves plenty of credit for infusing the premiere of the tired old series with new verve, drive and wit in its resuscitated form&quot;. The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; wrote that the premise &quot;seemed like one of the worst ideas of the year,&quot; but found that the premiere episode &quot;crackles with the same energy that marked the early years of The Golden Girls,&quot; writing further, &quot;The change of scenery, plus fresh chemistry created by the addition of new characters, relieves the numbing sense of deja vu that settled over the characters&quot; in the final seasons of the previous series.

However, John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s all a bit too familiar, and the format is forced into some unseemly stretching&quot;. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave a mixed review of the pilot episode but praised White&#x27;s performance, writing &quot;she seems faster and fresher than ever. Arthur&#x27;s absence is felt (and duly noted in a sly joke or two), but without Betty White, this is one show that clearly could not go on.&quot;

Several critics praised the series after it debuted on Hulu. Robert Lloyd, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, applauded the cast &quot;even if they are playing in a sequel to a show people remember better and love more&quot;. Eliot Glazer of Vulture.com considered the cast to have &quot;undeniable&quot; chemistry despite the absence of Arthur. Megan McCaffrey of Collider wrote that the series &quot;takes the groundwork laid by the original and runs with it into a successful spinoff&quot;. Conversely, &quot;TVLine&quot; ranked it as the 20th worst television spinoff ever.

<doc id="1209484" wikidata="Q4769025" url="?curid=1209484" title="Annesley Malewana">
<text>Annesley Malewana () (Sinhala: ඇනස්ලි මාලේවන) is a Sri Lankan musician. Often considered &quot;The Para Balla of Sinhala Pop&quot;, Malewana is well known for being a master of contemporary Baila worked with popular musical bands The Moonstones and Super Golden Chimes.

==Personal life==
Malewana was born on 13 June 1947, in Ratnapura, Sri Lanka and attended St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Colombo.

He is married to Swarnamali and the couple has one son and one daughter.

==Musical career==
Upon leaving school, he met Clarence Wijewardena, and the two formed the group Moonstones in 1966. In the early 1960s, the Moonstones began performing songs composed by Wijewardena and sung by Malewana. Their first hit was &quot;Mango Nanda&quot;, a song written about the maid who once worked at the home of Clarence&#x27;s wife in the early days of their relationship.

The Moonstones were managed by the advertising man Sri Sangabo Corea and were mentored by the Radio Ceylon broadcaster Vernon Corea and his cousin Vijaya Corea. They first featured on a program called &quot;Saturday Star&quot; on Radio Ceylon. Their music was featured for the very first time on the English Services of Radio Ceylon and subsequently the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. They became household names as a result of the airplay on Radio Ceylon throughout the 1960s. After few years, Wijewardena formed &quot;Golden Chimes&quot; and left &quot;The Moonstones&quot;. However, later all reunited again and formed the band &quot;Super Golden Chimes&quot;. The band produced many popular songs such as &quot;Udarata Niliya&quot; and &quot;Gamen liyumak&quot;.

During the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the songs of the &#x27;Moonstones&#x27; and the &#x27;Super Golden Chimes&#x27; were on the top of popularity. His songs topped the charts on both the English Service and the Sinhala Service on Radio Ceylon for decades. In 1977, he got a job at a Private company and temporarily left the band.

Malewana and Wijewardena remained friends and reunited in the 1970s to form a group dubbed the &quot;Super Golden Chimes&quot; - this group would, similarly, produce a string of popular songs that included &quot;Udarata Niliya&quot;, &quot;Sihina Pathum&quot;, &quot;Wana Bambaro&quot;, and &quot;Sathuta Senasuma&quot;. The Super Golden Chimes performed for another eight years until, in 1978, Malewana married, and announced his retirement from music. Despite his retirement, Malewana returned in 1988 as a solo artist and continued to record songs, particularly for CDs released in Sri Lanka. In 2005 he formed the band &quot;Annesley &amp; The Super Chimes&quot;. His song &quot;Kageda Gon Wassa&quot; was censored between 1970 and 1977 by the prevailed government because people started hinting at the government with this song. In 1984, he made playback singing with the film &quot;Shirani&quot; directed by M. H. Gafoor.

On 27 July 2013, he organised a musical show &quot;Sing Along with Annesley Malewana&quot; at Hotel Taj Samudra Rooftop as a fundraiser for Lion Sight First Hospital. On 6 August 2016, Malewana celebrated 50 years of his singing career with a grand musical show titled ‘50 Year Reflection’ which was held at the BMICH at 7 pm.

==Controversy==
In 2009, Wijewardena&#x27;s wife and daughter filed a case against Malewana by citing that Clarence&#x27;s songs were sung without permission. They said some of the songs such as &quot;Kalu Mama&quot;, &quot;Goyam Kapanawa&quot;, &quot;Rosa Male&quot; and &quot;Sudu Menike&quot; were first claimed to be theirs. Then they made a list of about 27 songs and told Malewana that he had no right to sing them. But those songs have been sold to Wickramasooriya and company. In the same contracts that were sold Malewana have signed for &quot;Moonstone&quot; and &quot;Super Golden Chimes&quot;. The summons, in this case, was handed over on December 23, 2010. An enjoining order had been imposed so that not a single song could be sung. However, his innocence has been proved justified in court.

==Legacy==
The songs performed by Malewana and Clarence over their three decades have recently been credited, by the group Pahan Silu, as having served to influence them in crafting their unique musical style.

His voice has been heard by Londoners over BBC Radio London 206 on the London Sounds Eastern radio program and on community radio in the United States and in Australia.

<doc id="1209509" wikidata="Q739627" url="?curid=1209509" title="Pennsylvania State University">
<text>The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State or PSU) is a public state-related land-grant research university with campuses and facilities throughout Pennsylvania, United States. Founded in 1855 as Farmers&#x27; High School of Pennsylvania, Penn State was named the state&#x27;s first land-grant university eight years later, in 1863. Its primary campus, known as Penn State University Park, is located in State College and College Township.

In addition to its land-grant designation, the university is a sea-grant, space-grant, and one of only six sun-grant universities. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU). The university has two law schools: Penn State Law on the school&#x27;s University Park campus and Penn State Dickinson Law in Carlisle. The College of Medicine is in Hershey. The university maintains 19 commonwealth campuses and five special mission campuses located across Pennsylvania.

The university competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the NCAA for most of its athletic teams, known collectively as the Penn State Nittany Lions. Since its founding, Penn State has won 82 national collegiate team championships, including 54 NCAA titles across all sports, and Penn State students, alumni, faculty, and coaches have won a total of 74 Olympic medals, including 20 gold medals.

== History ==
===19th century===
Pennsylvania State University was founded in 1855 when James Irvin, a U.S. Congressman from Bellefonte, donated of land in Centre County to the newly-established Farmers High School of Pennsylvania, representing the first of the school eventually acquired.

The same year, on February 22, the Pennsylvania General Assembly designated the school a degree-granting institution. Initially sponsored by the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society, the use of &quot;college&quot; or &quot;university&quot; was avoided in the school&#x27;s naming since local Pennsylvanians perceived that such institutions were impractical in their curricula.

In 1862, the school&#x27;s name was changed to the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania. The following year, in 1863, the Morrill Land-Grant Acts was passed by the U.S. Congress, and Pennsylvania selected the school to be the state&#x27;s sole land-grant college. Two years later, in 1874, the school&#x27;s name was changed to the Pennsylvania State College.

By 1875, enrollment fell to 64 undergraduates, and the school attempted to balance its primary focus on agricultural studies with classic education. In 1882, George W. Atherton was named the school&#x27;s president; Atherton set about broadening the curriculum beyond its agricultural focus.

The school developed an engineering studies program that immediately became one of the nation&#x27;s ten largest engineering schools.

A major road in State College was later named in Atherton&#x27;s honor. Penn State&#x27;s Atherton Hall, a well-furnished and centrally located residence hall, was named after George Atherton&#x27;s wife, Frances Washburn Atherton.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, Penn State grew significantly, becoming the largest grantor of baccalaureate degrees in Pennsylvania. In 1936, its enrollment reached 5,000. Around this time, Ralph D. Hetzel, the school&#x27;s president, established a commonwealth of colleges to provide an alternative for Depression-era students who were economically unable to leave home to attend college.

In 1953, President Milton S. Eisenhower, the brother of then-U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, sought and won permission to elevate the school to university status, and it assumed its current name, The Pennsylvania State University. Under Eisenhower&#x27;s successor, Eric A. Walker, the university acquired hundreds of acres of surrounding land, and enrollment nearly tripled.

In 1967, the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, a college of medicine and hospital, was established in Hershey with a $50 million gift from the Hershey Trust Company.

In 1970s, the university became a state-related institution, leading to its membership in the Commonwealth System of Higher Education. In 1975, the lyrics in the Penn State Alma Mater were revised to be gender-neutral in honor of International Women&#x27;s Year; the revised lyrics were taken from the posthumously published autobiography of the writer of the original lyrics, Fred Lewis Pattee. Professor Patricia Farrell acted as a spokesperson for those who wanted the change.

In 1989, the Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport became affiliated with the university.
===21st century===
In 2000, Dickinson School of Law joined the Pennsylvania College of Technology in affiliating with the university. The university is now the largest in Pennsylvania, and in 2003, it was credited with having the second-largest impact on the state economy of any organization, generating an economic effect of over $17 billion on a budget of $2.5 billion. To offset the lack of funding due to the limited growth in state appropriations to Penn State, the university has concentrated its efforts on philanthropy (2003 marked the end of the Grand Destiny campaign—a seven-year effort that raised over $1.3 billion).

====Child sex abuse scandal====

In 2011, the university and its football program garnered international media attention and criticism in a sex abuse scandal in which university officials were alleged to have covered up incidents of child sexual abuse by former football team defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. Athletic director Timothy Curley and Gary Schultz, senior vice president for finance and business, were indicted for perjury. In the wake of the scandal, Coach Joe Paterno was fired and school president Graham B. Spanier was forced to resign by the board of trustees. Sandusky, who maintained his innocence, was indicted and subsequently convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts for the abuse.

A subcommittee of the board of trustees engaged former FBI director Louis Freeh to head an independent investigation on the university&#x27;s handling of the incidents. Freeh released his findings in July 2012, concluding that Paterno, Spanier, Curley, and Schultz &quot;conceal[ed] Sandusky&#x27;s activities from the board of trustees, the university community and authorities&quot; and &quot;failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade&quot;.

On July 23, 2012, the National Collegiate Athletic Association levied sanctions against Penn State for its role in the scandal, penalizing the Penn State football program with a $60 million fine, a ban from bowl games and post-season play for four years, reducing its scholarships from 25 to 15 annually for four years, vacating of all Penn State football wins from 1998 to 2011, and placing the program on a five-year probationary period.

Following imposition of the NCAA sanctions, emails surfaced indicating that high-level NCAA officials did not believe they had the jurisdiction to pass down the original sanctions. Subsequent emails, brought forward under subpoena, quoted an NCAA vice president, who wrote, &quot;I characterized our approach to PSU as a bluff when talking to Mark [Emmert, NCAA president]...He basically agreed [because] I think he understands that if we made this an enforcement issue, we may win the immediate battle but lose the war.&quot;

On September 8, 2014, following a report by former U.S. Senator and athletics integrity monitor George J. Mitchell citing progress by Penn State in implementing reforms, the NCAA repealed the sanctions. On January 16, 2015, all previous Penn State football records were restored.

An investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who the Paterno family retained to review the Freeh report, concluded that the report that placed so much blame on Penn State and Paterno was a &quot;rush to injustice&quot; that could not be relied upon. He found that not only did the evidence &quot;fall far short&quot; of showing Paterno attempted to conceal the Sandusky scandal, but rather that &quot;the contrary is true&quot;.

In November 2014, Pennsylvania State Senator Jake Corman released further emails that showed &quot;regular and substantive&quot; contact between NCAA officials and Freeh&#x27;s investigators, suggesting that Freeh&#x27;s conclusions were orchestrated.

====Death of Timothy Piazza====

On February 2, 2017, Timothy Piazza, a pledge of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity located off-campus in State College, died while undergoing hazing activities at the fraternity. Eighteen members of Penn State&#x27;s Beta Theta Pi fraternity were initially charged in connection with Piazza&#x27;s death, and the fraternity was closed and banned indefinitely. In July 2024, the fraternity president and vice president &amp; pledge master each pleaded guilty to 14 misdemeanor counts of hazing and a misdemeanor count of recklessly endangering another person.

== Campuses ==
=== University Park ===

The largest of the university&#x27;s 24 campuses, Penn State University Park is located in State College and College Township in Centre County, in central Pennsylvania. Its dedicated ZIP Code is 16802. With an undergraduate acceptance rate of 49 percent, it is the most selective campus in the Penn State system. The university ranks among the most selective schools in Pennsylvania, according to various publications. During the fall 2018 semester, 40,363 undergraduate students and 5,907 graduate students were enrolled at University Park. Of those, 46.5 percent were female and 42.4 percent were non-Pennsylvania residents.

The University Park campus is centrally located at the junction of Interstate 99/U.S. Route 220 and U.S. Route 322, and is due south of Interstate 80. Before the arrival of the Interstates, University Park was a short distance from the Lock Haven – Altoona branch line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The last run of long-distance trains from Buffalo or Harrisburg through Lock Haven was in 1971. Today, the nearest Amtrak passenger rail access is in Tyrone, 25 miles to the southwest. Intercity bus service to University Park is provided by Fullington Trailways, Greyhound Lines, Megabus, and OurBus. The State College Regional Airport, serving two regional airlines, is near University Park.

=== Commonwealth campuses ===

In addition to the University Park campus, 19 campus locations throughout the commonwealth of Pennsylvania offer enrollment for undergraduate students. Over 60 percent of Penn State first-year students begin their education at a location other than University Park. Each of the 19 commonwealth campuses offer a unique set of degree programs based on the student demographics. Any student in good academic standing is guaranteed a spot at University Park to finish his or her degree if required or desired, known as &quot;change of campus&quot; or, more accurately, &quot;the 2+2 program&quot;; where a Penn State student may start at any Penn State campus, including University Park, for two years and finish at any Penn State the final two years.

=== Special mission campuses and World Campus ===

* Dickinson Law, founded in 1834 as The Dickinson School of Law in Carlisle, is the oldest law school in Pennsylvania and the fifth-oldest in the country. Since its founding, its graduates have included several notable attorneys, judges, government and corporate leaders, and legal educators. Dickinson School of Law&#x27;s 1997 merger with Penn State was completed in 2000. It expanded its reputation, network, and joint degree programs complementing Dickinson Law&#x27;s legacy as an innovative leader in experiential education. In 2006, a second law campus was opened at University Park. In 2014, the law school was split into two separately accredited law schools: Dickinson Law in Carlisle and Penn State Law in University Park. The last students to attend the dual-campus Penn State Dickinson School of Law graduated in May 2017.
* Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies in Malvern, is a special mission campus offering master&#x27;s degrees, graduate certification, and continuing professional education. It also offers classes at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.
* Penn State University College of Medicine in Hershey, is the university&#x27;s medical school and teaching hospital. Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center became the ninth hospital in the United States and 16th worldwide to implant the CardioWest temporary Total Artificial Heart when a 60-year-old man suffering from end-stage heart failure received the device in May 2008.
* Pennsylvania College of Technology, in Williamsport, which became an affiliate of the university in 1989, offers degrees and certificates in over ten technical fields.

==== World Campus ====

In 1998, the university launched Penn State World Campus, or Penn State Online, which offers more than 60 online education programs, degrees, and certificates. Distance education has a long history at Penn State, one of the first universities in the country to offer a correspondence course for remote farmers in 1892. Examples of online programs include an MBA, a master of professional studies in homeland security, a Bachelor of Science in nursing, and post-baccalaureate certificates in geographic information systems and applied behavior analysis.

== Organization and administration ==
Penn State is a state-related university and a member of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Commonwealth System of Higher Education. While it receives funding from the Commonwealth and is connected to the state through its board of trustees, however, it is otherwise independent and not subject to any direct control by the state. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania.

=== Colleges ===

Penn State has eighteen colleges, including three at special-mission campuses. The University Park campus is organized into fourteen distinct colleges, plus the graduate school and the division of undergraduate studies:

The university&#x27;s board of trustees voted in January 2007 to create a school of international affairs, with the first classes admitted in the fall 2008 semester. The school is part of Penn State Law.

Formerly the school of nursing, on September 25, 2013, the board of trustees granted the nursing program college status.

=== Board of trustees ===

The 32-member board of trustees governs the university. Its members include the university&#x27;s president, the Governor of the Commonwealth, and the state Secretaries of Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and Education. The other members include six trustees appointed by the Governor, nine elected by alumni, and six elected by Pennsylvania agricultural societies. Six additional trustees are elected by a board representing business and industry enterprises. Undergraduate students do not elect any trustees; the court case &quot;Benner v. Oswald&quot; ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the selection of trustees.

, the chair of the board of trustees is Keith E. Masser, a graduate of Penn State and the chairman and chief executive officer of Sterman Masser, Inc.

The board&#x27;s main responsibilities are to select the president of Penn State, determine the goals and strategic direction of the university, and approve the annual budget. Regular meetings of the board are held bi-monthly and take place primarily on the University Park campus, although on occasion meetings are held at other locations within the Commonwealth.

=== Administration ===
The university president is selected by the board and is given the authority for actual control of the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, part of this responsibility is delegated by the president to other administrative departments, the faculty, and the student body. Neeli Bendapudi became the university&#x27;s 19th and current president on May 9, 2022, upon the departure of Eric J. Barron. The executive vice president and provost is the chief academic officer of the university. The current provost, Nicholas P. Jones, assumed office on July 1, 2013.

=== Student government ===

Penn State has a long history of student governance. Elected student leaders remain directly involved in the decision-making of the university administration, as provided for in the board of trustees&#x27; standing orders. There are four student governments recognized by the university administration: the University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA), the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG), and the World Campus Student Government Association (WCSGA).

The University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA) is the representative student government of the undergraduate students at Penn State&#x27;s University Park campus, which was established in 2006 after the former student government, Undergraduate Student Government (USG), lost its recognition by way of a student referendum. Graduate and professional students at the university are represented by the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), the oldest continuously existing student governance organization at Penn State.

The 19 commonwealth campuses of the university are governed by the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG), formerly known as the Council of Branch Campus Student Governments (CBCSG).

In 2019, the World Campus Student Government Association (WCSGA) was formed to advocate for the interests and concerns of the more than 20,000 Penn State World Campus students.

According to the National Science Foundation, Penn State spent $971 million on research and development in 2021, ranking it 26th in the nation.

The Applied Research Lab (ARL), located near the University Park campus, has been a research partner with the United States Department of Defense since 1945 and conducts research primarily in support of the United States Navy. It is the largest component of Penn State&#x27;s research efforts statewide, with over 1,000 researchers and other staff members.

The Materials Research Institute (MRI) was created to coordinate the highly diverse and growing materials activities across Penn State&#x27;s University Park campus. With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments,four colleges, and two Department of Defense research laboratories,

MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial, and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM), which supported many faculty and students from the college of earth and mineral science, the Eberly College of Science, the college of engineering, the materials research laboratory and the applied research laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in creating the Materials Research Institute, and the establishment of Penn State as an acknowledged leader among major universities in materials education and research.

The university was one of the founding members of the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN), a partnership that includes 17 research-led universities in the United States, Asia, and Europe. The network provides funding, facilitates collaboration between universities, and coordinates exchanges of faculty members and graduate students among institutions. Former Penn State president Graham Spanier is a former vice-chair of the WUN.

Pennsylvania State University Libraries were ranked 14th among research libraries in North America in the 2003–2004 survey released by &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;. The university&#x27;s library system began with a 1,500-book two-room library in Old Main, but moved to its own space – Carnegie Library (named after college trustee Andrew Carnegie) – ten years later. In 2009, its holdings had grown to 5.2 million volumes, in addition to 500,000 maps, five million microforms, and 180,000 films and videos. The university is a member of the Center for Research Libraries.

The university&#x27;s College of Information Sciences and Technology is the home of CiteSeerX, an open-access repository and search engine for scholarly publications. The university is also the host to the Radiation Science &amp; Engineering Center, which houses the oldest operating university research reactor. Additionally, University Park houses the Graduate Program in Acoustics, the only freestanding acoustics program in the United States. The university also houses the Center for Medieval Studies, a program that was founded to research and study the European Middle Ages, and the Center for the Study of Higher Education (CSHE), one of the first centers established to research postsecondary education. It is a member of the CDIO Initiative, an international network of universities working to develop unique teaching methods in engineering. The university is also a member of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, an organization of hundreds of leading universities dedicated to researching atmosphere and climatology.

== Student life ==
=== Student demographics ===

As of fall 2010, the racial makeup of the Penn State system including all campuses and special-mission colleges, was 75.4 percent white, 5.5 percent black, 4.3 percent Asian, 4.4 percent Hispanic, 0.2 percent Native American, 0.1 percent Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 1.7 percent two or more races, 5.8 percent international students and 3.1 percent of an unknown race. Over the period 2000–2010, minority enrollment as a percentage of total enrollments has risen 5.3 percentage points,&lt;ref name=&quot;Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while minorities as a percentage of total teaching positions rose 2.0 percentage points from 1997 to 2002.

Penn State has been the subject of controversy for several issues of discrimination. Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main. They demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus and the local community. After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State&#x27;s Telecommunications building on campus. The following morning, 50 state troopers and 45 local and campus police, equipped with helmets, batons, and rubber gloves, entered the building as the crowd outside sang &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, arresting 89 individuals for trespassing. All charges were later dismissed.

In 1990, a vice provost for educational equity was appointed to lead a five-year strategic plan to &quot;create an environment characterized by equal access and respected participation for all groups and individuals irrespective of cultural differences.&quot; Since then, discrimination issues include the handling of death threats in 1992 and 2001, controversy around LGBT issues, and the investigation of a 2006 sexual discrimination lawsuit filed by former Lady Lions basketball player Jennifer Harris, alleging that head coach Rene Portland dismissed her from the team in part due to her perceived sexual orientation.

=== Housing ===
There are seven housing complexes on campus for students attending the University Park campus: East Halls, North Halls, Pollock Halls, South Halls, West Halls, Eastview Terrace, and Nittany Apartments.

==== THON ====

Annually in February, thousands of students participate in the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon (THON), the largest student-run philanthropy in the world. Every year, participants stand for 46 hours nonstop and perform a line dance at least once every hour to stay alert alongside other events hosted throughout the weekend such as concerts, games, athlete hour, family hour, and a tribute to all of the children with cancer. In 2007, THON was moved to the Bryce Jordan Center and shortened from 48 to 46 hours, due to potential conflicts with basketball games. THON raises millions of dollars annually for childhood cancer care and research for its sole beneficiary, Four Diamonds. In 2025, THON raised a program record of $17.7 million.

This program, initiated by then-President Graham Spanier in 1997, has since been instituted on several other universities across the country.

== Athletics ==

Penn State&#x27;s mascot is the Nittany Lion, a representation of a type of mountain lion that once roamed what is now University Park. The school&#x27;s official colors, now blue and white, were originally black and dark pink. Originally introduced back when athletics were introduced at Penn State, this was changed in 1890 after the pink faded to white and to avoid ridicule from opposing teams. Pink and black still will make periodic appearances at athletic events in the modern era as a special student &quot;S&quot; section during certain games. Penn State participates in NCAA&#x27;s Division I FBS for football and in the Big Ten Conference for most sports.

Two sports participate in different conferences: men&#x27;s volleyball in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA) and women&#x27;s hockey in College Hockey America (CHA). The fencing teams operate as independents.

Penn State athletic teams have claimed a total of 82 national collegiate team championships since the university&#x27;s founding, including 54 NCAA, two consensus Division I football titles, six AIAW, three USWLA, one WIBC, four national titles in boxing, 11 in men&#x27;s soccer, and one in wrestling in years prior to NCAA sponsorship. The university ranks fifth all-time in NCAA championships in NCAA Division I, and first among Big Ten schools.

Since joining the Big Ten in 1991, Penn State teams have won 124 conference regular season and tournament titles, through June, 2023.

Penn State has one of the most successful overall athletic programs in the country, evidenced by its rankings in the NACDA Director&#x27;s Cup, a list compiled by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics that charts institutions&#x27; overall success in college sports. From the Cup&#x27;s inception in the 1993–1994 season, the Nittany Lions have finished in the top 25 every year.

Penn State is best known for its football team, which enjoys a large following. With an official capacity of 106,572, Penn State&#x27;s Beaver Stadium has the second-largest seating capacity after Michigan Stadium and the fourth-largest globally.

From 1966 to 2011, the Penn State football team was led by Coach Joe Paterno, who was in a close competition with Bobby Bowden, head coach for Florida State, for the most wins ever in Division I-A, which is now the FBS. Paterno still led in total wins at the time of Bowden&#x27;s retirement following the 2010 Gator Bowl. In 2007, Paterno was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

Paterno amassed 409 victories over his career, the most in NCAA Division I history. Paterno died on January 22, 2012, at the age of 85. Paterno was posthumously honored by Penn State during the September 17, 2016 football game that marked the 50th anniversary of his first game as head coach.

<text>Pemphigus ( or ) is a rare group of blistering autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes. The name is derived from the Greek root &quot;pemphix&quot;, meaning &quot;blister&quot;.

In pemphigus, autoantibodies form against desmoglein, which forms the &quot;glue&quot; that attaches adjacent epidermal cells via attachment points called desmosomes. When autoantibodies attack desmogleins, the cells become separated from each other and the epidermis becomes detached, a phenomenon called acantholysis. This causes blisters that slough off and turn into sores. In some cases, these blisters can cover a large area of the skin.

Originally, the cause of this disease was unknown, and &quot;pemphigus&quot; was used to refer to any blistering disease of the skin and mucosa. In 1964, researchers found that the blood of patients with pemphigus contained antibodies to the layers of skin that separate to form the blisters. In 1971, an article investigating the autoimmune nature of this disease was published.

==Types==
The several types of pemphigus (pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis, and paraneoplastic pemphigus) vary in severity. Skin lesions caused by pemphigus can lead to fatal infections, so treatment is extremely important.

*Pemphigus vulgaris (PV - ICD-10 L10.0) is the most common form of the disorder and occurs when antibodies attack desmoglein 3. Sores often originate in the mouth, making eating difficult and uncomfortable. Although PV may occur at any age, it is most common among people between 40 and 60. It is more frequent among Ashkenazi Jews. Rarely, it is associated with myasthenia gravis. Nail disease may be the only finding and has prognostic value in management.
* Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is the least severe variety. Desmoglein 1, the protein that is targeted by the autoantibodies, is enriched in the upper skin layers. PF is characterized by crusty sores that often begin on the scalp, and may move to the chest, back, and face. Mouth sores do not occur. This form is also frequent among Ashkenazi Jews. It is not as painful as PV, and is often misdiagnosed as dermatitis or eczema PF is endemic in Brazil and Tunisia.
*Intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis is characterized histologically by intraepidermal bullae with neutrophils, some eosinophils, and acantholysis.
* The least common and most severe type of pemphigus is paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP). This disorder is a complication of cancer, usually lymphoma or Castleman&#x27;s disease. It may precede the diagnosis of the tumor. Painful sores appear on the mouth, lips, and the esophagus. In this variety of pemphigus, the disease process often involves the lungs, causing bronchiolitis obliterans (constrictive bronchiolitis). Though much less frequent, it is still found the most in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Complete removal of and/or cure of the tumor may improve the skin disease, but lung damage is generally irreversible.
*Endemic pemphigus foliaceus includes fogo selvagem, the new variant of endemic pemphigus foliaceus in El Bagre, Colombia, and the Tunisian endemic pemphigus in North Africa.

Hailey-Hailey disease, also called familial benign pemphigus, is an inherited skin disease, not an autoimmune disease, so it is not considered part of the pemphigus group of diseases.

==Diagnosis==
Pemphigus defines a group of autoimmune intraepithelial blistering diseases that are characterized by loss of normal cell-cell adhesion (acantholysis), and by the presence of pathogenic (predominantly IgG) autoantibodies reacting against epithelial adhesion molecules. Pemphigus is further divided in two major subtypes: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). However, several other disorders such as IgA pemphigus, IgE pemphigus, pemphigus herpetiformis, drug-induced pemphigus, Senear Usher syndrome, and endemic pemphigus foliaceus exist, and are recognized by a dermatologist from the appearance and distribution of the skin lesions. It is also commonly diagnosed by specialists practicing otolaryngology- head and neck surgery, periodontists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and eye doctors, as lesions can affect the eyes and mucous membranes of the oral cavity. Intraorally, it resembles the more common diseases lichen planus and mucous membrane pemphigoid. Definitive diagnosis requires examination of a skin or mucous membrane biopsy by a dermatopathologist or oral pathologist. The skin biopsy is taken from the edge of a blister, prepared for histopathology and examined with a microscope. The pathologist looks for an intraepidermal vesicle caused by the breaking apart of epidermal cells (acantholysis). Thus, the superficial (upper) portion of the epidermis sloughs off, leaving the bottom layer of cells on the &quot;floor&quot; of the blister. This bottom layer of cells is said to have a &quot;tombstone&quot; appearance.

Definitive diagnosis also requires the demonstration of antidesmoglein autoantibodies by direct immunofluorescence on the skin biopsy. These antibodies appear as IgG deposits along the desmosomes between epidermal cells, a pattern reminiscent of chicken wire. Antidesmoglein antibodies can also be detected in a blood sample using the ELISA technique.

=== Classification ===

Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering diseases that may be classified into these types:
:* Pemphigus vulgaris
:* Pemphigus vegetans
:*Pemphigus vegetans of Hallopeau
:*Pemphigus vegetans of Neumann
:* Pemphigus foliaceus, of which there several forms:
:* Pemphigus erythematosus or Senear–Usher Syndrome
:* Endemic pemphigus foliaceus with its three variants, Fogo Selvagem, the new variant endemic pemphigus Foliaeus and Tunisian endemic pemphigus foliaceus
:* Paraneoplastic pemphigus
:* IgA pemphigus, of which there several forms:
:* Subcorneal pustular dermatosis
:* Intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis
:*Drug induced pemphigus

==Treatment==
If not treated, pemphigus can be fatal, usually from overwhelming opportunistic infection of lesions. The most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids, especially prednisone, often in high doses. The side effects of corticosteroids may require the use of so-called steroid-sparing or adjuvant drugs. One of the most dangerous side effects of high-dosage steroid treatments is intestinal perforations, which may lead to sepsis. Steroids and other medications being taken to treat pemphigus may also mask the effects of the perforations. Patients on high dosages of oral steroids should closely monitor their gastrointestinal health. As lesions are usually terribly painful, pain medication likely complicates and exacerbates the gastrointestinal issues caused by steroids.

=== Treatment options ===

* Topical steroids, such as clobetasol
* Intralesional injection of steroids, such as dexamethasone
* Immunosuppressant drugs, such as CellCept (mycophenolic acid): In recent years, adjuvant drugs, especially biologics, have shown great promise.
* Serum- or plasma-pooled products, such as intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) may be useful in severe cases, especially paraneoplastic pemphigus. 
* Biologics such as Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, which was found to improve otherwise severe cases of recalcitrant pemphigus vulgaris. Currently rituximab is considered a first-line treatment for some pemphigus patients according to Delphi consensus recommendations 
All of these drugs may cause severe side effects, so patients should be closely monitored by doctors. Once the outbreaks are under control, dosage is often reduced, to lessen side effects.

A meta-analysis of the literature found insufficient evidence to determine the optimal treatment regimen for pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, but it found that adding cyclophosphamid and azathioprine to a glucocorticoid regimen reduced the amount of glucocorticoid needed for treatment, and topical epidermal growth factor significantly reduced lesion healing time.

If skin lesions do become infected, antibiotics may be prescribed. Tetracycline antibiotics have a mildly beneficial effect on the disease and are sometimes enough for pemphigus foliaceus. In addition, talcum powder is helpful to prevent oozing sores from adhering to bedsheets and clothes. Wound care and treatments are often akin to those used in burn units, including careful use of dressings that don&#x27;t stick to the wounds, etc.

If paraneoplastic pemphigus is diagnosed with pulmonary disease, a powerful cocktail of immunosuppressant drugs is sometimes used in an attempt to halt the rapid progression of bronchiolitis obliterans, including methylprednisolone, ciclosporin, azathioprine, and thalidomide. Plasmapheresis may also be useful.

New research shows that the treatment options and clinical management of pemphigus are advancing, and new B-cell-targeted-therapies are beginning to replace the broad-spectrum immunosuppression treatments. While promising, these new therapies may have significant side effects; hence, supporting research and extensive trials are needed to verify their effectiveness and safety.

==Animals affected==
Pemphigus foliaceus has been recognized in pet dogs, cats, and horses, and is the most common autoimmune skin disease diagnosed in veterinary medicine. PF in animals produces clusters of small vesicles that quickly evolve into pustules. Pustules may rupture, forming erosions or become crusted. Left untreated, PF in animals is life-threatening, leading to not only loss of condition, but also secondary infection.

PV is a very rare disorder described in pet dogs and cats. Paraneoplastic pemphigus has been identified in pet dogs.

<doc id="1209524" wikidata="Q7818625" url="?curid=1209524" title="Tomb of Jesus">
<text>According to the gospel accounts, Jesus was buried in a tomb which originally belonged to Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy man who, believing Jesus was the Messiah, offered his own sepulcher for the burial of Jesus. Possible locations for the tomb of Jesus include the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Garden Tomb.

== Church of the Holy Sepulchre ==

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a church in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. It contains, according to traditions dating back to the fourth century, the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, at a place known as Calvary (or Golgotha), and Jesus&#x27;s empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.

The marble covering protecting the original limestone slab upon which Jesus was thought to have been laid by Joseph of Arimathea was temporarily removed for restoration and cleaning on October 26, 2016. This is just one of several arguments supporting the identification of tomb of Jesus at this site.

== In the Apocrypha ==
Within the apocryphal text known as the Gospel of Peter, the tomb of Jesus is called &quot;Joseph&#x27;s garden&quot;.

== Other locations ==

===The Garden Tomb===

The Garden Tomb is a rock-cut tomb in Jerusalem, which was unearthed in 1867 and is considered by some Protestants to be the tomb of Jesus. The tomb has been dated by Israeli archaeologist Gabriel Barkay to the 8th–7th centuries BC.

===Talpiot Tomb===
The Talpiot Tomb (or Talpiyot Tomb) is a rock-cut tomb discovered in 1980 in the East Talpiot neighborhood, five kilometers (three miles) south of the Old City in East Jerusalem. It contained ten ossuaries, six inscribed with epigraphs, including one interpreted as &quot;Yeshua bar Yehosef&quot; (&quot;Jeshua, son of Joseph&quot;), although the inscription is partially illegible, and its translation and interpretation is widely disputed. It is widely believed by scholars that the Jesus in Talpiot (if this is indeed his name) is not Jesus of Nazareth, but a person with the same name, since he appears to have a son named Judas (buried next to him) and the tomb shows signs of belonging to a wealthy Judean family, while Jesus came from a low-class Galilean family.

===Roza Bal===

The Roza Bal is a shrine located in the Khanyar quarter in downtown area of Srinagar in Kashmir. The word &quot;roza&quot; means tomb, the word &quot;bal&quot; mean place. Locals believe a sage is buried here, Yuzasaf (alternatively Yuz Asaf or Youza Asouph), alongside another Muslim holy man, Mir Sayyid Naseeruddin.

The shrine was relatively unknown until the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, claimed in 1899 that it is actually the tomb of Jesus. This view is maintained by Ahmadis today, though it is rejected by the local Sunni caretakers of the shrine, one of whom said &quot;the theory that Jesus is buried anywhere on the face of the earth is blasphemous to Islam.&quot;

===Kirisuto no haka===
Shingō village in Japan contains another location of what is purported to be the last resting place of Jesus, the so-called &quot;Tomb of Jesus&quot; (&quot;Kirisuto no haka&quot;), and the residence of Jesus&#x27;s last descendants, the family of Sajiro Sawaguchi. According to the Sawaguchi family&#x27;s claims, Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead his brother, Isukiri, took his place on the cross, while Jesus fled across Siberia to Mutsu Province, in northern Japan. Once in Japan, he changed his name to Torai Tora Daitenku, became a rice farmer, married a twenty-year old Japanese woman named Miyuko, and raised three daughters near what is now Shingō. While in Japan, it is asserted that he traveled, learned, and eventually died at the age of 106. His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years. According to the customs of the time, Jesus&#x27;s bones were collected, bundled, and buried in the mound purported to be the grave of Jesus Christ.

<text>The second USS &quot;Panay&quot; (PR–5) of the United States Navy was a &quot;Panay&quot;-class river gunboat that served on the Yangtze Patrol in China until being sunk by Japanese aircraft on 12 December 1937 on the Yangtze River.

The vessel was built by Jiangnan Dockyard and Engineering Works, Shanghai, China, and launched on 10 November 1927. She was sponsored by Mrs. Ellis S. Stone and commissioned on 10 September 1928.

==History==
Built for duty in the Asiatic Fleet on the Yangtze River, &quot;Panay&quot; had as her primary mission the protection of American lives and property frequently threatened in the disturbances that the 1920s and 1930s brought to a China struggling to modernize, create a strong central government, and later counter Japanese aggression. Throughout &quot;Panay’s&quot; service, navigation on the Yangtze was constantly menaced by bandits and soldier outlaws, and &quot;Panay&quot; and her sister ships provided protection for U.S. shipping and nationals, as other foreign forces did for their citizens.

Often detachments from &quot;Panay&quot; served as armed guards on American steamers plying the river. In 1931, her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander R. A. Dyer, reported, &quot;Firing on gunboats and merchant ships have [sic] become so routine that any vessel traversing the Yangtze River sails with the expectation of being fired upon. Fortunately,&quot; he added, &quot;the Chinese appear to be rather poor marksmen and the ship has, so far, not sustained any casualties in these engagements.&quot;

As the Japanese moved through south China, American gunboats evacuated most of the embassy staff from Nanjing during November 1937. &quot;Panay&quot; was assigned as station ship to guard the remaining Americans and take them off at the last moment. &quot;Panay&quot; evacuated the remaining Americans from the city on 11 December, bringing the number of people aboard to five officers, 54 enlisted men, four US embassy staff, and 10 civilians, including Universal News cameraman Norman Alley, Movietone News’ Eric Mayell, &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Norman Soong, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; correspondent Jim Marshall, &quot;La Stampa&quot; correspondent Sandro Sandri and &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; correspondent Luigi Barzini Jr. &quot;Panay&quot; moved upriver to avoid becoming involved in the fighting around the doomed capital. Three U.S. merchant tankers sailed with her. The Japanese senior naval commander in Shanghai was informed both before and after the fact of this movement.

===Sunk by the Japanese===
On 12 December 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army ordered Japanese naval aircraft to attack &quot;any and all ships&quot; in the Yangtze above Nanjing. Knowing of the presence of &quot;Panay&quot; and the merchantmen, the Imperial Japanese Navy requested verification of the order, which was received before the attack began about 13:27 that day. Although there were several large US flags flown on the ship as well as one painted atop the cabin, the Japanese planes continued strafing and bombing. &quot;Panay&quot; was hit by two of the eighteen bombs dropped by three Yokosuka B4Y Type-96 bombers and strafed by nine Nakajima A4N Type-95 fighters. The bombing continued until &quot;Panay&quot; sank at 15:54. Storekeeper First Class Charles L. Ensminger, Standard Oil tanker captain Carl H. Carlson and Italian reporter Sandro Sandri were killed, Coxswain Edgar C. Hulsebus died later that night. 43 sailors and five civilians were wounded. &quot;Panay&quot;&#x27;s lifeboats were machine-gunned by Japanese fighter planes in the attack.

Two newsreel cameramen, Norman Alley of Universal Newsreel and Eric Mayell of Fox Movietone News, were present on &quot;Panay&quot; and were able to take considerable film during the attack and afterwards from shore as &quot;Panay&quot; sank in the middle of the river. The newsreels are now available online at usspanay.org (see external links below).

Also on 12 December 1937 two British gunboats, HMS &quot;Ladybird&quot; and HMS &quot;Bee&quot;, came under fire from a Japanese artillery unit near Wuhu on the Yangtze River. &quot;Ladybird&quot; was hit by six shells, and &quot;Bee&quot; dodged one as she came upon the scene. &quot;Ladybird&quot; was not badly damaged, and with &quot;Bee&quot;, picked up survivors from &quot;Panay&quot;. 
A formal protest was immediately lodged by the U.S. ambassador. The Japanese government accepted responsibility, but insisted the attack was unintentional. A large indemnity was paid (approximately $2,000,000, which is equal to $ today) on 22 April 1938 and the incident was officially settled; however, further deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States continued.

Fon Huffman, the last survivor of the incident, died in September 2008.

<doc id="1209536" wikidata="Q7527858" url="?curid=1209536" title="Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet">
<text>Brigadier-General Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet (5 November 1741 – 4 January 1830) was an American-born military officer, politician and landowner who fought as a Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War. He was the son of Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, a prominent British Indian Department official in the Thirteen Colonies. Johnson inherited his father&#x27;s baronetcy and estate in 1774. 

Johnson moved to the Province of Quebec during the Revolutionary War with his family and allies, as he was at risk of arrest by Patriot authorities. During the war, he served in the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in 1782. In the same year, Johnson was also appointed as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, a position he occupied until his death in 1830. 

After the war, Johnson was appointed by the Crown to distribute lands in Upper Canada to exiled Loyalists, and he helped resettle approximately 3,800 Loyalist refugees in 1784. Johnson also served in the Legislative Council of Lower Canada.

==Early life==
Johnson was born near Amsterdam, New York on 5 November 1741. He was the only son of Colonel Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, and his common-law wife, Catherine Weissenberg, a Palatine German immigrant. As his parents never married, he was baptized John Wysen Bergh by Rev. Henry Barclay February 7, 1741/2 as an Anglican in the chapel at Fort Hunter. His father was a military commander during the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War) who had promoted the Anglo-American settlement of the Mohawk Valley and trade relations with the Mohawk along with founding the village of Johnstown in Tryon County, New York.

His paternal grandparents were Christopher Johnson and Lady Anne Warren, sister of Vice Admiral Sir Peter Warren (who married his eventual wife&#x27;s aunt, Susannah Delancey, a daughter of Stephen Delancey), descendants of King William the Conqueror. From 1757 until 1760, John studied sporadically at The Academy and College of Philadelphia. From 13 years of age, he accompanied his father on military expeditions and conferences with the Indians.

==Career==
In 1771, Johnson became the last Provincial Grand Master of Masons in the colonies of Province of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. At his father&#x27;s death in 1774, Johnson became a wealthy landowner and succeeded to his father&#x27;s title of baronetcy, along with his extensive estates and 20 slaves. In 1775, he was appointed doorkeeper of the New York General Assembly.

===American Revolution===
In January 1776, nine months after the outbreak of the American Revolution, Johnson gathered several hundred armed supporters at Johnstown. He sent a letter to Governor William Tryon, through Captain John McDonell, saying that he and his Loyalist neighbors had conferred about raising a battalion for the British cause. He also said he could raise 500 Indian warriors who, when used with his regular troops, could retake all of the forts captured by the rebels.
On January 20, 1776, Major General Philip Schuyler, with a force of Continental troops and the Tryon County militia numbering around 3,000, disarmed Johnson and about 300 of his Loyalist supporters; Schuyler paroled Johnson. Hearing in May 1776 of another force being sent to arrest him, Johnson decided to flee with his family and supporters to Canada. He led about 170 of his tenants and allies among the Iroquois Confederacy to Montreal, Quebec. Sir John&#x27;s loyalty to King George III cost him his home in Johnstown and extensive property in the Mohawk Valley, all of which was confiscated after the war by the State of New York.
Johnson and his followers formed the core of the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York, a Loyalist regiment which saw substantial action against American forces from New York under his command throughout the revolutionary war. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on the American Establishment in 1782.

On March 14, 1782, he received the appointment of Superintendent General and Inspector General of Indian affairs from Sir Frederick Haldimand, due to the dismissal of his cousin Guy Johnson. In 1781, General MacLean reported that Guy Johnson&#x27;s wartime accounts were &quot;Extravagant, wonderful &amp; fictitious, and the quality of articles so extraordinary, new &amp; uncommon&quot;. Guy Johnson was suspended as superintendent and summoned to Montreal, where Haldimand criticized his conduct as &quot;reprehensible&quot;. Guy Johnson was disgraced and departed for London to defend his reports to the government, but met with no success. Sir John took over Fort Niagara as superintendent of Indian affairs in his cousin&#x27;s absence, later to be appointed in full. The authority of the position extended over all northern First Nations allied with the Crown, including four of the Iroquois League nations, most of whom had relocated to Canada after having been allies of the British during the revolution.

===Post-war Years===

In 1783, the Treaty of Paris was signed, establishing the independence of the American Colonies. Johnson and thousands of other Loyalists were in permanent exile in Canada. The British had transported some Loyalists from New York and New England for resettlement to Nova Scotia, including more than 3,000 Black Loyalists: African-American slaves whom they had freed as promised for their service during the war.

In 1784, Haldimand appointed Johnson to distribute Crown lands (purchased from First Nations) along the St. Lawrence River and the north shore of Lake Ontario (what became known as Upper Canada) to Loyalists who had come to Canada, as some compensation for their losses in the colonies. The government wanted to encourage development of this part of Canada, as it was lightly settled. The exiles faced severe conditions in the early years, as they struggled to create settlements out of frontier lands, and the British were not able to get adequate supplies to them on time. Johnson estimated that he had arranged the settlement of 3,776 Loyalists during the first years. From 1787 to 1788 he worked with his subordinate at the Indian Department Colonel John Butler on the Johnson-Butler Purchase in acquiring more land east of the Toronto Purchase.

In 1791, Lord Dorchester recommended Johnson as lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, but London turned this recommendation down.

In 1796, Johnson moved back to Montreal, then the seat of government, where he served in the Legislative Council of Lower Canada and as head of the Department of Indian Affairs for Lower Canada. He owned land in both Upper and Lower Canada, including the seigneuries of Monnoir and Argenteuil in Quebec.

==Personal life==
From 1765 to 1773, Johnson took as a common-law wife, fifteen year old Clarissa Putman (1751–1833) of Tribes Hill, New York, daughter of Arent V. Putman and Elizabeth Peek, of Dutch and Mohawk ancestry. Before their relationship ended he married Mary Nicoll Watts. John and Clarissa were the parents of a daughter and a son:

* Margaret Johnson (1765–), who married James Van Horne, the son of Sheriff Abraham Van Horne, in 1791.
* William Johnson (1770–1836), who was taken to Canada by Johnson where he was educated and became the lock master at The Cascades in Lower Canada.

On June 30, 1773, Johnson married Mary Nicoll &quot;Polly&quot; Watts (1751–1815), a daughter of Hon. John Watts, President of the King&#x27;s Council, of New York. After he escaped to Canada in May 1776 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Lady Johnson was detained that year by the Whigs of New York as a hostage for the good conduct of her husband. After she was freed to join Sir John in Canada, the couple lived in Montreal during the winter and spent the summers on their &quot;seigneurie&quot; at Argenteuil, Ottawa on the Ottawa River. The couple also visited England. Together, Mary and Sir John had ten sons, eight of whom served in the British army and navy, and eight daughters, including:

* Anne Nancy Johnson (1774–1848), who married Colonel Edward MacDonnell (1766–1812), the Deputy Quartermaster General to the Forces in Canada who served as an aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington.
* William Johnson (1775–1811), Lieutenant Colonel in the Army, who married Sarah Delancey, granddaughter of Oliver Delancey.
* Warren Johnson (1777–1802), Major in the 60th Foot.
* Adam Gordon Johnson (1781–1843), Lieutenant Colonel of the 6th Battalion of Militia, who succeeded his father to the baronetcy.
* John Johnson of Point Olivier, Montreal (1782–1841), Colonel-Commandant of 6th Battalion of Militia, who married Mary Diana Dillon (1809–1861).
* James Stephen Johnson (1785–1812), Captain in the 28th Foot who was killed at the 1812 Siege of Badajoz.
* Catherine Maria Johnson (1786–1850), who married Major-General Barnard Foord Bowes in 1805. Bowes died at the Siege of the Salamanca Forts in 1812.
* Robert Thomas Johnson (1787–1812), Captain in the Army, who drowned in the St. Lawrence River in 1812.
* Charles Christopher Johnson (1789–1854), Lieutenant Colonel in the Army, who married Susan Griffith Colpoys, daughter of Sir Edward Griffith Colpoys.
* Their last surviving child, Marianne Johnson (1791–1868), never married. She died in London on 1 January 1868.
* Archibald Kennedy Johnson (1792–1866), who married Jenet Robertson and Maria Langham.

Lady Johnson died in Montreal on August 7, 1815. Sir John died, at the age of 88, in Montreal, while still Superintendent of Indian Affairs, on January 4, 1830. Both are buried in a vault at Mount Johnson, near Chambly, Quebec.

==Legacy and honors==

* The Sir John Johnson House in Williamstown, Ontario, was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1961.
* Lac Sir John, a small lake near Lakefield, Quebec (and as is the road Chemin Lac Sir John) is named after him.

<text>An intermediate representation (IR) is the data structure or code used internally by a compiler or virtual machine to represent source code. An IR is designed to be conducive to further processing, such as optimization and translation. A &quot;good&quot; IR must be &quot;accurate&quot; – capable of representing the source code without loss of information – and &quot;independent&quot; of any particular source or target language. An IR may take one of several forms: an in-memory data structure, or a special tuple- or stack-based code readable by the program. In the latter case it is also called an &quot;intermediate language&quot;.

A canonical example is found in most modern compilers. For example, the CPython interpreter transforms the linear human-readable text representing a program into an intermediate graph structure that allows flow analysis and re-arrangement before execution. Use of an intermediate representation such as this allows compiler systems like the GNU Compiler Collection and LLVM to be used by many different source languages to generate code for many different target architectures.

== Intermediate language ==

An intermediate language is the language of an abstract machine designed to aid in the analysis of computer programs. The term comes from their use in compilers, where the source code of a program is translated into a form more suitable for code-improving transformations before being used to generate object or machine code for a target machine. The design of an intermediate language typically differs from that of a practical machine language in three fundamental ways:

* Each instruction represents exactly one fundamental operation; e.g. &quot;shift-add&quot; addressing modes common in microprocessors are not present.
* Control flow information may not be included in the instruction set.
* The number of processor registers available may be large, even limitless.

A popular format for intermediate languages is three-address code.

The term is also used to refer to languages used as intermediates by some high-level programming languages which do not output object or machine code themselves, but output the intermediate language only. This intermediate language is submitted to a compiler for such language, which then outputs finished object or machine code. This is usually done to ease the process of optimization or to increase portability by using an intermediate language that has compilers for many processors and operating systems, such as C. Languages used for this fall in complexity between high-level languages and low-level languages, such as assembly languages.

=== Languages ===
Though not explicitly designed as an intermediate language, C&#x27;s nature as an abstraction of assembly and its ubiquity as the &quot;de facto&quot; system language in Unix-like and other operating systems has made it a popular intermediate language: Eiffel, Sather, Esterel, some dialects of Lisp (Lush, Gambit), Squeak&#x27;s Smalltalk-subset Slang, Nim, Cython, Seed7, SystemTap, Vala, V, and others make use of C as an intermediate language. Variants of C have been designed to provide C&#x27;s features as a portable assembly language, including C-- and the C Intermediate Language.

Any language targeting a virtual machine or p-code machine can be considered an intermediate language:
* Java bytecode
* Microsoft&#x27;s Common Intermediate Language is an intermediate language designed to be shared by all compilers for the .NET Framework, before static or dynamic compilation to machine code.
* While most intermediate languages are designed to support statically typed languages, the Parrot intermediate representation is designed to support dynamically typed languages—initially Perl and Python.
* TIMI is used by compilers on the IBM i platform.
* O-code for BCPL
* MATLAB precompiled code
* Microsoft P-Code
* Pascal p-code

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) uses several intermediate languages internally to simplify portability and cross-compilation. Among these languages are
* the historical Register Transfer Language (RTL)
* the tree language GENERIC
* the SSA-based GIMPLE. (Lower-level than GENERIC; input for most optimizers; has a compact &quot;bytecode&quot; notation.)

GCC supports generating these IRs, as a final target:
* HSA Intermediate Layer
* LLVM Intermediate Representation (converted from GIMPLE in the now-defunct llvm-gcc which uses LLVM optimizers and codegen)

The LLVM compiler framework is based on the LLVM IR intermediate language, of which the compact, binary serialized representation is also referred to as &quot;bitcode&quot; and has been productized by Apple. Like GIMPLE Bytecode, LLVM Bitcode is useful in link-time optimization. Like GCC, LLVM also targets some IRs meant for direct distribution, including Google&#x27;s PNaCl IR and SPIR. A further development within LLVM is the use of &quot;Multi-Level Intermediate Representation&quot; (MLIR) with the potential to generate code for different heterogeneous targets, and to combine the outputs of different compilers.

The ILOC intermediate language is used in classes on compiler design as a simple target language.

== Other ==
Static analysis tools often use an intermediate representation. For instance, Radare2 is a toolbox for binary files analysis and reverse-engineering. It uses the intermediate languages ESIL and REIL to analyze binary files.

<text>A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste. Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size. 

Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissue concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head.
== Human head ==

The human head is an anatomical unit that consists of the skull, hyoid bone and cervical vertebrae. The skull consists of the brain case which encloses the cranial cavity, and the facial skeleton, which includes the mandible. There are eight bones in the brain case and fourteen in the facial skeleton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptures of human heads are generally based on a skeletal structure that consists of a cranium, jawbone, and cheekbone. Though the number of muscles making up the face is generally consistent between sculptures, the shape of the muscles varies widely based on the function, development, and expressions reflected on the faces of the subjects.

Proponents of believe that the mind is identical to the brain. Philosopher John Searle asserts his identist beliefs, stating &quot;the brain is the only thing in the human head&quot;. Similarly, Dr. Henry Bennet-Clark has stated that the head encloses billions of &quot;miniagents and microagents (with no single Boss)&quot;.

== Other animals ==
The evolution of a head is associated with the cephalization that occurred in Bilateria some 555 million years ago.

=== Arthropods ===

In some arthropods, especially trilobites, the cephalon, or cephalic region, is the region of the head which is a collective of &quot;fused segments&quot;.

==== Insects ====
A typical insect head is composed of eyes, antennae, and components of mouth. As these components differ substantially from insect to insect, they form important identification links. Eyes in the head found, in several types of insects, are in the form of a pair of compound eyes with multiple faces. In many other types of insects, the compound eyes are seen in a &quot;single facet or group of single facets&quot;. In some cases, the eyes may be seen as marks on the dorsal or located near or toward the head, two or three ocelli (single faceted organs).

Antennae on the insect&#x27;s head is found in the form of segmented attachments, in pairs, that are usually located between the eyes. These are in varying shapes and sizes, in the form of filaments or in different enlarged or clubbed form.

Insects have mouth parts in various shapes depending on their feeding habits. Labrum is the &quot;upper lip&quot; which is in the front area of the head and is the most exterior part. A pair of mandibles is found on the backside of the labrum flanking the side of the mouth, succeeded by a pair of maxillae each of which is known as maxilliary palp. At the back side of the mouth is the labium or lower lip. There is also an extra mouth part in some insects which is termed as hypopharynx which is usually located between the maxillac.


=== Vertebrates and the &quot;new head hypothesis&quot; ===
Though invertebrate chordates – such as the tunicate larvae or the lancelets – have heads, there has been a question of how the vertebrate head, characterized by a bony skull clearly separated from the main body, might have evolved from the head structures of these animals.

According to Hyman (1979), the evolution of the head in the vertebrates has occurred by the fusion of a fixed number of anterior segments, in the same manner as in other &quot;heteronomously segmented animals&quot;. In some cases, segments or a portion of the segments disappear. The head segments also lose most of their systems, except for the nervous system. With the progressive development of cephalization, &quot;the head incorporates more and more of the adjacent segments into its structure, so that in general it may be said that the higher the degree of cephalization the greater is the number of segments composing the head&quot;.

In the 1980s, the &quot;new head hypothesis&quot; was proposed, suggesting that the vertebrate head is an evolutionary novelty resulting from the emergence of neural crest and cranial placodes. In 2014, a transient larva tissue of the lancelet was found to be virtually indistinguishable from the neural crest-derived cartilage which forms the vertebrate skull, suggesting that persistence of this tissue and expansion into the entire headspace could be a viable evolutionary route to formation of the vertebrate head.

== In society and culture ==

=== Heraldry ===

The heads of humans and other animals are commonly recurring charges in heraldry. Heads of humans are sometimes blazoned simply as a &quot;man&#x27;s head&quot;, but are far more frequently described in greater detail, either characteristic of a particular race or nationality (such as Moors&#x27; heads, Saxons&#x27; heads, Egyptians&#x27; heads or Turks&#x27; heads), or specifically identified (such as the head of Moses in the crest of Hilton, or the head of St. John the Baptist in the crest of the London Company of Tallowchandlers). Several varieties of women&#x27;s heads also occur, including maidens&#x27; heads (often couped under the bust, with hair disheveled), ladies&#x27; heads, nuns&#x27; heads (often veiled), and occasionally queens&#x27; heads. The arms of Devaney of Norfolk include &quot;three nun&#x27;s heads veiled couped at the shoulders proper,&quot; and the bust of a queen occurs in the arms of Queenborough, Kent. Infants&#x27; or children&#x27;s heads are often couped at the shoulders with a snake wrapped around the neck (e.g. &quot;Argent, a boy&#x27;s head proper, crined or, couped below the shoulders, vested gules, tarnished gold,&quot; in the arms of Boyman).

=== Art ===

One of the ways of drawing sketches of heads—as Jack Hamm advises—is to develop it in six well-defined steps, starting with the shape of the head in the shape of an egg. The female head, in particular, is sketched in a double circle design procedure with proportions considered as an ideal of a female head. In the first circle, the division is made of five sections on the diameter, each section of five eyes width. It is then developed over a series of ten defined steps, with the smaller circle imposed partially over the larger circle at the lower end at the fourth stage. Eyes and chins are fitted in various shapes to form the head.

Leonardo da Vinci, considered one of the world&#x27;s greatest artists, drew sketches of human anatomy using grid structures. His image of the face drawn on the grid structure principle is in perfect proportion. In this genre, using the technique of pen and ink, Leonardo created a sketch which is a &quot;Study on the proportions of head and eyes&quot; (pictured).

=== Idiomatic expressions ===
An idiom is a phrase or a fixed expression that has a figurative, or sometimes literal, meaning.
* &quot;To be &quot; - to be overly full of oneself
* &quot;To &quot; – to reach a critical stage and require immediate action
* &quot;To &quot; – to criticize someone strongly
* &quot;&quot; – cannot understand something
* &quot;A &quot; – an early start that provides an advantage over others
* &quot; above someone or something&quot; – better than someone or something in some way
* &quot;To want someone&#x27;s &quot; – to want someone severely punished
* &quot;To &quot; – to continually try to achieve something without success
* &quot;To have one&#x27;s &quot; – to not pay attention to what is happening around one because one is so absorbed by one&#x27;s own thoughts

===Engineering and scientific fields===

The head&#x27;s function and appearance play an analogous role in the etymology of many technical terms. Cylinder head, pothead, and weatherhead are three such examples.

<text>Moulin de Craca is a windmill in Plouézec, Côtes-d&#x27;Armor, France. First working in 1844 it was restored from 1995. It is popular amongst both locals and tourists because of its location on top of a cliff overlooking Port Lazo.

Every August the Plouézec-Ballinamore twinning committee organises Noz Ar Vilin Fest Noz around the windmill. There is a selection of Breton and Irish music and dancing, as well as local cuisine and drinks. Amongst the specialities are &quot;Moules-Frites&quot; (Mussels and chips), &quot;Crêpes&quot;, &quot;Galettes&quot;, Breton cider, and Chouchen.

After falling into disrepair, the windmill was restored in 1993. It now contains fully operational, working replica machinery.

<doc id="1209554" wikidata="Q16919633" url="?curid=1209554" title="Russian oligarchs">
<text>Russian oligarchs () are business oligarchs of the former Soviet republics who rapidly accumulated wealth in the 1990s via the Russian privatisation that followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The failing Soviet state left the ownership of state assets contested, which allowed for informal deals with former USSR officials as a means to acquire state property.

The Russian oligarchs emerged as business entrepreneurs under Mikhail Gorbachev (General Secretary, 1985–1991) using various loopholes during economic liberalization under Gorbachev&#x27;s perestroika. Boris Berezovsky, a mathematician and former researcher, became the first well-known Russian business oligarch.

Oligarchs became increasingly influential in Russian politics during Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s presidency (1991–1999); they helped finance his re-election in 1996. Well-connected oligarchs like Roman Abramovich, Michail Khodorkovsky, Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Potanin acquired key assets at a fraction of the value at the loans for shares scheme auctions conducted in the run-up to the election. Defenders of the out-of-favor oligarchs argue that the companies they acquired were not highly valued at the time because they still ran on Soviet principles, with non-existent stock control, huge payrolls, no financial reporting and scant regard for profit.

Since 2014, hundreds of Russian oligarchs and their companies have been hit with US sanctions for their support of &quot;the Russian government&#x27;s malign activity around the globe&quot;. In 2022, many Russian oligarchs and their close family members were targeted and sanctioned by countries around the world as a rebuke of Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine.

==Yeltsin era, 1991–1999==
During Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s perestroika (–1991), many businessmen in Russia imported goods such as personal computers and jeans into the country and sold them for a hefty profit.

Once Boris Yeltsin became President of Russia in July 1991, the oligarchs emerged as well-connected entrepreneurs who started from nearly nothing and became rich through participation in the market via connections to the corrupt, but elected, government of Russia during the state&#x27;s transition to a market-based economy. The so-called voucher privatization program of 1992–1994 enabled a handful of young men to become billionaires, specifically by arbitraging the vast difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities (such as natural gas and oil) and the prices prevailing on the world market. These oligarchs became unpopular with the Russian public and are often blamed for the turmoil that plagued the Russian Federation following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

===Emergence===
Economists Sergei Guriev and Andrei Rachinsky contrast older oligarchs with &quot;nomenklatura&quot; ties and younger-generation entrepreneurs such as Kakha Bendukidze who built their wealth from scratch because Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms affected a period &quot;when co-existence of regulated and quasi-market prices created huge opportunities for arbitrage.&quot;

The majority of oligarchs were promoted (at least initially) by the Soviet &quot;apparatchiks&quot;, with strong connections to Soviet power-structures and access to the funds of the Communist Party. Boris Berezovsky himself was Head of the Department of System Design at another Academy of Sciences research centre. His private company was established by the Institute as a joint venture. Mikhail Khodorkovsky started his business importing computers under auspices of the Komsomol-authorised Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity of the Youth in 1986, briefly serving as a deputy secretary of the Komsomol for a district in Moscow in 1987. His move into banking two years later was funded with the support of Komsomol alumni working in Moscow city government. Later, he served in the Russian government as an adviser to the prime minister and a deputy minister of fuel and power while still running his business. Vladimir Vinogradov was the chief economist of Promstroybank, one of the six banks existing in the Soviet Union, previously serving as the secretary of Atommash plant Komsomol organisation.

===Political support===
Economist Yegor Gaidar worked in a Soviet Academy of Sciences think tank modelled after RAND. Gaidar later became the economics editor of the &quot;Kommunist&quot; journal, the official theoretical organ of the CC of the CPSU. He also held various positions, including Prime Minister in the Russian government during 1991–1992. Together with Anatoly Chubais, the two &quot;Young Reformers&quot; were chiefly responsible for privatization in the early 1990s. According to David Satter, &quot;what drove the process was not the determination to create a system based on universal values but rather the will to introduce a system of private ownership, which, in the absence of law, opened the way for the criminal pursuit of money and power&quot;.

The 1998 Russian financial crisis hit most oligarchs hard and those whose holdings were based mainly in banking lost much of their fortunes. The most influential oligarchs from the Yeltsin era include Roman Abramovich, Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Vladimir Potanin, Alexander Smolensky and Vladimir Vinogradov. They formed what became known as the (or &quot;seven-banker outfit&quot;, ), a group of businessmen with a great influence on Boris Yeltsin and his political environment. Together they controlled from 50% to 70% of all Russian finances between 1996 and 2000. Historian Edward L. Keenan has compared these oligarchs to the system of powerful boyars that emerged in late-medieval Muscovy. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2008 that oligarchs&#x27; from the era of former president Boris Yeltsin have been purged by the Kremlin&quot;.

==Putin era, 1999–2022 (prior to the invasion of Ukraine)==

With the ascent of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin the influence of the Yeltsin oligarchs dissipated, as some were imprisoned, such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky (pictured here) and Mikhael Mirilashvili, while others emigrated, sold off their assets or died under suspicious circumstances, such as Vladimir Vinogradov and Boris Berezovsky. A number of Yeltsin oligarchs first came under fire for alleged tax evasion. Vladimir Gusinsky of MediaMost and Boris Berezovsky both avoided legal proceedings by leaving Russia, and the most prominent, Mikhail Khodorkovsky of Yukos oil, was arrested in October 2003 and sentenced to 9 years. This was subsequently extended to 14 years, and after Putin pardoned him, he was released on 20 December 2013.

A second wave of oligarchs emerged in the 2000s, friends and former colleagues of President Putin either from his years in the St Petersburg municipal administration or his Dresden tenure in the KGB. Examples are the director of the institute where Putin obtained a degree in 1996, Vladimir Litvinenko, and Putin&#x27;s childhood friend and judo-teacher Arkady Rotenberg. Gennady Timchenko was close friends with Russian leader Vladimir Putin since the early 1980s. In 1991, Putin gave Timchenko an oil export license. These oligarchs worked in close cooperaton with the government, displacing a system of crony capitalism with a system of state capitalism whereby the new oligarchs benefited from financing by state-owned banks and access to public procurement projects. 
An economic study distinguished 21 oligarchic groups as of 2003. Between 2000 and 2004, Putin apparently engaged in a power struggle with some oligarchs, reaching a &quot;grand bargain&quot; with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain their powers, in exchange for their explicit support of – and alignment with – Putin&#x27;s government. However, other analysts argue that the oligarchic structure has remained intact under Putin, with Putin devoting much of his time to mediating power-disputes between rival oligarchs.

===Prominent Putin-era oligarchs===

The ten most-prominent oligarchs of the early Putin era included Roman Abramovich, Oleg Deripaska, Mikhail Prokhorov, Alisher Usmanov, Viktor Vekselberg, Leonid Mikhelson, Arkady Rotenberg, Gennady Timchenko, Andrey Guryev and Vitaly Malkin. In 2004, five years after Putin&#x27;s ascent to power, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed 36 billionaires of Russian citizenship, with a note: &quot;this list includes businessmen of Russian citizenship who acquired the major share of their wealth privately, while not holding a governmental position&quot;. In 2005, the number of billionaires dropped to 30, mostly because of the Yukos case, with Khodorkovsky dropping from No. 1 (US$15.2 billion) to No. 21 (US$2.0 billion). A 2013 report by Credit Suisse found that 35% of the wealth of Russia was owned by the wealthiest 110 individuals.

Daniel Treisman proposed using a term &quot;silovarch&quot; (silovik and oligarch) for a new class of Russian oligarchs with backgrounds in Russian military and intelligence.

On 30 January 2018, the U.S. Treasury published a &quot;list of oligarchs&quot; as part of a document known as the &quot;Putin list&quot; which was compiled under the requirement of the CAATSA Act. According to the document itself, its criterion for inclusion was simply being a Russian national with a net worth of over $1 billion. The list was criticised for being indiscriminate, and including critics of Putin.

===2008 global recession and credit crisis===
According to the financial news-agency Bloomberg L.P., Russia&#x27;s wealthiest 25 individuals have collectively lost US$230 billion (£146 billion) since July 2008. The fall in the oligarchs&#x27; wealth relates closely to the meltdown in Russia&#x27;s stock market, as by 2008 the RTS Index had lost 71% of its value due to the capital flight after the Russo-Georgian War of August 2008.

Billionaires in Russia were particularly hard-hit by lenders seeking repayment on balloon loans to shore up their own balance sheets. Many oligarchs took out generous loans from Russian banks, bought shares, and then took out more loans from western banks against the value of these shares. One of the first to get hit by the global downturn was Oleg Deripaska, Russia&#x27;s richest man at the time, who had a net worth of US$28 billion in March 2008. As Deripaska borrowed money from western banks using shares in his companies as collateral, the collapse in share price forced him to sell holdings to satisfy the margin calls.

==Putin era, 2022 invasion of Ukraine and international sanctions==
After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Canada, US, and European leaders with the addition of Japan, took unprecedented steps to sanction Putin and the oligarchs directly. In response to the sanctions, the targeted oligarchs started to hide wealth in an attempt to prevent the Western nations from freezing their assets. These sanctions intend to directly impact the Russian ruling class as a response for their perceived contribution and acquiescence to the war with Ukraine. Although the sanctions miss some of the richest oligarchs, the impact on the war is unknown due to Putin&#x27;s power over those that were sanctioned. Since the invasion began, nine of the Russian oligarchs&#x27; yachts have turned their navigation transponders off as they sail to ports where they are less likely to be searched and seized.
On March 2, 2022, the United States announced a special task force dubbed &quot;Task Force KleptoCapture&quot;. This team was put together to specifically target oligarchs. It is made up of officials from the FBI, Marshals Service, IRS, Postal Inspection Service, Homeland Security Investigations and Secret Service. The main goal of the task force is to impose the sanctions set against these individuals to freeze and seize the assets that the US government claimed were proceeds of their illegal involvement with the Russian government and the invasion of Ukraine. On March 21, 2022, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project launched Russian Asset Tracker to showcase the profiles and assets of several Russian oligarchs.

Several dozen business people with family connections to top politicians include President Putin’s younger daughter Katerina Tikhonova, who through her investment fund has been the recipient of numerous large contracts from state-owned energy companies. Her former husband Kirill Shamalov runs the largest Russian petrochemicals company Sibur as well as his own investment fund.

The son-in-law of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov runs an investment fund with assets exceeding $6 billion. Andrey Ryumin, the son-in-law of Viktor Medvedchuk, President Putin’s former closest ally in Ukraine, runs another investment fund with large agricultural holdings which have become recipients of state subsidies for import substitution (Rouhandeh 2022). Petr Fradkov, the son of a former Prime Minister and head of the Russian foreign intelligence service, Sergei Sergeevich Ivanov, the son of the former head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, and Andrey Patrushev, the son of the current head of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev have all joined the ranks of the oligarchs.

The list of oligarchs and business executives who have risen to prominence and who have been sanctioned after Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine includes:

* Petr Fradkov (CEO of Promstroybank, son of Mikhail Fradkov, former Russian Prime Minister during 2004–2007. Mikhail Fradkov is the longest serving director of Russia&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Service from 2007 to 2016. Since 4 January 2017, Fradkov has been Director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies.)
* Andrey Guryev (the former head of PhosAgro, the world&#x27;s fourth largest producer of phosphate-based fertilizers) 
*Mikhail Gutseriev (former owner of Russneft, one of Russia&#x27;s largest oil companies) 
* Said Gutseriev (Russian-British businessperson, the son of Russian oligarch Mikhail Gutseriev. Since 2018 he has been included by Forbes into the list of wealthiest businessmen in the world. In 2021 his fortune has been estimated at $1.7 billion.
*Katerina Tikhonova (President Putin&#x27;s second daughter and deputy chair of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs) 
*Kirill Shamalov (director and part-owner of Sibur, a Russian petrochemicals company) 
* Andrey Valerievich Ryumin (Executive Director of Rosseti PJSC (formerly, until August 2014, known as Russian Grids, Chairman of Board, son-in-law of Viktor Medvedchuk. Medvedchuk is a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician and a personal friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin.) 
* Andrey Patrushev (son of the Secretary of the Security Council of Russia Nikolai Patrushev. Nikolai Patrushev served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) from 1999 to 2008. Belonging to the &quot;siloviki&quot; faction of president Vladimir Putin&#x27;s inner circle, Patrushev is believed to be one of the closest advisors to Putin and a leading figure behind Russia&#x27;s national security affairs. Patrushev is seen by some observers as one of the likeliest candidates for succeeding Putin.)
* Sergei Sergeevich Ivanov (Board member of Gazprombank and president of Alrosa diamond mining; son of Sergei Ivanov, Minister of Defense of Russia from March 2001 to February 2007, Deputy Prime Minister from November 2005 to February 2007 and First Deputy Prime Minister from February 2007 to May 2008. After the election of Dmitry Medvedev as President of Russia, Ivanov was reappointed a Deputy Prime Minister (in office: 2008–2011) in Vladimir Putin&#x27;s second cabinet. From December 2011 to August 2016, Ivanov worked as the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office. Having served in the Soviet KGB and in its successor, the Federal Security Service, Sergei Ivanov holds the rank of colonel general.)
*Ruben Vardanyan, former head of Russian Security Council, former adviser to Vladimir Putin, former chief executive officer and shareholder of the Troika Dialog investment bank, which was the hearth of the Troika Laundromat. Had close ties to Vladimir Putin and nicknamed &quot;Putin&#x27;s wallet.&quot; Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Vardanyan was placed on the Ukrainian government&#x27;s list of sanctioned people for his role as a board member of the Russian air cargo company Volga Dnepr, which plays a major role in Russian military air transport.
*Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the paramilitary the Wagner Group. In June 2023, the Wagner Group launched a rebellion against the Russian military, seizing control of the port city of Rostov-on-Don. Exactly two months later, on August 23, Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash that is suspected to have been orchestrated by Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Security Council of Russia and Putin&#x27;s right-hand man.
* Yury Slyusar (director of United Aircraft Corporation and board member of Aeroflot, Russian Airlines Pjsc and United Aircraft)
* Alexander Vinokurov (Owner of the privately held investment company Marathon Group (Russian company) and largest shareholder of retailer Magnit. Vinokurov is married to Ekaterina Vinokurova (née Lavrova) (born 1982 New York City), daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov. Vinokurov was added to the EU Sanctions List on 9 March 2022 for providing a substantial source of revenue to the government of the Russian Federation during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

==Russian oligarchs in London==
The British Government policy encouraged the flow of foreign capital into the United Kingdom, for example through the foreign investor visa routes, introduced during John Major&#x27;s premiership in 1994, one-fifth of whose recipients since 2008 are Russian citizens. 

A significant number of Russian oligarchs have bought homes in upmarket sections of London in the United Kingdom, which has been dubbed &quot;Moscow on Thames&quot; or &quot;Londongrad&quot;. Some, such as Eugene Shvidler, Alexander Knaster, Konstantin Kagalovsky, David Wilkowske and Abram Reznikov, are expatriates, having taken permanent residency in London. Roman Abramovich bought 16 Kensington Palace Gardens in London, a 15-bedroom mansion, for £120 million. Mikhail Fridman restored Athlone House in London as a primary residence in 2016.

Roman Abramovich bought the English football club Chelsea F.C. in 2003, spending record amounts on players&#x27; salaries. Alexander Mamut invested £100m to Waterstones bookstore chain after acquiring it in 2011 for £53m. According to its managing director James Daunt, the intervention saved Waterstones, which managed to make its first annual profit since 2008 in 2016. He remarked that continued Russian ownership would&#x27;ve been &quot;catastrophic&quot; for the chain in 2022.

## Core city: A core city has to satisfy the following three conditions:
### Its population more than 200,000.
### More than 70% of its residents living in the urbanized area.
### More than 70% of the employed residents working within the city.
## Satellite city: Within the same region of the core city, a city or township is defined as a satellite city if one of the following conditions is satisfied. A satellite city has to connect to the core city either directly or through its satellite cities.
### More than 10% of the employed residents commuting to the core city.
### More than 5% of the employed residents commuting to the core city and more than 40% of the residents living within the same urbanized area as the core city.
### surrounded by satellite cities.
### If a city is qualified to be a satellite city for more than one core cities, it is defined to be of the core city with more commuters.
# A metropolitan area is named after the most populous core city.
# Two metropolitan areas are combined into one if the distance between the largest core cities is less than 25 km or if they are bordered with each other for more than 1 km, and if there is close connection of their commuters.

==== Izvestia Vuzov. Series: Khimia i Khimicheskaya Tekhnologia (Russian Journal of Chemistry and Chemical Technology) ====
This journal is the oldest scientific journal published at ISUCT: in 2018 it celebrated its 60th anniversary. The founder and the first chief editor was Professor K.B. Yatsimirsky. A specific feature of the journal is its wide profile which allows one to represent materials on chemistry and chemical technology in Russian and in English. Periodicity is 12 issues per year.

==== Macroheterocycles ====
The journal &quot;Macroheterocycles&quot; has been published at ISUCT since 2008 on the initiative of a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Doctor of Chemistry O.I. Koifman. The journal &quot;Macroheterocycles&quot; is a forum of the specialists studying macroheterocyclic compounds. It publishes original experimental and theoretical works (full papers and brief reports) and reviews on the synthesis, structure, physical and coordination chemistry of macroheterocycles as well as  on their practical application.

==== Russian Chemical Journal. Journal of the Russian Chemical Society after D.I. Mendeleev ====
The journal publishes analytical reviews devoted to the problems of chemical science, technology and education, original papers and brief reports. Most issues of the journal are thematic and are devoted to a specific area of science or technology.

The &quot;Journal of the Russian Chemical Society&quot; was founded in 1869. The first editor was a Russian chemist, professor at the Imperial St. Petersburg University, corresponding member of St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences N.A. Menshutkin (1842–1907).

In 1956 the journal was renamed. The All-Union Chemical Society established the &quot;Journal of the All-Union Chemical Society named after D.I. Mendeleev&quot; edited by Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Doctor of Chemistry I.L. Knunyants. The journal was published in Moscow in the printing house of the &quot;Goskhimizdat&quot; (State Chemistry Publishing Office). 

In 1992, after the collapse of the USSR, the All-Union Chemical Society (ACS) ceased to exist, and since 1993 its edition was renamed to &quot;Russian Chemical Journal&quot;. Until 2013 the journal was published in Moscow and was edited by Academician of the RAS Yu.D. Tretyakov (until 2012) and Doctor of Chemistry, Professor of Moscow State University G.V. Lisichkin (2013). In 2013 the rights for the publication of the Russian Chemical Journal were transferred to the Ivanovo State University of Chemistry and Technology.

==== Modern High Technologies ====
Regional supplement to the journal of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences &quot;Modern high technologies&quot;.

==== Izvestia Vuzov. Series: Economika, finansy i upravlenie proizvodstvom (Series &quot;Economics, Finance and Production Management&quot;) ====

<text>The October Country is a 1955 collection of nineteen macabre short stories by American writer Ray Bradbury. It reprints fifteen of the twenty-seven stories of his 1947 collection &quot;Dark Carnival&quot;, and adds four more of his stories previously published elsewhere.

The collection was published in numerous editions by Ballantine Books. The 1955 hardcover and 1956 and 1962 softcover versions featured artwork by Joseph Mugnaini that was replaced in 1971 by an entirely different Bob Pepper illustration. It was again published in 1996, by Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books; the illustrations within were drawn by Mugnaini. This edition included a foreword by Bradbury, titled &quot;May I Die Before My Voices&quot;, in Los Angeles, California, on April 24, 1996.

&quot;The October Country&quot; was published in the United Kingdom by Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd. in 1956, and reissued in 1976 by Grafton, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. The 1976 UK paperback edition includes &quot;The Traveler&quot;, originally from the aforementioned &quot;Dark Carnival&quot;, and omits &quot;The Next In Line&quot;, &quot;The Lake&quot;, &quot;The Small Assassin&quot;, &quot;The Crowd&quot;, &quot;Jack-In-The-Box&quot;, &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot; and &quot;The Cistern&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;The October Country&quot; was published by Avon Books, Inc. with a new cover illustration by Joseph Mugnaini, and a new introduction by Bradbury called &quot;Homesteading the October Country&quot;.

<doc id="1209574" wikidata="Q2178643" url="?curid=1209574" title="Hjalmar and Ingeborg">
<text>Hjalmar () and Ingeborg () were a legendary Swedish duo. The male protagonist Hjalmar and his duel for Ingeborg figures in the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; and in &quot;Orvar-Odd&#x27;s saga&quot;, as well as in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, &quot;Lay of Hyndla&quot; and a number of Faroese ballads. Hjalmar never lost a battle until meeting a berserker wielding the cursed sword Tyrfing.

==A tale of two heroes==
Hjalmar was one of the mythical Swedish king Yngvi&#x27;s housecarls at Uppsala. He and princess Ingeborg were in love, but the king said no to his requests for marriage, since he hoped for a suitor with a better pedigree.

Hjalmar&#x27;s reputation as a courageous and valiant warrior was great and it reached the most remote parts of Norway, where the Norwegian hero Orvar-Odd felt a desire to test his fighting skills with Hjalmar. Thus Orvar-Odd sailed to Sweden with five ships and met Hjalmar who had fifteen ships. Hjalmar could not accept such an uneven balance of strength and sent away ten of his own ships so that the forces would be even. The two warriors fought for two days with a lot of blood-letting and poetry, but it was a draw. Finally, they realized that they were equals and decided to become blood brothers by letting their blood flow under a strand of turf raised by a spear. Then the strand of turf was put back during oaths and incantations. Orvar-Odd accompanied Hjalmar back to Uppsala, where he soon discovered the feelings between Hjalmar and Ingeborg. Orvar-Odd offered to help Hjalmar elope with Ingeborg, but Hjalmar declined and suffered patiently until a suitor arrived that Hjalmar could not tolerate.

==The sons of Arngrim==
Further south, on Bolmsö, lived the feared berserker Arngrim and his twelve sons. They were all infamous berserkers who spread fear and destruction throughout the North. The eldest was a head taller than the rest and his name was Angantyr, and it was to him that Arngrim had entrusted the sword Tyrfing, which had been cursed by its makers, the Dwarves Dvalinn and Durin. This sword would cause three evil deeds and one man had to die every time it was unsheathed. The next eldest was Hjorvard and one Yule, when everyone was at home and bragged about what they would accomplish the following year, Hjorvard declared that he was to marry princess Ingeborg at Uppsala.

==The proposal==

In the spring, the twelve brothers arrived at Uppsala and Hjorvard asked for Ingeborg&#x27;s hand, but this was something Hjalmar would not tolerate. Hjalmar stepped forth and said that he deserved the princess more than a strange berserker. The king who was uncomfortable with having twelve infamous berserkers in his hall declared that he could not possibly choose between two so great men, and thus he preferred to let Ingeborg make the choice herself. Naturally, Ingeborg chose Hjalmar and this vexed Hjorvard who challenged the happy Hjalmar to a duel on Samsø, and reminded that Hjalmar would be &quot;niðingr&quot; if he did not turn up.

==The duel on Samsø==
On the designated day, Hjalmar and Orvar-Odd arrived to Munarvágr on Samsø, and immediately stepped ashore to search for their adversaries. They soon found the scattered and gory remains of the crewmen, who had been slaughtered by the twelve berserkers. Orvar-Odd immediately went to the forest and cut himself a huge club (according to Saxo, he took a rudder), whereupon the two companions continued their search for the twelve brothers.

The decision was that one of the pair would fight Angantyr who wielded the sword Tyrfing, leaving the other to contend with the other eleven berserkers including the rival suitor Hjorvard. Orvar-Odd wore a silken (or silver) shirt () which nothing could pierce, thus offered to take on Angantyr, but Hjalmar would hear none of it, accusing his sworn brother of taking away the better part of the glory. The variant description in Odd&#x27;s saga is as follows: Angantyr reckons himself equal to three of his brothers when armed with his sword, forged by dwarfs and which will &quot;bite anything, even iron or rock.&quot; Hjalmar is eager to fight him nevertheless, thinking that his four-ringed mailcoat will afford him sufficient protection, even though Odd warns against the folly of it.

Orvar-Odd quickly defeated Hjorvard and ten of the brothers, and started to look for Hjalmar. He found Angantyr dead, but Hjalmar was lethally wounded by Tyrfing. In his dying breath, Hjalmar composed a poem which was meant to be communicated to his beloved princess Ingeborg back in Uppsala.

==Hjalmar&#x27;s death song==
The composed poem, commonly known as &quot;Hjalmar&#x27;s death song&quot; is found inserted in the older text of &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot; as well as in &quot;Örvar-Odds saga&quot;, though the texts diverge considerably. In German it has been dubbed &quot;Hiálmars Sterbelied&quot;, and classed by Andreas Heusler as one of the so-called &quot;Eddica minora&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Orvar-Odd buried all the slain men in barrows and Tyrfing. The agreement made beforehand that the slain would be given dignified burial together with their slain arms, Hjalmar with his mail-shirt, Angantyr with Tyrfing, and Odd too, had he been killed, with his shirt of protection and arrows (presumably the magic arrows named Gusir&#x27;s Gifts). Perhaps it was so as to ensure that it would not cause a second and third malicious deed, after Hjalmar&#x27;s death. Then he sailed alone back to Uppsala with Hjalmar&#x27;s corpse. Odd remembers in his own death-poem that he piggybacked Hjalmar&#x27;s corpse to Sigtuna in Uppsala. When Ingeborg learned of Hjalmar&#x27;s death, she fell dead also. The two lovers were buried in the same barrow.

Tyrfing would not remain buried. For its continued adventures, see Hervor.

<doc id="1209581" wikidata="Q7400159" url="?curid=1209581" title="Sail training">
<text>From its modern interpretations to its antecedents when maritime nations would send young naval officer candidates to sea (e.g., see Outward Bound), sail training provides an unconventional and effective way of building many useful skills on and off the water.

== Background ==
By 1900 most commercial sailing vessels were struggling to turn a profit in the face of competition from more modern steam ships which had become efficient enough to steam shorter great circle routes between ports instead of the longer trade wind routes used by sailing ships.

Ships were built larger to carry bulk cargoes more efficiently, their rigs were simplified to reduce manning costs and speed was no longer a premium. Owners shipped cargoes that were non-perishable so that their dates of arrival (which steam ships had started to guarantee) were of less importance. Finally as the Panama Canal was opened, sailing ships were used in parts of the world where steam ships still found it hard to operate, mainly on: 
*the Chilean nitrate trade (for fertilizers and explosive production in Europe), and on
*the Australian grain trade.
Both Chilean and Australian ports were difficult to supply with coal for steamships to refuel. Also, both routes to Europe went round Cape Horn.
The end of the First World War saw a brief return to profitability as all ship types were in scarce supply due to wartime losses but that boom became bust as many new steam ships were built to replace the sailing ships that were lost.

==Genesis in the 1930s==
While many countries of the world operated sailing ships as training ships for officers in their merchant marine in the 1920s and 30s, several sailing ship owners such as Carl Laeisz and Gustaf Erikson determined that there was still a profit to be made from the last of the sailing ships.

Erikson purchased existing ships that required the minimum of capital investment and repaired them with parts cannibalised from other ships. Identifying the bulk cargo routes that would still offer paying freights, he manned the ships with a smattering of paid experienced officers.

Some of the deckhands were apprentices from steamship lines and other adventurous youth who had paid a premium to sail while being trained, some recruited for very modest salaries. The apprentices were considered trainees and were the first formalization of sail trainers with crew drawn from members of the public who just went for the adventure, as opposed to a career.

With manning costs netted out on Erikson&#x27;s balance sheet, the ships continued to return a paper profit. However Erikson was under no illusions as to the long term profitability of his venture, which depended on ignoring the depreciation on his ships and a shrinking supply of sound hulls and rigs. The company would use their profits to diversify into steam after the Second World War. While the shipping companies of Erickson and F. Laeisz gradually turned to steam, the next generation of captains were climbing up the hawsehole and taking command of their own vessels, redefining sail training as a purely educational endeavour with trainees as the cargo.

From 1932 through 1958, Irving Johnson and his wife Electa circumnavigated the world seven times with amateur youth crews on board their vessels named &quot;Yankee&quot;. Over the years, their voyages were featured in books they authored, and in National Geographic magazines and TV specials like &quot;Irving Johnson, High Seas Adventurer&quot;. Their archives are at Mystic Seaport, Connecticut.

Australian Alan Villiers purchased the old school ship &quot;George Stage&quot; from Denmark in 1934. Renaming her the , he sailed her round the world with no paying cargo and a crew of youth who had paid to be there. He also took as many non-paying youth as he could afford to fit in the budget, those he considered at risk on the streets of their inner cities and in need of what was then called &quot;character building&quot;. These trips were the genesis of current modern sail training, using manually operated ships and the harsh discipline imposed by the sea to further personal development and taking those disadvantaged by circumstance to benefit from the experience.

By the end of the Second World War, the numbers of traditionally rigged sailing ships left were dwindling and public interest waned. After the German school ship sank in 1932, killing 69, the loss of in 1957 and in 1961 drew further ill will and seemed to signal the end of an era.

==Modern sail training==

In what was conceived to be last great gathering of square-riggers under sail, Bernard Morgan and Greville Howard persuaded a number of ship owners to join together in a sort of farewell salute in 1956, organizing a race from Torbay on the South Coast of England to race informally across the Bay of Biscay to Lisbon in Portugal. Five square rigged school ships entered the race, Denmark&#x27;s , Norway&#x27;s &quot;Christian Radich&quot; and &quot;Sorlandet&quot;, Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Mercator&quot; and Portugal&#x27;s first &quot;Sagres&quot;. The vessels met again the following year and every year since in an annual series that would astonish its original organizers today. Old vessels were saved or repaired and new purpose built sail training vessels were commissioned. With renewed interest in the age of sail, national sail training associations affiliated to Sail Training International (STI) (formerly &quot;Sail Training Association&quot;) were organized and large summer events find upwards of 100 ships racing across the oceans.

Crew exchanges allow young people from one country to sail with those from another. Long before the end of the Cold War, ships from Russia and Poland (which in some cases had been built in Germany) joined the International Fleet in 1974. A limited exchange between the East and West was initiated. One of the largest of the affiliate organizations of the STI is the American Sail Training Association (ASTA). Founded in 1973 with a handful of vessels, it has since grown to encompass an international organization with more than 250 tall ships representing 25 different countries. The UK National Member of STI is the Association of Sail Training Organisations (ASTO) Founded in 1972, http://www.asto.org.uk

Square rigged seamanship was in danger of becoming a lost art. As the 1997 restoration of neared completion, the United States Navy called on the crew of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; to train her sailors to sail the vessel as originally intended.

Many boats are historical vessels and replicas which require coordinated manual labor to sail, operating in the original tradition proposed by Alan Villiers and Irving Johnson such as the while others are purpose built educational platforms carrying out scientific research under sail such as and of the Sea Education Association. Another new direction is the development of floating maritime heritage centres, connected to a sail training organisation, and often in co-ordination with land based maritime museums. is one such example of this, with visitors to the Bilbao Maritime Museum enjoying free entry to the ship during the winter months when she is moored nearby. As the crew of the and the award-winning program at the Los Angeles Maritime Institute like to say &quot;We do not train youth for a life at sea ... we use the sea to educate youth for life&quot;.

==Vessel classifications==
Tall ships have been found to be effective platforms for sail training as they combine many elements fundamental to sail training.
A &quot;tall ship&quot; is not a strictly defined type of vessel. The term is commonly used today to define a large, traditionally rigged vessel, whether or not is it technically a full-rigged ship. For example, is technically a barque. A tall ship is usually defined by the topmast and topsails she carries as opposed to the modern high-aspect-ratio rigs and marconi mains carried by the sloops and yawls seen in every harbor today.

For the purpose of classification and race rating, the STI divides tall ships into the following classes :

:Class A: All vessels over 160 feet in length overall, regardless of rig, and square rigged vessels over 120 feet in length.
:Class A; Division II: All square rigged vessels less than 120 feet in length.
:Class B: Fore-and-aft rigged vessels between 100 feet and 160 feet in length
:Class C: All other fore-and-aft rigged vessels at least 30 feet long at the waterline.

The United States Coast Guard classifies vessels based on their intended use and structure, prescribing requirements for captain and crew manning, waters the vessel may operate in, number of passengers allowed and minimum safety equipment required.

With the exception of uninspected vessels, all such vessels are inspected annually and issued a Certificate of Inspection (COI) which must be displayed on the vessel and spells out the requirements that vessel must maintain.

:Sailing School Vessel (SSV): Inspected under Title 46, Subchapter R of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). An SSV is a vessel of less than 500 gross tons carrying six or more sailing school students or instructors, primarily propelled by sail, and operated by a nonprofit educational organization exclusively for the purpose of sailing education.

:Passenger Vessel: Certified according to the size and number of passengers (not engaged in educational activities or in the operation of the vessel) carried under Title 46 of the CFR.
::Subchapter C: Uninspected vessels which operate with no more than six passengers.
::Subchapter T: Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than six passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.
::Subchapter K: Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than 150 passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.
::Subchapter H: Passenger vessels of more than 100 gross tons that carry passengers for hire and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.

:Attraction Vessel: Certification is required whenever a vessel is open to public boarding or conducts dockside programs. The vessel may be permanently moored to a pier, or it may be certified under one or more of the above subchapters, but the Attraction Vessel COI certifies its safety for dockside and visitation only.

:Oceanographic Research Vessel (ORV): Certified under Subchapter U of Title 46 of the CFR. An ORV is a vessel employed exclusively in either oceanographic (saltwater) or limnologic (freshwater) instruction and/or research, and is not necessarily equipped for passengers or other non-professionals.

<doc id="1209584" wikidata="Q10567797" url="?curid=1209584" title="John Brayley">
<text>John Desmond Brayley, Baron of Cardiff and County Glamorgan, MC, DL (29 January 1917 – 16 March 1977) was a British Army officer and wealthy self made businessman and Labour Government Army Minister.

== Army career ==
Brayley was Welsh by birth, having been born in Pontypridd, Glamorgan. He went to the local grammar school. At the age of 17 he joined the Royal Artillery and later became a physical training instructor. He was an enthusiastic boxer and became Army Boxing Champion. During the war he served in the Parachute Regiment, winning the Military Cross in 1943 for action in the North African desert campaign. He was part of a unit – a forerunner for today&#x27;s special forces, set up to train soldiers to parachute behind enemy lines and cause as much disruption to the enemy as possible. He also served in Sicily and Crete and was mentioned in despatches (23 September 1943). Later Brayley held the Honorary rank of Colonel Commandant, Royal Artillery, normally a position reserved for royalty.

==Business and political career==
In 1946 he joined Phoenix Glass Co Ltd, Bristol which did well through his discovery of markets for its glass bottles. He then moved to manufacturing in Canning Town Glassworks Group, where he became chairman in 1961. He never claimed to know anything about glass, only how to run a team and he built up the company, which made substantial profits for some years.

He shared with George Wigg, Labour&#x27;s Paymaster General an enthusiasm for horse-racing and owned several of his own horses. He was introduced to Harold Wilson and they became friends. On the Prime Minister&#x27;s defeat in 1970 Sir Desmond made his personal chauffeur, Rolls-Royce and London home available to Harold Wilson, who later recommended Brayley for a Knighthood. On 22 June 1973 Sir Desmond was created a life peer as Baron Brayley &quot;of the City of Cardiff in the County of Glamorgan&quot;.

He was awarded government office in March 1974 as Under-Secretary of State for the Army. At this point he resigned as chairman of his company, and sold his shares for over £1 million. After inquiries were made into a company with which he had once been involved, he signed a letter of resignation rather than cause the Prime Minister any embarrassment. Despite an initial but extensive enquiry into his business dealings nothing was ever proved before his death in 1977

He became a Deputy Lieutenant for Greater London in 1970, was a justice of the peace for Middlesex, and at one time chairman and trustee of the Saints and Sinners Club in London.

==Lifestyle==
Brayley was a wealthy self-made man who lived in some style and had a penthouse at Arlington House, Piccadilly, and also Hailey House, a country house in Oxfordshire. He enjoyed returning to Cardiff for social occasions and to watch Wales play rugby from the balcony of his apartment. He was a keen yachtsman and owned &#x27;Natalie&#x27; a 527 tonne, 177-foot classic motor yacht. He was also a keen angler, and civilian air pilot.

Despite his considerable wealth he never forgot his roots and was deeply affected by the poverty surrounding him when he grew up in Rhydyfelin as a boy.[&quot;&quot;]

==Philanthropy==
As well as being a Freemason, he was on the board of The Royal Artillery Association and was a member of The Grand Order of Water Rats, the show business charity organisation. He was a Freeman of the City of London, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Patron of the Royal Masonic Hospital

==Death==
Lord Brayley died in Cardiff after a short illness in March 1977 aged 60. 
His marriage was dissolved in 1960. He is survived by two daughters, two grandsons and four great grand daughters.

<doc id="1209585" wikidata="Q5656368" url="?curid=1209585" title="Dwarf elephant">
<text>Dwarf elephants are prehistoric members of the order Proboscidea which, through the process of allopatric speciation on islands, evolved much smaller body sizes (around shoulder height) in comparison with their immediate ancestors. Dwarf elephants are an example of insular dwarfism, the phenomenon whereby large terrestrial vertebrates (usually mammals) that colonize islands evolve dwarf forms, a phenomenon attributed to adaptation to resource-poor environments and lack of predation and competition.

Fossil remains of dwarf elephants have been found on the Mediterranean islands of Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily, Sardinia, the Cyclades Islands and the Dodecanese Islands, which are mostly members of the genus &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;, descending from the large tall straight-tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;) of mainland Europe&quot;,&quot; though two species represent dwarf mammoths. Dwarf species of elephants and &quot;Stegodon&quot; have been found on the islands of Indonesia and the Philippines, with dwarfed species of &quot;Stegodon&quot; also having been found in Japan. The Channel Islands of California once supported the pygmy mammoth, a dwarf species descended from Columbian mammoths, while the woolly mammoths that existed on Wrangel Island north of Siberia were once considered dwarfs, but are not anymore.

==The Mediterranean islands==
Dwarf elephants first inhabited the Mediterranean islands during the Pleistocene, including all the major islands with the apparent exception of Corsica and the Balearics. Mediterranean dwarf elephants have generally been considered as members of the genus &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;, derived from the continental straight-tusked elephant, &quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot; (Falconer &amp; Cautley, 1847), Syn.: &quot;Elephas antiquus&quot;. An exception is the dwarf Middle-Late Pleistocene Sardinian mammoth, &quot;Mammuthus lamarmorai&quot; (Major, 1883), the first endemic elephant of the Mediterranean islands recognized as belonging to the mammoth line. &quot;Mammuthus creticus&quot; from the Early Pleistocene of Crete, formerly considered a member of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;, is now also considered to be a mammoth, and approaches the size of the smallest dwarf elephants.

During low sea levels, the Mediterranean islands were colonised again and again, giving rise, sometimes on the same island, to several species (or subspecies) of different body sizes. The island of Sicily appears to have been colonised by proboscideans in at least two separate waves of colonisation. These endemic dwarf elephants were taxonomically different on each island or group of very close islands, like the Cyclades archipelago.

There are many uncertainties about the time of colonisation, the phylogenetic relationships and the taxonomic status of dwarf elephants on the Mediterranean islands. Extinction of the insular dwarf elephants has not been correlated with the arrival of humans to the islands, with the exception of &quot;Palaeoloxodon cypriotes&quot; on Cyprus, which survived until human colonisation of the island around 12,000 years ago.

Palaeontologist Othenio Abel in 1914, that the finding of skeletons of such elephants sparked the idea that they belonged to giant one-eyed monsters, because the center nasal opening was thought to be the socket of a single eye, and thus perhaps were, for example, the origin of the one-eyed Cyclopes of Greek mythology. While this claim has been widely been repeated, it has been criticised for lacking evidence.
===Italy and Malta===

Sicily and Malta were inhabited by two successive waves of dwarf elephants derived from &quot;P. antiquus,&quot; which first arrived on the islands at least 500,000 years ago. The first of these species is &quot;P. falconeri ,&quot; which is one of the smallest dwarf elephant species at around tall, and was strongly modified from its ancestor in numerous aspects, which lived in a depauperate fauna with no other large mammal species.&quot;&quot; Later, around 200,000 years ago, this species was replaced by a second colonisation by &quot;P. antiquus&quot;, which gave rise to the larger (though still considerably dwarfed) tall species &quot;P. mnaidriensis,&quot; which on Sicily lived alongside a number other large mammal species, including herbivores and carnivores. The youngest records of this species on Sicily date to around 20,000 years ago, close to the time of arrival of modern humans on Sicily.

The dwarf mammoth species &quot;Mammuthus lamarmorai&quot; descended from steppe mammoths (&quot;Mammuthus trogontherii&quot;) that colonised Sardinia sometime after 450,000 years ago. It is suggested to have survived into the Last Glacial Period, until at least 60-30,000 years ago.

===Greece===
====Crete====
&quot;Mammuthus creticus&quot; is known from remains probably dating to the Early Pleistocene. It likely descends from &quot;Mammuthus meridionalis&quot;. It is the smallest mammoth and is among the smallest dwarf elephants known, with a shoulder height of about and a weight of about . &quot;Palaeoloxodon creutzburgi&quot; from the Middle Pleistocene and Late Pleistocene is significantly larger, with an estimated body mass comparable to living Asian elephant, around 40% the size of its mainland ancestor.

====Cyclades====


Remains of dwarf elephants have been briefly reported from Paros, Milos and Serifos in historical publications, but these lack any detailed information.

On Kýthnos, the remains of a dwarf elephant were reported in a 1975 publication to be found associated with lithic artefacts. The age of the find was considered to be uncertain, likely older than 9,000 years, but could not be dated precisely due to a lack of collagen. Additionally, an isolated tusk was reported from the northwest of the island.

On Delos, an indeterminate dwarf elephant known from a third molar was reported in 1908. This specimen clearly belongs to a dwarf species, but it is difficult to quantify its size precisely. On Naxos the species &quot;Palaeoloxodon lomolinoi&quot; has been described based on a partial skull including the maxilla bones and third molar teeth found near the Trypiti river, of probable Late Pleistocene age.&quot;&quot; It is estimated to be around 8% the size of &quot;P. antiquus&quot;, and had a smaller body size than that represented by the dwarf elephant from Delos. The Eastern Cyclades islands of Delos, Naxos, and Paros were connected during the Last Glacial Period, which suggests that the Delos species and &quot;P. lomolinoi&quot; were not contemporaneous, with the former possibly being the ancestor of the latter, though nothing can be said for certain.

====Dodecanese====
On Rhodes, bones of an unnamed endemic dwarf elephant have been discovered in cave deposits on the east coast. This elephant was similar in size to &quot;Palaeoloxodon mnaidriensis&quot; (to which its remains were originally attributed), around 20% the size of its mainland ancestor (with an estimated weight of around ). The remains, though temporally poorly constrained, are suggested to be Late Pleistocene age. Possible tracks produced by these dwarf elephants have been reported from the southwest of the island.

On Tilos, the species &quot;Palaeoloxodon tiliensis&quot; has been described from remains found in Charkadio cave. This species was medium-sized, around 10% the size of &quot;P. antiquus&quot;, with a shoulder height of up to , with a body mass of . Remains of the species are suggested to date to Late Pleistocene. Radiocarbon dating done in the 1970s suggested that the species survived until around 3,500 years ago, which would make the latest surviving &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; species and the youngest elephant in Europe, but these dates are tentative and await corroboration by other research.

On Astypalaia, a single tusk of a dwarf elephant of unknown age was excavated in the late 1990s. Due to the isolated status of the island it very likely represents an endemic species. Though the size of the animal is difficult to constrain precisely, it was probably similar in size to &quot;P. tiliensis&quot;.

On Kasos, which during the Pleistocene was connected with the islands of Karpathos and Saria, a single dwarf &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; molar has been found. Due to the tooth closely resembling those of the species &quot;P. creutzburgi&quot; from Crete (which is adjacent to Kasos) in size and shape, it has been referred to as &quot;P.&quot; aff. &quot;creutzburgi.&quot;

===Cyprus===
The Cyprus dwarf elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon cypriotes&quot;) survived at least until 12,000 years ago, around the time of arrival of modern humans to Cyprus (who may have hunted it), making it one of the latest surviving dwarf elephants. It is also one of the smallest dwarf elephant species, comparable in size to &quot;P. falconeri&quot;, with an estimated shoulder height of . The species likely evolved from the earlier larger (though still strongly dwarfed) &quot;Palaeoloxodon xylophagou&quot; known from fossils dating to around 200,000 years ago.

Remains of the species were first discovered and recorded by Dorothea Bate in a cave in the Kyrenia hills of northern Cyprus in 1902 and reported in 1903.

==The Channel Islands of California==

A population of the Columbian mammoth (&quot;Mammuthus columbi&quot;) arrived on the northern Channel Islands of California during the late Middle Pleistocene, around 250-150,000 years ago, giving rise to a dwarfed species, the pygmy mammoth (&quot;Mammuthus exilis&quot;). Channel Islands mammoths ranged from in shoulder height. These mammoths became extinct around 13,000 years ago, around the time of arrival of modern humans to the islands.

==Indonesia and the Philippines==
In Indonesia and the Philippines, evidence of a succession of distinct endemic island faunas has been found, including dwarfed elephants and species of &quot;Stegodon&quot;.

===Flores===

During the late Early Pleistocene, Flores was inhabited by the dwarf species &quot;Stegodon sondaarii&quot;, around 15% of the size of mainland &quot;Stegodon&quot; species, which was around tall at the shoulder and weighed about . This species became extinct around 1 million years ago, being replaced by &quot;Stegodon florensis. Stegodon florensis&quot; shows a progressive size reduction with time, with the earlier Middle Pleistocene subspecies &quot;Stegodon florensis florensis&quot; estimated to be around 50% the size of mainland &quot;Stegodon&quot; species with a shoulder height of around and a body mass of around 1.7 tons, while the later &quot;Stegodon florensis insularis&quot; from the Late Pleistocene is estimated to be around 17% the size of mainland &quot;Stegodon&quot; species, with a shoulder height of around , and a body mass of about &quot;Stegodon florensis&quot; became extinct about 50,000 years ago, around the time of the arrival of modern humans to Flores.

===Sulawesi===
During the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene on Sulawesi, two species of dwarf proboscidean coinhabited the island, the elephant &quot;Stegoloxodon celebensis&quot;, and &quot;Stegodon sompoensis.&quot; The former was about tall, while the latter was around 32% the size of mainland &quot;Stegodon&quot; species, with an estimated body mass of about a ton. Later in the Pleistocene, these animals were replaced by larger-sized species of &quot;Stegodon&quot; and elephants, with an indeterminate &quot;Stegodon&quot; species from the Middle Pleistocene of Sulawesi being around 57% the size of mainland species, with an estimated bodymass of about 2 tons.

===Java===
The species &quot;Stegodon trigonocephalus&quot; is known from the Early-Middle Pleistocene of Java. A population from the Trinil H.K locality, which likely dates to the Middle Pleistocene, is around 65% the size of mainland &quot;Stegodon&quot; species. Large individuals are estimated to have reached around at the shoulders, with a body mass of around 5 tons. Other smaller unnamed &quot;Stegodon&quot; species are also known from the Early Pleistocene on the island. The extinct dwarf elephant species &quot;Stegoloxodon indonesicus&quot; is also known from the Early Pleistocene of Java, which is probably closely related to &quot;S. celebensis&quot; from Sulawesi, but whose relationships to other elephants are obscure.

=== Sumba ===
The species &quot;Stegodon sumbaensis&quot; of an uncertain Middle-Late Pleistocene age from Sumba is one the smallest known species, at around 8% of the size of its mainland ancestor, with an estimated body mass of around .

=== Timor ===
The species &quot;Stegodon timorensis&quot; is known from the Middle Pleistocene of Timor. It is a small-sized species, only slightly larger than &quot;S. sondaarii,&quot; and around 23% the size of mainland species, with an estimated body mass of around .

=== Luzon ===
On Luzon the dwarf &quot;Stegodon luzonensis&quot; is known from remains found in the Manila Basin of an uncertain Pleistocene age, as well as remains found near the early Middle Pleistocene &quot;Nesorhinus&quot; butchery site dating to around 700,000 years ago. It is around 40% the size of mainland &quot;Stegodon&quot; species, with a body mass of around 1.3 tons. Though the temporal span of &quot;Stegodon&quot; on Luzon is not well constrained due to the limited number of finds, remains are suggested to span from at least around 1-0.8 million years ago to around 400,000 years ago. The extinct dwarf elephant &quot;Elephas beyeri&quot; is also known from the island of an unknown (probably Pleistocene) age, which is estimated to have been about in shoulder height.

=== Mindanao ===
On the island of Mindanao, the dwarf &quot;Stegodon&quot; species &quot;Stegodon mindanensis&quot; was present at some point in the Pleistocene. It has an estimated body mass of around .

== Japan ==
Some species of the stegodontid &quot;Stegolophodon&quot; from the Middle Miocene of Japan around 16 million years ago have been suggested to exhibit insular dwarfism, appearing to exhibit size reduction over time, which would make them the oldest known proboscideans to do so.

During Pliocene-Early Pleistocene (from around 4-1 million years ago), a succession of endemic dwarf species of &quot;Stegodon,&quot; probably representing a single lineage lived in the Japanese archipelago, probably derived from the mainland Chinese &quot;S. zydanskyi.&quot; In chronological succession these species are &quot;Stegodon miensis&quot; (4-3 million years ago) &quot;Stegodon protoaurorae&quot; (3-2 million years ago) and &quot;Stegodon aurorae,&quot; (2-1 million years ago) which show a progressive size reduction through time, possibly as a result of reducing land area of the Japanese archipelago. The latest and smallest species &quot;S. aurorae&quot; is estimated to be 25% the size of its mainland ancestor with a body mass of around .

During the late Middle Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene around 330,000-24,000 years ago, the Japanese archipelago was inhabited by the elephant species &quot;Palaeoloxodon naumanni.&quot; This species was only modestly dwarfed compared to its large continental ancestor, having a reconstructed shoulder height of , for males and around for females.

==Wrangel Island==
During the Holocene, woolly mammoths (&quot;Mammuthus primigenius&quot;) lived on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean, surviving thousands of years after the extinction of mainland woolly mammoths until around 2000 BCE, the most recent survival of any known mammoth population. Wrangel Island is thought to have become separated from the mainland by 12000 BCE. It was assumed that Wrangel Island mammoths ranged from in shoulder height and were for a time considered &quot;dwarf mammoths&quot;. However this classification has been re-evaluated and since the Second International Mammoth Conference in 1999, these mammoths are no longer considered to be true &quot;dwarf mammoths&quot;, as their size falls within the range of that of mainland Siberian woolly mammoths.

== Factors influencing dwarfism ==
The factors influencing dwarfism of proboscideans have been considered complex and particular to each island, though resource limitation has been considered to be a likely major driver on all islands. Length of isolation has been considered an important factor, with dwarf proboscideans isolated for longer generally being smaller than those isolated for a more brief period of time. Distance from the mainland beyond the minimum distance of around required for speciation is suggested to not be an important factor, at least directly. Island area is only weakly correlated with body size. Competition with other herbivores is suggested to be important factor, resulting in a reduced level of dwarfism where they are present. The effect of the presence of large carnivores is unclear, but is suggested to depend on the diversity of the carnivore guild.

<doc id="1209592" wikidata="Q555978" url="?curid=1209592" title="Charles Booth (social reformer)">
<text>Charles James Booth (30 March 1840 – 23 November 1916) was a British shipowner, Comtean positivist, social researcher, and reformer, best known for his innovative philanthropic studies on working-class life in London towards the end of the 19th century.

During the 1860s Booth became interested in the philosophy of Auguste Comte, the founder of modern sociology, and converted to his Religion of Humanity, affiliated with members of the London Positivist Society, and wrote positivist prayers. He was captivated by Comte&#x27;s idea that in the future, scientific industrialists would be in control of the social leadership instead of the church ministers. Booth&#x27;s work, followed by that of Seebohm Rowntree, influenced government policy regarding poverty in the early 20th century and helped initiate Old Age pensions and free school meals for the poorest children. In addition, his research would also demonstrate how poverty was influenced by religion, education, and administration.

Booth is best known for his multi-volume book &quot;Life and Labour of the People in London&quot; (1902), which focuses on the statistics he collected regarding poverty in London. &quot;Life and Labour&quot; &quot;discusses a range of social conditions in which it reported that it appeared people are likely to be poor or on the margins of poverty.&quot; Booth is also recognised for influencing the transition of social attitudes from the Victorian Age to the 20th century.

Due to his investigations on poverty, some honour Charles Booth as one of the founding fathers of social administration, and regard his work crucial when studying social policy.

==Early life and education==

Born at Liverpool, Lancashire, on 30 March 1840 to Charles Booth and Emily Fletcher, his father was a wealthy shipowner and corn merchant as well as being a prominent Unitarian. He attended the Royal Institution School in Liverpool before being apprenticed in the family business at the age of sixteen. He joined his brother, Alfred Booth, in the leather trade in 1862 and together they established a successful shipping line, in which Charles remained actively involved until his retirement in 1912.

Booth became alienated from the dominant, nonconformist business class of Liverpool into which he had been born.

==Career==
Booth&#x27;s father died in 1860, bequeathing him control of the family business. He entered the skinning and leather business with his elder brother Alfred, and they set up Alfred Booth and Company establishing offices in Liverpool and New York City with a £20,000 inheritance. In 1865 Booth campaigned for the Liberals in Toxteth, Liverpool, albeit unsuccessfully.

After learning the shipping trade, Booth was able to persuade Alfred and his sister Emily to invest in steamships and established a service to Pará, Maranhão, and Ceará in Brazil. Then in 1866 Charles and Alfred Booth commenced the start of a shipping service between Brazil and Europe named the Booth Steamship Company. Charles himself went on the first voyage to Brazil on 14 February 1866. He was also involved in the building of a harbor at Manaus which overcame seasonal fluctuations in water levels. Booth described this as his &quot;monument&quot; (to shipping) when he visited Manaus for the last time in 1912. Booth would write letters to his wife describing the business problems that would rise such as personnel management, decision making, and factory relocation; this laid a foundation for the fundamentals of business ethics. Booth Shipping Line&#x27;s biggest rival was R. Singlehurst and Company, but Booth kept calm while managing business affairs.

Booth initially engaged in politics, canvassing unsuccessfully for the Liberal Party in the General Election of 1865. Following the Conservative Party victory in municipal elections in 1866, his interest in active politics waned. This result changed Booth&#x27;s attitude, when he concluded that he could contribute more by commissioning social studies, rather than by being a representative in Parliament.

===Social research===

In 1886, influenced earlier by positivism, Booth embarked on his major survey of London life and labour conditions for which he became famous and commonly regarded as initiating the systematic study of poverty in Britain. Booth was critical of the existing statistical data on poverty. By analyzing census returns he argued that they were unsatisfactory, later being invited to sit on a parliamentary committee in 1891 which suggested improvements that could be made to them. Due to the scale of the survey, results were published serially but it took over fifteen years before the full seventeen volume edition was published. His work on the study and his concern with the problems of poverty led to an involvement in campaigning for old-age pensions and promoting the decasualisation of labour.

Booth publicly criticised the claims of Henry Hyndman, the leader of the Social Democratic Federation, Britain&#x27;s first socialist party. In the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; of 1885, Hyndman stated that 25% of Londoners lived in abject poverty. The survey of life and labour began with a pilot study in Tower Hamlets. Booth then hired numerous researchers to assist with the full study of the whole of London, which investigated the three main topics of poverty, occupations, and religion. Among his researchers were his cousin Beatrice Potter (Beatrice Webb) and the chapter on women&#x27;s work was conducted by the budding economist Clara Collet. This research, which looked at the incidence of pauperism in the East End of London, showed that 35% were living in abject poverty – even higher than the original figure. This work was published under the title &quot;Life and Labour of the People&quot; in 1889. A second volume, entitled &quot;Labour and Life of the People&quot;, covering the rest of London, appeared in 1891. Booth also popularised the idea of a &quot;poverty line&quot;, a concept conceived by the London School Board. Booth set this line at 10 to 20 shillings a week, which he considered to be the minimum amount necessary for a family of 4 or 5 people to subsist.

After the first two volumes were published Booth expanded his research. This investigation was carried out by Booth himself with his team of researchers. Nonetheless, Booth continued to oversee his successful shipping business which funded his philanthropic work. The fruit of this research was a second expanded edition of his original work, published as &quot;Life and Labour of the People in London&quot; in nine volumes between 1892 and 1897. A third edition (now expanded to seventeen volumes) appeared in 1902–3.

Booth used his work to argue for the introduction of Old Age Pensions which he described as &quot;limited socialism&quot;. Booth suggested that such reforms would help prevent a socialist revolution from occurring in Britain. Booth was far from tempted by the ideals of socialism, but had sympathy with the working classes and, as part of his investigations, he took lodgings with working-class families and recorded his thoughts and findings in his diaries.

=== London poverty maps ===
From 1886 to 1903, while Charles Booth was conducting his landmark survey on the life and labour of London&#x27;s poorest inhabitants he created poverty maps to illustrate the conditions of the lives of these people. Booth&#x27;s maps were based on observations of differences in lifestyle and focused on qualitative factors: food, clothing, shelter, and relative deprivation. Booth and his team of researchers visited every street in London to assess each household&#x27;s class. The household&#x27;s class was determined by the letters A–H, with A–D constituting want, and E-H representing comfort. Booth&#x27;s maps colour-coded every street to determine and demonstrate the level of poverty or comfort. The colour-coding was also used to highlight the social conditions of the households on the streets. The objective was to expose to Victorian society the social evil, which is the problem of poverty. The maps have a strong impact on the poverty debate. Many who analyzed the maps noted how there existed greater concentrations of poverty south of the Thames, compared to the East End Slums. The colour palette of the maps also played a large role in how poverty was viewed. Areas with high concentrations of poverty were given dense and dark colours, while areas that were considered comfortable were given bright colours such as pink, blue, and red. The maps were attempting to demonstrate that the issue of poverty was a manageable problem.
The importance of Booth&#x27;s work in social statistics was recognised by the Royal Statistical Society when in 1892 he was elected President and was awarded its first Guy Medal in Gold. In 1899 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

For the purposes of poverty measurement, Booth divided the working population into eight classes, from the poorest to the best off, labeled A–H. These categories summarised economic circumstances but also had a moral dimension, with &quot;A&quot; representing the &quot;feckless, deviant or criminal&quot; groups.

=== &quot;Religious Influences&quot; series ===
During 1897, Charles Booth had spent a significant amount of money and a decade of his life studying the life conditions of the poor of late Victorian London. When reaching the final years of his survey, Booth asked himself this question: &quot;What role can religion play in these conditions?&quot; This question then led to 6 years of him and his team conducting 1,800 interviews focusing on London&#x27;s religious and secular leaders. With all the information collected Booth and his team created seven volumes called the &quot;Religious Influences&quot; series. The series showed how there was less conflict in the late 19th-century debate over &quot;charity organisation&quot;. Booth and his team of investigators discovered how the clergymen, women, and working people enjoyed engaging in the strict allocation of charity. The churchmen had the responsibility of selecting who needed charity. Many believed that overindulgence would lead to corruption. The Booth team were advocates for charity organisations but also believed that to &quot;form character&quot; that it would be beneficial to give little to nothing. The Booth interviews focused more on the money that the churchmen gave to those in poverty and had no current job than the actual influence on the church&#x27;s &quot;religious influence&quot;. Booth believed that the charity the church was giving to the poor was being wasted. Therefore, towards the end of his survey, Booth makes the proposition to abolish church relief work, and that officials would have the responsibility to assist those who would benefit greatly.

===Politics===
Booth declined subsequent offers from PM William Ewart Gladstone of elevation to the peerage (barony then viscountcy) to sit in the House of Lords. Booth engaged in Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s Birmingham Education League (1869-1877), a survey which looked into levels of work and education in Liverpool. The survey found that 25,000 children in Liverpool were neither in school or work. 

In 1904, Booth was sworn of the Privy Council.

Although his attitudes towards poverty might make him seem fairly Left-wing, Booth became more conservative in his views in later life. While some of his investigators, such as Beatrice Webb, became Socialists as a result of their research, Booth was critical of the way in which the Liberal Government appeared to support Trade Unions after winning the 1906 General Election.

==Later life==

Booth purchased William Holman Hunt&#x27;s painting &quot;&quot;The Light of The World&quot;&quot;, which he donated to the Dean and Chapter of St Paul&#x27;s in 1908.

Early in 1912 Booth stood down as chairman of Alfred Booth and Company in favour of his nephew Alfred Allen Booth but in 1915 returned willingly to work under wartime exigencies despite growing evidence of heart disease.

==Personal life and death==
On 19 April 1871, Charles Booth married Mary Macaulay, and the couple settled in London. The niece of the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, she was a cousin of the Fabian socialist and author, Beatrice Webb. Mary had a reputation for being well-educated and intelligent. Also, Mary was an advisor to Booth in his business affairs and played an active role in contributing to Booth&#x27;s survey of London life and labour conditions.

Charles and Mary Booth had 7 children, 3 sons, and 4 daughters. His eldest daughter Antonia married the Hon Sir Malcolm Macnaghten, and others married into the Ritchie and Gore Browne families.

In 1886, the Booth family moved to Grace Dieu Manor near Thringstone, Leicestershire, and this is where Charles retired to. Before he died he hosted many family gatherings in order to be surrounded by his friends, children and grandchildren. He died on 23 November 1916 of a stroke and was buried in Saint Andrew&#x27;s churchyard. A memorial dedicated to him stands on Thringstone village green, and a blue plaque has been erected on his house in South Kensington: 6 Grenville Place.

==Impact and legacy==
&quot;Life and Labour of the People in London&quot; can be seen as one of the founding texts of British sociology, drawing on both quantitative (statistical) methods and qualitative methods (particularly ethnography). It influenced Jane Addams and other Hull House reformers, W. E. B. Du Bois, the Chicago School of sociology (notably the work of Robert E. Park), and the community studies associated with the Institute of Community Studies in East London.

Booth&#x27;s poverty maps revealed that there is a spatial component to poverty as well as an environmental context of poverty. Before his maps, environmental explanations of poverty mainly interested health professionals; Booth brought environmental issues into an empirical sociological investigation.

In addition to Booth&#x27;s influence on the field of sociology, he influenced other academics as well. Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith&#x27;s repeat London survey was inspired by Booth.

Booth&#x27;s work served as an impetus for Seebohm Rowntree (1871 – 1954); he also influenced Beatrice Webb (1858 – 1943) and Helen Bosanquet (1860 – 1925).

The University of Liverpool appoints academics to the Charles Booth Chair of Social Sciences and has a collection of his manuscripts and typescript.

The London School of Economics keeps his work on an online searchable database, planned to include Booth&#x27;s unpublished notebooks, recommended by participants in a 2021 BBC Radio broadcast on his work as vivid narratives of Booth&#x27;s methods and personal response to his discoveries, but omitted from his formal publications.

==Criticisms==
The London poverty maps survey has been negatively criticised for its methodology: 
According to Professor Paul Spicker in 1990 &quot;it is important to note that Charles Booth&#x27;s studies of poverty are widely misrepresented in the literature of social policy. His work is commonly bracketed with Rowntree&#x27;s but his methods were quite different. His definition of poverty was explicitly relative; he based the description of poverty on class rather than income. He did not attempt to define need nor to identify subsistence levels of income on the basis of minimum needs; his &quot;poverty line&quot; was used as an indicator of poverty, not a definition. His approach was to identify the sorts of condition in which people were poor and to describe those conditions in a variety of ways. To this end he used a wide range of qualitative and quantitative methods in an attempt to add depth and weight to his descriptions of poverty.&quot;

Booth used school board visitors—those who undertook to ensure the attendance of children at school—to collect information on the circumstances of families. However, his extrapolation from these findings to families without school-age children was speculative. Moreover, his &quot;definitions&quot; of the poverty levels of household &quot;classes&quot; were general descriptive categories, which did not equate to specific criteria. Although the seventeen volumes were dense with often fascinating detail, it was primarily descriptive rather than analytical.

Booth&#x27;s 1902 study included antisemitic references to the impact of Jewish immigration, comparing it to the &quot;slow rising of a flood&quot; and that &quot;no Gentile could live in the same house with these poor foreign Jews, and even as neighbors they are unpleasant; and, since people of this race, though sometimes quarrelsome amongst themselves, are extremely gregarious and sociable, each small street or group of houses invaded tends to become entirely Jewish&quot;.

In 2006, Booth also received criticism for his London Poverty Maps, showing in dark and opaque colours the houses and streets where poor people lived. The palette made the areas appear as cancer or a disease to be eradicated, creating a negative connotation for that community. Nevertheless, the scaling of the map made it appear that fixing the problem would be manageable.

Booth is often compared to Seebohm Rowntree due to their concepts on poverty. Even though Rowntree&#x27;s work draws upon Booth&#x27;s investigation, many writers on poverty generally turn their attention towards Rowntree&#x27;s, because his concept clearly addressed the problem of defining a subsistence level of poverty. Both Booth and Rowntree were positivists; however, many differences between Booth and Rowntree&#x27;s methodology existed. While Booth classified people by their source of income, Rowntree made distinctions through class and specifically categorised groups by their economic relationships.

<doc id="1209596" wikidata="Q17029456" url="?curid=1209596" title="The Thousand Orcs">
<text>The Thousand Orcs is a fantasy novel by American writer R. A. Salvatore, the first book in his series &quot;The Hunter&#x27;s Blades Trilogy&quot;. In it, Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden is separated from his friends while orcs, giants, and a few drow are determined to destroy everything in their path.

==Plot summary==
In &quot;The Thousand Orcs&quot;, a clan of frost giants led by Gerti Orelsdottr allied with the orc King Obould Many-Arrows to send a massive army against the towns of the North. On the sidelines, four drow from the Underdark orchestrate events behind the scenes, playing each side against the other for their own advantage. Drizzt is separated from his friends during the siege at the town of Shallows. He witnesses the apparent death of the other Companions of the Hall, and turns his attention to slaughtering all of the orcs he can find, whilst reverting again to the Hunter. The other companions meet warrior dwarves of Mirabar who left because of their leader Marchion Elastuls dislike and borderline hatred for the dwarves of Mithral Hall.

==Publication history==
The first printing of &quot;The Thousand Orcs&quot; was 200,000 copies.

==Reception==
&quot;The Thousand Orcs&quot; debuted on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list at number 11. Reviews were generally positive. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described it as a &quot;rousing tale of derring-do and harrowing escapes&quot;, although in doing so they acknowledged that it was a &quot;light-hearted sword and sorcery novel&quot;, which gained some depth through Drizzt&#x27;s philosophical ponderings about human frailties. Similarly, Paul Brink, writing for the &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, acknowledged the author&#x27;s use of Drizzt to &quot;reflect on issues of racial prejudice&quot;.

Fred Phillips of &quot;The News-Star&quot; (Monroe, Louisiana) commented that &quot;The Thousand Orcs&quot; &quot;shows Salvatore fully recovered from the lull his &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; books went through in the mid- to late 1990s. The book kicks off the &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Blades&quot; trilogy which promised to revitalize characters that are in need of some change.&quot;

James Voelpel from mania.com commented on &quot;The Thousand Orcs&quot;, calling it &quot;a welcome return to the beginnings of Salvatore&#x27;s fantasy writing, though it seems to be lacking in some respects. All the characters that fans have been clamoring for are here but the sheer number of secondary stories and characters sometimes drowns them out. Even the would be love affair between Catti-brie and Drizzt seems underdone and somewhat glossed over. Characters such as Bruenor, Wulfgar and Regis are almost afterthoughts with some development to their personalities seemingly tacked on. The plot itself is rock solid and the story points with Obould and Gerti&#x27;s alliance as well as the rift between the dwarves and humans in Mirabar are really well done. Salvatore is always noted for his ability to write action that you can picture and he doesn&#x27;t disappoint here. The battles are stupendously done and vividly portray a comic book feel to them. For then fans of Salvatore this is a welcome edition to the Drizzt legacy, albeit lacking a bit, soon enough it will rocket up the bestseller list and have its following clamoring for the follow ups.&quot;

<text>Bristol Siddeley Engines Ltd (BSEL) was a British aero engine manufacturer. The company was formed in 1959 by a merger of Bristol Aero-Engines Limited and Armstrong Siddeley Motors Limited. In 1961 the company was expanded by the purchase of the de Havilland Engine Company and the engine division of Blackburn Aircraft. Bristol Siddeley was purchased by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1966.

==History==
Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited was formed by the 1 April 1959 merge of Bristol Aero-Engines and Armstrong Siddeley Motors. These were the aero engine manufacturing companies of the Bristol Aeroplane Company and the Hawker Siddeley Group. The share capital of Bristol Siddeley was held in equal proportions by these two parent organisations. At around the same time Bristol&#x27;s aircraft manufacturing was being subsumed into the British Aircraft Corporation along with those of English Electric and Vickers-Armstrong.

Armstrong Siddeley Motors had been producing aero-engines and motor-cars since it had been formed in 1919 with the merger of Siddeley-Deasy and the Armstrong Whitworth Company. Bristol Aero-Engines had been formed in 1920 when the Bristol Aeroplane Company had taken over the assets of the Cosmos Engineering Company.

On 6 May 1958 Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited was formed as a pilot company to bring about an alliance between the Bristol and Coventry concerns, and a full merger took effect from the beginning of April 1959. The purpose of the new company was to combine the research, engineering and manufacturing resources of the two great component companies to meet the changing demands of the aviation industry.

The company was further strengthened in November 1961 when it acquired the full share capital of the de Havilland Engine Company Limited and Blackburn Engines Limited, both of which were formerly operating within the Hawker Siddeley Group. The aircraft side of Blackburn became part of Hawker Siddeley. Both of these companies had long histories in the aero-engine industry.

The de Havilland Engine Company Limited had the de Havilland Sprite which was a rocket engine with a military type test certificate. In 1954, the company had produced the axial turbojet Gyron of thrust, from which was descended the Gyron Junior series. The de Havilland Engine Company&#x27;s portfolio included the (licensed) Gnome turboshaft.
The Blackburn Aeroplane and Motor Company had entered the aero engine field in 1934 when the Cirrus-Hermes Engineering Company became part of the Blackburn and this became the Engine Division of Blackburn Aircraft and subsequently Blackburn Engines Limited. In 1952 an agreement was signed which enabled Blackburn Engines Limited to produce engines based on the Turbomeca range of small gas turbine engines. These were developed for use as airborne auxiliary power units for large aircraft and they were also used as a ground starter unit in the British services.

Bristol Siddeley was bought by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1966 for £63.6 million in order to prevent competition from a planned collaboration between BSEL, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Snecma. Bristol Siddeley retained its own identity and marketing organization.

Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited is still a listed but dormant company within the Rolls-Royce group.

==Products==
The company was one of the largest of its kind in the world and offered a wider range of engines than any other manufacturer. Aero engines produced by the company included piston engines, turboprops, turboshafts, turbojets, turbofans, auxiliary power units, ramjets and liquid propellant rocket engines. Outside the aeronautical field its products were gas turbines for marine and industrial use, diesel engines, and automatic transmissions.

===Aero engines===
The Patchway factory in South Gloucestershire produced military aeroplane engines including the Olympus two-spool turbojet (from which the engine for Concorde was developed), the Orpheus turbojet for the Folland Gnat light fighter/trainer aircraft, the Pegasus two shaft medium bypass ratio vectored thrust turbofan for the Hawker Siddeley P.1127/Kestrel/Harrier VSTOL ground attack aircraft, the Proteus turboprop for the Bristol Britannia airliner and the Viper turbojet for the Hawker Siddeley HS.125. Bristol Siddeley had under development another vectored thrust turbofan, the &quot;plenum chamber burner&quot; (similar to an afterburner) equipped BS100, which was intended for the supersonic Hawker Siddeley P.1154 VSTOL fighter, but the project was cancelled in 1965. The two shaft BS143 was proposed for the MRCA (later the Tornado), but the takeover by RR caused the adoption of the three shaft RB199 instead. Hypersonics were explored in a shock tube near the High Altitude Test Plant (HATP) at Bristol, in support of BS1012 hypersonic engine thinking. High supersonic ramjets for long range defensive missiles were tested in the HATP (Ref TJ102 and TJ151/2).

===Diesel engines===
Bristol Siddeley also manufactured diesel engines under licence from the German company Maybach. These were for installation in British Rail Class 42 and Class 52 locomotives which were themselves based on licensed German designs but with as much British-built content as possible. The Maybach Diesel (MD) MD650, MD655 and MD870 series engines built by Bristol Siddeley were sophisticated in design, running at much higher speeds than normal diesels of their size and featured advanced construction such as a disc-webbed crankshaft that ran in large roller bearings, telescopic pipes to deliver cooling oil to the pistons and detachable piston crowns.
The MD engines produced by BSEL included 16 basic engines in the range, which covered powers from 380 to 3,000 horsepower, and includes 4- and 6-cylinder in-line units, and 8, 12 and 16 V units. Each of these were pressure-charged, with or without intercooling. They were used with hydraulic transmission systems, in the Type 4 locos (with two MD650 engines of 1,152 bhp each) hauled the express trains of the Western Region of British Railways - e.g. the Bristolian and the Cornish Riviera. Several hundred more orders were placed by British Rail.(Ref TJ102). MD series engines were widely used in base load, intermittent and standby electricity generating sets, and were transported by rail up to the nominal 1200 kW size for a complete generator set. They were also employed in oil rigs and pumping sets.(Ref TJ151/2).
===Motor cars===
When the company was formed it also included the motor car companies Armstrong Siddeley Motors and Bristol Cars. It was soon decided to stop production of Armstrong Siddeley cars, as it was becoming uneconomic, with production of the only product, the Star Sapphire, ending in July 1960. In September 1960 Bristol Cars was sold. Subcontracted production of the Sunbeam Alpine sports car continued at Bristol Siddeley Engines in Coventry until 1962.

<doc id="1209604" wikidata="Q833555" url="?curid=1209604" title="Rhodes International Airport">
<text>Rhodes International Airport &quot;Diagoras&quot; (Greek: Διεθνής Αερολιμένας Ρόδου &quot;Διαγόρας&quot;), or [[Diagoras of Rhodes|Diagoras]] International Airport , is located on the West side of the island of Rhodes in Greece. The facility is located just north of the village Paradeisi, about 14 km southwest of the capital city, Rhodes. Rhodes International Airport was the fourth busiest airport in Greece as of 2019, with 5,542,567 passengers utilizing the airport.

== History ==

Civil aviation on Rhodes started after the Second World War, on the location of the nearby military Rhodes Maritsa Airport.

This was the island&#x27;s main airport until 1977, when the new Rhodes International Airport was opened. A new facility was needed, as the &quot;old&quot; Maritsa airport did not meet the needs for a modern civil airport. The new &quot;Diagoras&quot; airport was built in 1977. It was determined that, in this location, it would meet the needs of the island better.

Improvements have been made to the airport, like expansion of taxiways, platform and airport buildings. The most recent upgrade is a new passenger terminal, opened in 2005, to accommodate the growing number of charter flights and passengers. The airport&#x27;s plants currently cover a total area of 60,000 m2

On 21 September 2015, Rhodes Airport was closed for 14 hours after a &#x27;sinkhole&#x27; appeared in the runway. Flights were diverted to surrounding airports such as Kos and Heraklion as well as Athens and the runway was fixed and reopened the following day.

In December 2015, the privatisation of Rhodes International Airport and 13 other regional airports of Greece was finalised with the signing of the agreement between the Fraport AG/Copelouzos Group joint venture and the state privatisation fund. &quot;We signed the deal today,&quot; the head of Greece&#x27;s privatisation agency HRADF, Stergios Pitsiorlas, told Reuters. According to the agreement, the joint venture will operate the 14 airports (including Rhodes International Airport) for 40 years as of autumn 2016.

==Facilities==

===Terminal===
Rhodes Airport terminal is actually two separate buildings with a joined corridor in the middle. Departures are served both in ground (check-ins, baggage checks) and first floor (passenger screening, gates, shops) while arrivals are served only in ground floor&#x27;s southern corner where passport control, customs and baggage reclaim operate. Airport does not have air bridges so boarding and disembarking require the use of buses.

Both terminals are and will be under renovations for the next couple of years from Fraport, as a series of chronic problems need to be addressed. Toilets and air conditioning system were first to be fixed while more complicated works including new check in facilities that will eliminate double checks for baggage as well interior remodeling will proceed gradually during low traffic winter months.

The airport also has a police station, a medical clinic, airline and handlers&#x27; offices, rent-a-car and tour operators&#x27; kiosks, VIP halls, recently refurbished duty-free shops, cafes and restaurants.

===Runway===
The airport&#x27;s single runway direction is 065/245 degrees (designated as 06/24), having a length of 3,305 meters and a width of 60 meters. There are two taxiways and four taxi links connecting the runway with the apron. The apron with the new pushback configuration can accommodate up to 20 ICAO reference category C or smaller airplanes, simultaneously. Three parking positions have MARS (Multiple Apron Ramp System) capability and can accommodate larger category D and E aircraft, such as the Airbus A330, A340 and A350 and the Boeing 747, 757, 767, 777 and 787. There is a small general aviation apron with three dedicated positions for small propelled or jet aircraft.

== Future of the airport - Fraport Greece&#x27;s investment plan ==

On 22 March 2017, the Fraport-Greece presented its master plan for the 14 regional airports including the International Airport of Rhodes.

The following summarizes the enhancement changes that started in November 2017 and will be implemented for Rhodes International Airport under Fraport Greece&#x27;s investment plan:
Immediate actions that were implemented at the airports as soon as Fraport Greece took over operations and before the launch of the 2017 Summer season included:
*General clean-up
*Improving lighting, marking of airside areas.
*Upgrading sanitary facilities
*Enhancing services and offering new free Internet connection (WiFi)
*Implementing works to improve fire safety in all the areas of the airports
*Remodeling the current terminal 
*Reorganizing the airport apron area
*New fire station
*13 percent increase in the number of check-in counters (from 40 to 45)
*13 percent increase in the number of departure gates (from 16 to 18)
*71 percent in the number of security-check lanes (from 7 to 12)
*25 percent increase in the number of baggage reclaim belts (from 4 to 5)

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Rhodes Airport:

==Traffic figures==

Figures are taken from the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) until 2016 and since 2017 from the official website of the airport.

She was retired and sold in 1773 when unrest in Britain&#x27;s American colonies required larger, better armed patrol craft.

==Career==
&quot;Sultana&quot; was built in the yard of renowned Boston Shipwright Benjamin Hallowell in 1767, probably as a yacht. She made one voyage from Boston to England.

The Royal Navy purchased her for £292 9s 0d from Sir Thomas Hesketh on 18 March 1768. She underwent fitting by John Randall, of Rotherhithe between 19 March and 25 August. At the time of purchase, her lines were taken off and a draught of the hull filed at the Admiralty. She was one of six Marblehead schooners that the Royal Navy bought.

The navy named her HMS &quot;Sultana&quot; and commissioned her in July under the command of Lt John Inglis, who would end his service to the crown as Vice Admiral of the Blue. &quot;Sultana&#x27;s&quot; logbook began on 15 July 1768.

&quot;Sultana&quot; left Dungeness on the morning of 27 August 1768. Her assignment was to enforce the Townshend Acts (and to enforce tea taxes) by stopping smugglers. The schooner’s master was David Bruce.

&quot;Sultana&#x27;s&quot; first assignment once she reached Halifax was to proceed to Boston to help land General Gage’s troops in Boston for the protection of customs officials. Following that, she sailed up and down the coast of the Colonies, visiting Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia and many spots in the lower Chesapeake tidewater region. On 10 October 1772 &quot;Sultana&quot; set off to England.

==Fate==
&quot;Sultana&quot; was paid off in December. She was sold at auction in Portsmouth on 11 August 1773 to John Hook Jr. for £85.

==Modern replicas==

A new &quot;Sultana&quot;, launched in Chestertown, Maryland, in 2001, serves as an educational vessel for schoolchildren as it travels around the Chesapeake Bay. Each year there are public excursions out of Chestertown and other ports. &quot;Downrigging Weekend&quot; in Chestertown is always the first weekend in November. Replica sailing ships from all around the mid-Atlantic participate in sailing excursions and allow the public on board.

The replica vessel is not an exact reconstruction. It has a diesel auxiliary engine and otherwise conforms to Coast Guard regulations in order to carry passengers. The modern version is framed with osage orange and planked with oak; there is a lead ballast keel which the original did not have. She has only four guns, rather than the original eight. All work and can be fired. Within modern safety requirements, however, she was built following traditional methods as much as possible.

The Howard I. Chapelle drawings of &quot;Sultana&quot;, traced from the Admiralty draughts, also inspired another modern vessel, the schooner &quot;Larinda&quot;. Her design is loosely based on &quot;Sultana&quot; but with a junk-rig and fantasy woodwork featuring whimsical details such as a frog for a figurehead.

<doc id="1209609" wikidata="Q754877" url="?curid=1209609" title="Love Me Do">
<text>&quot;Love Me Do&quot; is the debut single by the English rock band the Beatles, backed by &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;. When the single was originally released in the United Kingdom on 5 October 1962, it peaked at number 17. It was released in the United States in 1964 and topped the nation&#x27;s song chart. Re-released in 1982 as part of EMI&#x27;s Beatles 20th anniversary, it re-entered the UK charts and peaked at number 4. &quot;Love Me Do&quot; also topped the charts in Australia and New Zealand.

The song was written several years before being recorded, and prior to the existence of the Beatles. It features John Lennon&#x27;s prominent harmonica playing and duet vocals by him and Paul McCartney. Three recorded versions of the song by the Beatles have been released, each with a different drummer. The first attempted recording from June 1962 featured Pete Best on drums, but was not officially released until the &quot;Anthology 1&quot; compilation in 1995. A second version was recorded three months later with Best&#x27;s replacement Ringo Starr, and this was used for the original Parlophone single first pressing. A third version, featuring session drummer Andy White in place of Starr, was used for the second pressing and also included on the band&#x27;s &quot;Please Please Me&quot; album and on the 1964 Tollie single in the US. It was also included on the American LPs &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; and &quot;The Early Beatles&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Love Me Do&quot; was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, with McCartney writing the verse and chorus and Lennon contributing the middle eight (or &quot;bridge&quot;). Lennon said: &quot;&#x27;Love Me Do&#x27; is Paul&#x27;s song... I do know he had the song around, in Hamburg, even, way, way before we were songwriters.&quot;
McCartney said: 
Their practice at the time was to scribble songs in a school notebook, dreaming of stardom, always writing &quot;Another Lennon–McCartney Original&quot; at the top of the page. &quot;Love Me Do&quot; is a song based around three simple chords: G7 and C, before moving to D for its middle eight. It begins with Lennon playing a bluesy dry &quot;dockside harmonica&quot; riff, then features Lennon and McCartney on joint lead vocals, including Everly Brothers-style harmonising during the beseeching &quot;please&quot; before McCartney sings the unaccompanied vocal line on the song&#x27;s title phrase.

Lennon had previously sung the title sections, but this change in arrangement was made in the studio under the direction of producer George Martin when he realised that the harmonica part encroached on the vocal. Lennon needed to begin playing the harmonica again on the same beat as the &quot;do&quot; of &quot;love me do&quot;. However, when a similar situation later occurred on the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; single session the harmonica was superimposed afterwards using tape-to-tape overdubbing.

Described by Ian MacDonald as &quot;standing out like a bare brick wall in a suburban sitting-room, &#x27;Love Me Do&#x27;, [with its] blunt working class northerness, rang the first faint chime of a revolutionary bell&quot; compared to the standard Tin Pan Alley productions occupying the charts at the time.

==Recordings and releases==
&quot;Love Me Do&quot; was recorded by the Beatles on three occasions with three drummers at EMI Studios at 3 Abbey Road in London:
* The Beatles&#x27; first recording session, on 6 June 1962, with Pete Best on drums. This version (previously thought to be lost) is available on &quot;Anthology 1&quot;.
* Second recording session, 4 September 1962. In August, Best had been replaced with Ringo Starr, after producer George Martin did not approve of Best&#x27;s drumming for studio work. The Beatles with Starr recorded a version in 15 takes. This version with Starr is available on &quot;Past Masters&quot;, as well as on the 2023 expanded edition of the compilation album &quot;1962–1966&quot; and the flip side of the &quot;Now and Then&quot; single.
* Third recording session, 11 September 1962. A week later, The Beatles recorded &quot;Love Me Do&quot; with session drummer Andy White on drums. Starr was relegated to playing tambourine. As tambourine is not present on the 4 September recording, this is the easiest way to distinguish between the Starr and White recordings. The Andy White version is available on &quot;Please Please Me&quot;.

First issues of the single, released on Parlophone in the UK on 5 October 1962, featured the Ringo Starr version, prompting Mark Lewisohn to later write: &quot;Clearly, the 11 September version was not regarded as having been a significant improvement after all&quot;.

The Andy White version of the track was included on The Beatles&#x27; debut UK album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Hits EP&quot;, and subsequent album releases on which &quot;Love Me Do&quot; was included (except as noted below), as well as on the first US single release in April 1964. For the 1976 single re-issue and the 1982 &quot;20th Anniversary&quot; re-issue, as well as various compilation albums including the original release of &quot;1962–1966&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, the Andy White version was again used. The Ringo Starr version was included on the albums &quot;Rarities&quot; (US version), &quot;Past Masters&quot; and &quot;Mono Masters&quot;. It was also included on Record 1 of &quot;The Beatles Box&quot;. The CD single issued on 2 October 1992 contains both versions. The Pete Best version remained unreleased until 1995, when it was included on the &quot;Anthology 1&quot; album.

Capitol Records Canada pressed 170 singles which were released on 4 February 1963 with catalogue number 72076. This pressing was dubbed from the original UK single and featured Starr on drums.

&quot;Love Me Do&quot;, featuring Starr drumming, was also recorded eight times at the BBC and played on the BBC Radio programmes &quot;Here We Go&quot;, &quot;Talent Spot&quot;, &quot;Saturday Club&quot;, &quot;Side by Side&quot;, &quot;Pop Go the Beatles&quot; and &quot;Easy Beat&quot; between October 1962 and October 1963. The version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; recorded on 10 July 1963 at the BBC and broadcast on the 23 July 1963 &quot;Pop Go the Beatles&quot; programme can be heard on the group&#x27;s &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; compilation. The Beatles also performed the song live on the 20 February 1963 &quot;Parade of the Pops&quot; BBC Radio broadcast.

In 1969, during the &quot;Get Back sessions&quot;, The Beatles played the song in a slower, more bluesy form than they had in earlier recordings. This version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; is one of many recordings made during these sessions and subsequently appeared on some bootlegs. The song featured no harmonica by Lennon, and McCartney sang the majority of the song in the same vocal style he used for &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;.

In 1989, McCartney blended the two songs from the Beatles&#x27; first single into a medley called &quot;P.S. Love Me Do&quot; for some dates of his 1989/90 World Tour. A little-known studio version of the medley first became available on a &quot;Special Package&quot; (1990 Japanese tour edition) of his solo album &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot;. The song became more widely known when a live version was released as a bonus track on the 12-inch single and CD single of &quot;Birthday&quot; from the double live album &quot;Tripping the Live Fantastic&quot;. Music videos for both &quot;Birthday&quot; and &quot;P.S. Love Me Do&quot; were released.

The original 1962 single version of the song, with Ringo Starr on drums, received a new stereo mix by Giles Martin with the help of de-mixing technology developed by Peter Jackson&#x27;s WingNut Films and was released on 2 November 2023 as the flip side on the double A-side single of &quot;Now and Then&quot;, finally making number one in the UK. It was also included in the expanded edition of the &quot;1962–1966&quot; compilation released on 10 November 2023.

==Background==

===First recording session and use of harmonica===
The Beatles&#x27; first recording session under contract to EMI was on 6 June 1962. They first attempted &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, as well as three other songs, at this session. George Martin, originally absent from the session, arrived during the recording of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and altered the arrangement so that McCartney sang the words &quot;love me do&quot; instead of Lennon, enabling Lennon to play the harmonica starting on the word &quot;do&quot;. McCartney recalled:
George Martin said, &quot;Wait a minute, there&#x27;s a crossover there. Someone else has got to sing &#x27;love me do&#x27; because you&#x27;re going to have a song called Love Me &quot;Waahhh&quot;. So, Paul, will you sing &#x27;love me do&#x27;?&quot; God, I got the screaming heebie-jeebies. ... I can still hear the shake in my voice when I listen to it.

This version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; also featured a change in drum rhythm during the middle-eight, moving to a skip beat that Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn deemed &quot;disastrous&quot;. Both Martin and Ron Richards agreed that Pete Best&#x27;s drumming was unsuitable for future recording.

On 4 September 1962, Brian Epstein paid for the Beatles—along with their new drummer, Ringo Starr—to fly down from Liverpool to London for their next session. After first checking into their Chelsea hotel, they arrived at EMI Studios early in the afternoon where they set up their equipment in Studio 3 and began rehearsing six songs including: &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and a song originally composed for Adam Faith by Mitch Murray called &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot; which George Martin &quot;was insisting, in the apparent absence of any stronger original material, would be the group&#x27;s first single&quot;. Lennon and McCartney had yet to impress Martin with their songwriting ability, and the Beatles had been signed as recording artists on the basis of their charismatic appeal: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a question of what they could do [as] they hadn&#x27;t written anything great at that time.&quot; &quot;But what impressed me most was their personalities. Sparks flew off them when you talked to them.&quot; During the course of an evening session that then followed (7:00 pm to 10:00 pm in Studio 2) they recorded &quot;How Do You Do It&quot; and &quot;Love Me Do&quot;. An attempt at &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was made, but at this stage it was quite different from its eventual treatment and it was dropped by Martin. This was a disappointment for the group as they had hoped it would be the B-side to &quot;Love Me Do&quot;.

The Beatles were keen to record their own material, something which was almost unheard of at that time, and it is generally accepted that it is to Martin&#x27;s credit that they were allowed to float their own ideas. But Martin insisted that unless they could write something as commercial as &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot; then the Tin Pan Alley practice of having the group record songs by professional songwriters (which was standard procedure then, and is still common today) would be followed. MacDonald points out, however: &quot;It&#x27;s almost certainly true that there was no other producer on either side of the Atlantic then capable of handling the Beatles without damaging them—let alone of cultivating and catering to them with the gracious, open-minded adeptness for which George Martin is universally respected in the British pop industry.&quot; Martin rejects however the view that he was the &quot;genius&quot; behind the group: &quot;I was purely an interpreter. The genius was theirs: no doubt about that.&quot;

It was on the 4 September session that, according to McCartney, Martin suggested using a harmonica. However, Lennon&#x27;s harmonica part was present on the &quot;Anthology 1&quot; version of the song recorded during the 6 June audition with Pete Best on drums. Also, Martin&#x27;s own recollection of this is different, saying: &quot;I picked up on &#x27;Love Me Do&#x27; because of the harmonica sound&quot;, adding: &quot;I loved wailing harmonica—it reminded me of the records I used to issue of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. I felt it had a definite appeal.&quot;

Lennon had learned to play a chromatic harmonica that his uncle George (late husband of his Aunt Mimi) had given to him as a child. But the instrument being used at this time was one stolen by Lennon from a music shop in Arnhem, the Netherlands, in 1960, as the Beatles first journeyed to Hamburg by road. Lennon would have had this with him at the EMI audition on 6 June as Bruce Channel&#x27;s &quot;Hey! Baby&quot;, with its harmonica intro, and a hit in the UK in March 1962, was one of the thirty-three songs the Beatles had prepared (although only four were recorded: &quot;Bésame Mucho&quot;; &quot;Love Me Do&quot;; &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; and &quot;Ask Me Why&quot;, of which only &quot;Bésame Mucho&quot; and &quot;Love Me Do&quot; survive and appear on &quot;Anthology 1&quot;). Brian Epstein had also booked the American Bruce Channel to top a NEMS Enterprises promotion at New Brighton&#x27;s Tower Ballroom, in Wallasey on 21 June 1962, just a few weeks after &quot;Hey! Baby&quot; had charted, and placed the Beatles a prestigious second on the bill. Lennon was so impressed that night with Channel&#x27;s harmonica player, Delbert McClinton, that he later approached him for advice on how to play the instrument. Lennon makes reference also to Frank Ifield&#x27;s &quot;I Remember You&quot; and its harmonica intro, a huge number one hit in the UK July 1962, saying: &quot;The gimmick was the harmonica. There was a terrible thing called &quot;I Remember You&quot;, and we did those numbers; and we started using it on &quot;Love Me Do&quot; just for arrangements&quot;. The harmonica was to become a feature of the Beatles&#x27; early hits such as &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;From Me to You&quot; as well as various album tracks. Paul McCartney recalled, &quot;John expected to be in jail one day and he&#x27;d be the guy who played the harmonica.&quot;

Martin came very close to issuing &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot; as the Beatles&#x27; first single (it would also re-appear as a contender for their second single) before settling instead on &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, as a mastered version of it was made ready for release and which still exists in EMI&#x27;s archives. Martin commented later: &quot;I looked very hard at &#x27;How Do You Do It?&#x27;, but in the end I went with &#x27;Love Me Do&#x27;, it was quite a good record.&quot; McCartney would remark: &quot;We knew that the peer pressure back in Liverpool would not allow us to do &#x27;How Do You Do It&#x27;.&quot; Martin nearly issued the record, but was stymied by pressure from EMI&#x27;s publishing arm, Ardmore &amp; Beechwood, who requested that a Lennon–McCartney song be the Beatles&#x27; first A-side single. Additionally, &quot;How Do You Do It&quot; songwriter Mitch Murray disliked the Beatles&#x27; version of the song.

===Remake and Andy White===
Martin then decided that as &quot;Love Me Do&quot; was going to be the group&#x27;s debut release it needed to be re-recorded with a different drummer as he was unhappy with the 4 September drum sound (Abbey Road&#x27;s Ken Townsend also recalls McCartney being dissatisfied with Starr&#x27;s timing, due probably to his being under-rehearsed; Starr had joined the group only two weeks before the 4 September session). Record producers at that time were used to hearing the bass drum &quot;lock in&quot; with the bass guitar as opposed to the much looser R&amp;B feel that was just beginning to emerge, and so professional show band drummers were often used for recordings.

Ron Richards, placed in charge of the 11 September re-recording session in George Martin&#x27;s absence, booked Andy White whom he had used in the past. Starr was expecting to play, and was very disappointed to be dropped for only his second Beatles recording session: Richards remembers &quot;He just sat there quietly in the control box next to me. Then I asked him to play maracas on &#x27;P.S. I Love You&#x27;. Ringo is lovely—always easy going&quot;. Starr recalled:
Paul McCartney: &quot;George got his way and Ringo didn&#x27;t drum on the first single. He only played tambourine. I don&#x27;t think Ringo ever got over that. He had to go back up to Liverpool and everyone asked, &#x27;How did it go in the Smoke?&#x27; We&#x27;d say, &#x27;B-side&#x27;s good,&#x27; but Ringo couldn&#x27;t admit to liking the A-side, not being on it&quot; (from &quot;Anthology&quot;). &quot;Love Me Do&quot; was recorded with White playing drums and Starr on tambourine, but whether using a session drummer solved the problem is unclear, as session engineer Norman Smith was to comment: &quot;It was a real headache trying to get a [good] drum sound, and when you listen to the record now you can hardly hear the drums at all.&quot; Ringo Starr&#x27;s version was mixed &quot;bottom-light&quot; to hide Starr&#x27;s bass drum.

Early pressings of the single (issued with a red Parlophone label) are the 4 September version—minus tambourine—with Starr playing drums. But later pressings of the single (on a black Parlophone label), and the version used for the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; album, are the 11 September re-record with Andy White on drums and Starr on tambourine. This difference has become fundamental in telling the two recordings of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; apart. Regarding the editing sessions that then followed all these various takes, Ron Richards remembers the whole thing being a bit fraught, saying: &quot;Quite honestly, by the time it came out I was pretty sick of it. I didn&#x27;t think it would do anything.&quot;

===Ron Richards===
There are major discrepancies regarding the White session, and who produced it. In his book &quot;Summer of Love&quot;, Martin concedes that his version of events differs from some accounts, saying: &quot;On the 6 June Beatles session (audition) I decided that Pete Best had to go [and said to Epstein] I don&#x27;t care what you do with Pete Best; but he&#x27;s not playing on any more recording sessions: I&#x27;m getting a session drummer in.&quot; When Starr turned up with the group for their first proper recording session on 4 September, Martin says that he was totally unaware that the Beatles had fired Best; and, not knowing &quot;how good, bad or indifferent&quot; Starr was, was not prepared to &quot;waste precious studio time finding out.&quot; Martin, therefore, appears to have this as the Andy White session in which Martin was present, and not 11 September. This contradicts Mark Lewisohn&#x27;s account, as in his book &quot;The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions&quot;, he has Starr on drums on 4 September and White for the 11 September re-make. Lewisohn also says that Richards was in charge on 11 September, which means, if accurate, that Richards was sole producer of the White version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot;. Martin says, &quot;My diary shows that I did not oversee any Beatles recording sessions on 11 September—only the one on 4 September.&quot; But, if Lewisohn&#x27;s account is correct and &quot;the 4 September session really hadn&#x27;t proved good enough to satisfy George Martin&quot;, it might seem odd that Martin was not then present to oversee the 11 September remake.

In his memoirs, assistant engineer Geoff Emerick supports the Lewisohn version, recounting that Starr played drums at the 4 September session (Emerick&#x27;s second day at EMI) and that Martin, Smith, and McCartney were all dissatisfied with (the underrehearsed) Starr&#x27;s timekeeping. Emerick places White firmly at the second session, and describes the reactions of Mal Evans and Starr to the substitution. Emerick also noted that Martin only came in very late for the 11 September session, after work on &quot;Love Me Do&quot; was complete.

Andy White confirms that he was booked by Ron Richards for the 11 September session, not by George Martin, who he says &quot;could not make the session, could not get there till the end, so he had Ron Richards handle it&quot;. White also says that he recognises his own drumming on the released version of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, recorded that same session with him on drums.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Love Me Do&quot; was released on 5 October 1962, and reached no. 17 in the UK charts in November, to the surprise of Martin, who doubted the song&#x27;s commercial appeal. After the Beatles became famous, it was released in other countries. In Australia, it was released in 1964, and reached no. 1 on 14 February that year. It reached no. 1 in New Zealand on 4 June 1964. At first, US copies of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; were imported from Canada, which included Starr on drums. On 27 April 1964, Vee-Jay Records released the single on the Tollie label with White on drums.

The song was the fourth of six songs by the Beatles to hit the US number one spot in a one-year period; an all-time record for the US charts. In order, these were &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, and &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;. It was also the fourth of seven songs written by Lennon–McCartney to hit number one in 1964 (the other being &quot;A World Without Love&quot;, recorded by Peter and Gordon). That remains an all-time record on the US charts for writing the most songs to hit number one in the same calendar year.

==50th anniversary mix-up and release==
EMI released a 50th anniversary limited-edition replica of the original single, featuring &quot;Love Me Do&quot; backed with &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, in October 2012. The 7-inch disc was originally scheduled to hit stores on 5 October but was recalled when it was discovered that the pressings contained the Andy White version instead of the Ringo Starr version as intended. The White version was recalled, and the correct version with Ringo Starr on drums was issued on 22 October 2012.

<text>Mary Louise Weiss (December 28, 1948 – January 19, 2024) was an American singer and interior designer, best known as the lead singer of the Shangri-Las in the 1960s. Their single &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1964. She had little involvement in the music scene for decades, returning in 2007 to record her first and only solo album with Norton Records.

==Early life==
Mary Louise Weiss was born on December 28, 1948, in Cambria Heights, Queens, in New York City. She had an older sister, Betty, and an older brother, George. Her family was Jewish. Her father, Harry Weiss, died when she was six weeks old and her mother, Elizabeth ( Treubig), brought up three children in poverty, surviving on welfare and handouts. Mary sang in school plays and choirs and she listened to her brother, an Elvis fan, and his friends performing popular songs of the day. She attended her first Everly Brothers concert in 1963 at Freedomland U.S.A. at age 14.

==Career==
===The Shangri-Las===
In high school, Weiss and her sister Betty became friends with twins Mary Ann and Margie Ganser. In 1963 the four girls formed a group, taking their name from a neighbourhood restaurant, and they sang at local dances and hops.
 They came to the attention of local producer Artie Ripp, who signed them to Kama Sutra Productions. Their first single, 1963&#x27;s &quot;Simon Says&quot;, was a flop.
 After recording demos, signing with Red Bird Records in 1964 and making it to the Brill Building, where they worked with hit-writing team Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, they recorded &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot;, their first hit; and &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;, both co-written and produced by Shadow Morton. &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts in 1964. &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot; had reached number five in the US charts, competing with six singles by the Beatles and hits by the Rolling Stones and other British groups. Weiss and the Shangri-Las played support at concerts by the Beatles and the Stones.

The Shangri-Las became a leading girl group in the 1960s. After several years together, they split in 1968 and Weiss went to San Francisco to try a different lifestyle. She gave up singing, married Ed Ryan, and went to work for an architectural firm. She later became a commercial interior designer in New York. She later occasionally performed shows with the Shangri-Las during the 1970s, which led to an unsuccessful attempt to re-form the band with Sire Records in 1976. In 1989, the Shangri-Las reunited for a Cousin Brucie show at The Meadowlands in New Jersey.
In 2019, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, honored the Shangri-Las song &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; in its Singles category.

===Solo album===
In 2005, Weiss left her job in commercial interiors to return to music. She was persuaded to record a solo album, &quot;Dangerous Game&quot;, in 2007, despite having not sung in almost 20 years. She recalled that she did not even sing along to the car radio. In March 2007, Norton Records released &quot;Dangerous Game&quot;, a critically acclaimed album on which she was backed by the Reigning Sound.

==Personal life and death==
After the Shangri-Las, Weiss took a job as a purchasing agent in New York City in Manhattan. She recalled in a 2007 interview, &quot;I went to work for an architectural firm, and I was seriously into it. Then I got into commercial interiors, huge projects, buildings.&quot; She later became the chief purchasing agent and ran the commercial furniture dealership. In the late 1980s, she managed a furniture store and was an interior designer. By 2001, she was a furniture consultant to New York businesses.

Weiss died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at her home in Palm Springs, California, on January 19, 2024, at the age of 75 leaving her sister Betty as the only living member of The Shangri-Las. Weiss is survived by her third husband, Ed Ryan.

<text>The Lone Drow is a 2003 Forgotten Realms novel and the second book in R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s book series, &quot;The Hunter&#x27;s Blades Trilogy&quot;. In this novel, Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden is mourning what he believes is the death of his closest friends. He is helped to regain his sense of purpose after two elves and their pegasus decide to help. He goes around killing orcs and preventing new clans from joining the army that has been gathering. While this happens, Drizzt&#x27;s friends are fighting desperately against the horde.

==Plot summary==
In &quot;The Lone Drow&quot;, Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden is mourning what he believes to be the death of his closest friends. Drizzt only regains his sense of purpose after two elves (Tarathiel and Innovindil) and their two pegasi (Sunrise and Sunset) decide to help. The dwarven druid Pikel Bouldershoulders loses his left arm at the elbow by a piece of slate thrown by a frost giant. Tarathiel, however, meets his demise at the hands of King Obould Many-Arrows. Later the orc shaman Arganth Snarrl proclaims Obould a god. Meanwhile, the remaining Companions of the Hall, who survived the attack that Drizzt earlier witnessed, are fighting an increasingly desperate battle against Obould&#x27;s forces.

==Reception==
&quot;The Lone Drow&quot; debuted on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list at number 7. Staff Reviewer Tom Gafkjen from d20zines.com awarded the book a &quot;B&quot; grade. He praised the well-written combat sequences (a point that was also acknowledged by Jackie Cassada when she commented on the first novel in the series) but he did not enjoy the repetitious writing about the character Drizzt brooding over the death of a moon elf. He noted the exceptional writing although preferring the first book of the trilogy. A similarly mixed review came from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; – while mostly negative, the reviewers acknowledged that the novel did (occasionally) rise above the cliché, and that &quot;a few characters do achieve some complexity&quot;. Cassada, on the other hand, seemed taken by the second novel in the trilogy, praising the &quot;tense battles, vivid landscapes and memorable characters&quot;. &quot;The Lone Drow&quot; debuted at #7 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in October 2003. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; felt that &quot;The Lone Drow&quot; was clichéd, but that some of the characters did achieve &quot;some complexity&quot;. They singled out two characters for praise: Innovindel, an elf who talks &quot;pensively&quot; of her long life in contrast to the short lived humans, and Obould the orc king.

<text>Eilidh Martina Cole is a British crime writer. she has released twenty-six novels about crime, most of which examine London&#x27;s gangster underworld. Four of her novels, &quot;Dangerous Lady&quot;, &quot;The Jump&quot;, &quot;The Take&quot; and &quot;The Runaway&quot; have been adapted into high-rating television dramas. She has achieved sales of over fourteen million in the UK alone and her tenth novel, &quot;The Know&quot;, spent seven weeks on &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; hardback best-sellers list.

==Early life==
Eilidh Martina Cole was born 30 March 1959, in Essex, England, to Irish Catholic parents, and was the youngest of five children. Her mother was a psychiatric nurse from Glasnevin, County Dublin and her father was a merchant seaman from Cork City. Her cousin is the Cork politician Denis Cregan. She was expelled from her convent school aged 15 after allegedly being caught reading a Harold Robbins novel.

She married for the first time aged 16, but the marriage only lasted a year. She had her first child at the age of 18. Her parents both died when she was in her early 20s.

Prior to her literary success, Cole had a variety of low-paid jobs, including working as a cleaner, a wine waitress, an agency nurse and a supermarket shelf-stacker.

==Career==
===Writing===
Cole&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1991, when her manuscript for &quot;Dangerous Lady&quot; was accepted by the literary agent Darley Anderson and sold for a record £150,000. The book was published by Headline the following year.

Most of her novels feature a female protagonist or antihero, and some take place within the Irish community in and around London.

In December 2011, readers using &quot;madaboutbooks.co.uk&quot; voted their favourite Martina Cole book. &quot;The Take&quot; won by 780 votes and was put at the top of the list of Martina Cole novels. &quot;Goodnight Lady&quot; came second, followed in third by &quot;Maura&#x27;s Game&quot;.

Cole received the Cartier Diamond Dagger from the Crime Writers&#x27; Association in 2021.

===Television===
A four-part TV adaptation of &quot;Dangerous Lady&quot; was broadcast on ITV in 1995, and in 1998 ITV broadcast a four-part adaptation of &quot;The Jump&quot;. &quot;The Take&quot; was serialised on British television on Sky1 in June 2009, which starred Tom Hardy as Freddie. Sky1 has also commissioned an adaptation of &quot;The Graft&quot;, which has yet to go into production.

In March 2011 &quot;The Runaway&quot;, was shown on Sky1 and Sky1 HD. It is based on Cole&#x27;s 1997 novel of the same name.

In 2008 Martina Cole presented a drama documentary series on ITV3 called &quot;Martina Cole&#x27;s Lady Killers&quot;, which told the story of six of history&#x27;s most notorious female serial killers, including Myra Hindley, Beverly Allitt and Rose West. Cole explored the reasons why women kill, and why society is surprised when they do. Each programme told the story of an individual killer with expert analysis and dramatic reconstruction. The programme proved to be a ratings hit for ITV3 and transferred to ITV1 in 2009.
Cole filmed an investigative documentary, &quot;Martina Cole Girl Gangs: Los Angeles&quot; for Sky1 in 2009. This focused on the role of girls in these gangs, which have been responsible for crimes ranging from drug dealing and car theft to robbery and murder.

In 2014 she appeared in a documentary about Holloway Prison, called &quot;Inside Holloway&quot;.

Additionally, she has appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot;, &quot;The Crime Thriller Club&quot;, &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; for Channel 5, ITV&#x27;s popular daytime show &quot;Loose Women&quot;, &quot;The One Show&quot; and two episodes of &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; for BBC One, and a 2004 edition of &quot;The Culture Show&quot;.

Along with TV executive producer, Barry Ryan, Cole co-owns the film and television production company &quot;2 Queens&quot;.

===Theatre===
Three of Cole&#x27;s novels have been adapted for the stage by the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, London: &quot;Two Women&quot; in 2010; &quot;The Graft&quot; in 2011, and Cole&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Dangerous Lady&quot; in 2012.

===Other interests===
In 2011 Cole founded her own record label, Hostage Music. The London-based band Alabama3 has signed up to the label.

==Personal life==
Cole lives in a Grade II listed, 15th-century manor house near Sevenoaks, Kent. She also has a house in northern Cyprus.

She remarried in the 1990s, but the marriage ended in divorce. She had her second child when she was 39.

Cole regularly holds creative writing classes in UK prisons. She is a patron of the single-parent charity Gingerbread, and also a patron of Women&#x27;s Aid.

Since her 20s she has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis after breaking both arms as a child. The arthritis has worsened over time, and now makes it painful for her when writing.

<doc id="1209622" wikidata="Q1761786" url="?curid=1209622" title="Microfossil">
<text>A microfossil is a fossil that is generally between 0.001 mm and 1 mm in size, the visual study of which requires the use of light or electron microscopy. A fossil which can be studied with the naked eye or low-powered magnification, such as a hand lens, is referred to as a macrofossil.

Microfossils are a common feature of the geological record, from the Precambrian to the Holocene. They are most common in deposits of marine environments, but also occur in brackish water, fresh water and terrestrial sedimentary deposits. While every kingdom of life is represented in the microfossil record, the most abundant forms are protist skeletons or microbial cysts from the Chrysophyta, Pyrrhophyta, Sarcodina, acritarchs and chitinozoans, together with pollen and spores from the vascular plants.

==Overview==
A microfossil is a descriptive term applied to fossilized plants and animals whose size is just at or below the level at which the fossil can be analyzed by the naked eye. A commonly applied cutoff point between &quot;micro&quot; and &quot;macro&quot; fossils is 1 mm. Microfossils may either be complete (or near-complete) organisms in themselves (such as the marine plankters foraminifera and coccolithophores) or component parts (such as small teeth or spores) of larger animals or plants. Microfossils are of critical importance as a reservoir of paleoclimate information, and are also commonly used by biostratigraphers to assist in the correlation of rock units.

Microfossils are found in rocks and sediments as the microscopic remains of what were once life forms such as plants, animals, fungus, protists, bacteria and archaea. Terrestrial microfossils include pollen and spores. Marine microfossils found in marine sediments are the most common microfossils. Everywhere in the oceans, microscopic protist organisms multiply prolifically, and many grow tiny skeletons which readily fossilise. These include foraminifera, dinoflagellates and radiolarians. Palaeontologists (geologists who study fossils) are interested in these microfossils because they can use them to determine how environments and climates have changed in the past, and where oil and gas can be found today.

Some microfossils are formed by colonial organisms such as Bryozoa (especially the Cheilostomata), which have relatively large colonies but are classified by fine skeletal details of the small individuals of the colony. As another example, many fossil genera of Foraminifera, which are protists are known from shells (called tests) that were as big as coins, such as the genus &quot;Nummulites&quot;.

In 2017, fossilized microorganisms, or microfossils, were discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec, Canada that may be as old as 4.28 billion years old, the oldest record of life on Earth, suggesting &quot;an almost instantaneous emergence of life&quot; (in a geological time-scale), after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. Nonetheless, life may have started even earlier, at nearly 4.5 billion years ago, as claimed by some researchers.

==Index fossils==
Index fossils, also known as guide fossils, indicator fossils or dating fossils, are the fossilized remains or traces of particular plants or animals that are characteristic of a particular span of geologic time or environment, and can be used to identify and date the containing rocks. To be practical, index fossils must have a limited vertical time range, wide geographic distribution, and rapid evolutionary trends. Rock formations separated by great distances but containing the same index fossil species are thereby known to have both formed during the limited time that the species lived.

Index fossils were originally used to define and identify geologic units, then became a basis for defining geologic periods, and then for faunal stages and zones.

Species of microfossils such as acritarchs, chitinozoans, conodonts, dinoflagellate cysts, ostracods, pollen, spores and foraminiferans are amongst the many species have been identified as index fossils that are widely used in biostratigraphy. Different fossils work well for sediments of different ages. To work well, the fossils used must be widespread geographically, so that they can be found in many different places. They must also be short lived as a species, so that the period of time during which they could be incorporated in the sediment is relatively narrow. The longer lived the species, the poorer the stratigraphic precision, so fossils that evolve rapidly.

Often biostratigraphic correlations are based on a faunal assemblage, rather than an individual species — this allows greater precision as the time span in which all of the species in the assemblage existed together is narrower than the time spans of any of the members. Further, if only one species is present in a sample, it can mean either that (1) the strata were formed in the known fossil range of that organism; or (2) that the fossil range of the organism was incompletely known, and the strata extend the known fossil range. If the fossil is easy to preserve and easy to identify, more precise time estimating of the stratigraphic layers is possible.

==Composition==
Microfossils can be classified by their composition as: (a) siliceous, as in diatoms and radiolaria, (b) calcareous, as in coccoliths and foraminifera, (c) phosphatic, as in the study of some vertebrates, or (d) organic, as in the pollen and spores studied in palynology. This division focuses on differences in the mineralogical and chemical composition of microfossil remains rather than on taxonomic or ecological distinctions.

* Siliceous microfossils: Siliceous microfossils include diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, ebridians, phytoliths, some scolecodonts (worm jaws), and sponge spicules.
* Calcareous microfossils: Calcareous (CaCO3) microfossils include coccoliths, foraminifera, calcareous dinoflagellate cysts, and ostracods (seed shrimp).
* Phosphatic microfossils: Phosphatic microfossils include conodonts (tiny oral structures of an extinct chordate group), some scolecodonts (worm jaws), shark spines and teeth and other fish remains (collectively called ichthyoliths).
* Organic microfossils: The study of organic microfossils is called palynology. Organic microfossils include pollen, spores, chitinozoans (thought to be the egg cases of marine invertebrates), scolecodonts (worm jaws), acritarchs, dinoflagellate cysts, and fungal remains.

==Organic-walled==

===Palynomorphs===
===Pollen grain===

Pollen has an outer sheath, called a sporopollenin, which affords it some resistance to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects. It is produced in huge quantities. There is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains, often disassociated from their parent plant. The discipline of palynology is devoted to the study of pollen, which can be used both for biostratigraphy and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive — which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates. Also, pollen analysis has been widely used for reconstructing past changes in vegetation and their associated drivers.
Pollen is first found in the fossil record in the late Devonian period, but at that time it is indistinguishable from spores. It increases in abundance until the present day.

===Plant spores===
A spore is a unit of sexual or asexual reproduction that may be adapted for dispersal and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions. Spores form part of the life cycles of many plants, algae, fungi and protozoa. Bacterial spores are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions.

===Fungal spores===

===Chitinozoa===
Chitinozoa are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils produced by an as yet unknown organism.

Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant in almost all types of marine sediment across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.

Their bizarre form has made classification and ecological reconstruction difficult. Since their discovery in 1931, suggestions of protist, plant, and fungal affinities have all been entertained. The organisms have been better understood as improvements in microscopy facilitated the study of their fine structure, and it has been suggested that they represent either the eggs or juvenile stage of a marine animal. However, recent research has suggested that they represent the test of a group of protists with uncertain affinities.

The ecology of chitinozoa is also open to speculation; some may have floated in the water column, where others may have attached themselves to other organisms. Most species were particular about their living conditions, and tend to be most common in specific paleoenvironments. Their abundance also varied with the seasons.

===Acritarchs===
Acritarchs, Greek for &quot;confused origins&quot;, are organic-walled microfossils, known from about to the present. Acritarchs are not a specific biological taxon, but rather a group with uncertain or unknown affinities. Most commonly they are composed of thermally altered acid insoluble carbon compounds (kerogen). While the classification of acritarchs into form genera is entirely artificial, it is not without merit, as the form taxa show traits similar to those of genuine taxa — for example the &#x27;explosion&#x27; in the Cambrian and the mass extinction at the end of the Permian.

Acritarch diversity reflects major ecological events such as the appearance of predation and the Cambrian explosion. Precambrian marine diversity was dominated by acritarchs. They underwent a boom around , increasing in abundance, diversity, size, complexity of shape, and especially size and number of spines. Their increasingly spiny forms in the last 1 billion years may indicate an increased need for defence against predation.

Acritarchs may include the remains of a wide range of quite different kinds of organisms—ranging from the egg cases of small metazoans to resting cysts of many kinds of chlorophyta (green algae). It is likely that most acritarch species from the Paleozoic represent various stages of the life cycle of algae that were ancestral to the dinoflagellates. The nature of the organisms associated with older acritarchs is generally not well understood, though many are probably related to unicellular marine algae. In theory, when the biological source (taxon) of an acritarch does become known, that particular microfossil is removed from the acritarchs and classified with its proper group.

Acritarchs were most likely eukaryotes. While archaea, bacteria and cyanobacteria (prokaryotes) usually produce simple fossils of a very small size, eukaryotic unicellular fossils are usually larger and more complex, with external morphological projections and ornamentation such as spines and hairs that only eukaryotes can produce; as most acritarchs have external projections (e.g., hair, spines, thick cell membranes, etc.), they are predominantly eukaryotes, although simple eukaryote acritarchs also exist.

Acritarchs are found in sedimentary rocks from the present back into the Archean. They are typically isolated from siliciclastic sedimentary rocks using hydrofluoric acid but are occasionally extracted from carbonate-rich rocks. They are excellent candidates for index fossils used for dating rock formations in the Paleozoic Era and when other fossils are not available. Because most acritarchs are thought to be marine (pre-Triassic), they are also useful for palaeoenvironmental interpretation. The Archean and earliest Proterozoic microfossils termed &quot;acritarchs&quot; may actually be prokaryotes. The earliest eukaryotic acritarchs known (as of 2020) are from between 1950 and 2150 million years ago.

Recent application of atomic force microscopy, confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and other analytic techniques to the study of the ultrastructure, life history, and systematic affinities of mineralized, but originally organic-walled microfossils, have shown some acritarchs are fossilized microalgae. In the end, it may well be, as Moczydłowska et al. suggested in 2011, that many acritarchs will, in fact, turn out to be algae.

===Archean cells===
Cells can be preserved in the rock record because their cell walls are made of proteins which convert to the organic material kerogen as the cell breaks down after death. Kerogen is insoluble in mineral acids, bases, and organic solvents. Over time, it is mineralised into graphite or graphite-like carbon, or degrades into oil and gas hydrocarbons. There are three main types of cell morphologies. Though there is no established range of sizes for each type, spheroid microfossils can be as small as about 8 micrometres, filamentous microfossils have diameters typically less than 5 micrometres and have a length that can range from tens of micrometres to 100 micrometres, and spindle-like microfossils can be as long as 50 micrometres.

==Mineralised==
===Siliceous===
Siliceous ooze is a type of biogenic pelagic sediment located on the deep ocean floor. Siliceous oozes are the least common of the deep sea sediments, and make up approximately 15% of the ocean floor. Oozes are defined as sediments which contain at least 30% skeletal remains of pelagic microorganisms. Siliceous oozes are largely composed of the silica based skeletons of microscopic marine organisms such as diatoms and radiolarians. Other components of siliceous oozes near continental margins may include terrestrially derived silica particles and sponge spicules. Siliceous oozes are composed of skeletons made from opal silica Si(O2), as opposed to calcareous oozes, which are made from skeletons of calcium carbonate organisms (i.e. coccolithophores). Silica (Si) is a bioessential element and is efficiently recycled in the marine environment through the silica cycle. Distance from land masses, water depth and ocean fertility are all factors that affect the opal silica content in seawater and the presence of siliceous oozes.



Phytoliths (Greek for &quot;plant stones&quot;) are rigid, microscopic structures made of silica, found in some plant tissues and persisting after the decay of the plant. These plants take up silica from the soil, whereupon it is deposited within different intracellular and extracellular structures of the plant. Phytoliths come in varying shapes and sizes. The term &quot;phytolith&quot; is sometimes used to refer to all mineral secretions by plants, but more commonly refers to siliceous plant remains.

===Calcareous===
The term &quot;calcareous&quot; can be applied to a fossil, sediment, or sedimentary rock which is formed from, or contains a high proportion of, calcium carbonate in the form of calcite or aragonite. Calcareous sediments (limestone) are usually deposited in shallow water near land, since the carbonate is precipitated by marine organisms that need land-derived nutrients. Generally speaking, the farther from land sediments fall, the less calcareous they are. Some areas can have interbedded calcareous sediments due to storms, or changes in ocean currents. Calcareous ooze is a form of calcium carbonate derived from planktonic organisms that accumulates on the sea floor. This can only occur if the ocean is shallower than the carbonate compensation depth. Below this depth, calcium carbonate begins to dissolve in the ocean, and only non-calcareous sediments are stable, such as siliceous ooze or pelagic red clay.



==Ostracods==
Ostracods are widespread crustaceans, generally small, sometimes known as &quot;seed shrimps&quot;. They are flattened from side to side and protected with a calcareous or chitinous bivalve-like shell. There are about 70,000 known species, 13,000 of which are extant. Ostracods are typically about in size, though they can range from , with some species such as &quot;Gigantocypris&quot; being too large to be regarded as microfossils.

==Conodonts==

Conodonts (&quot;cone tooth&quot; in Greek) are tiny, extinct jawless fish that resemble eels. For many years, they were known only from tooth-like microfossils found in isolation and now called conodont elements. The evolution of mineralized tissues has been a puzzle for more than a century. It has been hypothesized that the first mechanism of chordate tissue mineralization began either in the oral skeleton of conodont or the dermal skeleton of early agnathans. Conodont elements are made of a phosphatic mineral, hydroxylapatite.

The element array constituted a feeding apparatus that is radically different from the jaws of modern animals. They are now termed &quot;conodont elements&quot; to avoid confusion. The three forms of teeth (i.e., coniform cones, ramiform bars, and pectiniform platforms) probably performed different functions. For many years, conodonts were known only from enigmatic tooth-like microfossils (200 micrometres to 5 millimetres in length) which occur commonly, but not always in isolation, and were not associated with any other fossil.

Conodonts are globally widespread in sediments.Their many forms are considered index fossils, fossils used to define and identify geological periods and date strata. Conodonts elements can be used to estimate the temperatures rocks have been exposed to, which allows the thermal maturation levels of sedimentary rocks to be determined, which is important for hydrocarbon exploration. Conodont teeth are the earliest vertebrate teeth found in the fossil record, and some conodont teeth are the sharpest that have ever been recorded.

==Scolecodonts==
Scolecodonts (&quot;worm jaws&quot; in Latin) are tiny jaws of polychaete annelids of the order Eunicida - a diverse and abundant group of worms which has been inhabiting different marine environments in the past 500 million years. Composed of highly resistant organic substance, the scolecodonts are frequently found as fossils from the rocks as old as the late Cambrian. Since the worms themselves were soft-bodied and hence extremely rarely preserved in the fossil record, their jaws constitute the main evidence of polychaetes in the geological past, and the only way to restore the evolution of this important group of animals. Small size of scolecodonts, usually less than 1 mm, puts them into a microfossil category. They are common by-product of conodont, chitinozoan and acritarch samples, but sometimes they occur in the sediments where other fossils are very rare or absent.

==Cloudinids==
The cloudinids were an early metazoan family that lived in the late Ediacaran period about 550 million years ago, and became extinct at the base of the Cambrian. They formed small millimetre size conical fossils consisting of calcareous cones nested within one another; the appearance of the organism itself remains unknown. The name &quot;Cloudina&quot; honors Preston Cloud. Fossils consist of a series of stacked vase-like calcite tubes, whose original mineral composition is unknown, Cloudinids comprise two genera: &quot;Cloudina&quot; itself is mineralized, whereas &quot;Conotubus&quot; is at best weakly mineralized, whilst sharing the same &quot;funnel-in-funnel&quot; construction.

Cloudinids had a wide geographic range, reflected in the present distribution of localities in which their fossils are found, and are an abundant component of some deposits. &quot;Cloudina&quot; is usually found in association with microbial stromatolites, which are limited to shallow water, and it has been suggested that cloudinids lived embedded in the microbial mats, growing new cones to avoid being buried by silt. However no specimens have been found embedded in mats, and their mode of life is still an unresolved question.

The classification of the cloudinids has proved difficult: they were initially regarded as polychaete worms, and then as coral-like cnidarians on the basis of what look like buds on some specimens. Current scientific opinion is divided between classifying them as polychaetes and regarding it as unsafe to classify them as members of any broader grouping. In 2020, a new study showed the presence of Nephrozoan type guts, the oldest on record, supporting the bilaterian interpretation.

Cloudinids are important in the history of animal evolution for two reasons. They are among the earliest and most abundant of the small shelly fossils with mineralized skeletons, and therefore feature in the debate about why such skeletons first appeared in the Late Ediacaran. The most widely supported answer is that their shells are a defense against predators, as some &quot;Cloudina&quot; specimens from China bear the marks of multiple attacks, which suggests they survived at least a few of them. The holes made by predators are approximately proportional to the size of the &quot;Cloudina&quot; specimens, and &quot;Sinotubulites&quot; fossils, which are often found in the same beds, have so far shown no such holes. These two points suggest that predators attacked in a selective manner, and the evolutionary arms race which this indicates is commonly cited as a cause of the Cambrian explosion of animal diversity and complexity.

==Dinoflagellate cysts==

Some dinoflagellates produce resting stages, called dinoflagellate cysts or dinocysts, as part of their lifecycles. Dinoflagellates are mainly represented in the fossil record by these dinocysts, typically 15 to 100 micrometres in diameter, which accumulate in sediments as microfossils. Organic-walled dinocysts have resistant cell walls made out of dinosporin. There are also calcareous dinoflagellate cysts and siliceous dinoflagellate cysts.

Dinocysts are produced by a proportion of dinoflagellates as a dormant, zygotic stage of their lifecycle. These dinocyst stages are known to occur in 84 of the 350 described freshwater dinoflagellate species, and in about 10% of the known marine species. Dinocysts have a long geological record with geochemical markers suggest a presence that goes back to the Early Cambrian.

==Sponge spicules==

Spicules are structural elements found in most sponges. They provide structural support and deter predators. The meshing of many spicules serves as the sponge&#x27;s skeleton, providing structural support and defense against predators.

Smaller, microscopic spicules can become microfossils, and are referred to as &quot;microscleres&quot;. Larger spicules visible to the naked eye are called &quot;megascleres&quot;. Spicule can be calcareous, siliceous, or composed of spongin. They are found in a range of symmetry types.

==Freshwater sediments==
==Marine sediments==


Sediments at the bottom of the ocean have two main origins, terrigenous and biogenous.

Terrigenous sediments account for about 45% of the total marine sediment, and originate in the erosion of rocks on land, transported by rivers and land runoff, windborne dust, volcanoes, or grinding by glaciers.

===Biogenous===
Biogenous sediments account for the other 55% of the total sediment, and originate in the skeletal remains of marine protists (single-celled plankton and benthos microorganisms). Much smaller amounts of precipitated minerals and meteoric dust can also be present. &quot;Ooze&quot;, in the context of a marine sediment, does not refer to the consistency of the sediment but to its biological origin. The term ooze was originally used by John Murray, the &quot;father of modern oceanography&quot;, who proposed the term &quot;radiolarian ooze&quot; for the silica deposits of radiolarian shells brought to the surface during the Challenger expedition. A &quot;biogenic ooze&quot; is a pelagic sediment containing at least 30 per cent from the skeletal remains of marine organisms.

==Micropaleontology==
The study of microfossils is called micropaleontology. In micropaleontology, what would otherwise be distinct categories are grouped together based solely on their size, including microscopic organisms and minute parts of larger organisms. Numerous sediments have microfossils, which serve as significant biostratigraphic, paleoenvironmental, and paleoceanographic markers. Their widespread presence around the world and physical toughness makes microfossils important for biostratigraphy, while the manner in which they have reacted to environmental changes makes them helpful when reconstructing past environments.

<text>&quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released in March 1964 as the A-side of their sixth single. It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song was included on the group&#x27;s album &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and was featured in a scene in Richard Lester&#x27;s film of the same title. The single topped charts in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the Netherlands, France and Sweden. In the UK, it was the fourth highest selling single of the 1960s.

==Composition==

While in Paris, the Beatles stayed at the five-star George V hotel and had an upright piano moved into one of their suites so that songwriting could continue. It was here that McCartney wrote &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;. The song was written under the pressure of the success achieved by &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, which had just reached number one in America. When producer George Martin first heard &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, he felt that the song needed changing: &quot;I thought that we really needed a tag for the song&#x27;s ending, and a tag for the beginning; a kind of intro. So I took the first two lines of the chorus and changed the ending, and said &#x27;Let&#x27;s just have these lines, and by altering the second phrase we can get back into the verse pretty quickly. And they said: &quot;That&#x27;s not a bad idea, we&#x27;ll do it that way&quot;. The song&#x27;s verse is a twelve-bar blues in structure, a formula that the Beatles seldom applied to their own material.

When pressed by American journalists in 1966 to reveal the song&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; meaning, McCartney stated: &quot;I think you can put any interpretation you want on anything, but when someone suggests that &#x27;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&#x27; is about a prostitute, I draw the line.&quot; He went on to say: &quot;The idea behind it was that all these material possessions are all very well, but they won&#x27;t buy me what I really want.&quot; However, he was to comment later: &quot;It should have been ″&quot;Can&quot; Buy Me Love when reflecting on the perks that money and fame had brought him.

==Recording==
&quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; was recorded on 29 January 1964 at EMI&#x27;s Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris, France, where the Beatles were performing 18 days of concerts at the Olympia Theatre. At this time, EMI&#x27;s West Germany branch, Odeon, insisted that the Beatles would not sell records in any significant numbers in Germany unless they were actually sung in the German language and the Beatles reluctantly agreed to re-record the vocals to &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; prior to them being released in Germany. George Martin travelled to Paris with a newly mastered rhythm track for what was to be &quot;Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand&quot;. &quot;Sie Liebt Dich&quot; required the Beatles to record a new rhythm track as the original two-track recording had been scrapped. EMI sent a translator to be present for this recording session which had been hurriedly arranged to tie in with the Beatles&#x27; Paris commitments. This was accomplished well within the allotted studio time, allowing the Beatles an opportunity to record the backing track, with a guide vocal, to the recently composed &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;. At this stage the song included background vocal harmonies, but after listening to the first take, the band concluded that the song did not need them. Therefore, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; became the first single the Beatles released without their characteristic background harmonies.

McCartney&#x27;s final vocal was overdubbed at EMI Studios, Abbey Road, London, on 25 February. Also re-recorded on this day at EMI Studios was George Harrison&#x27;s modified guitar solo, although his original solo can still just be heard in the background. Harrison said: &quot;What happened was, we recorded first in Paris and re-recorded in England. Obviously they&#x27;d tried to overdub it, but in those days they only had two tracks, so you can hear the version we put on in London, and in the background you can hear a quieter one.&quot; Helen Shapiro, a friend of the Beatles and present at this overdub session, says that Ringo Starr also added extra cymbals &quot;over the top&quot; and that &quot;apparently this was something he did quite often on their records&quot;. &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; is also the only English-language track that the Beatles recorded in a studio outside the UK, although the instrumentation of the band&#x27;s 1968 B-side &quot;The Inner Light&quot; was recorded in India by Harrison and some Indian classical musicians.

==Release==
&quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; was released as a single, backed by John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot;. The release took place on 16 March 1964 in the United States and four days later in the United Kingdom. In the US, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for five weeks. With the success of the song, the Beatles established four records on the Hot 100:

# Until &quot;Billboard&quot; began using SoundScan for their charts in 1991, the song had the biggest jump to the top position: number 27 to number 1.
# It gave the Beatles three consecutive chart-topping singles, since &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; was replaced at number 1 by &quot;She Loves You&quot;, which was in turn replaced by &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;. The three songs spent a combined total of 14 consecutive weeks at number 1. This is the only time an artist had three number 1 singles in a row.
# When &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; reached number 1, on 4 April 1964, the Beatles held the entire top five on the Hot 100, the next positions being filled by &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, respectively. No other act had held the top five spots simultaneously, a record not broken until 2022.
# During its second week at number 1, the Beatles had fourteen songs on the Hot 100 at the same time.

In the UK, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; became the Beatles&#x27; fourth number 1 and their third single to sell over a million copies. By November 2012, it had sold 1.53 million copies there. As of December 2018, it was the 35th best-selling single of all time in the UK – one of six Beatles songs included on the top sales rankings published by the Official Charts Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers/OCC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; was included on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; album in June 1964 and the US soundtrack album of the same name, released on United Artists Records. For its sequence in the film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, director Richard Lester used crane shots to capture the four band members running and leaping in a sports field. In his book on the history of music videos, &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, author Saul Austerlitz places &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; at number 33 on the &quot;Top 100 Videos List&quot;.

Subsequent album appearances for the song include the compilations &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; (1966) and &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (1970; also known as &quot;The Beatles Again&quot;), the 1973 double-disc collection &quot;1962–1966&quot;, the 1982 release &quot;Reel Music&quot;, which features songs from the Beatles&#x27; feature films; the 1982 compilation &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot; and the 2000 greatest hits album &quot;1&quot;; a composite of takes one and two of &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; was included on the &quot;Anthology 1&quot; compilation in 1995. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; at number 295 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010.

In September 2015, the Beatles donated the use of their recording of the song to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals for a television commercial.

McCartney opened his 2022 &quot;Got Back&quot; Tour gigs with the song.

==Cover versions==
Ella Fitzgerald recorded the song for her 1964 album &quot;Hello, Dolly&quot;. This version was also released as a single, peaking at number 34 in the UK in June 1964, spending five weeks on the chart. Alex Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; cites Fitzgerald as an example of how several artists, responding to the composition&#x27;s swing-like rhythmic quality, issued &quot;parent-friendly jazz covers&quot; of &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, and how the song was &quot;key to establishing the Beatles&#x27; cross-generational appeal&quot;.

R&amp;B group Blackstreet recorded a slower-tempo cover of the song for their 1996 album &quot;Another Level&quot;.

<doc id="1209647" wikidata="Q1755026" url="?curid=1209647" title="Belmont transmitting station">
<text>The Belmont transmitting station is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility next to the B1225, west of the village of Donington on Bain in the civil parish of South Willingham, near Market Rasen and Louth in Lincolnshire, England (). It is owned and operated by Arqiva.

It has a guyed tubular steel mast, with a lattice upper section. The mast was shortened in April 2010 and is now in height. Before this it was high and was considered to be the tallest structure of its kind in the world (taller masts, such as the KVLY-TV mast in the United States, use steel lattice construction), and the tallest structure of any type in the United Kingdom. After the top section was removed, the mast&#x27;s reduced height relegated it to the second-highest in the UK after Skelton in Cumbria.

Despite the mast being shortened it can be seen in daylight on clear days from most areas close to and within the Lincolnshire Wolds. On clear nights its bright red aircraft warning lights can be very widely seen across much of Lincolnshire from as far north as the Humber estuary and Barton-Upon-Humber; from the west of the county it can be seen from Lincoln, Gainsborough and Grantham; from the south of the county it can be seen from Spalding and Bourne; and from the east it can be seen from Skegness, Mablethorpe and most areas along the Lincolnshire coast. The lights can also be seen from many parts of Nottinghamshire, coastal areas of North West Norfolk and a few parts of Derbyshire on very clear nights.

==Construction==
A planning application was made in October 1963 to Louth Rural District. Work had started by April 1964.

The foundations were laid on 30 June 1964. The concrete foundation was built by the end of October 1964, with tube sections being added from November 1964 at the site, near Benniworth.

It would be the seventh highest mast in the world. The first 900 ft would be a 9-ft diameter steel cylinder, with the rest a steel lattice. There would be a 12 ft cylinder around this lattice, with the top 150 ft being 9 ft wide. 1200 cubic feet of concrete was poured into its 32 square feet foundations. 12 people would work on the site.

The mast was constructed in 1965 and it came into service on 20 December of that year. As built it was a tubular pipe long by in diameter, surmounted by a lattice upper section (an identical mast was constructed in 1964 at Emley Moor near Huddersfield in Yorkshire, but the other mast collapsed due to guy failure caused by icing and high winds on 19 March 1969). Its ropes weigh 85 tons, made by British Ropes, with steel from Steel, Peech and Tozer of Templeborough in South Yorkshire. The column weighs 210 tons and has 375 segments, with steel from United Steel Companies at Scunthorpe in northern Lincolnshire.

In September 1967, meteorological equipment was added to the mast extending its height to . The imperial measurement was the accepted value quoted by publications including the 1993 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. The metric measurement quoted by the current owners is shorter.

Between October 2009 and April 2010, the mast was shortened as part of the Digital Switchover works. Most of the top section above the fifth stay level was removed (along with the sixth stay level) and the mast now stands high.

==Coverage==
From its location, high in the Lincolnshire Wolds, it broadcasts digital television and both analogue and digital radio to Lincolnshire, eastern Yorkshire, northern parts of Norfolk and some eastern parts of Nottinghamshire. Belmont is the main transmitter that covers the cities of Hull and Lincoln. When it was first operated it transmitted (amongst others) ITV station Anglia Television. Following a re-organisation of ITV coverage in 1972, from 1974 it started transmitting neighbouring station Yorkshire Television instead, which it continues to do to this day.

==Transmission==
Due to bad weather in late 1965, it did not offer a full ITV service until Monday 16 May 1966. But BBC and VHF radio would start in autumn 1966. Emley Moor, its twin, came into full service on 15 August 1966.

The transmitters were not installed by the end of September 1966, but BBC equipment was being tested by early 1966, with full BBC service on Saturday 19 November 1966, and test transmissions from 5 November, with Peterborough able to receive these broadcasts. This was the same month that Pontop Pike also began transmissions. Tacolneston went into full service on 9 September 1967.

On 19 February 1969 wintry weather caused an eight-hour power cut, and staff were cut off by snow drifts, with a small amount of food. One month later, wintry weather brought down an identical mast, Emley Moor. Emley Moor was the highest man-made structure in Europe
The first colour tests from Monday 18 January 1971; Sandy Heath began full colour broadcasting on 8 February 1971; Tacolneston went colour on 1 October 1970.

Full colour on channel 22 for BBC1 began on Monday 15 February 1971, 
 ITV would be later on Monday 24 May 1971.

==Transmitter power==
In the analogue era Belmont, at 500 kW E.R.P. for the four main analogue television channels, was one of the most powerful transmitters in the UK, though there were four UK transmitters which were more powerful; Sutton Coldfield, Crystal Palace and Sandy Heath were all at 1000 kW and Emley Moor was 870 kW. After digital switchover Belmont&#x27;s digital transmitting power was 50 kW for SDN (previously Mux A), 100 kW for Arqiva A &amp; B (Mux C, D) and 150 kW for BBC A, D3&amp;4 and BBC B (Mux 1, 2, B).

==700MHz clearance==
On 4 March 2020, Belmont was due to complete its 700MHz clearance and will become an A group transmitter, excluding the temporary MUXES 7 and 8 (see graph). Since Belmont started out as an A group for (just) analogue it returns to that band after being a wideband for 21 years. Technically the advent of C5 analogue complicated the issue for a few months prior to (dual) running digital transmissions started in 1998.

==Services listed by frequency==

===Analogue television===

====20 December 1965 – 19 November 1966====
First transmissions from the site: ITV&#x27;s 405-line television service was fed by off-air reception of Mendlesham at Great Massingham in Norfolk, with an onward microwave link to Belmont via an intermediate point at Winceby in Lincolnshire.

====19 November 1966 – 24 May 1971====
The BBC&#x27;s services came online on both VHF and UHF. BBC1 was initially fed by means of an off-air rebroadcast of Holme Moss but this was plagued by co-channel interference from the continent. BBC2 was an off-air rebroadcast from Emley Moor. On 19 March 1969, the Emley Moor mast collapsed, taking Belmont&#x27;s BBC2 transmissions off-air for several days.

Despite the programme sources on VHF and UHF being (for many years) off-air rebroadcasts of other transmitters in the vicinity, Belmont was always regarded by the BBC as being a &quot;main station&quot; both on VHF and UHF. The IBA initially regarded it as a relay of Mendlesham (and numbered it 14.2 in their numbering of VHF stations) but from 1974 it became a &quot;main station&quot; for Yorkshire Television (renumbered as 20.0 in the IBA&#x27;s numbering of VHF stations) after changes in the minor franchise areas.

It was always number 120.0 in the BBC/IBA numbering scheme for UHF stations).

====24 May 1971 – 30 July 1974====
ITV&#x27;s UHF service began.

====30 July 1974 – 2 November 1982====
After changes to the regional structure of ITV in 1972, Belmont stopped being a relay of Mendlesham and became a main station for Yorkshire TV. It was fed by a Post Office (later BT) microwave link from Leeds, allowing Yorkshire TV to supply Belmont with a separate 7-minute segment of their regional news magazine programme &quot;Calendar&quot;, a Belmont titled version of Anglia&#x27;s weather forecast, as well as having the ability to sell advertising separately in the Belmont and Emley Moor areas. The microwave link from Leeds to Belmont apparently ran via Emley Moor, where the IBA could insert test transmissions, such as Test Card &quot;F&quot;

====2 November 1982 – 30 March 1997====
Both the BBC and ITV 405-line VHF TV services from Belmont were discontinued early in mid-1982, and when Channel 4 began formal transmissions in November that year it was radiated on UHF from the site:

====30 March 1997 – 15 November 1998====
Belmont started transmitting the UK&#x27;s final terrestrial analogue UHF TV service: Channel 5. This was done well out-of-band and at reduced power compared with the main group.

===Analogue and digital television===

====15 November 1998 – 3 August 2011====
Belmont began transmitting digital TV, with the new digital multiplexes spaced far from the existing analogue channels. In July 2007 it was confirmed by Ofcom that Belmont would be remaining a wideband transmitter after digital switchover.

====3 August 2011 – 17 August 2011====
BBC2 closed on UHF 28. BBC1 was moved on to that channel for its final three weeks of service. Pre-DSO Multiplex 1 (BBC) on UHF 30 was closed and was replaced by BBC A on UHF 22.

===Digital television===

====17 August 2011 – 26 November 2013====
All the remaining analogue and existing digital signals were turned off and replaced with higher-power digital signals.

*Arqiva A and Arqiva B were limited to 4 kW until 23 November 2011, when they were increased to 100 kW.

====26 November 2013 – 4 February 2020====
Local TV, carrying Estuary TV, and Arqiva C, carrying additional HD services, launched on 26 November 2013.

====5 February 2020 – 3 March 2020====
Arqiva A moved from UHF 53 to UHF 23, in accordance with the 700MHz clearance.

====4 March 2020 – 24 June 2020====
Arqiva B moved from UHF 60- to UHF 26, and a power increase of the Local multiplex, in accordance with the 700MHz clearance.

====25 June 2020 – Present====
COM 8 was switched off permanently in accordance with the 700MHz clearance programme.

===Analogue radio (FM VHF)===

====19 November 1966 – 11 November 1980====
====11 November 1980 – February 1992====
BBC Radio Lincolnshire started broadcasting. BBC Radio 1 officially launched in 98.3 on 27 July 1990

====February 1992 – present day====
Lincs FM (launched 1 March 1992) and Classic FM (launched 1 September 1992) join the set of FM broadcasts.

<doc id="1209650" wikidata="Q424929" url="?curid=1209650" title="Koppa (Cyrillic)">
<text>Koppa (Ҁ ҁ; italics: &quot;Ҁ ҁ&quot;) is an archaic numeral character of the Cyrillic script. Its form (and modern name) are derived from some forms of the Greek letter Koppa (Ϙ ϙ).

Koppa was used as a numeral character in the oldest Cyrillic manuscripts, representing the value 90 (exactly as its Greek ancestor did). It was replaced relatively early around 1300 by the Cyrillic letter Che (Ч ч), which is similar in appearance and originally had no numeric value. Isolated examples of Ч used as a numeral are found in the East and South Slavonic areas as early as the eleventh century, though Koppa continued in regular use into the fourteenth century. In some varieties of Western Cyrillic, however, Koppa was retained, and Ч used with the value 60, replacing the Cyrillic letter Ksi (Ѯ ѯ).

Cyrillic Koppa never had a phonetic value and was never used as a letter by any national language using Cyrillic. However, certain modern textbooks and dictionaries of Old Church Slavonic language insert this character among other letters of the early Cyrillic alphabet, either between П and Р (to reproduce the Greek alphabetical order) or at the very end of the list.

<doc id="1209651" wikidata="Q959812" url="?curid=1209651" title="Ticket to Ride (song)">
<text>&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney. Issued as a single in April 1965, it became the Beatles&#x27; seventh consecutive number 1 hit in the United Kingdom and their third consecutive number 1 hit (and eighth in total) in the United States, and similarly topped national charts in Canada, Australia and Ireland. The song was included on their 1965 album &quot;Help!&quot; Recorded at EMI Studios in London in February that year, the track marked a progression in the Beatles&#x27; work through the incorporation of drone and harder-sounding instrumentation relative to their previous releases. Among music critics, Ian MacDonald describes the song as &quot;psychologically deeper than anything the Beatles had recorded before&quot; and &quot;extraordinary for its time&quot;.

&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; appears in a sequence in the Beatles&#x27; second feature film, &quot;Help!&quot;, directed by Richard Lester. Live performances by the band were included in the &quot;Beatles at Shea Stadium&quot; concert film, on the live album documenting their concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, and on the 1996 &quot;Anthology 2&quot; box set. In 1969, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was covered by The Carpenters, whose version peaked at number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Composition==

&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was primarily written by John Lennon,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and credited to Lennon–McCartney. In 1965, Lennon claimed that the song was &quot;three-quarters mine and Paul [McCartney] changed it a bit. He said let&#x27;s alter the tune.&quot; However, speaking in 1980, Lennon said that McCartney&#x27;s contribution was limited to &quot;the way Ringo [Starr] played the drums&quot; on the recording. In his 1997 authorised biography, Paul McCartney contradicts this, providing an account more similar to Lennon&#x27;s 1965 assessment: &quot;we sat down and wrote it together … give him 60 percent of it … we sat down together and worked on that for a full three-hour songwriting session.&quot;

The song is written in the key of A major. The structure of the composition is in an expanded variation of the AABA pop song format, with eight bars of verse and eight bars of chorus forming the A section, and a nine-bar primary bridge forming the B section. The sustained A chord over the verses creates an implied drone common in Indian music and supports a melody that author Ian MacDonald terms &quot;raga-like&quot;.

The song&#x27;s coda features a change of tempo. In the view of musicologist Walter Everett, the latter section marks a progression on previous Beatles songs that similarly revisit aspects of a composition when ending with a coda. In the case of &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, the section consists of a repeated refrain similar to the last line of the chorus (&quot;My baby don&#x27;t care&quot;), played over a constant A major chord and set to the double-time rhythm used in the bridge. Lennon said this closing section was one of his &quot;favourite bits&quot; in the song. He also claimed that &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was the first heavy metal record ever made. According to MacDonald, the track&#x27;s heavy sound may have been influenced by Lennon and George Harrison&#x27;s first encounter with LSD, the precise date for which varies among Beatles biographers. Author Simon Philo calls the song &quot;avant-garde masquerading as pop&quot;.

While the lyrics describe a girl &quot;riding out of the life of the narrator&quot;, the inspiration of the title phrase is unclear, as is the meaning of the song. McCartney said the title referred to &quot;a British Railways ticket to the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight&quot;, and Lennon said it described cards indicating a clean bill of health carried by Hamburg prostitutes in the 1960s. The Beatles played in Hamburg early in their musical career, and a &quot;ride&quot; was British slang for having sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black/Blender&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gaby Whitehill and Andrew Trendall of &quot;Gigwise&quot; have interpreted the song to be about a woman leaving her boyfriend to become a prostitute.

==Recording==

The Beatles recorded &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; on 15 February 1965 at EMI Studios in London. It was the band&#x27;s first recording session since completing the &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; album on 26 October 1964, after which they had toured the UK and played a season of Christmas shows in London until mid-January. The session inaugurated what author Mark Lewisohn describes as &quot;a more serious application in the recording studio&quot; by the group, which included taping rehearsals of each song they worked on and concentrating on backing or rhythm tracks, after which they would overdub more detailed instrumental parts. Everett views the recording as a radical departure for the Beatles, due to the vocals and lead guitar parts being overdubbed for the first time.

The song&#x27;s main guitar riff was played by Harrison on his Rickenbacker 12-string guitar and was among the parts taped with the rhythm track. Author Mark Hertsgaard highlights the idea for this riff and for Starr&#x27;s &quot;jagged, whack-and-jump&quot; drum pattern as examples of McCartney&#x27;s increasing importance as the Beatles&#x27; musical director. According to Harrison, however, the Rickenbacker riff was his own idea, based on the way Lennon strummed the chord when introducing the song to the band. Harrison also said that the &quot;staggered&quot; motion of the riff then inspired the pattern that Starr decided to play. In addition to Lennon&#x27;s lead vocal and McCartney&#x27;s harmony, the overdubs included further electric guitar parts by Lennon and Harrison (on Rickenbacker 325 and Fender Stratocaster, respectively), over the verses, and by McCartney (on Epiphone Casino), who supplied the fills that close the bridges and the solo over the coda.

==Release==
In March 1965, the Beatles and their manager, Brian Epstein, selected &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and &quot;Yes It Is&quot; to be the A- and B-sides, respectively, of the group&#x27;s first single release of the year. The record was issued by EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label on 9 April 1965 in the United Kingdom, and by Capitol Records on 19 April in the United States. A contemporary news report stated that the Beatles were due to promote the single on television shows such as &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, and that the band were forming an independent production company with their producer, George Martin, which would earn them a more favourable financial return on their recordings. A portion of the group&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance of &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; survived only because it was later used in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Executioners&quot;, which aired on BBC1 on 22 May. The episode was part of the serial &quot;The Chase&quot; and sees the Doctor using a time–space machine in the future to observe historical figures such as William Shakespeare, Abraham Lincoln and the Beatles. In addition to their television promotion, the group performed the song during their last session for BBC Radio, on 26 May, which was broadcast as &quot;The Beatles (Invite You to Take a Ticket to Ride)&quot;.

&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; topped Britain&#x27;s official singles chart for three weeks. It went straight in at number 1 on the national listings compiled by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, where it also stayed for three weeks, and similarly topped Ireland&#x27;s singles chart in its first week of release there. In America, the song was number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for one week. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hits of the World listings for 15 May 1965, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was also the top-selling single in Australia. The US single&#x27;s face label stated that the A-side was from the forthcoming United Artists release &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;, which was the original title of the Beatles&#x27; second film, directed by Richard Lester. The title was changed to &quot;Help!&quot; after the single&#x27;s release. In the film, the song plays over a sequence during which the Beatles attempt to ski and frequently fall over. The track appeared on the band&#x27;s 1965 album &quot;Help!&quot;, which was issued on 6 August in the UK and on 13 August in the US.

&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was the seventh consecutive chart-topping single for the Beatles in the UK and the first Beatles track released with a running time exceeding three minutes. On the American charts, it was the third of six number 1 singles in a row, a record at the time, along with &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; – all achieved in the space of twelve months from January 1965. Everett writes that although the song achieved &quot;classic&quot; status, it was a surprise among Beatles singles in that it failed to achieve gold accreditation from the Recording Industry Association of America. When the song hit number 1 there, the Beatles became the fourth consecutive English group to hold down the top spot, after the Mancunian groups Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, and Herman&#x27;s Hermits. As part of EMI&#x27;s plan to exploit the 20th anniversary of each Beatles single, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was reissued in the UK in April 1985 and peaked at number 70 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Appearance in &quot;Help!&quot; and promotional film==
&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; features in a scene in the film &quot;Help!&quot; The Beatles are seen attempting to ski and avoiding a team of assassins from a cult whose quest is to murder Starr. The scene was filmed at Obertauern in the Austrian Alps in March 1965.

On 23 November 1965, the Beatles filmed promotional clips for &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and four other songs, including both sides of their upcoming single at the time, &quot;Day Tripper&quot; / &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, at Twickenham Film Studios in south-west London. The films were directed by Joe McGrath, who had worked on &quot;Help!&quot; as an assistant to Lester. In the case of &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, the clip was made for inclusion in &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;″ round-up of the biggest hits of 1965.

Against a backdrop of oversized tickets, the Beatles are shown miming to the song, with Starr standing at his drum kit and the other band members sitting in director&#x27;s chairs. Part of the clip appeared in the 1995 documentary &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;. In 2015, it was included in full on the Beatles&#x27; video compilation &quot;1&quot;.

==Critical reception==

In his contemporary review of the single, Derek Johnson of the &quot;NME&quot; admired the &quot;depth of sound&quot; and &quot;tremendous drive&quot; of the recording. Music critics Richie Unterberger of AllMusic and Ian MacDonald both feel that &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; is an important milestone in the evolution of the musical style of the Beatles. Unterberger said, &quot;the rhythm parts on &#x27;Ticket to Ride&#x27; were harder and heavier than they had been on any previous Beatles outing, particularly in Ringo Starr&#x27;s stormy stutters and rolls.&quot; MacDonald describes it as &quot;psychologically deeper than anything the Beatles had recorded before ... extraordinary for its time – massive with chiming electric guitars, weighty rhythm, and rumbling floor tom-toms&quot;, and he views the production as a signal of the band&#x27;s next major change of musical direction, with &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; in April 1966. MacDonald also comments that, while the Kinks&#x27; &quot;See My Friends&quot; has been identified as the inspiration for the Beatles&#x27; use of Indian instrumentation later in 1965, the subtle drone in &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; could equally have influenced the Kinks when they recorded &quot;See My Friends&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2002, musician and journalist Bob Stanley said the track was &quot;where moptop Beatlemania ends and [the Beatles]&#x27; weightless, ageless legend begins&quot;. In his song review for &quot;Blender&quot;, Johnny Black similarly described it as a &quot;watershed&quot; recording and attributed its relatively poor US sales to the song&#x27;s &quot;weird soup of hypnotically chiming, droning guitars, stuttering drums and contrasting vocal textures that, in the context of the 1965 charts, was far ahead of its time&quot;. Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; sees a darker edge to Lennon&#x27;s lyric writing during the &quot;Help!&quot; period and he cites &quot;the drone of riffing, proto-heavy-rock song Ticket to Ride&quot; as an example of the band&#x27;s more sophisticated sound, and of how the album &quot;contains some of their greatest early songs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick/Tele&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham similarly views the track as &quot;magnificently brooding&quot; and &quot;the most intense music The Beatles had yet recorded&quot;. In his review of &quot;Help!&quot; for BBC Music, David Quantick includes &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; among the album&#x27;s &quot;flashes of brilliance&quot; and describes it as &quot;the song that saw The Beatles take on The Kinks, the Stones and The Who at their own, more rocky game&quot;.

&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; has been included in many critics&#x27; best-song lists, including top 500 &quot;all-time&quot; lists compiled by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2010 (at number 394) and the &quot;NME&quot; in 2014 (number 311). Dave Marsh ranked it 29th on his 1989 list &quot;The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made&quot;. The track appeared at number 17 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot; and at number 23 on a similar list compiled by &quot;Mojo&quot;. In his commentary for &quot;Mojo&quot;, John Harris said that &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was &quot;the sound of a four-piece group hurtling way beyond the beat-pop being churned out by their peers&quot; but also showed the band developing the same sound that the Byrds adopted on their &quot;pivotal&quot; debut single, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/Mojo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the staff of &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; at number 10 in their list of the 25 &quot;Classic&quot; Beatles tracks, which they defined as &quot;not necessarily the &#x27;best songs&#x27;&quot; by the band, but those &quot;through which (perhaps) we might gain the deepest appreciation for their popular genius&quot;. David Gassman said the track was most notable as an early example of the Beatles incorporating Indian sounds, anticipating &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and &quot;Within You Without You&quot;. He also described the song as &quot;Exhibit A that Ringo Starr is one of the greatest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll drummers of all time&quot; and said it was among the band&#x27;s best singles. In 2014, &quot;USA Today&quot; named it the best Beatles song, saying: &quot;No single better reflects the ambition, tension and pure pop genius that made the Beatles unique … &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; is perfection all the way through.&quot; The music staff of &quot;Time Out London&quot; ranked it at number 11 on their 2018 list of the best Beatles songs.

==Live performances==
The Beatles played &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; throughout their June–July 1965 European tour. A live performance from the 1 August 1965 broadcast of &quot;Blackpool Night Out&quot; was included on the &quot;Anthology 2&quot; compilation and shown during &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; documentary. On 14 August, the group recorded a live performance of the song for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, broadcast the following month.

&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was also included in the set list for the Beatles&#x27; 1965 US tour and their UK tour at the end of the year. The 15 August performance at Shea Stadium appears in the 1966 documentary &quot;The Beatles at Shea Stadium&quot;, although the audio for the song was re-recorded in London prior to release. The group&#x27;s 29 August performance at the Hollywood Bowl was chosen for the 1977 album &quot;The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;.

==Cover versions==

===The Carpenters===
In mid-1969, the American pop-music duo the Carpenters covered &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; for their debut studio album &quot;Offering&quot;. Richard Carpenter recalled: &quot;I happened to hear [the song] being played as an oldie one day in early 1969, and upon hearing it this particular time, decided the tune would make a nice ballad.&quot; As arranged by Richard Carpenter, the song became the plaint of a castoff lover, with the opening line: &quot;I think I&#x27;m gonna be sad&quot;, being sung repeatedly as the track fades.

The musicians on the recording were Karen Carpenter (lead and backing vocals, drums), Richard Carpenter (backing vocals, piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, orchestration), Joe Osborn (bass guitar), David Duke (French horn), Herb Alpert (shaker) and uncredited contributors on bell tree and tubular bells.

Released as the duo&#x27;s first single – without the album track&#x27;s introductory twelve measures – &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; became the Carpenters&#x27; first charting single, peaking at number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in May 1970, reaching number 19 on the same magazine&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart, and number 24 on the Canadian AC chart in February. The single&#x27;s success led to its parent album being reissued as &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;. The first Carpenters&#x27; retrospective, &quot;The Singles: 1969–1973&quot;, issued in 1973, featured an amended version of &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; with a new lead vocal by Karen Carpenter. Other amendments were a new drum track by Karen to replace her drumming on the original track, and the addition of guitar work by Carpenters regular sideman Tony Peluso (who had not been attached to the group in 1969).

===Other artists===
The song was covered by former Motown artist Mary Wells, a favourite of the Beatles, who had invited her to open their concerts during a 1964 UK tour. Wells&#x27; recording appeared on her 1965 album &quot;Love Songs to the Beatles&quot;. Brian Wilson appropriated part of the melody and vocal intonation from &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; into the Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;Girl Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;. Later that same year, George Martin covered &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; on his album of orchestral instrumentals titled &quot;Help!&quot;, producing a version that &quot;Billboard&quot;″s reviewer admired as being &quot;worth the price of the album&quot;.

Mezzo-soprano singer Cathy Berberian opened her 1967 album &quot;Beatles Arias&quot; with a baroque interpretation of &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; arranged by Luciano Berio. Late the previous year, Berberian had surprised her Carnegie Hall concert audience by performing this and two other well-known Beatles songs – a gesture that musicologist Kate Meehan cites as reflecting the band&#x27;s elevated status among many classical musicians and composers from mid 1965 onwards.

English singer Alma Cogan, with whom Lennon had an extramarital affair, covered &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; in the style of Dionne Warwick for her final album, &quot;Alma&quot;, released a year after her death in 1966. Vanilla Fudge recorded what Paul Collins of AllMusic describes as a &quot;stoned-out, slowed-down&quot; version of the track for their 1967 self-titled debut album. The 5th Dimension included &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; on &quot;The Magic Garden&quot;, an album that, according to Ken Shane of Popdose, &quot;tells the story of a love affair from its rapturous beginning, through trials and tribulations to its end, and beyond&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shane/Popdose&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While Unterberger dismisses it as &quot;a misfired cover&quot;, Shane describes the song as &quot;a terrific version&quot; that complements the Jimmy Webb-written song cycle that fills the rest of the album.

&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was also covered by the Bee Gees, whose version appeared on their limited-release rarities compilation &quot;Inception/Nostalgia&quot; (1970), and by the New Seekers, who combined it in a medley with &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; for their 1972 UK album &quot;We&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing&quot;. Punk band Hüsker Dü contributed a cover of &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; to &quot;NME&#x27;s Big Four&quot;, an EP distributed free with the 1 February 1986 issue of &quot;NME&quot; magazine. Johnny Black paired this version with the Carpenters&#x27; hit recording as examples of how the Lennon–McCartney song continues to endure. Echo &amp; the Bunnymen recorded &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; in 2001, creating a version that Vulture.com later included among its ten best Beatles covers. That same year, Beatallica parodied the song on their &quot;A Garage Dayz Nite&quot; track &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got a Ticket to Ride Except for Me and My Lightning&quot;.

In Pink Floyd&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; specifically at the end of the closing track &quot;Eclipse,&quot; a brief orchestral sample of &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; can be heard faintly in the background on some releases of the album.

==Personnel==
According to Ian MacDonald, the line-up on the Beatles&#x27; recording was as follows:
*John Lennon – double-tracked lead vocal, rhythm guitar
*Paul McCartney – harmony vocal, bass guitar, lead guitar
*George Harrison – lead guitar (12-string), rhythm guitar
*Ringo Starr – drums, tambourine, handclaps

<text>Egodahage George Wilfred Alwis Samarakoon (13 January 1911 – 2 April 1962) known as Ananda Samarakoon was a Sri Lankan (Sinhalese) composer and musician. He composed the Sri Lankan national anthem &quot;Namo Namo Matha&quot; and is considered the father of artistic Sinhala music and founder of the modern Sri Lankan Sinhala &quot;Geeta Sahitya&quot; (Song Literature). He committed suicide in 1962.

== Early life and education ==
Born on 13 January 1911 as Egodahage George Wilfred Alwis Samarakoon, to Samuel Samarakoon, Chief Clerk to British-owned Maturata Plantations and Dominga Peries in Watareka, Padukka. He was the second of four sons in a Christian family. Samarakoon received his primary education at Wewala School and thereafter attended CMS Sri Jayawardenepura College (Christian College, Kotte). His Sinhala Guru was Pandit D.C.P. Gamalathge. Later he served his Alma mater as a teacher of Music and Art. Samarakoon left for the Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan in India to study art and music. After six months he abandoned his studies and returned to Ceylon, and changed his name to Ananda Samarakoon, embracing Buddhism. Then he served as the music teacher of Mahinda College, Galle from 1938 to 1942.

== Career ==
===Composer===
In 1937, the popular music of Sri Lanka consisted of songs derived from the North Indian Ragadhari music. These songs lyrics often contained meaningless phrases with little or no literary merit. Samarakone set out to create a form of a music that can be classified as Sri Lanka&#x27;s own and came out with the song &quot; Ennada Menike (එන්නද මැණිකේ) &quot; (1940) that paved the foundation for the artistic Sinhala music. In 1940, he composed &quot;Namo Namo Mata&quot; to instill patriotism and love for one&#x27;s country, in his students at Mahinda College.It was first sung by little Mahindians at the prestigious Olcott Hall. That song was later selected as the National anthem of Sri Lanka by the Sri Lankan government.

The love themed song &quot;Endada Menike&quot; unfolds in the form of a dialogue between a young village boy and a girl. Poetic and beautifully rustic, it became a success and Samarakone followed it with a string of successful songs in the early to mid-1940s, the period considered his golden age. Among his best known works are: 
*&quot;Podimal Etano (පොඩීමල් එතනෝ)&quot;
*&quot;Vilay Malak Pipila&quot;
*&quot;Poson Pohoda&quot;
*&quot;Asay madura&quot;
*&quot;Sunila Guvanay&quot;
*&quot;Punchi Suda&quot;
*&quot;Nilvala Gangay&quot;
*&quot;Sumano&quot;
*&quot;Pudamu Kusum&quot;
*&quot;Siri Saru Saara Ketay&quot;

===Painter===
In 1945, Samarakoon&#x27;s only son died at the age of five, and the grieving Samarakoon left Sri Lanka for India where he pursued a painting career and held eleven art exhibitions there. Though his painting were critically acclaimed, he returned to music in 1951 back in Sri Lanka.

===National anthem===
One of Samarakoon&#x27;s early compositions, &quot;Namo Namo Mata&quot; was nominated as the national anthem and was officially adopted as the national anthem of Ceylon on 22 November 1951, from a committee headed by Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne. Critics attacked Namo Namo Mata, particularly the &quot;Gana&quot; significance of the introductory words (Namo Namo Matha) which designate disease and ill luck to the political leaders of the country. Samarakone who has completed Ghana Shasthra studies in India, clearly stated the ones who were asking to change the lyrics, that he is the only one to complete Ghana Shastra studies in India and that he would knows if there is any mistake or not. But after some days, he was asked to visit the SL broadcasting cooperation and had made to listen to his song which had been changed without his knowledge and consent.

===Death===
On 5 April 1962, at the age of 51, Samarakoon committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping tablets. This is due the change made to the National Anthem &quot;Namo Namo Mata&quot;

<text>The Toys were an American pop girl group from Jamaica, New York, which was formed in 1961 and disbanded in 1968. Their most successful recording was &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Concerto&quot; (1965), which sold more than two million copies and reached the number-two spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

==Members==
The trio consisted of:
* Barbara Harris (born Barbara Ann Harris, August 18, 1945, Elizabeth City, North Carolina),
* Barbara Parritt (born October 1, 1944, Wilmington, North Carolina)
* June Montiero (born July 1, 1946, Queens, New York)

==Career==

Barbara Harris started singing in her hometown churches at an early age and moved to Queens, New York, when she was 11 years old. In high school, she joined a group with four other young singers: Barbara Parritt (later Toomer), June Montiero, Betty Stokes and Betty Blocker.

Stokes and Blocker eventually left the group, and Harris, Parritt and Montiero formed a trio. Bobby Uri, a manager and friend, named the group The Charlettes, and got them work doing background vocals for several recording artists. At a talent show in Brooklyn, they met Eddy Chase, who in turn introduced them to manager Vince Marc and songwriter/recording executive Bob Crewe. The group became the Toys and landed their first recording contract on Crewe&#x27;s DynoVoice Records.

Marc introduced them to songwriters Sandy Linzer and Denny Randell. Linzer and Randell wrote most of the songs they recorded. They took a piano piece from a Bach exercise book (&quot;Minuet in G major&quot; by Christian Petzold), put a Motown bassline to it, and &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Concerto&quot; was born; the song soon rose to number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The band followed that up with another hit, &quot;Attack!&quot;, also written by Linzer and Randell, which reached the Top 20.

They also produced the group&#x27;s 1965–66 recordings on the DynoVoice record label. Global sales of this disc exceeded two million copies, with a gold record awarded by the R.I.A.A. in 1965.
Their first U.S. tour was with Gene Pitney. In 1967, the group changed labels and producers, moving to Pitney&#x27;s label, Musicor Records, but charted only one more minor single (a cover of Brian Hyland&#x27;s &quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot;) before breaking up.

The Toys appeared on most of the major TV rock programs, including &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; and &quot;Shindig!&quot;. They had a cameo role performing their song &quot;Attack!&quot; in the 1967 beach movie &quot;It&#x27;s a Bikini World&quot;.

Harris continued to perform on public television and at &quot;Oldie Shows&quot; as &quot;The Toys featuring Barbara Harris&quot;. She has also sung with Joe Rivers, known for Johnnie &amp; Joe&#x27;s hit, &quot;Over The Mountain&quot;. In 1998, she produced and released her first solo CD entitled &quot;Barbara Now&quot;, for which she wrote all but two of the songs. In 2016, she released the singles, &quot;Forever Spring&quot; and &quot;(Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll) Soothes The Soul&quot;.

<text>Julie Ruin is the debut solo album by Kathleen Hanna (under the pseudonym Julie Ruin), released on September 29, 1998, through Kill Rock Stars. She recorded the album in 1997 whilst taking a break from Bikini Kill. Hanna recalled:

She cited two albums, &quot;Girl Talk&quot; by Lesley Gore and &quot;Delete Yourself&quot; by Atari Teenage Riot, among the inspirations for hers. In addition to feminism, it touches upon crocheting, aerobics and resisting police abuse. It was mostly produced in Hanna&#x27;s apartment in Olympia, Washington. She declared:

Hanna started collaborating with her friends Sadie Benning and Johanna Fateman to create a live band to perform songs from the album. This group would go on to become Le Tigre.

In December 2010, Hanna and former Bikini Kill bandmate Kathi Wilcox formed a band called the Julie Ruin.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the &quot;charmingly unruly jumble of sounds and influences: the cheesy tick of a drum machine up against the manic buzz of electric guitar, the frenzied spirit of punk overlapping the demure coo of 60&#x27;s girl groups.&quot;

==Track listing==
==Samples==
*&quot;I Wanna Know What Love Is&quot; samples &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; by the Clash.
*&quot;Stay Monkey&quot; samples &quot;I&#x27;m Coolin&#x27;, No Foolin&quot;&#x27; by Lesley Gore.
*&quot;Breakout A-Town&quot; samples &quot;It&#x27;s All I Can Do&quot; by the Cars.
*&quot;Love Letter&quot; samples &quot;I&#x27;m So Bored with the USA&quot; by the Clash.

<doc id="1209676" wikidata="Q4943587" url="?curid=1209676" title="Marion Crawford">
<text>Marion Kirk Buthlay CVO (née Crawford; 5 June 1909 – 11 February 1988) was a Scottish educator and governess to Princess Margaret and Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II). Known then by her maiden name, Elizabeth and Margaret affectionately called her Crawfie. Crawford worked for the Royal Family from 1933 to 1949. Upon her departure, she agreed to author &quot;The Little Princesses&quot;, a book which told the story of her time with the family. Though given tentative approval by the royal family to publish anonymously, Crawford was completely ostracised by them after her writing appeared under her name; she left Nottingham Cottage, her grace and favour house, and no member of the family ever spoke to her again.

==Early life and royal governess==
Crawford was born the daughter of a mechanical engineer&#x27;s clerk, at Gatehead, East Ayrshire, on 5 June 1909. She was raised in Dunfermline, Fife, and taught at Edinburgh&#x27;s Moray House Institute. While studying to become a child psychologist, she took a summer job as the governess for Lord Elgin&#x27;s children. This led her to take a role in the household of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth), as the Duchess was a distant relative of Lord Elgin. After one year the arrangement was made permanent.

Crawford became one of the governesses of Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. Following the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936, the Duke of York ascended the throne as King George VI, and Elizabeth became the heir presumptive. Crawford remained in service to the King and Queen, and did not retire until Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage in 1947, Crawford herself had married two months earlier. Crawford had already delayed her own marriage for 16 years so as not to, as she saw it, abandon the King and Queen.

==Retirement and authorship==
Upon her retirement in 1948, Crawford was given Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, as a grace and favour home. Queen Mary, the princesses&#x27; grandmother, also provided it with antique furniture and flower prints as a mark of her appreciation.

After their wedding, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh conducted an overseas tour, visiting Canada and the United States of America. Shortly afterwards, Bruce and Beatrice Gould, editors of the large circulation American magazine &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, contacted Buckingham Palace and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to seek stories for publication across the Atlantic. Although the approach was refused by the Palace, the British government proved keen on the idea and suggested Marion Crawford, as the recently retired governess of the princesses.

In April 1949, having heard of the offer, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wrote to Crawford, saying: I do feel, most definitely, that you should not write and sign articles about the children, as people in positions of confidence with us must be utterly oyster. If you, the moment you finished teaching Margaret, started writing about her and Lilibet, well, we should never feel confidence in anyone again. However, the Queen did give a carefully qualified approval for her to anonymously provide some assistance, writing: Mr [Dermot] Morrah (the man chosen to write the articles), who I saw the other day, seemed to think that you could help him with his articles and get paid from America. This would be quite all right as long as your name did not come into it. Nevertheless, I do feel most strongly that you must resist the allure of American money and persistent editors and say No No No to offers of dollars for articles about something as private and as precious as our family.

However, the contract with the Goulds stipulated: &quot;You will further consider publication of the articles without Her Majesty&#x27;s consent (possibly with only the consent of Princess Elizabeth, or no consent) and under your own name, on terms to be arranged.&quot;

In October 1949, Lady Astor sent a copy of the manuscript from the Goulds to Queen Elizabeth for her approval. The Queen was deeply distressed, finding it shockingly frank, especially Crawford&#x27;s revelations of the King&#x27;s moods and the Queen&#x27;s chilly relationship with Wallis Simpson. She replied to Lady Astor saying: &quot;The governess has gone off her head&quot;, and had her private secretary send a further letter to Lady Astor. This contained the Queen&#x27;s annotations on the manuscript with the request that passages of particular concern be removed. The Goulds were taken aback as they considered the account sympathetic, but they kept the response from Crawford. As the first servant to cash in on the private lives of the royals, Crawford was ostracised by the royal family, and they never spoke to her again. So deep was the feeling of betrayal within the royal family that, for years afterward, servants who spoke publicly for money were said to be &quot;doing a Crawfie&quot;.

Crawford&#x27;s unauthorised work was published in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Own&quot; in the UK and in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in the United States, becoming a sensation on both sides of the Atlantic. A book, &quot;The Little Princesses&quot;, also sold exceptionally well. Later she wrote stories about Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She also put her name to &quot;Woman&#x27;s Own&quot;″s &quot;Crawfie&#x27;s Column&quot;, a social diary written by journalists several weeks in advance. In 1955, one column contained a reference to the Trooping the Colour ceremony and the Ascot races, when in fact they had been cancelled that year because of a national railway strikes. As the stories were written in advance, it was too late to stop their publication, and the truth behind the column was unspooled, leading to her public disgrace.

==Later life and death==
Courtiers believed that Crawford was deeply under the influence of her husband George Buthlay, whom she married after her retirement, and that he pressured her to capitalise on her royal connections, as he himself did. Buthlay boasted of it in his business transactions, and had her ask the royal family to change their bank account to Drummonds, the bank for which he worked.

Crawford retired to Aberdeen, buying a house from the road to Balmoral; she completely withdrew from public life and refused all media requests. Although the royal family regularly drove past her front door on their way to Balmoral Castle, they never visited. When her husband died in 1977, she descended into depression and attempted suicide, leaving a note saying: &quot;The world has passed me by and I can&#x27;t bear those I love to pass me by on the road.&quot;

Crawford died at Hawkhill House (a nursing home in Aberdeen) on 11 February 1988. Neither the Queen, the Queen Mother nor Princess Margaret sent a wreath to her funeral.

Her story was featured in a 2000 Channel 4 documentary &quot;The Nanny Who Wouldn&#x27;t Keep Mum&quot;.

In 2021, Crawford was the focus of a novel by Tessa Arlen, &quot;In Royal Service to the Queen: A Novel of the Queen&#x27;s Governess&quot;. ISBN 978-0593102480.

<text>Ernest Sykes VC (4 April 1885 – 3 August 1949) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==VC action==
Sykes was 32 years old, and a private in the 27th (Service) Battalion (4th Tyneside Irish), Northumberland Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917 near Arras, France, for which he was awarded the VC. His battalion in attack was held up by intense fire from front and flank, and suffered heavy casualties. Private Sykes, despite this heavy fire, went forward and brought back four wounded. He then made a fifth journey and remained out under conditions which appeared to be certain death, until he had bandaged all those too badly injured to be moved.

His VC citation reads: 
During the Second World War Sykes returned to serve with the 25th Battalion West Riding Home Guard.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Fusiliers Museum of Northumberland, Alnwick, Northumberland, England.

==Commemoration==
In 1920 the London and North Western Railway named &quot;Claughton&quot;-class locomotive No. 2035 &#x27;Private E. Sykes, V.C.&#x27; in his honour. This locomotive was rebuilt in 1933 as a 4-6-0 class 6P5F Patriot class with the LMS number 5537 (Later renumbered, by British Railways, as 45537), retaining the name Private E. Sykes, V.C. until withdrawn from service and scrapped in 1962. The brass nameplate from the locomotive is on display at the Northumberland Fusiliers&#x27; Museum at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland.

Sykes is honoured by a Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council blue plaque erected in 1996 at the George Lawton Hall in his home town of Mossley, Greater Manchester. A second plaque was erected in 2004 at his workplace of Mossley railway station.

<text>Estelle Bennett (July 22, 1941 – February 11, 2009) was an American singer. She was a member of the girl group the Ronettes, along with her sister Ronnie and cousin Nedra Talley.

== Early life ==
Bennett and her sister, Veronica (later known as Ronnie Bennett and Ronnie Spector), were raised in New York City. They were children of an Irish father and African-American/Cherokee mother; they said they were bullied at school because of being light-skinned African Americans. Bennett attended George Washington High School in Manhattan where she was valedictorian. Studious and interested in fashion, she studied at Manhattan&#x27;s Fashion Institute of Technology.

== Career ==

When Bennett was 14, she and her sister Ronnie, and their cousin Nedra Talley started singing together. After a number of unsuccessful attempts, the trio reinvented themselves as the Ronettes. Signed up by 23-year-old Phil Spector, Ronnie became lead, with Estelle and Nedra as backing. They would eventually have a No.1 hit song in 1963, &quot;Be My Baby&quot;.

The Ronettes broke up in 1966. Bennett recorded a single in 1968 for Laurie Records, &quot;The Year 2000/The Naked Boy&quot;. In 1969, now known as Estal Bond she fronted The Love Chain, a quartet that also featured Laura Logan, Ann Trip and Cookie Woodson. They recorded three 45&#x27;s but only the Teddy Vann produced &#x27;I&#x27;m Lovin&#x27; You Baby&#x27; released on Minit made any headway. The Love Chain had finished by 1971 and Estelle moved on to further projects. In 1972, Ronnie invited Estelle to her apartment to rehearse when Ronnie was trying to revive the Ronettes. Unfortunately the rehearsal was a failure. Ronnie stated that Estelle had &quot;lost her coordination&quot; and said that it was &quot;bizarre.&quot; Also in 1972, she recorded the songs &quot;Baby With No Name&quot; and &quot;Earthman&quot; with the band 1984. Estelle Bennett rarely performed in public from then on, largely quitting the music business.

In 2007, when the Ronettes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it was decided that she was too fragile to perform with them. She spoke two brief sentences during her acceptance speech: &quot;I would just like to say, thank you very much for giving us this award. I&#x27;m Estelle of the Ronettes, thank you.&quot; She did, however, come back onstage for a final bow with the other Ronettes after the performance of &quot;Be My Baby&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
She married the group&#x27;s road manager, Joe Dong; the couple had a daughter. Her mental health deteriorated in the following years. It was reported that, during a visit to fellow former Ronette, Nedra Talley, she slept through her own baby daughter&#x27;s crying. She was reported to have had periods of homelessness, during which she would approach strangers in the streets of New York, telling people that she would be singing with the Ronettes in a jazz club.

Bennett died of colon cancer, aged 67, at her home in Englewood, New Jersey. Her body was discovered on February 11, 2009. A week after her death, it was revealed that she had anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia in the years after the Ronettes&#x27; breakup and that she had subsequently been homeless in New York City.

<text>Nedra Talley (born January 27, 1946), now known as Nedra Talley-Ross, is a retired American singer. She is best known as a former member of the girl group the Ronettes, in which she performed with her cousins Ronnie and Estelle Bennett. Since Ronnie&#x27;s death in 2022, Talley is the last surviving original member of the group.

== Career ==
In 1967, Talley and Estelle Bennett left the Ronettes, a decade after the group&#x27;s formation. The split was reportedly due in part to interference from the group&#x27;s producer Phil Spector, who later married Ronnie Bennett. Talley said that when she met Scott Ross, her future husband, she became a born-again Christian. Talley also decided to leave the Ronettes because she felt there was little place for Christian-inspired music.

In 1977, Talley recorded several Christian songs written by her church&#x27;s music director, Ted Sandquist. These were released on the album &quot;The Courts of the King: The Worship Music of Ted Sandquist&quot;. One of the cuts, a medley, &quot;Love of My Lord&quot; / &quot;Redwood Tree&quot; was released as a 45 promo single. Guitarist Phil Keaggy played on at least two of the album cuts with her. For its 30th anniversary, this album was finally released on CD.

In 1978, Talley recorded &quot;Full Circle&quot;, a solo contemporary Christian music album, on which Keaggy once again musically backed her. Keaggy wrote the title track and released his own version of it on his 1981 album &quot;Town To Town&quot;. The album was produced by Talley&#x27;s husband, Ross. The album&#x27;s inner sleeve featured Talley&#x27;s bio (and salvation story), but also a photo taken in the mid-&#x27;60s aboard a plane with Talley and fellow Ronette, Estelle Bennett, sharing seats with The Beatles&#x27; John Lennon and George Harrison, who were great fans of the Ronettes. The album has to date, never been re-released.

A four-disc set, Roger McGuinn&#x27;s &quot;The Folk Den Project (1995–2005)&quot;, featured the old folk song, &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd&quot;, as sung by McGuinn with Talley providing the sole but prominent background vocal.

In 2007, the Ronettes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

== Personal life ==
Talley is of black, Native American, Irish, and Puerto Rican descent. Her husband was Scott Ross (1939–2023), a former DJ turned interviewer for &quot;The 700 Club&quot; on the Christian Broadcasting Network. They have four children. As of 2007, she was a businesswoman working in real estate. She lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

<doc id="1209692" wikidata="Q1050831" url="?curid=1209692" title="We Can Work It Out">
<text>&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon. It was first issued as a double A-side single with &quot;Day Tripper&quot; in December 1965. The song was recorded during the sessions for the band&#x27;s &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album. The single reached number one in Britain (where it won the Ivor Novello Award for the top-selling A-side of 1965), the United States, Australia, Canada, and Ireland. In the UK, it was the seventh highest selling single of the 1960s.

&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; is a comparatively rare example of a Lennon–McCartney collaboration from this period in the Beatles&#x27; career, in that the two songwriters worked together as they had when writing the group&#x27;s early hit singles of 1963. &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;, are among the other notable exceptions to this trend from the group&#x27;s later career.

==Composition==

McCartney wrote the words and music to the verses and the chorus, with lyrics that &quot;might have been personal&quot;, probably relating to his relationship with actress Jane Asher. McCartney then presented the song to Lennon, who contributed the bridge:


With its intimations of mortality, Lennon&#x27;s contribution to the twelve-bar bridge contrasts typically with what he saw as McCartney&#x27;s cajoling optimism, a contrast also seen in other collaborations by the pair, such as &quot;Getting Better&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;. As Lennon told &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1980:

In author Ian MacDonald&#x27;s view, some critics have overemphasised the extent of McCartney&#x27;s optimism in the song and neglect the urgency in passages written by McCartney, such as the line &quot;Do I have to keep on talking until I can&#x27;t go on?&quot; Lennon&#x27;s middle shifts focus from McCartney&#x27;s concrete reality in D Mixolydian to a philosophical perspective in B minor. The waltz-like passage suggested by Harrison that leads back to the verse is possibly meant to suggest tiresome struggle. Rather than a formal change to time, the waltz effect is created by the use of quarter note triplets within the regular rhythm.

MacDonald comments on the song:

==Recording==

The Beatles recorded &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; at EMI Studios (later Abbey Road Studios) in London on 20 October 1965, during the sessions for their &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album. Along with Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, the song was earmarked for a non-album single that would accompany the release of the new LP. The band taped a satisfactory basic track in just two takes. With nearly eleven hours dedicated to the song, however, it was by far their longest expenditure of studio time up to that point. A vocal overdubbing session took place on 29 October.

No record exists of the band members&#x27; exact contributions to the recording, leading to uncertainty regarding the playing of some of the instruments. Reduced to a single track in the final mix, where it was placed hard left in the stereo image, the group&#x27;s initial performance consisted of acoustic guitar, bass, tambourine and drums. While musicologist Walter Everett credits these parts to Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Ringo Starr, respectively, authors Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin suggest that McCartney, as the song&#x27;s main composer, was the acoustic guitarist and Lennon instead played bass. Two harmonium parts were overdubbed, using EMI&#x27;s Mannborg harmonium.

==Promotional films==
For the first time for one of their singles, the Beatles filmed promotional clips for &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; and &quot;Day Tripper&quot;. Subsequently, known as the &quot;Intertel Promos&quot;, these clips were intended as a way to save the band having to appear in person on popular British television shows such as &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and also ensured that the Beatles reached their large international audience.

Filming took place at Twickenham Studios in Twickenham, London on 23 November 1965, with Joe McGrath as director. The Beatles made a total of ten black-and-white videos that day, filming clips for the new songs as well as for their previous hit singles &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot; Three of the films were mimed performances of &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, in all of which Lennon was seated at a harmonium.

The most frequently broadcast of the three was a straightforward performance piece with the group wearing black suits. In the description of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Rob Sheffield: &quot;At first, they&#x27;re playing it all straight in their suits, until John sets out to make Paul crack up on camera. He makes it impossible for anyone else to keep a straight face – by the end, he&#x27;s playing the organ with his feet.&quot; Another clip shows the group wearing the stage suits from their Shea Stadium performance on 15 August. The third clip opens with a still photograph of Lennon with a sunflower in front of his eye.

One of the November 1965 promo films was included in the Beatles&#x27; 2015 video compilation &quot;1&quot;, and the third promo clip was included in the three-disc versions of the compilation, titled &quot;1+&quot;.

==Release==
In a discussion about which of the two songs should be the A-side of the new single, Lennon had argued for &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, differing with the majority view that &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; was more commercial. On 15 November, EMI announced that the A-side would be &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, only for Lennon to publicly contradict this two days later. As a result, the single was marketed as a &quot;double A-side&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s championing of &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, for which he was the principal writer, was based on his belief that the Beatles&#x27; rock sound should be favoured over the softer style of &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;. Airplay and point-of-sale requests soon proved &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; to be the more popular of the two sides.

The single was released on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label in Britain (as Parlophone R 5389) on 3 December 1965, the same day as &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. The two releases coincided with speculation in the UK press that the Beatles&#x27; supremacy in the pop world since 1963 might be coming to an end, given the customary two or three years that most acts could expect to remain at the peak of their popularity. &quot;Day Tripper&quot; / &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart (at the time, the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart) on 15 December, at number 2, before holding the top position for five consecutive weeks. The single also failed to top the national chart published by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in its first week – marking the first occasion since December 1963 that a new Beatles single had not immediately entered at number 1. Although the single was an immediate number 1 on the &quot;NME&quot;″s chart, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspapers both published articles highlighting the apparent decline of the band&#x27;s chart success. 

The record was the Beatles&#x27; ninth consecutive chart-topping single in the UK and the band&#x27;s fastest-selling single there since &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, their previous McCartney-led A-side. At the following year&#x27;s Ivor Novello Awards, &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; was acknowledged as the best-selling single of 1965, ahead of &quot;Help!&quot; By November 2012, it had sold 1.39 million copies in the UK, making it the group&#x27;s fifth million-seller in that country. As of December 2018, the double A-side was the 54th best-selling single of all time in the UK – one of six Beatles songs included on the top sales rankings published by the Official Charts Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers/OCC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, where the single was issued by Capitol Records on 6 December (as Capitol 5555), both songs entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on the week ending 18 December. &quot;Record World&quot; reviewed the single and said that &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; &quot;will fascinate teens with its change of pace 4/4-3/4 timing and potent lyric.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; called the song &quot;a rhythmic, medium-paced affair about a determined fella who is sure that he can solve his romantic problems.&quot; On 8 January 1966, &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; hit number one on the chart, while &quot;Day Tripper&quot; entered the top ten at number 10. &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; spent three non-consecutive weeks at number 1, while &quot;Day Tripper&quot; peaked at number 5. The song was the band&#x27;s eleventh US number one, accomplished in just under two years since their debut on the Hot 100. It was their sixth consecutive number 1 single on the American charts, a record at the time. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, for sales of 1 million or over, on 6 January 1966.

Author Andrew Grant Jackson writes that the Beatles&#x27; six US chart-toppers over the year from January 1965 reflected the nation&#x27;s changing mood with regard to the Vietnam War and youth-driven social upheaval. With &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, he continues, the Beatles conveyed the &quot;fussing and fighting&quot; that had replaced the post-Kennedy rebirth of optimism from the start of the year. The song was referenced by Cecil Kellaway&#x27;s character in the 1967 film &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, which focused on the then-controversial issue of interracial relationships.

The Beatles performed &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; on their final UK tour, which took place on 3–12 December 1965. In 1991, McCartney played an acoustic version of the song for his &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance, later released on &quot;Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)&quot;, and &quot;The Unplugged Collection, Volume One&quot;.

==Cover versions==
===Deep Purple===

Deep Purple covered &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; on their 1968 album &quot;The Book of Taliesyn&quot;. The band drastically reworked it, as they always did with covers. The first three minutes of the song is a fast progressive rock instrumental incorporating themes from classical music (notably Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;) called &quot;Exposition&quot;, which drifts over into the Beatles song.

Deep Purple had followed the same structure on their covers on their debut album &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot;, such as The Leaves&#x27; &quot;Hey Joe&quot;. Reportedly, the band recorded their version of the song because McCartney had stated that he was impressed with their cover of &quot;Help!&quot;.

===Stevie Wonder===

In 1970, Stevie Wonder covered the song on his album &quot;Signed, Sealed &amp; Delivered&quot;, and released it as a single in 1971. The single reached number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Wonder&#x27;s version earned him his fifth Grammy Award nomination in 1972, for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. &quot;Cash Box&quot; described this version as a &quot;spectacular dance track&quot; which &quot;returns Wonder to his earlier straight-ahead teen self complete with harmonica solo.&quot;

Wonder performed the song for McCartney when the latter was presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. In 2010, when McCartney was awarded the Gershwin Prize by the Library of Congress, Wonder again performed his arrangement of &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; at a White House ceremony held in McCartney&#x27;s honour. Wonder performed it a third time in January 2014, at the 50th anniversary tribute of the Beatles&#x27; first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

===Other artists===
In his discussion of the various cover versions of &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, John Kruth describes Petula Clark&#x27;s recording, released on her 1966 album &quot;My Love&quot;, as &quot;too perky for its own good&quot;. He highlights Humble Pie&#x27;s blues version, from their 1975 album &quot;Street Rats&quot;, as a &quot;bold&quot; reading in which the band dispensed with the song&#x27;s melody to fashion &quot;a worried blues ... more Sonny Boy Williamson than Fab Four&quot;.

In 1976, the song was the Four Seasons&#x27; contribution to the soundtrack of &quot;All This and World War II&quot;, a musical documentary that author Nicholas Schaffner described as &quot;the most bizarre&quot; of several film and television works that capitalised on EMI, now free of its contractual obligations to the Beatles, flooding the market with re-packaged Beatles singles. Schaffner included this heavily orchestrated version, produced by Lou Reizner, among the interpretations that &quot;[succeed] in making Lennon–McCartney&#x27;s greatest songs sound, at best, like the Beatles&#x27; rendition of &#x27;Good Night&#x27;&quot;. 

Other artists who have covered the song include Dionne Warwick, Valerie Simpson, Melanie, Chaka Khan (on the album What Cha&#x27; Gonna Do for Me), Maxine Brown, Brass Construction, King Missile, Johnny Mathis, Judy Collins, Big Youth, Tesla, Plain White T&#x27;s, Tom Jones, Heather Nova, Steel Pulse, and Rick Wakeman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
According to Walter Everett, the line-up of musicians on the Beatles&#x27; recording was as follows:

*Paul McCartney – double-tracked lead vocal, bass guitar
*John Lennon – harmony vocal, acoustic guitar, harmonium
*George Harrison – tambourine
*Ringo Starr – drums

In his personnel list for the song, MacDonald notes that some sources attribute the tambourine part to Harrison, yet he considers it more likely that Starr played the instrument. Everett credits Harrison, citing the tambourine&#x27;s placement in the stereo image with the three other instruments recorded as part of the basic track. Guesdon and Margotin also credit Harrison.

<text>William Henry Thomas Sylvester VC (16 April 1831 – 13 March 1920) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Sylvester was 24 years old, and an assistant surgeon in the 23rd Regiment of Foot (later The Royal Welch Fusiliers), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 8 September 1855, at Sebastopol, Crimea, near the Redan, Assistant Surgeon Sylvester went with a corporal (Robert Shields) to the aid of an officer who was mortally wounded and remained with him, dressing his wounds, in a most dangerous and exposed situation. Again, on 18 September this officer was at the front, under heavy fire, attending the wounded.

<text>John Floyd (1572 – 15 September 1649) was an English Jesuit, known as a controversialist. He is known under the pseudonyms Daniel à Jesu, Hermannus Loemelius, and George White (also Annosus Fidelis Verimentanus, Flud, and the initials J. R.) under which he published.

He was known both as a preacher and teacher, and was frequently arrested in England.

==Life==
He was a brother of Henry Floyd, and was born in Cambridgeshire in 1572. After studying in the school of the English Jesuits at Eu, Normandy, he was admitted on 17 March 1588 to the English College, Reims, where he studied humanities and philosophy. Next he went to the English College, Rome, admitted there 9 October 1590, and joined the Society of Jesus on 1 November 1592.

On 18 August 1593 Floyd received minor orders, at Reims or Douai, and on the 22nd of the same month he was sent back to the English College at Rome with nine companions, where he taught philosophy and theology, and became known as a preacher. In 1609 he became a professed father of the Jesuit order.

He worked for a long time on the English mission. Having visited Edward Oldcorne in Worcester gaol in 1606, he was detained, and he was unable either by entreaties or bribes to escape Sir John Popham. After a year&#x27;s imprisonment he was sent into exile with forty-six other priests, and he spent four years in preaching at St. Omer and composing controversial works. Then he returned to England, where he was often captured, and frequently contrived to pay off the pursuivants.

His last years were spent at Leuven, where he was professor of theology. He died suddenly at St. Omer on 15 September 1649.

==Works==
Floyd wrote the following works, some of which appeared under pseudonyms:

* &quot;The Overthrow of the Protestants Pulpit-Babels, convincing their Preachers of Lying and Rayling, to make the Church of Rome seeme mysticall Babell&quot; [St. Omer], 1612.

<text>Sertanense Futebol Clube (), formerly Sertanense Foot-ball Club, is a Portuguese football club based in Sertã. Founded in 1934, it currently plays in the Campeonato de Portugal, holding home games at &quot;Campo de Jogos Dr. Marques dos Santos&quot;.

==History==
The largest sports club of Sertã after Vitória de Sernache, in the Castelo Branco district, Sertanense was founded by Casimiro Farinha on February 17, 1934, eventually resorting exclusively to football, after devoting most of its energy to sport fishing, collecting some national trophies.

Twice district champion, in 1998 and 2000, it first reached the third level of national football in 2009. That summer, former Portugal U-20 goalkeeper José Bizarro – winner of the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship – took charge of the team. In that and the previous season&#x27;s domestic cup, the club faced first division club FC Porto, being ousted 0–4 on both occasions (one at home).

<text>The Poem of the End (, &#x27;poema kontsa&#x27;) is the name of two poems by Russian poets of the early 20th century.

Poem of the End (usually given in English without an article) is the best known poem by Russian poet Vasilisk Gnedov. One of the most radically experimental poets of Russian Futurism, Gnedov&#x27;s Poem of the End consisted of its title alone on a blank page. Gnedov would perform the poem on stage using a silent gesture. The collection from which it came, Death to Art (1913), contained fifteen very short poems that gradually reduced in size from one line, to one word, one letter, and ultimately to Poem of the End. The poem has been compared to Kazimir Malevich&#x27;s painting Black Square (1915), John Cage&#x27;s silent composition 4&#x27;33&quot; (1952), and to Minimalism in general. A &quot;recreation&quot; of the performance of the poem was realized in 2007 by Miguel Molina, and released on cd by Recommended Records (ReR Megacorp) in a limited edition of 150 in 2009. The recording for the cd consists of approximately one hour of &quot;silence&quot; as captured via a wax cylinder, a recording device appropriate to the time.

The Poem of the End (with &quot;The&quot; in the title) is a major poem by the White Russian symbolist poet Marina Tsvetaeva. 
Written in Prague in 1924, the poem details the end of a passionate affair with Konstantin Boeslavovich Rozdevitch, a former military officer. Each of the sections deals with the crossing of a bridge and the symbolism is echoed relentlessly throughout the poem; the mood is unremittingly tense and foreboding.

:Lovers for the most
:part are without hope: passion
:also is just
:a bridge, a means of connection

(from the Elaine Feinstein translation).

:The happy lot
:Of lovers without hope:
:Bridge, you are like passion:
:A convention: pure transition.
(from the Nina Kossman translation)</text><links>

<text>William John Symons, VC (10 July 1889 – 24 June 1948) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 26 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion, (Victoria), Australian Imperial Force during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 8–9 August 1915, at Lone Pine, Gallipoli, Turkey, Symons was in command of a section of newly captured trenches and repelled several counter-attacks with great coolness. An enemy attack on an isolated sap early in the morning resulted in six officers becoming casualties and part of the sap being lost, but Symons retook it, shooting two Turks. The sap was then attacked from three sides and this officer managed, in the face of heavy fire, to build a barricade. On the enemy setting fire to the head cover, he extinguished it and rebuilt the barricade. His coolness and determination finally compelled the enemy to withdraw.

On 2 February 1916, Lt. Col. (later Major-General) Harold &quot;Pompey&quot; Elliott, commanding the 7th Battalion, wrote to his wife Kate about the action at Lone Pine when the 7th won four Victoria Crosses, including Symons. He describes the infiltration of the Australian trenches by the attacking Turks and the exchange of shots and grenades. Captain Bastin was shot through the arm and stretchered out of the trench but the Turks entered the trench a second time. Elliott writes that when the Australian&#x27;s waivered he got together a few fresh men and placed Symons in charge with the order to charge the Turks at bayonet point. In a trench described as being full of dead men, blood and brains, Symons succeeded to Elliott&#x27;s admiration.

Even though Elliot promoted the bravery of his men, he was concerned about being overlooked for his promotion and awards. Whilst on English convalescence leave an interested King George V presented Symons with his VC. Symons told the King about the action and the award of four Victoria Crosses. During the conversation he asked why Elliott has never been even mentioned in dispatches after being through the Gallipoli campaign and been wounded. The King&#x27;s secretary took Elliot&#x27;s name and in his letter to Kate, on 18 February 1916, Elliott announced his promotion to Brigadier-General.

Symons later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel during the Second World War.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, Australia.

<doc id="1209722" wikidata="Q6319948" url="?curid=1209722" title="Jämtland Ranger Corps">
<text>The Jämtland Ranger Corps (, JFK), is a Swedish Army infantry unit that operated in various forms during the years 1670–1983, 1990–1997, 2000–2005 and 2021–present. The unit was and is located in Östersund Garrison in Östersund.

== History ==
The regiment had its origin in &quot;Ångermanlands, Medelpads och Jämtlands regemente&quot; raised in 1646 in the newly conquered province Jämtland, although the men were mostly recruited in the old Swedish provinces of Ångermanland and Medelpad. The regiment was also called &quot;Thomas Gärffelts regemente&quot; after its first commander.

The regiment was disbanded in 1661 as the recruitment provinces were transferred to the navy. But some companies of the regiment did exist until 1670, when they were incorporated in the newly raised &quot;Jämtlands regemente till fot&quot; (or &quot;Anders Plantings regemente&quot;). From 1689 on, the regiment was named &quot;Jämtlands dragonregemente&quot;, but had only one company of cavalry troops. This company was later organized into Norrland Dragoon Regiment.

The regiment was renamed &quot;Jämtlands infanteriregemente&quot; in 1770 before gaining the present name in 1820. The regiment also had the name &quot;Jämtlands fältjägarkår&quot; a short period between 1853 and 1892. &quot;Jämtlands fältjägarregemente&quot; was garrisoned in Östersund and was given the designation I 23 (23rd Infantry Regiment) after a general order in 1816. This was changed to I 5 in 1927. For a short time in the 1990s, the regiment was merged with the mobilization unit &quot;Fältjägarbrigaden&quot; before being reorganized in 2000 back to a separate existence as &quot;Jämtlands fältjägarregemente&quot;. The regiment ceased training conscripts in 2004, and was completely disbanded by August 2006.

==Barracks and training areas==

===Barracks===
Between 21 December 1687 and 15 August 1926, the regiment was trained at Frösö military camp. On 7 October 1905, the regiment&#x27;s schools were moved to the &quot;Gamla skolan&quot; (&quot;Old School&quot;) (&quot;Västra skolan&quot;, &quot;Western School&quot;) at Rådhusgatan 44. In the autumn of 1910, the regiment moved into a newly established barracks at Fältjägargränd 13. The barracks were drawn by Erik Josephson, and was built after the 1901 military order&#x27;s building program after &quot;Fortifikationen&quot;″s design for infantry barracks. On 8 April 1911, the regiment commemorated the moving to Östersund through a moving ceremony. After the regiment was disbanded and commenced its decommissioning, the barracks area was left on 31 August 2006.

===Training areas===
From 1687 to 1926, the regiment was based and trained at Frösö military camp. The regiment later trained at Grytans training area. The administration of the training area was under Norrland Artillery Regiment (A 4). After Norrland Artillery Regiment was disbanded in 1997, Jämtland Ranger Regiment took over the responsibility of the administration.

<doc id="1209745" wikidata="Q7601054" url="?curid=1209745" title="Star Trek spin-off fiction">
<text>The &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise has produced a large number of novels, comic books, video games, and other materials, which are generally considered non-canon.

==Continuity==
&quot;Star Trek&quot; spin-off fiction frequently fills in &quot;gaps&quot; within the televised show, often making use of backstage information or popular fan belief. Although officially licensed spin-off material will often maintain continuity within itself (particularly within books by the same authors), elements often contradict each other irreconcilably. For example, the end of Kirk&#x27;s five-year mission has been depicted in several different incompatible ways.

Much fiction is set in a second five-year mission of Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which the Okuda chronology dates after &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (although novels often placed it before). Backstories and fates of characters are often elaborated on, an example being Leonard McCoy&#x27;s divorced status, and his daughter, Joanna, originally intended to appear in what became the &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;The Way to Eden&quot;.

Several original series characters are established as still being alive in the &quot;TNG&quot; era, including McCoy, Spock, and Scotty. In the books written by William Shatner, these are joined by a revived Captain Kirk. Several novels depict the careers of the younger members of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew after &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. Captain Sulu and his daughter Demora Sulu appear in Peter David&#x27;s novel &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In the novel &quot;The Sundered&quot;, Chekov serves as Sulu&#x27;s first officer on . The novel &quot;Federation&quot; has Chekov eventually becoming an admiral. Uhura is shown, in the novel &quot;Catalyst of Sorrows&quot;, to be Chief of Starfleet Intelligence in 2360. The 2006 novel &quot;Vulcan&#x27;s Soul: Exiles&quot; has an Admiral Pavel Chekov, and Uhura is still serving as head of Starfleet Intelligence in 2377, at the age of 138. Peter David&#x27;s novel &quot;Imzadi&quot; explores the backstory between Riker and Troi, and its sequel &quot;&quot; covers the cooling of the Worf/Troi relationship, which was left unexplained on screen.

Spin-off fiction will often use re-use characters who appeared only once or twice in the actual show. Dr. Selar has appeared in more &quot;TNG&quot; novels than television episodes, and she and Elizabeth Shelby, who appeared in the two-part episode &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; are major characters in the &quot;Star Trek: New Frontier&quot; series. The cast of the &quot;Starfleet Corps of Engineers&quot; series largely comes from such guest parts. Similarly, the &quot;IKS Gorkon&quot; series features Klingon characters drawn from a variety of &quot;TNG&quot; and &quot;DS9&quot; episodes.

The spin-off fiction has also engaged in world building. Novels in the 1980s by Diane Duane and John M. Ford established a complex backstory and culture for the Romulans (Rihannsu) and Klingons respectively, which were later not taken up by &quot;TNG&quot;.

==Technical and reference manuals==
A large range of fictional reference books have been produced over the years. More recent books of this sort have been by production staff and, whilst not binding on the series, nonetheless reflect the thinking of the production office, and are used as sourcebooks by writers.

==Prose fiction==
Since 1967, hundreds of original novels, short stories, and television and movie adaptations have been published. The first original &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel to be published was &quot;Mission to Horatius&quot; by Mack Reynolds, which was published in hardcover by Whitman Books in 1968. Geared for younger readers, the novel became a collectible and in the 1990s, Pocket Books issued a facsimile edition.

The first publisher of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fiction aimed at adult readers was Bantam Books, which initially produced a bestselling series of novelizations of the original 79 episodes by James Blish that began in 1967. Later adaptations were done by Blish&#x27;s wife, J. A. Lawrence, some of these were credited to Blish with others appearing under Lawrence&#x27;s name. In 1970, Blish wrote the first original novel published by Bantam, &quot;Spock Must Die!&quot;, although subsequent novels did not appear until 1976.

From 1974, Ballantine Books published a 10-volume series of novelizations based upon episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, all written by Alan Dean Foster. Bantam also published a number of fotonovels based on episodes. In the late 1970s, Bantam published a number of original &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels, including two written by noted science fiction author Joe Haldeman, and one by original series scriptwriter David Gerrold.

Pocket Books began publishing &quot;Star Trek&quot; fiction in 1979, starting with a novelization of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; by Gene Roddenberry himself, although the company&#x27;s second &quot;Trek&quot; novel did not appear until 1981 due to Bantam being allowed to complete its publishing contract first. Eventually, Pocket Books would publish novels based upon every &quot;Trek&quot; series.

From around 1987 and with the debut of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, Paramount took a closer role in supervising the books, disallowing story elements that were said to conflict with Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s idea of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In particular, recurring characters between books were discouraged, as was the use of concepts introduced in &quot;The Animated Series&quot;. This era saw disputes between authors and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; production office – specifically Roddenberry&#x27;s &quot;assistant&quot;, Richard Arnold – with many novels being rejected for not focusing directly on the main TOS cast. Some novels were, in lieu of rejection, heavily edited, resulting in being disowned publicly by their authors, such as with the novel &quot;Probe&quot; by Margaret Wander Bonanno.

A change of personnel at the &quot;Star Trek&quot; offices in the early 1990s – specifically the firing of Arnold immediately following the death of Gene Roddenberry in 1991 – led to a relaxation of policies regarding tie-in novels. Under editor John J. Ordover, many authors including Bonanno returned as &quot;Star Trek&quot; novelists in the 2000s after encouragement from fans, which continued under later editor Marco Palmieri, who has admitted being unaware of any prior blacklisting of authors resulting from the period of interference from Richard Arnold.

Prolific &quot;Star Trek&quot; novelists include Peter David, Diane Carey, Keith R.A. DeCandido, J.M. Dillard, Diane Duane, Michael Jan Friedman, and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. Several actors and writers from the television series have written books: William Shatner has written a series with the Reeves-Stevenses featuring a revived Captain Kirk in the 24th century, and John de Lancie, Andrew J. Robinson, J. G. Hertzler, and Armin Shimerman have written or co-written books featuring their respective characters. &quot;Voyager&quot; producer Jeri Taylor wrote two novels featuring backstory for &quot;Voyager&quot; characters, and screen authors David Gerrold, D. C. Fontana, and Melinda Snodgrass have also penned books. The Reeves-Stevenses were later hired as writers for &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

None of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels are considered &quot;canon&quot;, meaning that producers of the television series feel free to contradict events and facts from the novels (although Pocket Books coordinates with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; offices to minimize the chances of this happening). Paula Block, director of CBS Consumer Products, is quoted in &quot;Voyages of the Imagination&quot; as saying, &quot;Jeri Taylor&#x27;s books were considered quasi-canon for a while because our licensees really wanted some sort of background structure&quot;.

===New series===
Starting from the mid-1990s, several ranges of books were created based upon original continuing characters and situations set in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. The first of these, &quot;Star Trek: New Frontier&quot; by Peter David, focuses on the crew of the starship &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Some characters in this series were guest stars from episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, while others were from previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; titles by the same author, and still others were created originally for the series. &quot;New Frontier&quot; takes place in Sector 221-G, where the &quot;Excalibur&quot; is dispatched to help with the chaos created by the crumbling Thallonian Empire.

Michael Jan Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Stargazer&quot; series features the adventures of Captain Picard on the &quot;Stargazer&quot;, and reuses characters he established in his 1992 &quot;TNG&quot; novel &quot;Reunion&quot;.

Another series, &quot;Star Trek: Challenger&quot;, created by Pocket editor John J. Ordover and writer Diane Carey, was planned as a continuation of the six-book storyline &quot;Star Trek: New Earth&quot;. Thus far only one book in the series has been published, &quot;Chainmail&quot;, part of the &quot;Gateways&quot; crossover series.

The &quot;Starfleet Corps of Engineers&quot; series is a series of eBooks by various authors, set in the same general time frame as the &quot;Next Generation&quot; series. This series features a group of highly trained engineers stationed aboard and their adventures on various planets. The eBooks are eventually released in paperback collections. No new &quot;Corps of Engineers&quot; novels have been published since 2007.

From 2005 to 2012, a &quot;Star Trek: Vanguard&quot; series ran, set on Starbase 47, known as &quot;Vanguard&quot;. It is set during &quot;The Original Series&quot;, and attempts to flesh out that particular period of fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; history.

&quot;I.K.S. Gorkon&quot; was a brief series of novels by Keith R. A. DeCandido, the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel series to feature the Klingons instead of Starfleet. This series tells of the adventures of an all-new &quot;Qang&quot; (&quot;Chancellor&quot;)-class war cruiser, on a mission to conquer new planets for the Klingon Empire. The series grew from DeCandido&#x27;s TNG Ambassador Worf-focused novel &quot;Diplomatic Implausibility&quot;.

===Relaunch series===

Pocket Books has also depicted events after the end of television series, allowing greater freedom in storytelling.

The &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; relaunch takes place after the end of the series. New characters have been added to compensate for the loss of those who left at the end of the show. (Some books published after the end of the series, but before the official relaunch stories began, have been retroactively added to the relaunch, including the anthology &quot;The Lives of Dax&quot; and the novel &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot;.

The &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; relaunch series, written by Christie Golden, is set after the end of the &quot;Voyager&quot; series. In the final episode of the series, &quot;Endgame&quot;, the characters return home, and the books deal with their homecoming and further adventures.

After the release of the movie &quot;Star Trek Nemesis&quot;, which sees William Riker about to take command of a new ship, , the &quot;Star Trek: Titan&quot; series was launched, depicting these adventures. As of 2014, several books have been set post-&quot;Nemesis&quot;, including several books dealing with the Borg.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; series was also relaunched (see Star Trek: Enterprise relaunch), starting with the novel &quot;The Good That Men Do&quot;. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; novel &quot;Last Full Measure&quot; retcons the death of Trip, recounted in &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;. Trip&#x27;s death is shown in a holodeck program in the time frame of the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;The Pegasus&quot;, and &quot;The Good That Men Do&quot; establishes that the historical record has been altered.

Nine &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels, in the form of three thematic trilogies, have been written by William Shatner with Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. These novels, starting with the second book, feature a Captain Kirk revived after &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;. However, these novels are set in a different continuity to the rest of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels, receiving the nickname the Shatnerverse. A fourth Shatner/Reeves-Stevens trilogy, focusing on Kirk&#x27;s time at Starfleet Academy and based on an idea pitched to Paramount for a TV series was launched in October 2007.

===Crossover events===
The &quot;Star Trek&quot; book ranges have since the mid-1990s featured various crossover events, with books published in multiple series. The first of these was the &quot;Invasion!&quot; series, published in 1996, featuring entries from &quot;The Original Series&quot;, &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, and &quot;Voyager&quot; series.

1997&#x27;s event was the &quot;Day of Honor&quot;, with novels in all four series. In a rare example of a novel concept being adopted into the TV series, the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Day of Honor&quot; tied into this.

1998 saw six books published in the &quot;Star Trek: The Captain&#x27;s Table&quot; crossover, including the four regular series, as well as one from &quot;Star Trek: New Frontier&quot; and another based on Captain Pike, the captain from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot episode, &quot;The Cage&quot;. An anthology, entitled &quot;Tales from the Captain&#x27;s Table&quot;, was published in 2005 following up the concept, with tales from new captains.

1999&#x27;s &quot;Double Helix&quot; was a six-book series, nominally part of the numbered &quot;TNG&quot; book range, featuring characters from &quot;TNG&quot;, &quot;DS9&quot;, TOS, &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;New Frontier&quot;, and &quot;Stargazer&quot;.

The &quot;Star Trek: Gateways&quot; crossover was published in 2001, featuring entries from &quot;TOS&quot;, &quot;Challenger&quot;, &quot;TNG&quot;, &quot;DS9&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot;, and &quot;New Frontier&quot;. These stories all end in a single finale anthology, &quot;What Lay Beyond&quot;. 2001&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek: Section 31&quot; was a thematic crossover, with each of the four books (&quot;TOS&quot;, &quot;TNG&quot;, &quot;DS9&quot;, and &quot;Voyager&quot;) featuring Section 31. Later in 2014, &quot;Section 31&quot; became a standalone DS9 spinoff series of its own with the novel &quot;Disavowed&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Star Trek: The Lost Era&quot; began exploring the underutilized part of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; timeline between Kirk&#x27;s death in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; and the start of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

===Anthologies===
Anthologies &quot;Star Trek&quot; short fictionhave been published by Pocket Books. The &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; competition, open to entries from the public, runs annually, and results in the publication of an anthology featuring the winning short stories.

Pocket Books also published themed short story anthologies. 

*&quot;The Lives of Dax&quot; (1999, stories for each incarnation of Dax)
*&quot;Enterprise Logs&quot; (2000, a collection of stories about various captains of ships named &quot;Enterprise&quot;)
*&quot;No Limits&quot; (2002, a &quot;New Frontier&quot; anthology, featuring the first stories to focus on NF characters that were not written by Peter David)
*&quot;Prophecy and Change&quot; (2003, a 10th anniversary &quot;DS9&quot; anthology)
*&quot;Tales of the Dominion War&quot; (2004, featuring various characters and the Dominion War)
*&quot;Tales from The Captain&#x27;s Table&quot; (2005, featuring stories by new captains from the &quot;Captain&#x27;s Table&quot;)
*&quot;Distant Shores&quot; (2005, a 10th anniversary &quot;Voyager&quot; anthology)
*&quot;Constellations&quot; (2006, a 40th anniversary &quot;TOS&quot; anthology)
*&quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot;, (2007, a 20th anniversary &quot;TNG&quot; anthology)

===Status===
A small but vocal minority of fans consider the novels to be fan fiction, although, being publications authorized by Paramount Pictures, they do not fit the general definition. A number of novels have been written or co-written by series actors, such as John de Lancie, J. G. Hertzler, Andrew J. Robinson, William Shatner, and Armin Shimerman.

A number of unlicensed and usually privately-published works do fit the normal definition of fan fiction, such as Jean Airey&#x27;s &quot;The Doctor and the Enterprise&quot;, a novella-length work originally published as a stand-alone fanzine, and featuring a crossover with the Fourth Doctor from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. This also appear as a small circulation semi-pro publication labeled as a &quot;parody&quot;, presumably for legally reasons.

==Comics==
Almost continuously since 1967, a number of companies have published comic book series based on &quot;Star Trek&quot; and its spin-off series.

===Whitman 1967–1979===

====Gold Key====
The initial publisher of &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic adaptations and tie-in comics was Gold Key, part of Whitman Publishing. The series ran for 61 issues between July 1967 until March 1979, and is noted for the first nine issues of the series being published with photo covers, made up from promotional photographs supplied by Paramount, some of which were taken from various episodes of the original series.

Although Gold Key never gave creative credits in the pages of their comics, Len Wein, Arnold Drake, George Kashdan, Marty Pasko and Doug Drexler are known to have worked on numerous issues of the books, and have since come forth and identified which issues they specifically worked on. The first two issues of the Gold Key run was illustrated by Italian artist Nevio Zaccara, and the first half of the series was drawn by Alberto Giolitti, who being based in Rome did not see any of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV episodes until several years after he retired. The remainder of the series was illustrated by Alden McWilliams, with a few fill-ins by George Kashdan.

Gold Key and Whitman ceased publishing in 1979, with &quot;Star Trek&quot; No. 61 being one of the last comics produced by the company, and one issue in pre-production that never saw print.

====Enterprise Log Series====
Golden Press, another division of Western Publishing, reprinted several of the Gold Key &quot;Star Trek&quot; comics in four volumes. Entitled &quot;Enterprise Logs&quot;, these four books reprinted the first 35 issues between 1976 and 1977, and included some new material as part of a &quot;Psycho-Files&quot; feature in the first and third volumes.

====Dan Curtis====
In 1974, Dan Curtis produced a set of nine , 22-page color miniature comics. These were intended to be sold with bubble gum, like baseball cards, and each comic reprinted a story from one of the Gold Key comics. The set has been listed since 1977 as &quot;Dan Curtis Reprints&quot; in the &quot;Giveaway Comics&quot; section of Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide.

====Dynabrite====
Whitman also produced a series of 16 different comic reprints between 1978 and 1979 under the &quot;Dynabrite&quot; banner. These were 10&quot; x 7-1/8&quot; reprints of several of the Gold Key issues, with cardboard covers with blank inside covers.

====Gold Key Reprints====
In 2004, Checker Book Publishing Group was granted license from Paramount to reprint the Gold Key &quot;Star Trek&quot; comics in volumes under the name &quot;Star Trek: The Key Collection&quot;. Note that these new reprint editions do not contain the new material that was created especially for the previous &quot;Enterprise Log&quot; reprint editions, such as the &quot;Psycho-Files&quot; or &quot;Scotty&#x27;s Diary&quot;. As of May 2007, seven editions have been printed, with the eighth edition expected in 2010 but as of this writing had not been scheduled.

===UK newspaper strip===
A weekly strip ran in the United Kingdom from 1969 to 1973 in the pages of TV21. Added as part of a revamp of the popular British magazine by City Publications, the strip ran for 118 issues, ending with the December 29, 1973 issue. Creators for this strip included numerous artists who worked on other TV21 and Valiant Magazine strips, such as Harry Lindfield, Mike Noble, Roland Turner, Carlos Pino, and Jim Baikie.

===Marvel 1979–1982===
In 1979, with the launch of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, Marvel started publishing &quot;Star Trek&quot; comics, starting with an adaptation of that movie by Marv Wolfman and Dave Cockrum. Through a misunderstanding between Paramount and Marvel, the writers had been misinformed that they could not use any previously used characters from the TV series or the movie except for the main crew of the Enterprise. The series only lasted a total of 18 issues, ending in 1981 with Marvel choosing not to renew the license.

===Newspaper strip 1979–1983===
A newspaper strip, initially written and illustrated by Thomas Warkentin also ran from 1979 to 1983, and was syndicated by the &quot;Los Angeles Times Mirror Syndicate&quot;. Warkentin stayed with the series until April 1981, penning a total of eight tales. During his tenure, Warkentin was aided by artists Mark Rice, Dan Spiegle, and Ron Harris. Among the highlights of Wartenkin&#x27;s strips was his final story, a Harry Mudd adventure featuring his view of a rare glimpse at the news media of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. During the series remaining fifteen months, creative teams changed twice, beginning with writer Marty Pasko and artist Padraic Shigetani, with Bob Myers replacing Shigetani. The strip concluded with Gerry Conway and Dick Kulpa sharing writing credit, with Ernie Colón handling the art.

===DC Comics 1984–1996===

After the release of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, DC Comics became the &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic licensee, publishing stories from 1984 set in the movie era (see &quot;Star Trek DC comics&quot;). In 1988, the series ended when Paramount withdrew its license at the advice of Richard Arnold following a series of disputes between Arnold and DC Comics, specifically with the comic&#x27;s main author, Peter David. After a year&#x27;s hiatus DC&#x27;s second &quot;Star Trek&quot; series was launched with an adaptation of &quot;Star Trek V&quot;. Original stories took place in the large gap between &quot;Star Trek V&quot; and &quot;Star Trek VI&quot;, but did not continue from the previous series, so storylines from that series were either ignored or rewritten. Although more limited in scope than the first series due to restrictions from Paramount – which included a prohibition by Richard Arnold against the creation and use of original and non-series-related ongoing characters in the comic stories – and the controversial removal of Peter David as head writer, the series still lasted 80 issues. Howard Weinstein, who like David was also a &quot;Star Trek&quot; novelist, took over writing the comic with issue No. 20, and used the opportunity to flesh-out some of the changes between &quot;Star Trek V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;, such as Sulu&#x27;s promotion to captain of the &quot;Excelsior&quot;.

DC also published &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; comics, starting with a mini-series in 1988. An ongoing monthly series was launched from October 1989, and was mainly written by &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; novelist Michael Jan Friedman. The series would run until 1996, when DC chose not to renew the license due to declining sales and an increase in licensing fees from Paramount.

===Malibu 1993–1995===
Beginning in 1993, Malibu Comics published an ongoing series based upon &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Before DC Comics&#x27; relinquishing the license, Malibu and DC worked together to publish a DS9/TNG crossover comic. In addition, Malibu also published an annual and several one-shot special issues of the &quot;DS9&quot; comic, and reportedly was preparing a &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; comic that later saw print after the merger with Marvel Comics in 1996.

===Marvel 1996–1998===
As part of the merger with Malibu Comics in 1996, Marvel obtained the &quot;Star Trek&quot; license, publishing comics under the &quot;Marvel Paramount Comics&quot; banner. Helping to launch the franchise were the comic adaptation of the film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; and the one-shot crossover &quot;Star Trek/X-Men&quot;. The quarterly &quot;Star Trek Unlimited&quot; series covered &quot;TOS&quot; and &quot;TNG&quot;. Marvel published monthly comics based upon &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;. They also introduced two new series, &quot;Star Trek: Early Voyages&quot; which dealt with Captain Pike&#x27;s adventures as captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (as depicted in the rejected &quot;TOS&quot; pilot &quot;The Cage&quot;) and &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Academy&quot; which dealt with a group of cadets, including &quot;Deep Space Nine&#x27;s&quot; Ferengi, Nog. Finally, a five-issue limited series, &quot;Star Trek: Untold Voyages&quot;, followed Kirk on his second five-year mission following the events of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (similarly to the first Marvel series, but ignoring the original comics&#x27; stories). The ongoing series were canceled in 1998 due to sales being below expectations, with &quot;Early Voyages&quot; leaving an unresolved story by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning.

===Wildstorm 1999–2002===
Wildstorm were the next licensee. Wildstorm decided to not do an ongoing series, but instead a series of miniseries and trade paperback graphic novels from 1999 onwards. Writers included Nathan Archer, Kristine Kathryn Rusch and Dean Wesley Smith, Keith R.A. DeCandido. Scott Ciencin, Kevin J. Anderson, K. W. Jeter, John Ordover and David Mack. Due to poor sales and issues involving Wildstorm&#x27;s merger with DC Comics, the license was allowed to expire in 2002 without renewal.

===Tokyopop 2004–===
In October 2004, Tokyopop announced plans to publish an anthology of &quot;Next Generation&quot;-based stories presented in the style of Japanese manga. Since then, the company has produced several anthologies of Star Trek manga stories starting in 2006 with &quot;Shinsei Shinsei&quot;. The first two books contained five manga stories and a prose short story from a recently released anthology by Pocket Books, with Pocket printing a manga story in the respective anthology to cross promote both companies products. The third book featured four, slightly longer, manga stories and an extra from a recent Pocket anthology of short novels.

Tokyopop originally planned their first book to be a collection of tales in the Star Trek: The Next Generation era but at the bequest of Paramount they chose to develop a Star Trek: The Original Series book instead, to be released for The Original Series&#x27; 40th Anniversary. After publishing their third TOS manga book the company announced plans for two TNG anthologies in late 2008 and early 2009. The first TNG book was delayed and saw publication in April 2009.

===IDW Publishing===
On November 9, 2006, IDW Publishing announced that they had secured the publishing rights to Star Trek from CBS Consumer Products.

IDW&#x27;s first title was the six-issue miniseries, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, written by David Tischman and drawn by Casey Maloney. IDW followed up with the series &quot;Star Trek: Klingons: Blood Will Tell&quot;, along with other mini-series and one-shots, and is still regularly publishing new &quot;Star Trek&quot;-based material.

==Games==

===Star Fleet Universe===
Developed over the last two decades and more as an expansive development of the background as supplied in the &quot;Original Series&quot; as well as in &quot;The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual&quot;, the Star Fleet Universe introduces a range of new races and storylines (such as the Interstellar Concordium and the General War) as well as drawing from the Animated Series for inspiration – a modified version of the Kzinti are a major part of the SFU, for example – unlike the Paramount universe.

This universe lives and thrives in the range of works from Amarillo Design Bureau Inc. and (formerly) Task Force Games, as well as providing a fount for the unique merging of &quot;Star Trek&quot; continuities seen in the Star Fleet Command series of PC games.

SFU games include:

* Federation and Empire (1986)
* Federation Commander (2005)
* Prime Directive, 1993,
* GURPS Prime Directive, 2002, &lt;br&gt; Based on Prime Directive, but with the GURPS ruleset.
* D20 Prime Directive, 2005 &lt;br&gt; Based on Prime Directive, but with the D20 ruleset.
* Star Fleet Battles (1979)
* Star Fleet Battle Force

The following computer games used elements from both the Paramount and ADB universes:

* &quot;Starfleet Command&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Starfleet Command II: Empires at War&quot;
* &quot;Starfleet Command: Orion Pirates&quot;

==Theme parks==
* Star Trek: The Experience

Star Trek Adventure, Universal Studios Hollywood, 1988
: The Universal Studios Hollywood theme park featured a &quot;Star Trek&quot;-themed attraction. The attraction regularly selected 10 volunteers from the audience and placed them into a &quot;Star Trek&quot; story line. The participants were dressed in &quot;Star Trek&quot; costumes and placed on sets, and coached to deliver scripted dialogue in several scenes. The scenes, which were recorded on video by Lilly, were quickly edited into a short film, the storyline of which was loosely based around material from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films. The finished video was then shown to the audience, and the &quot;actors&quot; had the opportunity to purchase a copy of their video. This attraction closed after several years of operation. Several copies of these videos had been seen on YouTube.

Great American Adventure Amusement Park, Santa Clara near San Jose, Calif. 
: In the &#x27;80&#x27;s Paramount Pictures Inc. bought the theme park operating company, Great American Theme Parks. After this corporate owner&#x27;s change, the San Jose property added many major &quot;Star Trek&quot; elements to entertain the park&#x27;s patrons. There were several costumed &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters entertaining patrons near the large &quot;Star Trek&quot; transplanted movie sets brought up from the studio. A Klingon starship command bridge and other interior set elements along with other &quot;Star Trek&quot; sets were delivered and installed in this property. There were costumed &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters &#x27;meeting and greeting&#x27; the parks visitors.

==Fan productions==
Several fan-made or unofficial films have been produced, using &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters or settings. Notable examples include:

*&quot;Starship Exeter&quot;, made in the style of the 1960s original series and set on a sister ship of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.
*&quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot;, which depicts the fourth year of Kirk&#x27;s five-year mission. George Takei and Walter Koenig have made guest appearances, and D. C. Fontana, original series script editor and writer, has written an episode.
*&quot;Star Trek: Of Gods and Men&quot;, directed by Tim Russ and featuring many &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors, produced as a &quot;gift&quot; to the fans.

<text>Jean Audrey Knight (née Caliste; January 26, 1943 – November 22, 2023) was an American R&amp;B and soul singer from New Orleans, Louisiana. Launching her professional career in the mid-1960s, Knight was best known for her 1971 hit single &quot;Mr. Big Stuff&quot;, released by Stax Records.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Jean Audrey Caliste was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on January 26, 1943. After graduating from high school, she began singing at Laura&#x27;s Place, her cousin&#x27;s bar, and caught the attention of many different bands who were willing to accompany her. In 1965, she recorded a demo of a cover version of Jackie Wilson&#x27;s song &quot;Stop Doggin&#x27; Me Around&quot;. Her demo attracted record producer Huey Meaux, who signed her to a recording contract at the Jet Star/Tribe record labels. Shortly thereafter, she adopted the professional name of &quot;Jean Knight&quot;, because she felt that her surname Caliste was too hard to pronounce. Knight recorded four singles, making a name for herself locally, but was not able to attract any national attention. By the late 1960s, it was obvious that Knight&#x27;s career was not living up to her high expectations, so she went to work as a baker in the cafeteria of St. Mary&#x27;s Dominican College in New Orleans. She had been raised a Catholic.

===Success at Stax===
In early 1970, Knight was discovered by songwriter Ralph Williams, who wanted her to record some songs. With Williams&#x27; connections, Knight came in contact with record producer Wardell Quezergue. In May of that year, Knight went to Malaco Studios in Jackson, Mississippi, for a recording session during which she recorded &quot;Mr. Big Stuff.&quot; After the session was finished, the song was shopped to producers at several national labels, all of whom rejected it. But when King Floyd&#x27;s hit &quot;Groove Me&quot; (also recorded at Malaco Studios) became a No. 1 R&amp;B hit in early 1971, a producer at Stax Records remembered Knight&#x27;s recording of &quot;Mr. Big Stuff&quot;, and released it. The song also proved to be an instant smash in 1971, reaching No. 2 on the pop chart and becoming a No. 1 R&amp;B hit. It went double-platinum and received a Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female; it lost to Aretha Franklin&#x27;s version of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;. It sold over two million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. Knight performed the hit song on &quot;Soul Train&quot;. An album of the same name proved to be fairly successful. A couple more minor hits followed, but disagreements with her producer and her label terminated Knight&#x27;s involvement with Stax.

===Later years===
After leaving Stax, Knight recorded songs for various small labels, but was not able to gain any more recognition, and ended up performing and touring the local oldie circuit. Things changed in 1981, when Knight met local producer Isaac Bolden, who signed her to his Soulin&#x27; label. Together, they came up with a song entitled &quot;You Got the Papers but I Got the Man&quot;, an answer song to Richard &quot;Dimples&quot; Fields&#x27; record, &quot;She&#x27;s Got Papers On Me&quot;; that song was leased to Atlantic Records for national release. Soon, Knight found herself touring consistently. In 1985, Knight gained more recognition when she covered Rockin&#x27; Sidney&#x27;s zydeco novelty hit, &quot;My Toot Toot&quot;, and found herself in a chart battle with Denise LaSalle&#x27;s version. While LaSalle&#x27;s version reached the top ten in the United Kingdom, Knight&#x27;s version was the more successful in the U.S., reaching No. 50 on the pop chart. Knight was then given a chance to perform it on the TV variety show &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. The song also became Knight&#x27;s only hit in South Africa, reaching No. 3.

Although Knight waited twelve years to come out with another recording, she continued touring and performing engagements all over the world, particularly in the Southern states. In 2003, Knight performed , on the PBS special &quot;Soul Comes Home&quot;. Knight continued to tour and make live performances, often with such artists as Gloria Gaynor. In October 2007, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame honored Knight for her contributions to Louisiana music by inducting her. Knight&#x27;s song &quot;Do Me&quot; appeared on the 2007 &quot;Superbad&quot; soundtrack.

===Personal life and death===
Knight was married at least twice and had at least one child. Knight married Thomas Commedore and together they had a son. In the early 1970s, she was married to New Orleans longshoreman Earl Harris.

Knight died at a hospital in Tampa, Florida, on November 22, 2023, at the age of 80. Issuing a statement on her death her family said: &quot;Beyond touring, recording studios, Ms. Knight loved cooking delicious Creole dishes for family and friends, celebrated Mardi Gras with several local krewes, and proudly served on the Louisiana Music Commission.&quot;

<text>Bray Head () is a hill and headland located in northern County Wicklow, Ireland, between the towns of Bray and Greystones. It forms part of the Wicklow Mountains and is a popular spot with hillwalkers. At the top of the head is a concrete cross which was placed there in 1950 during the holy year. Every Good Friday, hundreds of local people climb to the top of the head in a Good Friday procession marking the stations of the Cross as they go along, with the final station being held at the holy year cross.
The headland and adjacent lands were designated under a Special Amenity Area Order in March 2008.

The most direct way to reach the cross at the top (about 190m above sea level) is via an ascending footpath that begins just outside the free car park on the lower, northern slopes, to the south of Bray Esplanade. This is a half-hour walk for a fit person. The footpath, after the initial section with cut steps, is a rough path formed by rainwater and ascending through natural woodland. A more gradual route can be taken from the Southern Cross, by Bray Golf Club, which is easier underfoot. There is also a route which ascends from the Greystones side of the cliff walk; this route leads quite directly up the east side of the hill and as a result is quite steep, Upon reaching the top you can then walk the path along to the cross. 

The Dublin-Wicklow railway line runs outside of Bray Head along the coast, sometimes travelling within feet of the cliffs. This line, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is referred to as &quot;Brunel&#x27;s Folly&quot;, due to the ongoing maintenance costs associated with maintaining a cliff-face line. The line had to be diverted on three occasions in 1876, 1879, and 1917. A serious accident occurred on 9 August 1867 when a passenger train derailed on nearby Brandy Hole Viaduct, causing the deaths of two passengers. The rail trip between Dublin and Bray Daly railway station, the nearest station to Bray Head, takes approximately 45 minutes. 

On the morning of 14 April 2012, a waterspout was observed just off the coast of Bray Head. 

The slate sea-cliffs at Bray Head have been established as a minor rock-climbing location since the 1970s, though a few of the climbs were originally recorded in the 1940s. The 2009 guidebook lists 27 single-pitch climbs, generally in the lower grades, up to HVS.

<text>Temporal difference (TD) learning refers to a class of model-free reinforcement learning methods which learn by bootstrapping from the current estimate of the value function. These methods sample from the environment, like Monte Carlo methods, and perform updates based on current estimates, like dynamic programming methods.

While Monte Carlo methods only adjust their estimates once the final outcome is known, TD methods adjust predictions to match later, more accurate, predictions about the future before the final outcome is known. This is a form of bootstrapping, as illustrated with the following example:

Suppose you wish to predict the weather for Saturday, and you have some model that predicts Saturday&#x27;s weather, given the weather of each day in the week. In the standard case, you would wait until Saturday and then adjust all your models. However, when it is, for example, Friday, you should have a pretty good idea of what the weather would be on Saturday – and thus be able to change, say, Saturday&#x27;s model before Saturday arrives.

Temporal difference methods are related to the temporal difference model of animal learning.

== Mathematical formulation ==
The tabular TD(0) method is one of the simplest TD methods. It is a special case of more general stochastic approximation methods. It estimates the state value function of a finite-state Markov decision process (MDP) under a policy formula_1. Let formula_2 denote the state value function of the MDP with states formula_3, rewards formula_4 and discount rate formula_5 under the policy formula_6:
:formula_7
We drop the action from the notation for convenience. formula_2 satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation: 
: formula_9

so formula_10 is an unbiased estimate for formula_11. This observation motivates the following algorithm for estimating formula_2.

The algorithm starts by initializing a table formula_13 arbitrarily, with one value for each state of the MDP. A positive learning rate formula_14 is chosen.

We then repeatedly evaluate the policy formula_1, obtain a reward formula_16 and update the value function for the current state using the rule:
:formula_17
where formula_18 and formula_19 are the current and next states, respectively. The value formula_20 is known as the TD target, and formula_21 is known as the TD error.

== TD-Lambda ==
TD-Lambda is a learning algorithm invented by Richard S. Sutton based on earlier work on temporal difference learning by Arthur Samuel. This algorithm was famously applied by Gerald Tesauro to create TD-Gammon, a program that learned to play the game of backgammon at the level of expert human players.

The lambda (formula_22) parameter refers to the trace decay parameter, with formula_23. Higher settings lead to longer lasting traces; that is, a larger proportion of credit from a reward can be given to more distant states and actions when formula_22 is higher, with formula_25 producing parallel learning to Monte Carlo RL algorithms.

== In neuroscience ==
The TD algorithm has also received attention in the field of neuroscience. Researchers discovered that the firing rate of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) appear to mimic the error function in the algorithm. The error function reports back the difference between the estimated reward at any given state or time step and the actual reward received. The larger the error function, the larger the difference between the expected and actual reward. When this is paired with a stimulus that accurately reflects a future reward, the error can be used to associate the stimulus with the future reward.

Dopamine cells appear to behave in a similar manner. In one experiment measurements of dopamine cells were made while training a monkey to associate a stimulus with the reward of juice. Initially the dopamine cells increased firing rates when the monkey received juice, indicating a difference in expected and actual rewards. Over time this increase in firing back propagated to the earliest reliable stimulus for the reward. Once the monkey was fully trained, there was no increase in firing rate upon presentation of the predicted reward. Subsequently, the firing rate for the dopamine cells decreased below normal activation when the expected reward was not produced. This mimics closely how the error function in TD is used for reinforcement learning.

The relationship between the model and potential neurological function has produced research attempting to use TD to explain many aspects of behavioral research. It has also been used to study conditions such as schizophrenia or the consequences of pharmacological manipulations of dopamine on learning.
