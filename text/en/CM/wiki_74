<text>Reginald Roy Inwood, VC (14 July 189023 October 1971) was an Australian soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. Inwood enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in August 1914, and along with the rest of the 10th Battalion, he landed at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915. He fought at Anzac until being evacuated sick to Egypt in September. He remained there until he rejoined his unit on the Western Front in June 1916. In August, he fought in the Battle of Mouquet Farm.

In 1917, Inwood was with his battalion when it fought in the Battle of Lagnicourt in April, then the Second Battle of Bullecourt the following month. During the Battle of Menin Road in September, he was involved in the elimination of a German machine-gun post and other actions, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He reached the rank of sergeant before being sent back to Australia in August 1918. During World War II, he volunteered for service in the Citizens Military Forces, and reached the rank of warrant officer class one, serving in the Australian Provost Corps and Military Prison and Detention Barracks Service. After the war he returned to work with the City of Adelaide, and upon his death he was buried with full military honours in the AIF Cemetery, West Terrace. His medals are displayed in the Adelaide Town Hall.

==Early life==

Born Reginald Roy Inwood on 14 July 1890 at North Adelaide, South Australia, he was the eldest son of Edward Inwood and his wife Mary Anne Minney. He had an older sister and three younger brothers. Roy was educated first at the North Adelaide Public School, and after the family moved to Broken Hill, New South Wales, he attended the Broken Hill Model School. After completing his schooling, he found work in the local mining industry, where he was employed at the outbreak of World War I.

==World War I==
===Gallipoli campaign===

On 24 August 1914, Inwood enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and joined the 10th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Division. The 10th Battalion underwent its initial training at Morphettville, South Australia, before embarking on the troopship HMAT A11 at Outer Harbor on 20 October. At the time of embarkation, the full battalion strength was 1,023 men. Sailing via Fremantle and Colombo, Ceylon, the ship arrived at Alexandria, Egypt, on 6 December, and the troops disembarked. They then boarded trains for Cairo where they entered camp at Mena in the shadow of the Great Pyramid of Giza on the following day, along with the rest of the AIF. After Inwood arrived in Egypt, his brother Robert Minney Inwood enlisted and was also allotted to the 10th Battalion. While at Mena, Roy Inwood performed duties as a mounted policeman. They remained at Mena until 28 February 1915, when they entrained for Alexandria. They embarked on the British troopship HMT on 1 March, and a few days later arrived at the port of Mudros on the Greek island of Lemnos in the northeastern Aegean Sea, where they remained on board for the next seven weeks.

The 3rd Brigade had been chosen as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April. The brigade embarked on the battleship and the destroyer , and after transferring to strings of rowing-boats initially towed by steam pinnaces, the battalion began rowing ashore about 4:30a.m. Inwood participated in the heavy fighting at the landing, and other than a short period in hospital in May, was involved in the subsequent trench warfare defending the beachhead, being promoted to lance corporal in August. In early May, Robert had joined the battalion on Gallipoli. In September Roy was evacuated sick to Egypt, initially with gastritis and then with rheumatism, and remained there recuperating while the 10th Battalion was withdrawn to Lemnos in November, and subsequently back to Egypt.

===Western Front===
====1916====

The battalion underwent reorganisation and training in Egypt then sailed for France in March 1916 where it was committed to fighting on the Western Front in June. Inwood did not rejoin his battalion until 30 July, and was promoted to temporary corporal two weeks later in the wake of the 327 casualties suffered by the unit during its first major action on the Western Front, the Battle of Pozières. Among those killed was Roy&#x27;s brother, Robert, by then a sergeant. In mid-to-late August, the battalion was committed to the Battle of Mouquet Farm, during which it suffered another 335 casualties.
The battalion was then sent to rest and recuperate for a few weeks at a camp near Poperinge in Belgium, before returning to the front line at Hill 60 near Zillebeke in late September, having absorbed replacements. After being relieved in early October, the 10th Battalion was again withdrawn to camps in the rear, where they remained until early November. While in camp in October, Inwood was charged with absence without leave and reduced in rank to private. The battalion then returned to the front line near Gueudecourt, France, until 12 November, and was then withdrawn into rear areas until a stint in the support trenches at Flers in early December. On 10 December, Inwood was evacuated to hospital due to problems with his feet, and did not rejoin his unit until just after Christmas.

====1917====

Once Inwood returned to the battalion, it was involved in fatigue duties, then training, before moving back into the front line at Le Barque near Bazentin in mid-February 1917. On 25 February, the battalion was involved in an attack in the same sector, incurring about 20 per cent casualties. It was relieved on the same day, initially moving back into support trenches, before marching to the rear a few days later.

Inwood and the rest of the battalion spent March 1917 in reserve and rest areas while Allied forces advanced towards the Hindenburg Line after the German withdrawal, before moving forward into the front line north of Louverval in early April. The unit was in a support role when the Germans counter-attacked during the Battle of Lagnicourt on 15 April; the battalion suffered only 11 casualties. Relieved soon after, the unit went into rear areas where it performed fatigue duties and salvage until 5 May when it entered the line near Bullecourt. Over the following three days, Inwood and the rest of the battalion were involved in the Second Battle of Bullecourt, during which the unit suffered 182 casualties. From mid-May until mid-September, the 10th Battalion was out of the line in rest areas, undergoing training and engaging in sports.
The battalion went into action at Polygon Wood on 19 September during the Battle of Menin Road. Attacking the second objective along the west edge of Polygon Wood with the rest of his unit, Inwood moved forward of the friendly artillery barrage and single-handedly captured a German post, killing several enemy and taking nine prisoners. He then volunteered for an all-night patrol, during which he went forward and sent back valuable information about enemy dispositions. The fighting continued over the next few days, and on the early morning of 21 September, while the battalion was consolidating, Inwood located a German machine-gun post that was causing considerable trouble for his unit. He went forward and bombed it, killing all the Germans in the post except one, who he forced to carry the machine gun back to the Australian lines. In this latter action, Inwood was assisted, albeit apparently briefly, by an unidentified soldier from the 7th Battalion. Inwood was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions. His actions had stunned the entire battalion. The VC was the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time.

The 10th Battalion suffered 207 casualties during the Battle of Menin Road. Inwood was again promoted to lance corporal on 28 September, after which he went on leave to the United Kingdom. On his return, he was promoted to corporal, and then spent several weeks at the 3rd Brigade training school. The 10th Battalion rotated through support, reserve and rest areas throughout November 1917. Inwood&#x27;s VC citation was published on 26 November 1917, and read:

Inwood had another two weeks&#x27; leave in the United Kingdom immediately prior to Christmas 1917, during which he was invested with his VC by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 12 December.

====1918====

The 10th Battalion continued to rotate through front line, support, reserve and rest areas until mid-April 1918 when it travelled north by train, and was involved in an attack at Méteren on 24–25 April, during which it suffered 79 casualties. This was the last fighting that Inwood experienced, as he was sent to the United Kingdom on 29 April, where he was involved in training for several months. He was repatriated to Australia along with nine other VC recipients in August 1918, to take part in a recruiting campaign on the invitation of Prime Minister Billy Hughes. He disembarked from the troopship HMAT A7 in Adelaide on 11 October, and was discharged on 12 December, the war having ended on 11 November.

Inwood rose to the rank of sergeant by the end of his service. As well as the Victoria Cross, he received the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I. As well as Robert, his other younger brother also served; Private Harold Ray Inwood served with the 43rd Battalion and returned to Australia in 1917 after being wounded.

==Interwar period==

Inwood returned to a hero&#x27;s welcome in Broken Hill in October 1918 but at an event organised in his honour gave a controversial public speech. He claimed he had &quot;been stoned by at the train&quot;, when he had departed to fight and with his return &quot;those mongrels were the first to shake me by the hand&quot;. Newly enlisted soldiers had been hooted and jeered at by militant socialists in Broken Hill on their departure, but there is no evidence stones were thrown. Inwood went on to assert that, &quot;If the boys stick together like they did in France there will be no Bolshevikism in this town... I would like to be at one end of the street with a machine-gun and have them at the other end&quot;. The far-left Australian Labor Party Member for Barrier in the Australian House of Representatives, Michael Considine, accused Inwood of trying &quot;to incite trouble between returned soldiers and the working classes&quot;. Inwood subsequently apologised for his comments.

No longer welcome in Broken Hill due to his comments, Inwood moved to Adelaide where he married a 23-year-old widow, Mabel Alice Collins, née Weber, on 31 December 1918. In 1919, he was charged with assault and fined. Inwood had difficulty in finding work, and he and Mabel divorced in 1921. He then moved to Queenstown, Tasmania, to work in the mines, and then back to Kangaroo Island in South Australia, where he worked in a eucalyptus distillery. Inwood married Evelyn Owens in 1927. Returning to Adelaide, he was employed by the Adelaide City Council as a labourer from 1928 onwards. By 1937, Evelyn had died.

==World War II==

Less than a month after the outbreak of World War II, Inwood volunteered for service in the Citizens Military Forces and again enlisted as a private, although he was promoted to sergeant within a week. In March 1940 he was transferred to the 4th Military District (4 MD) Australian Provost Corps (military police) section, and was promoted to staff sergeant. He was then transferred to the 4 MD detention barracks staff in November. He went on leave for three weeks in January–February 1941, and was transferred back to the provost section, later provost company, in November, and two weeks later was promoted to warrant officer class two. In April 1942, he was temporarily promoted to warrant officer class one, before being transferred back to a detention barracks in August. Inwood married Louise Elizabeth Gates in 1942, and this was a happy marriage. In June 1943, Inwood was transferred from the Australian Provost Corps to the Military Prison and Detention Barracks Service, and was then posted around various detention barracks, being substantively promoted to warrant officer class one in November 1943. Aged 54, he was medically discharged on 30 November 1944 due to a deterioration in his overall health. For his service in World War II, Inwood received the War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–1945. He was also later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.

==Post-war==

Inwood returned to the Adelaide City Council where he continued working until 1955. He attended the VC centenary celebrations in London the following year. For many years he lived at Norwood, and he died on 23 October 1971 at St Peters. He was given a military funeral and buried at the West Terrace AIF Cemetery, Adelaide. Despite his three marriages, he had no children. Inwood maintained strong links with his 10th Battalion comrades over the years, and always marched alongside them in the Adelaide Anzac Day Commemorative March. According to his &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; entry, Inwood was &quot;rugged, independent and well-built&quot;, but gave the impression that his VC &quot;had not done him much good&quot;.

==Memorial controversies==

In his will, Inwood bequeathed all his war medals to the 10th Battalion Club, who indicated they would donate the VC to the Australian War Memorial. Inwood objected and stated he wanted the medal to remain in Adelaide. In June 1971, with Inwood&#x27;s consent, the 10th Battalion Club decided to present the VC to the city upon his death. On 25 September 1972, his medals were handed over. They were displayed in the Adelaide Town Hall from 1972 until 1989, when it was decided to place them in a high security vault while a replica medal set was put on display.

In 2005 Inwood&#x27;s VC became the centre of considerable media and community debate with calls for it to be displayed in the Australian War Memorial&#x27;s Hall of Valour. After consulting with the Inwood family and other interested parties, it was decided to honour Inwood&#x27;s dying wishes. In December 2005, funds were allocated to provide security so the original VC could be displayed in the Adelaide Town Hall. In 2007 the debate regarding the sensitive subject briefly reignited.

The 10th Battalion Other Ranks&#x27; Mess at the Torrens Parade Ground, Adelaide, was called the Roy Inwood VC Club. In 2008, it was debated whether to call the new tunnel under Anzac Highway either the &quot;Inwood Underpass&quot; or &quot;Blackburn Underpass&quot;, after fellow South Australian and 10th Battalion soldier Arthur Blackburn, who was awarded the VC during the Battle of Pozières while fighting alongside Inwood&#x27;s brother Robert, before Robert was killed. The Returned &amp; Services League of Australia objected that naming the tunnel after a specific veteran was inappropriate, saying it should be named after a major World War I battleground, in line with the highway&#x27;s theme. On completion, the tunnel was named the Gallipoli Underpass.

<text>Matthew Hughes VC (c. 1822 – 9 January 1882) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Hughes was approximately 33 years old and a private in 7th Regiment of Foot (now The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers), British Army when, during the Crimean War, he performed the acts that saw him recommended for the VC. The full citation was in the first set of awards of the VC published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 24 February 1857, and read:

Private Mathew Hughes, 7th Royal Fusiliers, was noticed by Colonel Campbell, 90th Light Infantry, on the 7th June, 1855, at the storming of the Quarries, for twice going for ammunition, under a heavy fire, across the open ground; he also went to the front, and brought in Private John Hampton, who was lying severely wounded; and on the 18th June, 1855, he volunteered to bring in Lieutenant Hobson, 7th Royal Fusiliers, who was lying severely wounded, and, in the act of doing so, was severely wounded himself.

Hughes achieved the rank of sergeant that same year, but was later demoted.

==Medal==
His Victoria Cross is on display at the Tower of London in the Royal Fusiliers Museum.

<doc id="1218673" wikidata="Q492910" url="?curid=1218673" title="Shrink wrap">
<text>Shrink wrap, also shrink film, is a material made up of polymer plastic film. When heat is applied, it shrinks tightly over whatever it is covering.
Heat can be applied with a handheld heat gun (electric or gas), or the product and film can pass through a heat tunnel on a conveyor.

== Composition ==

The most commonly used shrink wrap is polyolefin. It is available in a variety of thicknesses, clarities, strengths and shrink ratios. The two primary films can be either crosslinked, or non crosslinked. Other shrink films include PVC, Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and several other compositions.

Coextrusions and laminations are available for specific mechanical and barrier properties for shrink wrapping food. For example, five layers might be configuration as EP/EVA/copolyester/EVA/EP, where EP is ethylene-propylene and EVA is ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer.

PVC is the most used shrink wrap, due to its light weight, and inexpensive capabilities. PVC is durable, and can be used for many different purposes. However, it should be used in a well-ventilated area, as it can give off a strong, harmful odor. PVC has been banned in many countries, due to the harmful products created by its decomposition. PVC has some negative qualities including, it is not good for bundling, leaves carbon deposits, and has a low shrink force.

Polyolefin or POF shrink wrap is a premium shrink wrap, as it is extremely durable and versatile. POF is puncture resistant, and has a strong seal strength, which allows it to be used for irregularly shaped items. POF is available in 35, 45, 60, 75, and 100, 1 mil gauges. POF shrink wrap is made from 100% recyclable materials, and is FDA approved. It has great clarity, and a glossy self-appearance, as appearance is critical. POF is great for bundling multiple items together, and has the ability to shrink completely and quickly.

PE, a polyolefin, is used in several forms of flexible protective packaging. There are 3 different forms PE can take place in. These include Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE), and High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE). For shrink wrapping LDPE would be the best choice, as it has a higher strength, and more durability for heavier items. These wraps can also have graphic images printed on them, and LDPE provides the greatest quality. PE gauges can go all the way up to 1200, allowing for a great range of gauges. The disadvantage for PE is that it does not have a great shrink rate, and has lower clarity than other wraps.

== Manufacture ==
A shrink film can be made to shrink in one direction (unidirectional or mono-directional) or in both directions (bidirectional).

Films are stretched when they are warm to orient the molecules from their initial random pattern. Cooling the film sets the film&#x27;s characteristics until it is reheated: this causes it to shrink back toward its initial dimensions.

Prior to orientation, the molecules of a sheet or tube are randomly intertwined like a bowl of spaghetti. The molecules are coiled and twisted and have no particular alignment. However, when a draw force is imposed, the amorphous regions of the chains are straightened and aligned to the direction of orientation. By applying proper cooling, the molecules will be frozen in this state until sufficient heat energy is applied to allow the chains to shrink back. One can visualize this phenomenon by stretching a rubber band and dipping it into liquid nitrogen so as to freeze in the stretched state. The band will remain in this state as long as it is kept at sufficiently cold temperatures. However, when enough heat energy is applied, the rubber band will shrink back to its original relaxed state.

Orientation on a commercial scale can be achieved using either of two processes: a tenterframe or a bubble process. Tenterframe technology is used to produce a variety of “heat-set” products, with biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) being the most common (heat-setting is a process whereby a film is reheated in a constrained state such that the shrink properties are destroyed).

The second commercial process is the bubble process, sometimes referred to as the tubular process. In this process, a primary tube is produced by either blowing or casting the tube onto an external or internal mandrel, respectively. It is common to use water to help cool the primary tube at this point. After the primary tube has been cooled, it is then reheated and inflated into a second bubble using air much like a balloon is blown. Upon inflation, the tube is oriented in both directions simultaneously.

The family of shrink films has broadened over the years with many multi-layer constructions being sold today. Shrink film attributes include shrink, sealability, optics, toughness, and slip. With regard to shrink properties, there are onset temperature, free shrink, shrink force, shrink temperature range, memory, and overall package appearance.

== Use ==


Shrink wrap is applied over or around the intended item, often by automated equipment. It is then heated by a heat gun or sent through a shrink tunnel or oven for shrinking.

Shrink wrap can be supplied in several forms. Flat rollstock can be wrapped around a product, often with heat sealing to tack the film together. Centerfolded film is supplied on a roll with the plastic pre-folded in half, product is placed in the center portion, the remaining three edges are sealed to form a bag, and the package then heated which causes the bag to shrink and conform to the product. Pre-formed plastic shrink bags have one end open, the product is placed in the bag, sealed, and sent for heat shrinking.

Shrink wrap can be used to wrap buildings. It can wrap roofs after hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and other disasters. Shrink wrap can be used for environmental containments to facilitate safe removal of asbestos, lead and other hazards.

Shrink wrap is sometimes used to wrap up books, especially adult-oriented ones and premium comics and manga, mainly to preserve their mint condition, as casual previewing prior to purchase wears or damages stock, rendering it unsaleable.

Vegetables such as cucumbers can be individually shrink wrapped to extend the shelf life.

Software on carriers such as CDs or DVDs are often sold in boxes that are packaged in shrink wrap. The licenses of such software are typically put inside the boxes, making it impossible to read them before purchasing. This has raised questions about the validity of such shrink wrap licenses.

Shrink wrap is commonly used as an overwrap on many types of packaging, including cartons, boxes, beverage cans and pallet loads. Foam cushioning can be held securely in shrink film, eliminating use of a traditional corrugated box. A variety of products may be enclosed in shrink wrap to stabilize the products, unitize them, keep them clean, or add tamper resistance. It can be the primary covering for some foods such as cheese, meats, vegetables and plants. Heat-shrink tubing is used to seal electric wiring.

Shrink bands are applied over parts of packages for tamper resistance or labels. It can be used as a Tamper-evident band.

It can also combine two packages or parts into a Multi-pack.

Shrink wrap is also commonly used within more industrial applications using a heavier weight shrink film. The principles remain the same with a heat shrinking process using a hand held heat gun. The following shrink wrap applications are becoming more widely used and accepted:

* Industrial shrink wrap containment of large plant equipment/components,
* Scaffold wrap containment of buildings/bridges,
* Building temporary shrink wrap structures for storage or other business operational uses,
* Marine shrink wrapping of boats and other vehicles,
* Shrink wrapping of palletized freight

* Disaster contingency and relief projects such as damaged buildings/roofs.

Anthony Wong Chau-sang (born Anthony William Perry; 2 September 1961) is a Hong Kong film actor and singer, known for his intense portrayals of often-amoral characters. He has won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor three times for &quot;The Untold Story&quot; (1993), &quot;Beast Cops&quot; (1998) and &quot;Still Human&quot; (2018), and won Taiwan&#x27;s Golden Horse Award for Best Actor for &quot;The Sunny Side of the Street&quot; (2022). He is the first Hong Kong actor to have won Best Actor awards in films, stage theatre and TV. His notable international credits include his roles as Triad gangster Johnny Wong in &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; (1992), police superintendent Wong Chi-shing in the &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; trilogy (2002–2003) and General Yang in the Hollywood film &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; (2008).

== Early life ==
Wong was born Anthony William Perry on 2 September 1961 to a Hong Kong Chinese mother of Taishanese descent, Wong Juen-yee, and an English father, Frederick William Perry, who served with the Royal Air Force during World War II and later as a colonial officer. Frederick Perry walked out on the family when Wong was four, so he lived with his mother &quot;in the staircase of a pre-war building in Wan Chai&quot; until he was sent to live with various relatives for two years while his mother &quot;held down three jobs.&quot; He kept in touch with his father through letters until they lost contact when he was 12 years old, and he knew that he had three older half-siblings from his father&#x27;s marriage. He met his half-brothers in 2018.

In his acting career, Wong has established a reputation for openly critiquing the Hong Kong film industry and its practices, actors&#x27; performances and pop culture in interviews and his personal microblog. In some of those critiques, he revealed his experiences of being bullied and discriminated against—for being a &quot;mixed race foreigner&quot; and &quot;during the 1960s, English-Chinese mixed race people like me were regarded as bastards&quot; and for being born outside Hong Kong—while growing up in Hong Kong and during the early years of his acting career.

During his late teens, Wong moved to the United Kingdom to attend a college of further education. He returned to Hong Kong to attend a training course in hairdressing until he quit to join Asia Television&#x27;s (ATV) training programme when he was 21.

== Career ==
After completing ATV&#x27;s training programme, he continued his training at The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. He had stated in an interview that his mixed ethnicity initially caused him to be typecast as a villain, due to institutionalised racism in the Hong Kong film industry during this period. He nonetheless won a Hong Kong Film Award for his performance as a fictionalised version of serial killer Huang Zhiheng in the 1993 film &quot;The Untold Story&quot;.

In the following years, Wong appeared in a wide range of genre films including &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Cop&quot;, &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;, &quot;The Heroic Trio&quot;, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, &quot;The Mission,&quot; &quot;The Medallion&quot; and the &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; film series. Wong had also appeared in a number of international films, such as &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; and &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot;. In 1995, Wong made his directorial debut with &quot;The New Tenant&quot;. In a 2005 interview with &quot;Star eCentral&quot;, Wong stated that amongst his prolific output during the 1980s and the 1990s, a considerable number of films he appeared in were &quot;terrible.&quot; However, he does not regret making those films, as he needed the money to support his family.

In 2014, Wong hosted TV show &quot;Dinner Confidential&quot;, where he would prepare one dish out of a table d&#x27;hote candle-lit dinner menu for guests. In 2015, Wong won the TVB Anniversary Awards for Best Actor and Best Drama for &quot;Lord of Shanghai,&quot; making him the first Hong Kong actor to have won Best Actor awards in films, stage theatre and TV. 

== Personal life ==
Wong married his teenage sweetheart, Jane Ng Wai-zing, in 1992 but lived separately. They have two sons, born in 1996 and 1998. Wong and Ng signed a divorce agreement in 1998 but did not file for the divorce. In June 2018, it was revealed that he had a son named William (born 1998) in the UK with a woman named Joyce, who is the niece of John Shum. Since 2020, Wong has been living with his wife Ng after 28 years of living separately.

In March 2018, Wong met his half-brothers, twins John William and David Frederick Perry, after a BBC story on Wong&#x27;s search for his family was published. He also has a half-sister, Vera Ann. His father died in 1988 in Australia, where he and his first family settled after they left Hong Kong. His half-siblings did not know of Wong&#x27;s existence until the BBC story was produced.

Wong is a supporter of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, a series of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. This has reportedly led to limited acting opportunities for him in mainland China. He has also voiced support for the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. On 18 April 2021, Wong was approved for Taiwan&#x27;s Employment Gold Card, allowing him to work in Taiwan without needing to apply in advance. It also allows him to receive tax incentives and National Health Insurance.

<text>Joseph Malone VC (11 January 1833 – 28 June 1883) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Malone was born in Eccles, Lancashire on 11 January 1833. After working as a farrier, in March 1851 he enlisted in the 13th Light Dragoons (later 13th Hussars). In May 1854 he travelled with his regiment to the Crimea and served throughout the Crimean War.

==VC action==
He was a 21 years old sergeant in the 13th Light Dragoons, British Army, during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25 October 1854 at Balaclava, Crimean Peninsula during the Charge of the Light Brigade, Sergeant Malone, while returning on foot from the charge, in which his horse had been shot, stopped under very heavy fire and helped a troop sergeant-major (John Berryman) and other sergeant (John Farrell) to move a very severely wounded officer (who subsequently died) out of range of the guns.

Malone was presented with his VC by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 21 November 1857.

==Further career==
After the war, Malone transferred to the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons and was commissioned as a Riding Master in 1858. After service in India and Ireland, in 1881 he along with other riding masters was granted the honorary rank of Captain. 

In 1881 he sailed to South Africa with his regiment. Here, despite suffering ill health, he was not invalided home as he only had one year left before retiring. Malone died at Pinetown on 28 June 1883, and was buried in the small cemetery in what was the old St Andrews churchyard. An account of his funeral reads: &quot;His body was brought from the Rugby Hotel on a gun carriage drawn by soldiers, his horse led in front of it, his boots hanging reversed from the saddle, with his sword and knapsack rolled on it, the helmet resting on the coffin. The band played the Dead March and the men moved along the road slowly and majestically to the solemn sounds; and we children were moved to tears with the pathos and marvel of it all.&quot;

His Victoria Cross was acquired by Lord Ashcroft in 2017 and is held at the Imperial War Museum, London as part of the Lord Ashcroft VC collection.

He was the grandfather of Patricia Malone and great grandfather of Sally Ann Howes, both actresses.

<text>John McNamara VC (28 October 1887 – 16 October 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 30 years old, and a corporal in the 9th Battalion, The East Surrey Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 3 September 1918 north west of Lens, France, when operating a telephone in evacuated enemy trenches occupied by his battalion, Corporal McNamara realised that a determined enemy counter-attack was gaining ground. Rushing to the nearest post, he made very good use of a revolver taken from a wounded officer and then, seizing a Lewis gun, he fired it until it jammed. By this time, he was alone in the post and, having destroyed the telephone, he joined the nearest post and maintained a Lewis gun until reinforcements arrived.

He was killed in action near Solesmes, France, on 16 October 1918.

In 2018, a plaque was unveiled in the John McNamara Gardens in the centre of Bamber Bridge, less than half a mile from where he was born. Three generations of his family, politicians, soldiers and priests stood in tribute to McNamara, 100 years after the courageous act which earned him the only Victoria Cross awarded to a aresident of South Ribble.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Queen&#x27;s Royal Surrey Regiment Museum, in Clandon Park, Surrey.

<doc id="1218687" wikidata="Q534970" url="?curid=1218687" title="The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More">
<text>The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More is a 1977 short story collection by British author Roald Dahl. The seven stories are generally regarded as being aimed at a slightly older audience than many of Dahl&#x27;s other children&#x27;s novels.

The stories were written at various times throughout his life. Two of the stories are autobiographical in nature; one describes how he first became a writer while the other describes some of Dahl&#x27;s experiences as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. Another piece in the collection is a non-fiction account of a British farmer finding a legendary haul of ancient Roman treasure. 

In 2023, the title story of the collection, &quot;&quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot;, was adapted into a short film directed by Wes Anderson with Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular character, alongside Ralph Fiennes, Dev Patel, Ben Kingsley, and Richard Ayoade. Another short story from the collection, &quot;The Swan&quot;&quot;, was also adapted into a short film directed by Anderson in 2023 and subsequently included into his 2024 anthology film.

==Chapters==
===The Boy Who Talked with Animals===
This is a first-person fiction piece of medium-length writing. The narrator, on advice from friends, decides to vacation in Jamaica. One night, a sea turtle, ancient and huge, is caught by a group of fishermen. Rich people want to buy it, while the manager of a nearby hotel wants to make turtle soup out of it, but both plans are foiled when a little boy appears and shames the crowd for their cruelty. His parents explain that he has a deep affinity for animals, and even talks to them. The boy&#x27;s father pays off the fisherfolk and hotel manager, and the turtle is set free. The next day, the boy is missing, and the fisherfolk reveal that they have seen the child riding on the back of the sea turtle into the distance.

===The Hitch-Hiker===

This is another fictional first-person narrative. The narrator in this case has a brand new BMW 3.3 Li, and is enjoying a trip down the highway when he spots a hitchhiker. He lets the man into his car; the passenger is described as being curiously rat-like, with long, slim fingers. They engage in conversation, revealing the man&#x27;s Cockney accent and attitudes.

As they talk, the narrator is urged by the hitchhiker to test the car&#x27;s engine power by going ever faster. This results in a police motorbike pulling them over for speeding. The police officer who writes the ticket acts particularly harshly, threatening the narrator with a long prison sentence and a huge fine.

The narrator is despondent until his new friend challenges the narrator to guess his true profession. As he does, the hitchhiker suddenly reveals various items from the narrator&#x27;s person, from a wallet to a watch to the narrator&#x27;s shoelace. The narrator accuses the hitchhiker of being a pickpocket. The hitchhiker disagrees, claiming that he is a &quot;fingersmith&quot;—just as a goldsmith has mastered gold, he has mastered the use of his fingers. He claims that he is never caught due to his &quot;fantastic fingers&quot;. He then reveals that he has stolen both of the police officer&#x27;s notebooks, which contain the tickets and the details of the offence. Relieved, the narrator and the hitchhiker then stop on the highway to light a bonfire of the notebooks.

===The Mildenhall Treasure===
This is a non-fiction account of the discovery of the Mildenhall Treasure. Gordon Butcher, a ploughman, uncovers a vast hoard of Roman silver while working for a man named Ford. Ford tricks Butcher into believing that the find is worthless and takes it home for himself, but he gets his comeuppance when a visiting archaeologist recognises it as unreported treasure trove.

It was first published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in the US in 1946 and was first published in book form in this collection. It was published as a single title edition in 1999 by Jonathan Cape, with illustrations by Ralph Steadman.

===The Swan===
Ernie, a loutish school bully, receives a rifle for his 15th birthday. He and a friend use it to shoot small birds before training it on the school , Peter Watson. At gunpoint, Peter is made to lie in the path of an oncoming train; he survives by sinking into the trackbed as the train passes. Next, the bullies take him to a duck pond and force him to act as their &quot;retriever dog&quot;. The bird-loving Peter becomes incensed when Ernie kills a swan, and Ernie responds by promising to make it fly again. He accomplishes this by cutting the bird&#x27;s wings off and tying them to Peter&#x27;s arms, before forcing him to climb to the top of a weeping willow. Peter declines the bullies&#x27; invitation to jump, but a shot from Ernie&#x27;s rifle hits him in the leg and knocks him off balance. As Peter struggles to keep himself aloft, he sees a bright light which seems to beckon him on. Letting go of the tree, he dives towards it, creating the image of an enormous swan flying over the village. He lands in the garden of his home, where his mother calls for help before cutting the wings from his arms.

===The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar===

Henry Sugar, an independently wealthy man who enjoys gambling, finds and reads a doctor&#x27;s report on a strange patient who called himself &quot;The Man Who Sees Without Using His Eyes&quot;. The patient had the ability to see even after doctors had sealed the man&#x27;s eyes shut and bandaged his head. The man was part of a circus act and used his ability to make money. The man had been interested in magic all his life, and studied with Yogi Hardawar in India, who taught him how to see through thin objects such as paper or playing cards, and to see around solid objects such as a wooden door if he is allowed a finger or hand around it. The doctors decide the man could be of great benefit as a teacher of the blind and return to the circus, only to find that The Man Who Sees Without Using His Eyes has died.

Henry realises that the man&#x27;s book contains a detailed description of the meditation method used to gain this ability; he steals the book and then decides to try to learn it himself. After three years, Henry masters the ability to see through playing cards, and can even predict the future. Henry uses these abilities in a casino, where he becomes cognizant of other gamblers&#x27; greed. He uses his powers to predict which number will win on a roulette wheel and makes a great deal of money at the blackjack tables, but refrains from more feats in fear of publicity.

Henry wins enough money to buy a small house or a large automobile, but realises that the thrill of winning or losing has been eradicated by its ease. The next morning Henry has an acute revulsion towards the money and throws the money off his balcony. A near-riot breaks out as the people of London rush to collect the twenty pound notes falling from Henry&#x27;s apartment. A police officer scolds Henry and suggests that he find a more legal form of charity, and Henry vows to establish the most well-equipped and supportive orphanages in the world. This plan works until he reaches Las Vegas, where he unknowingly collects a huge sum from three casinos owned by the same Mafioso and narrowly escapes the owner&#x27;s thugs. Henry flies to Hollywood, where he enlists the aid of a famous makeup artist to create various disguises and false identities to protect himself. This works, and with the aid of his accountant and the artist he successfully travels the world under a number of names and identities. At the end of the story, the author reveals that he was selected, seemingly at random, by Henry&#x27;s accountant to write Henry&#x27;s story after his death. The narrator is shocked to hear all of the events, and comments that Henry&#x27;s wish came true—the Henry Sugar Orphanages, established all across the Earth, are indeed the best in the world.

===Lucky Break===
This is a non-fictional account, similar to Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;Going Solo&quot; albeit in a more concise form. It discusses the events in his life that led him to become a writer, including a meeting with a famous writer, who helped to launch his career. The story is about Dahl&#x27;s school and all the teachers, until after the publication of his first story.

===A Piece of Cake===
This is an autobiographical account of Dahl&#x27;s time as a fighter pilot in the Second World War, particularly the details of how Dahl was injured and eventually forced to leave the Mediterranean arena. The original version of the story was written for C. S. Forester so that he could get the gist of Dahl&#x27;s story and rewrite it in his own words. Forester was so impressed by the story (Dahl at the time did not believe himself a capable writer) that he sent it without modification to his agent, who had it published (as &quot;Shot Down Over Libya&quot;) in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, thereby initiating Dahl&#x27;s writing career. This short story was also published in one of Dahl&#x27;s many collections of short stories &quot;Over to You&quot; which was first published in 1946. The traditional English nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; makes an appearance in the story.

== Film adaptation ==

In January 2022, it was announced that Wes Anderson would direct an adaptation of &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot; with Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular character alongside Dev Patel, Ben Kingsley, Richard Ayoade, and Ralph Fiennes. It is distributed by Netflix and won for Best Live Action Short Film at the 96th Academy Awards. Anderson later announced that he would also adapt &quot;The Swan&quot; for Netflix, starring Rupert Friend, as well as two additional Dahl short stories, &quot;Poison&quot; and &quot;The Ratcatcher&quot;. The latter three, as well as the 7-tips to write fiction as provided in &quot;Lucky Break&quot;, are combined into The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More.

<text>Major-General Henry Edward Manning Douglas (11 July 1875 – 14 February 1939) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Born in Gillingham, Medway, Douglas took the Scottish Triple Qualification (LRCP(Edin), LRCS(Edin), LRCPS(Glas) in 1898. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps on 28 July 1899, and travelled to South Africa following the outbreak of the Second Boer War three months later.

Douglas was 24 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the Second Boer War, when the following deed earned him the Victoria Cross at the Battle of Magersfontein, South Africa, on 11 December 1899:
Douglas was himself wounded by a bullet in the face at Magersfontein, and was invalided back home. He returned to South Africa only two months later, however, leaving Southampton in the SS &quot;Ottoman&quot; in late February 1900, and continued to serve until he returned to the United Kingdom in early 1901. He received the VC from King Edward VII during an investiture at Marlborough House on 25 July 1901. The following year he was appointed for light duty in the Home District, and promoted to captain on 28 July 1902.

He also served in the First World War and later achieved the rank of Major General. In October 1914, the Duchess of Wellington’s Hospital was opened at the Casino at La Touquet with a staff of sixty orderlies, nineteen Bart’s nurses and four qualified dressers. The chief surgeon was Major (later Sir) Charles Watson FRCS assisted by five Medical Officers. Its commandant was Major HEM Douglas RAMC, VC, DSO.

He is buried in Epsom. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum in Aldershot, England.

<text>Arthur Herbert Procter VC (11 August 1890 – 27 January 1973) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life and family ==
He was born in 1890, son of Arthur Richard Procter and his wife Ellen Cumpsty. He was educated at schools in Port Sunlight and Exeter. Beginning employment at Liverpool Corn Exchange, he was a clerk in the provision trade from 1904 until 1914, when in November he enlisted in the King&#x27;s Liverpool Regiment after the outbreak of the First World War.

In 1917 Procter married Hilda May Codd in Birkenhead. The couple had three sons.

== Award ==
He was 25 years old, and a private in the 1/5th Battalion, the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) (part of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 4 June 1916 near Ficheux, France, Private Procter noticed some movement on the part of two wounded men who were lying in full view of the enemy about 15 yards in front of the trenches. He at once went out on his own initiative and, although heavily fired at, ran and crawled to the two men, got them under cover of a small bank dressed their wounds and promised that they would be rescued after dark. He left them with warm clothing and then returned to the trenches, again being heavily fired at. The men were rescued at dusk.

Procter was the first British soldier to be decorated with the VC on the battlefield.

== Further information ==
After demobilisation in 1919, he returned to the provision trade where he worked as a salesman until 1926, when he took up full-time study for Church of England ministry at St Aidan&#x27;s College, Birkenhead.

He was ordained a deacon in 1927 and priest in 1928, while serving a curacy at St Mary&#x27;s, Prescot, Lancashire. From 1931 to 1933 he was Vicar of Bosley, and of St Stephen&#x27;s, Flowery Field, Hyde, (both then in Cheshire) from 1933 to 1944.

In the Second World War he served as a chaplain in the Royal Air Force from 1941 to 1946.

After the war he was successively Rector of St Mary, Droylsden, Manchester, from 1946 to 1951; Vicar of Claybrooke with Wibtoft, Leicestershire from 1951 to 1963, and of Bradworthy, Devon from 1963 to 1964. After retiring from full-time ministry, he lived in the later 1960s at Shrewsbury, Shropshire, where he was chaplain to the town&#x27;s British Legion branch and in 1966 he was one of seven winners of the VC who were invited by the Minister of Defence to attend the 50th anniversary Battle of the Somme celebrations in France. He later moved to Sheffield.

He died on 27 January 1973, aged 82, in Sheffield. He was cremated at Sheffield Crematorium in City Road and his ashes buried in All Saints Chapel at Sheffield Cathedral.

== Legacy ==

Blue plaques have been erected to him by Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Droylsden, and St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Hyde.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of the King&#x27;s Regiment, Liverpool, England.

<text>The Hobart Reception Centre, formerly the Hobart Remand Centre, an Australian maximum security prison for male and female inmates held on remand, is located in Hobart, Tasmania. The facility is operated by the Tasmanian Prison Service, an agency of the Department of Justice of the Government of Tasmania. The facility accepts felons charged under Tasmanian and/or Commonwealth legislation pending legal proceedings; and also detains convicted felons, pending their classification and placement at other correctional facilities in Tasmania.

==Facilities==
Opened in January 1999, the centre was built over five floors and accommodates 40 single-occupancy cells for persons awaiting trial, plus 10 cells for police watch house cases. All cells contain central heating, a shower, toilet and hand basin. Outdoor recreation space is provided in a secure area on the roof. The Remand Centre connects on one side directly to the Hobart Police Station and on the other side to the Courts of Petty Sessions, which greatly reduces prisoner movement.

In January 2007, nine inmates barricaded themselves inside the centre, resulting in police and prison officers in riot gear forcing entry after inmates went on a rampage, smashing windows and hurling objects. In 2010 it was revealed that the centre was holding inmates who were serving medium to long term sentences, including three inmates convicted of murder, two inmates convicted of rape, and one inmate convicted of armed robbery who has been held there for nine years.

<text>Arnold Loosemore (7 June 1896 – 10 April 1924) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
One of seven sons of a Sheffield gardener, Arnold Loosemore enlisted in the Army on 2 January 1915 aged 18 years and 7 months. Posted to the York and Lancaster Regiment, in July 1915 he left Liverpool for the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign arriving in Suvla Bay in August 1915. Surviving this campaign and returning home, he was then trained to use the Lewis machine gun. After this training, in July 1916 he was sent to the Somme in France to join the 8th Battalion of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s (West Riding) Regiment. In 1917 then aged 21 and a private, he was awarded the Victoria Cross and a year later the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

===Victoria Cross===
On 11 August 1917 south of Langemarck, Belgium, during the attack on a strongly held enemy position and his platoon having been held up by heavy machine-gun fire, Private Loosemore crawled through partially cut wire, dragging his Lewis machine-gun with him and single-handedly dealt with a strong party of the enemy, killing about 20 of them. Immediately afterwards his Lewis gun was destroyed and three of the enemy rushed at him, but he shot them with his revolver. Later he shot several enemy snipers, and on returning to the original post he brought back a wounded comrade under heavy fire.

===Distinguished Conduct Medal===
On 19 June 1918 at Zillebeke, Belgium when out with a fighting patrol he displayed conspicuous gallantry and powers of leadership when his officer was wounded and the platoon scattered by hostile bombs. He rallied the men and brought them back in order with all the wounded to friendly lines. On a subsequent occasion he handled his platoon with great skill and a complete disregard of his own danger under heavy machine gun fire. It was owing to his determination and powers of leadership that the platoon eventually captured the enemy post which they were attacking.

==Later life==

In August 1917 he was promoted to corporal by his commanding officer for gallantry in the field and in May 1918 was promoted to the rank of sergeant. On 13 October 1918 he was badly wounded by machine gun fire near Villiers-en-Cauchies in France and eventually had his left leg amputated above the knee. His health undermined by war wounds and unable to work, he died on 10 April 1924 from tuberculosis leaving a wife and small son. His wife Amy was refused a War Widows pension from the Government because he died after the war and she knew he was ill when she married him. Almost destitute; his wife had to have him buried in an existing grave with three others in order to save money.

==Legacy==
His Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medals were sold in 1969 to an Australian collector. In July 2023 the medals were sold again for £220,000.
In the early 1980s a street in the S12 area of Sheffield was named Loosemore Drive by the Lord Mayor. Soon afterwards a memorial plaque to mark this event was removed due to repeated vandalism. This missing plaque was replaced in December 2014 by a new bronze plaque.

<doc id="1218699" wikidata="Q5077280" url="?curid=1218699" title="Charles Hudson (VC)">
<text>Brigadier Charles Edward Hudson, (29 May 1892 – 4 April 1959) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Charles Edward Hudson was born in Derby on 29 May 1892, Oak Apple Day, the second son and third child of Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Edward Hudson of the Sherwood Foresters and his wife . He was educated at a preparatory school in East Grinstead, Surrey, and later at Sherborne School, Dorset, which he attended from September 1905 to July 1910. Charles did not stand out during his time at Sherborne School. He later recounted, in his journal published in the biography by his son, Miles Hudson, &quot;Two Lives 1892–1992&quot;, that being morbidly afraid of physical pain he was &quot;terribly conscious of being a coward on the football field&quot; and that it was not until he had been at Sherborne for some years that he was able to overcome these physical fears.

After leaving Sherborne, Hudson went to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, where he encountered Harold Alexander and admired him greatly, with the two becoming great friends, but was unable to finish the one-year course owing to the death of his father. Instead he went to Ceylon and from 1912 to 1914 worked as an apprentice tea planter, also engaged in the first experimental rubber planting on the island. There, he served part-time in the Ceylon Mounted Rifles, in an independent section formed of six young Europeans in the district he was working.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Hudson returned to England and was granted a commission as a temporary second lieutenant in his father&#x27;s regiment, the Sherwood Foresters, on 17 November 1914. He was made a temporary lieutenant on 8 February 1915, and a temporary captain on 11 October 1915, acting major on 21 November 1916, permanent captain in the Regular Army on 13 May 1917 and temporary lieutenant-colonel on 8 March 1918, ending the war as an acting lieutenant-colonel, having been promoted on 29 September.

He was posted to the newly raised 11th (Service) Battalion, a Kitchener&#x27;s Army unit, with whom he served in France and Belgium, most notably during the Battle of the Somme, and Italy from 1917, ending the war with the rank of temporary lieutenant-colonel, having been promoted to that rank on 23 November 1917, shortly after becoming Commanding Officer (CO) of his battalion, aged just 25. The battalion, composed largely of civilian volunteers from coalfields in the counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, formed part of the 70th Brigade of the 23rd Division and left for France in August 1915.

During the conflict he received numerous military honours: in 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross (MC), in 1917 the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Bar, and in 1918 the Victoria Cross (VC). He was also mentioned in despatches five times, on 15 June 1916, 30 May 1916, 21 December 1917, 6 January 1919, 9 July 1919 and 3 February 1920, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor. He was awarded a Bar to his DSO on 23 November 1917. The bar&#x27;s citation reads as follows:

At the age of just 26, Hudson was one of the youngest Old Shirburnians to be awarded the VC.

In &quot;Testament of Youth&quot;, Vera Brittain describes several meetings with the convalescent Hudson while she was trying to discover the circumstances of the death of her brother, Captain Edward Brittain, who had served under Hudson, and was killed on 15 June 1918 in the attack in which Hudson won his VC.

===VC action===
Hudson was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 15 June 1918 near Asiago, Italy, during the Second Battle of the Piave River, as a 26-year-old temporary lieutenant-colonel in command of the 11th Battalion Sherwood Foresters. The citation appeared in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 11 July 1918.
==Between the wars==
After the war, Hudson, against advice and having embarked with a US Navy ship, volunteered to serve in the North Russia Intervention during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, where he was deployed as a brigade staff officer under the command of Brigadier-General Edmund Ironside at Archangel.

Returning to England, in 1920 Hudson married Gladys Lee, from Glendale, Northumberland, who he had first met in London after having been wounded in Italy in 1918. They had two sons, John Patrick Charles, born on 11 April 1922, and Miles Matthew Lee, born on 17 August 1925. Their first years of marriage, spent in Derby, were difficult, and Hudson, initially unwilling to do so, chose to remain in the army, although the pay was barely sufficient, and both he and his wife had to live on army rations.

The first few years of Hudson&#x27;s service as a Regular Army officer were spent mainly on regimental duties, initially as adjutant to his regiment&#x27;s 3rd (Militia) Battalion, holding this post from 11 March 1920 until 10 March 1923. He attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1926 to 1927, where his fellow students included Harold Alexander, William Holden, Douglas Wimberley, Rob Lockhart, Richard Lewis, Roy Bucher, George Clark, Richard Bond, Eric Harrison, Sidney Archibald, George Wood, Reginald Nolder, Euan Miller, Brian Robertson and Noel Holmes, all of whom were to become general officers in the upcoming war. His instructors included men such as Wilfrid Lindsell, Bernard Paget, Ronald Adam, Alan Brooke and Bernard Montgomery, Robert Gordon-Finlayson, Henry Pownall and Harold Franklyn. Hudson&#x27;s time there was not particularly distinguished, and by the end of his first year he was almost dropped from the course, for being either consistently lazy or lacking in interest. Hudson was critical of, and often rebelled against, the methods his instructors used, believing them to not differ significantly from the methods used by the senior commanders in the Great War, which often failed with a heavy cost in human life. He furthermore believed that the Staff College&#x27;s training was inadequate if the army was to fight another major European war. His attitude was described by his instructors as awkward and often inclined to be pig-headed. Nevertheless, Hudson, for the most part, enjoyed his time there and he was recommended for future employment.

Soon after graduating from the Staff College, Hudson returned to his regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion, then stationed in Northern Ireland, serving there for six months, before he transferred on 27 July 1928 to the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB), with the rank of major, after being told that there was little chance of promotion in his own regiment. After serving with Malaya Command as a staff officer from 1930 to 1932, he was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1932. He became a Chief Instructor in the grade of General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst from 31 January 1933 until 31 January 1937. He then returned to the 2nd Battalion of his regiment, serving in the Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, before moving down to Portsmouth to become part of the 9th Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Bernard Montgomery, who had been one of Hudson&#x27;s Staff College instructors.

Hudson was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 30 April 1938 and, on 2 June, to the temporary rank of brigadier (and full colonel on the same date) and took command of the 2nd Brigade. The brigade was one of three which formed part of the 1st Infantry Division, whose General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General Harold Alexander, an old friend from Sandhurst and Camberley days. This move was initiated by Leslie Hore-Belisha, the new Secretary of State for War, who wanted to promote younger officers.

==Second World War==
Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Hudson led his brigade overseas to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The brigade, after several months of relative inactivity during the &quot;Phoney War&quot; period, saw action throughout May 1940, when the German Army launched its invasion of France, which resulted in the brigade, along with the rest of the BEF, being forced to retreat to Dunkirk, from where it was evacuated to England in late May/early June.

For his services in France and Belgium Hudson was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 11 July. With the threat of a German invasion of the United Kingdom, Hudson&#x27;s brigade, along with the rest of the division, now commanded by Major-General Kenneth Anderson after Alexander was promoted to command I Corps, commenced anti-invasion duties, including beach defence, until mid-December when Hudson received his first divisional command.

Promoted to the acting rank of major-general on 14 December, Hudson became GOC of the 46th Infantry Division, a second-line Territorial Army (TA) formation, taking over from Major-General Desmond Anderson. Formed in October 1939 as a duplicate of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, the 46th Division comprised the 137th, 138th and 139th Infantry Brigades, along with supporting divisional troops. The division, minus its divisional troops, had fought in France with the BEF, sustaining extremely heavy casualties due to its poor level of training, and after being evacuated, was then serving in Scotland under Scottish Command, reorganising after its heavy losses. Soon after Hudson became GOC, in early January 1941 the 46th Division moved to Cambridgeshire, then Norfolk, where it came under the command of Lieutenant-General Edmund Osborne&#x27;s II Corps, serving under Eastern Command and, like it had in Scotland, focused on reorganising and training to repel a German invasion, although then considered unlikely in winter. Hudson only held the command for just over five months, until May 1941, after a dispute with Osborne, his senior officer, which resulted in his demotion to the substantive rank of colonel, and he never again held a divisional command, nor regained his rank of major-general. Osborne, who, possibly envious of Hudson being the holder of a VC, interfered with Hudson&#x27;s command, writing to his battalion and brigade commanders without Hudson knowing, organising exercises, and visiting the division without informing its GOC. Hudson wrote an official letter of complaint. Osborne arrived, apologised and promised that he would no longer interfere, and went away on two weeks&#x27; leave. However, when he returned Hudson received an official report that he was, in his corps commander&#x27;s opinion, unfit to command a division. Hudson, following Osborne&#x27;s own advice, appealed, unsuccessfully, and he lost command of the division. He was succeeded as GOC of the 46th Division by Major-General Douglas Wimberley, a fellow student at the Staff College in the mid-1920s, who was sympathetic to Hudson&#x27;s plight. Hudson wrote that &quot;There are few blows in life which are more shattering than wounded pride. I felt personally shamed and disgraced. I had worn the insignia of a general long enough to become known to relatives, friends and acquaintances as such, and now I had to tell them that I had dropped to a rank lower than that I held before the war&quot;.

After his demotion, he briefly commanded the 159th Infantry Brigade, part of the TA 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, then serving in Northern Ireland, but was soon sent to command the 182nd Brigade, part of the 61st Infantry Division, another TA formation which was also serving as British Troops in Northern Ireland. The division returned to the mainland in February 1943, moving to Essex and took part in Exercise Spartan, and moved to Kent in May, and the division was initially selected to play a role in Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy, only to be reduced to the Lower Establishment soon after, becoming essentially a training formation with the intention of supplying replacements to overseas units. Handing over command of the 182nd Brigade to Brigadier John Nichols in late November, he became aide-de-camp to King George VI from 1944 until his retirement from the army in 1946.

==Postwar==
He was awarded the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Commander). He died on holiday in the Scilly Isles on 4 April 1959, at the age of 66, with the cause of death being coronary thrombosis. Hudson was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Denbury in South Devon.

An obituary for Brigadier Charles Edward Hudson was published in the &quot;Old Shirburnian Society Annual Report&quot; in September 1959, reading:
His medals are on display at Nottingham Castle.

==Writings==
Hudson wrote his memoirs in a 730-page journal later published by his son Miles in 1992. He also wrote many poems based on experiences as far back as childhood that were also unpublished in his lifetime, as were two radio plays (never produced), ten short stories and many reflections on secular subjects. His only work that was published in his lifetime was several chess problems that appeared in chess magazines.

<text>Prakash Singh Chib VC (1 April 1913 – 17 February 1945) was a British Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==

Chib was born in Dogra Chib Rajput Family in the Jammu and Kashmir region of the former British India, on 1 April 1913. He was 31 years old, and a Jemadar in the 14th Battalion, 13th Frontier Force Rifles in the Indian Army during World War II when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 16/17 February 1945 at Kanlan Ywathit, Burma (now Myanmar), Jemadar Prakash Singh Chib was commanding a platoon which took the main weight of fierce enemy attacks. He was wounded in both ankles and relieved of his command, but when his second-in-command was also wounded, he crawled back and took command of his unit again, directing operations and encouraging his men. He was wounded in both legs a second time but he continued to direct the defense, dragging himself from place to place by his hands. When wounded a third time and final time, he lay shouting the Dogra war-cry, &quot;&quot;Jawala Mata Ki Jai!&quot; [Glory to Goddess Jawala!]&quot; as he succumbed to his wounds, inspiring his company that finally drove off the enemy.

==Legacy==
A statue of Singh was built at the village of Nud, Tehsil Akhnoor in Jammu by the Chib Community under the guidance of Raghunath Singh Chib (IAS) of village Deva Batala, Tehsil- Bhimbar, Dist - Mirpur (whose family is in Jammu (India). In his memory, a function is celebrated every year in February. On this date Rs. 100000 (INR) is distributed to war widows (Veer Nariyan). The chairperson of this society is the Major General of 10 Div C/O 56 APO (Indian Army). His family lives in RAJBAG (ujh) KATHUA. His great-grandsons are Surinder Singh Chib

<text>Colonel Henry Lysons VC CB (30 July 1858 – 24 July 1907) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Family==
Lysons was a member of the Lysons family of Hemsted Park, Gloucestershire. He was the son of Gen. Sir Daniel Lysons, son of the antiquarian Daniel Lysons, and Harriet Sophia Bridges.

==Details==
Lysons was 20 years old, and a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, 90th Regiment of Foot, British Army during the Anglo-Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 March 1879 at the Hlobane Mountain, South Africa, Lieutenant Lysons, with a captain and a private (Edmund John Fowler) dashed forward in advance of the party which had been ordered to dislodge the enemy from a commanding position in natural caves up the mountain. The path was so narrow that they had to advance in single file and the captain who arrived first at the mouth of the cave was instantly killed. Lieutenant Lysons and the private, undeterred by the death of their leader, immediately sprang forward and cleared the enemy out of their stronghold.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of colonel in July 1904. His VC is displayed at the Cameronians Regimental Museum, Hamilton, Lanarkshire, Scotland

<text>Surgeon General Sir Anthony Dickson Home (30 November 1826 – 10 August 1914) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==

Home graduated from the University of St Andrews School of Medicine with an MD in 1848. Home was 30 years old, and a surgeon in the 90th Foot, British Army during the Indian Mutiny on 26 September 1857 at the Relief of Lucknow, India, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

In the early 1860s, Home was stationed in New Zealand and fought in the New Zealand Wars. He was awarded a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and achieved the rank of surgeon general.

Arthur Conan Doyle worked with him a few times and stated that, &quot;..he seemed a most disagreeable old man...and yet when I married shortly afterwards he sent me a most charming message wishing me good fortune...&quot;

Home died on 10 August 1914 and was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum, Mytchett, Surrey.

<doc id="1218709" wikidata="Q3307440" url="?curid=1218709" title="List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom, Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories">
<text>There are a number of agencies that participate in law enforcement in the United Kingdom which can be grouped into three general types:

* Territorial police forces, who carry out the majority of policing. These are police forces that cover a police area (a particular region) and have an independent police authority. Current police forces have their grounding in the Police Act 1996 (in England and Wales), a combination of Police (Scotland) Act 1967 and Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (in Scotland) and the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (in Northern Ireland), which prescribe a number of issues such as appointment of a chief constable, jurisdiction and responsibilities.
* National law enforcement bodies, including the National Crime Agency and national police forces that have a specific, non-regional jurisdiction, such as the British Transport Police. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 refers to these as &#x27;special police forces&#x27;, not including the NCA which is not a police force. In addition, there are non-police law enforcement agencies, whose officers are not police officers, but still enforce laws, and other bodies with solely investigatory powers.
* Miscellaneous police bodies, mostly having their foundations in older legislation or common law. These are responsible for policing specific local areas or activities, such as ports and parks. Before the passing of recent legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, they were often referred to as &#x27;special police forces&#x27;; care must therefore be taken in interpreting historical use of that phrase. These constabularies are not within the scope of the legislation applicable to the previously mentioned organisations but can still be the subject of statutes applicable to, for example, docks, harbours or railways. Until the passing of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003, the British Transport Police was such a force.

Most law enforcement in the United Kingdom is carried out by territorial police forces that police the general public and their activities. The other types of agencies are concerned with policing of more specific matters.

Over the centuries there has been a wide variation in the number of police forces in the United Kingdom, with a large number now no longer in existence.

==Territorial police forces==

Most policing in the United Kingdom is conducted by the 45 territorial police forces of the 4 nations in one of three legal criminal jurisdictions - England &amp; Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. These forces are ultimately responsible for all law and order within their respective police area (a legal term which defines the geographic area of primary responsibility). This is not the same as legal jurisdiction, see below. Two nations of the United Kingdom, Scotland and Northern Ireland, have national police forces. The third legal jurisdiction, made up of the nations of England and Wales is split up into a number of police forces. The breakdown of all territorial police forces across the United Kingdom by jurisdiction is as follows:

* 43 territorial police forces in England &amp; Wales
* 1 territorial police force in Scotland
* 1 territorial police force in Northern Ireland

===England and Wales===
Except in Greater London, each territorial police force covers one or more of the local government areas (counties) established in the 1974 local government reorganisations (although with subsequent modifications), in an area known in statute as a police area. These forces provide most of the policing services to the public of England and Wales. These forces have been known historically as &quot;Home Office police forces&quot; due to the central government department, the Home Office, being responsible for and providing most of the funding these police forces. Despite the implication of the term, all police forces are independent, with operational control resting solely with the chief officer of each force (the chief constable or with regard to the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police forces, their respective Commissioners); each force was overseen by a police authority until these were replaced by police and crime commissioners in 2012.

The Police Act 1996 is the most recent piece of legislation, which outlines the areas of responsibility for the 43 territorial forces of England and Wales (found in Schedule 1 of the Act).

Constable is the lowest rank in the police service, but all officers, whatever their rank, are &quot;constables&quot; in terms of legal powers and jurisdiction. Police officers in territorial police forces in England and Wales derive their jurisdiction from Section 30 of the Police Act 1996. This section outlines that such officers have jurisdiction throughout England and Wales and also the adjacent United Kingdom waters. Special constables, who are part-time, volunteer officers of these forces, used to have a more limited jurisdiction – limited solely to their own force areas and adjacent forces. Since 1 April 2007, however special constables of England and Wales have full police powers throughout those two countries. This means that, in contrast to most countries, all UK volunteer police officers now have exactly the same powers as their full-time colleagues. There are a number of situations in which the jurisdiction of a constable extends to one of the other countries, and constables of one jurisdiction do have reciprocal powers of arrest in each other&#x27;s jurisdictions as a matter of course see the main article for details.

===Scotland===
Most police powers and functions have been inherited by the Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament from the Scottish Office. Areas for which legislative responsibility remains with the UK Government include national security, terrorism, firearms and drugs. The Police (Scotland) Act 1967, as amended, was the basis for the organisation and jurisdiction of the eight former territorial forces in Scotland that were formed in 1975. These forces covered one or more of the areas of the local government regions established in the 1975 local government reorganisation (and since abolished), with minor adjustments to align with the post-1996 council area borders. These forces provided most of the police services to the public of Scotland, although Scottish police officers also have limited jurisdiction throughout the rest of the United Kingdom as required (See above comments under English and Welsh forces).

In 2011, the Scottish Government announced that it planned to amalgamate the eight territorial forces in Scotland, along with the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, into a single agency. The Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012, an Act of the Scottish Parliament, codified this amalgamation and brought about the new Police Service of Scotland (to be known as &quot;Police Scotland&quot;). The new force was established on 1 April 2013.

In 2017, plans were being debated in the Scottish Parliament to merge railway policing with Police Scotland.

As of December 2019, police numbers in Scotland were:
*Police officers: 17,259
*Special constables: 531
*Other staff: 6,168

===Northern Ireland===
County and borough based police forces were not formed in Ireland as they were in Great Britain, with instead a single Royal Irish Constabulary covering most of Ireland (the exceptions being the Dublin Metropolitan Police, which was responsible for policing in Dublin, and the Londonderry Borough Police and Belfast Town Police, both replaced by the RIC in the late Victorian period). The Royal Ulster Constabulary was formed in 1922 after the establishment of the Irish Free State, and served until the reforms of the police under the terms established initially by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 undertaken by the Patten Commission, which led to dissolution of the RUC in 2001. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 sets out the basis for the organisation and function of the police force in the province. Until 2010, police powers were not transferred to the devolved Northern Ireland Executive, unlike Scotland, instead remaining with the Northern Ireland Office. However, in January 2010 agreement was reached between the two largest parties in the Assembly, the DUP and Sinn Féin, over a course that would see them assume responsibility for policing and justice from April.

As of April 2007 police numbers in Northern Ireland were:
*Police officers: 7,216
*Full-time reserve police officers: 335
*Part-time police officers: 684
*Other staff: 2,265

=== National Collaborative Units ===

==== Bodies hosted by the National Police Chiefs&#x27; Council (NPCC) ====
*National Wildlife Crime Unit – A police unit run by the NPCC that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to law enforcement agencies across the United Kingdom.
*National Counter Terrorism Security Office – A police unit run by the NPCC, which advises the British government on its counter terrorism strategy.
*National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service – A police unit run by the NPCC, tasked with combating organised vehicle crime and the use of vehicles in crime.

==== Bodies hosted by territorial police forces ====
*National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit – A police unit that is part of the Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Operations Directorate, tasked with coordinating police response to domestic extremism across the United Kingdom.
*Protection Command – A police unit that is part of the Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Operations Directorate, responsible for providing protective security to the government/diplomatic community and the Royal Family within the United Kingdom.
*National Fraud Intelligence Bureau – A police unit hosted by the City of London Police, tasked with combating economic crime throughout the United Kingdom.
*National Ballistics Intelligence Service (Great Britain) – A police unit hosted by West Midlands Police, tasked with gathering and disseminating fast time intelligence on the criminal use of firearms across Great Britain.
*National Police Air Service (England and Wales) – A police aviation service hosted by West Yorkshire Police, that provides centralised air support to all police forces in England and Wales.

==Special police forces==

The following three government agencies are defined in legislation as &quot;special police forces&quot;. As these forces are responsible to specific areas of infrastructure, they do not answer to the Home Office, but instead to the government department responsible for the area they police. All three forces do voluntarily submit themselves to HMIC inspection:
*Ministry of Defence Police – A police force tasked with providing armed security, uniformed policing, and investigative services to Ministry of Defence installations throughout the United Kingdom.
*Civil Nuclear Constabulary – A police force responsible for providing law enforcement and security at or within 5 km of any relevant nuclear site and for nuclear materials in transit within the United Kingdom.
*British Transport Police (Great Britain) – A police force responsible for providing law enforcement at certain railways and light-rail systems in Great Britain.

The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 gave the British Transport Police and Ministry of Defence Police a limited, conditional authority to act outside of their primary jurisdiction, if the situation requires urgent police action and the local force are not readily available, &quot;or&quot; if they believe that there is risk to life or limb, &quot;or&quot; where they are assisting the local force.

==Non-police force law enforcement==

=== Uniformed and/or investigative ===
*National Crime Agency (NCA) – An agency that leads UK-wide activities to combat high-level crime such as organised crime. In addition, the NCA acts as the UK point of contact for foreign law enforcement agencies. It replaced the Serious Organised Crime Agency in 2013.
*Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) – a Home Office investigative agency for labour exploitation, also working with other agencies on organised crime. GLAA officers have powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 akin to those of in police contables in relation to their narrow remit.
*His Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) – employs customs officers with law enforcement powers to carry out uniformed (e.g. combatting misuse of red diesel) and investigative work (in the Criminal Investigation Branch). They exercise the powers granted under the Customs Management Acts and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, including arrest, search and detention of people and goods.
*Border Force (BF) – a law enforcement command within the Home Office, responsible for frontline border control operations at air, sea and rail ports. Border Force officers are dual-warranted as immigration and customs officers. They have powers of arrest and detention under the Immigration Act 1971 and Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. Designated immigration officers have additional powers from the UK Borders Act 2007, allowing them to arrest a person suspected of non-border offences and detain for a certain period until a police constable can take custody of the person.
*Immigration Enforcement (IE) – a law enforcement command within the Home Office, responsible for preventing abuse, tracking immigration offenders and increasing compliance with immigration law across the UK.
*Environment Agency, in England, and Natural Resources Wales, in Wales, Fisheries Enforcement Officers have the powers of a constable in relation to the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975. Officers in Scotland are appointed by the District Salmon Fishery Boards, to enforce the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 2003. FEOs protect fish and combat related crime (e.g. poaching).
*His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service (HMPS) is responsible for managing most prisons in England and Wales. Its Prison Officers, whilst acting as such, have &quot;all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of a constable&quot;. Prisons in Northern Ireland and Scotland are managed by the Northern Ireland Prison Service and Scottish Prison Service, respectively.

===Bodies with limited executive powers===
*Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (Great Britain)
*Driver and Vehicle Agency (Northern Ireland)
*The Independent Office for Police Conduct (England and Wales) investigates complaints against police officers and staff of the police forces in England and Wales, and staff of HM Revenue and Customs, the National Crime Agency in England and Wales, the Border Force and officers from the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority. Certain investigators of the IOPC, for the purposes of the carrying out of an investigation and all purposes connected with it, have all the powers and privileges of constables throughout England and Wales and the territorial waters.

===Bodies with solely investigatory powers===

The use of investigatory powers is controlled by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Up to 792 public authorities have powers that are restricted by RIPA.
*Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism
*Security Service
*Serious Fraud Office (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)

==Miscellaneous police forces==
These police forces generally come under the control of a local authority, public trusts or even private companies; examples include some ports police and the Mersey Tunnels Police. They could have been established by individual acts of Parliament or under common law powers. Jurisdiction is generally limited to the relevant area of private property alone and in some cases (e.g. docks and harbours) the surrounding area. This, together with the small size of the police forces, means they are often reliant on the territorial force for the area under whose jurisdiction they fall to assist with any serious matter. The statutory responsibility for law and order sits with the territorial police forces even if there is a specialist police force in the locality. These police forces do not have independent police authorities and their founding statutes (if any) do not generally prescribe their structure and formation.

===Ports police===
There are two types of port police in the United Kingdom — most are sworn in under the 1847 act, but a few have acts specific to their port.

;Ports police operating under the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847
For every port/harbour, an individual act of Parliament (or, more recently, a Harbour (Revision) Order) can incorporate parts of the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847 (HDPCA) and apply them to that specific port/harbour. Officers of port police forces are sworn in as &quot;special constables&quot; under section 79 of the 1847 Act, as incorporated by the individual local Act. As a result, officers have the full powers of a constable on any land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land.

The Marine Navigation Act 2013 has potentially enabled ports constables in England &amp; Wales to act as constables beyond this one mile limit, in relation to policing purposes connected with the port only, in a police area where consent has been obtained from the relevant chief constable. This act does not however give general police powers to ports constables beyond their core jurisdiction as set out in the 1847 act, merely in relation to policing purposes connected to the port as set out in the Act. As of 2014, three ports police forces (Dover, Teesport and Bristol) have sought and received consent from the local chief constable, with a fourth (Liverpool) in the process of applying for it. This has enabled these three ports forces to act as constables, in relation to policing purposes connected to the port, throughout the police area in which they are geographically located. There are 224 constables sworn in under the 1847 act. Serious or major incidents or crime generally become the responsibility of the local territorial police force.

* Belfast Harbour Police — Belfast Harbour, Belfast: HDPCA incorporated by section 5 of the Belfast Harbour Act 1847.
* Port of Bristol Police — Port of Bristol, which includes Avonmouth Docks and Royal Portbury Dock
* Port of Felixstowe Police — Port of Felixstowe, Suffolk: HDPCA incorporated by section 3(1)(e) of the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Act 1956.
*Port of Portland Police — Portland Harbour, Isle of Portland: HDPCA incorporated by section 3 of the Portland Harbour Revision Order 1997.
* Falmouth Docks Police — Falmouth Docks, Falmouth, Cornwall: HDPCA incorporated by section 3 of the Falmouth Docks Act 1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2. c. xl).
* Port of Dover Police — Port of Dover, Dover: HDPCA incorporated by section 3 of the Dover Harbour Consolidation Act 1954, and incorporation amended by part 4 of the Dover Harbour Revision Order 2006. Given the large amount of property owned by the port, their jurisdiction effectively extends to all of Dover and now throughout Kent (in relation to port policing matters only) in order to be able to take arrested persons to custody suites.

;Other ports police
* Port of Liverpool Police — Port of Liverpool, Liverpool: current authority derives from article 3 of the Mersey Docks and Harbour (Police) Order 1975. Port of Liverpool police officers are Crown police officers and not special constables.
* Port of Tilbury Police (formerly the Port of London Authority Police) — Port of Tilbury, Essex: current authority derives from section 154 of the Port of London Act 1968
* Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Harbour Police — Tees and Hartlepool: current authority derives from section 103 of the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Act 1966
* A large, new port on the Thames Estuary (and within the Port of London area) called &quot;London Gateway&quot;, the owners have the authority to create their own police force for the port. The legislation also incorporates section 79 of the 1847 act.

===Parks police===

====Parks not controlled by local authorities====
These small constabularies are responsible for policing specific land and parks. Officers of these forces have the powers of a constable within their limited jurisdiction. They are not &quot;constables&quot; as dealt with in the general Police Acts.
* Epping Forest Keepers
*:Current powers derive from regulations made under Epping Forest Act 1878
* Kew Constabulary (formerly Royal Botanic Gardens Constabulary)
*:Constables of this force have full police powers whilst on land belonging to the Royal Botanical Gardens as per the Parks Regulation Act 1872 as amended by section 3 (a) of the Parks Regulation (Amendment) Act 1974.

The Parks Regulation Act 1872 provides for the attestation of &quot;parks constables&quot;.

====Parks controlled by local authorities====
Over history, a number of local authorities outside London have maintained their own parks police forces, the most notable being Liverpool (Liverpool Parks Police) and Birmingham (Birmingham Parks Police). No local authority parks police forces currently exist outside London, although the legal powers for them to do so (granted by various local Acts of Parliament) survive in a limited number of cases.

There are some remnant organisations of the old Parks Constabularies/Parks Police, such as the Birmingham Parks Ranger Patrol.

In London, these constabularies are responsible for enforcing byelaws within the parks and open spaces of their respective local authorities. Members of the constabularies are sworn as constables under article 18 of the Greater London Parks and Open Spaces Order 1967. Members of the constabularies are constables only in relation to the enforcement of the parks byelaws (which, by definition, apply only in the parks).

*Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Parks Police
* Hampstead Heath Constabulary (HHC), also appointed under section 16 of the Corporation of London (Open Spaces) Act 1878 with the full powers and privileges of police constables within their limited jurisdiction.
* Havering Parks Constabulary
* Wandsworth Parks and Events Police

Some of these constables have (or have had) a shared role as security staff for their own local authority&#x27;s buildings and housing estates with appropriate changes of badges and/or uniform being made when changing to/from park duties.

===Cathedral constables===

Cathedrals that have their own Constabularies consisting of attested constables that keep the peace at each Cathedral.
* York Minster Police
* Chester Cathedral Constables
* Canterbury Cathedral Close Constables
* Liverpool Cathedral Constables

===Market police===
Traditionally, markets would employ constables to look after markets. Most no longer exist, or exist in a form without attested constables (see below).

* The City of London market constabularies are three small constabularies responsible for security at Billingsgate, New Spitalfields and Smithfield markets run by the City of London Corporation. However, unlike most other miscellaneous police organisations, the members are no longer attested as constables.

===Other===
* Belfast International Airport Constabulary – attested under article 19(3) of the Airports (Northern Ireland) Order 1994 as constables for the airport, which employs them.
* Cambridge University Constabulary – attested under the Universities Act 1825 as constables within the university precincts and up to four miles from them.
* Mersey Tunnels Police – attested under section 105 of the County of Merseyside Act 1980 (c. x) as constables within a jurisdiction of the tunnels and all approach roads.

==Military and service police==
===Service (Military) Police===

Each branch of the military has its own &quot;service police&quot;, though the powers of a service policeman are identical and reciprocal across all three services. The service police is made up of the:
*Royal Navy Police
**Royal Marines Police
*Royal Military Police
*Royal Air Force Police
In the UK, the service police exercise jurisdiction over those serving in the military in any capacity and those civilians subject to service discipline as defined by the Armed Forces Act 2006. They are not &#x27;constables&#x27; and do not have any policing powers in relation to the general public in normal circumstances. In British Forces Germany, under the Status Of Forces Act, military police have jurisdiction over British Forces personnel, their families, MOD contractors, and NAAFI staff.

Service Police are Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) trained and all investigations are PACE compliant. They make regular use of civilian police facilities often conducting joint investigations where necessary. The Service Police are able to investigate all crime within their jurisdiction, up to and including Murder, however within the UK, offences of murder and sudden deaths are passed to the local police force as per national jurisdiction agreements.

Whilst operating in conflict zones, the military police will conduct the full range of policing including murder investigations as evidenced by the Sgt Blackman investigation.

===Defence security organisations===
Other agencies exist to provide security to MOD and military bases in the UK and abroad.
* Northern Ireland Security Guard Service (NISGS) – Civilian Security Officers belonging to the Northern Ireland Security Guard Service are attested as Special Constables. They are armed, as is customary in Northern Ireland for security forces.
* Germany Guard Service (GGS) - MOD uniformed civilian security officers providing armed security and access control to British Forces Germany units
* Military Provost Guard Service (MPGS) - part of the Army Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps, tasked with armed security at military establishments in mainland UK.
* Ministry of Defence Guard Service (MGS) - civilian unarmed security officers providing security and access control at MOD and some military establishments.

==Bodies with limited enforcement powers==
There are also non-police (of any type) organisations who have been given certain powers to enforce rules, regulations and laws.

#Under the community safety accreditation scheme (CSAS) and the similar railway safety accreditation scheme (RSAS), police forces in England and Wales have the power to grant limited powers to official persons (such as council wardens and private security staff), for example, the power to confiscate alcohol from under 18s.
#Under the national railway byelaws, any &#x27;authorised person&#x27; may ensure all persons on the railway are abiding by the byelaws. Generally, railway train operating companies (TOCs) leave this to dedicated enforcement officers. Sometimes these officers will have powers under the Railway safety accreditation scheme and as they are working for the railway, they also have powers under the railway byelaws.

Under the community safety accreditation scheme (CSAS), there are many different people involved, such as council staff, park rangers or private security staff that work for councils and local authorities and many different titles are used:

;Community based
;Railway based
&quot;(Officers with powers under both national byelaws and RSAS)&quot;

*Protection officer
*Rail neighbourhood officer

==Crown Dependencies==
The Crown Dependencies are three offshore island territories that are self-governing possessions of the British Crown. Although not sovereign British territory, their administration is similar to the British Overseas Territories.

===Isle of Man===
* The Isle of Man Constabulary () is the police service of the Isle of Man.
* The Isle of Man Prison and Probation Service runs the Isle of Man Prison, the only prison on the island.
* Isle of Man Customs and Excise Division is tasked with customs duties on the island.

;Defunct
* The Isle of Man Airport Police policed the main Isle of Man Airport (in Ronaldsway), with officers who were &quot;warranted constables&quot; under the Isle of Man Airports and Civil Aviation Act. Disbanded September 2019.

===Bailiwick of Jersey===
* The States of Jersey Police () is the police service of Jersey. It was established in its current form by the Police Force (Jersey) Law, 1974 and consists of around 240 officers.

* States of Jersey Customs and Immigration Service
* Honorary Police – There is an Honorary Police (French: ) force in each parish in Jersey. Honorary Police officers have, for centuries, been elected by parishioners to assist the Connétable of the Parish to maintain law and order, and to this day the only person who may charge a person with an offence is the Centenier of the parish in which the offence allegedly took place. Officers are elected as Centeniers, Vingteniers or Constable&#x27;s Officers, each with various duties and responsibilities.
* Jersey Prison Service, responsible for running the HM Prison La Moye.

===Bailiwick of Guernsey===
* The States of Guernsey Police Service () is the local police force for the Crown dependency of Guernsey. In addition to providing police for the island of Guernsey itself, the Guernsey Police also provides detachments for the islands of Alderney, Herm and Sark.
* Guernsey Border Agency, responsible with policing cross border and financial crime, customs and immigration.
* Guernsey Prison Service, responsible for running HMP Guernsey, the main prison on the island.

==Overseas Territories==

The British Overseas Territories (BOTs) are British sovereign territory, mostly islands, within most of which most competencies (aspects of governance) are delegated to local administrations, but for which the government of the United Kingdom is ultimately responsible and retains responsibility for serious matters, such as defence and security, with police forces directly under the control of the governor.

Consequently, law enforcement in these territories closely mirrors the UK, with some influence from other nations. Some of these agencies are very old and were setup centuries ago.

===Civil police===
Almost all BOTs have a civil police force. Some forces may serve more than one island or territory. See below for details.

&quot;N.B. &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s&quot; is often shortened to HM&quot;.

==Overseas law enforcement in the UK==
There are certain instances where police forces of other nations operate in a limited degree in the United Kingdom:
* – Under an agreement between the British Government and the Irish Government and under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Garda Síochána and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are allowed to inspect the Sellafield nuclear facility in Cumbria.
* – As part of the Channel Tunnel agreement between the British and French governments, the Police aux Frontières maintains a presence at St. Pancras International, Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International railway stations and on Eurostar trains. The British Transport Police have a reciprocal arrangement at the Gare du Nord in Paris. The Police aux Frontieres also maintain a presence at passport control at the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone and at Dover port, whilst Kent Police maintains a presence at Coquelles on the French side of the tunnel. Similar arrangements allow the Border Force to operate juxtaposed controls in France and Belgium.
*Military police of visiting forces while present within the terms of the Visiting Forces Act 1952.
*Chinese service stations in Croydon, Hendon and Glasgow are not legally recognised or permitted by the UK Government to undertake any form of Law Enforcement activities.

<text>A draisine () is a light auxiliary rail vehicle, driven by service personnel, equipped to transport crew and material necessary for the maintenance of railway infrastructure.

The eponymous term is derived from the German inventor Baron Karl Drais, who invented his &quot;Laufmaschine&quot; (German for &quot;running machine&quot;) in 1817, which was called &quot;Draisine&quot; in German (&quot;vélocipède&quot; or &quot;draisienne&quot; in French) by the press. It is the first reliable claim for a practically used precursor to the bicycle, basically the first commercially successful two-wheeled, steerable, human-propelled machine, nicknamed hobby-horse or dandy horse.

Later, the name draisine came to be applied only to the invention used on rails and was extended to similar vehicles, even when not human-powered. Because of their low weight and small size, they can be put on and taken off the rails at any place, allowing trains to pass.

In the United States, motor-powered draisines are known as speeders while human-powered ones are referred as handcars. Vehicles that can be driven on both the highway and the rail line are called road–rail vehicles, or (after a trademark) Hy-Rails.

== Dressin, velorail, trolley, or railbike ==
&quot;Draisines&quot;, called &quot;dressin&quot; in Swedish, &quot;dresin&quot; in Norwegian, &quot;dræsine&quot; in Danish, and &quot;resiina&quot; in Finnish, refers to pedal-powered rail-cycles which were used by railroad maintenance workers in Finland, Sweden, and Norway until about 1950, as handcars were elsewhere.

Draisines nowadays are used for recreation on several unused railway lines in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Poland, some other European countries and South Korea. Several companies rent draisines in Sweden. In the United States, railbike tours have operated in several states nationwide: California, Maine, Oregon, the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, and Delaware.

Until 2007, Finland hosted an annual competition, &quot;Resiina-ralli&quot; (&quot;Draisine Rally&quot;), involving several draisine teams travelling for many days on the railways from one corner of the country to another.
== Types ==
== Automotive draisines ==
== Military use ==

The military use of draisines concerned, first of all, armoured draisines. They were light armoured rail motor vehicles, intended for reconnaissance, scouting, track patrolling, and other auxiliary combat tasks, usually belonging to armoured trains. Early vehicles of this kind were built in Russia during World War I. Later, often armoured cars were used as armoured draisines, after exchanging their wheels to railroad ones, or fitting them with additional retractable railroad rollers. Some countries, however, manufactured purpose-built armoured draisines between the wars, such as the USSR and Czechoslovakia. Peculiar vehicles were Polish armoured draisines - they were tanks or tankettes fitted with special rail chassis, able to be used on rails or on the ground, leaving the rail chassis on the rails. 

Some countries developed railtrack armoured draisines, with retractable railroad wheels; they were not widely used, however. Different armoured draisines were used during the Second World War, starting from the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany.

Prior to World War II, the Japanese Empire had already made extensive use of draisines such as the Sumida M.2593 in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the Sino-Japanese War. From 1952, the Wikham Armoured Trolley was used by British security forces during the Malayan Emergency.

== Construction ==
People have been putting bicycles on railroad tracks ever since there have been both bicycles and railroads. From time to time, factory-built models have been available, beginning with a device marketed in 1908 through the Sears catalogue for just US$5.45 ().

There are many designs of draisine. However, certain fundamentals of railbike design must be adhered to, foremost among them the reconciliation of a bicycle&#x27;s stability with adaptation to riding on a railway track: bicycles are kept upright by the rider steering in the direction of an impending fall, but this ability is sacrificed when the bicycle is constrained by rails. Simply adding flanged wheels to a conventional bicycle would make it impossible to balance, so the typical approach to stabilization is to add an outrigger, with roller(s), across to the second rail from near the bicycle’s rear wheel. Even such an outrigger system is not without its complications, as tracks that are no longer perfectly parallel — common on sections of abandoned track — can result in derailment. Additional guide rollers can help alleviate this problem at the expense of greater weight.

<text>George Allan Maling VC (6 October 1888 – 9 July 1929) was an English medical doctor and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Descended from the Maling pottery family, Maling was born at Carlton House in Bishopwearmouth, County Durham (now part of Sunderland), the youngest of nine children of Edwin Allan Maling (1838–1920), a general practitioner, and his wife Maria Jane, née Hartley (1847–1932). His paternal grandmother was a first cousin of Sir Henry Havelock. His mother&#x27;s family originated from Scotland and had established a glassmaking business in Sunderland in the 1830s. Maling was educated at Uppingham School and graduated with honours in natural sciences from Exeter College, Oxford. He continued his studies at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, qualifying MB BCh in 1914, then MRCS and LRCP in 1915.

After the initial outbreak of the First World War, Maling gained a temporary commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps as a 26-year-old Lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps on 18 January 1915. After five months he joined the 12th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) as their medical officer. The following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 25 September 1915 near Fauquissart, France Lieutenant Maling worked for over 24 hours with untiring energy, collecting and treating in the open, under heavy shell fire, more than 300 men. During the morning of the 25th he was temporarily stunned by the bursting of a large high-explosive shell which wounded his only assistant and killed several of his patients. A second shell covered him and his instruments with debris, but he continued his gallant work single-handed.

Maling was mentioned in despatches and promoted to Captain in 1916. He then returned to the UK and served in the Military Hospital in Grantham. He later joined the 34th Field Ambulance of the 11th (Northern) Division and served again in France for two years.

On 5 May 1917, Maling married Daisy Mabel Wolmer (1891–1973), originally from Winnipeg, at Sutton, Surrey and they had four children:

*John Allan MC (1920–2012), served in the Second World War and also became a doctor. Married Daphne Judith (&quot;Judy&quot;) Haines in 1952 and had issue.
*Phyllis Mary (1922–2008), married Richard David Mortlock (1923–1976) and had issue.
*Edwin Lambton (1922–1941), died suddenly, aged 19, at the Royal Hospital School after recently enrolling in the Royal Navy.
*Barbara (1926–1949)

After the war, George was appointed resident Medical Officer at the Victoria Hospital for Children at Chelsea. He then set up a practice in Lee and was also appointed a surgeon to outpatients at St. John&#x27;s Hospital, Lewisham.

==Death and legacy==
Maling died on 9 July 1929, aged 40, after suffering from pleurisy and was buried in Chislehurst Cemetery. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum, Aldershot. On 25 September 2015, a commemorative paving stone was placed at the base of Sunderland War Memorial, to mark 100 years since Maling was awarded the Victoria Cross.

<text>Louis McGuffie VC (15 March 1893 – 4 October 1918) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He is a soldier with The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. He was awarded the VC for his actions in late September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive of the First World War. He was killed in action a few days later.

==Early life==
Louis McGuffie was born on 15 March 1893 in Wigtown, a town in Galloway, Scotland. He was one of four sons born to Edward McGuffie and Catherine . He attended Wigtown Public School and then joined the British Army. He enlisted in the 1/5th Battalion of The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. He had three brothers who also enlisted.

==First World War==
McGuffie served with the 1/5th Battalion in the Gallipoli Campaign as part of the 52nd Division. After the evacuation from Gallipoli, he participated with the battalion in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign before it was transferred to the Western Front in France.

By the time of the Hundred Days Offensive, he was a sergeant. With the battalion part of 103rd Brigade, 34th Division, on 28 September 1918 it was involved in attacks on Wytschaete Ridge, near Ypres, as part of the Fifth Battle of Ypres. McGuffie had taken command of a platoon due to its officers becoming casualties and helped deal with a strongpoint known as Picadilly Farm, as well as several other German-occupied posts that were delaying the advance. Wytschaete Ridge was captured the following day. However, McGuffie was killed in action a few days later on 4 October 1918. For his actions on 28 September 1918, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation read as follows:
McGuffie is buried in Zantvoorde British Cemetery, near Ypres, in Belgium. King George V presented McGuffie&#x27;s VC to his mother in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 17 May 1919. In his memory, a tablet was laid into the wall of the Wigtown County building in late 1919. His name is also listed on the Wigtown War Memorial.

One hundred years to the day after the events which earned Sgt McGuffie his Victoria Cross, on 28 September 2018 a paving stone and commemorative archway, commissioned by Wigtown Community Council, were unveiled at the entrance to Wigtown&#x27;s Louis McGuffie VC Memorial Gardens, which includes the town&#x27;s lawn bowling green and lawns.

==The medal==
In 1971, a family member donated McGuffie&#x27;s VC and other campaign medals, which included the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal, to the Regimental Museum of The Kings Own Scottish Borderers, Berwick upon Tweed in Northumberland.

<text>Rodney Howard Hilton (17 November 1916 – 7 June 2002) was an English Marxist historian of the late medieval period and the transition from feudalism to capitalism.

==Biography==

Hilton was born in Middleton in Lancashire. His father, John James Hilton, was a weaver who later became the manager of the local Co-operative Society; his mother was also a weaver who had started work at the age of 12. Hilton studied at Manchester Grammar School and won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford in 1935. There he joined the student branch of the Communist Party. The influence of his tutors V. H. Galbraith and R. W. Southern drew him to medieval history. He acquired a first-class degree in modern history in 1938, was a Harmsworth Senior Scholar at Merton College, Oxford 1939-1940, and took his DPhil in 1940, writing his dissertation on The Economic Development of Some Leicestershire Estates in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries. In 1939 he married fellow student and communist Margaret Palmer. Their only child, Tim Hilton, was born in 1941.

He entered the army in 1940, serving as a regimental officer 46th battalion of the Royal Tank Regiment. During World War II he was posted at first in Italy, then in Egypt, Palestine and Lebanon. His communist allegiances had attracted the interest of British military intelligence and during his service, his superiors were tasked with monitoring and recording his movements.

Returning to England, in 1946 Hilton co-founded the Communist Party Historians Group and was appointed to a lectureship at the University of Birmingham, where he remained until his retirement in 1982. Together with other CPHG members and non-Marxist historians, he founded the journal &quot;Past and Present&quot; in 1952. He continued to be monitored by police and MI5, who recorded his phone calls and opened his mail. Hilton was among many who resigned from the Communist Party in 1956 over the Soviet invasion of Hungary and became involved with the emerging British New Left. In 1963 he was made professor of medieval and social history, and in 1973 joined the editorial board of the newly formed &quot;Journal of Peasant Studies&quot;.

Hilton married his second wife Gwyneth Joan Evans in 1951 (although his son Tim suggests that Rodney and Margaret went on holiday to France when he was 11, which would have been in 1952), and together they had two children, Owen and Ceinwen. However, their marriage did not last, and in 1971 he married fellow historian Jean Birrell, who would survive him.

His students included Peter Coss and Christopher Dyer.

His papers are held at the University of Birmingham Special Collections.

<text>Karamjeet Singh Judge VC (25 May 1923 – 18 March 1945) was an Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==
His father was chief of police at Kapurthala. Karamjeet was a member of the Indian National Congress Party. He regarded his brother Ajeet Singh Judge as a patriot for joining the Royal Indian Artillery. He seems to have been persuaded to join the army rather than continue political studies at Lahore College. Thus he enrolled for Officer Training School, Bangalore. He opted to join the Pioneer corps to get near the Burma front-line. At his brother&#x27;s written request, he was accepted by 15th Punjab Regiment.

===Army career===
He was commissioned as an infantry subaltern at Ambala, before transfer to 39th Indian Division Nearing an important moment in the war, when the Allies were about to launch the largest counter-offensive of the war so far, he arrived with 4th Battalion into the British 14th Army to make the drive for Rangoon.

General Slim&#x27;s masterful strategy was simple: to divide the Japanese forces on a railway junction at Meiktila. The ensuing battles were among the most savage and bitter of the Second World War. The brilliant thrust captured the garrison town that controlled the crossing over the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese launched a series of counter-attacks to desperately try to keep the road to Mandalay open for their retreat. Myingyan became an important river-head supply base.

4/15th were part of Lt-Col Hubert Conroy&#x27;s 33 Brigade whose job was to clear the forest in a triangle around Nyaunga bridgehead. South of Nyaunga they attacked Sindewa, a heavily defended Japanese position in the jungle, thick with trees. There were extensive minefields.

On 18 March 1945 during the Battle of Meiktila in Burma (now Myanmar), he was ordered to capture a cotton mill. The assault began with an attack on the strategic river port of Myingan. By all accounts even before receiving the posthumous award, Singh was a brave soldier. Always eager to engage in actions he confided in C/O 4/15th Major Johnny Whitmarsh-Knight his desire for glory. They arrived on 17 March 1945. The following morning the Jat Company comprising Indian soldiers was to spearhead the assault. They were supported by the Sherman tanks of No 2 Troop, C Squadron, 116 Regiment (Gordon Highlanders), Royal Armoured Corps, commanded by Lt Hugh Baker.

Singh was just 21 years old, and a Lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, in the British Indian Army during World War II when he performed the following deeds for which he was awarded the VC during the Battle of Myingan which raged over four days. Baker exclaimed later that Karamjeet was the &quot;bravest soldier I have ever seen.&quot;

Though facing stiff enemy resistance (a total of almost 200 enemy shells fell around the tanks and infantry during the attack) and in unsuitable terrain for tanks, he dominated the battlefield by his numerous and successive acts of superb gallantry until he fell in the last stages of the action.

<text>Arthur Walter Evans (alias &quot;Walter Simpson&quot;) (8 April 1891 – 1 November 1936) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Evans was 27 years old, and a lance sergeant in the 6th Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment, British Army, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. He was awarded the VC under the alias Walter Simpson with which he had enlisted in the army.

On 2 September 1918 south west of Etaing, France, a patrol reconnoitring on the west bank of a river sighted an enemy machine-gun on the east bank. The river being very deep at that point, Lance Sergeant Evans volunteered to swim across and having done so crawled up behind the machine-gun post, where he shot the sentry and another man and made four more surrender. After a crossing had been found and one officer and one man joined him, machine-gun and rifle fire was opened on them. The officer was wounded and Sergeant Evans covered his withdrawal under very heavy fire.

<text>David Stuart McGregor VC (16 October 1895 – 22 October 1918) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with The Royal Scots during the First World War, he was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions on 22 October 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive.

==Early life==
David Stuart McGregor was born on 16 October 1895 in Corstorphine, to the west of Edinburgh. His father, also named David, was in the clothing trade. Educated at George Watson&#x27;s College and then George Heriot&#x27;s School, in 1911 he began working at the Commercial Bank of Scotland. Two years later he joined the Territorial Force, serving in the Midlothian Royal Field Artillery.

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914, McGregor enlisted, as did so many other young British men of his generation, in the British Army. He was commissioned into the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots, a Territorial Force (TF) unit. He was initially sent to Egypt with his battalion but by 1916 was serving on the Western Front. After receiving specialist training, he was posted to the Machine Gun Corps (MGC).

On 22 October 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, McGregor, attached to the MGC&#x27;s 29th Battalion, 29th Division, was commanding a section of machine guns in support of a battalion advancing near Hoogemolen, in Belgium. However, the battalion came under heavy machine gun fire from a nearby hill which stopped further movement forward. Despite being under fire, McGregor was instrumental in getting the advance restarted by bringing forward his guns and directing their fire onto the Germans until he was killed. For his actions on 22 October he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for McGregor&#x27;s VC read:

McGregor&#x27;s body was recovered and he is buried in the Stasegem Communal Cemetery in West Flanders, four kilometres to the east of Kortrijk. A memorial stone and plaque on the boundary of George Heriot&#x27;s School, at the junction of Lauriston Place and Heriot Place, was unveiled on the 100th anniversary of his death, 22 October 2018.

==Victoria Cross==
King George V presented McGregor&#x27;s VC to his parents on 15 February 1919, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. In 1976, his VC was donated to the Royal Scots and is displayed at the Royal Scots Museum in Edinburgh Castle, Scotland.

<text>The Bristol Harbour Railway (known originally as the Harbour Railway) was a standard-gauge industrial railway that served the wharves and docks of Bristol, England. The line, which had a network of approximately of track, connected the Floating Harbour to the GWR mainline at Bristol Temple Meads. Freight could be transported directly by waggons to Paddington Station in London. The railway officially closed in 1964.

In 1978, a heritage railway named the Bristol Harbour Railway was opened and operated by Bristol Industrial Museum. It uses approximately of the preserved line that runs adjacent to the River Avon. The line is a very popular visitor attraction in the city.

==Industrial line==

The Harbour Railway was a joint venture by the GWR and sister company the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The first part of the network opened in 1872 between Temple Meads and the Floating Harbour. The route required a tunnel under St Mary Redcliffe church and a steam-powered bascule bridge across the entrance locks at Bathurst Basin. In 1876 the line was extended by to Wapping Wharf.

In 1897 an act of Parliament gave the GWR the authorisation to make a westwards connection between the Harbour Railway and the Portishead Railway. This created the West Loop at which permitted southerly travel towards and . The connection also permitted the double the rail capacity to the Great Western Main Line.

In 1906 another authorised extension created new branches from the south via the Ashton Swing Bridge to Canons Marsh on the north side of the Floating Harbour and to Wapping via a line alongside the New Cut.

In 1964, the Harbour railway connection to Temple Meads was closed and the track lifted. The steam engine from the link&#x27;s bascule bridge is now preserved at Bristol Museum &amp; Art Gallery. The following year, the Canons Marsh line closed. The branch from the Portishead line and Wapping marshalling yard to the Western Fuel Company continued remained open for commercial coal traffic for another 20 years. It was officially closed in 1987.

==Heritage railway==
In 1978, the Bristol Industrial Museum reopened part of the line as preserved railway using locomotives built in Bristol and formerly used at Avonmouth Docks. At first, it connected the museum with the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot;, but when commercial rail traffic ceased in 1987 on the remaining branch line, the museum railway expanded to use the branch alongside the New Cut. However, when the Portishead Railway was relaid, this severed the connection to Ashton Junction.

The line starts at M shed, following the south side of the harbour and crossing Spike Island, the narrow strip of land between the harbour and the River Avon.
The former route east over the Swing Bridge is now the Pill Pathway rail trail and cycleway.

The railway operates on selected weekends on standard gauge track over . The railway runs along the south side of Bristol Harbour, starting at M Shed (the former Bristol Industrial Museum ), stopping at the , and ending at B Bond Warehouse (home of the CREATE Centre), one of the large tobacco warehouses beside Cumberland Basin .

In 2006, Bristol Industrial Museum was closed and the site redeveloped into M Shed Museum of Bristol. The railway continues to operate between SS Great Britain Halt and the CREATE Centre, and in 2011 the railway became part of M Shed&#x27;s working exhibits.

In 2010, Bristol City Council, in partnership with other local councils in the area, proposed that the route of the railway should be used for a bus rapid transit route to serve the south-west of the city. In early 2013, a review of alternative routes recommended a route along Cumberland Road, Commercial Road and Redcliff Hill as the best alternative. This change of route means that the rapid transit buses would no longer use the railway.

Some time before March 2017, the track and platform at Butterfly Junction (by the CREATE Centre) was removed due to work on the Bristol MetroBus system. The route to the CREATE Centre was further curtailed in December by severe subsidence that closed that section of the line and the adjacent Chocolate Path. The section collapsed into the New Cut in January 2020.

Since the collapse, trains from the M Shed now travel a significantly shorter route that follows Museum Street, ending at a platform near to the SS Great Britain.
===Rolling stock===
The steam locomotives were formerly part of the aborted preservation scheme at . There is also a collection of wagons, some of which have been converted for passenger use while others are used for demonstration goods trains.

<text>Jemadar Nand Singh, VC, MVC (24 September 1914 – 12 December 1947) was an Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces and he was posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), the second-highest Indian decoration for battlefield gallantry. This makes Nand Singh unique in the annals of VC winners.

== Military career ==

===World War II===
He was 29 years old, and an Acting Naik in the 1/11th Sikh Regiment, in the Indian Army during World War II when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 11/12 March 1944 on the Maungdaw-Buthidaung Road, Burma (now Myanmar), Naik Nand Singh, commanding a leading section of the attack, was ordered to recapture a position gained by the enemy. He led his section up a very steep knife-edged ridge under very heavy machine-gun and rifle fire and although wounded in the thigh, captured the first trench. He then crawled forward alone and, wounded again in the face and shoulder, nevertheless captured the second and third trenches.

===Indo-Pakistan War===
He later achieved the rank of Jemadar in the post-independence Indian Army, and his unit 1 Sikh was the first to be involved in the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Operations or Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 which began in October 1947 as Indian troops went into action to repel a planned invasion of J&amp;K by raiders from Pakistan.

On 12 December 1947 Nand Singh led his platoon of D Coy in a desperate but successful attack to extricate his battalion from an ambush in the hills SE of Uri in Kashmir. He was mortally injured by a close-quarters machine-gun burst, and posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), the second-highest Indian decoration for battlefield gallantry. This makes Nand Singh unique in the annals of VC winners.

The Pakistanis recognised Jemadar Nand Singh because of his VC ribbon. His body was taken Muzaffarabad where it was tied spreadeagled on a truck and paraded through the city with a loudspeaker proclaiming that this would be the fate of every Indian VC. The soldier&#x27;s body was later thrown into a garbage dump, and was never recovered.

==Citations==
===Victoria Cross===
The Victoria Cross citation reads as follows:
===Maha Vir Chakra===

The citation for the Maha Vir Chakra reads as follows:
==Legacy==
Nand Singh belonged to Village Bahadurpur now in Mansa district, Punjab. The nearest town to his village is Bareta, where a local bus stand is named as Shaheed Nand Singh Viktoria Bus Stand. A statue in Bathinda (locally known as Fauji Chowk) stands as a memorial.

<doc id="1218723" wikidata="Q1683281" url="?curid=1218723" title="Nicci French">
<text>Nicci French is the pseudonym of English husband-and-wife team Nicci Gerrard (born 10 June 1958) and Sean French (born 28 May 1959), who write psychological thrillers together.

==Personal lives==
Nicci Gerrard and Sean French were married in 1990. Since 1999 they have lived in Suffolk in East Anglia, England. Both have studied English literature at Oxford University. The couple have two daughters, Hadley and Molly, and Gerrard has two children from her first marriage, Edgar and Anna.

==Biography==
===Nicci Gerrard===
Nicola &#x27;Nicci&#x27; Gerrard was born on 10 June 1958. She grew up in Worcestershire, together with her two sisters and her brother.

She was educated at The Alice Ottley School in Worcester. She then studied English literature at Oxford University and then an MPhil at Sheffield University in 1986. She went on to teach literature in Los Angeles and London. She founded a women&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Women&#x27;s Review&quot;, before becoming a freelance journalist. During that time she married and had two children.
Following the failure of this first marriage, she met Sean French whilst working as editor for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; where French wrote a weekly column, but left when she was offered another job at &quot;The Observer&quot;.

In November 2014 her father John Gerrard died, his dementia having deteriorated significantly during a five-week stay in hospital for an unrelated problem and with very restricted visiting by his family. As a result of this Gerrard launched John&#x27;s Campaign for extended visiting rights for carers of patients with dementia.

Since February 2019, Gerrard has supported the &#x27;Save Our Libraries Essex&#x27; (SOLE) campaign, speaking out against the proposed closures of libraries by Essex County Council.

===Sean French===
Julian Sean French was born on 28 May 1959 in Bristol, the son of Philip French, a radio producer and film critic, and his Swedish-born wife Kersti (née Molin). He was, like his two younger brothers Patrick and Karl, educated at William Ellis secondary school in north London before studying English literature at Oxford University. The couple never met while there. While at Oxford University, French won a young writers’ contest organised by &quot;Vogue&quot;, and subsequently became a journalist.

In 1987 he gained his first column and until the end of 2000 he wrote a column for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. His solo novel &quot;Start from Here&quot; was published in 2004.

<text>Isaac Lodge VC (6 May 1866 – 18 June 1923) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Lodge was 33 years old, and a gunner in &quot;Q&quot; Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 31 March 1900 at Sanna&#x27;s Post (aka Korn Spruit), South Africa, &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;U&quot; batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery were ambushed with the loss of most of the baggage column and five guns of the leading battery. When the alarm was given, &#x27;Q&#x27; Battery went into action 1150 yards from the spruit, until the order to retire was received, when Major Edmund Phipps-Hornby commanding the battery ordered the guns and their limbers to be run back by hand to a safe place. This most exhausting operation was carried out by, among others, Gunner Lodge, Sergeant Charles Parker and Driver Horace Glassock. When at last all but one of the guns and one limber had been moved to safety, the battery was reformed. The citation reads:
Lodge was one of the two gunners or drivers elected as described above.

==Further life==
He later achieved the rank of bombardier. After leaving the Army, he became a keeper in Hyde Park, London. He died at the age of 57 following a throat operation. He is buried at Hendon Park Cemetery in London, in grave number 21820.

Lieutenant Francis Maxwell also earned the Victoria Cross in this action.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum in Chelsea, England.

<text>William Henry Hewitt VC (19 June 1884 – 7 December 1966) was a South African soldier, and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces, during the First World War.

==Details==
He was 33 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 2nd South African Light Infantry, South African Forces during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 September 1917 east of Ypres, Belgium, Lance-Corporal Hewitt attacked a pill-box with his section and tried to rush the doorway. The garrison, however, proved very stubborn and in the attempt the lance-corporal received a severe wound. Nevertheless, he proceeded to the loophole of the pill-box where, in his attempts to put a bomb in it, he was again wounded in the arm. Undeterred, he finally managed to get the bomb inside where it dislodged the occupants and they were successfully dealt with by the rest of the section.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of major.

==The medal==
Hewitt&#x27;s medal is on permanent loan to the Imperial War Museum from Framlingham College, Suffolk, England. It was given to the school by his wife after his death.

<doc id="1218728" wikidata="Q4155176" url="?curid=1218728" title="Mir Dast">
<text>Mir Dast, (3 December 1874 – 19 January 1945) was a British Indian soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross for action during the First World War, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Mir Dast was a Pashtun from Afridi tribe and was born on 3 December 1874 to a Muslim family in the Maidan valley, Tirah, of what is now Pakistan. Mir Dast enlisted in the British Indian Army in December 1894. He served in the North-West Frontier and Waziristan prior to the First World War, and was promoted to the rank of jemadar in March 1909. His younger brother was Mir Mast who was promoted to a Jemadar before the outbreak of the Great War and would later defect to German enemy lines. 

==Victoria Cross==

During the First World War Dast was a jemadar in the 55th Coke&#x27;s Rifles (Frontier Force), British Indian Army, attached to the 57th Wilde&#x27;s Rifles (Frontier Force) when he performed the service for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross during the Second Battle of Ypres.

On 26 April 1915 at Ypres, Belgium, Jemadar Mir Dast led his platoon with great gallantry during a German counter-attack, and afterwards collected various parties of the regiment (when no British officers were left) and kept them under his command. He also displayed remarkable courage that day in helping to carry eight British and Indian Officers into safety, while exposed to very heavy fire which left Dast wounded. The citation read:

&quot;For most conspicuous bravery and great ability at Ypres on 26th April, 1915, when he led his platoon with great gallantry during the attack, and afterwards collected various, parties of the regiment (when no British) Officers were left) and kept them under his command until the retirement was ordered. Jemadar Mir Dast subsequently on this, day displayed remarkable courage in helping, to carry eight British and Indian Officers into safety, whilst exposed to very heavy fire&quot;.

Dast was subsequently sent for treatment in the Royal Pavilion, Brighton where he received his medal from King George V. His was the fourth VC awarded to an Indian since Indians had become eligible for the award in 1911.

==Later life and legacy==
Dast retired from active service in 1917 with the rank of subedar. He died on 19 January 1945 at Shagi Hindkyan Village, Tehsil, Peshawar, and was buried at Warsak Road Cemetery, Shagi Hindkyan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan.

Today a monument stands at the Memorial Gates at Hyde Park Corner in London to commemorate the VCs of Indian heritage, including Mir Dast.

A blue plaque was erected in May 2016 in honour of Mir Dast next to the Indian Gate at Royal Pavilion Gardens in Brighton.

<text>Albert David &quot;Alby&quot; Lowerson, VC (2 August 1896 – 15 December 1945) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Albert Lowerson, nicknamed Alby, was born in Myrtleford, a town in the state of Victoria, on 2 August 1896. His father worked for the railways as an engine driver but later turned his hand to farming. Lowerson worked as a gold miner after leaving school.

==First World War==
In July 1915, Lowerson joined the Australian Imperial Force. After initial training, he embarked for the Middle East in September 1915 as a reinforcement for 21st Battalion. He arrived too late to participate in the Gallipoli Campaign and in March 1916 proceeded with his battalion to the Western Front. He fought in the Battles of the Somme, Pozières and Mouquet Farm, the latter of which saw him wounded. He was also recommended for the Military Medal for his work at Pozières but this was not awarded. After a month recovering from his wounds he rejoined his battalion and shortly afterwards was promoted to corporal. Promoted in April 1917 to acting sergeant, he was again wounded, this time during the Second Battle of Bullecourt.

Lowerson&#x27;s promotion to sergeant was made permanent while he was still recovering from his wounding at Bullecourt. He rejoined his battalion in November 1917. On 1 September 1918, during the Battle of Mont St Quentin, 21st Battalion supported 23rd and 24th Battalions in an attack towards the village of Mont St Quentin. Lowerson&#x27;s company was held up in its advance on the flank of the village and, with a party of seven men, attacked and captured a strong point from which heavy machinegun fire was directed towards the advancing Australians. The advance was able to continue. Lowerson, wounded, was sent to the rear but it was a further two days before he was dispatched to a hospital.

After his wounding at St Quentin, Lowerson returned to his unit in September 1918 but received his fourth wound the following month and took no further part in the war. The award of his VC for his actions at St Quentin was gazetted on 14 December 1918 and he was presented with it by King George V on 1 March 1919. The citation for his VC read:

==Later life and legacy==

Lowerson left for Australia in April 1919 and was discharged from the AIF three months later. Like his father, Lowerson became a farmer and worked a block of land, which he named St. Quentin, near Myrtleford and which he converted to tobacco and dairy. He married in 1930 and had a daughter. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he rejoined the Australian Army but his old war wounds confined him to service on the home front as a sergeant with a number of training battalions. He was serving with 2/8 Training Battalion when he was discharged from service in 1944 but became ill with leukemia the following year. He died on 15 December 1945. Buried in Myrtleford, he was survived by his wife and daughter.

On 23 April 2015 a memorial statue was unveiled in Myrtleford. Lowerson&#x27;s VC is held at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. He was also entitled for the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.

<text>Lalbahadur Thapa Magar VC (Nepali: लालबहादुर थापामगर; February 1906 – 19 October 1968) was a Nepali Gorkha recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was approximately 37 years old, and a Subedar in the 1st Battalion, 2nd Gurkha Rifles, in the Indian Army during World War II when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 5/6 April 1943 during the silent attack on Rass-es-Zouai, Tunisia, Subadar Lalbahadur Thapa, taking command of two sections, made his first contact with the enemy at the foot of a pathway winding up a narrow cleft which was thickly studded with enemy posts. The garrison of the out-posts were all killed by the subadar and his men, by kukri or bayonet and the next machine-gun posts were dealt with similarly. This officer then continued to fight his way up the bullet-swept approaches to the crest where he and the riflemen with him killed four - the rest fled. Thus secured, advance by the whole division was made possible.

He later achieved the rank of Subedar-Major

==The medal==

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Gurkha Museum in Winchester, Hampshire, England.

<text>Major Charles Ferguson Hoey VC MC (29 March 1914 – 16 February 1944) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Charles Ferguson Hoey was born on 29 March 1914, the son of Ferguson and Mary Rudyerd Hoey, of Duncan, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Grandson, through his mother, of Major General Charles Rudyerd Simpson CB, Colonel, The Lincolnshire Regiment. He started his education at Queen Margaret&#x27;s School in Duncan, then attended Duncan Grammar School and Duncan High School.

Hoey went to England in 1933 in order to pursue a military career. He first enlisted in the British Army as a private soldier in the Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, before winning a cadetship to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and went there in September 1935. He graduated in December 1936 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Lincolnshire Regiment, later the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment, on 28 January 1937. He transferred to the 1st Battalion of the Lincolns, then stationed in India, and sailed for there in September 1937. He went to Burma with the 1st Battalion in 1942 and served there until his death in February 1944. He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) in July 1943 for his outstanding service at Maungdaw during a raid on a Japanese position.

==Victoria Cross==
He was 29 years old, and a temporary major in the 1st Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, at the time of the Battle of the Admin Box. A Corps HQ made up mostly of support units and muleteers reinforced with some combat troops was besieged by Japanese forces. The battalion was to break through the attackers and reinforce those within the Box. 

On 16 February 1944 near the Ngakyedauk Pass, Arakan region Major Hoey&#x27;s company came under devastating machine-gun fire, but Major Hoey did not waver in his advance on the objective. Although wounded in the head and leg he went forward alone with a Bren gun and tackled a troublesome enemy strong point, destroying it and killing all the occupants, but he was mortally wounded.

The citation reads as follows:

&quot;In BURMA, on the 16th February, 1944, Major Hoey&#x27;s company formed part of a force which was ordered to capture a position at all costs. After a night march through enemy-held territory, the force was met at the foot of the position by machine gun fire. Major Hoey personally led his company under heavy machine gun and rifle fire up to the objective. Although wounded at least twice in the leg and head, he seized a Bren gun from one of his men and, firing from the hip, led his company into the objective. In spite of his wounds the company had difficulty in keeping up with him, and Major Hoey reached the enemy strong post first, where he killed all the occupants before being mortally wounded. Major Hoey&#x27;s outstanding gallantry and leadership, his total disregard of personal safety and his grim determination to reach the objective resulted in the capture of this vital position.&quot; 
His remains are now interred at Taukkyan War Cemetery in Burma.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed in the Galleries of the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment at the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in Lincoln, England.

==Charles Hoey VC Memorial Park==
Charles Hoey VC Memorial Park has been dedicated in downtown Duncan, B.C. This park is located along Canada Avenue between Trunk Road and Ingram Street. The Cowichan cenotaph, located within the park, is inscribed with the names of area residents killed in the two World Wars and the war in Korea.

<text>Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship Tournament 2004, known in Japan as Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters Expert 3 (遊戯王デュエルモンスターズ エキスパート3), is a card battle video game based on the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise. This game was released for the Game Boy Advance system in 2004, and was re-released in 2025 as part of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection&quot; game compilation.

== Gameplay ==
This game has many obvious similarities to &quot;The Eternal Duelist Soul&quot;. The duel system is almost exactly the same, but there are a few differences.

The player can assemble a deck and can duel against a variety of computer opponents. The game features the first 1,138 cards released in Japan. There are 29 opponents in the game, however duelist 29 can&#x27;t be played and is locked when Marik is at least once defeated. Each opponent has different skills and decks revolve around a certain theme (Yugi=Basic, Exodia Rare Hunter=Exodia, Yami Yugi (Dark Yugi)=Ultimate, etc.).

=== Game mechanics ===
When a duelist has at least one copy of all 1,138 cards, they can choose to ignore the Limited List. However, the stronger duelists don&#x27;t follow the Limited list either. For example, Simon the Exodia duelist has three of each of the Exodia parts in his deck, where normally a player may only have one. The AI is rather poor: if a player has a face-down monster with 2000 defense points, and the AI opponent has a monster with 1900 attack points, they will not attack as they &quot;know&quot; they cannot defeat the face-down monster. As well, an AI opponent will Tribute Summon as soon as possible, even tributing 1 monster to summon exactly the same monster, or even a weaker monster than the original. Stronger duelists often have high requirements to be &quot;unlocked&quot; (available to duel): the final duelists in the game require the player have at least fifteen more wins than losses against every other duelist in the game.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

==Sequel==
&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 7 Trials to Glory: World Championship Tournament 2005&quot;, also known as &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters International 2 &quot; in Japan and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Day of the Duelist: World Championship Tournament 2005&quot; in Australia and Europe, was released for the Game Boy Advance. The game is initially a role-playing video game with strategy elements, in the form of the in-game dueling that plays the main role in this game. The player assumes the role of a beginner duelist who must enter card battle tournaments. The game also comes with three free Yu-Gi-Oh! game cards: Mind Control, Kaibaman, and Silent Swordsman LV7.

<text>From the beginning of organised motor sport events, in the early 1900s, until the late 1960s, before commercial sponsorship liveries came into common use, vehicles competing in Formula One, sports car racing, touring car racing and other international auto racing competitions customarily painted their cars in standardised racing colours that indicated the nation of origin of the car or driver. These were often quite different from the national colours used in other sports or in politics.

==History==

===1900s===

The colours have their origin in the national teams competing in the Gordon Bennett Cup, which was held annually in 1900-1905. Count Eliot Zborowski, father of inter-war racing legend Louis Zborowski, suggested that each national entrant be allotted a different colour. The first competition in 1900 assigned: Blue to France, Yellow to Belgium, White to Germany and Red to the United States. (Italy did not adopt its famous &#x27;Racing Red&#x27; until a red Fiat won the Grand Prix race in 1907).

When Britain first competed in 1902, it had to choose a different colour from her national colours of red, white and blue, as these had already been allocated. Selwyn Edge&#x27;s winning Napier of 1902 was painted olive green, and green was well-established as an appropriate colour for locomotives and machinery, in which Britain had led the world during the previous century. When Britain hosted the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup the following year on a closed course at Athy in Ireland, the British adopted Shamrock green which later evolved into various shades of &#x27;British racing green&#x27;.

===1920s–1960s===

Colours were definitely established in the Interwar period of Grand Prix motor racing and listed by the AiACr (the forerunner of the FIA), when the &quot;Bleu de France&quot; Bugattis and the &quot;Rosso Corsa&quot; Alfa Romeos of Italy won many races, while the British racing green Bentleys dominated the Le Mans &quot;Grand Prix d&#x27;Endurance&quot; until 1930.

In the 1930s the Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union teams did not apply the traditional German white paint, and their bare sheets of metal gave rise to the term &quot;Silver Arrows&quot;. A myth developed in the 1930s that the German teams did not apply white paint owing to the need to be under the 750 kg maximum weight limit; however, the first &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; raced in 1932, before the weight limit was imposed in 1934. Modern monocoque aircraft fuselage construction was already using polished and unpainted aluminium panels at this period, and the wealthy motor-racing fraternity would also have been aware that in Heraldry, White and Silver are the same colour or &#x27;tincture&#x27;, described as &#x27;Argent&#x27;; (similarly Yellow and Gold are both called &#x27;Or&#x27;).

Thailand&#x27;s accepted racing colours of mid blue with a lower yellow band and/or yellow wheels, are said to have been derived from the evening dress worn by a young woman met in London in the early thirties by Prince Bira of Siam, who lived in Europe and was a well-known racer of the time. Bira adopted the scheme for his cars from 1934 until he retired in 1954, by which time he had represented his country in many areas of international motor sport. 

Post-war colours were defined in terms of body, bonnet, chassis, numbers and their backgrounds (see diagrams below). When the chassis was no longer exposed, the chassis colour was shown in various ways, e.g. the parallel blue stripes of the Cunningham team and other US teams in the 1950s. Porsche in the 1950s and 1960s also retained the silver colouring, although other German teams in the 1960s (such as BMW) returned to white paint.

During this period, the colour was not determined by the country the car was made in nor by the nationality of the driver(s) but by the nationality of the team entering the vehicle, e.g. Stirling Moss drove three races during the 1954 season in a British racing green Maserati 250F because the Italian-built car was entered by the British privateer teams Equipe Moss and A.E.Moss respectively. However, this general rule was not strictly kept. Australian Jack Brabham and New Zealander Bruce McLaren, for instance, who both based and licensed their teams in Britain, used colour schemes on their early cars that were not based on national principles (namely the Brabham BT3, McLaren M2B, McLaren M4B and McLaren M5A cars), while the British Rob Walker privateer team entered cars in Scottish national colours (blue with a white stripe) instead of the British racing green.

===Sponsorship era – from 1968===

In the spring of , sponsorship liveries, which had already been used in the United States for some years, were also allowed in international racing. Team Gunston, a South African privateer team, was the first Formula One team to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors when they entered a private Brabham for John Love, painted in the colours of Gunston cigarettes, in the 1968 South African Grand Prix. In the next race, the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix, Team Lotus became the first works team to follow this example, with Graham Hill&#x27;s Lotus 49B entered in the red, gold and white colours of Imperial Tobacco&#x27;s Gold Leaf brand. British Racing Green soon vanished from the cars of British teams.

The old colour scheme was abandoned by the FIA for most racing disciplines in the 1970s.

===Contemporary usage===

Traditional colours are still used by automakers and teams that want to emphasise their racing traditions, especially by Italian, British and German manufacturers.

The &quot;Rosso Corsa&quot; has been used uninterruptedly by Italian manufacturers Ferrari and Alfa Romeo.

Since the 1990s, other traditional colours have resurfaced, such as the British racing green F1 Jaguar Racing cars and Aston Martin sports cars, and the white F1 BMW Sauber. German manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and Audi (Auto Union) used silver paint when they returned to international racing in the 1990s. Many concept cars follow the old colour schemes, and most amateur racers prefer them as well.

Often, sponsorship agreements respect traditional colours. For example, Ferrari has had major sponsors which also use red colours, like Marlboro and Santander. In contrast, when tobacco company West sponsored McLaren in the 1990s and 2000s, they did not use their colours, but the &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; from engine provider Mercedes. In a reversed situation, Subaru has continued using blue and yellow liveries well after their 555 sponsorship ended.

Some manufacturers prefer colours different from their national colours. For example, Citroën has traditionally used red, Renault and Opel have used yellow and black, and Volkswagen has used blue and white.

The EFDA Nations Cup, running 1990–1998, was a one make racing series with a total of at least 20 countries, predominantly European ones, being represented.

The annual A1 Grand Prix series of 2005–2009 featured national teams, driving identical cars with differing colour schemes. Initially, most schemes were based on the respective national flags; some teams with different traditional sporting colours have since switched, including A1 Team Australia and A1 Team India. The old national racing colours were not so popular among these teams.

Honda&#x27;s range of street-legal Type-R vehicles are offered in Championship White (Honda colour code NH0) which is similar to the original white that adorned Honda&#x27;s first F1 car (Honda RA272) driven by Richie Ginther that secured Honda&#x27;s first ever F1 win in the 1965 Mexican Grand Prix.

These have stuck as a pattern, and are common outside of international Grand Prix racing.

<text>Craig Peter Johnston (born 25 June 1960) is an Australian former professional football player. He played as a midfielder in the English Football League between 1977 and 1988, for Middlesbrough and Liverpool. Nicknamed &quot;Skippy&quot;, Johnston was a crowd favourite at Anfield, making 271 Liverpool appearances and scoring 40 goals. He was a key member of the 1986 &quot;double&quot; winning team. He also co-wrote the team&#x27;s 1988 cup final song &quot;Anfield Rap&quot;. Johnston’s career ended prematurely when aged 27, he retired from football to take care of his ill sister.

Johnston designed and created the prototype for one of the worlds largest selling football boots of all time, the Adidas Predator, worn by many footballers and rugby players.

==Childhood==
Johnston was born in Johannesburg, South Africa to Australian parents; he returned home to Australia with his family as a small child. At the age of six, Johnston contracted osteomyelitis and came close to losing his leg and would have done if not for the expertise of an American specialist who was touring and lecturing in Australia at the time.

He began his career at Lake Macquarie City in Newcastle, New South Wales. Encouraged by his father Colin, who had trialled at Preston North End and Dundee United, aged 15, he wrote to several English clubs, with Middlesbrough replying. His parents sold their house to pay for the flight to England.

==Career in England==
In his first match as a trialist, at half time and 3–0 down he was told by then manager Jack Charlton “you are the worst footballer I have ever seen in my life. You won&#x27;t make a player while your arse still points to the ground”. He was told to “hop it” therefore losing his room at the hotel for all the trialists. He stayed in a cleaned out coal shed behind the hotel. Refusing to give up, he trained alone in a car park near Ayrsome Park where he was spotted by then Boro captain Graeme Souness.

Middlesbrough, managed by John Neal now, signed Johnston in 1977 making his first team debut for Middlesbrough, aged 17, in a 3–2 FA Cup victory against Everton. His league debut came on 4 February 1978 in a 2–1 victory over Birmingham City at St Andrew&#x27;s and he scored his first goal later that season in a 2–1 home league defeat to West Ham United. Johnston scored 16 goals in 64 league games for Middlesbrough before moving to Liverpool in 1981 for £650,000

Johnston made his Liverpool debut in August 1981, coming on as sub for Ray Kennedy in the 1–0 league defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. Johnston&#x27;s first start came in the Intercontinental Cup fixture against Brazilian side Flamengo.

Johnston scored his first goal for Liverpool on 8 December 1981 against Arsenal at Anfield, during a League Cup fourth round replay. Johnston opened the scoring in the fifth minute of extra time in a 3–0 win. Johnston became a crowd favourite at Anfield during his long spell with the club. He worked under three managers – Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish – and, when picked, predominantly played on the right side of midfield. He made 271 appearances for the club and scored 40 goals.

Johnston was part of the League championship-winning teams of 1982 and 1983 and gained a League Cup winner&#x27;s medal in 1983. In 1984, Johnston was part of the team which won a treble of League championship, League Cup and European Cup. Two years later he was an integral part of the side which won only the third League championship and FA Cup &quot;double&quot; of the 20th century. In the 1986 FA Cup final at Wembley, Johnston became the first Australian to score in a final, converting a Jan Molby cross to put Liverpool 2–1 ahead against Everton. Ian Rush secured the win with a late third.

In 1988, he was a frequent substitute and occasional starter as Liverpool again won the League title and reached the FA Cup final, aiming to complete a second &quot;double&quot;. Johnston wrote the club&#x27;s traditional Cup final song called &quot;Anfield Rap&quot; which combined pro-Liverpool lyrics with the rap and house trends of the time, with other Liverpool players contributing.

His last two goals for the Reds came in the penultimate league game of the season, a 5–1 away win over Sheffield Wednesday. By this stage, Liverpool had wrapped up the 17th league title of their history.

==International career==
Johnston was approached by Jock Stein in the early 1980s with a view to him playing for Scotland as he was eligible through his father. Johnston declined Stein&#x27;s offer. He did represent England at under-21 level against Norway in September 1980 at The Dell and against the Republic of Ireland at Anfield in February 1981. Early in his career in England he had described playing football for Australia as &quot;like surfing for England.&quot; Johnston was also eligible to represent South Africa.

==Retirement==
After 270 appearances and 40 goals and just days before the 1988 FA Cup Final at Wembley against Wimbledon, Johnston announced his premature retirement from football to manager Kenny Dalglish. The story was leaked by a tabloid newspaper on the morning of cup final day, much to the player and club&#x27;s anger.

In December 1987, Johnston&#x27;s sister Faye became seriously ill and was admitted to a hospital in Morocco. She had suffered from butane gas inhalation from a faulty heater in her hotel. Johnston was at the club&#x27;s Christmas party when hearing the news. He flew out and brought her back to London by air ambulance. He also brought his parents over from Australia. She woke on New Year’s eve, after three weeks in coma. “We all thought Faye would get better but she didn’t. Time went on and we tried all sorts of things, took her to Malaysia, to neurologists… nobody could help. So I retired from football, it was a big decision. It was time to go home. Once back in Australia we realised that Faye wasn’t getting better and apparently she never would.”

Johnston made his 271st and final appearance as a red, as a substitute for John Aldridge in the final (who had just seen his penalty saved with Liverpool a goal down) thus ending up on the losing side. In 1991, when Graeme Souness was manager of Liverpool F.C, he asked Johnston if he would like to train with the team with a view to playing again. Liverpool still held Johnston&#x27;s registration as a player. It didn&#x27;t work out and Johnston moved on. After his retirement he was linked to clubs from all over the world. Johnston always retorted this speculation stating that he could never play for anyone other than Liverpool.

==Business career==
After retiring from playing football, Johnston found success as a businessman and innovator, designing and creating the prototype for Adidas Predator football boot, worn by many of the world&#x27;s top players of both football and rugby including Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Xavi, Jonny Wilkinson and Ronan O&#x27;Gara. Getting the first boot off the ground took Johnston 5 years and was initially refused by Adidas, as well as Nike and Reebok. However, Johnston then filmed German legends Franz Beckenbauer, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner using the boots in snowy conditions, which led to Adidas agreeing to the proposal.

He later designed another innovative boot called The Pig or, to give them their full title, the Patented Interactive Grip can come as a &#x27;skin&#x27; that can be placed over the toe of an existing boot. The design earned him a nomination for British designer of the year, losing out to a multimedia designer.

Johnston also invented the Traxion sole for football boots and the software program the &#x27;Butler,&#x27; a device that shows what has been removed from minibars in hotel bedrooms.

Johnston invested heavily in a football school idea for inner city children but failed to win expected business backing and went bankrupt. He was made temporarily homeless as a result.

==Other activities==
Johnston was the creator of TV game show &quot;The Main Event&quot;, which aired for two years in the early 1990s in Australia and a season in the UK in 1993.

Though he travels the world with his business interests, Johnston remains based in Australia. He has been recognised at home for his achievements in England. On 18 June 2006, Johnston made an appearance as a guest on &quot;The Footy Show World Cup Spectacular&quot; in Germany revealing information on his career.

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Johnston wrote a 12-page letter to FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, in which he collected all criticism by players and coaches of the controversial Adidas-produced Jabulani ball, risking his reputation, and expecting to be blacklisted by the conservative governing body as a result of this letter.

In 2005, Johnston was inducted into the Football Australia Hall of Fame.

Johnston has now forged a new career as a photographer.

<text>Tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) is a protease inhibitor. Its structural formula is 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-4-phenyl-2-butanone.

==Uses==
TPCK is an irreversible inhibitor of chymotrypsin. Also inhibits some cysteine proteases such as caspase, papain, bromelain or ficin. It does not inhibit trypsin or zymogens.

TPCK is observed covalently bound in the active site of Caspase 3 in the crystal structure of the complex solved in 2010. The chloromethyl group reacts with the active site cysteine to form a covalent bond with the loss of the chlorine.

TPCK is chosen for the chemical labelling of active histidine in enzyme analysis. The phenylalanine moiety is bound to the enzyme because of specificity for aromatic amino acid residues at the active site (as in chymotrypsin, in which it binds to the histidine-57 residue in the active site).

===Virology===
TPCK-treated trypsin is used to improve infection yield in laboratory tissue culture of some wild virus isolates that are not well-adapted to growth &quot;in vitro&quot;, such as some low-pathogenic avian influenza strains or fresh clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2. The trypsin performs the maturation cleavage of the viral envelope proteins efficiently.

<doc id="1218754" wikidata="Q1666678" url="?curid=1218754" title="International Karate +">
<text>International Karate +, stylized as IK+, is a fighting game written by Archer Maclean and published in 1987 by System 3 for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum. It is a successor to &quot;International Karate&quot; (1985). Activision published the Commodore 64 version in the US as Chop N&#x27; Drop.

==Gameplay==

Three karateka fight against each other on a beach, trying to be the first to score six points. After every two rounds, there is a bonus game which is either deflecting bouncing balls or kicking away bombs. The C64 version of the game only has the ball bouncing bonus game, and not the bomb bonus game. The game can be played by one or two human players; at least one fighter is always controlled by the computer. Unlike its predecessor, &quot;International Karate&quot;, there is only one backdrop, but different parts of the backdrop can be recoloured to several different themes by the players using specific keystrokes. The Amiga, Atari and C64 versions of the game (and possibly other versions, unconfirmed) had a number of &quot;background antics&quot;, a Pac-Man would appear, a spider would descend, and a U-boat&#x27;s periscope would occasionally be seen in the harbour. In addition, pressing a certain key or keys would cause the trousers of all three protagonists to fall down, after which they would do a double-take. Additionally, it was possible (on the Amiga version, at least) to type in four-letter curse words; the game would respond first by rebuking the player for their use of such language, and upon the second offence would reset the game.

==Development==
Archer Maclean did most of the work on developing the game, and the music was written by Rob Hubbard. Music for the Amiga version was arranged by Dave Lowe. In August 2005, the music from the game was performed at the third Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig, Germany.

The packaging illustration for the Activision Commodore 64 release version of &quot;IK+&quot;, entitled &quot;Chop &#x27;N Drop&quot;, was created by Marc Ericksen.

==Ports==
16-bit versions of the game were released in 1988 for the Atari ST and Amiga home computers. Apart from the music, which was arranged by Dave Lowe, the Atari ST version was created entirely by Archer Maclean. The bitmap editor NeoChrome was used to draw background graphics and sprites and the code was written in assembly language on an IBM PC-based development system that cross-compiled the 800 KB of source code in seven seconds and transferred the program to the RAM of the Atari ST via a parallel cable. Development took six months. The subsequent Amiga port took just seven days.

==Reception==

The game was voted Best 16-Bit Soundtrack of the Year at the 1988 Golden Joystick Awards.

==Legacy==
Another &quot;International Karate Deluxe&quot; game (AKA &quot;IK++&quot;) was ready but unreleased for the Atari ST and Amiga in 1987/1988.

It was also released by Activision in 1988 for the Commodore 64 under the title &quot;Chop &#x27;N Drop&quot;. A version for Amiga CD32 was released in 1994.

In 2003, Maclean&#x27;s Ignition Entertainment released &quot;IK+&quot; for the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation in Europe, which remained faithful to the 16-bit iterations.

The C64 version was re-released on the Virtual Console in Europe on July 25, 2008.

<text>Corned beef pie is made from corned beef, onion and often thinly sliced, cubed or mashed potato. It can be eaten hot or cold, making it a suitable common picnic food and also a &quot;winter warmer&quot;. The corned beef from which the pie derives its name may be leftover corned beef, as from a Sunday dinner, or tinned Bully beef. The pie may be made with a mashed potato topping, as in Shepherd&#x27;s pie, or with a traditional pastry crust.

<text>Sivapithecus () (syn: &quot;Ramapithecus)&quot; is a genus of extinct apes. Fossil remains of animals now assigned to this genus, dated from 12.2 million years old in the Miocene, have been found since the 19th century in the Sivalik Hills of the Indian subcontinent as well as in Kutch. Any one of the species in this genus may have been the ancestor to the modern orangutans.

Some early discoveries were given the separate names &quot;Ramapithecus&quot; (Rama&#x27;s Ape) and &quot;Bramapithecus&quot; (Brahma&#x27;s Ape), and were thought to be possible ancestors of humans.

==Discovery==


The first incomplete specimens of &quot;Sivapithecus&quot; were found in northern India in the late 19th century.

Another find was made in Nepal on the bank of the Tinau River situated in Palpa District; a western part of the country in 1932. This find was named &quot;Ramapithecus&quot;. The discoverer, G. Edward Lewis, claimed that it was distinct from &quot;Sivapithecus&quot;, as the jaw was more like a human&#x27;s than any other fossil ape then known, a claim revived in the 1960s. At that time, it was believed that the ancestors of humans had diverged from other apes 14 million years ago. Biochemical studies upset this view, suggesting that there was an early split between orangutan ancestors and the common ancestors of chimpanzees, gorillas and humans.

Meanwhile, more complete specimens of &quot;Ramapithecus&quot; were found in 1975 and 1976, which showed that it was less human-like than had been thought. It began to look more and more like &quot;Sivapithecus&quot;, meaning that the older name must take priority. It is also possible that fossils assigned to &quot;Ramapithecus&quot; belonged to the female form of &quot;Sivapithecus&quot;. They were definitely members of the same genus. It is also likely that they were already separate from the common ancestor of chimpanzees, gorillas and humans, which may be represented by the prehistoric great ape &quot;Nakalipithecus nakayamai&quot;. Siwalik specimens once assigned to the genus &quot;Ramapithecus&quot; are now considered by most researchers to belong to one or more species of &quot;Sivapithecus&quot;. &quot;Ramapithecus&quot; is no longer regarded as a likely ancestor of humans.

In 1982, David Pilbeam published a description of a significant fossil find from Potwar Plateau, Pakistan, formed by a large part of the face and jaw of a &quot;Sivapithecus&quot;. The partial skull was likely scavenged after death. The specimen (GSP 15000) bore many similarities to the orangutan skull and strengthened the theory (previously suggested by others) that &quot;Sivapithecus&quot; was closely related to orangutans.

In 2011, a 10.8 million-year old (Neogene period) upper jawbone of &quot;Sivapithecus&quot; was found in Kutch district of Gujarat, India. The find also extended &quot;Sivapithecus&quot;&#x27; southern range in Indian subcontinent significantly. The species can not be identified.

==Description==
&quot;Sivapithecus&quot; was about in body length, similar in size to a modern orangutan. In most respects, it would have resembled a chimpanzee, but its face was closer to that of an orangutan. The shape of its wrists and general body proportions suggest that it spent a significant amount of its time on the ground, as well as in trees. It had large canine teeth, and heavy molars, suggesting a diet of relatively tough food, such as seeds and savannah grasses.

Similarities to orangutans in what are chiefly jaw and partial skull fossils are a concave face with large zygomatic arch bones, narrow setting of eyes from each other, smoothness of nasal floor, and central incisor enlargement. However Sivapithecus&#x27; &quot;dental characteristics and postcranial skeleton do not confirm this phylogenetic position&quot; say Yaowalak Chaimanee of the Paleontology section of Thailand&#x27;s Department of Mineral Resources and colleagues, while reporting a find in 2003, so neat affinities are not the state of finding to date.

==Species==
Currently three species are generally recognized:
*Sivapithecus indicus fossils date from about 12.5 million to 10.5 million years ago.
*Sivapithecus sivalensis lived from 9.5 million to 8.5 million years ago. It was found at the Pothwar plateau in Pakistan as well as in parts of India. The animal was about the size of a chimpanzee but had the facial morphology of an orangutan; it ate soft fruit (detected in the toothwear pattern) and was probably mainly arboreal.
*Sivapithecus parvada described in 1988, this species is significantly larger and dated to about 10 million years ago.

<doc id="1218766" wikidata="Q2537800" url="?curid=1218766" title="Bozlak">
<text>Bozlak is a form of Turkish folk song from Central Anatolia accompanied by the long-necked baglama (divan sazı), davul and zurna. The main subjects of the melancholic songs are separation and love. The songs begin with a very high pitched vocal and end in a low vocal. The best known players are Toklumenli Aşık Said, Muharrem Ertaş, Neşet Ertaş, Hacı Taşan and Çekiç Ali.

Bozlak, which is a form of uzun hava (long tune) in Turkish Folk Music, has been a form of music starting from Central Anatolia and an expression of the cultures of the Yoruk / Turkmen and Avshar tribes which pursue a way of life based on yaylak (summer highland pasture)- and kislak (winter pasture). In terms of meaning, the word ‘bozlak’ has the meanings of to shout, to yell, to cry out, and to burst out. The bursting out of the sorrow, desolation and the outbreak that the Turkmens and Avshars experienced in daily life to the nature caused the emergence of 
the bozlak culture. Turkmens, Avshars and the Abdals who existed among these tribes have transferred the tradition of bozlak to our day. 

The term ‘bozlak’ means to scream, to revolt; ‘to struggle’ and with this frame this term is used to deal with social concepts such as death, separate, and pain, and it is seen in the several parts of the country especially in the Middle Anatolia and Çukurova region, and two different style; 
‘Avshar style’ and ‘Turkmen style’ is used in ‘bozlak’ thus, using two different makam (tones).

<text>Heinrich Meibom (4 December 1555 – 20 September 1625), German historian and poet, was born at Barntrup in Westphalia.

He held the chair of history and poetry at Helmstedt from 1583 until his death. He was a writer of Latin verses (&quot;Parodiarum horatianarum Libri III et sylvarum Libri II&quot;, 1588); and his talents in this direction were recognized by the emperor Rudolph II, who ennobled him; but his claim to be remembered rests on his services in elucidating the medieval history of Germany.

His &quot;Opuscula historica ad res Germanicus spectantia&quot; was edited and published in 1660 by his grandson, Heinrich Meibom (1638–1700), who was professor of medicine who wrote 57 medical treaties and then of history and poetry at Helmstedt, and incorporated his grandfather&#x27;s work with his own &quot;Rerum germanicarum scriptures&quot; (1688).

<text>Spencer Street is a major street and thoroughfare in the Melbourne central business district, Victoria, Australia. The street was gazetted in 1837 as the westernmost boundary of the Hoddle Grid.

Spencer Street is named for John Spencer, former Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom. As the 3rd Earl of Spencer, he was the 2nd great uncle of The Princess of Wales, Diana Spencer. John&#x27;s younger brother, Frederick, became the 4th Earl of Spencer on his brother&#x27;s death. Frederick was Diana&#x27;s 2nd great grandfather. On the 15th of April 1983, the Prince and Princess of Wales on their royal tour, departed Spencer Street Station for Ballarat, returning later that afternoon. 

== Location ==
Running roughly north–south, Spencer Street forms the western edge of the original Hoddle Grid. To the north Spencer Street becomes Dynon Road, whilst to the south it becomes Clarendon Street after crossing the Spencer Street Bridge over the Yarra River.

Spencer Street denotes the boundary between Melbourne and Docklands to the west, West Melbourne in the north and Southbank in the south, near Batman Park.

== History ==
Spencer Street was the site of the first permanent buildings in the settlement now called Melbourne. The home of John Batman was built on nearby Batman&#x27;s Hill where he lived until his death and the early camps of Captain William Lonsdale and Charles La Trobe were located along the street.

With the creation of Docklands in 2000, the rebuilding of Southern Cross railway station in 2006 and the addition of a shopping centre, the area has undergone significant urban renewal.

==Notable buildings==

Many buildings and structures on Spencer Street are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and/or classified by the National Trust of Australia. Others are more modern and significant for their current or future function. These include:

=== Heritage Listed ===
* Grand Hotel and Grand Central Apartments (the former Victorian Railway head office)
* Former Mail Exchange
* Overhead Water Tank (part of the former Spencer Street Power Station, demolished 2008)
* History of Transport Mural by artist Harold Freeman (at Southern Cross railway station)
* Sands and McDougall&#x27;s Warehouse

=== Other Buildings ===
* Southern Cross station
* Former Charles Hotham hotel 
* HM Melbourne Assessment Prison

=== Under Construction ===
Several apartment buildings and hotels are currently under construction, including the Ritz-Carlton which will be Australia&#x27;s tallest hotel when completed.

Victoria&#x27;s largest police station, the City West Police Centre, is located on Spencer Street. The Victoria Police Centre is set to open adjacent to it on Spencer Street as the new headquarters for Victoria Police in 2020.

== Transport ==
Spencer Street is served primarily by the Southern Cross railway station and is both a major terminus for V/Line regional passenger trains and a major stop for metropolitan trains. The street is served by tram routes 11, 12, 35, 96 and 109 at its southern end and 30, 75 and 86 towards the north.

==Ghost sightings==
There have been reports of supposed sightings of the ghost of John Spencer roaming around the corner of Francis Street and Spencer Street. This local attraction has brought ghost hunters from around Australia to investigate the phenomena, and is a common stop for local ghost tours.

<doc id="1218784" wikidata="Q221927" url="?curid=1218784" title="De Graafschap">
<text>Vereniging Betaald Voetbal De Graafschap, simply known as De Graafschap () is a professional association football club based in Doetinchem, Netherlands. The team competes in the , the second level of the Dutch football league system. 

Founded on 1 February 1954, the club has played its home games at De Vijverberg since their foundation. Translated from Dutch, the club name means &quot;The County&quot;, while its fans are affectionately referred to as &quot;Superboeren&quot; (&quot;Super Farmers&quot;). The club dons blue and white hooped shirts paired with white shorts and blue socks.

Though modest in stature compared to some European counterparts, De Graafschap has maintained a consistent presence in the top-tier Eredivisie, albeit without clinching any major trophies. Despite this, the club boasts a substantial stadium and a dedicated fan base, particularly notable within the second-tier Eerste Divisie. Over time, the club has cultivated heated rivalries, notably with Vitesse. However, circumstances have also fueled a burgeoning rivalry with Go Ahead Eagles.

==History==
===Foundation===


Following the &quot;Watersnoodwedstrijd&quot; (Flood Disaster Match), a benefit game featuring Dutch foreign professionals, held at the Parc des Princes in front of 40,000 spectators against France one month after the devastating North Sea flood of 1953, the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)&#x27;s rejection of professional football prompted the establishment of the &quot;wilde bond&quot; (wild federation) Nederlandse Beroeps Voetbal Bond (NBVB) to advocate for its introduction. New clubs were founded to support this initiative. Under the guidance of Amsterdam native Johan Roodbergen, the professional football club De Graafschap was established in Doetinchem on 1 February 1954. The name was chosen to represent the Oost-Gelderland region known as De Graafschap, which encompasses Doetinchem, formerly known as &quot;Graafschap Zutphen&quot; (County of Zutphen; until 1795 known as the Quarter of Zutphen), and now recognised as the Achterhoek. The club adopted a uniform featuring horizontally striped blue and white shirts, white shorts, and horizontally striped blue and white socks.

Prior to this initiative, professional football had never been played in Doetinchem. Following the merger of the NBVB and KNVB, De Graafschap joined the professional league. To facilitate this transition, the club merged with VV Oosseld (founded in 1922, abbreviated as VVO) to establish the professional association De Graafschap after initial discussions about merging all clubs around Doetinchem fell through. The clubs completed the 1954–55 season independently, after which the merger was formalised, with Oosseld becoming the amateur department of De Graafschap. Despite attempts to involve VV Doetinchem in the merger, the Doetinchem members rejected the proposal. De Graafschap played their first competitive match on 4 September 1954, drawing 1–1 with Fortuna &#x27;54 featuring players such as Frans de Munck, Cor van der Hart en Jan Notermans.

De Graafschap stands as the only team from the NBVB that persists as an independent professional club. Founder Roodbergen, after whom a grandstand was named, never witnessed &#x27;his&#x27; De Graafschap play due to his severe visual impairment. The team&#x27;s home matches were held at the newly constructed stadium De Vijverberg.

===First promotion (1972–89)===
Under the leadership of head coach Piet de Visser and with Guus Hiddink as a key player, De Graafschap clinched the first promotion playoff win in Dutch football during the 1972–73 season. Their debut season in the Eredivisie proved successful, securing a fourteenth-place finish highlighted by a notable 1–0 home victory over Ajax. The following two seasons saw the team maintain its position in the top flight. However, in the 1976–77 season, De Graafschap finished bottom, marking the first of nine relegations throughout the club&#x27;s history, with equally as many promotions.

In the 1980–81 Eerste Divisie season, De Graafschap found themselves out of contention for top spots in the league. Their striker, Boudewijn de Geer, was unpopular among supporters that season, and faced jeers from the crowd during a crucial promotion playoff match against Den Bosch. However, sentiments shifted dramatically when De Geer scored twice, propelling De Graafschap back into the Eredivisie. Despite this triumph, the club finished bottom in the subsequent season, resulting in their second ever relegation.

A motto in the Achterhooks dialect, embraced by the club and its supporters, encapsulates De Graafschap&#x27;s sporting history: &quot;Wi-j komt altied weer terug&quot; (&quot;We always come back&quot;). This phrase reflects the club&#x27;s recurrent pattern of fluctuating between divisions, highlighting its resilience over the years.

===Invincibles and eight years Eredivisie (1990–2003)===
In the 1990–91 season, under the management of Simon Kistemaker, De Graafschap achieved an undefeated championship title in the Eerste Divisie. However, their Eredivisie stay lasted only one season as they were immediately relegated the following year.

Between 1995 and 2003, De Graafschap enjoyed its lengthiest unbroken tenure in the Eredivisie. Under Fritz Korbach&#x27;s management in 1997, the club achieved its highest-ever league finish, securing eighth place. Subsequently, the club&#x27;s performance began to decline, and in 2003, under the guidance of Peter Bosz, De Graafschap suffered relegation back to the Eerste Divisie after an eight-year spell in the top flight.

===Up and downs (2004–present)===
De Graafschap&#x27;s rollercoaster ride between divisions culminated in a thrilling promotion to the Eredivisie, despite finishing sixth in the 2003–04 season of the Eerste Divisie. This achievement was made possible by a dramatic late goal from Michael van der Kruis during an away match against Excelsior at Woudestein. This crucial goal propelled them past Heracles Almelo in the standings, securing a last-minute promotion. However, a year later, they faced relegation back to the Eerste Divisie after a seventeenth-place finish in the Eredivisie.

In 2007, they dominated the Eerste Divisie under head coach Jan de Jonge with players such as Berry Powel, Jhon van Beukering, and Lasse Schöne, clinching the title, and briefly surprised in the Eredivisie the following season, albeit barely staying up through relegation playoffs after a poor second half to the season. However, in the 2008–09 season, they were relegated after a loss to RKC Waalwijk in the relegation play-offs. Again, they won the second-tier title in the 2009–10 season in convincing fashion under head coach and former player Darije Kalezić. He would subsequently lead them to one of their best Eredivisie performances in years, placing fourteenth in 2011, only losing three out of 17 home games. In 2012, however, they suffered relegation once again through the playoffs.

In the 2015–16 Eredivisie season, De Graafschap were once again relegated through playoffs after finishing seventeenth but not before drawing 1–1 against Ajax on the final day of the season, denying Ajax the championship. In 2018, the club gained promotion again by winning the promotion playoffs, beating Almere City FC in the playoffs finals. They were relegated in 2019, and the next season ended in further heartbreak on 24 April 2020 as they were denied a possible promotion back to the top flight due to the COVID-19 pandemic forcing the Eredivisie to declare their season void with no promotion or relegation.

Late in the 2020–21 season, De Graafschap were in control of their promotion hopes, only needing one win in their final two games to secure promotion. However, they were held to a 1–1 draw, followed by a goalless draw versus Helmond Sport, denying them an automatic promotion spot and forcing them to go through the promotion playoffs. De Graafschap crashed out of the playoffs in the first round after a 3–2 home loss to Roda JC, thus meaning that they would remain in the Eerste Divisie.

Despite experiencing multiple relegations, including seventeenth-place finishes and relegation playoffs in 2005, 2009, 2012, 2016, and 2019, De Graafschap has managed to avoid finishing at the bottom of the Eredivisie since 2003.

<doc id="1218792" wikidata="Q3748479" url="?curid=1218792" title="Fort Wainwright">
<text>Fort Wainwright is a United States Army installation in Fairbanks, Alaska. Fort Wainwright is part of the Fairbanks North Star Borough and the coterminous Fairbanks Metropolitan Statistical Area. The installation is managed by U.S. Army Garrison Alaska (USAG Alaska) and the senior command is 11th Airborne Division. Fort Wainwright was formerly known as [[Ladd Field]] (1939–1945) and [[Ladd Air Force Base]] (1947–1961); it was renamed Fort Wainwright in honor of General Jonathan M. Wainwright, a Medal of Honor recipient for his courageous leadership as commander of U.S. forces during the fall of the Philippines in World War II. Ladd Field was designated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL) on 4 February 1985 and Ladd Air Force Base was designated as Ladd Air Force Base Cold War District and was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on the same day. With over 1.6 million acres of land spanning across the Fairbanks North Star Borough and Southeast Fairbanks, Fort Wainwright is the largest U.S. military installation by area outside the contiguous United States.

==Geography==
=== Location ===
Fort Wainwright is located in Interior Alaska, between the Alaska Range in the south and the Brooks Range in the north. Fort Wainwright&#x27;s boundaries are located within the Fairbanks North Star Borough. To the west is the City of Fairbanks, and to the southeast is the City of North Pole. Fort Wainwright resides on both sides of the Chena River, a 100-mile tributary of the Tanana River.

=== Demographics ===
The total population to include the workforce on Fort Wainwright is approximately 15,000 personnel. There are roughly 6,500 military members, 5,700 military dependents, 1,250 civilian employees including appropriated and non-appropriated fund employees and over 400 contractors.

=== Climate ===
Fort Wainwright is located in a subarctic climate with seasonal temperature extremes. Temperature extremes have been recorded from −66 °F to +94 °F (−54 °C to +34 °C). The average low temperature is in January at −17 °F (−27 °C) with the average high temperature is during July at +73 °F (+22 °C). The annual precipitation averages 12 inches (305 mm) of rain and 37 inches (94 cm) of snow. Fort Wainwright is approximately 190 miles south of the Arctic Circle. The hours where the sun is above the horizon averages 22 hours in June with twilight during the night hours and less than 4 hours in December. The climate creates a short construction season for installation projects. It also potentially contributes to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) among the workforce.

=== Geology ===
Fairbanks falls in a region with discontinuous permafrost, a condition where permafrost is broken by pockets of unfrozen ground. This, coupled with the periglacial effect of seasonal freezing and thawing, can drastically modify the ground surface. Construction engineering in this environment requires additional planning to avoid the potential for hazards of ground movement or collapse.

== Cultural resources ==
=== Historic and archeological sites ===
Fort Wainwright has a Cultural Resources Management Program that is responsible for over 1.6 million acres of Army-managed land with a diverse array of resources including historical buildings, a national historic landmark, archeological sites, and properties of traditional religious and cultural significance. There are over 650 prehistoric archeological sites on Fort Wainwright and its training lands that date from the last ice age (14,000 years ago) to the Alaskan homesteading era. USAG Alaska have several agreements in place in regards to historical findings and archaeological digs. Partnerships include the State of Alaska Historical Preservation office and the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Museum of the North who curates the archeological relics.

=== Native Liaison ===
The U.S. Army Garrison Alaska (USAG Alaska) provides an Alaska Native Liaison that manages the Native Liaison/Government to Government program for Fort Wainwright. Fort Wainwright&#x27;s cantonment and training areas is made up of Army-withdrawn land that support resources that have been utilized by the Alaska Native community for thousands of years. U.S. Army Alaska (USARAK) and USAG Alaska support the policy of tribal self-determination through support for Army&#x27;s government-to-government relationship with tribes and implementing the &quot;Army American Indian and Alaska Native Policy&quot;, Department of Defense (DoD) &quot;American Indian and Alaska Native Policy, the policy’s Alaska Implementation Guidance,&quot; and DoD Instruction 4710.02: &quot;Interactions with Federally-Recognized Tribes.&quot;

== History ==
In the 1930s Alaska was a vast undefended region where Alaska&#x27;s territorial delegates to congress lobbied to obtain a better defense strategy. Then-Lt. Col. Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold led a flight of B-10 bombers from Washington D.C. to Alaska in 1934 scouting for potential airfields. His report recommended the establishment of an air base at Fairbanks which could support cold weather testing and serve as a tactical supply depot.

In 1935, Congress passed the Wilcox National Air Defense Act which authorized the construction of new airbases including one in Alaska for cold weather testing and training. March 1937, President Franklin Roosevelt withdrew public land for the Army in Executive Order 7596 as the location for the airfield and the base. Congress approved appropriated funds in 1939 for the construction of Ladd Field, named after Maj. Arthur Ladd, an Army Air Corps pilot who perished in an airplane crash in South Carolina while under sealed orders.

=== World War II ===
==== Cold-weather test station ====
The construction of Ladd Field began in earnest early in 1940, prompted by the declaration of war in Europe months before. During its first two years of operations, Ladd Field&#x27;s mission was as a cold-weather test station. The station commander of the Cold Weather Test Station was Maj. Dale V. Gaffney. The cold weather station focused primarily on testing aircraft performance and maintenance. Its major goal was to develop standard procedures for servicing and operating aircraft in subzero temperatures and to test various airplane parts and fluids. The testing program looked at other aspects of arctic operations to include clothing, communication, equipment, survival gear, medical issues, and ground support.

During 1940–1942, Ladd Field was devoted to research and considered an &quot;exempt station&quot; from combat. In June 1942, Japan bombed Dutch Harbor, on the Aleutian Island of Unalaska, and occupied the islands of Attu and Kiska. The Cold Weather Test Station was deactivated and Ladd Field came temporarily under control of the 11th Air Force who fell under the Alaska Defense Command. By fall of 1942, the Cold Weather test Station was reactivated and became an exempted research station again.

==== Lend-Lease program ====
In 1942, under Lend-Lease agreements, the United States provided war planes and materials to the Soviet Union to use against Nazi Germany. Ladd Field was selected as the transfer point for Lend-Lease aircraft transiting the Alaska-Siberia (ALSIB) route. More than 7,900 aircraft were eventually delivered to Soviet pilots waiting at Ladd field who would then fly them to Nome and across Siberia to the eastern war front. To facilitate this mission, Ladd Field was transferred to the Air Transport Command (ATC) for the remainder of the war.

Under the ATC, Ladd field expanded with a new hangar and runway along with hundreds of temporary building to house the large workforce needed to support the mission. By June 1945 Ladd Field was capable of billeting 4,555 troops. Cold weather testing continued its mission as a tenant unit on Ladd. The conclusion of WWII marked the end of the Lend-Lease Program in September 1945. Military personnel left Alaska and Ladd Field was transferred from ATC back to 11th Air Force.

==== Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WAC) ====
1st Lt. Woodall was the first WAC to be stationed at Ladd Field, arriving in January 1945 to work as an aerial photographer with the Cold Weather Test Detachment. At Ladd Field, her duties included establishing the Extreme Temperature Operations Unit (ETOU) laboratory that tested photographic equipment on military aircraft. This required her to cross the Arctic Circle in a B-29 at high altitude making her the first armed forces female to fly to the arctic. The 1466th AAF Base Unit Squadron W arrived at Ladd Field in April. Maj. Betty Etten Wiker, then a 1st Lieutenant (1st Lt.) served as the WAC commanding officer at Ladd Field. The WAC served in various positions, from office work to performing field duty as medics and airplane mechanics. One tenth of the Ladd Field WACs were assigned duties within Army Airways Communication System (AACS). The WAC departed from Ladd Field in December 1945 after the end of the Lend-Lease Program.

==== Cold War ====
In 1945, rivalry developed between the United States and the Soviet Union resulting in the Cold War. The proximity of the Soviet Union to Alaska in a post-war long-range bomber age spurred the development of the Arctic front. The Arctic would encompass many activities for the Department of Defense to include use as a forward deployment zone and as a first line of defense in the region. In 1947, due to the National Securities Act, the Air Force was designated as a separate branch from the Army. Ladd Field was renamed Ladd Air Force Base commanded by the 11th Air Force. During this time Eielson airfield was established to supplement Ladd AFB with a separate B-36 bomber mission.

In the early years of the Cold War, Ladd AFB&#x27;s missions included; assessing the Soviet presence in the Arctic by strategic reconnaissance; supplying a regional air defense asset; improvement of the practice of polar navigation; and continued cold weather testing of equipment, clothing and human performance. In 1948, the Army sent the 2nd Infantry Division to Ladd AFB with a mission of ground defense.

During the Korean War in 1950 and through to 1957 Ladd AFB saw a rise in tempo and an increase in their logistics operations. The base became the logistical support center for Alaska&#x27;s defense projects. Research expanded creating an ice station research center to analysis and track polar ice packs; perform geophysics projects and expand communication networks. The 4th Infantry Regiment provided the combat mission man power through 1956.

By 1957, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and satellites reduced the role for Ladd AFB. In 1960, with two major airbases in close proximity, coupled with economic pressures, the Air Force stopped flying operations at Ladd and reassigned them to Eielson AFB and to Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage. The Air Force transferred Ladd to the Army on 1 January 1961, and the installation was renamed Fort Wainwright after WWII General, Jonathan M. Wainwright.

In 1963, the 171st Infantry Brigade (mechanized) was activated at Fort Wainwright to defend Eielson AFB. Several elements of the 171st IN (Mech) deployed to Vietnam in 1966. In 1969, the 171st Infantry transitioned from mechanized to light infantry and were subsequently inactivated in 1972 from Fort Wainwright. Ladd Field was designated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL) on 4 February 1985. Ladd Air Force Base was designated as Ladd Air Force Base Cold War District and was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on the same day. In 1986, Fort Wainwright expanded their mission beyond the Arctic to support world-wide deployments. USARAL was discontinued in 1974. This left the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson to assume control of the Army in Alaska, reporting directly to FORSCOM at Fort McPherson, Georgia. In 1986, the 6th Infantry Division (light) was assigned to Fort Richardson and assumed the role of overall Army Command in Alaska from the 172nd Infantry Brigade. The 6th ID provided a rapid-deployment worldwide strike force and participated in worldwide training events.

=== Post–Cold War ===
In 1994, U.S. Army Alaska (USARAK) was activated and replaced the 6th Infantry Division, reestablishing the Alaskan Command. The 2004 Army Modernization Plan, created to facilitate deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq, created modular brigade combat teams. This configuration transformed the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson into the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), 25th Infantry Division (1/25 SBCT) stationed at Fort Wainwright becoming its dominant warfighting unit. The newly transformed 4/25 BCT (Airborne) remained at Fort Richardson. The mission of the 1-25 SBCT (no &quot;/&quot; is used for this unit) was to deploy rapidly &#x27;to a designated contingency area of operation by air and [conduct] operations either as a separate Brigade Combat Team or under the control of a contingency force headquarters.&quot; Equipped with wheeled Stryker armored vehicles, the brigade filled the gap between light forces like the 4/25 BCT (Airborne) and heavy, armored units. In June 2022, U.S. Army Alaska reflagged to the 11th Airborne Division subsequently making the former 1-25 and 4-25 1st Infantry Brigade and 2nd Infantry Brigade of the 11th Airborne Division, respectively.

====Training and recreation areas====
Fort Wainwright manages over 1.6 million acres of training and recreation land. Training areas include Tanana Flats, Yukon, Donnelly, Black Rapids and Gerstle River. Seasonally, these areas can be used by the military and the public for recreation activities by obtaining a Recreation Access Permit. The U.S. Army Recreation Tracking Systems (USARTRAK) has been established to facilitate public access on Fort Wainwright training lands and allows recreational users to check in by phone or online. The USARTRAK website has updated training area map information depicting impact areas and off limit areas. It also shows when and where certain training areas will be temporarily restricted during training exercises.

Fort Wainwright manages specialized outdoor recreation areas in the cantonment area to include Chena Bend Clubhouse and Golf Course, Birch Hill Ski and snowboard Area, Fischer Skeet range and two RV and tent campgrounds. Fort Wainwright also manages the Seward Military Resort located on the Kenai Peninsula.

== Quality-of-life issues ==
In 2019, a behavioral health epidemiological consultation, or EPICON, was requested after Alaskan Congressman Don Young sent a letter to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army and Commanding General, U.S. Army Medical Command requesting a team of medical professionals to be sent to Fort Wainwright to examine the situation on the ground in relation to a number of reported suicides. Observed findings were consistent with suicide cases in previous EPICONs. Soldiers who died by suicide had indications of multiple risk factors, including chronic pain, relationship issues, and trouble sleeping.

Concurrently, in 2019, the Army initiated a pilot program to target quality-of-life improvements at Fort Irwin, California; Fort Polk, Louisiana; and Fort Wainwright, Alaska. General Gus Perna, Commander for the Army Materiel Command (AMC), emphasized that increasing quality of life across the force remains a top priority for Army senior leaders.

General Perna stated that &quot;Quite frankly, Fort Wainwright is in an austere environment, ...Fort Irwin and Fort Polk are also austere, but it is where we do all of our [brigade combat team] training. We send our best leaders at all levels that go train our BCTs ... to places that don&#x27;t have a lot of quality of life.&quot;

On Fort Wainwright, USARAK and USAG Alaska implemented a number of Quality of Life initiatives that included blackout curtains barracks to boost the ability to sleep during the 24-hours of sunlight in the summer, planning the construction of winter maintenance facilities to improve workplace quality during extreme cold weather and generous leave policies for soldiers allowing for more time with family in an attempt to reduce an isolation effect in an austere environment.

By 2022, the Army and Defense Health Agency began hiring behavioral health providers as well as family life counselors to support the installation&#x27;s soldiers and reduce wait times. This included temporary positions until full-time providers were made available all as part of the Army&#x27;s recently established Mission 100 program. Additionally, resources were made available to new families to include loaner furniture, increased funding and expanded routes for the post shuttle, and increasing access to Alaskan ski facilities. The year prior, Option 20 became available to new Army recruits to enable them to choose Alaska as a duty station, allowing for more region-specific volunteers to be stationed there.

==Environmental issues==
=== Site contamination ===
Since 1978, Fort Wainwright has been participating in the Department of Defense Installation Restoration Program to investigate and clean up contamination. In 1985 and 1986, lead and chromium were detected in monitoring wells at the landfill. In 1987, chromium and tetrahydrofuran were detected in monitoring wells at the proposed housing area, and chromium was detected in soil. About 15,000 people live and work at the fort and obtain drinking water from wells in close proximity to contaminated source areas. The Chena River also runs through the contaminated area of Fort Wainwright.

==== National priorities listing ====
In August 1990 Fort Wainwright was registered on the national priorities list as a Superfund. In most source areas, groundwater is contaminated with solvents and petroleum products, in a few source areas, with pesticides and/or fuel additives. Soil contains some solvents, waste oil, waste fuel/petroleum products, pesticides, paint residues, fuel tank sludge and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Sediments contain PAHs and low level pesticides. Contaminants on the site also include mercury.

==== Taku Gardens ====
To meet the needs of new personnel and their families, construction of 128 homes on a 54-acre housing project known as Taku Gardens began in 2005 on the former communications site. In June, 2005 construction workers noticed &quot;stained soil and unusual odors during excavation of a building foundation&quot; and laboratory testing revealed the presence of PCB at concentrations of up to 115,000 mg/kg - Alaska&#x27;s current clean-up standard is 1 mg/kg. Further testing of the site revealed the presence of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, chlorinated compounds including solvents, herbicides, pesticides, dioxins, and &quot;munitions-related compounds&quot; such as nitroaromatics and propellants. Construction was suspended August–September 2005 and continued until end of 2006. A January, 2007 Army audit questioned &quot;the wisdom of building a family housing complex on top of a known 1950s-era military landfill&quot; and concluded that &quot;the situation with the Taku construction project is the direct result of multiple individuals failing to adhere to Army and federal regulations and guidance. From 2007 to 2010 drums and debris were excavated, PCB contaminated soil was removed and backfilled, but some fuel and volatile organic compound-contaminated soil and groundwater remains on site.

Construction of the housing project resumed during the summer of 2011. In the intervening years, many housing units between Taku Gardens and the main gate were reconstructed or renovated, with new housing built as well. Immediately northeast of Taku Gardens, Bear Paw was built on a part of the former site of Bassett Army Hospital, while construction of new homes began on the rest of the site in 2011. Immediately northeast of Bear Paw, Denali Village, a much larger development, was constructed between Glass Park and the former billeting. Taku Gardens area, the newer housing across from Bassett Hospital was renamed to Tanana Trails in 2015.

==== Hangar 6 ====
In June, 2006, civilian construction workers at Aircraft Maintenance Hangar No. 6 – known by the Corps of Engineers to be a designated Hazardous Waste Accumulation point – were overcome by fumes described as &quot;pungent, chalky and metallic tasting&quot; and suffered nausea, headaches and other symptoms. A state health report concluded that &quot;an unknown, volatile chemical likely caused nerve damage to the disabled workers.&quot; More than 30 workers were hospitalized and at least 4 have suffered lasting disabilities. The workers initiated a civil suit against the Army which was dismissed because the workers were limited to state workers’ compensation as their only relief.

==== Underground storage fuel tanks ====
EPA inspections found that from at least 2012 to 2013, Fort Wainwright failed to monitor underground storage tanks regularly, perform leak detection tests, and investigate suspected releases. The Army paid a penalty of nearly $158,700.

==Education==
The school district for dependents living on-post is the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District (FNSBSD). Residents on-post, for the elementary level level, are zoned to any of these: Arctic Light Elementary School, Hunter Elementary School, and Ladd Elementary School K-8 school. For middle school, residents may choose between Tanana Middle School or Ladd Elementary&#x27;s grade 7-8 program. The zoned high school is Lathrop High School.

Previously Ticasuk Brown Elementary School took students from Fort Wainwright.

<doc id="1218794" wikidata="Q1364818" url="?curid=1218794" title="List of warez groups">
<text>Warez groups are teams of individuals who have participated in the organized unauthorized publication of films, music, or other media, as well as those who can reverse engineer and crack the digital rights management (DRM) measures applied to commercial software. This is a list of groups, both web-based and warez scene groups, which have attained notoriety outside of their respective communities. A plurality of warez groups operate within the so-called warez scene, though as of 2019 a large amount of software and game warez is now distributed first via the web. Leaks of releases from warez groups operating within the &quot;scene&quot; still constitute a large amount of warez shared globally. Between 2003 and 2009 there were 3,164 active groups within the warez scene, with the majority of these groups being active for no more than two months and with only a small fraction being active for many years. The warez scene is a very competitive and volatile environment, largely a symptom of participation in its community being illegal in most countries. Groups are generally not driven by profit, but by reputation.
==Groups==

===3DM===

3DM is a Chinese video game cracking group. Their founder and leader is reported to be Su Feifei, more commonly known by the pseudonym &quot;Bird Sister&quot; (). Little else is known about Su, other than that her year of birth is speculated to be 1979. Unusual for piracy groups, 3DM&#x27;s members have public profiles on the social network Sina Weibo, and use a blog to inform the public about their activities. Some members of 3DM have previously been part of NETSHOW (now known as ALI213), a group which released Chinese language copies of games using stolen cracks directly to warez scene FTP sites.

3DM were one of the first peer to peer file sharing groups to offer cracks for games which utilized DRM produced by Denuvo. As newer versions of Denuvo DRM became more challenging to reverse engineer, 3DM gave up trying to crack games with Denuvo DRM.

In 2016 the group claimed that piracy of games produced by large developers and publishers would be impossible in the coming years, due to the technological challenges of reverse engineering and ultimately cracking the virtualization and licensing schemes employed by new DRM solutions like Denuvo. One of the most notable groups on the web at the time, they publicly announced a year hiatus from developing cracks for games. Since returning in 2017, 3DM have only released games which use Steam licensing, only releasing copies of better protected games which include cracks made by other groups. This practice has been criticized by the groups whose cracks were included in releases under the 3DM name.

===CLASS===

CLASS (also known as &quot;CLS&quot;) was a warez group which was the target of federal raids such as Operation Fastlink. They were a global group with members worldwide, often releasing game &quot;rips&quot;. The group ceased operations in 2004 after their 1,234th release.

===CODEX===
CODEX (also known as &quot;CDX&quot;) – was a warez group founded at the end of February 2014. They were known for releasing copies of games which used Steam licensing and also for emulating Ubisoft&#x27;s Uplay digital rights management protection. They were accused by the warez group SKIDROW of stealing their code to crack &quot;Trials Fusion,&quot; something CODEX denied, stating that they had written their own code for the DRM emulation. From 2016 to 2020 they have been one of the most active warez groups releasing commercial computer games with over 3700 releases in less than 6 years, compared to older groups like SKIDROW having fewer than 2500 over more than a decade of activity.

In late 2017 CODEX gained notoriety by becoming the third scene group (and fifth overall entity) to crack Denuvo DRM when they released a cracked version of &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot; on its release date. CODEX collaborated with STEAMPUNKS on at least one game which used Denuvo DRM, South Park: The Fractured but Whole, which they released under the name &quot;CODEPUNKS&quot;. In February 2018 CODEX began releasing cracked copies of games from the Microsoft Windows Store. In mid-2018 CODEX began releasing cracked copies of games featuring the latest versions of Denuvo DRM, including updated versions of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins and Far Cry 5, both of which used Uplay licensing DRM and contained additional anti-modification and anti-debugging code through the use of VMProtect. On February 1, 2019, CODEX published a cracked copy of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, which used Denuvo DRM, 7 days after the worldwide commercial release of the game. In late June 2019, CODEX released two cracked copies of games which utilized Denuvo DRM, Shadow of the Tomb Raider and a cracked updated version of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. 

These cracks were previously released on the web attributed to the Russian cracker &quot;Empress&quot;. Later, a cracker who self-identified as C0000005 began releasing cracks under the name Empress as well, suggesting that they are one and the same and that C0000005 had access to source code for CODEX&#x27;s cracks. On June 27, 2019 CODEX released a crack for Star Wars Battlefront 2, about 527 days after its commercial release. On October 29, 2019 they published a cracked copy of Borderlands 3, another game distributed with Denuvo DRM, 46 days after release.

In late 2019, a crack developed by CODEX for Need for Speed: Heat, which uses Denuvo DRM, was leaked online, likely through their network of testers. Normally, the final cracks published by CODEX made use of anti-debugging tools like VMProtect or Themida, to impede reverse engineering efforts. This unfinished crack was not similarly protected. Subsequently, CODEX did not release any cracks for games using Denuvo DRM until June 2020, when they released cracked copies of Team Sonic Racing, Trials of Mana, The Quiet Man, and an updated version of Far Cry: New Dawn.

On February 23, 2022, CODEX announced its retirement in its cracked release of The Sims 4: My Wedding Stories. The group cited the lack of competition in the cracking scene as a sign that CODEX had accomplished its founding goal in 2014, which was to compete with RELOADED, &quot;the dominating PC games group at the time.&quot;

===CONSPIR4CY===
&quot;CONSPIR4CY&quot; (releasing mostly as &quot;CPY&quot;) is a warez group founded in 1999 in Italy. They rose in notoriety after releasing &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider and&quot; &quot;Inside&quot; in August 2016 under the name of &quot;CONSPIR4CY&quot;, though they resumed using the &#x27;CPY&#x27; tag shortly thereafter with the release of their cracked copy of &quot;Doom&quot; in September 2016. They became the first group to create proper cracks for games protected by the third iteration of Denuvo DRM software.

They cracked &quot;Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&quot; only five days after its release, at the time the shortest amount of time taken to develop a crack for a Denuvo DRM-protected game. They also cracked &quot;Mass Effect: Andromeda&quot;, only ten days after its release. In July 2017 the warez group SKIDROW criticized the methods used by CONSPIR4CY to crack games using Denuvo DRM. In early 2018, CPY released cracked copies of &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot; and &quot;Far Cry 5&quot;, which were compiled with the most recent version of Denuvo DRM, and had additional anti-modification and anti-debugging features through the use of VMProtect software and EasyAntiCheat. In November 2018 CPY released cracks for &quot;HITMAN 2&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot;, &quot;A Way Out&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&quot;, &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2019&quot;, &quot;FIFA 19&quot; - all of which featured the latest version of Denuvo DRM, with some using additional custom DRM or off the shelf DRM such as EACore and VMProtect. In December 2018, CPY published a cracked copy of &quot;Just Cause 4&quot;, which used the latest version of Denuvo DRM, on the day after its release. They also released a crack for &quot;Battlefield V&quot; on December 22, days after its official release. In January 2019, CPY released cracked copies of &quot;Ace Combat 7&quot;, &quot;Mutant Year Zero&quot;, and &quot;Strange Brigade&quot;, as well as the first episode of &quot;Life Is Strange 2&quot; (titled &quot;Roads&quot;) - all 4 titles using the latest versions of Denuvo DRM.

In February 2019, CPY released &quot;Metro Exodus&quot;, which used the latest version of Denuvo DRM available, within 5 days of its release, as well as the second episode of &quot;Life Is Strange 2&quot;, titled &quot;Rules&quot;. In September 2019, CPY published a cracked copy of the game &quot;Octopath Traveler&quot;, 93 days after its release. In November 2019, CPY released a cracked copy of &quot;Heavy Rain&quot; which featured the latest version of Denuvo DRM. After a long hiatus, CPY became active again in October 2020, releasing cracked copies of eFootball PES 2021, &quot;A Total War Saga: Troy&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Death Stranding&quot; in a single day, all of which featured the latest version of Denuvo DRM. On October 18, CPY released &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&quot;, followed by &quot;Crysis Remastered&quot; on October 21, which both used Denuvo DRM.

===DEViANCE===
One of the most prolific warez groups active from 1998 to 2006. Their dissolution has been described as the end of an era, and the current affiliation of ex-DEViANCE members is a reoccurring argument between groups. Describing members of a modern warez group as ex-DEViANCE became something of a joke within the warez scene.

===DrinkOrDie===

DrinkOrDie (also known as &quot;DoD&quot;) members were targeted by law enforcement in raids stemming from Operation Buccaneer.
DOD was considered the most famous Software Piracy group in the warez group history, formed in Russia in the early 90s and 
was known for its diverse leadership and influence, combined with members from Europe, the USA, Australia, and Israel. 

===Echelon===

Echelon was a warez group which specialized in the release and distribution of console games, such as Dreamcast ISOs.

===EViLiSO===
Released &quot;American Pie&quot; on the Internet 3 months before its theatrical release. They branded their releases with a digital watermark of the letter &quot;Z&quot; which appeared in the corner of the frame. The bootleggers were associated with a web site in Argentina devoted to Quake.

===EVO===
EVO (short for EVOLUTiON), is a Portuguese release group mostly known for releasing leaked screeners of films before their official release. In an email interview with TorrentFreak, the group stated that they were motivated by &quot;fun&quot; rather than profit, and blamed movie studios for driving piracy by not making media more accessible to consumers. Movie industry insiders viewed EVO as a major threat. In 2021 EVO released a high quality copy of the blockbuster &quot;Dune&quot; before its official U.S. release in theaters and on HBO Max.
The Netflix movies The Power of the Dog and The Guilty leaked before their official premiere from what appears to be film festival screeners, not from a typical award screener sent out to critics and awards voters. In 2022 an early Blu-ray copy of Spider-Man: No Way Home leaked online weeks before the official physical release, but in November that year the group stopped releasing new titles. This was highly unusual as they previously uploaded over a dozen titles each week. ACE boss Jan van Voorn informed TorrentFreak that several people connected to EVO were tracked down by the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment. That year, no notable screeners leaked for the first time in over two decades.

===FAiRLiGHT===

FAiRLiGHT (releasing cracked games as &quot;FLT&quot;) is one of the oldest groups in warez scene, founded in 1987. As of 2017 the group seemingly focuses on demos and art, with their most recent release of cracked software in December 2016. FAiRLiGHT members were apprehended in raids stemming from the law enforcement Operation Fastlink. As of May 2021, a group using the name FLT has been actively releasing games using Steam DRM. Notable releases are: &quot;Days Gone&quot;, &quot;Guilty Gear Strive&quot;, and &quot;Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition&quot; among many others. It is believed they are the same people behind the groups HOODLUM, DOGE and VACE.

===Hoodlum===
Hoodlum (also known as HLM) mainly focused on cracking games which utilized digital rights management solutions offered by Safedisc and Securom. They were targeted as part of the Operation Site Down raids in 2005. In July 2018, some group using the HOODLUM name resumed releasing unauthorized copies of games.

===The Humble Guys===

The Humble Guys (also known as &quot;THG&quot;) were the first warez group to make use of NFO files to document their releases.

===HATRED===
Founded in late 2006, HATRED was very active during 2006 to 2007. ViTALiTY has claimed that HATRED were former members of DEViANCE. Some of their major releases included Rainbow Six: Vegas and Resident Evil 4. Their last release was in August 2008.

===HYBRID===
HYBRID (also known as &quot;HBD&quot;) was founded in 1993. HYBRID later split up when the US-members founded DYNAMIX (later PRESTIGE and PARADIGM).

===International Network of Crackers===

International Network of Crackers (also known as &quot;INC&quot;) was one of the premier cracking/releasing warez groups for the IBM PC during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The majority of their releases during 1993 were educational games for children. By early 1994, INC had completely disappeared from the warez scene.

===Kalisto===

Kalisto is a console warez group established in March 1998 which specializes in the release and distribution of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 ISO images, briefly moonlighting on the Dreamcast platform in mid-to-late 2000.

===maVen===
maVen was a film release group from October 2005 until the summer of 2006. Releases from maVen stopped when the FBI caught Gérémi Adam, one of its key members. The 27-year-old Montreal resident has been sentenced to two and a half months in prison and was also ordered to complete 100 hours of community service. He pleaded guilty to distributing two major motion pictures: &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;How to Eat Fried Worms&quot;. After the bust, releases ceased until another group called &quot;maVenssupplieR&quot; immediately took up the slack. In April 2010, the 28-year-old Gérémi Adam died of a drug overdose at the Pointe-aux-Trembles home he shared with his girlfriend, Cynthia Laporte.

mVs (Maven Supplier) released a workprint of &quot;Halloween&quot; three days before its official release on August 27, 2007.

===Myth===

Myth was a warez group, focused on cracking and ripping PC games. Besides ripped games, the group also released trainers and cracked updates for games.

===PARADOX===

PARADOX (also known as &quot;PDX&quot; and sometimes &quot;PARADiSO&quot;) was founded in 1989, mainly cracking games for the Amiga. They went on to crack software for the Windows operating system and other consoles. They were one of the earliest groups to successfully crack Windows Vista, which was supposed to be a difficult task based on changes Microsoft had made to the activation scheme for the software.

PARADOX attracted attention from 2011 to 2012, as they published files for playing unauthorized copies of games on the Sony PlayStation 3. These copies required the use of a commercially-available USB dongle, which has been criticized as a form of commercial copyright infringement, and described as a &quot;ReDRM&quot; dongle because copies of game binaries were essentially decrypted using Sony&#x27;s official keys, and then re-encrypted using the keys stored on the dongle, requiring the use of the dongle to bypass the DRM which had been added back to the games. It is unclear whether groups like PARADOX had any affiliation with the creators and distributors of so-called &quot;ReDRM&quot; dongles, including potentially having profited from the release of these dongles by drumming up demand by releasing copies of games which only worked when used with the dongle.

PARADOX is well known for developing a utility known as &quot;Preee&quot;, which automates the creation of NFO files and the packaging of warez releases into multi-part RAR archives and subsequent creation of ZIP archives containing those RAR files depending on the warez scene rules being followed.

In July 2020, after 3 years of inactivity, someone published a cracked copy of Monster Hunter: World, a game utilizing Denuvo DRM, with its Iceborn DLC using the name and NFO template of the group PARADOX.

===Phrozen Crew===
Phrozen Crew (PC) was one of the most popular groups of computer software crackers, utilizing the tagline &quot;We always get what we want!&quot; .

===Pirates With Attitudes===

The Pirates With Attitudes (also known as &quot;PWA&quot;) were a major international warez release group from 1992 until 2000. The group was formed by two former INC members known by the pseudonyms Orion and Bar Manager. PWA members were the subjects of law enforcement raids after the passing of the No Electronic Theft or &quot;NET&quot; Act.

===Project X===
Project X exclusively released games for the Xbox. In 2004, Project X was named as one of six groups targeted as part of Operation Fastlink by the United States Department of Justice.

===Rabid Neurosis===

Rabid Neurosis (&quot;RNS&quot;) was an MP3 warez release organization which was founded on June 6, 1996.

===Radium===
Several verses of the rap song &quot;Hackers and the Crackers&quot; by Zearle are devoted to the group Radium. In 2004, evidence was presented that some of the system sound files included with the Microsoft Windows XP operating system, such as , were authored using an unlicensed version of Sound Forge which was supplied by Radium.

===Razor 1911===

Razor 1911 (also known as &quot;RZR&quot; and &quot;RazorDOX&quot;) was founded in 1985 in Norway. Its primary bulletin board system was based in Norway. The group&#x27;s main focus was to crack software for the Commodore 64 personal computer, but they also released Amiga and the IBM PC software. They were subjects of raids in Operation Buccaneer and Operation Fastlink.

The group made a comeback in June 2006, and since then has cracked modern copy protection schemes such as Rockstar Games Social Club, Ubisoft&#x27;s persistent Internet connection requiring DRM, and Battle.NET. In March 2012, Razor1911 announced that their tester and coder DYCUS, who had an active role in making trainers and testing the group&#x27;s releases, had died of cancer. Since then, the group has seldom released cracked games, focusing on DRM-free titles from GOG.com, as well as games for Linux and macOS.

===RELOADED===

RELOADED (also known as &quot;RLD!&quot;) was founded in June 2004. Their founders are believed to be ex-DEViANCE members, though their rival group HOODLUM claimed in December 2004 that none of DEViANCE&#x27;s previous leaders had ever been part of RELOADED. The group has cracked several modern protection schemes like SecuROM 8, Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.NET, and Arxan Anti-Tamper. In 2022 the group was reported as still active and working with team BTCR.

===REVOLT===
REVOLT gained popularity for creating solutions for cracked games to have working multiplayer features, and later for cracks of games using Denuvo DRM which were released by its founder. REVOLT was founded by a Bulgarian teenager, who used the online handle Voksi. In July 2018 the REVOLT website began redirecting to the website of the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior. The same month, Voksi, then in his twenties, reported having been raided by Bulgarian law enforcement in response to a complaint filed by Denuvo parent company Irdeto. In comments made to media organisation TorrentFreak, Voksi alleged that &quot;five or six officers, including two from Bulgaria&#x27;s General Directorate for Combatting Organized Crime (GDBOB) and others from a local police station&quot; entered his home and seized personal computing equipment.

===Risciso===
Risciso (stylized as &quot;RISCISO&quot;) was an online warez group, founded in approximately 1993, dedicated to distributing newly released copyrighted software, games and movies.
Risciso was founded as a co-group of RiSC (Rise in Superior Couriering), which was the most famous trading group in the BBS era and the beginning of the file sharing era on the internet.

===SKIDROW===
SKIDROW is a well-known cracking group originally formed in 1990, cracking games for the Amiga platform, and having used the motto &quot;Twice the Fun - Double the Trouble!&quot; since then. A piece of cracktro software released by SKIDROW in 1992 with the game 10 Pinball Fantasies contained a complete list of their membership at the time. The most recent incarnation of SKIDROW began releasing unauthorized copies of games in June 2007, when they announced their return to cracking software.
They were the first scene group to crack the version of Ubisoft&#x27;s Uplay DRM which required players to have a persistent Internet connection to Ubisoft&#x27;s licensing servers, first in Assassin&#x27;s Creed II and then in Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands.

The group has released cracks for Denuvo Anti-Tamper protected games, Yesterday Origins and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - A Criminal Past. It is believed the former had a bad implementation of Denuvo which made it easier to reverse engineer, mostly due to a lack of support from Denuvo for protecting games written in C# and specifically games using the Unity game engine, with this lack of support having been previously demonstrated by an anonymous independent cracker having developed a crack for Syberia 3, which also used Unity. The crack for the latter was actually determined to be a modified executable file from the game Deus Ex: Breach, a free game which did not incorporate Denuvo&#x27;s software, released by the same developers and utilizing the same engine, which had been modified slightly to load the assets from Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. A plurality of SKIDROW&#x27;s current releases are cracked versions of games that make use of Steam licensing.

In July 2017, in a statement released to commemorate their 10th consecutive year of releases since re-emerging in the PC game cracking scene, SKIDROW made cryptic remarks that the techniques used by CONSPIR4CY, STEAMPUNKS, and members of the Steam Underground warez forum to crack modern copy protections are not proper. These criticisms were themselves criticized on the web, as SKIDROW&#x27;s apparent standards for a proper crack would seemingly disqualify both their most notable crack of Ubisoft&#x27;s persistent online connection requiring DRM, which they emulated, and their most recent notable release of a Denuvo-protected game, which they cracked by modifying the executable from another game.

===Steam Underground===
While not precisely a group, the community centered around the Steam Underground web forum (also known as cs.rin.ru) and its members have been a notable source of warez development, releases, tools, tutorials, discussions, and information pertinent to other groups since at least 2008. The forum has both Russian and English language boards, and is the home to a number of projects primarily focused on cracking, emulating, and otherwise extending the capabilities of Steam and games released on Steam. Games on other platforms may also be discussed on their own board.

The forum and its members have often been referenced as some variation of &quot;the Russian site/forum&quot; or directly by name by warez scene groups in statements which mention the site. At least one prominent member of the forum has been in contact with warez scene release group members, as they published several non-public cracks for The Sims 4 which they attributed to tools or methods obtained from the cracking group RELOADED. This individual was then given access or knowledge related to EA&#x27;s Origin licensing scheme and DRM, as they began to release their own cracks for updated versions of The Sims 4 based on the same cracking technique.

The site is also notable for being one of the few that actively distributes cracked games for the Oculus Quest VR headset.

Steam Underground encountered a financial problem because their biggest supporter, Russian Information Network (RIN), stopped sponsoring the forum after 17 years of support for the Underground. As a result, Google Drive uploads by the member RUI are no longer available because he can no longer afford the payment that Google demands.

===STEAMPUNKS===
STEAMPUNKS released unauthorized copies of games which utilized Denuvo digital rights management solutions in 2017, with their first releases being copies of Dishonored 2, ADR1FT, Planet Coaster, and ABZU. Releases by STEAMPUNKS include a license generator which creates a valid hardware ID-based license file. These licenses appear to be identical to those generated by the web-based activation servers operated by Denuvo, and they do not trigger Denuvo&#x27;s DRM copy protection. This method attracted some attention upon its debut, while license generators and &quot;keymakers&quot; were fairly common in commercial software piracy, they had fallen out of use in cracking games as most games moved to the license management capabilities provided by Steam and other digital distribution platforms. One negative reaction to STEAMPUNKS&#x27; license maker came from the warez group SKIDROW in a statement from the group released in July 2017. In late September 2017, STEAMPUNKS became the first warez group to release cracked copies of Denuvo DRM-protected games within 24 hours of their commercial availability, releasing both Total War: Warhammer II and FIFA 18 on the same day they were made available for consumers. STEAMPUNKS collaborated with CODEX to crack South Park: The Fractured but Whole upon its release, with the cracked release appearing under the portmanteau group name &quot;CODEPUNKS&quot;. Following this and one other collaborative release, STEAMPUNKS became inactive, while CODEX continued to publish cracked versions of games. At least one of STEAMPUNKS&#x27; crackers was originally a member of X-FORCE (known for their Adobe software keygens), and at least one other member of STEAMPUNKS would become a member of CODEX after the group became inactive.

===Superior Art Creations===

Superior Art Creations (&quot;SAC&quot;) is an underground artscene group which caters primarily to, and is well known within, the warez scene.

===Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated===

Tristar and Red Sector, Inc. (also known as &quot;TRSI&quot;) began as an alliance between two warez groups: Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated. They were formed in 1990 as a cooperative Commodore 64 demo coding and cracking group. TRSI migrated from the Commodore 64 release platform to the Amiga and IBM-PC, and eventually branched off into the console gaming scene before finally disbanding their warez division. In late 2003, TRSI became inactive and remains so today.

===United Software Association===

The United Software Association (also known as &quot;USA&quot;) was a prominent IBM PC games and applications warez group during the 1990s. USA formed an alliance with the PC warez division of Fairlight which was known as &quot;USA/FLT&quot;. In late January 1992, several members of USA were arrested by the United States Secret Service and the Farmington Hills, Michigan police for credit card fraud.

===ViTALiTY===
ViTALiTY (also known as VTY) was founded in May 2005. It has been suggested they were former members of DEViANCE. The group was considered blacklisted by many in the warez scene in October 2007, something ViTALiTY claims was orchestrated by rival groups RELOADED and FAiRLiGHT, though the latter claim they were against it. ViTALiTY was accused of either reporting or threatening to report members of other groups to the FBI, though ViTALiTY claimed a senior member of RELOADED threatened to do the same to them. ViTALiTY&#x27;s last release was an update to Dragon Age: Origins on 7 January 2011.

<text>Trot () is a genre of Korean popular music, known for its use of repetitive rhythm and vocal inflections. Originating during the Japanese occupation of Korea in the first half of the 20th century, trot was influenced by many genres of Korean, Japanese, American, and European music.

Trot has been around for almost 100 years and its distinct singing style has been continuously evolving. Trot music developed in rhythms during Japanese colonial rule. After the liberation of the Korean peninsula and the Korean War (1950-1953), artists such as Lee Mi-Ja, Choi Sook-ja, Bae Ho, Nam Jin, Na Hun-a, Joo Hyun-mi and many others helped to make trot popular. With the rise of K-pop from the 1990s onwards, trot music lost some popularity and was viewed as more old-fashioned. However, from the 2000s onwards, young trot singers such as Jang Yoon-jeong, Hong Jin-young, K-pop singers such as Super Junior-T, Daesung, MJ and Lizzy, renewed interest in the genre and popularised it among young listeners.

Although the genre originated before the division of the Korean peninsula, it is actually now mainly sung in South Korea; the associated pop culture, together with nursery rhymes, new folk songs in North Korea were categorized as &quot;Enlightenment Period song&quot; (계몽기 가요). It is no longer composed as propaganda music has since displaced other musical forms. Those songs were only orally-recorded. It was intentionally revived during Kim Jung Il administration: in the late 2000s, Korean Central Television aired a TV program that introduced those &quot;Enlightenment songs&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;trot&quot; is a shortened form of &quot;foxtrot&quot;, a style of ballroom dance that influenced the simple two-beat rhythm of trot music. Except two-beat rhythm, trot and foxtrot do not share any other notable characteristics.

== Characteristics ==
===Rhythm===

The trot is known for being composed in a two-beat rhythm, also known as the duple metre. In its early days, trot music was often composed using the pentatonic scale and minor keys. This pattern is called an anhemitonic scale or anhemitonic pentatonic scale, which was characteristic in Korean &#x27;Gyeonggi-minyo&#x27; and other folk music such as early Japanese enka.
The pentatonic scale consists of five degrees: of the natural major scale, the 4th and 7th degrees are omitted, and to form the pentatonic minor scale, all these 5 degrees will descend 3 degrees. Before 1950, the pentatonic minor scale dominated in popularity, however, the pentatonic major scale had started to become more popular. After the Japanese occupation, trot music was composed using the heptatonic scale and major keys. In trot music, lower tones are generally sung with vibrato, while higher tones are sung with the flexing or turning technique called &#x27;kkeokk-ki&#x27; (literally means flexing, ).

===Kkeokk-ki===

The &#x27;Kkeokk-ki&#x27; technique may be better explained by the gruppetto ornament of classical music theory. A note is figured as if it had been split into two or four subsidiary notes. And the voice is inflected to these imaginary notes: e.g. one quarter note is split into four sixteenth notes: (1) one in original pitch - (2) one in upper pitch - (3) one in lower pitch - (1) one in original pitch again (see below image, the example measure is from Na Hun-a&#x27;s &quot;물레방아 도는데&quot;, &quot;Turning Waterwell&quot;). Kkeokk-ki happens in the transition between two notes in the original pitch. For ordinary listeners, it is not easy to quickly perceive the subtlety of this technique. However, any trot singer can hardly do without the elaborated effect of Kkeokk-ki.

===Lyrics===

Most of trot&#x27;s lyrical content is based on two popular themes, although they vary with the times: 1) love and parting, 2) longing for a sweet home. Some see the origin of this sentimentalism in &quot;colonial tragedy&quot;. But that may well be related to the ancient tradition of resentment or deep sorrow () in Korean culture. Elegiac song texts with minor scales are the most common. In addition to the elegiac rhythm and the content of the lyrics, the &#x27;new stream&#x27; in the theater (), introduced in the 1910s from Japan, has also contributed to the fact that trot is dominated by the moods of compassion and pain. Because the pieces of this &#x27;new stream&#x27; frequently dealt with themes such as the family tragedy, love affairs - the best pieces were &quot;Janghanmong&quot; (), &quot;Cheated in Love, Cried of Money&quot; (); the great hit song &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Hongdo&quot; (홍도야 울지 마라) sings just the tragic story of the piece &quot;Cheated in love, Cried of money&quot;. So it is understandable that many Koreans tend to be sad or compassionate when they hear trot songs. Sentimental words like &#x27;crying&#x27; and &#x27;leaving&#x27; have been consistently the most popular. But speech levels, which are recognizable at a sentence&#x27;s final ending in Korean, have changed with the times; since 1990 the sentence in the low-level of politeness () is often used.

===Performance===
Trot music is mainly performed by one singer or at most duet. It is rare for a trot singer to play any instrument while singing. The playing of the instruments has something of an accompaniment function. The song usually being played by a band orchestra. Band orchestras use mostly backing vocals, usually consisting of 4 female vocalists, but rarely of mixed vocalists. The trot music shows often include a group of dancers. Thus, a typical broadcasting band orchestra for trot consists of instrument players, chorus, and dancers. Of course, it is possible for a singer to perform a song accompanied by one or two instruments; e.g. Joo Hyun-mi sings in her YouTube channel, accompanied only by guitar and accordion. Apart from the talent of a singer, the composer plays an important role in the success of a trot song. Since there are few trot singers and songwriters, a trot singer often gets his own singing style with the composer who always prepares a song for release with the singer.

==Naming==

The name &quot;trot&quot; has been widely used since the 1980s, even though the designation itself dates back to the 1950s. In the 1920s the name &quot;yuhaeng-changga&quot; () was in use; this name comes from the fact that &quot;yuhaeng&quot; means &quot;trend, fashion, popular&quot;, and all sorts of western music, e.g. hymn, nursery rhyme, folksong, etc., as well as Japanese &quot;enka&quot;, which were introduced to the Korean people at the end of the 19th century, were called &quot;changga&quot;; popular music in the western style was called &quot;yuhaeng-changga&quot;, later abbreviated &quot;yuhaengga&quot; ().

The trot is sometimes referred to as &quot;seongin-gayo&quot; (), which means &quot;music for
adults&quot;. Trot also has a newer name, &quot;jeontong-gayo&quot; (), literally &quot;traditional popular song&quot;. Calling trot &quot;jeontong-gayo&quot; may implicitly refer to national self-confidence and give people a sense of self-esteem, so that the uncomfortable suspicion of foreign origin would be eased. The name &quot;daejung-gayo&quot; (), or &quot;music for the public&quot;, has been used historically for trot, but it is a wider term for all sorts of popular music, so K-pop for example, also falls under the label of &quot;daejung-gayo&quot;. Additionally, instead of &quot;teuroteu&quot; (), the term &quot;teurot&quot; () is occasionally seen in written Korean.

==History==
===Origin===
Trot music originated in Korea during the Japanese occupation of Korea. It is believed that trot&#x27;s closest ancestors were Japanese enka. After the liberation of the Korean peninsula, however, trot has continued on its own path. There is an investigation showing that the songs that were published in Korea and Japan between 1945 and 1950 used in both countries pretty much the same amount of duple metre rhythm in a minor scale.
It is sometimes asserted that trot&#x27;s origins can be traced to &quot;siga&quot; (), a traditional form of Korean poetry, although this only partially explains origins since it is relevant to poetic and lyrical aspects only. Some suggest that trot could have been influenced by Korean folk music, which does have some resemblance to trot&#x27;s vocal inflections, even if Korean traditional music&#x27;s rhythmic structure differs from trot&#x27;s fixed duple metre. It was true that a genre of &quot;Sin-minyo&quot; (new folk song, ) was in circulation in the 1930s; but this music was simply modified versions of traditional folk songs e.g. Arirang or &#x27;Taryeong&#x27; songs accompanied by Western instruments.

It is an old controversial issue whether trot originated during Japanese colonial rule and thus is not a genuine Korean popular music. This problem has caused quite a stir twice. Once the government took a position in the 1960s that the supposedly &#x27;Japanese-tinged&#x27; songs suffered at the hands of the censor. The second discussion took place by the musicians and cultural critics in the 80s, called the &#x27;Ppongjjak debate&#x27;.

====&#x27;Japanese-tinged&#x27; censorship====
The particular hostile emotional response to the former Japanese colonial rule has led the government to banish the Japanese legacy. This also happened in the cultural area. There were listed songs that seemed to have been influenced by enka. At the time, such songs were disparagingly called &#x27;Japanese-tinged&#x27; () and the songs that violated conventional morality were called &#x27;degenerate songs&#x27; (). First, in 1965 the broadcasters decided not to send out any more &#x27;Japanese-tinged&#x27; songs. To it responded the singer association with the vehement protest. After that, in 1968 &#x27;Art and Cultural Ethics Commission&#x27; (the earliest commission of today&#x27;s &#x27;Korea Communications Standards Commission&#x27;) decided to banish 108 songs and later more; the reasons were mainly &#x27;obscene, vulgar, degenerated and Japanese-tinged&quot;. Lee Mi-ja&#x27;s &quot;Camellia Lady&quot; was on the list in 1965 as well as in 1968. She once recalled, &quot;The then-President Park Chung Hee, who was blamed for the censorship, did not know that the song had been banned, so he asked her to sing it at a banquet.&quot; The censorship culminated in the 1970s, most affected were the songs of the so-called &#x27;acoustic guitar singers&#x27;. The ban on &quot;Camellia Lady&quot; and others was lifted in 1987. However, this kind of censorship, which finds much of its breeding ground from history, is still ongoing. Just as &quot;Japanese-tinged&quot; trot songs were banished, so the anti-Japanese leftists in the 2010s insisted on having to replace the school songs composed by pro-Japan musicians.

====Ppongjjak debate====
In 1984 this dispute entered the national discourse in South Korea. The debate, initiated in a provocative article &quot;Who does claim Ppongjjak as ours?&quot; in 1984, centered on whether or not trot music originated from either Japanese or Korean music. Because the genre was borrowed from Japan during the colonial period of Korea, as well as incorporated Japanese song influences in Changga, the genre has been subject to questioning its Korean identity. This Korean identity question is subtly rooted in the argument that the Japanese cultural suppression policy led to Koreans uncritically accepting the popular music trot influenced by enka. Anti-Japanese critics went so far as to tag trot as artifacts from the Japanese colonial period. This probably one-sided statement was answered by musicians and critics who saw things differently and responded; the claim on the part of Korean classical music that trot is Japanese-tinged and thus such songs should be forbidden, is a useless judgment of the colonial victim mentality. The debate back and forth was held in the newspaper &quot;Hanguk Daily News&quot; from November to December 1984. Since no concrete evidence has arisen to validate either side, this debate continues to exist when discussing the origins of trot music.

===1920s–1950: Formation===
Before the 1920s, there was little information about popular Western music. In the 1920s, some recordings with a vague resemblance to trot were heard around Korea, but these were likely forms of Western popular music. To detail trot music&#x27;s beginnings, the following songs are presented as &#x27;forerunners&#x27;:

Singer Yun Sim-deok () recorded &quot;In Praise of Death&quot; () 1926 by Japanese Nitto Records. It is often regarded as the first &#x27;Yuhaengchangga&#x27;. Yun Sim-deok was a soprano. She had an affair with a married man, with whom she ran away and escaped: on a boat trip to Japan in 1927, she threw herself into the sea with the lover - there is a Korean film about this story. After her death, just such a story made the song widely known. The song was not originally composed, but Yun Sim-deok wrote lyrics and then transferred it to the waltz melody of &quot;Waves of the Danube&quot; by Ion Ivanovici. The song itself actually contains a few of the characteristics of trot.

&quot;Pupil Song&quot; (), first recorded in May 1921 and sung by a Korean Christian youth group, became popular. This song belongs to marching songs. The melody of &quot;Pupil song&quot; was borrowed from &quot;Railway Song&quot; (鉄道唱歌), which Japanese composer Oono Umekawa had composed in 1900. Who wrote the lyrics of &quot;Pupil song&quot; is unknown. Several singers, e.g. Chae Gyu-yeop (), Go Un-bong (), recorded this song. The song became popular because the encouraging mood, evoked by a beat typical of marching songs, was appealing to those oppressed by Japanese rule. On the other hand, the Japanese &quot;Railway Song&quot; was later adapted to fit North Korean communist ideals, titled &quot;Revolutionary Song Against Japan&quot; () and &quot;Rise Proletariat&quot; ().

A new contemporary music style, called manyo (), appeared in the 1930s. Its origins can be traced to Japanese &quot;mandan &quot;(漫談). This genre is characterised by satirical storytelling; hence its songs were also known as &#x27;comic&#x27; songs. Some analyze the genesis and the circulation of this genre in the Japanese colonial era from a socially critical point of view. Whether this music actually had the educational function and had an effect on the catharsis of desire in society remains but open. One of manyo&#x27;s most popular songs was &quot;My Older Brother Is A Busker&quot; (), recorded in 1938 by Park Hyang-lim (). It is noteworthy that a manyo &quot;Pleasant Old Man From The Country&quot; (), recorded in 1936 by Gang Hong-sik (), was an adaption of George W. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Laughing Song&quot; (1895). Later in 1970 &quot;Pleasant Old Man From the Country&quot; was remade as &quot;Seoul Tour&quot; () by comedian Seo Yeong-chun () and became a hit.
In the period of colonial rule, pop culture in Korea was clearly influenced by Japan, and Western culture (primarily from Christian missionaries). Many musicians, such as Yun Sim-deok, Chae Gyu-yeop, and Park Hyang-lim, were educated in Japan or by institutions founded by missionaries. They imitated songs from Japan or hymns and melodies from the West. In the 1920s there were few Korean composers who wrote original popular music. In the 1930s, Korean songwriters began composing original popular songs whose anhemitonic pentatonic scale was typical for trot as well as for enka. Lee Aerisu () recorded &quot;Traces of Castle Ruins&quot; () in 1931(released 1932), later remade under the title &quot;황성 옛터&quot; by many trot singers. This song marked a milestone in trot music. In 1931 the first countrywide competition for the new singers took place, in which Go Bok-su () was chosen and became one of the most prominent trot singers: his debut song, &quot;Away From Home&quot; (, 타향살이) became a hit. In 1933 Okeh records company was founded, which promoted the development of trot and produced a lot of hit songs.
:Hit trot songs in the 1930s:
* &quot;Traces Of Castle Ruins&quot; (황성 옛터, 1932)
* &quot;Living Away From Home&quot; (타향살이, 1934)
* &quot;Tears of Mokpo&quot; (목포의 눈물, 1935)
* &quot;Serenade Of Sorrow&quot; (애수의 소야곡, 1936)
* &quot;Tearful Tumen River&quot; (눈물 젖은 두만강, 1938)
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Hongdo&quot; (홍도야 울지 마라, 1939)
Before 1940, minor and pentatonic scales were predominant in trot. Thereafter the major key was used more often. This did not occur in Japanese enka at the time, hence the development is considered peculiar to trot. The simpler melodies of trot were enriched by it, gradually cheerful rhythms were created in the major key. But in the early 1940s, the country was overshadowed by the Pacific War. 5 years after the liberation from the Japanese colonial rule, the country suffered again under the Korean War in 1950. Nevertheless, several songs have been released during the 1940s (see below list). They are considered to be among the most significant examples, whose rhythms and moods profoundly influenced the development of the genre. So it is hardly possible to speak of trot without these songs.
:Hit trot songs in the 1940s:
* &quot;Traveler&#x27;s Sadness&quot; (나그네 설움, 1940)
* &quot;Wild Rose&quot; (찔레꽃, 1942)

* &quot;Moonlit Night Of Silla&quot; (신라의 달밤, 1949)
* &quot;Rainy Gomoryeong&quot; (비 내리는 고모령, 1949)
===1950s: Diversification and the 8th US Army Clubs===
After Japan&#x27;s colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula and the Korean War, few remnants were left of the music industry since survival remained many people&#x27;s priority. Record companies, most of which were founded in the colonial era, began to struggle. Yet vinyl records were the primary way to distribute music to the population since radios were not easy to purchase in the &#x27;50s; according to estimates, about 350,000 radios were supplied nationwide in 1959. National TV broadcasting began in 1956 and commercial TV broadcasting began in 1959. In 1957 US Army also built a transmitting station &#x27;American Forces Korean Network&#x27; (AFKN). AFKN sometimes reached the largest US broadcaster abroad. In 2012 the previously independent AFKN was grouped under the &#x27;AFN-Pacific Korea&#x27;. It&#x27;s fair to say that AFKN unconsciously played for almost half a century the role of the US culture mediator. Many Koreans who were able to understand English had absorbed the western culture from this channel. Mass media was a way to spread songs, another way was records. Songs were released as singles or, sometimes, as EPs. LP record album production began in 1958.

In the 1950s, two aspects should be emphasized. On the one hand, war and its effects had left its mark on trot music; wartime was reflected in songs. These included: the ode to soldiers that was &quot;A Serenade of the Front Line&quot; (, 1952), stories of separations during the Hungnam evacuation told in &quot;Be Strong Geum-sun&quot; (, 1953), and the joy and sorrow of refugees in &quot;Farewell Busan Station&quot; (, 1953) by Nam In-su (). The country&#x27;s situation was reflected in the lamenting lyrics of &quot;Spring Days Are Passing&quot; () by Baek Seol-hee (), released in 1953. A family of abducted prisoners of war was a subject in &quot;Heartbreaking Miari Hill&quot; (, 1956). This song has been subsequently remade by many trot singers.

On the other hand, some tried to overcome the devastation war brought. Trot music and modern Korean music as a whole was revitalised from the cultural exchange in US Army clubs. These clubs were the linchpin for some entertainers. In 1954, the Eighth United States Army was moved from Japan to Korea, stationed in Seoul Yongsan Garrison. Musicians, promoted by United Service Organizations, visited the 8th US army base to give a morale-boosting concert. The visit of Marilyn Monroe in 1954 was the most sensational; Jane Russell in 1957 and Nat King Cole in 1963 visited. The US army also enjoyed Korean artists. Koreans thereafter called the US Army clubs &#x27;the 8th US Army Stage&#x27; (). There were two types of these stages; one was housed in the garrisons - in addition to Yongsan Garrison, the Camp Market club in Bupyeong District was also very popular. On the other hand, private clubs were opened around the garrisons, the so-called &#x27;military camp town&#x27; (), e.g. in Dongducheon, Paju, Itaewon, where both soldiers and civilians could enter. While working there, the musicians immediately became acquainted with American music culture and trends. They got to know different genres like blues, jazz, swing, tango, contemporary folk and country music, etc. As a result, fundamental changes of song titles, lyrics and rhythms in Korean popular music took place. They later played a leading role as contemporary influences on South Korean music. Important trot composers like Lee Bong-jo (), Kim Hee-gap (), Kim In-bae (), Park Chun-seok (), played instruments or worked as bandmasters in the 8th US army clubs. A lot of the famous rock bands and singers in the 60s and the 70s had their roots there. Some trot singers who started their career there are Choi Hee-jun (), Bae Ho, Han Myeong-suk (), Hyeon Mi, Cho Yong-pil. Female trio singers The Kim Sisters became popular during this time, as their performances drew appeal from American soldiers and audiences, catapulting them to fame when they performed on The Ed Sullivan Show during the 1960s.

But the different genres have actually had little to do with the melodies of trot. They were more of an inspiration to diversify and modernise. Only the name &#x27;blues&#x27; in the titles had been widely used since the 1930s; this came from Japanese examples. It was not intended for the blues genre, but blues&#x27; retarding 4 strokes rhythm caught the songwriter&#x27;s attention so that they called some songs &#x27;xx Blues&#x27;. During this time, songwriters came up with songs by giving newfangled titles in English: e.g. &quot;Shoeshine Boy&quot; (, 1952), &quot;Tango In The Night&quot; (, 1953), &quot;Evening Rain Blues&quot; (, 1956), &quot;Nilliri Mambo&quot; (, 1957), &#x27;&quot;Avec Youth&quot; (, 1957), &quot;Arizona Cowboy&quot; (, 1959), &quot;Daejeon Blues&quot; (, 1959).

===1960s: Enhancements===
The country was slowly recovering from the aftermath of the war, although the political situation remained unstable. This ongoing disorder of society caused the military coup d&#x27;état in 1961. Despite this political turmoil, pop culture continued on its own path. Songwriters and singers who had picked up fresh ideas from US Army clubs and cultural exchange with Westerners incorporated them into trot. Modern sensibilities fused with those traditional to Korea in new songs. Han Myeong-suk released &quot;Yellow Shirt Man&quot; () in 1961, in a swing style. Its success swept across the country, so the singer from a nobody became a star.

A few years later, a new trot singer rose to fame. Lee Mi-ja recorded () in 1964, the title song for the She recorded a lot of hit songs in the 1960s like &quot;Yellow Robe Mast&quot; (, 1964), &quot;Cry Fever&quot; (, 1965), &quot;Heuksando Lady&quot; (, 1967), &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Life&quot; (, 1968), &quot;A Father Goose&quot; (, 1969). Through her numerous hit songs and over two thousand trot songs she has released during her 60-year career, she is the singer of trot par excellence.

Well, the two songs evoke different images of people at the time. The image of the &quot;Yellow Shirt Man&quot; bursting with vitality was portrayed, but &quot;Camellia Lady&quot; was the traditional female figure in Korea who practices patience and fidelity in marriage. Kim In-bae (), at that time a trumpet player in the US Army club, was one of the composers who aimed to update trot music. Therefore, in composing he oriented more on contemporary American pop, which he was familiar with in US Army clubs than the sensibilities and tone of conventional trot. Kim&#x27;s &quot;The Old Familiar Faces&quot; (, 1963) was in a waltz style, whilst Kim&#x27;s &quot;Red Shoes Lady&quot; (, recorded by Nam Il-hae (, 1963) and another renewal-loving composer Son Seok-u&#x27;s () &quot;Yellow Shirt Man&quot; had elements of swing music. The prominent trot composer Park Chun-seok, who had debuted as a pianist in US Army Club, also wrote ballad-style music like &quot;Early Rain&quot; (, 1966) in addition to conventional trot. This song and Choi Sook Ja&#x27;s hit song &quot;Forsythia Girl&quot; ( and Patti Kim&#x27;s hit songs, &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget You&quot; (), &quot;Love Went By Leaving Autumn Behind&quot; (, 1968), &quot;Does Anyone Know This Person?&quot; (), all composed by Park, had semblances of what would become popular &#x27;adult contemporary music&#x27;.

Through these composers and others, trot music became multifaceted, livelier and more spirited. The two following individuals were among the most successful trot singers in the &#x27;60s, known for their distinctive bass-baritone voices. Choi Hee-jun&#x27;s talent was recognised by Son Seok-u, and he debuted with &quot;A Pastoral Song&quot; (, 1961). This song may belong to the genre of contemporary folk music. Other relative hits had less of a conventional trot sound and more of a classic pop sound, despite being in a duple metre like most trot. Examples include &quot;My Lover Is Old Miss&quot; (, 1961), &quot;Barefooted Youth&quot; (, 1964), &quot;Student Boarder&quot; (, 1965), &quot;Palto-Gangsan&quot; (, 1967).

Bae Ho (), then a drummer in Camp Market club, recorded his debut song &quot;Arrow Of Love&quot; (, 1963) with tango rhythm. His early death at age 29 by nephritis and his songs made him a trot legend. In 1967, he released two significant songs &quot;Return to Samgakji&quot; () and &quot;Foggy Jangchungdan Park&quot; (). The deeply vibrating soft voice was his trademark. After his death in 1971, many tried to imitate his singing style. It was suspected that several fake LPs, released under the name Bae Ho, should have been in circulation. Bae Ho and Nam In-su were the singers whose voice was often forged. By analyzing his voice, a few of his LPs were identified as counterfeit. Mean opinion score test with two mentioned songs has shown that Bae&#x27;s voice moves between 100 and 300 Hz while singing. This is the frequency of a male average voice in a normal conversation. So it was explainable that his voice sounded so gentle while singing.

In the 1960s, the government intervened in popular culture and banished such songs that it considered &#x27;Japanese-tinged&#x27; or &#x27;unsound&#x27; while promoting the &#x27;sound&#x27; songs. Of course, composers still wrote sentimental songs, but even happy songs were increasingly popular. Kim Sang-hee () was one of the singers who mostly sang &#x27;happy songs&#x27;. Examples of the &#x27;happy songs&#x27; in the second half of the 1960s are: &quot;Southern Village Over The Mountain&quot; (, 1965), &quot;Beanpole Mr. Kim&quot; (, 1966), &quot;Baldy Man&quot; (, 1967), &quot;Honey!&quot; (, 1968), &quot;Song Of Seoul&quot; (, 1969), &quot;Sergeant Kim From Vietnam&quot; (, 1969), &quot;Seosan Seaside Village&quot; (, 1969). This included the traditional folk song. Kim Serena () was the star for Sin-minyo (i.e. new Korean folk song). It almost seemed like she was a trot singer, but that was a unique phenomenon. Her hit songs: &quot;Gapdori and Gapsuni&quot; (, 1966), &quot;Sae-Taryeong&quot; (, 1967), &quot;Seongju-Puli&quot; (, 1969). The popularity of Sin-minyo lasted until the first half of the 1970s. During this time Kim Serena, Choi Jeong-ja, Kim Bu-ja and Ha Chun-hwa made Sin-minyo still popular.

The young generation, born after the liberation of the Korean peninsula, now appeared on the trot stage and later became leading trot singers in the 1970s. Nam Jin () made his debut at the age of 20 with &quot;Seoul Playboy&quot; (, 1965), Na Hun-a () at the age of 17 with &quot;Long Journey&quot; (, 1966), Moon Joo-ran () at the age of 16 with &quot;Song Of Dongsuk&quot; (, 1966), Ha Chun-hwa as a child performer (6 years old) with &quot;Filial Daughter Simcheong&quot; (, 1961). These singers have since released many songs of Park Chun-seok, and earned the nickname &#x27;Park&#x27;s troop&#x27;. In this decade, several composers also made their name known, among others Lee Bong-jo, Gil Ok-yun, Shin Jung-hyeon, Jeong Min-seop, all later composed a significant number of works.

===1970s: Heyday===

South Korea became industrialised in the 1970s. As economic growth began, ordinary people became more and more interested in cultural life. Mass media such as radio and TV made trot widespread across the country - the household ownership of televisions rose rapidly from 6.4% in 1971 to 83.1% in 1980, so the pop artists gained more space to present themselves to the public. That&#x27;s one factor in the rise of trot music in the 70s. The other was the young generation born around the time of liberation in 1945. Even though they debuted in the 60s they have since become trot icons.

Since 1966, Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation has hosted a popular variety show entitled &#x27;MBC Ten Singers Match&#x27;; 5 singers each female and male are running in the team competition, and at the end of the show one of them will be chosen the best singer. The program was broadcast on the radio until 1968, then on television. It was renamed &#x27;MBC Song Festival&#x27; in 2005 and is still held today at the end of the year. Whether the choice of some singers was always fair, is another matter. In the 70s, mainly trot singers appeared in the show, but in the 80s, some ballad singers attended partially, and not until the 90s belonged trot singers to the minority of participants. This can be meaningful evidence that showed the popularity of trot in the 70s. A research sums up 59 songs that were presented in a weekly music program on TV as well as in the aforementioned festival in the 70s, also shows the same result. But trot was no longer the only popular music genre in the 70s. With the proliferation of mass media, contemporary folk music from the United States slowly found its audience as well as performers, who led since the 80s one of the mainstreams of popular music in South Korea.

From the late 1960s to the mid-&#x27;70s, two singers took trot&#x27;s stage: Nam Jin and Na Hun-a. They were indeed the first pop idols in South Korea. The rivalry of both was so awesome that predominantly female fans were formed on two fronts. Nam Jin was the first to hold his own concert in 1971 in Korean popular music history, which was then called &#x27;recital&#x27; - actually a term for classical music rather than popular music. From the 80s, while Nam Jin could barely release hit songs like before, Na Hun-a released hit songs up to the 2000s, and his fans can still look forward to his sold-out concert in 2019. The two have very different vocal styles. Nam Jin often sang in a lilting mood. Some of his hit songs are rhythmically &#x27;unorthodox&#x27; for trot, e.g. &quot;Darling, Please Don&#x27;t Change&quot; sounds like mimetic rock and roll. Na Hun-a, on the other hand, sang throughout in &#x27;orthodox&#x27; style for trot, often using the extended vibrato with wonderful Kkeokk-ki technique. Na&#x27;s big advantage, of course, was that he was one of the few trot singers-songwriters to write songs exactly according to his style. Their representative hit songs in the &#x27;60s–&#x27;70s are:

* &quot;Rusted Railroad&quot; (녹슬은 기차길, 1976)

In the second half of the 1970s, some singers appeared who were not trot familiar, but just with trot songs were popular. Among them, Kim Hun was successful with &quot;Leaving Me Behind, Arirang&quot; (, 1975), Cho Yong-pil with &quot;Come Back To Busan Harbor&quot; (, 1975), Choi Heon with &quot;Leaves Of Paulownia&quot; (, 1976), Song Dae-gwan with &quot;Suddenly, Sunny Day Comes&quot; (, 1976), Yun Su-il with &quot;But Never Want To Love&quot; (, 1977) and others. Most of them had previously engaged in a rock band - at that time, such band was called &#x27;group sounds&#x27;, based on the Japanese model. Some critics sometimes refer to the music of these artists as &#x27;Trot-go-go&#x27; or &#x27;rocker&#x27;s Ppong&#x27;. Called &#x27;Trot-go-go&#x27; because go-go had primarily been introduced and popularized as dance music in the 1970s in Korea, and at the same time, many so-called Go-go night dance clubs opened in Seoul, where the above-mentioned singers with their group sounds worked. Called &#x27;rocker&#x27;s Ppong&#x27; because group sounds as a rock band funnily enough performed Ppongjjak. After all, Trot-go-go has contributed to the enrichment of trot by combining style, which is based on the traditional duple or quadruple metre scheme, with the syncopation elements of dance music.

Cho Yong-pil&#x27;s &quot;Come Back To Busan Harbor&quot; was noteworthy in that it suddenly made him a star from a hitherto unknown musician. The popularity of this song could be explained by the political context because the visit of the living in Japan Koreans who belonged to the pro North Korea association &#x27;Jochongnyeon&#x27;, just in 1975 was allowed: the brothers returned from abroad back to Busan - that&#x27;s what the song screamed! In fact, the song itself became so popular later to make the Japanese enka singers aware of this song - several cover versions of enka singers are on YouTube. Meanwhile, after the success of this song, Cho did not seriously himself concern with trot music but instead turned to his actual musical domain alternative rock and pop ballads. Cho soon got into difficulty. In 1975, a &#x27;marijuana scandal&#x27; occurred; 18 popular artists - mostly singers from group sounds including Cho and Shin Jung-hyeon - were rebuked for cannabis consumption and banished from public and private broadcastings several years.

===1980s: Challenges===
The growing economic growth of South Korea has become noticeable everywhere in the 1980s. The young generation, called baby boomers in South Korea as well as in other countries, was coming of age. The Baby boomer cohort, born between 1955 and 1963, is the largest population in South Korea. Accordingly, the number of students in colleges up to 1990 has increased dramatically more than seven times since 1970. The increased number of students boosted on the one hand the formation of student subculture, on the other hand, the young generation faced the cultural cleavage between the desire for change and the conservative establishment and tried to adapt to the changing times. Popular music has also undergone this change and took up the challenge. Beginning at the end of the 70s, the young artists tried contemporary folk songs and pop ballads and rock genres based on the taste of the Koreans. Music halls and nightclubs offered singers with the acoustic guitar as well as group sounds to perform their works. Precisely by their subculture, even in outward appearances such as acoustic guitar, long hair, jeans, and the like, they could feel differentiated from the elder generation. It existed to provide newcomers the opportunity to meet and present their work. Two prestigious song festivals were hosted by MBC TV annually in the late 1970s, which now are not held anymore: &#x27;College Song Festival&#x27; (1977-2012) and &#x27;Riverside Song Festival&#x27; (1979-2001). In the 60s and 70s, the US Army clubs were the springboard from which many artists stepped forward. In the 80s, the song festivals assumed such a role. Well, trot had a hard time with this uplifting music of the baby boomers. 

Trot was able to hold its own still in the 80s. The popularity of cassettes proved very important for the genre and helped bring about the localization of trot music. It also helped in the invention of the sound of trot medley, which is now emblematic of contemporary Korean trot music. In 1984, a medley album &quot;Couples-only Party&quot; (), consisting of 21 well-known trot songs was released. It was a compilation of separated recorded songs of a female and a male singer in alternating, but not in duet, and their voice was enhanced by the acoustic echo. After the extraordinary success of the first album, they recorded 4 more &quot;Couples-only Party&quot; cassette albums next year also with success. The five &quot;Couples-only Party&quot; albums contain a total of 110 trot songs. As a result, many musicians flooded the music business with about 50 albums titled &#x27;Couples-only&#x27;. A few years later, another female singer Mun Hee-ok () succeeded also with a trot medley album &quot;Disco Medley In Eight Dialects&quot; (, 1987). Anyway, the female singer Joo Hyun-mi was discovered - the male partner Kim Jun-gyu () was actually not a professional singer, but a composer and producer. Previously, Joo Hyun-mi had participated as a vocalist of a student band at the &#x27;Riverside Song Festival&#x27; (1981) and won the participation prize. The success of &quot;Couples-only Party&quot; made her debut with her own song &quot;Rainy Yeongdong Bridge&quot; () in 1985. This debut song brought her as trot singer countrywide fame, Joo released four albums in 1985 as well as 1986 with moderate success. The 9th album &quot;Sinsa-dong And The Man&quot; () in 1988 earned her &#x27;Song of the Year Award&#x27; of KBS and MBC, the most important awards at that time in South Korea. Her singing style of this song differed from the conventional trot in that the tempo was rhythmically fast in diatonic scale: this may be influenced by the medley style. Critics call it a semi-trot. The lyrics of her songs like &quot;Sinsa-dong And The Man&quot;, &quot;Tears Blues&quot; (, 1986), &quot;Unrequited Love&quot; (, 1989), evoked a certain milieu of hostess clubs. A famous entertainment district in Seoul was Sinsa-dong, which was usually called &#x27;Yeongdong&#x27; in the 1980s and today &#x27;Gangnam District&#x27; in great order. It may have helped to call trot &#x27;Seongin-gayo&#x27;, literally adult music.

In the 80s, also two female singers, Kim Soo-hee and Sim Soo-bong enlivened the sinking popularity of trot music. The two began their music career in the US Army club: Kim sang as a vocalist of a band &#x27;Black Cats&#x27; and Sim worked as a drummer of a band &#x27;Nonstop&#x27;. They are both singers and songwriters. Sim Soo-bong debuted in &#x27;College Song Festival&#x27; in 1978 with &quot;The Man Back Then&quot; (). It was very rare for a singer to participate in the college festival with a trot song. Although she got no prize, the song became a big hit the next year. Like the success of &quot;Come Back To Busan Harbor&quot;, so also the hit peaking of &quot;The Man Back Then&quot; probably has to do with the political incident back then. The song as well as its singer drew special attention to themselves because Sim was present at the assassination of President Park in 1979. But she herself suffered from the psychic trauma. Her next hit song was &quot;Men are Ships, Women are Harbors&quot; (, 1984). Otherwise, she brought little hit songs.

Kim Soo-hee&#x27;s career began in 1976 when she recorded her first album &quot;Too Much&quot; (). After the unsuccessful debut song, she appeared as a vocalist for a band in the US Army club. &quot;A Yoke&quot; (, 1983), &quot;A Southbound Train&quot; (, 1987) and &quot;Sad Love&quot; (, 1991) were breakthroughs in her career. &quot;A Yoke&quot; garnered above all sympathetic acceptance from those women who engaged in bars and clubs because its lyric reflected images of their quotidian hardships and solace. The imagery of this song was similar to that in Joo Hyun-mi&#x27;s songs &quot;Rainy Yeongdong Bridge&quot; and &quot;Sinsa-dong And The Man&quot;. &quot;A Southbound Train&quot; was popular at the time especially as a fight song of the professional baseball team then Haitai Tigers, comparable to &quot;Busan Seagulls&quot; (, 1982) of Lotte Giants - the trot song &quot;Busan Seagulls&quot; was a one-hit wonder by Moon Seong-jae (). In addition, Kim Soo-hee considered &quot;Sad Love&quot; her favorite song.

In 1985, a trot music program &#x27;Golden Oldies&#x27; (), literally means &#x27;music stage&#x27;, launched by KBS TV. It accomplished a steady rapprochement to trot&#x27;s listeners till this day.

===1990s: Decline in popularity===
In the late 1990s, Epaksa made an extravagant attempt, calling his music &#x27;techno-trot&#x27;, a mixture of rapping, techno and dance.

1993 was a time pop music in its heyday with famous Seo Taiji and Boys. At that time, there was a unique event, &quot;The World Is a Wonderful World&quot;, a trot song sung by expressionless Shin Shin-ae while dancing the so-called &quot;Lee Pan-sa-pan&quot;, gained popularity and create Shin Shin-ae craze. It peaked into 3rd and 4th rank in South Korean Music Chart.

&quot;The World Is a Wonderful World&quot;, sung by Shin Shin-ae, is a mixture of two songs released in the 1930s. Basically, the lyrics of &quot;The World Is a Wonderful World&quot; sung by Kim Jung-gu in 1939, but the lyrics of &quot;Anchhwa Storm&quot; sung by Kim Jung-gu in 1938 have also been partially modified. In the second verse of &quot;Anchhwa Storm&quot;, &quot;The old man&#x27;s topknot twisted and his wife&#x27;s shoes ran away,&quot; was transformed into &quot;The old man&#x27;s topknot twisted and the old woman&#x27;s shoes ran away.&quot;

===2000s–2010s: Revival===

Male singers include Lim Young-woong (), Young Tak (), Lee Chan-won(), (), Jeong Dong-won(), Shin Yu(), Chun Jae-won(), Jang Minho(), and Kim Hee-jae().

===Contemporary political use of trot music===
An article published in the &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot; in 2010 reported the government&#x27;s use of trot music as a propaganda tool against North Korea. Over 184 songs from artists such as Na Hun-a, Jang Yoon-jeong and Park Hyun-bin, were broadcast through FM radio programs targeting North Korean soldiers.

=== 2020s: Resurgent ===
In recent years, trot, a genre traditionally associated with older generations in Korea, has experienced a significant resurgence, gaining widespread popularity among younger audiences and evolving within the broader music industry. The TV Chosun show Mr. Trot has played a key role in revitalizing trot and introducing it to younger audiences. Stars like Lim Young-woong, who surpassed 10 billion streams on Melon and won two grand prizes at the 2022 Melon Music Awards, have helped bring the genre into the mainstream. Major K-pop companies, like SM Entertainment, are now blending trot with K-pop, as seen in the debut of groups like Mytro, aiming to appeal to both domestic and international audiences.

<doc id="1218815" wikidata="Q295358" url="?curid=1218815" title="Panhard AML">
<text>The Panhard AML (&quot;automitrailleuse légère&quot;, or &quot;light armoured car&quot;) is an armoured car with reconnaissance capability. Designed by Panhard on a lightly armoured 4×4 chassis, it weighs an estimated 5.5 tonnes, and is thus suitable for airborne deployment. Since 1959, AMLs have been marketed on up to five continents; several variants remained in continuous production for half a century. These have been operated by fifty-four national governments and other entities worldwide, seeing regular combat.

The AML-245 was once regarded as one of the most heavily armed scout vehicles in service, fitted with a low velocity DEFA D921 90 mm (3.54 in) rifled cannon firing conventional high explosive and high explosive anti-tank shells, or a 60 mm (2.36 in) breech loading mortar with 53 rounds and dual 7.5mm MAS AA-52 NF-1 machine guns with 3,800 rounds, all mounted coaxially in the turret. An AML is capable of destroying targets at 1,500 meters with its D921 main gun. In this configuration it is considered a match for second-line and older main battle tanks.

AMLs have appeared most prominently in Angola, Iraq, and Chad, as well as in the Lebanese Civil War between 1975 and 1990.

==History==
During World War II, the French Army and their Free French successors used a wide variety of vehicles for reconnaissance duties, ranging from the compact &quot;Laffly S15&quot; to the &quot;Panhard 178&quot;, which could mount the same 75 mm armament as contemporary heavy tanks, and multi-wheeled designs such as the &quot;Type 201&quot;. After the war it became less desirable to maintain this plethora of armoured cars. In July 1945 Paris issued a requirement for a postwar design combining those features of previous assets – especially the Type 201 – that had shown potential both during and prior to the Battle of France. This led to the 8x8 Panhard EBR (&quot;Type 212&quot;) which entered service in 1950. Similarly, in 1956 the French Ministry of Defense was persuaded to commission a replacement for the Daimler Ferret scout car. Also manufactured by Panhard, the successor was the AML (&quot;Type 245&quot;) which entered service in 1961.

As with much postwar hardware based on the experience of subsequent colonial theatres, the AML was recognized for its outstanding ruggedness, dependability, firepower-to-weight ratio, and adaptability to the numerous minor conflicts waged since 1945. This reputation has led to export success in over forty countries, Africa being one of its biggest markets.

===Development===
The Panhard AML was birthed as a private venture by the &quot;Société de Constructions Panhard et Levassor&quot;, a military subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroën. It was derived in part from the Daimler Ferret, offering important similarities in external design. The first prototype appeared in 1959 and the vehicle was put into production in 1960, with more than 4,000 examples constructed by the time production ended.

In the late 1950s, the French Army successfully operated a number of Ferret scout cars in Algeria. Impressive as they were from a conventional standpoint, the rest of France&#x27;s existing light armour—such as the Panhard EBR and M8 Greyhound—were not suitably equipped for counter-insurgency; battles of the Algerian War often involved short, sharp, skirmishes which required indirect fire support weapons such as mortars rather than solid shot and shell. In addition, the North African conditions demanded a lighter, less sophisticated, vehicle which would be simpler to maintain and operate. As an interim measure France had purchased two hundred Ferrets from the United Kingdom. These were light enough but carried only a single general-purpose machine gun, which was inadequate for offensive purposes. Nevertheless, they were sufficiently successful that there was a possibility of producing the Ferret under licence in France. However, Saviem, Berliet, and Panhard petitioned for bidding on a home-grown vehicle, and in 1956 the Ministère de la Défense issued specifications for an indigenous wheeled armoured car of similar dimensions and layout to the Ferret but mounting a breech-loading mortar. By 1959, this had emerged as the &quot;Auto Mitrailleuse Légère&quot;, designated Model 245 &quot;B&quot; by Panhard. Early prototypes were completed in mid-1959 and by the end of 1961 at least one regiment in Algeria was receiving them. The AML was equipped with a 60mm Brandt gun-mortar and two medium MAS AA-52 NF-1 machine guns. Until Panhard&#x27;s acquisition by Citroën later in the 1960s, it was manufactured at a single plant near the Porte de Choisy in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.

The AML was immediately successful, but as the Algerian conflict diminished so did the need for a light mortar carrier deployed in anti-guerrilla operations. A more primary concern was the conventional threat posed by Soviet airborne armoured vehicles such as the ASU-85 in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion by air, which was then a major concern of French military strategists. Meanwhile, South Africa, an AML customer which had considered adopting the British Alvis Saladin, also charged Panhard technicians to look into the development of an AML variant with equal or superior fire support capability. This and the adoption of a highly effective 90 mm rifled cannon led to all new AML-245 &quot;C&quot;s being refitted with the H-90 turret sporting the new gun. It fired fin-stabilised, shaped charge, projectiles boasting a muzzle velocity of 760 m/s and more than capable of penetrating 320 mm of rolled homogeneous armour. In consequence, the later AMLs could even engage main battle tanks. In addition to its high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shells the H-90 also carries fin-stabilised high-explosive (HE) projectiles, the total number of rounds stored being 20, compared with the 53 of the original 60 mm mortar version.

To provide a complete family of wheeled armoured cars, Panhard used AML components to engineer a small personnel carrier, the &quot;Véhicule Transport de Troupes&quot;, better known as the Panhard M3. The M3 consisted of a boxy, all-welded, hull with an engine relocated behind the driver in order to provide a large troop compartment at its rear. Its wheelbase was also increased from the AML&#x27;s 2.5m to a higher 2.7m. and the track from 1.62 to 2.5m. In spite of this, maintenance alongside the AML fleet is rather simplified, given that both vehicles share a 95% interchangeability in automotive parts. The export success of the AML and M3 led directly to the development of the Panhard ERC 90 Sagaie and Panhard VCR, respectively, which were six-wheeled and could carry a wider range of heavy weapon systems.

Mass production of the AML likely ceased at some point prior to the early 1980s. However, AMLs continued to be sold from French Army surplus stocks as late as 1999, when the final export orders were placed by Yemen and Tunisia. They were also marketed by a number of other second-hand suppliers, including South Africa, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.

===Specifications===
Fitted with coil spring suspension and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, the steering wheel requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion—while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, eliminating the need for a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver&#x27;s seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the gearbox output shaft.

An AML&#x27;s crankshaft is carried in three ball bearings to reduce motor friction. Powerplant design was inspired by the Panhard EBR and incorporates an air-cooled 1.99 litre four cylinder engine developing 67 kW (90 hp). The Panhard engine was somewhat underpowered for the five to six tonne armoured car, and remained prone to mechanical failure in humid climates. Under temperate conditions it was capable of providing good operational service up to 26,000 kilometres before needing replacement. AMLs may also be fitted with a variety of liquid-cooled engines, although as demonstrated by its Eland Mk7 counterpart this requires a costly reconstruction of the rear hull to accommodate the new cooling apparatus.

AML hulls are assembled from only 13 welded pieces, with a driver seated at the front of the hull and the turret to his immediate rear. Above both doors the hull widens into a circular flange onto which the turret is bolted. This makes the turret basket extremely cramped, and little space is available above an AML-90&#x27;s turret ring due to the massive gun breech and somewhat haphazard ammunition stowage. There are optical ring sights in front of both turret seats for quick laying of the main armament. AML turrets have a two-man crew, with the commander seated on the left and the gunner on the right. Depending on the variant, either may operate the roof-mounted searchlight. Seven periscopes are provided for the turret crew and three for the AML&#x27;s driver. One of the three driving periscopes may be substituted with an infrared or image intensification periscope for night operations.

On either side of the hull below the turret ring is an access door, one for the driver on the right and one intended for emergency purposes on the left. The left hull door, on which a spare wheel and tyre or fuel cans may be mounted, opens to the rear while the right hull door opens to the front. The engine housing at the rear of the hull is accessed through two access panels, and is insulated from the crew compartment by a removable bulkhead. Two sand channels resembling those on the Ferret are bolted to the hull front for crossing ditches and other obstacles.

The AML uses nitrogen inner tubes (in this case Hutchinson V.P.-P.V.s) adopted from the EBR, providing run flat capability on 41 cm (16 in.)-diameter wheels; its 280 mm (11 in.) wide Michelin tyres can be deflated to reduce ground pressure to as low as . These have been replaced in some Anglophone armies by the Dunlop Trak Grips also favoured in Bedford and Alvis military vehicles.

==Service history==
===Europe===
====France====
French military doctrine recognised two separate fields of armoured vehicle deployment, the first consisting of primary tasks such as manoeuvre and combat, while the second included other tasks such as rearguard defence, liaison, and deception. The latter was to be the responsibility of a mobile reserve which provided interior security during wartime – designated &quot;Défense Opérationnelle du Territoire&quot; (DOT) armoured cavalry regiments. Initially equipped with AMLs and jeeps modified for scouting purposes, these units worked closely with the French police and National Gendarmerie. Their goal was to intercept hostile special forces or airborne units which specialised in deep penetration behind the front line. Secondary tasks included counter-insurgency, passive observation, and guarding static installations.

Each DOT troop came to include three AML platoons. As they were expected to remain faithful to the traditional mission of reconnaissance where observation had priority over combat, a number of the AML-60s seem to have been stripped of their main armament, necessitating crew dependence on the vehicle&#x27;s secondary automatic weapons. Nevertheless, to counter the mechanised threat posed by Soviet and other Warsaw Pact airborne forces, which often deployed with their own armour such as the ASU-57, BMD-1, and ASU-85, AML-90s were favoured as well. DOT regiments came to hold a generic pool of sixteen AML-90s and thirty-four other AMLs of varying configuration.

As the AML was readily air transportable, it came to form the materiel strongpoint of the French Foreign Legion&#x27;s rapid deployment force. The Legion AMLs saw combat overseas, either as part of single deployments by the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment or to provide fire support for other Legion regiments. Crews perfected unique airfield assaults in which AML-90s were unloaded directly from Transall C-160s onto the objective, with infantry joining them by parachute. They could also deploy from Breguet 941 and Nord Noratlas aircraft. These vehicles first saw combat against BTR-152s manned by FROLINAT rebels in Chad during Opération Tacaud, successfully engaging an insurgent mechanised column approaching Salal around April 1978. On 18 May another sixteen AMLs, supported by a company of French infantry, routed FROLINAT elements advancing on Ati. In the subsequent months, additional AML-90s rushed in by the Régiment d&#x27;infanterie-chars de marine (RICM) repelled a major offensive near Abéché by the Chadian Democratic Revolutionary Council, which was backed by fifty Libyan T-55 tanks and EE-9 Cascavel armoured cars.

Despite the intensity of these clashes, only three French AMLs were lost in Chad between 1978 and 1979, most likely to RPG-7s. The Foreign Legion&#x27;s AML squadrons continued to see action during Operation Manta and the extended Opération Épervier, being organised into anti-tank support groups for three battalion-sized task forces. Their speed and mobility proved instrumental in destroying much heavier Libyan main battle tanks. However, the French crews could only make up for their inferiority in firepower by outflanking the tanks first or attacking from the rear, and by the mid 1980s the threat posed by large Libyan armoured formations was considered so severe a squadron of AMX-10RCs had to be deployed as well.

A single RICM AML platoon was deployed to assist in the 1979 overthrow of the Central African Empire during Operation Caban, likely shifted from Marine contingents stationed in Chad or Gabon. The armoured cars were landed at the airport in concert with French paratroopers during a textbook airborne assault; however, the defending Central African troops surrendered without offering resistance. AMLs did not see action again until Operation Épaulard I, when twenty AML-60s and AML-90s were deployed for infantry support purposes. As the French infantrymen lacked heavy weapons of their own, they remained dependent on the AMLs for suppressing hard targets; this persuaded the French Army of the need for infantry fighting vehicles in overseas operations. The AML-90s were later used by the RICM against the Rwandan Patriotic Front during the Rwandan Civil War.

The Mobile Gendarmerie operated over a hundred AML-60s and AML-90s, which were allocated to nineteen separate squadrons. The AML was superseded in service with the Mobile Gendarmerie by the VBC-90 at the end of the 1980s.

The last AMLs were withdrawn from active service in the French Army in 1991, being superseded by the Panhard ERC and the AMX-10RC. France retained about three hundred of these AMLs in storage as part of its strategic reserve as late as 1995. A small number were also used to simulate OPFOR armoured vehicles at the Centre d&#x27;entraînement aux actions en zone urbaine (CENZUB) until 2012, when they were finally decommissioned.

====Portugal====
Franco-Portuguese military relations experienced a significant improvement during the 1960s, with the establishment of a French strategic missile tracking site on Flores Island in the Azores. The Portuguese government was compensated with French arms, which it acquired under especially generous terms. Following the outbreak of the Portuguese Colonial War, Lisbon began ordering AML-60s for deployment to its three African territories: Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. The armoured cars were purchased on long-term credit, with the French government granting payment facilities ranging from ten to twenty years, at six per cent annual interest. About 50 AML-60s were delivered to the Portuguese Army between 1965 and 1968 to complement the ageing EBR already in service. They were circulated largely among reconnaissance platoons in Africa, which utilised them for convoy escort purposes. Severe maintenance problems were soon encountered in the corrosive tropical environment, compounded by excessive dust, which caused transmission and engine damage. Most AMLs stalled during their initial convoy support missions and had to be towed behind other vehicles. These issues were later rectified by the installation of custom Volkswagen air intakes. Around the early 1970s, all Portuguese AML-60s in Angola were retrofitted with liquid-cooled, four-cylinder General Motors engines and pressure plate clutches, giving them a resemblance to the Eland Mk7. The new engines were adopted because they were cheaper to replace and Portugal found it easier to source their associated parts.

In 1974, a squadron of AML-60s seconded to the Portuguese Army&#x27;s School of Cavalry at Santarém took part in the Carnation Revolution, which heralded the collapse of the country&#x27;s ruling &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime and its colonial empire. The following year, when Portugal withdrew from Angola under the terms of the Alvor Agreement, 5 AML-60s were abandoned in that country and subsequently taken into service by Angolan factions. About 36 of the remaining AMLs were redistributed to the &quot;Regimento de Cavalaria N.º 3&quot; (3rd Cavalry Regiment) and &quot;Regimento de Cavalaria N.º 6&quot; (6th Cavalry Regiment), while the others were held in reserve.

The Portuguese government entered into negotiations with a local subsidiary of Opel in 1982 to upgrade its entire AML fleet with liquid-cooled engines and pressure plate clutches, exempting those which had already received similar modifications during their service in Angola. Opel upgraded one AML for evaluation purposes before the programme was abandoned. Another, more successful, project entailed the addition of Portuguese PRC-239 wireless radio sets and communications equipment. The AML-60s were retired from 1989 onwards and replaced by the Véhicule Blindé Léger.

===Middle East===

====Israel====
An order of 29 AML-90s placed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1960 marked the first sale of AMLs to a foreign power, ushered in a new era of French arms sales to Jerusalem, and helped cement Panhard&#x27;s success on the export market. The IDF armoured cars had been received by the end of 1963 and were first displayed publicly on the eve of Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut, 1966. Israeli units were primarily impressed by their high mobility and ergonomic nature, which was deemed ideal for airborne operations. Nevertheless, the AML-90&#x27;s envisaged deployment by new Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelons also purchased from France did not materialise, as the helicopters could not handle its 5,500 kg combat weight.

At least 9 AML-90s were in service with the 41st Reconnaissance Company of the Harel Brigade during the Six-Day War under a Major Amnon Eshkol, participating in the capture of Ramallah in June 1967. The AMLs were initially posted at Mevaseret Zion following the fall of East Jerusalem. They were among the first IDF armour to cross into the West Bank during the conflict, probing for Jordanian resistance. Major roads had been blocked by tank barriers although these could be easily bypassed in nimbler armoured cars. The much more cumbersome Super Sherman and Centurion tanks tasked with leading the IDF&#x27;s spearhead towards Tell el-Ful failed to reach their objective; most were forced to turn back in the face of difficult terrain. Joined by the surviving seven Shermans and eight M3 half-tracks, Major Eshkol&#x27;s AML-90s later helped defeat a Jordanian counterattack with M48 Pattons.

In the War of Attrition, Israeli AMLs faced Jordanian M48s again on the Damia Bridge during the Battle of Karameh. Originally tasked with screening the IDF Centurions as they crossed the bridge, the lightly armoured AML-90 was at a unique disadvantage when confronted by entrenched Pattons. Moreover, the Jordan River was in flood and vehicle crews were unable to exploit their manoeuvrability in the muddy farmland. Several AMLs were knocked out by tank fire or towed anti-tank guns. They were withdrawn from service not long afterwards.

The Arab–Israeli conflict marked some of the highest armour-to-armour kill ratios achieved with the AML platform to date, including the destruction of at least 13 Egyptian and Jordanian tanks. Especially notable were several T-54 kills credited to an AML-90 platoon in the Sinai Peninsula: as late as the 1980s, military scholars continued to maintain that the 90 mm DEFA cannon lacked the muzzle velocity to penetrate the thick steel hull of a T-54/55. More well-documented cases have since verified this was possible, though only with multiple shots or a direct hit on the turret rim near the driver&#x27;s hatch. Israeli AML crews also sustained losses of their own during this engagement, and some AML-90s may have been captured intact by the Egyptian defenders.

====Saudi Arabia====
In 1964, the Royal Saudi Army issued a requirement for an armoured car proven in desert warfare and equipped with a large semi-automatic cannon. Bids were accepted from three companies—Alvis, Cadillac Gage, and Panhard—which offered the Saladin, V-100 Commando, and AML, respectively, but the debate over which of the three to adopt was hamstrung by political considerations early on. Saudi Arabia remained inhibited from seeking American assistance in devising suitable defence programmes by the criticism and hostility of other Arab states. Under these circumstances, only arms transactions with French or British firms could be entertained. Despite longstanding diplomatic contacts, the French presence in Riyadh was rather limited compared to that of the United Kingdom, and the latter was in a better position to provide long-term logistical support for armoured cars to the Saudi military. Alvis was initially awarded a contract for 83 Saladins with a ten-year option on spare parts. Final negotiations for the delivery of the Saladins were underway when Sultan bin Abdulaziz abruptly cancelled the purchase in favour of Panhard.

The $95 million Panhard deal proved instrumental in breaking existing preconceptions that the Arabian arms market was well protected by the UK. Gaullist circles heralded it as a major business and political success. In an interview in Beirut, Sultan bin Abdulaziz merely asserted that AMLs were selected as part of King Faisal&#x27;s policy to strengthen the army with a greater infusion of modern arms. Saudi Army officials had preferred the heavier Saladin and appreciated its worthiness in desert conditions, but conceded the AML-90 was much cheaper. Panhard undertook the order amid much protest by pro-Israel lobbyists in France, who urged restraint in shipping arms to Arab bloc states likely to use them against Tel-Aviv. The sale was also challenged as a violation of Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Middle Eastern embargo, although the French government insisted it did not classify armoured scout cars as the same &quot;heavy war materiel&quot; covered by sanctions.

Saudi AML-90s of the 20th Armoured Brigade were blooded near Daraa during the Yom Kippur War, having been airlifted to assist its Syrian defenders in Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft loaned from Iran. The airlift was carried out on October 14, 1973; six Iranian C-130s were needed to convey the vehicles and about 2,000 motorised infantrymen from Saudi Arabia to Syria. AML crews were generally assigned to static guard duty, patrolling the Damascus-Daraa road and keeping lines of communications clear between the multinational Arab forces. At least one AML-90 was captured by the Golani Brigade, likely while attempting to reconnoiter an IDF position after dark. The captured vehicle was later displayed by Israeli officials to the international press as proof of direct Saudi military involvement in the Syrian war effort.

On October 16, the 7th Brigade, 71st Tank Battalion of the IDF&#x27;s 36th Armoured Division reported clashing with the Saudi armoured cars as they performed reconnaissance for Iraqi forces near Tel Antar. The Saudis quickly disengaged. At some point between this skirmish and the evening of October 17, all the Saudi AMLs—almost a composite light armoured battalion—launched an unsuccessful attack on IDF positions at the village of Tel Merai. Thereafter the remaining armoured cars and their crews were integrated with the Jordanian 40th Armoured Brigade. On October 19, they participated in a joint offensive with that unit but were halted by accurate tank fire from the IDF&#x27;s 17th Reserve Armour Brigade and forced to retreat.

The Israelis claimed to have destroyed most of the Saudi AMLs at Tel Merai. Saudi accounts acknowledge the loss of only 4 AMLs; furthermore, the Saudis claimed to have knocked out 5 Israeli tanks and damaged 5 more.

Saudi Arabia ordered between 200 and 220 AMLs from France in 1968, with deliveries completed by 1970. Some sources have claimed a second order was placed in 1978 for another 250. The Saudi Army has since retired much of its Panhard fleet and exported surplus stocks to various nations. During the Gulf War, an estimated 200 AML-90s were phased from service. Upon learning that the Senegalese units participating in Operation Desert Shield were also familiar with the Panhard type, General Khalid bin Sultan ordered a number retained for their use. The armoured cars were hurriedly serviced, then donated to Senegal. Large quantities were also accepted by Morocco and Niger.

====Lebanon====
At least 74 AML-90s were delivered to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) between 1970 and 1975, and saw considerable action in the Lebanese Civil War. As their crews often left them unguarded outside army compounds, several may have been stolen by LAF deserters on their way to join regional militias. Others vanished during the disintegration of individual battalions, and by 1981 Lebanon&#x27;s fleet had dwindled to 52. The surviving AML squadrons remained plagued by chronic shortages of personnel; some crews even fought in their turrets without a trained commander and depended on inexperienced spotters outside the vehicles to guide their fire. This resulted in phenomenal inaccuracy.

Following the Battle of the Hotels, Lebanese Front troops in the Port District of Beirut brought their Panhards into action for the first time in the civil war, engaging Charioteer tanks crewed by Amal and Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) militants. Having lost nearly all their heavy armour and tanks to the militias, the predominantly Christian remnants of the Lebanese Army appropriated three AML-90s and nine obsolete T17 Staghounds to stave off repeated assaults by LAA forces from the hotel district. Due to the armoured cars&#x27; heightened vulnerability to RPG-7s, their crews began using debris as makeshift barricades. Muslim fighters failed in attempting to destroy the AMLs with RPGs, as well as B-10 and M40 recoilless rifles, since the projectiles lacked a clear trajectory in the rubble. The AML-90s&#x27; immense firepower at close quarters soon resulted in great structural damage to portside Beirut; a number of fortified buildings were wrecked by 90 mm HE shells, and those struck by multiple HEAT volleys demolished on their foundations. With truck-mounted ZU-23-2s covering their advance, the AMLs advanced on Allenby Street, flattening all resistance, and took the waterfront. Although both the LAA and the leftist Lebanese National Movement hastily brought up Charioteers and M41 Walker Bulldog tanks, so much wreckage was blocking the streets they could not manoeuvre. It was impossible to shoot accurately through the debris, and tanks could only manage speculative fire to discourage the AMLs.

In 1983, LAF tanks with AML-90s in support were sent to eliminate Amal militants then threatening elements of Multinational Force in Lebanon (MNF) at the Lebanese University. Following the Siege of Beirut, the LAF again mobilised its AMLs to occupy positions vacated by withdrawing Israeli troops. An undisclosed number were upgraded to AML-90 Lynx standard, including laser rangefinders, and continued to see service as late as 2014 against Syrian militants.

=====Militia use=====
Panhard AMLs were favoured by the Lebanese militias due to their flexibility, especially in urban combat situations which saw them deployed against heavier Syrian armour. A detailed analysis undertaken by the United States Army Research Laboratory in 1979 found the AML &quot;operated effectively in Beirut&quot; and noted that &quot;the ease with which the Panhard is driven and repaired, and the absence of tracks, provide the mobility desirable in an urban environment.&quot; Modifications to militia AMLs included replacement of the original Michelin tyres with an air-pocketed type more resistant to mortar shrapnel, as well as increased armour plate—fabricated after the appearance of Syrian tanks made it difficult ordering volunteers to man the lightly protected vehicles.

Christian Phalangist militiamen deployed twelve AML-90s as assault guns during the Siege of Tel al-Zaatar, using their elevated 90 mm cannon to knock out second or third storey fortifications shielding Palestinian guerrillas. AML-90s of the Druze Progressive Socialist Party&#x27;s (PSP) People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) militia also swung into action against five Staghounds of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces during a raid on Fayadiyeh barracks in mid-1976. The armoured cars were incompetently handled by the leftist forces, and later abandoned near Kahale with an AMX-13 due to mechanical problems.

=====UNIFIL=====

In April 1978, AMLs of the Irish Army were deployed with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), where they saw considerable action against the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia. Ireland had originally purchased 16 AML-60s in 1964 for its large United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) contingent. The deterioration of the security situation there led to its purchase of another 16 AML-60s and 20 AML-90s, which had been initially rejected due to their expense but were now deemed necessary for their significant offensive capabilities. A reconnaissance company consisting of at least 4 UNFICYP AML-90s and 14 Panhard M3s were subsequently shipped from Cyprus to Lebanon alongside the 43rd Irish Battalion, which joined the newly formed UNIFIL. As the most heavily armed of the national UNIFIL contingents, the Irish AMLs frequently functioned as a mobile force reserve. They were also used for manning checkpoints between the belligerent SLA and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) positions. By 1980 at least one AML had been damaged by a PLO RPG-7 aimed at the SLA lines. The armoured car caught fire, though all three crew members survived.

On August 12, 1980, SLA militiamen attacked an Irish UNIFIL checkpoint at the village of At Tiri in southern Lebanon, having been antagonised by a statement made by Brian Lenihan Snr, Ireland&#x27;s minister for foreign affairs, which they perceived as supportive of the PLO. One peacekeeper was mortally wounded, nine others taken prisoner, and the checkpoint overrun. The SLA then deployed four M9 Half-tracks equipped with Browning HB heavy machine guns, which they used to harass UNIFIL convoys. Two days later, Irish AML-90s counterattacked and retook the village. One half-track was immobilised, and a second destroyed after receiving a direct hit from a 90 mm shell. A third was abandoned when its Browning was disabled by warning fire from an AML&#x27;s coaxial machine gun. The armoured cars also held a tense standoff with SLA M50 &quot;Super&quot; Sherman tanks on the outskirts of At Tiri, although the latter ultimately declined to intervene in the fighting and were not engaged by Irish forces. They withdrew upon the arrival of Dutch UNIFIL reinforcements armed with BGM-71 TOW missiles.

At least one AML-90 crew commander was awarded Ireland&#x27;s highest military honour, the Military Medal for Gallantry, for actions during the At Tiri engagement. Irish AMLs may have seen action again in 1996 during Operation Grapes of Wrath.

====Yemen====
In 1974, North Yemeni political leader Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar traveled to Saudi Arabia to negotiate the transfer of arms to the fledgling Yemen Arab Republic, which was rebuilding its armed forces after a recent civil war. The Royal Saudi Army agreed to donate 31 AML-90s from its own stocks, as well as provide the necessary instructors for training Yemeni crews. When Ali Abdullah Saleh became president of North Yemen in the late 1970s, the AML-90s were transferred to various paramilitary units in Sana&#x27;a and repurposed as internal security vehicles. Upon Yemeni unification, they were adopted into the integrated Republic of Yemen Armed Forces. Yemen purchased another 15 AML-90s and AML-60s from France in 1998.

In the early 2000s, Yemen&#x27;s army and security forces possessed a fleet of 125 AML-90s and 60 AMLs of other variants, most of which had been acquired from undisclosed sources. Due to attrition and age, the fleet dwindled to 95 by 2013. In 2014, the Yemeni army stripped a number of AML-90s of their turrets and refitted them to its BTR-60PB armoured personnel carriers, suggesting the former were finally nearing the end of their service life. Some AMLs have continued to see service in the ongoing Yemeni Civil War.

====Iraq====
During the mid 1960s, France was investigating new sources for cheap, good quality crude oil in the Middle East and began cultivating strategic partnerships with both Iraq and Iran accordingly. The establishment of strong bilateral ties between the French and Iraqi governments in 1967 coincided with several oil concessions being granted to a French firm, Elf Aquitaine, and an Iraqi military programme to acquire new Western arms in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. A delegation from the Iraqi Armed Forces first visited Paris around December 1967, and was followed by a second led personally by General Abdul Rahman Arif in February 1968. The Iraqis apparently placed orders for 75 AML armoured cars during both visits. Both orders resulted in a total of 106 AML-60s and 40 AML-90s being acquired by Iraq. These sales were perceived by the French government as a practical manifestation of its new Middle Eastern policies and an opportunity for cultivating more interest in new oil and other commercial deals France hoped to sign with Iraq. The decision to transfer AMLs to Iraq was, much like the similar sale to Saudi Arabia, vilified by the French domestic press as a violation of a voluntary arms embargo imposed on the Middle East. In both cases, the French government maintained that the embargo excluded only arms with &quot;clear offensive characteristics&quot;, such as tanks or fighter aircraft.

Following the July 17 Revolution, the Ba&#x27;ath Party assumed power in Iraq and turned to the Soviet Union as its principal supplier of arms. Between 1968 and 1970 the Iraqi Army underwent a second major rearmament programme with Soviet assistance. However, the Soviet government used this relationship to exert political pressure on the Ba&#x27;athist regime. Iraqi officials also believed the Soviets were withholding their most sophisticated weapons from export and therefore embarked on a diversification effort to find secondary suppliers of arms, preferably in the West. In 1972 the Ba&#x27;ath Party repaid France for not opposing its nationalisation of Iraqi oil by placing an order for some AML-90s. Estimates of the number initially sold and delivered to Iraq vary from 8 to 38; however, it is clear that this largely symbolic purchase was instrumental in re-igniting defence ties with France. In 1974 the Iraqis placed a second order for another 20 AML-60s and 42 AML-90s, and subsequently for 2 AML-60s and 25 AML-90s. Most of the orders were small and timed to coincide with Iraqi requests for access to far more advanced French defence technology, but they rapidly accumulated; Panhard recorded the sale of 131 AML-60s and 101 AML-90s to Iraq between 1972 and 1980.

In Iraqi service, AML platoons were typically attached at the brigade or battalion level and utilised for their traditional role of reconnaissance. A single Iraqi armoured reconnaissance platoon may have consisted of up to 8 AMLs. Each Iraqi Army corps and infantry division also had its own reconnaissance battalion with 46 AMLs and BRDM-2 scout cars divided into two companies. Most conventional reconnaissance duties were carried out by the AML-90s, which were valued for the size and range of their armament, while the AML-60s were relegated to secondary battlefield tasks.

Iraqi AMLs first saw action in Khuzestan Province during the 1980 invasion of Iran. Lacking adequate air cover, a number were destroyed by Iranian Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters on September 28 near Bostan. In 1991, AML-90s were deployed again, somewhat ineffectually, against United States Marine Corps and Saudi National Guard troops during the Battle of Khafji. Their appearance at Khafji may have led to some initial confusion, since the armoured cars were also operated by the Saudis. Many Iraqi crews failed to take advantage of their vehicles&#x27; mobility and engaged the coalition forces from static positions until they were wiped out by artillery. During the Liberation of Kuwait and the subsequent coalition counter-offensive, air superiority was the deciding factor in most reconnaissance operations. The US made use of scout helicopters armed with BGM-71 TOW missiles, which frequently obliterated Iraqi AMLs at long range before they could observe or harass allied ground forces. Others were destroyed on the ground during the first day of the coalition thrust into Kuwait, namely by US M1 Abrams tanks.

The US estimated that the Iraqi Army was operating 300 AMLs in 1990. Iraq lost about half its armoured reconnaissance vehicles during the Gulf War. A small number of AML-90s and AML-60s remained in service, although they were increasingly threatened by erratic maintenance and lack of spare parts. When a US-led coalition invaded Iraq in 2003, Iraqi AMLs clashed with a contingent of American tanks attached to 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines as they advanced on Nasiriyah.

====Egypt====
Egypt first encountered Israeli AML-90s in the Sinai Peninsula during the Six-Day War, where at least one platoon was deployed against Egyptian T-54 tanks on several occasions. Some were captured by the defending Egyptian forces during the Israeli campaign, with individual examples being pressed into service. Their performance sufficiently impressed the Egyptian Army that it later issued its own requirement for an armoured car with a turret-mounted 90 mm gun, preferably firing discarding sabot projectiles for improved anti-tank purposes. Bids were accepted from six European contractors (including Panhard), for the programme, although it is unclear what vehicle was adopted.

===Argentina===

In the lead-up to the Falklands War, Argentine commanders considered that the often extremely boggy off-road conditions in the islands were unsuitable for all of the armoured vehicles available to them. Consequently, Argentine AMX-13-105 tanks were not deployed. For on-road operations, 12 AML-90s from &quot;Escuadron de Exploracion Caballeria Blindada 181&quot; (181st Armoured Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron) and an unknown additional number from &quot;Escuadron de Exploracion Caballeria Blindada 10&quot; were stationed near Port Stanley. 

While some Panhard crews reportedly took part in the Battle of Wireless Ridge, they appear to have fought dismounted, as makeshift infantry. There is no evidence that the Panhards themselves fired a shot in anger (let alone encountering UK FV101 Scorpions or FV107 Scimitars). The Panhards were captured in Stanley after the general surrender of Argentinian forces.

===El Salvador===

In the Salvadoran Civil War, at least one AML-90 was destroyed by FMLN insurgents with rifle grenades and an M67 recoilless rifle.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
In 1987, during the Toyota War, FANT&#x27;s use of swift wheeled vehicles, including AML-90s, allowed Chadian forces to break through combined arms formations and cause severe damage before the slower Libyan tanks could track or engage their targets. The Panhards, deployed in concert with MILAN missile teams at strategic hill junctures, frequently ambushed T-55s at a range of under three hundred metres.

In mid-December 2010, AMLs manned by Laurent Gbagbo&#x27;s supporters were used to intimidate Ivorian civilians in Abidjan and the western countryside.

The &quot;Ecole de Formation et d&#x27;Application des Troupes Blindées&quot;, at Mbanza-Ngungu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was originally established by French Military Cooperation Mission to instruct African AML crews. Today, the academy can host 70 trainees; ten African armies are currently participating in the program.

==Variants==
===AML-60===
Known more formally as the &quot;AML HE 60-7&quot;, or by its manufacturer&#x27;s code &quot;AML-245B&quot;, the AML-60 was Panhard&#x27;s initial production model and included a rounded turret with twin 7.62mm machine guns on the left and a breech-loaded 60 mm (2.36 in.) mortar on the right, with 3,800 stored rounds of 7.62mm ammunition and 43 to 53 mortar projectiles, respectively. The mortar can still be muzzle loaded from outside the vehicle, but is unique in its opening breech locked by a falling block much like direct fire artillery. It has an elevation of +80° and a depression of −15°. Two types of mortars are available: a Hotchkiss-Brandt CM60A1 or, in later production models, a Cloche Spéciale (CS) 60 designed by the French government&#x27;s &quot;Direction technique des armements terrestres&quot; (DTAT). The ergonomic dimensions of the CS 60&#x27;s ammunition allow ten more mortar bombs to carried for a total of 53, as opposed to the CM60A1&#x27;s 43. Both can be fired on a flat trajectory and are effective at no more than in the direct role, or in the indirect role. Separate combat and command variants of the AML HE 60-7 turrets were manufactured, the latter being fitted with additional radio equipment and therefore possessing comparatively limited stowage. The number of stored ammunition is reduced to 32 mortar bombs and 3,200 7.62mm rounds, respectively.

An AML-60&#x27;s crew commander acquires targets, directs the gunner, and makes a series of ranging and ordnance calculations to ascertain firing angles. Sighting is optical, and carried out through an M112/3 combined monocular telescope and binocular periscope. Elevation aiming control is linked to the mortar but provision made for manual scanning. In late production models, the micrometre markings on the sights could be illuminated for night firing.

===AML 60-20===
Known as the &quot;AML HE 60-20&quot;, the AML 60-20 replaced both co-axial 7.62mm machine guns with an M621 20 mm autocannon with 500 stored rounds. The 20 mm autocannon was based on the MG 151 and has an elevation of +50° and a depression of −8°, allowing it to engage low-flying aircraft as necessary. It fires both armour-piercing and high-explosive rounds with a muzzle velocity of . An optional 7.62mm pintle-mounted machine gun can be mounted on the turret roof as necessary, although only 1,000 rounds of ammunition may be stored.

===AML 60-20 Serval===
The AML-60-20 Serval mated an AML-60 chassis to the much larger and more sophisticated &quot;Serval&quot; turret designed by Hispano-Suiza CNMP, with considerable improvements to the firepower, sights, and ammunition stowage of the original AML 60-20 concept. Two types of 20 mm autocannon were offered: the M693, or the Oerlikon KAD B-16 (Hispano-Suiza HS.820). The original CS DTAT or CM60A1 mortars were replaced by the long-barelled Brandt 60 mm LR gun-mortar, which more than doubled the range of the main armament. The Brandt LR also fired a unique armour-piercing projectile. Due to interior space taken up by the larger mortar, the autocannon and a 7.62mm machine gun were shifted to a new position at the rear of the turret.

AML 60-20 Servals were the first AML-60 variants to be fitted with an electrical fire-control system developed specifically for gun-mortars. The apparatus consisted of two separate control units, one for the gunner and commander, and a new rangefinder. It also included an inclinometer and was designed to allow the main armament to be fired while the AML was parked on sloping ground, without compromising accuracy. A gunner could make the appropriate corrections to bearing aim, based on the altitude according to the horizontal.

===AML 60-12===

Known as the &quot;AML HE 60-12&quot;, the AML 60-12 was identical in every manner to the AML 60-20 but replaced the 20 mm autocannon with a single 12.7mm heavy machine gun. Its turret had an ammunition capacity of 1,200 rounds of 12.7mm in 12 boxes of 100 rounds and 41 rounds of 60 mm.

===AML-90===
Formally known as the &quot;AML H-90&quot;, or by its manufacturer&#x27;s code &quot;AML-245C&quot;, the AML-90 was designed for carrying out rearguard duties and substituting for the heavier tanks and armoured fighting vehicles deployed in a more linear fashion at the front. Its major feature was its DEFA low-pressure 90 mm rifled gun, which permitted the anti-tank and reconnaissance elements of French territorial units to be combined into a new component capable of knocking out the heaviest vehicle likely to be ranged against it, the Soviet ASU-57 and ASU-85. This was a direct response to Soviet airborne doctrine—Moscow&#x27;s tacticians then attached great significance to the deployment of paratroopers, with their own artillery and armour, deep behind enemy lines.

The DEFA D921 was the first 90 mm low-pressure gun to be mass-produced in France. It was specifically designed for vehicles weighing under ten tonnes in mind, and the successful mating of such a large calibre weapon on the five tonne AML chassis was then considered a major engineering achievement. This made an AML-90 exceptionally well-armed in proportion to its weight, and offered the advantage of easier recoil loads over conventional tank cannon. The weapon was developed by the &quot;Etablissement d&#x27;Etudes et de Fabrications d&#x27;Armement de Bourges&quot; (EFAB) in the 1950s and partly modelled after the Mecar series of lightweight 90 mm KEnerga guns from Belgium. Unlike the Belgian guns however, the DEFA D921 lacked a smoothbore barrel, instead utilising shallow rifling with a rather slow twist to impart a low rate of spin to the discharging projectile. Its ammunition was also fin-stabilised, but improved on the Mecar ammunition by incorporating the fins as a direct extension of the individual shell, making it much shorter.

As mounted on the AML-90, the D921 has an elevation of +15° and a depression of −8°. It is provided with a co-axial 7.62mm machine gun to the left of the main armament. The turret is traversed by rotating the gunner&#x27;s handwheels, which are not power assisted. Cranking the turret through a full 360° takes approximately twenty-five seconds. A total of 20 90 mm shells and 2,400 rounds of machine gun ammunition are carried. The 90 mm high-explosive anti-tank round possesses a muzzle velocity of and will penetrate of armour at an incidence of 0°, or of armour at 60°. The high-explosive round has a muzzle velocity of . These rather low velocity performances, although suitable for close combat, make hit probability poor at extended ranges and proved to be a serious handicap when fighting tanks. Combat experience during the South African Border War and the Six-Day War proved that the AML was decisively outranged by both the T-34/85 and the M48 Patton, respectively. Its rather austere fire control, with optical ranging based on the crew commander&#x27;s estimates, was also problematic. The vehicle is unable to fire on the move, since its transmission cannot absorb the recoil of such a large gun while in forward motion and suffers excessive wear as a result. Nevertheless, during at least three conflicts the AML proved capable of knocking out main battle tanks, often by attacking from the flank or rear. The heaviest armour destroyed by an AML-90 was likely a Libyan T-62 during the Toyota War, in March 1988.

The D921 recoils approximately 58 cm and is then returned to the firing position by a hydropneumatic recuperator. It is fitted with a double-baffle muzzle brake which reduces the magnitude of the firing impulses and consequently, the average recoil forces. However, the deflection of propellant gases rearward and the resulting overpressure may cause whiplash to the crew. During runout the breech is opened and an empty shell casing ejected; the breech then remains open for reloading.

===AML-90 Lynx===
Also known as the &quot;AML D-90 Lynx&quot;, the AML-90 Lynx was a heavily upgraded and modernised AML-90 fitted with a sophisticated turret and ranging system. Like the H-90, the D-90 Lynx turret mounted the same D921 90 mm gun on the right and a co-axial 7.62mm machine gun on the left. The main armament now had an improved elevation gear and could be elevated from −8° to +35°. Other modifications included the replacement of the unlit optical sights with TJN2-90 combined day/night sights. The new sights were designed around a light intensifier tube with automatic gain control to enable sighting in the darkness without the need for artificial illumination, and had a range of nearly . They could be fitted with additional features such as slope compensation or tachometry facilities. A menagerie of other sights and sighting equipment were also offered with the AML-90 Lynx for export customers, including the same CANASTA night sights package and electronics suite as fitted to the AMX-10RC. The CANASTA system included a low-light television camera and display units for the AML&#x27;s gunner and commander, along with a moving electronic reticle with sight angle corrections. This somewhat compensated for low hit probability from the first 90 mm round at long range, allowing for the automatic engagement of moving targets.

One of the defining characteristics of the AML-90 Lynx was the large searchlight mounted co-axially with its 90 mm gun, a domed commander&#x27;s cupola with vision blocks reminiscent of the Eland Mk7, and a boxlike laser rangefinder on the gun mantlet. Two types of French laser rangefinders were available as standard, although several foreign designs such as the Avimo LV3 could also be fitted: the TCV 107 and the TCV 29. Both rangefinders automatically calculate the range to target and feed this information to the crew commander, eliminating the need for rough estimation as before.

AML-90 Lynxes were offered with a variety of new power plants, namely a Peugeot XD 3T diesel engine developing 71 kW (95 hp) for an extended range of . In 1979, one AML-90 Lynx prototype was showcased with a Mercedes-Benz OM617 developing 86 kW (115 hp) but it remains unclear if this model entered production. The armament as fitted to the D-90 Lynx turret could be also configured greatly, including the modification of the D921 gun to fire APFSDS ammunition with a muzzle velocity of , or its replacement with the considerably more powerful Cockerill Mk. III medium pressure 90 mm gun as mounted on the EE-9 Cascavel. Many of these turrets were equipped with hydraulic traverse, eliminating the necessity for manual operation. Traversing a powered Lynx turret through a full 360° takes less than fifteen seconds.

The first export sales of the AML-90 Lynx were to Burundi, which ordered 12 in 1982. Morocco purchased 20 in 1988, and another 23 were accepted by the Chadian National Armed Forces (FANT) as military aid during the final stage of the Chadian–Libyan conflict. Small quantities were also donated by the French government to Senegal, Togo, and Guinea. An undisclosed number of Lebanese and Kenyan AML-90s have been upgraded with Lynx turrets as well.

===AML S530===
Designed as a self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon, the AML S530 was developed solely for export and is operated by the Venezuelan Army. It carries twin M621 20 mm autocannon, with 600 stored rounds. The autocannons have an elevation of +70° and a depression of −10°. Ranging is optical and carried out by a roof-mounted periscopic sight very similar to that installed on the AML HE 60-7. The sight has been modified for anti-aircraft purposes and has a vertical field of view of 20°. It has a sun filter, a collimator with an adjustable illumination feature for night firing, an adjustable display lead for tracking fast or slow moving targets and aircraft either flying horizontally or diving, and automatic fire range estimation effective up to . More specialised anti-aircraft sights, as well as sights designed solely for engaging ground targets, could also be installed when necessary. Both 20 mm guns are equipped with an ammunition feed mechanism storing 260 rounds each. They can fired either on semi-automatic, fully automatic, or in short bursts, with a cyclic rate of fire of 750 rounds per minute per barrel. One barrel may also be selected at a time. The ammunition feed is housed in the turret&#x27;s elevating module, and fed from an ammunition bin in the turret basket. The 20 mm armour-piercing round possesses a muzzle velocity of 1,000 m/s and will penetrate 23 mm of armour at an incidence of 0°. The high explosive and incendiary rounds have a muzzle velocity of .

An AML S530 prototype was first showcased at Satory in 1971 and twelve were immediately ordered by Venezuela. They were produced and delivered by 1973, but no further export sales followed. A smaller, more rounded variant of the same S530 turret with improved sights was later mounted on an ERC 90 Sagaie chassis for a Gabonese military requirement.

===AML-20===
The &quot;AML H-20&quot; had a turret with full power traverse and elevation and was armed with a single 20 mm M693 F2 autocannon; a 7.62mm machine gun was also mounted co-axially with the main armament and a similar weapon could be fitted to the turret roof for anti-aircraft defence. The M693 could be elevated from −8° to +50°. Unlike the M621 mounted on the AML 60-20 and AML S530, this weapon employed cartridges with mechanical priming and was paired to a dual-feed ammunition supply system, allowing more than one type of ammunition to be loaded at once, with gunners being able to switch between the two. It can fire all Hispano-Suiza HS.820 20 mm rounds as well as a specially developed French Type 693 sub-calibre armour-piercing round. The armour-piercing ammunition will kill any other light armoured car at ranges of up to , and also damage the sides of an older main battle tank. Like the M621 single shots, limited bursts, or continuous bursts can be fired.

Two separate turrets were offered for the AML-20: the French TL-120 SO by the &quot;Societe d&#x27;Applications des Machines Motrices&quot; (SAMM), and the South African LCT-20 by Denel Land Systems, which was originally designed for the Ratel-20 infantry fighting vehicle. The TL-120 SO turret was open-topped and 1,000 rounds of 20 mm ammunition were carried. It was one of the most well-protected turrets fitted to the AML chassis to date, with a maximum armour plate thickness of 20 mm. This turret was also hydraulically powered and could be rotated through a full 360° in ten seconds or less. The gunner&#x27;s optical sights were adopted from the AML S530 and a secondary periscope optimised specifically for anti-aircraft purposes also fitted. No sights were provided for the crew commander, leaving the gunner responsible for acquiring targets.

The LCT-20 turret was considerably more sophisticated, incorporating a range of night vision equipment and a laser rangefinder. About 300 rounds of 20 mm and 1,000 rounds of ready use 7.62mm ammunition were carried. The LCT-20 was not open-topped, although for observation purposes there was a domed cupola with four direct observation windows. Denel sights provided for both the gunner and commander were effective up to .

===AML-30===
A prototype trialled during early 1970s, the &quot;AML H-30&quot; mated an AML-90 chassis and turret to a single 30 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.831 anti-aircraft gun and was the first AML to be offered with powered turret controls. The 30 mm cannon could be fired on semiautomatic, in bursts, or fully automatic. A co-axial 7.62mm machine gun could be mounted to the left of the main armament. Stored ammunition was 200 30 mm rounds, and 2,200 7.62mm rounds for the machine gun.

===AML NA-2===
Due to the increasing obsolescence of low pressure, direct fire weapons in the anti-tank role, Panhard manufactured at least one dedicated anti-tank guided missile carrier variant of the AML-90—the same chassis with its turret removed and replaced by a launching system for four SS.11 or two SS.12/AS.12 missiles. Two 7.62mm machine guns were mounted to the centre of the new system for self-defence.

===Other variants===

Over a dozen variants of the Panhard AML were developed to meet a wide range of mission requirements, including border patrol, airfield security, light raiding duties, and liaison purposes. At some point Panhard developed four other vehicles for these roles based on the AML chassis but designated them &quot;EPF&quot;, &quot;EPA&quot;, &quot;ERA&quot;, and &quot;EPR&quot;, respectively. The liaison model, the EPR, was turretless and carried only a ring-mounted 12.7mm heavy machine gun. The ERA marketed for the role of raiding and harassing larger armoured or mechanised forces was similar to the AML-20, but could also carry a mount for six MILAN missiles in place of the 20 mm autocannon. The EPF and EPA carried up to three 7.62mm general-purpose machine guns apiece. Yet another variant, the AML &quot;Eclairage&quot;, was identical to the AML-20 and ERA.

The AML-30 and AML-90 spawned amphibious models, which bore propellers and form-fitting, watertight boxes over their hulls. These were then inflated with polyurethane, allowing the armoured car to float. The polyurethane lining had the advantage of being self-extinguishing if ignited by flame, and of providing a detonation point for a hollow charge shell before it could reach the armour plate. Amphibious AMLs were propelled through the water at and were steered by their front wheels. The amphibious box increased the weight of the chassis by about ten percent.

Individual armies have also retrofitted existing AMLs with new armament adopted from other armoured vehicles, such as the complete turret and 30 mm RARDEN autocannon of the FV107 Scimitar light tank.

The Eland Mk7 is an AML derivative built under licence in South Africa with a number of major modifications. Although the vehicle fulfills a similar role to its Panhard counterpart, it differs both in design and construction. The engine at the rear of the Eland is water-cooled whilst the French vehicle&#x27;s engine is air-cooled, necessitating a different rear hull. An Eland&#x27;s hull is also somewhat longer.

Several companies currently offer upgrades or comprehensive rebuild packages for AMLs, particularly with regards to the elderly Panhard Model 4 HD engine, for which spare parts are difficult and expensive to source. Saymar, an Israeli firm, has proposed replacing it with a two-litre Toyota diesel engine developing 76 kW (102 hp). Another extensive AML modernisation programme is being marketed by a subsidiary of the Saudi Military Industries Corporation. Overhauled Saudi AML engines are supported on a horizontal sliding frame, allowing them to be replaced by a trained maintenance team in twenty minutes.

==In popular culture==
The Panhard AML has made some major film appearances, most notably in the 1987 British film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, when two Moroccan Army AML-90s were mocked up as Soviet reconnaissance vehicles pursuing Afghan Mujahadeen. These examples included mounted RPK machine guns and communications not dissimilar to those in the BRDM-2.

AMLs were first portrayed in the 1973 French thriller &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, and 1974 Italian war film &quot;While There&#x27;s War There&#x27;s Hope&quot;, which featured an AML-90 of the Portuguese Armed Forces during the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence.

Two AML-90s stand in for German scout cars serving with the Afrika Korps appear in the 1984 French war film &quot;Les Morfalous&quot;.

A Moroccan Army AML-90 briefly appears in the 2018 political thriller film &quot;Beirut&quot;, mocked up as a Lebanese militia armored car passing by outside the main entrance of the Beirut International Airport Passenger Terminal.

<text>Andrew Joseph Galambos (AJG) (born Ifj. Galambos József András; June 27, 1924 in Hungary – April 10, 1997 in Orange County, California) was an astrophysicist and philosopher. 

He presented his theories of freedom and Volitional Science in oral lectures through his Free Enterprise Institute from 1961 to 1989 in Los Angeles, California. He developed over 117 courses for FEI&#x27;s curriculum over a period of twenty-eight years. As Galambos&#x27; literary executor, William W. Martin completed the all encompassing &quot;Book One&quot; that the professor intended to have published in written form which Martin published under the title &quot;Sic Itur Ad Astra&quot; (Latin to English translation: &quot;This is the way to the stars&quot;). Within Sic Itur Ad Astra is the &quot;roadmap to freedom&quot; Course V-201: The Nature and Protection of Primary Property. Galambos explicitly instructed his trustee, Galambos&#x27; former lawyer Wayne Joyner, to provide funding from his estate to his literary executor, Martin, to edit, print, and publish his books. Instead, Joyner refused to fund the book and instead used the finances to fund unauthorized projects including the inaccurate, mistake ridden and incomplete Sic Itur Ad Astra Vol. 1 which he pulled off of the market in favor of even more inaccurate heavily edited &quot;digitized courses.&quot; Martin was left to fund the project on his own and eventually completed the full book for the professor in the year 2003. Today the company that William W. Martin founded, Spaceland Publications, is carrying forward the ideas of Andrew J. Galambos and upholding his explicit instructions to publish and print Galambos&#x27; magnum opus &quot;Sic Itur Ad Astra&quot; and books of Galambos&#x27; other important courses. &quot;Sic Itur Ad Astra&quot; is a fifteen volume, 6,118 page book containing the exact words of Andrew J. Galambos&#x27; most important live presentation lectures including courses V-50, V-50X, V-201 and the Joe Pyne Interview complete with a detailed index innovated by Martin which he named the &quot;Concordex&quot;. 

==Overview==
Galambos (AJG) defined &quot;freedom&quot; as the societal condition that exists when every individual has full (100%) control over his own property. 

==Early life==
Galambos was born in Hungary in 1924. His father, Joseph Galambos-Brown, had been an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army in World War I and then became a highly regarded architect. After the war, Galambos&#x27; father decided to emigrate to America to avoid his son becoming &quot;cannon fodder&quot; in a second world war, which he saw coming.

Despite his father&#x27;s wish to keep his son out of war, Galambos volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army during WWII. After completing his undergraduate work at City College of New York, he moved to Minnesota in 1948 where he met his future wife, Suzanne Siegel, a fellow student at the University of Minnesota. They married in 1949.

==Education==
Galambos earned degrees in physics from City College of New York and the University of Minnesota.

==Early career==
Galambos moved to Los Angeles in 1952 to work for North American Aviation. Beginning in 1958, Galambos worked in the Space Technology Laboratory (STL) division of Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, which later became TRW Space Technology Laboratories (STL). There, Galambos worked as an astrophysicist, calculating trajectories for Atlas ICBMs before the advent of high-speed digital computers. 

As Galambos&#x27; ideas on freedom and proprietary government crystallized, he became disillusioned with his work at STL, which had evolved almost exclusively to focus on the development of inter-continental ballistic missiles for military purposes. Galambos did not want to work on weapons of war.

Around 1958–1959 Galambos formulated a proposal to the director of STL, George Mueller, for a project to develop rockets for space exploration, including lunar landings. Mueller turned it down. A few years later, however, Mueller took a position with NASA where he worked on the Apollo 11 human lunar landing project, the same type of project he had turned down when Galambos proposed it to him at STL.

In 1960, Galambos left the aerospace industry and joined the faculty of Whittier College to teach physics, astrophysics, and mathematics. While at Whittier, Galambos presented a popular extracurricular class entitled, &quot;The Decline and Renaissance of Laissez-Faire Capitalism.&quot; He also taught previously at New York University, Brooklyn College, Stevens Institute of Technology of Hoboken, New Jersey, the University of Minnesota, and Carleton College of Northfield, Minnesota.

== The Free Enterprise Institute ==
In 1961, Galambos established The Free Enterprise Institute (FEI) which was the name he used for his teaching business. His initial course was entitled Course 100, Capitalism: The Key to Survival. He eventually taught courses on intellectual property, investments and insurance, financial planning, physics, and journalism, among others.

Galambos had an important colleague in Jay Stuart Snelson (1936–2011). Snelson was the senior lecturer for FEI from 1964 to 1978, teaching both V-50 and V-201. Snelson was later fired by Galambos for breaking his contract and plagiarizing his work. &quot;Announcement of the Termination of Jay Snelson,&quot; Andrew J. Galambos, July 25, 1979. 

===Courses V-50 and V-201===
On March 14, 1961 Andrew J. Galambos founded the Free Enterprise Institute in Los Angeles, CA. On the twentieth of April of that year, he delivered to a paying audience the first formal lecture of the Institute. That lecture and those to follow would constitute what Galambos called Course 100: “Capitalism—The Key to Survival!” That course soon became the antecedent to Course V-50: “Capitalism—The Liberal Revolution.” Course V-50 eventually consisted of sixteen sessions plus three workshops.

In the fall of 1964, Professor Galambos introduced a twelve-session course he called F-201: The Theory of Primary Property. This was later named “V-201,” in which he taught the nature of primary property (thoughts, ideas and actions) and how freedom, which was the product of total Capitalism, could be built for the first and only time in history. Whereas course V-50 was deemed by him to be the cosmological portion of the theory, course V-201 was the technological portion.

By the year 1968 Professor Galambos determined that his V-50 lectures had reached publishable maturity. But it would still take another nine years before he would discover how they should read in printed form.

Between 1964 and 1977 Galambos honed and perfected course V-201, which he deemed to be the technological roadmap, or blueprint, revealing the “natural republic”—a free society where each individual is in 100% control of their own property. This was a concept he introduced in course V-50 but took to a much higher level in course V-201. 

At the end of the academic year of 1977, Galambos announced that V-201 had received its finishing touch. That oral presentation consisted of forty-eight sessions and three workshops. Together courses V-50 and V-201 constitute a unified theory called the theory of volition.

====Volitional science====
Volitional Science is Galambos&#x27; term for so-called &quot;social science,&quot; however, unlike social &quot;science&quot;, which is not a true science at all, Volitional Science is a true science derived exclusively through the use of the scientific method. It is derived through physical science, physics, and he said that Volitional Science is the third science after physics and biology. It&#x27;s a science in which Capitalism is a derivative and therefore an alternative to, and complete replacement of, all political mechanisms. 

====Property====
Galambos defined property as a volitional being’s life and all non-procreative derivatives thereof. This includes one’s physical being (primordial property), one’s thoughts, ideas and actions (primary property), and tangible derivatives of one’s life such as money, houses, automobiles, etc. (secondary property). Sic Itur Ad Astra, V-50: Session 1, Part A, pp. 22-24.

==Death==
Galambos was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and died on April 10, 1997.

<text>Jan Kubiš (24 June 1913 – 18 June 1942) was a Czech soldier, one of a team of Czechoslovak British-trained paratroopers sent to eliminate acting Reichsprotektor (Realm-Protector) of Bohemia and Moravia, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, in 1942 as part of Operation Anthropoid. During the assassination attempt, Kubiš threw a makeshift grenade that mortally wounded Heydrich.

==Biography==
Jan Kubiš was born in 1913 in Dolní Vilémovice, Moravia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (present-day Czech Republic). Jan was a Boy Scout.

Jan Kubiš, having previously been an active member of Orel, started his military career as a Czechoslovak army conscript on 1 November 1935 by 31st Infantry Regiment &quot;&quot;Arco&quot; in Jihlava. After passing petty officer course and promotion to corporal, Kubiš served some time in Znojmo before being transferred to 34th infantry regiment &quot;Marksman Jan Čapek&quot;&quot; in Opava, where he served at guard battalion stationed in Jakartovice. Here, Kubiš reached promotion to platoon sergeant.

During the Czechoslovak mobilisation of 1938, Kubiš served as deputy commander of a platoon in Czechoslovak border fortifications in the Opava area. Following the Munich Agreement and demobilisation, Kubiš was discharged from army on 19 October 1938 and returned to his civilian life, working at a brick factory.

At the eve of World War II, on 16 June 1939, Kubiš fled Czechoslovakia and joined a forming Czechoslovak unit in Kraków, Poland. Soon he was transferred to Algiers, where he entered the French Foreign Legion. He fought in France during the early stage of World War II and received his Croix de Guerre there.

A month after the German victory in the Battle of France, Kubiš fled to Great Britain, where he received training as a paratrooper. The Free Czechoslovaks, as he and other self-exiled Czechoslovaks were called, were stationed at Cholmondeley Castle near Malpas in Cheshire. He and his best friend, Jozef Gabčík, both befriended the Ellison family, from Ightfield, Shropshire, whom they met while in Whitchurch, Shropshire.

In 1941, Kubiš was dropped into Czechoslovakia as part of Operation Anthropoid, where he died following the successful assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. His remains were buried secretly in a mass grave at the Ďáblice cemetery in Prague. Since this was unknown after World War II, Karel Čurda, the member of their squad who betrayed them to the Nazis, was coincidentally also buried at the cemetery. However, in 1990 mass graves were excavated and a memorial site with symbolic gravestones was established instead. In 2009, a memorial was built at the place of the attack on Heydrich.

==The elimination of Heydrich in Prague==
Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš were airlifted along with seven soldiers from Czechoslovakia&#x27;s army-in-exile in the United Kingdom and two other groups named &quot;Silver A&quot; and &quot;Silver B&quot; (who had different missions) by a Royal Air Force Halifax of No. 138 Squadron into Czechoslovakia at 10 pm on 28 December 1941. In Prague, they contacted several families and anti-Nazi organisations who helped them during the preparations for the assassination.

On 27 May 1942, Heydrich had planned to meet Hitler in Berlin. German documents suggest that Hitler intended to transfer Heydrich to German occupied France, where the French resistance was gaining ground. Heydrich would have to pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merged with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction, in the Prague suburb of Libeň, was well-suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. At 10:30 am, Heydrich proceeded on his daily commute from his home in Panenské Břežany to Prague Castle. Gabčík and Kubiš waited at the tram stop on the curve near Bulovka Hospital in Prague 8-Libeň. As Heydrich&#x27;s open-topped Mercedes-Benz arrived, Gabčík tried to shoot Heydrich, but his Sten gun jammed. Heydrich ordered his driver, SS-Oberscharführer Klein, to stop the car. As the car braked in front of him, Kubiš threw a modified anti-tank grenade (concealed in a briefcase) at the vehicle; he misjudged his throw. Instead of landing inside the car, it landed against the rear wheel. Nonetheless, the bomb severely wounded Heydrich when it detonated, its fragments ripping through the right rear fender and embedding shrapnel from the upholstery of the car into Heydrich, causing serious injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen and lung, as well as a fractured rib. Kubiš received a minor wound to his face from the shrapnel. As Kubiš staggered against the railings, Klein leapt out of the shattered limousine with a drawn pistol; Kubiš recovered and jumped on his bicycle and pedaled away, scattering passengers spilling from the tram, by firing in the air with his Colt M1903 pistol. Klein tried to shoot at him but dazed by the explosion, pressed the magazine release catch and the gun jammed. Heydrich died of his injuries on 4 June.

===Attempted capture of the parachutists===

Kubiš and his group were found on 18 June in the Church of St Cyril and St Methodius in Resslova Street in Prague. In a bloody battle that lasted for six hours, Kubiš was seriously wounded by a grenade and was found unconscious. He died of his wounds shortly after arrival at the hospital. Heinz Pannwitz, the German detective charged with capturing at least one of the perpetrators alive, later stated:

He had tried to use poison on himself but apparently lost consciousness before he could do so. Although he was immediately transferred to the hospital none of the doctors’ attempts to keep him alive succeeded. He died within twenty minutes.

The other parachutists committed suicide to avoid capture after an additional four-hour battle with the SS.

In revenge, the Nazis murdered 24 family members and close relatives of Jan Kubiš in the concentration camp, Mauthausen: his father, both full and half-siblings, including their wives and husbands, cousins, aunts and uncles.

==Recognition==
Shortly after his successful mission, Kubiš (as well as Gabčík) was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant &quot;&quot;. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia he was further promoted to the rank of staff captain &quot;in memoriam&quot;. During the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the assassination of Heydrich in 2002, Kubiš was again promoted &quot;in memoriam&quot;, to the rank of colonel.

Apart from the Czechoslovak Military Cross 1939 and Croix de Guerre (both he received in 1940), Kubiš was posthumously decorated with the Commemorative Medal of the Czechoslovak Army, F, GB (1944), another two Czechoslovak Military Crosses (1942, 1945), King&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct (1947), Czechoslovak Military Order for Liberty (1949), Military Order of the White Lion &quot;For Victory&quot; 1st Class (1968), Order of Milan Rastislav Štefánik (1992) and Cross of Defence of the Minister of Defence of the Czech Republic (2008).

There are streets named after Jan Kubiš in the cities of Prague (close to the Operation Anthropoid Memorial), Pardubice, Tábor, Třebíč and other places. In 2013 (100th anniversary of Kubiš&#x27;s birth) a small memorial and museum was open in the house where Jan Kubiš was born. Since 2010 a National memorial and museum dedicated to all heroes related to the assassination of Heydrich is open in the crypt of Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Prague.

Coinciding with the release of the film &quot;Anthropoid&quot;, campaigners called for Kubiš&#x27;s and Gabčík&#x27;s bodies to be identified and exhumed from the mass-grave at the Ďáblice Cemetery, Prague, and to be given a dignified burial fitting &quot;the heroes of anti-Nazi resistance&quot;.

A memorial stone for Jan Kubiš and Jozef Gabčík can be found in the grounds of St John the Baptist Church in Ightfield (ref W9VR+FJ Whitchurch) on Google Maps.

<text>Stephen Nicol (born 11 December 1961) is a Scottish retired professional footballer who mainly played as a right back and occasionally played in other positions across defence and midfield. He played for the successful Liverpool teams of the 1980s. He was also a regular member of the Scotland national team and represented his country at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

Nicol started his playing career with local club Ayr United, moving to Liverpool in 1981. He won five English league championships, three FA Cup winners medals, and the 1984 European Cup during 14 years with Liverpool. Nicol played for several other English teams after leaving Liverpool, including Notts County, Sheffield Wednesday and Doncaster Rovers, before emigrating to the United States in 1999. He was most recently coach of the New England Revolution and was the longest-tenured head coach in MLS to coach a single club. Nicol is now a commentator for ESPN FC.

==Club career==

===Ayr United===
Nicol began his career with Troon Thistle at age 9, then joined Ayr United at age 16, and started playing for the first team in 1979, where he spent just over two seasons with the Scottish side, racking up 70 league appearances, before Liverpool manager Bob Paisley decided to pay what turned out to be a bargain price, £300,000, to bring Nicol to Anfield on 26 October 1981.

===Liverpool===
Nicol, who was signed by Bob Paisley, had to wait almost an entire year to make his senior debut for Liverpool and two years for a regular first team place, arriving at the club halfway through a 20-year period of dominance.

He made his &quot;Reds&quot; debut on 31 August 1982 in a 0–0 league draw with Birmingham City at St Andrew&#x27;s and made a further three league appearances that season. The Reds finished as league champions for the 14th time, but Nicol did not make enough appearances to collect a title winner&#x27;s medal.

Nicol became a regular in the 1983–84 season under new boss Joe Fagan. He also scored his first goal for the club on 22 October 1983, in a 1–0 league victory over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. He went on to win a League championship medal by the end of his first full season, having not appeared enough times the previous season to qualify for a medal. However, he was not picked for the League Cup final victory over fierce Merseyside derby rivals Everton in the first-ever all-Merseyside final. He came on as a substitute for Craig Johnston in the European Cup final against Roma in the Stadio Olimpico, Rome. After a 1–1 draw, the match went to a penalty shootout. Nicol missed his spot-kick, but Roma failed to score two of their penalties and Liverpool won the competition.

Nicol became a first-team regular for many subsequent seasons, winning the league championship and FA Cup &quot;double&quot; in 1986 under the guidance of Kenny Dalglish, pipping Everton to the title by just two points and then beating them 3–1 in the first-ever all Merseyside FA Cup final. He was also settling into an international career, which would ultimately yield 27 caps and a place in the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, with Scotland. A versatile player, he played most often at right back following the departure of Phil Neal in 1985, though he also featured at left back, in the centre of defence and as a midfield player. He even played up front on a couple of occasions. He earned the nickname &#x27;Chopsy&#x27; because of how he pronounced the word &#x27;chips&#x27;.

In the 1987–88 season, he was in a good goal scoring form, despite playing in a position not naturally conducive to attacking. This form included a memorable hat-trick at Newcastle United and a phenomenal long-range header to win at Arsenal on the opening day of the season. Nicol&#x27;s defensive qualities were also much admired as Liverpool coasted to the league title, but missed out on another &quot;double&quot; when Wimbledon surprisingly beat them 1–0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Nicol was the last Liverpool player to have a chance to equalise and force extra-time, but his diving header in injury time flew narrowly over the crossbar.

A year later, Nicol played his part as Liverpool won the FA Cup against Everton, winning 3–2 after extra time, but lost the League title in a decider against Arsenal with virtually the last kick of the season. The campaign ended on a personal high for Nicol as he was named &quot;Footballer of the Year&quot; by football writers.

Nicol accompanied his teammates to many of the funerals and memorial services of the 96 fans who died at the Hillsborough disaster. Like many others in the Liverpool squad, Hillsborough was the second tragedy Nicol had witnessed. Four years earlier, just before the 1985 European Cup final at the Heysel Stadium, Brussels, Liverpool fans had charged a section of, mainly, Juventus supporters, causing a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people. As a result of the Heysel disaster, a five-year ban was placed on English clubs in European competitions, with Liverpool being banned for six years. Nicol would be one of the few players still with Liverpool when their ban from European competitions was finally lifted.

When Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 9–0 during the 1989–90 season to accumulate the club&#x27;s biggest-ever League victory, Nicol was the only player to score twice, getting the first and last goals of the game in the seventh and 90th minutes. Liverpool regained the league title that season – their last until 2019–20 – and, two years later, Nicol was in the team which, under Graeme Souness, won the FA Cup again in 1992, this time beating Sunderland 2–0.

He remained a regular player for Liverpool until the start of the 1994–95 season, when he was forced onto the sidelines with the arrival of new defenders Phil Babb and John Scales. His final appearance for the club was a League Cup tie against Burnley in October 1994.

In 13 years at Anfield, he had played a total of 343 league games and scored 36 goals. At the time of leaving, he was the club&#x27;s most senior player in terms of unbroken service. Although Ian Rush had joined the club more than a year before Nicol, Rush&#x27;s service had been disrupted by a year-long spell at Juventus.

===Notts County===
Nicol stayed at Liverpool until 20 January 1995 when he took on a player-assistant coach role at Notts County after being recruited by County&#x27;s former Everton manager Howard Kendall. He stayed at Meadow Lane for just 10 months, playing 32 times. After Kendall was sacked, Nicol received his first taste of management when he took charge of the club with two other players for the final months of the Magpies&#x27; disastrous 1994–95 campaign. But his efforts were not enough to save Notts County from relegation to Division Two.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Following the end of the season, Nicol next moved to Sheffield Wednesday in November 1995, where he made his debut against former derby rivals Everton at Goodison Park on 25 November in a game which ended in a 2–2 draw. However, probably Nicol&#x27;s best memory of his time at Hillsborough happened on 7 December 1996 when his Wednesday side traveled to his old stomping ground of Anfield. The Sheffield side completely nullified the Liverpool attack, which contained the likes of Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman and John Barnes, and came away with a 1–0 victory with Nicol playing a major part in the Wednesday defence.

===English lower divisions, move to America===
Nicol went on to make 49 league appearances before spending a spell on loan at West Bromwich Albion during the 1997–98 season where he played nine games. He then had a short spell with Doncaster Rovers before heading to the U.S. to take a player-coach position with the Boston Bulldogs of the A-League in 1999.

In September of that year, he took over as interim player-coach (he did not make any playing appearances) with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer for the final two games of the season, winning both. He returned to the Boston Bulldogs as player-coach for the 2000 and 2001 seasons before re-joining the Revs in 2002 as an assistant coach.

==International career==
Nicol was first capped at the senior level for Scotland on 12 September 1984, soon after becoming a first team regular for Liverpool. Jock Stein gave Nicol his international debut in a friendly with Yugoslavia. His debut was a memorable one, as he helped Scotland beat Yugoslavia 6–1 in a friendly at Hampden Park in front of a crowd of 18,512. Helping Nicol settle in with the national team were club mates Kenny Dalglish and captain Graeme Souness, who both scored. The last of his 27 full caps for Scotland came on 11 September 1991 in a 2–2 draw in Switzerland during the Euro 92 qualifiers. He was in Scotland&#x27;s squad for the 1986 World Cup.

==Coaching career==

Nicol&#x27;s began his coaching career at Notts County F.C. as an assistant-coach / player for Howard Kendall. Following Kendall&#x27;s dismissal, Nicol took over as club manager on an interim basis. He returned to playing following the appointment of former Shelbourne F.C. boss Colin Murphy.

In 1999, Nicol moved to the United States to play for the Boston Bulldogs, and became player-manager following the departure of John Kerr.

===New England Revolution===

On 30 September 1999, Nicol took over interim coaching duties for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer following the dismissal of then-player-coach Walter Zenga. 

At the conclusion of the 1999 season, Nicol returned to the Boston Bulldogs, but would rejoin the Revolution as an assistant to Fernando Clavijo on 10 January 2002. On 23 May 2002, Nicol was again named interim manager, this time following Clavijo&#x27;s dismissal.

In his first year as head coach, Nicol lead the Revolution to its first-ever MLS Cup final and was subsequently named MLS Coach of the Year. He was officially named head coach of the Revolution on 6 November 2002. 

Nicol would go on to become one of the most successful coaches in MLS history, and the most successful manager in Revolution history, bringing a period of &quot;sustained excellence&quot; to the club during his MLS-record ten year tenure as head coach.

Under Nicol&#x27;s leadership, the Revolution advanced to the MLS Eastern Conference Finals every year until 2008 and returned to the MLS Cup final in 2005, 2006 and 2007, making the playoffs every year over a seven-season stretch. He was a finalist for MLS Coach of the Year in 2005, but lost to Dominic Kinnear.

In 2007, Nicol also delivered the first silverware in Revolution history, winning the U.S. Open cup final over FC Dallas. The following season Nicol guided the Revolution to their first-ever international trophy, as they won the 2008 North American SuperLiga over Houston Dynamo FC. 

While coaching the Revolution, Nicol was selected to represent Major League Soccer on multiple occasions as well. On 11 August 2005, MLS announced Nicol as
coach of the &quot;MLS Select Team&quot; to face Real Madrid CF on
August 23 in Spain. The league also selected Nicol to coach the MLS All-Stars on two occasions, in 2007 vs. Celtic F.C., and in 2008 vs. West Ham United F.C.

In 2010, Nicol guided the Revolution back to the SuperLiga final, where the club lost to Atlético Morelia. The Revolution also failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time under Nicol&#x27;s tenure in 2010, and would again miss the playoffs during the 2011 season. On 24 October 2011, Nicol and the Revolution mutually decided to part ways, ending his 10-season tenure. Nicol departed the Revolution as the club&#x27;s longest tenured manager, leading the club in games coached, wins, and playoff appearances.

On November 4, 2012, Nicol was inducted into the New England Soccer Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1218825" wikidata="Q1537372" url="?curid=1218825" title="Yoshiki Okamoto">
<text>, sometimes credited as Kihaji Okamoto, is a Japanese video game designer. He is credited with producing popular titles for Konami, including &quot;Gyruss&quot; and &quot;Time Pilot&quot;, and for Capcom, including &quot;1942&quot;, &quot;Gun.Smoke&quot;, &quot;Final Fight&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. He later founded the companies Flagship and Game Republic, and then created the hit mobile games &quot;Dragon Hunter&quot; and &quot;Monster Strike&quot; for Mixi. He also played a role in the creation of Rockstar&#x27;s &quot;Red Dead&quot; franchise. Several franchises he helped create are among the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time, including &quot;Street Fighter,&quot; &quot;Monster Strike&quot; and &quot;Red Dead&quot;.

==History==
===Early career at Konami===
His early games &quot;Time Pilot&quot; (1982) and &quot;Gyruss&quot; (1983) innovated in the shoot &#x27;em up genre during the golden age of arcade games. The Killer List of Videogames included both &quot;Gyruss&quot; and &quot;Time Pilot&quot; in its list of top 100 arcade games of all time. Although these games turned out to be successful titles for Konami, Okamoto&#x27;s employer was not happy as apparently Okamoto had been told to create a driving game instead. Internal disagreements, financial and credible, caused his termination from Konami.

===Career at Capcom===
Joining Capcom in 1984, Okamoto directed several arcade games such as &quot;1942&quot; (1984), &quot;SonSon&quot; (1984), and &quot;Side Arms&quot; (1986). His 1985 shoot &#x27;em up &quot;Gun.Smoke&quot; later inspired a spiritual successor, &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot;, the first installment of the &quot;Red Dead&quot; series.

The last game he directed was the 1989 CP System game &quot;Willow&quot; (1989). He would oversee the development of Capcom″s subsequent games as a producer and was responsible for recruiting character designer Akira Yasuda for Capcom. Okamoto and Yasuda developed some of Capcom&#x27;s biggest hits, most notably the beat &#x27;em up game &quot;Final Fight&quot; (1989) and fighting game &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991). &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; is estimated to have grossed as of 2017, making it the third highest-grossing video game of all time, after &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man&quot;.

Okamoto worked on the 1996 survival horror game &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (&quot;Biohazard&quot; in Japan). Additionally, he produced the movie adaptation and its sequel.

In 1997, he resigned from Capcom to start his own video game development company, Flagship. He continued to develop video games for Capcom through Flagship.

Okamoto approached Angel Studios with the idea for an original intellectual property entitled &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; It later adopted a Western theme at Okamoto&#x27;s recommendation, redefining the acronym as &quot;Spaghetti Western Action Team&quot;. It was intended to be a spiritual successor to &quot;Gun.Smoke&quot;. Angel Studios began work on the game with Capcom&#x27;s oversight and funding in 2000, and Capcom announced the game as &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot; in March 2002. Okamoto then left Capcom, which canceled the game in August 2003. Rockstar Games acquired the rights to &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot; in December 2003 and resumed development, releasing it for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in May 2004.

In 2003, he left Flagship to form another video game company.

===Game Republic===
In 2005, Okamoto&#x27;s new independent game company, Game Republic, released its first game &quot;&quot;. &quot;Genji&quot; is a game set in Feudal Japan with a similar playing style to the &quot;Onimusha&quot; series. A sequel, &quot;&quot;, was released on the PlayStation 3 in late 2006. A new Game Republic game called &quot;Folklore&quot; (&quot;Folkssoul&quot; in Japan) was released in 2007.

Okamoto also developed a typical party game called &quot;Every Party&quot;, which was a launch title for the Xbox 360 in Japan.

In 2007, Game Republic signed with Brash Entertainment and started working on licensed games like &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;. But then in November 2008, Brash Entertainment went out of business, and Game Republic had to turn to Namco Bandai for the release of &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;.

In 2011, Game Republic also shut down due to debt, and a year later, Okamoto announced that he had retired from making console games and started working on mobile games.

===Mixi===
In recent years, he created the mobile games &quot;Dragon Hunter&quot; and &quot;Monster Strike&quot; (2013) for Mixi. &quot;Dragon Hunter&quot; was a moderate success, before &quot;Monster Strike&quot; became a major hit, competing with &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot; for the top spot on mobile charts. By 2018, &quot;Monster Strike&quot; had grossed over $7.2 billion, surpassing &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot; to become the highest-grossing mobile app of all time.

===Later years===
Okamoto became the chairman of the Japan Game Culture Foundation in November 2017, an organization which seeks to support young game creators. In 2018 he made the Malaysian game development company Okakichi. In November 2022 he was appointed as &quot;game advisor&quot; for the Whole Earth Foundation, a Japanese organization seeking to raise infrastructure maintenance awareness through a cryptocurrency smartphone game.

Since 2020 he has also made three YouTube channels which he uses to discuss various topics. His &quot;YoshikiOkamotoGameCh&quot; channel in particular looks back at his life as a video game designer for over 40 years, discussing experiences with past games he was involved in, his opinion on other games, and interviews with individuals related to game development. He also used this channel to announce his planned retirement in June 2027.

==Influences and style==
Okamoto has said that he gets ideas from scenery from movies, citing particularly the works of Akira Kurosawa and Chinese ghost stories. He commented that &quot;We don&#x27;t make games for ourselves - I don&#x27;t actually play games very much.&quot;

<text>Roswell &quot;Bob&quot; Garst (June 13, 1898 – November 4, 1977) was an American farmer and seed company executive. He developed hybrid corn seed in 1930 that allowed greater crop yields than open-pollinated corn. He was perhaps most well known for hosting Nikita Khrushchev on his farm in Coon Rapids, Iowa, on September 23, 1959. He sold hybrid seed to the Soviet Union beginning in 1955 and played a role in improving United States-Soviet communication.

==Biography==
Roswell Garst&#x27;s parents were Edward Garst and Bertha Goodwin. He married Elizabeth Henak on January 31, 1921. Garst was founder of Garst &amp; Thomas Co., which became one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of hybrid seed corn. In the 1930s, Garst traveled around the Midwest convincing farmers of the benefits of hybrid seed corn. As an international agriculturalist, he encouraged modern farming methods to improve food production in many nations, including the Soviet Union, Chile, Hungary, Germany, and France. Garst was famous for offering (sometimes unsolicited) advice. When Khrushchev visited Coon Rapids, Garst could not help but discuss the US-Soviet political situation, and told Khrushchev, &quot;You know, for a peasant, you&#x27;re a damned poor horse trader.&quot; Khrushchev apparently liked Garst enough after his previous visits to the Soviet Union to demand that Garst&#x27;s farm be included on his 1959 tour of the United States, where he famously stated that Iowan corn was superior to Ukrainian corn. Garst made six trips to the Soviet Union to teach about hybrid seed and farm mechanization. He also sent his sons, including David Garst, on similar trips. Garst, in his own view, was not only an agriculturalist, but also a goodwill ambassador promoting peace during the Cold War.

Roswell Garst was diagnosed with cancer of the voice box in 1963. He died in 1977.

==Farm==
Since Garst&#x27;s death, his farmstead has been preserved; in 2009, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places under the title of &quot;Roswell and Elizabeth Garst Farmstead Historic District.&quot; The farm was seen as historically significant because of its importance in general American history and because of its place as Garst&#x27;s home.

<doc id="1218828" wikidata="Q448009" url="?curid=1218828" title="Jim Telfer">
<text>James Telfer (born 17 March 1940) is a Scottish former rugby union coach and player. As a player, he won 21 international caps in the amateur era, also having a career as a headmaster at Hawick High School and Galashiels Academy and Forrester High School as a chemistry teacher. With Sir Ian McGeechan he had success with both the Scotland national team and the British Lions.

==Playing career==
Telfer played for Melrose RFC and was still a student when he was first selected for international duties. He later worked as a chemistry teacher. His first cap came against France at Murrayfield on 4 January 1964. His last match for Scotland was on 28 February 1970 at Lansdowne Road against Ireland.

Telfer gained twenty one caps for Scotland, and, but for injury, might have gained more. Allan Massie wrote of him:

:&quot;Telfer is a man of innate authority. (There&#x27;s a wealth of quiet reserve and self-knowledge, touched by that form of self-mockery which appears as under-statement, in the way he will describe himself as being a &#x27;dominant personality&#x27;)&quot;

Telfer played back row for Scotland and for the British Lions in 1966 and 1968. He was impressed and heavily influenced by New Zealand rugby. After a cartilage operation he slowed up. He played 23 games for the British Lions on their 1966 tour to Australia and New Zealand and 11 games on their 1968 tour to South Africa.

Between 1963 and 1967, he played 8 times for the Barbarians, scoring six points.

George Crerar said of him &quot;The great thing about Jim Telfer is that he makes sure that if he isn&#x27;t going to win the ball the other side won&#x27;t get it either.&quot;&quot;

==Coaching career==
Telfer was head coach to the British Lions on their tour of New Zealand in 1983. He was assistant coach, with particular responsibility for the forwards, on the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa, where he made his well-known motivational &#x27;Everest&#x27; speech to the forwards before the 1st Test.

Telfer coached Scotland to the Grand Slam in 1984 and, as assistant to Ian McGeechan, to his second Grand Slam in 1990. In his third term as head coach from 1998 to 1999, Scotland won the final Five Nations Championship.

In 2014 he was coaching the Melrose RFC Under-18 team – Melrose Wasps.

Telfer has been open about copying some New Zealand approaches to the game.

<doc id="1218832" wikidata="Q39086034" url="?curid=1218832" title="Coastwise slave trade">
<text>The coastwise slave trade existed along the southern and eastern coastal areas of the United States in the antebellum years prior to 1861. Hundreds of vessels of various capacities domestically traded loads of slaves along waterways, generally from the Upper South which had a surplus of slaves to the Deep South where new cotton plantations created high demand for labor. 

International tensions developed when ships were forced by weather or incident into ports in Bermuda and the British West Indies, as the British freed the slaves as part of the banned trade on the high seas, even before its abolition of slavery in its territories in 1834. There were several cases: &quot;Comet&quot; (1830), &quot;Encomium&quot; (1833), &quot;Enterprise&quot; (1835), &quot;Hermosa&quot; (1840), and, most notably, the &quot;Creole&quot; case of 1841, the result of a ship slave revolt that forced the vessel into Nassau, Bahamas. British officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the Bahamas.

==Legal rights==
Prior to 1807, the 1787 United States Constitution and the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act were the only national United States laws on slavery. Individual states had enacted laws authorizing and regulating slavery within their boundaries.

The multi-faceted 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves abolished the &quot;importation of slaves&quot; from Africa, effective in 1808. The United States and Great Britain patrolled to create an international Blockade of Africa, trying to suppress the slave trade. In addition, American and British ships patrolled the Caribbean, where illegal slaves were generally brought for sale to the sugar plantations and smuggling into the United States. 

The 1807 Act also regulated the United States&#x27; &quot;coastwise slave trade&quot;; it protected shipping by domestic slave traders between markets along the other slave trading coasts. Attorneys argued that ships at sea were an extension of United States sovereignty, which permitted domestic slave trade among the states.

==Conflict between the United States and Britain in the Caribbean==
Complications developed between the United States and Great Britain from their differing interpretations of the application of laws against the slave trade in the Caribbean colonies. When American merchant ships were forced by weather or incident into ports in Bermuda and the British West Indies, the British freed the slaves as part of the banned trade on the high seas, even before its abolition of slavery in its territories in 1834. As early as 1825, the Home Office in London had ruled that &quot;any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the British West Indies would be manumitted, which led to 300 slaves owned by U.S. nationals being freed.&quot; In addition, slaves who escaped to the Bahamas from Florida became free.

Several cases occurred as anti-slavery agitation increased and abolition was passed: &quot;Comet&quot; (1830), &quot;Encomium&quot; (1833), &quot;Enterprise&quot; (1835), and &quot;Hermosa&quot; (1840) In each case, the British freed the slaves from the ships that had put into ports in Bermuda and the Bahamas, whether by weather or accident. 

The most notable case was the 1841 &quot;Creole&quot;, the result of a ship slave revolt that forced the vessel into Nassau, Bahamas. One of the slave leaders had heard of slaves being freed from the &quot;Hermosa&quot; there the previous year.

Holding that the slaves were free persons illegally detained in slavery, British officials ultimately freed the 128 of 135 slaves from the &quot;Creole&quot; who chose to stay in the Bahamas. It has been termed the &quot;most successful slave revolt in U.S. history&quot;. The US slaveholders feared this would encourage other slave ship revolts.

==Selected list of laws and court rulings==
The following are generally considered the most important United States statutory laws and case laws on slavery, in the order of their enactment:
:1787: United States Constitution
:1793: Fugitive Slave Act
:1807: Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves
:1841: &quot;United States v. The Amistad&quot;
:1850: Fugitive Slave Act
:1857: &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;
:1865: 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution

==Cabotage==
The act of sailing along a coast and using landmarks for guidance is called &quot;cabotage&quot;, from the French word &quot;caboter&quot; (&quot;to coast,&quot; &quot;go from cape to cape&quot;). When slaves were the merchandise being transported by &quot;cabotage&quot;, the practice was called the &quot;coastwise slave trade&quot;.

<doc id="1218837" wikidata="Q3480093" url="?curid=1218837" title="Correctional Service of Canada">
<text>The Correctional Service of Canada (CSC; ), also known as Correctional Service Canada or Corrections Canada, is the Canadian federal government agency responsible for the incarceration and rehabilitation of convicted criminal offenders sentenced to two years or more. The agency has its headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario.

The CSC officially came into being on April 10, 1979, when Queen Elizabeth II signed authorization for the newly commissioned agency and presented it with its armorial bearings.

The Commissioner of the CSC is recommended for appointment by the Prime Minister and approved by an Order in Council. This appointed position reports directly to the Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs and is accountable to the public via the Parliament. The current Commissioner of the CSC is Anne Kelly, who served as the senior deputy commissioner prior to the retirement of Don Head in February 2018.

==Insignia==
In addition to using generic identifiers imposed by the Federal Identity Program, CSC is one of several federal departments (primarily those involved with law enforcement, security, or having a regulatory function) that has been granted heraldic symbols. The badge (described below) was officially granted by the Canadian Heraldic Authority on October 15, 2009. The torch symbolizes learning, knowledge and hope, while the key represents the eventual unlocking of the door upon completion of a prison sentence. The motto means &quot;to grasp the future&quot;. The CSC was granted a flag in 2009; it consists of the heraldic badge on a white field, with the Canadian flag in the canton. Senior officials have also been granted distinctive badges by the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

==History and development==

===Early years===
Following the development of the penitentiary by the Philadelphia Quakers in the 1780s, the concept of penitence—isolation, work and religious contemplation—influenced the design and operation of prisons, not only in North America, but also in Europe, South America and Asia. The &quot;Auburn system&quot; developed at the Auburn Penitentiary in New York adopted the penitentiary sentence of the Philadelphia model, but added prisoners&#x27; labour, in the belief that work and training would assist in reforming criminals. The Kingston Penitentiary, based on the Auburn System, was built in 1835. Initially operated as a provincial jail, the penitentiary came under federal jurisdiction following the passage of the British North America Act in 1867. 

In 1868, the first Penitentiary Act brought prisons in Saint John, New Brunswick and Halifax, along with Kingston, under federal jurisdiction. Over the next twelve years, the federal government built Saint-Vincent-de-Paul Penitentiary in Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec (1873), Manitoba Penitentiary, in Stoney Mountain, Manitoba (1877), British Columbia Penitentiary, in New Westminster, British Columbia (1878) and Dorchester Penitentiary, in Dorchester, New Brunswick (1880). In 1906 the Alberta Penitentiary was opened in Edmonton, and the Saskatchewan Penitentiary was opened in Prince Albert in 1911. Buildings for these latter two facilities were constructed by forced labour performed by prisoners.

The regime of these prisons included productive labour during the day, solitary confinement during leisure hours and the rule of silence at all times. While there was no parole, prisoners with good conduct could have three days per month remitted from their sentence.

===Reformation and rehabilitation===
The Royal Commission to Investigate the Penal System of Canada (the Archambault Commission) was formed in response to a series of riots and strikes in the 1930s. The Archambault report, published in 1938, proposed sweeping changes for Canadian penitentiaries, with emphasis on crime prevention and the rehabilitation of prisoners. The Commission recommended a complete revision of penitentiary regulations to provide &quot;strict but humane discipline and the reformation and rehabilitation of prisoners.&quot; While the commission&#x27;s recommendations were not immediately implemented due to the advent of World War II, much of the report&#x27;s philosophy remains influential.

After the Second World War, prison populations dropped, causing undercrowding and prison disturbances. This led to the creation of the Fauteaux Committee in 1953. The Committee saw prisons not merely as fulfilling a custodial role, but also to provide programs that would promote &quot;worthwhile and creative activity&quot; and address the basic behaviour, attitudes and patterns of inmates. This meant prisons had to change to support such programs and provide opportunities for vocational training, pre-release and after-care programs. The Fauteux Report recommended hiring more, and better-trained, personnel, including those with professional qualifications in social work, psychology, psychiatry, criminology and law. An important legacy of the Committee was the creation of the National Parole Board in 1959 and the development of a system of parole to replace the former ticket of leave system. While stating that parole was not to be a reduction, or undermining, of the sentence, the committee emphasized its strong support for parole: 
Parole is a well-recognized procedure which is designed to be a logical step in the reformation and rehabilitation of a person who has been convicted of an offence and, as a result, is undergoing imprisonment... It is a transitional step between close confinement in an institution and absolute freedom in society (Fauteux 1956, 51).&#x27;&quot;

The Penitentiary Act was amended in 1961 and a plan enacted to build ten new penitentiaries across Canada to implement the Fauteaux Committee&#x27;s recommendations.

===Commissioning of the CSC===
In the 1970s, there was a movement to combine the then Penitentiary Service and the National Parole Service. This resulted in a Report to Parliament by the Sub-Committee on the Penitentiary System in Canada, chaired by Mark MacGuigan. The move toward consolidation was recognized by Commissioner Donald Yeomans, who referred to &quot;...our efforts to come up with a title for our Service which will give us a proper identity and project the image of the merger of the Penitentiary Service and the National Parole Service.&quot; and announced that the name would be &quot;The Correctional Service of Canada.&quot; (Yeomans, April 5, 1979). The Correctional Service of Canada was established in 1979, following the merger of the Canadian Penitentiary Service and the National Parole Service, in 1976.

Carl Lochnan, an expert in the field of Heraldry, who developed the Order of Canada, was contracted to develop the new Coat of Arms for the Commissioning of the Correctional Service of Canada. Lochnan filed a research document that stated in part the background philosophy on the given development:

On December 21, 1978, Commissioner Donald R. Yeomans approved the chosen design. In early 1979, the Coat-of-Arms was forwarded by Solicitor General Jean-Jacques Blais to the Governor General requesting the Queen&#x27;s approval (Blais, March 29, 1979). On April 10, Queen Elizabeth II gave Royal Assent and authorization of the new Coat-of-Arms (Joly de Lotbiniere, April 20, 1979).

* Anne Kelly (2018–present)

==Legislative jurisdiction==
The operation of the CSC is governed by federal statute under the &quot;Corrections and Conditional Release Act&quot; and &quot;Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations&quot;. In addition, the statute provides for discretion under the directive of the Commissioner. However, all Commissioner&#x27;s Directives must remain within the parameters of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the &quot;Corrections and Conditional Release Act&quot;.

Correctional Service Canada only has jurisdiction over offenders in Canada for court-imposed sentences 24 months (two years) or greater.

==Court-imposed sentencing==
There are two types of court-imposed sentences:
# a determinate sentence;
# an indeterminate sentence.

A determinate sentence is a sentence with a completion date (example five years, seven months), called a &quot;Warrant Expiry&quot;. This date is court imposed, at which time Correctional Service Canada no longer has jurisdiction over the offender.

An indeterminate sentence is a sentence that is commonly referred to as a &quot;life sentence&quot;. Correctional Service Canada has jurisdiction over the offender until the offender passes away. Although the court does impose a minimum number of years before the offender can apply to the Parole Board of Canada for conditional release. Thus, a court-imposed sentence of life with no parole for twenty-five years would indicate that the offender would be incarcerated for a minimum of twenty five years prior to consideration for a potential conditional release to the community, under the supervision of a community parole officer.

As of 2006 the incarceration rate in Canada was 107 per 100,000 people; one seventh that of the United States&#x27;.

==Security classification of offenders==

There are three levels of security within Correctional Service Canada. They include maximum, medium, and minimum. Case management is completed by institutional parole officers (POs) within institutions, and by community parole officers in the community. The Parole Board of Canada has the complete responsibility in making liberty decisions at the point in the court-imposed sentence where an offender is allowed to live in the community on conditional release.

Once an offender is sentenced by a court to a sentence of two (2) years or more the offender comes under the jurisdiction of Correctional Service Canada. An institutional parole officer completes a comprehensive assessment of the offender&#x27;s criminality and formulates an &quot;offender security classification report&quot; and a &quot;correctional plan&quot;. It is this correctional plan that the offender will be assessed against for the entire court-imposed sentence. 

Preparing offenders for their return to the community is an important focus for the Correctional Services of Canada. This preparation has become more difficult in recent years due to over crowding prisons and cutbacks in rehabilitative services of offenders. Parole officers who monitor these offenders are now stretched thin making these officers do more with less to work with. With this being such a big issue, the Correctional services of Canada developed the Integrated Police-Parole Initiative (IPPI). Also known as the Community Correctional Liaison Officer (CCLO) program. The IPPI received funding to begin operations in 16 locations across Canada in 2006-2007. This program places police officers in Correctional Services of Canada offices, where they support the activities of the parole staff. The officers specifically work with high-risk offenders in their transition to the community to try an increase public safety. High-risk, ex-prisoners face numerous challenges in re-entering their community, both personal and bureaucratic or legal. Many return to the neighborhood where they committed the crime, and deal with temptations of gang-life, criminal associates and substance abuse. With this, there should be no surprise that studies have shown that over two-thirds of offenders are rearrested within three years of release. These stats are what pushed the IPPI program to pay special attention to parolees with the highest level of risk; in the first months following release; and returning to locations with the highest levels of criminality. IPPI realized that there needed to be a different approach and make the parole officers more involved on a face-to-face basis which resulted in a more successful transition to the real world for ex-prisoners.

==Employees==
Most personnel are plain clothed including, Parole Officers, Program Facilitators, Psychologists, Staff Training Officers, Assessment and Intervention Managers, Security Intelligence Officers, Assistant/Deputy Wardens, and the Institutional Head, called the &quot;Warden&quot;. Each Region of Canada has a &quot;Regional Deputy Commissioner&quot; who reports directly to the Commissioner of Correctional Service Canada, who is based in the National Capital Region (Ottawa, Ontario).

Employees working at federal penitentiaries are designated as federal Peace Officers under Section 10 of the &quot;Corrections and Conditional Release Act&quot;.

===Uniformed Correctional Officers===
A Correctional Officer is an employee of the Public Service of Canada. All CSC Correctional Officers are uniformed and are designated as federal Peace Officers under Section 10 of the &quot;Corrections and Conditional Release Act&quot;.

The rank structure in CSC begins at entry as a Correctional Officer 1 (CX-01), also known as COI. These officers are responsible for security functions at the institution including patrols, security posts, first response, and escorts.

A Correctional Officer 2 (CX-02), or COII, is typically assigned to positions requiring a more experienced officer that works various posts including living units, communications, or visits. Correctional Officers who are specifically designated for Federally Sentenced Women (FSW) are called Primary Workers and have an entry rank of COII. A COII is not in any way a supervisory role to a COI, but are used to coordinate officers within their sector.

Once officers move into a supervisory role, which starts at Staff Training Officer (CX-03, formerly Correctional Supervisor), the uniform shirt colour is changed from navy blue to light blue.

The Correctional Manager (CX-04), or CM, is the Institutional Supervisor, and historically had been referred to as the &quot;Keeper of the Keys&quot;, or in short the &quot;Keeper&quot;.

All rank insignia is worn as shoulder epaulets attached to the shoulder straps of the uniform as either the word &quot;RECRUIT&quot; for officer recruits currently in training, or as 1, 2, 3, or 4 gold bars.

Within CSC, dress uniforms are available to staff member outside of the correctional officer ranks. Senior rank (worn as epaulets and typically only present on dress uniforms) are as follows:

*&quot;Commissioner&quot;: Crown, above a crossed key and torch, with four towers displayed below.
*&quot;Senior Deputy Commissioner&quot;: Crown, above a crossed key and torch, with three towers displayed below.
*&quot;Assistant Commissioner&quot;: Same as above, but with two towers.
*&quot;Regional Deputy Commissioner&quot;: Same as above, with one tower.

Uniformed Correctional Officers in the ranks of Correctional Officer 1, Correctional Officer 2, and Staff Training Officer are unionized and as such are members of the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers (UCCO).

Dress uniforms echo the same rank as displayed above. Each institution has a Ceremonial Unit that represent the Service at formal events across Canada and internationally. Examples of such events include local and ceremonial parades, funerals, recruit graduations, and national and international commemoration services.

The Ceremonial Unit consists of a Guard of Honour, the CSC Community Pipes and Drums Band and a Ceremonial Guard. Through their activities, the Unit is a proud public face for the Service&#x27;s Correctional Officers, Parole Officers, and other staff, who play an important role in keeping communities safe for Canadians.

Ceremonial rank structure is as follows, typically worn as epaulets on the dress uniform shirt and tunic.

*&quot;National Ceremonial Commander&quot;: Three stars (pips) centered with crossed key and torch.
*&quot;National Command Sergeant-Major&quot;: Rank positioned on the right sleeve depicting the Royal Crown above a crossed key and torch, and encircled by a laurel wreath. A crimson shoulder sash to be worn under the right shoulder strap of the tunic and across to the left hip.
*&quot;Regional Ceremonial Commander&quot;: Three pips.
*&quot;Regional Sergeant-Major&quot;: Rank positioned on the right sleeve depicting the Tudor Crown, a crossed key and torch, encircled by a laurel wreath. Crimson sash worn over the right shoulder and positioned under the right epaulet and right tunic lapel.
*&quot;Institutional Squad Leader&quot;: Two pips.
*&quot;Institutional Squad (2 i/c)&quot;: One pip.

==Prison Labour and Employment Programs==
In its early years, the Canadian penitentiary system used prison labour as a form of punishment that doubled as an essential element to the operation of the penitentiary itself. Furthermore, the prison industry was seen as punishment &quot;meant to reform the misguided.&quot; Nearly a hundred years later, the industry was deemed as an key component in the &quot;rehabilitative process,&quot; a value which was progressively gaining importance for CSC. By the 1950s the focus on prison labour shifted away from its role as a form of punishment and transitioned towards this being a integral part of offenders&#x27; rehabilitation, and thus increases public safety. 

In 1980, CSC launched CORCAN, an employment program for prisoners designed to rehabilitate inmates by offering them work skills that they can use to find employment after they are released, thus decreasing their likelihood of recidivism. CORCAN operates through partnerships with public, private and non-profit firms, which provide work to inmates in industries such as manufacturing, textiles, construction and services for which they are remunerated. 

In 2013, the Harper government implemented a series of room and board fees amounting to a 30% cut in pay for inmates enrolled in the CORCAN program. 

The CORCAN program has been criticized for offering few meaningful work and training opportunities, as many of the jobs available to inmates are in industries with little relevance to current labour market needs, such as laundry, textiles and manufacturing. This is particularly true of women prisoners, who are given gendered work that gives them few marketable skills in the labour market once released. Many Black prisoners have reported experiencing discrimination during the employment process for CORCAN jobs, and Black prisoners are more likely to receive lower pay for the work they perform.

==Citizens&#x27; Advisory Committees==
Under section 7 of the &quot;Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations&quot; and further by Commissioner&#x27;s Directives CD 023, each institution and parole office must establish a Citizens&#x27; Advisory Committee (CAC) who are mandated to &quot;contribute to the public safety by actively interacting with staff of the Correctional Service of Canada, the public and offenders, providing impartial advice and recommendations, thereby contributing to the quality of the correctional process.&quot;

Each institution and parole office forms the &#x27;local committee&#x27; for which the CSC consult with on matters regarding correctional operations, programs, policies, and plans. They in turn participate in the regional committee (Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairies and Pacific) to coordinate initiatives for the region. Finally, the National Executive Committee is made up of the five CAC Regional Chairpersons as well as by the National Chairperson, who are responsible for liaison between the committees and the CSC HQ, monitor and review all policies or actions of the CSC at the local, regional and national levels and adopt cohesive strategy for all committees.

All CAC members have, by law, the authority to have reasonable access to every part of the institution or parole office they are attached to, talk with all the staff and offenders or parolee within the organization and access to hearings (if the offender consents). These authorities are given to members once they have their applications approved and security clearances approved by CSC National Headquarters.

==Criticism and controversy==
In 2003, the CSC was criticized for its policies for reportedly releasing certain prisoners on a system. Scott Newark, a former prosecutor and executive director of the Canadian Police Association, who is now special counsel to the Ontario Attorney General&#x27;s Office for Victims of Crime, stated that the Correctional Service of Canada is out of control and that &quot;I think Canadians have good reason to be outraged.&quot;

Newark stated that there is a big push in Correctional Services to get more offenders out of penitentiaries and onto the street in what is called &quot;The Reintegration Project&quot;. Although this policy is cheaper than keeping convicts imprisoned, Newark&#x27;s office contends convicts are being shoved out the door to meet a release quota. Newark stated that he had obtained documents to prove this, including memos, minutes, and confidential Corrections correspondence, and an internal memorandum talk about setting a &quot;goal of a 50/50 split of offenders between institutions and the community&quot;.

Lawrence MacAulay, who was the Solicitor General in charge of the CSC when the documents were written, denied that there were any quotas, stating that: &quot;There are no quotas. There never was ... If anybody has the idea of a quota, they forgot to check with the minister.&quot; However, shortly after this interview, MacAulay resigned and Wayne Easter took over as solicitor general.

An internal Corrections audit reported that parole officers are overwhelmed. A senior union official said some parole officers, especially in cities, have caseloads of 40 or more instead of the recommended 18, and as a result, they are unable to do all of the crucial collateral checks in the community, such as talking to employers, landlords, neighbours and other family members.

Police officers have also complained that when parole violators are apprehended, they are often immediately re-released back on parole. Officer Greg Sullivan, who is part of a team that tracks down parole violators, criticized the CSC, stating that &quot;It gets really frustrating especially when you see violent offenders who are out several times over and we&#x27;ve gone after them two and three times in an eight-month period.&quot;

<text>A chantry is an ecclesiastical term that may have either of two related meanings:
# a chantry [[Church service|service]], a set of Christian liturgical celebrations for the dead (made up of the Requiem Mass and the Office of the Dead), or
# a chantry [[chapel]], a building on private land, or an area in a parish church or cathedral reserved for the performance of these celebrations. 

In the Medieval Era through to the Age of Enlightenment it was commonly believed such liturgies might help atone for misdeeds and assist the soul to obtain eternal peace.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;chantry&quot; derives from Old French &quot;chanter&quot; and from the Latin &quot;cantare&quot; (to sing). Its medieval derivative &quot;cantaria&quot; means &quot;licence to sing mass&quot;. The French term for this commemorative institution is &quot;chapellenie&quot; (chaplaincy).

==Overview==
===Liturgy for the dead===
Firstly, a chantry could mean the prayers and liturgy in the Christian church for the benefit of the dead, as part of the search for atonement for sins committed during their lives. It might include the mass and by extension, the endowment left for the purpose of the continuance of prayers and liturgy.

It could be called a type of &quot;trust fund&quot; established during the pre-Reformation medieval era in England for the purpose of employing one or more priests to sing a stipulated number of services for the benefit of the soul of a specified deceased person, usually the donor who had established the chantry in his will. There could be a stipulated period of time immediately following her/his death.

It was believed such masses might help atone for misdeeds and with mercy enable the soul to be granted eternal peace in the presence of God. Chantries were commonly established in England and were endowed with lands, rents from specified properties, and other assets of the donor, usually in his will. The income from these assets maintained the &quot;chantry&quot; priest.

===Privately built chapels===
Secondly, a chantry chapel is a building on private land or a dedicated area or altar within a parish church or cathedral, set aside or built especially for the performance of the &quot;chantry duties&quot; by the priest. A chantry may occupy a single altar, for example in the side aisle of a church, or an enclosed chapel within a larger church, generally dedicated to the donor&#x27;s favourite saint.

Many chantry altars became richly endowed, often with gold furnishings and valuable vestments. Over the centuries, chantries increased in embellishments, often by attracting new donors and chantry priests. Those feoffees who could afford to employ them in many cases enjoyed great wealth. Sometimes this led to corruption of the consecrated life expected of clergymen. It also led in general to an accumulation of great wealth and power in the Church, beyond the feudal control of the Crown. This evident amassing of assets was one of the pretexts used by King Henry VIII to order the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England.

At the time of the Dissolution, chantries were abolished and their assets were sold or granted to persons at the discretion of Henry and his son King Edward VI, via the Court of Augmentations. Many Tudor businessmen, such as Thomas Bell (1486–1566) of Gloucester, acquired chantries as financial investments for the afterlife, but yielding income streams in the here and now, derived from chantry rents; or the chantry assets could be &quot;unbundled&quot; and sold on piecemeal at a profit.

A surviving free-standing chapel is the Lovekyn Chapel at Kingston upon Thames, within what is now Kingston Grammar School. The Grade II* listed chapel was founded in 1309 and is no longer used for religious services.

==Mass for the dead==
The Christian practices of prayer and offering mass for the repose of the soul of a deceased person are recorded as early as the 3rd and 4th centuries respectively. The custom of having quantities of masses offered for the dead is first recorded in the early 7th century, in connection with the developing understanding of transferable spiritual credit and clerical stipends. By around the year 700 the practice had emerged across Western Europe of priests saying multiple masses simultaneously, driving the proliferation of side altars.

The most common form was the &quot;anniversarium&quot; or &quot;missa annualis&quot;, a mass said annually on the anniversary of a person&#x27;s death. At the Council of Attigny in 765, about 40 abbots and bishops agreed to say mass and recite the psalms for the repose of the souls of their deceased brethren. Ninth-century France and England have records of numerous such undertakings between monasteries and churches, whereby they would offer prayers for the souls of deceased members of each other&#x27;s communities. Before the year 1000 in Italy, France and England, parishes extended the benefits of such facilities to the laity. Kings and great magnates asked for prayers for their souls in the monasteries they had founded.

===Origin of chantries===
Current theory described by Colvin (2000) locates the origins of the chantry in the rapid expansion of regular monasteries in the 11th century. The abbey of Cluny and its hundreds of daughter houses were central to this: the Cluniac order emphasised an elaborate liturgy as the centre of its common life, developing an unrivalled liturgy for the dead and offering its benefits to its patrons. By the 1150s, the order had so many demands for masses for the dead that Peter the Venerable placed a moratorium on further endowments.

Other monastic orders benefited from this movement, but similarly became burdened by commemoration. The history of the Cistercian house of Bordesley (Worcestershire), a royal abbey, demonstrates this: in the mid-12th century, it offered the services of two priest monks, presumably to say mass, for the soul of Robert de Stafford; between 1162 and 1173, it offered the services of an additional six monks for the souls of Earl Hugh of Chester and his family. This sort of dedication of prayers towards particular individuals was a step towards the institutional chantry.

Crouch (2001) points to the parallel development of communities or colleges of secular priests or canons as another theory of influence on the evolution of the chantry. Such communities were not monastic foundations: although members lived a similar lifestyle to monks they differed in that their monastic rule was relaxed to allow preaching and ministry, beyond the confines of their institution, to the population at large. Like the monasteries, they offered dedicated prayers for the dead. An example is the collegiate church of Marwell (Hampshire), founded by Bishop Henry of Winchester in the early 1160s. The priests of the college were to pray for the souls of the bishops of Winchester and kings of England. Gradually perpetual masses for the dead were delegated to one altar and one secular priest within a greater church.

===Royal endowments===
The family of King Henry II of England (1154–1189) contributed greatly to religious patronage. Henry II founded at least one daily mass for his soul by his gift of the manor of Lingoed in Gwent to Dore Abbey in Herefordshire; he provided for the services in perpetuity of four monk-priests. In 1183 the king lost his eldest son, Henry the Young King. In 1185 his third son, Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany, died in a tournament near Paris. Henry II commemorated his sons by founding what resembled the classic institutional chantry: he endowed altars and priests at Rouen Cathedral in perpetuity for the soul of the young Henry.

King Philip II of France endowed priests at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris for the soul of Duke Geoffrey. John, Count of Mortain, the youngest son of Henry II, also created chantry-like foundations: in 1192 he endowed the collegiate church of Bakewell in Derbyshire for the establishment of a prebend at Lichfield Cathedral; the holder was to celebrate mass in perpetuity for John&#x27;s soul. The concept of the institutional chantry thus developed in the 1180s within English and French royal circles, which were wealthy enough to endow them.

In non-royal society, the first perpetual mass was endowed by Richard FitzReiner, Sheriff of the City of London, in his private chapel within his manor of Broad Colney in Hertfordshire. He established it by the terms of his last testament in 1191, and the chantry was operational in 1212. A close associate of the Angevin royal court, FitzReiner may have adopted its religious practice.

===Provision in later medieval England===

Analysis of later medieval wills has shown that the chantry appeared in many forms. A perpetual chantry consisted of one or more priests, in a private free-standing chapel, usually licensed by the local bishop (such as the surviving one at Noseley, Leicestershire) or in an aisle of a greater church. If chantries were in religious communities, they were sometimes headed by a warden or archpriest. Such chantries generally had constitutions directing the terms by which priests might be appointed and how they were to be supervised. The perpetual chantry was the most prestigious and expensive option for the wealthy burgess or nobleman. A lesser option was the endowment of a fixed-term chantry, to fund masses sung by one or two priests at a side altar. Terms ranging from one to ten years were more common than the perpetual variety of chantry.

==Abolition of Chantries Acts, 1545 and 1547==

Following the Reformation in England initiated by King Henry VIII, Parliament passed an Act in 1545 which defined chantries as representing misapplied funds and misappropriated lands. The Act provided that all chantries and their properties would thenceforth belong to the King for as long as he should live. In conjunction with the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Act helped to finance the war with France. Because Henry lived for only two years after the Act was passed, few chantries were closed or transferred to him. His young son and successor, King Edward VI, signed a new Act in 1547, which ended 2,374 chantries and guild chapels and seized their assets; it also instituted inquiries to determine all of their possessions.

Although the Act required the money to go to &quot;charitable&quot; ends and the &quot;public good&quot;, most of it appears to have gone to friends of the Court. The Crown sold many chantries to private citizens; for example, in 1548 Thomas Bell of Gloucester purchased at least five in his city. The Act provided that the Crown had to guarantee a pension to all chantry priests displaced by its implementation.

An example of the fate of an abolished chantry is St Anne&#x27;s Chapel in Barnstaple, Devon: its assets were acquired by the Mayor of Barnstaple and others in 1585, some time after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The deed of feoffment dated 1 November 1585 exists in the George Grant Francis collection in Swansea, summarised as follows:
(i) Robert Appley the elder, Robert Cade, Hugh Brasyer and Richard Wetheridge of Barnestaple to: (ii) William Plamer, mayor of Barnestaple, Richard Dodderidge, Roger Cade, Symon Monngey, Robert Appley the younger, Robert Pronze (Prouse?), Roger Beaple, George Pyne, gent., Jacob Wescombe, Gilbert Hareys, Robert Marlen, Thomas Mathewe, James Beaple, George Baker, James Downe, William Bayly, John Collybeare, Robert Collybeare, and John Knyll of Barnestaple; 1 Chancery and Chapel of St Anne lately dissolved in Barnestaple with 1 house with land belonging to the late Chancery and Chapel; also 1 house and land in Barnestaple which John Littlestone of Barnestaple, merchant, and John Buddle, potter, granted to (i).

One of the most significant effects of the chantries, and the most significant loss resulting from their suppression, was educational, as chantry priests had provided education. Katherine, Lady Berkeley had founded the first chantry school in 1384. Since chantry priests were not ordinaries, nor did they offer public masses, they could serve their communities in other ways. When King Edward VI closed the chantries, priests were displaced who had previously taught the urban poor and rural residents; afterwards, local residents suffered greatly diminished access to education for their children. Some of the chantries were converted into grammar schools named after King Edward.

Royal peculiars were not covered by any of the above Acts of Parliament, so were not abolished. Most declined over time, until the jurisdiction of almost all was abolished in the 19th century. Some royal peculiars survive, including Westminster Abbey and St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor.

Historian A. G. Dickens has concluded:
:To Catholic opinion, the problem set by these legal confiscations ... [was] the disappearance of a large clerical society from their midst, the silencing of masses, the rupture of both visible and spiritual ties, which over so many centuries have linked rude provincial men with the great world of the Faith. In taking an essentially religious view of these events, these Englishmen seem to the present writer to have had every justification. ... The Edwardian dissolution exerted its profounder effects in the field of religion. In large part it proved destructive, for while it helped to debar a revival of Catholic devotion it clearly contains elements which injured the reputation of Protestantism.

<text>RBC, previously known as RBC Roosendaal, is a football club based in Roosendaal, Netherlands. RBC currently plays in the fifth-tier Vierde Divisie after bankruptcy in 2011, restarting the club in the tenth tier Vijfde Klasse.

== History ==
=== 1912–1949: Formative years, mostly Tweede Klasse ===
RBC, the idea of Frans Mathijsen and Anton Poldermans, was formed on 31 July 1912. The club was initially called Excelsior and was renamed VV Roosendaal in 1920. On 16 July 1927, the club name changed to Roosendaal Boys Combinatie (RBC) because of the merger with &quot;Roosendaalsche Boys&quot;.

=== 1950–1999: Hovering between amateurs and professionals ===
In 1955 the club turned professional and won the Tweede Divisie B in 1957. With the leagues restructured by the KNVB the club left professional football in 1971. Between the return to professional status in 1983 RBC was a successful amateur club.

On 23 October 1999, the club&#x27;s name was officially changed to RBC Roosendaal.

=== 2000s: Eredivisie for the first time ===

In 2000 the club reached the Eredivisie for the first time just for one season. Before 2001, RBC played its league games in stadium De Luiten, which had a capacity of 2,000 seats and 5,000 standing places. In 2001, RBC moved into its new 5,000 seater stadium. RBC returned in the Eredivisie in 2002 for four seasons.

In the 2004–05 season, RBC just avoided the relegation playoff. Relegation could not be avoided a year later, with RBC finishing bottom of the Eredivisie in the 2005–06 season.

=== 2010s: Bankruptcy and a fresh beginning ===
On 8 June 2011, RBC Roosendaal was declared bankrupt after the board failed to repay the outstanding debts of €1.6 million; this led to an automatic revocation of the professional license from KNVB. With RBC Roosendaal now out of Eerste Divisie, the board started working in order to register the club to the amateur Hoofdklasse league for the 15 June deadline. On 14 June 2011, it was announced that RBC would not play in the Hoofdklasse.

On 21 September 2011, it was announced that the club would make a new start in Dutch football under the name RBC. RBC started season 2012–13 in the Vijfde Klasse, the 9th tier in Dutch football. It played its games at Sportpark Rimboe in the village of Wouwse Plantage, just south of Roosendaal. On 7 April 2013, its first promotion since their restart was confirmed after beating VV Rimboe 10–1. It played the 2013–14 season in the Vierde Klasse. One week after winning promotion, it won the championship of the division. After the end of the 2012–13 season it was announced that RBC would return to its old ground, the RBC Stadion. After finishing runner-up two consecutive seasons, RBC won a Vierde Klasse title in 2017 and it promoted to the Derde Klasse.

=== 2020s: Promotions and a botched merger ===
At the beginning of 2020 the club was again at the brink of a bankruptcy and was exploring a merger with RKSV Halsteren. A merger agreement has been reached and was contingent to supporter input. After already agreeing on a new name and colors, the clubs decided not to merge.

In May 2020, RBC reached promotion to the Tweede Klasse after the Royal Dutch Football Association granted them the decision. RBC had won two &quot;period titles&quot; in the 2019–20 season, which had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2023, RBC won another promotion, reaching the sixth-tier Eerste Klasse after a 6–1 home victory against VV Virtus. And a year later, in 2024, They won another promotion to the Vierde Divisie after staying unbeaten in the league.

<doc id="1218852" wikidata="Q1645012" url="?curid=1218852" title="Operation Matterhorn">
<text>Operation Matterhorn was a military operation of the United States Army Air Forces in World War II for strategic bombing by Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers based in India, Ceylon, and China. Targets included industrial facilities in Japan, China and Southeast Asia. The B-29s were based in India but staged through bases around Chengdu in China&#x27;s Sichuan province. Since the Japanese had cut the Burma Road in 1942, the only line of communications with China was over &quot;the Hump&quot;, as the air ferry route to China over the Himalayas was called. All the fuel, ammunition and supplies used by American forces in China had to be flown in.

To control the B-29s, the Joint Chiefs of Staff created the Twentieth Air Force under the command of General Henry H. Arnold, the chief of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), in Washington, DC. The role of the China Burma India Theater (CBI) commander, Lieutenant General Joseph W. Stilwell, was restricted to the provision of logistical support and the defense of the bases. The B-29s force in CBI was the XX Bomber Command, under the command of Brigadier General Kenneth B. Wolfe. The B-29s required airbases with runways that were longer and stronger than those of smaller bombers. Five airfields in Bengal in India were upgraded to take them. Supplying fuel by rail would have placed too much strain on the railways, so a fuel pipeline to the airfields was laid from the port of Calcutta. The four B-29 airbases around Chengdu, along with five airstrips for fighters to defend them, were built by tens of thousands of Chinese laborers with hand tools.

The XX Bomber Command deployed to India between February and May 1944. On 5 June, Wolfe launched the first B-29 Superfortress combat mission, against the Japanese railroad facilities at Bangkok. Ten days later, sixty-eight Superfortresses took off from the bases around Chengdu to bomb Imperial Iron and Steel Works in Yawata on Kyūshū. The Bombing of Yawata was the first air raid on the Japanese home islands since the Doolittle raid of April 1942, and it marked the beginning of the strategic bombardment campaign against Japan. Other targets included Singapore and the oil refineries around Palembang in the Netherlands East Indies. In late 1944, the Japanese offensive Operation Ichi-Go in China threatened the bases. To slow the advance, the XX Bomber Command attacked the Japanese-held city of Hankou with incendiary bombs. The attack left Hankou burning for three days, proving the effectiveness of incendiaries against the predominantly wooden housing stock of the Far East.

In November 1944, American bombers began raiding Japan from the Mariana Islands. The XX Bomber Command abandoned the logistically difficult and increasingly vulnerable bases in China in January 1945, and concentrated its resources on rail and port facilities in Indochina, Thailand, and Burma. This signaled the end of Matterhorn. The 58th Bombardment Wing, the only operational wing of the XX Bomber Command, left India to join the XXI Bomber Command in the Marianas between February and April 1945.

==Background==
===B-29 Superfortress===

On 29 January 1940, the United States Army Air Corps issued a request to five major aircraft manufacturers to submit designs for a four-engine bomber with a range of . These designs were evaluated, and on 6 September orders were placed for two experimental models each from Boeing and Consolidated Aircraft, which became the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and the Consolidated B-32 Dominator. These were known as very long range (VLR) bombers. On 17 May 1941, Boeing was ordered to commence the manufacture of the B-29 when ready.
Boeing devoted its plants in Renton, Washington and Wichita, Kansas to B-29 production; assemblies would later also be built by the Bell Aircraft Corporation in Marietta, Georgia, and the Glenn L. Martin Company in Omaha, Nebraska. A major recruiting and training program was required. Many of the workers were recruited from the surrounding areas, and had no experience in aircraft manufacturing. As they became more skilled, the man-hours required to build a B-29 was reduced from 150,000 to 20,000. The $3 billion cost of design and production (equivalent to $ billion today), far exceeded the $1.9 billion cost of the Manhattan Project, made the B-29 program the most expensive of the war.

With its wingspan, the B-29 was one of the largest aircraft of World War II. It sported state-of-the-art technology, which included a pressurized cabin, dual-wheel tricycle landing gear, and an analog electromechanical computer-controlled fire-control system that allowed the four gunners to direct five remote machine gun turrets, each with twin Browning .50 caliber machine guns; the rear turret also had a 20-mm cannon. It was powered by four 18-cylinder, Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines, each with two turbochargers.

The cumulative effect of so many advanced features was more than the usual number of problems and defects associated with a new aircraft. This was compounded by efforts to fast track its introduction into service. These included engine malfunctions, jammed gears and dead power plants. The engines in particular had a large number of defects. The front and rear rows of the engine cylinders were located too close together for efficient cooling; there was insufficient lubrication of the upper cylinders; the reduction drive was prone to failure; and the carburetor produced an inefficient fuel mixture distribution. All of these factors contributed to engine overheating, which sometimes resulted in fires owing to an extensive use of magnesium. In spite of 2,000 engineering changes, the engines remained susceptible to overheating.

=== Strategy ===
Ostensibly, the B-29 was intended to defend the Western Hemisphere against encroachment by a hostile foreign power, but as early as September 1939, Colonel Carl Spaatz had suggested that it might be used to bomb Japan from bases in Siberia, Luzon or the Aleutian Islands. The Air Corps&#x27; first war plan, AWPD-1, issued in September 1941, called for B-29s to bomb Germany from bases in Great Britain and Egypt by 1944. Early war plans did not contemplate bombing Japan until after the war against Germany was won. The idea of basing the Superfortresses in China first surfaced at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943. In March, the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, Major General Laurence S. Kuter, initiated a detailed study of the possibility of using VLR bombers based in China. No other bases within range of Japan were expected to be in Allied hands in 1944.
Support for the effort was through the port of Calcutta, which was estimated to be able to handle the additional per month. From there, supplies would be flown to China in Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers converted to Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express transport aircraft. After the Japanese had cut the Burma Road in March 1942, the only line of communications with China was over &quot;the Hump&quot;, as the air ferry route to China over the Himalayas was called. Until the Burma Road could be reopened by the ground forces, all the fuel, ammunition and supplies used by American forces in China had flown over the Hump. It was estimated that 200 C-87 flights would be required to support each VLR bomber group, with 2,000 C-87s in operation by October 1944 and 4,000 by May 1945. Five missions per group per month could be flown, with 168 group-months believed to be sufficient to destroy all targets in Japan within twelve months.

The staff of the China-Burma-India Theater (CBI) were invited to comment, and they opined that the plan was too optimistic about the logistical challenges involved. On request, the CBI Theater commander, Lieutenant General Joseph W. Stilwell submitted an alternative plan drafted by his air commander, Major General George E. Stratemeyer, codenamed &quot;Twilight&quot;, that called for more time, a smaller effort, and reduced logistical support. Under this plan, the bombers would be based in the Calcutta area and only staged through Chinese bases for missions. Keeping the ground crews in India would reduce the logistical footprint in China. Stilwell cautioned that the likely Japanese response to any success by the bombers would be a ground offensive to capture the airfields. It was estimated that the first raids on Japan could be mounted as early as April 1944.

In April 1943, the commander of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), General Henry H. Arnold, set up a special B-29 project under Brigadier General Kenneth B. Wolfe. Wolfe became responsible for preparing, organizing and training B-29 units for combat. By September, he had prepared a plan for operations based on Twilight called &quot;Matterhorn&quot;; soon after the Twilight plan was renamed &quot;Drake&quot;. The difference between Matterhorn and Drake was that under Matterhorn the B-29s would stage through Chengdu in Sichuan province in western China, whereas under Drake they would stage through Guilin in eastern China. Moving the B-29 bases further back from the front lines allowed the ground defense to be dispensed with, and the air defenses scaled back to two fighter groups that would be assigned to Major General Claire Chennault&#x27;s China-based Fourteenth Air Force. Supplies would be stockpiled in China by the B-29s themselves, assisted by the B-24s of Fourteenth Air Force&#x27;s 308th Bombardment Group. Arnold approved the plan on 12 October.
On 10 November 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a message to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, asking him to render assistance with the construction of bases in India and one to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek asking him to provide labor and materials for the construction of five advanced bases in China, which the United States would pay for under Reverse Lend-Lease. Although Drake still had its advocates, Matterhorn was formally approved by Roosevelt and Churchill at the Sextant Conference in Cairo on 7 December.

The British and American Combined Chiefs of Staff had authorized a Central Pacific drive that included the capture of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, Truk, Palau and the Mariana Islands. but it was not considered likely that they would be available before 1945. The air staff planners began incorporating the Marianas into their plans as a potential base for the B-29s in September 1943. This was formally approved at Sextant. By January 1944, there was consideration of advancing the Central Pacific timetable by bypassing Truk and heading directly for Palau after the capture of the Marshalls, but senior army and navy officers in the Pacific doubted the utility of basing B-29s in the Marianas due to the limited harbor facilities there.

A study by the Joint War Plans Committee (JWPC) assessed the Mariana Islands as the best location for the deployment of the B-29s, bu,t since they would not be captured until later in the year, recommended that the first B-29 groups be deployed to the Southwest Pacific Area to attack the petroleum refineries in the Netherlands East Indies or to India and China to attack industrial targets in Japan. The timetable for the Central Pacific advance was revised in March 1944: Truk was to be bypassed and the Palau operation was postponed until 15 September, after the capture of the southern Mariana Islands, which was now scheduled to commence on 15 June 1944. The new timetable was approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 12 March.

===Target selection===
In March 1943, Arnold had asked the Committee of Operations Analysts (COA) to prepare an analysis of strategic targets in Japan whose destruction might affect the course of the war. Most of Japan&#x27;s war industries lay within the range of a B-29 with a ten-ton bomb load. The COA had been created in December 1942, and its membership included officers from the Army and Navy, along with distinguished civilians consultants such as Edward M. Earle, Thomas W. Lamont, Clark H. Minor and Elihu Root Jr. In a report delivered on 11 November 1943, they identified six priority economic targets: merchant shipping, steel production, urban industrial areas, aircraft plants, ball bearings, and electronics.

Particular vulnerable were the ball bearing industry, which relied on six major plants, and the steel industry, which was dependent on a small number of coke plants located on Kyushu and in Manchuria and Korea—all within range of B-29s based at Chengdu. The analysts assessed the capacity of the Japanese steel industry at per year, which was very close to the real figure, but erroneously thought that it was running at full capacity. In fact, the bombers would have to destroy of capacity to have any impact on production.

The JWPC also considered targeting, but favored shipping and the oil industry, which could more easily be attacked from bases in Australia. The staff of the USAAF accepted the importance of targeting shipping, but it was not what the B-29 was designed for. As for the oil industry, the oil refineries in the Dutch East Indies, primarily the ones at Palembang, could be attacked by B-29s based in India, staging through Ceylon. The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the Matterhorn plan on 10 April 1944, but cut the force to just one wing of four groups. In recognition of the accelerated schedule for the capture of the Marianas, the second B-29 wing would be sent there instead, or to Australia if bases in the Marianas were not yet ready.

== Command and organization ==
To control the B-29s, the 58th Bombardment Wing was activated at Marietta Army Air Field, near Bell&#x27;s B-29 plant, on 1 June 1943, and Wolfe had assumed command on 21 June. Although he had an experience in engineering and development in the United States and the Philippines, and an excellent knowledge of the B-29, he had no upper echelon command or operational experience. He did however have a free hand in selecting officers for his organization. Many came from his former command at Wright Field, Ohio, including the leading expert on the B-29, Colonel Leonard F. Harman, who became his deputy. For his assistant chief of staff for operations (A-3), he secured Brigadier General LaVerne G. Saunders, who had been awarded the Navy Cross while in command of the 11th Bombardment Group during the Guadalcanal campaign.

The Second Air Force provided four airfields for training in the vicinity of Salina, Kansas, not far from Boeing&#x27;s Wichita plant where most of the early model B-29s were made, and the 58th Bombardment Wing moved its headquarters to Smoky Hill Army Air Field near Salina on 15 September. The wing was initially under the direct control of USAAF headquarters, but on 11 October it was assigned to Second Air Force. The XX Bomber Command was activated in Salina, on 27 November 1943, with Wolfe as its commander, and Harman became the commander of the 58th Bombardment Wing.
The group commanders had a wealth of experience. The 444th Bombardment Group was led by Colonel Alva L. Harvey, who had been a test pilot for the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and had participated in the first American bombing raid on Berlin. Colonel Richard H. Carmichael led the 462nd Bombardment Group; he had formerly commanded the 19th Bombardment Group in the Southwest Pacific Area, and had led the first B-17 raid on Rabaul in February 1943. Colonel Howard E. Engler commanded the 468th Bombardment Group until August 1944, when he was replaced by Colonel Ted S. Faulkner. The 40th Bombardment Group was commanded by Colonel Lewis R. Parker. He was sent to England to obtain combat experience with the Eighth Air Force and was shot down on his second mission over Germany on 6 March 1944. He was replaced by Harman in April 1944, and Saunders succeeded him as commander of the 58th Bombardment Wing.
Command and control of the B-29s was subject to further debate among the Joint Chiefs of Staff. To avoid the B-29s being misused on the battlefields when they would be much more useful against the Japanese home islands, the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest J. King, suggested that an air force be created under Arnold&#x27;s command. Arnold would be responsible for its administration and logistical support, and would control it as the executive agent of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who would determine its deployment and missions. The Joint Chiefs approved the establishment of the Twentieth Air Force on 4 April 1944. This gave the USAAF equal status with the ground and naval forces in Asia and the Pacific for the first time. Stilwell&#x27;s role as commander of CBI would be restricted to providing logistical support and the defense of the B-29&#x27;s bases.
Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell Jr., the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and the Acting Assistant Chief of the Air Staff for Plans, was appointed the chief of staff of the Twentieth Air Force. As the air member of the JWPC, he was familiar with plans for the deployment and use of the B-29. He held his first staff meeting on 12 April. He was the &quot;de facto&quot; commander of the Twentieth Air Force, especially after Arnold suffered a heart attack on 10 May 1944.

The table of organization and equipment for the B-29 groups was authorized on 13 January 1944. Each aircraft had a crew of eleven. Five were officers: the pilot-commander, co-pilot, two navigator-bombardiers, and the flight engineer. The other six were enlisted personnel: an engine mechanic, electrical specialist, power-plant specialist, central fire-control specialist, radio operator, and radar operator. Each squadron had seven aircraft, and each of the four groups had four squadrons, so the wing had 112 B-29s. Each B-29 had two crews, so the wing had 3,045 officers, 8 warrant officers and 8,099 enlisted men. With the service and maintenance units and aviation engineers to build the airfields, Wolfe would have about 20,000 men under its command.


XX Bomber Command

:10th Photo Tech Unit

Wolfe and an advanced echelon of his XX Bomber Command staff arrived in New Delhi on 13 January 1944, where he met with Stratemeyer. On 3 February he met with Stilwell at the latter&#x27;s advanced headquarters in Burma to discuss command arrangements. They agreed that the XX Bomber Command should not come under Chennault&#x27;s command, nor under that of Stratemeyer, who was answerable Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the commander of South East Asia Command (SEAC). Stilwell feared that Chennault would use the B-29s to attack Japanese shipping and thereby provoke a strong Japanese reaction that would be beyond the ability of the Chinese army to oppose. He therefore issued a directive on 15 February that placed the XX Bomber Command under his own direct command and control.

== Training and preparation ==
As well as the recruitment of senior staff, Wolfe was authorized to procure twenty-five pilots and twenty-five navigators with experience of long over-water flights in four-engine aircraft. The training of the crews of the 58th Bombardment Wing was rendered difficult by the shortage of B-29s. The first prototype XB-29 was turned over to the USAAF shortly after the 58th Bombardment Wing was formed in June 1943, but the first production B-29 did not arrive until August. In the meantime, crews trained on fifty Martin B-26 Marauders. These were subsequently replaced by B-17s, which were more like the B-29. By November 1943 there was still only one B-29 between twelve crews. A month later they had flown an average of just 18½ hours in the B-29, and only 67 commander-pilots were fully qualified on the B-29. In view of this, the number of crews to be trained was reduced to 240, and the date of completion of their training was postponed from 1 February to 1 March.
By February 1944, the entire XX Bomber Command had only flown 9,000 hours in B-29s, and few of these were above due to issues with the power plant. Ninety-seven B-29s had been delivered, but two of them had the central fire control system installed, and it had not been fully tested. The late delivery of the aircraft seriously dislocated the crew training program, and many of the crews lacked sufficient training in high-altitude formation flying, gunnery, and visual and radar bombing.

Arnold had hoped that the B-29s would be ready by January 1944, but on 12 October 1943 he notified Roosevelt:

He visited the B-29 plant in Wichita on 11 January 1944 and had his name written on the 175th aircraft, and told the workers that he wanted it delivered by 1 March 1944. The aircraft, Superfortress 42-6365 &quot;General H. H. Arnold Special&quot;, was delivered on 24 February 1944. Changes disrupted the delivery of key parts. Because so many modifications had been made while aircraft were being built, it had become standard practice to fly new B-29s direct from the factory to a modification center to be upgraded. The modification centers were overworked, and had limited hangar space, so much of their work had to be done in the open air. When Arnold visited Pratt Army Air Field on 8 March 1944, he found no B-29s ready for combat. 

Arnold designated Brigadier General Bennett E. Meyers, who was traveling with him, as special project cocoordinator, with responsibility for getting the B-29s ready. Meyers chose Colonel Clarence S. Irvine as his deputy. Boeing provided 600 workers, although this slowed work on the production lines. The deficiencies of each aircraft were cataloged and spare parts were obtained. Work was carried out in appalling Kansas winter conditions, with snowstorms and outdoor temperatures between . By 15 April, 150 aircraft were combat ready.

== Base development ==
===India===
The B-29&#x27;s wing span was considerably wider than the of the B-17, the next largest aircraft in the inventory, and a fully-laden B-29 weighed about , nearly twice as much as a B-17. The Twentieth Air Force asked for B-29 runways to be long and wide, nearly twice the area of a B-17 runway. The plan was to enlarge and improve five existing runways in the flatlands west of Calcutta to bring them up to B-29 standards. Five airfields were selected on 17 November: Bishnupur, Piardoba, Kharagpur, Kalaikunda and Chakulia. Wolfe&#x27;s advance party from the XX Bomber Command inspected the fields in December and accepted all but Bishnupur, for which Dudhkundi was substituted.
Work was carried out by US Army engineer units with imported materials and local labor. Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth E. Madsen was in charge of construction of the air bases; Colonel William C. Kinsolving, a petroleum engineer, had the task of laying two pipelines to the airfields. They reported to Colonel Thomas Farrell, who headed the CBI Construction Service.

Each air base required four months&#x27; work by an engineer aviation battalion. To meet the April deadline, the engineer units should have been in place by December, but they were still in the United States. Stillwell gave them priority for shipping, and they set out on a convoy that sailed on 15 December. Traveling via North Africa, they reached India in February 1944, but their unit equipment did not begin to arrive until 15 April, and was not complete until 30 June. With its arrival, Madsen had 6,000 engineers and 27,000 Indian civilians under contract from India&#x27;s Central Public Works Department on the job.

Works were not completed until September. The decision in April to deploy the second wing of B-29s to the Marianas meant that only four groups deployed to CBI instead of the original eight, so only the five original airfields were required. Delays in construction at Dudhkundi meant that Charra Airfield had to be used temporarily. The B-24 runway there was extended to accommodate the 444th Bombardment Group until Dudhkundi was ready in July. The total cost of constructing the airbases was estimated at $20 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

=== China ===
Lieutenant Colonel Henry A. Byroade was appointed the project engineer responsible for construction of the B-29 airfields in China. He personally reconoitered the Chengdu area in November 1943, and in his report on 8 December he selected four B-29 airbase sites, Xinjin, Guanghan, Qionglai and Pengshan, where existing runways could be strengthened and lengthened to accommodate the B-29s. In addition, there were five airstrips for fighters.
At the Sextant Conference in Cairo, Roosevelt promised the Chiang that the United States would fully reimburse China for labor and materials expended on Matterhorn. The Chinese estimated that the airbases would cost two to three billion Chinese yuan, around $100 to $150 million (equivalent to $ to $ million in ), at least at the official rate of exchange; on the black market an American dollar fetched up to 240 Chinese yuan. Stilwell suspected that half of this sum was in the form of &quot;squeeze&quot; (bribes and commissions), an accepted business practice in China. &quot;One more example&quot;, he wrote in his diary, &quot;of the stupid spirit of concession that proves to them that we are suckers.&quot;

Landowners were inadequately compensated for the loss of their land and the peasants who worked it were not compensated at all. Construction work was supervised by Lieutenant Colonel Waldo I. Kenerson. Only fourteen U.S. Army engineers were assigned to the project.
Some 300,000 impressed laborers and 75,000 contract workers were employed. Contract workers were paid on a piecework basis, and averaged about 25 Chinese yuan per day. This was barely sufficient to buy food, so many had to be supported by their families.
There were no bulldozers, power shovels or graders. Some 1,000 ox carts, 15,000 wheelbarrows and 1,500 trucks were used to carry building materials. The topsoil and some of the subsoil was removed, with hoes, and was carried away in wicker baskets on shoulder poles by men and boys. The subsoil was rolled flat using huge concrete rollers hauled by up to 300 workers. A layer of pebbles taken from nearby streams was laid down using wheelbarrows. Saunders landed the first B-29 at Guanghan on 24 April, where he was met by officials including Wolfe, Chennault and Zhang. All four airfields were completed by 10 May 1944.

===Ceylon===
In addition to raids on Japan from bases in China, the Sextant Conference also approved attacks on the oil refineries in the Dutch East Indies by B-29s based in India, staging through Ceylon, with a target date of 20 July 1944. Although the southeast corner of Ceylon would have been the best location from a tactical point of view, being closest to Palembang, it was rejected due to the poor communications with that part of the island. The British extended the airfield at China Bay to accommodate 56 B-29s.

== Deployment ==
=== Sealift and airlift ===
The Matterhorn plan called for 20,000 troops and of cargo to be shipped from the United States to CBI between 1 January and 30 June 1944, followed by of fuel per month starting in April 1944. This would not have been a major undertaking for the European Theater of Operations, but movement to CBI was complicated by the long distance from the United States, the poor state of communications within the theater, and the low priority of CBI, especially with regard to shipping. The proviso at Sextant that Matterhorn shipments not materially affect other approved operations in CBI conflicted with the tight timetable.
High priority passengers and freight traveled by air. The advance party of the XX Bomber Command, which included Wolfe, left Morrison Field in twenty C-87 transports on 5 January 1944 and arrived in New Delhi eight days later. Wolfe established his headquarters at Kharagpur, which was situated at a junction on Bengal Nagpur Railway lines serving the airfields. The Hijli Detention Camp was taken over to serve as his headquarters building.

It was originally intended that all air crews would fly in B-29s, but this was discarded in favor of carrying a spare engine in each plane. Twenty-five Douglas C-54 Skymaster aircraft carried 1,252 passengers and 250 replacement Wright R-3350 engines. Stilwell provided this from CBI&#x27;s allotment of Air Transport Command (ATC) flights. The trip could take as few as six days, but personnel were often bumped in favour of more important passengers, and many took over a month.

The ground echelons traveled by sea. A contingent that included seven of the bomb maintenance squadrons departed from Newport News on 12 February and reached Bombay on 25 April. Eight bomb maintenance squadrons embarked from Los Angeles on the troopship on 27 February and sailing via Melbourne, Australia, they reached Bombay on 31 March. From there it took a week to travel across India to Kharagpur by train. One contingent made the trip from the United States to Kharagpur in 34 days, but most took eight to ten weeks.

On 10 May, the XX Bomber Command reported 21,930 personnel on hand. This included a few who were already stationed in CBI, and several hundred who had arrived by air, but about 20,000 of them had arrived by sea in March and April.

=== B-29 deployment ===
The construction of airfields in China and India with unusually long runways could not be concealed from the Japanese. Nonetheless, the B-29 &quot;Hobo Queen&quot;, commanded by Colonel Frank R. Cook, flew to RAF Bassingbourn in the UK on 8 March as part of a deception plan that the B-29 would be deployed to Europe. It departed the UK on 1 April, and became the second B-29 to reach its destination when it touched down at Kharagpur on 6 April; the first, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, piloted by Harman, reached Chakulia on 2 April. The B-29s of the 58th Bombardment Wing began departing for India on 24 March, setting out in daily increments of nine or ten aircraft, with the trip expected to take up to five days. The chosen route was from Salina to Gander Lake (), Marrakech (), Cairo (), Karachi () and Calcutta (), a total of . Air crew were not informed of their final destination before departure.

By 15 April, only 32 aircraft had arrived at their stations. One B-29 crashed on takeoff from Marrakesh after the pilot forgot to extend the flaps. Another was grounded in Cairo for two weeks while engineers replaced all four engines. Two were lost in Cairo; one developed engine trouble soon after takeoff and crashed and burned on landing when it attempted to land, while another crashed on landing when its nose landing gear collapsed. All the crewmen survived these accidents, but five died when a B-29 crashed in Karachi in a sandstorm. Another was also lost there, and all B-29s were grounded from 21 to 29 April while investigations were conducted into the causes. In all, five B-29s were lost and four damaged en route, but 130 aircraft had arrived safely by 8 May. Wolfe reported to Arnold on 26 April 1944 that: &quot;The airplanes and crews got off to a bad start due to late production schedules, difficult modifications, inclement weather, and the sheer pressure of time necessary to meet the early commitment date.&quot;

=== Fighters ===
The deception plan was a failure; the Japanese made it known through radio broadcasts that they were well aware of the deployment of the B-29s. Although Calcutta was bombed, the B-29 airfields in Bengal lay close to the limit of the range of Japanese bombers. The airfields around Chengdu were well within range though. For this reason Chennault had asked for a fighter group to defend the airfields, and the Matterhorn plan had called for two. At the Sextant Conference the Combined Chiefs of Staff had decided to transfer two fighter groups from Italy.
The 33rd and 81st Fighter Groups were selected. To control the fighters, the Fourteenth Air Force activated the 312th Fighter Wing on 13 March, and Brigadier General Adlai H. Gilkeson assumed command twelve days later. Chennault recommended that the groups be equipped with North American P-51 Mustang fighters, but they had to be equipped with the less fuel efficient Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Stratemeyer asked that the P-47s be sent from the United States, and the two groups conduct their conversion training in CBI.

If shipped normally, they would not arrive in Karachi before May, so the U.S. Navy made the escort carriers and available to deliver the first hundred P-47s; the remaining fifty followed on freighters. The deployment of the two groups was delayed by their participation in the Battle of Anzio, but their flight echelons moved by air in mid-February, and the ground echelons moved by sea, embarking from Taranto, and arriving at Bombay on 20 March. The P-47s arrived at Karachi on 30 March, allowing conversion training to commence.

Stilwell was sufficiently concerned about the security of the Chengdu airfields to recommend that B-29 operations be postponed by a month. Permission for this was not forthcoming, so the 33rd Fighter Group&#x27;s 59th Fighter Squadron was sent to Sichuan with its old P-40s. It provided Chengdu&#x27;s sole air defense until May, when the rest of the 33rd Fighter Group, the 58th and 60th Fighter Squadrons, arrived with their P-47s. The 81st Fighter Group&#x27;s 92nd Fighter Squadron deployed to Guanghan on 15 May, but the 91st and 93rd Fighter Squadrons did not join it until July. In the event, the Japanese response was not as intense as had been feared, and the late deployment of the fighters eased the burden of stocking fuel at Chengdu.

== Logistics ==
The XX Bomber Command was well-situated in India, enjoying good road and rail communications with the port of Calcutta, the 28th Air Depot at Barrackpore, the ATC terminus in Assam, and the Air Service Command installations at Alipore. Supplies moved from the port at Calcutta to Assam by rail and barge, from whence they had to be flown across the Hump. Although a key feature of the Matterhorn plan was that the XX Bomber Command would support itself, this was impractical, and it had to fall back on the services of Brigadier General Thomas O. Hardin&#x27;s India–China Wing (ICW) of the ATC. This generated friction with the Fourteenth Air Force, which saw the XX Bomber Command as an interloping freeloader.

Twenty C-87s that the XX Bomber Command brought with it had been flown out by ATC pilots on 90-days&#x27; temporary duty. One was lost en route, and the rest were turned over to the ATC. The ICW promised that the XX Bomber Command would receive 1,650 tons out of the first flown over the Hump in February, plus half of the next . The ATC exceeded its target, and delivered , but the XX Bomber Command received just .

March was a difficult month for the ICW, with a gasoline shortage in Assam and the opening of the Battle of Imphal and operations in Northern Burma and Western Yunnan, which caused ATC aircraft and supplies intended for Matterhorn to be diverted to support of the ground forces. The first two B-29s flew across the Hump with gasoline on 26 April, and delivered enough gasoline for one B-29 combat sortie. Wolfe calculated that he needed to support two 100-bomber raids on Japan.
Wolfe had some B-29s converted to tankers by stripping them of combat equipment except for the tail guns. In this configuration, a B-29 could carry seven tons of fuel instead of three. On 26 May, the Japanese launched an offensive in China, and Stilwell diverted Hump tonnage earmarked for Matterhorn to the Fourteenth Air Force. The Hump was dangerous, with high mountains and variable weather. Flights were counted as combat missions for the purpose of crew rotation. Twelve B-29s were lost over the Hump by the end of July, largely due to engine failures, but most of the crews were rescued by friendly Chinese civilians.

Lieutenant Colonel Robert S. McNamara&#x27;s statistical section of the XX Bomber Command conducted a detailed investigation of the factors involved in the delivery of supplies to China. He managed to reduce gasoline consumption on a B-29 round trip to China and increase the fuel delivered. Part of this was accomplished by flying a more southerly and direct route, although this brought the B-29s within range of Japanese fighters based in northern Burma. Seventy C-109s were added to the effort to supply the XX Bomber Command in September, flown by surplus B-29 crews, and in November 1944 the B-29s were withdrawn from the airlift entirely and the C-109s were transferred to ATC.

== Offensive against Japanese petroleum and steel industries ==
=== Bangkok===

By 19 May the XX Bomber Command had accumulated 2,867 flying hours in B-29s, of which 2,378 were on transport missions and 50 on miscellaneous tasks. Only 439 had been devoted to training activities. Since there were 240 crews, this worked out to less than two hours each. Before attempting a raid on Japan, Wolfe decided to conduct a shakedown combat mission. The chosen target was the Makkasan railway yard facilities in Bangkok, Thailand. This was the only heavy locomotive and railway car repair shop on the Burma-Thailand railway network. A successful attack could affect the supply of Japanese troops fighting around Imphal and Myitkyina. Intelligence indicated that the likely Japanese anti-aircraft and fighter opposition would not be as great as that anticipated over Japan. The decisive factor in the choice of target, though, was that it could be attacked from the airfields in Bengal and would not affect the supplies stockpiled in Chengdu.
The mission involved a round trip of . Each bomber carried a fuel load of and of bombs; three groups carried general-purpose bombs while the fourth carried M18 incendiary bombs. The XX Bomber Command wanted to test out the new M18 incendiary bombs and the large number of wooden buildings and freight cars and a small oil facility in the area offered good targets. The resulting takeoff weight was too heavy for the temporary field at Charra, so the 444th Bombardment Group had to stage from the other three fields. The attack was launched at 05:45 (local time) on 5 June 1944 to avoid high ground temperatures that were bad for the R-3350 engines and to allow the whole mission to be conducted in daylight. Wolfe had suggested a night-time raid, but Arnold insisted on daylight precision bombing.

Of the 112 bombers that were readied for the mission, 98 took off from India. It took sixty-three minutes to get them all in the air. Most of the bombers that failed to take off had ignition or supercharger problem. One plane crashed shortly after takeoff when an engine lost power, killing all on board except the co-pilot. Thirteen planes aborted. Twelve aborted due to mechanical failures, most of which involved oil leaks or faults with the oil coolers. One plane failed to find its formation as a tropical cyclone rolled in over the Bay of Bengal; several others joined formations of groups other than their own, and some proceeded on their own.

Seventy-seven planes found the target. Seven planes reached Bangkok but were unable to bomb due to mechanical problems. Six had problems with their bomb bays. A chaotic series of bombing runs were made between 10:52 and 12:32. Because the target was obscured by clouds, forty-eight planes bombed by radar, although most crews had not been instructed in this technique. Japanese anti-aircraft fire was inaccurate, and although nine fighters attacked the bombers, their attacks were not pressed, and no B-29s were shot down. Four planes were lost on the return trip; two ditched into the Bay of Bengal after fuel ran out due to problems with the fuel transfer system; one crashed attempting to land at Dum Dum airfield; and one diverted to Kunming, China, but ran out of fuel and the crew had to bail out.

The mission to Bangkok resulted in the loss of five B-29s and the deaths of fifteen aircrew, with two more missing. Photo reconnaissance on 8 June indicated that sixteen or eighteen bombs had fallen within the target area. There was some damage to rolling stock and buildings, including the erecting and boiler shops. It was assessed that the damage would have no impact on the Japanese forces in Burma. The XX Bomber Command rated the mission as a success.

===Yawata===

The following day Wolfe received orders from Arnold for an attack on Japan with at least 70 B-29s on 15 June, to coincide with the invasion of the Marianas. Drastic economies were applied, which particularly affected the 312th Fighter Wing, which was left with very little fuel. Wolfe calculated that he would have enough fuel for a raid, but not enough for all the B-29s to return to India immediately afterwards. A particular problem was that only 86 Superfortreses could be equipped with the bomb bay tanks needed for the flight to Japan. The B-29s began staging to China on 13 June. Each carried a full bomb load of eight general purpose bombs, so only refueling was required in China. Of the 92 Superfortresses that departed, 79 made it to Chengdu, and one crashed en route.
The target chosen for the mission was the Imperial Iron and Steel Works in Yawata, which produced an estimated 2,250,000 metric tons of steel annually, representing 24 percent of Japan&#x27;s steel output. This production was dependent on three coke plants, the largest of which, with an annual production of 1,784,000 metric tons, was designated the aiming point for the raid. It was a round trip from Chengdu to Yawata. In the belief that the B-29 lacked the range to fly there in a combat formation, Arnold authorized a night attack, with the planes bombing individually by radar.

The raid on Yawata was the first on the Japanese home islands since the Doolittle raid of April 1942 and marked the beginning of the strategic bombardment campaign against Japan. Eight journalists and three news photographers accompanied the mission, which was led by Saunders, who, along with Engler, flew as a passenger on B-29 Superfortress 42-6274 &quot;Lady Hamilton&quot; of the 468th Bombardment Group, piloted by Captain Herman Sancken.

Takeoffs began at 16:16 local time. One plane crashed on takeoff but the crew escaped. Not so lucky were the crew of another which was launched after the main group to conduct post-attack photography that also crashed on takeoff; the whole crew died. Four planes aborted the mission and returned to Chengdu. Only forty-seven of the sixty-eight B–29s launched hit the target area: one crashed en route, six jettisoned their bombs because of mechanical difficulties, and seven bombed secondary targets or targets of opportunity. Six bombers suffered minor damage from flak, and one was lost over Yawata, 42-6230 &quot;Limber Dragon&quot;, which was shot down by a Kawasaki Ki-45 night fighter piloted by Warrant Officer Sadamitsu Kimura. One Japanese fighter reported minor damage.

On the way back to Chengdu, two B-29s crashed into mountainsides in China with the loss of all on board, including &quot;Newsweek&quot; correspondent William T. Shenkel. Another, with Time-Life photographer Harry Zinder on board, was strafed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft after making an emergency landing on the grass airstrip at Neixiang. To get his B-29s back to India, Wolfe had to borrow from the 312th Fighter Wing&#x27;s meager supply. Although B-29s sat on the ground at Chengdu unprotected for several days afterwards, there were no Japanese attacks on the bases at Chengdu.

The raid on Yawata cost seven B-29s and fifty-five crewmen. Photos of the target were taken by the Fourteenth Air Force on 8 June, which indicated that only one bomb had landed in the target area, striking a power house from the coke ovens. Press releases were factual and downplayed the damage inflicted. The existence of the Twentieth Air Force and XX Bomber Command were disclosed for the first time.

===Sasebo===
Arnold ordered a small fifteen-plane follow-up raid on Japan by 10 July to demonstrate that Yawata was the start of a bombing campaign and not a one-off like the Doolittle raid, followed by a hundred-plane attack on Manchuria by 30 July and a fifty-plane attack on Palembang as soon as the airfields in Ceylon were ready. Wolfe&#x27;s response was a counterproposal, scaling back the size of the forces to be engaged. Arnold relieved Wolfe of his command on 4 July, and promoted him to major general. Saunders assumed temporary command until Wolfe&#x27;s relief, Major General Curtis E. LeMay, could arrive.

The first of the requested missions was flown on the night of 7 July. The mission plan called for attacks on five targets on Kyushu: eighteen bombers would attack the Sasebo Naval Base; three would bomb the Akunoura engine works in Nagasaki; two would raid the nearby Omura aircraft plant; and one-plane strikes would be conducted against the steel works at Yawata and Tobata. That the likely damage would be negligible was not overlooked, but it was felt that this would be outweighed by the psychological factor. Putting 25 B-29s over Japan required 203 Hump missions and ate into the stockpile required for the hundred-plane mission to Manchuria.

Of the 28 B-29s despatched from India, two had to turn back with mechanical trouble. One plane caught fire on the ground at Chakulia and was a total loss. Seventeen planes took off from Chengdu, along with two reconnaissance aircraft detailed to photograph the Miike Dyestuffs Plant in Omuta. Eleven bombed Sasebo using radar, as cloud cover obscured the target. Single planes attacked Omura and Tobata; one plane bombed Laoyao harbor near Yawata; and another bombed Hankou, but missed the city by . No planes were lost to flak or fighters over Japan, but one ditched into the sea.

===Anshan I===
With carried across the Hump in July, the availability of aircraft now became the major limiting factor on operations. With only 127 B-29s available after some had been converted to tankers, Sanders was hard pressed to meet the Arnold&#x27;s desire for a 100-plane strike. To gather as many aircraft as possible, he pushed back the date for the operation to the end of July. This meant postponing Palembang until August, but the airfields on Ceylon were not yet ready in any case. By allocating five days for the deployment to China, aircraft that were forced to turn back could be repaired and sent out again, and additional maintenance could be performed in China. The procedure entailed some risk because the B-29s could become targets for Japanese attacks while sitting on the ground at Chengdu for up to five days.
The B-29s began making the trip to China on 25 July, and only four of the 111 despatched failed to reach China. One aircraft&#x27;s engine caught on fire after takeoff for Chakulia, and it crash landed near Midnapore; nine of the thirteen crew died. The mission was launched on 29 July. The target was the Showa Steel Works in Anshan, an important producer of coke, pig iron and steel. It produced 3,793,000 metric tons of coke annually, about a third of the Japanese Empire&#x27;s total. The 444th Bombardment Group&#x27;s base at Guanghan Airfield was rendered unserviceable by heavy rains, but 79 B-29s from the other three groups were available, and all but seven were able to take off. On crashed shortly afterwards when two engines caught fire.

Eleven aircraft developed mechanical trouble, and did not reach the target. One bombed the secondary target, the port of Qinhuangdao, two bombed the target of last resort, rail yards at Zhengxian, four attacked targets of opportunity, and four returned without bombing at all. Sixty attacked the Showa Steel Works, flying in close formation. A bomb hit a byproducts plant near the target, resulting in a cloud of dark smoke.

Flak damaged five bombers. One, &quot;Lady Hamilton&quot;, was then shot down by fighters. Eight of the crew bailed out and eventually reached Chengdu with the aid of Chinese guerrillas. Another made an emergency landing at Ankang. The Japanese attempted to destroy it on the ground while it sat there for five days, resulting in the loss of a Kawasaki Ki-48 bomber during a night raid to Fourteenth Air Force fighters. Tools, spare parts and mechanics were flown in by C-46 and the B-29 was repaired and took to the sky again on 3 August. Flak damaged one of the engines of &quot;Ramp Tramp&quot;, so it made an emergency landing in Vladivostok. The crew were interned in the Soviet Union, but were permitted to escape to Iran, along with the crews of three other B-29s that landed in the Soviet Union. The Soviets later reverse engineered the B-29 to produce the Tupolev Tu-4.

The ground at Guanghan dried out, allowing twenty-four B-29s of the 444th Bombardment Group to take to the air. It was five hours too late to participate in the attack on Anshan, so they headed for the tertiary target, the port of Taku. Five planes turned back with mechanical trouble, sixteen planes bombed Taku, and three attacked Zhengxian.

The mission was assessed as a success. At a cost of five B-29s, there were direct hits on two of the sixteen coke oven batteries and damage to a third, which was estimated would take a year to repair. At Taku two large warehouses and a collier were damaged.

===Palembang===

The Pladjoe refinery at Palembang was the source of 22 percent of Japan&#x27;s fuel oil for ships and industrial facilities, and 78 percent of its aviation gasoline, and was therefore a major target for the B-29s. Arnold wanted a 112-plane raid, but with only the airfield at China Bay available, a 50-plane raid was the best that Saunders could do. The mission was the longest flown from CBI. It had two targets: in addition to the attack on the refinery, fourteen B-29s of the 462nd Bombardment Group were detailed to drop Mark 26 aerial mines in the Moesi River. This was the first use of aerial mines by the Twentieth Air Force. This mission involved a flight of to Palembang and to the Moesi River, so maximum fuel loads were carried, which meant only a of bombs or mines.
Fifty-six B-29s of 444th and 468th Bombardment Groups arrived at China Bay on the afternoon of 9 August. The strike force began to take off from China Bay at 16:45 the next day. A total of 54 B-29s were dispatched. One of the aircraft returned to the base 40 minutes after taking off due to engine problems, it was repaired within two hours, and took off again bound for Sumatra. Eight aircraft returned to Ceylon with mechanical trouble, and six more did not bomb the primary target. Thirty-nine bombers reached their primary targets. Thirty-one attacked the refinery. The B-29 assigned to drop illumination flares did not make it, so bombing was at night through overcast. A photo reconnaissance mission could not be flown until 19 September, which made it difficult to assess the results, but it appeared than only one building had been destroyed.

Carmichael personally led the 462nd Bombardment Group&#x27;s mining mission. Eight bombers carried out the mission, laying sixteen aerial mines. Mines dropped in the river connecting Palembang to the sea sank three ships totalling and damaged four ships of . It took the Japanese almost a month to sweep the mines and open the river for maritime traffic again, which held up petroleum exports. The Japanese fighters and antiaircraft guns failed to destroy any of the American bombers, but B-29 Superfortress 42-24420 of the 444th Bombardment Group ditched when it ran out of fuel from Ceylon. One crewman died, but the rest were rescued on 12 August by the British destroyer , which homed in on their &quot;Gibson Girl&quot; beacon.

This was the only USAAF raid on the oil facilities at Palembang. No more B-29 missions were flown from Ceylon. On 24 August, the XX Bomber Command recommended that the base at China Bay be abandoned, and Twentieth Air Force concurred on 3 October.

===Nagasaki===
Only using fifty-six B-29s against Palembang left aircraft available for use elsewhere. Saunders therefore proposed a small raid on Japan. It was hoped that striking on the same day as Palembang would have a psychological impact by demonstrating that the B-29s could simultaneously attack targets thousands of miles apart. Saunders chose Nagasaki as the target, as it was an important shipbuilding, steel and munitions production area. He proposed to attack at night with incendiaries. This was the first incendiary raid on Japan.

Thirty-three B-29s from all four groups took off from India. One had to turn back with mechanical problems and another caught fire and the crew had to bail out over India. Twenty-nine bombers took off for Nagasaki. Each B-29 carried thirteen M-18 incendiary clusters and three M-26 fragmentation clusters, a total load of . Two bombers from the 40th Bombardment Group had to return early, one with an oil leak and one with radar problems. Twenty-six B-29s attacked the target. The damage inflicted was minimal. The first trial of firebombing was a failure.

No B-29s were lost over the target and one downed a Japanese fighter, the Twentieth Air Force&#x27;s first confirmed kill. Two B-29s were lost due to running out of fuel. The crew of one bailed out over China; the other landed at a forward airfield where it sank into the mud. The 312th Fighter Wing provided air cover and mechanics were flown in. The Chinese jacked the plane up and laid 4,500 railroad ties. Mechanics and the crew stripped the aircraft of non-essential equipment, and it was able to take off again on 23 August and land at Chiung Lai.

===Yawata II===
For the next mission, Saunders wanted to complete the destruction of the coke oven in Yawata. His staff debated whether the best course of action was daylight precision bombing or a night attack with incendiaries. In the end, it was decided to do both, although not by design. One innovation was to allow the group commanders to set different loads for each B-29, based upon the efficiency of the aircraft and crew. On this mission some B-29s burned as little as and some as much as , carrying an average of 6.3 bombs.
Three bombers had to return to India with mechanical trouble, two more had to land at forward airbase en route, and one crashed; the crew bailed out and were recovered by Chinese civilians. The three bombers that returned to base and one of the ones that made a forced landing were repaired and were able to rejoin the others in China. Ninety-seven bombers were then available in China, and seventy-five took off on the daylight raid. The eighth aircraft of the 462nd Bombardment Group to take off from Kuinglai crashed when its landing gear failed on takeoff, blocking the runway for the remaining thirteen aircraft. Strong winds prevented takeoff in the opposite direction, and it took six hours to clear the runway. It was therefore decided to mount a night mission. Eight of the thirteen remaining bombers were able to launch on this mission. They were joined by five bombers from the 40th and 444th Bombardment Groups that had failed to take off on the daylight raid, and one that had returned with mechanical trouble but had been repaired.

Sixty-one of the seventy-five bombers on the daylight raid found the target. They were met by intense flak from up to 166 anti-aircraft guns. Eight bombers were damaged and one, B-29 Superfortress 42-6408 &quot;Reddy Teddy&quot; of the 468th Bombardment Group, was shot down over Japan. Another, B-29 Superfortress 42-6308 &quot;Feather Merchant&quot; of the 40th Bombardment Group, was damaged by flak and fighters; all but two of the crew bailed out over friendly territory in China and were rescued by Chinese civilians. B-29 Superfortress 42-24474 &quot;Starduster&quot; of the 462nd Bombardment Group, piloted by Carmichael, was damaged by a Japanese Ki-45 fighter and crashed on Iki Island. Nine of the ten crew bailed out, but one man&#x27;s parachute did not open and another was machine gunned in the air. The remaining seven, including Carmichael, were captured and endured beatings and mistreatment in captivity. B-29 Superfortress 42-93829 &quot;Cait Paomat&quot; received flak damage over Yawata and the pilot, Major Richard McGlinn, elected to bail out over the Soviet Union rather than Japanese-occupied China. The crew of eleven became the second B-29 crew interned in the Soviet Union. That night ten more B-29s dropped bombs on Yawata. The damage assessment was dispiriting; two coke ovens had been hit. Four B-29s had been shot down and ten lost to other causes, and ninety-five aircrew were dead or missing. 

===Anshan II and III===

LeMay arrived on 20 August. He received special permission from Arnold to fly one combat mission in order to see for himself the nature of the challenges his crews faced. The mission was to Anshan again on 8 September; Arnold wanted the coke ovens put out of action. One hundred and eight of the 116 B-29s deployed to China for the raid took off and 95 of them found the target. LeMay flew on Superfortress 42-24503 &quot;Nippon Nipper II&quot;, one of five B-29s damaged by flak. Superfortress 42-6234 &quot;My Assam Dragon&quot; of the 444th Bombardment Group was shot down by Japanese fighters. Seven crew members bailed out and landed near the coast of the Bohai Sea in Changli County, where they were rescued by the local civilians. Communist troops escorted them on a journey by foot to Yan&#x27;an in Shanxi Province, where they were met by Mao Zedong. They reached the 444th Bombardment Group&#x27;s base at Guanghan Airfield on 23 January 1945.

The raid was credited with destroying two more of the coke batteries. Based on aerial photography, intelligence estimated that the two raids on Anshan had put three of the sixteen batteries out of action for at least a year, and three more for at least six months, resulting in production dropping by a third. Afterwards, LeMay stood the XX Bomber Command down for retraining while the bases in China were restocked. He introduced a series of changes to bombing, navigation and aircraft maintenance based on his experiences with the Eighth Air Force in Europe. He discarded the four-aircraft diamond formation then in use and instituted the combat box. The larger formation gave greater protection against fighters. He established a lead crew system where each group selected six lead crews. In the lead crews, the navigator would lead the entire formation and the bombardier (or radar operator in bad weather) of the lead crew would decide when to release the bombs of the whole group. When it worked, this system was superior to attacking in diamonds or individually; when it did not, all the bombs missed the target.
LeMay realised that the weather over Japan was even more uncertain than that over Europe. Even in the best month of the year, there was on average only seven days of fine weather that permitted visual bombing; in the worst month, there was just one. Accurate forecasting required weather stations on the Asian mainland, so LeMay sent a team to negotiate with Mao, who controlled part of northern China. Mao agreed to assist downed American airmen and to allow the Americans to establish a weather station at his headquarters. Mao offered to allow the Americans to build airstrips for the B-29s, but LeMay had to decline the offer because it was difficult enough to supply the airfields around Chengdu.

The XX Bomber Command followed up the raid on Anshan with a third attack on 26 September, using the combat box formation for the first time. This time 109 bombers participated, of which 88 found the primary target. Nine formations of three to sixteen bombers attacked the target, as did one solo bomber in defiance of orders that individual attacks were only to be made on secondary targets. Visibility was poor due to cloud cover over the target. Eight bombers were damaged by flak and nine by Japanese fighters. Follow-up aerial photography did not reveal any additional damage to the coke ovens. Although no bombers were lost, the COA reconsidered whether the effort was worth it: the submarine campaign against Japanese shipping was having an impact on the Japanese economy, rendering steel production less important.

==Supporting the theater commanders==
===Omura and Formosa===
On 11 October, LeMay received orders to discontinue the attacks on the petroleum and steel industries and concentrate on missions in support of the theater commanders such as shipping and aircraft and naval facilities. The next raid was therefore targeted at the Okayama aircraft repair and assembly facility in Takao Prefecture in Formosa, in support of General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s upcoming return to the Philippines in conjunction with planes from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers. This time 130 bombers took off on the mission and 103 dropped 1,035 incendiaries and 1,519 high explosive bombs on the target area. Two aircraft were lost due to mechanical problems.
A second raid on Okayama was carried out two days later. The raids were very successful. Together with the U.S. Navy carrier aircraft, the bombers destroyed 74 of the 80 buildings in the facility and 69 aircraft there. The B-29s returned to Formosa on 17 October. This time, the target was the Einansho Aircraft Depot. Only ten of the twenty-three bombers found the target due to heavy cloud cover; the remaining thirteen bombed Takao harbor.

Still in support of the Philippines operations, the XX Bomber Command attacked the Japanese Omura aircraft assembly plant in Nagasaki on 25 October. This factory made Mitsubishi A6M Zeke, Aichi B7A Grace and Mitsubishi F1M Pete aircraft and aircraft engines. Of the 79 aircraft on the raid, 59 bombed the target, using radar as it was obscured by clouds. B-29 Superfortress 42-24281 &quot;20th Century Unlimited&quot; of the 40th Bombardment Group, piloted by Captain Jack C. Ledford, was shot down but managed to crash land in China.

LeMay originally intended to stage a training mission on 4 October to hone his crews&#x27; skills in flying the new twelve-plane formations, but this had been postponed in favor of the attacks on Formosa. The training mission was finally flown on 3 November. The target was the Malegon Railway Yards in Rangoon, Burma, in support of the CBI theater. This was the primary Japanese rail yard in the area, holding up to five locomotives and three hundred rail cars at any given time. Forty-four of the forty-nine B-29s despatched found the target. Fourteen bombers were damaged by flak, and three more by other B-29s, but only one was lost; a fire forced it to ditch in the ocean, and the crew were rescued by a motor launch of the Royal Indian Navy. Two days later, seventy-six B-29s set out to attack the Admiralty IX Floating Dry Dock and King George VI Graving Dock in Singapore. Fifty-six bombed the target; ten had to turn back with mechanical problems and two crashed en route.
On 11 November, the XX Bomber Command flew another mission to Omura. A typhoon had developed over Kyushu which the Weather Office did not discern until after the bombers had taken off. In response, LeMay altered the target to Nanjing, but not all the bombers received the message. As a result, twenty-none of the ninety-six bombers attacked Omura. They were buffeted by high winds and only five planes attacked in formation. Five aircraft were lost. Superfortress 42-6365 &quot;General H. H. Arnold Special&quot;, the aircraft Arnold had personally signed, made an emergency landing in Vladivostok, Captain Weston H. Price and his crew became the third B-29 crew interned in the Soviet Union.

Ten days later, the XX Bomber Command repeated the raid on Omura. This time, 109 aircraft were launched. One B-29 crashed on takeoff; only the tail gunner survived. Sixty-one managed to find the target. Japanese fighter opposition was intense. In all, ten B-29s were lost on the mission, including Superfortress 42-6358 &quot;Ding How&quot;, piloted by First Lieutenant William Mickish, which diverted to Vladivostok. Mickish and his crew became the fourth B-29 crew to be interned in the Soviet Union. In retaliation, the Japanese staged a night attack on Chengtu; three B-29 and a C-109 were damaged, and a stock of drummed gasoline was ignited. One Japanese aircraft was shot down by a Northrop P-61 Black Widow of the 426th Night Fighter Squadron.

While fuel stocks in China were replenished after the Omura missions, LeMay launched another raid on Bangkok on 27 November. This time the target was the Bang Sue Marshalling Yard. Sixty B-29s were launched, fifteen from each group, and Fifty-five of them found the target. The skies were clear and results were good; the primary aiming points were destroyed, and nine locomotives and ninety rail cars were destroyed or damaged. One bomber, Superfortress 42-24454 &quot;Devil May Care&quot;, piloted by First Lieutenant Carl Blackwell, was damaged by a Royal Thai Air Force Nakajima Ki-43 Oscar flown by Flight Lieutenant Worrasap Therdsak. Therdsak&#x27;s fighter was damaged by B-29 gunfire, and he was forced to bail out. Although badly burned, he survived. Blackwell made for Chittagong airfield, but is believed to have crashed into the sea. No survivors or wreckage was found.
LeMay planned a third mission to Omura, but at the last minute the target was switched to Mukden on account of forecasts of bad weather. The primary target was the Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company, which mainly assembled trainer aircraft. One hundred and eight B-29 set out on the mission from Chengdu on 7 December. Although the weather was fine, it was very cold and some B-29s had trouble with icing of their plexiglas wind screen. Only twenty-one bombers struck the primary target. Seven B-29s were lost: four in combat and three from mechanical failures. The crew of Superfortress 42-63363 &quot;Marietta Misfit&quot;, piloted by Captain George Varoff, were forced to bail out of their fighter-damaged aircraft. All eleven crewmen were rescued by the Chinese communists.

Another training mission was mounted against Bangkok on 14 December. This time the primary target was the Rama VI Bridge. Rail traffic bound for Rangoon and the Burma front passed over this bridge. Each of the four groups of the XX Bomber Command despatched twelve bombers. The commander of the 40th Bombardment Group, Colonel William H. Blanchard, had his bombers loaded with a mixture of 1,000-pound TNT and 5,000-pound Composition B bombs. The latter was a far more powerful explosive and crews expressed concerns that with the Composition B bombs loaded underneath the TNT ones, that the later would fall faster and might cause the former to explode in mid-air. This indeed happened over Rangoon: four B-29 were so badly damaged that they crashed; another six made emergency landings at other airfields. One made it back to Chakulia, but with injured crewmen, one of whom died. Seventeen crewmen died and twenty-seven were held as prisoners of war in Rangoon until they were liberated by the British Army on 4 May 1945. Thirty-three B-29s attacked the bridge, which was not damaged.

=== &quot;Ichi-Go&quot; and the fire raid on Hankou ===

In April 1944, the Japanese launched Operation Ichi-Go in China, with the objective of overrunning the airfields in eastern China. To stop the Japanese advance, Chennault asked in June for the B-29s to conduct raids on Hankou. This was a major Japanese supply base. Supplies for the Japanese armies in China were shipped to Hankou via the Yangtze River, from whence they were unloaded and moved forward by rail or small vessels. It was also a major source of local procurement. As much as of supplies might be temporarily stored in Hankou on a given day. A successful attack on the city disrupt the flow of supplies to the Japanese forces in China.

Stilwell passed on Chennault&#x27;s request to the War Department, but Arnold rejected any suggestion of diverting the B-29s or stocks of supplies allocated to them. After Major General Albert C. Wedemeyer assumed command of the newly created China Theater on 31 October, he requested a 100-sortie B-29 attack on Hankou. In his view, the Japanese threat to Kunming, the terminus of the Hump route to China, was the sort of emergency under which the Joint Chiefs had said the theater commander could take control of the B-29s. LeMay demurred, as it was not in line with his orders. On 16 December, Wedemeyer wrote to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C. Marshall, and repeated the request. This time, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the mission.
The attack was planned in cooperation with the Fourteenth Air Force. Chennault had long been an advocate of using incendiary weapons on Japanese cities, and he persuaded LeMay to try a daylight raid with using incendiaries on the docks and storage areas along the Yangtze. The B-29s were therefore equipped with a mix of 100-pound M47 bombs, 500-pound M76 bombs and 500-pound M17 cluster munitions. Because a northerly wind was forecast, the B-29s would attack in four formations in succession attacking from south to north so as to avoid the target area being obscured by smoke. Two hundred Fourteenth Air Force B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers and North American P-51 Mustang fighters would then attack Japanese airfields in the area. At first LeMay only promised to send only sixty bombers, because he was in the process of withdrawing B-29s with unmodified engines from combat, but by adding some older models, he was able to provide ninety-four.

LeMay launched the mission on 18 December, with the B–29s carrying of incendiary bombs and attacking at . At the last minute, Chennault requested a 45-minute delay, but the 40th Bombardment Group did not receive the message, and as a result, the formations did not attack in the proper sequence. Eighty-four B-29s attacked Hankou, but only thirty-three bombers in the first three formations and a few in the last were on target. Despite this, the results were impressive. Large fires are columns of black smoke were observed. The attack left Hankou burning for three days. It was estimated that 30 to 40 percent of the target area was destroyed. Arnold informed the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, that more than 100 warehouses, factories and office buildings had been destroyed, and that the attack was a &quot;vital factor in limiting the speed, effectiveness and scope of Japanese operations in China.&quot; The Japanese regarded the attack as &quot;highly effective&quot;, and did not retaliate.

===Final raids from Chinese bases===

The following day, the XX Bomber Command attacked the Omura Aircraft Plant again. Only thirty-six B-29s went on this mission, as recurring engine problems had led LeMay to decide that only B-29s with recently modified engines should be flown over Japan. In the event, only seventeen bombed the primary target, all by radar as it was obscured by cloud cover. Another thirteen visually bombed the secondary target, the Kiangnan Dock and Engineering Works in Shanghai. An aerial photo reconnaissance mission showed no new damage at Omura; at Shanghai, a river steamer and several buildings were hit. No aircraft were shot down over either target, but two were lost due to engine problems that caused their crews to bail out over China. One man was killed when his parachute failed to open. In addition, Superfortress 42-6331 &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, was shot down on the way back to the base in India by a British Bristol Beaufighter night fighter. The crew bailed out, but the navigator&#x27;s parachute failed to open.

The XX Bomber Command made a follow-up raid on the Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company plant in Mukden on 21 December. Forty-nine B-29s were launched, of which forty forty found the primary target, but only nineteen bombed the plant. Frosting of the cockpit windows made it hard for the bombardiers to see, and when one mistakenly released his bombs, others in the formation followed suit. Two bombers were lost: Superfortress 42-24505 &quot;Wild Hair&quot; was downed by a pair of Nakajima Ki-44 &quot;Tojo&quot; fighters that attacked it with phosphorus bombs; and Superfortress 42-24715 &quot;Old Campaigner&quot; crashed after being rammed by an obsolete Nakajima Ki-27 &quot;Nate&quot; flown by Second Lieutenant Tahei Matsumoto. The radio operator, Staff Sergeant Elbert L. Edwards, was taken prisoner by the Japanese. He discovered that he was the sole survivor when they asked him why he was the only member of the crew to bail out.
On 2 January 1945, another training mission was flown against the Rama VII Bridge in Bangkok. Forty-nine B-29 were despatched, of which forty-four bombed the target visually. It remained undamaged. No aircraft were lost. Four days later, the XX Bomber Command attacked attacked the Omura again. This time, the primary visual target was the Tachiarai Machine Works; the Omura Aircraft Plant was the primary radar target. The Tachiarai Machine Works assembled Mitsubishi Ki-15 &quot;Babs&quot; light bombers. While not the most significant aircraft plant in Japan, it was within convenient range of the Chengdu-based B-29s. The mission plant called for sixty aircraft, but only forty-nine took off, and only twenty-eight bombed the target. It was estimated that the 40th Bombardment Group&#x27;s aircraft missed the target by about . One B-29 was lost: Superfortress 42-265254 &quot;Rush Order&quot; was shot down by Japanese fighters and crashed in the Yellow Sea.
Another mission was flown against Formosa in support of the American landings at Lingayen Gulf on Luzon in the Philippines, in concert with the aircraft carriers of the US Navy&#x27;s Task Force 38. Heito Airfield was the primary visual target and Keelung Harbor the primary radar target. Forty-six aircraft set out. Due to cloud cover over Heito Airfield, thirty-nine B-29s Keelung Harbor. Seven bombers of the 40th Bombardment Group attacked the airfield but dropped their bombs short due to a malfunction in the bomb release mechanism of the lead aircraft. No aircraft were lost. Two days later, the XX Bomber Command launched a follow-up raid on Singapore. This had been deferred due to poor weather conditions there in November and December. Forty-seven B-29s were launched, of which sixteen attacked the Admiralty IX Floating Dry Dock and nine bombed the King George VI Graving Dock. Neither was damaged. Two aircraft were lost to engine trouble. The crew of Superfortress 42-24704 &quot;The Gear Box&quot;, piloted by Major Donald J. Humphrey, bailed out over Malaya: three died, four were captured by the Japanese (one of whom later died in captivity), and four, including Humphrey, evaded capture with the help of Malayan communist guerrillas.
The fast-paced January mission schedule came at a cost in fatigue among the maintenance and armament crews. An accident occurred on 14 January when cluster bombs were being unloaded from Superfortress 42-24582 &quot;Little Clambert&quot; at Chakulia. A cluster broke and one or more bombs fell from the rear bomb rack and struck a concrete doughnut. This started a fire in the bomb bay where there were other cluster bombs. A crew rushed to extinguish the flames and other personnel ran to assist. The bombs in the bomb exploded and nine men were killed and twenty-one injured. Not only was &quot;Little Clambert&quot; destroyed but nearby Superfortress 42-63394 &quot;Last Resort&quot; was so badly damaged it was written off, and there was damage to four other B-29s and a B-24.

On 14 January, the XX Bomber Command flew another mission to Formosa. This time, the primary visual target was Shinchiku Airfield, with the Heito Air Arsenal and Kagi Airfield as alternates. Eighty-two B-29s were launched from Chegdu. En route, LeMay switched the primary target to Kagi Airfield. Fifty-four B-29s bombed Kagi Airfield. Nine B-29s from the 40th Bombardment Group bombed Taichu Airfield after mistaking it for Kagi, as did three B-29s from the 462nd Bombardment Group. Nonetheless, there was considerable damage to Kagi Airfield. Aerial photo reconnaissance showed damage to nine hangars and eleven barracks buildings had been destroyed by fire. An estimated sixteen Japanese aircraft had been destroyed on the ground. No B-29s were lost.

Three days later, the XX Bomber Command struck Formosa again, with Shinchiku Airfield as the primary target. This time, ninety-five B-29s took off, of which seventy-eight found the target. One B-29 was lost. Superfortress 42-24484 &quot;Mary Ann&quot; had an engine failure and the pilot, Major Clarence C. MacPherson, elected to return to Pengshan Airfield. A second engine then had a runaway propeller. The bombardier released the bomb load about six miles out, but, although the bomb arming pins had been removed, the bombs exploded and shrapnel damaged the rudder cables and damaged the tail. MacPherson then ordered the crew to bail out. All eleven did so, but the plane was too low and four were killed when they hit the ground. This was the last mission flown from Chengdu.

==End of Matterhorn==
On 24 November 1944, American bombers commenced raiding Japan from the Mariana Islands, making operations from the increasingly vulnerable and always logistically difficult China bases redundant. On 4 December, Wedemeyer asked for the B-29s to be withdrawn from his theater. They consumed 14 percent of Hump tonnage in December, and Wedemeyer contended that in view of the critical situation in China, these resources would be better allocated to the Chinese ground forces and the Fourteenth Air Force to help stem the Japanese offensive. It would also release the 312th Fighter Wing from its defensive mission. Wedemeyer repeated his recommendation on 12 January 1945. Four days later, the Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the XX Bomber Command to move to its home stations in India.
LeMay departed for the Marianas on 18 January 1945 to assume command of the XXI Bomber Command, leaving the XX Bomber Command in India in the hands of Brigadier General Roger M. Ramey, who became its fourth commander in a year. Brigadier General Joseph Smith became his chief of staff. The staff had anticipated the order to withdraw from China, and by 27 January, the XX Bomber Command had abandoned its bases there. This marked the end of Operation Matterhorn. Between January and March, Ramey&#x27;s B–29s assisted Mountbatten&#x27;s British and Indian ground forces in Burma by targeting rail and port facilities in Indochina, Thailand, and Burma. More distant targets included refineries and airfields in Singapore, Malaya, as well as Palembang and other locations in the Netherlands East Indies.

On 6 February, the War Department issued orders for the B-29s to redeploy to the Mariana Islands. The 312th Fighter Wing was reassigned to the Fourteenth Air Force on 8 February, leaving the 58th Bomb Wing, which was reactivated on the same day, as the only operational wing of the XX Bomber Command. The first water echelon, consisting of 2,275 men, sailed from Calcutta on 27 February. They were followed by an advance air echelon on 20 March. Four cargo ships loaded with equipment departed between 25 March and 4 April. An air echelon of 90 aircraft carrying 1,330 airmen flew to Tinian in the Marianas via Lüliang on 20 April; a second, of another 90 aircraft and 1,620 airmen, flew to Guam on 1 May. The last water echelon, consisting of 3,459 men, left on 6 May. The last shipment arrived in the Marianas on 6 June. The whole movement was accomplished without the loss of a single aircraft.

==Combat missions==
== Assessment ==
The American Bomber Summary Survey states that &quot;Approximately 800 tons of bombs were dropped by China-based B-29s on Japanese home island targets from June 1944 to January 1945. These raids were of insufficient weight and accuracy to produce significant results.&quot; It concluded that the B-29s &quot;could have been more effectively used in coordination with submarines for search, low-level attacks and mining in accelerating the destruction of Japanese shipping, or in destroying oil and metal plants in the southern areas, than in striking the Japanese &#x27;Inner Zone&#x27; from China bases.&quot; This was hardly hindsight; the use of the B-29s in this manner had been recommended by the Navy and MacArthur and his air commander, Lieutenant General George C. Kenney, from the Southwest Pacific Area in November 1943. But Arnold and his USAAF staff were intent on bombing Japan.

The XX Bomber Command failed to achieve the strategic objectives that the planners had intended for Operation Matterhorn, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber&#x27;s mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities. Although the B-29s achieved some success when diverted to support Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s forces in China, MacArthur&#x27;s offensives in the Philippines, and Mountbatten&#x27;s efforts in the Burma campaign, they generally accomplished little more than the B-17s and B-24s of the Fifth, Tenth Air Force, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Air Forces.

Chennault considered the Twentieth Air Force a liability and thought that its supplies of fuel and bombs could have been used more profitably by the Fourteenth Air Force. The XX Bomber Command consumed almost 15 percent of the Hump tonnage per month during Matterhorn. Wedemeyer agreed. The two were happy to see the B–29s leave China and India. Despite those objections, Matterhorn did benefit the Allied war effort. Using the China bases bolstered Chinese morale and allowed the strategic bombing of Japan to begin six months before bases were available in the Marianas. The Matterhorn raids against the Japanese home islands demonstrated the B–29&#x27;s effectiveness against Japanese fighters and anti-aircraft artillery. Operations from the Marianas profited from the streamlined organization and improved tactics developed on the Asian mainland.
