==Early life==
Ehnes was born in Brandon, Manitoba, the son of Alan Ehnes, long time trumpet professor at Brandon University (Canada), and Barbara Withey Ehnes, former ballerina with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, Ruth Page&#x27;s International Ballet, and Chicago Ballet, and former director of the Brandon School of Dance. Ehnes began his violin studies at the age of four and at age nine became a protégé of the noted Canadian violinist Francis Chaplin. He studied with Sally Thomas at the Meadowmount School of Music and from 1993 to 1997 at The Juilliard School, winning the Peter Mennin Prize for Outstanding Achievement and Leadership in Music upon his graduation.

James Ehnes toured with Jeunesses Musicales Canada during the 1992–1993 season, when he was only 16 years old.

==Career==
Ehnes has performed with all of the major orchestras in North America including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony in the U.S., as well as the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, and the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Canada.

In Europe he has performed as soloist with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, the London Symphony Orchestra, London&#x27;s Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Philharmonic, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Ulster Orchestra, the Munich Philharmonic, the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie, the Orchestre National de Lyon, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, the Budapest Festival Orchestra, the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, plus many others.

In October 2005, he was awarded a Doctor of Music degree (honoris causa) from Brandon University and in July 2007 he became the youngest person ever elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2010, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

Ehnes performs on the 1715 &quot;ex-Marsick&quot; Stradivarius. His commercial recordings have won many awards and prizes, including 11 Junos, two Grammies, and two Gramophone Classical Music Awards - 2008 Best Concerto for Edward Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto - 2021 Artist of the Year.

Ehnes was awarded the 2017 Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards in the Instrumentalist category.

Ehnes joined the Royal Academy of Music as visiting professor of violin in 2017.

Ehnes joined The Indiana University Jacobs School of Music faculty as a professor of practice in violin as of August 1, 2024.

Ehnes is artistic director of the Seattle Chamber Music Society. He and violinist Amy Schwartz Moretti, violist Che-Yen Chen, and cellist Edward Arron perform as the Ehnes Quartet.

==Personal life==
Ehnes lives in Ellenton, Florida with his wife and two children.

In a 2009 interview, they asked &quot;Living in Florida, do you have American citizenship?&quot; Ehnes said &quot;I have dual. My parents are Americans. When they moved to Brandon, Manitoba in 1973, they never expected to stay. But it was a great place to live, so they’ve been there ever since.&quot;

<doc id="1197006" wikidata="Q655130" url="?curid=1197006" title="SS and police leader">
<text>The title of SS and Police Leader (&quot;&quot;) designated a senior Nazi Party official who commanded various components of the SS and the German uniformed police (&quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;), before and during World War II in the German Reich proper and in the occupied territories.

== Levels ==
Three levels of subordination were established for holders of this title:

* SS and Police Leader (&quot;SS- und Polizeiführer&quot;, SSPF)
* Higher SS and Police Leader (&quot;Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer&quot;, HSSPF)
* Supreme SS and Police Leader (&quot;Höchster SS- und Polizeiführer&quot;, HöSSPF)

== Establishment ==
The office of &quot;Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer&quot; (Higher SS and Police Leader, HSSPF) was authorized by a decree of 13 November 1937, signed by Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick. This decree authorized the creation of HSSPF in each of the 13 German armed forces &quot;Wehrkreise&quot; (Military Districts) in the German Reich, but only in the event of mobilization. At that time, the HSSPF would serve as deputies to Heinrich Himmler, the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; and Chief of the German Police, for the purpose of coordinating and integrating all local and regional SS and police formations into the defense organization of the Reich. The first HSSPF activated were those appointed in the &quot;Wehrkreise&quot; bordering Austria during the &quot;Anschluss&quot; crisis in March 1938, and Czechoslovakia during the summer and autumn of the same year.

Appointments to these posts came from the ranks of existing &quot;SS-Oberabschnitte&quot; &quot;Führer&quot; (SS Main District Leaders), and in nearly all instances they held both positions simultaneously. The &quot;Oberabschnitte&quot; were the SS commands in each of the &quot;Wehrkreise&quot;. The purpose of the Higher SS and Police Leader was to be a direct command authority for every SS and police unit in these given geographical regions, answering only to Himmler and, through him, to Adolf Hitler. They were to act as Himmler&#x27;s chief liaison to, and unifier of, all SS and police components in a region.

After the March 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot; when Austria was absorbed into the German Reich, two new &quot;Wehrkreise&quot; and corresponding HSSPF were established there as well. Likewise, after the October 1939 conquest of Poland, two additional &quot;Wehrkreise&quot; and corresponding HSSPF were created for those Polish areas that were directly incorporated into the Reich.

In all other occupied territories, no &quot;Wehrkreise&quot; were established, so the HSSPF were independent commands with several subordinate &quot;SS- und Polizeiführer&quot; (SS and Police Leader, SSPF) commands reporting to them. These positions were created beginning in November 1939 to assist the HSSPF in administering the large areas under their jurisdiction. 

Finally, in the autumn of 1943, Himmler created two &quot;Höchster SS- und Polizeiführer&quot; (Supreme SS and Police Leader, HöSSPF) posts with jurisdiction over very large territories; these were &quot;Italien&quot; (1943–1945) and &quot;Ukraine&quot; (1943–1944), each of which had both HSSPF and SSPF reporting to them.

== Operations ==
The SS and Police Leaders directly commanded a headquarters staff with representatives from almost every branch of the SS and the police. This typically included the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Orpo; regular police), SiPo (security police) including the Gestapo (secret police), &quot;Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS-TV; Nazi concentration camps), SD (intelligence service), and certain units of the Waffen-SS (combat units). Most of the HSSPF normally held the rank of SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; or above, and answered directly to Himmler in all matters pertaining to the SS within their area of responsibility. Most SSPF normally held the rank of SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; or SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; and reported to their HSSPF. The role of all SS and Police Leaders was to be part of the SS control mechanism within their jurisdiction, policing the population and overseeing the activities of the SS men within each respective district. The HSSPF could bypass the chain of command of the administrative offices for the SS, SD, SiPo, SS-TV and Orpo in their district under the &quot;guise of an emergency situation&quot;, thereby gaining direct operational control of these groups.

Himmler authorized SS and Police Bases (&quot;SS- und Polizeistützpunkte&quot;) to be established in occupied Poland and occupied areas of the Soviet Union. They were to be &quot;armed industrialized agricultural complexes&quot; to maintain order where they were established. This did not go beyond the planning stage.

In 1944 and 1945, many HSSPF were promoted to their corresponding general&#x27;s rank in the Waffen-SS by Himmler. This was apparently an attempt to provide potential protection for them, by giving them combatant status under the Hague Convention rules of warfare.

== War crimes and crimes against humanity==

The SS and Police Leaders were key figures in many of the war crimes committed by SS personnel. The HSSPF served as commanding SS generals for any &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (death squads) operating in their area. This entailed ordering the deaths of tens of thousands of persons. In addition, they launched anti-partisan operations and directed police units to acquire forced labor for war-related projects.

The SS and Police Leaders were the overseeing authority of the Jewish ghettos in Poland and directly coordinated deportations to Nazi extermination camps. They had direct command over Order Police battalions and SD regiments that were assigned to guard the ghettos. The HSSPF regularly provided SS and police guards and other support personnel for the transports to the death camps, and also negotiated with the agencies and ministries of the Reich for rolling stock, supplies and provisions, rail schedules, and an array of other requirements necessary to keep the roundups and the death trains moving efficiently. And, in the satellite and client states, the HSSPF negotiated directly with the puppet or collaborationist governments to hand over their Jews for deportation to the East. Finally, the HSSPF were also directly involved in the construction and operation of the extermination camps. Following the end of the war, many SS and Police Leaders, particularly those who had served in Poland and the Soviet Union, either committed suicide or were charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity.

==Tables==
There were two HöSSPF commands and 38 HSSPF commands, 19 in the Reich and 19 in the occupied lands. Most of these had several different commanders over the lifetime of the post. Similarly, there were 49 SSPF commands subordinated to those HSSPF leaders in the occupied territories, also with multiple commanders over the years. Some of these areas were renamed, merged, or dissolved during the duration of their existence, particularly as German military control over the eastern territories was relentlessly eroded later in the war. 

The tables below provide as complete an accounting of the SS and police commands and their leaders as is known. They list the permanent appointees, but omit any substitutes who temporarily acted in that capacity when the incumbent was on leave or on another assignment.

<text>Hwang Jang-lee (; born 21 December 1944) is a South Korean martial artist and actor best known for his Hong Kong martial arts films. He is a ninth-dan grandmaster in Tang Soo Do and Taekwondo who began training in 1957. Prior to his acting career, Hwang was a martial arts instructor for the Korean military in Vietnam.

Hwang began his acting career in 1974. In 1976, he was offered employment in Hong Kong by Ng See-yuen, where he appeared in the kung fu film &quot;Secret Rivals&quot; as the villain Silver Fox, a role he reprised in several other films, most notably &quot;Secret Rivals 2&quot; (1977). He gained prominence for appearing in the films &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (1978) and &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1978), both opposite Jackie Chan, and &quot;Hitman in the Hand of Buddha&quot; (1981), which marked his directorial debut. He collaborated with Hong Kong filmmaker Corey Yuen on several films, including &quot;Snuff Bottle Connection&quot;, &quot;Secret Rivals 2&quot;, &quot;The Invincible Armour&quot; (all 1977), &quot;Dance of the Drunk Mantis&quot; (1979), &quot;Ninja in the Dragon&#x27;s Den&quot; (1982), and &quot;Millionaires Express&quot; (1986). His other films include &quot;Hell&#x27;s Wind Staff&quot;, &quot;Buddha Assassinator&quot; (both 1979), &quot;Two Fists Against the Law&quot; (1980), and &quot;Game of Death II&quot; (1981).

Hwang is a martial arts instructor with the World Tang Soo Do General Federation and serves as technical adviser. Among his most notable students is Roy Horan, who appeared with Hwang in several films.

==Early life==
Hwang was born in Aomori, Honshu Island, Japan to Korean parents. His father owned a shipping company and moved his family back to Korea when Hwang was a baby.

==Martial arts and philosophy==
Hwang began learning Taekwondo from age 14 and received a seventh dan (rank) black belt. In 1965 at age 21, he became a martial arts instructor for the Korean and South Vietnamese armies, specializing in taekwondo. In addition, he holds a ninth dan rank with the World Tang Soo Do General Federation.

Hwang still teaches martial arts. He is an instructor with the World Tang Soo Do General Federation and serves as technical adviser. Among his most notable students is Roy Horan, who appeared with Hwang in several films and also directed the instructional video series &quot;The Art of High Impact Kicking&quot; (1982), based on Hwang&#x27;s taekwondo techniques. In 2013, Hwang completed a tour of the U.S. and Canada in which he, along with other Korean Grandmasters, promoted the study and practice of traditional martial arts.

Stressing powerful kicks coming from the hips, Hwang said, &quot;You know my legs are just normal, there&#x27;s nothing special about them. When I train I always use my hips, use the circular motion… the hips is where the power comes from. Then I kick like this… and like this… it&#x27;s all coming from the hips.&quot;

He considers Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, Lo Lieh, Ti Lung, and Sammo Hung as the top five kung-fu fighters.

A critic of Olympic Taekwondo, Hwang has stated: &quot;You know this is very different, Taekwondo, you know, it&#x27;s for killing people… Taekwondo in the Olympics, it&#x27;s a sport, you know, it&#x27;s not a martial arts, so I don&#x27;t really like this style. For me Taekwondo is a martial art.&quot;

===Acting===
Hwang began his acting career in Korea. In 1976, Ng See-yuen offered Hwang employment in Hong Kong, where he first appeared in &quot;Secret Rivals&quot; as the villain Silver Fox. Hwang had major roles in many martial arts movies, usually playing the villaine. His nicknames &quot;King of the Legfighters&quot; and &quot;Thunder Leg&quot; attest to his use of his legs in a particular way.

In the mid-1970s, Hwang appeared in two Jackie Chan movies, &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; as Sheng Kuan and &quot;Drunken Master&quot; as Thunderfoot (Thunder Leg). In 2002, writer-producer Mike Leeder interviewed Hwang for the Contender Hong Kong Legends DVD series.

===Directing===
In 1981, Hwang directed his first movie, &quot;Hitman in the Hand of Buddha&quot; and was credited as Wong Chin.

===Other work and retirement from acting===
In 1987, Hwang trained German actor Matthias Hues in preparation for the latter&#x27;s film debut as Yuri the Russian in &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender 2&quot;. Cast at the suggestion of producer Roy Horan, a student of Hwang, Hues had no martial arts experience and trained under Hwang. Hues enjoyed the experience so much that upon arrival in Los Angeles, he continued training in martial arts throughout his career. In the film, Hwang&#x27;s opening scene of a firing squad was cut from the U.S. version. Hwang would play Yuri&#x27;s enforcer, Gen. Ty, who engages in a brief fight against Cynthia Rothrock.

In 1989, taekwondo grandmaster Jun Chong invited Hwang to the U.S. to appear as a villain in the film &quot;Street Soldiers&quot;. To bring an international flavor to the movie, Hwang is credited as Jason Hwang, using his son&#x27;s name. In the early 1990s, Hwang returned to South Korea, where he ran a golf tee manufacturer and a hotel in Seoul. He later managed a private security agency. He has since made occasional film appearances such as in &quot;Emperor of the Underworld&quot; (1994) and &quot;Boss&quot; (1996). In July 1996, Hwang retired from acting at age 51.

===Return to acting===
After a long absence from acting, Hwang in 2009 appeared in the TV series &quot;The Return of Iljimae&quot;. He was also featured in the documentary &quot;The Anonymous King,&quot; in which Jon James Hodson examines Hwang&#x27;s personal life in Seoul, Korea and Hong Kong.

<doc id="1197012" wikidata="Q1077414" url="?curid=1197012" title="Larry Murphy (ice hockey)">
<text>Lawrence Thomas Murphy (born March 8, 1961) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He played over 20 years in the National Hockey League, suiting up for the Los Angeles Kings, Washington Capitals, Minnesota North Stars, Pittsburgh Penguins, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Detroit Red Wings.

He won two back-to-back Stanley Cup championships, the first of two being with Pittsburgh in 1991 and 1992; and then with Detroit in 1997 and 1998. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

He currently serves as a studio analyst and fill-in color commentator during away games for the Red Wings on Bally Sports Detroit.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Murphy played in the 1974 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Shopsy&#x27;s minor ice hockey team.

After a stellar junior career with the Peterborough Petes and representing Canada at the 1980 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Murphy was drafted 4th overall in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings. In the 1980–81 NHL season, he set National Hockey League records for most assists and points by a rookie defenceman, with 60 and 76 respectively. He was eventually traded to the Washington Capitals for defenceman Brian Engblom and winger Ken Houston early in the 1983–84 season, which did not work out in the Kings&#x27; favor long-term because of Murphy&#x27;s prolonged success in the league.

In his 21-season career (1980–2001), Murphy would eventually play for six different NHL teams. In addition to the Kings and Capitals, he also suited up for the Minnesota North Stars, Pittsburgh Penguins, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Detroit Red Wings.

In 1995, after being named an NHL second-team All-Star, in the off-season, Murphy was traded to his hometown Leafs from the Penguins for Dmitri Mironov and a second round pick. Leafs fans booed Murphy, the highest paid player on the Leafs, mercilessly as a scapegoat for the lack of success the team was having. He was traded to Detroit for future considerations, and was an integral part of their two consecutive Stanley Cups in 1997 and 1998. In the 1997–98 NHL Playoffs, he tied Paul Coffey&#x27;s record for most shorthanded goals scored by a defenceman in the playoffs with 2.

When Murphy retired after the 2000–01 NHL season, his 1615 regular season games played stood as a record for the most career games by a defenceman; a mark previously held by Tim Horton. In 2003–04, Scott Stevens of the New Jersey Devils surpassed this mark, finishing the season with 1635 games played.

He was on four Stanley Cup winning teams during the decade of the 1990s, the only NHL player to accomplish this feat. He was a part of the only 2 NHL teams to win back-to-back titles during the decade, the Penguins in 1991 and 1992 and the Red Wings in 1997 and 1998.

In addition to his NHL championships, Murphy also won a Memorial Cup with the Peterborough Petes in 1979. The Petes also reached the championship game the following year, but lost in overtime.

In 1987, Murphy was a key member of Canada&#x27;s championship team in the Canada Cup. His six assists tied teammate Ray Bourque for tops in the tournament among defencemen, which included Mario Lemieux&#x27;s overtime goal in game 2 of the Final against the Soviet Union. He then scored a goal and two assists in the decisive third game, and was also used as a decoy by Wayne Gretzky on Lemieux&#x27;s tournament winner.

He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004. Finishing his career with 1216 points, Murphy is currently the fifth highest scoring defenceman in NHL history, behind Ray Bourque, Paul Coffey, Al MacInnis and Phil Housley.

One of Murphy&#x27;s most notable successes was the &quot;Murphy Dump&quot;. During his stint with the Pittsburgh Penguins, Murphy would often dump the puck down the ice by lifting it high over the opposing team so that it eventually stopped before the opposing goal line. This would not only clear the zone safely, but would not result in an icing call. The &quot;Murphy Dump&quot; was officially coined by Penguins broadcaster Mike Lange.

==Broadcasting==
He was an alternate color commentator for the Detroit Red Wings during West Coast road trips on Fox Sports Detroit, filling-in for Mickey Redmond. From 2003 to 2006, he shared this duty with former teammate Pat Verbeek. However, following the 2005–06 NHL season, Verbeek left the job as broadcaster to become a scout for the Red Wings, and Murphy took over full-time on west coast road trips. In addition in 2006, Murphy started contributing as a studio analyst on pregame, postgame, and intermissions in which he does not broadcast. In the 2007–08 season, Murphy began serving as a &quot;Between-the-Benches&quot; reporter for Fox Sports Detroit when Mickey Redmond was broadcasting home games and fill-in for him when he had surgery to remove a tumor on his lung. He also made occasional appearances on the NHL Network&#x27;s nightly hockey highlight show, &quot;NHL on the Fly&quot;. In March 2013, Fox Sports Detroit announced that he was fired after being told they weren&#x27;t satisfied with ratings. On February 14, 2019, it was announced Murphy returned to the team on Fox Sports Detroit in the same capacity for the rest of the 2018–19 season, joining Chris Osgood.

<doc id="1197014" wikidata="Q1234227" url="?curid=1197014" title="Luis Sotelo">
<text>Luis Sotelo, OFM, in English known also as Louis Sotelo, (September 6, 1574 – August 25, 1624) was a Franciscan friar from Spain who died as a martyr in Japan, in 1624, and was beatified by Pope Pius IX in 1867.

==Early life==
Luis was born to a noble family in Sevilla, Spain, and studied at the University of Salamanca before entering the convent of &quot;Calvario de los Hermanos Menores&quot;. He became a Franciscan Friar and was ordained a priest. In 1600 he was sent to the Philippines to prepare for missionary work. There he was assigned to serve the spiritual needs of the Japanese settlement of Dilao, which was destroyed by Spanish forces, in 1608, after intense fighting.

In 1608, Pope Paul V authorized Dominicans and Franciscans to evangelize in Japan, heretofore the preserve of the Jesuits. Sotelo spent four years in Manila, learning the Japanese language before going to Japan and taking a leading role there.

== Proselytism in Edo==
Sotelo tried to establish a Franciscan church in the area of Edo (present-day Tokyo). The church was destroyed in 1612, following the interdiction of Christianity in the territories of the Tokugawa shogunate on April 21, 1612. After a period of intense missionary activity by the Catholic Church, Tokugawa Hidetada, the second &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa dynasty, issued a decree which banned the practice and teaching of the Christian faith, and under the threat of loss of life, all the missionaries had to leave Japan. This decree started the bloody persecution of Christians, which lasted several decades.
After the healing in Edo of a concubine of the powerful &quot;daimyō&quot; of Sendai, Date Masamune, Sotelo was invited to the northern part of Japan, in the area controlled by Date, under whom Christianity was still allowed. He came back to Tokyo the following year and constructed and inaugurated a new church on May 12, 1613, in the area of Asakusa Torigoe. The Bakufu reacted by arresting the Christians, and Sotelo himself was put in the Kodenma-chō (小伝馬町) prison. Seven fellow Japanese Christians, who had been arrested with Sotelo, were executed on July 1, but he was freed following a special request by Date Masamune.

==Embassy project==
Sotelo, fluent in Japanese, planned and acted as translator on a Japanese embassy sent by Date Masamune to Spain on October 28, 1613. The embassy was headed by Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga, and crossed the Pacific to Acapulco on board the Japanese-built (with assistance from European sailors) galleon &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;. The embassy continued to Veracruz and Sanlucar de Barrameda, Seville, and Madrid. Sotelo had the Japanese receive baptism in Madrid, before accompanying them to see Pope Paul V in Rome.

The embassy was a product of ambitions of Sotelo to increase the spread of the church in Japan and of Date Masamune to provide more priests to man the churches of his Christian subjects and to establish trade between Sendai and New Spain, and it had the approval of the &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Ieyasu.

Sotelo remained for a full year in Madrid, along with the rest of the embassy. The return journey was delayed because Christianity was being harshly repressed in Japan, and because he was awaiting consecration as second Bishop of Japan. Pope Paul V had appointed him as such, pending the approval of the King of Spain, but, primarily because of rivalries between Franciscans and Jesuits, he was never consecrated. However, the Catholic Council of the Indies sent him back to Nueva España in 1618, to pursue his missionary activities there. Most of the Japanese samurai sent with the mission, who had converted to Christianity, remained at Coria del Río, near Seville, where their descendants live to this day. 

Sotelo accompanied ambassador Hasekura and the remains of the embassy back to Veracruz and Acapulco, where the San Juan Bautista, requested by the outgoing Viceroy of the Philippines to convey him to the Philippines before returning to Sendai, diverted their course to Manila, arriving there in 1620.

The ambassadors&#x27; plan to return to Sendai from Manila was obstructed first by pirates and contrary winds. When Hasekura finally was able to return, the Spanish authorities impounded Sotelo in Manila, having no desire to stir up conflict with the Portuguese Jesuit mission in Macao by allowing a second, rival Franciscan bishop to be consecrated in Sendai, in addition to the existing Jesuit Bishop of Japan, previously ruling the diocese of Funai (Nagasaki). Date Masamune had wanted to trade with Nueva España (Mexico), but it soon became apparent that the policy of &quot;sakoku&quot; (the late-1613 closure of Japan to outside influences except for very carefully controlled trade through south-western ports), along with Spanish insistence that all trade to the East be channelled through the Philippines, would make this impossible.

== Return to Japan and Martyrdom ==
When Masamune Date sent a ship to collect him from the Philippines in order to bring him back to Sendai, the Spanish authorities forbade Sotelo to board it and would not allow him to make his own boat and sail there. He finally managed to enter Japan in 1622 and was turned over to the authorities by Chinese merchants when he was discovered on their ship. He was imprisoned for two years at Ōmura, north of Nagasaki, while the &quot;shōgun&quot; deliberated on his case. In the local prison, he joined Pedro Vásquez, Miguel de Carvalho and two Japanese Franciscans, Ludovicus Sasada and tertiary Ludovicus Baba. Sotelo was burned at the stake in Ōmura, on 25 August 1624, at the age of 50, together with his religious companions.

He was beatified by Pope Pius IX on 7 July 1867. In the Roman Catholic Church, his feast day is celebrated on 25 August, as well as 10 September, the anniversary of the massacre of 205 Japanese martyrs.

<doc id="1197020" wikidata="Q51650" url="?curid=1197020" title="People's Crusade">
<text>The People&#x27;s Crusade was the beginning phase of the First Crusade whose objective was to retake the Holy Land, and Jerusalem in particular, from Islamic rule. In 1095, after the head of the Roman Catholic Church Pope Urban II started to urge faithful Christians to undertake an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the People&#x27;s Crusade was conducted for roughly six months from April to October 1096. It is also known as the Peasants&#x27; Crusade, Paupers&#x27; Crusade or the Popular Crusade as it was executed by a mainly untrained peasant army prior to the main church-organized crusade. It was led primarily by Peter the Hermit with forces of Walter Sans Avoir. The peasant army of this crusade was destroyed by the forces of the Seljuk Turks under Kilij Arslan at the Battle of Civetot in northwestern Anatolia. 

The People&#x27;s Crusade was the first, largest, and best documented of the popular crusades. The start of the more official and fully church-backed crusade, called the &quot;Princes&#x27; Crusade&quot;, occurred a few months later and was better organized, better armed, and better funded; it was also successful.

== Background ==

Calling for a crusade at the Council of Clermont in 1095, Pope Urban II planned the departure of the crusade for 15 August 1096. Nevertheless, a number of unexpected bands of peasants and low-ranking knights organized and set off for Jerusalem on their own. The peasant population had been afflicted by drought, famine, and disease for many years before 1096, and some of them seem to have envisioned the crusade as an escape from these hardships. Spurring them on had been a number of meteorological occurrences beginning in 1095 that seemed to be a divine blessing for the movement: a meteor shower, aurorae, a lunar eclipse, and a comet, among other events. An outbreak of ergotism had also occurred just before the Council of Clermont. Millenarianism, the belief that the end of the world was imminent, popular in the early 11th century, experienced a resurgence in popularity. The response was beyond expectations: while Urban might have expected a few thousand knights, he ended up with a migration numbering up to 100,000 Crusaders of mostly unskilled fighters, including women and children. 

A charismatic monk and powerful orator named Peter the Hermit of Amiens was the spiritual leader of the movement. He was known for riding a donkey and dressing in simple clothing. He had vigorously preached the crusade throughout northern France and Flanders. He claimed to have been appointed to preach by Christ himself (and supposedly had a divine letter to prove it), and it is likely that some of his followers thought he, not Urban, was the true originator of the crusading idea. It is often believed that Peter&#x27;s army was a band of illiterate, incompetent peasants who had no idea where they were going, and who believed that every city of any size they encountered on their way was Jerusalem itself; this may have been true for some, but the long tradition of pilgrimages to Jerusalem ensured that the location and distance of the city were well known. While the majority were unskilled in fighting, there were some well-trained minor knights leading them, such as Walter Sans-Avoir (also mistakenly known as Walter the Penniless), who was experienced in warfare.

==Massacre of Jews in Central Europe==
In the late spring and summer of 1096, crusaders destroyed most of the Jewish communities along the Rhine in a series of unprecedentedly large pogroms in France and Germany in which thousands of Jews were massacred, driven to suicide, or forced to convert to Christianity. Twelve Jews were murdered in Speyer, where the Bishop saved the rest of the Jews, but in the Worms massacre some 800 were murdered. In Mainz, over 1,000 Jews were murdered, as well as more in Trier, Metz, Cologne, and elsewhere. Others were subjected to forced baptism and conversion. The preacher Folkmar and Emicho of Flonheim were the main inciters and leaders of the massacre. The major chroniclers of the 1096 killings are Solomon bar Simson and Albert of Aachen.

Estimates of the number of Jewish men, women, and children murdered or driven to suicide by crusaders vary, ranging from 2,000 to 12,000. Norman Cohn puts the number at between 4,000 and 8,000 from May to June 1096. Gedaliah ibn Yahya estimated that some 5,000 Jews were killed from April to June 1096. Edward H. Flannery&#x27;s estimate is that 10,000 were murdered over the longer January-to-July period, &quot;probably one-fourth to one-third of the Jewish population of Germany and Northern France at that time.&quot; The clergy and nobility of Europe condemned the killing of Jews, and forbade it on subsequent crusades.

== Walter and the French ==
Peter gathered his army at Cologne on 12 April 1096, planning to stop there and preach to the Germans and gather more crusaders. The French, however, were not willing to wait for Peter and the Germans and under the leadership of Walter Sans Avoir, a few thousand French crusaders left before Peter and reached Hungary on 8 May, passing through Hungary without incident and arriving at the river Sava at the border of the Byzantine territory at Belgrade. The Belgrade commander was taken by surprise, having no orders on what to do with them, and refused entry, forcing the crusaders to pillage the countryside for food. This resulted in skirmishes with the Belgrade garrison and, to make matters worse, sixteen of Walter&#x27;s men had tried to rob a market in Zemun across the river in Hungary and were stripped of their armor and clothing, which was hung from the castle walls. Eventually the crusaders were allowed to carry on to Niš, where they were provided with food and waited to hear from Constantinople.

== Cologne to Constantinople ==
Peter and the remaining crusaders left Cologne about 20 April. About 40,000 Crusaders departed immediately. Another group would follow soon after; this group committed the Rhineland massacres against Jewish populations and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;German Crusade of 1096&quot;. When they reached the Danube, part of the army decided to continue on by boat down the Danube, while the main body continued overland and entered Hungary at Sopron. There it continued through Hungary without incident and rejoined the Danube contingent at Zemun on the Byzantine frontier.

In Zemun, the crusaders became suspicious, seeing Walter&#x27;s sixteen suits of armor hanging from the walls, and eventually a dispute over the price of a pair of shoes in the market led to a riot, which then turned into an all-out assault on the city by the crusaders, in which 4,000 Hungarians were killed. The crusaders then fled across the river Sava to Belgrade, but only after skirmishing with Belgrade troops. The residents of Belgrade fled, and the crusaders pillaged and burned the city. Then they marched for seven days, arriving at Niš on 3 July. There, the commander of Niš promised to provide escort for Peter&#x27;s army to Constantinople as well as food, if he would leave right away. Peter obliged, and the next morning he set out. However, a few Germans got into a dispute with some locals along the road and set fire to a mill, which escalated out of Peter&#x27;s control until Niš sent out its entire garrison against the crusaders. The crusaders were completely routed, losing about 10,000 (a quarter of their number), the remainder regrouping further on at Bela Palanka. When they reached Sofia on 12 July they met their Byzantine escort, which brought them safely the rest of the way to Constantinople by 1 August.

== Leadership breakdown ==
Byzantine emperor Alexius I Komnenus, not knowing what else to do with such an unusual and unexpected army, quickly ferried all 30,000 across the Bosporus by 6 August. It has since been debated whether he sent them away without Byzantine guides knowing full well that they could be slaughtered by the Turks, or whether they insisted on continuing into Asia Minor despite his warnings. In any case, it is known that Alexius warned Peter not to engage the Turks, whom he believed to be superior to Peter&#x27;s motley army, and to wait for the main body of crusaders, which was still on the way.

Peter was rejoined by the French under Walter Sans Avoir and a number of bands of Italian crusaders who had arrived at the same time. Once in Asia Minor, they began to pillage towns and villages until they reached Nicomedia, where an argument broke out between the Germans and Italians on one side and the French on the other. The Germans and Italians split off and elected a new leader, an Italian named Rainald, while for the French, Geoffrey Burel took command. Peter had effectively lost control of the crusade.

Even though Alexius had urged Peter to wait for the main army, Peter had lost much of his authority and the crusaders spurred each other on, moving more boldly against nearby towns until finally the French reached the edge of Nicaea, a Seljuk stronghold and provincial capital, where they pillaged the suburbs. The Germans, not to be outdone, marched with 6,000 crusaders on Xerigordos and captured the fortress to use as a base to raid the countryside. In response, the Turks, led by one of Kilij Arslan&#x27;s generals, defeated the crusaders at the Siege of Xerigordos, many of whom were forced to drink the blood of donkeys and their own urine during the siege, since their water supply was cut. Some of the crusaders who were captured converted to Islam and were sent to Khorasan, while others who refused to abandon their faith were killed.

== Battle and outcome ==

Back at the main crusaders&#x27; camp, two Turkish spies had spread rumors that the Germans who had taken Xerigordos had also taken Nicaea, which caused excitement to get there as soon as possible to share in the looting. The Turks were waiting on the road to Nicaea. Peter the Hermit had gone back to Constantinople to arrange for supplies and was due back soon, and most of the leaders argued to wait for him to return (which he never did). However, Geoffrey Burel, who had popular support among the masses, argued that it would be cowardly to wait, and they should move against the Turks right away. His will prevailed and, on the morning of 21 October, the entire army of 20,000 marched out toward Nicaea, leaving women, children, the old and the sick behind at the camp.

Three miles from the camp, where the road entered a narrow, wooded valley near the village of Dracon, the Turkish army was waiting. When approaching the valley, the crusaders marched noisily and were quickly subjected to a hail of arrows. Panic set in immediately and within minutes, the army was in full rout back to the camp. Most of the crusaders were slaughtered, including Walter Sans Avoir; however, women, children, and those who surrendered were spared. Three thousand, including Geoffrey Burel, were able to obtain refuge in an abandoned castle. Eventually the Byzantines under Constantine Katakalon sailed over and raised the siege; these few thousand returned to Constantinople, the only survivors of the People&#x27;s Crusade.

While the People’s Crusade was never replenished to its original numbers after the battle, disarmed, injured, or bankrupted crusaders joined the army of Peter the Hermit, which continued on toward Palestine to aid the “princes” in the First Crusade.

<text>The vatu (abbreviation: VT; ISO code: VUV) is the currency of Vanuatu. It has no subdivisions.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;vatu&quot;, used in all three official languages of Vanuatu (English, French, and Bislama), was borrowed from the word for &quot;stone&quot; in some indigenous languages (such as Raga &quot;vatu&quot;). Ultimately, it descends from Proto-Oceanic &quot;*patu&quot;, from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian and Proto-Austronesian &quot;*batu&quot; of the same meaning.

== Exchange rate ==

==History==

The vatu was introduced in 1981, one year after independence, to replace the New Hebrides franc at par. The vatu was issued as a single unit with no subdivision, with the 1 vatu coin being the smallest denomination issued, in a similar vein to the (post-1953) Japanese yen and the Tajikistani ruble (although that had an official if theoretical, subdivision).

The ISO 4217 currency code for the Vanuatu vatu is VUV. Its nationally recognized symbol Vt is the most often used in written format. The vatu&#x27;s introduction also saw the end of the official circulation of the Australian dollar in Vanuatu.

==Coins==

Vanuatu&#x27;s first post-colonial coin was a 50 vatu coin introduced in 1981 and commemorated 1 year of independence. It was struck in pure nickel like previous issues and was released into circulation, though originally its release was targeted more towards collectors. Shortly thereafter, in 1983, 1, 2, and 5 vatu coins were released in aluminium bronze and 10, 20, and 50-vatu coins were introduced in cupro-nickel, replacing the coinage of the New Hebrides Franc as the new circulation currency. This also replaced the Australian currency that was circulating in the British controlled islands. All Vanuatuan coins depict the Vanuatuan coat of arms, consisting of a native warrior in front of a whorled pig&#x27;s tusk, a traditional item of value. The reverses depict other traditional items of value.

Due to Vanuatu&#x27;s French colonial history, the current vatu coins have the same size and coloration of the coins of New Hebrides which are based in part on French units, particularly the 1, 2, and 5 vatu in their similarity in size and composition to the 5, 10, and 20 centimes of the old French Franc. The 10, 20, and 50 vatu bear some similarities to Australian coins but are actually slightly larger with closer approximate size to coins of similar valuation to those in New Caledonia, and French Polynesia. In 1988, a nickel-brass 100 vatu coin was introduced, this coin replaced the 100 vatu note. The coin is of the same size and general thickness of the British 1 pound coin.

In 2011, the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu ceased to issue 1 and 2 vatu coins, which had become infrequently used due to inflation. The coins are still legal tender. Cash transactions in Vanuatu stores are now rounded to the nearest 5 vatu.

As part of a coinage reform, new coins were minted in 2015 by the Royal Australian Mint. The older coins remained in circulation and legal tender.

These coins are denominated 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 vatu.

==Banknotes==

On 22 March 1982, notes were introduced by the Central bank of Vanuatu in denominations of 100, 500, and 1,000 vatu. These officially replaced franc notes of the former New Hebrides. In 1988 the 100 vatu note was withdrawn from circulation and replaced by a 100 vatu coin. In 1989, 5,000 vatu notes were introduced.

In 1993, after a financial restructure, the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu took over paper money issuance and introduced newly designed notes for 500 and 1,000 vatu. 200-vatu notes were first introduced in 1995 to cut down on the amount of 100 vatu coins received in change and the need to meet demand by producing more. In 2011, new 5,000 vatu notes were also issued in polymer. Polymer 10,000 notes were issued as a commemorative issue on 28 July 2010. As of 2013, they are no longer in circulation. On 9 June 2014, the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu introduced a new series of notes printed on polymer, among the new series of notes is a new denomination of 2,000 vatu, in addition to regular 10,000 vatu notes.

==Dollar==

Local residents sometimes refer to a notional dollar, equal to 100 vatu, without specifying which country&#x27;s currency they have in mind. This stems from the period 1966–1973, when the New Hebrides franc was pegged to the Australian dollar at a rate of 100 francs = 1 dollar. Although no relationship currently exists, it simplifies thinking in the larger numbers which a low-value unit causes. For example, the Government&#x27;s budget of VT 6,000,000,000 is in fact only about US$50,000,000.

The concept of this notional &quot;dollar&quot; was supported by the size of the former 100 vatu coin: at 23 mm, it was comparable to the Australian $1 (25 mm) and the New Zealand $1 (23 mm) but the thickness is equivalent to the twelve-sided British £1 coin. It has now been replaced by a scalloped version.

==Pounds and shillings==

In some Vanuatuan languages, in which counting in large numbers is cumbersome and not well known, 10 vatu is colloquially referred to as &quot;one shilling&quot;, and 200 vatu is referred to as &quot;one pound&quot;. For example, in the Apma language, &quot;50 vatu&quot; would be &quot;selen kalim&quot; &quot;five shillings&quot;. This roughly reflects the historical exchange rate of the vatu against the pound, although since 2008 the number of vatu to the pound has been significantly lower.

==Alternative currencies in Vanuatu==

Many communities in Vanuatu continue to conduct ceremonial business such as the paying of fines and bride-prices using traditional items of value, such as pigs, curved boars&#x27; tusks and long dyed mats. Vatu is sometimes used as a substitute for traditional valuables in such ceremonies, although the National Council of Chiefs discourages this.

The Tangbunia bank, based on Pentecost Island in Vanuatu, offers accounts and transfers denominated in livatu, a unit of currency equivalent to the value of a fully curved boar&#x27;s tusk.

<text>The Pearson Commission on International Development investigated the effectiveness of the World Bank&#x27;s development assistance in the 20 years to 1968 and made recommendations for future operation of the organization.

In August 1968, Robert S. McNamara, then President of the World Bank, formed the commission, asking former Canadian Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Lester B. Pearson to head the commission. On September 15, 1969, Pearson and seven colleagues on the Commission on International Development delivered their report, &quot;Partners in Development&quot;.

<doc id="1197035" wikidata="Q5379517" url="?curid=1197035" title="Enriched flour">
<text>Enriched flour is flour with specific nutrients added to it. These nutrients include iron and B vitamins (folic acid, riboflavin, niacin, and thiamine). Calcium may also be supplemented. The purpose of enriching flour is to replenish the nutrients in the flour to match the nutritional status of the unrefined product. This differentiates enrichment from fortification, which is the process of introducing new nutrients to a food.

79 countries have fortification or enrichment for wheat or maize flour made &quot;mandatory&quot;, according to the Global Fortification Data Exchange.

== History ==
White flour became adopted in many cultures because it was thought to be healthier than dark flours during the late Middle Ages. As white flour was more expensive it became a fashionable indicator of perceived social status and tended to be consumed mostly by the richer classes. Another factor was that mold and fungus in the grains, which led to several diseases, were significantly reduced in the processing that resulted in white flour. 

In the 1920s, Benjamin R. Jacobs began to document the loss of essential nutrients, however, through this processing of cereals and grains and to demonstrate a method by which the end products could be enriched with some of the lost nutrients. These nutrients promote good health and help to prevent some diseases. Enrichment was not possible until 1936, when the synthesis of thiamin was elucidated.

The international effort to start enriching flour was launched during the 1940s as a means to improve the health of the wartime populations of the United Kingdom and United States while food was being rationed and alternative sources of the nutrients were scarce. The decision to choose flour for enrichment was based on its commonality in the diets of those wartime populations, ranging from the rich to the poor. These wartime campaigns resulted in 40% of flour being enriched by 1942. In February 1942, the U.S. Army announced that it would purchase only enriched flour. This resulted in a large expansion of enrichment, but smaller local mills were still selling cheap, unenriched flour that could end up consumed by the poor, which needed enrichment the most. In 1943, the War Foods Administration issued a temporary ban on non-enriched bread, finally raising enrichment compliance to 100%.

== Flour processing and nutrient loss ==
The conversion of grains to flour involves several steps that vary with the type of grain used. The initial stages of processing remove the bran and the germ of the seed. The bran is the outermost layer of grains that contains fiber (primarily insoluble), some protein, and trace minerals. The germ is the embryo of the seed that contains B vitamins and trace minerals. Because the germ has a fat content of 10%, it may reduce shelf-life. Thus, it is separated to ensure longer shelf life of the flour. In contrast to enriched flour, whole wheat flour contains both the bran and the germ. The remaining and largest portion of the seed is the endosperm. It acts as a nutrient reservoir for the developing embryo. The endosperm contains a large amount of carbohydrates, protein, iron, B vitamins (niacin and riboflavin), and soluble fiber. 

Once the endosperm is isolated, it is ground into a fine powder and sifted to remove any remaining fragments of bran or germ. Next, a chemical bleaching process is used to give the flour a whiter color. This bleaching step, usually with chlorine or benzoyl peroxide, destroys many of the original nutrients that were present in the flour. The final flour product contains a smaller portion of the original nutrients that were present in the seed prior to processing. Enrichment ensures that these important nutrients are restored to improve the quality of the flour.

== Enrichment requirements ==
According to the U.S. FDA, a pound of flour must have the following quantities of nutrients to qualify as enriched: 2.9 milligrams of thiamin, 1.8 milligrams of riboflavin, 24 milligrams of niacin, 0.7 milligrams of folic acid, and 20 milligrams of iron. The first four nutrients are B vitamins. Calcium also may be added; this must be to a minimum level of 960 milligrams per pound if calcium is mentioned in the labeling. Similar rules are set for grains like rice and cornmeal.

Other countries also have flour enrichment programs.

<text>Ronald Andrew Whelan (; born 25 September 1961) is an Irish former professional football player who played as a midfielder and sometimes as a defender. He played an integral role in the dominant Liverpool side that won a wealth of titles in the 1980s. He was at the club from 1979 until 1994, scoring a number of vital goals. In 100 Players Who Shook The Kop, a poll of 110,000 Liverpool fans conducted by Liverpool&#x27;s official website, Whelan came in 30th.

Whelan finished his career at Southend United, where he was also player-manager. He has also managed in Greece and Cyprus, with Panionios, Olympiakos Nicosia and Apollon Limassol.

Whelan was an important member of the Republic of Ireland national football team at one UEFA European Football Championship (1988) and also appeared at two World Cups (1990 and 1994). He played a total of 53 times for the national side between 1981 and 1995.

Since retirement he has begun a media career, and is a regular contributor to RTÉ Sport in Ireland.

==Early life==
Whelan was born into a family of footballers from Dublin, Ireland; his father, Ronnie Sr., was an Irish international and a key member of the successful St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic side of the late 1950s and early 1960s. His brother Paul Whelan played for Bohemian FC and Shamrock Rovers.

Whelan was a skilful and industrious midfield player, who, after an unsuccessful trial period for Manchester United (for whom he made one appearance for their &#x27;B&#x27; team, scoring in a 7–4 win over Liverpool &#x27;B&#x27;, on 20 August 1977), made his League of Ireland debut for Home Farm on his 16th birthday at Tolka Park.

Whelan scored for a League of Ireland XI against the Basque Country at the San Mamés in August 1979 

==Liverpool==
Whelan was signed for Liverpool by Bob Paisley for a bargain £35,000 on 19 September 1979, a few days before his 18th birthday and made his debut 18 months later, on 3 April 1981, scoring his first goal in the 27th minute of the 3–0 league win over Stoke City at Anfield. This would be Whelan&#x27;s one and only appearance of the season for the first team, as Whelan spent much of his first few months at the club in the reserves.

The following season Whelan won his place on the left side of the Liverpool midfield, ending the Anfield career of Ray Kennedy and also taking over his No. 5 shirt. It was an excellent season for Whelan, as he settled into first team football and helped Liverpool to another League championship. They also retained the League Cup with victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, with Whelan scoring twice in the 3–1 win, including the equalizer late in regulation time and the winner in extra-time.

In 1983, Liverpool retained these two trophies and Whelan again tallied in the League Cup final, scoring the winner with a curving shot into the Manchester United net in extra-time to secure a 2–1 win. Whelan then played a major role in Liverpool&#x27;s treble of League title, League Cup and European Cup of 1984, although he was injured for part of this season.

Liverpool&#x27;s trophyless season in 1985, culminating in the disaster at Heysel, was followed by a much more successful season for Whelan and Liverpool, under the new management of Kenny Dalglish. Liverpool clinched another League title and added the FA Cup, with Whelan setting up two of the goals in a 3–1 victory over Merseyside rivals Everton, the first time the two had met in an FA Cup final. It was only the third League and FA Cup &quot;double&quot; of the 20th century. Whelan put in some fine performances in the league as well, most notably a hat-trick in the 5–0 home win over Coventry City on 12 April 1986.

Liverpool ended the following season trophyless, losing the League Cup Final to Arsenal and coming second to Everton in the league. The following year, Whelan switched to a central role following the arrival of England winger John Barnes at Anfield, supplementing the new strike partnership of Peter Beardsley and John Aldridge. This season saw Liverpool play an exciting brand of football and they won the league title with just two defeats all season. They also reached the final of the FA Cup, although Whelan missed out on the cup final as Nigel Spackman, who had won his place in the team when Whelan was injured earlier in the season was chosen ahead of him. Whelan&#x27;s name and profile was even left out of the official match programme at Wembley for the FA Cup final against Wimbledon, which prohibitive favourites Liverpool lost 1–0 to a team who had just completed only their second season in the First Division and their 11th in the Football League.

An injury to club captain Alan Hansen meant that Whelan spent much of the 1988–89 season as captain of Liverpool, a role he relished as the club progressed to another challenge for a &quot;double&quot;. Then the Hillsborough disaster happened, and Whelan played a key role in leading the team on and off the pitch in a difficult time. When Hansen recovered, Whelan maintained the captaincy for continuity purposes and it was he who lifted the FA Cup after a 3–2 win over derby rivals Everton. However, he missed the chance to do the same with the League title, with Arsenal taking the championship thanks to a last-minute goal from Michael Thomas on the final day of the season on goal difference. This meant that for the second year running Liverpool narrowly missed out on a unique second double.

Liverpool won the League again in 1990 with Whelan playing a central role for much of the season, although he missed the last few games due to the first of several injuries which would severely hamper the rest of his Liverpool career. One of Whelan&#x27;s more forgettable moments came that season, when in a match at Old Trafford, an unmarked Whelan chipped a backpass from 30 yards over goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar and into the net. It is considered to be one of the most bizarre and comical own goals in top flight history. However, Liverpool still won the match 2–1.

Whelan remained a first team regular the following season, until an injury sustained in February 1991 against Everton ruled him out for the rest of the campaign. For the rest of his Anfield career, Whelan was injured as often as he played. He missed much of the 1991–92 season with injury, although returned to score a crucial equaliser against Portsmouth in the FA Cup semi-final, forcing a replay which Liverpool won on penalties. However, although he had recovered from another minor injury in time for the successful Cup final against Sunderland, he didn&#x27;t feature, his place going to Jan Mølby.

When Whelan was fit, manager Graeme Souness gave him plenty more first team opportunities in the new FA Premier League for the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons, but it was a disappointing period for the club, as they finished sixth in the Premier League in 1993 and eighth in 1994. By this time, Graeme Souness had been replaced as manager by Roy Evans. At the end of the 1993–94 season, Evans decided not to offer Whelan a new contract.

In all, Whelan played 493 first team games for Liverpool, scoring 73 goals in combined league and cup matches. He scored 46 league goals in fourteen consecutive seasons, 37 of them in his first seven years when he played a more attacking role. He won six League championship title medals, three FA Cups, a European Cup and three League Cup medals in his time with the club.

==International career==
By the age of 20 Whelan had represented the Republic of Ireland national football team at schoolboy, youth, amateur, U21 and senior level. Whelan first represented his country at schoolboy level.

Whelan was a regular for the Republic of Ireland, making his debut on 29 April 1981 when he came off the bench in the 63rd minute of the 3–1 victory over Czechoslovakia at Lansdowne Road.

Whelan was part of the Irish side which qualified for the UEFA European Championship of 1988 in West Germany. He was in the team which memorably beat England 1–0, and in the next game scored a spectacular goal in a draw with the USSR. Defeat in the final group game, against eventual champions Netherlands, eliminated Ireland from the competition. In general, Ireland&#x27;s style under manager Jack Charlton did not involve precision midfield play, which limited Whelan&#x27;s international impact. He came on as a substitute against Holland in his only appearance in the 1990 World Cup, and played for less than a half against Norway in his sole 1994 World Cup game. In all he played 53 times for his country, scoring three goals.

==Managerial career==
On his departure from Anfield in 1994 after 15 years, Whelan signed for Southend United and became their player-manager a year later, before being sacked at the end of the 1996–97 season following their relegation from Division One.

He later worked with clubs in Greece such as Panionios and in Cyprus such as Apollon Limassol and Olympiakos Nicosia. His greatest success as a manager, was with Panionios in 1999, when his team reached for first time the quarter finals of a European competition, the Cup Winners Cup, when they were eliminated by eventual champions S.S. Lazio by 0–4 and 0–3 scores over the two legs.

==Media career==
Whelan now works on the after-dinner circuit and does some punditry.

Whelan features regularly on RTÉ Sport&#x27;s soccer programming, including its Premier League and UEFA Champions League coverage. He is notable for his pronunciation of Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger&#x27;s name. He contributed to RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He was also part of RTÉ Sport&#x27;s studio coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
He was signed to be part of RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of UEFA Euro 2016, UEFA Euro 2020 and UEFA Euro 2024.

<doc id="1197057" wikidata="Q5058133" url="?curid=1197057" title="CellML">
<text>CellML is an XML based markup language for describing mathematical models. Although it could theoretically describe any mathematical model, it was originally created with the Physiome Project in mind, and hence used primarily to describe models relevant to the field of biology. This is reflected in its name CellML, although this is simply a name, not an abbreviation. CellML is growing in popularity as a portable description format for computational models, and groups throughout the world are using CellML for modelling or developing software tools based on CellML. CellML is similar to Systems Biology Markup Language SBML but provides greater scope for model modularity and reuse, and is not specific to descriptions of biochemistry.

== History ==
The CellML language grew from a need to share models of cardiac cell dynamics among researchers at a number of sites across the world. The original working group formed in 1998 consisted of David Bullivant, Warren Hedley, and Poul Nielsen; all three were at that time members of the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Auckland. The language was an application of the XML specification developed by the World Wide Web Consortium – the decision to use XML was based on late 1998 recommendations from Warren Hedley and André (David) Nickerson. Existing XML-based languages were leveraged to describe the mathematics (content MathML), metadata (RDF), and links between resources (XLink). The CellML working group first became aware of the SBML effort in late 2000, when Warren Hedley attended the 2nd workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology in Tokyo.

The working group collaborated with a number of researchers at Physiome Sciences Inc. (particularly Melanie Nelson, Scott Lett, Mark Grehlinger, Prasad Ramakrishna, Jeremy Rice, Adam Muzikant, and Kam-Chuen Jim) to draft the initial CellML 1.0 specification, which was published on the 11th of August 2001. This first draft was followed by specifications for CellML Metadata and an update to CellML to accommodate structured nesting of models with the addition of the &lt;import&gt; element. Physiome Sciences Inc. also produced the first CellML capable software. The National Resource for Cell Analysis and Modeling (NRCAM) at the University of Connecticut Health Center also produced early CellML capable software called Virtual Cell.

In 2002 the CellML 1.1 specification was written, in which imports were added. Imports provide the ability to incorporate external components into a model, enabling modular modelling. This specification was frozen in early 2006. Work has continued on metadata and other specifications.

In July 2009 the CellML website was completely revamped, and an initial version of the new CellML repository software (PMR2) was released.

In July 2020 the CellML 2.0 specification was published, in which resets were added. Resets allowed for setting the value of a variable to any value when a prescribed condition is met. The directionality between connections was dropped to aid in the reusability of components, and the definition of units was restricted to the model only.

In support of the CellML 2.0 specification the libCellML project was started in 2015 to provide application developers with a model based API C++ library. The library was quickly expanded to provide support for Javascript, Julia, and Python. The latest release of the software is version 0.5.0. The 0.5.0 version of the library supports the majority of the CellML 2.0 specification, it also supports reading of CellML 1.1 and CellML 1.0 models. A major point of interest is that the libCellML library does not support writing to older CellML standards.

== The structure of a CellML model ==
A CellML model consists of a number of components, each described in their own component element. A component can be an entirely conceptual entity created for modelling convenience, or it can have some real physical interpretation (for example, it could represent the cell membrane).

Each component contains a number of variables, which must be declared by placing a variable element inside the component. For example, a component representing a cell membrane may have a variable called V representing the potential difference (voltage) across the cell membrane.

Mathematical relationships between variables are expressed within components, using MathML. MathML is used to make declarative expressions (as opposed to procedural statements as in a computer programming language). However, most CellML processing software will only accept a limited of range of mathematics (for example, some processing software requires equations with a single variable on one side of an equality). The choice of MathML makes CellML particularly suited for describing models containing differential equations. There is no mechanism for the expression of stochastic models or any other form of randomness.

Components can be connected in other components using a connection element, which describes the name of two components to be connected, and the variables in the first component which are mapped to variables in the second component. Such connections are a statement that the variable in one component is equivalent to another variable in another component.

CellML models also allow relationships between components to be expressed. The CellML specification defines two types of relationship, encapsulation and containment, however more can be defined by the user. The containment relationship is used to express that one component is physically within another. The encapsulation relationship is special because it is the only relationship that affects the interpretation of the rest of the model. The effect of encapsulation is that components encapsulated beneath other components are private and cannot be accessed except by the component directly above in the encapsulation tree. The modeller is free to use encapsulation as a conceptual tool, and it does not necessarily have any physical interpretation.

== Specifications ==

CellML is defined by core specifications as well as additional specifications for metadata, used to annotate models and specify simulations.

=== CellML 1.0 ===
CellML 1.0 was the first final specification, and is used to describe many of the models in the CellML Model Repository.

CellML 1.0 has some biochemistry specific elements for describing the role of variables in a reaction model.

=== CellML 1.1 ===
CellML 1.1 introduced the ability to import components and units. In order to fully support this feature, variables in CellML 1.1 accept variable names as initial values.

=== CellML 2.0 ===
CellML 2.0 made some significant changes, the changes are listed below:

* Introduced the ability to reset state variables.
* Dropped the directionality in connections.
* Units can now only be defined at the model level.

=== Metadata specifications ===

CellML has several metadata specifications, used to annotate models or provide information for running and/or visualizing simulations of models.
* The metadata 1.0 specification is used to annotate models with a variety of information; relevant references, authorship information, the species the model is relevant to, and so on.
* Simulation metadata provides the information required to reproduce specific simulations using a CellML model.
* Graphing metadata provides information to specify particular visualizations of simulation output, for example to reproduce a particular graph from a paper.

== CellML.org ==
CellML.org aims to provide a focal point for the CellML community. Members can submit, review, and update models and receive feedback and help from the community. A CellML discussion mailing list can be found at CellML-discussion mailing list. The scope of this mailing list includes everything related to the development and use of CellML.

A repository of several hundred biological models encoded into CellML can be found on the CellML community website at CellML Model Repository. These models are actively undergoing a curation process aiming to provide annotations with biological ontologies such as Gene Ontology and to validate the models against standards of unit balance and biophysical constrains such as conservation of mass, charge, energy etc.

<doc id="1197067" wikidata="Q1427417" url="?curid=1197067" title="Reed valve">
<text>Reed valves are a type of check valve which restrict the flow of fluids to a single direction, opening and closing under changing pressure on each face. Modern versions often consist of flexible metal or composite materials (fiberglass or carbon fiber).

== Applications ==

===Traditional===
Reed valves, normally a leather flap covering a hole, are amongst the earliest form of automatic flow control for liquids and gases. They have been used for thousands of years in water pumps and for hundreds of years in bellows for high-temperature forges and musical instruments such as church organs and accordions. In nature, heart valves operate in a somewhat similar fashion.

===Pumps===
Reed valves are used in some reciprocating compressor designs, and in the pumping element of some musical instruments, large and small.

===Two-stroke engines===

Reed valves are commonly used in high-performance versions of the two-stroke engine, where they control the fuel-air mixture admitted to the cylinder. As the piston rises in the cylinder a vacuum is created in the crankcase beneath the piston. The resulting pressure differential opens the valve and the fuel-air mixture flows into the crankcase. As the piston descends, it raises the crankcase pressure causing the valve to close to retain the mixture and pressurize it for its eventual transfer through to the combustion chamber. The Swedish motorcycle company Husqvarna produced a two-stroke, 500 cc displacement single cylinder engine with a reed-valve controlled intake, one of the biggest in using this arrangement. Reed valves in two-stroke engines have been placed in the intake ports and also in controlling the intake to the crankshaft space.

Composite materials are preferred in racing engines, especially in kart racing, because the stiffness of the petals can be easily tuned and they are relatively safe in failure. High-speed impact takes its toll on all reed valves, with metal valves suffering in fatigue. The physical inertia of reed valves means that they are not as entirely precise in action as rotary valves, a rotary valve engine may run better than a reed valve engine at a small rpm range but the reed valve engine often runs better over a wider rpm range. More sophisticated designs partly address this by creating multi-stage reeds with smaller, more responsive reeds within larger ones that provide more volume later in the cycle. Nevertheless, current technology favors reed valves almost to the exclusion of rotary valves due to their simplicity and low implementation costs and less rotational mass.

===Wankel rotary combustion engines===
Yanmar Diesel, a Japanese engine maker, was pioneer in introducing reed valves for flow control at intake ports of its small Wankel engines, showing an improvement in torque and performances at low rpm and under partial load of the engine. Toyota discovered the benefits of injecting fresh air into the Wankel RCE exhaust port, and also used a reed valve in prototypes where they tested the SCRE concept (Stratified Charge Rotary Engine). However, this kind of intake port arrangement never reached the production line for automobile size RCEs. According to David W. Garside, who developed the Norton line of Wankel-powered motorcycles, data from other RCE producers pointed that reed valves do improve performances at low rpm and under partial load, but reduce the high speed power output of the engine, a feature considered inconvenient for motorcycle engines.

===Pulse jets===
Reed valves are used in the cheap but inefficient pulse jet engine, such as the one used by the Argus As 014 engine in the German V-1 (flying bomb). The valves at the front of the cylindrical engine are opened by the low pressure in the combustion chamber caused by the resonance of the air column in the engine, fuel is squirted into the combustion chamber and ignited by the hot combustion gases of the previous cycle. Once the charge has expanded and mostly left the engine, pressure inside drops again to below-atmospheric values and the reed valve allows fresh air to enter and the cycle be repeated. Some ram-air pressure due to forward motion helps scavenging and filling the combustion chamber with the new, fresh air charge, thus improving the power of the engine at higher speeds.

== Design and modelling ==
Reed valves are designed considering the pressure gradient and mass flow. The pressure gradient is used to evaluate the valve lift during open condition; the lift and overall component geometry (considering also a pressure loss coefficient) are then used to calculate the mass flow. For high speed applications (compressors and engines) the dynamic response has to be considered. A simple approach consists in the evaluation of first eigenvalue that is compared with exciting frequency.
Design of reed valves can be refined using simulations. The dynamic of petals can be studied neglecting the coupling between fluid and structure: in this case the evolution of the structural part are simulated using lumped parameters models or FEM models, discharge coefficients at various valve lift are evaluated with experiments or CFD simulations.
The study of the complete system needs an integrated Fluid-structure interaction model.

<doc id="1197080" wikidata="Q816545" url="?curid=1197080" title="Ben Lexcen">
<text>Benjamin Lexcen AM (born Robert Clyde Miller, 19 March 1936 – 1 May 1988) was an Australian yachtsman and marine architect. He is famous for the winged keel design applied to &quot;Australia II&quot; which, in 1983, became the first non-American yacht to win the prestigious America&#x27;s Cup in 132 years.

==Early life==
Born in the small town of Boggabri, New South Wales on 19 March 1936. After his parents, labourer Edward William Miller and Ethel Doreen, née Green abandoned him as a child he stayed briefly at Boys&#x27; Town, Engadine, before going to his grandfather at Newcastle. He left school at age 14 to pursue a locomotive mechanic&#x27;s apprenticeship but soon found his attention turning to sailboats. At 16, he designed his first sailboat &quot;The Comet&quot; with his friend William Bennett in Hamilton, NSW, and began to make a name for himself in local competition. Miller did his sailmaking apprenticeship with Norman Wright in Queensland. Miller&#x27;s designs were highly innovative. His entry, &quot;Taipan&quot; in the 1960 18Footer World Championship started the modern era of the class and Miller won the World Championship in 1961 with the successor, &quot;Venom&quot;. With friend Craig Whitworth, he founded a boatbuilding, sail-making and ship-chandlery firm (Miller and Whitworth) and designed boats part-time as well. One of his lasting early successes was the design that became the International Contender. It was selected in 1967, in multi boat trials, as a potential Olympic successor to the Finn dinghy. The Contender was awarded International status in 1968 and now has fleets in more than twelve countries throughout the world. His keelboat designs of the early 1970s featured clean, easily driven hulls and relatively small sail area. He had great success with a series of these designs starting with the innovative &quot;Ginkgo&quot;.

Miller competed in the Soling at the 1972 Munich Olympics representing Australia in sailing with Denis O&#x27;Neil and Ken Berkeley as fellow crew members.

==America&#x27;s Cup==
Miller was commissioned by Alan Bond to build &quot;Apollo&quot;, an ocean racer. This partnership continued when Bond first challenged for the America&#x27;s Cup in 1974 with the Miller-designed 12-metre class yacht &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, named for the southern hemisphere constellation. Their challenge for the Cup was unsuccessful but Miller was kept on as the designer for future yachts, all of them designed to the 12-metre class rules as used for America&#x27;s Cup competition at the time.

During the first years of his partnership with Bond, Miller withdrew his partnership from his sail-making company but the company retained its name of Miller and Whitworth. Soon after the 1974 Cup challenge, Miller changed his name to avoid confusion with his former company. Keen to prevent the possibility of there being any confusion surrounding his name and business interests in the future, he asked a friend who worked for Reader&#x27;s Digest to find out the least-used surname within their membership. The result was Lexcen. &quot;Ben&quot; was the name of his dog.

Bond challenged for the 1977 America&#x27;s Cup using the Lexcen and Johan Valentijn designed 12M &quot;Australia&quot; against media mogul Ted Turner and again with a Lexcen modified &quot;Australia&quot; in 1980 against Dennis Conner, losing both times.

After the 1980 challenge Lexcen realised that to win against the defenders, with their 100+ years of America&#x27;s Cup experience, they would need a superior boat. His next design featured a host of advanced design features, not the least of which was a revolutionary winged keel, intended to lower the drag and to make the boat more stable and maneuverable in the water. The keel design reduced tip vortex, a turbulence resulting in conventional keels from the pressure differential between the windward (low pressure) and leeward (high pressure) sides. Australia II&#x27;s design was to prove highly controversial, protested because some part of the design was done before and during the testing of the keel in a Dutch tank testing facility.

&quot;Australia II&quot; was a revolutionary design approach with her winged keel and hull design featuring the shortest waterline length ever measured on a 12-metre. To yachtsmen accustomed to seeing racing yachts out of the water, Australia II is striking. Its conventional long slim topsides flare down to a short waterline hinting at the dramatic, minimal, slippery underwater hull shape which was fast to turn as well as easily driven and quick to accelerate. Ben often remarked that Australia II is a whole boat, not just a keel. The New York Yacht Club, holders of the Cup, formally protested both that Australia II was not a legal 12 metre boat, and that the design itself was not of Australian origin. The ruling arrived at on the boat confirmed that &quot;Australia II&quot; complied with both the 12-metre class and the America&#x27;s Cup rules. The questions on her design origin were not formally answered at the time, but the controversy re-emerged in 2009 (see Later claims of Dutch Design for details). Claims that Peter van Oossanen was the designer of the &quot;Australia II&quot; keel rather than Ben have been strongly rejected by John Bertrand and by John Longley, an important member of the &quot;Australia II&quot; team using documentary evidence.

The 1983 America&#x27;s Cup saw Lexcen&#x27;s &quot;Australia II&quot;, with John Bertrand at the helm, take on the NYYC skipper Dennis Conner and the defender yacht, &quot;Liberty&quot;. The Australians were sure they had a fast boat. Australia II had dominated the challenger eliminations just as Liberty had dominated the closer defender trials, honing her tuning and performance. But mechanical failures on Australia II and skillful sailing by the defenders caused &quot;Australia II&quot; to fall behind, losing the first two races. &quot;Australia II&quot; stormed back to take three of the next four. Dennis Conner had creatively registered three different configurations (sail area, spar length and ballast) for Liberty and he successfully called for lay days to choose advantageous weather to suit his most competitive versions of the boat. This was the first time in history that the series depended on the result of the last race, and the pressure of defending the Cup was now firmly on Liberty. In the deciding race on 26 September, Conner prepared Liberty in her very competitive light weather configuration with big sail area and low weight. Australia II won the start and held an early lead but was overtaken by Liberty which built up a substantial margin. At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the breeze was very light and Liberty was vulnerable. Liberty chose a starboard tack leg and declined to cover Australia II which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and windshifts allowing Australia II to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark. Liberty then engaged Australia II in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks and a number of faked &quot;dummy&quot; tacks trying to break the Australians&#x27; cover. Australia II held on until both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of Liberty and sailed to the finish to take the race. Australia II became the first challenger to wrest the Cup from the United States since its inception in 1870. Lexcen was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his contributions to the winning design.

Lexcen was commissioned by Bond once again in 1986 to design a defender for the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup. He designed &quot;Australia III&quot; and &quot;Australia IV&quot; for Bond&#x27;s two boat defense program. &quot;Australia IV&quot; was ultimately defeated by the Iain Murray designed and skippered &quot;Kookaburra III&quot; in the Defender Trials. Steve Ward (builder of all four &quot;Australias&quot; maintains that Lexcen&#x27;s design was not at fault but that &quot;Australia IV&quot; was uncompetitive due to last minute design modifications ordered by the upper echelons of Bond Corporation. &quot;Australia IV&quot; was originally designed to be longer on the waterline with less sail area similar to Conner&#x27;s winning design. Australia competed in the Cup without a Lexcen designed boat for the first time in ten years. &quot;Kookaburra III&quot; lost in the finals to Dennis Conner and his American challenger, &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes 87&quot;, 4 races to nil.

==Death==
Lexcen died suddenly in Manly, New South Wales on 1 May 1988, of a heart attack at 52 years of age. He is buried at Frenchs Forest Cemetery located in Davidson, New South Wales.

==Legacy==
In 1989, the Toyota Lexcen was released by Toyota Australia in Ben Lexcen&#x27;s honour. The car was a rebadged Holden VN Commodore and was built in Australia under the Button Plan. Production lasted until 1997.

In 1988 the University of New South Wales named its newly created sports scholarships the Ben Lexcen Sports Scholarships. These scholarships were the first sports scholarships to be offered by an Australian university.

In 2006, Lexcen was posthumously inducted into the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame.

==In Popular Culture==
In the 1986 miniseries &quot;The Challenge&quot;, Lexcen was portrayed by John Clayton. In the 2016 television series &quot;House of Bond&quot;, he was played by Paul Gleeson.

In 2022, Netflix released &quot;Untold: &quot;, a film about the Australian team&#x27;s win in the 1983 race, including footage of Lexcen.

<text>Artificial Intelligence is a series of albums by Warp Records released from 1992–1994 to exhibit the capabilities and sounds of electronic music. Warp described the new (post-rave electronic) music as &quot;electronic listening music&quot; to clarify that it was meant more for the mind than the body. The sleevenote on the 1992 compilation said &quot;Are you sitting comfortably? Artificial Intelligence is for long journeys, quiet nights and club drowsy dawns. Listen with an open mind.&quot; The series is remarkable for its inclusion of groups and individuals who would later become leaders in modern electronic music, techno, and ambient, such as Alex Paterson, Plaid, Richard D. James, Richie Hawtin, and Autechre. Every album in the series, aside from Dimension Intrusion, has its name enclosed in parentheses on its cover.

== Releases ==
The original AI series consisted of the following releases, listed in order of release:

* &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; – Various Artists
* &quot;Surfing on Sine Waves&quot; – Polygon Window
* &quot;Bytes&quot; – Black Dog Productions
* &quot;Electro-Soma&quot; – B12
* &quot;Dimension Intrusion&quot; – F.U.S.E.
* &quot;Ginger&quot; – Speedy J
* &quot;Incunabula&quot; – Autechre
* &quot;Artificial Intelligence II&quot; – Various Artists
* &quot;Motion&quot; (video) – Various Artists

== Background ==
When asked about the series in a 2016 interview with online electronic music journal Resident Advisor, Sean Booth of Autechre said that,I dunno, I didn&#x27;t come up with Artificial Intelligence. You&#x27;d have to ask [Warp founder] Rob Mitchell and he&#x27;s not around any more! I think it was a joke, really. There was a definite tongue-in-cheek thing going on with the AI series initially, everyone knew it was a bit silly. But we were enjoying doing it. Thing is, almost all the artists on that first AI compilation are just like us, they were regular kids, they&#x27;re not intelligent people particularly. Richard [D. James] is a fucking blagger, Richie Hawtin too... I don&#x27;t know how the fuck he gets away with the things he does! Alex Paterson, people like that, they&#x27;re not known for being intellectually powerful, they&#x27;re just fucking good musicians.

Each of the albums was released on vinyl, cassette and CD; each of the artist albums was also released on limited edition coloured or transparent vinyl. The video release &quot;Motion&quot;, released on VHS (and Laserdisc in Japan), mostly contained tracks from &quot;Artificial Intelligence II&quot;. Each release except &quot;Ginger&quot; was distributed in the United States by TVT/Wax Trax! Records.

<text>Gasherbrum III (); ), surveyed as K3a, is a summit in the Gasherbrum massif of the Baltoro Muztagh, a subrange of the Karakoram on the border between Xinjiang, China and Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is situated between Gasherbrum II and IV.

Gasherbrum III fails to meet a topographic prominence cutoff to be an independent mountain; hence it can be considered a subpeak of Gasherbrum II.

Gasherbrum III was one of the highest unclimbed summits in the world up to its first ascent in 1975, by Wanda Rutkiewicz, Alison Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz, Janusz Onyszkiewicz and Krzysztof Zdzitowiecki, members of a Polish expedition.

<text>Ringaudas Bronislovas Songaila (20 April 1929 – 25 June 2019) was a communist politician and Nomenklatura of the Lithuanian SSR. He was the last First Secretary of the Communist Party of Lithuania (&quot;de facto&quot; leader of Lithuanian SSR) from 1987–1988. 

== Biography==
Songaila was born in Klaipėda. He graduated from a veterinary school and within five years became a deputy of the Minister of Agriculture. In 1962, at the age of 33, he became Minister of Production of Agricultural Products and Resources. In agriculture, he worked on increasing the size of kolkhozs (collective farms), increasing centralization and specialization of agricultural production, elimination of khutors (single homesteads), and implementation of land improvements. Songaila was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania (1962–1981), Chairman of the Council of Ministers (1981–1985; equivalent to Prime Minister), Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR (1985–1987; &quot;de jure&quot; head of state), and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Lithuania (December 1987 – October 1988; &quot;de facto&quot; head of state). 

He was described as a &quot;bland&quot; and indecisive but loyal communist who stayed away from political intrigues and showed interest only in agricultural matters. When Songaila ordered KGB and Internal Troops to forcibly disperse a rally of the radical pro-independence Lithuanian Liberty League on 28 September 1988, he was forced to resign one month later. He was replaced by Algirdas Brazauskas, who supported Sąjūdis movement and Lithuania&#x27;s declaration of independence in March 1990.

After the resignation, Songaila retired from public life and died on 25 June 2019 at the age of 90. He was buried in the Antakalnis Cemetery in Vilnius.

<text>Most of the railroads were chartered by the Florida State Legislature, but some were incorporated under the general incorporation laws. The Legislature met every two years, which is why most railroads were incorporated in odd-numbered years.

Between 1831 and 1939, the territory and state of Florida chartered 564 companies to build and/or operate railroads. Two hundred and fifty-one of those companies actually build railroads. By 1939, abandonment and consolidation had reduced the number of companies operating railroads in Florida to just 22.
==1830s==
*The Leon Rail-Way was chartered by the territorial legislature in 1831. It was rechartered as the Leon Railroad Company in 1832, and again as the Tallahassee Railroad in 1834. The railroad began partial operation in 1836, making it the second railroad in Florida.
*The Florida, Alabama &amp; Georgia Railroad was chartered by the Florida territorial legislature in 1834. After Alabama chartered the Alabama, Florida &amp; Georgia Railroad, Florida accepted the Alabama charter in 1835. Construction was started, and the Montgomery and West Point Railroad was acquired as part of a plan to connect Pensacola with Montgomery, Alabama. The Panic of 1837 caused the Bank of Pensacola, which had floated the bonds for the railroad, to fail, and the Territory of Florida repudiated its backing of the bonds. The company collapsed without ever operating a train.
*The Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal Company was chartered by the territorial legislature in 1835. The company began construction of a railroad instead of a canal, and it was rechartered as the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad Company in 1836. The railroad began operating in March 1835. The railroad ceased operations in the early 1840s.
*The Pond Creek and Blackwater River Canal Company was chartered by the territorial legislature in 1835. In 1838 it was rechartered as the Arcadia Railroad. It transported lumber over a three-mile track between Pond Creek and Blackwater River using mule-power.

==1850s==
*The Florida, Atlantic &amp; Gulf Central Railroad was chartered by the state legislature in 1851. Construction began in 1855 on a route from Jacksonville to Alligator (renamed Lake City in 1859). The line was completed to Lake City in 1860.
*The Pensacola &amp; Georgia Railroad was chartered by the state legislature in 1853. In 1855 the company&#x27;s charter was amended to allow the company to connect Pensacola to Lake City. Construction began in Tallahassee in 1856. That same year the Pensacola &amp; Georgia acquired control of the Tallahassee Railroad. The first new section of the railroad, from Tallahassee to Capitola, opened in 1857. The line from Tallahassee to Lake City was completed at the beginning of 1861. The Pensacola &amp; Georgia Railroad opened an extension from Tallahassee to Quincy in 1863. The Florida portion of a line from Lake City to Lawton, Georgia was completed by the Florida &amp; Georgia Railroad in 1865.
*The Alabama &amp; Florida Railroad was chartered by Florida in 1853. It opened its first track between Pensacola and Pollard, Alabama in 1861. The company went bankrupt and was sold at foreclosure to the Pensacola and Louisville Railroad in 1869. It was reorganized as the Pensacola Railroad in 1877, and sold to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad a few years later.
*The Florida Railroad was chartered by Florida in 1853. Originally conceived as a line from Amelia Island (Fernandina Beach) to Tampa, with a branch to Cedar Key, the company decided to build the Cedar Key branch before extending to Tampa. The line from Fernandina had reached Starke by 1858, and Cedar Key in 1860.
*In 1858 the legislature chartered the St. Johns Railroad, running between Tocoi Landing on the St. Johns River and New Augustine, on the San Sebastian River across from St. Augustine. It was in operation by 1860.

<text>Gasherbrum IV (; ), surveyed as K3, is the 17th highest mountain on Earth and the 6th highest in Pakistan, as well as the highest independent mountain under eight thousand meters in Pakistan.

One of the peaks in the Gasherbrum massif, its immense West Face looms over the glacial junction of Concordia. The Name &quot;Gasherbrum&quot; is often claimed to mean &quot;Shining Wall&quot;, presumably a reference to this face&#x27;s tendency to reflect the rays of the setting sun, but in fact it comes from &quot;rgasha&quot; (beautiful) and &quot;brum&quot; (mountain) in Balti, hence it actually means &quot;beautiful mountain.&quot;

Despite its lower height relative to the surrounding eight-thousanders, Gasherbrum IV is a venerated challenge among mountaineers.

<text>USS &quot;Pilotfish&quot; (SS-386), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named after the pilot fish, a carangoid fish, often seen in warm latitudes in company with sharks.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pilotfish&quot; was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, in Kittery, Maine, on 15 May 1943; launched on 30 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Martha Szolmeczka Scheutz; and commissioned on 16 December 1943.

==Operational history==
After underway trials, training, and shakedown in the Portsmouth area, &quot;Pilotfish&quot; departed New London 29 March 1944 for the Pacific via the Panama Canal. She reported to Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet 10 April and joined Submarine Division 202, Submarine Squadron 20.

On 16 May, &quot;Pilotfish&quot; departed on her first patrol in company with and . This patrol was begun in the area west of the Mariana Islands. After a week the group sailed to an area south of Formosa and patrolled across a probable route of reinforcement or retirement of the Japanese forced engaged in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. This proved fruitless and &quot;Pilotfish&quot; set course for Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, arriving 4 July.

&quot;Pilotfish&quot; departed on her second war patrol in the Bonin Islands area 27 July. She performed lifeguard duty in addition to offensive patrol. She returned via Midway to Pearl Harbor, 14 September.

&quot;Pilotfish&quot; departed 14 October via Midway Island on her third war patrol, again in the Bonins area. On 31 October she torpedoed and damaged a 4,000-ton cargo ship. On 2 November &quot;Pilotfish&quot; proceeded to the Nansei Shoto area for the balance of the patrol. After 57 days of patrol, she returned to Midway Island, arriving 10 December.

On 20 January 1945 &quot;Pilotfish&quot; departed on her fourth war patrol, in company with and . The group proceeded via Saipan to the East China Sea area, where a long patrol brought no contacts but a hospital ship and small craft. &quot;Pilotfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor, 25 March.

On 21 May &quot;Pilotfish&quot; departed for her fifth patrol. She spent fifteen days on lifeguard duty off Marcus Island, then proceeded to Tanapag Harbor, Saipan. On 20 June &quot;Pilotfish&quot; left for the second half of her lifeguard patrol in the vicinity of the Japanese Home Islands. &quot;Pilotfish&quot; arrived Apra Harbor, Guam, 14 July.

On 9 August &quot;Pilotfish&quot; departed on her sixth patrol, again to lifeguard duty. Only two days had been spent in the patrol area, southeast of Japan, when on 15 August the &quot;Cease Firing&quot; order arrived. &quot;Pilotfish&quot; remained on station off Kii Suido for continued lifeguard duty, and neutrality patrol. On 31 August &quot;Pilotfish&quot; rendezvoused with other ships and proceeded to Tokyo Kaiwan in order to participate in the initial occupation of Japan and the formal surrender ceremonies. The afternoon of 31 August all submarines of the formation moored alongside in Yokosuka Naval Basin.

On 3 September, &quot;Pilotfish&quot; got underway for Pearl Harbor and San Francisco.

==Disposal==
By a directive dated 1 July 1946, &quot;Pilotfish&quot; was selected for disposal by use as a target for Operation Crossroads atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. Moored 363 yards (332 meters) from &quot;surface zero,&quot; she was sunk by the Test Baker underwater atomic bomb explosion on 25 July 1946, the explosion′s pressure waves compressing her hull and forcing her hatches open, completely flooding her. She was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 February 1947.

Many sources claim that the wreck of &quot;Pilotfish&quot; was refloated, towed to Eniwetok Atoll, again used as an atomic bomb test target there during Operation Sandstone in 1948, and resunk off Eniwetok as a target on 16 October 1948. However, in 1991 the U.S. National Park Service reported that this narrative is incorrect, and that &quot;Pilotfish&quot;′s wreck was not salvaged after her 1946 sinking and remains on the bottom of the lagoon at Bikini Atoll.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Pilotfish&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

<text>In general topology and related areas of mathematics, the initial topology (or induced topology or strong topology or limit topology or projective topology) on a set formula_1 with respect to a family of functions on formula_1 is the coarsest topology on formula_3 that makes those functions continuous.

The subspace topology and product topology constructions are both special cases of initial topologies. Indeed, the initial topology construction can be viewed as a generalization of these.

The dual notion is the final topology, which for a given family of functions mapping to a set formula_4 is the finest topology on formula_4 that makes those functions continuous.

==Definition==

Given a set formula_3 and an indexed family formula_7 of topological spaces with functions
formula_8
the initial topology formula_9 on formula_3 is the coarsest topology on formula_3 such that each
formula_12
is continuous.

Definition in terms of open sets

If formula_13 is a family of topologies formula_3 indexed by formula_15 then the of these topologies is the coarsest topology on formula_3 that is finer than each formula_17 This topology always exists and it is equal to the topology generated by formula_18

If for every formula_19 formula_20 denotes the topology on formula_21 then formula_22 is a topology on formula_3, and the is the least upper bound topology of the formula_24-indexed family of topologies formula_25 (for formula_26). 
Explicitly, the initial topology is the collection of open sets generated by all sets of the form formula_27 where formula_28 is an open set in formula_29 for some formula_19 under finite intersections and arbitrary unions. 

Sets of the form formula_31 are often called . If formula_24 contains exactly one element, then all the open sets of the initial topology formula_33 are cylinder sets.

==Examples==

Several topological constructions can be regarded as special cases of the initial topology.
* The subspace topology is the initial topology on the subspace with respect to the inclusion map.
* The product topology is the initial topology with respect to the family of projection maps.
* The inverse limit of any inverse system of spaces and continuous maps is the set-theoretic inverse limit together with the initial topology determined by the canonical morphisms.
* The weak topology on a locally convex space is the initial topology with respect to the continuous linear forms of its dual space.
* Given a family of topologies formula_34 on a fixed set formula_3 the initial topology on formula_3 with respect to the functions formula_37 is the supremum (or join) of the topologies formula_34 in the lattice of topologies on formula_39 That is, the initial topology formula_9 is the topology generated by the union of the topologies formula_41
* A topological space is completely regular if and only if it has the initial topology with respect to its family of (bounded) real-valued continuous functions.
* Every topological space formula_3 has the initial topology with respect to the family of continuous functions from formula_3 to the Sierpiński space.

==Properties==

===Characteristic property===

The initial topology on formula_3 can be characterized by the following characteristic property:&lt;br&gt;
A function formula_45 from some space formula_46 to formula_3 is continuous if and only if formula_48 is continuous for each formula_49 

Note that, despite looking quite similar, this is not a universal property. A categorical description is given below.

A filter formula_50 on formula_3 converges to a point formula_52 if and only if the prefilter formula_53 converges to formula_54 for every formula_49

===Evaluation===

By the universal property of the product topology, we know that any family of continuous maps formula_56 determines a unique continuous map
formula_57

This map is known as the .

A family of maps formula_58 is said to &quot;&quot; in formula_3 if for all formula_60 in formula_3 there exists some formula_62 such that formula_63 The family formula_64 separates points if and only if the associated evaluation map formula_65 is injective.

The evaluation map formula_65 will be a topological embedding if and only if formula_3 has the initial topology determined by the maps formula_64 and this family of maps separates points in formula_39

===Hausdorffness===

If formula_3 has the initial topology induced by formula_71 and if every formula_29 is Hausdorff, then formula_3 is a Hausdorff space if and only if these maps separate points on formula_39

===Transitivity of the initial topology===

If formula_3 has the initial topology induced by the formula_24-indexed family of mappings formula_71 and if for every formula_19 the topology on formula_29 is the initial topology induced by some formula_80-indexed family of mappings formula_81 (as formula_82 ranges over formula_80), then the initial topology on formula_3 induced by formula_71 is equal to the initial topology induced by the formula_86-indexed family of mappings formula_87 as formula_62 ranges over formula_24 and formula_82 ranges over formula_91 
Several important corollaries of this fact are now given. 

In particular, if formula_92 then the subspace topology that formula_93 inherits from formula_3 is equal to the initial topology induced by the inclusion map formula_95 (defined by formula_96). Consequently, if formula_3 has the initial topology induced by formula_71 then the subspace topology that formula_93 inherits from formula_3 is equal to the initial topology induced on formula_93 by the restrictions formula_102 of the formula_103 to formula_104 

The product topology on formula_105 is equal to the initial topology induced by the canonical projections formula_106 as formula_62 ranges over formula_108
Consequently, the initial topology on formula_3 induced by formula_71 is equal to the inverse image of the product topology on formula_105 by the evaluation map formula_112 Furthermore, if the maps formula_113 separate points on formula_3 then the evaluation map is a homeomorphism onto the subspace formula_115 of the product space formula_116

===Separating points from closed sets===

If a space formula_3 comes equipped with a topology, it is often useful to know whether or not the topology on formula_3 is the initial topology induced by some family of maps on formula_39 This section gives a sufficient (but not necessary) condition.

A family of maps formula_71 &quot;separates points from closed sets&quot; in formula_3 if for all closed sets formula_122 in formula_3 and all formula_124 there exists some formula_62 such that
formula_126
where formula_127 denotes the closure operator.

:Theorem. A family of continuous maps formula_71 separates points from closed sets if and only if the cylinder sets formula_129 for formula_130 open in formula_21 form a base for the topology on formula_39

It follows that whenever formula_133 separates points from closed sets, the space formula_3 has the initial topology induced by the maps formula_135 The converse fails, since generally the cylinder sets will only form a subbase (and not a base) for the initial topology.

If the space formula_3 is a T0 space, then any collection of maps formula_133 that separates points from closed sets in formula_3 must also separate points. In this case, the evaluation map will be an embedding.

===Initial uniform structure===

If formula_139 is a family of uniform structures on formula_3 indexed by formula_15 then the of formula_139 is the coarsest uniform structure on formula_3 that is finer than each formula_144 This uniform always exists and it is equal to the filter on formula_145 generated by the filter subbase formula_146 
If formula_147 is the topology on formula_3 induced by the uniform structure formula_149 then the topology on formula_3 associated with least upper bound uniform structure is equal to the least upper bound topology of formula_151 

Now suppose that formula_71 is a family of maps and for every formula_19 let formula_149 be a uniform structure on formula_155 Then the is the unique coarsest uniform structure formula_156 on formula_3 making all formula_158 uniformly continuous. It is equal to the least upper bound uniform structure of the formula_24-indexed family of uniform structures formula_160 (for formula_26). 
The topology on formula_3 induced by formula_156 is the coarsest topology on formula_3 such that every formula_56 is continuous. 
The initial uniform structure formula_156 is also equal to the coarsest uniform structure such that the identity mappings formula_167 are uniformly continuous. 

Hausdorffness: The topology on formula_3 induced by the initial uniform structure formula_156 is Hausdorff if and only if for whenever formula_170 are distinct (formula_60) then there exists some formula_26 and some entourage formula_173 of formula_29 such that formula_175 
Furthermore, if for every index formula_19 the topology on formula_29 induced by formula_149 is Hausdorff then the topology on formula_3 induced by the initial uniform structure formula_156 is Hausdorff if and only if the maps formula_71 separate points on formula_3 (or equivalently, if and only if the evaluation map formula_183 is injective)

Uniform continuity: If formula_156 is the initial uniform structure induced by the mappings formula_185 then a function formula_45 from some uniform space formula_46 into formula_188 is uniformly continuous if and only if formula_189 is uniformly continuous for each formula_49 

Cauchy filter: A filter formula_50 on formula_3 is a Cauchy filter on formula_188 if and only if formula_194 is a Cauchy prefilter on formula_29 for every formula_49 

Transitivity of the initial uniform structure: If the word &quot;topology&quot; is replaced with &quot;uniform structure&quot; in the statement of &quot;transitivity of the initial topology&quot; given above, then the resulting statement will also be true.

==Categorical description==

In the language of category theory, the initial topology construction can be described as follows. Let formula_4 be the functor from a discrete category formula_198 to the category of topological spaces formula_199 which maps formula_200. Let formula_28 be the usual forgetful functor from formula_199 to formula_203. The maps formula_204 can then be thought of as a cone from formula_3 to formula_206 That is, formula_207 is an object of formula_208—the category of cones to formula_206 More precisely, this cone formula_207 defines a formula_28-structured cosink in formula_212

The forgetful functor formula_213 induces a functor formula_214. The characteristic property of the initial topology is equivalent to the statement that there exists a universal morphism from formula_215 to formula_216 that is, a terminal object in the category formula_217
Explicitly, this consists of an object formula_218 in formula_219 together with a morphism formula_220 such that for any object formula_221 in formula_219 and morphism formula_223 there exists a unique morphism formula_224 such that the following diagram commutes:

The assignment formula_225 placing the initial topology on formula_3 extends to a functor
formula_227
which is right adjoint to the forgetful functor formula_228 In fact, formula_24 is a right-inverse to formula_215; since formula_231 is the identity functor on formula_232

<text>Second Lieutenant Alfred Victor Smith VC (22 July 1891 – 22 December 1915), known to his family as Victor, was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Smith was 24 years old, and a Second lieutenant in the 1/5th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, British Army on 22 December 1915 at Helles, Gallipoli, Ottoman Turkey during the First World War, and who died in action for which he was awarded the VC. His citation reads:

He is buried in Twelve Tree Copse Cemetery in the Gallipoli peninsula, although the precise location of his grave within the cemetery is not known. He was also awarded a French Croix de Guerre.

Alfred Victor Smith’s father was a Police officer and although Alfred was born in Guildford, the family moved several times in his youth, and Alfred sang as a boy chorister in St Albans Cathedral Choir. At 14 his father was appointed chief constable of Burnley, and they moved to the town, with Alfred completing his education at Burnley Grammar School. After leaving school he joined Blackpool Borough Police force. He is named on commemorative plaques within the former Burnley Grammar School, St Catherine&#x27;s Church, Burnley, St Albans Cathedral, and the current Blackpool Police headquarters.

In November 2015 a commemorative stone was unveiled in Guildford.

His VC, along with other items, is on display at the Towneley Hall museum in Burnley.

<text>Admiral Sir Augustus Leopold Kuper (16 August 1809 – 28 October 1885) was a Royal Navy officer known for his commands in East Asia.

== Naval career ==
Kuper, whose ancestry was German, joined the navy in 1823 as a midshipman. On 20 February 1830 he became a lieutenant. On 17 October 1831 he was appointed a lieutenant in &quot;Savage&quot;, commanded by Lord Edward Russell, on the Irish station. On 9 April 1832, he followed Russell to &quot;Nimrod&quot;, off the coast of Spain. On 27 August 1833, John Macdougall succeeded Russell, still on the Spain–Portugal station. From 30 March 1836, he was a lieutenant in &quot;Minden&quot;, commanded by Alexander Renton Sharpe, at Lisbon. Then on 10 July 1837 he moved to &quot;Alligator&quot;, commanded by Gordon Bremer, at Australia, who was involved in founding the settlement at Port Essington.

From 27 July 1839, he was a lieutenant and acting captain of &quot; Pelorous&quot;. While he was captain &quot;Pelorus&quot; wrecked on 25 November by a cyclone at Port Essington. There were no casualties and eventually she was refloated. In December 1840 he was promoted to commander, retroactive to when he took command of &quot;Pelorus&quot;.

On 5 March 1840 he became Acting Captain in &quot;Alligator&quot;, and with her he participated in the First Opium War (1840–1842). On 8 June 1841 he received a promotion to captain, and on 14 June he took command of &quot;Calliope&quot; and participated in the operations that led to the capitulation of Canton, China (now Guangzhou). On 21 January 1842 he was made a Companion of the Bath (CB).

From 3 July 1850 to February 1854 he was captain in &quot;Thetis&quot; from her commissioning at Plymouth. He sailed her to the south-east coast of America and then the Pacific. Kuper Island in the Strait of Georgia, off the east coast of Vancouver Island, was named for him after he surveyed the area from 1851 to 1853.

From 13 August 1855 to 24 January 1856 he was the captain of HMS &quot;London&quot; in the Mediterranean.

In 1861 he was promoted to rear-admiral and in 1862 he succeeded Admiral Sir James Hope as Commander-in-Chief, East Indies and China Station. His tenure coincided with the later stages of British involvement in the Taiping Rebellion. To achieve parity with the French navy, whose local commander-in-chief was a Vice-Admiral, Kuper was given temporary promotion to vice admiral.

In August 1863 he hoisted his flag in the wooden screw-frigate &quot;Euryalus&quot; and led a British squadron of seven warships to Kagoshima to coerce the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Satsuma into paying the £25,000 demanded by the British Government as reparation to the British victims of the Namamugi Incident. During the Bombardment of Kagoshima the captain of &quot;Euryalus&quot;, John James Steven Josling, was killed, as was his second-in-command, Commander Wilmot, both decapitated by the same cannonball.

In 1864 Kuper was in command of the International fleet at the Shimonoseki Expedition, Japan, the action fought to reopen the Inland Sea and the Straits of Shimonoseki. His interpreter at Shimonoseki was Ernest Satow. Kuper was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 25 February 1864 &#x27;in acknowledgement of his services at Kagoshima&#x27;. In due course, i.e., on 2 June 1869, he became a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath (GCB) and promoted to the rank of vice-admiral in 1866 and to admiral in 1872.

== Family ==
On 19 June 1837 he married Emma Margaret, eldest daughter of Rear Admiral Sir Gordon Bremer. Kuper had served under Bremer during the Opium Wars.

<text>Archibald Bisset Smith VC (19 December 1878 – 10 March 1917) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Smith is one of only two members of the UK Merchant Navy to have been awarded the VC for his First World War service.

==World War I action and Victoria Cross==
Smith received this award for his action as Master of the New Zealand Shipping Company cargo ship . On 10 March 1917 in the Atlantic Ocean, &quot;Otaki&quot;, armed with one 4.7-inch gun, sighted the German merchant raider , which was armed with four 150 mm, one 105 mm and two 500 mm torpedo launches guns.

The raider ordered &quot;Otaki&quot; to stop but Captain Smith refused. A duel ensued, during which &quot;Otaki&quot; secured a number of hits and caused &quot;Möwe&quot; considerable damage, but &quot;Otaki&quot; sustained much damage and was on fire. Captain Smith therefore ordered his crew to abandon ship, but he himself stayed aboard and went down with his ship.

His citation reads:

As a Merchant officer, Smith could not receive the VC at that time. In 1919 he was posthumously commissioned as a temporary lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, which entitled him to receive the VC posthumously.

As a British Merchant seafarer with no known grave, Smith is commemorated on the Tower Hill Memorial. On 10 March 2017 a memorial stone was laid at Schoolhill, Aberdeen, to commemorate the centenary of his action.

His VC is preserved at the P&amp;O Heritage Collection in London.

==Personal life==
Smith was born at Cosie Brae in Cults on 19 December 1878, one of five children of William Smith, an accountant and wholesale merchant, and Annie Smith (née Nicol), both originally from Rhynie. William Smith was a descendant of Bold Peter Smith, a Jacobite killed at the Battle of Culloden.

Archibald was a student at Robert Gordon&#x27;s College before joining the Merchant Navy in 1895. He gained his Master&#x27;s ticket in 1903 while serving with the New Zealand Shipping Company, and served on the steamers &quot;Waikato&quot;, &quot;Rakaia&quot;, &quot;Waimate&quot; and &quot;Turakina&quot;.

Shortly before World War I, Smith married Edith Clulee (née Powell), whom he had met while working in Port Chalmers, New Zealand. She had a son, Alfred, from a previous marriage. Alfred later took his stepfather&#x27;s surname.

==Legacy==
In November 1917 Smith was awarded a posthumous commendation. After the armistice of 11 November 1918 more details of the battle reached the UK authorities. &quot;Möwe&quot;″s captain, Nikolaus zu Dohna-Schlodien, described &quot;Otaki&quot;″s resistance as &quot;a duel as gallant as naval history can relate&quot;. In May 1919 Smith was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

King George V presented Smith&#x27;s VC to Edith and Alfred at Buckingham Palace. After Edith&#x27;s death in 1951, Alfred sold the VC and Archibald&#x27;s other medals (the British War Medal, Victory Medal, and Mercantile Marine Medal) to the New Zealand Shipping Company for £ 125.

In 1937 his family presented the Otaki Shield to Robert Gordon&#x27;s College, to be an annual award to the senior boy who is judged &quot;pre-eminent in character, in leadership and in athletics&quot;. The shield is accompanied by the prize of six weeks in New Zealand as Otaki Scholar, visiting various schools as a &quot;roving ambassador&quot; for the college.

<text>Brigadier General Clement Leslie Smith, (17 January 1878 – 14 December 1927) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Smith was commissioned into the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry as a second lieutenant on 5 May 1900, and the following year served in South Africa as a Railway Staff officer during the Second Boer War. After the end of the war (in June 1902), he was promoted to lieutenant on 9 August 1902, and left South Africa for England on the SS &quot;Simla&quot; in October that year.

===Details on Victoria Cross===
Smith was 25 years old, serving in the 2nd Battalion, Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry, attached to the 5th Somaliland Light Infantry during the Fourth Somaliland Expedition when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 10 January 1904 at the commencement of the fight at Jidballi, British Somaliland, Lieutenant Smith and a medical officer tried to rescue a hospital assistant who was wounded. The rapidity of the enemy&#x27;s fire, however, made this impossible and the hospital assistant was killed. Lieutenant Smith then did all that was possible to bring out the medical officer, helping him to mount a horse and, when this was shot, a mule. This animal also was shot and the medical officer was killed, but the lieutenant stayed with him to the end, trying to keep off the enemy with his revolver.

===Later career===
Smith later advanced to the rank of brigadier general. During the First World War he commanded the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade based in Egypt.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry Museum in Bodmin, Cornwall, England.

<doc id="1197159" wikidata="Q856192" url="?curid=1197159" title="The Illustrated London News">
<text>The Illustrated London News, founded by Herbert Ingram and first published on Saturday 14 May 1842, was the world&#x27;s first illustrated weekly news magazine. The magazine was published weekly for most of its existence, switched to a less frequent publication schedule in 1971, and eventually ceased publication in 2003. The company continues today as Illustrated London News Ltd, a publishing, content, and digital agency in London, which holds the publication and business archives of the magazine.

==History==
===1842–1860: Herbert Ingram===
&quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; founder Herbert Ingram was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, in 1811, and opened a printing, newsagent, and bookselling business in Nottingham around 1834 in partnership with his brother-in-law, Nathaniel Cooke. As a newsagent, Ingram was struck by the reliable increase in newspaper sales when they featured pictures and shocking stories. Ingram began to plan a weekly newspaper that would contain pictures in every edition.

Ingram rented an office, recruited artists and reporters, and employed as his editor Frederick William Naylor Bayley (1808–1853), formerly editor of the &quot;National Omnibus&quot;. The first issue of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; appeared on Saturday, 14 May 1842, timed to report on the young Queen Victoria&#x27;s first masquerade ball. The 16 pages and 32 wood engravings of that first edition covered topics such as the war in Afghanistan, the Versailles rail accident, a survey of the candidates for the US presidential election, extensive crime reports, theatre and book reviews, and a list of births, marriages, and deaths. Ingram hired 200 men to carry placards through the streets of London promoting the first edition of his new newspaper.
Costing sixpence, the first issue sold 26,000 copies. Despite this initial success, sales of the second and subsequent editions were disappointing. However, Ingram was determined to make his newspaper a success, and sent every clergyman in the country a copy of the edition that contained illustrations of the installation of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and by this means secured a great many new subscribers.

Its circulation soon increased to 40,000, and by the end of its first year was 60,000. In 1851, after the newspaper published Joseph Paxton&#x27;s designs for the Crystal Palace before even Prince Albert had seen them, the circulation rose to 130,000. In 1852, when it produced a special edition covering the funeral of the Duke of Wellington, sales increased to 150,000. In 1855, mainly due to the newspaper reproducing some of Roger Fenton&#x27;s pioneering photographs of the Crimean War, and due to the abolition of the Stamp Act that taxed newspapers, it sold 200,000 copies per week.

Competitors soon began to appear. &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Illustrated Paper&quot; was founded later that year, while &quot;Reynold&#x27;s Newspaper&quot; opened in 1850. Both were successful Victorian publications, albeit less successful than &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;. Andrew Spottiswoode&#x27;s &quot;Pictorial Times&quot; lost £20,000 before it was sold to Ingram by Henry Vizetelly, who had left the &quot;ILN&quot; to found it. Ingram folded it into another purchase, &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Newspaper&quot;, which became &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Newspaper and Pictorial Times&quot;. Vizetelly was also behind a later competitor, &quot;Illustrated Times&quot; in 1855, which was similarly bought out by Ingram in 1859.

Ingram&#x27;s other early collaborators left the business in the 1850s. Nathanial Cooke, his business partner and brother-in-law, found himself in a subordinate role in the business and parted on bad terms around 1854. The departure of William Little was in 1858. In addition to providing a loan of £10,000, he was the printer and publisher of the paper for 15 years. Little&#x27;s relationship with Ingram deteriorated over Ingram&#x27;s harassment of their mutual sister-in-law.

Herbert Ingram died on 8 September 1860 in a paddle-steamer accident on Lake Michigan, and he was succeeded as proprietor by his youngest son, William Ingram, who in turn was succeeded by his son, Sir Bruce Ingram (1877–1963) in 1900, who remained as editor until his death.

===1860–1900: William and Charles Ingram===
By 1863, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; was selling more than 300,000 copies every week, enormous figures in comparison to other British newspapers of the time. The death of Herbert and his eldest son left the company without a director and manager. Control passed to Ingram&#x27;s widow Ann, and his friend Sir Edward William Watkin, who managed the business for 12 years. Once Ingram&#x27;s two younger sons, William and Charles, were old enough, they took over as managing directors, although William took the lead.

This was also a period of expansion and increased competition for the &quot;ILN&quot;. As reading habits and the illustrated news market changed, the &quot;ILN&quot; bought or established a number of new publications, evolving from a single newspaper to a larger-scale publishing business. As with Herbert Ingram&#x27;s purchases in the 1850s, this expansion was also an effective way of managing competition – dominating markets and buying out competing ventures. As with the acquisitions of the 1850s, several similar illustrated publications were established in this period by former employees of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;.

Serious competition for the &quot;ILN&quot; appeared in 1869, with the establishment of &quot;The Graphic&quot;, a weekly illustrated paper co-founded by William Luson Thomas. Thomas was a former wood engraver for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, and brought his expertise in illustrated publishing to his new magazine. &quot;The Graphic&quot; was highly popular, particularly for its coverage of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and was well regarded among artists; Vincent van Gogh was a particular admirer.

William Ingram became chief proprietor of &quot;The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News&quot;, est. 1874, and &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Pictorial&quot;, which may have been a later title of &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Newspaper and Pictorial Times&quot;.
&quot;The Penny Illustrated Paper&quot;, aimed at a working-class readership, was established by the news company shortly after Ingram&#x27;s death in 1861 in response to the abolition of stamp and paper taxes, which made cheaper publications possible. &quot;The Penny Illustrated Paper&quot; ran until 1913.

In 1893, the &quot;ILN&quot; established &quot;The Sketch&quot;, a sister publication that covered lighter news and society events with the same focus on illustration. From this point, the name of the company changed to the Illustrated London News and Sketch Ltd.

In 1899, &quot;ILN&quot; editor Clement Shorter left the paper to found his own publication, &quot;The Sphere&quot;, which published its first issue on 27 January 1900. Ingram and &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; responded by establishing a competing magazine, &quot;The Spear&quot;, which appeared two days before &quot;The Sphere&quot; on 25 January 1900. The name was deliberately chosen to confuse and siphon off readers, and advertisements for &quot;The Sphere&quot; emphasised the difference between the magazines: &quot;S-P-H-E-R-E… you may be offered something else you don&#x27;t want.&quot;

While editor of the &quot;ILN&quot;, Clement Shorter had been instrumental in the establishment and publication of &quot;The Sketch&quot;. In 1903, he established &quot;The Tatler&quot; as a similar sister publication for &quot;The Sphere&quot;, with a similar focus on illustrated culture and society news. With the departure of Shorter, the role of editor of the &quot;ILN&quot; was taken over by Bruce Ingram, the 23-year-old grandson of the paper&#x27;s founder.

===1900–1963: Bruce Ingram===
Bruce Ingram was editor of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; and (from 1905) &quot;The Sketch&quot;, and ran the company for the next 63 years, presiding over some significant changes in the newspaper and the publishing business as a whole.

Photographic and printing techniques were advancing in the later years of the 19th century, and &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; began to introduce photos and artwork into its depictions of weekly events. From about 1890, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; made increasing use of photography. The tradition of graphic illustrations continued until the end of World War I. Often, rough sketches of distant events with handwritten explanations were supplied by observers and then worked on by artists in London to produce polished end products for publication. This was particularly the case where popular subjects such as colonial or foreign military campaigns did not lend themselves to clear illustration using the limited camera technology of the period. By the 1920s and 1930s, the pictures that dominated each issue of the magazine were almost exclusively photographic, although artists might still be used to illustrate in pictorial form topics such as budgetary expenditure or the layout of coal mines.

In 1928, a major business merger had &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; move to new headquarters at Inveresk House, 1 Aldwych, (also known as 364 Strand), London, where &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; and &quot;The Sketch&quot; were united with six of their former competitors under the parent company, Illustrated News Ltd. As eight of the largest titles in illustrated news, these were newly dubbed the &quot;Great Eight&quot; publications. &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, the flagship publication, was supported by sister publications &quot;The Sketch&quot;, &quot;The Sphere&quot;, &quot;The Tatler&quot;, &quot;The Graphic&quot;, &quot;The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News&quot;, &quot;The Bystander&quot;, and &quot;Eve&quot;. With the exception of &quot;The Tatler&quot;, these publications remained as part of Illustrated News Ltd. until their closure at various times in the 20th century.

The centenary of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; in 1942 was muted due to wartime conditions, including restrictions on the use of paper. The occasion was marked in the paper with a set of specially commissioned colour photographs of the royal family, including the future Queen Elizabeth.
By the time of his death in 1963, Ingram was a major figure in the newspaper industry, and the longest-standing editor of his day.

In the postwar period, print publications were gradually displaced from their central position in reporting news events, and circulation began to fall for all the illustrated weeklies. Many of the Great Eight publications were closed down after the Second World War; &quot;The Sketch&quot;, &quot;The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News&quot;, and &quot;The Sphere&quot; all ceased publication in these years.

In 1961, Illustrated Newspapers Ltd was bought by International Thomson, headed by Roy Thomson, a Canadian newspaper mogul. &quot;The Sphere&quot; ceased publication in 1964, while &quot;The Tatler&quot; was sold in 1968. It was later revived and relaunched in 1977. With circulation figures continuing to fall, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; switched from weekly to monthly publication in 1971, with a new focus on in-depth reporting and selective coverage of world events. This strategy continued into the late 1980s, when the paper reduced its frequency to four issues a year.

In 1985, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; and the archives of the Great Eight publications were sold to Sea Containers, an international transport corporation headed by James Sherwood. Along with the Illustrated London News Group, Sea Containers operated the Orient Express and Great North Eastern Railway, and a range of luxury hotels. As part of this activity, Illustrated London News Group launched a luxury travel and lifestyle magazine, &quot;Orient Express&quot;.

In 1994, publication of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; was reduced further to two issues a year, and the publishing activity of the Illustrated London News Group focused increasingly on the &quot;Orient Express&quot; magazine. After publishing its last Christmas number in 2001, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; was relaunched in 2003 under the editorship of Mark Palmer, which ran for one issue before finally ceasing publication for good.

In 2007, The Illustrated London News Group underwent a management buy-out, and was re-established as Illustrated London News Ltd. From 2007, it has continued its activity as an independent content and creative agency. In 2007, the former &quot;Orient Express&quot; magazine was relaunched as &quot;Sphere&quot;, a luxury lifestyle and travel magazine. In addition to its independent publications, Illustrated London News Ltd now acts as a content agency for various other luxury and heritage organisations.

Illustrated London News Ltd also manages and curates the newspaper and business archive of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; and the Great Eight publications, publishing short books and magazines of historical content from the Great Eight publication archives. In 2010, Gale digitised the entire back catalogue of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; (1842–2003), and in 2014 began digitalizing the remaining seven publications in the Great Eight. To mark the centenary of the First World War in July 2014, ILN Ltd launched illustratedfirstworldwar.com, a free historical resource funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The entire run of the Great Eight publications between 1914 and 1918 is available on this site.

The company operates at 46–48 East Smithfield Street.

In May 2024, Illustrated London News Ltd fell into administration and has subsequently appointed Opus Restructuring Llp of 1 Radian Court, Knowlhill, Milton Keynes, MK5 8PJ to wind up the company, bringing nearly 200 years of publication to an end.

<text>Edward Benn (&#x27;Ned&#x27;) Smith VC, DCM (10 November 1898 – 12 January 1940) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==World War I==
He is unusual in having gained both the DCM and VC, and in quick succession, during the Hundred Days Offensive.

===Distinguished Conduct Medal===
On 10 August 1918, then a Corporal with the 1/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, Smith was leading a daylight patrol near Hébuterne in the Somme Area of France to examine points in the German lines where information was required. As the patrol was about to retire, he saw a party of about 40 Germans about to take up outpost duty. Despite being heavily outnumbered by the German soldiers, Smith led his small party of men and engaged the enemy, breaking up the German party and causing severe casualties. As well as receiving the Distinguished Conduct Medal for this action, he was promoted to the rank of lance sergeant.

===Victoria Cross===
Eleven days later, during the period 21/23 August 1918, east of Serre, France, Smith while in command of a platoon, took a machine-gun post at The Lozenge (Hill 140), rushing the garrison with his rifle and bayonet. The enemy on seeing him coming, scattered to throw hand grenades at him, but heedless of all danger and almost without halting in his rush, he shot at least six of them. Later, seeing another platoon needing assistance, he led his men to them, took command and captured the objective. During an enemy counter-attack the following day he led a section forward and restored a portion of the line. According to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; Supplement of 18 October 1918, &quot;His personal bravery, skill and initiative were outstanding, and his conduct throughout an inspiring example to all.&quot;

==Interwar==
According to &quot;The Whitehaven News&quot;, a local West Cumbrian newspaper, when he returned to his home town of Maryport after the war in 1919, he was greeted by a cheering crowd of 6,000 people, equivalent to the town&#x27;s total population at the time. Another local newspaper described Smith in the following terms: 

He continued serving, from 1918 to 1938, in China, Malaya and Ireland, before retiring with an Army pension having attained the rank of Regimental Sergeant Major. He then joined the Corps of Commissionaires in London for about a year.

In 1921, he attended a Garden Party held at Buckingham Palace by King George V of the United Kingdom for Victoria Cross holders, as the youngest recipient present. He never married.

==World War II==
As war loomed in summer 1939, he re-enlisted with his former Regiment, the Lancashire Fusiliers, and was among the first contingent of the British Expeditionary Force to sail for France.

He was a Lieutenant and quartermaster when he died in France from a gunshot wound in the head on 12 January 1940, just under four months before the start of the Battle of France in May. Smith is buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery of Beuvry Communal Cemetery Extension.

<text>Hatano Hideharu (波多野 秀治 &quot;Hatano Hideharu&quot;, 1541 – June 25, 1579) was the eldest son of Hatano Harumichi and the head of Hatano clan. 
He was a son of Harumichi, but for an unknown reason, he was adopted as a son by Hatano Motohide.

The Hatano clan had, from the time of Hideharu&#x27;s grandfather Hatano Tanemichi, been retainers to the powerful Miyoshi clan and its leader Miyoshi Nagayoshi. Following tradition Hideharu had been the Miyoshi&#x27;s retainer as well. The reason that such a minor clan as his had attended the Emperor Ōgimachi&#x27;s coronation is believed to be due to the influence of Nagayoshi.

Hideharu became independent in 1565 after Nagayoshi died, capturing Yakami Castle, which Hideharu took as his place of residence.

The Hatano clan&#x27;s land, however, was situated in the way of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s passage to Kyoto and after several battles, Hideharu surrendered to Nobunaga&#x27;s general Akechi Mitsuhide. In 1576, Hideharu declared independence and turned against Nobunaga. Infuriated, Nobunaga again ordered Mitsuhide to invade Tanba Province, but Hideharu remained in the castle and held together a resistance for three years. The leader of the Hatano Clan&#x27;s retainers, the Akai clan, Akai Naomasa, also known as Hatano Naomasa, died defending the Hatano stronghold of Kuroi Castle against Akechi Mitsuhide at the start of the resistance in 1576.

According to a record kept by Oda clan, Mitsuhide offered his mother as a hostage to allow to Hideharu surrender with dignity. Hideharu complied knowing that he could not hold out indefinitely. However, after arriving at Azuchi Castle to offer an apology, Hideharu was executed by Nobunaga. His troops in Yakami Castle, hearing that Hideharu had been executed, killed Mitsuhide&#x27;s mother. This incident strained the relationship between Nobunaga and Mitsuhide, eventually culminating in Mitsuhide killing Nobunaga at Honnō-ji in 1582. However, there is little evidence that these events actually happened and it is unlikely Mitsuhide would offer such questionable truce. After Hideharu&#x27;s death, no one rose to hold together the Hatano clan and the clan eventually split apart. With there still being direct descendants today but very few still remain.

In January 2013, Pasqaule became one of twelve celebrities participating in the eighth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, with skating partner Vicky Ogden. They were eliminated on 10 February, claiming sixth place.

===Allegations of plagiarism===
Pasquale has been accused of joke theft by Stewart Lee, who incorporated his allegations as part of Lee&#x27;s comedy routine. Frank Skinner accused Pasquale of plagiarism in 2010, in using a routine about a rollercoaster prank from one of Skinner&#x27;s DVD performances.

===Other work===
Pasquale wrote the musical stage version of &quot;Rentaghost&quot; which toured the UK in 2006.

On 24 September 2005, the 30-minute Breakout Trust DVD, entitled &quot;It&#x27;s a Boy&quot;, was published. Pasquale starred as the voice of an Innkeeper named Garralus. Alongside him were performers such as Cannon and Ball, and Sir Cliff Richard. The production was a new take on the nativity story and was released in time for Christmas 2005. 

Pasquale performed the voice of a rat in the 2006 film &quot;&quot;, also as the voice of The Dentist in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot;

<doc id="1197175" wikidata="Q615861" url="?curid=1197175" title="Trango Towers">
<text>The Trango Towers () are a family of rock towers situated in the Gilgit-Baltistan region, in the northern part of Pakistan. The Towers have some of the world&#x27;s largest cliffs and offer some of the most challenging big wall climbing opportunities. Each year, climbers from around the world embark on expeditions to the Karakoram region to climb these granite faces. The Trango Towers are situated to the north of the Baltoro Glacier and are part of the Baltoro Muztagh, which is a sub-range within the Karakoram mountain range. The highest point within the group is the summit of &quot;Great Trango Tower&quot; at , the east face of which features the world&#x27;s greatest nearly vertical drop.

==Structure of the group==

All of the Trango Towers lie on a ridge, running northwest to southeast, with Trango Glacier to the west and the Dunge Glacier to the east. Great Trango itself is a large massif, with three distinct summits: Main (), East (), and West (). It is a complex combination of steep snow/ice gullies, steeper rock faces, and vertical to overhanging headwalls, topped by a snowy ridge system.

Just northwest of Great Trango is the &quot;Trango Tower&quot; (), often called &quot;&quot;Nameless Tower&quot;. This is a very large, pointed, rather symmetrical spire which juts out of the ridgeline. North of Trango Tower is a smaller rock spire known as &quot;Trango Monk&quot;.&quot; To the north of this feature, the ridge becomes less rocky and loses the large granite walls that distinguish the Trango Towers group and make them so attractive to climbers; however, the summits do get higher. These summits are not usually considered part of the Trango Towers group, though they share the Trango name. &quot;Trango II&quot; () lies northwest of the Monk, and the highest summit on the ridge, &quot;Trango Ri&quot; (), lies northwest of Trango II.

Just southeast of Great Trango (really a part of its southeast ridge) is the &quot;Trango Pulpit&quot; (), whose walls present similar climbing challenges to those of Great Trango itself. Further, to the south is &quot;Trango Castle&quot; (), the last large peak along the ridge before the Baltoro Glacier.

==Climbing history==

Overall, the Trango Towers group has seen some of the most difficult and significant big wall climbs ever accomplished, due to the combination of altitude, total height of the routes, and the steepness of the rock. All of the routes are highly technical climbs.
===Great Trango===

====Main summit====

* 1977 South Face. Great Trango was first climbed in 1977 by Galen Rowell, John Roskelley, Kim Schmitz, Jim Morrissey, and Dennis Hennek by a route that started from the west side (Trango Glacier), and climbed a combination of ice ramps and gullies with rock faces, finishing on the upper South Face.
* 1984 Northwest Face. Another long alpine route on Great Trango is on the Northwest Face, and was climbed in 1984 by Andy Selters and Scott Woolums. This is a long technical alpine climb with extensive rock and ice climbing.

====East face and summit====
* 1984 East Face. The east face of the Great Trango was first climbed (to the East Summit) in 1984 by the Norwegians Hans Christian Doseth and Finn Dæhli, who both died on the descent.
* 1992 The Grand Voyage (VII 5.10 A4+ WI3), duration 18 days. The first successful climb of and return from the East Summit was in 1992, by Xaver Bongard and John Middendorf, via &quot;The Grand Voyage&quot;, a route parallel to that of the ill-fated Norwegians, and the only route ever completed up the 1,340 m east-southeast headwall. These two climbs have been called &quot;perhaps the hardest big-wall climbs in the world.&quot;
* 1999 Parallel Worlds (VII 5.11 A4). Alex Lowe, Mark Synnott, Jared Ogden, duration 28 days

===Trango (Nameless) Tower===

Trango (Nameless) Tower was first climbed in 1976 by the British climber Joe Brown, along with Mo Anthoine, Martin Boysen, and Malcolm Howells. There are at least eight separate routes to the summit.

After several unsuccessful attempts, the second and third ascents were achieved in 1987, with the opening of two new routes:
The Slovenian Route, better known as the Yugoslav Route, a pure, clean, logical crack route on the south-southeast face, by Slavko Cankar, and Bojan Šrot, and the Great Overhanging Dihedral Route, a spectacular and technical ascent on the western pillar, by Swiss/French team Michel &quot;Tchouky&quot; Fauquet, Patrick Delale, Michel Piola and Stephane Schaffter.

The first route that was freed (using fixed lines to return to a base each night), in 1988, was the Yugoslav Route by the German team Kurt Albert, Wolfgang Güllich, and Hartmut Münchenbach.

Another notable route is &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; (named after a Bangles song), first climbed on 20 September 1989 by Kurt Albert, Wolfgang Güllich, Milan Sykora, and Christoph Stiegler. This route ascends the South-East Face of the Tower and was climbed almost entirely free.
These climbs inaugurated an era of pure rock-climbing techniques and aesthetics on high-altitude peaks.

The first female ascent, on 6 September 1990, was achieved in free climbing style, again on the Yugoslav Route, by Catherine Destivelle (with Jeff Lowe, and David Breashears filming).

In the summer of 2009, Franz Hinterbrandner, Mario Walder and Alexander, and Thomas Huber did the first free ascent of Eternal Flame.

===Other summits===

In 1999, the West Summit of Great Trango and the Trango Pulpit saw their first ascent. Two teams, one American and one Russian, nearly simultaneously, by parallel routes. The American team of Alex Lowe, Jared Ogden, and Mark Synnott climbed a long, bold, highly technical line that they called &quot;Parallel Worlds.&quot; They reported difficulties up to 5.11 and A4. The Russian team of Igor Potan&#x27;kin, Alexandr Odintsov, Ivan Samoilenko, and Yuri Koshelenko climbed an equally proud route (Eclissi) and encountered similar technical challenges. Both climbs were nominated for the prestigious Piolet d&#x27;Or award in 1999. The northeast face on the Pulpit was climbed by a Norwegian team (&quot;Norwegian Direct&quot;, Robert Caspersen, Gunnar Karlsen, Per L. Skjerven, and Einar Wold) over a total of 38 days on the wall. The team reported of difficulties up to A4/5.11.
Another route over Trango Pulpit is More Czech Less Slovak route VII 7-UIAA A2 (Southeast Ridge). It was climbed by a 1999 Czechoslovak team (Ivo Wondracek, Tomas Rinn, Pavel Weisser, Jaro Dutka, and Michal Drasar).

===BASE jump===

On 26 August 1992, Australians Nic Feteris and Glenn Singleman climbed Great Trango and then BASE jumped from an elevation of from the Northeast Face (on the other side of the Norwegian Pillar from the East Face wall), landing on the northern side of the Dunge Glacier at an altitude of . This was the highest starting elevation for a BASE jump on record. On 10 August 2013, Andrey Lebedev and Vladimir Murzaev performed a base jump from the same location as Feteris and Singleman on a low budget and with little fanfare.
In 2023 Eric Jamet and Antoine Pecher repeated Australians Feteris &amp; Singleman&#x27;s jump. Then the pair went on to climb the Eternal Flame route Nameless Tower in Pakistan (), which they also BASE jumped.
They submitted a 26 minute film to the Banff film festival that has been part of the 2023 &amp; 2024 roadshow. 

=== Ski Descent ===
On 9 May 2024, Chantel Astorga, Christina Lustenberger and Jim Morrison made the first ski descent of Great Trango Tower via the west face.

===Recent ascents===

Some more recent ascents on Great Trango have focused on the longer routes found on the west and south sides. In particular, in 2004 Josh Wharton and Kelly Cordes completed a new, very long () route on the Southwest Ridge, or &quot;Azeem Ridge&quot;, to the Southwest Summit. Though not as extremely technical as the East Face routes, the climb was notable for the extremely lightweight and fast (5 days) style in which it was done.

Over 7 days in August 2005, two Slovak climbers, Gabo Cmarik and Jozef Kopold, climbed a new route, which they termed &quot;Assalam Alaikum&quot;, to the right of the Wharton/Cordes line on the south face of Great Trango. The climb comprised around 90 pitches, up to 5.11d A2. They used a lightweight style similar to that of Wharton and Cordes.

In the same month, Samuel Johnson, Jonathon Clearwater, and Jeremy Frimer made the first ascent of the southwest ridge of Trango II, which they termed &quot;Severance Ridge&quot;. The route involved 1,600 m of climbing over five days, with rock climbing up to 5.11 A2 and ice and mixed climbing up to AI3 M5.

During May/June 2008, the Norwegian route on the east face of Great Trango (1984) was repeated by the four Norwegian climbers Rolf Bae, Bjarte Bø, Sigurd Felde, and Stein-Ivar Gravdal, spending 27 days in the wall to reach the summit and three more days for the descent. This is reportedly the first repetition of the route, and thus also the first successful ascent and return. Rolf Bae died later that summer. He was one of 11 climbers who were killed in the 2008 K2 disaster.

In mid-August 2009, Alexander and Thomas Huber managed to make an all free ascent of &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; on Nameless Tower, with climbing up to French grade 7c+.

<text>Harold Sumberg (August 25, 1905 – January 6, 1994) was an American-born Canadian violinist, teacher, conductor, and adjudicator.

Born in Rochester, New York, he studied violin with Carl Markees, Henry Holst, and Willy Hess at the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin (now the Berlin University of the Arts). Sumberg taught for many years at the Royal Conservatory of Music (Toronto) and founded the Conservatory String Quartet in 1929.

He performed with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra as principal second violin (1931-1957) and then associate concertmaster (1961-1975). He performed as a soloist and collaborated with many important musicians, such as Glenn Gould. In 1967 he recorded with Duke Ellington on Ellington’s &quot;North of the Border&quot; album. He adjudicated at festivals including &quot;Canadian Open Old Time Fiddlers&#x27; Contest&quot; 1955-84.

Sumberg was also known for his collection of fine violin bows. He often played on a Collin-Mezin violin, though it was not the finest instrument in his collection, which may have been a superb violin bearing the label Lorenzo Guadagnini, on which he played for many years.

He died in Toronto, Ontario in 1994. He was buried in the Mount Sinai Memorial Park.

<text>Mia Abagale Tallarico (born December 22, 1978), better known as Mia Tyler, is an American actress, model, media personality and socialite.

==Early life and education==

Tyler is the daughter of rock singer Steven Tyler of the band Aerosmith and actress Cyrinda Foxe. She was born at Alice Peck Day Hospital in Lebanon, New Hampshire, and raised nearby, primarily by Lake Sunapee. She is the paternal half-sister of actress Liv Tyler (whose mother is model and singer Bebe Buell). In 1979, Steven Tyler wrote a song titled after Mia, which was released on the Aerosmith album &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;.

Tyler&#x27;s parents divorced in 1987, and by 1990 she and her mother relocated from New Hampshire to New York City. Her mother died in 2002 of a brain tumor (diagnosed in 1997).

==Career==
At age 17, Tyler appeared as a VJ on the MTV show &quot;House of Style&quot;. Primarily a plus sized fashion model, she has been represented by the modeling agency Wilhelmina Models. She has appeared in such elite magazines as &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Teen&quot;, &quot;Teen People&quot;, &quot;Mode&quot;, &quot;Us&quot;, &quot;Jump&quot;, &quot;YM&quot;, &quot;Moxie Girl&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot; and on the cover of &quot;Flare&quot;. She modeled for H&amp;M, MXM], Penningtons and Lane Bryant. She has also appeared on the runways of New York and Paris.

Tyler launched her own clothing line, Revolution 1228, in February 2009.

In 2005 Tyler was a member of the VH1 reality show &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;, and featured in &quot;Really Rich Real Estate&quot;, also on VH1, in 2006. In March 2009, Tyler was a judge on &quot;Pretty Wicked&quot;, a reality show that airs on the Oxygen network.

She has had a few acting roles, including Marsha in &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;, and in &quot;A Little Bit of Lipstick&quot;.

In 2008, Tyler released her autobiography &quot;Creating Myself&quot;.

She held art shows at various galleries, featuring her X-rated, adult-theme paintings, in 2012.

Tyler along with Steven both appeared in the Season 13 episode of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; as chef&#x27;s table guests in the red kitchen.

==Personal life==
Tyler lived for many years in Sacramento.

In 2002, Tyler married ex-Papa Roach drummer Dave Buckner in Sacramento, California; the two were divorced in 2005. She was also engaged to guitarist Brian Harrah, but the couple broke up in 2008. Mia gave birth on May 10, 2017, to Axton Joseph Tallarico, a son from a brief relationship with boxer Dan Coleman.

After dating former &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; contestant Joseph Tinnelly for three years, Tyler announced their break up in September 2023.
In February of 2024, Mia began dating her long time friend, vocalist Dewey Bragg, lead singer of Moth and Kill Devil Hill.

<doc id="1197184" wikidata="Q2762418" url="?curid=1197184" title="Formal proof">
<text>In logic and mathematics, a formal proof or derivation is a finite sequence of sentences (known as well-formed formulas when relating to formal language), each of which is an axiom, an assumption, or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence, according to the rule of inference. It differs from a natural language argument in that it is rigorous, unambiguous and mechanically verifiable. If the set of assumptions is empty, then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a theorem of the formal system. The notion of theorem is generally effective, but there may be no method by which we can reliably find proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists. The concepts of Fitch-style proof, sequent calculus and natural deduction are generalizations of the concept of proof.

The theorem is a syntactic consequence of all the well-formed formulas preceding it in the proof. For a well-formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus (of some formal system) to the previous well-formed formulas in the proof sequence.

Formal proofs often are constructed with the help of computers in interactive theorem proving (e.g., through the use of proof checker and automated theorem prover). Significantly, these proofs can be checked automatically, also by computer. Checking formal proofs is usually simple, while the problem of &quot;finding&quot; proofs (automated theorem proving) is usually computationally intractable and/or only semi-decidable, depending upon the formal system in use.

== Background ==
=== Formal language ===
A &quot;formal language&quot; is a set of finite sequences of symbols. Such a language can be defined without reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it – that is, before it has any meaning. Formal proofs are expressed in some formal languages.

=== Formal grammar ===
A &quot;formal grammar&quot; (also called &quot;formation rules&quot;) is a precise description of the well-formed formulas of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of strings over the alphabet of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their semantics (i.e. what they mean).

=== Formal systems ===
A &quot;formal system&quot; (also called a &quot;logical calculus&quot;, or a &quot;logical system&quot;) consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a &quot;deductive system&quot;). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called &quot;inference rules&quot;) or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions.

=== Interpretations ===
An &quot;interpretation&quot; of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and truth values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called formal semantics. &quot;Giving an interpretation&quot; is synonymous with &quot;constructing a model.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Augustus Smith (18 November 1826 – 22 July 1887) was a British Army officer and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Born in Dublin on 18 November 1826, Smith was commissioned as an ensign into the 1st Regiment of Foot (Royal Scots) on 1 January 1849. He was promoted to lieutenant on 30 April 1852. He saw action during the Crimean War at Alma, Inkerman and Sebastopol and was promoted to captain on 30 March 1855. He later transferred to the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot.

==Victoria Cross==
Smith was 37 years old, and a captain in the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot (later the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry), during the Waikato-Hauhau Maori War in New Zealand.

The 68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) with a detachment of the 43rd commanded by Smith was deployed to attack an entrenchment held by the Māori. The following deed took place during the attack on 21 June 1864 at Tauranga for which he was awarded the VC.
In the charge he was struck by a bullet which lodged in the upper part of his leg. He continued to lead his men and was the first man into the entrenchment. Following fierce fighting, the Māori having sustained heavy casualties were driven from their position. In the attack Smith killed one of the Māori Chiefs and took possession of his baton known as a Mere. The Chief&#x27;s family subsequently offered substantial sums of money to retrieve the Mere. After Smith&#x27;s death the Mere was eventually returned to a museum in New Zealand; a relic of the British Army&#x27;s wars in that country.

He was also mentioned in dispatches.

==Later career==
He later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. He commanded the 43rd Foot from 1 December 1875 to 2 February 1878 when he retired from the army.

He died in Duleek, County Meath, 22 July 1887. His grave (unmarked) is in Duleek (Church of Ireland) Churchyard, County Meath. A memorial plaque to him, originally in Duleek Church, is now situated in Kilmore Church, standing in the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, Cultra, County Down.
It was Norman and Eileen Irvine and their son David (Irish Guards) from Carrickfergus, County Antrim who rescued the marble plaque from ruin in the Duleek church. The Ox and Bucks regiment wished to have it but it was decided to have it stay in Ireland.

<doc id="1197188" wikidata="Q317737" url="?curid=1197188" title="Abdullah Quilliam">
<text>William Henry Quilliam (10 April 1856 – 23 April 1932), who changed his name to Abdullah Quilliam and later Henri Marcel Leon or Haroun Mustapha Leon, was a 19th-century British convert from Christianity to Islam, noted for founding England&#x27;s first mosque and Islamic centre, and Britain&#x27;s oldest Muslim organization, the Association of British Muslims.

==Early life==
William Henry Quilliam was born at 22 Eliot Street, Liverpool, on 10 April 1856, to a wealthy local family. He spent most of his childhood on the Isle of Man and was brought up as a Methodist. He was educated at the Liverpool Institute and the Manx King William&#x27;s College.

He became a solicitor in 1878, specialising in criminal law, and practising at 28 Church Street, Liverpool. He defended suspects in many high-profile murder cases. In 1879, he married Hannah Johnstone. At this time, Quilliam was a Wesleyan Methodist and a proponent of the temperance movement.

==Conversion to Islam==
Quilliam converted to Islam in 1887 after visiting Morocco to recover from an illness. Quilliam purchased numbers 8, 11 and 12 Brougham Terrace, Liverpool, following his conversion, thanks to a donation from Nasrullah Khan, Crown Prince of the Emirate of Afghanistan. 8 Brougham Terrace became the Liverpool Muslim Institute, the first functioning mosque in Britain; it opened on Christmas Day, 1889. Quilliam also opened a boarding school for boys and a day school for girls, as well as an orphanage, Medina House, for non-Muslim parents who were unable to look after their children and agreed for them to be brought up as Muslims. In addition, the Institute hosted educational classes covering a wide range of subjects, and included a museum and science laboratory. 
In 1889, he first published &quot;The Faith of Islam&quot;, which was concerned with dawah to Islam and its key principles. Initially, 2,000 copies were published, but a further 3,000 copies were produced in 1890. Quilliam also published &quot;The Crescent&quot;, a weekly account of Muslims in Britain, and &quot;Islamic World&quot;, a monthly publication with a worldwide audience. 

In 1890, Quilliam orchestrated protests against the showing of Hall Caine&#x27;s play, &quot;Mahomet&quot;. The first public Muslim burial in Liverpool was of Michael Hall, a former Methodist preacher who had converted to Islam, in 1891.

A number of notables converted to Islam as a result of Quilliam&#x27;s preaching. They included professors Nasrullah Warren and Haschem Wilde, as well as Robert Stanley, JP and former mayor of Stalybridge. It is estimated that around 600 people converted to Islam in Britain as a direct result of Quilliam&#x27;s work.

He travelled extensively and received many honours from the leaders of the Islamic world. Abdul Hamid II, the 26th Ottoman Caliph, granted Quilliam the title of Shaykh al-Islām for the British Isles. The Emir of Afghanistan recognised him as the Sheikh of Muslims in Britain and he was appointed as Persian Vice Consul in Liverpool by the Shah. He had contact with English-speaking West African Muslims and toured the region&#x27;s coastal cities on his way to Lagos to attend the consecration of the Shitta Bey Mosque in 1894.

Quilliam&#x27;s work in Liverpool stopped when he left England in 1908 in advance of being struck off the Roll of Solicitors for unprofessional conduct as a solicitor. His son swiftly disposed of the property that had been used as a mosque and Islamic centre. Without Quilliam&#x27;s influence and funding, the Muslim community in Liverpool dispersed.

He returned to the UK before December 1914 under the name of H. M. Leon. He spent much of his time at Onchan on the Isle of Man. He died in Taviton Street, Bloomsbury, London in 1932, and was buried in an unmarked grave
at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking. The prominent Anglo-Muslims Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall (who each translated the Qur&#x27;an), and Lord Headley were later buried near him.

==Political views==
Quilliam argued that Muslims should not &quot;take up arms&quot; against other Muslims on the behalf of non-Muslims. During the war in Sudan, Quilliam published a pamphlet stating that any British Muslim that decided to aid in some manner the expedition was acting in &quot;contrary to the Shariat&quot;. His political views and allegiance to the Ottoman Caliph led some to denounce him as a traitor.

==Legacy==
His legacy is principally maintained by the Abdullah Quilliam Society, which was founded in 1996. The society aims to complete the restoration of the Liverpool Muslim Institute on Brougham Terrace. The society has been assisted by academics including Ron Geaves, formerly of Liverpool Hope University, and Mehmet Seker of Dokuz Eylül University. The society also offers university student accommodation.

Quilliam, originally The Quilliam Foundation, a think tank aimed at challenging extremist Islamist ideologies, launched in 2008, was named after him.

<doc id="1197201" wikidata="Q1227465" url="?curid=1197201" title="Direct digital synthesis">
<text>Direct digital synthesis (DDS) is a method employed by frequency synthesizers used for creating arbitrary waveforms from a single, fixed-frequency reference clock. DDS is used in applications such as signal generation, local oscillators in communication systems, function generators, mixers, modulators, sound synthesizers and as part of a digital phase-locked loop.

==Overview==
A basic Direct Digital Synthesizer consists of a frequency reference (often a crystal or SAW oscillator), a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) as shown in Figure 1.

The reference oscillator provides a stable time base for the system and determines the frequency accuracy of the DDS. It provides the clock to the &quot;NCO&quot;, which produces at its output a discrete-time, quantized version of the desired output waveform (often a sinusoid) whose period is controlled by the digital word contained in the &quot;Frequency Control Register&quot;. The sampled, digital waveform is converted to an analog waveform by the &quot;DAC&quot;. The output reconstruction filter rejects the spectral replicas produced by the zero-order hold inherent in the analog conversion process.

== Performance ==
A DDS has many advantages over its analog counterpart, the phase-locked loop (PLL), including much better frequency agility, improved phase noise, and precise control of the output phase across frequency switching transitions. Disadvantages include spurious responses mainly due to truncation effects in the NCO, crossing spurs resulting from high order (&gt;1) Nyquist images, and a higher noise floor at large frequency offsets due mainly to the digital-to-analog converter.

Because a DDS is a sampled system, in addition to the desired waveform at output frequency Fout, Nyquist images are also generated (the primary image is at Fclk-Fout, where Fclk is the reference clock frequency). In order to reject these undesired images, a DDS is generally used in conjunction with an analog reconstruction lowpass filter as shown in Figure 1.

=== Frequency agility ===
The output frequency of a DDS is determined by the value stored in the frequency control register (FCR) (see Fig.1), which in turn controls the NCO&#x27;s phase accumulator step size. Because the NCO operates in the discrete-time domain, it changes frequency instantaneously at the clock edge coincident with a change in the value stored in the FCR. The DDS output frequency settling time is determined mainly by the phase response of the reconstruction filter. An ideal reconstruction filter with a linear phase response (meaning the output is simply a delayed version of the input signal) would allow instantaneous frequency response at its output because a linear system can not create frequencies not present at its input.

=== Phase noise and jitter ===

The superior close-in phase noise performance of a DDS stems from the fact that it is a feed-forward system. In a traditional phase locked loop (PLL), the frequency divider in the feedback path acts to multiply the phase noise of the reference oscillator and, within the PLL loop bandwidth, impresses this excess noise onto the VCO output. A DDS, on the other hand, reduces the reference clock phase noise by the ratio formula_1 because the fractional division of the clock derives its output. Reference clock jitter translates directly to the output, but this jitter is a smaller percentage of the output period (by the ratio above). Since the maximum output frequency is limited to formula_2, the output phase noise at close-in offsets is always at least 6 dB below the reference clock phase noise.

At offsets far removed from the carrier, the phase-noise floor of a DDS is determined by the power sum of the DAC quantization noise floor and the reference clock phase noise floor.

<text>Henry Bradley Plant (October 27, 1819 – June 23, 1899), was a businessman, entrepreneur, and investor involved with many transportation interests and projects, mostly railroads, in the southeastern United States. He was founder of the Plant System of railroads and steamboats.

Born in 1819 in Branford, Connecticut, Plant entered the railroad service in 1844, serving as express messenger on the Hartford and New Haven Railroad until 1853, during which time he had entire charge of the express business of that road. He went south in 1853 and established express lines on various southern railways, and in 1861 organized the Southern Express Co., and became its president. In 1879 he purchased, with others, the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad of Georgia, and later reorganized the Savannah, Florida and Western Railroad, of which he became president. He purchased and rebuilt, in 1880, the Savannah and Charleston Railroad, now Charleston and Savannah. Not long after this he organized the Plant Investment Co., to control these railroads and advance their interests generally, and later established a steamboat line on the St. John&#x27;s river, in Florida. From 1853 until 1860 he was general superintendent of the southern division of the Adams Express Co., and in 1867 became president of the Texas Express Co. In the 1880s, most of his accumulated railroad and steamship lines were combined into the Plant System, which later became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.

Plant is particularly known for connecting the previously isolated Tampa Bay area and southwest Florida to the nation&#x27;s railroad system and establishing regular steamship service between Tampa, Cuba, and Key West, helping to spark significant population and economic growth in the region. To promote passenger traffic, Plant built the large Tampa Bay Hotel resort along his rail line through Tampa and several smaller hotels further south, starting the area&#x27;s tourist industry. His semi-friendly rival, Henry Flagler, similarly sparked growth along Florida&#x27;s opposite coast by building the Florida East Coast Railroad along with several resorts along its route.

==Early life==
Henry Bradley Plant was born in Branford, Connecticut, to Betsey ( Bradley) and Anderson Plant, a farmer in good circumstances. He was the descendant of John Plant who probably emigrated from England and settled at Hartford, Connecticut, about 1639. When the boy was six, his father and younger sister died of typhus. Several years later his mother married again and took him to live first at Martinsburg, New York, and later at New Haven, Connecticut, where he attended a private school. His grandmother, Betsy Plant, who hoped to make a clergyman of him, offered him an education at Yale College, but, impatient to begin an active career, he got a job as captain&#x27;s boy, deck hand, and man-of-all-work on a steamboat, The New York, plying between New Haven and New York City.

==Pre Civil War==
Among his various duties was the care of express parcels. This line of business, hitherto neglected, he organized effectively. After marrying Ellen Blackstone in 1843, Plant decided to stay ashore and took a position with Beecher and Company, an express company located in New Haven which was taken over by the Adams Express Company. Plant was transferred from steamboats to railroads. After a few years he was put in charge of the old York office of the company. In 1853 his wife, Ellen Elizabeth (Blackstone) Plant was ordered South for her health. After a journey of eight days, the Plants arrived in Jacksonville in March and spent several months at a private home near Jacksonville, Florida, then a tiny hamlet. Plant was impressed with the possibilities of the future development of Florida.

The next year, after it became necessary for his wife to again travel south for her health, he requested and obtained the responsibility for all Adams Express Company&#x27;s interests in the territory south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers. In the face of great difficulties, he successfully organized and extended express service across this region, where transportation facilities, although rapidly growing, were still deficient and uncoordinated. At the approach of the Civil War the directors of Adams Express, fearing the confiscation of their Southern properties, decided to sell them to Plant for his promissory note of $500,000. With Southern stockholders of the company he organized in 1861 the Southern Express Company, a Georgia corporation, and named himself president. Because he had built a reputation for providing reliable and efficient express service, the cabinet of Confederate president Jefferson Davis made Plant&#x27;s company the agent for the Confederacy in collecting tariffs and transferring funds. In 1863, claiming a serious illness, he left his home in Augusta with a safe passage document signed by Jefferson Davis and sailed to Bermuda. After spending a month there, he traveled to Canada, Connecticut, and then England. When in France, he was informed that his Confederate passport was not valid. After some discussion with French authorities, an unusual resolution was reached as he was issued a French passport declaring him a U.S. citizen residing in Georgia which allowed him to travel extensively across Europe and later re-enter the United States when he returned to New York by way of Canada.

==Post Civil War==
After the war, Plant returned to the South in February, 1865 to reclaim his business interests, primarily the Southern Express. The railroads of the South had been practically ruined and many railroads went bankrupt in the depression of 1873. In this situation, he found his opportunity. Convinced of the eventual economic revival of the South, he bought at foreclosure sales in 1879 and 1880 the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad and the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. With these as a nucleus he began building along the southern Atlantic seaboard a transportation system that twenty years later included fourteen railway companies with 2,100 miles of track, several steamship lines, and a number of important hotels. In 1882 he organized, with the assistance of Northern capitalists (among whom were M. K. Jesup, W. T. Walters, and Henry Morrison Flagler, who himself would be instrumental in the development of Florida&#x27;s east coast) the Plant Investment Company, a holding company for the joint management of the various properties under his control. He reconstructed and extended several small railroads so as to provide continuous service across the state, and by providing better connections with through lines to the North he gave Florida orange growers quicker and cheaper access to Northern markets.

In 1887, Plant built the PICO Hotel in Sanford for the accommodation of his railroad and steamship passengers to Central Florida. Subsequently, he either built or purchased the Inn at Port Tampa (1888), Hotel Kissimmee (1890), Seminole Hotel (1891), Hotel Punta Gorda (1894), The Ocala House (1895), and the Fort Myers Hotel (1898).

Tampa, then a village of a few hundred inhabitants, was made the terminus of his southern Florida railroad and also the home port for a new line of steamships to Havana. For the accommodation of winter visitors he built in Tampa, in the style of a Moorish palace, an enormous hotel costing over $3,000,000 and covering 6 acres situated on 150 acres. Opened on February 5, 1891, it was the first hotel in Florida to have an elevator, electric lights, and a telephone in each room. The hotel was called the Tampa Bay Hotel and was famous for its fanciful Moorish and Victorian architecture. In 1898, this hotel gained international fame as the stateside military headquarters for the U.S. invasion force during the Spanish–American War. The hotel now serves as the main building for the University of Tampa and houses the Henry B. Plant Museum. Another large, Victorian-style hotel established by Plant was opened in 1897, the Belleview Biltmore near Clearwater, Florida.

The subsequent growth in wealth and population of Florida and other states tributary to the Plant System made its founder one of the richest and most powerful men in the South. A good physical inheritance, preserved by temperate habits, made it possible for Henry Plant to keep working until almost eighty years of age.

==Later life==
His first wife died in February 1861, and in 1873 he married Margaret Josephine Loughman, the daughter of Martin Loughman of New York City, who with one of his two sons survived him. He was honored at the Cotton States and International Exhibition in 1895 in Atlanta, GA with his own, Henry Plant Day.

Henry Plant built or bought eight hotels, including several in Tampa, Florida and the new town of Port Tampa, which he built at the end of his rail line. His most prized hotel was the Tampa Bay Hotel, a lavish resort built right across the Hillsborough River from Tampa. Built at a cost of $3 million, it was said to be an attempt to compete with fellow industrialist Henry M. Flagler, who was developing Florida&#x27;s east coast.

Plant died from heart disease in New York City on June 23, 1899.

In his will he attempted to prevent the partition of his properties to the value of about $10,000,000 by forming a trust for the benefit of his grandson, Henry Plant II (born 1895), but the will was contested by his widow and son and declared invalid under the laws of the state of New York. This decision made possible the consolidation of his railroads with other properties to form the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, today a key portion of the Florida operations of CSX Transportation.

Plant&#x27;s son, Morton Freeman Plant (1852–1918), was vice-president of the Plant Investment Company from 1884 to 1902 and attained distinction as a yachtsman. He was part owner of the Philadelphia baseball club in the National League, and sole owner of the New London club in the Eastern League. Of the younger Plant&#x27;s many gifts to hospitals and other institutions the most notable were the three dormitories and the unrestricted gift of $1,000,000 to the Connecticut College for Women. His former 1905 mansion on Fifth Avenue in New York City is now the home of Cartier.

<text>Jason John Cook (born September 13, 1980) is an American actor, screenwriter, film director and film producer best known for the soap opera television roles of Shawn-Douglas Brady on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (1999–2006, 2015), and Matt Hunter on &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 2008 to 2012. He is the writer, director, and producer of the feature film &quot;The Creatress&quot;, and most recently &quot;Four For Fun&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Cook was born in Camden, New Jersey to Bill Cook (a licensed civil engineer in California) and JoAnn (a pre-school teacher). Growing up in Somerdale, he has two sisters, Michelle and Janean, and a brother, Michael. When he was very young, his family moved to California. At an early age, Jason began studying the piano. As his musical skills improved, he got occasional jobs performing at weddings. He did not consider acting until high school, when he served as an emergency replacement in &quot;Whodunnit&quot;. A friend of Jason&#x27;s mother, whose husband was an agent and manager for child actors, helped Jason get his first auditions and roles. Jason attended Westlake High School in Westlake Village, California and graduated in 1998.

Jason attended Moorpark College, a two-year junior college, in Moorpark, California and completed his freshman year in the spring semester of 1999. While attending Moorpark College he was active on the speech and debate teams, competing nationally.

==Career==
Cook portrayed Shawn-Douglas Brady on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from October 1999 and was very popular with fans, especially in Shawn&#x27;s relationship with Belle Black. Cook elected to leave the show when his contract with &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; expired in September 2006. On May 28, 2015, it was announced that he would reprise the role for the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary in the fall of 2015.

While on the show, Cook turned his attention to writing and directing films, making the indie film &quot;The Making of Triassic Park&quot; and later &quot;Social Security Guard&quot;, starring &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star John Ingle. He left the show to pursue production full-time on &quot;Numb To Life&quot;, a documentary exploring pharmaceutical drug abuse, as his first feature documentary.

On April 23, 2008, it was announced that Cook would be returning to Daytime TV on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as new character Matt Hunter. His first appearance was on June 26, 2008.

Cook elected to leave &quot;General Hospital&quot; at the end of his contract to once again return to projects behind the camera. His first project was a philanthropic reality show co-produced with the Mandela family titled LifeCHANGE. This was followed up with the production of &quot;State of Bacon&quot;, a mockumentary surrounding the largest Bacon festival in the world, held yearly in Des Moines, Iowa.

In 2012, he participated in Fox&#x27;s dating game show &quot;The Choice&quot; and portrayed 2014 James Thomas in Dean Jones&#x27; mystery thriller film &quot;Dark Awakening&quot;. opposite Lance Henriksen and Valerie Azlynn.

In 2018, he wrote, produced, and directed The Creatress, a film about a writer following up a bestselling debut novel starring Lindy Booth, Peter Bogdanovich, and Fran Drescher.

<text>Body piercing jewelry is jewelry manufactured specifically for use in body piercing. The jewelry involved in the art of body piercing comes in a wide variety of shapes and sizes in order to best fit the pierced site. Jewelry may be worn for fashion, cultural tradition, religious beliefs, personal symbolism, and many other reasons.

== History ==
Originally, hardly any other jewelry than circular earrings were used in modern Western body piercing. As the body piercing became more of a fashion, a vast amount of specially crafted jewelry became available to the public. Common types of body jewelry that are sold often in modern days include barbells, captive bead rings, labrets, navel curves, plugs, spirals, and various other types of piercing jewelry. Materials used for production have grown from traditional gold and silver to widespread use of surgical steel as well as titanium, niobium, glass, and several kinds of plastics (PTFE, Tygon, bioplast, nylon). Wood, horn, amber, stone, bamboo, silicone, fossilized ivories, tusks, bones, and porcelain can also be used to craft body piercing jewelry.

<text>German Casas (born May 27, 1939) is a Chilean singer.

==Brief bio==
German Casas became famous during the 1960s and 1970s. Many of his songs hit Chilean airwaves and television, making him a household name all over his native country. He was one of Chile&#x27;s best known rock and roll and twist musicians of the era. In 1967 Casas was named as one of the top five Chilean singers at the national popular music awards.

Some of his most famous songs are &quot;Camina Derechito&quot; (&quot;Walk Straight&quot;), &quot;Rock del Mundial&quot; (&quot;Rock the World Cup&quot;), and &quot;Twist del Estudiante&quot; (&quot;Student&#x27;s Twist&quot;).

<doc id="1197223" wikidata="Q3182325" url="?curid=1197223" title="John Quilliam">
<text>Captain John Quilliam (29 September 1771 – 10 October 1829) was a Royal Navy officer who served as first lieutenant on HMS &quot;Victory&quot; at the Battle of Trafalgar. He was a farmer&#x27;s son who was impressed into the Royal Navy in 1791.

==Biography==
===Early life===
The eldest son of John Quilliam and Christian Clucas of Ballakelly, John Quilliam was born in Marown, Isle of Man, in 1771. It is said he did not care for farming and consequently he was apprenticed to a stonemason. His early nautical career is unknown. However, he was impressed into the Royal Navy from a collier in Castletown harbour.

===Career===
Unlike most impressed sailors, Quilliam rose rapidly in the Royal Navy. By 1797 he had risen to the rank of midshipman and is recorded at the Battle of Camperdown following which he was again promoted, this time to the rank of lieutenant, on the recommendation of Admiral Duncan subsequently serving as third lieutenant on the frigate , under the command of Captain James Young.

On 7 October 1799 &quot;Ethalion&quot; captured the 36-gun Spanish treasure ship &quot;Thetis&quot;. For his part in the capture, Quilliam received over £5000.

====Battle of Copenhagen====
At the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, Quilliam was first lieutenant aboard the frigate . The slight draft of the &quot;Amazon&quot; meant she was able to get close under the shore batteries; however this in turn led to the &quot;Amazon&quot; receiving a high volume of damage, the result of which was that all the higher-ranking officers were killed, leaving Quilliam in command. Quilliam&#x27;s gallantry and calmness under fire following the death of Captain Edward Riou and all the senior officers of the &quot;Amazon,&quot; quickly came to the attention of Lord Nelson. In 1803, when HMS &quot;Victory&quot; was commissioned as his flagship, Nelson appointed Quilliam first lieutenant. Subsequently, Quilliam became an accomplished officer.

====Battle of Trafalgar====
Quilliam was the senior lieutenant on the &quot;Victory&quot; being responsible for safety, part of this remit seeing him develop an emergency system in order to steer the ship. He assisted in steering &quot;Victory&quot; into action at Trafalgar, his system coming into effect early in the battle, when having sustained damage to her steering gear &quot;Victory&quot; required all Quilliam&#x27;s experience in order for her to continue to remain seaworthy.

A contemporary report stated:
 

====Post Trafalgar====
Following Trafalgar Quilliam was promoted to captain and placed in command of HMS &quot;Ildefonso&quot;, a Spanish &quot;74&quot; having to refit her at Gibraltar and not arriving in England until 16 May 1806. In 1808, he was captain of Admiral Stopford&#x27;s flagship HMS &quot;Spencer&quot;, subsequently taking command of the frigates HMS &quot;Alexandria,&quot; HMS &quot;Inconstant&quot; and HMS &quot;Crescent&quot;, seeing action on the Newfoundland Station where he served as such until the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 when he retired from the navy.

On 18 September 1813, off Cape Row as captain of the &quot;Crescent&quot;, Quilliam captured the 14-gun American privateer schooner the &quot;Elbridge Gerry&quot; together with her crew of 66 men.

===Personal life===
====Politics====
Although still an active naval officer, in 1807 Capt. Quilliam was invited to become a Member of the House of Keys. At that time the body was self-elected, the members being chosen by the lieutenant governor on the recommendation of the house. He resigned his seat in 1810 in order to return to sea, however on his return to the Island he was again invited to continue as a Member of the House of Keys in 1817.

===Retirement===
On the conclusion of his career in the navy, Captain Quilliam returned to the Isle of Man, investing his considerable wealth in numerous properties. On 21 December 1807, Quilliam married Margaret Stevenson at Castletown, his wife being part of a renowned Manx family from Balladoole. The couple made their family home at Ballakeighan before they acquired a property on the Parade, Castletown, living in the house known as the &quot;Balcony House.&quot; The marriage produced no children.

Quilliam&#x27;s main hobby was fishing, and he occupied himself with a small fishing boat which he designed and fitted out himself.

In 1826 Capt. Quilliam was instrumental along with Sir William Hillary in the formation on the Isle of Man of a District Association of the Royal National Institution of the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck. He also served as Chairman of the Committee for Shipwrecked Seamen. In addition he was one of a group of gentlemen who put forward the scheme for the erection of the Derbyhaven Breakwater.

===Death===
Capt. Qulliam died on 10 October 1829. He was buried in the Stevenson family vault in the graveyard at Kirk Arbory.

==Memorial==
There is the following inscription on his tombstone;


==HMS &quot;Quilliam&quot;==
HMS &quot;Quilliam&quot; was a Q-class destroyer serving in the Royal Navy from 1942 to 1945. She was then transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy, where she was commissioned as Hr.Ms. &quot;Banckert&quot; (D801) until 1957. During her wartime service &quot;Quilliam&quot; was involved in operations in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. While taking part in Operation Iceberg (the Invasion of Okinawa), &quot;Quilliam&quot; was involved in a collision with the British aircraft carrier .

==Commemoration==

* A sculpture of Quilliam by Manx artist Bryan Kneale was unveiled on Trafalgar Day 2005 at Castle Rushen. The sculpture won the 2007 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture.
* The uniform of Captain Quilliam is on public display at the Manx Museum, Douglas, Isle of Man.
* To mark the 150th anniversary of his death in 1979, a series of postage stamps by the Isle of Man Post Office dedicated to Capt. Quilliam were released. The four stamps in the series depicted Quilliam being impressed into the Royal Navy, his role at the Battle of Trafalgar, his time in command of HMS &quot;Spencer&quot; and his subsequent career as a Member of the House of Keys.

<doc id="1197228" wikidata="Q4543500" url="?curid=1197228" title="Croughton, Northamptonshire">
<text>Croughton is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England, about southwest of Brackley. The 2011 census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 992.

The village is on the B4031 road, about above sea level, on the south side of an east–west ridge. The parish is wide east–west and wide north–south. Its southern boundary is Ockley Brook, which also forms part of the county boundary with Oxfordshire. Ockley Brook is a tributary of the River Cherwell. Croughton is Northamptonshire&#x27;s second-most southerly village, second only to neighbouring Aynho.

==Place-name==
No single pronunciation of the place name predominates. Residents pronounce its first syllable to rhyme with &quot;bough&quot; or &quot;though&quot; (i.e., or ).

The Domesday Book of 1086 records the name as &quot;Creveltone&quot; and &quot;Criweltone&quot;. 12th-century versions include &quot;Crouelton&quot;, followed by &quot;Craulton&quot; and &quot;Crewelton&quot; in a pipe roll of 1198, and &quot;Croulton&quot; in an Assize Roll of 1202. It is derived from Old English. &quot;Crawil&quot; or &quot;krawil&quot; may mean &quot;fork&quot;. Two streams flow either side of the village, converging just southwest of it and then joining Ockley Brook. Hence, &quot;Croughton&quot; may mean &quot;town in the fork of a river&quot;.

==Archaeology==
About north of the village is the site of a Roman settlement. It is a scheduled monument.

==Parish church==
The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of All Saints are 12th-century Norman. They include the arch of the west tower and the three-bay north arcade. The south arcade, also of three bays, is 13th-century Early English Gothic.

In the 14th century, new windows were inserted, the clerestory was rebuilt, and north and south porches were added. The font was Romanesque but was re-cut in the 14th or 15th century. In the 14th century, a series of murals were painted inside the church, including numerous scenes from the life of Jesus and a Doom painting. The wall paintings were painted over during the Reformation in the 16th century but were rediscovered in 1921 and restored in 1960. The pulpit is 17th-century. All Saints is a Grade I-listed building.

The west tower of All Saints has a ring of five bells. All were cast and hung by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough in 1923.

In All Saints&#x27; churchyard, southeast of the chancel, are the base and broken shaft of a medieval stone cross. An historic elm reputedly stood in the churchyard for 800 years. It is believed to have died of Dutch elm disease in the 1970s, but its demise was in the early 1900s.

==RAF Croughton==

RAF Croughton is partly in the parish, about southeast of the village. It was a Royal Air Force training base and emergency landing field from 1939 until 1950, when it was transferred to the United States Air Force for use as a communications centre.

==Amenities==

Croughton All Saints Primary School is on the High Street of the village.

The village has a pub, the Blackbird.

==Notable people==
* Robert Freind (1667–1751), sometime headmaster of Westminster School
* Charles Masson (1800–1853), explorer and archaeologist

<doc id="1197230" wikidata="Q2597033" url="?curid=1197230" title="Two penny blue">
<text>The Two Penny Blue or The Two Pence Blue was the world&#x27;s second official postage stamp, produced in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and issued after the Penny Black.

Initial printing took place from 1 May 1840, and in all 6,460,000 were printed from two plates until 29 August. Officially the stamps were valid for postage from 6 May. It was first sold to the public at the London Inland revenue office on 6 May 1840. Except for its denomination, the design is exactly the same as the penny black and was struck from the same die.

It was originally intended that the 2d blue be issued at the same time as the 1d black; the earliest postmark seen on one of these is 6 May 1840. The first issues of this value (intended for double rate letters), were printed from plates 1 and 2. The printing plates were destroyed in 1843. Copies of the stamp are now significantly rarer and more expensive than the Penny Black.

Later when the colours of the stamps were being revised, the inks chosen were red-brown for the penny value and a new blue ink for the two pence value. As the printed stamps in the new ink looked the same as the original issue, it was decided to add a horizontal line at the top and bottom of the label so as the newer printings could be easily identified. Printing of the revised stamps began on 27 February 1841 and were placed on sale in March. These are referred to as the &quot;white lines added issue&quot;, as pictured right. They are more common than the original 1840 printing.

Several differences exist in the post-1841 stamps due to watermark, perforation, paper and type variations. In all the 1840-80 series of this design used 15 plates.

The Penny Black allowed a letter weighing up to half an ounce to be sent anywhere within Britain or Ireland; the Two Penny Blue&#x27;s weight limit was a full ounce.

<doc id="1197234" wikidata="Q1015386" url="?curid=1197234" title="Dakhla Oasis">
<text>Dakhla Oasis or Dakhleh Oasis (Egyptian Arabic: , , &quot;the inner oases&quot;), is one of the seven oases of Egypt&#x27;s Western Desert. Dakhla Oasis lies in the New Valley Governorate, 350 km (220 mi.) from the Nile and between the oases of Farafra and Kharga. It measures approximately 80 km (50 mi) from east to west and 25 km (16 mi) from north to south.

== Etymology ==
The Arabic (singular) word واحة means a green spot in the desert or in a barren land .

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
The first contacts between the pharaonic power and the oases started around 2550 .
The human history of this oasis started during the Pleistocene, when nomadic tribes settled sometimes there, in a time when the Sahara climate was wetter and where humans could have access to lakes and marshes. But about 6,000 years ago, the entire Sahara became drier, changing progressively into a hyper-arid desert (with less than 50 mm of rain per year). However, specialists think that nomadic hunter-gatherers began to settle almost permanently in the oasis of Dakhleh in the period of the Holocene (about 12,000 years ago), during new, but rare episodes of wetter times.

In fact, the drier climate didn&#x27;t mean that there was more water than today in what is now known as the Western Desert. The south of the Libyan Desert has the most important supply of subterranean water in the world through the Nubian Aquifer, and the first inhabitants of the Dakhla Oasis had access to surface water sources. In the third millennium BC the probably nomadic people of the Sheikh Muftah culture lived here.

=== Pharaonic period ===
During the late 6th Dynasty, hieratic script was sometimes incised into clay tablets with a stylus, similar to cuneiform. About five hundred such tablets have been discovered in the governor&#x27;s palace at Ayn Asil (Balat) in the Dakhla Oasis. At the time the tablets were made, Dakhla was located far from centers of papyrus production. These tablets record inventories, name-lists, accounts, and approximately fifty letters.

===Deir el-Hagar===
Deir el-Hagar (Egyptian Arabic: &#x27;Monastery of Stone&#x27;, , &quot;Sioua&quot;) is a Roman sandstone temple on the western edge of Dakhla Oasis, about 10 km from Qasr ad-Dakhla. The Temple was erected during the reign of the Roman Emperor Nero, and decorated during the time of Vespasian, Titus and Domitian. The temple was dedicated to the Theban triad, composed of Amun-Ra, Mut and Khonsu, as well as to Seth, the main deity of the region.

===Qasr ad-Dakhla===
The fortified Islamic town of Qasr ad-Dakhla or el-Qasr (Arabic: قصر الداخلة, &quot;the Fortress&quot;) was built in the 12th century on the remains of a Roman fort in the NW of the Dakhla Oasis by the Ayyubid kings. Many of the up to four-storey mud brick Ottoman and Mamluk buildings contain blocks of stone with hieroglyphics from the ancient Thoth temple of the nearby site of Amheida. The three-storey, 21-meter-high minaret is dated 924 CE.

=== After 1800 ===
Sir Archibald Edmonstone visited Dakhla oasis in the year 1819. He was succeeded by several other early travellers, among whom Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs in 1873–1874. It was not until 1908 that the first Egyptologist, Herbert Winlock, visited Dakhla Oasis and noted its monuments in some systematic manner. In the 1950s, detailed studies began, first by Ahmed Fakhry, and in the late 1970s, expeditions of the Institut Français d&#x27;Archéologie Orientale and the Dakhleh Oasis Project (see below) each began detailed studies in the oasis.

=== Recent discoveries ===
In August 2017, archaeologists from the Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of five mud-brick tombs at Bir esh-Shaghala, dating back nearly 2000 years. Researchers also revealed worn masks gilded with gold, several large jars and a piece of pottery with unsolved ancient Egyptian writing on it.

Some of the tombs are completely large containing several burial chambers, while one tomb has a roof built in the shape of a pyramid and some of them with vaulted roofs.

== Geography ==
Dakhla Oasis consists of several communities, along a string of sub-oases. The main settlements are Mut (more fully Mut el-Kharab and anciently called Mothis), El-Masara, Al-Qasr, together with several smaller villages.

==Climate==
Dakhla Oasis has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), typical of much of Egypt.
==Dakhleh Oasis Project==
The Dakhleh Oasis Project (DOP) is a long-term study project of the Dakhleh Oasis and the surrounding palaeo-oasis, initiated in 1978 when the Royal Ontario Museum and the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities were awarded a joint concession for part of the Oasis. In 1979, the Centre for Archaeology and Ancient History at Monash University began to cooperate in the project.

The DOP studies the interaction between environmental changes and human activity in the Dakhleh Oasis. The excavations at Ismant el-Kharab (ancient Kellis), Mut el-Kharab (ancient Mothis), Deir Abu Metta and Muzawwaqa were undertaken with the cooperation of Monash University. The DOP has also excavated at &#x27;Ain el-Gazzareen, El Qasr el-Dakhil, Deir el Hagar and Ain Birbiyeh.

In 1985, the Petroglyph Unit of the Dakhleh Oasis Project was created by Lech Krzyżaniak, then director of the Archaeological Museum in Poznań, under the auspices of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw. At first, the studies of the petroglyphs focused on the eastern part of the oasis, where rock carvings had been documented by archaeologists already before World War II (Herbert Winlock and Hans Alexander Winkler). The expedition created systematic documentation of both the depictions mentioned earlier in the literature and the newly discovered ones. Aerial photographs proved helpful in this work. Then, under the direction of Michał Kobusiewicz from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, attention was turned to the area of the Central Oasis where 270 new petroglyph sites were recorded. The current director of The Petroglyph Unit, Paweł Polkowski from the Archaeological Museum in Poznań, extended the area of prospection and created a map showing the distribution of more than 1,300 panels with rock art. The depictions date from the Prehistory to the Islamic period and include images of animals and people (often pregnant women), hieroglyphs, and Beduin markings.

In addition to the Dakhleh Oasis Project, long-term excavations have been conducted in Balat (IFAO), Amheida (New York University) and Bir el-Shaghala (Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities).

==Dakhleh Trust==
The Dakhleh Trust was formed in 1999 and is a registered charity in Britain.

<doc id="1197238" wikidata="Q2541667" url="?curid=1197238" title="Zazou">
<text>The zazous were a subculture in France during World War II. They were young people expressing their individuality by wearing big or garish clothing (similar to the zoot suit fashion in America a few years before) and dancing wildly to swing jazz. Men wore large striped lumber jackets, while women wore short skirts, striped stockings and heavy shoes, and often carried umbrellas.

==Origins of the movement==
During the German occupation of France, the Vichy regime, which collaborated with the Nazi occupiers, had an ultra-conservative morality and started to use a whole range of laws against a youth that was restless and disenchanted. These young people expressed their resistance and nonconformity through aggressive dance competitions, sometimes against soldiers from the occupying forces.

The Zazous were to be found throughout France, but were most concentrated in Paris. The two most important meeting places of the Zazous were the terrace of the Pam Pam cafe on the Champs-Élysées and the Boul’Mich (the Boulevard Saint-Michel near the Sorbonne).

The Zazous of the Champs Elysées came from a more middle-class background and were older than the Zazous of the Latin Quarter. The Champs Elysées Zazous were easily recognisable on the terrace of the Pam Pam and took afternoon bike rides in the Bois de Boulogne. In the Latin Quarter, the Zazous met in the cellar clubs of Dupont-Latin or the Capoulade.

==Characteristics==
The male Zazous wore extra large jackets, which hung down to their knees and which were fitted out with many pockets and often several half-belts. The amount of material used was a direct comment on government decrees on the rationing of clothing material. Their trousers were narrow, gathered at the waist, and so were their ties, which were cotton or heavy wool. The shirt collars were high and kept in place by a horizontal pin. They liked thick-soled suede shoes, with white or brightly coloured socks. Their hairstyles were greased and long. Many &quot;Zazous&quot; liked to dress in the &quot;style anglais&quot; with umbrellas (seen as a symbol of Britishness in France) a popular fashion accessory and their hair done up &quot;à la mode d&#x27;Oxford&quot; (as Simone de Beauvoir called it), had a fondness for speaking to each other in English as it was more &quot;cool&quot; and loved British and American popular music. The British historian of France W.D. Hall described the &quot;Zazou&quot; look as follows: &quot;the young men wore dirty drape suits with &quot;drainpipe&quot; trousers under their sheepskin-lined jackets and brillianted liberally their long hair, the girls favored tight roll-collar sweaters with short flared skirts and wooden platform shoes, sported dark glasses with big lenses, put on heavy make-up and went bare-headed to show their dyed hair, set off by a lock of a different hue&quot;.

Female Zazous wore their hair in curls falling down to their shoulders, or in braids. Blonde was the favourite colour, and they wore bright red lipstick, as well as sunglasses, also favoured by some male Zazous. They wore jackets with extremely wide shoulders and short, pleated skirts. Their stockings were striped or sometimes net, and they wore shoes with thick wooden soles.

In his autobiography, Christian Dior wrote of the style:
Hats were far too large, skirts far too short, jackets far too long, shoes far too heavy... I have no doubt that this &quot;zazou&quot; style originated in a desire to defy the forces of occupation and the austerity of Vichy. For lack of other materials, feathers and veils, promoted to the dignity of flags, floated through Paris like revolutionary banners. But as a fashion I found it repellent.

The Zazous were fans of checkered patterns, on jacket, skirt or umbrellas. They began to appear in the vegetarian restaurants and developed a passion for grated carrot salad. They usually drank fruit juice or beer with grenadine syrup.

The Zazous were numbered in the hundreds rather than thousands and were generally between 17 and 20. There were Zazous from all classes, races, and both sexes but with apparently similar outlooks. Working class Zazous used theft of cloth and black market activities to get their outfits, sometimes stitching their own clothes. Some of the more bohemian Zazous in the Latin Quarter varied the outfit, with sheepskin jackets and multicoloured scarves. It was their ironic and sarcastic comments on the Nazi/Vichy rulers, their dandyism and hedonism, their suspicion of the work ethic and their love of &quot;decadent&quot; jazz that distinguished them as one of the prototype youth movements questioning society.

While they did not suffer like their contemporaries in Germany, the Hamburg and Berlin based &quot;Swingjugend&quot; (many of whom were imprisoned in concentration camps) and the working class, mostly Cologne based Edelweiss Pirates (some of whom were hanged by the Nazis), the Zazou subculture represented an important dissident minority in a society of widespread complicity and acquiescence.

==&quot;Syncopated&quot;==
One fascist magazine commented on the male Zazou: &quot;Here is the specimen of Ultra Swing 1941: hair hanging down to the neck, teased up into an untidy quiff, little moustache à la Clark Gable... shoes with too-thick soles, syncopated walk.&quot;

The Zazous were directly inspired by jazz and swing music. A black jazz scene had sprung up in Montmartre in the inter-war years. Black Americans felt freer in Paris than they did back home, and the home-grown jazz scene was greatly reinforced by this immigration. Manouche Gypsy musicians like Django Reinhardt started playing swinging jazz music in the Paris clubs.

The Zazous probably got their name from a line in a song – &quot;Zah Zuh Zah&quot; by the jazz musician Cab Calloway, known for his recording of &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;. Johnny Hess, a French crooner popular with the Zazous, released &quot;Je suis swing&quot; in early 1942, in which he sang the lines &quot;Za zou, za zou, za zou, za zou ze&quot;, selling more units than any previously released record in France. An associate of the Zazous, the anarchist singer/songwriter, jazz trumpeter, poet and novelist Boris Vian was also extremely fond of z words in his work. The long drape jacket was also copied from zoot suits worn by the likes of Calloway.

&quot;The Zazous were very obviously detested by the Nazis, who on the other side of the Rhine, had [for] a long time decimated the German cultural avant garde, forbidden jazz and all visible signs of...degenerations of Germanic culture…&quot; (Pierre Seel, who, as a young Zazou, was deported to a German concentration camp because of his homosexuality.)
When the yellow star was forced on Jews, non-Jews who objected began to wear yellow stars with &quot;Zazu&quot;, &quot;Goy&quot; (Gentile) or &quot;Swing&quot;.

==Antagonism during the War==
Vichy had started &quot;Youth Worksites&quot; in July 1940, in what Zazous perceived as an attempt to indoctrinate French youth. As in 1870–1871, France reacted to her shattering defeat by reforming existing institutions and creating new ones. The Vichy regime was very concerned about the education, moral fibre and productivity of French youth. In 1940, a Ministry of Youth was established. They saw the Zazous as a rival and dangerous influence on youth.

In 1940, 78 anti-Zazou articles were published in the press, a further nine in 1941 and 38 in 1943. The Vichy papers deplored the moral turpitude and decadence that was affecting French morality. Zazous were seen as work-shy, egotistical and Judeo-Gaullist shirkers.

By 1942, the Vichy regime realised that the national revival that they hoped would be carried out by young people under their guidance was seriously affected by widespread rejection of the patriotism, work ethic, self-denial, asceticism and masculinity this called for.

Soon, round-ups began in bars and Zazous were beaten on the street. They became Enemy Number One of the fascist youth organisation Jeunesse Populaire Française (JPF). &quot;Scalp the Zazous!&quot; became their slogan, with squads of young JPF fascists armed with hairclippers attacking Zazous. Many were arrested and sent to the countryside to work on the harvest.

At this point the Zazous went underground, holing up in their dance halls and basement clubs. The Zazous were suspected by the official Communist resistance of having an apathetic, even flippant attitude to the war in general.

==In popular culture==
In 1986, the British duo Pet Shop Boys wrote a song about Zazou called &quot;In the Night&quot;, which was the B-side for the first single release of &quot;Opportunities (Let&#x27;s Make Lots of Money)&quot;. A remix was used as the theme music for the BBC programme &quot;The Clothes Show&quot;.

<doc id="1197243" wikidata="Q1309388" url="?curid=1197243" title="Gateway drug effect">
<text>The gateway drug effect (alternatively, stepping-stone theory, escalation hypothesis, or progression hypothesis) is a comprehensive catchphrase for the often observed effect that the use of a psychoactive substance is coupled to an increased probability of the use of further substances. Possible reasons for the connection include environmental influence, impulsive people seeking both soft and hard drugs (meaning people who use one drug are likely to use another drug due to personality and that it&#x27;s not the initial drug that leads to the use of another drug), alterations in the brain due to earlier substance exposure, as well as similar attitudes of people who use different substances, and therefore experience a &quot;common liability to addiction&quot;. In 2020, the National Institute on Drug Abuse released a research report which supported allegations that marijuana is a &quot;gateway&quot; to more dangerous substance use; one of the peer-reviewed papers cited in the report claims that while &quot;some studies have found that use of legal drugs or cannabis are not a requirement for the progression to other illicit drugs [...] most studies have supported the &quot;gateway sequence&quot;.&quot; However, a 2018 literature review conducted by the National Institute of Justice, which analyzed 23 peer-reviewed research studies, concluded &quot;that existing statistical research and analysis relevant to the &quot;gateway&quot; hypothesis has produced mixed results&quot;, and that &quot;no causal link between cannabis use and the use of other illicit drugs can be claimed at this time.&quot;

== History ==
While the phrase &quot;gateway drug&quot; was first popularized by anti-drug activists such as Robert DuPont in the 1980s, the underlying ideas had already been discussed since the 1930s by using the phrases &quot;stepping-stone theory&quot;, &quot;escalation hypothesis&quot;, or &quot;progression hypothesis&quot;.

The scientific and political discussion has intensified since 1975 after the publications of several longitudinal studies by Denise Kandel and others.

In 2019, a research report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse determined that marijuana use is &quot;likely to precede use of other licit and illicit substances&quot;, and cited a longitudinal study in which &quot;adults who reported marijuana use during the first wave of the survey were more likely than adults who did not use marijuana to develop an alcohol use disorder within 3 years; people who used marijuana and already had an alcohol use disorder at the outset were at greater risk of their alcohol use disorder worsening.&quot; They further claimed that marijuana use &quot;is also linked to other substance use disorders including nicotine addiction.&quot; While stating that their &quot;findings are consistent with the idea of marijuana as a &quot;gateway drug&quot;&quot;, they conceded that &quot;the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, &quot;harder&quot; substances&quot;, and that &quot;cross-sensitization is not unique to marijuana. Alcohol and nicotine also prime the brain for a heightened response to other drugs and are, like marijuana, also typically used before a person progresses to other, more harmful substances.&quot;

On the other hand, the 2018 report issued by the National Institute of Justice states &quot;that the current state of research on this issue is limited, and the studies that have been conducted suffer from difficulties in collecting information and applying the findings to a larger population. The report further notes that although many of the reviewed studies found statistically significant associations between cannabis use and the users&#x27; later use of other illicit drugs, there is currently no conclusive evidence that cannabis use caused the later use of harder illicit drugs.&quot;

== Sequence of first-time use ==
=== General concept ===
The concept of &quot;gateway drug&quot; is based on observations that the sequence of first-time use of different drugs is not random but shows trends. On the basis of established techniques of longitudinal studies such trends can be described precisely in terms of statistical probability. As to the interpretation of the observed trends, it is important to note the difference between sequence and causation. Both may – but need not – be coupled, a question which is subject of further research, e.g., by physiological experiments.

=== Examples of trends ===

From a sample of 6,624 people who had not used other illegal drugs before their cannabis consumption the overall probability of later use of other illegal drugs was estimated to be 44.7%. Subgroup analyses showed that personal and social conditions, such as gender, age, marital status, mental disorders, family history of substance use, overlapping illegal drug distribution channels, alcohol use disorder, nicotine dependence, ethnicity, urbanicity, and educational attainment influenced the height of probability.

A study of drug use of 14,577 U.S. 12th graders showed that alcohol consumption was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs. Adolescents who smoked cigarettes before age 15 were up to 80 times more likely to use illegal drugs. Studies indicate vaping serves as a gateway to traditional cigarettes and cannabis use.

Large-scale longitudinal studies in the U.K. and New Zealand from 2015 and 2017 showed an association between cannabis use and an increased probability of later disorders in the use of other drugs.

Students who regularly consume caffeinated energy drinks have a greater risk of alcohol use disorder, cocaine use and misuse of prescription stimulants. The elevated risk remains after accounting for prior substance use and other risk factors.

A meta-analysis about the use of e-cigarettes of 2018 said that &quot;Because the term &#x27;gateway&#x27; has historically been used in colloquial, non-scientific settings and lacks a clear definition, it is not used in this report&quot;.

== Associations aside from first-time use ==
The role of cannabis use in regard to alcohol use and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is still not fully understood. Some studies suggest better alcohol treatment completion for those who use cannabis, while other studies find the opposite. A 2016 review of 39 studies which examined the relation between cannabis use and alcohol use found that 16 studies support the idea that cannabis and alcohol are substitutes for each other, 10 studies found that they are complements, 12 found that they are neither complementary nor substitutes, and one found that they are both.

A study involving self-reported data from a sample of 27,461 people examined the relationship of cannabis use and AUD. These respondents had no prior diagnosis of AUD. Of the 27,461 people, 160 had reported cannabis use within the past year. At the end of a three-year period, it found that those who had previously reported cannabis use were associated with a five times greater odds of being diagnosed with AUD than those who had not. After adjustment for select confounders (age, race, marital status, income, and education), these odds were reduced to two times greater risk. Another sample of self-reported data from 2,121 persons included only those who had already been diagnosed with AUD. In this sample, it was found that those who had reported cannabis use in the past year (416 people) were associated with 1.7 greater odds of AUD persistence three years later. After adjustment for the same confounders as before, these odds were reduced to 1.3.

== Causes ==
Because a sequence of first-time use can only indicate the possibility – but not the fact – of an underlying causal relation, different theories concerning the observed trends were developed. The scientific discussion (state of 2016) is dominated by two concepts, which appear to cover almost all possible causal connections if appropriately combined. These are the theories of biological alterations in the brain due to an earlier drug use and the theory of similar attitudes across different drugs.

=== Alterations in the brain ===
Adolescent rats repeatedly injected with tetrahydrocannabinol increased the self-administration of heroin (results based on 11 male rats and &gt;50 male rats), morphine (study based on 12 male rats) and also nicotine (34 rats). There were direct indications that the alteration consisted of lasting anatomical changes in the reward system of the brain. Because the reward system is anatomically, physiologically, and functionally almost identical across the class of mammals, the importance of the findings from animal studies for the reward system in the human brain in relation to the liability to the use of further drugs has been pointed out in several reviews.

In mice, nicotine increased the probability of later consumption of cocaine, and the experiments permitted concrete conclusions on the underlying molecular biological alteration in the brain. The biological changes in mice correspond to the epidemiological observations in humans that nicotine consumption is coupled to an increased probability of later use of cannabis and cocaine, as well as other drugs.

In rats, alcohol increased the probability of later addiction to cocaine and again relevant alterations in the reward system were identified. These observations thus correspond to the epidemiological findings that the consumption of alcohol in humans is coupled to a later increased risk of a transition from cocaine use to cocaine addiction.

Controlled animal and human studies showed that caffeine (energy drinks) in combination with alcohol increased the craving for more alcohol more strongly than alcohol alone. These findings correspond to epidemiological data that people who consume energy drinks generally showed an increased tendency to take alcohol and other substances.

=== Personal, social and genetic factors ===
According to the concept of similar attitudes across different drugs (&quot;common liability to addiction&quot;), a number of personal, social, genetic and environmental factors can lead to a generally increased interest in various drugs. The sequence of first-time use would then depend on these factors. Violations of the typical sequence of first-time drug usage give credit to this theory. For example, in Japan, where cannabis use is uncommon, 83.2% of the people who used illicit substances did not use cannabis first. The concept received additional support from a large-scale genetic analysis that showed a genetic basis for the connection of the prevalence of cigarette smoking and cannabis use during the life of a person.

The results of a twin study presented indications that familial genetic and familial environmental factors do not fully explain these associations, and are possibly only relevant for sequences of some drugs. In 219 same-sex Dutch identical and non-identical twin pairs, one co-twin had reported cannabis use before the age of 18 whereas the other had not. In the cannabis group the lifetime prevalence of later reported use of party drugs was four times higher and the lifetime prevalence of later reported use of hard drugs was seven times higher than in the non-cannabis group. The authors concluded that at least family influences – both genetic and social ones – could not explain the differences. The study noted that, besides a potential causal role of cannabis use, non shared environment factors could play a role in the association such as differing peer affiliations that preceded the cannabis use.

Another twin study (of 510 same sex twin pairs) also examined the association of earlier cannabis use and later hard drug use. Like other studies it examined later drug use differences between siblings where one sibling had used cannabis early and the other had not. The study examined identical twins (who share approximately 100% of their genes) and non-identical twins (who share approximately 50% of their genes) separately and adjusted for additional confounders such as peer drug use. It found, after confounder adjustment, that the associations with later hard drug use existed only for non-identical twins. This suggests a significant genetic factor in the likelihood of later hard drug usage. The study suggested that a causal role of cannabis use in later hard drug usage is minimal, if it exists at all, and that cannabis use and hard drug use share the same influencing factors such as genetics and environment.

<text>Villefranche-de-Rouergue (; ) is a commune in the Aveyron department in southern France. Villefranche-de-Rouergue station has rail connections to Toulouse, Figeac and Aurillac.

==History==

At the end of the Albigensian Crusade from the northern &quot;barons&quot; against the southern Occitania on a religious pretext (fighting the Cathar heresy), the count of Toulouse was defeated and concluded the Treaty of Paris in 1229. With this, the Count gave the Rouergue county to his daughter. She married Alphonse de Poitiers, brother of Saint Louis, King of France. Alphonse founded Villefranche on the place of an old village called La Peyrade in 1252.

In 1348 it was so flourishing that sumptuary laws were passed. Soon afterwards the town fell into the hands of Edward the Black Prince, but was the first place in Guyenne to rise against the English. New privileges were granted to the town by Charles V, but these were taken away by Louis XI.

In 1588 the inhabitants repulsed the forces of the Hanseatic League, and afterwards murdered a governor sent by Henry IV. The town was ravaged by plague in 1463, 1558 and 1628, and in 1643 a revolt was cruelly repressed.
During World War II, while occupied by Nazi Germany, Villefranche received a large 13th Waffen SS Handschar (1st Croatian) division. Led by Ferid Džanić, Eduard Matutinović, Božo Jelinek and Nikola Vukelić, one battalion staged a rebellion against the Nazis on 17 September 1943, (Villefranche-de-Rouergue uprising) but were soon suppressed and mostly executed on site. The few that escaped inspired the French Resistance in Aveyron that had not been formed until then. After the war, an avenue in Villefranche was named &quot;Avenue des Croates&quot; (Avenue of the Croats) in honour of the uprising.

==Buildings==
One of the principal thoroughfares passes beneath the porch of Notre-Dame, the principal church of Villefranche. Notre-Dame was built from 1260 to 1581, the massive tower which surmounts its porch being of late Gothic architecture. The woodwork in the choir dates from the 15th century.

A Carthusian monastery overlooking the town from the left bank of the Aveyron derives much interest from the completeness and fine preservation of its buildings, which date from the 15th century. They include a chapel, a vestibule, a chapter house, a refectory, an exhibition room and two cloisters, the smaller of which is a masterpiece of the late Gothic style.

<text>The (TNSC) is the largest rocket-launch complex in Japan with a total area of about . It is located on the southeastern tip of Tanegashima, an island approximately south of Kyushu, an island and region in Japan. Construction on the site started in 1966. It was established in 1969 when the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was formed, and is now run by JAXA. The activities that take place at TNSC include assembly, testing, launching, and tracking satellites, as well as rocket engine firing tests.

==Facilities==
On-site main facilities include:
* Yoshinobu Launch Complex
* Osaki Launch Complex (retired)
* Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB)
* Second Spacecraft Test and Assembly Building
* Takesaki Range Control Center

Those facilities are used for performing operations from assembling launch vehicles, maintenance, inspections, final checks of satellites, loading satellites onto launch vehicles, rocket launches, and tracking launch vehicles after liftoff. The TNSC plays a pivotal role in satellite launches among Japan&#x27;s space development activities.

Orbital launches take place from the Yoshinobu Launch Complex, lifting off from its two launch pads:
* LA-Y1 used for H-II and H-IIA launches
* LA-Y2 used for H-IIB and H-3 launches

The H-IIA first stage engine, the LE-7A, is test-fired at the Yoshinobu Firing Test Stand. Auxiliary buildings are in place for the assembly of new spacecraft and for radar and optical tracking of launched spacecraft.

The older Osaki Launch Complex was retired in 1992. It was used for the launch and development of N-I, N-II, H-I and J-I rockets.

The Space Science and Technology Museum is near TNSC. It offers an intricate view of rocket history and technology in Japan.

==In fiction==
In &quot;Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest&quot;, in the Asian Campaign, the Tanegashima Space Center is an important location, pivotal in the story to the United Federation of Asian Republics reaching Mars before the Americans or Europeans. The spaceport was completely destroyed in a nuclear bombing raid by Novaya Russia but was rebuilt by the UFAR at the request of their ally, Japan.

Episode 2 of the Japanese animated film &quot;5 Centimeters per Second&quot; features a rocket launch from Tanegashima Space Center.

In the &quot;Robotics;Notes&quot; visual novel, Tanegashima Space Center is one of the major settings found in the game. It is also featured in the anime.

In &quot;Captain Earth&quot;, Tanegashima Space Center is now controlled by Globe and serves as one of their bases.

In the Japanese animated television series &quot;Aldnoah.Zero&quot;, Tanegashima is the crash landing site of some Martian technology.

The video games &quot;Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire&quot;, along with their remakes, feature the Mossdeep Space Center, which is modeled on the Tanegashima Space Center.

In season 2, episode 19 of the Japanese animated television series &quot;Assassination Classroom&quot;, the students of class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School infiltrate a space center that is based on Tanegashima Space Center.

In the Japanese animated series &quot;&quot;, Tanegashima figures very prominently in the later episodes.

<doc id="1197274" wikidata="Q549379" url="?curid=1197274" title="GSM-R">
<text>GSM-R, Global System for Mobile Communications – Railway or GSM-Railway is an international wireless communications standard for railway communication and applications.

A sub-system of European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), it is used for communication between train and railway regulation control centers. The system is based on GSM and &quot;EIRENE – MORANE&quot; specifications which guarantee performance at speeds up to 500 km/h (310 mph), without any communication loss.

GSM-R could be supplanted by LTE-R, with the first production implementation being in South Korea. However, LTE is generally considered to be a &quot;4G&quot; protocol, and the UIC&#x27;s Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) program is considering moving to something &quot;5G&quot;-based (specifically 3GPP R15/16, i.e. 5G NR), thus skipping two technological generations.

== History ==
GSM-R is built on GSM technology, and benefits from the economies of scale of its GSM technology heritage, aiming at being a cost efficient digital replacement for existing incompatible in-track cable and analogue railway radio networks. Over 35 different such systems are reported to exist in Europe alone.

The standard is the result of over ten years of collaboration between the various European railway companies, with the goal of achieving interoperability using a single communication platform. GSM-R is part of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) standard and carries the signaling information directly to the train driver, enabling higher train speeds and traffic density with a high level of safety.

The specifications were finalized in 2000, based on the European Union-funded MORANE (Mobile Radio for Railways Networks in Europe) project. The specification is being maintained by the International Union of Railways project ERTMS. GSM-R has been selected by 38 countries across the world, including all member states of the European Union and countries in Asia, Eurasia and northern Africa.

GSM-R is a secure platform for voice and data communication between railway operational staff, including drivers, dispatchers, shunting team members, train engineers, and station controllers. It delivers features such as group calls (VGCS), voice broadcast (VBS), location-based connections, and call pre-emption in case of an emergency. This supports applications such as cargo tracking, video surveillance in trains and at stations, and passenger information services.

GSM-R is typically implemented using dedicated base station masts close to the railway, with tunnel coverage effected using directional antennae or &#x27;leaky&#x27; feeder transmission. The distance between the base stations is . This creates a high degree of redundancy and higher availability and reliability. In Germany, Italy and France the GSM-R network has between 3,000 and 4,000 base stations. In areas where the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 2 or 3 is used, the train maintains a circuit switched digital modem connection to the train control center at all times. This modem operates with higher priority than normal users (eMLPP). If the modem connection is lost, the train will automatically stop.
=== Upper system ===
GSM-R is one part of ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) which is composed of:
* ETCS (European Train Control System)
* GSM-R
* ETML (European Traffic Management Layer)
* EOR (European Operating Rules)

== Frequency band ==
GSM-R is standardized to be implemented in either the E-GSM (900 MHz-GSM) or DCS 1800 (1,800 MHz-GSM) frequency band which are both being used around the world.

=== Europe ===
Europe includes the CEPT member states, which include all EU members and Albania, Andorra, Azerbaijan, Bosnia Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, Moldavia, Monaco, Montenegro, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and Vatican City.

Although previously members of the CEPT, Belarus and Russia had their memberships suspended, indefinitely, with effect from 00:00 (CET), 18 March 2022. The CEPT Assembly made this decision following a poll of members by the CEPT Presidency, and published their decision on 17 March 2022.)

GSM-R uses a specific frequency band, which can be referred to as the &quot;standard&quot; GSM-R band:
* Uplink: 876–880 MHz used for data transmission
* Downlink: 921–925 MHz used for data reception

In Germany, this band was extended with additional channels in the 873–876 MHz and 918–921 MHz range. Being used formerly for regional trunked radio systems, the full usage of the new frequencies is aimed for 2015.

=== China ===
GSM-R occupies a 4 MHz wide range of the E-GSM band (900 MHz-GSM).
* Uplink: 885–889 MHz
* Downlink: 930–934 MHz

=== India ===
GSM-R occupies a 1.6 MHz wide range of the P-GSM band (900 MHz-GSM) held by Indian Railways:
* Uplink: 907.8–909.4 MHz
* Downlink: 952.8–954.4 MHz

=== Australia ===
GSM-R is being implemented within DCS 1800 band
* Uplink: 1,770–1,785 MHz
* Downlink: 1,865–1,880 MHz

DCS 1800 band was initially divided and auctioned in paired parcels each of 2 × 2.5 MHz with duplex spacing of 95 MHz. State rail operators acquired six mostly non-grouped parcels which cover 2 × 15 MHz of spectrum to deploy GSM-R.

State rail operators re-licensed 2 x 10 MHz of 1800 MHz spectrum in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney for Rail Safety and Control Communications. All except for South Australian Department of Planning Transport and Infrastructure (Adelaide) re-licensed 2 x 5 MHz of 1800 MHz spectrum at commercial rates set by Australian Government.

=== Technical frequency usage in GSM-R ===
The used modulation is GMSK modulation (Gaussian Minimum-Shift Keying). GSM-R is a TDMA (&quot;Time-Division Multiple Access&quot;) system. Data transmission is made of periodical &quot;TDMA frames&quot; (with a period of 4.615 ms), for each carrier frequency (physical channel). Each &quot;TDMA frame&quot; is divided in 8 time slots, named logical channels (577 μs long, each time-slot), carrying 148 bits of information.

There are worries that LTE mobile communication will disturb GSM-R, since it has been given a frequency band rather close to GSM-R. This could cause ETCS disturbances, random emergency braking because of lost communications etc.

As a result, there is an increasing trend towards monitoring and managing GSM-R interference using active and automated testing on board trains and trackside.

=== Current GSM-R version ===
The GSM-R standard specification is divided in two EIRENE specifications:
* Functional Requirement Specification (FRS): the definition of higher lever functional requirements
* System Requirement Specification (SRS): the definition of the technical solutions supporting the functional requirements

EIRENE defines the &quot;Technical Specification for Interoperability&quot; (TSI) as the set of mandatory specifications to be fulfilled to keep compatibility with other European networks; current TSI are FRS 7 and SRS 15. EIRENE also defines non-mandatory specifications, that are called &quot;Interim version&quot;, which defines extra features that are likely to become mandatory in the next TSIs. The current versions are 21 December 2015 versions FRS 8.0.0 and SRS 16.0.0
The GSM-R specifications are fairly stable; the latest mandatory upgrade was in 2006. The complete timeline of GSM-R versions is:
* December 2000: FRS 5/SRS 13, first version to be widely installed
* October 2003: FRS 6/SRS 14
* May 2006: FRS 7/SRS 15, current TSI
* June 2010: FRS7.1/SRS 15.1, current Interim version; the main added features over TSI are shunting radio and ETCS data only radio

The current version of GSM-R can run on both R99 and R4 3GPP networks.

== GSM-R uses ==

GSM-R permits new services and applications for mobile communications in several domains:
* Transmission of Long Line Public Address (LLPA) announcements to remote stations down the line
* Control and protection (Automatic Train Control/ETCS) and ERTMS
* Communication between train driver and regulation center
* Communication of on-board working people
* Information sending for ETCS
* Communication between train stations, classification yard and rail tracks

It is used to transmit data between trains and railway regulation centers with level 2 and 3 of ETCS. When the train passes over a Eurobalise, it transmits its new position and its speed, then it receives back agreement (or disagreement) to enter the next track and its new maximum speed.
Like other GSM devices, GSM-R equipment can transmit data and voice. New GSM-R features for mobile communication are based on GSM, and are specified by EIRENE project. Call features are:
* PtP Call: &quot;Point-to-Point Call&quot;, the same type of call as a normal GSM call
* VGCS: &quot;Voice Group Call System&quot;, quite similar to walkie-talkie communication but with a single uplink handled by the network (only one person can speak at a time)
* VBS: &quot;Voice Broadcast System&quot;, like a VGCS but only the call initiator can speak (the other are only listeners)
* REC: &quot;Railways Emergency Call&quot;, is a special VGCS defined as 299 with the highest priority possible (0)
* SEC: &quot;Shunting Emergency Call&quot;, is a special VGCS defined as 599 with the highest priority possible (0)
* Priority control of all the different calls (PtP, VGCS, VBSm, REC and SEC calls)
There are other additional features:
* &quot;Functional Addressing&quot;, alias system to call someone registered on the GSM-R network, only by knowing the temporary function user (engine driver of train such-and-such, ...)
* &quot;Location Dependent Addressing&quot;, routing system to call the most appropriate train controller regarding the current train position by dialling a pre-defined short code
* &quot;Shunting&quot; mode, when users work on the tracks.

== GSM-R features ==


=== ASCI (Advanced Speech Call Items) features ===
The following definitions are a part of the System Requirements Specification (SRS) as defined by the EIRENE standard.

==== VGCS (Voice Group Call Service) ====
:VGCS allows a great number of users to participate in the same call. This feature imitates the analogue PMR (Private Mobile Radio) group call with the PTT key (Push-to-Talk).

:Three kinds of users are defined: the Talker, the Listener and the Dispatcher. The talker can become a listener by releasing the PTT key and a listener becomes a talker by pressing the PTT key.

:One advantage of VGCS compared to multi-party calls (the GSM conference call feature) is the spectrum efficiency. Indeed, when many users are in the same cell they will use only one frequency for all listeners and two frequencies for the talker (as in point-to-point call). In a multi-party call, one timeslot is dedicated to each user. The second advantage compared to multi-party calls is that it is not necessary to know which mobiles are to take part in the call. A VGCS call is established on a purely geographic basis, subject to a mobile having previously enabled reception of the group concerned.

==== VBS (Voice Broadcast Service) ====
:VBS is a broadcast group call: this means that compared to VGCS, only the initiator of the call can speak. The others who join the call can only be listeners. This kind of call is mainly used to broadcast recorded messages or to make announcements.

==== REC (Railway Emergency Call) ====
:&quot;REC&quot; is a group call, or VGCS, dedicated to urgency. It is a higher priority call (REC priority is level 0 – see below : eMLPP).

==== SEC (Shunting Emergency Call) ====
The Shunting Emergency Call is a dedicated group call with the number 599. The call is established with an emergency level priority whose level is the highest possible priority 0. The SEC is enabled and used by devices registered for shunting operations. The establishment of such a call leads to automatic acceptance of the call on all enabled devices within the current area or cell-group configured.

=== Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption Service (eMLPP) ===
:This defines the user&#x27;s priority. The different priority levels are:

:* A and B: Highest priority levels (not used by GSM-R networks)
:* 0: Highest priority levels for ASCI and normal calls (mainly used for REC calls)
:* 1: Lower priority than level 0
:* 2: Lower priority than level 1
:* 3: Lower priority than level 2
:* 4: Lowest priority level (default priority, assigned to Point-to-Point calls)

:An &quot;Auto-Answering&quot; feature with a timer is also available for calls with priority 0, 1 and 2.

=== GSM-R Numbering Plan ===
The EIRENE SRS document defines a fixed numbering plan for GSM-R. It is defined by number prefixes.

Those numbers are used for functional registration and fixed entries for MSISDN or short dialcodes as defined within the HLR. 807660 for example defines a MSISDN of a mobile subscriber. The number 23030301 would be a functional number associated with the train number 30303 and the role of the user 01.

=== Eirene features ===

==== Functional number management ====
:* Functional numbering
:** Allows to call a mobile station by its function: driver of the train xxx , ...
:** It uses:
:*** USSD and Follow Me
:*** UUS1 (for number display)

:* Location dependent addressing
:** Establishes a call from a mobile station to (usually) a fixed subscriber/dispatcher performing a function in the area where the mobile station is located.

==== End Call Confirmation ====
:End Call Confirmation feature is only available for highest priority (Priority level 0) group calls (VGCS) and broadcast calls (VBS) (see eMLPP).
:It consists of an end call report which sent by all mobile stations which joined the high priority call (initiator included). This report informs about:
:* Call type
:* Call duration
:* Mobile station identity
:* End call cause Normal, ended by user, mobile station power off by user, power off due to low battery, …)

:If the report cannot be sent (mobile station power off by user or power off due to low battery), the mobile station will try again (several times if needed) to send the report at the next power on.

==== Shunting mode ====
:Shunting mode is the application that will regulate and control user access to shunting communications.
:A Link Assurance Signal (LAS) is provided to give reassurance to the driver that the radio link is working.

==== Direct mode ====
:Direct mode is the walkie-talkie mode (mobiles station talking to each other without the network) and has been proposed in Eirene, however it has never been in application since being based on analogue radio.
:Sagemcom claims to have developed a GSM direct mode, not currently recognized in the GSM-R specification, and has no frequency allocation.

== GSM-R market ==

=== GSM-R market groups ===
Different groups make up the GSM-R market:

;The network operators and the railway operators:




== Railways using GSM-R ==

=== Australia ===
Transport NSW is installing a Digital Train Radio System (DTRS) throughout the electrified rail network, including 66 tunnels covering , bounded by Kiama, Macarthur, Lithgow, Bondi Junction and Newcastle with GSM-R to replace the existing analogue MetroNet train radio. The replacement will fulfil recommendations from the Special Commission of Inquiry into the Waterfall rail accident to provide a common platform of communication for staff working on the railway. The equipment will be installed at about 250 locations and more than 60 sites in tunnels. The old analogue network was dismantled in 2020.

Public Transport Victoria has installed a Digital Train Radio System (DTRS) on the Melbourne train network with GSM-R to replace the old system called Urban Train Radio System (UTRS). The equipment was installed at about 100 locations. It cost $152 million.

=== France ===

In France, the first commercial railway route opened with full GSM-R coverage is the LGV Est européenne linking Paris Gare de l&#x27;Est to Strasbourg. It was opened on 10 June 2007.
* On Sunday, 10 June 2007 at 06:43, the first high speed train to run on it was the ICE, the high speed train from the German passenger operator: Deutsche Bahn. It linked the &quot;Gare de l&#x27;Est&quot; in Paris to Saarbrücken (Germany).
* On the same day, at 07:15, it was the opportunity of the TGV POS, the latest generation high speed train from the French operator, SNCF. It linked Strasbourg to Paris (Gare de l&#x27;Est).

=== Italy ===
As of 2008, in Italy more than of railway lines are served by the GSM-R infrastructure: this number includes both ordinary and high speed lines, as well as more than of tunnels. Roaming agreements with other Italian mobile operators allow coverage of lines not directly served by GSM-R. Roaming agreements have also been set up with French and Swiss railway companies and it is planned to extend them to other countries.

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, there is coverage on all the lines and the old system called Telerail was abandoned in favour of GSM-R in 2006.

=== Norway ===
In Norway, the GSM-R network was opened on all lines on 1 January 2007, replacing the older Scanet network.

=== United Kingdom ===

The implementation of over of GSM-R enabled railway, intended to replace both its legacy VHF 205 MHz National Radio Network (NRN) and UHF 450 MHz suburban Cab Secure Radio (CSR) systems is now complete as of January 2016. 
* By October 2013, both the West Coast Main Line (WCML) and East Coast Main Line (ECML) to Scotland were covered by GSM-R and UK train operator Northern Rail had implemented GSM-R on a significant number of routes in North and North-West of England. 
*In spring 2013, the Association of Train Operating Companies&#x27; website &quot;GSM-R Online&quot; announced that the implementation of the Southern half of the UK GSM-R system was complete as the final CA15 section had gone live (The UK GSM-R Project implementation divided the Mainland North and South of a map-line running from the Severn in the West to the Wash on the East coast). Infrastructure and installation work continued North of this division. Britain&#x27;s GSM-R network was originally expected to be fully operational by 2013, but due to slippage in equipment fitting a later date became more likely. However, a Rail Safety &amp; Standards Board document indicated that the UK&#x27;s Telecommunications Regulator, Ofcom, was to withdraw the existing NRN 205 MHz frequencies by 2015. Britain&#x27;s GSM-R network&#x27;s cost was originally put at £1.2 billion. That cost though did not include the WCML.
* The Cambrian Line ERTMS – Pwllheli to Harlech Rehearsal commenced on 13 February 2010 and successfully finished on 18 February 2010. The driver familiarisation and practical handling stage of the Rehearsal had provided an excellent opportunity to monitor the use of GSM-R voice in operation on this route. The first train departed Pwllheli at 08:53hrs in ERTMS Level 2 Operation with GSM-R voice being used as the only means of communication between the driver and the signaller.
* Network Rail fitted out a test train at Derby it purchased for RSV testing of the GSM-R network. The train was formed from ex Gatwick Express stock. At a cost of £5.9 million, this custom-built machine known as the RSV (Radio Signal Verification) train started monitoring the Newport Synergy scheme and the Cambrian Line.
* On 2 September 2009, the Rugby to Stoke section went live.
* The first train (Virgin Trains West Coast 390034 on the 09:15 Manchester Piccadilly service to London Euston) to use GSM-R on the south end of the WCML ran on 27 May 2009. This was the first vehicle to run in passenger service with GSM-R outside of the Strathclyde trial.
* A fully functional GSM-R system had been on trial on the North Clyde Line in Scotland since 2007. For some years before these trials commenced however, GSM-R had been in use for voice-only purposes – known as the &#x27;Interim Voice Radio System&#x27; (IVRS) – in some locations where axle counters are used for train detection, for example parts of the WCML between Crewe and Wembley.

, the only areas of UK Network Rail still currently employing VHF train radio communications are on sections of the Highland and Far North lines in Scotland, where the Radio Electronic Token Block system is utilised, using modified Ofcom frequencies around 180 MHz, having been de-scoped from the National GSM-R plan, due to practical difficulties involved in deploying the GSM-R system in this region. Currently, 100% of the UK network has GSM-R coverage.

<doc id="1197277" wikidata="Q1811161" url="?curid=1197277" title="The Shining (miniseries)">
<text>The Shining (stylized as Stephen King&#x27;s The Shining) is a 1997 three-episode horror television miniseries based on the 1977 Stephen King novel of the same name. Directed by Mick Garris from King&#x27;s teleplay, it is the second adaptation of King&#x27;s book after the 1980 film by Stanley Kubrick and was written and produced by King based on his dissatisfaction with Kubrick&#x27;s version. The miniseries was shot at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, King&#x27;s inspiration for the novel, in March 1996.

The 1997 adaptation stars Steven Weber as Jack Torrance; Rebecca De Mornay as Jack&#x27;s wife Wendy; Courtland Mead and Wil Horneff as different-aged versions of Danny Torrance; and Melvin Van Peebles as Dick Hallorann. Pat Hingle, Elliott Gould, John Durbin, Stanley Anderson, Lisa Thornhill, and Garris&#x27; wife Cynthia appear in supporting roles. Several notable writers and filmmakers working in the horror genre cameo in the miniseries&#x27; ballroom scene, and King himself appears as an orchestra conductor.

Originally airing from April 27 to May 1, 1997 on the American television network ABC, &quot;The Shining&quot; enjoyed a favorable reception when it first aired. It was a ratings hit, being in the top 20 of daily viewership numbers for all three episodes; acclaimed by critics for its careful pacing, makeup, depth, sound editing and creepy atmosphere; and won two Primetime Emmy and two Saturn Awards. However, retrospective critics have viewed the miniseries less fondly, declaring it boring and unfocused, and comparing it unfavorably to Kubrick&#x27;s film version.

==Plot==
Jack Torrance&#x27;s alcoholism and explosive temper have cost him his teaching job at Stovington, a respectable prep school. He is also on the verge of losing his family, after assaulting his young son Danny in a drunken rage just a year earlier. Horrified by what he has become, Jack tells his wife Wendy that should he ever start drinking again, he will leave them one way or another, implying that he would rather suicide than continue living as an alcoholic.

Now, nursing a life of sobriety and pulling in work as a writer, Jack takes on the job of looking after the Overlook Hotel, a large colonial building in a picturesque valley in the Colorado Rockies. Jack believes that the job will provide desperately needed funds and give him the time to complete his first play.

Upon entering the Overlook and meeting its head cook, Dick Hallorann, Danny discovers that his psychic powers grant him a form of telepathy. Danny has an adult mentor named Tony who talks to him in his visions and shows him the future. Hallorann tells Danny that he too &quot;shines&quot;, and that Danny can contact him telepathically anytime he needs assistance. The Torrances are given a tour of the Overlook before being left alone in the hotel for the winter.

It gradually becomes evident that there is a malevolent force within the hotel that seems determined to use Danny for an unknown, possibly sinister purpose. This force manifests itself with flickering lamps and spectral voices and eventually a full-on masked ball from the Overlook&#x27;s past. Danny is the first to fully notice the darker character of the hotel, having experienced visions and warnings that foreshadow what he and his parents will encounter over the winter.

The ghosts also appear to Jack, led by Delbert Grady, the Overlook&#x27;s former steward who murdered his entire family and killed himself at the hotel&#x27;s command. Grady and the other spirits tell Jack that Wendy and Danny are turning against him, and that his only option is to kill them. They also supply him with an open bar, and he begins drinking again. As Jack&#x27;s sanity deteriorates, Wendy begins to fear for her and Danny&#x27;s safety.

Hallorann, whom Danny had contacted telepathically, travels from Florida to Colorado, only to be assaulted by Jack with a roque mallet and left for dead. Danny telepathically communicates with his father, who momentarily breaks free of the ghosts&#x27; grip, and then tells him that the old boiler has been neglected. Danny, Wendy, and Hallorann (who had only been stunned by the attack) escape to safety. Jack sacrifices himself to prevent the ghosts from repossessing him and allows the boiler to explode and destroy the Overlook.

Ten years later, Danny graduates from high school, showing that Tony was Danny&#x27;s adult incarnate self. Wendy and Halloran are present at the ceremony. Jack&#x27;s spirit is also present, looking on Danny with pride. Back in Colorado, the Overlook is being rebuilt as a resort for the summer, as the ghosts of the original hotel await potential victims.

Sam Raimi also briefly appears as a gas station attendant.

==Production==
===Development===
The creation of this miniseries is attributed to Stephen King&#x27;s dissatisfaction with director Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 film of the same name. In order to receive Kubrick&#x27;s approval to re-adapt &quot;The Shining&quot; into a program closer to the original story, King had to agree in writing to eschew his frequent public criticism of Kubrick&#x27;s film, save for the sole commentary that he was disappointed with Jack Nicholson&#x27;s portrayal of Jack Torrance as though he had been insane before his arrival at the Overlook Hotel. ABC&#x27;s success with previous miniseries adaptations of King&#x27;s work made them more than willing to offer the author to work on the screenplay for &quot;The Shining&quot; miniseries with small Broadcast Standards and Practices enforced.

The casting team had a very difficult time finding an actor for the role of Jack Torrance as most of the considerations who rejected the role worried about being compared to Nicholson&#x27;s performance in the Kubrick version. Two of the many actors considered included Tim Daly (who had starred with Weber on the TV series &quot;Wings&quot;) and Gary Sinise. King got very impatient, threatening to &quot;wait another 18 years&quot; if the role for Jack Torrance wasn&#x27;t booked. Finally, via a suggestion from Rebecca De Mornay, Weber was chosen for the role four days before filming began. Weber accepted the offer because he was a fan of the Mick Garris-directed miniseries for &quot;The Stand&quot; and found the script he read to be &quot;multi-layered&quot; and relatable. King was the one who chose De Mornay for the role of Wendy. The producers approached her in 1994, and she accepted the role, enjoying the script for being &quot;creepier, more disturbing, and more entertaining,&quot; and closer to the novel than the Kubrick version.

===Filming===
Aside from the motive behind the creation of the miniseries, the 1997 rendition featured an important set piece that helped to inspire the original story: The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. King used the hotel that inspired him to write the book as the miniseries&#x27; location, with some interior shots in stages also in Denver. Garris tried to make the hotel feel as &quot;enclosed&quot; as possible to add a vibe of claustrophobia when in a closed hotel; the crew did this by emphasizing the &quot;darkness&quot; of the hotel, painting some of Stanley&#x27;s areas that had recently been painted white, brown.

The production team began shooting at the Stanley Hotel in March 1996, the date chosen as it was Denver&#x27;s snowiest month. However, on the day filming began, they realized the hotel as well as most of Estes Park was in a &quot;snow shadow,&quot; meaning it garnered the least amount of snow out of all Denver areas. As a result, they spent $100,000 in snowmaking machines sent from Los Angeles while lucking out on &quot;three or four&quot; shooting days with actual snow falling on Estes. Producer Mark Carliner attributed the lucky snowfalls to a Ute shaman doing a ritual at the highest peak of the Rocky Mountains. The cast and crew, such as Cynthia Garris, Mick Garris&#x27; wife who plays the woman in Room 217; and Dawn Jeffrey-Nelson, Courtland Mead&#x27;s acting coach claimed paranormal experiences occurring at the hotel during shooting.

Some of the cast enjoyed working on &quot;The Shining&quot;. Mead &quot;wasn&#x27;t scared&quot; as he had acted previously in horror films like &quot;&quot; (1996); John Durbin enjoyed the &quot;madness&quot; he got to portray with his character of Horace Derwent; and Stanley Anderson, who accepted the part of Delbert Grady based on his disappointment with the Kubrick version, tried to play the character &quot;real&quot; but with &quot;a sense of distance to [his] view of the other and the world, so it comes out as irony or wryness.&quot; However, it was tough for Weber to play his character; because the scenes were not shot in chronological order, it was very difficult to master the character&#x27;s mental state deterioration, due to it occurring gradually as the story progresses.

===Effects===
Steve Johnson and his XFX team were responsible for the effects of &quot;The Shining&quot;. When it came to the moving topiary animals, both live static and computer-animated versions of them were made. For the more-than-80 dead extra characters in the ballroom, Bill Corso came up with the idea to add black marks on their cheeks and foreheads to make them look dead. A special-effects-predominant ballroom sequence wasn&#x27;t in the final version, where Gage Creed and his orchestra &quot;run like tallow,&quot; in King&#x27;s words. Garris&#x27; reason was that it slowed down the miniseries&#x27; pacing and wasn&#x27;t as &quot;close[] to the real world&quot; as the other scenes. For the makeup of the woman in Room 217, thin shells of Saran Wrap were first glued on to certain areas of the actress&#x27; body via K-Y jelly. Then, &quot;some really milky-looking flesh tones&quot; were added over the wrap and purple tones under it, before thin latex was covered over the entire body with certain areas ripped off. Foam latex was also used to slightly alleviate how &quot;creepy&quot; the woman&#x27;s make-up looked. As Johnson explained what the effects team were going for with the dead lady, &quot;the idea was to try to do something that was different, that would look cool, play in the scene and be allowed on TV.&quot;

==Reception==
The first part of &quot;The Shining&quot; garnered 19.8 million viewers, ranking #12 for the week with a household rating of 12.5 and a market share of 19. The second part also ranked #12 for the week, with 18.3 million viewers, a 12.1 rating and a 20 share. The third part ranked #14 for the week, with 18.2 million viewers, an 11.9 rating and a 16 share.

&quot;The Shining&quot; opened to overwhelming praise from critics when it aired in 1997, which included a ten-out-of-ten review from &quot;TV Guide&quot;. The miniseries&#x27; &quot;carefully&quot; and &quot;masterfully crafted&quot; pacing was highlighted by several reviewers, including Ray Richmond of &quot;Variety&quot;, who also noted its &quot;edge-of-your-seat creepiness&quot; and &quot;surprising emotional complexity and depth.&quot; The depth and creepiness was also praised by Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. However, Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; advised his readers to &quot;avoid [the miniseries] like the plague, because it is the plague.&quot;

In more recent years, the miniseries critical reputation has cooled considerably with most finding it inferior compared to Kubrick&#x27;s adaptation. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 36% of critics have given the miniseries a positive review based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 6.0/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s televisual adaptation of his own novel is more faithful than its cinematic counterpart, but unfortunately this miniseries is hobbled by a drab literalism of the text and cheesy effects that diminish the scares.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Drew Grant of &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, in 2014, ranked the miniseries as the worst made-for-TV King adaptation.

<text>Lajes Field or Lajes Air Base (; ), officially designated Air Base No. 4 (&quot;Base Aérea N.º 4&quot;, BA4) , is a multi-use airfield near Lajes and northeast of Angra do Heroísmo on Terceira Island in the Azores, Portugal. It is home to the Portuguese Air Force &quot;Base Aérea N.º 4&quot; and Azores Air Zone Command (), a United States Air Force detachment unit (operated by the 65th Air Base Group of United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa), and a regional air passenger terminal. Located about east of New York City and about west of Lisbon, Portugal; the base sits in a strategic location midway between North America and Europe in the north Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
The origin of the Lajes Field dates back to 1928, when Portuguese Army Lieutenant Colonel Eduardo Gomes da Silva wrote a report on the possible construction of an airfield in the plainland of Lajes, for that branch&#x27;s aviation service (). However, the location of Achada on the center of the island was chosen instead at the time for the construction of the field. In 1934, the Achada airfield was condemned due to its inadequate dimensions and adverse weather conditions, resulting in the construction of a landing strip of packed earth and a small group of support facilities by the Portuguese military at Lajes.

===World War II===

During World War II, the designation of the airfield was changed to Air Base No. 4 and the Portuguese government expanded the runway, sending troops and equipment to Terceira, including Gloster Gladiator fighters. The military activities in the Azores grew in 1942, as the Gladiators began to be used to support allied convoys, in reconnaissance missions and on meteorological flights. In addition, the first Portuguese Junkers Ju 52 arrived in July 1942 to fly cargo missions.
By 1943, the British and American armed forces were allowed basing rights in Portugal. Within a month of disembarking on Terceira in October 1943, the Royal Air Force had laid pierced steel planking to lengthen the runway at Lajes Field, allowing the Royal Air Force to begin patrols. The first attack on a German U-boat was conducted in November, sinking the submarine; this attack was followed by a dozen more attacks on U-boats by the end of February 1944, after which German forces stayed clear of the British and American patrol areas. The Azores enabled British and American airmen to protect Allied shipping in the area.

On 1 December 1943, British and U.S. military representatives at RAF Lajes Field signed a joint agreement outlining the roles and responsibilities for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and United States Navy (USN) at Lajes Field. The agreement established guidelines and limitations for the ferrying of aircraft to Europe via Lajes Field. In return, the US agreed to assist the British in improving and extending existing facilities at Lajes. Air Transport Command transport planes began landing at Lajes Field immediately after the agreement was signed. By the end of June 1944, more than 1,900 American airplanes had passed through this Azorean base. Using Lajes Field, the flying time relative to the usual transatlantic route between Brazil and West Africa was nearly cut in half from 70 to 40 hours.
Lajes Field was one of the two stopover and refueling bases for the first transatlantic crossing of non-rigid airships (blimps) in 1944. The USN sent six Goodyear-built K-ships from Naval Air Station South Weymouth in Massachusetts to their first stopover base at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland and then on to Lajes Field in the Azores before flying to their final destination at Port Lyautey (Kenitra), French Morocco. From their base with Fleet Air Wing 15 at Port Lyautey, the blimps of USN Blimp Squadron 14 (ZP-14 or Blimpron 14) conducted night-time anti-submarine warfare (ASW) to search for German U-boats around the Strait of Gibraltar using magnetic anomaly detection (MAD). In 1945, two ZP-14 replacement blimps were sent from Weeksville, North Carolina, to the Bermudas and Lajes before going on to Craw Field (Kenitra Air Base) at Port Lyautey.

===Post-war===

The United States and the United Kingdom transferred control of Lajes back to Portugal in 1946. The Portuguese redesignated Lajes as Air Base No. 4 and assigned it to the air branch of the Portuguese Army. However, talks between the U.S. and Portugal began about extending the American stay in the Azores. A temporary agreement was reached between the U.S. and Portuguese governments giving the U.S. military rights to Lajes Field for an additional 18 months: the relationship between the Portuguese and American governments continues to this day, where the U.S. military resides under a tenancy status, and the Portuguese government retaining rights of ownership to the land and infrastructure. Lajes Field remains Portuguese Air Base 4 under the direction of Headquarters Azores Air Zone commanded by Portuguese Air Force &quot;brigadeiro&quot; (equal to a U.S. two-star general).

In 1947, the Portuguese &quot;Esquadra 41&quot; started to operate from Lajes, equipped with Boeing SB-17, Grumman HU-16 Albatross, Douglas C-54 Skymaster and, later Sikorsky H-19 helicopters. In 1952, the U.S. Air Force activated the 57th Air Rescue Squadron at Lajes Field, where it was based until inactivated in 1972. These units were responsible for the search and rescue (SAR) operations in the Atlantic between Europe and North America.

In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance was established. Portugal, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and other western European countries were charter members of NATO. By reason of the NATO alliance, Lajes was available for use by those countries, and the use of Lajes was one of Portugal&#x27;s primary contributions to the alliance. However, use of Lajes Field by the U.S. Department of Defense takes place under a U.S.-Portuguese Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), separate and in addition to NATO arrangements.

In 1953, Admiral Lynde D. McCormick, the Commander-in-Chief, United States Atlantic Command organized a subordinate unified command in the Azores called U.S. Forces Azores (USFORAZ). A small staff of United States Army, United States Air Force, and United States Marine Corps personnel composed the joint staff of USFORAZ, serving as the liaison between the U.S. and the Portuguese in the Azores.

In the late 1950s, USAF air refueling/tanker aircraft were stationed at Lajes to provide inflight refueling for U.S. aircraft transiting the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the tanker units left Lajes by 1965, but others returned later, especially the USAF Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. This transfer, coupled with the introduction of newer long-range aircraft, resulted in a gradual decline in Lajes traffic. The Military Air Transport Service (MATS) and its successor, the Military Airlift Command (MAC), became responsible for USAF activities at the base, and for a while the 1605th Military Airlift Support Wing acted as USAF host unit.

Lajes Field also played a crucial role in Cold War politics. From 1932 to 1968, Portugal was under the dictatorship of António de Oliveira Salazar, yet the U.S. Government maintained friendly relations with his Estado Novo government, especially after 1943. The Cold War military importance of Lajes Field outweighed considerations about the Salazar Government&#x27;s dictatorial rule over Portugal.

In 1961, the Portuguese Air Force EICAP (heavy aircraft advanced training unit) was transferred to Lajes, operating Douglas C-47, Douglas C-54 and later CASA C-212 Aviocar.

During the Portuguese Colonial War, from 1961 to 1975, the Air Force Hospital at Lajes operated as the main centre for treatment and rehabilitation of mutilated and heavy burned soldiers of the three services of the Portuguese Armed Forces.

During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Lajes Field also supported Operation Nickel Grass U.S. airlift missions to Israel, highlighting the importance of the U.S. Air Force base at Lajes.

Another important Cold War operation at Lajes was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval Air Facility Lajes (NAF Lajes), a tenant activity at the air base. NAF Lajes, and its associated Tactical Support Center (TSC)/Antisubmarine Warfare Operations Center (ASWOC), supported rotational detachments of U.S. Navy P-2 Neptune and later P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft that would track Soviet attack, guided missile, and ballistic missile submarines in the region. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, and end of the Cold War, P-3 operations at Lajes declined, and the Naval Air Facility was inactivated in the late 1990s.

===Post-Carnation Revolution===
Following the Portuguese Air Force reorganization of 1978, Lajes Air Base comes to have two resident flying units: Squadron 503 - equipped with CASA C-212 aircraft and Squadron 752 - equipped with Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma helicopters. In 1980, a detachment of Squadron 301 - equipped with Fiat G.91 fighter-bombers - starts to be based at Lajes, this being augmented and becoming Squadron 303 &quot;Jaguares&quot; in 1981.

The Azores Islands earthquake affected Terceira Island. Damage to Lajes Field was minimal, but Portuguese communities throughout the island suffered extensive damage. Military personnel responded with food, shelter, equipment, and manpower.

In the summer of 1984, Lajes undertook a new mission known as &quot;SILK PURSE.&quot; Boeing EC-135s began operating out of Lajes Field as an airborne command post for the U.S. Commander-in-Chief, Europe. Along with the aircraft came the U.S. European Command battle staff and flight crews from United States Air Forces in Europe. This mission was ended in late August 1991.

In 1990, Squadron 303 was disbanded.

Lajes supported the large airlift during the Gulf War. On the first day of the deployment over 90 aircraft transited Lajes. Strategic Air Command (SAC) created a provisional tanker wing, the 802nd Air Refueling Wing (P) Provisional, at Lajes to support the airlift. At the height of the operation a peak of 33 tanker aircraft and 600 troops deployed to Lajes. Soon after the Gulf War ended, Lajes command changed from Air Mobility Command, to Air Combat Command.

In 1993, squadrons 503 and 752 are merged in a single mixed unit operating both C-212 and Aérospatiale Puma, the 711 Squadron &quot;Albatrozes&quot; (&quot;Albatrosses&quot;).

The resident Portuguese 711 Squadron was deactivated on 30 November 2006. With this act the long-serving Aerospatiale Puma was retired from service. The Puma helicopters were replaced by the modern AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin: the Portuguese government purchased twelve units for SAR, CSAR and Fisheries enforcement. Air Base No. 4 received three Merlins on permanent detachment from Esquadra 751 &quot;Pumas&quot; from Air Base No. 6 at Montijo, near Lisbon. They saw immediate service starting 1 December 2006. However, maintenance problems developed in the next coming months which, coupled with a shortage of spare parts from the manufacturer, led to such a low serviceable rate forcing the Portuguese Air Force to pull the Merlin from service in the Azores. The last Merlin flew back to Montijo on 19 March 2009. In order not to compromise the SAR mission, the Portuguese Air Force decided to reactivate the Puma fleet: in July 2008 a formation of four Puma helicopters made the trans-Atlantic crossing from Beja to Lajes via Porto Santo Airport on Porto Santo Island and Santa Maria Airport on Santa Maria Island.

Beginning in 1997, large scale fighter aircraft movements under the new USAF operating concept known as the Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) filled the Lajes flightline. Lajes also has hosted B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bomber aircraft on global air missions, and also supported many routine NATO exercises, such as the biennial Northern Viking exercise. Lajes Field services aircraft from various nations, including Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, India, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, Qatar, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela. The airfield was an alternative landing site for the NASA Space Shuttle orbiter and also now plays as the number one diversion airport for medical or mechanical emergency diversion situations for all types of aircraft. An annual average of 50 aircraft of all types divert to Lajes as a mid Atlantic safe haven.

=== 2000 – present ===

In 2009 Lajes provided rescue support of shipping lanes across the Atlantic, a safe haven for medical or mechanical emergency situations in aircraft crossing the Atlantic, and support for the USAF&#x27;s continuing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fighter, tanker and transport planes frequently stopped there, either east or westbound. The next decade expects to see a rise in the number of U.S. Department of Defense aircraft to transit Lajes supporting the newly created AFRICOM.

In August 2006, Portuguese news agencies reported that both governments were in discussions for a new agreement that could allow the use of Lajes for the training of a permanent F-22 Raptor squadron. Since 1943, the use of Lajes by the U.S. military has allowed Portugal to strengthen diplomatic relations with the U.S. as well as obtain military equipment for the Portuguese Armed Forces, including two A-7P Corsair II squadrons and the co-finance of F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft under the Peace Atlantis I program. In August 2010, Portuguese news agencies advised for the termination of the F-22 Raptor plan to use Lajes as a platform for Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) training over the Atlantic Ocean. DoD sources were cited as the plan cancelled due to budgetary constraints. This was regarded locally as a setback for the military environment at Lajes, as well as raising doubts from regional political forces who have concerns regarding the base future as well as the safety of the Azorean employed workforce.

Portugal has explored contingencies in the event the United States military eventually abandons Lajes, including the possibility of entering an agreement with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. On June 27, 2012, an airplane carrying Premier Wen Jiabao made a four-hour stop at Lajes during which time he toured the island.

On 13 December 2012, the US Department of Defense announced, as part of a larger Air Force effort to shape the force, that Lajes Field will transition from an air base wing to an air base group with a reduction of more than 400 military personnel and 500 family members by the end of fiscal year 2014. This force reduction is estimated to garner a cost savings of $35 million annually.

== Role and operations ==

=== Transit stop ===

The base supports NATO and non-NATO armed forces assets crossing the Atlantic for transport, VIP, exercise, relief or humanitarian duties.

The civilian terminal also plays an important role in support of passenger and cargo airliners, executive, corporate and private jets flying to the island or beyond as the central location in the Azores group of islands makes it an ideal spot for refuelling or stopover. In the past five years, large Antonov An-124 and An-225 aircraft have been seen frequently transporting outsized cargo for destinations in North and South America.

Lajes provides support to 15,000 aircraft, including fighters from the US and 20 other allied nations. The geographic position has made this airbase strategically important to both the United States and NATO&#x27;s war fighting capability. In addition, a small commercial aviation terminal handles scheduled and chartered flights from North America and Europe, especially mainland Portugal. It also supervises commercial air traffic with the other islands in the Azorean archipelago and trans-Atlantic refuelling and stopovers for commercial airlines, executive and corporate jets, air cargo haulers, small private aircraft, governmental flights, humanitarian missions, and other flights.

===United States Air Force===

Lajes Field is the home of the 65th Air Base Group, which in turn is subordinate to the United States Air Forces in Europe. The group provides base and en route support for the U.S. Department of Defense, NATO, and other authorized aircraft transiting the installation. Due to the global economic crisis, the US government decided to reduce the military contingent at Lajes to no more than 170 active duty personnel. Families will relocate stateside or elsewhere, several buildings, dorms and homes will be made redundant. This much reduced effective will still be responsible to keep Lajes operational mission active although at a much reduced scale, with relevant changes to be implemented from March 2014.

In addition to the 65th Air Base Wing, other units at Lajes Field include the U.S. Army Military Traffic Management Command&#x27;s 1324th Military Port Command in the nearby port of Praia da Vitoria, U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command’s 729th Air Mobility Support Squadron, Detachment 6 of the Air Force Public Affairs Agency, Detachment 250 - Air Force Office of Special Investigations, DLA Disposition Services, and the Defense Commissary Agency.

Lajes Field is also the home of the 65th Communication Squadron, which provides communication in the form of High Frequency Global Communications Systems (HFGCS), ground radio, ground radar, SatCom (Satellite Communications), and cryptography to the base.

<doc id="1197287" wikidata="Q604667" url="?curid=1197287" title="Emilio Pucci">
<text>Emilio Pucci, [[Marquess|Marchese]] di Barsento (; 20 November 1914 – 29 November 1992) was an Italian aristocrat, fashion designer and politician. He and his eponymous company designed geometric prints in many colors.

==Early life==
Pucci was born in Naples in 1914 to the Pucci family, and he lived and worked in the Pucci Palace in Florence for much of his life.

At the age of 17 Pucci traveled to Lake Placid, New York, as part of the Italian team at the 1932 Winter Olympics, where he did not compete. After two years at the University of Milan, he studied agriculture at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, United States. In 1935, he was given a full scholarship to Reed College in Oregon in return for developing a college ski team. He earned an MA in social science from Reed College in 1937, and was awarded his doctorate (&quot;laurea&quot;) in political science from the University of Florence the same year.

==World War II==
In 1938, Pucci joined the Italian Air Force, and served as an SM.79 torpedo bomber pilot during World War II, rising to the rank of captain and receiving decorations for valour. During the war he became a confidant of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s eldest daughter, Edda, and played a key role in a plan to save the life of her husband, Mussolini&#x27;s former Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, who was on trial for his part in the removal of Mussolini from power in 1943. The plan involved delivering some of Ciano&#x27;s papers (which were highly critical of Mussolini) to the Gestapo so that they could be bartered for Ciano&#x27;s life.

After Adolf Hitler vetoed the scheme, Pucci drove Edda to the Swiss border on 9 January 1944 and ensured her escape. Before departing, Edda wrote last pleas to Hitler, Mussolini, and General Wilhelm Harster, the SD commander in Italy, and Pucci delivered these letters to an intermediary. He then attempted to flee to Switzerland himself, but he was arrested and transported to San Vittore prison in Milan, where he was tortured by the Gestapo in a futile attempt to extract information. Pucci then managed to escape and reach Switzerland, where he remained until the end of the war.

==Fashion career==

The first clothes designed by Pucci were for the Reed College skiing team. His designs came to wider attention in 1947, when he was on leave in Zermatt, Switzerland. Skiwear that he had designed for a female friend was photographed by Toni Frissell, a photographer working for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Frissell&#x27;s editor asked Pucci to design skiwear for a story on European Winter Fashion, which ran in the winter 1948 issue of the &quot;Bazaar&quot;.

Pucci was the first person to design a one-piece ski suit. Although there had been some experiments with stretch fabrics in Europe before the war, Pucci&#x27;s sleek designs caused a sensation, and he received several offers from American manufacturers to produce them. Instead, he left the Air Force and set up an haute couture house in the fashionable resort of Canzone del Mare on the Isle of Capri.

Initially, he used his knowledge of stretch fabrics to produce a swimwear line in 1949, but he soon moved onto other items such as brightly coloured, boldly patterned silk scarves. Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus encouraged him to use the designs in blouses and then a popular line of wrinkle-free printed silk dresses. Pucci presented his collection in the first fashion shows in Italy in 1950. Pucci added a boutique in Rome as business thrived, helped by Capri&#x27;s role as a destination for the international jet set. By the early 1950s, Pucci was achieving international recognition, receiving the Neiman-Marcus Award in Dallas and the Burdines Sunshine Award in Miami.

By the 1960s, Pucci was further thrust into greater status when Marilyn Monroe became a fan. She was photographed by George Barris in a number of Pucci&#x27;s items in what would be some of her final photographs. After Monroe&#x27;s death in 1962, she was interred wearing a Pucci dress.

As the decade progressed his designs were worn by everyone from actress Sophia Loren to author Jacqueline Susann to First Lady Jackie Kennedy, as well as later pop icons such as Madonna during an early 1990s period of 60s revival. Whenever the Sixties were revived in fashion, Pucci was likely to be referenced. In fashion history, especially during the period of the 1950s and 1960s, Pucci was a perfect transition example between luxurious couture and ready-to-wear in Europe and the North America.

In 1959, Pucci decided to create a lingerie line. His in Rome advised him to develop the line abroad, avoiding the difficulties of a decade earlier in matching available fabrics to the patterns of his first swimwear line. As a result, Pucci came to Chicago giving the lingerie contract to Formfit-Rogers mills. The venture proved to be successful, and Pucci was made vice president in charge of design and merchandising for the company a year later.

In February 1959, he married Cristina Nannini from Rome, about whom he later remarked, &quot;I married a Botticelli.&quot; They had two children, Alessandro and Laudomia. Alessandro died in a car crash in 1998, six years after his father.

==Braniff Airways, NASA, and Lincoln==
In 1965, New York ad agency Jack Tinker and Associates was hired by Braniff International Airways to update their image. The agency&#x27;s Mary Wells hired Alexander Girard to remodel the terminals, and Pucci to design new clothes for the hostesses. 

Pucci designed six complete collections for Braniff hostesses, pilots and ground crew between 1965 and 1974. By 1968 Barbie had versions of all of his first four uniforms. These were designed as individual components to be added or removed as weather dictated. The uniforms included turtlenecks, T-shirts, crop jackets, and culottes. Pucci incorporated Girard&#x27;s &quot;BI&quot; logo into some of his prints.
Pucci suggested the three bird motif for the design of the Apollo 15 mission patch.

From 1976 to 1983, Pucci chose exterior and interior colors and trim for a special Pucci Edition of the Lincoln Mark series of automobiles for the luxury Lincoln division of Ford Motor Company in the United States: a Mark IV in 1976, a Mark V from 1977 to 1979, and a Mark VI from 1980 to 1983, the details of the design changing slightly each year.

==Political career==
Pucci contested the Florence–Pistoia district for the Italian Liberal Party in the Italian election of April 1963. He came second on their slate with 2,780 votes behind Vittorio Fossombroni, and the party won one seat. He succeeded Fossombroni in the Italian Chamber of Deputies in August of that year.

He retained his seat in the 1968 election and lost it in the 1972 election, in which he was the district&#x27;s top PLI candidate with 4,231 votes.

==Pucci label==
After Emilio Pucci&#x27;s death in 1992, his daughter, Laudomia Pucci, continued to design under the Pucci name. The French LVMH luxury goods empire acquired 67% of Pucci in 2000. Laudomia became Image Director, while LVMH brought in major designers such as Christian Lacroix (creative director 2002–2005), and in October 2005, Matthew Williamson, and Peter Dundas from 2009.

Emilio Pucci clothes and accessories are sold through Emilio Pucci and Rossignol boutiques worldwide, and in high-end department stores designed by . The items mostly feature the designer&#x27;s original brightly coloured, often swirly, prints or new designs in his original distinct style. The fashion house produces ready-to-wear clothes and accessories for women, in addition to a small range of men&#x27;s accessories. In the past, the house has produced a more comprehensive range of men&#x27;s wear, including a line in partnership with Ermenegildo Zegna, which included men&#x27;s jackets lined with Pucci printed fabric, especially for American department store Saks Fifth Avenue. A limited-edition Pucci carrying case for the PlayStation Portable handheld gaming system was marketed by Sony as a high-end accessory on their PlayStation Signature line.

Pucci boutiques in the U.S., all designed by the Brazilian , are located in New York City, Las Vegas, Bal Harbour, Palm Beach, Beverly Hills, Boston, South Coast Plaza, East Hampton, New York, Miami and coming soon to Dallas. The newest of the stores just opened at 855 Monroe Ave. in New York City.

Clients include singer Kylie Minogue and presenter Alexa Chung.

Pucci also designed the costumes for Rita Ora&#x27;s Radioactive Tour. In March 2014, Alessandra Carra stepped down as CEO of Pucci. In March 2015, Massino Giorgetti was named creative director, replacing Peter Dundas. Then from 2017 to 2021, Pucci operated without a creative director, relying on a team of designers. Since June 2021, LVMH owns 100% of Pucci. Laudomia Pucci remained in charge of the house&#x27;s archives and heritage. In September 2021, Camille Miceli became creative director of Pucci. In July 2022, Saar Debrouwere took over as CEO of the fashion house.

<doc id="1197290" wikidata="Q2621327" url="?curid=1197290" title="Tank classification">
<text>Tank classification is a taxonomy of identifying either the intended role or weight class of tanks. The classification by role was used primarily during the developmental stage of the national armoured forces, and referred to the doctrinal and force structure utility of the tanks based on design emphasis. The weight classification is used in the same way truck classification is used, and is intended to accommodate logistic requirements of the tanks.

Many classification systems have been used over a hundred years of tank history. An early division in the definition of roles was between infantry tanks intended to focus on supporting infantry in the assault, and cruiser tanks intended for classic cavalry missions of exploitation, screening and reconnaissance. As World War II progressed, the separation of &quot;infantry&quot; and &quot;cruiser&quot; roles generally disappeared and the &quot;universal tank&quot; started to take over.

Classification has always been determined by the prevailing theories of armoured warfare, which have been altered in turn by rapid advances in technology. No one classification system works across all periods or all nations; in particular, weight-based classification was inconsistent between countries and eras.

With the worldwide adoption of the modern main battle tank designs, which favour a modular universal design, these sorts of classifications are mostly eliminated from modern terminology. All main battle tanks are typically armed with weapons with similar characteristics but some may be armoured more than others. These are complemented with light tanks, typically in the role of (armed) reconnaissance.

==Development of tank classification schemes==

Development of a tank classification system started in World War I, when tanks were separated into light tanks and tankettes, medium tanks, and heavy tanks, based on size and weight. Heavy tanks were required to be large to cross trenches, and consequently weighed a lot. Medium tanks were smaller and had help to cross trenches so weighed less. Light tanks were much smaller and lightweight, allowing transport on lorries (trucks).

These tanks started to be used in different roles based on armour and mobility. Light tanks could provide mobile machine gun support for infantry, medium tanks could be used to react and exploit situational advantages, heavy tanks could be used for the main advance.

As tank doctrine developed, the role of tanks started to be defined. Initially based on naval ideas, in late 1916 Captain Giffard Le Quesne Martel (later Major General Sir) proposed a tank army formed of Destroyer tanks, Battle tanks (of Heavy, Medium and Light types), Torpedo tanks (utilising large trench mortars), Engineer tanks, Supply tanks and Ambulance tanks

During the inter-war years, British tank doctrine evolved through experimental trials and the works of J.F.C. Fuller, P.C.S. Hobart and B.H. Liddell-Hart. By 1936, these settled on the roles of light tanks for reconnaissance, infantry tanks to support an advance, and cruiser tanks in the cavalry role, using mobility to exploit situational advantages. The works were further explored by Heinz Guderian in the development of German tank doctrine and Blitzkrieg for the opening stages of World War II.

Other nations continued to use the light, medium and heavy designations. US and Soviet forces also incorporated the tank destroyer concept, allowing their light, medium, and heavy tanks to prioritise works with the infantry. Soviet and US forces added the concept of the flame tank, armed with a flamethrower.

During the course of the war, German forces added command tanks, specialised to the task of co-ordinating tank formations. This idea caught on with other nations. Development of British doctrine added howitzer-armed close support tanks, similar to the older torpedo tank role. These soon became critical to launching smoke, and post-war smoke dischargers became common on tanks. Both command and close support tanks were typically based on the type of tank they were supporting, so may not be considered a completely separate classification.

With the fall of France, the need for infantry tanks to advance with troops started to be replaced with a need for Assault tanks, a new class with heavier frontal armour to take on battlefield defences. Infantry tanks proved capable in this new role however, and the designation was rarely applied outside of experimental production. The term saw limited use with both British and US forces in joint development. Hobart would later return to Martel&#x27;s idea of Engineer tanks in the 1944 run-up to D-Day with Hobarts Funnies, and specialised tanks became a core component of the modern battlefield.

Towards the end of the war, increases in tank engine power started to create the possibility of multi-role vehicles. British light tanks had largely been replaced with armoured cars and carriers, and engineers proposed a new Universal tank coupling Cruiser tank mobility with Infantry tank armour. The concept became redundant when Cruiser tank armour increased anyway, rendering the infantry tank obsolete.

Post-war the light, medium, and heavy designations remained prevalent until the multi-role concept evolved into the main battle tank, rendering the earlier medium and heavy designations obsolete. Heavy tanks were largely withdrawn from service as medium multi-role vehicles offered similar capability with less of the weight-based constraints. Light tanks remained in use for flexibility, such as with air-portable use.

==Size classifications==
Tanks are often referred to by weight-based classifications such as &#x27;light&#x27;, &#x27;medium&#x27; or &#x27;heavy&#x27;, and by extension the role that this size of tank was suitable for. There were many names given to different tank types, and similar names did not assure similar design goals. Some light tanks were relatively slow, and some were fast. Some heavy tanks had large-calibre, low-velocity, anti-infantry bunker-busters, and some had high-velocity anti-tank guns. Furthermore, expected weights for a given tank type vary over time; a medium tank of 1939 could weigh less than a light tank of 1945.

While originally based on weight, the light, medium, and heavy classifications expanded based on tactical use. They now have other meanings than just weight, including relation to gun size, the amount of armour, and, most importantly, tactical role. Post-war in 1948 France, Canada, and the United States agreed to classify tanks as light gun, medium gun, or heavy gun.

After World War II, less expensive armoured cars and more specialised tracked vehicles gradually took over the roles of light tanks.

Heavy tanks were shown to be incapable of keeping up with mobile warfare, but advances in engine, weapon, and armour technology allowed medium tanks to acquire the best characteristics of heavy tanks, allowing them to fulfil multiple roles on the battlefield. The ultimate in mobility, firepower, and protection were rolled into the main battle tank (MBT). In 1957, the Fourth Tripartite Armour Conference recommended to replace medium and heavy tanks with a single class – Main Battle Tanks.

===World War I===
In World War I, the first tank, the British Mark I, was designed for supporting infantry by crossing trenches and attacking machine-gun posts. This became known as a heavy tank alongside other, lighter, types.

A lighter British tank introduced into service in 1918, at and armed with machine guns only was given the designation &quot;Tank, Medium Mark A&quot; and known as the &quot;Whippet&quot;.

The two-man French Renault FT was known as a light tank.

Super-heavy breakthrough tanks such as the Char 2C () or the &quot;K-Wagen&quot; () were nearly completed before the war ended. In comparison, the current British MBT, the Challenger 2, weighs some .

===Interbellum===

British tank designs in the immediate post-World War I era were developments along the same design as the Mark A and were named as Mediums being around . The first tank to enter service that broke with the design was known as the &quot;Vickers Light Tank&quot; (it weighed about ). It was renamed as the Medium Mark I in 1924 as the earlier heavy and medium tanks went out of service and lighter tanks – or less – came into service.

===World War II===

In World War 2, Light, Medium, and Heavy tank applications to different roles were incorporated into doctrine. In the US, light tanks were expected to be used ahead of the main force, medium tanks to accompany the main thrust of attack, and by-their-nature slower heavy tanks being brought up to deal with any more significant opposition. In practice, US heavy tanks saw limited use due to the capacity limits of most dockyard equipment, preventing their delivery to the theatres of operation. This left a role-based classification, the tank destroyer, to evolve from the need to move artillery pieces and set ambushes for axis tanks. A variety of super-heavy tanks were also designed during World War II, although none ever saw combat or construction due to their impracticality.

The British retained some light tanks from the interbellum period, but otherwise moved to a new role based classification scheme.
Other countries started to move to a more role-based approach, for example, by categorizing tanks into cruiser tanks, breakthrough tanks, and fast tanks. The tanks themselves are still often referred to by light, medium and heavy weights based on the actual weight or the equivalent role (for example, a cruiser tank may be light weight but is used in a similar role to a medium). This continued until multi-role vehicles became available.

===Modern===
Light tanks, such as the PT-76, continue to play an important role in tank warfare, however many are being replaced with IFVs and armoured cars. The light tank is still more used than main battle tanks in many armies for various reasons: financial, terrain-related (muddy landscape and dense foliage), or doctrinal dependence on airborne divisions. Many light vehicles, such as the British Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) series (FV101 Scorpion, FV107 Scimitar) are used primarily for reconnaissance, but retain the tank capabilities.

Medium and Heavy tanks were used in the early stages of the cold war, but have gradually been phased out by the multi-role Main Battle Tank. Heavy tanks grew to the point of being logistically problematic, such as the Conqueror and IS-3, while the MBT became capable of filling their battlefield role in a comparatively Medium form-factor. In most cases, the Heavy tanks grew so large that they could not be transported by rail, and could not be supported by common bridges.

==Role classifications==
Many types are also described by their tactical role, which depends on contemporary military doctrine. For instance, &#x27;infantry&#x27; and &#x27;cruiser&#x27; tanks are British classifications of the 1930s and &#x27;40s; &#x27;infantry&#x27;, &#x27;fast&#x27;, and &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; are Soviet types of the same time period.

British and Soviet tacticians up to the time of the Second World War classified tanks into three major roles: infantry, light, and cavalry. Infantry tanks supported infantry units, to integrally support dismounted infantry actions. Light tanks performed the traditional cavalry role of scouting and screening. Cavalry or &quot;cruiser&quot; tank units were meant to exploit breakthroughs and fight other armoured formations.

As role based classifications evolved, the role of light tanks was overtaken by other vehicles, such as carriers and scout cars. The infantry and cruiser tank roles were combined in British use late in the war to form the Universal tank concept. This was made possible as increased engine power provided the capability to sufficiently armour a cruiser tank, the Centurion, to undertake both roles. Centurion entered service just as the war came to an end.

Post-war, tanks were similarly made capable of fulfilling multiple roles on the battlefield, resulting in the designation Main Battle Tank.

===World War I===
Initially on the very first tanks, two types with two roles were provided: the &#x27;males&#x27;, armed with two naval 6-pounder (57 mm) guns and machine guns, and &#x27;females&#x27;, armed with only machine guns that supported the &#x27;males&#x27;.

Later tanks armed with a single gun in one side sponson and machine guns on the other were named &quot;hermaphrodites&quot;.

=== World War II ===
Tank models were developed before and during World War II according to different philosophies, with different combinations of armour, mobility, and armament. Each major nation developed its own doctrine of tank use, and therefore different tank models to suit. New doctrines explored the role of the tank as a fast-striking unit.

Tank doctrine in the UK declared that one group of tanks would accompany infantry in a similar role to World War I, while another group of &#x27;cruiser&#x27; tanks would then exploit a breakthrough, in a role similar to light cavalry. In the USSR, 1930s tank doctrine specified three groups of tanks: one &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; tank in the infantry support role, one tactical breakthrough tank to clear the combat area, and a &#x27;fast tank&#x27; for operational maneuver. In Germany, the ideas of Heinz Guderian established the need for unified tank formations, but with a mixture of armaments for differing roles.

In the United States, doctrine evolved so that the main purpose of the tank was to provide infantry support and exploitation of breakthroughs. The antitank role was given to tank destroyers. There was no analog to the cruiser tank in pre-war US doctrine. There were those within the US Army which advocated a more modern force with tanks in the cavalry role, but their suggestions were not put into place by the time of the US&#x27;s entry into World War II.

====Infantry tank====
The idea for this tank was developed during World War I by the British and French. The infantry tank was designed to work in concert with infantry in the assault, moving mostly at a walking pace, which required it to carry heavy armour to survive defensive fire. Its main purpose would have been to clear the battlefield of obstacles, suppress or destroy defenders, and protect the infantry on their advance into and through enemy lines by giving mobile overwatch and cover.

The British came back to the concept in the pre-Second World War era. The infantry tank did not need to be fast so it could carry more armour. One of the best-known infantry tanks was the Matilda II of World War II.

====Cruiser tank====
A cruiser tank, or cavalry tank, was designed to move fast and exploit penetrations of the enemy front. The idea originated in &quot;Plan 1919&quot;, a British plan to break the trench deadlock of World War I in part via the use of high-speed tanks. This concept was later implemented in the &quot;fast tanks&quot; pioneered by J. Walter Christie.

They were used by the United Kingdom during World War II. Cruiser tanks were designed to complement infantry tanks, exploiting gains made by the latter to attack and disrupt the enemy rear areas. In order to give them the required speed, cruiser designs sacrificed armour compared to the infantry tanks.

The Soviet fast tank (&quot;bistrokhodniy tank&quot;, or BT tank) classification also came out of the infantry/cavalry concept of armoured warfare and formed the basis for the British cruisers after 1936. The T-34 was a development of this line of tanks as well, though their armament, armour, and all-round capability places them firmly in the medium tank category.

==== Flame tank ====

A flame tank is a tank equipped with a flamethrower, most commonly used to supplement combined arms attacks against fortifications, confined spaces, or other obstacles. The type only reached significant use in the Second World War, during which the United States, Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom (including members of the British Commonwealth) all produced flamethrower-equipped tanks.

A number of production methods were used. The flamethrowers used were either modified versions of existing infantry flame weapons (Flammpanzer I and II) or specially designed (Flammpanzer III). They were mounted externally (Flammpanzer II), replaced existing machine gun mounts, or replaced the tank&#x27;s main armament (Flammpanzer III). Fuel for the flame weapon was either carried inside the tank, in armoured external storage, or in some cases in a special trailer behind the tank (Churchill Crocodile).

Flame tanks have been superseded by thermobaric weapons such as the Russian TOS-1.

===Modern===

====Main battle tank====

Advances in tank design, armour, and engine technology allowed tank designers to increase the capabilities of tanks significantly, allowing vehicles to undertake multiple roles on the battlefield. This could be accomplished without always resorting to heavier designs, although weights did gradually increase. High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunition was a threat to tanks and could penetrate steel armour thicker than was practical to put on a tank. Advances such as the British-designed Chobham armour limit the effectiveness of weaker HEAT rounds, but the vulnerability still remained.

On 7 November 1950, the US Ordnance Committee Minutes (OCM), order #33476, ceased utilizing the terms heavy, medium, and light tanks and redesignated tanks by the gun system, e.g. &quot;90 mm Gun Tank M48 Patton&quot;, etc. with heavy gun tanks (), medium gun tanks (), and light gun tanks (), although these gun terms were often still shortened to simply heavy, medium, and light tanks.

The term &quot;main battle tank&quot; (MBT), in the US, was first generally applied in 1960 to an all-purpose tank, armed and protected as a heavy tank, but with the mobility of the medium tank (the introduction of M60). The MBT would form the backbone of modern ground forces.
Many Cold War MBTs evolved more or less directly from late World War II medium tank designs. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, a generation of purpose-designed main battle tanks appeared, starting with the British Chieftain tank. These vehicles are less obviously influenced by wartime templates (the Chieftain, for example), weighing as much as a World War II heavy tank and possessing far greater firepower and armour, while retaining the mobility of the previous Centurion design. Similarly, the US M1 Abrams series, the German Leopard 2, the British Challenger 1, French Leclerc and Russian T-90 tanks are all main battle tanks. The defining feature of the main battle tank type is neither its weight, mobility, nor firepower, but instead the idea that only one type of tracked armoured vehicle is required to carry out the roles of breakthrough, exploitation and infantry support.

== Specialist tank ==

Tanks have often been modified for special purposes. The most common is armoured recovery vehicles, used during combat for recovery or repair of battle-damaged and inoperable armoured fighting vehicles. Another common use is to provide armoured capability for combat engineers. These include tanks carrying large-calibre demolition guns, with flails or ploughs for mine-clearing, or flame tanks armed with flamethrowers. The tank occasionally may lose its weapons and the chassis alone may be used, as in bridge-laying tanks.

Another important modification was the amphibious tank. These designs were modified with waterproofing and propulsion systems, to be able to traverse open water.

Many specialist tank roles have been assigned to other vehicle types, though many tank chassis are still used for a wide variety of vehicles, ranging from anti-aircraft roles to bridge layers and firefighting tanks.

Unmodified tanks can be fitted with equipment, such as mine-clearing ploughs, to give them ancillary roles.

Hobart&#x27;s Funnies were a group of various specialist tanks used in World War II, named after Major General Percy Hobart.

==Tank generations==
Tanks are sometimes classified as belonging to a particular generation, although the actual definition and membership in these generations is not clearly defined. Soviet and Russian military planners organise tanks into a generation of tanks up to 1945, and four generations of main battle tanks, while Canadian strategists organise main battle tanks into three generations. The military of the People&#x27;s Republic of China also recognises three generations of its own tanks.

Netgear&#x27;s focus is primarily on the networking market, with products for home and business use, as well as pro-gaming, including wired and wireless technology.
Netgear also has a wide range of Wifi Range Extenders

=== ProSAFE switches ===
Netgear markets network products for the business sector, most notably the ProSAFE switch range. {{As of|2007|alt=As of May 2007}}, Netgear provides limited lifetime warranties for ProSAFE products for as long as the original buyer owns the product. Currently focusing on multimedia segment and business product.

=== Network appliances ===
Netgear also markets network appliances for the business sector, including managed switches and wired and wireless VPN firewalls. In 2016, Netgear released its Orbi mesh Wi-Fi system, with models for business as well as household use. The system uses a tri-band architecture, similar to the traditional dual-band, but with a dedicated 5 GHz connection between the router and a provided satellite. The addition of a second 5 GHz channel allows the network to distribute its traffic, easing congestion caused by the increasing number of 5 GHz compatible wireless devices present in many household networks. In September 2017, Netgear exited the VPN firewall product category. At CES 2021, the company unveiled the world&#x27;s first WiFi 6E router that takes advantage of the 6 GHz frequency band in addition to the 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz bands. The 6 GHz frequency increases network capacity where there is high utilization of the 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz bands.

=== {{Anchor|READYNAS|READYDATA}}Network-attached storage ===

Netgear sells NAS devices to small businesses and consumers under the product name ReadyNAS. With this storage hardware line, Netgear vies with competitors like Buffalo, Zyxel and HP. Netgear entered the storage market in May 2007 when it acquired Infrant (originator of the ReadyNAS line). In March 2009, Netgear began to offer an integrated online backup solution called the ReadyNAS Vault. In June 2022 all ReadyNAS product pages was removed and replaced with a link to warranty and support information. Netgear has not yet (August 2022) confirmed that they have withdrawn from the network connected storage market and discontinued the ReadyNAS product line.

=== Network surveillance cameras ===
{{main article|Arlo Technologies}}
Netgear created home surveillance camera brand Arlo, which was spun out into a separate company in August 2018. Arlo is now publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

=== Netgear chipsets ===
Netgear uses Realtek chipsets which can run in monitor mode and perform wireless injection. For this function, a special driver is needed.

== Manufacturing ==
NETGEAR’s primary manufacturers are Cloud Network Technology (more commonly known as Hon Hai Precision or Foxconn Corporation), Delta Electronics Incorporated, Senao Networks, Inc., and Pegatron Corporation, all of which are headquartered in Taiwan. They distribute their manufacturing among a limited number of key suppliers and seek to avoid excessive concentration with any one single supplier.

Manufacturing occurs primarily in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and Taiwan.

To maintain quality standards, Netgear has established its own product quality organization, based in Singapore and Taiwan, that is responsible for auditing and inspecting process and product quality on the premises of ODMs and JDMs (Joint Development Manufacturers).

Netgear was unaffected by US President Donald Trump&#x27;s 25% tariffs on Chinese imports. Because all manufacturing is outsourced, the company was able to shift its production lines from China to Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.

== Product security concerns ==
In 2014, various Netgear products that were manufactured by SerComm were found to contain a backdoor that allowed unauthorized remote access to the affected devices. Netgear, along with other companies with products manufactured by SerComm that were affected by the aforementioned backdoor, issued firmware updates for some affected products. However, it was shortly found that the updates merely hid the backdoor but did not remove it.

A backdoor also existed on the DG834 series. Any person who can access the router using a web browser, can enable &quot;debug&quot; mode using {{code|code=[IP_ADDR]/setup.cgi?todo=debug}} and then connect via Telnet directly to the router&#x27;s embedded Linux system as &#x27;root&#x27;, which gives unfettered access to the router&#x27;s operating system via its Busybox functionality.

In January 2017, various Netgear products were found to be vulnerable to an exploit that allows third-party access to the router and the internal network and to turn the router into a botnet.

This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can access the internal network or when remote management is enabled on the router. Remote management is turned off by default; users can turn on remote management through advanced settings. Firmware fixes are currently available for the affected devices.

In 2020, a vulnerability was discovered that affected many Netgear home WiFi routers. The problem was in a web server built into the router&#x27;s firmware. When launching the administration interface, the owner had to enter their password, which was not protected by security. The exploit was posted on GitHub. Netgear issued a security advisory and firmware update to address the issue.

<doc id="1197295" wikidata="Q1418174" url="?curid=1197295" title="Sone River">
<text>Sone River, also spelt Son River, is a perennial river located in central India. It originates near Amarkantak Hill in Pendra (Gaurela-Pendra-Marwahi district), Chhattisgarh and finally merges with the Ganges river near Maner in Patna, Bihar. The Sone River is the second-largest southern tributary of the Ganges after the Yamuna River. India&#x27;s oldest river bridge Koilwar Bridge over Sone River connects Arrah with Patna. Sone river is famous for its sand across country. Multiple dams and hydro-electric projects run on its course towards the Ganges.

==Course==
Sone River is called &#x27;सोन / सोने&#x27; in Hindi, but called &#x27;शोण&#x27; in Sanskrit, a rare instance of an Indian river having masculine name. Damodara and Brahmaputra also have masculine name. This river is mentioned as SoNai in Sangam Tamil literature Kuṟuntokai as early as 2nd century CE. The Sone originates near Pendra in Chhattisgarh, just east of the headwater of the Narmada River, and flows north-northwest through Shahdol district in Madhya Pradesh state before turning sharply eastward where it encounters the southwest-northeast-Kaimur Range. The Sone parallels the Kaimur hills, flowing east-northeast through Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar states to join the Ganges just west of Patna. Geologically, the lower valley of the Son is an extension of the Narmada Valley, and the Kaimur Range an extension of the Vindhya Range. Arwal, Daudnagar, Deori, Rohtasgarh, Dehri, Sonbhadra and Maner are some of the major cities situated on Sone River.

The Sone river which is long, is one of the longest Indian rivers. Its chief tributaries are the Rihand, Kanhar and the North Koel. The Son has a steep gradient (35–55 cm per km) with quick run-off and ephemeral regimes, becoming a roaring river with the rain-waters in the catchment area but turning quickly into a fordable stream. The Son, being wide and shallow, leaves disconnected pools of water in the remaining parts of the year. The channel of the Son is very wide (about 5 km at Dehri) but the floodplain is narrow, only wide. The meeting point with North Koel the width of Sone River is . In the past, the Son has been notorious for changing course. As it is traceable from several old beds near its east bank, the river changed its course more than 5 times. In modern times this tendency has been checked with the anicut at Dehri, and now more so with the Indrapuri Barrage.

In Bihar, this river forms the border line between the Bhojpuri- and Magahi-speaking regions.

Sir John Houlton, the British administrator, described the Son as follows, &quot;After passing the steep escarpments of the Kaimur range, it flows straight across the plain to the Ganges. For much of this distance it is over two miles wide, and at one point, opposite Tilothu three miles wide. In the dry weather there is a vast expanse of sand, with a stream not more than a hundred yards wide, and the hot west winds pile up the sand on the east bank, making natural embankments. After heavy rain in the hills even this wide bed cannot carry the waters of the Son and disastrous floods in Shahabad, Gaya, and Patna are not uncommon.&quot;

==Dams==
The first dam on the Son was built in 1873–74 at Dehri.

The Indrapuri Barrage was constructed, upstream, and commissioned in 1968.

The Bansagar Dam in Madhya Pradesh was commissioned in 2008.

==Bridges==

The 1.44 Km long rail-cum-road lattice-girder concrete and steel Abdul Bari Bridge or Koilwar Bridge near Arrah in Bihar was completed in November 1862. It remained the longest bridge in India, until the Nehru Setu bridge at Dehri was opened in 1900. After Nehru Setu bridge at Dehri, Railway Bridges are present on Sone River near Chopan, Vijay Sota &amp; Anuppur.

The modern Son bridge built in Deolond, Shahdol district of Madhya Pradesh was inaugurated by Motilal Vora and Pandit Ram Kishore Shukla then Chief Minister and Finance Minister of Madhya Pradesh on 13 February 1986.

The Government of Bihar sanctioned in 2008 a bridge across the Son River connecting Arwal and Sahar in Bhojpur district.

New Koilwar Bridge: A 6-lane road bridge, carrying NH-922, parallel to the existing rail and road Koilwar Bridge.

<text>Zuzana Licko (born Zuzana Ličko, 1961) is a Slovak-born American type designer and visual artist known for co-founding Emigre Fonts, a digital type foundry in Berkeley, CA. She has designed and produced numerous digital typefaces including the popular Mrs Eaves, Modula, Filosofia, and Matrix. As a corresponding interest she also creates ceramic sculptures and jacquard weavings.

==Early life==
Licko was born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia and came to the United States with her family as a child. She studied architecture, photography, and computer programming before earning a degree in graphic communications at the University of California at Berkeley.

Licko was introduced to computers by her father, a biomathematician at the University of California, San Francisco. She would help him with data processing during her summer breaks. The first font she created on a computer was a Greek alphabet, adapted for the pen plotter, which her father used on his graph printouts.

When she started her university education, her goal was to earn a degree in architecture, but she changed to a visual studies major when she discovered her passion after taking graphic design and typography classes. While at Berkeley, Licko took a calligraphy class, but struggled with it, because she was forced to write with her right hand even though she is left-handed. This experience influenced her rejection of many traditional type design practices as she started exploring the capabilities of the Macintosh computer.

In an interview featured in &quot;Eye&quot;, Licko described her creative relationship with her husband Rudy VanderLans:

==Emigre==
In 1985, Licko and VanderLans started Emigre Graphics which had grown out of Emigre magazine, a publication co-founded by VanderLans and two Dutch friends the previous year. VanderLans also started incorporating the bitmap typefaces that Licko designed on the Apple Macintosh in his layouts with issue # 2. Licko&#x27;s experimental type designs became a prominent feature of the magazine for its entire run. Licko began selling commercial licenses of its digital fonts to users worldwide, first under the name Emigre Graphics and later as Emigre Fonts.

Emigre magazine prominently featured Licko&#x27;s fonts, some of which were initially created for use in the publication. The magazine is an unintentional archive of Licko&#x27;s work and progression as a type designer. From her pixelated fonts optimized for bitmap printing to her sophisticated vector designs, Licko&#x27;s technique advanced with technology. In &quot;Emigre: Graphic Design into the Digital Realm&quot;, Licko discusses her necessary departure from classic type forms in her early fonts. I started my venture with bitmap type designs, created for the coarse resolutions of the computer screen and dot matrix printer. The challenge was that because the early computers were so limited in what they could do you really had to design something special. Even if it was difficult to adapt calligraphy to lead and later lead to photo technology, it could be done, but it was physically impossible to adapt 8-point Goudy Old Style to 72 dots to the inch. In the end you couldn&#x27;t tell Goudy Old Style from Times Roman or any other serif text face.Licko has designed at least three dozen font families. In the mid-1990s, she worked on two notable revivals: Mrs Eaves (based on Baskerville) and Filosofia (based on Bodoni). Updating these historical models for use both in print and on-screen, Licko included extensive ligatures with each typeface.

Emigre is not just for fonts. In recent years, Licko has turned her attention to creating ceramics and textiles under the same moniker. In a 2017 interview with Zuzana Kvetkova, Licko shares about her love of ceramics and her process:I’ve always enjoyed creating ceramic objects, and I need this to balance out the ephemeral nature of digital work. I find that my current work on modular ceramic sculptures and fabric prints is actually an extension of type design. I’m using font software to create sketches for my ceramic sculptures, which exist of repeating elements. Each sculpture has a variety of shapes that can be combined to make different sculptures. The font software helps me go through the possible variations. The elements for the textile designs are also created as fonts, which I configure into various patterns. Perhaps my focusing on a physical medium is a reaction against everything being consumed digitally these days.

<doc id="1197299" wikidata="Q3294748" url="?curid=1197299" title="British Rail brand names">
<text>British Rail was the brand image of the nationalised railway owner and operator in Great Britain, the British Railways Board, used from 1965 until its breakup and sell-off from 1993 onwards.

From an initial standardised corporate image, several sub-brands emerged for marketing purposes and later in preparation for privatisation. These brands covered rail networks, customers services and several classes of new trains.

With the size of British Rail&#x27;s fleet, due to the time required to repaint rolling stock, brand switchovers could be lengthy affairs, often lasting years. This worsened into privatisation, with the same services using trains using three or four different liveries.

Following privatisation, most of the brand names disappeared, although some such as ScotRail, Merseyrail, Eurostar and Freightliner still exist today.

The double-arrow symbol, which was the symbol of British Rail from 1965, still remains after privatisation as a unifying branding device used by the privatised National Rail network. It is shown on most tickets, stations, timetables, publicity and road signs indicating stations, but not trains. It is, however, set to be used more generally once again by Great British Railways.

==Timeline of brands==
Under the Transport Act 1962, responsibility for the state railway operation, British Railways, was transferred from being a trade name and subsidiary of the British Transport Commission, to a separate public corporation, under the British Railways Board. 

As the last steam locomotives were being withdrawn by 1968, under the 1955 Modernisation Plan, the corporation&#x27;s public name was rebranded in 1965 as &quot;British Rail&quot;, which introduced the double-arrow symbol, a standard typeface named Rail Alphabet and the BR blue livery, which was applied to nearly all locomotives and rolling stock.

The first major BR sub-brand to appear was &quot;InterCity&quot;. This was augmented with the &quot;InterCity 125&quot; brand in 1976, in conjunction with the introduction of the InterCity 125 High Speed Train.

In the 1980s under sectorisation, blue livery was phased out as the organisation converted from a regional structure to being sector-based. The InterCity brand was relaunched and passenger brands Network SouthEast and Regional Railways introduced; these divisions introduced many sub-brands. Freight operations were split into the Trainload Freight, Railfreight Distribution and Rail Express Systems sectors.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, new multiple-unit train designs being introduced to replace rolling stock also brought new brand names; these were often linked to other branding exercises, such as the &quot;Networker&quot; which was built for Network SouthEast.

In the 1990s, BR created the European Passenger Services division to run passenger services through the Channel Tunnel, under the &quot;Eurostar&quot; brand. After construction delays, this was operated from 1994, until it passed to the London and Continental Railways consortium in 1996 as Eurostar.

In preparation for privatisation, the freight sectors were further split into smaller business functions; these were as regional splits of Trainload Freight or further splits along customer market, such as inter-modal traffic, each with their own branding. With almost all freight businesses going straight to EWS, most of these brands were short lived.

==List of brands==

===Networks===
* Island Line - passenger services on the Isle of Wight (Ryde - Shanklin) from 1989. Part of Network SouthEast
* Merseyrail - a passenger service brand for Merseyside
* Network NorthWest - passenger service brand paralleling Network SouthEast for Greater Manchester and Lancashire, introduced in 1989 as part of Regional Railways. After a few years, it was replaced by the Regional Railways branding
* Network SouthEast (originally &quot;London &amp; South Eastern&quot;) - commuter and medium-distance trains operating in an area bounded roughly by King&#x27;s Lynn, Peterborough, Worcester, Bedwyn, Exeter and Weymouth and included the Waterloo &amp; City line, which is now part of the London Underground

<doc id="1197304" wikidata="Q568245" url="?curid=1197304" title="John Dykstra">
<text>John Charles Dykstra, A.S.C. (; born June 3, 1947) is an American special effects artist, pioneer in the development of the use of computers in filmmaking and recipient of three Academy Awards, among many other awards and prizes. He was one of the original employees of Industrial Light &amp; Magic, the special effects and computer graphics division of Lucasfilm. He is well known as the special effects lead on the original &quot;Star Wars&quot;, helping bring the original visuals for lightsabers, space battles between X-wings and TIE fighters, and Force powers to the screen. He also led special effects on many other movies, including &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, &quot;Stuart Little&quot;, &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;.

==Education and early career==
Dykstra was born in Long Beach, California. After studying industrial design at California State University, Long Beach (where he was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity), in 1971 he landed a job working with Douglas Trumbull on &quot;Silent Running&quot; filming model effects, when Trumbull hired recent college graduates due to the film&#x27;s low budget.

==&quot;Star Wars&quot;==
In 1975, when George Lucas was recruiting people for the special effects work on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, he approached Douglas Trumbull, but he was unavailable as he was about to start working on Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. Trumbull pointed Lucas towards Dykstra. Lucas formed his own special effects company, Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), based in warehouse premises in Van Nuys, and appointed Dykstra to supervise the new team. This led to the development of the Dykstraflex motion-controlled camera, which enabled many of the film&#x27;s groundbreaking effects to be produced. The system was made possible by the availability of off-the-shelf integrated-circuit RAM at relatively low cost and secondhand VistaVision cameras.

However, tensions arose between Dykstra and Lucas, the latter complaining that too much time and money was spent on developing the digital camera systems and that the effects team did not deliver all the shots that he had wanted causing the production to run behind schedule. These tensions would reportedly culminate with Dykstra&#x27;s dismissal from ILM following Lucas&#x27; return from principal photography in London. Regardless, following the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Dykstra and his team won Academy Awards for best special effects and special technical achievement.

==&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;==
After &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Dykstra began working on &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; for Universal Studios. Supervising the special effects for the three-hour pilot episode (which was also released theatrically), Dykstra formed his own effects company called Apogee, Inc. which included several ILM employees who had worked on &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Dykstra was also given a Producer credit for the pilot of the television series. As Universal then opted to make &quot;Galactica&quot; into a weekly series, many of Dykstra&#x27;s effects shots were recycled and used repeatedly throughout the show&#x27;s single season run.

After &quot;Galactica&quot; aired, Lucas and 20th Century Fox began legal proceedings against Universal claiming that they had plagiarized &quot;Star Wars&quot;, a matter not helped by the similar effects and design styles (artist Ralph McQuarrie had also contributed to &quot;Galactica&quot;). Lucas was also reportedly unhappy about Dykstra using the equipment (that had been developed and paid for from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; budget) on a production that was essentially a competitor. When Lucas relocated ILM to San Francisco from Van Nuys to commence work on &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, several members of the Apogee team (including Richard Edlund and Dennis Muren) would return to ILM but Dykstra did not join them. He continued to work under his Apogee brand name and subsequently went to work on the effects for &quot;Avalanche Express&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (on which he was reunited with Douglas Trumbull).

==&quot;Firefox&quot; and the 1980s==
Dykstra&#x27;s next major achievement was the effects work on &quot;Firefox&quot; in 1982. Here, he took on the same challenge that Lucas had set with &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; of combining miniature effects with actual backgrounds and matte work on white backgrounds using reverse bluescreen. The film secured further awards but was only a modest box office hit.

In 1985, Dykstra produced the special effects for the sci-fi horror film &quot;Lifeforce&quot; which was made in England. He followed with work on the 1986 remake of &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; and &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; (1988). Apogee Inc also did the effects for the spoof comedy &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987).

In the late 1980s Dykstra was asked by Nissan Motor Company of Japan to work on special effects for a commercial for the introduction of the Nissan R32 Skyline. He stated in an interview that ran before the commercial that he got out his &quot;Special Effects Atlas&quot; to provide a world that &quot;not only looked different&quot; but also had some &quot;very unusual inhabitants&quot;: the &quot;Space Fish&quot;. The Space Fish can be seen following and then examining the new Skyline during the ad.

==Comic book films==
In the mid-1990s, Dykstra was supervisor for the special effects of &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. He was also Senior Visual Effects Supervisor for &quot;Stuart Little&quot;. Dykstra was the visual effects designer on the first two &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films, and received an Oscar for Best Visual Effects for his work on &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. He acted as the visual effects designer on &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, ensuring the six effects companies involved delivered all the shots required despite the tight schedule.

==Video games==

In 1987, Dykstra directed the full-motion video game &quot;Sewer Shark&quot;, originally intended for Hasbro&#x27;s VHS-based NEMO console. When Hasbro abandoned the project, the system&#x27;s creator Tom Zito acquired the rights to the game. In 1992, &quot;Sewer Shark&quot; was converted to the Sega CD by Zito&#x27;s Digital Pictures, and released as a launch title for the system.

<doc id="1197311" wikidata="Q1834082" url="?curid=1197311" title="List of mountains in Pakistan">
<text>Pakistan is home to 108 peaks above 7,000 metres and 4555 above 6,000 m. There is no count of the peaks above 5,000 and 4,000 m. Five of the 14 highest independent peaks in the world (the eight-thousanders) are in Pakistan (four of which lie in the surroundings of Concordia; the confluence of Baltoro Glacier and Godwin Austen Glacier). Most of the highest peaks in Pakistan lie in the Karakoram mountain range (which lies almost entirely in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan, and is considered to be a separate range from Himalayan range) but some peaks above 7,000 m are included in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges. Moreover, Pakistan is home to over 7,000 glaciers, more than anywhere except the polar regions.

==Considerations==

The list is an incomplete list of mountains in Pakistan. There are many named and unnamed peaks in Pakistan that are currently not included in this list. The list also includes many peaks that are not usually classed as independent mountains, but instead are considered sub-peaks of other mountains, due to having low topographic prominence (the height of a peak above the highest saddle connecting it to a higher summit). Also, many of the elevations listed are approximate, due to imprecise and inconsistent surveys. The ranks in the peaks above are derived from the list of highest mountains.

The dividing line between a mountain with multiple peaks and separate mountains is not always clear (see Highest unclimbed mountain). A common threshold is to define a mountain as a summit with 300 m prominence (1,000 ft; also 10 traditional rope lengths). Alternatively, a relative prominence (prominence or height) is used (usually 7–8%) to reflect that in higher mountain ranges everything is on a larger scale. The list of highest mountains ranks the highest 100 summits with at least 500 m prominence, approximating a 7% relative prominence. A drawback of a prominence-based list is that it may exclude peaks commonly thought of as mountains that are connected via a high ridge to a taller summit. Many such peaks and mountains with less than sufficient prominence are included but not numbered in the list.

It is very unlikely that all the heights given are correct to the nearest meter; indeed, problems of definition of sea level can arise when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many meters, and many mountains in the Karakorum differ by over 100 metres on different maps. These discrepancies serve to emphasise the uncertainties in the listed heights.

==Geographical distribution==

Most of the highest mountains in Pakistan are located in the Karakoram range, some high mountains are in Himalaya (the highest of which is Nanga Parbat, globally ranked 9th, 8126 m) and Hindu Kush (the highest of which is Tirich Mir, globally ranked 33rd, 7708 m).

The locations of the highest mountains are shown on the composite satellite image of Karakoram and Hindu Kush below. The numbers refer to the global ranking in this &quot;List of highest mountains&quot;. For clarity, lower peaks with labels overlapping higher peaks are left out of the main image.

Most of the high peaks in Pakistan lie specifically in Gilgit–Baltistan with the exception of a few 7,000+ m peaks in the high Hindu Kush (the peaks marked in the northwest most region of Pakistan).

The peak marked as number 9 is Nanga Parbat (8,125 m), which is the 2nd highest Himalayan peak in Pakistan. All other peaks above 8,000m are in the Baltoro Muztagh subrange of Karakoram.

<doc id="1197312" wikidata="Q233627" url="?curid=1197312" title="Lake Manasarovar">
<text>Lake Manasarovar (), also called Mapam Yumtso (; ) locally, is a high altitude freshwater lake near Mount Kailash in Burang County, Ngari Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region, China. It is located at an elevation of , near the western trijunction between China, India and Nepal. It overflows into the adjacent salt-water lake of Rakshastal via the Ganga Chhu. The sources of four rivers: Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra, and Karnali lie in the vicinity of the region.

The lake is sacred in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon religion. People from India, China, Nepal and other countries in the region undertake a pilgrimage to the region. The pilgrimage generally involves trekking towards Lake Manasarovar and a circumambulation of the nearby Mount Kailash.

== Etymology ==
The Sanskrit word &quot;Manasarovar&quot; (मानसरोवर) is a combination of two Sanskrit words, &quot;Mānas&quot; (मानस्) meaning &quot;mind&quot; (generally denotes the mental powers associated including intellect, perception, conscience) and &quot;sarovar&quot; (सरोवर) meaning &quot;lake or a large pond&quot;. The lake is called as &quot;Mapam Yumtso&quot; (; ) and &quot;Tso Madröpa&quot; locally. In his Tibetan-English dictionary, Sarat Chandra Das states that &quot;Mapam Yumtso&quot; is derived from &quot;Mapam&quot; meaning unconquerable or invincible and &quot;Tso Madröpa&quot; is derived from &quot;Madropa&quot; meaning &quot;ground heated by the Sun&quot; both used in combination with &quot;Tso&quot;, the Tibetan word for lake.

== Geography ==
Lake Manasarovar is located in Ngari Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region of China. It is located in the southwest region of Tibet north of the western tripoint of the border between China, India and Nepal. It is visible from the Lapcha La pass above the Limi valley in Nepal on a clear day. The freshwater lake lies at above mean sea level on the mostly saline lake-studded Tibetan Plateau and is one of the highest freshwater lakes in Asia.

Spread over a surface area of , Lake Manasarovar is relatively round in shape with a circumference of and a maximum depth of . Manasarovar overflows into the salt-water endorheic lake of Rakshastal via the natural Ganga Chhu channel. The major rivers rising from the region include Yarlung Tsangpo (which becomes the Brahmaputra), the Indus, the Sutlej and the Karnali, a tributary of Ganges.

== Climate ==
The weather is fairly dry during April to June with day time temperatures of more than and night time temperatures close to . The temperature starts to decrease in October with January being the coldest. Winters have day time temperatures below freezing with colder nights. Monsoons bring rain from late June to August with cold winds.

Global warming is described as happening more rapidly on the Tibetan Plateau than anywhere else in the world. According to locals, the land around the region has been growing warmer in recent years with winters not as cold as it used to be. The retreating glaciers and thawing of the permafrost in the Tibet region might lead to uncertain effects on water resources of the region. These effects along with population explosion and tourism has put severe stress on the fragile ecosystem.

== Religious significance ==

=== Hinduism ===

In Hindu literature, Mansarovar is mentioned by name in the Hindu epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Though modern texts state the lake to be among the most sacred sites of Hinduism, there is no explicit mention of the lake in early Vedic literature. The &quot;Rigveda&quot; mentions that the Indus River flows north because of Indra, a geographical reality only in the Tibet region. According to Frits Staal, this makes it likely that some of the ancient Vedic people traced the route of the Indus river and had seen the valley near Mount Kailash. 

The early Hindu texts mention a mythical Mount Meru and lake Manasa. The mythical Manasa lake is described as one created through the mind of Brahma as the preferred abode of his vahana hamsa. In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Vishvamitra tells Rama that Brahma created a lake out of his consciousness (Manas), hence the name Manas Sarovar (lake of consciousness) and a river was born out of that lake called Sarayu, which flowed through the kingdom of Ayodhya.

Mount Kailash on the banks of Lake Manasarovar is believed to be the abode of Shiva. This is where the holy river Ganges was tamed by Shiva and sent to nourish the fertile valleys below the Himalayas.

=== Buddhism and Bon ===
Lake Manasarovar and Mount Kailash are central to Buddhist cosmology, and a major pilgrimage site for some Buddhist traditions. Kailash is known as the mythological Mount Meru. In Buddhism, Kailash represents the father of the world and Lake Mansarovar symbolizes the mother. According to mythology, Maya bathed at Manasarovar to purify herself before Buddha could enter her womb. Numerous sites in the region are associated with Padmasambhava, who is credited with establishing Tantric Buddhism in Tibet in the 8th century CE. Vajrayana Buddhists believe that saint Milarepa () had a challenge with Naro Böncham, a follower of Bön religion on the banks of Manasarovar.

For the Bon people, the region was the centre of the ancient Bon empire of Zhang Zhung and is associated with the holy place of Zhang Zhung Meri deity. As per Tibetan beliefs, the region was the source of the mythical Lion, Horse, Peacock, and Elephant Rivers. When Tonpa Shenrab, the founder of the Bon religion, visited Tibet for the first time and bathed in the lake.

=== Jainism ===
In Jainism, Lake Manasarovar is associated with its founder and the first Tirthankara, Rishabhanatha. As per Jain scriptures, he attained nirvana on the Ashtapad Mountain. It is believed by Jains that after Rishabhanatha attained nirvana, his son emperor Bharata had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 tirthankaras in the region. There are other stories related to the region relating to Mahavira, Kumar and Sagar, Tapas Kher Parna, Ravana and Mandodari, among many others.

== Pilgrimage ==
The lake has been mentioned in various Hindu and Buddhist religious literature. It was part of one of the oldest pilgrimage routes, which has been in existence for many years. Though modern texts state the lake to be among the most sacred sites of various religions, there is no explicit mention of the lake being a pilgrimage site in early literature. Typically, historic pilgrimage sites that were frequented by Buddhists, Hindus and Jains attracted discussion in their respective texts and the construction of infrastructure by wealthy patrons or kings. The Hindu &quot;Puranas&quot; indicate various infrastructure, such as temples, dharmasalas, ashrams, and pilgrimage facilities at such sites. But at least until the 1930s, there was no evidence of such structures in the Kailash-Manasarovar region. According to Luciano Petech, Tibetan records indicate that the region was considered to be their sacred geography by the late 12th-century, with reports of Buddhist monks meditating in the Go-zul cave of Kailash and circumambulating the mountain. According to Alex McKay, the possible synthesis of esoteric Buddhism and Shaivism may have expanded and brought Kailash and Manasarovar into the shared sacred geography for both Buddhists and Hindus. The 13th-century text &quot;Mahanirvana Tantra&quot; dedicates it first chapter to Kailash and Manasarovar lake as a pilgrimage site.

Due to its perceived sacredness to various religions, people undertake a pilgrimage called &quot;yatra&quot; to the Kailash-Manasarovar. Pilgrimage to the mountain increased in the 1930s but was affected later due to both China and the British Empire claiming the region. Religious pilgrimages to Mount Kailas and Manasarovar were permitted by China after its occupation of Tibet in 1950-51. While pilgrimage from India was guaranteed by the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement, access was restricted after the subsequent 1959 Tibetan uprising, and the borders were closed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962. After nearly two decades, pilgrimage from India was allowed in 1981 after an agreement between the governments of India and China. The pilgrimage was suspended for three years since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The route was re-opened in 2023 with new regulations. Since the reopening of the pilgrimage route from India in 1981, the numbers of pilgrims going on the annual yatra has grown considerably. Before the closure in 2020, several thousand pilgrims from India were going to this pilgrimage every year.

In India, the pilgrimage is organized by the Government of India and is permitted between June and September. Since 2015, aspiring pilgrims from India were required to apply in advance to the Ministry of External Affairs and specific number of passes were issued to pilgrims by computerized random selection with preference given to first timers. Pilgrims from India travel through two routes opened for the purpose, with border crossings at Lipu Lekh pass in Uttarakhand and the Nathu La pass in Sikkim. Since 2020, a motorable road is available till the Lipu Lekh pass through the Indian side of the Mahakali valley, before crossing over to China. The Nathu La route was opened in 2015 and involves traveling to Gangtok before crossing the Nathu La pass into China.

As the April 2015 Nepal Earthquake resulted in the closure of the border crossing at Tatopani-Zangmu, the pilgrimage from Nepal is generally done from the nearby Humla district in northwestern Nepal. Another route exists through the crossing at Rasuwa-Gyirong. Pilgrims could reach Lhasa by air before the journey to Lake Manasarovar.

The pilgrimage involves trekking towards Lake Mansarovar and a circumambulation of Mount Kailash. The path around Mount Kailash is long. The circumambulation known as &quot;kora&quot;, is made in a clockwise direction by Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains, while Bönpos circumambulate the mountain in a counterclockwise direction. Pilgrims believe that bathing in the lake and circling the mountain is a spiritually beneficial practice that can bring various positive effects, such as the cleansing of one&#x27;s sins. For the Khas people of the nearby region of Humla in northwest Nepal, a ritual bath in the lake is an important step in gaining their shamanic powers. There are many stupas, flag poles, Buddhist monasteries and praying stations on the banks of the lake, many of which were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution of China from 1966 to 1976.

<text>From the mid-1980s to September 2003, the inflation-adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on NYMEX was generally under US$25/barrel in 2008 dollars. During 2003, the price rose above $30, reached $60 by 11 August 2005, and peaked at $147.30 in July 2008. Commentators attributed these price increases to multiple factors, including Middle East tension, soaring demand from China, the falling value of the U.S. dollar, reports showing a decline in petroleum reserves, worries over peak oil, and financial speculation.

For a time, geopolitical events and natural disasters had strong short-term effects on oil prices, such as North Korean missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, worries over Iranian nuclear plans in 2006, Hurricane Katrina, and various other factors. By 2008, such pressures appeared to have an insignificant impact on oil prices given the onset of the global recession. The recession caused demand for energy to shrink in late 2008, with oil prices collapsing from the July 2008 high of $147 to a December 2008 low of $32. However, it has been disputed that the laws of supply and demand of oil could have been responsible for an almost 80% drop in the oil price within a six-month period. Oil prices stabilized by August 2009 and generally remained in a broad trading range between $70 and $120 through November 2014, before returning to 2003 pre-crisis levels by early 2016, as US production increased dramatically. The United States went on to become the largest oil producer by 2018.

==New inflation-adjusted peaks==
The price of crude oil in 2003 traded in a range between $20–$30/bbl. Between 2003 and July 2008, prices steadily rose, reaching $100/bbl in late 2007, coming close to the previous inflation-adjusted peak set in 1980. A steep rise in the price of oil in 2008 – also mirrored by other commodities – culminated in an all-time high of $147.27 during trading on 11 July 2008, more than a third above the previous inflation-adjusted high.

High oil prices and economic weakness contributed to a demand contraction in 2007–2008. In the United States, gasoline consumption declined by 0.4% in 2007, then fell by 0.5% in the first two months of 2008 alone. Record-setting oil prices in the first half of 2008 and economic weakness in the second half of the year prompted a /day contraction in US consumption of petroleum products, representing 5.8% of total US consumption, the largest annual decline since 1980 at the climax of the 1979 energy crisis.

==Possible causes==
===Demand===
World crude oil demand grew an average of 1.76% per year from 1994 to 2006, with a high of 3.4% in 2003–2004. World demand for oil is projected to increase 37% over 2006 levels by 2030, according to the 2007 U.S. Energy Information Administration&#x27;s (EIA) annual report. In 2007, the EIA expected demand to reach an ultimate high of , from 2006&#x27;s , driven in large part by the transportation sector. A 2008 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that although drops in petroleum demand due to high prices have been observed in developed countries and are expected to continue, a 3.7 percent rise in demand by 2013 is predicted in developing countries. This is projected to cause a net rise in global petroleum demand during that period.

Transportation consumes the largest proportion of energy, and has seen the largest growth in demand in recent decades. This growth has largely come from new demand for cars and other personal-use vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. This sector also has the highest consumption rates, accounting for approximately 55% of oil use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch report and 68.9% of the oil used in the United States in 2006. Cars and trucks are predicted to cause almost 75% of the increase in oil consumption by India and China between 2001 and 2025. In 2008, auto sales in China were expected to grow by as much as 15–20 percent, resulting in part from economic growth rates of over 10 percent for five years in a row.

Demand growth is highest in the developing world, but the United States is the world&#x27;s largest consumer of petroleum. Between 1995 and 2005, US consumption grew from a day to a day, an increase of a day. China, by comparison, increased consumption from a day to a day, an increase of a day, in the same time frame. Per capita, annual consumption is by people in the US, in China, and in India.

As countries develop, industry, rapid urbanization and higher living standards drive up energy use, most often of oil. Thriving economies such as China and India are quickly becoming large oil consumers. China has seen oil consumption grow by 8% yearly since 2002, doubling from 1996–2006.

Although swift continued growth in China is often predicted, others predict that China&#x27;s export-dominated economy will not continue such growth trends due to wage and price inflation and reduced demand from the US. India&#x27;s oil imports are expected to more than triple from 2005 levels by 2020, rising to .

Another large factor on petroleum demand has been human population growth. Because world population grew faster than oil production, production per capita peaked in 1979 (preceded by a plateau during the period of 1973–1979). The world’s population in 2030 is expected to be double that of 1980.

====Role of fuel subsidies====
State fuel subsidies shielded consumers in multiple nations from higher market prices, but a number of these subsidies were reduced or removed as the governmental cost rose.

In June 2008, AFP reported that:

In the same month, Reuters reported that:

&quot;The Economist&quot; reported: &quot;Half of the world&#x27;s population enjoys fuel subsidies. This estimate, from Morgan Stanley, implies that almost a quarter of the world&#x27;s petrol is sold at less than the market price.&quot; U.S. Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman stated that around of oil consumption (over a third of the global total) was subsidized.

===Supply===

An important contributor to the price increase was the slowdown in oil supply growth, which has been a general trend since oil production surpassed new discoveries in 1980. The likelihood that global oil production will decline at some point, leading to lower supply, is a long-term fundamental cause of rising prices. Although there is contention about the exact time at which global production will peak, a majority of industry participants acknowledge that the concept of a production peak is valid. However, some commentators argued that global warming awareness and new energy sources would limit demand before the effects of supply could, suggesting that reserve depletion would be a non-issue.

A large factor in the lower supply growth of petroleum has been that oil&#x27;s historically high ratio of Energy Returned on Energy Invested is in significant decline. Petroleum is a limited resource, and the remaining accessible reserves are consumed more rapidly each year. Remaining reserves are increasingly difficult to extract and therefore more expensive. Eventually, reserves will only be economically feasible to extract at extremely high prices. Even if total oil supply does not decline, increasing numbers of experts believe the easily accessible sources of light sweet crude are almost exhausted and in the future the world will depend on more-expensive unconventional oil reserves and heavy crude oil, as well as renewable energy sources. It is thought by a number of people, including energy economists such as Matthew Simmons, that prices could continue to rise indefinitely until a new market equilibrium is reached at which point supply satisfies worldwide demand.

Timothy Kailing, in a 2008 &quot;Journal of Energy Security&quot; article, pointed out the difficulty of increasing production in mature petroleum regions, even with vastly increased investment in exploration and production. By looking at the historical response of production to variation in drilling effort, he claimed that very little increase of production could be attributed to increased drilling. This was due to a tight quantitative relationship of diminishing returns with increasing drilling effort: As drilling effort increased, the energy obtained per active drill rig was reduced according to a severely diminishing power law. This analysis suggested that even an enormous increase of drilling effort was unlikely to lead to significantly increased oil and gas production in a mature petroleum region like the United States.

A prominent example of investment in non-conventional sources is seen in the Canadian oil sands. They are a far less cost-efficient source of heavy, low-grade oil than conventional crude; but when oil trades above $60/bbl, the tar sands become attractive to exploration and production companies. While Canada&#x27;s oil sands region is estimated to contain as much &quot;heavy&quot; oil as all the world&#x27;s reserves of &quot;conventional&quot; oil, efforts to economically exploit these resources lag behind the increasing demand of recent years.

Until 2008, CERA (a consulting company wholly owned by energy consultants IHS Energy) did not believe this would be such an immediate problem. However, in an interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal,&quot; Daniel Yergin, previously known for his quotes that the price of oil would soon return down to &quot;normal&quot;, amended the company&#x27;s position on 7 May 2008 to predict that oil would reach $150 during 2008, due to tightness of supply. This reversal of opinion was significant, as CERA, among other consultancies, provided price projections that were used by multiple official bodies to plan long-term strategy in respect of energy mix and price.

Other major energy organisations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), had already been much less optimistic in their assessments for some time. In 2008, the IEA drastically accelerated its prediction of production decline for existing oilfields, from 3.7% a year to 6.7% a year, based largely on better accounting methods, including actual research of individual oil field production throughout the world.

Terrorist and insurgent groups have increasingly targeted oil and gas installations, and succeeded in stopping a substantial volume of exports during the 2003–2008 height of the American occupation of Iraq. Such attacks are sometimes perpetrated by militias in regions where oil wealth has produced few tangible benefits for the local citizenry, as is the case in the Niger Delta.

A number of factors have resulted in possible and/or actual concerns about the reduced supply of oil. The post-9/11 war on terror, labor strikes, hurricane threats to oil platforms, fires and terrorist threats at refineries, and other short-lived problems are not solely responsible for the higher prices. Such problems do push prices higher temporarily, but have not historically been fundamental to long-term price increases.

===Investment/speculation demand===
Investment demand for oil occurs when investors purchase &quot;futures contracts&quot; to buy a commodity at a set price for future delivery. &quot;Speculators are not buying any actual crude. ... When [the] contracts mature, they either settle them with a cash payment or sell them on to genuine consumers.&quot;

Several claims have been made implicating financial speculation as a major cause of the price increases. In May 2008 the transport chief for Germany&#x27;s Social Democrats estimated that 25 percent of the rise to $135 a barrel had nothing to do with underlying supply and demand. Testimony was given to a U.S. Senate committee in May indicating that &quot;demand shock&quot; from &quot;institutional investors&quot; had increased by over the previous five years, almost as much as the increased physical demand from China (). The influence of institutional investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, was also discussed in June 2008, when Lehman Brothers suggested that price increases were related to increases in exposure to commodities by such investors. It claimed that &quot;for every $100 million in new inflows, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, increased by 1.6%.&quot; Also in May 2008, an article in &quot;The Economist&quot; pointed out that oil futures transactions on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), nearly mirrored the price of oil increases for a several-year period; however, the article conceded that the increased investment might be following rising prices, rather than causing them, and that the nickel market value had halved in the year between May 2007 and May 2008 despite significant speculative interest. It also reminded readers that &quot;Investment can flood into the oil market without driving up prices because speculators are not buying any actual crude... no oil is hoarded or somehow kept off the market,&quot; and that prices of some commodities which are not openly traded have actually risen faster than oil prices. In June 2008, OPEC&#x27;s Secretary General Abdallah Salem el-Badri stated that current world consumption of oil at 87 million bpd was far exceeded by the &quot;paper market&quot; for oil, which equaled about 1.36 billion bpd, or more than 15 times the actual market demand.

An interagency task force on commodities markets was formed in the U.S. government to investigate the claims of speculators&#x27; influence on the petroleum market. The task force concluded in July 2008 that &quot;market fundamentals&quot; such as supply and demand provided the best explanations for oil price increases, and that increased speculation was not statistically correlated with the increases. The report also noted that increased prices with an elastic supply would cause increases in petroleum inventories. As inventories actually declined, the task force concluded that market pressures were most likely to blame. Other commodities that were not subject to market speculation (such as coal, steel, and onions) saw similar price increases over the same time period.

In June 2008 U.S. energy secretary Samuel Bodman said that insufficient oil production, not financial speculation, was driving rising crude prices. He said that oil production had not kept pace with growing demand. &quot;In the absence of any additional crude supply, for every 1% of crude demand, we will expect a 20% increase in price in order to balance the market,&quot; Bodman said. This contradicted earlier statements by Iranian OPEC governor Mohammad-Ali Khatibi indicating that the oil market was saturated and that an increase in production announced by Saudi Arabia was &quot;wrong&quot;.

In September 2008, Masters Capital Management released a study of the oil market, concluding that speculation did significantly impact the price. The study stated that over $60 billion was invested in oil during the first six months of 2008, helping drive the price per barrel from $95 to $147, and that by the beginning of September, $39 billion had been withdrawn by speculators, causing prices to fall.

==Effects==

There is debate over what the effects of the 2000s energy crisis will be over the long term. Some speculated that an oil-price spike could create a recession comparable to those that followed the 1973 and 1979 energy crises or a potentially worse situation such as a global oil crash. Increased petroleum prices are reflected in a vast number of products derived from petroleum, as well as those transported using petroleum fuels.

Political scientist George Friedman has postulated that if high prices for oil and food persist, they will define the fourth distinct geopolitical regime since the end of World War II, the previous three being the Cold War, the 1989–2001 period in which economic globalization was primary, and the post-9/11 &quot;war on terror&quot;.

In addition to high oil prices, from year 2000 volatility in the price of oil has increased notably and this volatility has been suggested to be a factor in the financial crisis which began in 2008.

The perceived increase in oil price differs internationally according to currency market fluctuations and the purchasing power of currencies. For example, excluding changes in relative purchasing power of various currencies, from 1 January 2002 to 1 January 2008:
* In US$, oil price rose from $20.37 to nearly $100, about &quot;4.91&quot; times as expensive;
* In the same period, the Taiwanese dollar gained value over the U.S. dollar to make oil in Taiwan &quot;4.53&quot; times as expensive;
* In the same period, the Japanese Yen gained value over the U.S. dollar to make oil in Japan &quot;4.10&quot; times as expensive;
* In the same period, the Euro gained value over the U.S. dollar to make oil in the Eurozone 2.94 times as expensive.

On average, oil prices roughly quadrupled for these areas, triggering widespread protest activities. A similar price surge for petroleum-based fertilizers contributed to the 2007–08 world food price crisis and further unrest.

In 2008, a report by Cambridge Energy Research Associates stated that 2007 had been the year of peak gasoline usage in the United States, and that record energy prices would cause an &quot;enduring shift&quot; in energy consumption practices. According to the report, in April gas consumption had been lower than a year before for the sixth straight month, suggesting 2008 would be the first year U.S. gasoline usage declined in 17 years. The total miles driven in the U.S. began declining in 2006.

In the United States, oil prices contributed to inflation averaging 3.3% in 2005–2006, significantly above the average of 2.5% in the preceding 10-year period. As a result, during this period the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates to curb inflation.

High oil prices typically affect less-affluent countries first, particularly the developing world with less discretionary income. There are fewer vehicles per capita, and oil is often used for electricity generation as well as private transport. The World Bank has looked more deeply at the effect of oil prices in the developing countries. One analysis found that in South Africa a 125 percent increase in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum reduces employment and GDP by approximately 2 percent, and reduces household consumption by approximately 7 percent, affecting mainly the poor.

OPEC&#x27;s annual oil export revenue surged to a new record in 2008, estimated around US$800 billion.

==Forecasted prices and trends==
According to informed observers, OPEC, meeting in early December 2007, seemed to desire a high but stable price that would deliver substantial needed income to the oil-producing states, but avoid prices so high that they would negatively impact the economies of the oil-consuming nations. A range of US$70–80 per barrel was suggested by some analysts to be OPEC&#x27;s goal.

In November 2008, as prices fell below $60 a barrel, the IEA warned that falling prices could lead to both a lack of investment in new sources of oil and a fall in production of more-expensive unconventional reserves such as the oil sands of Canada. The IEA&#x27;s chief economist warned, &quot;Oil supplies in the future will come more and more from smaller and more-difficult fields,&quot; meaning that future production requires more investment every year. A lack of new investment in such projects, which had already been observed, could eventually cause new and more-severe supply issues than had been experienced in the early 2000s according to the IEA. Because the sharpest production declines had been seen in developed countries, the IEA warned that the greatest growth in production was expected to come from smaller projects in OPEC states, raising their world production share from 44% in 2008 to a projected 51% in 2030. The IEA also pointed out that demand from the developed world may have also peaked, so that future demand growth was likely to come from developing nations such as China, contributing 43%, and India and the Middle East, each about 20%.

==End of the crisis==
By the beginning of September 2008, prices had fallen to $110. OPEC Secretary General El-Badri said that the organization intended to cut output by about a day, which he saw as correcting a &quot;huge oversupply&quot; due to declining economies and a stronger U.S. dollar. On 10 September, the International Energy Agency (IEA) lowered its 2009 demand forecast by to a day.

As countries throughout the world entered an economic recession in the third quarter of 2008 and the global banking system came under severe strain, oil prices continued to slide. In November and December, global demand growth fell, and U.S. oil demand fell an estimated 10% overall from early October to early November 2008 (accompanying a significant drop in auto sales).

In their December meeting, OPEC members agreed to reduce their production by per day, and said their resolution to reduce production in October had an 85% compliance rate.

Petroleum prices fell below $35 in February 2009, but by May 2009 had risen back to mid-November 2008 levels around $55. The global economic downturn left oil-storage facilities with more oil than in any year since 1990, when Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait upset the market.

In early 2011, crude oil rebounded above US$100/bbl due to the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East and North Africa, including the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Libyan civil war, and steadily tightening international sanctions against Iran. The oil price fluctuated around $100 through early 2014.

By 2014–2015, the world oil market was again steadily oversupplied, led by an unexpected near-doubling in U.S. oil production from 2008 levels due to substantial improvements in shale &quot;fracking&quot; technology. By January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket fell to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up. OPEC production was poised to rise further with the lifting of Iranian sanctions, at a time when markets already appeared to be oversupplied by at least 2 million barrels per day.

==Possible mitigations==
Attempts to mitigate the impacts of oil price increases include:
* Increasing the supply of petroleum
* Finding substitutes for petroleum
* Decreasing the demand for petroleum
* Attempting to reduce the impact of rising prices on petroleum consumers
* Better urban planning with more emphasis on bike lanes, public transit, and high dense residential zoning.

In mainstream economic theory, a free market rations an increasingly scarce commodity by increasing its price. A higher price should stimulate producers to produce more, and consumers to consume less, while possibly shifting to substitutes. The first three mitigation strategies in the above list are, therefore, in keeping with mainstream economic theory, as government policies can affect the supply and demand for petroleum as well as the availability of substitutes. In contrast, the last type of strategy in the list (attempting to shield consumers from rising prices) would seem to work against classical economic theory, by encouraging consumers to overconsume the scarce quantity, thus making it even scarcer. To avoid creating outright shortages, attempts at price control may require some sort of rationing scheme.

===Alternative propulsion===

====Alternative fuels====
Economists say that the substitution effect will spur demand for alternate fossil fuels, such as coal or liquefied natural gas and for renewable energy, such as solar power, wind power, and advanced biofuels.

For example, China and India are currently heavily investing in natural gas and coal liquefaction facilities. Nigeria is working on burning natural gas to produce electricity instead of simply flaring the gas, where all non-emergency gas flaring will be forbidden after 2008. Outside the U.S., more than 50% of oil is consumed for stationary, non-transportation purposes such as electricity production where it is relatively easy to substitute natural gas for oil.

Oil companies including the supermajors have begun to fund research into alternative fuel. BP has invested half a billion dollars for research over the next several years. The motivations behind such moves are to acquire the patent rights as well as understanding the technology so vertical integration of the future industry could be achieved.

====Electric propulsion====
The rise in oil prices caused renewed interest in electric cars, with several new models hitting the market, both hybrid and purely electric. The most successful among the former being the Toyota Prius and among the latter the cars of companies like Tesla. Several countries also incentivized the use of electric cars through tax-breaks or subsidies or by building charging stations.

====High speed rail====
In a similar vein as the original TGV that was switched from gas turbine to electric propulsion after the 1973 oil crisis, several countries have renewed and increased their efforts for electric propulsion in their rail systems, specifically high-speed rail. In the time since 2003, the global High speed rail network almost doubled and there are plans globally that amount to the network being doubled again within the next ten to twenty years, based on current constructions. China in particular went from having no high-speed rail whatsoever in 2003 to having the longest network in the world in 2015.

===Bioplastics and bioasphalt===

Another major factor in petroleum demand is the widespread use of petroleum products such as plastic. These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, cornstarch, pea starch, or microbiota. They are used either as a direct replacement for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common end use market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.

Bioasphalt can also be used as a replacement of petroleum asphalt.

===United States Strategic Fuel Reserve===
The United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve could, on its own, supply current U.S. demand for about a month in the event of an emergency, unless it were also destroyed or inaccessible in the emergency. This could potentially be the case if a major storm were to hit the Gulf of Mexico, where the reserve is located. While total consumption has increased, the western economies are less reliant on oil than they were twenty-five years ago, due both to substantial growth in productivity and the growth of sectors of the economy with little oil dependence such as finance and banking, retail, etc. The decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in most developed countries has reduced the amount of oil per unit GDP; however, since these items are imported anyway, there is less change in the oil dependence of industrialized countries than the direct consumption statistics indicate.

===Fuel taxes===

One recourse used and discussed in the past to avoid the negative impacts of oil shocks in the a number of developed countries which have high fuel taxes has been to temporarily or permanently suspend these taxes as fuel costs rise.

France, Italy, and the Netherlands lowered taxes in 2000 in response to protests over high prices, but other European nations resisted this option because public service finance is partly based on energy taxes. The issue came up again in 2004, when oil reached $40 a barrel causing a meeting of 25 EU finance ministers to lower economic growth forecasts for that year. Because of budget deficits in several countries, they decided to pressure OPEC to lower prices instead of lowering taxes. In 2007, European truckers, farmers, and fishermen again raised concerns over record oil prices cutting into their earnings, hoping to have taxes lowered. In the United Kingdom, where fuel taxes were raised in October and were scheduled to rise again in April 2008, there was talk of protests and roadblocks if the tax issue was not addressed. On 1 April 2008, a 25 yen per liter fuel tax in Japan was allowed to lapse temporarily.

This method of softening price shocks is even less viable to countries with much lower gas taxes, such as the United States.

Locally decreasing fuel tax can decrease fuel prices, but globally prices are set by supply and demand, and therefore fuel tax decreases may have no effect on fuel prices, and fuel tax increases might actually decrease fuel prices by reducing demand. But this depends on the price elasticity of demand for fuel which is -0.09 to -0.31, meaning that fuel is a relatively inelastic commodity, i.e. increasing or decreasing prices have overall only a small effect on demand and therefore price change.

===Demand management===
Transportation demand management has the potential to be an effective policy response to fuel shortages or price increases and has a greater probability of long term benefits than other mitigation options.

There are major differences in energy consumption for private transport between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for private transport as a Chinese urban resident. These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of walking, cycling, and public transport use and to enduring features of the city including urban density and urban design.

For individuals, remote work provides alternatives to daily commuting and long-distance air travel for business. Technologies such as videoconferencing, e-mail, and corporate wikis, continue to improve. As the cost of moving human workers continues to rise, while the cost of moving information electronically continues to fall, presumably market forces should cause more people to substitute virtual travel for physical travel. Matthew Simmons explicitly calls for &quot;liberating the workforce&quot; by changing the corporate mindset from paying people to show up physically to work every day, to paying them instead for the work they do, from any location. This would allow more information workers to work from home either part-time or full-time, or from satellite offices or Internet cafes near to where they live, freeing them from long daily commutes to central offices. However, even full adoption of remote work by all eligible workers might only decrease energy consumption by about 1% (with present energy savings estimated at 0.01–0.04%). By comparison, a 20% increase in automobile fuel economy would save 5.4%.

===Political action against market speculation===
The price rises of mid-2008 led to a variety of proposals to change the rules governing energy markets and energy futures markets, in order to prevent rises due to market speculation.

On 26 July 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed the Energy Markets Emergency Act of 2008 (H.R. 6377), which directs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) &quot;to utilize all its authority, including its emergency powers, to curb immediately the role of excessive speculation in any contract market within the jurisdiction and control of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, on or through which energy futures or swaps are traded, and to eliminate excessive speculation, price distortion, sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in prices, or other unlawful activity causing major market disturbances that prevent the market from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand for energy commodities.&quot;

<doc id="1197356" wikidata="Q62926" url="?curid=1197356" title="Leonor Michaelis">
<text>Leonor Michaelis (16 January 1875 – 8 October 1949) was a German biochemist, physical chemist, and physician. He is known for his work with Maud Menten on enzyme kinetics in 1913, as well as for work on enzyme inhibition, pH and quinones.

==Early life and education==
Leonor Michaelis was born in Berlin, Germany, on 16 January 1875 to Jewish parents Hulda and Moritz . He had three brothers and one sister. Michaelis graduated from the humanistic Köllnisches Gymnasium in 1893 after passing the Abiturienten Examen. It was during that time that Michaelis&#x27;s interest in physics and chemistry was first sparked as he was encouraged by his teachers to utilize the relatively unused laboratories at his school.

With concerns about the financial stability of a pure scientist, he commenced his study of medicine at Berlin University in 1893. Among his instructors were Emil du Bois-Reymond for physiology, Emil Fischer for chemistry, and Oscar Hertwig for histology and embryology.

During his time at Berlin University, Michaelis worked in the lab of Oscar Hertwig, even receiving a prize for a paper on the histology of milk secretion. Michaelis&#x27;s doctoral thesis work on cleavage determination in frog eggs led him to write a textbook on embryology. Through his work at Hertwig&#x27;s lab, Michaelis came to know Paul Ehrlich and his work on blood cytology; he worked as Ehrlich&#x27;s private research assistant from 1898 to 1899.

He passed his physician&#x27;s examination in 1896 in Freiburg, and then moved to Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1897. After receiving his medical degree, Michaelis worked as a private research assistant to Moritz Litten (1899–1902) and for Ernst Viktor von Leyden (1902–1906).

==Life and work==

From 1900 to 1904, Michaelis continued his study of clinical medicine at a municipal hospital in Berlin, where he found time to establish a chemical laboratory.
He attained the position of Privatdocent at the University of Berlin in 1903. In 1905 he accepted a position as director of the bacteriology lab in the Klinikum Am Urban, becoming Professor extraordinary at Berlin University in 1908. In 1914 he published a paper suggesting that Emil Abderhalden&#x27;s pregnancy tests could not be reproduced, a paper which fatally compromised Michaelis&#x27;s position as an academic in Germany. In addition to that, he feared that being Jewish would make further advancement in the university unlikely, and in 1922, Michaelis moved to the Medical School of the University of Nagoya (Japan) as Professor of biochemistry, becoming one of the first foreign professors at a Japanese university, bringing with him several documents, apparatuses and chemicals from Germany. His research in Japan focussed on potentiometric measurements and the cellular membrane. Nagatsu has provided an account of Michaelis&#x27;s contributions to biochemistry in Japan.

In 1926, he moved to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore as resident lecturer in medical research and in 1929 to the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in New York City, where he retired in 1941.

=== The Michaelis–Menten equation ===
Michaelis&#x27;s work with Menten led to the Michaelis–Menten equation. This is now available in English.

formula_1

for a steady-state rate formula_2 in terms of the substrate concentration formula_3 and constants formula_4 and formula_5 (written with modern symbols).

An equation of the same form and with the same meaning appeared in the doctoral thesis of Victor Henri, a decade before Michaelis and Menten. However, Henri did not take it further: in particular he did not discuss the advantages of considering initial rates rather than time courses. Nonetheless, it is historically more accurate to refer to the &quot;Henri–Michaelis–Menten equation&quot;.

=== Classification of Inhibition types ===

Michaelis was one of the first to study enzyme inhibition, and to classify inhibition types as &quot;competitive&quot; or &quot;non-competitive&quot;. In competitive inhibition the apparent value of formula_5 is increased, and in non-competitive inhibition the apparent value of formula_4 is decreased. Nowadays we consider the apparent value of formula_8 to be decreased in competitive inhibition, with no effect on the apparent value of formula_4: Michaelis&#x27;s competitive inhibitors are still competitive inhibitors by this definition. However, non-competitive inhibition by his criterion is very rare, but &quot;mixed inhibition&quot;, with effects on the apparent values of both formula_8 and formula_4 is important. Some authors call this non-competitive inhibition, but it is not non-competitive inhibition as understood by Michaelis. The remaining important kind of inhibition, &quot;uncompetitive inhibition&quot;, in which the apparent value of formula_4 is decreased 
with no effect on the apparent value of formula_8, was not considered by Michaelis. Fuller discussion can be found elsewhere.

=== Hydrogen ion concentration ===

Michaelis built virtually immediately on Sørensen&#x27;s 1909 introduction of the pH scale with a study of the effect of hydrogen ion concentration on invertase, and he became the leading world expert on pH and buffers. His book was the major reference on the subject for decades.

=== Quinones ===

In his later career he worked extensively on quinones, and discovered Janus green as a supravital stain for mitochondria and the Michaelis–Gutmann body in urinary tract infections (1902). He found that thioglycolic acid could dissolve keratin, a discovery that would come to have several implications in the cosmetic industry, including the permanent wave (&quot;perm&quot;).

A full discussion of his life and contributions to biochemistry may be consulted for more information.

== &quot;Catalysing&quot; the Suzuki method of music teaching==
During his time in Japan Michaelis knew the young Shinichi Suzuki, later famous for the Suzuki method of teaching the violin and other instruments. Suzuki asked his advice about whether he should become a professional violinist. Perhaps more honest than tactful, Michaelis advised him to take up teaching, and thus catalysed the invention of the Suzuki method.

==Personal life and death==
Michaelis was married to Hedwig Philipsthal; they had two daughters, Ilse Wolman and Eva M. Jacoby. Leonor Michaelis died on 8 October or 10 October, 1949 in New York City.

==Honors==
Michaelis was a Harvey Lecturer in 1924 and a Sigma Xi Lecturer in 1946. He was elected to be a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1929, a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1943. In 1945, he received an honorary LL.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles.

<text>The Hong Kong national football team (; recognised as Hong Kong, China by FIFA) represents Hong Kong in international football and is controlled by the Football Association of Hong Kong, China, the governing body for football in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong hosted the first AFC Asian Cup in 1956 and won third place, also reaching the semifinals in 1964. Hong Kong did not qualify for another AFC tournament until 2023. They had never qualified for the FIFA World Cup and their biggest celebrated victory was the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC) where Hong Kong produced a 2–1 upset win against China which resulted in Hong Kong qualifying for the second round of qualification. Hong Kong has qualified for the EAFF E-1 Football Championship five times, in 2003, 2010, 2019, 2022 and 2025.

==History==
===Establishment and pre-WWII era===
Before Hong Kong became a member of FIFA in 1954, Hong Kong began playing in the Hong Kong–Macau Interport tournament in 1937, which was one of the oldest competitions co-held by Hong Kong as well as continuously played. There were other interport tournaments in the past, such as the Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport which was first held in 1908. At that time the team was composed of ethnic Chinese as well as western expatriates, as in the 1935 and 1937 edition of Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport. There was another Interport tournament against Saigon. The aforementioned Macau, Shanghai and Saigon were not a member of FIFA nor a sovereign nation at that time, with Hong Kong and Macau only having joined FIFA in 1954 and 1978 respectively. The China national team that participated in 1936 and 1948 Summer Olympics, were mainly composed of ethnic Chinese players from Hong Kong, most famously Lee Wai Tong.

After WWII, a number of Shanghai-based players began representing Hong Kong, such as Chang King Hai and Hsu King Shing. Hong Kong played its first international match after World War II on 20 April 1947, against South Vietnam. Its first victory came in 1953, a 4–0 win against South Korea.

===FIFA member (1954–present)===
The Hong Kong FA became a member of FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation in 1954. Since then Hong Kong played their first FIFA-recognised international match against other countries. HKFA also sent a scratch team for 1957 Merdeka Tournament, which was composed of players from Eastern due to their proximity, plus few players from other clubs. The club was having a pre-season tour in South Asia, thus the HKFA invited the club to represent Hong Kong. However, some of the players were in fact ineligible to play for Hong Kong, as they were ROC (Taiwan) international players.

Hong Kong qualified for three of the first four editions of the Asian Cup, including a third-place finish in the 1956 edition as host. At that time, most Hong Kong players represented Republic of China (Taiwan); they finished third in the Asian Cup in the 1960 edition, leaving more inferior players to the proper Hong Kong team.

Hong Kong has never qualified for the World Cup. However, its most celebrated victory happened during 1986 World Cup qualifying. On 19 May 1985, in Beijing, Hong Kong faced China in the final match of the first qualifying round, where Hong Kong needed a win to advance while China needed only a draw. Hong Kong, led by coach Kwok Ka Ming, produced a 2–1 upset win, with goals from Cheung Chi Tak and Ku Kam Fai, thereby winning the group and advancing to the knockout stage where it subsequently lost to Japan.

The 1998 World Cup Asian qualifiers was considered one of Hong Kong&#x27;s darkest moments as it was hit by a match-fixing scandal that involved former Sing Tao striker Chan Tsz-Kong who was found guilty and jailed for a year after he bribed players to throw and lose a match against Thailand. Others who were involved include goalkeeper Kevin Lok Kar-Win, defenders Chan Chi-Keung and Lau Chi Yuen and striker Wai Kwan-Lung.

===Football Fever in 2015===
A short football fever appeared during 2018 World Cup qualifying in Hong Kong under the guidance of Kim Pan Gon, as Hong Kong had drawn into the same group with their fierce rival, China. Due to the tensions built up from Hong Kong–Mainland China conflict, many local citizens became interested in this year&#x27;s campaign; all four home matches were recorded as a sellout. Hong Kong ended the campaign with 4 victories against Bhutan and Maldives, 2 scoreless draws against China, and 2 losses against Qatar.

In late 2018, after the sudden departure of Kim Pan-gon, English-born coach Gary White was hired as the new head coach in which under his guidance, he helped Hong Kong secure qualification for their third appearance at the EAFF E-1 Football Championship finals after a narrow win against Chinese Taipei, a draw against North Korea and a heavy win against Mongolia. Shortly afterwards, White departed from the role.

In April 2019, Hong Kong appointed Finnish-born Mixu Paatelainen as the new head coach of the national football team in time for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and the 2019 EAFF E-1 Football Championship tournament. His first game in charge ended in a disappointing and surprising loss at home during friendly international against Chinese Taipei. However, after a run of poor performances throughout the World Cup qualifiers and the 2019 EAFF E-1 Football Championship, Mixu Paatelainen&#x27;s contract was not renewed.

===Return to the AFC Asian Cup tournament===

On 13 December 2021, Norwegian Jørn Andersen who formerly guided North Korea was named as the new head coach succeeding Mixu Paatelainen in preparation for the third round of qualification of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. He guided Hong Kong to qualify for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup by beating Afghanistan 2–1 and Cambodia 3–0, reaching the final tournament after a 55-year absence. In preparation for the tournament itself, on 2 January 2024, Hong Kong pulled a shocking 2–1 victory over arch-enemy China beating them for the first time in 29 years during the friendly match held in Abu Dhabi.

On 15 January 2024, Hong Kong then kicked off their 2023 Asian Cup campaign against UAE in which they lost 3–1 in the opening match where Chan Siu Kwan scored the 1,000th goal in the AFC Asian Cup history. They eventually finished the campaign at the bottom of their group after losses against Iran (0–1) and Palestine (0–3).

On 29 May 2024, Jørn Andersen announced his resignation as head coach of the Hong Kong national football team after almost over 2 years in charge. 

On 28 August 2024, English manager Ashley Westwood was appointed as the new head coach of the Hong Kong national football team, succeeding Jørn Andersen. In September 2024, Hong Kong travelled to Fiji and played two friendly matches against Oceania countries, Solomon Islands and Fiji.

The team also travelled to Europe on November for the first time other than Asian soil where they played against the Liechtenstein.

On 8 December 2024, Yapp Hung Fai became the first Hong Kong player to reach 100 international caps against Mongolia during the 2025 EAFF E-1 Football Championship Preliminary Round.

===Home Stadium===

The team&#x27;s primary stadium is Hong Kong Stadium.
For some friendly matches and minor qualification matches, the Hong Kong team plays most often at the Mong Kok Stadium in Kowloon, which was re-opened in 2011 after a renovation. Moreover, the 2018 edition of the Lunar New Year Cup was held in Mong Kok. The cup was a local tradition to celebrate Chinese New Year, which was held in Government Stadium in the past.

The Jockey Club HKFA Football Training Centre is currently the main training ground for the Hong Kong national and youth teams.

===Rivalries===

==== China ====
Hong Kong maintains a specific rivalry with China. The rivalry began in 1978 and for the first decades before the return of Hong Kong to China, Hong Kong produced a shock 2–1 upset in Beijing, and this led to unrest by Chinese supporters. Since then, China never lost to Hong Kong, and has achieved more successes, but the rivalry continues to have some influence on Hong Kong society.

On 1 January 2024, Hong Kong defeated China in a closed door international friendly, marking their first victory in 29 years.

==== Macau ====
The Hong Kong–Macau rivalry has been contested by Hong Kong Football Association and Macau Football Association since 1937.

== History of naturalised players ==
During the 1950s, Arthur Santos who is of British-Portuguese nationality (whose son Leslie was a former Hong Kong international footballer) became the first naturalised player to represent the Hong Kong national football team who was then followed by another fellow Portuguese-born player named JH Toleido.

In the 1960s, there were a couple more foreign players who had represented the Hong Kong national football team whilst some were working within the national service at the time. These include British players from T. Watson, Evans, Ken Wallis who went on to represent Hong Kong during the lawn bowls event during the 1990 and 1994 Commonwealth Games as well as Australian-born Pete McClaren and Scottish-born Charlie Wright. 

In the late 1970s, Scottish-born players Derek Currie, Dave Anderson and Hugh McCrory all became eligible to represent the Hong Kong national football team in which Currie and Anderson took part during the 1979 Asian Cup qualifiers whilst McCrory took part during the 1982 World Cup qualifiers.

There were at least a couple more naturalised players who went on to represent Hong Kong throughout the 90&#x27;s which include Bosnian-born Anto Grabo along with fellow English-born players Mark Grainger, John Moore and most notably Dale Tempest. Sung Lin Yung became the first mainland born player to represent Hong Kong during the 1998 World Cup Asian qualifiers having resided for more than two years under FIFA eligibility rules unlike foreign born players that would usually require at least seven years.

In the 2000s, a couple of African and Brazilian-born players were introduced went through the naturalisation process having met the residential criteria. Nigerian-born Lawrence Akandu obtained his Hong Kong citizenship in which he played for the national team during the 2003 East Asia Cup finals where he scored a goal in a loss against South Korea. He was soon followed by Cameroon-born Guy Gerard Ambassa who obtained his permanent residential status in 2005 along with another fellow Nigerian-born player named Colly Ezeh and Brazilian-born Cristiano Cordeiro in which both of whom earned international caps during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. Cordeiro was also the first non-Chinese captain in the history of the Hong Kong team during the 2008 East Asia Cup preliminary stages. Despite having played for the national team during the 2009 edition of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup, Cameroonian-born Julius Akosah attempted to apply for a HKSAR passport, however his application was unsuccessful.

During the mid 2010s, there had been an increase of naturalised players being used to represent the national team in which former head coach Kim Pan-gon stated that he needed to pick his best players regardless of their origin in preparation during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers. 

These include the likes of European-born players Dani Cancela, Jaimes McKee, Fernando Recio, Andy Russell, Jack Sealy, Jordi Tarrés and Sean Tse, Brazilian-born players Everton Camargo, Paulo César, Clayton, Dudu, Diego Eli, Fernando, Giovane, Helio, Itaparica, Juninho, Roberto Júnior, Tomas Maronesi, Paulinho, Stefan Pereira, and Sandro, Asian-born players Jahangir Khan and Yuto Nakamura, and African-born players from Wisdom Fofo Agbo, Alex Akande, Christian Annan, Mahama Awal, Festus Baise, Godfred Karikari, Jean-Jacques Kilama, and Paul Ngue.

In addition to Sung Lin Yung, several other mainland born players went on to represent Hong Kong from past to present which include Bai He, Chao Pengfei, Deng Jinghuang, Feng Jizhi, Gao Wen, Li Haiqiang, Liu Quankun, Huang Yang, Ju Yingzhi, Wang Zhenpeng, Wei Zhao, Xiao Guoji, Xu Deshuai, Ye Jia, and Zhang Chunhui.

<text>The 20th century saw the rise and fall of many subcultures.

==20th century==

===Fin de siècle===

In the early part of the 20th century, subcultures were mostly informal groupings of like-minded individuals with the same views or lifestyle. The Bloomsbury group in London was one example, providing a place where the diverse talents of people like Virginia Woolf, Leonard Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, and E.M. Forster could interact. Other pre-World War I subcultures were smaller social groupings of hobbyists or a matter of style and philosophy amongst artists and bohemian poets. In Germany, from 1896, there developed a movement of young men (and later young women) which focused on freedom and natural environments. Called Wandervogel (translated as &quot;hikers&quot;, &quot;ramblers&quot; or, more precisely, &quot;migratory birds&quot;), they wanted to throw off the strict rules of society and be more open and natural. The first known organized club for nudists, Freilichtpark (Free-Light Park), was opened near Hamburg, Germany, in 1903. In Italy, a popular art movement and philosophy called Futurism championed change, speed, violence and machines.

===World War I===
After the First World War (1914–18) hair styles changed: the wartime trenches were infested with lice and fleas, so soldiers were forced to shave their heads. Consequently, men with short hair appeared to have been at the front in the war, while men with longer hair might be thought of as pacifists and cowards, even suspected of desertion. Some artists managed to avoid the war by sitting it out in neutral Switzerland.

===1920s===
In the 1920s, American jazz music and motor cars were at the centre of a European subculture which began to break the rules of social etiquette and the class system (See also Swing Kids and Flappers). In America, the same &quot;flaming youth&quot; subculture was &quot;running wild&quot; but with the added complication of alcohol prohibition. Canada had prohibition in some areas, but for the most part, thirsty Americans coming over the border found an oasis. As a result, smuggling escalated as crime gangs became organized. In the southern United States, Mexico and Cuba were popular with drinkers. Thus, a drinking subculture grew in size and a crime subculture grew along with it. Other drugs were used as alternatives to alcohol. When prohibition ended, the subculture of drink, drugs and jazz did not disappear, and neither did the gangsters.

===1930s===
The German nudist movement gained prominence in the 1920s, but was suppressed during the Nazi Gleichschaltung after Adolf Hitler came to power. Social nudism in the form of private clubs and campgrounds first appeared in the United States in the 1930s. In Canada, it first appeared in British Columbia about 1939 and in Ontario nine years later.

In the art world, Surrealism was attempting to shock the world with their games and bizarre behavior. The Surrealists were at one and the same time a serious art movement and a parody of other art forms and political movements. Surrealism had been developed by André Breton and others from the Dada movement. Based in several European countries, Surrealism was destined for trouble when the Nazis came to power. Subcultures and &quot;degenerate art&quot; were almost completely stamped out and replaced by the Hitler Youth.

In North America, the Great Depression caused widespread unemployment and poverty, and a consequent malaise among adolescents that found its expression in urban youth gangs—the so-called &quot;dead end kids.&quot; The dead end kid phenomenon was fictionalized on the stage and screen where it became a popular image with which people could identify. Films featuring the &quot;Dead End Kids&quot;, &quot;East Side Kids&quot;, &quot;Little Tough Guys&quot; etc. were popular from the 1930s to the 1950s. The genre also found its expression in the kid gang comic book stories of Jack Kirby and Joe Simon, including the &quot;Boy Commandos&quot; and &quot;Newsboy Legion&quot; features.

The Dust Bowl disaster forced large numbers of rural Americans from Oklahoma and elsewhere to move their entire families to survive. They were labeled as &quot;Okies&quot; and treated poorly by the authorities in other states. Their refugee status was recorded in folk songs (including many by Woody Guthrie), as well as John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, and the film adaptation starring Henry Fonda.

===1940s===
Avant-garde artists like Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp and Marc Chagall fled Europe following the outbreak of World War II. These artists arrived in the United States, where a subculture of surrealism and avant-garde experimentation developed in New York City, becoming the new centre of the art world.

American fashion remained gangster orientated, with gangs gravitating around immigrant and racial cultures. In California, Hispanic youth developed the distinctive zoot suit fashion, such as the black widows, women who dressed in black. The zoot suiters use of language involved rhyming and pig Latin (also known as backslang). This style, collectively known as &quot;Swing&quot; or &quot;Jive talk&quot; (see: Dictionary of Swing), included Afro-American, Cuban, Mexican and South American elements, as well as bits introduced by Slim Gaillard (see &quot;McVouty oreeney&quot;).

The entry of the United States into World War II was heralded by new legislation making zoot suits illegal due to the extra cloth required. In June 1943, white American servicemen stationed in Los Angeles rampaged through Mexican American neighborhoods, attacking young people wearing the suits and often stripping them, in what has become known as the Zoot Suit Riots. The riots in Los Angeles were part of a nationwide phenomenon of urban disturbances arising out of wartime tensions exacerbating longstanding racial discrimination in America. The Zoot Suit Riots were unique in that the fashions of the largely Mexican American (and some white and African-American) victims made them the target of white servicemen stationed in the city, many of whom were from southern white towns.

In Europe, black-marketeers prospered under rationing. Clothing styles depended on what could be begged or acquired by some means, not necessarily legal; There were restrictions everywhere. When the Americans arrived in Britain, black-marketeers, (called Wide boys or Spivs) made deals with GIs for stockings, chocolate, etc. Inevitably, subculture continued to have an image of criminality and the brave, the daring, the milieu, the resistance, etc. The black market in drugs thrived just about anywhere.

After the second war, the zoot suit craze spread to France in the form of the Zazou youths. Meanwhile, the intellectuals in France were forming an existentialist subculture around Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus in Paris cafe culture.

In post-war America, folk songs and cowboy songs (also known, in those days, as hillbilly music) were beginning to be more popular with a wider audience. A subculture of rural jazz and blues fans had mixed elements of jazz and blues into traditional cowboy and folk song styles to produce a crossover called western swing. Thanks to the prevalence of radio, this music spread across the United States in the 1940s. Radio was the first &quot;almost instantaneous&quot; mass media with the power to create large subcultures by spreading the ideas of small subcultures across a wide area.

Bebop, a new jazz subculture, formed from the rebellion against the melodic stylings of swing; Notable players included Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. In turn, bebop spawned the hipster and beat generation subculture.

In 1947, Jack Kerouac made an epic journey across America, which he would later describe in his novel, &quot;On the Road&quot;. In the same year, there was an incident involving a motorcycle gang at Hollister, California, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, published a story about it. In 1948, the Hells Angels formed in Fontana, California. The Hells Angels began as a motorcycle club looking for excitement in the dull times after the end of the war and became notorious as time passed. Motorcycle gangs in general began to hit the headlines. In 1953, the film, &quot;The Wild One&quot;, was released starring Marlon Brando.

===1950s===
The Existentialists had a profound influence upon subcultural development. Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus transferred their French resistance underground campaign to the context of a cultural revolution and the American beat scene joined the movement. The emphasis on freedom of the individual influenced the beats in America and Britain and this version of existential bohemianism continued through the 1950s and into the 1960s under the guise of the beat generation. Beards and longer hair returned in another attempt at returning to the image of &quot;peacetime man&quot; and the normality which had existed before the two wars. At the same time, as a result of American post-war prosperity, a new identity emerged for youth subculture: the &quot;teenager&quot;.

Jazz culture was transformed, by way of rhythm and blues into rock and roll culture. There are various suggested candidates for which record might have been the First rock and roll record. At the same time, jazz culture itself continued but changed into a more respected form, no longer necessarily associated with wild behaviour and criminality.

From the 1950s onward society noticed an increase in street gang culture, random vandalism and graffiti. Sociologists, psychologists, social workers and judges all had theories as to what was causing the increase to urban trouble, but it was later accepted that it developed in protest to the older generation&#x27;s pro-white supremacy views. 
The consensus has generally tended to be that the modern urban environment offers all the bright lights and benefits of the modern world but often provides working class youths with little in reality. This theory and others were parodied in the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot; (based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;) in song lyrics such as &quot;Jet Song&quot;, &quot;America&quot;, and &quot;Gee, Officer Krupke&quot;. Moral panics surrounding the advent of teenager subcultures and a perceived rise in adolescent criminality led to several attempts to investigate and legislate youth behavior, such as the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. One of the many subcultures that was based around street violence was the greaser, a working class subculture that was a part of and influenced the biker subculture.

As American rock and roll arrived in the United Kingdom, a subculture grew around it. Some of the British post-war street youths hanging around bombsites in urban areas and getting drawn into petty crime began to dress in a variation of the zoot suit style called a drape suit, with a country style bootlace tie, winklepicker shoes, drainpipe trousers, and Elvis Presley style slicked hair. These youths were called Teddy boys. For a night out dancing at the palais, their girlfriends would usually wear the same sort of poodle skirts and crinolines their counterparts in America would wear. For day-to-day wear there was a trend toward girls wearing slacks or jeans. At the time, the idea of girls wearing trousers and boys taking time over their hairstyles was socially shocking to many people.

British youth divided into factions. There were the modern jazz kids, the trad jazz kids, the rock and roll teenagers and the skiffle craze. Coffee bars were a meeting place for all the types of youth and the coolest ones were said to be in Soho, London.

In Britain, the political side of the Beat Generation was the anti-nuclear movement led by CND. &quot;Ban the Bomb&quot; marches became a very successful British social phenomenon.

Teenage music and subculture was parodied in the 1957 play (and 1962 movie) The Music Man, particularly in the song &quot;Ya Got Trouble&quot;.

In the United States and Australia, Hawaiian-influenced surfing was the new youth sport. A whole subculture grew around the sport and the associated parties, clothes, speech patterns and music. During the same time-frame skateboard riding developed as a parallel lifestyle to wave riding. Both forms of board riding continued throughout the remainder of the century and into the next. From these two sports young people learned to provide their own social structure within which they could display skills and excellence.

In the Congo Free State (now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo), a youth subculture known as the Bills flourished, taking Western movies and cowboys as their main influence.

In the Netherlands, two youth groups evolved in big cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht. One group, the Nozems, similar to the British Teds, and another called the Artistiekelingen, who can be compared to the bohemian artists of pre-world-war France. The Nozems spent their time listening to rock and roll music, driving motorcycles through town and picking up ladies while the Artistiekelingen would discuss philosophy, paint, draw and listen to jazz music.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, the &quot;beats&quot; (AKA &quot;beatniks&quot;) grew to be an even larger subculture, spreading around the world. Other 1960s subcultures included radicals, mods, rockers, bikers, hippies and the freak scene. One of the main transitional features between the beat scene and the hippies was the Merry Pranksters&#x27; journey across the United States with Neal Cassady and Ken Kesey, in a psychedelically painted school bus named Further. In the US, the hippies&#x27; big year was 1967, the so-called summer of love.

The rude boy culture originated in the ghettos of Jamaica, coinciding with the popular rise of rocksteady music, dancehall celebrations and sound system dances. Rude boys dressed in the latest fashions, and many were involved with gangs and violence. This subculture then spread to the United Kingdom and other countries.

The mod subculture began with a few cliques of trendy teenage boys in London, England in the late 1950s, but was at its most popular during the early 1960s. Mods were obsessed with new fashions such as slim-cut suits; and music styles such as modern jazz, rhythm and blues, soul, ska, and some beat music. Many of them rode scooters.

The mod and rude boy cultures both influenced the skinhead subculture of the late 1960s. The skinheads were a harder, more working class version of mods who wore basic clean-cut clothing styles and favoured ska, rocksteady, soul and early reggae music.

The disco scene originated in the 1960s, with discothèques such as the Whisky a Go Go and Studio 54.

Subcultures were often based on socializing and wild behaviour, but some of them were centred around politics. In the United States, these included the Black Panthers and the Yippies. Allen Ginsberg took part in several protest movements, including those for gay rights and those against the Vietnam War and nuclear weapons. In Paris, France in May 1968, there was a university student uprising, supported by Jean-Paul Sartre and 121 other intellectuals who signed a statement asserting &quot;the right to disobedience.&quot; The uprising brought the country to a standstill, and caused the government to call a general election rather than run the risk of being toppled from power.

The Hacker culture was beginning to form in the 1960s, due to the increased usage of computers at colleges and universities. Students who were fascinated by the possible uses of computers and other technologies began figuring out ways to make technology more freely accessible. The international Happening and Fluxus movements also had its beginnings in the 1960s, evolving out of the Beat subculture.

===1970s===

In the 1970s, the hippie, mod and rocker subcultures were in a process of transformation, which temporarily took on the name of &quot;freaks&quot; (openly embracing the image of strangeness). A growing awareness of identity politics combined with the legalisation of homosexuality and a huge amount of interest in science fiction and fantasy forms of speculative writing produced the freak scene. Bands on the freak circuit cultivated an anti-capitalist, communal lifestyle. Freak bands like The Edgar Broughton Band or The Pink Fairies played at free festivals, spurning mainstream venues. The music/fashion subculture that became a commercial alternative to the freaks was glam rock. It was a continuation of the &quot;trendies&quot; of the 1960s mod culture, appealing to the androgynous trend of the 1970s.

At some point, some in the hacker/computer subculture took on the derogatory word &quot;geek&quot; with pride, in the same way the freaks had done. Computer usage was still a very inaccessible secret world to most people in those days, but many people were interested in computers because of their appearance in science fiction. The dream of one day owning a computer was a popular fantasy amongst science fiction fandom, which had grown from a minor subculture in the first half of the 20th century to a quite large contingent by the 1970s, along with horror fandom, comics fandom and fantasy freaks.

The skinhead subculture from the late 1960s continued into the 1970s, and some skinheads became influenced by the punk subculture. These skinheads became associated with the Oi! genre, and some skinheads became involved with far right politics, creating the white power skinhead scene (despite the fact that the original 1960s skinheads were influenced by black culture).

Disco, which had begun in gay dance clubs, became a significant from about 1975 onward. In some sectors, particularly in the New York City area, where disco had seemingly &quot;taken over&quot; all aspects of youth life, an aggressive counter-disco movement was born. New York area rock radio stations such as WPLJ and WPIX encouraged their listeners to destroy disco records and embrace rock and roll. Musically and lyrically, punk rock was the intentional antithesis of the disco scene, the progressive rock genre and the hippie subculture. Early punks played aggressive, quick-paced three-chord rock and roll songs.

Within the decay of the hippie subculture, some of the remaining branches of bikers progressively turned in metalheads with succeeding aesthetics of horror and violence of late 1960s that influenced progressive rock (hard rock) in the more obscure form of early heavy metal. Metalheads preserved the instituted use of long hair, took garments from leather culture of late 1970s and formed a culture on separatism and orthodoxy against mainstream.

In 1976, a hit song &quot;Convoy&quot; by C.W. McCall arrived in the pop charts and romanticised the Trucker and CB radio subculture. In 1978, the song inspired a film &quot;Convoy&quot; directed by Sam Peckinpah, and starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, Ernest Borgnine, and Burt Young. The word &quot;convoy&quot; and quotes from the song lyrics became part of a popular cultural image of people standing up for their freedom. Gradually, from the 1960s, 1970s and through into the 1980s, the cultural influences of the &quot;Merry Pranksters&quot;, the freak scene, the New Age movement and the &quot;Convoy&quot; idea seem to have coalesced into what became new age travellers.

Beginning around 1976, the anarcho-punk scene in the UK developed the band Crass and related bands, including The Poison Girls. The Crass Records label was an independent operation, enabling bands with an extremely raw sound to put out records when the major labels might not have bothered with them. Crass also organised gigs around the country for themselves and other bands, and campaigned politically for the anti-nuclear movement other causes.

Mods made a comeback in the late 1970s as a post-punk mod revival, inspired by The Jam and the British film &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.

In 1979, Usenet was created as a medium of communication over the, still very primitive, Internet of the time. The Usenet and the Bulletin board system (BBS) subculture would become increasingly significant over the next few decades.

Also in 1979, Papa Wemba, a Rumba star in Zaire/Democratic Republic of the Congo, Africa began to be the leader of the Sapeur (&#x27;Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes d&#x27;Élégance&#x27; thus &#x27;SAPE&#x27; for short), which he promoted as a youth cult. Papa Wemba&#x27;s music has been influenced by previous stars of Rumba music in Zaire (such as Papa Wendo) and also by his visits to Europe and by the appearance, in 1974, of James Brown at the &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;. Wemba said:
The Sapeur cult promoted high standards of personal cleanliness, hygiene and smart dress, to a whole generation of youth across Zaire. When I say well-groomed, well-shaven, well-perfumed, it&#x27;s a propriety that I am insisting on among the young. I don&#x27;t care about their education, since education always comes first of all from the family.
===1980s===

At the beginning of the 1980s, some of the followers of punk rock became bored with it and wanted to make it more stylish and introduce elements of glam. By 1981, this trend resulted in the development of the New Romantics, a group whose preferred music was synthesiser electropop. New Romantics tended to be slightly campy and fey, and visually there was an androgynous vibe to the subculture, regardless of the individual&#x27;s sexual orientation. Clothing styles demonstrated a return to the freak scene&#x27;s roleplay of fashions from previous eras or imagined future ones in order to use fashion to create a time warp. According to the music press at the time, the New Romantics identified themselves using a number of alternative terms including &quot;Futurists&quot; and &quot;the cult with no name.&quot;

Other punk rock followers took the genre and culture further underground, where it evolved into a faster, harder genre coined as hardcore punk. Along with the hardcore scene came the straight edge subculture. Straight edge is a lifestyle that advocates abstinence in relation to tobacco, alcohol and recreational drug use (especially psychoactive and stimulant drug use), and for some people, in relation to promiscuous sexual behavior.

Other former punks searching for a new direction around 1979 eventually developed into the nucleus of what became the goth subculture. The goths are a subculture of dark dress and gloomy romanticism. Unlike the New Romantics, goth has lasted into the 21st century. In the UK, goth reached its popular peak in the late 1980s.

In American urban environments, a form of street culture using freeform and semi-staccato poetry, combined with athletic break dancing, was developing as the hip hop and rap subculture. In jazz jargon, the word &quot;rap&quot; had always meant speech and conversation. The new meaning signified a change in the status of poetry from an elitist artform to a community sport. Rappers could attempt to outdo each other with their skillful rhymes. Rapping is also known as MCing, which is one of the four main elements of Hip hop: MCing, DJing, graffiti art, and breakdancing. From the early to mid-1980s, poetry culture in a broader sense caught the same kind of energy as rap and so began the first of the poetry slams. Poetry slamming became an irregular focus for the latest wave of poetry aficionados.

In 1985, Stonehenge Free Festival was disrupted by a massive police presence attempting to prevent the festival and break up the Peace Convoy. The resulting Battle of the Beanfield was the largest mass civil arrest in English history.

Free parties and raves began from the mid-80s and became a flourishing subculture. The music embraced by this subculture was electronic dance music which developed from techno, pioneered in Detroit and Chicago by people like Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, as well as electronic music, pioneered by Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage and others, taken by way of progressive rock bands like Hawkwind, filtered through the sounds of dub-reggae and the electropop bands like Kraftwerk and Depeche Mode and given a different twist via Art of Noise and early hip hop and recycled psychedelia. Towards the end of the 80s rave culture had diversified into different forms connected to music such as Acid House and Acid Jazz and would continue to diversify into the 90s. Rave culture thrived from the mid-80s to the end of the century and beyond.

The Usenet and BBS subculture had developed a subculture which involved its own forms of etiquette and behaviour patterns both social and anti-social and the phenomena of trolling, spamming, flaming etc. The computer subculture was also influenced by fictional subcultures in cyberpunk literature.

===1990s===

The term &quot;Generation X&quot; or &quot;Gen X&quot;, popularized by Douglas Coupland&#x27;s novel &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture&quot;, was used to describe the generation that followed the Baby Boom Generation, or those who came to adulthood in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the UK, the Britpop scene arose in the 1990s, influenced by the 1960s mods, the 1970s/1980s mod revival, and other British rock music and subcultural styles. On the West Coast of the United States became popular a style of alternative rock known as Grunge, pioneered by bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden and Mudhoney, which developed his associated subculture. One of the main technological developments of the 1990s was the World Wide Web. Running on the older infrastructure of the Internet, the web allowed small subcultures to grow into large global online communities. Online game communities, forums, chat rooms and Internet cafes became popular. The 1990s saw the rise of the anti-globalization movement. This was a response to the increased impact of globalisation and global capitalism. The anti-globalisation protest movement was accompanied by the fair trade movement.

==21st century==


Named in relation to Generation X, Generation Y or &quot;Echo Boomers&quot; (a reference to the fact that many of the parents of this generation had belonged to the Baby boomer generation) consisted of individuals that had come to adulthood during the 2000s. Subcultures that emerged or became popular in the first decade of the 21st century included Emo, Scene and Chav. The Emo subculture, rooted in the Post Hardcore genre of hardcore punk, changed over the years becoming more mainstream, following the commercial success in early &#x27;2000s. The contemporary hipster became prominent in the 2010s. On March 20, 2014, Alexis Petridis, a journalist for the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, claimed that subcultures were rapidly declining, with only Emos and metalheads having any visual significance.

Throughout the mid to late 2010s, subcultures splintered and merged due to the widespread accessibility of the internet and social media platforms. Many 2010s subcultures drew from previously existing groups - the popular &#x27;e-girl&#x27; subculture is seen as a modern spin on mid-2000s scene fashion. As part of their retrospective series on the 2010s, Dazed magazine described the impact of technology on subcultures; &quot;But [the internet] also gave us more; it gave us dozens upon dozens of scenes and movements, only recognisable to the highly trained eye. And the rules became less rigid: you could dress one way, and listen to totally different music.&quot; Modern subcultures include e-girls, Koreaboos, art hoes, hypebeasts, Instagram baddies, soft boys, skaters, and revivals of 1970s-1990s subcultures such as hippies, goths, punks, and grunge.

<text>Bank Muamalat Malaysia [[Berhad]] (Jawi: ) started its operations on 1 October 1999 with a combined assets and liabilities brought over from the Islamic banking windows of the then Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad, Bank of Commerce (M) Berhad and BBMB Kewangan.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Berhad, the second full-fledged Islamic bank to be established in Malaysia after Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, is poised to play its role in providing Islamic banking products and services to Malaysians, without regard to race or religious beliefs. The bank was based on a profit sharing model and its products weren&#x27;t linked to the Bank Indonesia discount rate, thus surviving to the 1997 Asian financial crisis which increased the mean interest rate of the other Indonesian banks.

DRB-HICOM holds 70% shares in the Bank while Khazanah Nasional Berhad holds the remaining shares.

<doc id="1197368" wikidata="Q628327" url="?curid=1197368" title="Lake Rakshastal">
<text>Lake Rakshastal (; ; ) is a saltwater lake in Tibet Autonomous Region, lying just west of Lake Manasarovar and south of Mount Kailash. The Sutlej River (also known by the Tibetan name Langqen Zangbo in this area) originates at Rakshastal&#x27;s northwestern tip. Rakshas Tal is at 4,575 metres above sea level whereas the Manasarovar is at 4,690 metres.

==Etymology==
The name of the lake literally means &quot;lake of the rakshasa&quot; in Sanskrit. It is also known as Ravan Tal, as it is considered to be the site of the penance performed by Ravana, the rakshasa king of Lanka.

In Buddhism, Lake Manasarovar, which is round like the sun, and Rakshastal, shaped as a crescent, are respectively regarded as &quot;brightness&quot; and &quot;darkness&quot;. Rakshastal is a saline lake. There is a short river named Ganga Chhu, which connects Lake Manasarovar with Rakshastal, believed to be created by rishis to add pure water from Manasarovar.

There are four islands in Rakshastal, named Topserma (Dose), Dola (the two biggest), Lachato (Nadzhado), and Dosharba. The islands are used by local people as winter pastures for their yaks.

In the Tibetan language, the lake is known as Lagngar Cho or Lhanag Tso, which means &quot;the dark lake of poison&quot;.

==Religious significance==
According to Hindu scriptures, Rakshastal was created by Ravana for the express purpose of garnering superpowers through acts of devotion and meditation to the god, Shiva, who resided on Mount Kailash. It was upon the banks of a special island in this lake that he would make a daily offering with one of his ten heads as a sacrifice to please Shiva. Finally, on the tenth day, Shiva was moved enough by his devotion to grant Ravana his wish to obtain superpowers.

As there are no plants or wildlife around the lake, its lifeless surroundings caused the Tibetans to refer it as &quot;the Ghost Lake&quot;. Visitors who approach the lake must be respectful to avoid inauspicious mishaps.

==Geography==
Rakshastal covers a total area of , at an altitude of . Though absent of nearby grasslands, the white cobbles, the hills and the island colored with dark red, and the deep blue lake water present another distinctive picture absent from many of the places more frequented by visitors. In 2004, Lake Manasarovar and Rakshastal were designated as a single Ramsar Wetland complex, under the name &#x27;Mapangyong Cuo&#x27;.

== Access ==

Lake Rakshastal lies right next to Lake Manasarovar, and is an integral part of the Kailash-Manasarovar pilgrimage.

<doc id="1197378" wikidata="Q712809" url="?curid=1197378" title="Hugh IV of Cyprus">
<text>Hugh IV (1293/1296 – 10 October 1359) was King of Cyprus from 31 March 1324 to his abdication, on 24 November 1358 and, nominally, King of Jerusalem, as Hugh II, until his death. The son of Guy, Constable of Cyprus (son of Hugh III of Cyprus), and Eschiva of Ibelin, Hugh succeeded his father as Constable of Cyprus in 1318, and later succeeded to the throne of Cyprus on the death of his uncle Henry II, since Henry II had no sons. He was a member of the House of Poitiers-Lusignan.

The Kingdom of Cyprus reached the peak of its power and prosperity during the reigns of Hugh IV and Peter I.
==Youth ==
Hugh was the son of Guy, a brother of King Henry II of Cyprus, and Eschiva, a member of the Ibelin family who had lost her lordship of Beirut to the Egyptian Mamluks shortly before marrying Guy in 1291. Hugh was three years old when his father died and was raised in the household of his uncle the king. In 1306 Henry was forced to relinquish effective power to the eldest of his brothers, Amalric, who was his heir presumptive. Amalric was found murdered in 1310, paving the way for Henry&#x27;s restoration. 

By the early 1310s, Henry was over forty, unmarried, and unlikely to have children. His last surviving brother, Aimery, in theory, stood to succeed him but was imprisoned for aiding Amalric from 1310 until his death in 1316. In 1318 the king made Hugh the constable of Cyprus, as Guy had once been. Rather than any of the sons of his brothers Amalric and Guy, the eldest of the king&#x27;s sisters, Maria, was the presumed heir until her death in 1322. She and Henry were both married into the Aragonese royal family, but neither had children. By the end of his reign Henry probably intended, though there is no concrete evidence, to be succeeded by Hugh. Henry&#x27;s surviving siblings, Alice and Helvis, however, had a stronger claim in law, as they were more closely related to Henry than Hugh was.

==Accession==
On 31 March 1324, when King Henry died, a hurried assembly of liege men swore to protect Hugh&#x27;s rights against any challengers. As Henry&#x27;s only male relative remaining in the kingdom, Hugh was an obvious candidate to become the new king. Henry was buried on 1 April, and at the meeting of the High Court the next day, Hugh claimed the throne. His spokesman laid out arguments for a male successor, either misunderstanding or delibarely misrepresenting earlier precedents. The vassals accepted Hugh&#x27;s claim in preference to his aunts Alice and Helvis. Hugh was crowned king of Cyprus on 15 April at the Cathedral of Saint Sophia in Nicosia. From Henry he also inherited the claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the last piece of which had been lost to Muslims in 1291. Since the city of Tyre (in modern-day Lebanon), where the kings of Jerusalem were traditionally crowned, had also been conquered, Hugh received the crown of Jerusalem in Famagusta, deemed the best alternative by the vassals and the clergy. Hugh thus inaugurated a new custom among the Cypriot kings. 

One of Hugh&#x27;s first acts upon his accession was having the High Court declare the forfeiture of the fiefs of all the vassals who had resisted his predecessor&#x27;s restoration. Henry had kept them imprisoned since 1318, but Hugh decided to confiscate their land and release them. His goal may have been depriving his uncle Amalric&#x27;s supporters of means to plot on behalf of Amalric&#x27;s sons. In 1325 Hugh attempted to heal the rift between his family, the Lusignans, and the Ibelins, who had opposed Henry, through arranged marriages.
==Dynastic policy==
Hugh&#x27;s first wife was Maria of Ibelin, daughter of Guy, the titular count of Jaffa. Hugh and Maria had a son, Guy. In 1318, after her death, Hugh obtained a papal dispensation to marry her distant kinswoman Alice of Ibelin, with whom he had at least eight children, of whom five reached adulthood. Having plenty of children enabled Hugh to forge dynastic links with Western European rulers, which his predecessors had little luck achieving.

In January 1330 Hugh had Guy marry Maria, daughter of Duke Louis I of Bourbon. Louis belonged to a cadet branch of the French Capetian dynasty and was thoroughly involved in the French plans for a crusade to recover the Holy Land. Hugh hoped that the marriage would strengthen his chances of gaining control over the Holy Land, especially against the claims of the Capetian House of Anjou, who had disputed the Lusignans&#x27; claim to the throne of Jerusalem since the 1270s. The outbreak of France&#x27;s Hundred Years&#x27; War with England in 1337 put an end to Louis&#x27;s hopes to lead a crusade. Guy began taking part in state affairs in the late 1330s and was made constable of Cyprus, but died in 1343.

Through three of his children Hugh reestablished the Cypriot ties to the royal family of Aragon, who ruled not only Aragon but also Sardinia, Sicily, the Balearic Islands, and Athens through various branches and who shared the Lusignans&#x27; enmity with the Angevin kings of Naples and the Republic of Genoa. In 1337 a dispensation was obtained for the marriage of Hugh&#x27;s daughter Eschiva to Ferdinand, a member of the Majorcan branch, and the marriage proceeded in 1340. Hugh and Ferdinand clashed so violently, however, apparently over Eschiva&#x27;s dowry, that King Peter IV of Aragon and Pope Benedict XII both warned Hugh of Aragonese reprisals should Ferdinand be harmed. Benedict simultaneously directed Ferdinand to be more temperate and deferential to his father-in-law. Ferdinand recorded Hugh&#x27;s slights and threats to him, violence against his household members, and attacks on the Franciscans. At some point after mid-1342, claiming to have been forcibly separated from her, Ferdinand left his wife and their daughter and moved back to Europe.

The second Aragonese match was secured in 1343, when Hugh&#x27;s 12-year-old son John married Constance of Sicily, the 40-year-old widow of both Hugh&#x27;s uncle Henry II and King Leo V of Armenia. Hugh may have hoped to salvage his relationship with the Aragonese as well as to save money by providing an income for John out of Constance&#x27;s Cypriot and Armenian dowers. Constance died within a few years. The first marriage of Hugh&#x27;s son Peter was likely also arranged with frugality in mind. By the time this wealthy and significantly older wife, Eschiva of Montfort, died, Peter was regarded as the heir apparent to the throne and his marriage could be used to further Hugh&#x27;s interests in foreign affairs. Thus was concluded the third and most significant Aragonese union, Peter&#x27;s marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Count Peter of Ribagorza, in 1353. Yet Hugh&#x27;s dynastic matches, however valuable they were to him, proved that he was not equal to the kings of France and Aragon, for his children could not marry into the kings&#x27; immediate families.

== Personality ==

Hugh&#x27;s reign is poorly recorded in historical sources and so he remains a little-known figure. Visitors to his island kingdom thought him pious and just, but his son-in-law portrayed him as a vicious tyrant. This appears to be corroborated by the king&#x27;s actions in 1349 when his sons Peter and John secretly and against his wishes left Cyprus for a visit to Western Europe. Hugh worked hard and spent a lot to retrieve them, whereupon he had them imprisoned at Kyrenia Castle until the pope intervened.

== Succession ==

After the death of his eldest son, Guy, in 1343, the problem of succession to Hugh IV was looming. The customs of both Cyprus and Jerusalem favored Peter, Hugh&#x27;s eldest surviving son, but Guy had left a son, Hugh, by Maria of Bourbon. Guy&#x27;s son and his maternal relatives claimed that Guy and Maria&#x27;s marriage contract contained a clause guaranteeing the rights of any son born to them to inherit the throne if Guy predeceased King Hugh. Pope Clement VI expressed his endorsement of the grandson&#x27;s claim provided that the clause existed, but the text of the contract as published by the 19th-century French historian Louis de Mas Latrie does not contain it. Hugh&#x27;s relationship with his daughter-in-law and grandson was poor. He refused to allow them to leave Cyprus until 1346, two years after the pope asked him to settle Maria&#x27;s dower and let her go. The payment of Maria&#x27;s dower remained contentious, and the king apparently ignored the pope&#x27;s requests to provide an income for her son.

On 24 November 1358, in an effort to pre-empt his grandson&#x27;s claim, Hugh IV had Peter crowned king of Cyprus. The coronation of an heir apparent had no precedent in Cyprus, but was common in earlier centuries in France and occurred in Jerusalem too. Hugh IV died on 10 October 1359.
==Issue==

<doc id="1197382" wikidata="Q6391685" url="?curid=1197382" title="Kent Cullers">
<text>Kent Cullers (July 21, 1949 – July 17, 2021) was an American astronomer, who was a manager of SETI&#x27;s Project Phoenix. In 2005, he retired from the SETI Institute.

== Early life and education ==
Cullers was born in July 1949 in El Reno, Oklahoma, the son of an oil field engineer. His birth was premature and to save his life he was placed in an incubator filled with pure oxygen. The excess oxygen damaged his retinas, leaving him totally blind. His father, a physicist, read astronomy books to Cullers as a child, influencing his later aspirations. He grew up in Temple City, California, where he was a highly ranked student. He first studied psychology at Pomona College, but against great resistance changed his major to physics midway through college. He received his PhD. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1980. He is the first totally blind physicist in the United States, and is believed to be the first astronomer who was blind from birth (although some astronomers have become blind in their old age, most notably Galileo Galilei).

== Career ==
Kent Cullers worked for NASA&#x27;s Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program upon graduating from Berkeley. From 1985 to 1990, he was the Targeted Search Signal Detection Team Leader with the SETI Institute. He developed advanced computer algorithms for detection of continuous and pulsed signals originating from distant Earth-like planets.

From 1990 to March 1994, he was the signal detection subsystem manager for the High Resolution Microwave Survey (HRMS) Project at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. He supervised the development of hardware and software for signal detection for HRMS. From 1993 to March 1994, Cullers led the SETI Research &amp; Technology effort and managed the upgrading and replication of all the digital data processing equipment for HRMS. NASA&#x27;s HRMS Project was cancelled by the United States Congress in October 1993, but Cullers still participated in Project Phoenix, the SETI Institute&#x27;s continuation of the Targeted Search portion of HRMS. He resigned from NASA in October 1995, and rejoined the SETI Institute as a senior scientist and project manager for Project Phoenix. Cullers retired from the SETI Institute in 2005. Minor planet 35056 Cullers is named in his honor.

== In popular culture ==
Cullers was the subject of a short documentary film produced by his wife, the photographer Lisa Powers. The character Kent Clark, portrayed by William Fichtner in the 1997 film &quot;Contact,&quot; was based on Cullers.

<doc id="1197392" wikidata="Q971623" url="?curid=1197392" title="Ballistic knife">
<text>A ballistic knife is a knife with a detachable blade that can be ejected to a distance of several meters/yards by pressing a trigger or operating a lever or switch on the handle. Spring-powered ballistic knives first appeared in books and press reports on Soviet and Eastern Bloc armed forces in the late 1970s. Commercially-produced ballistic knives briefly gained notoriety in the United States in the mid-1980s after they were marketed and sold in the United States and other Western countries. Since then, the marketing and sale of ballistic knives to civilians has been restricted or prohibited by law in several nations.

==Usage==
In its spring-propelled form, the blade of a ballistic knife is theoretically capable of being fired to an effective range of around 5 meters (about 16 feet) at a speed of 63 km/h (39 mph). Ballistic knives using compressed air or gas propulsion to fire the blade can be made somewhat more powerful, and do not suffer from spring fatigue over time.

In addition to spring, air, or gas propulsion, the blade of a ballistic knife may also be propelled by an explosive charge, such as a blank pistol cartridge.

==Development, usage, and laws==

===Soviet Union===
The first press reports of what became known as the ballistic knife appeared in the late 1970s in connection with the Soviet Union&#x27;s special operations forces. In his book &quot;Inside The Aquarium&quot;, Viktor Suvorov described a ballistic knife as part of a Soviet spetsnaz trooper&#x27;s equipment.

An NRS-2 combination knife/gun was designed and developed during the 1970s at the order of the Russian Ministry of Defence and KGB of the USSR. However, the NRS-2 was not in fact a ballistic knife, but a gun hybrid (instead of launching the blade, a small barrel aligned with the blade fires a non-standard 7.62mm bullet).

===United States===
Commercial versions of the ballistic knife first appeared in the US market in the mid-1980s. After hearing uncorroborated testimony from a congressional witness that ballistic knives could be used to defeat body armor typically worn by police officers, and witnessing a staged demonstration against a wood-backed target, Senator Alphonse D&#x27;Amato of New York introduced the &quot;Ballistic Knife Prohibition Act&quot;, a bill to ban sale or possession of ballistic knives. The bill eventually failed. However, after gaining the support of Senators Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, congressional support for a ban on import or possession of ballistic knives quickly gained traction. In September 1986 senators supporting the ballistic knife ban attached their bill to popular legislation designed to eradicate drug crops in foreign countries and halt international drug trafficking operations. The bill was subsequently enacted into law. The new federal statute prohibited future importation or possession of such knives in interstate commerce. Some individual states following the example set by the federal law and passed even tighter restrictions, sometimes banning ownership of the knives outright within their state.

Similar to conventional automatic knives, federal law makes ballistic knives with a spring-operated blade illegal to possess, manufacture, sell, or import &quot;in or affecting interstate commerce.&quot; This means they are illegal to import from outside the United States, as well as buy or sell over state lines, including possessing or making them &quot;with intent&quot; to sell over state lines. The federal law also makes it a separate crime to use or possess a ballistic knife during the commission of a federal crime of violence, with a minimum sentence of five years in a federal prison. Federal law does not prohibit the possession, manufacture, or sale of a ballistic knife within a state&#x27;s boundaries, and the individual laws of each state or territory must be consulted to determine whether possession, manufacture, or sale within a given state is legal (many states have statutes that regulate or prohibit the acquisition or possession of ballistic knives, and penalties vary from state to state). Like the federal switchblade law, an exception is made for sale to the United States Armed Forces within the confines of a contract, as well as possession by duly-authorized members of the Armed Forces in performance of their duty.

A ballistic knife with a blade propelled by an explosive charge falls outside the Federal law pertaining to these devices, but still may be restricted as this makes it a firearm subject to the Any Other Weapons (AOW) category of the National Firearms Act.

===United Kingdom===
Possession of ballistic knives and pilum knives is illegal under current legislation in the United Kingdom. and this has resulted in a tendency to interpret any bladed object of questionable status as falling within the definition of a prohibited knife. 

Whilst &quot;ballistic knives&quot; are not specifically mentioned in any legislation, the marketing, sale, transfer, or possession in a public place of a ballistic knife could be construed to be illegal under the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, the Knives Act 1997, the Criminal Justice Act 1988, and the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 imposes criminal penalties for anyone who manufactures, sells or hires, or offers for sale or hire, or lends or gives to any other person &quot;any knife which has a blade which opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in or attached to the handle of the knife.&quot; The Knives Act 1997 prohibits the marketing of knives as offensive weapons, while the Criminal Justice Act 1988 prohibits the carrying of blades or sharply pointed objects in a public place without &quot;good reason or lawful authority&quot;. Finally, the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 prohibits the possession in any public place of an offensive weapon without &quot;lawful authority or reasonable excuse.&quot; The term &quot;offensive weapon&quot; is defined under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 as: &quot;any article made or adapted for use to causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use&quot;. Under the Prevention of Crime Act, knives otherwise &#x27;exempt&#x27; from penalty under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 when carried for &quot;good reason or lawful authority&quot; may still be deemed illegal if authorities conclude the knife is being carried as an &quot;offensive weapon&quot; without &quot;lawful authority or reasonable excuse&quot;. &#x27;Lawful authority&#x27; means those occasions where people from time to time are required to carry weapons as a matter of governmental duty, such as police officers or members of the armed forces, not private persons, hence the &#x27;lawful authority&#x27; language cannot be relied upon to establish an exemption from prosecution of private individuals. Furthermore, as the ballistic knife was originally designed as an offensive weapon and given current prosecutorial directives, it may be difficult to establish &quot;reasonable excuse&quot; for carrying such a knife before a UK prosecutor or court, especially as the carrying of a knife in public for self-defence is not acceptable as a &quot;reasonable excuse&quot;. In the eyes of the law, claims of self-protection are presently viewed as an &quot;admission&quot; that the defendant intends to use the knife in violation of the law as an &quot;offensive weapon&quot; - albeit in a defensive manner, and in otherwise justifiable circumstances.

<doc id="1197406" wikidata="Q1932237" url="?curid=1197406" title="Moulton, Northamptonshire">
<text>Moulton is a large village in West Northamptonshire. The population of the civil parish at the 2021 Census was 5,491. 

The villages name is thought to be derived from &#x27;town of the mill&#x27;, or perhaps &#x27;Meleton&#x27; - meaning protected town, since the church, manor house and castle were all within bowshot. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it is spelt &#x27;Moltone&#x27;.

Moulton Parish Council won the Local Council Award Scheme Gold in 2024.

==Education==
There are many pre-school facilities in the village including playgroups and nurseries. Primary education in the village is provided by Moulton Primary School, although it is not uncommon for children to attend other primary schools in the local area, for example Overstone, Pitsford or Parklands primary schools.

Moulton School and Science College is a comprehensive school providing education for 11- to 18-year-olds, not only to those from Moulton but also to students from the surrounding villages - primarily Brixworth, Walgrave, and Overstone.

Moulton is home to Moulton College, an agricultural and trade orientated college.

== History ==

=== Roman Times ===
Moulton (or &quot;Multone&quot;, &quot;Muletone&quot;, or &quot;Moltone&quot;; see #Toponymy) has origins in Roman times. To the south of the village, a Roman Villa was excavated, and there are signs of earlier settlements at Round Spinney, where a stone circle was found. Two flint arrowheads, a scraper, and a few roman shards have been found in the parish. There are no Roman names for the village recorded - this shows it may have been a small farming settlement, part of a bigger district. 

=== Pre-Norman Period (Before 1066) ===
Moulton was an established settlement before the Norman Conquest. The principal estate in Moulton was held by &#x27;Aliric&#x27;, a Saxon landowner. The village had arable land, villeins (peasant farmers), and bordars (smallholders), indicating a well-functioning agricultural community. A mill is mentioned in the Domesday book, valued at 8d yearly. This mill was most likely situated in stream that runs through Moulton village (pictured), since it is described as &#x27;a small rivulet which rises in Overstone parish&#x27;, and runs into the River Nene &#x27;a few hundred yards above Boughton Mill&#x27;. This mill still survives today; halfway up spectacle lane, to the right, stands the mill house and stream.

== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Moulton&quot; likely derives from Old English settlements, with &quot;Mul&quot; possibly referring to a stream or mill, and &quot;tun&quot; meaning &quot;enclosure&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;. This means that the name &#x27;Multon&quot; literally meant &quot;Settlement by the mill (or stream)&quot;. In the domesday book, Moulton occurs as &quot;Multone&quot;, &quot;Muletone&quot;, and &quot;Moltone&quot;.

== Archeological Findings ==

=== Possible Manor House (SP 78606715) ===
Some 500m north of Manor Farm, on the right of Moulton Road, or 1km north-east of The Church, on clay at 114m above OD. The area is traditionally known as &#x27;Castle Hill&#x27; and may have been the site of the Manor House of the Fitz John family, who held land in Moulton in the 13th Century. Today, any remains have been destroyed by modern farming.

== Church ==
The Church of England parish church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul. It is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women. There has been a small church building in Moulton since the early 7th century, built of wood, but this was burnt down by invading Danes, was rebuilt, but again suffered the same fate. The invading Normans erected a building of stone, the beginning of today&#x27;s building. During the 19th century, during church renovation, the shaft of a stone Saxon preaching cross was discovered under the floor, which is now displayed in the south aisle. Moulton has a peal of twelve bells, one of three others within Peterborough Diocese, and one of about only one hundred or so in the world. During the 15th century there were four bells and in the succeeding centuries more were added, the latest two making up the twelve in 1993. Two of Moulton&#x27;s peal, hung in 1934, commemorate William Carey&#x27;s pastorate and residence in the village 1785–1789.

==Notable residents==
John Sanderson (1578/9-c.1653) was living at Moulton in 1606/7. He purchased a substantial quantity of land in the parish in 1629 and apparently remained there for much if not all of the rest of his life.

The village was the 18th-century home of William Carey. The church where he ministered, and the cottage in which he lived, are located at the west end of West Street. 

The village also has links with John Jeyes (of Jeyes Fluid fame) as Holly Lodge is found on the road from Moulton to Boughton (a building associated with the family). Holly Lodge has the &#x27;Implement gate&#x27; (c. 1955), which is iconic of the rural beginnings of Moulton.

==Amenities==
The stone-built Gothic Revival Style Methodist Chapel of 1835 with arched windows is next to the old school of 1878, now used by the Moulton Theatre.

Moulton Community Centre is a recent development consisting of a library, cafe, a pre-school, and halls for hire, with their largest room hosting up to 120 people.

The centre of Moulton houses the parish church, a shop and a number of parks, &quot;The Public Gardens&quot;, &quot;Busby&#x27;s Meadow&quot; and &quot;Crow Fields Common, a nature reserve managed by Moulton Parish Council. The latter being a popular dog-walking route.

The local Co-Op store was run by the Moulton Co-operative Society, an independent society and one of Britain&#x27;s smallest until its merger with Midlands Co-operative Society in 2009.

Moulton is home to a number of pubs including the iconic &quot;Cardigan Arms&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Artichoke&quot;, and a working men&#x27;s club. 

Moulton also contains, on its fringe, the Northampton Fire and Rescue Service Headquarters, located on Moulton Way next to Smurfit Kappa and near Moulton Park.

==Geology==
The geology of Moulton is based on sedimentary rocks known as Oolite. Cornbrash, Inferior and Great Oolite rocks have dictated that the soils of Moulton are predominantly sands and clays, but small quantities of ironstone may be found. This ironstone was used extensively for construction of buildings in and outside of Moulton. Moulton&#x27;s elevation lies at 400–600 ft above sea level and the nature of the soil means that it is relatively free of flooding and drains well without becoming too dry. The alluvial nature of the soil means that it is fertile and can be used to grow a wide range of plants.

==Geography==
Moulton has a population of over 5,000, and ever growing with new developments along the outskirts of the village. It is situated about north of Central Northampton. Moulton has been affected by the expansion of Northampton, new build developments and expanding borders, yet retains a village identity. 

The boundaries of Moulton extend from Pitsford reservoir in the north to Moulton Lane in the south. In the east, the A43 (Kettering Road) is the border, with a small quantity of land that adjoins the east side of the A43 near Ashley Lane. The western fringe corresponds with all land east of Spectacle Lane.

The topography of Moulton is generally flat, but the gradient of land runs from a higher southern elevation in towards lower parts, in the village centre, and then elevates again in a northern direction. At the northern boundary the lower elevations of the reservoir are separated from the village by a strip of high ground.

In the village centre, a tributary of the Nene river flows from the east of the village in a westerly direction where it joins the Nene near Chapel Brampton. Medieval fish ponds in the village were fed from this tributary.

Crowfields Common is part of Moulton village and boasts a range of wildlife and plants. Boughton Lane Pocket Park on the southern end of Moulton is another source of animal and plant biodiversity.

The A43 Moulton Bypass provisionally opened on 6 February 2020, removing through traffic from the village. Travelling northbound, you get views of Overstone Hall and Overstone School.

== Moulton Festival ==
Moulton Festival is an annual festival (&quot;or fete)&quot; held in the summer of every year by Moulton Parish Council. The first festival took place in 1972, and was originally held to raise funds for refurbishment of the bells at the parish church. The vicar at the time, Reverend Roy Cattell, and the captain of the bellringers, Barry Care, planned a new village festival that combined three of the existing village traditions: The May Queen, The Carnival Parade, and the annual Church Fete.

In modern times, the festival has grown into an event that brings in people from around Northamptonshire, including adjacent villages such as Overstone, Sywell, and Holcot. The local Morris Men take part in a dance at the festival.
