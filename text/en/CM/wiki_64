<doc id="1214846" wikidata="Q622305" url="?curid=1214846" title="Alexandru Vaida-Voevod">
<text>Alexandru Vaida-Voevod or Vaida-Voievod (27 February 1872 – 19 March 1950) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian politician who was a supporter and promoter of the union of Transylvania (before 1920 part of Hungary) with the Romanian Old Kingdom. He later served as 28th Prime Minister of Romania.

==Transylvanian politics==
Vaida-Voevod was born to a Greek-Catholic family in the Transylvanian village of Alparét, Austria-Hungary (, today Bobâlna, Romania). He studied at the Lutheran Gymnasium in Bistrița. Initially, Voevod was supportive of a plan to federalize the domains of the Habsburgs along the lines of a &quot;United States of Greater Austria&quot;, and was close to Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

In 1906, Vaida-Voevod joined a group of Romanian nationalists in the Budapest Parliament (the Romanian National Party of Transylvania and Banat), becoming an important opponent of the Hungarian governmental policy of Magyarization, and fought for the right of Transylvania to self-determination. Disappointed by the Austrian cause after Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s assassination in Sarajevo, and turned towards an advocacy of Transylvania&#x27;s union with Romania.

===Union with Romania===
In October 1918, United States President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points were published in the German press. While in his native village of Olpret, Vaida-Voevod read about the Wilsonian principles in a newspaper from Munich, which made him realize that instead of demanding the federalization of Austria-Hungary, the only valid alternative was to push towards the union with the Romanian Kingdom. He drafted quickly a proposal in that respect and went to his good friend Iuliu Hossu in Gherla to seek his advice. Pondering over the words in the draft, they decided to replace the most radical proposal with the following generic statement: &quot;Starting now, whatever the Great Powers will decide, the Romanian nation from Hungary and Transylvania is determined to rather perish than to endure slavery and subjugation any further&quot;.

On 18 October 1918, Vaida-Voevod presented this proposal in the Hungarian Diet, asking for the right to self-determination of the Romanians in Hungary. He began his discourse in a dull tone, then he suddenly read the declaration of self-determination, to the shock of his fellow deputies, who started to throw objects at him. Having prepared his exit in advance, Vaida-Voevod narrowly escaped lynching by leaving quickly through a back door of the Parliament building and hiding in a workers&#x27; neighborhood in Budapest, where many ethnic Romanians lived.

In December 1918, after the Aster Revolution when Hungary had become a republic, Vaida-Voevod was elected in the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia that proclaimed the union with Romania, and was, alongside Vasile Goldiș, Iuliu Hossu, and Miron Cristea, a member of the Transylvanian group of envoys that presented the decision to King Ferdinand I in Bucharest.

==In Romania==

Vaida-Voevod joined the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and was one of its most prominent members throughout the negotiations, as an organizer of press campaigns. During the conference, he joined the Masonic Grand Orient de France in order to secure a more advantageous position for his country.

===First Term as Prime Minister===
The elections of November 1919 were successful for his party, and Vaida-Voevod replaced the National Liberal Ion I. C. Brătianu as prime minister and Nicolae Mișu as foreign minister. He secured the demarcation lines by ordering Romanian troops to fight off the Hungarian Soviet Republic. However, Vaida-Voevod&#x27;s radical approach toward the land reforms made King Ferdinand dissolve his government in March 1920, to be replaced by one formed by General Alexandru Averescu&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party (a populist movement that had attracted Brătianu&#x27;s conditional support). Vaida-Voevod&#x27;s party emerged as the National Peasants&#x27; Party in 1926, and he served as its leader. He also served twice as Interior Minister (1928–1930 and 1932).

===Second and Third Cabinet===

Vaida-Voevod&#x27;s second cabinet existed from 11 August until 17 October 1932; he resigned and was succeeded by Iuliu Maniu. After Maniu resigned as prime minister in January 1933, Vaida-Voevod returned as prime minister.

&quot;Vaida and his supporters, who formed the National Peasants&#x27; Party&#x27;s right wing, were acting more like Liberals than Peasantists. They crushed strikes by oil workers in Ploiești and by railway workers in Bucharest in February 1933, dissolved Communist Party front organizations and all other &#x27;anti-state&#x27; organizations, and proclaimed martial law in a number of cities.&quot;

Nonetheless, the problems posed by his new cabinets (in 1932 and 1933) – the Legionary Movement&#x27;s intimidation of the political scene, and Vaida-Voevod&#x27;s own antisemitism (which began to manifest itself in measures of repression encouraged by the Legionaries), led to a split between the prime minister and his Party. His second government fell because of Armand Călinescu, who was a staunch opponent of the Legionary Movement.

==Later==

On 25 February 1935, Vaida-Voevod created his own movement, the Romanian Front, which survived through the increasingly authoritarian regime of King Carol II, the National Legionary State, Ion Antonescu&#x27;s regime and most of World War II. It was dissolved after King Michael&#x27;s Coup of August 1944, when the Romanian Communist Party started gaining influence with Soviet backing. Nevertheless, the party never eluded obscurity in front of competition from the Legionaries, and its members were victims of the repression carried out by the communist regime after 1948. Vaida-Voevod was arrested on 24 March 1945. In 1946, he was put under house arrest in Sibiu, where he spent the remainder of his life. He died four years later.

<doc id="1214849" wikidata="Q1470689" url="?curid=1214849" title="I Robot (album)">
<text>I Robot is the second studio album by British rock band the Alan Parsons Project, released on 8 July 1977 by Arista Records. The album draws conceptually on author Isaac Asimov&#x27;s science fiction &quot;Robot&quot; stories, exploring philosophical themes regarding artificial intelligence. 

== Background and concept ==
The album was intended to be based on the &quot;I, Robot&quot; stories written by Asimov, and Eric Woolfson spoke with Asimov himself, who was enthusiastic about the idea. As the rights already had been granted to a TV/movie company, the album&#x27;s title was altered slightly by removing the comma in &quot;I,&quot; and the theme and lyrics were made to be more generically about robots rather than to be specific to the Asimov universe. The cover inlay reads: &quot;I Robot... The story of the rise of the machine and the decline of man, which paradoxically coincided with his discovery of the wheel... and a warning that his brief dominance of this planet will probably end, because man tried to create robot in his own image.&quot; The title of the final track, &quot;Genesis Ch.1 v.32&quot;, follows this theme by implying a continuation to the story of Creation, since the first chapter of Genesis only has 31 verses.

According to the band&#x27;s website, Paul McCartney unintentionally helped to inspire the song &quot;Some Other Time&quot;. When Parsons had asked if McCartney could read a line of poetry for the band&#x27;s first album in exchange for a favor Parsons had previously done him, McCartney replied by saying; &quot;Some other time Alan, some other time&quot;. This gave the band an idea for a song title.

By pure coincidence, the album was released shortly after &quot;Star Wars&quot; came out in the United States. The group acknowledges that part of the album&#x27;s success came from it being the only album with a robot on the cover during a time when robots were suddenly &quot;all the rage&quot;.

==Artwork==
The artwork was created by the English art design group Hipgnosis. The album cover photo features Storm Thorgerson&#x27;s assistants in the escalator tubes of the circular Terminal 1 building of the Charles de Gaulle Airport outside of Paris. The picture was taken without the permission of the airport management. Over this is superimposed a painting of a robot with a stylised atom for a brain. The robot also appears on the label of the record. The original vinyl release has a gatefold-style cover; the inside spread has the lyrics and a monochrome photograph of Parsons. The pose and angle of the photograph echoes that of the robot on the front cover.

==Singles==
Three singles were released from the album: &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Want to Be Like You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let it Show&quot; and &quot;Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)&quot;. The LP track &quot;Breakdown&quot; went into heavy rotation on AOR stations and continues to be played on classic rock radio.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;really ingenious use of the possibilities of the modern recording studio,&quot; but concluded that &quot;the overall esthetic is still a flatulent one, self-importantly preening itself as art.&quot;

==Reissues==
&quot;I Robot&quot; has been reissued multiple times in various formats since its initial release on vinyl, including numerous audiophile releases. Besides the 8-track, vinyl and compact-cassette releases, Arista also released the original aluminum CD along with the rest of the Project albums, up to that time. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) released the album on standard vinyl (MFSL 1-084), UHQR vinyl (MFQR 1-084), Ultradisk One-Step vinyl (UD1S 1-041), and on aluminium CD (MFCD-1-804). Classic Records has released the album in analogue form on 180-gram vinyl, as well as digitally on HDAD (24 bit/192 kHz DVD-Audio and 24 bit/96 kHz DVD-Video). JVC released the album as a K2 edition, with &quot;Ammonia Avenue&quot; and &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;. In 2007, as part of a larger campaign, Sony released a remastered version along with bonus tracks on CD. It was later released in Japan as an SHM-CD, with the same mastering.

The album was re-released under Legacy Recordings as a &quot;legacy edition&quot; in 2013 on CD, with an extra disc with unreleased bonus tracks, mastered by Dave Donelly. There was also a vinyl edition with the same mastering launched one month later.

<text>Idrettsklubben Start (or simply IK Start, translates to The sports club Start) is a Norwegian football club from the city of Kristiansand that currently plays in the Norwegian First Division, the second tier of the Norwegian football league system. The club was founded on 19 September 1905. The club&#x27;s current head coach is Azar Karadas. The team plays in yellow jerseys, black shorts and socks at home, and black jerseys, yellow shorts and socks away.

They play their home matches at Sør Arena, the club&#x27;s own football stadium, opened in 2007. Before moving to Sør Arena, IK Start played their games at Kristiansand Stadion. The team&#x27;s official supporter club was called &quot;Tigerberget&quot;, until 2017, when the IK Start board decided to no longer have an official supporter club.

==History==
Start were Norwegian champions in 1978 and 1980. They participated in the European Cup in 1979 and 1981, as well as being qualified for the UEFA Champions League 2006–07. The years since 1995 have been turbulent, but recent investments have given greater expectations for the future. In 2004 they won the Norwegian 1. divisjon and were promoted to the top flight.

In 2005 they reached second place, following Vålerenga, after a strong comeback season in the Tippeligaen. For this, Start earned a place in the UEFA Cup 2006.

In 2006, after beating Skála of the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying round of the UEFA Cup, and Drogheda United of Ireland in the second qualifying round (after penalties), they reached the first round of the UEFA Cup, where they were knocked out by Ajax of the Netherlands.

2007 was a bad year for Start, with problems working as a team and management issues. It led to a disappointing 13th place, leading to Start&#x27;s relegation to 1. divisjon. In 2008 the club got financial problems. The local government saved the club from bankruptcy. The financial difficulties has plagued Start for several seasons, due to the financial crisis and the Norwegian footballteams overspending, Start being no exception. The last couple of seasons, Start has downsized and saved money, for example by changing the turf on Sør Arena, the hopes being that the savings will keep the wheels turning in Start.

Ahead of the 2009 season, Knut Tørum was appointed head coach of Start. The next two seasons, Start was positioned at the lower half of Tippeligaen although achieving some strong results, like being the only team to beat Rosenborg in 2009, at Rosenborgs homeground Lerkendal, delaying their gold celebration. On 22 June 2011, Start had 13 points in 12 matches, and Tørum decided to resign hours before a cup-match against Strømsgodset, a match Start won without Tørum. Mons Ivar Mjelde replaced Tørum as head coach, but was not able to save Start from relegation. Start started the 2012 1. divisjon in strong fashion, leading the division and winning important matches and won promotion at the end of the season.

Start defeated Stabæk 4–1 on 4 July 2015. From 12 July 2015 to 18 September 2016, Start played 39 consecutive games without a win in Tippeligaen. This is the longest run without winning a single game across any top division in Europe.

Since the club was founded in 1905, the club badge had been a blue and white pennant. In November 2017, the badge was replaced with a more modernised version in all black. The new crest was in use for four years, before Start decided to return to the old one in March 2022.

<text>Gerald Götting (9 June 1923 – 19 May 2015) was a German politician and chairman of the East German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 1966 until 1989. He served as President of the People&#x27;s Chamber (&quot;Volkskammer&quot;) from 1969 to 1976 and deputy chairman of the State Council of East Germany from 1960 to 1989.

==Life==
Götting was born in Nietleben, in the Prussian Province of Saxony, today part of Halle/Saale. During World War II, he served in the Reichsarbeitsdienst, an auxiliary support and supply organization, and later in the Wehrmacht. He was briefly held as a prisoner of war by US forces in 1945.

In 1946, Götting joined the East German Christian Democratic Union, a Christian-democratic party. He then spent two years at the Martin Luther University of Halle, where he studied German studies, history and philology.

In 1949, Götting became General Secretary of the CDU and, after the establishment in the Soviet Zone of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), was elected as a member of the People&#x27;s Chamber (Volkskammer), the East German legislative body, in which he served for the next forty years. A loyal supporter of the Communist Socialist Unity Party, Götting helped push out those CDU members not willing to do the SED&#x27;s bidding in the 1950s.

Over the years, Götting came to hold a number of influential positions within the East German state: from 1949 to 1963, he served as the Chairman of the CDU faction in the People&#x27;s Chamber; from 1958 to 1963 as Deputy Prime Minister of the GDR; and from 1963 to November 1989 Götting served as Deputy Chairman of the Council of State, a position equivalent in rank to the vice-presidency of the GDR. Götting also served as Chairman of the People&#x27;s Chamber from 1969 to 1976 and as its Vice-Chairman from 1969 to 1989. Finally, Götting was elected Chairman of the CDU at its 1966 party congress. As chairman, he worked closely with the other parties that formed the National Front, the SED-dominated alliance that governed East Germany. During his party leadership, he published brochures exploring the relationship between Christianity and socialism.

Götting held a number of other positions in East German society. From 1961 to 1969, Götting was Vice-President of the German-African Society, and from 1963 he was a member of the Albert Schweitzer Committee. He visited with Schweitzer twice, which meetings he recorded and publicized in his book “Begegnungen mit Albert Schweitzer“. In 1976, Götting was elected Chairman of the People&#x27;s Friendship League of the GDR.

On 2 November 1989, just days before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Götting was forced to resign as Chairman of the CDU. Five days later he stepped down from his position as a member of the Council of State, too. In December Götting was arrested, but released in February 1990.

On 19 May 2015 Götting died in Berlin, aged 91.

<doc id="1214861" wikidata="Q5592531" url="?curid=1214861" title="Grafton Correctional Centre">
<text>The former Grafton Gaol, later called the Grafton Correctional Centre and then Grafton Intake and Transient Centre is a heritage-listed former medium security prison for males and females, located in , Clarence Valley Council, New South Wales, Australia. The centre was operated by Corrective Services NSW an agency of the Department of Attorney General and Justice of the Government of New South Wales. In its last correctional use, the centre detained sentenced and remand prisoners under New South Wales and/or Commonwealth legislation. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

==History==

The current Grafton Gaol complex is the third gaol to be constructed to serve the town of Grafton. Correctional facilities were first established in Grafton in 1862 under the supervision of the Office of the Sheriff accommodating up to 48 inmates. A second complex was established but did not contain the required number of cells, was floodprone and unhygienic.

A permanent facility was not established until 1893. During the early 1890s, the design of public buildings was not automatically given to the Government Architect, but was open to competition. Sydney architect Henry Austin Wilshire won the Grafton Gaol competition with a design following trends already evident in the gaols designed by the Colonial Architect. The design consisted of a square compound, with brick walls, with an elaborate gatehouse, featuring a machicolated parapet, a sandstone archway and elaborate panelled doors. The gaol was built by the Holloway Bros. and proclaimed on 8 September 1893. Prisoners were transferred to the new facility in November of the same year.

By 1924, the gaol had been reclassified as a maximum security prison; reverted to medium security by about 1945. After 1942, increasing tensions in the state&#x27;s prisons and a number of serious assaults on prison officers led to Grafton Gaol being used to house the most prisoners.

Riots at Bathurst and problems at other correctional facilities during the 1970s resulted in the appointment of Justice John Nagle to conduct a Royal Commission to oversee reforms to the Australian penal system. As best described by Justice Nagle during proceedings of the Nagle Royal Commission (1976–1978):
Accepting the Nagle Report in 1978, the Wran Labor government began prison reform under the leadership of Dr Tony Vinson.

The Grafton Gaol was officially abolished by proclamation from 18 December 1991, and was converted to a Periodic Detention Centre in the same proclamation. The remaining prisoners were removed and the new centre received its first detainees on 8 May 1992. The gaol&#x27;s name was changed to the Grafton Correctional Centre.

==Later developments==
Inmates from the centre make padded, waterproof &quot;Street Swags&quot;, distributed by national charities to alleviate the hardship of homelessness.

In June 2010 an inmate was found bleeding to death in his cell. He died several days later in a Brisbane hospital. Serving time for traffic offences, a coronial inquest heard that threats were made against the prisoner&#x27;s life by his cellmate whose sleep was disturbed by snoring. Prison officials were criticised when CCTV footage revealed that the inmate&#x27;s calls for help were ignored by prison officers and the officers failed to render first aid.

In 2011 there was contention over the future of Grafton Correctional Centre, with some suggesting its closure or privatisation. The women&#x27;s wing was shut in November 2011, with female inmates transferred to the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre. In June 2012 the O&#x27;Farrell government decided to downgrade the facility to house up to 64 inmates who are taken into custody or are currently in custody and need to attend court in the Northern Rivers region.

Grafton Gaol closed in August 2019 as planned after a considerable investment was made in the nearby Clarence Correctional Centre, which was officially opened on 25 July 2020.

==Historic features==

Grafton Gaol Complex originally consisted of a square compound, with brick walls, with one elaborate gatehouse providing access for staff, visitors and prisoners alike. The gatehouse features a machicolated parapet, a sandstone archway and elaborate panelled doors. A Range building was constructed within the compound, adjacent to the gatehouse to provide facilities for the prison officers and visitors. A sterile zone separated the cell ranges from the prison walls. Male and female prisoners were completely segregated with separate cell ranges, exercise yards, bath houses and hospital facilities. The (former) male cell range is largely intact. Workshop and kitchen facilities were incorporated in a new range adjacent to the male cell block. The Prison Governor&#x27;s residence (now Administration block) was located outside the compound wall, adjacent to the main gatehouse. This building features polychromatic brickwork, tuck pointing and some sandstone detailing. Brick, with a sandstone trim and terracotta tiles, all characteristic materials of the Federation period, were used throughout the complex, the level of detail depending on the function of the building. The complex has been extended to one side. New watch towers have been built however elements of the original towers remain intact.

== Heritage listing ==
The Grafton Gaol complex is significant as it demonstrates the development of the philosophy regarding prison architecture in NSW and the confinement of prisoners in the late nineteenth century. It is one of few gaol complexes designed by private architects in Australia. It is one of few known examples of the work of Henry Wiltshire. It continues the features of gaol design developed by the Colonial (later Government) Architects branch. It is one of the few public buildings designed by competition in the late nineteenth century; its design utilises characteristic materials of the Federation period. Its construction is related to the growth and expansion of Grafton.

Grafton Correctional Centre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

<doc id="1214871" wikidata="Q537519" url="?curid=1214871" title="Friedrich Martens">
<text>Friedrich Fromhold Martens, or Friedrich Fromhold von Martens, ( – ) was a diplomat and jurist in service of the Russian Empire who made important contributions to the science of international law. He represented Russia at the Hague Peace Conferences (during which he drafted the Martens Clause) and helped to settle the first cases of international arbitration, notably the dispute between France and the United Kingdom over Newfoundland. As a scholar, he is probably best remembered today for having edited 15 volumes of Russian international treaties (1874–1909).

==Biography==
Born to ethnic Estonian parents at Pärnu in the Governorate of Livonia of Russian Empire, Martens was later raised and educated as a German-speaker. He lost both parents at the age of nine and was sent to a Lutheran orphanage in St. Petersburg, where he successfully completed the full course of studies at a German high school and in 1863 entered the law faculty of St. Petersburg University. In 1868, he started his service at the Russian ministry of foreign affairs. In 1871, he became a lecturer in international law in the university of St. Petersburg, and in 1872 professor of public law in the Imperial School of Law and the Imperial Alexander Lyceum. In 1874, he was selected special legal assistant to Prince Gorchakov, then imperial chancellor.

His book on &quot;The Right of Private Property in War&quot; had appeared in 1869, and had been followed in 1873 by that upon &quot;The Office of Consul and Consular Jurisdiction in the East&quot;, which had been translated into German and republished at Berlin. These were the first of a long series of studies which won for their author a worldwide reputation, and raised the character of the Russian school of international jurisprudence in all civilised countries.

First amongst them must be placed the great &quot;Recueil des traités et conventions conclus par la Russie avec les puissances etrangeres&quot; (13 volumes, 1874–1902). This collection, published in Russian and French in parallel columns, contains not only the texts of the treaties but valuable introductions dealing with the diplomatic conditions of which the treaties were the outcome. These introductions are based largely on unpublished documents from the Russian archives.

Martens&#x27; &quot;International Law of Civilised Nations&quot; is probably the best-known of his original works. It was written in Russian, a German edition appearing in 1884–1885, and a French edition in 1883–1887. It displays much judgment and acumen, though some of the doctrines which it defends by no means command universal assent. More openly biased in character are such treatises as:
*&quot;Russia and England in Central Asia&quot; (1879)
*&quot;Russia&#x27;s Conflict with China&quot; (1881)
*&quot;The Egyptian Question&quot; (1882)
*&quot;The African Conference of Berlin and the Colonial Policy of Modern States&quot; (1887)
In the delicate questions raised in some of these works Martens stated his case with learning and ability, even when it was obvious that he was arguing as a special pleader. Martens was repeatedly chosen to act in international arbitrations. Among the controversies which he sat as judge or arbitrator were: the &quot;Pious Fund Affair&quot;, between Mexico and the United States – the first case determined by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague – and the dispute between Great Britain and France over Newfoundland in 1891. He was the presiding arbitrator in the arbitration of the boundary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana which followed the Venezuela Crisis of 1895.

He played an important part in the negotiations between his own country and Japan, which led to the peace of Portsmouth (August 1905) and prepared the way for the Russo-Japanese convention. He was employed in laying the foundations for the Hague Peace Conferences. He was one of the Russian plenipotentiaries at the first conference and president of the fourth committee – that on maritime law – at the second conference. His visits to the chief capitals of Europe in the early part of 1907 were an important preliminary in the preparation of the programme. He was judge of the Russian supreme prize court established to determine cases arising during the war with Japan.

He received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford (D.C.L. October 1902 in connection with the tercentenary of the Bodleian Library), Cambridge, Edinburgh and Yale (LL.D. October 1901); he was also one of the runner-up nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1902. In April 1907, he addressed a remarkable letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on the position of the second Duma, in which he argued that the best remedy for the ills of Russia would be the dissolution of that assembly and the election of another on a narrower franchise. He died suddenly in June 1909.

==Ennoblement==

The date and circumstances of Martens&#x27; ennoblement are not clear. While it is undisputed that he called himself and was referred to as &quot;von&quot; or &quot;de&quot; Martens in publications since the early 1870s, this title might have been bestowed upon him either with one of the more distinguished Russian Orders, or with the title of a Privy Councillor (according to the Table of Ranks), or simply with his appointment as a full professor. He was never registered in the matriculae of the knightage of Livonia (&quot;Livländische Ritterschaft&quot;) or one of the other three Baltic knighthoods (that is of Estonia, Courland and Ösel). His surname, Martens, is included in the Russian Heraldic Book No. 14, though it is uncertain if this entry relates to him or to another noble of the same name. His social advancement was the more remarkable, as it was exclusively based on his professional merits.

==Popular culture==
* Friedrich Martens is featured as the main character in the novel &quot;Professor Martens&#x27; Departure&quot; (&quot;Professor Martensi ärasõit&quot;, 1984) by Estonian author Jaan Kross.

== Criticism ==

In 1952, the German émigré scholar in the US, Arthur Nussbaum, himself the author of a well-received history of the law of nations, published an article on Martens, which still &quot;makes waves&quot;.

Nussbaum set himself the task of analysing the &#x27;writings and actions&#x27; of Martens. First, he turned his attention to Martens&#x27; celebrated two-volume textbook and pointed out several pro-Russian gaps and biases in its historical part:

&quot;Flagrant lack of objectivity and conscientiousness. The Tsars and Tsarinas invariably appear as pure representatives of peace, conciliation, moderation and justice, whereas the moral qualities of their non-Russian opponents leave much to be desired.&quot;

Nussbaum pointed out that Martens gave an extensive meaning to the notion of &quot;international administrative law,&quot; even including war in the field of international administration, and emphasized that the supreme principle of international administrative law was expediency. Nussbaum was very critical of the application of that concept:

&quot;Expanding the range of international administrative law meant, therefore, expanding the dominance of expediency – which is the very opposite of law.&quot;

Further, Nussbaum turned his attention to the other (publicist) writings of Martens, mostly the ones published in &quot;Revue de droit international et de législation comparée&quot;. Nussbaum noted that they were invariably signed by de Martens as professor of international law at the University of St. Petersburg and as member of the Institut de Droit International. Martens did not mention his high position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The articles were thus only unrestrained briefs for various actions of the Russian government.

For example, Nussbaum concluded that the 1874 article by Martens on the Brussels conference, &quot;It is purely apologetic and has nothing to do with law.&quot;

Then, Nussbaum turned to Martens&#x27;s activities as arbitrator and found them &quot;most conspicuous.&quot; In particular, Nussbaum referred to a memorandum of Venezuelan lawyer Severo Mellet Provost that had been made public posthumously. The memorandum made the claim that Martens had approached his fellow US arbitrators-judges with an ultimatum: either they agreed with a generally pro-British solution or Martens, as umpire, would join the British arbitrators in a solution that would be even more against Venezuela. Nussbaum held that Mr Provost&#x27;s account seemed &quot;entirely credible in all essential parts&quot; and concluded:

&quot;The spirit of arbitration will be perverted more seriously if the neutral arbitrator does not possess the external and internal independence from his government, which, according to the conception of most countries of Western civilization, is an essential attrribute of judicial office. That independence de Martens certainly did not have, and it is difficult to see how he could have acquired it within the framework of the Tsarist regime and tradition.&quot;

Finally, Nussbaum concluded:

&quot;It appears that de Martens did not think of international law as something different from, and in a sense above, diplomacy.… de Martens considered in his professional duty as a scholar and writer on international law to defend and back up the policies of his government at any price.… Obviously his motivation was overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, political and patriotic. Legal argument served him as a refined art to tender his pleas for Russian claims more impressive or more palatable. He was not really a man of law...&quot;

<doc id="1214875" wikidata="Q596526" url="?curid=1214875" title="Stoke Bruerne">
<text>Stoke Bruerne is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England, about north of Milton Keynes and south of Northampton.

 The civil parish population at the 2011 Census was 373.

==History==
Stoke Bruerne is mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as &quot;Stoche&quot; meaning &quot;an outlying farmstead or hamlet&quot;. The form &quot;Stokbruer&quot; is used in 1254 being a suffix by the &quot;Briwere&quot; family of the Manor House. The village contains many traditional stone and thatched cottages. It is situated on the Grand Union Canal.

The parish is currently governed as part of West Northamptonshire. Before local government changes in 2021 it was part of Tove Ward, named after the River Tove, of the district council of South Northamptonshire.

The nearby country estate of Stoke Park along Shutlanger Road is occasionally open to the public in August, but all that remains of the main house are the two east and west wings known as Stoke Park Pavilions.

In December 2008, the conservation project won the East Midlands&#x27; Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) Award, alongside Foxton Locks, another major canal restoration project in Leicestershire, near Market Harborough.

==Culture and tourism==

===Walks===
Many public footpaths cross the area around Stoke Bruerne. One such walk, taking in Grafton Regis, was the subject of a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article. Other walks in and around Northampton are mentioned in the County Council Right of way site.

===Canal Museum===

The village is home to one of the three museums owned and run by Canal &amp; River Trust. The others are at Ellesmere Port and Gloucester Docks.

===Blisworth tunnel===

About half a mile north of the village is the south portal of Blisworth tunnel - accessible by a walk along the old towpath (on the eastern side of the canal - north of the village, the western side is either private property or inaccessible.) The tunnel is long and is the longest wide, freely navigable tunnel in Europe. The tunnel was awarded a Transport Trust &#x27;Red Wheel&#x27; in recognition of its industrial heritage and importance on 22-August-2014 (30th anniversary of the reopening of the tunnel in 1984). The Red Wheel is on the blacksmith&#x27;s forge in Stoke Bruerne.

===Facilities===
There are two canalside public houses, The Boat Inn, and The Navigation, both serving a variety of meals and drinks. There is a restaurant/takeaway, The Spice of Bruerne, various bed and breakfast facilities and tearooms. The village attracts many visitors all year round and especially during the summer months. There are parking restrictions at all times, except for residents, on village roads which are all marked with double yellow lines. There is, however, a pay and display car park close to the Museum (charge £3 or 50p after 6pm). The parking restrictions are strictly enforced. A variety of boat trips may be booked from the canalside. Most of the time there is plenty of activity on the canal with boats going through the locks regularly and plenty going in and out of the tunnel.

=== Cricket Club ===
The village has a cricket club with three sides competing in the Northamptonshire Cricket League, a Sunday side and a multiple junior sides. In 2014, Stoke Bruerne CC merged with a Northampton-based Spencer CC to form Spencer Bruerne Cricket Club.

==Conservation area consultation ==
In November 2007 the area of the village and surroundings, including Stoke Park, were the subject of an extensive conservation consultation by South Northants Council. Extensive additional documentation, including maps, pictures and historical documentation, is available from the South Northants Council&#x27;s Planning website.

==Railway==
Stoke Bruerne had its own railway station, part of the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway (SMJR) and misnamed Stoke Bruern. This ran close to the village over Blisworth tunnel near the south portal. The station building has been converted to a private house and is along the road to Blisworth just outside the village. The line of the railway, and station platform, are still visible and the Blisworth road has a railway bridge still in position near the former station. The railway ran east to join the West Coast Main Line and then into Bedfordshire.

==Film==
The village appears, with Blisworth, in the Ealing Studios film &quot;Painted Boats&quot; (1945), filmed at the end of World War II and directed by Charles Crichton.

<text>Universal language may refer to a hypothetical or historical language spoken and understood by all or most of the world&#x27;s people. In some contexts, it refers to a means of communication said to be understood by all humans. It may be the idea of an international auxiliary language for communication between groups speaking different primary languages. A similar concept can be found in pidgin language, which is actually used to facilitate understanding between two or more people with no common language. In other conceptions, it may be the primary language of all speakers, or the only existing language. Some religious and mythological traditions state that there was once a single universal language among all people, or shared by humans and supernatural beings.

In other traditions, there is less interest in or a general deflection of the question. The written Classical Chinese language 
is still read widely but pronounced differently by readers in China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan; for centuries it was a &quot;de facto&quot; universal &quot;literary&quot; language for a broad-based culture. In something of the same way Sanskrit in India and Nepal, and Pali in Sri Lanka and in Theravada countries of South-East Asia (Burma, Thailand, Cambodia) and Old Tamil in South India and Sri Lanka, were literary languages for many for whom they were not their mother tongue.

Comparably, the Latin language (&quot;qua&quot; Medieval Latin) was in effect a universal language of literati in the Middle Ages, and the language of the Vulgate Bible in the area of Catholicism, which covered most of Western Europe and parts of Northern Europe and Central Europe.

In a more practical fashion, trade languages, such as ancient Koine Greek, may be seen as a kind of &quot;real&quot; universal language, that was used for commerce.

In historical linguistics, monogenesis refers to the idea that all spoken human languages are descended from a single ancestral language spoken many thousands of years ago.

==Mythological and religious universal languages==

Various religious texts, myths, and legends describe a state of humanity in which originally only one language was spoken.

In Jewish and Christian beliefs, the story of the Tower of Babel tells of a consequent &quot;confusion of tongues&quot; (the splintering of numerous languages from an original Adamic language) as a punishment from God.

Myths exist in other cultures describing the creation of multiple languages as an act of a god as well, such as the destruction of a &#x27;knowledge tree&#x27; by Brahma in Indic tradition, or as a gift from the God Hermes in Greek myth. Other myths describe the creation of different languages as concurrent with the creation of different tribes of people, or due to supernatural events.

== Early modern history ==
Recognizable strands in the contemporary ideas on universal languages took form only in Early Modern Europe. In the early 17th century, some believed that a universal language would facilitate greater unity among mankind largely due to the subsequent spread of religion, specifically Christianity, as espoused in the works of Comenius. But there were ideas of a universal language apart from religion as well. A &quot;lingua franca&quot; or trade language was nothing very new; but an international auxiliary language was a natural wish in light of the gradual decline of Latin. Literature in vernacular languages became more prominent with the Renaissance. Over the course of the 18th century, learned works largely ceased to be written in Latin. According to Colton Booth (&quot;Origin and Authority in Seventeenth-Century England&quot; (1994) p. 174) &quot;The Renaissance had no single view of Adamic language and its relation to human understanding.&quot; The question was more exactly posed in the work of Francis Bacon.

In the vast writings of Gottfried Leibniz can be found many elements relating to a possible universal language, specifically a constructed language, a concept that gradually came to replace that of a rationalized Latin as the natural basis for a projected universal language. Leibniz conceived of a &quot;characteristica universalis&quot; (also see &quot;mathesis universalis&quot;), an &quot;algebra&quot; capable of expressing all conceptual thought. This algebra would include rules for symbolic manipulation, what he called a &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot;. His goal was to put reasoning on a firmer basis by reducing much of it to a matter of calculation that many could grasp. The &quot;characteristica&quot; would build on an alphabet of human thought.

Leibniz&#x27;s work is bracketed by some earlier mathematical ideas of René Descartes, and the satirical attack of Voltaire on Panglossianism. Descartes&#x27;s ambitions were far more modest than Leibniz&#x27;s, and also far more successful, as shown by his wedding of algebra and geometry to yield what we now know as analytic geometry. Decades of research on symbolic artificial intelligence have not brought Leibniz&#x27;s dream of a &quot;characteristica&quot; any closer to fruition.

Other 17th-century proposals for a &#x27;philosophical&#x27; (i.e. universal) language include those by Francis Lodwick, Thomas Urquhart (possibly parodic), George Dalgarno (&quot;Ars signorum&quot;, 1661), and John Wilkins (&quot;An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language&quot;, 1668). The classification scheme in Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus ultimately derives from Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;Essay&quot;.

&quot;Candide&quot;, a satire written by Voltaire, took aim at Leibniz as Dr. Pangloss, with the choice of name clearly putting universal language in his sights, but satirizing mainly the optimism of the projector as much as the project. The argument takes the universal language itself no more seriously than the ideas of the speculative scientists and &quot;virtuosi&quot; of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s Laputa. For the like-minded of Voltaire&#x27;s generation, universal language was tarred as fool&#x27;s gold with the same brush as philology with little intellectual rigour, and universal mythography, as futile and arid directions.

In the 18th century, some rationalist natural philosophers sought to recover a supposed Edenic language. It was assumed that education inevitably took people away from an innate state of goodness they possessed, and therefore there was an attempt to see what language a human child brought up in utter silence would speak. This was assumed to be the Edenic tongue, or at least the lapsarian tongue.

Others attempted to find a common linguistic ancestor to all tongues; there were, therefore, multiple attempts to relate esoteric languages to Hebrew (e.g. Basque and Irish), as well as the beginnings of comparative linguistics.

==Modern history==

The constructed language movement produced such languages as Esperanto (1887), Latino sine flexione (1903), Ido (1907), Interlingue (1922), and Interlingua (1951).

English remains the dominant language of international business and global communication through the influence of global media and the former British Empire that had established the use of English in regions around the world such as North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. However, English is not the only language used in major international organizations, because many countries do not recognize English as a universal language. For instance, the United Nations use six languages — Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.

The early ideas of a universal language with complete conceptual classification by categories is still debated on various levels. Michel Foucault believed such classifications to be subjective, citing Borges&#x27; fictional Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge&#x27;s Taxonomy as an illustrative example.

<doc id="1214879" wikidata="Q2746658" url="?curid=1214879" title="Visual anthropology">
<text>Visual anthropology is a subfield of social anthropology that is concerned, in part, with the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, new media. More recently it has been used by historians of science and visual culture. Although sometimes wrongly conflated with ethnographic film, visual anthropology encompasses much more, including the anthropological study of all visual representations such as dance and other kinds of performance, museums and archiving, all visual arts, and the production and reception of mass media. Histories and analyses of representations from many cultures are part of visual anthropology: research topics include sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings and photographs. Also within the province of the subfield are studies of human vision, properties of media, the relationship of visual form and function, and applied, collaborative uses of visual representations.

Multimodal anthropology describes the latest turn in the subfield, which considers how emerging technologies like immersive virtual reality, augmented reality, mobile apps, social networking, gaming along with film, photography and art is reshaping anthropological research, practice and teaching.

==History==
Even before the emergence of anthropology as an academic discipline in the 1880s, ethnologists used photography as a tool of research. Anthropologists and non-anthropologists conducted much of this work in the spirit of salvage ethnography or attempts to record for posterity the ways-of-life of societies assumed doomed to extinction (see, for instance, the Native American photography of Edward Curtis)

The history of anthropological filmmaking is intertwined with that of non-fiction and documentary filmmaking, although ethnofiction may be considered as a genuine subgenre of ethnographic film. Some of the first motion pictures of the ethnographic other were made with Lumière equipment (&quot;Promenades des Éléphants à Phnom Penh&quot;, 1901). Robert Flaherty, probably best known for his films chronicling the lives of Arctic peoples (&quot;Nanook of the North&quot;, 1922), became a filmmaker in 1913 when his supervisor suggested that he take a camera and equipment with him on an expedition north. Flaherty focused on &quot;traditional&quot; Inuit ways of life, omitting with few exceptions signs of modernity among his film subjects (even to the point of refusing to use a rifle to help kill a walrus his informants had harpooned as he filmed them, according to Barnouw; this scene made it into &quot;Nanook&quot; where it served as evidence of their &quot;pristine&quot; culture). This pattern would persist in many ethnographic films to follow (see as an example Robert Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Dead Birds&quot;).
By the 1940s and early 1950s, anthropologists such as Hortense Powdermaker, Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead (Trance and Dance in Bali, 1952) and Mead and Rhoda Metraux, eds., (&quot;The Study of Culture at a Distance&quot;, 1953) were bringing anthropological perspectives to bear on mass media and visual representation. Karl G. Heider notes in his revised edition of &quot;Ethnographic Film&quot; (2006) that after Bateson and Mead, the history of visual anthropology is defined by &quot;the seminal works of four men who were active for most of the second half of the twentieth century: Jean Rouch, John Marshall, Robert Gardner, and Tim Asch. By focusing on these four, we can see the shape of ethnographic film&quot; (p. 15). Many, including Peter Loizos, would add the name of filmmaker/author David MacDougall to this select group.

In 1966, filmmaker Sol Worth and anthropologist John Adair taught a group of Navajo Indians in Arizona how to capture 16mm film. The hypothesis was that artistic choices made by the Navajo would reflect the &#x27;perceptual structure&#x27; of the Navajo world. The goals of this experiment were primarily ethnographic and theoretical. Decades later, however, the work has inspired a variety of participatory and applied anthropological initiatives - ranging from photovoice to virtual museum collections - in which cameras are given to local collaborators as a strategy for empowerment.

In the United States, Visual Anthropology first found purchase in an academic setting in 1958 with the creation of the Film Study Center at Harvard&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In the United Kingdom, The Granada Centre for Visual Anthropology at the University of Manchester was established in 1987 to offer training in anthropology and film-making to MA, MPhil and PhD students and whose graduates have produced over 300 films to date. John Collier, Jr. wrote the first standard textbook in the field in 1967, and many visual anthropologists of the 1970s relied on semiologists like Roland Barthes for essential critical perspectives. Contributions to the history of Visual Anthropology include those of Emilie de Brigard (1967), Fadwa El Guindi (2004), and Beate Engelbrecht, ed. (2007). A more recent history that understands visual anthropology in a broader sense, edited by Marcus Banks and Jay Ruby, is &quot;Made To Be Seen: Historical Perspectives on Visual Anthropology&quot;. Turning the anthropological lens on India provides a counterhistory of visual anthropology (Khanduri 2014). More broadly, visual anthropology recently involves a call to make visual culture central to the exploration of social and political experience; to give primacy to the visual, against a conventional approach in the social sciences that treats the visual as secondary to written sources and discourse (Pinney 2005; Kalantzis 2019).

At present, the Society for Visual Anthropology (SVA) represents the subfield in the United States as a section of the American Anthropological Association, the AAA.

In the United States, ethnographic films are shown each year at the Margaret Mead Film Festival as well as at the AAA&#x27;s annual Film and Media Festival. In Europe, ethnographic films are shown at the Royal Anthropological Institute Film Festival in the UK, The Jean Rouch Film Festival in France, Ethnocineca in Austria and Ethnofest in Greece. Dozens of other international festivals are listed regularly in the &quot;Newsletter of the Nordic Anthropological Film Association [NAFA]&quot;.

==Timeline and breadth of prehistoric visual representation==
While art historians are clearly interested in some of the same objects and processes, visual anthropology places these artifacts within a holistic cultural context. Archaeologists, in particular, use phases of visual development to try to understand the spread of humans and their cultures across contiguous landscapes as well as over larger areas. By 10,000 BP, a system of well-developed pictographs was in use by boating peoples and was likely instrumental in the development of navigation and writing, as well as a medium of storytelling and artistic representation. Early visual representations often show the female form, with clothing appearing on the female body around 28,000 BP, which archaeologists know now corresponds with the invention of weaving in Old Europe. This is an example of the holistic nature of visual anthropology: a figurine depicting a woman wearing diaphanous clothing is not merely an object of art, but a window into the customs of dress at the time, household organization (where they are found), transfer of materials (where the clay came from) and processes (when did firing clay become common), when did weaving begin, what kind of weaving is depicted and what other evidence is there for weaving, and what kinds of cultural changes were occurring in other parts of human life at the time.

Visual anthropology, by focusing on its own efforts to make and understand visual representations, is able to establish many principles and build theories about human visual representation in general.

<doc id="1214884" wikidata="Q280565" url="?curid=1214884" title="AA-52 machine gun">
<text>The AA-52 (full designation in French: &quot;Arme Automatique Transformable Modèle 1952&quot;, &quot;Transformable automatic weapon model 1952&quot;) is one of the first French-produced guns of the post–World War II era. It was manufactured by the French government-owned Manufacture d&#x27;armes de Saint-Étienne (MAS) company. The AA-52 is still used today as a vehicle-mounted weapon due to large quantities in service, but has been replaced in the helicopter role by the Belgian FN MAG, starting with the EC 725 Caracal of the special operations units and the Air Force search and rescue teams. The AA-52 had been largely phased out for infantry use in favour of the lighter FN Minimi but remains in use.

==History==
The AA-52 general-purpose machine gun was conceived and developed following the French military&#x27;s experiences in the First Indochina War during the early 1950s. At that time, the French army was equipped with an assortment of weapons from British and American sources, as well as some German weapons from the Second World War.

Effective supply of ammunition and replacement parts was an almost insoluble task and the army decided to adopt a standard machine gun. The result was the AA-52, conceived for ease of production. The construction is of simple welded stamped sheet steel.

The AA-52 was partially withdrawn from the service of the French army in 2008. It was replaced in the 2010s by 10,881 FN MAG general-purpose machine guns.

==Design==
The AA-52 is a peculiar weapon among modern machine guns because it uses lever-delayed blowback operation, also seen in the FAMAS rifle, manufactured at the same factory. When firing, the pressure pushing the case head rearward initiates an impulse on a cam that sends the bolt carrier rearward. After a certain distance, a link (in this case the firing pin) pulls the bolt head, hence extracting the spent case. Since there is no primary extraction, the chamber is fluted to allow powder gases to flow back, unsticking the case from the chamber wall as with Heckler &amp; Koch–type roller-delayed blowback weapons.

The feed and trigger mechanisms are derived from the MG 42.

The AA-52 can be used as a light machine gun with a bipod or as a heavy machine gun with a tripod. When used with a tripod for continuous fire, the gun is fitted with a heavier barrel. In the light machine gun configuration, the AA-52 is a relatively light weapon to carry. The AA-52 can be fired from the shoulder, but this is slightly awkward because of the position of the handle; however, the bipod can be used as a handguard when not in use. The barrel is changed by pressing a latch and rotating it a quarter of a turn. The APX(SOM) telescopic sight used on the MAS-49 and the FR-F1 sniper rifle can be mounted on the AA-52 as well as an infrared night sight.

==Variants==
===NF-1===
The AA-52 originally used the standard 7.5×54mm French cartridge. The general adoption of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge reduced the opportunity for export sales, and the gun was adapted for this standard NATO calibre. The new, adapted gun was designated AANF-1 (also ANF-1 or NF-1).

===MAC-58===
The MAC-58 was a version of the AA-52 chambered in .50 BMG. A few prototypes were tested and one retained for preserial production, but it never reached production due to the large quantity of US M2 Browning machine guns already in service with the French armed forces.

<doc id="1214889" wikidata="Q1022143" url="?curid=1214889" title="James Ross Island">
<text>James Ross Island () is a large island off the southeast side and near the northeastern extremity of the Antarctic Peninsula, from which it is separated by Prince Gustav Channel. 
Rising to , it is irregularly shaped and extends in a north–south direction.
==Location==
James Ross Island is separated from Trinity Peninsula, at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula to the northwest, by the Prince Gustav Channel.
Vega Island is to the north of the island, separated from James Ross Island by the Herbert Sound.
Erebus and Terror Gulf is to the northeast.
Seymour Island and Snow Hill Island are to the southeast.
It is in the James Ross Island group.

The island was connected to the Antarctic mainland by an ice shelf until 1995, when the ice shelf collapsed, making the Prince Gustav Channel passable for the first time.

Mendel Polar Station, the first Czech Antarctic Base, is located on the island.

==Exploration and name==
James Ross Island was charted in October 1903 by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition (SwedAE) under Otto Nordenskiöld, who named it for Sir James Clark Ross, the leader of a British expedition to this area in 1842 that discovered and roughly charted a number of points along the eastern side of the island. The style, &quot;James&quot; Ross Island is used to avoid confusion with the more widely known Ross Island in McMurdo Sound.

== Paleontology ==
Two dinosaur-bearing formations are present on the island, both from the Upper Cretaceous: the Santa Marta Formation and the Snow Hill Island Formation. These are two of only three known formations to have dinosaur fossils in Antarctica.

The first dinosaur discovered in Antarctica was &quot;Antarctopelta oliveroi&quot;, a medium-sized ankylosaur found on James Ross Island by Argentinian geologists Eduardo Olivero and Roberto Scasso in 1986. The dinosaur was recovered from the Campanian stage of the Upper Cretaceous Santa Marta Formation, about south of Santa Marta Cove on the north part of the island. The ankylosaur was not formally named until 2006.

In December 2003, U.S. paleontologist Judd Case from Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California and U.S. geologist James Martin from the South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology discovered the bones of a theropod dinosaur on the island. Nicknamed &quot;Naze&quot; after the northerly Naze Peninsula on which it was found, the Late Cretaceous remains include an upper jaw and teeth, and most of the lower legs and feet. Little information is available, but the shape of the leg and feet indicate it was a runner. In 2019, it was given the name &quot;Imperobator antarcticus&quot;. It was large, about the size of &quot;Utahraptor&quot;. It is the second Antarctic theropod discovered, after &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;.

An ornithopod was found in the Snow Hill Island Formation by Argentine paleontologists Rodolfo Aníbal Coria and Juan José Moly in 2008. In 2013, Coria named it &quot;Trinisaura santamartaensis&quot;.

In 2015, an iguanodontid found in 2002 by Fernando Novas was named &quot;Morrosaurus antarcticus&quot; by Sebastian Rozadilla, Federico Lisandro Agnolin, Fernando Emilio Novas, Alexis Rolando Aranciaga Mauro, Matthew J. Motta, Juan Manuel Lirio Marcelo and Pablo Isasi. The genus name refers to the site of El Morro on James Ross Island, where the remains of the species were found. The specific name refers to Antarctica.

==Notable features==

Notable features, clockwise from the west, include:
*Ulu Peninsula () is that portion of James Ross Island northwest of the narrow neck of land between Rohss Bay and Croft Bay, extending from Cape Obelisk to Cape Lachman.
*Croft Bay () is a bay which indents the north-central side of James Ross Island and forms the southern part of Herbert Sound.
*The Naze () is a peninsula in north James Ross Island, marking the southeast entrance to Herbert Sound and extending about northeast from Terrapin Hill toward the south-central shore of Vega Island.
*Markham Bay () is a bay wide, lying between Ekelöf Point and Hamilton Point on the east side of James Ross Island.

==Southeast features==
From west to east
===Nygren Point===
A rocky point southeast of Cape Broms, on the southwest side of James Ross Island. 
First seen and surveyed in 1903 by the SwedAE under Nordenskjold, who named it Cape Nygren after G. Nygren, Swedish chemist who contributed toward the cost of the expedition. 
It was resurveyed by the FIDS in 1952. 
Point is considered a more suitable descriptive term for this feature than cape.

===Carlsson Bay===
A square bay, in extent, entered northwest of Cape Foster on the southwest side of James Ross Island. 
First seen and surveyed in 1903 by the SwedAE under Nordenskjold, who named it for J. Carlsson of Sweden who contributed toward the cost of the expedition. 
The bay was resurveyed by the FIDS in 1952–53.

===Tait Glacier===

Named by UK Antarctic Place-names Committee (UK-APC) (2006) in association with Swift Glacier which flows southward into the bay.

===Swift Glacier===
A steep glacier about long, close west of Jefford Point. 
Named by UK-APC following FIDS surveys, 1958–61. 
The name is descriptive, this being one of the most active glaciers on the island.

===Jefford Point===
A point formed by a rock cliff surmounted by ice, located east-northeast of Cape Foster. 
First surveyed by SwedAE, 1901–04, under Otto Nordenskjold. 
Resurveyed by FIDS in 1948, the records being lost in a fire at Hope Bay, it was surveyed again by FIDS in 1952.

Named by UK-APC following FIDS surveys, 1958–61. 
The feature is similar geologically and in appearance to Terrapin Hill in the northeast portion of the island; hence the application of a related name.

===The Watchtower===
An isolated, steep-sided, flat-topped rock mass, high, on the southeast extremity of James Ross Island. 
First seen, roughly surveyed, and given the descriptive name &quot;The Watch Tower&quot; by Otto Nordenskjold of the SwedAE in March 1902.

===Howarth Glacier===

<text>The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is a United States federal law that was passed in the wake of the Nixon Watergate scandal and the Saturday Night Massacre. It was intended to fight corruption in government.

==Summary==
The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is organized into six titles. It created mandatory, public disclosure of financial, and employment history of public officials as well as their immediate families. It also created restrictions on lobbying efforts by public officials for a set period after leaving public office. Lastly, it created the United States Office of the Government Ethics to oversee the federal ethics program. 

===Title I===
Title I requires those in the public service sector to fill out financial disclosure forms which include the sources and amounts of income, gifts, reimbursements, the identity and approximate value of property held and liabilities owed, transactions in property, commodities, and securities, and certain financial interests of a spouse or dependent. People that must file reports include, but are not limited to: the President, Vice President, employees and officers of the Executive Branch, Postmaster General, the Deputy Postmaster General, each Governor of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service, each officer or employee of the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission, as well as judicial officers, such as Chief Justice, Associate Justices, appellate judges and district judges.

The report must then be filed to the appropriate state officer of their state of residence, and the committee charged with issues of ethics in their respective house of Congress. The President, Vice President, counsel appointed to the United States Department of Justice, and nominees to positions that require United States Senate confirmation must file with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics.

These reports are available to the public shortly after they are submitted.

The Attorney General of the United States can bring charges against anyone who falsifies information in the reports.

===Title II===
Vote to repeal took place in 1989, and took effect January 1, 1991. This title originally governed financial disclosure by executive branch officials, but disclosure rules for all three branches were later consolidated into the first title.

===Title III===
Vote to repeal took place in 1989, and took effect January 1, 1991. This title originally governed financial disclosure by judicial branch officials, but disclosure rules for all three branches were later consolidated into the first title.

===Title IV===
Title IV created the Office of Government Ethics. The Office of Government Ethics&#x27; director is appointed by the President, and approved by the Senate. The director is charged with providing direction on Executive Branch policies of disclosure, and collaborates with the Attorney General in investigations of ethics violations.

===Title V===
Title V restricts outside employment on people making above $120,000 a year with adjustment for location as of 2011. Employees cannot be employed by an &quot;entity which provides professional services involving a fiduciary relationship&quot;, have their name used by that entity, work on the board of that entity, or teach without prior authorization by the appropriate government ethics department or figure.

The bill increased length of prohibition of lobbying work in front of the agency from one to two years.

Finally, it allows for judges to teach when not on active duty.

===Title VI===
Title VI amended Title 28 of the United States Code. Title VI of The Act expired on June 30, 1999. It has been permanently replaced with Title 28 (CFR), Chapter VI, Part 600.

It requires the Attorney General to investigate specific allegations of federal offenses by the President, Vice President, individuals at specified salary levels in the Executive Office of the President and the Department of Justice, any Assistant Attorney General, the Director and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, all such specified individuals who held office during the incumbency of the President or during the period the previous President held office, if such preceding President was of the same political party as the incumbent President, and any officer of the principal national campaign committee seeking the election or reelection of the President.

The Attorney General must decide if there is merit to the allegation within 90 days. If so, he or she must have a special prosecutor appointed who has all the power of the Department of Justice office except those specific to the Attorney General. The special prosecutor is chosen through a system wherein the Chief Justice of the United States appoints a panel of three judges from the Circuit Court of Appeals, one of which must be from the District of Columbia, who serve three-year terms and choose the special prosecutor. The special prosecutor has the authority to send any information to the United States Congress that he or she deems relevant and can provide counsel in issues that may call for impeachment of the person under investigation.

The special prosecutor can only be removed by impeachment and conviction by congress, or by the Attorney General for &quot;substantial improprieties&quot; or a physical or mental condition that affects performance.

The Department of Justice is required to suspend all investigations within the realm of the special prosecutor.

The Attorney General has the authority to declare anyone disqualified from participating in an investigation because of conflict of interest.

===Criticism===

Justice Antonin Scalia provided critiques of the Act, based on both Constitutional law and the potential for harm in practice, in his dissenting opinion in the case &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot;. Justice Scalia, a judicial conservative, noted that the U.S. Constitution granted consolidated power to enforce the law exclusively to the Executive Branch. The Act extended the power to initiate criminal investigation to the United States House of Representatives and the Senate, which Scalia viewed as a violation of the separation of powers. He believed that the House of Representatives&#x27; investigation through the use of a special prosecutor &quot;[arose] out of a bitter power dispute between the President and the Legislative Branch&quot;.

Even some Congressmen who had voted for the Act criticized it privately, leading to speculation that &quot;if it had been an anonymous vote, it would have been voted down two-to-one&quot;. The bill&#x27;s most controversial feature among Congressmen was its limit on outside income, which could be no more than 15 percent of his public service income. This restriction applied only to &quot;earned&quot; income, while excluding investment income from stocks or bonds. About a half-dozen members of the House of Representatives reportedly would not speak to the Speaker of the House, Tip O&#x27;Neill, because he pushed the Act through. Their claim was that the Act favored people with &quot;unearned&quot; wealth, people who already had it, over people with &quot;earned&quot; additional income, usually with a law practice on the side. Democratic Representative David R. Bowen of Mississippi called the ethics climate of the time a &quot;witch-hunt&quot;.

Specific provisions of the Act have faced criticism as either too weak or too strong. The Special Prosecutor created by Title VI was empowered to pursue investigations with minimal evidence, and was required to pursue any accusation that the District Attorney could not disprove. It allowed for legal harassment of political opponents, even in cases that prosecutors stated they would have dropped in any other federal court. Republicans complained of abuse by Democrats during the Supreme Court case of &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot;, and Democrats later complained that Kenneth Starr&#x27;s three-and-a-half-year investigation of President Bill Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal was motivated by partisanship. The Office of Government Ethics created by Title IV has been criticized on the grounds that its limited budget, leadership and prestige are inadequate for the Office to function effectively.

Other critics complain that public disclosure involves a violation of privacy which may deter good people from public service.

== The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 ==

The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 was introduced by Representative Tom Foley (D-WA) to provide for government-wide ethics reform. Improvements to the 1978 act included civil penalties for appointees violating post-service employment regulations, and widening the net to include all employees of the Executive Department who hold a commission from the President. The act became Public Law 101-194 on November 30, 1989.

<doc id="1214891" wikidata="Q58298" url="?curid=1214891" title="Alexandru Marghiloman">
<text>Alexandru Marghiloman (4 July 1854 – 10 May 1925) was a Romanian conservative statesman who served for a short time in 1918 (March–October) as Prime Minister of Romania, and had a decisive role during World War I.

==Early career==
Born in Buzău, he entered the Saint Sava National College in Bucharest, and then studied Law in Paris. Marghiloman was elected to the Romanian Parliament in 1884, and joined the government in 1888.

A member of the Conservative Party, he supported cooperation with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance, and, at the beginning of World War I, he favoured neutrality. Romania remained neutral until 1916, when she entered on the Allied side and this was the reason he refused a seat in the Ion Brătianu&#x27;s liberal government.

After the Germans occupied Bucharest, he remained there as the president of the Romanian Red Cross, and acted as a mediator between the German occupation authorities and the Romanian population. He rejected the ideas of the German side of forming a parallel administration to King Ferdinand I&#x27;s government that was moved to Iași.

==Cabinet and later years==

However, since Bolshevist Russia withdrew from the war and the Germans could occupy the rest of Romania, King Ferdinand requested Marghiloman to become a Prime Minister, hoping that with a pro-German Prime Minister it would be easier to make peace with the Germans, and knowing that Germany would consider the Western Front to be much more important.

Indeed, Marghiloman negotiated and signed a peace treaty (known as the Treaty of Bucharest) with the Central Powers on 7 May 1918, which proved to be very punitive and restrictive for Romania. However, this treaty was never ratified. Marghiloman&#x27;s cabinet fell after the Armistice of Villa Giusti, and it was replaced quickly with the pro-Allied General Constantin Coandă on 6 November, under whose cabinet Romania re-entered the war against Germany on 10 November, a day before the end of the war. Retired from public life following the collapse of Conservative politicians in post-war Greater Romania, Marghiloman died in his native town.

==Trivia==

In his private life, Marghiloman was also an enthusiastic horse breeder: horses owned by him won the Romanian Derby 28 times. His large estate, the &quot;Albatros Villa&quot; (named after one of his horses) in Buzău, was for a long time a meeting place for Conservative politicians. He also had a mansion in Sinești, which was built in 1869–1874.

Marghiloman gave his name to &quot;Marghiloman coffee&quot;, Turkish coffee boiled in brandy.

<text>Muhammad Taufik bin Batisah (Jawi: محمد توفيق بن بتيسه; born 10 December 1981) is a Singaporean singer-songwriter best known for winning the first season of the reality TV series &quot;Singapore Idol&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Taufik was born to a Malay family of both Indian and Buginese descent. His parents divorced when he was 13 years old. He attended Jurong Primary School, Jurong Secondary School before graduating from Singapore Polytechnic.

==Music career==
Taufik first started out as a singer in a local group called Bonafide, playing a mixture of hip hop and R&amp;B with fellow rapper, Mark Subramaniam whose stage name is Mark Bonafide.

Taufik participated in the first season of the reality TV series Singapore Idol in 2004. On 1 December 2004, Taufik was crowned the first ever Singapore Idol at the Singapore Indoor Stadium before an audience of more than 8,000 fans and 1.8 million viewers across the country. He scored a recording deal with Sony BMG and a management deal under Hype Records&#x27; artiste management arm, ArtisteNetworks. It was later revealed that Taufik had won 682,000 of the 1.1 million votes cast that night, while his opponent Sylvester Sim managed 418,000 votes.

Following his win, Taufik clinched a string of endorsements for brands such as Harmuni Rice, Samsung, 7-Eleven stores and HSC drinks. He was the first Singapore artiste to endorse for the Swiss watch-maker, Swatch. He was also the face of the &quot;fresh air for women&quot; campaign in Singapore. This was aimed at reducing smoking in Singapore. However it was shortly pulled due to a member of public documenting pictures of him smoking. 

On 14 January 2005, Taufik released his first English album &quot;Blessings&quot;. The album included Taufik&#x27;s hits from the competition such as &quot;Me and Mrs Jones&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;, &quot;Superstition&quot; as well as the Idol winning song &quot;I Dream&quot;. Taufik also co-wrote one track on the album titled &quot;Close 2 You&quot;. &quot;Blessings&quot; went on to a smashing sale of 36,000 copies, making into the Singapore Guinness Book of Records as the best selling local English album in the past decade. It remains a record unbroken in the Singapore music industry.

On 19 April 2005, Taufik held his first solo concert showcase &quot;An Evening With Taufik&quot; at the Kallang Theatre. Fresh from recovering from tonsillitis (resulted from a non-stop four months performing schedule), he charmed both the media and full-house audience with his soulful singing and smooth on-stage moves.

In 2006, Taufik released his second album &quot;All Because of You&quot; where he wrote and produced eight of the tracks. The English-Malay album spurred off a string of hits and further opened doors to the Malay music industry. Title track &quot;All Because of You&quot; made its debut that the finals of the second season of Singapore Idol. The three Malay singles on the album &quot;Usah Lepaskan&quot;, &quot;Sesuatu Janji&quot; and &quot;Sombong&quot; took the Malay music industry by storm. He was named the Most Sellable Artiste at MediaCorp Suria&#x27;s People&#x27;s Choice Awards and was also awarded the Most Popular Male Artiste Award at the regional Anugerah Planet Muzik 2006. Winning Favourite Artist Singapore at the 2006 MTV Asia Awards further elevated Taufik&#x27;s career to further heights. An iconic role model, Taufik was also voted as the Winner of Kid&#x27;s Choice Wannabe Award (Singapore) at the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Award 2006.

Taufik continued to shine as the top artiste in Singapore, garnering the Most Popular Male Personality Award at Suria&#x27;s Annual TV awards, Pesta Perdana 2007, the Nickelodeon Kid&#x27;s Choice Wannabe Award (Singapore) for the second consecutive year, and also the Most Popular Artiste (Singapore) Award, Most Popular Song – &quot;Usah Lepaskan&quot; (Singapore) Award and the Best Local Song – &quot;Usah Lepaskan&quot;(Singer/Composer/Lyricist) Award at the Anugerah Planet Muzik 2007. &quot;Usah Lepaskan&quot; was also the Number 1 Song of the Year on Ria 89.7FM.

In 2007, he debuted his Malaysian album titled, &quot;Teman Istimewa (Special Friend)&quot; on 5 September and was the album long-awaited by the Malaysian &quot;Fiknatics&quot; (as his fans are called). Taufik produced 90% of this album and three songs are the Malay version of his earlier English songs &quot;Untukmu&quot; (&quot;First&quot;), &quot;Berserah&quot; (&quot;Holding On&quot;) and &quot;Janjiku Padamu&quot; (&quot;I Promise Forever&quot;). &quot;Seribu Tahun (A Thousand Years)&quot;, a song which he co-wrote, swept the Malaysian radio charts after it became the theme song for Malaysia&#x27;s Channel TV3 hit drama series, &quot;Kerana Cintaku Saerah (Because of My Love Saerah)&quot;.

In 2008, Taufik won the Most Popular Artiste (Singapore) Award and Most Popular Song (Singapore) Award for his composition &quot;Berserah (Surrender)&quot; as well as the Best Singapore Artiste Award at Anugerah Planet Muzik 2008. He also received the Singapore Youth Award (Arts and Culture), awarded by the National Youth Council, in recognition of his achievements in the music industry and for being a role model to the younger generation. Meanwhile, Taufik&#x27;s music compositions also received greater recognition as &quot;Berserah&quot; took the No. 1 spot for Song of the Year and &quot;Teman Istimewa&quot; took 5th place on the RIA 89.7FM radio station&#x27;s 2008 Top 30 Countdown.

Taufik also launched his fourth music album &quot;Suria Hatiku (Light of My Heart)&quot;. This critically acclaimed Malay album showcased a wide variety of songs of different genres and had spurned multiple Number No. 1 hits such as &quot;Gadis Itu (That Girl)&quot;, &quot;Nafasku (My Breathe)&quot;, &quot;Hey&quot; and &quot;Kepadanya (For Him)&quot;. The album also featured music collaborations between his mentor, Ken Lim, renowned music producer, M. Nasir, and singer, Hady Mirza.

Taufik was named the Most Popular Singapore Artiste for the third consecutive year at the Anugerah Planet Muzik Award 2009. His composition &quot;Usah Lepaskan&quot; was awarded the top Malay song with the highest royalties by COMPASS. Taufik also performed at the Angureah Planet Muzik Award held in Jakarta and the Singapore Day 2009 event in London. He was also invited to represent Singapore to perform at the ASEAN – Korea Commemorative Summit in Korea and performed at APEC Singapore 2009&#x27;s &quot;Singapore Evening at The Esplanade&quot;.

The year 2010 proved to be an exuberant start for Taufik. Besides fronting the finale performance at the Chingay Parade 2010 and performing for the second consecutive time in Seoul under the invitation of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korea as well as Singapore&#x27;s NAC, he continued to receive recognition for his music. He earned the top honour roll of six major awards at the first AnugeraHitz.sg Awards, which honoured the best in the local Malay music industry. The year also saw him diversifying his art and making his theatrical debut in Dick Lee&#x27;s &quot;Fried Rice Paradise – The Musical&quot;.

In 2011, he was part of the &quot;Home&quot; video project under Total Defence Campaign and also fronted the &quot;WeAreOne&quot; fund raising project for the Japan tsunami. He also released an Eid ul-Fitr collaboration album &quot;Kenangan Di Hari Raya (Memories on Eid)&quot; with Hady Mirza.

In August of that year, he represented Singapore and performed with the Asia Traditional Orchestra for Korea&#x27;s Independence Day in Seoul.
He also wrote and recorded a duet single &quot;Aku Bersahaja (Simply Me)&quot; with Indonesian diva Rossa. The pair debuted the single at Rossa&#x27;s &quot;Harmoni Cinta&quot; Concert at Esplanade. &quot;Aku Bersahaja&quot; was released in Singapore and Malaysia and to date, is his eighth Malay No. 1 radio chart topper.

For his achievements in the local music scene, he was honoured with the Yahoo! &quot;Singapore Most Influential Person in Entertainment 2011&quot;.

In 2012, his hit ballad &#x27;Usah Lepaskan&#x27; was also voted the Most Iconic Song in 55 years of Malay music in Singapore. July of that year saw his return to the English music scene with a new single &quot;Sky&#x27;s The Limit&quot; which featured the voice of popular singer-actress Rui En.

&quot;Sky&#x27;s The Limit&quot; hit the No. 1 position on 98.7 FM Top 20 Countdown Chart for two consecutive weeks on 7 and 14 September, a rare feat for a local song as the Chart is usually dominated by international acts.

Taufik represented Singapore at the first ABU TV Song Festival 2012 at the KBS Concert Hall, in Seoul, South Korea on 14 October 2012. He performed his multi-award-winning composition -&quot;Usah Lepaskan&quot; at the international gala music concert alongside high-profile music talents from across the region, including TVXQ (Korea), Havana Brown (Australia), Hafiz Suip (Malaysia) and Perfume (Japan).

&quot;Aku Bersahaja&quot; with Rossa was nominated for &quot;Lagu Bahasa Melayu Terbaik yang Dipersembahkan oleh Artis Luar Negara&quot; (Best Malay Song performance By A Foreign Artist) at the upcoming Malaysia&#x27;s annual music award – Anugerah Industri Muzik (AIM) 19, and also for &quot;Kolaborasi Terbaik&quot; (Best Collaboration) in Singapore&#x27;s Malay regional music Anugerah Planet Muzik.

Taufik also rose in the ranks of the regional and international music scene when he received significant recognition from Korea&#x27;s Mnet Asia Music Awards (MAMA) for Best Asian Artist (Singapore) as well as Anugerah Planet Muzik&#x27;s Best Collaboration (for &quot;Aku Bersahaja&quot;), Most Popular Singapore Artiste and Most Popular Regional Artiste.

On 1 October 2014, Taufik released his fifth studio album, &quot;Fique&quot;, which he produced, arranged and wrote all but one song. &quot;Fique&quot; features duets with Malay rapper Altimet, singer Shila Amzah and his aunt, Maria Bachok. Reviewing &quot;Fique&quot; in &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, Eddino Abdul Hadi awarded the album four out of five stars and wrote that it was &quot;not so much Taufik, 32, reinventing himself as it is him taking the best parts of his past and moulding them into one cohesive work...a solid collection of songs.&quot; &quot;TODAY&quot;″s Kenneth Choy awarded &quot;Fique&quot; four out of five, calling the album &quot;[e]xpressive, emotive and energetic&quot; plus &quot;truly a good comeback effort with just about the right mix of material that will appeal to new and current fans alike.&quot;

At the Anugerah Planet Muzik 2014, Taufik won three awards: Most Popular Song (Singapore), Most Popular Artist and Social Media Icon, winning the most awards by any artist that year. Taufik also performed three songs, including his new single, &#x27;#AwakKatMane&#x27; (Where Are You), off his recent album, &quot;Fique&quot;.

In 2018, Taufik represented Singapore at the ASEAN-JAPAN Music Festival in Tokyo, performing alongside Dato Sri Siti Nurhaliza (Malaysia), W-inds (Japan), Sarah Geronimo (Philippines), Andien (Indonesia) and Dong Nhi (Vietnam).

In 2019, Taufik performs the National Day Parade 2019 theme song &quot;Our Singapore&quot;, alongside Stefanie Sun, JJ Lin, Ramli Sarip, Dick Lee, Kit Chan, Sam Willows and an inter-generation cast.

<text>Nathaniel Godolphin Burslem VC (2 February 1837 – 14 July 1865), born in Limerick, Ireland; was by birth both Irish and by descent English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== History and career ==
Burslem was born 2 February 1836 in County Limerick, Ireland, the son of George James Burslem of the 94th Regiment of Foot and Susan (née Vokes), of Limerick (married Dublin 15 March 1836). His father was English, and traced his family back to the town of Burslem in Staffordshire. His grandfather was Colonel Nathaniel Godolphin Burslem who was awarded the Gold Medal - the forerunner of the VC Medal. 

On 21 August 1860 at the Taku Forts, China, during the Second China War Lieutenant Burslem, then aged 24 and serving in the 67th Regiment of Foot, British Army, and Private Thomas Lane of his regiment displayed great gallantry for which they were both awarded the VC. They swam the ditches of the North Taku Fort and attempted, during the assault and before an entrance had been effected by anyone, to enlarge an opening in the wall, through which they eventually entered. In doing so, they were both severely wounded.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum &amp; Memorial Garden, Winchester, England. He later achieved the rank of captain before selling his commission and sailing, along with his brother John Godolphin Burslem, to New Zealand. He arrived in 1865 and bought land in the North Island and was planning to grow flax, but he and an acquaintance capsized their canoe on the Thames River, both drowning on 14 July 1865. His body was not recovered.

<text>Alfred Alexander Burt VC (3 March 1895 – 9 June 1962) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Details ==
Burt was employed as a gas fitter for the Broxbourne Gas Company and had enlisted as a territorial soldier in the Hertfordshire Regiment in 1911. On the outbreak of the First World War he was mobilised and arrived on the Western Front in November 1914 with 1/1st battalion of the Hertfordshires. On the date of the action for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross, he was aged 20 years, and serving as a corporal. The 27 September 1915 was the third day of the British offensive known as the Battle of Loos and his battalion was preparing to assault the German lines beside Cuinchy.

The citation for the medal reads:

He received his medal from the King in March 1916 and returned to the front to serve for the remainder of the war, being promoted to the rank of Sergeant. On 11 November 1920 he was among the 100 strong honour guard of Victoria Cross holders in the interment of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey.

He died at the age of 67 in Chesham in 1962, his health having suffered from complications caused by his exposure to a gas attack during the war. There is a road named in his honour in Chesham; Alfred Burt VC close.

== The medal ==
His Victoria Cross is held at the Hertford Museum as part of the Hertfordshire Regiment collection.

<doc id="1214902" wikidata="Q1777157" url="?curid=1214902" title="Knight's fee">
<text>In feudal Anglo-Norman England and Ireland, a knight&#x27;s fee was a unit measure of land deemed sufficient to support a knight. It would not only provide sustenance for himself, his family, and servants, but also the means to furnish himself and his retinue with horses and armour to fight for his overlord in battle. It was effectively the size of a fief (or &quot;fee&quot; which is synonymous with &quot;feif&quot;) sufficient to support one knight in the ongoing performance of his feudal duties (knight-service).

A knight&#x27;s fee cannot be stated as a standard number of acres, as the required acreage to produce a given crop or revenue would vary depending on many factors, including its location, the richness of its soil and the local climate, as well as the presence of other exploitable resources such as a fishing weir, quarries of rock, or mines of minerals. If a knight&#x27;s fee is deemed coterminous with a manor, an average size would be between 1,000 and 5,000 acres, of which much in early times was still &quot;waste&quot;, forest and uncultivated moorland.

==Creation==
A knight&#x27;s fee could be created by the king himself or by one of his tenants-in-chief by separating off an area of land from his own demesne (land held in-hand), which process when performed by the latter was known as subinfeudation, and establishing therein a new manor for the use of a knight who would by the process of enfeoffment become his tenant by paying homage and fealty to his new overlord. This homage and fealty was a vow of loyalty to his overlord, with corresponding vow of protection received, and an undertaking to provide a specified form of service commonly due under feudal land tenure in England. Broadly speaking such service was either military (knight-service) or non-military (serjeanty, etc.). Military service was generally to a maximum of 40 days per annum, signifying that he would have to fight for his overlord in battle. No cash rent was payable, although military service was later transformable into scutage. A knight was required to maintain the dignity of knighthood, which meant that he should live in suitable style and be well-turned out in battle, with the required number of esquires to serve him and with horses, arms and armour for all.

==Used as a unit for tax assessment==
A feudal tenant-in-chief of the king was assessed for certain feudal aids according as to how many knight&#x27;s fees he held, whether tenanted or held in demesne. Where a knight&#x27;s fee was inherited by joint heiresses, the fee would be split into two or more moieties, that is two separate parts, each a manor of itself with its own manorial court, each deemed half a knight&#x27;s fee, and so-on down to smaller fractions. Thus a magnate could be overlord to, say, 12 knight&#x27;s fees.

==Subinfeudation==
A knight&#x27;s fee was not only originally created by the process of subinfeudation, but could itself be split into smaller units by the same process, otherwise than through inheritance. By this means, until the practice was outlawed in 1290 by the statute of &quot;Quia Emptores&quot;, a knight could create his own feudal retainer who would pledge fealty to him rather than to the overlord. Such a holding was termed a sub-fee.

It can thus be seen that the knight&#x27;s fee was the base unit of land valuation for use in the feudal system.

<doc id="1214916" wikidata="Q368100" url="?curid=1214916" title="Constantin Sănătescu">
<text>Constantin Sănătescu (14 January 1885 – 8 November 1947) was a Romanian general and statesman who served as the 44th Prime Minister of Romania after the 23 August 1944 coup after which Romania left the Axis powers and joined the Allies.

==Early life and military career==
Sănătescu was born on January 14, 1885, in Craiova. He was the son of the infantry lieutenant Gheorghe Sănătescu (1858–1942), a future general. He graduated from the School of Sons of Soldiers in Iași (1905), then attended the Military School of Infantry and Cavalry in Bucharest (September 1, 1905 – July 1, 1907). He attended military school in the same class with future Generals Gheorghe Mihail and Nicolae Macici, being promoted after graduation to the rank of second lieutenant (July 1, 1907) and assigned to the 5th Roșiori Regiment. Sănătescu was promoted to lieutenant on July 1, 1910, and transferred on October 16 as an instructing officer to the Military School of Active Cavalry Officers. He obtained the rank of captain on April 1, 1915, and was appointed first as the commander of the squadron of the 10th Călărași Regiment and then in the 7th Roșiori Regiment. He fought against Bulgaria during the Second Balkan War (1913).

==First World War==
Captain Sănătescu took part in the battles of the First World War and was promoted to the rank of major on September 1, 1917. From February 15, 1918, he served in the staff of the 16th Infantry Division, then was transferred to the General Staff, and later became an instructor at the Military School of Active Cavalry Officers.

==Interwar period==
He then attended the Higher War School (April 1, 1919 – November 1, 1920), being assigned to the General Staff after graduation. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel on April 1, 1921. On November 2, 1926, he was transferred to the General Secretariat of the Ministry of War and on July 1, 1927, he was promoted to colonel.

Colonel Sănătescu was appointed on May 5, 1928, as a military attaché in the Romanian Legation in London, where he remained for two years until June 30, 1930. After returning to Romania, he was entrusted with the command of the Mounted Guards Regiment. He was appointed the Chief of Staff of the General Inspectorate of the Cavalry on October 1, 1933. After a year, he returned to the General Staff, and on June 15, 1935, he became the commander of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on October 16, 1935.

After two years in command, he was appointed on November 1, 1937, as Deputy Chief of the General Staff and fulfilled the position during the term of Major General Ștefan Ionescu. From May to December 1939, he served as director of the National Military Circle. On February 27, 1939, shortly after the replacement on February 1 of General Ionescu with General Țenescu as Chief of the General Staff, Sănătescu passed to the command of the 3rd Cavalry Division and was promoted on October 25 to the rank of major general. He then held the positions of commander of the 8th Army Corps, commander of the Cavalry Corps, commander of the Military Command of the Capital during the Legionnaires&#x27; rebellion and commander of the 4th Army Corps (1941–1943). As commander of the 8th Army Corps, it was General Sănătescu who stopped the Pogrom from Dorohoi against the Jews that was launched in 1940.

==Second World War==
When Romania joined the Second World War on June 22, 1941, Sănătescu was the commanding officer of the 4th Army Corps. He participated for two years in the battles on the Eastern Front, standing out in the Battle of Odessa and the Battle of Stalingrad. He was decorated on November 7, 1941, with the &quot;Order of the Star of Romania &quot; with swords in the rank of Grand Officer with the ribbon of Military Virtue &quot;for the dexterity with which he led the troops of the Army Corps in the battle of Odessa. Acting with all his might, he definitively defeated the enemy resistance in the South Tătarca region, entering Odessa.&quot; He was promoted to the rank of Army Corps General on January 24, 1942.

In March 1943, he was called from the front and appointed head of the Royal Military House (March 20, 1943 – January 24, 1944) and then Marshal of the Palace (April 1, 1944 – August 23, 1944). He participated in several meetings with civilians and soldiers close to the Royal House who planned the overthrow of the Antonescu regime, Romania&#x27;s exit from the anti-Soviet war and turning around the weapons against Nazi Germany.

On August 23, 1944, King Michael I dismissed and arrested Marshal Ion Antonescu. Sănătescu was one of the organizers of the 1944 coup d&#x27;état and was a close friend of the king. That evening, Sănătescu was appointed President of the Council of Ministers and formed a military cabinet in which the leaders of the four parties that had supported King Michael had one representative without a portfolio. The Communist Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu also held the position of interim minister of justice.

The Sănătescu government was entrusted with the important mission of consolidating the coup by repelling the attack of the German contingents in the country. In the battles between August 24 and August 31, a large part of Romania was liberated, but the Soviet Union de facto occupied the country. The appointment of Sănătescu to head the government was made official by a royal decree, which was issued only on September 1, 1944.

The Sănătescu government sent a delegation consisting of Prince Barbu A. Știrbey, General Dumitru Dămăceanu, Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, and Ghiță Popp to negotiate and sign the Armistice Convention in Moscow with the United Nations. The Russians delayed receiving the delegation until their army had fully occupied the Romanian territory. The deed was signed on September 12. On September 15, a working meeting took place between members of the Sănătescu government and participants in the signing of the armistice during which Iuliu Maniu observed that Romania&#x27;s negotiators had to &quot;accept points that represent a real capitulation, not a free Armistice contract.&quot; Also, on September 12, 1944, at the energetic intervention of Sănătescu, Anton Buga, who had been sentenced to death, was released.

On November 4, 1944, the Second Sănătescu cabinet was formed, led by General Sănătescu. The cabinet faced the challenges of the Romanian Communist Party, supported by the Soviet Union, which requested that it be granted two strategic ministries, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of War. Losing the trust of the leaders of the liberal and peasant parties, which perceived him as too moderate towards the communists, Sănătescu submitted his resignation on December 2, 1944.

Sănătescu was promoted to the rank of general on December 6, 1944. He then served as Chief of the Romanian General Staff (December 11, 1944 – June 20, 1945), developing the battle plans of the Romanian Army and leading the military operations until the final defeat of Germany.

After the end of the war, General Sănătescu served for a period as inspector general of the army.

==Death==
Sănătescu died of cancer in 1947 in Bucharest, and was buried at Bellu Cemetery. He was the last general of the Romanian Army buried with full honours according to his rank.

==Medals==
Sănătescu was decorated with numerous Romanian and foreign decorations and medals, including: 
* &quot;Order of the Crown&quot;, in the rank of Grand Officer with military insignia (May 9, 1941)
* &quot;Order of the Star of Romania&quot; with swords in the rank of Grand Officer with ribbon of &quot;Military Virtue&quot; (November 7, 1941) 
* &quot;Order of Michael the Brave&quot; with swords, cl. III 
* &quot;Order of Saint Sava&quot;
and a number of other decorations.

<text>Commander Donald Cameron, VC (18 March 1916 – 10 April 1961) was a Scottish sailor and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He is one of three VC recipients from the small town of Carluke in South Lanarkshire (population 14,000). The Rotary Club of Carluke have erected a millennium stone in the town market place to commemorate this.

==Naval career==
Cameron served in the Merchant Navy from the age of 17. He was 27 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve during the Second World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22 September 1943 at Kåfjord on the Altafjord, North Norway, Lieutenant Cameron, commanding Midget Submarine X.6, and another lieutenant (Basil Charles Godfrey Place) commanding Midget Submarine X.7, carried out a most daring and successful attack on the German Battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The small submarines had to travel at least 1,000 miles from base, negotiate a minefield, dodge nets, gun defences and enemy listening posts. Having eluded all these hazards they finally placed the charges underneath the ship where they went off an hour later, doing so much damage that the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was out of action for months.

Cameron and other five officers captured at Kåfjord were transferred to Marlag-O, the German prison camp for British naval officers at Westertimke.

The full citation was published in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 18 February 1944 (dated 22 February 1944) and read:

Cameron achieved the rank of commander in 1955, and was in charge of , the submarine base at Fort Blockhouse.

==Personal life==
Cameron married WRNS&#x27;s member Eve Kilpatrick in 1940 and they had four children. Cameron&#x27;s health deteriorated in the last years of his life and he was eventually admitted to Royal Hospital Haslar, Gosport, where he died on 10 April 1961. He was buried at sea from submarine on 13 April 1961.

<text>James Thomas Fields (December 31, 1817 – April 24, 1881) was an American publisher, editor, and poet. His business, Ticknor and Fields, was a notable publishing house in 19th century Boston.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
He was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on December 31, 1817 and named James Field; the family later added the &quot;s&quot;. His father was a sea captain and died before Fields was three. He and his brother were raised by their mother and her siblings, their aunt Mary and uncle George. At the age of 14, Fields took a job at the Old Corner Bookstore in Boston as an apprentice to publishers Carter and Hendee. His first published poetry was included in the &quot;Portsmouth Journal&quot; in 1837 but he drew more attention when, on September 13, 1838, he delivered his &quot;Anniversary Poem&quot; to the Boston Mercantile Library Association.

===Publishing career===
In 1839, he joined William Ticknor and became junior partner in the publishing and bookselling firm known after 1845 as Ticknor and Fields. Ticknor oversaw the business side of the firm while Fields was its literary expert. He became known for being likable, for his skill at finding creative talent, and for his ability to promote authors and win their loyalty. With this company, Fields became the publisher of leading contemporary American writers, with whom he was on terms of close personal friendship. He was also the American publisher of some of the best-known British writers of his time, some of whom he also knew intimately. The company paid royalties to these British authors, including Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray, at a time when other American publishers pirated the works of those authors. The first collected edition of Thomas de Quincey&#x27;s works (20 vols., 1850–1855) was published by his firm. Ticknor and Fields built their company to have a substantial influence in the literary scene which writer and editor Nathaniel Parker Willis acknowledged in a letter to Fields: &quot;Your press is the announcing-room of the country&#x27;s Court of Poetry.&quot;

Sometime in 1844, Fields was engaged to Mary Willard, a local woman six years younger than him. Before they could be married, she died of tuberculosis on April 17, 1845. He maintained a close friendship with her family and, on March 13, 1850, married her 18-year-old sister Eliza Willard at Boston&#x27;s Federal Street Church. Also sick with tuberculosis, she died on July 13, 1851. Grief-stricken, he left the United States for a time and traveled to Europe.

In 1854, Fields married Annie Adams, who was an author herself. Mrs. Fields was instrumental in helping Mr. Fields establish literary salons at their home at 37 Charles Street in Boston, where they entertained many well-known writers. One such writer was Nathaniel Hawthorne. After Hawthorne&#x27;s death in 1864, Fields served as a pallbearer for his funeral alongside Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Edwin Percy Whipple. In 1867, he performed the same role after the death of Nathaniel Parker Willis, along with Holmes, Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Samuel Gridley Howe.

Ticknor and Fields purchased &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; for $10,000 and, about two years later in May 1861, Fields took over the editorship from Lowell. At a New Year&#x27;s Eve party in 1865, he met William Dean Howells and 10 days later offered him a position as assistant editor of the &quot;Atlantic&quot;. Howells accepted but was somewhat dismayed by Fields&#x27;s close supervision.

Ticknor died in 1864, leaving Fields the senior partner for the firm. Fields was less concerned with the retail store owned by the company and wanted to focus on publishing. On November 12, 1864, he sold the Old Corner Bookstore and moved Ticknor and Fields to 124 Tremont Street.

In 1868 the business became Fields, Osgood, and Company, recognizing James R. Osgood.
On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1871, Fields announced his retirement at a small gathering of friends.

===Later life and death===

No longer involved with editorial duties, he then devoted himself to lecturing and writing. He also edited, with Edwin Percy Whipple, &quot;A Family Library of British Poetry&quot; (1878).

Fields became increasingly popular as a lecturer throughout the 1870s. In May 1879, Fields suffered a brain hemorrhage and collapsed before a scheduled lecture at Wellesley College. By autumn he seemed to have recovered. In January 1881, he gave what would be his final public lecture, coincidentally at the Mercantile Library Association, the organization which hosted his first public reading. Fields died in Boston on April 24, 1881. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

His wife, Annie Fields, was devastated and demanded friends not mention him and she gradually cut herself off from others. Her friend, writer Celia Thaxter told her, &quot;don&#x27;t shut yourself away... or you will die a thousand deaths of silence.&quot; Shortly after, she began a friendship with Sarah Orne Jewett, and the two became companions for the rest of their lives.

==Writing==
In addition to his work as a publisher and editor, Fields was also a writer. His chief works were the collection of sketches and essays entitled &quot;Underbrush&quot; (1877) and the chapters of reminiscence composing &quot;Yesterdays with Authors&quot; (1871), in which he recorded his personal friendship with William Wordsworth, William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and others.

Fields also wrote poetry. A number of his works are collected in his book &quot;Ballads and Verses&quot; published in 1880. This volume contains the poem &quot;The Ballad of the Tempest&quot;, which includes the famous lines:
:&quot;We are lost!&quot; the captain shouted
:As he staggered down the stairs

==Legacy==

James T. Fields was known in his lifetime as one of the most successful and shrewd book promoters, working at a time when bribery was typical in the publishing culture. Hawthorne said he owed his success as a writer to him: &quot;I care more for your good opinion than for that of a host of critics, and have excellent reason for so doing; inasmuch as my literary success, whatever it has been or may be, is the result of my connection with you&quot;.

Fields was particularly successful as a publisher because of his ability to build close relationships with writers. As author Rebecca Harding Davis said, he was &quot;the shrewdest of publishers and kindest of men. He was the wire that conducted the lightning so that it never struck amiss.&quot; He also knew the tastes of the reading public. Fields was reputedly able to ascertain what book a visitor to the Old Corner Bookstore would purchase within 10 minutes of arrival.

After Fields&#x27;s death, his widow Annie Adams Fields wrote the biography &quot;Memoir of James T. Fields, by his Wife&quot; (Boston, 1881) and &quot;Authors and Friends&quot; (Boston, 1896), which also reflects on his life. His friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a poem called &quot;&quot; dedicated to him. Fields, along with Longfellow, is featured in the first and third of Matthew Pearl&#x27;s novels, &quot;The Dante Club&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Last Dickens&quot; (2009). Fields is also mentioned in the 1994 film version of &quot;Little Women&quot; and in Dan Simmons&#x27; &quot;Drood (novel)&quot; (2009).

<doc id="1214922" wikidata="Q439234" url="?curid=1214922" title="Luísa Todi">
<text>Luísa Rosa de Aguiar Todi (9 January 1753–1 October 1833) was a popular and successful Portuguese mezzo-soprano opera singer.

==Early life==
Luísa Todi was born Luísa Rosa de Aguiar on 9 January 1753 in Setúbal, Portugal. In 1765, her family moved to Lisbon, where her father was a musical writer in the Theatre of Bairro Alto.

Luísa began her career as an actress in 1767 or 1768 in Molière&#x27;s play &quot;Tartuffe&quot;. She met Francesco Saverio Todi, an Italian violinist, whom she married in 1769. After their marriage, on her husband&#x27;s advice, she began having singing lessons with Davide Perez, an Italian composer and Music Master of the Portuguese Royal Chapel.

In 1770, she began her career as a singer with Giuseppe Scolari&#x27;s opera &quot;Il Viaggiatore Ridicolo&quot;, in the Theatre of Bairro Alto. From 1772 to 1777, Luísa lived in Porto, where she was a singer and a singing teacher and where she began to be recognized as an artist of stature.

==Rise to fame==
In the winter of 1777, at age 24, she gave her first performance abroad, at the King&#x27;s Theatre in London. The enthusiastic critics said that &quot;Mrs. Luísa Todi possesses high merit as singer and as actress.&quot;

In 1778 she sang at the famous &quot;Concerts Spirituels&quot; in Paris, winning a triumph and being considered the best foreign singer ever featured in France. She remained in France until 1780; then from 1780 to 1783, she sang at the Teatro Regio in Turin and gave performances in Germany and Austria in 1781.

She returned to Paris for further &quot;Concerts Spirituels&quot; series, during which time a confrontation arose between Luísa Todi and the German soprano Gertrud Elisabeth Mara (1749–1833), which divided the public. Luísa Todi won this battle of rivals, being called by the French &quot;the Nation&#x27;s Singer&quot;.

==Life in Russia==
In 1784, Luísa travelled to Russia with her husband and children. They arrived at St. Petersburg on 7 June 1784 (27 May O.S.). On 10 June (30 May O.S.), Luísa gave her first concert, performing Giuseppe Sarti&#x27;s &quot;Armida and Rinaldo&quot;. She was so impressive that at the end of that concert the Empress Catherine II presented her with two diamond bracelets. To express their gratitude, Luísa and her husband wrote the opera &quot;Pollinia&quot; and dedicated it to the Empress.

The opera&#x27;s première was in October, when Luísa performed with the famous castrato Luigi Marchesi (1754–1829). Marchesi, famous for his turbulent temperament, envied her success. He and the composer Sarti engaged in a campaign of rivalry against Luísa Todi. Empress Catherine took Luísa&#x27;s side and declined to renew the contract of Marchesi and Sarti.

Luísa Todi stayed for four years in Russia (1784–1788). She was the royal princesses&#x27; singing teacher, and Catherine II continued to present her with magnificent jewels of incalculable value.

In 1788 Luísa was at Frederick William II of Prussia&#x27;s court. The following year she returned to Paris for her third season of &quot;Concerts Spirituels&quot; and was considered by critics as &quot;the greatest singer of her time.&quot; She returned to the Prussian court a few weeks before the beginning of the French Revolution.

==Height of her career==
In 1790 she started a triumphant tour through Germany, and in Bonn she performed for Beethoven. At the end of that year, she travelled to Venice and performed at the Teatro San Samuele in the opera &quot;La Didone Abbandonata&quot;, wearing a tiara, necklace, and diamond earrings that had been given to her by the Russian Empress.

In Venice, Luísa Todi attained one of the most glittering moments of her career; the Italian season of 1790/1791 became known as &quot;Todi&#x27;s Year&quot;. But during her stay in Venice, she started experiencing vision problems, which caused her to abandon the stage for some months. The Venetians expressed their concern and fans wrote hundreds of verses and poems in her honour. When Luísa returned to the stage in 1791, she was greeted with a rapturous ovation. She also toured other Italian cities.

Between 1792 and 1796, she sang in Madrid at the .

In April 1793, Luísa returned to Portugal. She required a special authorization to perform there, because at that time women were forbidden to appear on the public stage. In Lisbon she sang at a commemorative party for the Prince Regent&#x27;s (the future John VI) daughter&#x27;s birth. Sadly, her native country failed to recognize Luísa&#x27;s outstanding talent, because her performance was not widely advertised and the Royal Family was absent from the event.

After singing in Naples, she returned to Portugal in 1801, living in Porto. There she continued to sing until the death of her husband in 1803, when she retired and wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life.

In 1809, Porto was invaded by the Napoleonic army commanded by General Soult. Luísa Todi decided to abandon the city, but during the escape she lost most of her belongings, including her priceless jewels. This caused financial problems during the last years of her life. Luísa Todi and her family were imprisoned by the French, but General Soult recognized her as &quot;the Nation&#x27;s Singer&quot; and protected her.

==Death==
In 1811 she moved to Lisbon. By 1823, following her earlier vision problems, she had become completely blind. She died on 1 October 1833 after suffering a stroke the previous July. She was buried in the cemetery of the Church of the Incarnation, close to Chiado, in Lisbon. The cemetery area still exists today, underneath the foundations of a later building at 78 Rua do Alecrim. In spite of constant requests made by Todi enthusiasts and family descendants, one of the greatest Portuguese singers of all time remains buried beneath the pavement of an obscure cellar.

==Legacy==
Before her death, Luísa Todi saw her talent immortalised in Antoine Reicha&#x27;s book &quot;Traité de melodie&quot;, where she is described as &quot;the Singer of all Centuries&quot;. In modern Lisbon, the street in which Luísa Todi died was named Rua Luísa Todi in 1917. This is at the northern edge of Bairro Alto, just off Rua de São Pedro de Alcântara above the church of São Roque. She was also immortalised in her native city of Setúbal with a large monument and bust as well as the naming of Setúbal&#x27;s biggest main avenue as Avenida Luísa Todi.

Todi was praised for her vocal abilities, her clear diction, her linguistic skills (she spoke excellent French, English, Italian, and German), her professionalism, her talent as an actress, and the emotion and sensibility with which she infused her roles – qualities that make her seem an extremely modern performer. These are the same qualities that have ensured that Luísa Todi is still remembered across the centuries.

<doc id="1214927" wikidata="Q412690" url="?curid=1214927" title="Galantamine">
<text>Galantamine is a type of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It is an alkaloid extracted from the bulbs and flowers of &quot;Galanthus nivalis&quot; (common snowdrop), &quot;Galanthus caucasicus&quot; (Caucasian snowdrop), &quot;Galanthus woronowii&quot; (Voronov&#x27;s snowdrop), and other members of the family &quot;Amaryllidaceae&quot;, such as &quot;Narcissus&quot; (daffodil), &quot;Leucojum aestivum&quot; (snowflake), and &quot;Lycoris&quot; including &quot;Lycoris radiata&quot; (red spider lily). It can also be produced synthetically.

Galantamine is primarily known for its potential to slow cognitive decline. It is used clinically for treating early-stage Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and memory impairments, although it has had limited success with the more advanced condition of dementia.

It works by increasing the amount of a type of neurotransmitter named acetylcholine by the inhibiting activity of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase known for breaking down acetylcholine. This elevates and prolongs acetylcholine levels boosting acetylcholine&#x27;s neuromodulatory functionality, subsequently enhancing functionality of the various cognitions that acetylcholine is involved in, such as memory processing, reasoning, and thinking. Galantamine may cause serious adverse effects, such as stomach bleeding, liver injury or chest pain.

Galantamine was isolated for the first time from bulbs of &quot;Galanthus nivalis&quot; (common snowdrop) in the Soviet Union in the 1940s. The active ingredient was extracted, identified, and studied, in particular in relation to acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibiting properties. The first industrial process was developed in 1959. However, it was not until the 1990s when full-scale synthesis was upscaled and optimized.

== Medical uses ==
Galantamine, sold under the brand name Razadyne among others, is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate vascular dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The first person to extract galantamine and theorize its usefulness in medicine, was the Bulgarian chemist Dimitar Paskov in 1959. In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia. Galantamine may not be effective for treating mild cognitive impairment.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is characterized by the impairment of cholinergic function. One hypothesis is that this impairment contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by the disease. This hypothesis forms the basis for use of galantamine as a cholinergic enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s. Galantamine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes acetylcholine. As a result of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, galantamine increases the availability of acetylcholine for synaptic transmission. Additionally, galantamine binds to the allosteric sites of nicotinic receptors, which causes a conformational change. This allosteric modulation increases the nicotinic receptor&#x27;s response to acetylcholine. The activation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors increases the release of acetylcholine, further increasing the availability of acetylcholine. Galantamine&#x27;s competitive inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and allosteric nicotinic modulation serves as a dual mechanism of action.

To reduce the prevalence of negative side effects associated with galantamine, such as nausea and vomiting, a dose-escalation scheme may be used. The use of a dose-escalation scheme has been well accepted in countries where galantamine is used. A dose-escalation scheme for Alzheimer&#x27;s treatment involves a recommended starting dosage of 4 mg galantamine tablets given twice a day (8 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks, the dosage may then be increased to 8 mg given twice a day (16 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks at 16 mg/day, the treatment may be increased to 12 mg given twice a day (24 mg/day). Dosage increases are based upon the assessment of clinical benefit as well as tolerability of the previous dosage. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, the process is usually restarted, beginning at the starting dosage, and re-escalating to the current dose. It has been found that a dosage between 16–24 mg/day is the optimal dosage.

In December 2023, the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for a pro-drug of galantamine called ALPHA-1062. In July 2024, The FDA approved benzgalantamine (Zunveyl), previously known as ALPHA-1062, to treat mild-to-moderate Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

== Side effects ==
The adverse effect profile of galantamine includes potential for allergic reaction, including hives, swelling of the face or throat, and skin rash. Using galantamine may cause chest pain, bloody urine, stomach bleeding, and liver injury, among other side effects. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and headache are considered common side effects.

A gradual titration over more than three months may enable long-term tolerability in some people.

Galantamine has a wide spectrum of interactions with other medications and medical disorders, requiring close assessment between the physician and patient.

== Pharmacology ==
Galantamine&#x27;s chemical structure contains a tertiary amine. At a neutral pH, this tertiary amine will often bond to a hydrogen, and appear mostly as an ammonium ion.

Galantamine is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) α4β2, α3β4, and α6β4, and chicken/mouse nAChRs α7/5-HT3 in certain areas of the brain. By binding to the allosteric site of the nAChRs, a conformational change occurs which increases the receptors response to acetylcholine. This modulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors on cholinergic neurons in turn causes an increase in the amount of acetylcholine released.
However, recent studies suggest that Galantamine does not functionally act at human nAChRs α4β2 or α7 as a positive allosteric modulator.

Galantamine also works as a weak competitive and reversible cholinesterase inhibitor in all areas of the body. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, it increases the concentration and thereby action of acetylcholine in certain parts of the brain. Galantamine&#x27;s effects on nAChRs and complementary acetylcholinesterase inhibition make up a dual mechanism of action. It is hypothesized that this action might relieve some of the symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s.

Galantamine in its pure form is a white powder. The atomic resolution 3D structure of the complex of galantamine and its target, acetylcholinesterase, was determined by X-ray crystallography in 1999 (PDB code: 1DX6; see complex). There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.

== Pharmacokinetics ==

Absorption of galantamine is rapid and complete and shows linear pharmacokinetics. It is well absorbed with absolute oral bioavailability between 80 and 100%. It has a terminal elimination half-life of seven hours. Peak effect of inhibiting acetylcholinesterase was achieved about one hour after a single oral dose of 8 mg in some healthy volunteers.

The coadministration of food delays the rate of galantamine absorption, but does not affect the extent of absorption.

Plasma protein binding of galantamine is about 18%, which is relatively low.

== Metabolism ==

Approximately 75% of a dose of galantamine is metabolised in the liver. In vitro studies have shown that hepatic CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are involved in galantamine metabolism. Within 24 hours of intravenous or oral administration approximately 20% of a dose of galantamine will be excreted unreacted in the urine.

In humans, several metabolic pathways for galantamine exist. These pathways lead to the formation of a number of different metabolites. One of the metabolites that may result can be formed through the glucuronidation of galantamine. Additionally, galantamine may undergo oxidation or demethylation at its nitrogen atom, forming two other possible metabolites. Galantamine can undergo demethylation at its oxygen atom, forming an intermediate which can then undergo glucuronidation or sulfate conjugation. Lastly, galantamine may be oxidized and then reduced before finally undergoing demethylation or oxidation at its nitrogen atom, or demethylation and subsequent glucuronidation at its oxygen atom.

==Drug interactions==
Since galantamine is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, inhibiting either of these isoenzymes will increase the cholinergic effects of galantamine. Inhibiting these enzymes may lead to adverse effects. It was found that paroxetine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the bioavailability of galantamine by 40%. The CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and erythromycin increased the bioavailability of galantamine by 30% and 12%, respectively.

== Extraction and synthesis ==

Since the alkaloid is isolated from botanical sources containing low amounts (0.1%) by weight, extraction yields are low. Although galantamine can be produced from natural resources, it also has many industrial syntheses, such as by Janssen, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Shire, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.

==Research==

===Organophosphate poisoning===
The toxicity of organophosphates results primarily from their action as irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase causes an increase in acetylcholine, as the enzyme is no longer available to catalyze its breakdown. In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine accumulation can cause an overstimulation of muscarinic receptors followed by a desensitization of nicotinic receptors. This leads to severe skeletal muscle fasciculations (involuntary contractions). The effects on the central nervous system include anxiety, restlessness, confusion, ataxia, tremors, seizures, cardiorespiratory paralysis, and coma. As a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine has the potential to serve as an effective organophosphate poisoning treatment by preventing irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Additionally, galantamine has anticonvulsant properties which may make it even more desirable as an antidote.

Research supported in part by the US Army has led to a US patent application for the use of galantamine and/or its derivatives for treatment of organophosphate poisoning. The indications for use of galantamine in the patent application include poisoning by nerve agents &quot;including but not limited to soman, sarin, and VX, tabun, and Novichok agents&quot;. Galantamine was studied in the research cited in the patent application for use along with the well-recognized nerve agent antidote atropine. According to the investigators, an unexpected synergistic interaction occurred between galantamine and atropine in an amount of 6 mg/kg or higher. Increasing the dose of galantamine from 5 to 8 mg/kg decreased the dose of atropine needed to protect experimental animals from the toxicity of soman in dosages 1.5 times the dose generally required to kill half the experimental animals.

===Autism===
Galantamine given in addition to risperidone to autistic children has been shown to improve some of the symptoms of autism such as irritability, lethargy, and social withdrawal. Additionally, the cholinergic and nicotinic receptors are believed to play a role in attentional processes. Some studies have noted that cholinergic and nicotinic treatments have improved attention in autistic children. As such, it is hypothesized that galantamine&#x27;s dual action mechanism might have a similar effect in treating autistic children and adolescents.

===Anesthesia===
Galantamine may have some limited use in reducing the side-effects of anesthetics ketamine and diazepam. In one study, a control group of patients were given ketamine and diazepam and underwent anesthesia and surgery. The experimental group was given ketamine, diazepam, and nivalin (of which the active ingredient is galantamine). The degree of drowsiness and disorientation of the two groups was then assessed 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after surgery. The group that had taken nivalin were found to be more alert 5, 10, and 15 minutes after the surgery.

=== Oneirogen ===

Galantamine is known to have oneirogenic properties. Research has demonstrated its potential to increase dream recall, dream self-awareness and dream vividness. The enhancement of such dream properties can facilitate the induction of lucid dreams.

<doc id="1214933" wikidata="Q566895" url="?curid=1214933" title="Annie Adams Fields">
<text>Annie Adams Fields (June 6, 1834 – January 5, 1915) was an American writer. Among her writings are collections of poetry and essays as well as several memoirs and biographies of her literary acquaintances. She was also interested in philanthropic work, in which she found her greatest pleasure. Her later years were spent as a companion to author Sarah Orne Jewett.

== Adolescence ==
Fields attended George B. Emerson&#x27;s School for Young Ladies, Boston&#x27;s most influential private secondary school for girls, where students were taught to read independently and trained to appreciate nature. She followed Emerson&#x27;s advice about ongoing education by studying foreign languages, literature, nature, history, travel books, and biography, and cultivating one&#x27;s &quot;power of expression.&quot; Upon his suggestion, Fields began to keep a diary, though she usually kept her own feelings out of it. She sometimes recorded good thoughts or beautiful images which are presented or suggested by observing, reading, or conversing, and she often concentrated on recording table talk of her, often, eminent guests. The fullest congruence of Emerson&#x27;s advice to his students and Annie Field&#x27;s activities stems from his repeated insistence that &quot;every good life is necessarily devoted, directly or indirectly, to the service of mankind.&quot;

==Biography==
===1834–1881===
She was born Ann West Adams in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 9, 1834, the sixth of seven children of Zabdiel Boylston Adams and Sarah May Holland Adams. Among her siblings was her brother Zabdiel Boylston Adams Jr. As a girl, she was enrolled at the School for Young Ladies in Boston operated by George Barrell Emerson, where she was encouraged to read, learned Italian, developed an interest in self-expression, and came to appreciate nature.

She married James T. Fields on November 15, 1854, in King&#x27;s Chapel in Boston with a service conducted by Reverend Ezra Stiles Gannett. She was his second wife; his first was a cousin of hers. Her husband was a well-established and respected publisher and with him she encouraged up and coming writers such as Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman, and Emma Lazarus. She was equally at home with great and established figures including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose biography she compiled. At their home at 148 Charles Street in Boston, she established a regular literary salon where authors gathered. Fields was also a philanthropist and social reformer; in particular, she founded the Holly Tree Inns, coffeehouses serving inexpensive and nutritious meals, and the Lincoln Street Home, a safe and inexpensive residence for unmarried working women.

Fields and her husband became close personal friends with many of the authors with whom the publishing house worked, often hosting them at their home for dinner parties and overnight stays. In 1868, however, Fields&#x27;s friend Mary Abigail Dodge (&quot;Gail Hamilton&quot;) became suspicious of poor treatment by Ticknor and Fields and believed she deserved a higher royalty payment. James Fields initially ignored her complaints. Dodge abruptly ended her friendship with Annie Fields in February. A month later, Fields recorded her distress over the situation in her journal: &quot;We do not forget to feel still the savagery... of Gail Hamilton... I really thought she cared for me! And now to find it was a pretense or a stepping-stone merely is something to shudder over. And all for a little of this world&#x27;s poor money!&quot; After months of dispute, Dodge anonymously published &quot;A Battle of the Books&quot; in 1870 chronicling her negative experiences.

===1881–1915===
After Fields&#x27;s husband died in 1881, she continued to occupy the center of Boston literary life. The hallmark of Fields&#x27;s work is a sympathetic understanding of her friends, who happened to be the leading literary figures of her time.

Her closest friend was Sarah Orne Jewett, a novelist and story writer whom her husband had published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. Jewett paid a condolence visit to Annie Fields and Fields found solace in subsequent visits from Jewett. Jewett spent the winter of 1881–1882 with Fields at her Boston home. From then on, they shared their homes with one another for about half the year in Manchester-by-the-Sea, MA, and the other half of the year at 148 Charles Street in Boston. 

The English writer Mary Cowden Clarke referred to Fields and Jewett as a &quot;woman-couple&quot; but they were more commonly referred to as having a &quot;Boston marriage.&quot; Though some scholars have offered a cautious appraisal of the nature of the relationship between Jewett and Fields, modern scholarship documents evidence that Jewett and Fields considered themselves married. Jewett and Fields exchanged rings and vows, and on the one-year anniversary of their vows, Jewett wrote a poem, &quot;Do You Remember, Darling,&quot; depicting her commitment to and love of Fields. 

Fields and Jewett lived together for the rest of Jewett&#x27;s life (Jewett died in 1909). The two also traveled together, including in 1882 when they visited Ireland, England, Norway, Belgium, France, Switzerland and Italy together. During the trip, Fields&#x27;s networks allowed them to meet with European authors like Charles Reade, William Makepeace Thackeray, and the family of Charles Dickens. They visited Europe again together in 1892, 1898, and 1900.

After Jewett&#x27;s death, Fields published her correspondence with Jewett in &quot;Letters of Sarah Orne Jewett&quot; in 1911. Women in Boston marriages in the 19th century most often kept their correspondence private or destroyed it, so the survival and publication of Jewett and Fields&#x27; letters provides rare documentation of one of the most famous Boston marriages of the time. Though deeply personal passages were edited out after urging from their mutual friend Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe leading some biographers to describe Jewett and Fields&#x27;s relationship as a friendship, the correspondence depicts their deep love for each other. 

==Legacy==

Fields died in 1915 and is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, alongside her husband.
Fields&#x27;s literary importance lies primarily in two areas: one is the influence she exerted over her husband in the selection of works to be published by Ticknor and Fields, the major publishing house of the time. He valued her judgement as reflecting a woman&#x27;s point of view.

Second, Fields edited important collections of letters and biographical sketches. Her subjects included her husband, James T. Fields, John Greenleaf Whittier, Celia Thaxter, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, as well as the Jewett letter collection. While these are not critical, scholarly works (the Jewett collection, especially, is heavily edited), they do provide primary material for the researcher. Her book &quot;Authors and Friends&quot; (1896) is a series of sketches, the best of which are of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Celia Thaxter. Fields&#x27;s diaries remain unpublished, except for excerpts published by M. A. DeWolfe Howe in 1922.

She and her husband were friends with many of the main literary figures of their time, including Willa Cather, Mary Ellen Chase, William Dean Howells, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Alfred Tennyson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Mark Twain, Sarah Wyman Whitman, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Lydia Maria Child, Charles Dudley Warner and John Greenleaf Whittier.

Fields remains a somewhat puzzling figure. Her writings reflect a traditional orientation toward sentimentalism and the cult of true womanhood. However, she was a supporter of &quot;women&#x27;s emancipation&quot;, and her relationship with Jewett and others suggests a less traditional side. She left for posterity a carefully polished public persona, that of the perfect hostess, the genteel lady, and it is difficult to find the real person underneath.

The site of her Charles Street home is a stop on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

<text>Vegard Skogheim (born 28 April 1966) is a Norwegian football coach and former player who played as a midfielder.

During his active career, he played for HamKam, Werder Bremen and Viking. He had a total of 197 matches and 36 goals in the Norwegian Premier League. Skogheim played 13 matches for the Norway national football team and scored a goal.

As a coach, he has been in charge of Lillehammer and Brumunddal, and has been managing Kongsvinger with success, securing promotion from Second Division in 2003, and almost repeating the feat in First Division in 2004. During winter 2006, Kongsvinger informed him, they would not sign him up for another contract, and thus he made his exit, joining former Lillestrøm coach Arne Erlandsen in his old club HamKam on 13 November 2006. Here, he acted as a player developer and assistant coach. On 11 June 2009, Skogheim was appointed new head coach of HamKam. He resigned after three games of the 2014 Norwegian First Division.

After Asker was relegated from the 2022 2. divisjon, Skogheim was sacked as head coach. He returned to Hamkam as a scout.

<text>In medieval and early modern Europe, a tenant-in-chief (or vassal-in-chief) was a person who held his lands under various forms of feudal land tenure directly from the king or territorial prince to whom he did homage, as opposed to holding them from another nobleman or senior member of the clergy. The tenure was one which denoted great honour, but also carried heavy responsibilities. The tenants-in-chief were originally responsible for providing knights and soldiers for the king&#x27;s feudal army.

==Terminology==
The Latin term was &quot;tenens in capite&quot;.

Other names for tenant-in-chief were &quot;captal&quot; or baron, although the latter term evolved in meaning. For example, the term &quot;baron&quot; was used in the &quot;Cartae Baronum&quot; of 1166, a return of all tenants-in-chief in England. At that time the term was understood to mean the &quot;king&#x27;s barons&quot;, or &quot;king&#x27;s men&quot;, because baron could still have a broader meaning. Originally, for example in Domesday Book (1086), there was a small number of powerful English tenants-in-chief under the Norman king who were all magnates directly associated with the king.

Later, as laid-out by I. J. Sanders, the old tenancies-in-chief of England from the time of the Norman king, King Henry I of England, came to have a legally distinct form of feudal land holding, the so-called tenure &quot;per baroniam&quot;. The term &quot;baron&quot; thus came to be used mainly for these &quot;feudal barons&quot;, which comprised a group that over-lapped with the tenancies-in-chief, but was not identical.

==History==
In most countries allodial property could be held by laypeople or the Christian Church. However, in the Kingdom of England after the Norman Conquest, the king became in law the sole lord paramount and only holder of land by allodial title. Thus all the lands in England became the property of the Crown. A tenure by frankalmoin, which in other countries was regarded as a form of privileged allodial holding, was in England regarded as a feudal tenement. Every land-holding was deemed by feudal custom to be no more than an estate in land, whether directly or indirectly held of the king. Absolute title in land could only be held by the king himself, the most anyone else could hold was a right over land, not a title in land &quot;per se&quot;. In England, a tenant-in-chief could enfief, or grant fiefs carved out of his own holding, to his own followers. The creation of subfiefs under a tenant-in-chief or other fief-holder was known as subinfeudation. The kings of the House of Normandy, however, eventually imposed on all free men who occupied a tenement (i.e. those whose tenures were &quot;freehold&quot;, that is to say for life or heritable by their heirs), a duty of fealty to the crown rather than to their immediate lord who had enfeoffed them. This was to diminish the possibility of sub-vassals being employed by tenants-in-chief against the crown.

In the great feudal survey Domesday Book (1086), tenants-in-chief were listed first in each English county&#x27;s entry. The lands held by a tenant-in-chief in England, if comprising a large feudal barony, were called an honour.

==Duties of tenants-in-chief==
As feudal lord, the king had the right to collect scutage from the barons who held these &quot;honours&quot;. Scutage (literally &quot;shield money&quot;, from &quot;escutcheon&quot;) was a tax collected from vassals in lieu of military service. The payment of scutage rendered the crown more independent of the feudal levy and enabled it to pay for troops on its own. Once a tenant-in-chief received a demand for scutage, the cost was passed on to the sub-tenants and thus came to be regarded as a universal land tax. This tax was a development from the taxation system created under the Anglo-Saxon kings to raise money to pay off the invading Danes, the so-called Danegeld.

===Heirs===
When an English tenant-in-chief died, an inquisition post mortem was held in each county in which he held land and his or her land temporarily escheated (i.e. reverted) to the demesne of the crown until the heir paid a sum of money (a relief), and was then able to take possession (livery of seisin) of the lands. However, if the heir was underage (under 21 for a male heir, under 14 for an heiress) they would be subject to a &quot;feudal wardship&quot; where the custody of their lands and the right to arrange their marriage passed to the monarch, until they came of age. The wardship and marriage was not usually kept in Crown hands, but was sold, often simply to the highest bidder, unless outbid by the next of kin.

When an heir came of age, he or she passed out of wardship but could not enter upon their inheritance until, like all heirs of full age on inheritance, they had sued out their livery. In either case, the process was complicated. Eventually a warrant was issued for the livery to pass under the Great Seal. From its inception in 1540, The Court of Wards and Liveries administered the funds received from the wardships, marriages and the granting of livery; both courts and practice were abolished in 1646 and the whole system of feudal tenure – except for fee simple – was abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660.

<text>Thomas William Gould, VC (28 December 1914 – 6 December 2001) was a Royal Navy sailor and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was one of three Jewish recipients of the Victoria Cross in the Second World War.

==Second World War==

Gould was 27 years old, and a petty officer in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 16 February 1942 north of Crete, in the Mediterranean, HM Submarine &quot;Thrasher&quot;, after attacking and sinking a supply ship, was itself attacked. &quot;Thrasher&quot; was subjected to a three-hour depth charge attack and aerial bombing.

When after dark the submarine surfaced, two unexploded bombs were discovered in the gun-casing. Petty Officer Gould and Lieutenant Peter Scawen Watkinson Roberts volunteered to remove the bombs, which were of a type unknown to them. They removed the first one without too much difficulty, but the second bomb had penetrated the side plating of the gun emplacement, and then the deck casing above the pressure hull.

Roberts and Gould entered the confined space (which was no more than high in places), and lying flat, wormed past deck supports, battery ventilators, and drop bollards. The petty officer then lay on his back with the 150 lb bomb in his arms while the lieutenant dragged him along by the shoulders. &quot;It was then a matter of the two of us, lying horizontally, pushing and pulling the bomb back through the casing. It was pitch black and the bomb was making this horrible ticking noise while the submarine was being buffeted by the waves&quot;.
They pushed and dragged the bomb for a distance of some until it could be lowered over the side. Every time the bomb was moved there was a loud twanging noise as of a broken spring which added nothing to their peace of mind. &quot;Thrasher&quot; was surfaced, stationary, and close inshore to enemy waters. If the submarine was forced to crash dive while they were in the casing, they must have been drowned. It was 50 minutes before they got the bomb clear, wrapped it in sacking, and dropped it over the side.

In August 1943 Gould received a Mention in Despatches after the submarine &quot;Truculent&quot; sank &quot;U-308&quot; off the Faroes on 4 June 1943.

==Later life==

Tommy Gould went on to become one of the founders of the 43 Group, a group of Jewish ex-servicemen who fought the Fascists after the Second World War.

His VC was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for £44,000 in October 1987. His medals are held by the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women, in the Jewish Museum London in Camden.

<text>Andrea McArdle (born November 5, 1963) is an American singer and actress best known for originating the role of Annie in the Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot;.

==Career==
McArdle appeared on &quot;Al Alberts Showcase&quot;, a local televised talent show in Philadelphia. 

In 1977 she originated the role of Annie in the Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Musical. In April 1978, she opened the London West End production in the same role. She appeared several times on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1977-79, on one occasion accompanied by Liberace. She also appeared more than once on the &quot;Mike Douglas Show&quot;, singing with Kristy McNichol, Stephanie Mills, Liberace and Don Rickles. She appeared on Perry Como&#x27;s Christmas show, where she sang with Como, and on &quot;Welcome Back Kotter&quot;, playing Arnold Horshack&#x27;s younger sister.

In 1979, she sang the national anthems for both the United States and Canada at the Major League Baseball All Star Game in Seattle, Washington. She also sang the American national anthem at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia for the fifth and final game of the 1983 World Series, in her capacity as a native of Philadelphia.

Her first role after returning to the States was the role of Judy Garland in NBC&#x27;s telepic &quot;Rainbow&quot;, but throughout her career she has concentrated primarily on performing in musical theater and cabarets. Her credits include &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (both on Broadway and in the national tour), &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot; (a revue of Jerry Herman songs co-starring Carol Channing and Leslie Uggams), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, &quot;Meet Me In St. Louis&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;, and another celebrated Annie in Irving Berlin&#x27;s classic, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. She briefly appeared in the 1999 Rob Marshall-directed TV version of &quot;Annie&quot;, singing the &quot;Star To Be&quot; segment of the song &quot;N.Y.C.&quot;

McArdle has performed in the showrooms of many of the casino hotels in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, and in cabarets such as Odette&#x27;s in New Hope, Pennsylvania and the King Cole Room at the St. Regis Hotel and Freddy&#x27;s Supper Club in Manhattan. McArdle once again starred in the musical &quot;Annie&quot; with the North Carolina Theatre Company, although she portrayed the role of Miss Hannigan, at odds with her former character.

Her CD, &quot;Andrea McArdle on Broadway&quot;, was arranged and produced by her ex-husband, composer Edd Kalehoff, who also collaborated with her on an album of Christmas songs that was released in conjunction with her Family Christmas Show at the Tropicana Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The Christmas show, &quot;Andrea McArdle&#x27;s Family Christmas&quot; ran for three Christmases and featured dancers, singers and acrobats from Encore Productions in South Jersey. McArdle also sang and appeared in several television promotional campaigns produced by Kalehoff, including WNBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re 4 New York&quot; in 1992, and WEWS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Give Me 5&quot; in 1995. Divorced in August 2011, the couple had one daughter, Alexis Kalehoff (b.1988), a performer who has appeared with her mother in &quot;Les Miz&quot;.

McArdle returned to &quot;Annie&quot; at Musical Theatre West in Long Beach, California, as Miss Hannigan from October 29 - November 14, 2010. She took part in the New York Musical Theatre Festival&#x27;s (NYMF) production of &quot;Greenwood the Musical&quot; in fall 2011 along with her daughter Alexis Kalehoff and fellow Annie alumna Alicia Morton.

In November 2012, McArdle was the &quot;guest star&quot; in &quot;Newsical&quot;.

On April 2, 2014 Oceania Cruises announced a new &quot;Life in the Theater&quot; series featuring McArdle, for select sailings starting with a voyage aboard Riviera on October 29, 2014.

In December 2015, McArdle starred in the Off-Broadway play &quot;2 Across&quot; at St. Luke&#x27;s Theatre along with Kip Gilman.

In May 2016, McArdle starred as Reno Sweeney in Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. The show also featured Sally Struthers. The production opened at Gateway Playhouse (Bellport, New York), and later transferred to Ogunquit Playhouse. The production was directed by Jayme McDaniel, and choreographed by Jason Wise.

In November 2021, it was announced that McArdle would be playing Eleanor Roosevelt in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Annie Live!&quot;, but she later had to drop out due to a family emergency. The character was subsequently written out, but McArdle does appear in the cast recording for the special.

==Personal life==
Andrea was married to composer Edd Kalehoff from 1988 until they divorced in 2011. She has a daughter, Alexis Kalehoff, who has appeared in many Broadway theatre productions.

<text>Percival Eric Gratwick, VC (19 October 1902 – 26 October 1942) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Gratwick was born in Katanning, Western Australia on 19 October 1902, the fifth son of the local postmaster. Leaving school at the age of 16, he took up various jobs which included a period as a messenger at Parliament House. Later he worked as a blacksmith, a drover and a prospector.

==Second World War==
Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Gratwick sought to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF). However, issues with his nose, which had been broken years earlier, led to the rejection of his application. In late 1940, after expensive medical treatment on his nose, he attempted to enlist again, this time successfully.

Following completion of his training in July 1941, Gratwick embarked for Libya, where he was assigned to the 2/48th Battalion (a South Australian unit) with the rank of private. The battalion was among the defenders of Tobruk but was transferred to Palestine in October 1941. By June 1942, the battalion was in Egypt.

On the night of 25/26 October 1942 during the Second Battle of El Alamein, Egypt, the platoon to which Gratwick belonged suffered considerable casualties attacking Trig 29, including the platoon commander and sergeant. Gratwick, realising the seriousness of the situation, charged a German machine-gun position by himself, and killed the crew with hand grenades. He also killed a mortar crew. Under heavy machine-gun fire Gratwick then charged a second post, using his rifle and bayonet. In inflicting further casualties he was killed by machine-gun fire, but his brave and determined action, for which he would be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, enabled his company to capture the final objective.

Gratwick is buried in El Alamein Commonwealth cemetery, and his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Museum of Western Australia in Fremantle, Western Australia. In Port Hedland, Western Australia, Gratwick Street, the Gratwick Aquatic Centre and the town theatre and community hall are all named in his honour.

<doc id="1214960" wikidata="Q6681483" url="?curid=1214960" title="Lorne MacLaine Campbell">
<text>Brigadier Lorne MacLaine Campbell, (22 July 1902 – 25 May 1991) was a British Army officer and a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Lorne MacLaine Campbell was born on 22 July 1902 in Airds, Argyll, Scotland, the eldest of three sons of Colonel Ian Campbell and Hilda Mary Wade. He was schooled at the Dulwich College Preparatory School, and then at Dulwich College in South London between 1915 and 1921 (as was his uncle and fellow recipient of the Victoria Cross, Vice Admiral Gordon Campbell). Between 1921 and 1925, he attended Merton College, Oxford, where he was President of the Junior Common Room and of the Myrmidon Club and graduated with a second class degree in Literae Humaniores, after which he joined the family wine shipping company.

==Military service==
Campbell was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 8th battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Territorial Army) on 23 September 1921, then under the command of his father. By 1939, Campbell was a major and second-in-command of the battalion.

===Second World War===
In August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, Campbell&#x27;s unit, the 8th (Argyllshire) Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was mobilised for war service. Serving as part of the 154th Infantry Brigade, which also included the 7th Battalion, Argylls and the 6th Battalion, Black Watch, of Major General Victor Fortune&#x27;s 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, the battalion underwent months of training before departing for France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in January 1940. During the Battle of France in May–June 1940 Campbell was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for gallant leadership during the 51st Division&#x27;s withdrawal to the coast when, although most of the division was captured at Saint-Valery-en-Caux, Campbell and most of the 154th Brigade managed to reach Le Havre and were evacuated.

After returning the battalion, which had suffered very heavy losses, was reformed with large numbers of reinforcements. In 1942 he became Commanding Officer of the 7th Battalion, Argylls (although it was then designated as the 7th/10th Battalion), still serving as part of the 154th Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division, reformed in August 1940 by the redesignation of the 9th (Highland) Infantry Division, and led the battalion overseas to North Africa in August 1942. At the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942, Campbell received a Bar to his DSO for his part in the capture of important objectives. He led the battalion, after El Alamein, throughout the Tunisian campaign, at El Agheila, in the capture of the Libyan port of Tripoli, Medenine, and Wadi Akarit, where he gained his Victoria Cross. On 28 April, shortly before the campaign came to an end, Campbell became acting commander of the 153rd Brigade.

On 20 May Campbell was promoted to the acting rank of brigadier and took command of the 13th Infantry Brigade, part of the 5th Infantry Division. The brigade, a Regular Army formation, was then serving in Syria, later moving to Egypt, before taking part in the Allied invasion of Sicily, from July until mid-August. After a brief rest, the division, participated in the Allied invasion of Italy, Campbell leading the brigade throughout the 5th Division&#x27;s involvement in the Italian campaign, seeing service during the Moro River Campaign, the Battle of Monte Cassino, and the Battle of Anzio, before leaving Italy in early July 1944 to return to Egypt, later Palestine, to rest and refit. For eight days in April, he was acting General Officer Commanding of the 5th Division, when the division was in the Anzio beachhead, in place of Major General Philip Gregson-Ellis. Relinquishing command of the brigade in September, Campbell ended the war in the United States, in Washington D.C. as a brigadier with the British Army Staff.

====Victoria Cross====
Campbell was a 40 years old temporary lieutenant colonel in the 7th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s), British Army, during the Second World War at Wadi Akarit in Tunisia. The citation in &quot;the London Gazette&quot; read:

==Personal life==

In December 1935 Campbell married Amy Muriel Jordan. The couple had two sons, Alastair Lorne Campbell of Airds (b. 1937) and Patrick Gordon Campbell (b. 1939).

Following demobilisation, Campbell returned to the wine trade, became a liveryman of the Vintners&#x27; Company, and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1968.

Campbell died at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Edinburgh on 25 May 1991, aged 88, and is buried in Warriston Cemetery in Edinburgh in the upper northern section. His medals are on display at the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Museum in Stirling Castle.

<text>Lieutenant George Albert Cairns VC (12 December 1913 – 19 March 1944) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
George Albert Cairns was born in London on 12 December 1913 and educated at Sir Henry Compton School Fulham (now Fulham Cross Academy) 19231930. He spent the early 1940s in Sidcup, Kent, working at a bank. He met his future wife, Ena, at the same bank. They were married in 1941 and a year later he went to war.

==Details==
Cairns was a lieutenant in The Somerset Light Infantry (Prince Albert&#x27;s), British Army, attached to the South Staffordshire Regiment in Burma during the Second World War. The South Staffordshire Regiment was a Chindit battalion, part of 77th Indian Infantry Brigade under the command of Brigadier Michael Calvert. He was 30 years old when he performed the deed for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

On the evening of 16 March 1944, the South Staffords dug in near what would become a main hinge of the Chindit operation, the block at Henu and Mawlu, known as the White City. A nearby hill crowned with a Pagoda dominated the horizon. It was not occupied by the British or, so far as those present could tell, by the Japanese. The following morning a number of unsuspecting Japanese soldiers were discovered in the area. It was plain that the South Staffords had dug in their positions adjacent to a small Japanese force without either learning of the other&#x27;s presence. At about 11:00am, the hill erupted with enemy fire.

Calvert, who led the attack in person, wrote &quot;On the top of Pagoda Hill, not much bigger than two tennis courts, an amazing scene developed. The small white Pagoda was in the centre of the hill. Between that and the slopes which came up was a mêlée of South Staffords and Japanese bayonetting, fighting with each other, with some Japanese just throwing grenades from the flanks into the mêlée.&quot; Calvert added, &quot;there, at the top of the hill, about fifty yards square, an extraordinary mêlée took place, everyone shooting, bayoneting, kicking at everyone else, rather like an officers&#x27; guest night.&quot;

During the attack Cairns was attacked by a Japanese officer who with his sword hacked off the lieutenant&#x27;s left arm. Cairns killed the officer and retrieved the fallen sword before wounding several other Japanese. He subsequently collapsed and perished the following day. Calvert wrote, &quot;[i]n front I saw Lieut. Cairns have his harm hacked off by a Jap, whom he shot. He picked up the sword and carried on. Finally we drive them back behind the Pagoda&quot;.

Lieutenant Norman Durant, commanding one of South Staffordshire Regiment’s machine gun platoons, was involved in the action on Pagoda Hill. He described the action in a long letter to his family: The first thing I saw on reaching the path was horrible hand-to-hand struggle going on further up the hill. George Cairns and a Jap were struggling and choking on the ground, and as I picked up a Jap rifle and climbed up towards them I saw George break free and, picking up a rifle bayonet, stab the Jap again and again like a madman. It was only when I got near that I saw he himself had already been bayoneted twice through the side and that his left arm was hanging on by a few strips of muscle. How he had found the strength to fight was a miracle, but the effort had been too much and he died the next morning.

After a brief &quot;intermission,&quot; Calvert’s forces broke the Japanese resistance, driving them from the area: The fighting had been not unlike that depicted un scenes from ancient battles in the closeness of the hand-to-hand grappling before the Japs finally broke. In spite of our casualties, we hard all that elation of the winners of a good battle, especially of a bayonet charge…I spoke to Lieut. Cairns before he died. &#x27;Have we won sir? Was it all right? Did we do our stuff? Don&#x27;t worry about me.&#x27; Five years later His Majesty graciously awarded Lieut. Cairns the Victoria Cross…We counted forty-two Jap dead, including four officers. More were shot and killed or wounded by our machine guns as they struggled across the open paddy, with the Japs giving them some covering fire from Mawlu, 800 yards across the paddy on to Pagoda Hill.

Cairns&#x27;s batman, Private N. Coales wrote &quot;He died a hero.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Cairns was buried at Taukkyan War Cemetery in Burma. His grave is located at Plot 6, Row A, Grave 4. A stone memorial similar to a headstone commemorates Cairns at St Mary the Virgin Church, Brighstone, Isle of Wight.

Cairns&#x27; VC was the last to be gazetted for the Second World War as the original recommendation was with General Wingate when he was killed in an air crash. The recommendation was revived following a BBC broadcast of Cairns&#x27; actions in December 1948. According to an article published in &quot;the Times&quot; Saturday 21 May 1949: The original recommendation for the award of the V.C. to Lieutenant Cairns was submitted to the late General Wingate after the usual evidence of three witnesses had been checked. The aircraft carrying General Wingate and the records crashed, the general being killed and all the records destroyed. Later, when the proposal was retrieved, it was found that two of the three witnesses had been killed and this led to further delay. Some six weeks ago the former Brigade Commander of the 77th Brigade (now Major Calvert) had the case reopened. Meanwhile, after listening to a broadcast in which her husband&#x27;s bravery was mentioned, Mrs. Cairns, who lives at Sidcup, approached her M.P., Mr. G. D. Wallace, who made representations to the War Office on her behalf. Wallace told the Daily Telegraph that he &quot;hoped [approaching the war office] would mean recognition not only for her husband but for herself and the grand fight she had put up.&quot; Cairns&#x27;s wife, Ena Cairns, continued to work in the bank where she had first met her husband.

The Victoria Cross citation, published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; reads:
Cairns&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of the Staffordshire Regiment in Whittington, Staffordshire.

<text>Lieutenant Willward Alexander Sandys-Clarke VC (8 June 1919 – 23 April 1943) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
He was born in Southport, and was educated at Uppingham School. He married Dorothy Irene Deakin at the United Reformed Church in Belmont, Lancashire in 1941, and they lived in Egerton, near Bolton.

==Details==
Sandys-Clarke was a 23-year-old lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), British Army during the Second World War when he was awarded the VC.

On 23 April 1943 at Guiriat El Atach, Tunisia, Lieutenant Clarke&#x27;s company was counter-attacked and almost wiped out, he being the sole remaining officer. Although wounded in the head, he gathered a composite platoon together and advancing to attack the position again met heavy fire from a machine-gun post. He manoeuvred his men to give covering fire and then tackled the post single-handed, killing or capturing the crew and knocking out the gun. He dealt similarly with two other posts and then led his platoon to the objective, but was killed when he later went forward to tackle two sniper posts single-handed.

==Further information==
Sandys-Clarke was related to four other recipients of the award: 
* Gen. Walter Congreve (Colenso)
* Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts (Khudaganj)
* Lt. Frederick Roberts (Colenso)
* Maj. William Congreve (Somme)

The medal is retained by his family and is not on public display.

<text>Company Sergeant Major George Harold Eardley VC, MM (6 May 1912 – 11 September 1991) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Brother of Arnold Eardley and Elgin Eardley.

==Biography==

Eardley was 32 years old, and an acting sergeant in the 4th Battalion, King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry, British Army during the Second World War when he was awarded the VC.

On 16 October 1944, east of Overloon, the Netherlands, Sergeant Eardley&#x27;s platoon was ordered to clear some orchards where a strong opposition was holding up the advance, but away from the objective the platoon was halted by automatic fire from machine-gun posts. Sergeant Eardley spotted one of these posts and moving forward under heavy fire killed the occupants at the post with a grenade. He went on to destroy two more posts single-handed, under fire so intense that it daunted those who were with him, but his action enabled the platoon to achieve its objective and thus ensured the success of the whole attack.

He later was appointed company sergeant major (CSM).

Eardley was interred at Macclesfield Cemetery in Cheshire.

==Medals and Honours==

George Harold Eardley VC MM was awarded the following medals:
*Victoria Cross
*Military Medal
*1939-1945 Star
*France and Germany Star
*Defence Medal
*1939-1945 Medal
*Croix de Guerre
*Elizabeth II Coronation Medal
*Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal

A statue was erected in his home town of Congleton on 18 April 2004.

<text>General Sir Alexander Stanhope Cobbe (6 June 1870 – 29 June 1931) was a senior British Indian Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Alexander Stanhope Cobbe was born on 5 June 1870 in Nainital, Bengal Presidency, British India, the third child and second son of Lieutenant General Sir Alexander Hugh Cobbe and Emily Barbara Cobbe, née Jones. Alexander had two sisters and four brothers; of the latter two became lieutenant colonels in the British Army and one a captain in the Royal Navy. In 1881, he was a pupil at Eagle House School, Wimbledon. He went on to Wellington College and then followed his elder brother Henry Hercules Cobbe to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from where he passed out in 1889. At the age of 19 he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the South Wales Borderers.

==Military career==

The highlights of Cobbe&#x27;s military career can be tracked by the regular records of his promotions and deeds published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;. In March 1892, he was promoted to lieutenant, and later in the same year, he was seconded to the Indian Army Staff Corps. This secondment led to his permanent transfer from the South Wales Borderers in 1894. The purpose of the Indian Staff Corps was not only to provide officers for headquarters&#x27; staff but, far more broadly, for the native Indian regiments, the army departments and also for civil and political appointments for which Indian Army officers might be eligible. In 1903, in order to avoid confusion, the designation &#x27;Indian Staff Corps&#x27; as applied to officers on regimental duty was withdrawn and replaced by the more appropriate term &#x27;Indian Army&#x27;, which is how Cobbe was referred to in all later &quot;Gazette&quot; entries. In India, in 1895 Cobbe gained his first medal, the India Medal (1895–1902), with the clasp “Relief of Chitral”. This campaign was one of the many on the Northwest Frontier to quell unrest against British rule.

His next medals, however, were to be gained in Africa. At this time many regiments of the Indian Army were sent to Africa to support British foreign policy in the region. On this continent Cobbe was kept busy on several minor colonial campaigns gaining him the Central Africa Medal with clasp &quot;Central Africa 1894–1898&quot;, the East and West Africa Medal (1887–1900) and the Africa General Service Medal with the clasp &quot;B.C.A 1898–1899&quot; (British Central Africa, later Nyasaland and today Malawi). In October 1899, Cobbe was appointed second in command of the 1st Battalion, Central African Rifles, and given the local rank of captain.

===Ashanti War===

By July 1900, Cobbe was commanding the Central Africa Regiment and had been given the local rank of major. Earlier that year, a major rebellion had erupted in West Africa, in what is now Ghana (Gold Coast), and this developed into the final campaign of the Ashanti Wars, known as the War of the Golden Stool.

The initial thrust of the campaign was to relieve the fort at Kumasi, which was achieved by the end of July. Cobbe was then sent out with a column of 300 men to help clear the surrounding area. In the dense bush, he came across a large body of the enemy protected by stout stockades. After heavy fighting, Cobbe managed to outflank the enemy and put them to flight, although himself being &quot;severely wounded&quot;. This did not prevent some veiled criticism from his commander concerning the delay in putting in the final attack and Cobbe did not feature among the 20 or so individuals mentioned in the despatch as being recommended for favourable notice for having &quot;rendered good service&quot;, although he was listed among those &quot;having done good work&quot;. Despite his wounds, by late September he was involved in further clearing up operations and led his men on the left flank of a major attack. On the right was Major Charles John Melliss, who was to be awarded the VC in this campaign. In the next despatch Cobbe was individually mentioned: &quot;Captain (local Major) A. S. Cobbe, Indian Staff Corps. – Severely wounded 6 August. He is an Officer to be thoroughly trusted, and commanded in several fights, where he invariably did well. I hope he will be rewarded.&quot; Cobbe was indeed rewarded as in November 1900 he was promoted to the substantive rank of captain in the Indian Staff Corps, and made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), as well as being awarded the Ashanti Medal with clasp &quot;Kumassi&quot;.

===Somaliland Campaign===

In January 1902, Cobbe was granted the local rank of lieutenant colonel and appointed Commandant of the 1st (Central Africa) Battalion, King&#x27;s African Rifles, and in this post, he deployed with his men to British Somaliland (now Somaliland) to take part in the Somaliland campaign or the &quot;Mad Mullah War&quot;. The Mullah Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, lead clergyman of King Diiriye Guure, had been agitating against British rule in the Somaliland Protectorate since 1899 and in 1901, a first British expedition beat him and his Dervish forces and caused him to retreat into the desert interior. However, by the end of the year the Diiriye Guure had recommenced raiding and a second expedition, including Cobbe and his men, was mounted against him. On 6 October, while marching through dense bush at Erigo, the British force was ambushed and then rushed by the Dervishes. Although the north face of the square was pierced and a Maxim gun lost, the Yao Company of the Central Africa Battalion recovered the situation. The Diiriye Guure force lost some 700 men and retreated. The British force was not able to continue the pursuit, and returned to Berbera. The Maxim lost during the battle was recovered in the last campaign against Diiriye Guure in 1920, and stands in the Malawi Army&#x27;s &quot;Cobbe Barracks&quot; in Zomba, Malawi.

====Victoria Cross====

It was at Erigo (or Erego) during this campaign that Cobbe was awarded his Victoria Cross. The announcement of the award was made in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 20 January 1903 with the description of his act of courage as follows:

===Further campaigning===

Still in British Somaliland in 1903, Cobbe was commanding a flying column ahead of the main body moving against Diiriye Guure. He had orders to secure the water supply at Wardair. Having established a zariba (a camp fortified with a thorn hedge) near Gumburu, he had cause to send forward a company of men under Lieutenant Colonel Plunkett to secure the return of a small scouting party. The company was overwhelmed by a large Dervish force and Plunkett, all his British and Indian soldiers, and most of the Central African soldiers with him were killed. It was a major disaster. Cobbe testified that he had given Plunkett strict instructions not to engage the main body of the enemy and explicitly stated that Plunkett had disobeyed his orders. Cobbe was at the final major battle of the war, Jidballi, on 10 January 1904, but seems to have attracted no mention in despatches. The Somali campaign added two clasps to his Africa General Service Medal: &quot;Somaliland 1902–04&quot; and &quot;Jidballi&quot;.

As a further reward for his services, in September 1904, Cobbe was &quot;noted for consideration of the Brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on attaining the rank of Major&quot; and in December 1907, immediately after having been promoted to the substantive rank of major, he was duly further promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel. In February of that year Cobbe, had been appointed a staff captain at headquarters in India, but that lasted only until February 1908, his new rank presumably deserving a more senior post. In April 1910, he was appointed a Staff Officer Grade 1 and in May 1912 he was promoted colonel with seniority from 2 December 1911 although, when appointed an Aide-de-Camp to the King in June 1912, he is described as a brevet colonel. In 1911, he was awarded King George V&#x27;s Coronation Medal.

===First World War===
Cobbe&#x27;s Grade I staff posting in India lasted until June 1914 and three months later he was in France. Michael Jones, in his book &quot;Colworth in Context&quot;, says, &quot;Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Cobbe VC, a career soldier, left in September 1914 to join an Indian Sikh regiment at the front line with William Eyre, one of Albert Bowen&#x27;s employees, as his personal servant&quot;. In February 1915 Cobbe was appointed a Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster General with the temporary rank of brigadier general. In a despatch of 14 January 1915 Field Marshal Sir John French, Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, mentioned Colonel Cobbe for gallant and distinguished service in the field. A similar mention was published in June 1915 and was soon followed by the appointment of Cobbe as a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In November 1915, he was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel in the British Indian Army. In the following month, Cobbe was yet again mentioned in French&#x27;s despatches for gallant and distinguished service in the field, this time in a list which also included his brother, Lieutenant Colonel H. H. Cobbe, DSO, 13th Lancers.

In February 1916, Cobbe handed over his staff job in France and in March was posted back to India as Director of Staff Duties and Military Training in Army Headquarters, while retaining his temporary rank. Following yet another mention for his good services in France, this time in a despatch from Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig dated April 1916, he was promoted to major general in June 1916, the appointment specifically stating that it was a reward for &quot;Distinguished Service in the Field&quot;. Within two months Cobbe was promoted to temporary lieutenant general, and in March 1917, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

By this time Cobbe was in Mesopotamia (now Iraq), where he would spend the rest of the war and stay until late 1919. As the commander of III Indian Corps, he served under three successive C-in-Cs, Mesopotamian Field Force, all of whom mentioned him generously in their despatches to the War Office. He was present at the capture of Kut-al-Amara in February 1917, and the capture of Baghdad the following month. Playing a notable role in the British successes at Samarrah in April, and at Ramadi in September 1917, Cobbe also defeated a Turk force at Sharqat in October 1918 (the final action on the Mesopotamian Front) before peacefully capturing Mosul in November 1918.

His service in the First World War added to Cobbe&#x27;s medal collection: the 1914 Star with clasp &quot;5thAug-22ndNov 1914&quot;, the British War Medal 1914–1920 and the Victory Medal 1914–1919. France appointed him a Commander of the Legion of Honour, and the King of Italy made him a Commander of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. In March 1919 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India.

==Later career==
In June 1919, Cobbe was made a substantive lieutenant general, and was appointed Military Secretary to the India Office in 1920. Promotion to general came in March 1926 just prior to his appointment as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of India&#x27;s Northern Command. On his return to England he was reappointed in June 1930 as Military Secretary to the India Office.

Honours continued to come Cobbe&#x27;s way. In 1922, he was appointed Colonel of his first regiment, The South Wales Borderers. In the 1928 New Year Honours, he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and in June 1930 he was appointed ADC General to His Majesty. The following month he was appointed Colonel of the Sikh Pioneers. However, a lifetime of soldiering in severe climates and arduous conditions had had its effect and, at the age of just 61, General Sir Alexander Cobbe died on 29 June 1931. He is buried alone in the churchyard of Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire.

==Family life==

On 1 October 1910, the 40-year-old Cobbe married the 23-year-old Winifred Ada Bowen, daughter of Sir Albert Bowen, 1st Baronet, and his wife Alice Anita Crowther. Sir Albert was the lord of the manor of Colworth, in the parish of Sharnbrook. It is not clear how much time Alexander Cobbe was able to spend with his wife in their 21 years of marriage, the First World War certainly caused them to be parted for long periods, with Winifred mainly staying at Colworth, however, they had two daughters, Winifred Alice (b 1912) and Anne Philippa and a son, Alexander William Locke, known as Bill, born 1919.

As a flying officer in the Royal Air Force, Bill Cobbe was killed on 8 September 1940 during the Battle of Britain.

==Legacy==

The headquarters of the Malawi Army are named the &quot;Cobbe Barracks&quot; in his honour. They are located at Zomba, the former capital, and are home to what were the King&#x27;s African Rifles (now the Malawi Rifles).

==The medal==

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh &quot;(The Barracks, Brecon, Powys, Wales)&quot;.

<text>The Treaty of Bucharest (1918) was a peace treaty between Romania and the opposing Central Powers following the stalemate reached after the campaign of 1917. This left Romania isolated after Russia&#x27;s unilateral exit from World War I (see the Armistice of Focșani and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk).

Following the Central Powers&#x27; ultimatum issued during the between Ferdinand I of Romania and Ottokar Czernin, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, on at the Răcăciuni railway station, King Ferdinand summoned a on in Iași, the Romanian capital-in-exile. After long and difficult discussions, which lasted 3 days, and despite the strong opposition of Queen Marie and General Constantin Prezan, the Crown Council decided to accept the ultimatum and send envoys to Buftea to negotiate a preliminary peace treaty. The preliminary peace treaty was concluded on , by which Romania accepted frontier rectifications in favor of Austria-Hungary, to cede the whole of Dobruja, to demobilize at least 8 divisions, to evacuate the Austro-Hungarian territory still in its possession and to allow the transport of Central Powers&#x27; troops through Western Moldavia and Bessarabia towards Odessa.

Alexandru Marghiloman, then Prime Minister of Romania, signed the final treaty at the Cotroceni Palace, Bucharest, on and it was ratified by the Chamber of Deputies on 28 June and by the Senate on 4 July 1918. However, King Ferdinand refused to sign or promulgate it.

==Terms==
* Romania and the Central Powers declared the end of the state of war between them and that the diplomatic and consular relations between them would be resumed.
* Demobilization of the Romanian forces
** Of Romania&#x27;s 15 infantry divisions, divisions 11th to 15th were to be disbanded. Of the remaining 10 divisions, the two in Bessarabia were allowed to remain on a war footing, together with the &quot;Vânători&quot; battalions left over from the disbanded &quot;Vânători&quot; divisions, as well as the two Romanian cavalry divisions, until the military operations carried out by the Central Powers in Ukraine would eliminate the danger at the Romanian eastern frontier. The remaining eight divisions would remain on a reduced peace footing: four infantry regiments of three battalions each, two cavalry regiments of two squadrons each, two field artillery regiments of seven batteries each, one battalion of pioneers and the necessary technical troops and convoys. The total force of these eight infantry divisions could not exceed 20,000 men, that of the cavalry 3,200 men and that of the artillery 9,000 men. The divisions in Bessarabia were also to be decreased, in case of demobilization, to the peace footing on the basis of the eight divisions mentioned above.
** The ordnance, machine guns, hand arms, horses, wagons and munitions made available during the reduction or disbanding of the Romanian troops were to be transferred to the high command of the Central Powers&#x27; forces and to be guarded by Romanian depot troops. Ammunition left with the Romanian divisions on peace footing was limited to 250 cartridges per musket, 2500 cartridges per machine gun, and 150 shots for each piece of ordnance. The divisions mobilized in Bessarabia were allowed to retain their ammunition needed for the state of war.
** The demobilized troops were to remain in Moldavia until the evacuation of the occupied Romanian territory by the Central Powers, with the exception of the depot troops mentioned at article V. The troops in active service had to secure the permission of the Central Powers&#x27; high command if they wanted to pass into the occupied territory.
** Romania and the Central Powers would appoint an officer from their respective General Staff as liaison officer to the other party.
** The Romanian fluvial and maritime forces were allowed to remain intact until the conditions in Bessarabia were cleared up, afterwards they were to be reduced to a peace footing status, except for the fluvial and naval forces needed to protect the commercial navigation and the reestablishment of navigable lanes. The military and naval personnel who in peace time was employed in the ports and in navigation was to be demobilized first, so that they could resume their former activity.
* Cession of Romanian territory
** Romania returned Southern Dobruja (the Cadrilater) and ceded the southern part of Northern Dobruja (see the maps) to Bulgaria. The rest of the province (starting south of Cernavodă-Constanța railroad up to the Danube and the Sfântu Gheorghe branch, thus leaving the Danube Delta to Romania) was ceded by Romania to the Central Powers and thus remained under joint Central Powers&#x27; control. The Central Powers guaranteed the commercial road to the Black Sea for Romania by way of Cernavodă and Constanța.
** Romania gave to Austria-Hungary control of the passes of the Carpathian Mountains (see the maps).
** State properties in the territories ceded by Romania passed without indemnity to the acquiring states. The acquiring states were to enter with Romania into agreements over the rights of option and emigration for the Romanian inhabitants in the ceded territories, the apportionment of the properties of the communal districts severed by the new frontiers, the attribution of archives, of judicial, administrative and personal civil records, the management of the new frontiers, the effect of the new frontiers upon the dioceses and the political treaties.
* All parties renounce war indemnities, except for special agreements regarding the regulation of war damages.
* Romania leased its oil wells to Germany for 90 years.
* The Central Powers recognized the Union of Bessarabia with Romania.
* The German and Austrian occupation of Romania was to continue until a date &quot;later to be determined&quot;.
* All of the occupation costs were to be paid for by Romania. 
* All of Romania&#x27;s &quot;surplus&quot; agriculture was to be handed over to Austria-Hungary and Germany with an Austro-German commission deciding what was Romania&#x27;s &quot;surplus&quot; production and what price to be paid for the &quot;surplus&quot; production.
* All of the railroads, telephones, telegram and post systems in Romania were to remain under the control of Germany and Austria-Hungary.
* German civil servants with the power to veto decisions by Romanian cabinet ministers and to fire Romanian civil servants were appointed to oversee every Romanian ministry, in effect stripping Romania of its independence.

==Aftermath==
The treaty put Romania in a unique situation compared to other German-occupied countries. It completely respected Romania&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; independence, and Romania ended up with more territory after the union with Bessarabia, through the requirement that German civil servants with the power of veto power be stationed in Bucharest together with the German occupation to continue until a date &quot;later be determined&quot;, effectively turned Romania into a &quot;de facto&quot; German protectorate.

Germany was able to repair the oil fields around Ploiești and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.

Although Bulgaria received a part of Northern Dobruja, the fact that it could not annex the whole province had a strong effect on the Bulgarian public opinion. Bulgarian Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov was forced to resign on 20 June 1918 after the failure to acquire the whole Dobruja. Nevertheless, Bulgaria continued to lobby Germany and Austria-Hungary for the annexation of the whole province, including the condominium established by the Treaty of Bucharest. Representatives of Bulgarian Dobrujans held a second general assembly in Babadag on 23 September, adopting a final resolution requesting Dobruja&#x27;s incorporation into Bulgaria. After negotiations, a regarding the transfer of the jointly administered zone in Northern Dobruja to Bulgaria was signed in Berlin on 24 September 1918, by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. In return, Bulgaria agreed to cede the left bank of the Maritsa river to Turkey. The protocol was deemed a desperate attempt by the Central Powers to keep Bulgaria on their side during the Vardar Offensive on the Macedonian front. In the end, the agreement was short-lived: five days later, on 29 September, Bulgaria capitulated in the face of the advancing Allied forces (see also the Armistice of Salonica).

The treaty was denounced in October 1918 by the Marghiloman government. Romania re-entered the war on 10 November 1918, the day before it ended in Western Europe, and the 1918 Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the Armistice of 11 November 1918. In 1919, Germany was forced in the Treaty of Versailles to renounce all the benefits provided by the 1918 Treaty of Bucharest. The territorial transfers to Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria were annulled by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919), and the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine (1919), respectively; and the Treaty of Trianon (1920) settled Romania&#x27;s border with Hungary.

<text>Broken Hill Correctional Centre, formerly Broken Hill Gaol, is an Australian minimum and medium security prison for men and women located in Broken Hill, New South Wales, around from Sydney. Opened in 1892, it is the fourth-oldest prison still in operation in NSW.

==History==
The original gaol was built in 1892, designed by the Colonial Architect, James Barnet, who also designed the Sydney Museum, among others. Its construction cost £15,000, and was carried out by Dobbee and Son. Broken Hill Gaol, as it was named, opened on 8 November 1892 as a 90-bed facility with five prison wardens and initially holding two female and 19 male prisoners.

On 11 June 1907, Peter Sadeek was hanged for the murder of a woman, and is the only prisoner executed at the prison.

During World War II, from 1942 to 1944 the prison, after being vacated, was taken over by the Commonwealth Government, to use as a safe place to store the nation&#x27;s reserves of gold, holding around £AU44.8 million of gold, owned by the Bank of England, Commonwealth Bank and the Bank of Java.

It remains the fourth-oldest operating prison in NSW.

==Governance and description==
The centre is operated by Corrective Services NSW, an agency of the Department of Communities and Justice of the Government of New South Wales. The centre detains sentenced and unsentenced inmates under New South Wales and/or Commonwealth legislation. The medium security section is a reception prison for a large area of the state, bordered by Queensland in the north, Victoria in the south, and South Australia in the west.

As of 2017, the prison employs more than 60 staff, some of whom work from a city office with prisoners on parole, and 90 prisoners. It is important to the Far West region, as it allows for imprisonment closer to families who live in the area.

==Programs==

Many of the prisoners are employed by Corrective Services Industries, in work such as catering, maintenance and community work, and they are also offered various vocational and education opportunities as a means of helping them to gain employment after their release.

Since 2021, yarning circles have been introduced for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s prisons across NSW, starting with Broken Hill – in the men&#x27;s prison in 2021, and the women&#x27;s prison in 2022. The aim of the circles is to encourage communication, connect Indigenous inmates with their culture, and reduce reoffending and the high rates of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

<text>Rufus Wilmot Griswold (February 13, 1815 – August 27, 1857) was an American anthologist, editor, poet, and critic. Born in Vermont, Griswold left home when he was 15 years old. He worked as a journalist, editor, and critic in Philadelphia, New York City, and elsewhere. He built a strong literary reputation, in part due to his 1842 collection &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot;. This anthology, the most comprehensive of its time, included what he deemed the best examples of American poetry. He produced revised versions and similar anthologies for the remainder of his life, although many of the poets he promoted have since faded into obscurity. Many writers hoped to have their work included in one of these editions, although they commented harshly on Griswold&#x27;s abrasive character. Griswold was married three times: his first wife died young, his second marriage ended in a public and controversial divorce, and his third wife left him after the previous divorce was almost repealed.

Edgar Allan Poe, whose poetry had been included in Griswold&#x27;s anthology, published a critical response that questioned which poets were included. This began a rivalry which grew when Griswold succeeded Poe as editor of &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot; at a salary higher than Poe&#x27;s. Later, the two competed for the attention of poet Frances Sargent Osgood. They never reconciled their differences, and after Poe&#x27;s mysterious death in 1849, Griswold wrote an unsympathetic obituary. Claiming to be Poe&#x27;s chosen literary executor, he began a campaign to harm Poe&#x27;s reputation that lasted until his own death eight years later.

Griswold considered himself an expert in American poetry and was an early proponent of its inclusion on the school curriculum. He also supported the introduction of copyright legislation, speaking to Congress on behalf of the publishing industry, but he was not above infringing the copyright of other people&#x27;s work. A fellow editor remarked &quot;even while haranguing the loudest, [he] is purloining the fastest&quot;.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Griswold was born to Rufus and Deborah (Wass) Griswold on February 13, 1815, in Vermont, near Rutland, and raised a strict Calvinist in the hamlet of Benson. He was the twelfth of fourteen children and his father was a farmer and shoemaker. In 1822, the family sold the Benson farm and moved to nearby Hubbardton. As a child, Griswold was complex, unpredictable, and reckless. He left home when he was 15, calling himself a &quot;solitary soul, wandering through the world, a homeless, joyless outcast&quot;.

Griswold moved to Albany, New York, and lived with a 22-year-old flute-playing journalist named George C. Foster, a writer best known for his work &quot;New-York by Gas-Light&quot;. Griswold lived with Foster until he was 17, and the two may have had a romantic relationship. When Griswold moved away, Foster wrote to him begging him to return, signing his letter &quot;come to me if you love me&quot;. Griswold attempted to enroll at the Rensselaer School in 1830, but was not allowed to take any classes after he was caught attempting to play a prank on a professor.

===Early career and first marriage===
After a brief spell as a printer&#x27;s apprentice, Griswold moved to Syracuse, New York, where he started a newspaper with friends titled &quot;The Porcupine&quot;. This publication purposefully targeted locals for what was later remembered as merely malicious critique.

He moved to New York City in 1836. and in March of this year, was introduced to 19-year-old Caroline Searles, whom he later married. He was employed as an editor for various publications in the New York area. In October, he considered running for office as a Whig but did not receive the party&#x27;s support. In 1837, he was licensed as a Baptist clergyman, but he never had a permanent congregation.

Griswold married Caroline on August 12, 1837, and the couple had two daughters. Following the birth of their second daughter, Griswold left his family behind in New York and moved to Philadelphia. His departure on November 27, 1840 was by all accounts abrupt, leaving his job with Horace Greeley&#x27;s &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, and his library of several thousand volumes. He joined the staff of Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Daily Standard&quot; and began to build his reputation as a literary critic, becoming known for his savagery and vindictiveness.

On November 6, 1842, Griswold visited his wife in New York after she had given birth to their third child, a son. Three days later, after returning to Philadelphia, he was informed that both she and the infant had died. Deeply shocked, Griswold traveled by train alongside her coffin, refusing to leave her side for 30 hours. When fellow passengers urged him to try to sleep, he answered by kissing her dead lips and embracing her, his two children crying next to him. He refused to leave the cemetery after her funeral, even after the other mourners had left, until forced to do so by a relative. He wrote a long poem in blank verse dedicated to Caroline, titled &quot;Five Days&quot;, which was printed in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; on November 16, 1842. Griswold had difficulty believing she had died and often dreamed of their reunion. Forty days after her entombment, he entered her vault, cut off a lock of her hair, kissed her on the forehead and lips, and wept for several hours, staying by her side until a friend found him 30 hours later.

===Anthologist and critic===

In 1842, Griswold released his 476-page anthology of American poetry, &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot;, which he dedicated to Washington Allston. Griswold&#x27;s collection featured poems from over 80 authors, including 17 by Lydia Sigourney, three by Edgar Allan Poe, and 45 by Charles Fenno Hoffman. Hoffman, a close friend, was allotted twice as much space as any other author. Griswold oversaw many anthologies, including &quot;Biographical Annual&quot;, which collected memoirs of &quot;eminent persons recently deceased&quot;, &quot;Gems from American Female Poets&quot;, &quot;Prose Writers of America&quot;, and &quot;Female Poets of America&quot;.

Between 1842 and 1845, while Griswold was collecting material for &quot;Prose Writers of America&quot;, he discovered the identity of Horace Binney Wallace, who had been writing in various literary magazines at the time (including &quot;Burton&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;) under the pen name William Landor. Wallace declined to be included in the anthology but the two became friends, exchanging many letters over the years. Wallace eventually ghostwrote Griswold&#x27;s &quot;Napoleon and the Marshals of the Empire&quot; (1847).

&quot;Prose Writers of America&quot;, published in 1847, was prepared specifically to compete with a similar anthology by Cornelius Mathews and Evert Augustus Duyckinck. The prose collection earned Griswold a rivalry with the two men, which Griswold expected. As it was being published, Griswold wrote to Boston publisher James T. Fields that &quot;Young America will be rabid&quot;. In preparing his anthologies, Griswold wrote to the living authors whose work he was including to ask their suggestions on which poems to include as well as to gather information for a biographical sketch.

In 1843, Griswold founded &quot;The Opal&quot;, an annual gift book that collected essays, stories, and poetry. Nathaniel Parker Willis edited its first edition, released in the fall of 1844. For a time, Griswold was editor of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and published a collection of poetry, titled &quot;The Cypress Wreath&quot; (1844). His poems, with titles such as &quot;The Happy Hour of Death&quot;, &quot;On the Death of a Young Girl&quot;, and &quot;The Slumber of Death&quot;, emphasized mortality and mourning. Another collection of his poetry, &quot;Christian Ballads and Other Poems&quot;, was published in 1844, and his nonfiction book, &quot;The Republican Court or, American Society in the Days of Washington&quot;, was published in 1854. The book is meant to cover events during the presidency of George Washington, though it mixes historical fact with apocryphal legend until one is indistinguishable from the other. During this period, Griswold occasionally offered his services at the pulpit delivering sermons and he may have received an honorary doctorate from Shurtleff College, a Baptist institution in Illinois, leading to his nickname the &quot;Reverend Dr. Griswold&quot;.

===Second marriage===
On August 20, 1845, Griswold married Charlotte Myers, a Jewish woman; she was 42 and he was 33. Griswold had been pressured into the marriage by the woman&#x27;s aunts despite his concern about their difference in religious beliefs. This difference was strong enough that one of Griswold&#x27;s friends referred to his wife only as &quot;the little Jewess&quot;. On their wedding night, he discovered that she was, according to Griswold biographer Joy Bayless, &quot;through some physical misfortune, incapable of being a wife&quot; or, as Poe biographer Kenneth Silverman explains, incapable of having sex. Griswold considered the marriage void and no more valid &quot;than there would have been had the ceremony taken place between parties of the same sex, or where the sex of one was doubtful or ambiguous&quot;. Still, the couple moved together to Charleston, South Carolina, Charlotte&#x27;s home town, and lived under the same roof, albeit sleeping in separate rooms. Neither of the two was happy with the situation, and at the end of April 1846, she had a lawyer write a contract &quot;to separate, altogether and forever, ... which would in effect be a divorce&quot;. The contract forbade Griswold from remarrying and paid him $1,000 (~$ in ) for expenses in exchange for his daughter Caroline staying with the Myers family. After this separation, Griswold immediately moved back to Philadelphia.

===Move to New York City===
A few years later, Griswold moved back to New York City, leaving his younger daughter in the care of the Myers family and his elder daughter, Emily, with relatives on her mother&#x27;s side. He had by now earned the nickname &quot;Grand Turk&quot;, and in the summer of 1847, made plans to edit an anthology of poetry by American women. He believed that women were incapable of the same kind of &quot;intellectual&quot; poetry as men and believed they needed to be divided: &quot;The conditions of aesthetic ability in the two sexes are probably distinct, or even opposite&quot;, he wrote in his introduction. The selections he chose for &quot;The Female Poets of America&quot; were not necessarily the greatest examples of poetry but instead were chosen because they emphasized traditional morality and values. The same year, Griswold began working on what he considered &quot;the maximum opus of his life&quot;, an extensive biographical dictionary. Although he worked on it for several years and even advertised for it, he never produced it. He also helped Elizabeth F. Ellet publish her book &quot;Women of the American Revolution&quot;, and was angered when she did not acknowledge his assistance in the book. In July 1848, he visited poet Sarah Helen Whitman in Providence, Rhode Island, but he had been suffering with vertigo and exhaustion, rarely leaving his apartment at New York University, and was unable to write without taking opium. In autumn of that year, he had an epileptic seizure, the first of many he would have for the remainder of his life. One seizure caused him to fall out of a ferry in Brooklyn and nearly drown. He wrote to publisher James T. Fields: &quot;I am in a terrible condition, physically and mentally. I do not know what the end will be ... I am exhausted—betwixt life and death—and heaven and hell.&quot; In 1849, he was further troubled when Charles Fenno Hoffman, with whom he had become good friends, was committed to an insane asylum.

Griswold continued editing and contributing literary criticism for various publications, both full-time and freelance, including 22 months from July 1, 1850, to April 1, 1852, with &quot;The International Magazine&quot;. There, he worked with contributors including Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Mary E. Hewitt and John R. Thompson. In the November 10, 1855, issue of &quot;The Criterion&quot;, Griswold anonymously reviewed the first edition of Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, declaring: &quot;It is impossible to image how any man&#x27;s fancy could have conceived such a mass of stupid filth&quot;. Griswold charged that Whitman was guilty of &quot;the vilest imaginings and shamefullest license&quot;, a &quot;degrading, beastly sensuality.&quot; Referring to Whitman&#x27;s poetry, Griswold said he left &quot;this gathering of muck to the laws which ... must have the power to suppress such gross obscenity.&quot; Whitman later included Griswold&#x27;s review in a new edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. He ended his review with a phrase in Latin referring to &quot;that horrible sin, among Christians not to be named&quot;, the stock phrase long associated with Christian condemnations of sodomy, referring in this instance to homosexual, rather than heterosexual sodomy. Griswold was the first person in the 19th century to publicly point to and stress the theme of erotic desire and acts between men in Whitman&#x27;s poetry. More attention to that aspect of Whitman&#x27;s poetry surfaced late in the 19th century.

===Divorce and third marriage===
After a brief flirtation with poet Alice Cary, Griswold pursued a relationship with Harriet McCrillis. He originally did not want to divorce Charlotte Myers because he &quot;dreaded the publicity&quot; and because of her love for his daughter. He applied for divorce at the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia on March 25, 1852. Elizabeth Ellet and Ann S. Stephens wrote to Myers urging her not to grant the divorce, and to McCrillis not to marry him. To convince Myers to agree to the divorce, Griswold allowed her to keep his daughter Caroline if she signed a statement that she had deserted him. She agreed, and the divorce was made official December 18; he likely never saw Myers or his daughter again. McCrillis and Griswold were married shortly thereafter on December 26, 1852, and settled at 196 West Twenty-third Street in New York. Their son, William, was born on October 9, 1853.

Ellet and Stephens continued writing to Griswold&#x27;s ex-wife, urging her to have the divorce repealed. Myers was convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of the divorce and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold&#x27;s troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. The same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived, he saw 49 corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold&#x27;s character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended, and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in Bangor, Maine.

===Death===
Griswold died of tuberculosis in New York City on August 27, 1857. Estelle Anna Lewis, a friend and writer, suggested that the interference of Elizabeth Ellet had exacerbated Griswold&#x27;s condition and that she &quot;goaded Griswold to his death&quot;. At the time of his death, the sole decorations found in his room were portraits of himself, Frances Osgood, and Poe. A friend, Charles Godfrey Leland, found in Griswold&#x27;s desk several documents attacking a number of authors which Griswold was preparing for publication. Leland decided to burn them.

Griswold&#x27;s funeral was held on August 30. His pallbearers included Leland, Charles Frederick Briggs, George Henry Moore, and Richard Henry Stoddard. His remains were left for eight years in the receiving tomb of Green-Wood Cemetery before being buried on July 12, 1865, without a headstone. Although his library of several thousand volumes was auctioned, raising over $3,000 (~$ in ) to be put toward a monument, none was commissioned.

==Reputation and influence==

Griswold&#x27;s anthology &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot; was the most comprehensive of its kind to date. As critic Lewis Gaylord Clark said, it was expected Griswold&#x27;s book would &quot;become incorporated into the permanent undying literature of our age and nation&quot;. The anthology helped Griswold build up a considerable reputation throughout the 1840s and 1850s and its first edition went through three printings in only six months. His choice of authors, however, was occasionally questioned. A British editor reviewed the collection and concluded, &quot;with two or three exceptions, there is not a poet of mark in the whole Union&quot; and referred to the anthology as &quot;the most conspicuous act of martyrdom yet committed in the service of the transatlantic muses&quot;. Even so, the book was popular and was continued in several editions after Griswold&#x27;s death by Richard Henry Stoddard.

In later times, &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot; has been nicknamed a &quot;graveyard of poets&quot; because its anthologized writers have since passed into obscurity to become, as literary historian Fred Lewis Pattee wrote, &quot;dead ... beyond all resurrection&quot;. Pattee also called the book a &quot;collection of poetic trash&quot; and &quot;voluminous worthlessness&quot;.

Within the contemporary American literary scene Griswold became known as erratic, dogmatic, pretentious, and vindictive. Historian Perry Miller wrote &quot;Griswold was about as devious as they came in this era of deviousness; did not ample documentation prove that he actually existed, we might suppose him ... one of the less plausible inventions of Charles Dickens&quot;. Later anthologies such as &quot;Prose Writers of America&quot; and &quot;Female Poets of America&quot; helped him become known as a literary dictator, whose approval writers sought even while they feared his growing power. Even as they tried to impress him, however, several authors voiced their opinion on Griswold&#x27;s character. Ann S. Stephens called him two-faced and &quot;constitutionally incapable of speaking the truth&quot;. Even his friends knew him as a consummate liar and had a saying: &quot;Is that a Griswold or a fact?&quot; Another friend once called him &quot;one of the most irritable and vindictive men I ever met&quot;. Author Cornelius Mathews wrote in 1847 that Griswold fished for writers to exploit, warning &quot;the poor little innocent fishes&quot; to avoid his &quot;Griswold Hook&quot;. A review of one of Griswold&#x27;s anthologies, published anonymously in the Philadelphia &quot;Saturday Museum&quot; on January 28, 1843, but believed to have been written by Poe, asked: &quot;What will be [Griswold&#x27;s] fate? Forgotten, save only by those whom he has injured and insulted, he will sink into oblivion, without leaving a landmark to tell that he once existed; or if he is spoken of hereafter, he will be quoted as the unfaithful servant who abused his trust.&quot;

James Russell Lowell, who had privately called Griswold &quot;an ass and, what&#x27;s more, a knave&quot;, composed a verse on Griswold&#x27;s temperament in his satirical &quot;A Fable for Critics&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
:&quot;But stay, here comes Tityrus Griswold, and leads on&quot;
:&quot;The flocks whom he first plucks alive, and then feeds on—&quot;
:&quot;A loud-cackling swarm, in whose feathers warm dressed,&quot;
:&quot;He goes for as perfect a – swan as the rest.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Griswold was one of the early proponents of teaching schoolchildren American poetry in addition to English poetry. One of his anthologies, &quot;Readings in American Poetry for the Use of Schools&quot;, was created specifically for that purpose. His knowledge in American poetry was emphasized by his claim that he had read every American poem published before 1850—an estimated 500 volumes. &quot;He has more literary patriotism, if the phrase be allowable ... than any person we ever knew&quot;, wrote a contributor to &quot;Graham&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;Since the Pilgrims landed, no man or woman has written anything on any subject which has escaped his untiring research.&quot; Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. noted that Griswold researched literature like &quot;a kind of naturalist whose subjects are authors, whose memory is a perfect fauna of all flying and creeping things that feed on ink.&quot;

Evert Augustus Duyckinck commented that &quot;the thought [of a national literature] seems to have entered and taken possession of (Griswold&#x27;s) mind with the force of monomania&quot;. Poet Philip Pendleton Cooke questioned Griswold&#x27;s sincerity, saying he &quot;should have loved [it] ... better than to say it&quot;. By the 1850s, Griswold&#x27;s literary nationalism had subsided somewhat, and he began following the more popular contemporary trend of reading literature from England, France, and Germany. He disassociated himself from the &quot;absurd notion ... that we are to create an entirely new literature&quot;.

Publicly, Griswold supported the establishment of international copyright, but he often duplicated entire works during his time as an editor, particularly with &quot;The Brother Jonathan.&quot; A contemporary editor said of him: &quot;He takes advantage of a state of things which he declares to be &#x27;immoral, unjust and wicked,&#x27; and even while haranguing the loudest, is purloining the fastest.&quot; Even so, he was chosen to represent the publishing industry before Congress in the spring of 1844 to discuss the need for copyright law.

==Relationship with Poe==

Griswold first met Edgar Allan Poe in Philadelphia in May 1841 while working for the &quot;Daily Standard&quot;. At the outset, their relationship was cordial, at least superficially. In a letter dated March 29, 1841, Poe sent Griswold several poems for &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot; anthology, writing that he would be proud to see &quot;one or two of them in the book&quot;. Griswold included three of these poems: &quot;Coliseum&quot;, &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot;, and &quot;The Sleeper&quot;. In November of this year, Poe, who previously praised Griswold in his &quot;Autography&quot; series as &quot;a gentleman of fine taste and sound judgment&quot;, wrote a critical review of the anthology, on Griswold&#x27;s behalf. Griswold paid Poe for the review and used his influence to have it published in a Boston periodical. The review was generally favorable, but Poe questioned the inclusion of certain authors and the omission of others. Poe also said that Griswold &quot;unduly favored&quot; New England writers. Griswold had expected more praise, and Poe privately told others he was not particularly impressed by the book, even calling it &quot;a most outrageous humbug&quot; in a letter to a friend. In another letter, this time to fellow writer Frederick W. Thomas, Poe suggested that Griswold&#x27;s promise to help get the review published was a bribe for a favorable review, knowing Poe needed the money.

Making the relationship more strained, only months later, Griswold was hired by George Rex Graham to take up Poe&#x27;s former position as editor of &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Griswold, however, was paid more and given more editorial control of the magazine than Poe. Shortly after, Poe began presenting a series of lectures called &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot;, the first of which was given in Philadelphia on November 25, 1843. Poe openly attacked Griswold in front of his large audience and continued to do so in similar lectures. Graham said that during these lectures, Poe &quot;gave Mr. Griswold some raps over the knuckles of force sufficient to be remembered&quot;. In a letter dated January 16, 1845, Poe tried to reconcile with Griswold, promising him that his lecture now omitted all that Griswold found objectionable.

Another source of animosity between the two men was their competition for the attention of the poet Frances Sargent Osgood in the mid to late 1840s. While both she and Poe were still married to their respective spouses, the two carried on a public flirtation that resulted in much gossip among the literati. Griswold, who was smitten with Osgood, escorted her to literary salons and became her staunchest defender. &quot;She is in all things the most admirable woman I ever knew&quot;, he wrote to publisher James T. Fields in 1848. Osgood responded by dedicating a collection of her poetry to Griswold &quot;as a souvenir of admiration for his genius, of regard for his generous character, and of gratitude for his valuable literary counsels&quot;.

===&quot;Ludwig&quot; obituary===

After Poe&#x27;s death, Griswold prepared an obituary signed with the pseudonym Ludwig. First printed in the October 9, 1849, issue of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, it was soon republished many times. Here he asserted that &quot;few will be grieved&quot; by Poe&#x27;s death as he had few friends. He claimed that Poe often wandered the streets, either in &quot;madness or melancholy&quot;, mumbling and cursing to himself, was easily irritated, was envious of others, and that he &quot;regarded society as composed of villains&quot;. Poe&#x27;s drive to succeed, Griswold wrote, was because he sought &quot;the right to despise a world which galled his self-conceit&quot;. Much of this characterization of Poe was copied almost verbatim from that of the fictitious Francis Vivian in &quot;The Caxtons&quot; by Edward Bulwer-Lytton.

Griswold biographer Joy Bayless wrote that Griswold used a pseudonym not to conceal his relationship to the obituary but because it was his custom never to sign his newspaper and his magazine contributions. Regardless, Griswold&#x27;s true identity was soon revealed. In a letter to Sarah Helen Whitman dated December 17, 1849, he admitted his role in writing Poe&#x27;s death notice. &quot;I was not his friend, nor was he mine&quot;, he wrote.

===Memoir===
Griswold claimed that &quot;among the last requests of Mr. Poe&quot; was that he become his literary executor &quot;for the benefit of his family&quot;. Griswold claimed that Poe&#x27;s aunt and mother-in-law Maria Clemm said Poe had made such a statement on June 9, 1849, and that she herself released any claim to Poe&#x27;s works. And indeed a document exists in which Clemm transfers power of attorney to Griswold, dated October 20, 1849, although there are no signed witnesses. Clemm, however, had no right to make such a decision; Poe&#x27;s younger sister Rosalie was his closest next of kin. Although Griswold had acted as a literary agent for other American writers, it is unclear if Poe really appointed Griswold his executor (perhaps as part of his &quot;Imp of the Perverse&quot;), if it were a trick on Griswold&#x27;s part, or a mistake on Maria Clemm&#x27;s. It is also possible that Osgood persuaded Poe to name Griswold as his executor.

In any case, Griswold, along with James Russell Lowell and Nathaniel Parker Willis, edited a posthumous collection of Poe&#x27;s works published in three volumes starting in January 1850. He did not share the profits of his edition with Poe&#x27;s surviving relatives. This edition included a biographical sketch titled &quot;Memoir of the Author&quot; which has become notorious for its inaccuracy. The &quot;Memoir&quot; depicts Poe as a madman, addicted to drugs and chronically drunk. Many elements were fabricated by Griswold using forged letters as evidence and it was denounced by those who knew Poe, including Sarah Helen Whitman, Charles Frederick Briggs, and George Rex Graham. In March, Graham published a notice in his magazine accusing Griswold of betraying trust and taking revenge on the dead. &quot;Mr. Griswold&quot;, he wrote, &quot;has allowed old prejudices and old enmities to steal ... into the coloring of his picture.&quot; Thomas Holley Chivers wrote a book called &quot;New Life of Edgar Allan Poe&quot; which directly responded to Griswold&#x27;s accusations. He said that Griswold &quot;is not only incompetent to Edit any of [Poe&#x27;s] works, but totally unconscious of the duties which he and every man who sets himself up as a Literary Executor, owe the dead&quot;.

Today Griswold&#x27;s name is usually associated with Poe&#x27;s as a character assassin, but not all believe that Griswold deliberately intended to cause harm. Some of the information that Griswold asserted or implied was that Poe was expelled from the University of Virginia and that Poe had tried to seduce his guardian John Allan&#x27;s second wife. Even so, Griswold&#x27;s attempts only drew attention to Poe&#x27;s work; readers were thrilled at the idea of reading the works of an &quot;evil&quot; man. Griswold&#x27;s characterization of Poe and the false information he originated appeared consistently in Poe biographies for the next two decades.

<text>Market portfolio is an investment portfolio  that theoretically consisting of a weighted sum of every asset in the market, with weights in the proportions that they exist in the market, with the necessary assumption that these assets are infinitely divisible. 

The concept is related to asset allocation and has been critiqued by some economists. In practice index providers and exchange-traded funds (ETF) providers create proxies of a market portfolio using securities that are available on securities exchanges in proportion of their weighting.

== Critiques ==
Richard Roll&#x27;s critique states that this is only a theoretical concept, as to create a market portfolio for investment purposes in practice would necessarily include every single possible available asset, including real estate, precious metals, stamp collections, jewelry, and anything with any worth, as the theoretical market being referred to would be the world market.

There is some question of whether what is used for the market portfolio really matters. Some authors say that it does not make a big difference; you can use any representative index and get similar results. Roll gave an example where different indexes produce much different results, and that by choosing the index you can get any ranking you want. Brown and Brown (1987) examine this, using different indexes such as stocks only, stocks and bonds, and stocks plus bonds plus real estate. They find that using a market that includes real estate produces much different results. For example, with one measurement most mutual funds have alpha close to zero, while with another measurement most of them have significantly negative alpha.

Most index providers give indices for different components such as stocks only, bonds only, et cetera. As a result, proxies for the market (such as the FTSE 100 in the UK, DAX in Germany or the S&amp;P 500 in the US) are used in practice by investors. Roll&#x27;s critique states that these proxies cannot provide an accurate representation of the entire market.

The concept of a market portfolio plays an important role in many financial theories and models, including the capital asset pricing model where it is the only fund in which investors need to invest, to be supplemented only by a risk-free asset, depending upon each investor&#x27;s attitude towards risk.

Sharpe (2010) notes that many investors are at least targeted to a fixed ratio (e.g. 60% stocks, 40% bonds). He points out that this is sort of contrarian. The holdings of all investors combined must, by equation, be in the cap-weighted proportions. So many investors following this strategy implies some other investors must follow a buy-high, sell-low (trend following) strategy. He then says that he doesn&#x27;t like it and people should use adjustments to the market proportions instead.

The portfolio of the average investor contains important information for strategic asset allocation purposes. This portfolio shows the relative value of all assets according to the market crowd, which one could interpret as a benchmark for the average investor. Several authors have collected data to determine the composition of the global market portfolio since 1960.

The returns on the market portfolio realizes a compounded real return of 4.43% with a standard deviation of 11.2% from 1960 until 2017. In the inflationary period from 1960 to 1979, the compounded real return of the GMP is 3.24%, while this is 6.01% in the disinflationary period from 1980 to 2017. The reward for the average investor is a compounded return of 3.39%-points above the risk-free rate.

<text>The Bassoon Concerto in B-flat major, K. 191/186e, is a bassoon concerto written in 1774 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is the most often performed and studied piece in the entire bassoon repertory. Nearly all professional bassoonists will perform the piece at some stage in their career, and it is probably the most commonly requested piece in orchestral auditions – it is usually requested that the player perform excerpts from the concerto&#x27;s first two movements in every audition.

Although the autograph score is lost, the exact date of its completion is known: 4 June 1774.

Mozart wrote the bassoon concerto when he was 18 years old, and it was his first concerto for a wind instrument. Although it is believed that it was commissioned by an aristocratic amateur bassoon player Thaddäus Freiherr von Dürnitz, who owned seventy-four works by Mozart, this is a claim that is supported by little evidence. Scholars believe that Mozart may have written five bassoon concertos, but that only the first has survived.

== Instrumentation ==
The concerto is scored for a solo bassoon and an orchestra consisting of 2 oboes, 2 horns in Bb (sometimes transcribed for F), violin I/II, viola, and cello and double bass doubling the bass line.

== Structure ==
The piece is divided into three movements:

# Allegro
# Andante ma Adagio (F major)
# Rondo: tempo di menuetto

The first movement is written in the common sonata form with an orchestral introduction. The second movement is a slow and lyrical sonata without development that contains a theme which was later featured in the Countess&#x27;s aria &quot;Porgi, Amor&quot; at the beginning of the second act of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;. The final movement is in rondo form.

<doc id="1215077" wikidata="Q4969832" url="?curid=1215077" title="British Commonwealth Forces Korea">
<text>British Commonwealth Forces Korea (BCFK) was the formal name of the British Commonwealth army, naval and air units serving with the United Nations (UN) in the Korean War. BCFK included Australian, British, Canadian, Indian, and New Zealand units. Some Commonwealth units and personnel served with United States and/or other UN formations, which were not part of BCFK.

==History==
In 1950, Australian units based with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan were among the first UN personnel to be deployed in South Korea. After the administrative support role of BCOF in Japan to the fighting forces in Korea had been decided in November 1950, the title BCFK appeared. The position of BCFK Commander-in-Chief was always held by Australian Army officers, the first being Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson. Liaison between the Commonwealth C-in-C and the UN high command was provided by a subordinate headquarters in Tokyo.

Seven months after BCFK came into being, the Commonwealth armies formed the 1st Commonwealth Division (in July 1951) and British and Canadian Army personnel predominated at the operational level in the Commonwealth land forces. Lieutenant General William Bridgeford took over from Robertson in October 1951, and he was later succeeded by Lieutenant General Henry Wells. Wells was succeeded by Lieutenant General Rudolph Bierwirth in 1954 and Brigadier Leonard Bruton in 1956.

The Royal Navy usually had at least one aircraft carrier on station during the war. Five British carriers: &quot;Glory&quot;, &quot;Ocean&quot;, &quot;Theseus&quot;, &quot;Triumph&quot;, and (a maintenance and aircraft transport carrier) served in the conflict. The Royal Australian Navy provided the carrier HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot;. The RN, RAN and Royal Canadian Navy also provided many other warships. The Royal New Zealand Navy deployed a number of Loch class frigates throughout the war.

The RN carriers provided the only British fighter planes to take part in the war. On 9 August 1952 a propeller-driven Sea Fury, piloted by Lieutenant Peter Carmichael of No. 802 Squadron, based on HMS &quot;Ocean&quot;, shot down a MiG-15 jet fighter, becoming one of only a handful of pilots of propeller planes to have shot down a jet.

The only front-line unit from a Commonwealth air force to serve under BCFK was Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) No. 77 Squadron, which initially flew P-51 Mustang fighters and later converted to Gloster Meteor jets. British and Canadian aircrews also served with the RAAF. The only Royal Air Force contribution was a wing of Short Sunderland flying boats based at Iwakuni in Japan.

<text>Casuarina Prison is the main maximum-security prison for Western Australia, located in the Perth, Western Australia suburb of Casuarina. The prison accommodates minimum-, medium- and maximum-security prisoners. It was opened in 1991 to replace Fremantle Prison, which was 130 years old. The prison was the scene of a riot on Christmas Day 1998. The prison featured in the documentary &quot;Australia&#x27;s Hardest Prison: Lockdown Oz&quot; on the National Geographic channel in 2008, following the lives of prisoners and officers.

In 2013 the prison was the setting for the film &quot;Son of a Gun&quot;.

The prison has been subject of multiple legal actions due to alleged &quot;inhumane conditions&quot;. In 2022, seventeen teenagers were relocated to the maximum security prison prompting a class action. The Department of Justice has defended its actions, while victim advocates have raised concerns around the law firm representing the youth. 

The Australian Human Rights Commission has raised concerns about the issue of teenagers being held at the prison, prompting calls for further action.

<text>Ilie Verdeț (10 May 1925 – 20 March 2001) was a Romanian communist politician who served as Romania’s Prime Minister from 1979 to 1982.

==Biography==
Born in Comănești, Bacău County, and a miner from age 12, he joined the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in 1945. After graduating from the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, he climbed through the party apparatus. By the early 1960s, he was working in the central office of the PCR in Bucharest, as deputy of Nicolae Ceauşescu, who was in charge of party organization and appointments. After the death of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej in March 1965, Verdeț helped Ceaușescu gain the position of Secretary General of the PCR.

Soon afterwards, Verdeț was promoted to the Permanent Bureau of the Political Executive Committee of the PCR. He held many political positions, including those of Deputy Prime Minister (1966–1974) and Prime Minister of Romania (1979–1982). He was sent by Ceaușescu to solve the Jiu Valley miners&#x27; strike of 1977, but was unable to negotiate and was held hostage for two days (which he had later denied).

After the fall of Ceaușescu in December 1989, Verdeţ declared himself the head of a provisional government, but it only lasted for about 20 minutes, after which he was pushed aside by Ion Iliescu, who emerged as the leader of the National Salvation Front (FSN). 

Subsequently, in 1990, Verdeț founded a political party called Socialist Party of Labour (), which narrowly entered Parliament in the 1992 elections, but in the next elections failed to win any seats. He remained the leader of PSM until the 2000 elections, after which he was removed from this position.

He died of a heart attack in 2001 in Bucharest at the age of 75.

==Private life==
Verdeț and his wife Reghina married in 1947. They had two daughters: Doina (b. 1948) and Cezarina (b. 1953).

<doc id="1215089" wikidata="Q971493" url="?curid=1215089" title="Nathaniel Parker Willis">
<text>Nathaniel Parker Willis (January 20, 1806 – January 20, 1867), also known as N. P. Willis, was an American writer, poet and editor who worked with several notable American writers including Edgar Allan Poe and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He became the highest-paid magazine writer of his day. His brother was the composer Richard Storrs Willis and his sister Sara wrote under the name Fanny Fern. Harriet Jacobs wrote her autobiography while being employed as his children&#x27;s nurse.

Born in Portland, Maine, Willis came from a family of publishers. His grandfather Nathaniel Willis owned newspapers in Massachusetts and Virginia, and his father Nathaniel Willis was the founder of &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;, the first newspaper specifically for children. Willis developed an interest in literature while attending Yale College and began publishing poetry. After graduation, he worked as an overseas correspondent for the &quot;New York Mirror&quot;. He eventually moved to New York and began to build his literary reputation. Working with multiple publications, he was earning about $100 per article and between $5,000 and $10,000 per year. In 1846, he started his own publication, the &quot;Home Journal&quot;, which was eventually renamed &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;. Shortly after, Willis moved to a home on the Hudson River where he lived a semi-retired life until his death in 1867.

Willis embedded his own personality into his writing and addressed his readers personally, specifically in his travel writings, so that his reputation was built in part because of his character. Critics, including his sister in her novel &quot;Ruth Hall&quot;, occasionally described him as being effeminate and Europeanized. Willis also published several poems, tales, and a play. Despite his intense popularity for a time, at his death Willis was nearly forgotten.

==Life and career==
===Early life and family===
Nathaniel Parker Willis was born on January 20, 1806, in Portland, Maine. His father Nathaniel Willis was a newspaper proprietor there and his grandfather owned newspapers in Boston, Massachusetts and western Virginia. His mother was Hannah Willis (&quot;née&quot; Parker) from Holliston, Massachusetts and it was her husband&#x27;s offer to edit the &quot;Eastern Argus&quot; in Maine that caused their move to Portland. Willis&#x27;s younger sister was Sara Willis Parton, who would later become a writer under the pseudonym Fanny Fern. His brother, Richard Storrs Willis, became a musician and music journalist known for writing the melody for &quot;It Came Upon the Midnight Clear&quot;. His other siblings were Lucy Douglas (born 1804), Louisa Harris (1807), Julia Dean (1809), Mary Perry (1813), Edward Payson (1816), and Ellen Holmes (1821).

In 1816, the family moved to Boston, where Willis&#x27;s father established the &quot;Boston Recorder&quot; and, nine years later, the &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;, the world&#x27;s first newspaper for children. The elder Willis&#x27;s emphasis on religious themes earned him the nickname &quot;Deacon&quot; Willis. After attending a Boston grammar school and Phillips Academy at Andover, Nathaniel Parker Willis entered Yale College in October 1823 where he roomed with Horace Bushnell. Willis credited Bushnell with teaching him the proper technique for sharpening a razor by &quot;drawing it from heel to point both ways ... the two cross frictions correct each other&quot;. At Yale, he further developed an interest in literature, often neglecting his other studies. He graduated in 1827 and spent time touring parts of the United States and Canada. In Montreal, he met Chester Harding, with whom he would become a lifelong friend. Years later, Harding referred to Willis during this period as &quot;the &#x27;lion&#x27; of the town&quot;. Willis began publishing poetry in his father&#x27;s &quot;Boston Periodical&quot;, often using one of two literary personalities under the pen names &quot;Roy&quot; (for religious subjects) and &quot;Cassius&quot; (for more secular topics). The same year, Willis published a volume of poetical &quot;Sketches&quot;.

===Literary career===
In the latter part of the 1820s, Willis began contributing more frequently to magazines and periodicals. In 1829, he served as editor for &quot;The Token&quot;, making him the only person to be editor in the gift book&#x27;s 15-year history besides its founder, Samuel Griswold Goodrich. He used the position to solicit a short story from fellow Portland native, John Neal, who continued contributing tales and essays well into the 1830s. Also in 1829, Willis founded the &quot;American Monthly Magazine&quot;, which began publishing in April of that year until it was discontinued in August 1831. He blamed its failure on the &quot;tight purses of Boston culture&quot; and moved to Europe to serve as foreign editor and correspondent of the &quot;New York Mirror&quot;. In 1832, while in Florence, Italy, he met Horatio Greenough, who sculpted a bust of the writer. Between 1832 and 1836, Willis contributed a series of letters for the &quot;Mirror&quot;, about half of which were later collected as &quot;Pencillings by the Way&quot;, printed in London in 1835. The romantic descriptions of scenes and modes of life in Europe sold well despite the then high price tag of $7 a copy. The work became popular and boosted Willis&#x27;s literary reputation enough that an American edition was soon issued.

Despite this popularity, he was censured by some critics for indiscretion in reporting private conversations. At one point he fought a bloodless duel with Captain Frederick Marryat, then editor of the &quot;Metropolitan Magazine&quot;, after Willis sent a private letter of Marryat&#x27;s to George Pope Morris, who had it printed. Still, in 1835 Willis was popular enough to introduce Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to important literary figures in England, including Ada Byron, daughter of Lord Byron.

While abroad, Willis wrote to a friend, &quot;I should like to marry in England&quot;. He soon married Mary Stace, daughter of General William Stace of Woolwich, on October 1, 1835, after a month-long engagement. The couple took a two-week honeymoon in Paris. The couple moved to London where, in 1836, Willis met Charles Dickens, who was working for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; at the time.

In 1837, Willis and his wife returned to the United States and settled at a small estate on Owego Creek in New York, just above its junction with the Susquehanna River. He named the home Glenmary and the rural setting inspired him to write &quot;Letters from under a Bridge&quot;. On October 20, 1838, Willis began a series of articles called &quot;A New Series of Letters from London&quot;, one of which suggested an illicit relationship between writer Letitia Elizabeth Landon and editor William Jordan. The article caused some scandal, for which Willis&#x27;s publisher had to apologize.

On June 20, 1839, Willis&#x27;s play &quot;Tortesa, the Usurer&quot; premiered in Philadelphia at the Walnut Street Theatre. Edgar Allan Poe called it &quot;by far the best play from the pen of an American author&quot;. That year, he was also editor of the short-lived periodical &quot;The Corsair&quot;, for which he enlisted William Makepeace Thackeray to write short sketches of France. Another major work, &quot;Two Ways of Dying for a Husband&quot;, was published in England during a short visit there in 1839–1840. Shortly after returning to the United States, his personal life was touched with grief when his first child was stillborn on December 4, 1840. He and Stace had a second daughter, Imogen, who was born June 20, 1842.

Later that year, Willis attended a ball in honor of Charles Dickens in New York. After dancing with Dickens&#x27;s wife, Willis and Dickens went out for &quot;rum toddy and broiled oysters&quot;. By this time, his fame had grown enough that he was often invited to lecture and recite poetry, including his presentation to the Linonian Society at Yale on August 17, 1841. Willis was invited to submit a column to the each weekly issue of &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot;, a publication from New York with 20,000 subscribers, which he did until September 1841. By 1842, Willis was earning the unusually high salary of $4,800 a year. As a later journalist remarked, this made Willis &quot;the first magazine writer who was tolerably well paid&quot;.

===&quot;Evening Mirror&quot;===

Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, along with George Pope Morris, the weekly &quot;New York Mirror&quot; as the daily &quot;Evening Mirror&quot; in 1844 with a weekly supplement called the &quot;Weekly Mirror&quot;, in part due to the rising cost of postage. By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a joke was that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was Germany&#x27;s version of N. P. Willis) and one of the first commercially successful magazine writers in America. In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book &quot;The Opal&quot; founded by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year, a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis&#x27;s salary.

As a critic, Willis did not believe in including discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The &quot;Mirror&quot; flourished at a time when many publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, &quot;The Prose and Poetry of America&quot;.

While Willis was editor of the &quot;Evening Mirror&quot;, its issue for January 29, 1845, included the first printing of Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot; with his name attached. In his introduction, Willis called it &quot;unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative lift ... It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it&quot;. Willis and Poe were close friends, and Willis helped Poe financially during his wife Virginia&#x27;s illness and while Poe was suing Thomas Dunn English for libel. Willis often tried to persuade Poe to be less destructive in his criticism and concentrate on his poetry. Even so, Willis published many pieces of what would later be referred to as &quot;The Longfellow War&quot;, a literary battle between Poe and the supporters of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whom Poe called overrated and guilty of plagiarism. Willis also introduced Poe to Fanny Osgood; the two would later carry out a very public literary flirtation.

Willis&#x27;s wife Mary Stace died in childbirth on March 25, 1845. Their daughter, Blanche, died as well and Willis wrote in his notebook that she was &quot;an angel without fault or foible&quot;. He took his surviving daughter Imogen to England to visit her mother&#x27;s family. In October 1846, he married Cornelia Grinnell, a wealthy Quaker from New Bedford and the adopted daughter of a local Congressman. She was two decades younger than Willis at the time and vocally disliked slavery, unlike her new husband.

===&quot;Home Journal&quot;===
In 1846, Willis and Morris left the &quot;Evening Mirror&quot; and attempted to edit a new weekly, the &quot;National Press&quot;, which was renamed the &quot;Home Journal&quot; after eight months. Their prospectus for the publication, published November 21, 1846, announced their intentions to create a magazine &quot;to circle around the family table&quot;. Willis intended the magazine for the middle and lower classes and included the message of upward social mobility, using himself as an example, often describing in detail his personal possessions. When discussing his own social climbing, however, he emphasized his frustrations rather than his successes, endearing him to his audience. He edited the &quot;Home Journal&quot; until his death in 1867. It was renamed &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; in 1901, and it is still published under that title as of 2020. During Willis&#x27;s time at the journal, he especially promoted the works of women poets, including Frances Sargent Osgood, Anne Lynch Botta, Grace Greenwood, and Julia Ward Howe. Willis and his editors favorably reviewed many works now considered important today, including Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot; and Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot;.

===Idlewild===

In 1846, Willis settled near the banks of Canterbury Creek near the Hudson River in New York and named his new home Idlewild. When Willis first visited the property, the owners said it had little value and that it was &quot;an idle wild of which nothing could ever be made&quot;. He built a fourteen-room &quot;cottage&quot;, as he called it, at the edge of a plateau by Moodna Creek next to a sudden drop into a gorge. Willis worked closely with the architect, Calvert Vaux, to carefully plan each gable and piazza to fully take advantage of the dramatic view of the river and mountains. 

Because of failing health Willis spent the remainder of his life chiefly in retirement at Idlewild. His wife Cornelia was also recovering from a difficult illness after the birth of their first child together, a son named Grinnell, who was born April 28, 1848. They had four other children: Lilian (born April 27, 1850), Edith (born September 28, 1853), Bailey (born May 31, 1857), and a daughter who died only a few minutes after her birth on October 31, 1860.

In 1850, Cornelia Willis re-hired Harriet Jacobs, a fugitive slave from North Carolina, who had already before been working for the family as Imogen&#x27;s nanny. When her legal owners came to New York in 1852 to force her back into slavery, Cornelia Willis bought her freedom for $300. While working for the Willis family at Idlewild, Jacobs wrote her autobiography, published in 1861. Her biographer, Jean Fagan Yellin, comments on the irony of the situation: &quot;Idlewild had been conceived as a famous writer&#x27;s retreat, but its owner never imagined that it was his children&#x27;s nurse who would create an American classic there&quot;. Jacobs stayed with the Willis family until after the publication of her book. Cornelia Willis is called a &quot;true ... friend&quot; in the autobiography, and the friendship lasted into the next generation, ending only with the death of Louisa Jacobs at the home of Edith Willis Grinnell in 1917.

During these last years at Idlewild, Willis continued contributing a weekly letter to the &quot;Home Journal&quot;. In 1850 he assisted Rufus Wilmot Griswold in preparing an anthology of the works of Poe, who had died mysteriously the year before. Griswold also wrote the first biography of Poe in which he purposely set out to ruin the dead author&#x27;s reputation. Willis was one of the most vocal of Poe&#x27;s defenders, writing at one point: &quot;The indictment (for it deserves no other name) is not true. It is full of cruel misrepresentations. It deepens the shadows unto unnatural darkness, and shuts out the rays of sunshines that ought to relieve them&quot;.

Willis was involved in the 1850 divorce suit between the actor Edwin Forrest and his wife Catherine Norton Sinclair Forrest. In January 1849, Forrest had found a love letter to his wife from fellow actor George W. Jamieson. As a result, he and Catherine separated in April 1849. He moved to Philadelphia and filed for divorce in February 1850 though the Pennsylvania legislature denied his application. Catharine went to live with the family of Parke Godwin and the separation became a public affair, with newspapers throughout New York reporting on supposed infidelities and other gossip.

Willis defended Catharine, who maintained her innocence, in the &quot;Home Journal&quot; and suggested that Forrest was merely jealous of her intellectual superiority. On June 17, 1850, shortly after Forrest had filed for divorce in the New York Supreme Court, Forrest beat Willis with a gutta-percha whip in New York&#x27;s Washington Square, shouting &quot;this man is the seducer of my wife&quot;. Willis, who was recovering from a rheumatic fever at the time, was unable to fight back. His wife soon received an anonymous letter with an accusation that Willis was in an adulterous relationship with Catherine Forrest. Willis later sued Forrest for assault and, by March 1852, was awarded $2,500 plus court costs. Throughout the Forrest divorce case, which lasted six weeks, several witnesses made additional claims that Catherine Forrest and Nathaniel Parker Willis were having an affair, including a waiter who claimed he had seen the couple &quot;lying on each other&quot;. As the press reported, &quot;thousands and thousands of the anxious public&quot; awaited the court&#x27;s verdict; ultimately, the court sided with Catherine Forrest and Willis&#x27;s name was cleared.

===&quot;Ruth Hall&quot;===
Willis arbitrarily refused to print the work of his sister Sara Willis (&quot;Fanny Fern&quot;) after 1854, though she previously had contributed anonymous book reviews to the &quot;Home Journal&quot;. She had recently been widowed, became destitute, and was publicly denounced by her abusive second husband. Criticizing what he perceived as her restlessness, Willis once made her the subject of his poem &quot;To My Wild Sis&quot;. As Fanny Fern, she had published &quot;Fern Leaves&quot;, which sold over 100,000 copies the year before. Willis, however, did not encourage his sister&#x27;s writings. &quot;You overstrain the pathetic, and your humor runs into dreadful vulgarity sometimes ... I am sorry that any editor knows that a sister of mine wrote some of these which you sent me&quot;, he wrote. In 1854 she published &quot;Ruth Hall, a Domestic Tale of the Present Time&quot;, a barely concealed semi-autobiographical account of her own difficulties in the literary world. Nathaniel Willis was represented as &quot;Hyacinth Ellet&quot;, an effeminate, self-serving editor who schemes to ruin his sister&#x27;s prospects as a writer. Willis did not publicly protest but in private he asserted that, despite his fictitious equivalent, he had done his best to support his sister during her difficult times, especially after the death of her first husband.

Among his later works, following in his traditional sketches about his life and people he has met, were &quot;Hurry-Graphs&quot; (1851), &quot;Out-Doors at Idlewild&quot; (1854), and &quot;Ragbag&quot; (1855). Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, &quot;Paul Fane&quot;, which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic relief in the novel, may have been based on painter Chester Harding. His final work was &quot;The Convalescent&quot; (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with Washington Irving at Sunnyside.

===Final years and death===

In July 1860, Willis took his last major trip. Along with his wife, he stopped in Chicago and Yellow Springs, Ohio, as far west as Madison, Wisconsin, and also took a steamboat down the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri, and returned through Cincinnati, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1861, Willis allowed the &quot;Home Journal&quot; to break its pledge to avoid taking sides in political discussions when the Confederate States of America was established, calling the move a purposeful act to bring on war. On May 28, 1861, Willis was part of a committee of literary figures—including William Cullen Bryant, Charles Anderson Dana, and Horace Greeley—to invite Edward Everett to speak in New York on behalf of maintaining the Union. The &quot;Home Journal&quot; lost many subscribers during the American Civil War, Morris died in 1864, and the Willis family had to take in boarders and for a time turned Idlewild into a girls&#x27; school for income.

Willis was very sick in these final years: he suffered from violent epileptic seizures and, early in November 1866, fainted in the streets. Willis died on his 61st birthday, January 20, 1867, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Four days later, the day of his funeral, all bookstores in the city were closed as a token of respect. His pallbearers included Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Samuel Gridley Howe, and James T. Fields.

==Reputation==

Throughout his literary career, Willis was well liked and known for his good nature amongst friends. Well traveled and clever, he had a striking appearance at six feet tall and was typically dressed elegantly. Many, however, remarked that Willis was effeminate, Europeanized, and guilty of &quot;Miss Nancyism&quot;. One editor called him &quot;an impersonal passive verb—a pronoun of the feminine gender&quot;. A contemporary caricature depicted him wearing a fashionable beaver hat and tightly closed coat and carrying a cane, reflecting Willis&#x27;s wide reputation as a &quot;dandy&quot;. Willis put considerable effort into his appearance and his fashion sense, presenting himself as a member of an upcoming American aristocracy. As Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. once said, Willis was &quot;something between a remembrance of Count D&#x27;Orsay and an anticipation of Oscar Wilde&quot;. Publisher Charles Frederick Briggs once wrote that &quot;Willis was too Willisy&quot;. He described his writings as the &quot;novelty and gossip of the hour&quot; and was not necessarily concerned about facts but with the &quot;material of conversation and speculation, which may be mere rumor, may be the truth&quot;. Willis&#x27;s behavior in social groups annoyed fellow poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. &quot;He is too artificial&quot;, Longfellow wrote to his friend George Washington Greene. &quot;And his poetry has now lost one of its greatest charms for me—its sincerity&quot;. E. Burke Fisher, a journalist in Pittsburgh, wrote that &quot;Willis is a kind of national pet and we must regard his faults as we do those of a spoiled stripling, in the hope that he will amend&quot;.

Willis built up his reputation in the public at a time when readers were interested in the personal lives of writers. In his writings, he described the &quot;high life&quot; of the &quot;Upper Ten Thousand&quot;, a phrase he coined. His travel writings in particular were popular for this reason as Willis was actually living the life he was describing and recommending to readers. Even so, he manufactured a humble and modest persona, questioned his own literary merit, and purposely used titles, such as &quot;Pencillings by the Way&quot; and &quot;Dashes at Life With Free Pencil&quot;, which downplayed their own quality. His informally toned editorials, which covered a variety of topics, were also very successful. Using whimsicality and humor, he was purposely informal to allow his personality to show in his writing. He addressed his readers personally, as if having a private conversation with them. As he once wrote: &quot;We would have you ... indulge us in our innocent egotism as if it were all whispered in your private ear and over our iced &quot;Margaux&quot;&quot;. When women poets were becoming popular in the 1850s, he emulated their style and focused on sentimental and moral subjects.

In the publishing world, Willis was known as a shrewd magazinist and an innovator who focused on appealing to readers&#x27; special interests while still recognizing new talent. In fact, Willis became the standard by which other magazinists were judged. According to writer George William Curtis, &quot;His gayety [sic] and his graceful fluency made him the first of our proper &#x27;magazinists&#x27;&quot;. For a time, it was said that Willis was the &quot;most-talked-about author&quot; in the United States. Poe questioned Willis&#x27;s fame, however. &quot;Willis is &quot;no&quot; genius–a graceful trifler–no more&quot;, he wrote in a letter to James Russell Lowell. &quot;In me, at least, he never excites an emotion.&quot; Minor Southern writer Joseph Beckham Cobb wrote: &quot;No sane person, we are persuaded, can read his poetry&quot;. Future senator Charles Sumner reported: &quot;I find Willis is much laughed at for his sketches&quot;. Even so, most contemporaries recognized how prolific he was as a writer and how much time he put into all of his writings. James Parton said of him:

By 1850 and with the publication of &quot;Hurry-Graphs&quot;, Willis was becoming a forgotten celebrity. In August 1853, future President James A. Garfield discussed Willis&#x27;s declining popularity in his diary: &quot;Willis is said to be a man, although an unrivaled poet. How strange that such men should go to ruin, when they might soar perpetually in the heaven of heavens&quot;. After Willis&#x27;s death, obituaries reported that he had outlived his fame. One remarked, &quot;the man who withdraws from the whirling currents of active life is speedily forgotten&quot;. This obituary also stated that Americans &quot;will ever remember and cherish Nathaniel P. Willis as one worthy to stand with Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving&quot;. In 1946, the centennial issue of &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; reported that Willis &quot;led a generation of Americans through a gate where weeds gave way to horticulture&quot;. More modern scholars have dismissed Willis&#x27;s work as &quot;sentimental prattle&quot; or refer to him only as an obstacle in the progress of his sister as well as Harriet Jacobs. As biographer Thomas N. Baker wrote, Willis is today only referred to as a footnote in relation to other authors.

<text>Company Sergeant Major Edward Thomas Chapman VC, BEM (13 January 1920 – 3 February 2002) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Ted Chapman was born in Pontlottyn, near Rhymney, the son of a coal miner. He left school at age 14 and like many of his generation followed his father underground at the Ogilvie Colliery.

He enlisted in the British Army in April 1940, during the Second World War, joining the Monmouthshire Regiment and seeing action from his battalion&#x27;s landing shortly after the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944 through the advance into North-west Europe. He was wounded at Falaise in the breakout from the Normandy bridgehead.

==Details==
Chapman was 25 years old, and a corporal in the 3rd Battalion, Monmouthshire Regiment, British Army during the Second World War when the following action took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 2 April 1945, near the Dortmund-Ems canal, Germany, Corporal Chapman&#x27;s section came under heavy machine-gun fire from German units dug in and concealed, causing many casualties. He ordered his men to take cover and went forward alone with a Bren gun, mowing down the enemy at point-blank range, forcing them to retire. His section isolated, Corporal Chapman again halted the enemy advances with his Bren gun, at one time firing it over his shoulder while lying supine on his back in a shallow fold in the ground, to cover those bringing him ammunition. He then carried in his Company Commander, an officer, who was lying wounded, but on the way back the officer was killed by further German fire and Corporal Chapman wounded in the thigh. Refusing hospitalisation he returned to his section and ensured the consolidation of the ground gained which took a further two hours of fighting.

==Honours and awards==
* 13 July 1945 – Teutoburger Wald, Germany, 2 April 1945, Corporal Edward Thomas Chapman, 3rd Bn, Monmouthshire Regiment:

<text>Albert Chowne, VC, MM (19 July 1920 – 25 March 1945) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Chowne was born in Sydney. He attended Chatswood Boys Intermediate High School and Naremburn Junior Technical School.

In 1935, he began work as a shirt-cutter with David Jones. In his spare time Chowne played rugby union and tennis, and took part in Scouting.

==Second World War==
Chowne spent a brief period in the 36th Battalion, a Militia unit, before enlisting in the Second Australian Imperial Force in late May 1940. He was assigned to the 2/13th Battalion as a platoon message runner, and was later made company runner. The unit, part of the 9th Division, arrived in the Middle East in November 1940 and later joined the North African campaign, defending Tobruk for eight months in 1941. During his time at Tobruk, Chowne transferred to the carrier platoon and was promoted to corporal. After Tobruk the 2/13th performed garrison duties in Syria where, in September, Chowne was promoted to sergeant. He was wounded in the leg and hand at El Alamein the following month and spent three weeks in hospital. He returned to Australia with the battalion in January 1943.

In July, the unit was deployed to New Guinea campaign, taking part in the Battle of Finschhafen. Chowne, now commanding a mortar platoon, was awarded the Military Medal for twice crawling close to enemy positions to direct mortar fire. Regarded as exceptionally cool by his comrades, Chowne combined fearlessness with a self-effacing manner.

He was commissioned as a lieutenant in January 1944 and he married Daphne Barton, a corporal in the Australian Women&#x27;s Army Service, in March that year. After completing a jungle warfare training course at Canungra, Queensland, Lt. Chowne was posted to the 2/2nd Battalion, part of the 6th Division, in October 1944. Two months later the 2/2nd began the Aitape-Wewak campaign in New Guinea in November 1944.

===Victoria Cross action===
On 25 March 1945 near Dagua Airfield, Chowne attacked an enemy position which was holding up further movement towards Wewak. Seeing that the leading platoon was suffering heavy casualties, Chowne rushed forward and knocked out two light machine guns with grenades and then, calling on his men to follow him and firing his sub machine gun from the hip, he charged the position. Although he was twice wounded in the chest, the impetus of his charge carried him forward 50 yards under intense machine gun and rifle fire and he accounted for two more of the enemy before he was killed.
Chowne was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously and was buried at the Lae War Cemetery, Lae, New Guinea. His VC is displayed at the Australian War Memorial.

==Legacy==
Chowne&#x27;s name is commemorated in several places around Australia. A street in Campbell, Canberra is named. In the City of Willoughby, Sydney, the community facility is called the Albert Chowne Memorial Hall and in Middle Cove, Chowne Place are both named after him.

On 8 May 2015, Chowne&#x27;s widow, Daphne Dunne, was in the crowd at the Sydney Opera House when Prince Harry was farewelled from Australia by the public at the end of a month-long deployment with the Australian Army. The prince recognised the VC medal in the cluster worn on Dunne&#x27;s right breast, and approached her to discuss the medal as well as her own medals over her left breast. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Dunne had a conversation with the prince and &quot;she told him how her first husband Lieutenant Albert Chowne died aged 25 in 1945 – just a year after they married – in a heroic attack on a Japanese machinegun post in Papua New Guinea. The red roses that Lt Chowne had arranged to be sent to his young bride on her birthday arrived just before the news he had been killed.&quot; It went on to say: &quot;She wed her second husband, Corporal John Dunne, who was captured in Malaya in 1942 and ended up in Changi POW camp ... (regarding the prince) In a show of affection as he leaned down towards her, she touched his face before he kissed her on the cheek.&quot; The newspaper also reported that, in meeting the prince, she had now met all the senior members of the British royal family. Dunne died on 1 April 2019, shortly after receiving a birthday card from Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, to celebrate her 99th birthday.

<text>Brigadier Arthur Edward Cumming VC OBE MC (18 June 1896 – 10 April 1971) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born in Karachi, British India of Scottish parentage and attended Karachi Grammar School.

Cumming was 45 years old, and a lieutenant colonel commanding the 2/12th Frontier Force Regiment, in the Indian Army during World War II. Lt. Col Cumming and his battalion were defending an airfield during the Battle of Malaya when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC (currently displayed at the National Army Museum).

On 3 January 1942 near Kuantan, Malaya, the Japanese made a furious attack on the battalion and a strong enemy force penetrated the position. Lieutenant Colonel Cumming, with a small party of men, immediately led a counter-attack and although all his men became casualties and he, himself, had two bayonet wounds in the stomach he managed to restore the situation sufficiently for the major portion of the battalion and its vehicles to be withdrawn. Later he drove in a carrier, under very heavy fire, collecting isolated detachments of his men and was again wounded. His gallant actions helped the brigade to withdraw safely.

Cumming was one of a small number of officers and men who were ordered to be evacuated from Singapore before the island was surrendered on 15 February 1942. Cumming commanded a battalion of the 9th Jat Regiment before his promotion to brigadier and command of the 63rd Indian Brigade during the Burma campaign. From 1944 to his retirement in 1947 Brigadier Cumming was in command of the Dehra Dun District in India.

His VC is on display at the National Army Museum, Chelsea.

<text>John Brunton Daykins VC MM (Ormiston Farm, Hawick, 26 March 1883 – 24 January 1933, Edinburgh) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Daykins was born in Hawick in 1883 to John and Bessie Daykins, but he moved with his family to Jedburgh when he was a child.

In 1914 he enlisted with the Lothians and Border Horse and he was at Loos, the Battle of Vimy Ridge and the battle of Ypres. After this he was discharged after suffering from Trench fever.

He refused to be labelled as &quot;unfit&quot; and on the third attempt he successfully re-enlisted again in the York and Lancaster Regiment and served in Battle of Passchendaele and again on Vimy Ridge. He was in the 2/4th Battalion at Solesmes, Nord in France on 30 October 1918 with a dozen of his platoon. 

They rushed a machine-gun and during subsequent severe hand-to-hand fighting Daykins disposed of many of the enemy and secured his objective. He then located another machine-gun which was holding up an operation of his company. Under heavy fire he worked his way alone to the post and shortly afterwards returned with 25 prisoners and an enemy machine-gun, which he mounted at his post. His magnificent fighting spirit and example inspired his men, saved many casualties and contributed largely to the success of the attack.

When he returned to Jedburgh he was made a burgess. In 1924 he inherited his family&#x27;s Howden farm when his father died.

== Death and legacy ==

Daykins died in 1933 after an accident with a shotgun. He was unmarried and his medals went to his sister. Elizabeth Daykins gave his medals to the York and Lancaster Regimental Museum which is within Clifton Park Museum, in Rotherham.There is a street in Hawick named for him and Jedburgh decided to lay a commemorative paving stone in 2018. A commemorative event was scheduled to take place in his adopted town of Jedburgh and at Solesmes, Nord where he earned is VC on the centenary of his bravery.

<doc id="1215114" wikidata="Q5362696" url="?curid=1215114" title="Elizabeth Drew Stoddard">
<text>Elizabeth Drew Stoddard ( Barstow; May 6, 1823 – August 1, 1902) was an American poet and novelist.

Soon after her marriage to Richard Henry Stoddard, the author, she began to publish poems in all the leading magazines, and thereafter, she was a frequent contributor. Her verses were of a high order; she wrote for intellectual readers only. The numerous poems she published in periodicals were not collected in book form until &quot;Poems&quot; was published in 1895. In addition to her poetical productions, she published three novels: &quot;The Morgesons&quot; (New York City, 1862); &quot;Two Men&quot; (1865), and &quot;Temple House&quot; (1867). Those books did not find a large sale when first published, but a second edition, published in 1888, found a wider circle of readers. They were pictures of New England scenes and characters. In 1874, she published &quot;Lolly Dinks&#x27;s Doings&quot;, a juvenile story.

==Early life and education==
Elizabeth Drew Barstow was born May 6, 1823, in the small coastal town of Mattapoisett, Massachusetts. She received a thorough education in various boarding-schools and in her school-days showed her bent towards poetry and literature in general. She studied at Wheaton Seminary, Norton, Massachusetts.

==Career==
After her marriage in 1852 to poet Richard Henry Stoddard, the couple settled permanently in New York City, where they belonged to New York&#x27;s vibrant, close-knit literary and artistic circles. She assisted her husband in his literary work, and contributed stories, poems and essays to the periodicals. Many of her own works were originally published between 1859 and 1890 in such magazines as &quot;The Aldine&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;.

Stoddard is most widely known today as the author of &quot;The Morgesons&quot; (1862), her first of three novels. Her other two novels are &quot;Two Men&quot; (1865) and &quot;Temple House&quot; (1867). Stoddard was also a prolific writer of short stories, children&#x27;s tales, poems, essays, travel writing, and journalism pieces.

Her work combines the narrative style of the popular nineteenth-century male-centered bildungsroman with the conventions of women&#x27;s romantic fiction in this revolutionary exploration of the conflict between a woman&#x27;s instinct, passion, and will, and the social taboos, family allegiances, and traditional New England restraint that inhibit her.

Her most studied work, &quot;The Morgesons&quot; is set in a small seaport town, and is the dramatic story of Cassandra Morgeson&#x27;s fight against social and religious norms in a quest for sexual, spiritual, and economic autonomy. An indomitable heroine, Cassandra not only achieves an equal and complete love with her husband and ownership of her family&#x27;s property, but also masters the skills and accomplishments expected of women. Counterpointed with the stultified lives of her aunt, mother, and sister, Cassandra&#x27;s success is a striking and radical affirmation of women&#x27;s power to shape their own destinies. Embodying the convergence of the melodrama and sexual undercurrents of gothic romance and Victorian social realism, &quot;The Morgesons&quot; marks an important transition in the development of the novel and evoked comparisons during Stoddard&#x27;s lifetime with such masters as Honoré de Balzac, Leo Tolstoy, George Eliot, the Brontë sisters, and Nathaniel Hawthorne.

One major source of Stoddard&#x27;s importance to American literature is the historicism of her work, the manner in which her writing embodied and subverted the tension of her present-day culture with the archetypal or received values of the American past. A pioneering predecessor of regionalist authors Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Kate Chopin, as well as a precursor of American modernism, Stoddard&#x27;s writing is remarkable for its almost total lack of sentimentality, pervasive use of irony, psychological depth of richly drawn characters, intense atmospheric descriptions of New England, concise language, and innovative use of narrative voice and structure. Her investigation of relations between the sexes, a dominant focus of her fiction, analyzes emotions ranging from love and desire to disdain, aggression, and depression.

<text>Colonel Francis Cornwallis Maude (28 October 1828 – 19 October 1900) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Maude was born in London, the son of a Royal Naval captain and grandson of Cornwallis Maude, 1st Viscount Hawarden. After attending Blackheath Proprietary School and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned in October 1847 as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. After home service, in 1855 he went to Ceylon to command a battery. On the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in June 1857, Maude&#x27;s battery shipped to Calcutta and joined Henry Havelock&#x27;s force, occupying Cawnpore in July. The force then advanced on Lucknow where, on 25 September 1857, they successfully fought through to reinforce the besieged British forces.

==VC action==
Maude was a 28 years old captain in the Royal Artillery, British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 25 September 1857 at Lucknow, India for which he was awarded the VC:
==Later life==
Maude spent much of the remainder of the Indian Mutiny at Lucknow, including the British withdrawal in November 1857 and the city&#x27;s recapture in March 1858. In this period he was promoted in the army to major (January 1858) and lieutenant colonel (July 1858), and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in March 1858. Returning to England in 1860, Maude was appointed to a garrison artillery battery at Plymouth, before service in the Mediterranean. Promoted to colonel in July 1866, he retired a month later.

After leaving the army, Maude was involved in various business enterprises in Britain and overseas, but in December 1867 he was reported bankrupt. From 1870 he farmed in Canada, then England, before moving abroad in 1875, first to France, then to Warsaw, where he served as British Consul-General from 1876 to 1886. In February 1888 he went to Madagascar where he was involved in timber-felling and farming. He promoted Madagascar as a destination for British emigration and enterprise, later writing a book of his experiences entitled &quot;Five years in Madagascar, with notes on the military situation&quot;, published in 1895. Maude returned to England in 1893, and published his &quot;Memories of the Mutiny&quot; in 1894.

In 1895 Maude was appointed a Military Knight of Windsor by Queen Victoria, a body reserved for retired officers who received a pension and accommodation at Windsor Castle. Maude died at Windsor on 19 October 1900, and was buried in Windsor Borough Cemetery.

==Legacy==
On 24 January 1860 Maude married Paulina Susannah Sterling, they had one son and three daughters. He was the cousin of Lieutenant Colonel F. F. Maude VC.

76 (Maude&#x27;s) Battery Royal Artillery, the current name for Maude&#x27;s unit, was awarded his name as their title in honour of both his and the units deeds at Lucknow. The battery celebrates Maude&#x27;s Day every 25 September, in his honour.

Maude&#x27;s medals are not publicly held.

<text>Sergeant William McNally VC, MM and Bar (16 December 1894 – 5 January 1976) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 23 years old, and a sergeant in the 8th (S) Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (Alexandra, Princess of Wales&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 27 October 1918 at Piave River, Italy, when his company was most seriously hindered by machine-gun fire, Sergeant McNally, regardless of personal safety, rushed the machine-gun post single-handed, killing the team and capturing the gun. Later, at Vazzola on 29 October the sergeant crept up to the rear of an enemy post, put the garrison to flight and captured the machine-gun. On the same day, when holding a newly captured ditch, he was strongly counter-attacked from both flanks, but coolly controlling the fire of his party, he frustrated that attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

His VC is displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London, in the Ashcroft Gallery. His replica medals and personal story are held at the Green Howards Museum, Richmond, North Yorkshire, alongside the medals of a fellow resident of Murton, James Hall DCM MM.

<text>Tom Dresser (1891 – 9 April 1982) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Dresser was born at Laund House Farm, Huby in 1891. He was 25 years old, and a private in the 7th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (Alexandra, Princess of Wales&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 12 May 1917 near Roeux, France, Private Dresser, in spite of having been twice wounded on the way and suffering great pain, succeeded in conveying an important message from battalion headquarters to the front line trenches, which he eventually reached in an exhausted condition. His fearlessness and determination to deliver this message at all costs proved of the greatest value to his battalion at a critical period.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Green Howards Museum in Richmond, North Yorkshire.

<doc id="1215122" wikidata="Q1842040" url="?curid=1215122" title="Gheorghe Tătărescu">
<text>Gheorghe I. Tătărescu (also known as &quot;Guță Tătărescu&quot;, with a slightly antiquated pet form of his given name; 2 November 1886 – 28 March 1957) was a Romanian politician who served twice as Prime Minister of Romania (1934–1937; 1939–1940), three times as Minister of Foreign Affairs (&quot;interim&quot; in 1934 and 1938, appointed to the office in 1945-1947) and once as Minister of War (1934). Representing the &quot;young liberals&quot; faction inside the National Liberal Party (PNL), Tătărescu began his political career as a collaborator of Ion G. Duca, becoming noted for his anticommunism and, in time, for his conflicts with the PNL&#x27;s leader Dinu Brătianu and the Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu. During his first time in office, he moved closer to King Carol II and led an ambivalent policy toward the fascist Iron Guard and ultimately becoming instrumental in establishing the authoritarian and corporatist regime around the National Renaissance Front. In 1940, he accepted the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union and had to resign.

After the start of World War II, Gheorghe Tătărescu initiated a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu&#x27;s dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, and representing it inside the communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, he was also the President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. Then, relations between Tătărescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the Tămădău Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner while being called to testify in the trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. He died soon after his release from prison.

Elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy in 1937, he was removed from his seat by the communist authorities in 1948. One of his brothers, Colonel Ștefan Tătărescu, was at some point the leader of a minor Nazi group, the National Socialist Party.

==Early life and politics==
Born in Târgu Jiu, Tătărescu studied at Carol I High School in Craiova. He later went to France, where he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Paris in 1912, with a thesis on the Romanian parliamentary system (&quot;Le régime électoral et parlementaire en Roumanie&quot;). He subsequently worked as a lawyer in Bucharest. He fathered a son, Tudor, and a daughter, Sanda (married to the lawyer Ulise Negropontes in 1940).

After joining the National Liberal Party (PNL), he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in November 1919, representing Gorj County. Among his first notable actions as a politician was an initiative to interpellate Nicolae L. Lupu, the Minister of Interior Affairs Ministry in the Romanian National Party-Peasants&#x27; Party cabinet in answer to concerns that the executive was tolerating socialist agitation in the countryside.

He stood among the PNL&#x27;s &quot;young liberals&quot; faction, as they were colloquially known, supporting free trade and a more authoritarian rule over the country around King Carol II, and opposing both the older generation of leaders (who tended to advocate protectionism and a liberal democracy) and the dissident group of Gheorghe I. Brătianu (&quot;see National Liberal Party-Brătianu&quot;).

The Undersecretary in the Interior Affairs Ministry under several PNL cabinets (beginning with that of Ion I. C. Brătianu in 1922–1926), he first became noted as a collaborator of Ion G. Duca. In 1924–1936, in contrast to his agenda after World War II agenda, Tătărescu was a noted anticommunist, and reacted vehemently against the Romanian Communist Party (PCdR, later PCR), recommending and obtaining its outlawing, based on communist adversity to the concept of Greater Romania, and notably arguing that the Comintern-supported Tatarbunary Uprising was evidence of &quot;imperialist communism&quot;.

==First cabinet==

===Context===
Tătărescu became leader of the cabinet in January 1934, as the fascist Iron Guard had assassinated Prime Minister Duca on 30 December 1933 (the five-day premiership of Constantin Anghelescu ensured transition between the two governments). His was the second PNL cabinet formed during Carol&#x27;s reign, and the latter&#x27;s failure to draw support from the mainstream group led to a tight connection being established between Carol and the young liberals, with Tătărescu backing the process leading to the creation of a royal dictatorship. One of Tătărescu&#x27;s first measures was a decisive move to end the conflict between the National Liberal executive and the Mayor of Bucharest, Dem I. Dobrescu (who was backed by the National Peasants&#x27; Party)—making use of his prerogative, he removed Dobrescu from office on 18 January.

The brief period constituted a reference point in Romanian economy, as the emergence from the Great Depression, although marked by endemic problems, saw prosperity more widespread than ever before. This was, in part, the contribution of new economic relations which Tătărescu defended and encouraged: the state transformed itself into the main agent of economic activities, allowing for prosperous businesses to benefit from its demands, and, in time, leading to the creation of a &quot;camarilla&quot; dominated by the figures of industrialists such as Aristide Blank, Nicolae Malaxa, and Max Auschnitt. In this context, Tătărescu&#x27;s allegedly subservient position in front of Carol was a frequent topic of ridicule at the time. According to a hostile account of the socialist Petre Pandrea:
&quot;Tătărescu was ceremonious in order to cover his menial nature. When he was leaving audiences [with the King], he pressed forward on the small of his back and returned &quot;facing backwards&quot; from the desk to the door, not daring to show his back. [...] Watching over the scene [...], Carol II exclaimed to his intimate assistants: — I don&#x27;t have a big enough tooshie for all the politicians to kiss!&quot;

Among other services rendered, he intervened in the conflict between Carol and his brother, Prince Nicholas, asking the latter to renounce either his marriage to Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti—considered a misalliance by Carol, it had not been recognized by Romanian authorities—or his princely prerogatives. Nicholas chose the latter alternative in 1937.

Inside his party, Tătărescu lost ground to Dinu Brătianu, elected by the traditional Liberal elite as a compromise in order to ensure unity; upon his election in 1934, the latter stated:
&quot;This time as well, I would have gladly conceded, if I were to believe that anyone else in the party could gather voter unanimity.&quot;

The issue remained debated for the following two years. The party congress of July 1936 eventually elected Tătărescu to the second position in the party, that of general secretary.

===European politics===
In his foreign policy, Prime Minister Tătărescu balanced two different priorities, attempting to strengthen the traditional military alliance with Poland which was aimed at the Soviet Union, and reacting against the growing regional influence of Nazi Germany by maintaining the relevancy of the Little Entente and establishing further contacts with the Soviets.

In August 1936, he removed Nicolae Titulescu from the office of Foreign Minister, replacing him with Victor Antonescu. This caused an uproar, with most of Romania&#x27;s diplomatic corps voicing their dissatisfaction. Over the following months, virtually all of Titulescu&#x27;s supporters were themselves recalled (including, among others, Constantin Vișoianu, the ambassador to Poland, Constantin Antoniade, Romania&#x27;s representative to the League of Nations, Dimitrie Ghyka, the ambassador to Belgium, and Caius Brediceanu, the ambassador to Austria) while Titulescu&#x27;s adversaries, such as Antoine Bibesco, were returned to office. Bibesco subsequently campaigned in France and the United Kingdom, in an attempt to reassure Romania&#x27;s main allies that the move did not signify a change in Romania&#x27;s priorities. Tătărescu was later blamed by his own party for having renounced the diplomatic course on which Romania had engaged.

In early 1937, Tătărescu rejected the proposal of Józef Beck, Poland&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, to withdraw Romania&#x27;s support for Czechoslovakia and attempt a reconciliation with Hungary (the following year, Romania withdrew its support for the former, indicating, just before the Munich Agreement, that it was not in a position to guarantee Czechoslovakia&#x27;s frontiers). This was accompanied by Czechoslovak initiatives to establish close contacts between the Little Entente and the Soviets: a scandal erupted in the same year, when the country&#x27;s ambassador to Romania, Jan Šeba, published a volume calling for Soviet-Entente military cooperation (despite the Soviet-Romanian conflict over Bessarabia) and expressing the hope that the Soviet state would extend its borders into West Belarus and Ukraine. Kamil Krofta, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Foreign Minister, received criticism for having prefaced the book, and, after Tătărescu paid a visit to Czechoslovak Prime Minister Milan Hodža, Šeba was recalled to Prague.

===Facing the Iron Guard===
In combating the Iron Guard, Tătărescu chose to relax virtually all pressures on the latter (while mimicking some of its messages), and instead concentrated again on curbing the activities of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) and outlawing its &quot;Popular Front&quot;-type organizations (&quot;see Amicii URSS&quot;).

In April 1936, he and the Minister of the Interior Ion Inculeț allowed a youth congress to gather in Târgu Mureș, aware of the fact that it was masking a fascist gathering; delegates to the congress, traveling in a special train commissioned by the government, vandalized Ion Duca&#x27;s memorial plate in Sinaia train station, and, upon their arrival in Târgu Mureș, made public their violent antisemitic agenda. It was probably there that death squads were designated and assigned missions, leading to the murder of Mihai Stelescu, a former associate, in June of the next year.

In February 1937, an intense publicity campaign by the Guard, begun with the ostentatious funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin (killed in the Spanish Civil War) and culminating in the physical assaulting of Traian Bratu, rector of the University of Iași, by Guardist students, provoked the premier&#x27;s order to close down universities throughout the country.

Later in that year, the collaboration between monarch and premier, coupled with the fact that Tătărescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the National Peasants&#x27; Party (the main democratic opposition group), and the National Liberal Party-Brătianu—the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to manipulate the votes in elections. (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants&#x27; Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the electoral pact.) Tătărescu&#x27;s own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party.

The 1937 elections led to an unprecedented situation: although the PNL and Tătărescu had gained the largest percentage of the vote (almost 36%), they fell short of being awarded majority bonus (granted at 40% of the vote). As the far right had gathered momentum (the Guard, running under the name of &quot;Everything for the Fatherland Party&quot;, had obtained 15.6% of the vote), Carol was faced with the threat of an Iron Guard government, which would have been one deeply opposed to all of his political principles: he called on a third party, Octavian Goga&#x27;s National Christian Party (coming from the antisemitic far right but deeply opposed to the Guard) to form a new cabinet in December of that year.

Consequently, Tătărescu renounced his offices inside the party, and, while keeping his office of general secretary, he was surpassed by the readmitted Gheorghe I. Brătianu — who was elected to the new office of PNL vice president on 10 January 1938. After the failure of Goga&#x27;s policies to curb the rise of their competitors, the king, backed by Tătărescu, resorted to dissolving all political parties on 30 May 1938, creating instead the National Renaissance Front.

===Rearmament===
As Prime Minister, Tătărescu showed particular concern for the modernization of the Romanian Armed Forces. Almost immediately after becoming Prime Minister, he established the Ministry of Armaments, chaired by himself. This ministry lasted for over three years before being dissolved on 23 February 1937, during his third cabinet.

Under Tătărăscu&#x27;s premiership, Romania launched a ten-year rearmament program on 27 April 1935. Under this program, Romania acquired 248 Škoda 100 mm howitzers (delivered in the mid-1930s) and 180 Škoda 150 mm howitzers (delivered between 1936 and 1939). In 1936, Romania ordered 126 LT vz 35 tanks and 35 R-1 tankettes. These acquisitions from Czechoslovakia were followed in 1937 by 12 Focke-Wulf Fw 58 aircraft, ordered from Germany and delivered between April and June that same year. Romania employed German technicians to build a shipyard at Galați using materials supplied by the Reșița works. There, two submarines would be built between 1938 and 1943, among others (&quot;Marsuinul&quot; and &quot;Rechinul&quot;). The resumed and much improved trade relations with Škoda, following the disastrous &quot;Škoda Affair&quot; of the early 1930s, were credited to the energy and ability of Tătărăscu, &quot;the soldier-politician who reversed the usual order in Romanian politics by placing the welfare of the country superior to the lust for graft&quot;. It is worth noting, however, that of the 35 tankettes and 126 tanks ordered during Tătărescu&#x27;s premiership, only 10 of the former and 15 of the latter actually arrived in Romania before the end of his mandate at the end of 1937. Both of these orders were delivered in full during late 1938 and early 1939, respectively. In 1936, Romania also started producing the Polish PZL P.11 fighter aircraft, of which 95 were ultimately built by IAR. In 1937, Romanian production of the improved PZL P.24 also commenced, with 25 fighters being built until 1939.

==Second cabinet==

In this context, Tătărescu chose to back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants&#x27; Party, remained active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning it had never been enforced any further). Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties, he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested the legitimacy of the action for the following years. Allegedly, his ousting was recommended by Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants&#x27; Party&#x27;s and, for the following years, the closest of Dinu Brătianu&#x27;s political allies.

Soon after his second arrival to power, Tătărescu became noted for the enthusiastic support he gave to the modernist sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, and directed state funds to finance the building of Brâncuși&#x27;s &quot;The Endless Column&quot; complex in Târgu Jiu (completed in October 1938).

Alongside Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu (whom he succeeded as Premier), Tătărescu became a dominant figure in the group of maverick pro-Carol politicians. After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a national government that was to back Carol&#x27;s foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania&#x27;s borders after the outbreak of World War II. In 1945, Tătărescu stressed his belief that authoritarianism benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war. Tătărescu&#x27;s second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties, and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by Ernest Urdăreanu and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.

Tătărescu remained in office throughout the rest of the Phony War, until the fall of France, and his cabinet signed an economic agreement with Nazi Germany (through which virtually all Romanian exports were directed towards the latter country) and saw the crumbling of Romania&#x27;s alliance with the United Kingdom and France. The cabinet was brought down by the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union (effects of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact), as well as by Carol&#x27;s attempt to appease German hostility by dissolving it, replacing Tătărescu with Ion Gigurtu, and recreating the Front as the totalitarian &quot;Party of the Nation&quot;.

==World War II==

After the Second Vienna Award (when Northern Transylvania was lost to Hungary, confirming Carol&#x27;s failure to preserve both the country&#x27;s neutrality and its territorial integrity), Romania was taken over by an Iron Guard dictatorial government (the National Legionary State). Speaking five years later, Dinu Brătianu placed the blame for the serious developments on Tătărescu&#x27;s own actions, addressing him directly:
&quot;I remind you: [...] you have contributed directly, in 1940, in steering the country towards a foreign policy that, as one could tell even then, was to prove ill-fated and which led us to the loathsome Vienna settlement, one which you have supported inside the Crown Council [...].&quot;

On 26 November 1940, the Iron Guard began a bloody retaliation against various political figures who had served under Carol (following a late investigation into the 1938 killing of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the movement&#x27;s founder and early leader, by Carol&#x27;s authorities). Tătărescu and Constantin Argetoianu were among the second wave of captured politicians (on 27 November), and were destined for arbitrary execution; they were, however, saved by the intervention of regular police forces, most of whom had grown hostile to the Guardist militias.

Retired from political life during the war, he was initially sympathetic to Ion Antonescu&#x27;s pro-German dictatorship (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;)—Dinu Brătianu, who remained in opposition to the Antonescu regime, made mention an official visit to Bessarabia, recovered after the start of Operation Barbarossa, when Tătărescu had accompanied Antonescu, &quot;thus making common cause with his warmongering action&quot;. At the time, his daughter Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes worked as an ambulance driver for the Romanian Red Cross.

In the end, Tătărescu became involved in negotiations aimed at withdrawing Romania from the conflict, and, while beginning talks with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), tried to build foreign connections to support Romania&#x27;s cause following the inevitable defeat; he thus corresponded with Edvard Beneš, leader of the Czechoslovak government in exile in England. Beneš, who had already been discussing matters involving Romania with Richard Franasovici and Grigore Gafencu, and had agreed to support the Romanian cause, informed the Allied governments of Tătărescu&#x27;s designs.

Tătărescu later contrasted his diplomatic approach with the strategy of Barbu Știrbey (who had only attempted an agreement with the Western Allies in Cairo, instead of opening relations with the Soviets). Initially meeting with the refusal of Iuliu Maniu and Dinu Brătianu (who decided to invest their trust in Știrbey), he was relatively successful after the Cairo initiative proved fruitless: the two traditional parties accepted collaboration with the bloc formed by the PCR, the Romanian Social Democratic Party, the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front, and the Socialist Peasants&#x27; Party, leading to the formation of the short-lived and unstable &quot;National Democratic Bloc&quot; (BND) in June 1944. It overthrew Antonescu in August, by means of the successful King Michael Coup.

==Alliance with the Communists==
Tătărescu returned to the PNL later in 1944—after the Soviet Red Army had entered Romania and the country had become an Allied state, political parties were again allowed to register. Nevertheless, Tătărescu was again opposed to the party leaders Dinu and Gheorghe I. Brătianu, and split to form his own group in June–July 1945. Dinu Brătianu convened the PNL leadership and formally excluded Tătărescu and his partisans, citing their support for dictatorial regimes.

As the PCR, which was growing more influential (with the backing of Soviet occupation) while generally lacking popular appeal, sought to form alliances with various forces in order to increase its backing, Tătărescu declared his group to be left-wing and Social liberal, while attempting to preserve a middle course in the new political setting, by pleading for close relations to be maintained with both the Soviet Union and the Western Allies. N. D. Cocea, a prominent socialist who had joined the PNL, represented the faction in talks for an alliance with the Communists. The agreement, favored by Ana Pauker, was vehemently opposed by another member of the Communist leadership, Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, who argued in favor of &quot;making a distinction inside the bourgeoisie&quot;, and collaborating with the main PNL, while calling Tătărescu&#x27;s faction &quot;a gang of con artists, blackmailers, and well-known bribers&quot;.

Tătărescu became Foreign Minister and vice president of the government in the cabinet of Petru Groza when the latter came into office after Soviet pressures in 1945; his faction had been awarded leadership of four other ministries—Finance, with three successive office-holders (of whom the last was Alexandru Alexandrini), Public Works, with Gheorghe Vântu, Industry (with Petre N. Bejan), and Religious Affairs, with Radu Roșculeț. He indirectly helped the PCR carry out an electoral fraud during the general election in 1946 by failing to reply to American proposals for organizing fair elections. At the Paris Conference, where he was accompanied by the PCR leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Pătrășcanu, he acknowledged the dissolution of &quot;Greater Romania&quot; under the provisions of the new Treaty (1947).

==1947 and after==
Tensions between his group with the PCR occurred when the former founded itself as a party under the name of &quot;National-Liberal Party&quot; (commonly known as the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu), and, in June–July 1945, proclaimed its goal to be the preservation of property and a middle class under a new regime. Of himself and his principles, Tătărescu stated:
&quot;I am not a communist. Taking in view my attitudes towards mankind, society, property, I am not a communist. Thus, the new orientation in external politics which I demand for my country cannot be accused of being determined by affinities or sympathies of doctrine.&quot;

Speaking in retrospect, Gheorghiu-Dej indicated the actual relation between his party and Tătărescu&#x27;s: &quot;we have had to tolerate by our side a capitalist-gentry political group, Tătărescu&#x27;s group&quot;.

Tătărescu himself continued to show his support for several PCR policies: in the summer of 1947, he condemned the United States for having protested against the repression of forces in the opposition. Nevertheless, at around the same time, he issued his own critique of the Groza government, becoming the target of violent attacks initiated by Miron Constantinescu in the PCR press. Consequently, he was singled out for negligence in office when, during the kangaroo trial of Iuliu Maniu (&quot;see Tămădău Affair&quot;), it was alleged that several employees of his ministry had conspired against the government. &quot;Scînteia&quot;, the official voice of the PCR, wrote of all National Liberal Party-Tătărescu offices in the government: &quot;The rot is all-encompassing! It has to be removed!&quot;.

Tătărescu resigned his office on 6 November 1947, and was replaced by the Communist Ana Pauker. For the following two months, he was sidelined in his own party by PCR pressures, and removed from its leadership in January 1948 (being replaced with Petre N. Bejan—the party was subsequently known as &quot;National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan&quot;). One of his last actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the Marshall Plan.

After the proclamation of the &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of Romania&quot; on 30 December 1947, the existence of all parties other than the PCR had become purely formal, and, after the elections of 28 March the one-party state was confirmed by legislation. He was arrested on 5 May 1950, and held in the notorious Sighet Prison, alongside three of his brothers—Ștefan Tătărescu included—and his former collaborator Bejan. His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, and had to be committed to an institution (where he died in 1955). Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin.

One of Gheorghe Tătărescu&#x27;s last appearances in public was his stand as one of the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses in the 1954 trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, when he claimed that the defendant had been infiltrated into the PCR during the time when he had been premier (Pătrășcanu was posthumously cleared of all charges). Released in 1955, Tătărescu died in Bucharest, less than two years later. According to Sanda Tătărescu Negropontes, this came as a result of tuberculosis contracted while in detention.

<text>Henry Eric Harden (23 February 1912 – 23 January 1945) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Harden was a 32-year-old, lance-corporal in the Royal Army Medical Corps attached No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 23 January 1945 during Operation Blackcock, at Brachterbeek, the Netherlands, three marines of the leading section of the Royal Marine Commando Troop to which Lance-Corporal Harden was attached fell, wounded. The Commando section had come under heavy machine-gun fire in the open field that morning, and the men were seriously wounded. One of the casualties was Lieutenant Corey. Under intense mortar and machine-gun fire Harden was wounded in his side as he carried one man back to the aid post, which had been set up in one of the houses along the Stationsweg in Brachterbeek. Against the orders of another Medical officer he then returned with a stretcher party for the other two wounded. Bringing in the second casualty the rescue party came under enemy fire which killed the wounded Commando. While finally bringing back the third man Lieutenant Corey, who had demanded he be recovered last, Harden was shot through the head and killed instantly. Henry Eric Harden was then 32 years old, married and father of a son and daughter. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his fearless action. On the bridge near the mill there is a plaque to commemorate Lance Corporal Harden.

Lance-Corporal Harden&#x27;s final resting place is in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery at Nederweert, Limburg, the Netherlands.

Known locally by his friends &amp; family simply as Eric, his death was recently commemorated in his home town of Northfleet.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum in Mytchett, Surrey.

<text>David Samuel Anthony Lord, (18 October 1913 – 19 September 1944) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A transport pilot in the Royal Air Force, Lord received the award posthumously for his actions during the Battle of Arnhem while flying resupply missions in support of British paratroops.

==Early life==
David Lord was born on 18 October 1913 in Cork, Ireland, one of three sons of Samuel (a warrant officer in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers) and Mary Lord (née Miller). One of Lord&#x27;s brothers died in infancy.

After the First World War the family were posted to British India and Lord attended Lucknow Convent School. On his father&#x27;s retirement from the Army the family moved to Wrexham and then David was a pupil at St Mary&#x27;s College, Aberystwyth, and then the University of Wales. Later, he attended the English College, Valladolid, Spain, to study for the priesthood. Deciding that it was not the career for him, he returned to Wrexham, before moving to London in the mid-1930s to work as a freelance writer.

==Second World War==
Lord enlisted in the Royal Air Force on 6 August 1936. After reaching the rank of corporal in August 1938, he applied to undertake pilot training, which he began in October 1938. Successfully gaining his pilot&#x27;s wings, he became a sergeant pilot in April 1939, and was posted to No. 31 Squadron RAF, based in Lahore, India. He later flew the Vickers Valentia biplane transport. In 1941, No. 31 Squadron was the first unit to receive the Douglas DC-2 which was followed by both the Douglas DC-3 and Dakota transports. That year he was promoted to flight sergeant and then warrant officer. He flew in North Africa, supporting troops in Libya and Egypt for four months, before being posted back to India. Commissioned as a pilot officer in May 1942, he flew supply missions over Burma, for which he was mentioned in despatches.

Lord was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in July 1943, receiving the award at Buckingham Palace, and was promoted to flight lieutenant shortly afterwards. By January 1944, he had joined No. 271 Squadron (based at RAF Down Ampney, Gloucestershire) and began training as part of preparations for the invasion of Europe. On D-Day, Lord carried paratroopers into France and his aircraft was hit by flak, returning to base without flaps.

===Battle of Arnhem===
The Battle of Arnhem was part of Operation Market Garden, an attempt to secure a string of bridges through the Netherlands. At Arnhem, the British 1st Airborne Division and Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade were tasked with securing bridges across the Lower Rhine, the final objectives of the operation. However, the airborne forces that dropped on 17 September were not aware that the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer divisions were also near Arnhem for rest and refit. Their presence added a substantial number of Panzergrenadiers, tanks and self-propelled guns to the German defences and the Allies suffered heavily in the ensuing battle. Only a small force managed to hold one end of the Arnhem road bridge before being overrun on 21 September. The rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket west of the bridge and had to be evacuated on 25 September. The Allies failed to cross the Rhine, which remained under German control until Allied offensives in March 1945.

===Resupply flights===

Lord was 30 years old, and a flight lieutenant serving with No. 271 Squadron, Royal Air Force during the Second World War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 19 September 1944, during the Battle of Arnhem in the Netherlands, the British 1st Airborne Division was in desperate need of supplies. Lord&#x27;s Douglas Dakota III &quot;KG374&quot; encountered intense enemy anti-aircraft fire and was twice hit, with one engine burning. Lord managed to drop his supplies, but at the end of the run found that there were two containers remaining. Although he knew that one of his wings might collapse at any moment, he nevertheless made a second run to drop the last supplies, then ordered his crew to bail out. A few seconds later, the Dakota crashed in flames with its pilot and six crew members.

Only the navigator, Flying Officer Harold King, survived, becoming a prisoner of war. It was only on his release in mid-1945, as well as the release of several paratroops from the 10th Parachute Battalion, that the story of Lord&#x27;s action became known. Lord was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

==Victoria Cross citation==

The full citation for Lord&#x27;s VC appeared in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 9 November 1945, reading:

==Legacy==

After Arnhem was liberated in April 1945, Grave Registration Units of the British 2nd Army moved into the area and began to locate the Allied dead. Lord was buried alongside his crew in the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery. There are many plaques in memory of him, including one at Wrexham Cathedral in Wales.

Several aircraft have carried tributes to Lord. Between 1993 and 1998, the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight&#x27;s Dakota, serial &quot;ZA947&quot;, was painted in the colours of Lord&#x27;s aircraft during the Arnhem battle, and bore the same code letters: YS-DM. Between 1973 and 2005, the Dakota displayed at RAF Museum Cosford was similarly painted and coded to represent Lord&#x27;s aircraft. From 1966 until its disbandment in 2005, No. 10 Squadron RAF was equipped with Vickers VC-10s, each of which was named after a Royal Air Force or Royal Flying Corps VC recipient. Aircraft serial number &#x27;XR810&#x27; was named &quot;David Lord VC&quot;.

Lord&#x27;s Victoria Cross was presented to his parents at Buckingham Palace in December 1945. In 1997, Lord&#x27;s VC, along with his other decorations and medals, were sold at auction by Spinks to Lord Ashcroft. As of 2014, the medal group was on display at the Imperial War Museum.

<doc id="1215144" wikidata="Q335635" url="?curid=1215144" title="Al-Mawardi">
<text>Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Habib (; –1058), commonly known by the &quot;nisba&quot; al-Mawardi (), was a Sunni polymath and a Shafi&#x27;i jurist, legal theoretician, muhaddith, theologian, sociologist and an expert in political science. He is considered to be an eminent scholar of his time who wrote on numerous subjects, including Qur&#x27;anic interpretations, religion, government, public and constitutional law, language, ethics and belles-lettres.

==Name==
As the son of a person who sold rose water, the terms &quot;maa&quot; (water) and &quot;Wardah&quot; (rose) are combined to form the name &quot;Al-Mawardi.&quot; The title &quot;Al-Mawardi&quot; was given to him because of his brilliance, eloquence, and great analytical abilities in debate, discussions, and oratory. He was also eager in evaluating a variety of situations that he came across.

==Early life==
He was born in the year 364 AH/974 CE in Basra, Iraq. Some authors make the claim that his family was Kurdish, a claim which is unsubstantiated.

===Education===
When Baghdad was a centre and hub of civilization, learning, and knowledge, that is when al-Mawardi pursued his education there. Along with his companions, he started his studies at a very young age, concentrating on religious sciences and specifically the study of Hadith. Based on chronicles of his early schooling, al-Mawardi pursued his study in his native Basra region. He received instruction in the field of Hadith from a number of well-known hadith scholars. It is confirmed by his pupil Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi that al-Mawardi was regarded in Hadith as having a solid memory, being reliable and being trustworthy. Al-Mawardi left his village to complete his education before moving to Baghdad and settling in Darb az-Za&#x27;farani. There, he pursued his education in Hadith and Fiqh and joined the renowned Abu Hamid al-Isfarayini&#x27;s halaqah (study circle). Al-Mawardi set out on a journey to various regions to disseminate and put his knowledge to use after completing his education in Baghdad. He travelled for a while before coming back to Baghdad to share the immense knowledge he had gained.

===Teachers===
Al-Mawardi studied under prominent and leading figures of his time. He studied Kalam under Abu Ishaq al-Isfarayini. He studied Fiqh under Abu Hamid al-Isfarayini. He studied Hadith under Abubakr al-Barqani. He studied Arabic language under Muhammad Bin al-Mu&#x27;ally al-Azdy. His other notables who were renowned in Baghdad include al-Manqiri, al-Shumayri, al-Jabali, Ja&#x27;far bin Muhammad al-Fadal bin Abdullah Abu Qasim al-Dara and Ali Abu Isfarayini.

==Scholarly life==
After gaining knowledge from his mentors, al-Mawardi started teaching in Baghdad, where many eminent scholars were his students. In addition, al-Mawardi is known for having outstanding character, patience, humility, and charm. Even though they had never met him in person, his classmates and coworkers who had the chance to get to know him attested to his qualities. These attributes also add to his great reputation and the respect he was regarded in.

Between the late tenth and mid-eleventh centuries, when al-Mawardi lived, the Muslim political landscape was marked by instability and collapse. Compared to earlier times, the circumstances were far more worrisome. The monarch al-Qadir assembled four legal scholars from the four schools of jurisprudence in 429 Hijriyah to create summaries in order to address the troubling and chaotic periods. Al-Mawardi was one of them; he was assigned to represent the Shafi&#x27;i school and authored the book &quot;al-Iqna&quot;, while al-Quduri wrote the famous &quot;al-Mukhtasar&quot; on behalf of the Hanafites. The other two works, however, were not as important. The ruler gave Imam al-Mawardi praise for his exceptional writing and declared that al-Mawardi&#x27;s effort was the best and, in recognition of his excellence, named him the &quot;Aqda al-Quḍāt&quot; (supreme judge) of the Abbasid Caliphate in recognition of his accomplishments. This appointment was sparked criticism and objections from some leading jurists, including Qāḍi al-Quḍāt Abu al-Tayyib al-Tabari, and Qāḍi al-Sinsari, who disagreed with this appellation, arguing that no one should hold such position except Allah. The title of &quot;Malik al-Muluk al-A&#x27;zam&quot; was earlier granted to Jalal al-Dawla, the Buwaihid ruler, by the same jurists, thus al-Mawardi ignored these objections and kept the position until his death in 450/1058.

The leaders of the Sunni Abbasid and Shia Buwayhid dynasties nonetheless favoured al-Mawardi even though he was Sunni and followed the Shafi&#x27;i school. The Abbasid caliph appointed Al-Mawardi as his representative and sent him to a number of nations as the ambassador. He played a vital role in restoring Muslim unity by negotiating with the Buyid emirs and Seljuk sultans. He was rewarded with many grand gifts and tributes by majority of the Sultans and rulers of the time.

==Death==
Al-Mawardi passed away on the 30th of Rabi&#x27;ul Awwal in 450 Hijri which is equivalent to May 27, 1058 CE at the age of 86. Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi attended and led the funeral prayer for him. Numerous rulers and scholars attended the funeral of al-Mawardi. His body was buried in Mansur, Baghdad&#x27;s Bab Harb Cemetery. His death came just 11 days after the passing of Qadi Abu al-Tayyib.

==Socio-political climate==
Al-Mawardi lived during the Islamic Golden Age, a period of intellectual and cultural flourishing, but also within the decline of the Abbasid caliphate. He lived in a time signalled by a period of progressive deterioration of social and political disintegration that finally led to the fall of the Abbasid dynasty in 1258. The rise of several dynasties that broke away from Abbasid power and founded their own mini-kingdoms outside of its purview was a glaring example of this. However, even as the Abbasid dynasty&#x27;s political influence declined, political, philosophical, and scientific advancements persisted throughout the Islamic world. A number of well-known individuals appeared, such as al-Mawardi, al-Farabi, al-Ghazali and others. It resulted from political leaders&#x27; intense interest in information acquisition.

Baghdad functioned as the centre of Islamic civilization and the fulcrum of the Islamic state in its formative years. The progress of Islamic civilization was fueled by the leaders of Baghdad. They also functioned as a state with power and sway over a large swath of Islamic territory.

Moreover, at that time, the idea that a nation&#x27;s strength and grandeur originated from its knowledge base gained widespread acceptance. Therefore, political leaders and tyrants made great attempts to value and advance intellectual endeavours. Additionally, their way of thinking was influenced by the Mu&#x27;tazilah, a rationalistic religious movement, and the rising Shi&#x27;ism ideology that the Abbasid dynasty&#x27;s rulers from the Buwayhid group accepted.

==Legacy and contribution to political science and sociology==
Al-Mawardi was the founder of the political science in the Islamic World and first writer on political theory in the history of Islam. He is therefore considered one of the most renowned pioneers and thinkers of the political science in Islamic history. His original work influenced the development of this subject, together with the science of sociology, which was further developed and expanded later on by Ibn Khaldun.

Al Mawardi&#x27;s contribution impacted heavily to the two fields through a number of monumental of great books authored by him, his most famous were &quot;Kitab al-Ahkam al-Sultania&quot;, &quot;Qanun al Wazarah&quot;, and &quot;Kitab Nasihat al-Mulk&quot;. These books discuss the principles of political science with special reference and ministers, relationships between the populace and the administration, as well as calculations to strengthen the government and secure a victory in conflict.

The first Islamic jurisprudence work devoted solely to political application and governance was his book &quot;Al-Ahkām As-Ṣulṭāniyyah&quot;. Al-Mawardi was &quot;the first Muslim scholar to bother to collect all the ordinances relating to public law and arrange them in one volume.&quot; Al-Ahkām, since then has been the primary standard source in both contemporary studies of Islamic mediaeval political theory and conventional Sunni political thinking.

Al Mawardi was an author and advocator of the doctrine necessity in political science. He was in favour of a strong government and spoke out against unlimited powers given to the governors which he postulated would create disorder and chaos on the other hand, he has brought forth clear principles for elections of the Caliph rulers and standards of the voters among which the most important achievement of a degree of intellectual capacity and also morality of the character. On the subject of &quot;Ethics&quot;, he wrote his book &quot;Kitaab adaab al-dunya wa al-din&quot;, which became widely a famous book on this topic and is still read in many Islamic countries of today.

==Works==

Al-Mawardi was a prolific writer who created a large body of written material. His judicial actions did not lessen his love of writing. Despite having to relocate frequently due to his judicial duties, al-Mawardi persisted in teaching and mentoring his pupils while writing a book. Since much of his writings were hidden in books that have never been found, they have not been well known throughout history. Based on the papers he described, only a small percentage of his works have been located and shared among his students. Al-Mawardi is remembered as a meticulous and sincere scholar in which he manifests it into his works.

<doc id="1215145" wikidata="Q3719466" url="?curid=1215145" title="Edmund Clarence Stedman">
<text>Edmund Clarence Stedman (October 8, 1833January 18, 1908) was an American poet, critic, essayist, banker, and scientist.

== Early life ==
Edmund Clarence Stedman was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on October 8, 1833; his father, Major Edmund Burke Stedman died of tuberculosis two years later in December 1835. By the following spring, his mother Elizabeth Clementine Stedman moved the boy and his younger brother to Plainfield, New Jersey, to live with her wealthy father, David Low Dodge. 

Dodge, a Calvinist and pacifist, was strict, did not want to use his finances to support his grandchildren, and often physically punished the boys for bad behavior. Mrs. Stedman sold poems and stories to magazines including &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Sartain&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot;, and &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot; for income. Eventually, the children were taken in by their paternal grandfather, Griffin Stedman, and his brother James in Norwich, Connecticut.

Stedman enrolled in Yale University in 1849 at the age of 16. Stedman studied two years at Yale University, but was suspended and did not return. Yale later restored him to the Class of 1853 and gave him the degree of Master of Arts.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===

After leaving Yale, he became a journalist for &quot;The Norwich Tribune&quot; and became an editor at the age of 19. In 1854, he moved to Winstead, Connecticut, and edited &quot;The Herald&quot;. He then moved to New York City in 1856 and joined the staff of the &quot;Tribune&quot; and then the &quot;World&quot;, for which latter paper he served as field correspondent during the first years of the Civil War. As opportunity offered, he studied law and was for a time private secretary to Attorney-General Bates at Washington, and was a member of the New York Stock Exchange in Wall Street from 1865 to 1900.

=== Literary career ===

His first book, &quot;Poems, Lyrical and Idyllic&quot;, appeared in 1860, followed by successive volumes of similar character, and by collected editions of his verse in 1873, 1884 and 1897. His longer poems are &quot;Alice of Monmouth: an Idyl of the Great War&quot; (1864); &quot;The Blameless Prince&quot; (1869), an allegory of good deeds, supposed to have been remotely suggested by the life of Prince Albert; and an elaborate commemorative ode on Nathaniel Hawthorne, read before the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1877.

An idyllic atmosphere is the prevalent characteristic of his longer pieces, while the lyric tone is never absent from his songs, ballads and poems of reflection or fancy. As an editor he put forth a volume of &quot;Cameos&quot; from Walter Savage Landor (with Thomas Bailey Aldrich, 1874); a large Library of (selections from) American Literature (with Ellen M Hutchinson, 11 vols, 1888–1890); a &quot;Victorian Anthology&quot; (1895); and an &quot;American Anthology, 1787–1899&quot; (1900); the two last-named volumes being ancillary to a detailed and comprehensive critical study in prose of the whole body of English poetry from 1837, and of American poetry of the 19th century.

This study appeared in separate chapters in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot; (which closed in 1881 and was relaunched the same year as the &quot;Century Magazine&quot;), and was reissued, with enlargements, in the volumes entitled &quot;Victorian Poets&quot; (1875; continued to the Jubilee year in the edition of 1887) and &quot;Poets of America&quot; (1885), the two works forming the most symmetrical body of literary criticism yet published in the United States. Their value is increased by the treatise on &quot;The Nature and Elements of Poetry&quot; (Boston, 1892) a work of great critical insight as well as technical knowledge.

Stedman edited, with Ellen M. Hutchinson, &quot;A Library of American Literature&quot; (eleven volumes, 1888–90); and, with George E. Woodberry, the &quot;Works of Edgar Allan Poe&quot; (ten volumes, 1895). After the death of James Russell Lowell, Stedman had perhaps the leading place among American poets and critics. In 1876, he was one of several poets who were gently mocked by Bayard Taylor in his verse parody &quot;The Echo Club and Other Literary Diversions&quot;.

In 1904, Edmund Clarence Stedman was one of the first seven chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

=== Scientific career ===

In addition to his literary achievements, Stedman pursued scientific and technical endeavors. In 1879, he proposed a rigid airship inspired by the anatomy of a fish, with a framework of steel, brass, or copper tubing and a tractor propeller mounted on the craft″s bow, later changed to an engine with two propellers suspended beneath the framework. The airship never was built, but its design foreshadowed that of the dirigibles of the early decades of the 20th century.

== Personal life ==

<text>Sky Real Lives was an in-house channel from British Sky Broadcasting that showed extensive programmes about travel, adverts for travel agencies and documentaries. The channels closed on 19 August 2010.

==History==
Sky Real Lives first launched as Sky Travel on 3 October 1994, and became part of the Sky Multichannels package. It originally broadcast between Monday and Thursday between midday and midnight and on Friday between 12pm and 6pm until September 1997. In 2001, the channel started broadcasting 7 days a week from 6am until 11pm.

The channel was revamped in September 2002. Sky Travel launched with Freeview on 30 October 2002, along with Sky News and Sky Sports News. In February 2003, a spin-off of the channels, Sky Travel Shop, launched a dedicated travel retail channel in the Specialist, then Shopping section of the electronic program guide (EPG). In September 2003 both channels were launched on the NTL platform. With increased distribution, Sky Travel changed its programming strategy to attract a wider audience, skewing towards stronger entertainment programs with a travel theme, particularly reality shows. 
By August 2004, the core channel was broadcasting 24 hours a day and in January 2005, a timeshifted version of Sky Travel was launched.

In October 2005, Sky Travel on Freeview was replaced by Sky Three and on 6 March 2006, the Sky Travel channels were moved from the &quot;Entertainment&quot; section on the Sky EPG, to the &quot;Lifestyle and Culture&quot; section.

In August 2006, Sky Travel began showing reality TV, whilst Sky Travel Extra dedicated its airtime to documentaries

Sky Real Lives 2, the replacement channel for Sky Travel Extra, gained additional broadcast hours from its launch.

From 2002 until 2007, Sky Real Lives 2 only aired from 6am until 1am. However, on 7 November, the channel began 24-hour broadcasts.

Sky Real Lives programmes were showcased on Sky&#x27;s main channels; Sky1, Sky2, but mostly on its free-to-air sister channel, Sky3 (now known as Sky Mix).

==Changes on Freeview==
In 2004, Sky Travel showed the first two episodes of the fourth season of US drama &quot;24&quot;, simulcasting with Sky&#x27;s primary channel, Sky One. This led to rumours that the company had planned to turn Sky Travel into a general entertainment channel on Freeview. However, British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB)&#x27;s CEO, James Murdoch, had repeatedly denied the company had any plans to launch any new free-to-air services.

BSkyB&#x27;s stance on the subject has since changed. On 22 September 2005, it was announced that Sky Travel would be replaced on Freeview by new entertainment channel Sky Three. Although some of Sky Travel&#x27;s programming will form part of the schedule of Sky Three, Sky Travel itself will still be shown on Sky Digital. Sky Travel ceased to be broadcast on Freeview at 5pm on 31 October 2005.

==Sky Travel relaunches as Sky Real Lives==
On 17 September 2007, Sky announced plans to rebrand Sky Travel to Sky Real Lives from 7 November 2007. The new channel focused on programmes with a human interest story and was targeted more at women in the 35–54 age range.

Sky&#x27;s managing director of entertainment Sophie Turner Laing said it seems that the channel would be given a &quot;whole new makeover&quot; that would make it more entertainment oriented. On 7 November, the following channels were changed:

Sky Travel was renamed as Sky Real Lives, Sky Travel +1 was renamed Sky Real Lives +1, Sky Travel Extra renamed to Sky Real Lives 2, and Sky Travel Shop was also renamed to Sky Travel. Sky Real Lives, Sky Real Lives 2, Sky Arts 1 and Sky Arts 2 were launched on UPC Ireland, before being removed on 8 December 2008.

==Closure==
On 16 June 2010, it was announced that Sky Real Lives, and its portfolio of channels would close on 19 August 2010, with the channels budget shifting to Sky1 and Sky2.
Sky Real Lives closed at midnight on 19 August 2010.

<text>The Hits was a music video channel broadcast in the United Kingdom and Ireland, owned by Box Television. On 15 August 2008 it was rebranded as 4Music.

==Overview and availability==
The channel showcased a range of pop centred on chart hits and current favourites. Originally, the vast majority of music videos were selected by viewers by means of calling a premium-rate telephone number, however the policy was abandoned with the channel playing an automated selection of videos and countdown shows presented by celebrities and singers past and present. Programming was often themed to coincide with events such as St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and Christmas.

The channel was available free-to-air on the British digital terrestrial television service Freeview on channel 18. It was also available on Sky Digital, encrypted as a part of Sky&#x27;s Music Pack. The Hits was also available on Virgin Media and was included in the basic package. It was also able to be seen through the British Forces Broadcasting Service.

==Programmes on The Hits==
87-07 was a series of programmes where a song was played from each of the years from 1987 to 2007. There was a more up to date version called 88-08 which went from 1988 to 2008. There were different collections of songs depending on different things that the songs had in common, an example of 87-07 is Cheesy Pop 87-07 which includes the songs &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; by Rick Astley, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; by Whigfield and &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot; by B*Witched which are all commonly regarded as &quot;cheesy pop songs&quot;.

Another type of programme on The Hits was where one hundred songs are played, usually counting down to a song that was featured as &quot;number one&quot;. This varies from &quot;100 Forgotten Gems of the Nineties&quot; to &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Love Songs&quot;. Similarly formatted programmes with fifty or twenty songs were also broadcast.

&quot;The Hits Chart&quot; was played at around 12.15 and 17:15 Monday-Friday. The Hits Chart was simply a countdown of the biggest songs of the day.

The Hits had a programme called &quot;Every Number One of the Nineties&quot; which, as the title suggests, played every number one of the nineties back to back. It was played over a bank holiday weekend in two parts, the first part on the Sunday and the second part on the Monday. &quot;Every Number One of the Nineties&quot; has been played on 4Music in small segments. A similar programme was &quot;Every Number One of the Twenty-first Century&quot;.

Early in the morning, there was a programme called &quot;Signed by The Hits&quot;. This programme&#x27;s duration was usually 30 minutes. The programme involved a sign language interpreter signing to the songs on screen to help deaf people understand the music. Due to persistent criticism, the show was removed.

==Replacement with 4Music==

On 20 February 2008, it was announced that The Hits would change its name to 4Music later in the year, and a trial period broadcast on Sundays under the 4Music banner was broadcast on Sunday evenings during the spring. In June 2008 it was further announced that this replacement was to take place during the V Festival weekend on 15 August. The replaced station shows predominantly music videos, alongside live performances and Channel 4 programming like &quot;Star Stories&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Night Project&quot;, in addition to documentaries about artists.

In the weeks before the launch, 4Music aired teaser trailers for the channel as part of its extensive promotion of the rebrand and as part of the promotion one of the three stages for &quot;T4 On The Beach&quot; was named the 4Music stage.

The Hits stopped broadcasting music videos on Friday 15 August 2008 at 06:00. The last video played on The Hits was &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; by ABBA, before heading in to a promo for 4Music, which would be launched from 19:00.

==Ofcom controversy==
In November 2007, Ofcom found The Hits had breached its broadcast licence for failing to retain copies of its programming. Two viewers had complained questioning the authenticity of some of the winning entries on text-in quiz programme &quot;Win Win TV&quot;, broadcast overnight on 26 June.

The broadcaster was unable to provide Ofcom with a review copy of the programme in question because of &quot;problems with its logging system&quot;. Condition 11 of a Television Licensable Content Service licence requires the broadcaster to keep recordings of all output for 60 days after transmission, providing Ofcom with any material on request.

&quot;Failure to supply these recordings is a serious and significant breach of the broadcaster’s licence. This will be held on record,&quot; the regulator noted.

==The Hits Radio==

In 2003, companion radio station The Hits Radio was launched. It ceased broadcasting on 4 June 2018.

<text>Miron Cristea (; monastic name of Elie Cristea ; 20 July 1868 – 6 March 1939) was a Romanian cleric and politician.

A bishop in Hungarian-ruled Transylvania, Cristea was elected Metropolitan-Primate of the Orthodox Church of the newly unified Greater Romania in 1919. As the Church was raised to a rank of Patriarchate, Miron Cristea was enthroned as the first Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church in 1925.

In 1938, after Carol II banned political parties and established a royal dictatorship, he chose Cristea to be Prime Minister of Romania, a position in which he served for about a year (between 11 February 1938 and his death on 6 March 1939).

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Born in Toplița to Gheorghe and Domnița Cristea, a peasant family, he studied at the Saxon Evangelical Gymnasium of Bistrița (1879–1883), at the Greek-Catholic Lyceum of Năsăud (1883–1887), at the Orthodox Seminary of Sibiu (1887–1890), after which he became a teacher and principal at the Romanian Orthodox school of Orăștie (1890–1891).

Cristea then studied philosophy and modern philology at the University of Budapest (1891–1895), where he was awarded a doctorate in 1895 – with a dissertation about the life and works of Mihai Eminescu (given in Hungarian).

Returning to Transylvania, he was a secretary (between 1895 and 1902), then a counselor (1902–1909) at the Archbishopric of Sibiu. It was then that he was ordained deacon in 1900 and archdeacon in 1901. Cristea became a monk at the Hodoș Bodrog Monastery, Arad County in 1902, taking the monastic name of Miron. He climbed the monastery hierarchy, becoming an archmonk in 1903 and a protosingel in 1908.

In 1908, following the death of bishop Nicolae Popea, the election of the bishop of Caransebeș led to a dispute between the Romanian Orthodox Church and the Imperial authorities, when, twice in a row, the elected bishops were not recognized by emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, at the recommendation of the Hungarian government. Cristea was the third choice, being chosen on 21 November 1910, and obtaining the recognition from the authorities; he became an archbishop in 1919.

During World War I, as Romania joined the war on the Allies&#x27; side, Cristea signed on 1 September 1916, a public letter to the parishioners printed at Oradea by the Orthodox Bishopric of Transylvania. The letter called to arms all believers against &quot;Romania the new enemy which sinfully covets to ruin the borders, coming to conquer Transylvania&quot;.
Towards the end of World War I, on 18 October 1918, the Central National Romanian Central Council was formed, an organization which fought for the union of Transylvania and Romania. On 21 November, Cristea, as archbishop of Caransebeș joined the organization and recognized it as the only ruling body of the Romanian nation in Transylvania. On 1 December, he was (with Vasile Goldiș, Iuliu Hossu, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod) a member of Austro-Hungarian Romanian delegation that called for the unification of Romania and Transylvania.

On 28 May 1919, the King and government of Romania went to the grave of Michael the Brave in Câmpia Turzii and Bishop Cristea lead the religious service of commemoration and held a nationalist speech in which he drew a parallel between King Ferdinand I and Michael the Brave and recommended the King to not stop at Turda, but continuing all the way to the Tisa River.

=== Metropolitan-Primate and Patriarch ===
Because of his collaboration with the German occupation troops, the Metropolitan-Primate Conon Arămescu-Donici was forced to resign on 1 December 1919 and on 31 December 1919, Cristea was chosen by the Great Electoral College as the first Metropolitan-Primate of Greater Romania with 435 votes out of 447. The Romanian Orthodox Church was elevated to a patriarchate in 1925. On 1 November 1925, after a Synod was held, Cristea was named Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church.

As Metropolitan-Primate and later Patriarch, Cristea continued the tradition of his predecessors to support whatever government was in power. The church acted as an agency of the state, for instance, in 1920, Cristea asked the clergymen to aid the state financially by encouraging the faithful to buy government bonds. Cristea&#x27;s discourse incorporated nationalist and statist elements, arguing that Orthodox religion was integral to the Romanian soul, and he argued that the church&#x27;s values include &quot;patriotism&quot; and &quot;obedience to [civil] authorities&quot; alongside &quot;faith and morality&quot;.

Cristea introduced reforms such as the Gregorian calendar to the church, including, briefly, the celebration of Pascha (Easter) on the same date as the Roman Catholic Church. This was opposed by various groups of traditionalists and Old Calendarists, especially in Moldavia, where Metropolitan Gurie Grosu of Bessarabia refused to accept the orders given by the Patriarchate.
In 1927, he was chosen by Ionel Brătianu to be one of the three regents of King Michael I of Romania, alongside Prince Nicholas of Romania and Gheorghe Buzdugan.

Cristea&#x27;s involvement in politics was, however, controversial, being criticised by journalists at &quot;Epoca&quot; newspaper, who accused him of trying to play the role of Rasputin and being a member of the palace camarilla. This resulted in the issue being confiscated by the police, and &quot;Epoca&quot; offices being vandalized by hooligans, allegedly incited by the government.

A dispute arose with philosopher Nae Ionescu after Ionescu attacked Cristea for hypocrisy in newspaper articles following a lavish dinner with Cristea during the Nativity Fast at which they were served, amongst other things, turkey. In retaliation, Cristea requested that the iconographer Belizarie paint Ionescu&#x27;s face on a figure of the devil in the Patriarchal Cathedral in Bucharest&#x27;s Apocalypse-themed mural.

In 1929, because of a serious illness (identified as leucocythemia by his medics), Cristea retired for several months to a country house in Dragoslavele, Muscel County, but despite the bleak predictions about his health state, he was soon able to return to Bucharest.

On 6 July 1930, Carol II returned to Romania to assume power. On 7 July, Miron Cristea and Constantin Sărățeanu resigned from the regency and the following day, the Parliament revoked the 1926 law which gave the throne to Mihai, Carol becoming King again.

Cristea kept his loyalty to King Carol II throughout his rule. In March 1937, as the King attempted to suppress the influence of the fascist movement known as the Iron Guard, Cristea responded to the request sent by the Tătărescu government on limiting the relationship between the clergy and the Iron Guard. Cristea invoked a Holy Synod which banned clergy from joining the Legion and disallowed political demonstrations and symbols in the churches.

===Prime Minister of Romania===
In a bid for political unity against the Iron Guard, which was gaining popularity, on 10 February 1938, Carol dismissed the government of Prime Minister Octavian Goga and seized emergency powers. He suspended the constitution, suspended all political activity, and ruled by decree. Cristea was named Prime Minister on 11 February 1938. He headed a government that included seven former prime ministers and members of all major parties except for Codreanu&#x27;s Iron Guard and Goga&#x27;s Lăncieri, which had violently clashed. &quot;Time&quot; magazine described him as a &quot;puppet Premier&quot; of Carol II, whereas historian Joseph Rothschild considered that it was Cristea&#x27;s vice-prime-minister, Armand Călinescu, who held the power in the Cristea government.

In his inaugural speech, Cristea denounced liberal pluralism, arguing that &quot;the monster with 29 electoral heads was destroyed&quot; (referring to the 29 political parties which were to be banned) and claiming that the king shall bring salvation.

The new government stopped the antisemitic violence that was unleashed under Goga&#x27;s rule, but the antisemitic legislation in place was not altered, as Nichifor Crainic&#x27;s racist, fascist ideology fit comfortably with the social views and political theology of the Romanian Orthodox Church.

At Carol&#x27;s direction, Cristea&#x27;s government declared state of siege, which allowed among other things, searches without warrant and the military appropriation of privately held guns. He also imposed harsh press censorship and restored the death penalty. However, Cristea promised prosperity through some constitutional and social reforms, which were to include the &quot;organized emigration of Jewish surplus population&quot;, that is, expulsion of all Jews who came to Romania during or after World War I. However, it eased the antisemitic restrictions imposed by the Goga government.

The external politics of the Cristea government were based on seeking an alliance with the United Kingdom and France, away from the friendship with the Berlin-Rome Axis supported by the Goga government. Cristea also visited Poland, with which Romania had an alliance and with which it tried to create a neutral block between Nazi Germany and the USSR.

Among the policies Cristea introduced during his rule as Prime Minister was a crackdown on the Protestant minority, by disallowing religious service to small congregations with less than 100 heads of families, basically banning the services in around 1500 small chapels belonging to various non-Orthodox Christian denominations. Despite worldwide protests from the Baptists, the ban was only lifted after Cristea&#x27;s death by his successor, the National Renaissance Front&#x27;s Armand Călinescu.

On 20 February, a new constitution was announced, which organized Romania as a &quot;corporatist state&quot; similar to the one of Fascist Italy, with a parliament made up of representatives of the guilds of farmers, workers and intellectuals. Four days later, on 24 February, the constitution was approved, with 99.87% of votes for, through a plebiscite, described by a contemporary article in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; as a &quot;farse&quot; for its lack of vote secrecy and the lack of information given to rural voters .

Upon the approval of the new constitution, Cristea&#x27;s government resigned on 30 March. He formed a new government later that day. The new government banned all political parties, their activity being only suspended before that.

In March 1938, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, attacked in a letter the politicians who supported Carol II, including Prime Minister Cristea and members of his government. Codreanu was arrested for slander against Nicolae Iorga and killed &quot;while attempting to escape&quot;.

By the end of 1938, Carol II introduced even more Fascist-inspired elements. In December 1938, the National Renaissance Front was formed as the only legally permitted party. On 1 January 1939; Cristea&#x27;s government visited the Royal Palace wearing uniforms. When they met Carol, Cristea and the ministers greeted him with the Fascist salute.

===Deteriorating health and death===
His health deteriorated in January 1939, suffering from two heart attacks, which prompted his doctors to recommend him to stay in a warmer place for a few months, in order to avoid the harsher Romanian winter. In response, on 1 February 1939, Călinescu took over most of Cristea&#x27;s powers, while Cristea remained nominally the Prime Minister at the King&#x27;s insistence.

On 24 February 1939, Cristea arrived in Cannes, France, but contracted pneumonia while waiting for his niece in the Nice railway station. He stayed in Cannes for treatment, but died two weeks later, on 6 March, of bronchopneumonia complicated by heart disease.

His body was sent by train to Bucharest, the funeral train stopping in all stations in Romania to permit believers to pay their last respects and say prayers before the body. On 7 March, a state of national mourning was ordered and all festivities were canceled. A week later, on 14 March, funeral services were held in Bucharest, Cristea being buried in the Patriarchal Cathedral.

==Political positions and policies==
Cristea&#x27;s political positions were nationalistic, seeing for Romania external threats from both the east, in the form of communism and the Soviet Union and from the capitalist and modernist west.

===Toward other Christian denominations===
As he became the head of the Orthodox Church in Greater Romania, a multiethnic and multireligious state, Cristea feared that the ethnic minorities, as well as Romanians belonging to non-Orthodox creeds such as the Greek-Catholicism and the Jews would challenge the privileged status which the Orthodox Church had in pre-World War I Romania.

Nevertheless, Cristea attempted an ecumenical close-up with the Anglican Church, by visiting Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1936.

Cristea strongly opposed the idea of a Concordat with the Vatican and the Romanian Orthodox Church issued a statement against it saying that &quot;the treaty subordinates the interests of the country and the sovereignty of the state to a foreign power&quot;. The Romanian Senate ratified it anyway on 26 May 1929, and Cristea, as a member of the regency, was forced to sign it. This has led again to discussions about the incompatibility between his two posts and there were discussions on whether Cristea would have resigned rather than sign the Concordat.

After Cristea introduced reforms such as switching to the Gregorian calendar, the Old Calendar Romanian Orthodox Church, led by Glicherie Tănase seceded many parishes from the Orthodox Church and by 1936 they had built more than 40 churches. However, after 1935, the Romanian government began to suppress any opposition to the Orthodox Church and the churches were razed and some of the activists the imprisoned, while a number of clerics, including hieromonk Pambo and five monks from the Old Calendarist Cucova Monastery, were beaten to death. Protests against the authorities&#x27; actions were met with repression by police and the leader of Old Calendarists, Tănase, was accused of being an instigator and sentenced to death.

In 1937, William Temple, the Archbishop of York, sent a letter to Cristea in which he questioned religious freedom in Romania, referring especially to the treatment of the Baptists. Cristea denied such claims and responded in a long document in which he said Temple was misled by the &quot;perverse propaganda&quot; and the &quot;false mystification&quot; of the Magyars, as well as the &quot;ferocious and barbaric proselytism of the Pope&quot;. He further added, referring to neo-Protestants, that Romania should not allow to be &quot;undermined by foreigners dressed in innocent pseudo-religious garb&quot;.

===Toward the Jews===
Early during his tenure as Patriarch, Cristea supported tolerance towards the Jewish people. For instance, in 1928, he made an appeal towards the Romanian students to observe the Golden Rule and he expressed regrets for attacks and profanations of synagogues.

In the 1930s, as the Fascist Iron Guard rose in popularity, initially, Cristea&#x27;s position towards them was of acceptance, especially since their program included loyalty to Orthodoxism. Many Orthodox priests were attracted by the movement and it was common that their banners were blessed in churches.

In 1937, Cristea realized that the Iron Guard was decreasing the loyalty of both the Orthodox Christians and the lower-ranked clergy to the church hierarchy and began to oppose the Guard, while adopting their antisemitic and xenophobic rhetoric: he supported the revocation of the Romanian citizenship for Jewish people and their deportation, the Jews being in his opinion the major obstacle in &quot;assuring preponderant rights to ethnic Romanians&quot;.

On 18 August 1937, he issued a statement which called the Romanian nation &quot;to fight the Jewish parasites&quot; who spread &quot;epidemics of corruption&quot; throughout Romania and that the Romanians have &quot;a national and patriotic duty&quot; to protect themselves against the Jews:

In 1938, during a meeting with Wilhelm Fabricius, the German ambassador, Cristea praised the antisemitic policy conducted by Nazi Germany and supporting such a policy in Romania, and the British Ambassador wrote in his report to London that &quot;Nothing would induce him [i.e., Cristea] to talk about anything but the Jewish problem.&quot;

==Legacy==

His birthplace home in Toplița is currently a museum dedicated to his life. Each year, on Cristea&#x27;s birthday, the Romanian Orthodox Patriarchate organizes the &quot;Miron Cristea Days&quot;, dedicated to the first patriarch of the Church and which feature various cultural activities.

In July 2010, the National Bank of Romania minted a commemorative coin bearing Cristea&#x27;s image as a part of a collectors&#x27; series of five coins showing the Patriarchs of All Romania. In response, Radu Ioanid, international archives director at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, called for the coin be withdrawn. On 20 August, the National Bank of Romania announced that it would not withdraw the Cristea coin.

Patriarch Miron was awarded Order of Karađorđe&#x27;s Star by Serbia.

<text>Edward Robert Vrdolyak (; born December 28, 1937), also known as &quot;Fast Eddie&quot;, is a former American politician and lawyer. He was a longtime Chicago alderman and the head of the Cook County Democratic Party until 1987 when he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Chicago on the Illinois Solidarity Party ticket. He subsequently ran again in 1989 on the Republican Party ticket. He was a prominent opponent of Harold Washington and the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the so-called &quot;Vrdolyak 29&quot; that opposed and blocked many of Washington&#x27;s measures.

After his electoral career ended, he resumed his law practice at The Vrdolyak Law Group. It consists of 20 attorneys. Vrdolyak&#x27;s three sons are partners in the firm.

==Early life and family==
Vrdolyak, born to Croatian immigrant parents, entered a Catholic seminary at age 13, but decided against joining the priesthood. He graduated from Mount Carmel High School in Chicago, then from St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Rensselaer, Indiana. He received his J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1963 and began a legal career in private practice, specializing in personal injury cases.

Vrdolyak&#x27;s brother, Victor Vrdolyak (1933-1992), would also serve as a Chicago alderman (being elected in 1987 to succeed Edward on the city council).

==Political career==
In 1968, he was elected as Democratic committeeman from Chicago&#x27;s 10th ward in the Hegewisch and South Deering areas; a position he held until 1988. In 1971, he was elected alderman, and, after defeating Republican Melvin Simonovich, he served as President of the City Council from 1977 to 1983. Vrdolyak earned the nickname &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; because of his skill in back-room deal-making. In 1979, he managed the re-election campaign of Mayor Michael Bilandic. In a colossal upset, Bilandic narrowly lost to maverick Jane Byrne. Despite the fact that Byrne then stripped Vrdolyak of all powers except his aldermanic seat, he became Byrne&#x27;s chief ally against both independent and Regular Democrats, becoming her floor leader in the Council. In 1982, with Byrne&#x27;s support, he was elected Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Committee, ousting County Board President George Dunne.

He is most noted for leading the opposition in the City Council to Mayor Harold Washington from 1983 to 1987. After beating Mayor Byrne and Richard M. Daley in the Democratic Primary, Washington won the general election by 47,549 votes. A solid majority of 29 aldermen (27 Regular Democrats and two independents) opposed Washington (21 aldermen supported the mayor). Vrdolyak and 14th Ward Alderman Ed Burke led the opposition group. The Vrdolyak 29 rejected mayoral appointments and appropriations, but could not override the mayor&#x27;s veto. The resulting political deadlock was labeled &quot;Council Wars&quot;.

In 1986, a federal lawsuit forced the redrawing of some aldermanic wards, and special elections in some, but not all, of the redrawn wards. Members of the Vrdolyak 29 were incumbents in all seven of the wards going to the polls. Four of them did not seek reelection, including three who sought seats on the county board. Two of the three attempting to retain their seats were reelected in the first round, but a third, Alderman Brady, lost six weeks later in a run-off; the council was split 25-25, creating a tie which the mayor could break. At this point, several of the Vrdolyak 29 began to support Washington, giving him a supportive council. In 1987, Vrdolyak resigned as county Democratic chairman, and ran for mayor as the Solidarity Party nominee, defeating a candidate backed by Washington in the primary. He was defeated by Washington, who got 53% of the vote to Vrdolyak&#x27;s 42%.

Washington&#x27;s second term began more smoothly, but he unexpectedly died in November 1987 and Vrdolyak&#x27;s political clout waned. In light of these factors, as well as his growing unpopularity among Democrats, Vrdolyak joined the Republican Party in September 1987. In 1988, Vrdolyak was the Republican nominee for Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County. He received 41% of the vote; Democrat Aurelia Pucinski (daughter of Alderman and former US Representative Roman Pucinski) won with 59%. In 1989, Vrdolyak again ran for mayor, in a special election for the last half of Washington&#x27;s term; he won the Republican primary as a write-in candidate. The general election was won by Democrat Richard M. Daley. Vrdolyak managed less than 4% of the vote, effectively ending his political career.

After his final electoral defeat, Vrdolyak returned to his law practice. He hosted a popular talk radio show from 1993 to 1996, first on WLS radio (890 AM) and then on WJJD Radio (1160 AM). He also maintained a strong behind-the-scenes presence in Chicago area politics. He became best known for his influence in the appointment and election of Cook County Circuit Court judges. Illinois Supreme Court Justice Charles Freeman confirmed that at least two judges he appointed to the bench were recommended by Vrdolyak. This would cause problems for Vrdolyak as he was implicated in the case of former Cook County Circuit Court Judge George J.W. Smith, who pled guilty to federal charges of illegally structuring cash withdrawals to avoid tax penalties. Prosecutors claimed the transactions were in furtherance of an alleged bribe paid to a &quot;go-between&quot; in order to secure Smith&#x27;s appointment. Smith was reportedly appointed by Freeman based on Vrdolyak&#x27;s recommendation, leading to speculation that Vrdolyak was the alleged &quot;go-between&quot;. The investigation did not result in charges of wrongdoing against Vrdolyak, nor in bribery charges against Smith or any other party.

Vrdolyak was also a key adviser to Betty Loren-Maltese, former Town President of the Chicago suburb of Cicero. The Vrdolyak Law Group received millions of dollars in legal work from the town during the administrations of Loren-Maltese and her successor, Ramiro González. Maltese was convicted of corruption in 2002 and González was defeated in the 2005 election. While Vrdolyak was not charged in the Loren-Maltese investigation, his close alliance with the once-imprisoned former Town President was a major issue in the 2005 election. During the campaign, Dominick criticized what he called Vrdolyak&#x27;s excessive legal bills, and removed Vrdolyak&#x27;s firm as the town&#x27;s legal counsel after taking office. However, NBC Chicago reported that the new town attorney, Michael Del Galdo, billed the town over $2 million in 2006—more than twice the average billings when Vrdolyak&#x27;s firm held the contract.

In 2005, Vrdolyak agreed to a 30-day suspension of his law license for allegedly double-billing clients he represented in sexual harassment cases.

==Federal indictments and convictions==
On May 10, 2007, Vrdolyak was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of bribery, mail fraud and wire fraud. Prosecutors later added additional wire fraud charges, and the final indictment included a total of eight counts. The case centered on property that was sold by the Chicago Medical School. The key witness against Vrdolyak was to be Stuart Levine, a partner in the alleged scheme. Prosecutors charged that Vrdolyak and Levine devised a scheme to use Levine&#x27;s position on the school&#x27;s board to steer the $15 million sale of a school building to Smithfield Properties - a developer with ties to Vrdolyak. It was alleged that the two arranged a $1.5 million kickback from Smithfield to Vrdolyak in return for Levine&#x27;s support.

Levine, a close friend and political ally of Vrdolyak, was indicted in 2005 for using his positions on the Illinois Teachers Retirement System board and the Illinois Health Facilities board to obtain kickbacks. Levine pleaded guilty in late 2006 and agreed to testify in several corruption cases as a condition of his plea agreement. Prosecutors dropped 22 felony charges in return for his cooperation. Prosecutors have indicated that Levine wore a recording device while discussing some of the alleged schemes. Political insiders expressed surprise at the idea that Vrdolyak would be caught on tape. A long-time power broker and target of investigations, the notoriously careful Vrdolyak has been quoted as saying that he &quot;talk[s] to everyone like they&#x27;re wearing a wire, even my wife&quot;. Chicago alderman Bernard Stone noted that Vrdolyak was always careful when talking on the phone, once telling Stone to &quot;always talk like the government was on the phone with you&quot;.

Vrdolyak initially pleaded not guilty to all charges. Vrdolyak&#x27;s attorney, Michael Monico, questioned Levine&#x27;s &quot;credibility, reliability and truthfulness&quot;, noting that he agreed to testify under &quot;immense pressure&quot; from prosecutors. Levine also testified at the 2008 trial of Tony Rezko, another powerbroker in Illinois politics. He told the jury that he funneled payoffs for clients who wanted Chicago city contracts through Vrdolyak, including some alleged schemes for which Vrdolyak has not been charged. Monico called Levine&#x27;s statements in regards to Vrdolyak &quot;absolutely false&quot; and said that he had never heard them before.

The trial was set for November 3, 2008. That day, however, an agreement was reached in which prosecutors dropped several of the charges and Vrdolyak pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. The plea agreement stated that Vrdolyak was not cooperating with other investigations, and prosecutors recommended a sentence of 41 months in prison. However, on February 26, 2009, United States District Judge Milton I. Shadur sentenced Vrdolyak to five years of probation, a $50,000 fine and 2,500 hours of community service. On January 29, 2010, a federal appeals court overturned the probation sentence on appeal by the prosecution and ordered a resentencing by a different judge. On October 15, 2010 Vrdolyak was sentenced to 10 months in prison. Vrdolyak served his sentence at the federal prison camp in Terre Haute, Indiana. He was released from prison on November 17, 2011.

On November 15, 2016, Vrdolyak was indicted for income tax evasion. He pled guilty on March 4, 2019. Vrdolyak was sentenced to eighteen months in prison for the scheme. Judge Robert Michael Dow Jr. ordered Vrdolyak to report to FMC Rochester by November 30, 2021 to complete his eighteen month sentence. In January 2022, his attorneys filed an emergency petition requesting his release for time served due to the health risks posed by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. In April 2022, after serving five months in the Rochester federal prison, Vrdolyak was transferred to a halfway house. On March 9, 2023, Vrdolyak was released from the halfway house

<text>Ernst Goldenbaum (15 December 1898, Parchim – 13 March 1990, East Berlin) was a German politician who served as the chairman of the Democratic Farmers&#x27; Party of Germany from 1948 to 1982.

==Biography==

Goldenbaum was born in Parchim, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. During World War I, he served in the Imperial German Army and he participated in the German November Revolution. In 1919, he joined the left-wing USPD and a few years later the Communist Party of Germany.

From 1923 to 1925, he was a member of the city council of Parchim, and from 1924 to 1932 he was a member of the Landtag of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. From 1932 to 1933, he was the editor of &quot;Volkswacht&quot;, a communist newspaper. After the Nazis seized power, he became a farmer and a member of the German resistance.

In 1944, he was arrested and he spent the last year of the war in Neuengamme concentration camp. In 1945, he was one of very few who survived the sinking of the SS &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; which claimed over 4000 lives.

After the war, he joined the Socialist Unity Party (SED), but in 1948, he co-founded the communist-sponsored Democratic Farmers&#x27; Party of Germany (DBD). The DBD was a close ally of the SED as a bloc party or a satellite party. Until 1982, Goldenbaum was the chairman of the party.

From 1949 to 1990 Goldenbaum was a member of the People&#x27;s Chamber (Volkskammer). From 1949 to 1950, Goldenbaum was East Germany&#x27;s first Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. Goldenbaum supported the SED&#x27;s collectivisation in the 1950s and 1960s. From 1950 to 1963, he was the deputy chairman of the People&#x27;s Chamber. After 1963, he was a member of the Presidium of the People&#x27;s Chamber.

<doc id="1215169" wikidata="Q3433485" url="?curid=1215169" title="River East">
<text>River East was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was officially created by redistribution in 1979, and formally existed since the provincial election of 1981 until 2019.

The riding was located on the northeast corner of the City of Winnipeg, bordered by the Red River to the west, the city limit, by Springfield to the north and east, and by the riding of Rossmere to the south.

It was replaced for the 2019 election by the new Kildonan-River East district.

River East was an affluent district with an average income of $62,534 and an unemployment rate of 5.60% in 1999. It also had a large immigrant population, at 17% of the total population. Twelve per cent of River East&#x27;s residents listed German as their ethnic origin, while a further 9% listed Ukrainian. The riding&#x27;s total population in 1996 was 19,840.

== History ==

River East was the only riding in the northern part of Winnipeg to be represented by a Progressive Conservative up until the 2016 general election. Bonnie Mitchelson was the Member of the Legislative Assembly for the area from 1986 to 2016, and was re-elected five times. Bonnie Mitchelson announced her retirement in October, 2014, and did not seek re-election in the 2016 general election. The seat was won by Cathy Cox, who held it for the Progressive Conservatives while defeating NDP challenger Jody Gillis. Once considered safe for the Progressive Conservatives, the seat became extremely marginal, with Mitchelson being re-elected in the 2007 provincial election by only 52 votes over the New Democrat candidate. Since then, the PC majorities have increased in 2011 and 2016.

<doc id="1215174" wikidata="Q1137522" url="?curid=1215174" title="Gonzo (company)">
<text>(formerly GDH K.K.) is a Japanese anime studio owned by ADK that was established on February 22, 2000. Gonzo is a member of The Association of Japanese Animations. The company&#x27;s predecessor Gonzo Inc. was established on February 11, 1992, by former Gainax staff members, but was later absorbed into its parent company, GDH K.K. on April 1, 2009, and it would assume the Gonzo trade name for itself.

Gonzo has not released a major animation project since 2020, with &quot;Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle&quot; being the studio&#x27;s latest major work; the company has been focusing on the NFT market with its projects &quot;Samurai Cryptos&quot; and &quot;Samurai Religion,&quot; as well as co-distributing the animated film &quot;They Shot the Piano Player&quot; in Japan.

==History==

*September 1992: Gonzo Inc. established by former Gainax members.
*May 1996: Digimation K.K. established.
*May 1999: Gonzo Inc. changed its company name to Gonzo K.K.
*February 2000: GDH established.
*May 2000: Creators.com K.K. established.
*April 2002: Gonzo K.K. and Digimation K.K. merge; the combined company is renamed Gonzo Digimation K.K.
*November 2003: Future Vision Music K.K. established.
*July 2004: Gonzo Digimation K.K. changed its company name to GONZO K.K.; Creators.com K.K. changed its name to G-creators K.K.; Gonzo Digimation Holding changed its company name to GDH K.K.
*July 2005: Gonzino K.K. established.
*September 2005: Warp Gate Online K.K. becomes subsidiary.
*December 2005: GDH Capital K.K. established and Warp Gate Online K.K. changed its company name to Gonzo Rosso Online K.K.
*February 2006: GK Entertainment established.
*April 2009: GDH K.K. merged with its subsidiary, Gonzo K.K., and changed its name to Gonzo K.K.
*June 2019: Gonzo transfers some of the properties to Studio Kai.
*November 2019: Okinawa Gonzo was dissolved.
*March 2020: It was revealed that the company planned to execute a reverse stock split. If approved, it would reduce the number of issued shares from 38,800 down to 24, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary of ADK in the process. After making Gonzo into an wholly owned subsidiary of ADK, it will transfer all of its shares in the company to Shinichiro Ishikawa.

==Financial issues==
The studio had a financial problem in their closing account in the 2008–2009 term and stated its deficit was estimated over US$30 million. The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that on July 30, 2009, Gonzo would be delisted from the exchange. This delisting is the conclusion of a notification made to investors in March 2008 that the studio&#x27;s financial liabilities exceeded its total financial assets. Since Gonzo was unable to reverse this, paperwork for delisting was filed at the end of June.

The studio is still able to operate, and its parent company GDH has absorbed it in an effort to consolidate management. The combined company now simply refers to itself as Gonzo. By April 2009, the merger was complete.

As part of the restructuring, GDH also sold the Gonzo Rosso game development subsidiary, GDH Capital financing subsidiary, and remaining shares of Tablier Communications initially acquired in March 2006. Gonzo Rosso K.K. was sold to Chushou service kikou kabushikigaisha (division of Incubator Bank of Japan, Limited) on March 31, 2009.

Since this deficit, Gonzo has started to post better earnings due to the release of titles such as &quot;Rosario + Vampire&quot; to western online streaming services such as Netflix. The marketing of these products to western audiences has returned Gonzo to financial stability, and Gonzo posted higher than expected profit margins in the April–September 2012 period.

ADV Films UK branch was the UK distributor for Gonzo titles licensed by ADV, with the exception of &quot;Gantz&quot;, as it was licensed by MVM Films. &quot;Gad Guard&quot;, &quot;Hellsing&quot;, and &quot;Last Exile&quot;, which were titles originally licensed by Geneon, were also licensed by ADV Films UK, although they&#x27;re no longer licensed since the company&#x27;s closure. MVM Films was the UK licensee for the majority of Gonzo titles licensed by Funimation in the US, with the exception of &quot;Afro Samurai&quot;, which was initially distributed directly in the UK by GDH and later by Manga Entertainment UK who also licensed &quot;Strike Witches&quot; (season 1), &quot;&quot;, and recently &quot;Last Exile&quot; and &quot;Hellsing&quot;. &quot;Welcome to the N.H.K.&quot;, &quot;Pumpkin Scissors&quot;, and &quot;Red Garden&quot;, which were originally licensed by ADV Films UK, were re-licensed by MVM Films.

In June 2006, it signed a long-term output deal with the anime television network, Animax, which saw Animax broadcasting all of Gonzo&#x27;s anime titles across all of its networks around the world, including Japan, Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Latin America and from November 2007 on Southern Africa&#x27;s DSTV satellite network. As of 2008 they decided to stream some of their airing anime on video sites such as: YouTube, Crunchyroll, and BOST.

<text>John Ross VC (c. 1822 – 23 October 1879) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Ross was about 33 years old, and serving as a corporal in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army, in the Crimean War, when he undertook the actions for which he later was awarded the VC.

On 21 July 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimean Peninsula, Corporal Ross went out at night in charge of a working party of 200 men each carrying an entrenching tool and a gabion, and before morning they had connected the 4th parallel right attack with an old Russian rifle-pit in front. On 23 August the corporal was in charge of the advance from the 5th parallel right attack on the Redan in placing and filling 25 gabions under a very heavy fire. Again, on 8 September he crept up to the Redan at night and returned to report its evacuation, bringing with him a wounded man.

In addition to the Victoria Cross, Ross was awarded the French Médaille militaire.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant.

He died in London on 23 October 1879, and was buried at St Pancras and Islington Cemetery.

==Victoria Cross medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Chatham, Kent.

<doc id="1215183" wikidata="Q1227402" url="?curid=1215183" title="PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Novel">
<text>The PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Fiction is awarded annually to a full-length novel or book of short stories by an American author who has not previously published a full-length book of fiction. The award is named after Ernest Hemingway and funded by the Hemingway family and the Ernest Hemingway Foundation/Society. It is administered by PEN America. Mary Welsh Hemingway, a member of PEN, founded the award in 1976 both to honor the memory of her husband and to recognize distinguished first books of fiction.

The winner is selected by a panel of three distinguished fiction writers and receives a cash prize of US$25,000. Along with the winner, two finalists and two runners-up receive a Ucross Residency Fellowship at the Ucross Foundation, a retreat for artists and writers on a 22,000 acre (89 km²) ranch on the high plains in Ucross, Wyoming. The award ceremony is held at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, Massachusetts.

The award presentation is sponsored in part by the JFK Presidential Library.

The award is one of many PEN awards sponsored by PEN International affiliates in over 145 PEN centres around the world.

<text>Montague Shadworth Seymour Moore VC (9 October 1896 – 12 September 1966) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born at 13 Montague Place, Worthing, Moore attended Bedford School from 1906 to 1913.

==Details==

He was 20 years old, and a Second Lieutenant in the 15th Bn., The Hampshire Regiment (later the Royal Hampshire Regiment), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 September 1917 near Tower Hamlets, east of Ypres, Belgium, Second Lieutenant Moore volunteered to make a fresh attack on a final objective and went forward with some 70 men, but they met such heavy opposition that when he arrived at his objective he had only one sergeant and four men. Nothing daunted he at once bombed a large dug-out, taking 28 prisoners, two machine-guns and a light field-gun. Gradually more officers and men arrived, numbering about 60 and he held the post for 36 hours beating off counter-attacks, until his force was reduced to 10 men. He eventually got away his wounded and withdrew under cover of thick mist.

He later achieved the rank of Major.

Lance Corp G Kenton of the Hampshire Regiment received the following citation from Major General Sydney Lawford, 41st Division: &quot;I wish to place on record my appreciation of your gallantry and devotion to duty on the 20th September 1917 when you were held up by an Enemy Strong Point you collected up your men and led them with great dash to the attack and captured the enemy Strong Point.&quot;

The citation was given for his actions on 20 September 1917 near Tower Hamlets, east of Ypres, Belgium, when he went forward with some 70 men, but met such heavy opposition that when he arrived at his objective only five men were left standing. Nothing daunted he led his men with great dash and captured the enemy strong point: a large dug-out, taking 28 prisoners, two machine-guns and a light field-gun. Gradually more officers and men arrived, numbering about 60 they held the post for 36 hours beating off counter-attacks, until the force was reduced to 10 men. They eventually got away with their wounded and withdrew under cover of thick mist. Sadly, Lance Corp G. Kenton didn&#x27;t receive a VC for his actions, as a working class lad of lowly rank he received a citation that his son kept in a tin beneath his bed – a cherished possession.

<text>Colonel William St. Lucien Chase VC CB (2 July 1856 – 24 June 1908) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

<doc id="1215212" wikidata="Q7527149" url="?curid=1215212" title="Sir Henry Havelock-Allan, 1st Baronet">
<text>Lieutenant General Sir Henry Marshman Havelock-Allan, 1st Baronet (6 August 1830 – 30 December 1897) was a British soldier and politician. &#x27;Allan&#x27; in the surname was added in March 1880.

==Early life==
Havelock was born in Cawnpore, India on 6 August 1830, the son of Major General Sir Henry Havelock and his wife, Hannah &quot;née&quot; Marshman, the daughter of the missionaries Joshua and Hannah Marshman.

==Military career==
Havelock was commissioned as an Ensign in the 39th Regiment of Foot in March 1846, and joined the Regiment in India. Moving to the 86th Foot as a Lieutenant in June 1848, he transferred to the 10th Regiment of Foot in February 1852. He served in the Persian campaign of 1856–57, and was back in India at the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in May 1857.

On 16 July 1857 at Cawnpore, the 64th Regiment had suffered badly under artillery fire. When the enemy was seen rallying their last 24-pounder, the order was given to advance, and Havelock immediately placed himself, on his horse, in front of the centre of the 64th, opposite the muzzle of the gun and moved on at a foot pace, in the face of shot and grape fired by the enemy. The advance went steadily on, led by Havelock and finally the gun was rushed and taken by the 64th. For this deed, Havelock was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 25 September 1857 he was badly wounded in the Siege of Lucknow.

On returning to England in 1860, Havelock joined his regiment, now the 18th Foot (Royal Irish Regiment), at Shorncliffe. He became deputy assistant adjutant-general at Aldershot on 1 October 1861. He was posted with the 18th Foot to New Zealand in August 1863, where he was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general and served under Major General Duncan Cameron from 1863 to 1864. He participated in the Invasion of Waikato, being present at Rangiriri, Waiari, Paterangi, Rangiaowhia, and at the siege and capture of Ōrākau. For his services during this period, he was mentioned in dispatches, promoted to major on 28 June 1864, and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in August 1866.

In March 1867 Havelock was posted to Canada, where he served as assistant quartermaster-general for two years. He then spent three years in Dublin performing the same role. In 1870 he was given leave of absence to act as a War correspondent in the Franco-Prussian War, being present at the Battle of Sedan. In 1877, he attended the Russo-Turkish War in the same capacity. He was promoted to colonel on 17 June 1868, and major general on 18 March 1878.

Ill health forced Havelock to retire from the active list on 9 December 1881, with the honorary rank of lieutenant general. However, when the Anglo-Egyptian War broke out the following year, he made his way to the British headquarters in Ismaïlia telling a war correspondent: &quot;Don&#x27;t for goodness&#x27; sake mention me in your despatches, for my wife thinks I&#x27;m somewhere on the Riviera, but I could not resist coming here to see the fun.&quot; He petitioned the British commander, Sir Garnet Wolseley, for a role on the staff; but Wolseley refused, writing to his wife:

Nonetheless, Havelock was able to see action at the battles of Kassassin and Tel el-Kebir, where he supposedly led a charge armed with nothing but a riding crop.

==Baronetcy and Member of Parliament==

In 1858 Havelock was granted the baronetcy, originally intended for his father (who died a year earlier), and he and his mother were granted a parliamentary pension of £1,000 a year. He later went to England and became a Member of Parliament in 1874 for his father&#x27;s birth-town of Sunderland until 1881. He inherited Blackwell Grange, the former property of his cousin Robert Allan, changed his surname to Havelock-Allan, (as was required by the will of the latter) and became an MP for South East Durham from 1885 to 1892.

==Death==
Havelock was re-elected in 1895 and also became Colonel of the Royal Irish Regiment, stationed in India, that year. It was there that he was killed by Afridi clansmen on the Afghanistan side of the Khyber Pass in 1897 and he was later buried in Rawalpindi.

==Works==
In 1867, Havelock published his &quot;Three Main Military Questions of the Day&quot;, which addressed the issues of a Home Reserve Army, improved economic military tenure of India and the effects of breechloading arms on cavalry.

<text>Lance Corporal Francis Arthur Jefferson VC (18 August 1921 – 4 September 1982) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. It was awarded for his actions at the Battle of Monte Cassino in mid-1944 during the gruelling Italian campaign of the Second World War.

==Details==
Jefferson was 22 years old, and a fusilier in the 2nd Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16 May 1944, during an attack on the Gustav Line, Monte Cassino, Italy, the leading company of Fusilier Jefferson&#x27;s battalion had to dig in without protection. The enemy counter-attacked opening fire at short range, and Fusilier Jefferson on his own initiative seized a PIAT and, running forward under a hail of bullets, fired on the leading tank. It burst into flames and its crew were killed. The fusilier then reloaded and went towards the second tank which withdrew before he could get within range. By this time, British tanks had arrived and the enemy counter-attack was smashed.

Francis Jefferson&#x27;s Victoria Cross was stolen in January 1982 during a burglary at his mother&#x27;s home at Luton Street, Bolton, Lancashire. The VC has never been recovered.

<text>John Alexander Christie VC (14 May 1895 – 10 September 1967), known as Jock Christie, was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Christie was 22 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 1/11th (County of London) Battalion, (Finsbury Rifles), London Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 21 December/22 December 1917, at Fejja, Palestine, after a position had been captured, the enemy immediately made counter-attacks up the communication trenches. Lance-Corporal Christie, seeing what was happening, took a supply of bombs and went alone about 50 yards in the open along the communication trench and bombed the enemy. He continued to do this in spite of heavy opposition until a block had been established. On his way back he bombed more of the enemy who were moving up the trench. His prompt action cleared a difficult position at a most difficult time and saved many lives.

His medal is privately held.

==Memorials==

Jock Christie had been a parcels clerk employed by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) at Euston Station. In 1920 the LNWR named &quot;Claughton&quot;-class locomotive No. 1407 &#x27;L/Cpl J.A. Christie, V.C.&#x27; in his honour.

A plaque inside Euston Station commemorating the action of Jock Christie VC was unveiled by his son on 28 March 2014.

There is also a memorial to Christie in Pymmes Park, Edmonton.

<text>Fiorella Terenzi is an Italian-born astrophysicist, author and recording artist who is best known for taking recordings of radio waves from distant galaxies and turning them into music. She received her doctorate from the University of Milan but is currently based in the United States.

Described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;a cross between Carl Sagan and Madonna&quot;, Terenzi has studied opera and composition at Conservatory G. Verdi, Corsi Popolari Serali and taught physics and astronomy at various U.S. colleges and universities; she is currently on the full-time faculty at Florida International University in Miami. In research at the Computer Audio Research Laboratory, University of California, San Diego, she pioneered techniques to convert radio waves emanating from distant galaxies into sound, with some of the results released by Island Records on her CD &quot;Music from the Galaxies&quot;. The goal of her audiofication/sonification of celestial data is to investigate how sound could reflect chemical, dynamical and physical properties of celestial objects, which she calls &quot;Acoustic Astronomy&quot;.

== Media appearances ==
Terenzi&#x27;s global media appearances include television and radio segments on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Future Watch&quot;, &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;, SyFy, NPR&#x27;s &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;, &quot;Weekend Edition&quot; and &quot;Science Friday&quot;, &quot;Newsweek on Air&quot;, &quot;Strange Universe&quot;, History&#x27;s &quot;The Universe&quot; and &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot;, and others.

She is profiled in the April 2017 edition of &quot;Rockerilla&quot;, a monthly Italian music and cinema magazine.

== Public speaking / lectures ==
In lectures at University of California, San Diego, Stanford, MIT, the Smithsonian Institution, the American Museum of Natural History (NY), and in performances, live and on TV, in the US, Europe, and Japan, Terenzi has combined science and art to awaken people to the wonders of the universe. She has moderated hundreds of panels on science, technology, education and public outreach, from Digital Hollywood to MacWorld, and chaired the &quot;Techno 2000&quot; symposium at Pepperdine University. Terenzi&#x27;s speaking engagements embrace such topics as &quot;Globalization of Education&quot;, &quot;Women in Space&quot;, &quot;The Business of Space&quot;, &quot;Values for a New Civilization&quot;, &quot;Art, Intelligence &amp; Artificial Intelligence&quot; and, most notably, &quot;Heavenly Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Invisible Universe&quot;.

Terenzi addressed the &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; International Luxury Conference, a two-day event bringing together over 500 business and creative leaders in Miami on December 2–3, 2014, in a talk entitled &quot;The Collaborative Mind: Bridging Astrophysics and Aesthetics&quot;, and was interviewed on AriseTV&#x27;s &quot;Arise Xchange&quot; news program in connection with her talk.

On April 2, 2017, Terenzi spoke at the University of Miami for the premiere of &quot;Universal Language&quot;, a documentary film exploring the source of music and vibrations, and their effect on the mind, body and soul, as told through the eyes of a deaf child, and she was previously interviewed for the film during its production.

On October 18, 2018, Terenzi participated on a panel at the Digital Hollywood Los Angeles event discussing &quot;Women on the Creative Edge: Experiences in a Changing Landscape&quot;, and on October 29, 2018 she delivered a talk entitled &quot;Star Songs: Experiencing the Unseeable&quot; at California State University Channel Islands, where she also presented her multimedia musical production &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Astrophysical&quot; during the spring 2019 semester. On January 23, 2019, Terenzi also spoke on &quot;The 4 Es of STEM Education: Entertain, Educate, Enthrall and Engage&quot; at California State University, Northridge.

On May 21, 2019, Terenzi again participated on a panel at the Digital Hollywood Los Angeles event discussing &quot;Women on the Creative Edge: From Film to TV to Athletes, Wellness &amp; Technology&quot;.

== Professor / Astrophysicist ==
During her term as Director of New Media at the Miami Museum of Science and Space Transit Planetarium, Terenzi arranged and hosted events, including &quot;National Astronomy Day&quot;, produced planetarium shows, including &quot;Stars of the Seasons/Stars of the Sea&quot;, developed content for grants, including a NASA grant to deliver earth/space science online for high schools, and spoke at events from the NSF-funded &quot;Girls in Science&quot; program, to the Florida Planetarium Directors Association, to the international State of the World Forum in New York.

Terenzi has taught astronomy and physics at Pace University (New York), City University of New York&#x27;s (Borough of Manhattan Community College and Bronx Community College), Brevard Community College, Pierce and Glendale College (Los Angeles).
Currently, she is a full-time Professor of Astronomy and Physics at Florida International University (FIU), Miami, where in 2017 she received an FIU College of Arts, Sciences &amp; Education Award for Engagement, which recognizes outstanding faculty who have distinguished themselves in the area of engagement.

FIU&#x27;s new Stocker AstroScience Center, opened in November 2013, includes an interactive exhibit highlighting Terenzi&#x27;s research on the audiofication/sonification of celestial data, entitled &quot;Acoustic Astronomy: The Sounds of the Universe&quot;.

Terenzi organized and hosted a March 2, 2018 event for FIU&#x27;s College of Arts, Science &amp; Education entitled &quot;Physics &amp; Ferraris&quot;, showcasing a variety of exotic Ferrari sports cars and featuring an address by renowned inventor, vehicle designer, and former Walt Disney Imagineering R&amp;D president, Bran Ferren, whose talk explained the physics behind why various vehicles, ranging from airplanes to race cars, work.

On November 18, 2018, FIU presented Terenzi with its 2018 Torch Award for Outstanding Faculty, honoring the lasting impression she has made on the lives of the university&#x27;s students and alumni.

In June 2017, Terenzi appeared on electronic artist Manipulant&#x27;s (David Speakman) album &quot;Eclectro&quot;. The song &quot;Doctor, I Need Your Expertise&quot; features Terenzi describing the sounds of space combined with an electronic backdrop, simulating a journey through the solar system.

== Authors: Books and publications ==
Formerly represented by talent/literary agents the William Morris Agency, Terenzi is best known for her CD-ROM &quot;Invisible Universe&quot; (Voyager Company, 1995), which blends astronomy and music into an entertaining and enlightening voyage through the stars. The title won the SIGCAT (Special Interest Group on CD Applications and Technology) award for &quot;Most Creative Application of Multimedia in Higher and Adult Education&quot;.

Terenzi is also known for a sexually charged book about science entitled &quot;Heavenly Knowledge&quot; (Avon Books/Harper Collins), which explores astronomy as a metaphor for human relationships and humanity&#x27;s place in the universe. The book, covered on ABC Radio, &quot;Talk of The Nation&quot;, BBC Radio, and SyFy, has been translated into Italian (&quot;Musica Dalle Stelle&quot;, Sterling Kupfer)—bundled with her music CD &quot;Galactically Yours&quot;—as well as German (&quot;Der Kosmos ist weiblich&quot;, Bertelsmann/Goldmann), Latvian and other languages.

Terenzi wrote the foreword for Paula Berinstein&#x27;s book &quot;Making Space Happen: Private Space Efforts and the People Behind Them&quot; and has been featured in a full chapter in Laura Woodmansee&#x27;s &quot;Women of Space: Cool Careers on the Final Frontier&quot; and in the music and technology book &quot;The Art of Digital Music&quot; by Kelli Richards and David Battino. She also provided a technical review of the educational text book &quot;The Physics of Everyday Phenomena&quot; by Thomas Griffith, and &quot;University Physics for the Physical and Life Sciences&quot; by Philip Kesten and David Tauk.

== Outreach and innovations ==
Among her outreach projects, Terenzi created the grant-winning &quot;BCC Space &amp; Astronomy Lecture Series&quot;, to inspire and educate the public about the universe.

She has developed several learning modules: &quot;The Business of Space&quot;, to promote cultural diversity and global awareness about space and astronomy; &quot;Astronomy in Paintings, Frescos, and Engravings&quot;, on how art has been used to explain the Universe from stars to galaxies; &quot;Sounds of the Universe: Acoustic Astronomy&quot;, to stimulate intellectual curiosity and individual thinking; and an &quot;Invisible Universe&quot; learning module to explore celestial objects in multi-wavelengths.

Terenzi&#x27;s lectures combine science and art with knowledge and emotion, a concept she calls &quot;Emotional Learning,&quot; based on the 4 &quot;E&quot;s: &quot;Entertain, Educate, Enlighten, and Enthrall.&quot; As Terenzi has stated, &quot;When you are engaged on these multiple levels, learning finds an emotional home, and it is remembered forever.&quot;

She has created original collections of stellar-themed jewelry designs based on the color and symmetry of stars and galaxies, including GemAllure and Stellare.

Terenzi premiered her &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Astrophysical&quot; multimedia show for the Miami Beach Centennial Celebration on March 23, 2015, on the oceanfront Hard Rock Rising stage in South Beach. The show featured the first and only top 15 stellar-themed pop song countdown, including songs from Muse, OneRepublic, Oasis, Incubus, Fall Out Boy, Katy Perry, Hardwell and Daft Punk, combined with live DJs, musicians, dancers and acrobats, plus a laser light show. 
&quot;Let&#x27;s Get Astrophysical&quot; was successfully reprised on May 3–4, 2019 at the Arts Under the Stars Festival at California State University Channel Islands.

== Scientific advisory ==
Terenzi is the first person to be a member of both the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences (Grammy Awards) and the American Astronomical Society. She has been an Apple Computer AppleMaster since 1994, and she is the founder of the Ferrari Club of America – Florida Region.

She is an &quot;Adviser and Scientific Consultant&quot; to the Italian Academy of Food for the &quot;Italian Food in Space&quot; effort, enabling NASA Space Shuttle mission STS-120 (October 23, 2007) to include a unique Italian menu consumed and shared among the astronauts in the International Space Station on the 5th day of its mission. She worked with ASI/ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli, who was a crew member on the shuttle and ISS.

Terenzi served on the Scientific Advisory Board for the Lifeboat Foundation and on the Foundation&#x27;s Asteroid/Comet Impacts Board.

Zegna fashion designer Stefano Pilati commissioned Terenzi to create a journey into space, using real images and her acoustic astronomy sounds in a video for Zegna&#x27;s Fall-Winter 2014 Men&#x27;s Collection. This new union of fashion and astrophysics was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;Zegna&#x27;s Very Big Bang&quot;, and generated extensive worldwide publicity. &quot;No one has ever done anything like this before&quot;, said Gildo Zegna.

A new version of the Zegna video, which was a collaboration between Terenzi, fellow astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Pilati, was entitled &quot;City and Nature – Scientist Cut&quot; and formed the framework of an innovative 23-window display at Harrods, the luxury London department store. From October 2–19, 2014, new &quot;Whispering Window&quot; technology allowed Terenzi&#x27;s space sounds, accompanied by the music of Tchaikovsky, to be shared with passing pedestrians, in order to demonstrate how science and fashion complement one another.

<text>Robert Cuthbert Grieve, VC (19 June 1889 – 4 October 1957) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born in Brighton, a suburb of Melbourne, to John and Annie Deas Grieve (née Brown), Grieve was educated at Caulfield Grammar School and then Wesley College. He became an interstate commercial traveller in the softgoods trade.

==First World War==
After nine months service in the Victorian Rangers, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force as a private on 9 June 1915. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 37th Battalion in January 1916, was promoted to lieutenant in May 1916, and after training in England, was promoted to captain in France in February 1917.

In France he served at Armentières, Bois-Grenier, L&#x27;Epinette, Ploegsteert Wood, Messines, La Basse Ville, and Warneton.

He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at Messines. The announcement and accompanying citation for the award was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 31 July 1917, reading:

Severely wounded in the shoulder by a sniper&#x27;s bullet, Grieve was evacuated to England, and on recovery returned to his unit in October. However, due to subsequently suffering acute trench nephritis and double pneumonia, he was invalided to Australia in May 1918. On 7 August, at Scots Church, Sydney, he married Sister May Isabel Bowman of the Australian Army Nursing Service who had nursed him during his illness.

==Post-war==

Post-war he held the rank of captain in the Militia. He established the business of Grieve, Gardner &amp; Co., soft-goods warehousemen, in Flinders Lane, Melbourne, and was managing director until 4 October 1957 when he died of cardiac failure.

He was buried with military honours in Springvale cemetery. Grieve&#x27;s medal was presented by his family to Wesley College in 1959, and has been lent to the Shrine of Remembrance, where it is on permanent display. Grieve was an active supporter of Wesley College for many years and contributed towards an annual scholarship.

A home room at Wesley College is named in his honour as well as a &#x27;Grieve Way&#x27; a street in Wodonga, Victoria.

==Family==
A son, Robert Henderson &quot;Bob&quot; Grieve (30 November 1924 – 15 December 2006) was a noted artist and president of the Victorian branch of the Contemporary Art Society from 1967 to 1987.

===Relation to John Grieve===
A number of references including the 1997 edition of The Register of the Victoria Cross list Sergeant Major John Grieve VC (Crimea, 1854) and Captain Robert Cuthbert Grieve (Belgium, 1917) as great uncle and great nephew. This connection was suggested by an article in The Times on 29 May 1964. The article said John Grieve sent home £75 from the Crimea to Robert Grieve and that if Robert Grieve was his brother and also emigrated, then some relationship may be established between the two VC recipients. However, descendants of both Grieve families have been in contact with each other and concluded no such relationship existed.

<text>Robert Hampton &quot;Hammy&quot; Gray, (November 2, 1917 – August 9, 1945) was a Canadian naval officer, pilot, and recipient of the Victoria Cross during World War II. He and Eugene Esmonde are the only personnel of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm to be decorated the VC in the war. Gray is the last Canadian to be awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Early life==
Gray was born in Trail, British Columbia, Canada, but resided from an early age in Nelson, where his father was a jeweller. He completed one year at the University of Alberta before transferring to the Bachelor of Arts program at The University of British Columbia where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Before completing university, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) at in Calgary, Alberta. Originally sent to England for training, Gray was sent back to Canada to train at RCAF Station Kingston.

==War service==
===Africa and Norway===
Gray initially joined 757 Naval Air Squadron at Winchester, England. He was then assigned to the African theatre, flying Hawker Hurricanes for shore-based squadrons, nos. 795, 803, and 877, where he spent two years at Nairobi.

He trained to fly the Vought F4U Corsair fighter and in 1944 he was assigned to 1841 NAS, based on . From August 24–29, 1944, he took part in the unsuccessful Operation Goodwood raids against the , in Norway. On August 29, 1944, he was Mentioned in Dispatches for his participation in an attack on three German destroyers, during which his plane&#x27;s rudder was shot off. On January 16, 1945, he received a further Mention, &quot;For undaunted courage, skill and determination in carrying out daring attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz.&quot;

===Japan===
In April 1945, HMS &quot;Formidable&quot; joined the British Pacific Fleet which was involved in the invasion of Okinawa. By July 1945, the carrier was involved in strikes on the Japanese mainland. On July 18, Gray led a strafing mission against airfields in the Tokyo area. On July 24, Gray led another flight to the inland sea which damaged one merchant ship, and damaged two seaplane bases and one airbase. Gray earned a Distinguished Service Cross for aiding in sinking a Japanese destroyer in the area of Tokyo on July 28. The award was not announced until August 21, 1945, when the notice appeared in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; with the citation, &quot;For determination and address in air attacks on targets in Japan&quot;.

====VC action====
On August 9, 1945, at Onagawa Bay, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, Lieutenant Gray (flying a Vought F4U Corsair) led an attack on a group of Japanese naval vessels, sinking the before his plane crashed into the bay. The citation for his VC, gazetted on November 13, 1945, described as being:

==Awards and decorations==
Gray&#x27;s personal awards and decorations include the following:

==Legacy==

As Gray&#x27;s remains were never found, he was listed as missing in action and presumed dead. He is commemorated, with other Canadians who died or were buried at sea during the First and Second World Wars, at the Halifax Memorial in Point Pleasant Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia. The War Memorial Gym at University of British Columbia, Royal Canadian Legion hall in Nelson, numerous other sites in Nelson, and the wardroom of HMCS &quot;Tecumseh&quot; (his RCNVR home unit) also bear plaques in his honour.

A memorial for Gray was erected at Onagawa Bay in 1989 in Sakiyama Park. This is the only memorial dedicated to a foreign soldier on Japanese soil. Following the devastation of the March 11, 2011 earthquake (during which the granite monument itself was knocked over), the monument (with new plaque) was moved from its original location in Sakiyama Park to one beside the hospital (Onagawacho Community Medicine Center) in Onagawa Town. A rededication ceremony was held August 24, 2012. Gray is one of fourteen figures commemorated at the Valiants Memorial in Ottawa.

To celebrate the Centennial of the Canadian Navy, during the 2010 air show season, Vintage Wings of Canada flew at events across Canada in a Corsair bearing the markings of the plane Gray was likely flying that fateful day.

His life is recorded in &quot;A Formidable Hero: Lt. R.H. Gray, VC, DSC, RCNVR&quot; by Stuart E. Soward, published by Trafford Neptune.

===Grays Peak, British Columbia===
On March 12, 1946, the Geographic Board of Canada named a mountain in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park, British Columbia, after Gray and his brother, Flt Sgt John Balfour Gray, RCAF, who was also killed in World War II. Rising to a height of , Grays Peak is well known in Canada as the mountain pictured on the label of Kokanee Beer.

===Hampton Gray Memorial Elementary===
The elementary school at CFB Shearwater is named after Gray.

===Kingston Norman Rogers Airport===
Gray completed his training at No. 31 Service Flying Training School in Kingston, Ontario. There is a Harvard aircraft, same type of trainer he flew at Kingston, mounted on a pedestal with a memorial dedicated to him. Additionally, the road leading to the airport terminal has been named Hampton Gray Gate.

=== Royal Canadian Sea Cadets ===
The Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps in Nelson, BC is named 81 Hampton Gray, VC Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps.

=== Royal Canadian Air Cadets ===
In 2012, the Royal Canadian Air Cadets created a new squadron in his honour called 789 Lt. R. Hampton Gray VC Squadron which is located in Mississauga, Ontario.

=== &quot;Harry DeWolf&quot;-class offshore patrol vessel ===

The sixth for the Royal Canadian Navy will be named for Gray.

===Brechin, Angus, Scotland===

The Gray family headstone in Brechin Cemetery was completely restored in 2021 after it had fallen into a state of disrepair. (The main headstone had been removed from its plinth and positioned on the adjacent grass). The work was carried out and funded by locals. On the 76th anniversary of his death and VC action a short service was conducted at the family grave. The headstone carries the inscriptions for Robert and his brother Flight Sergeant John (Jack) Balfour Gray, RCAF. He was killed on February 27, 1942 serving with 144 Squadron RAF. He is buried in Doncaster (Rosehill) Cemetery. 

A new housing development in Brechin will feature a street named after Robert Hampton Gray, Hampton Gray Way.

<text>General Sir Garrett O&#x27;Moore Creagh, (2 April 1848 – 9 August 1923), known as Sir O&#x27;Moore Creagh, was a senior British Army officer and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and family==
Creagh was born in Cahirbane, County Clare, on 2 April 1848, the seventh son of Captain James Creagh, an officer of the Royal Navy, and his wife, Grace O&#x27;Moore.

Creagh was married twice, firstly to Mary Longfield (or possibly Brereton) in 1874, who died in 1876, and then to Elizabeth Reade in 1891. He had three children, one of whom was Major General Sir Michael Creagh.

In 1866, after training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Creagh was commissioned into the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot and in 1869 was posted to India, being transferred to the British Indian Army the next year.

==Second Anglo-Afghan War==
Creagh was 31 years old, and a captain in the Bombay Staff Corps during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, when the following deed on 22 April 1879 at Kam Dakka, on the Kabul River, Afghanistan, took place for which he was awarded the VC:
==Later career==

In 1878 he became captain of the Merwara battalion, commanding them from 1882 until 1886. He assumed command of the 29th (Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own) Bombay Infantry (2nd Baluch Battalion) in 1890, and was promoted to Assistant Quarter-master General in 1896. He commanded the Indian contingent during the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, and was in July 1901 appointed General Officer Commanding the British Force in China after the departure of General Alfred Gaselee. He stayed in China for several years, and a report on the field operations of the force during his first year in overall command was sent in a despatch published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 21 November 1902. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1904 and promoted to general on 11 December 1907. The same year he was appointed Military Secretary to the India Office.

Creagh succeeded Lord Kitchener as Commander-in-Chief, India, in 1909, retiring in 1914. During the First World War he served as the military advisor to the Central Association of Volunteer Training Corps. He died at 65 Albert Hall Mansions, London SW9, on 9 August 1923.

Creagh further followed Kitchener in becoming the District Grand Master of Freemasons in the Punjab.

His Victoria Cross is held by the National Army Museum in Chelsea, London, England.

<text>James Joseph Magennis, VC (27 October 1919 – 12 February 1986) was a Belfast-born sailor and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the only native of Northern Ireland to receive the Victoria Cross in the Second World War.

Magennis was part of several operations involving X-Craft midget submarines in attacks on Axis ships. In July 1945, Magennis was serving on during Operation Struggle. During an attack on the in Singapore, Magennis showed extraordinary valour and bravery by leaving the submarine for a second time in order to free some explosive charges that had got caught. His commanding officer, Lieutenant Ian Edward Fraser, was also awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the operation.

==Early career==
James Magennis was born on 27 October 1919, at Majorca Street, West Belfast, Ireland. He was from a working class Roman Catholic family and attended St Finian&#x27;s Primary School on the Falls Road, Belfast. On 3 June 1935 he enlisted in the Royal Navy as a boy seaman (spelling his surname Magennis).

Magennis served on several warships between 1935 and 1942, when he joined the submarine branch. Before joining the submarine branch, Magennis served on the destroyer , which was mined off Tripoli, Libya, in December 1941, while Magennis was on board. The ship was irreparably damaged and was scuttled the following day.

In December 1942, Magennis was drafted into the Royal Navy Submarine Service and, in March 1943, he volunteered for &quot;special and Hazardous duties&quot; – which meant midget submarines, or X-craft. He trained as a diver, and in September 1943, took part in the first major use of the X-craft during Operation Source. Two submarines, and , penetrated Kåfjord, Norway, and disabled the . For his part in the attack Magennis was Mentioned in Despatches &quot;[f]or bravery and devotion to duty&quot; in 1943.

==Operation Struggle==
In July 1945, Magennis, as acting leading seaman, was serving as the diver on the midget submarine , under the command of Lieutenant Ian Edward Fraser, as part of Operation Struggle. They were tasked with sinking the 10,000 ton , the first of the . She was berthed in the Straits of Johor, Singapore, acting as an anti-aircraft battery. On 30 July, &quot;XE3&quot; was towed to the area by the submarine . She slipped her tow at 23:00 for the journey through hazardous wrecks, minefields and listening posts to reach the &quot;Takao.&quot; After arriving at the &quot;Takao&quot; at 13:00 on 31 July, Magennis slipped out of the wet-and-dry chamber and attached limpet mines to the &quot;Takao&quot; under particularly difficult circumstances. He had to chip away at barnacles on the bottom of the cruiser for 30 minutes, before being able to attach the limpets.

During this time, Magennis&#x27; breathing apparatus was leaking and he returned to the submarine after completion of his task very exhausted. On withdrawing, Fraser found that one of the limpet carriers which was being jettisoned would not release itself. Magennis immediately volunteered to free it, commenting: &quot;I&#x27;ll be all right as soon as I&#x27;ve got my wind, Sir.&quot; This he did, after seven minutes of nerve-racking work with a heavy spanner. On completion, Magennis returned to &quot;XE3&quot; for the second time, allowing the four-man midget submarine to make its escape out to open sea to meet the waiting &quot;Stygian&quot;. Fraser was also awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the attack; whilst Lieutenant William J. L. Smith, who was at the controls of &quot;XE3&quot; during the attack, received the Distinguished Service Order. Engineer third class Charles Alfred Reed, who was at the wheel, received the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal.

 was supposed to be attacking another Japanese vessel as part of the same operation, but actually ended up also placing its explosives under the same target. &quot;XE1&quot;″s commanding officer, Lieutenant John Elliott Smart, and Sub-Lieutenant Harold Edwin Harper, received the Distinguished Service Cross. Engineer fourth class Henry James Fishleigh and leading seaman Walter Henry Arthur Pomeroy received the Distinguished Service Medal. Engineer fourth class Albert Nairn, leading stoker Jack Gordan Robinson, and Able Seaman Ernest Raymond Dee were mentioned in dispatches for their part in bringing the two midget submarines from harbour to the point where the crews that took part in the attack took over.

===Victoria Cross===
The citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 9 November:
==Later life==

Magennis was the only Victoria Cross recipient of the Second World War to hail from Northern Ireland. As a result, Magennis obtained something of a &quot;celebrity status&quot; in his home city. The citizens of Belfast raised more than £3,000 as part of a &quot;Shilling Fund.&quot; The City Fathers of Belfast refused to give Magennis the freedom of the City though. Sources differ as to the reasoning behind this; some claim it was due to religious divisions, others claim it was due to the City Fathers not &quot;... believing that such an honour could not be bestowed on a working-class Catholic from the inner-city slums.&quot;

In 1946 Magennis married Edna Skidmore, with whom he had four sons. The money from the Shilling Fund was spent quickly by Magennis and his wife; she remarked: &quot;We are simple people ... forced into the limelight. We lived beyond our means because it seemed the right thing to do.&quot; In 1949 he left the navy and returned to Belfast, where, at some point, he sold his Victoria Cross. In 1955, he moved to Yorkshire, where he worked as an electrician. For the last years of his life, he suffered from chronic ill health, before dying on 11 February 1986 of lung cancer hours before his heroism was honoured by the Royal Navy Philatelic Office with a first-day cover.

==Memorials==
Magennis has had several memorials in his honour. Initial official recognition was only a photograph in the robing room of the Belfast city council chamber. The first memorial was erected in 1999 after a long campaign by his biographer George Fleming and Major S.H. Pollock CD (Canada). It, an elegant bronze and stone statue created by sculptor Elizabeth McLaughlin, was unveiled in Belfast on 8 October 1999. The ceremony was conducted in the grounds of Belfast City Hall in the presence of Magennis&#x27;s son Paul, by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Bob Stoker.

Magennis&#x27;s former commanding officer, Ian Fraser, was reported as saying: &quot;Jim gave me bother from time to time. He liked his tot of rum, but he was a lovely man and a fine diver. I have never met a braver man. It was a privilege to know him and it&#x27;s wonderful to see Belfast honour him at last.&quot; A wall mural commemorating James Magennis on the 60th anniversary of VJ day was unveiled on 16 September 2005 by Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist Party Member of Parliament representing East Belfast, including Tullycarnet.

His portrait in oils was painted by Belfast artist Robert Taylor Carson who described Magennis as &#x27;the perfect model - patient, attentive and completely natural.&#x27; The painting was purchased by Mr. Nevill McGeough Bond of the Argory, who then presented it to the Northern Ireland War Memorial Building Fund in 1946. The painting still hangs on display at the Northern Ireland War Memorial.

===Magennis plaques===

In 1986 at a memorial service in Bradford Cathedral, the Submarine Old Comrade Association (West Riding Branch) erected a memorial plaque on an inner wall within the cathedral. The plaque made of Welsh slate was supplied by ex-submariner Tommy Topham MBE. Rear Admiral Place VC, CB, CVO, DSC unveiled the plaque. In attendance was Petty Officer Tommy &quot;Nat&quot; Gould, another submariner Victoria Cross recipient of the Second World War.

In 1998 a memorial plaque was installed by Castlereagh Borough Council on the wall of Magennis&#x27;s former home at 32 Carncaver Road, Castlereagh, East Belfast. A memorial blue plaque sponsored by Belfast City Council was installed on the outer wall of the Royal Naval Association building at Great Victoria Street, Belfast by the Ulster History Circle.

===Ashcroft collection===
In 1986, there was some publicity in the newspapers that his VC would be up at auction. This attracted the interest of Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft, who bought the VC for £29,000 (plus fees) amidst strong competition from dealers and private collectors. This was the first Victoria Cross bought by Lord Ashcroft, who, as of 2006, owned 142 medals.

In July 2008, Lord Ashcroft announced a donation of £5 million for a permanent gallery at the Imperial War Museum, where Victoria Crosses already held by the museum will be put on display alongside his own. The Lord Ashcroft Gallery opened in 2010.

==In media==
Magennis was profiled in the 2006 television docudrama &quot;Victoria Cross Heroes&quot;, which included archive footage, dramatisations of his actions and an interview with Lord Ashcroft about his VC.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel John Augustus Conolly VC (30 May 1829 – 23 December 1888), born in Celbridge, County Kildare, Ireland, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
Conolly was a younger son of Edward Michael Conolly (an MP), by his wife Catherine Jane, daughter of Chambré Brabazon Ponsonby-Barker (also an MP). He was born in Ireland and educated in England at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham.

On 26 October 1854 at Sebastopol, the Crimea, an attack by the Russians was repulsed and the enemy fell back pursued by men of the 49th Regiment, led by Lieutenant Conolly, whose gallant behaviour was most conspicuous in this action. He ultimately fell, dangerously wounded, while in personal encounter with several Russians, in defence of his post.

==Later life==
Conolly eventually achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. He died in Curragh, County Kildare, on 23 December 1888 and is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery.

<text>Robert Grierson Combe (5 August 1880 – 3 May 1917) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Combe is also considered Scottish since he was born in Aberdeen, Scotland.

==Details==
Combe was 36 years old, and a lieutenant in the 27th Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 3 May 1917, south of Acheville, France, Lieutenant Combe steadied his company under intense fire and leading them through the enemy barrage reached the objective with only five men. He proceeded to bomb the enemy, inflicting heavy casualties and then, collecting small groups of men, succeeded in capturing the objective, together with 80 prisoners. He repeatedly charged the enemy, driving them before him, but while personally leading his bombers he was killed by a sniper.

Combe was buried in a battlefield cemetery near Acheville close where he was killed, but later fighting saw the cemetery destroyed and his grave site lost. As such, R.G. Combe&#x27;s name is inscribed on the Canadian National Vimy Memorial along with the names of the other Canadian soldiers who were killed in France and whose bodies were never recovered or identified or whose graves were lost. The battlefield on which Lt. Combe fell is just over seven kilometres away from the Vimy Monument, and on a clear day Acheville can be seen from the monument itself.

==The medal==
Combe&#x27;s medal is held by the Provincial Archives in Regina, Saskatchewan and is displayed on special occasions. It is the only publicly held Victoria Cross in the province.

<text>Frank John Partridge, VC (29 November 1924 – 23 March 1964) was an Australian soldier, farmer, quiz show champion, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. He was decorated for his actions on Bougainville in July 1945, when he attacked two Japanese bunkers despite severe wounds. Partridge was the last and, at 20 years of age, the youngest Australian awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War. He later became a farmer and a television quiz champion, and unsuccessfully ran for political office shortly before his death in a car accident.

==Early life==
Frank John Partridge was born at Grafton, New South Wales, on 29 November 1924, to farmer Patrick James Partridge and his English-born wife Mary (née Saggs). Partridge was educated at Tewinga Public School until he left at 13 to work on the family&#x27;s dairy and banana farm at Upper Newee Creek, near Macksville.

==Second World War==
In December 1942, during World War II, Partridge was conscripted by the Australian Army. He served as a private in the 8th Battalion, a Militia unit formed in Victoria. In May 1944, the 8th Battalion was posted to New Guinea.

In June 1945, the 8th Battalion was transferred to the Bougainville campaign, where it operated to contain Japanese forces on the Bonis Peninsula. It was here that Partridge performed a deed for which he received the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry that could be awarded to British Commonwealth forces.

On 24 July, in one of the last actions of the campaign on Bougainville, two platoons of the 8th Battalion attacked a Japanese post, Base 5, near Ratsua. Partridge&#x27;s section came under heavy machine-gun fire and suffered severe casualties, including a Bren gunner who was killed. Although wounded in the arm and leg, Partridge retrieved the Bren gun and began shooting at the nearest bunker while under fire himself. He then rushed forward armed with a grenade and a knife, silenced the Japanese machine-gun with his grenade, and killed the only living occupant of the bunker with his knife. Partridge attacked the second until loss of blood compelled him to halt. Later he re-joined the fight and remained in action while the platoon withdrew.

Partridge was the last and the youngest Australian to be awarded the Victoria Cross in World War II. He was also the first Australian Militiaman to receive the award.

==Later life==

Discharged from the army in October 1946, Partridge returned to the family farm. He lived with his father in a dirt-floored farmhouse, and in his spare time devoted himself to self-education, reading &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; by the light of a kerosene lamp. He had an extraordinarily retentive memory and in 1962–63 he appeared as a contestant on the television quiz show, &quot;Pick a Box&quot;, compered by Bob Dyer, alongside contestants such as Barry Jones. His laconic manner appealed strongly to viewers. Partridge was one of only three contestants to win all forty boxes and his prizes were valued at more than £12,000 (in excess of A$250,000 in present-day terms).

He married Barbara Dunlop, a 31-year-old nurse from Turramurra in Sydney, in February 1963. The wedding received extensive media coverage. She remained in Sydney while Partridge built a new house at the farm. He drove to Sydney every weekend to see her. Later in 1963, Partridge sought Country Party pre-selection for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Cowper. His political views were widely regarded as extreme, and he was not selected. To supplement the income from his farm, Partridge also sold life insurance.

Partridge was killed in a car accident in 1964, and was buried with full military honours in Macksville Cemetery. His wife and three-month-old son survived him.

In 1989 a primary school at Nambucca Heads was named the Frank Partridge VC Public School.

The Frank Partridge VC Rest Area on the southbound lane of the Hume Highway, some kilometres south of Sydney, is named after him.

<text>David Lowe Macintyre VC, CB (18 June 1895 – 31 July 1967) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
After graduating from the University of Edinburgh, the 23 years old, and a temporary lieutenant in The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s), British Army, was attached to 1/6th Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry during the First World War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 24 August 1918, and three days later, on 27 August near Hénin and Fontaine-lès-Croisilles, France, Lieutenant Macintyre, when acting as adjutant of his battalion, was constantly in evidence in the firing line and by his coolness under most heavy shell and machine-gun fire inspired the confidence of all ranks. On one occasion when extra strong barbed wire entanglements were encountered, he organised and took forward a party and under heavy fire supervised the making of gaps. Subsequently, when relieved of command of the firing line and an enemy machine-gun opened fire close to him, he rushed it single-handed, putting the team to flight, and then brought in the gun. The full citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 25 October 1918, and read:

After the war, he entered the Civil Service in the Office of Works and by the time of his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1949 New Year Honours, he was Under Secretary for Scotland in its successor, the Ministry of Works. He still held the post at his retirement in 1959.

The medal is now on display in the National War Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle.

== Biography ==
Trudgill was born in Norwich, England, and grew up in the area of Thorpe St Andrew. He attended the City of Norwich School from 1955. Trudgill studied modern languages at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and obtained a PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 1971.

Before becoming professor of sociolinguistics at the University of Essex he taught in the Department of Linguistic Science at the University of Reading from 1970 to 1986. He was professor of English language and linguistics at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, from 1993 to 1998, and then at the University of Fribourg, also in Switzerland, from which he retired in September 2005, and where he is now professor emeritus of English Linguistics.

Peter Trudgill has been the president of the Friends of Norfolk Dialect society since its inception in 1999. and contributes a regular column on language and languages in Europe to the New European newspaper.

Trudgill is one of the first to apply Labovian sociolinguistic methodology in the UK, and to provide a framework for studying dialect contact phenomena.

He has carried out studies on rhoticity in English and tracked trends in British rock music for decades, including the Beatles&#x27; decreased pronunciation of /r/s over the course of the 1960s. He was a member of the committee for England and Wales for the Atlas Linguarum Europae in the 1970s, doing some research on the East Anglian sites.

<text>Nantou City (Mandarin Pīnyīn: &quot;Nántóu Shì&quot;; Hokkien POJ: &quot;Lâm-tâu-chhī&quot;) is a county-administered city located in the northwest of Nantou County, Taiwan. It lies between the Bagua Mountains and the Maoluo River and is the county seat of Nantou County. Freeway No. 3 serves Nantou City.

<text>James Duffy (17 November 1889 – 8 April 1969) () was a British Army soldier during the First World War, and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Duffy was born on 17 November 1889 in Gweedore (&quot;Gaoth Dobhair&quot;), County Donegal, Ireland.

He was 28 years old, and a private in the 6th Battalion, The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 27 December 1917 at Kereina Peak, Palestine, whilst the company was holding a very exposed position, Private Duffy, a stretcher-bearer, and another stretcher-bearer went out to bring in a seriously wounded comrade. When the other stretcher-bearer was wounded, Private Duffy returned to get another man, who was killed almost immediately. The private then went forward alone and, under very heavy fire, succeeded in getting both wounded men under cover and attended to their injuries. His gallantry undoubtedly saved both men&#x27;s lives.

==Death and legacy==

He died in Drumany, Letterkenny on 7 April 1969 and was buried at Conwal Cemetery. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Inniskilling Museum in Enniskillen Castle, Northern Ireland.

A stone bench was unveiled in Letterkenny Town Park on 10 July 2007 to honour the war veteran. His daughter Nelly was present when former Letterkenny Mayor Ciaran Brogan unveiled the bench in one of his final duties.

<text>John Bernard Mackey, VC (16 May 1922 – 12 May 1945) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British Commonwealth forces. Mackey was one of twenty Australians to receive the award for actions during the Second World War, receiving his award posthumously for leading an attack on against a strongly defended Japanese position during the Battle of Tarakan in May 1945. He was 22 and serving as a corporal in the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion at the time of his death.

==Early life==
Born in Leichhardt, New South Wales, Mackey was the only son and the eldest of four children of Stanislaus Mackey, a baker, and his wife Bridget Catherine Smyth Mackey. After attending St. Columba&#x27;s School in Leichhardt and the Christian Brothers&#x27; High School in Lewisham, New South Wales, the Mackey family moved to Portland, New South Wales, in 1936, where his father operated a bakery. Mackey finished his schooling at the age of 14 and began working for his father as a baker. However, he did not enjoy the work and his relationship with his father deteriorated.

==Second World War==
On 5 June 1940, Mackey enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, falsifying his age to do so. After training, he was posted to the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion and left with the unit in November 1941 for service in North Africa. He participated in the Syrian Campaign against the Vichy French and in the Second Battle of El Alamein.

The Japanese threat to Australia grew as they advanced through the Pacific in 1942. In response, the Australian government requested the withdrawal of Australian units back to their home country, and Mackey&#x27;s battalion returned in February 1943. It served in Papua New Guinea from August 1943 to March 1944, during which time Mackey was promoted to the rank of corporal. While in Papua, he suffered several bouts of malaria. After a period of rest and reorganisation in Australia, the battalion returned to the Southwest Pacific theatre of operations in April 1945 when they were committed to the Borneo Campaign.

On 1 May 1945, Mackey&#x27;s battalion, as part of 26th Brigade Group, landed at Lingkas Beach on Tarakan Island, off North Borneo. The island&#x27;s airfield was to be captured to allow its use in operations against Borneo. Advancing inland along the Aman River, the battalion were held up by Japanese defending a stronghold known as Helen. On 12 May 1945, Mackey&#x27;s company was to continue an attack that had begun three days previously and it was during this action that he earned the Victoria Cross (VC). The citation for his VC read:

The Japanese continued to hold off the attacking pioneers for a further two days before Helen was bombed with napalm, forcing them to abandon the position. Originally buried where he was killed, after the war Mackey was interred at Labuan War Cemetery. Mackey&#x27;s VC was presented to his sister, Patricia, and was later donated to the Australian War Memorial, where it is now on display in the Hall of Valour.

<text>Namdeo Jadhav, PVSM, VC (18 November 1921 – 2 August 1984) was an Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Jadhav was 23 years old, and a Sepoy in the 1st Battalion, 5th Mahratta Light Infantry in the Indian Army during World War II when the following deed took place during the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy for which he was awarded the VC.

On 9 April 1945 at the Senio River, Italy, when a small party were almost wiped out in an assault on the east floodbank of the river, Sepoy Namdeo Jadhav carried two wounded men under heavy fire through deep water, up a steep bank and through a mine belt to safety. Then, determined to avenge his dead comrades, he eliminated three enemy machine-gun posts. Finally, climbing on top of the bank he shouted the Maratha war cry and waved the remaining companies across. He not only saved many lives but enabled the battalion to secure the bridgehead and ultimately to crush all enemy resistance in the area.

The citation reads:

To commemorate his act of exceptional bravery a bust has been placed at the Aundh military station in Pune.
Adv Mr J.S.Savant, Bombay President, Maratha Recruitment Board, felicitated him for Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

<text>Colonel Donald John Dean (19 April 1897 – 9 December 1985) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Donald John Dean was born on 19 April 1897 in Herne Hill, South London, to John H and Grace Dean. He was educated at Quernmore College.

==Military career==
===First World War===
At the outbreak of war in August 1914, Dean attempted to enlist but was rejected because he was under-age. He was able to become a special constable and also joined the Volunteer Training Corps, a part-time home defence force. When he turned 18 in April 1915, he attempted to enlist again at his local Territorial Force depot, this time successfully. Dean served as a private with the 28th London (Artists Rifles) Regiment in the Ypres Salient and during the Battle of the Somme. In October 1916 he was commissioned into the Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment and fought at Vimy Ridge and around Givenchy.

He was 21 years old, and a temporary lieutenant in the 8th Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, when the following action took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 15 February 1919, Dean was presented with the Victoria Cross by King George V at Buckingham Palace and was given a civic reception in his home town of Sittingbourne.

===Interwar period===
Following the war, Dean took up part-time soldiering with the Territorial Army, being appointed captain in the 4th Battalion, Royal East Kent Regiment (The Buffs) in July 1921. He became a major in 1930 and took command of the battalion in 1936 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

===Second World War===
After mobilisation in 1939, Dean was informed by his divisional commander, Major General Edmund Osborne, that he was to be replaced by a regular officer as Osborne believed that Territorial officers were not efficient enough to command a battalion. Although bitterly disappointed, Dean agreed to accept the post of Group Commander of No. 5 Group, Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps, despite never having heard of either the appointment or the corps. He arrived at the group&#x27;s depot at Butlin&#x27;s Clacton holiday camp in Essex in October 1939. Dean was the youngest officer in the group, and although there were some experienced reservists amongst the other ranks, the majority had volunteered to escape unemployment or were conscripts who had been graded as unfit for any other military duty.

On deployment to France with the British Expeditionary Force, No. 5 Group were issued with one rifle between every four men and undertook labouring tasks in the Doullens area, near Amiens, without any opportunity for training. In May 1940, the group were threatened by the advancing Germans and were ordered to evacuate but were without transport. Dean therefore marched his men to Saint-Pol where they attempted to find a train. With the rail system in chaos, Dean resorted to bribing the station master so that he could requisition a train and following a brief fire-fight with the leading German units the Group were able to reach Wimereux near Boulogne-sur-Mer. Here Dean was ordered to send part of his force to Boulogne harbour to act as dock labour for 20th Guards Brigade who were arriving to defend the port.

The Guards established a defensive perimeter around the town and were told to expect reinforcements from Calais, however these never arrived as the Germans had occupied the coast road. Therefore, Dean was asked to provide a force to fill a 3-mile (4.8 km) gap in the defences. Selecting 800 of his pioneers, Dean armed them with rifles taken from the remainder who were sent on to the harbour to begin evacuating to England. Lacking any heavy weapons, Dean directed the construction of roadblocks from whatever was available, which it was hoped might delay the advancing tanks. On 23 May, the Germans attacked in earnest; in fierce fighting at their barricades, the pioneers claimed to have destroyed one tank by igniting petrol underneath it. The pioneers were the last unit to pull back from the perimeter, because the runner bringing the order to withdraw could not locate Dean since there were no radios. Eventually arriving at the harbour, Dean ensured that as many of his men as possible were evacuated before being the last man to board the final destroyer to depart.

Later he served in Madagascar and Italy, earning two Mentions in Despatches and a promotion to full colonel in 1945. He also served as a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent.

==Personal life==
In 1923, Dean married Marjorie Wood. They had one son and one daughter.

<text>Thomas Peck Hunter VC (6 October 1923 – 3 April 1945) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
Thomas Hunter was born at Louise Margaret Hospital in Aldershot on 6 October 1923, one of five children of Ramsey and Mary Hunter (a former soldier and civil servant), who moved to Edinburgh shortly after his birth. Hunter attended Stenhouse Primary School and Tynecastle High School (where the poet Wilfred Owen had taught during recuperation in 1917) before becoming an apprentice stationer in Edinburgh. Hunter&#x27;s nephew, is Scottish First Minister John Swinney. 

==Military career==
At the outbreak of the war he served in the Home Guard and was called up on 8 May 1942 for military service. He enlisted as a hostilities–only (HO) marine on 23 June 1942. He was promoted LCpl on 6 October 1943 and Temporary Cpl on 25 January 1945.

===Victoria Cross===
Hunter was 21 years old, and a temporary corporal in 43 (RM) Commando during the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy during the Second World War when the following incident took place. He was awarded the VC for his actions during Operation Roast.

On 2 April 1945 at Lake Comacchio, Italy, Corporal Hunter, who was in charge of a Bren gun section, offered himself as a target to save his troop. Seizing the Bren gun, he charged alone across 200 yards of open ground under most intense fire towards a group of houses where three MG 42 machine-guns were lodged. So determined was his charge that the enemy soldiers were demoralized and six gunners surrendered. The remainder fled. Hunter cleared the house, changing magazines as he ran and continued to draw enemy fire until most of the troop had reached cover, Hunter was killed, firing accurately to the last. Danish national, Major Anders Lassen of the Special Boat Service (SBS) was also awarded a VC posthumously in the same action.

==Citation==
Cpl Thomas Hunter&#x27;s VC citation in the London Gazette of 12 June 1945 reads:

::ADMIRALTY.
::Whitehall 12 June 1945.

::The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the award of the VICTORIA CROSS for valour to: —

::The late Corporal (Temporary) Thomas Peck HUNTER, CH/X. 110296, Royal Marines (attached Special Service Troops) (43rd Royal Marine Commando) (Edinburgh).

::In Italy during the advance by the Commando to its final objective, Corporal Hunter of &quot;C&quot; Troop was in charge of a Bren group of the leading sub-section of the Commando. Having advanced to within 400 yards of the canal, he observed the enemy were holding a group of houses South of the canal. Realising that his Troop behind him were in the open, as the country there was completely devoid of cover, and that the enemy would cause heavy casualties as soon as they opened fire, Corporal Hunter seized the Bren gun and charged alone across two hundred yards of open ground. Three Spandaus from the houses, and at least six from the North bank of the canal opened fire and at the same time the enemy mortars started to fire at the Troop.

::Corporal Hunter attracted most of the fire, and so determined was his charge and his firing from the hip that the enemy in the houses became demoralised. Showing complete disregard for the intense enemy fire, he ran through the houses, changing magazines as he ran, and alone cleared the houses. Six Germans surrendered to him and the remainder fled across a footbridge onto the North bank of the canal.

::The Troop dashing up behind Corporal Hunter now became the target for all the Spandaus on the North of the canal. Again, offering himself as a target, he lay in full view of the enemy on a heap of rubble and fired at the concrete pillboxes on the other side. He again drew most of the fire, but by now the greater part of the Troop had made for the safety of the houses. During this period he shouted encouragement to the remainder, and called only for more Bren magazines with which he could engage the Spandaus. Firing with great accuracy up to the last, Corporal Hunter was finally hit in the head by a burst of Spandau fire and killed instantly.

::There can be no doubt that Corporal Hunter offered himself as a target in order to save his Troop, and only the speed of his movement prevented him being hit earlier. The skill and accuracy with which he used his Bren gun is proved by the way he demoralised the enemy, and later did definitely silence many of the Spandaus firing on his Troop as they crossed open ground, so much so that under his covering fire elements of the Troop made their final objective before he was killed.

::Throughout the operation his magnificent courage, leadership and cheerfulness had been an inspiration to his comrades.

King George VI presented his VC to his parents at a private investiture on 26 September 1945 at Holyrood House. In September 1974 the medal was donated by his sister and nephew to the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea, where all 10 Royal Marines VCs are securely stored, the medal on display there being a copy.

==Legacy==
Hunter is buried at the Argenta Gap (CWGC) War Cemetery, Emilia-Romagna in plot III.G.20.

<text>The I Tatti Everyday Renaissance Library is a book series published byHarvard University Press, which aims to present important works of Italian Renaissance Latin Literature to a modern audience by printing the original Latin text on each left-hand leaf (verso), and an English translation on the facing page (recto). The idea was initially conceived by Walter Kaiser, former professor of English and Comparative Literature at Harvard and director of the Villa I Tatti and James Hankins. Its goal is to be the Italian Renaissance version of the Loeb Classical Library. James Hankins, Professor of History at Harvard University, is the General Editor.

Many of the books in the series have never been translated into English before, and the series promises to increase the understanding of the Renaissance among the general public and non-specialist historians by making primary sources accessible, thus giving a window into the minds of Renaissance thinkers themselves.

The books of The I Tatti Renaissance Library have a consistent appearance: a pale blue cover, analogous to the red (Latin) or green (Greek) books in the Loeb Classical Library. They are, however, closer
in size to a standard hardcover book than to the pocket-sized books of the Loeb series. A typeface named &quot;ITRL&quot;, based on the work of Renaissance typographer Nicolas Jenson, was specially designed for the series. The books are notable for their overall readability. Anthony Grafton said of the Latin texts: &quot;though not full, critical editions, [they] are correct, well punctuated and readable. The English translations have an unusual clarity, elegance and precision&quot;.

The series is named after the Villa I Tatti in Florence, which houses the Center for Italian Renaissance Studies of Harvard University.

<text>William Mariner (29 May 1882 – 1 July 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Mariner, the son of Mrs A. Wignall was 32 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

The citation for the award, published in the London Gazette on 23 June 1915, read:
==Death==
William Mariner was killed on the evening of 30 June 1916 or the early morning of 1 July 1916 during a large scale raid in the Railway Triangle, south of Loos. This raid was a diversionary attack on the eve of the Somme offensive. His death was witnessed by Giles E. M. Eyre and others who wrote &quot;that Mariner seemed to lose control during a heavy bombardment, ran down an enemy trench and was last seen bayoneting a German as a shell exploded on him, blowing him to pieces.&quot;

<text>Waldemar Koch (25 September 1880 – 15 May 1963) was a German liberal politician and economist.

He was born in Bad Harzburg, Duchy of Brunswick. Koch studied Economics, Philosophy and History at Berlin. He received a doctorate in 1907 for a dissertation titled &quot;Consolidation in the German Electrical Industry&quot; (&quot;Konzentration in der dt. Elektroindustrie&quot;). Between 1907 and 1910 he undertook an extensive study tour that included Russia, China and the United States.

He also worked for AEG from 1905 to 1907, returning to the company to head a London-based company for them from 1910 to 1914.

During World War I he served in the German army. In 1918 he joined the German Democratic Party &quot;(Deutsche Demokratische Partei)&quot;. Between the wars he worked as an economist and professor at Technische Universität Berlin.

After World War II he co-founded the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD) in the Soviet Occupied Zone (SBZ). In 1945 he was briefly the Chairman of the LDPD, but the Soviets forced him to resign after a few months. He opposed the land reform plans of the Soviet authorities and the Socialist Unity Party (SED). Koch was a member of the LDPD&#x27;s executive committee until 1948.

In 1949 he went to West Germany (West Berlin) and again worked as an economics professor. From 1948 to 1956 Koch was a member of the liberal FDP (Free Democratic Party).
